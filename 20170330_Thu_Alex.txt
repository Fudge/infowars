[00:00.000 --> 00:21.320]  coming to you live from the info wars dot com studios in the recaptured state of texas
[00:21.320 --> 00:38.880]  it's alex jones feels good to be able to say that texas is in better straits than it
[00:38.880 --> 00:46.760]  was just a few years ago and you can say now it's partially free again california is gone
[00:46.760 --> 01:00.600]  gone gone fallen to corruption fallen to evil dc is a fetid swamp crying out to be drained
[01:00.600 --> 01:08.000]  trump has turned the economy back on and only 68 days in office and so you go to cnn
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.960]  the globalist news network it looks like it's going to get even worse for trump where the
[01:13.960 --> 01:21.960]  possible shutdown on the russian investigation looming trumps rode ahead could be grim and
[01:21.960 --> 01:28.200]  now we've got republican members of the senate coming out and oh they're very concerned the
[01:28.200 --> 01:36.720]  same republican establishment that is in bed with paul ryan and you can bet your bottom
[01:36.720 --> 01:42.800]  dollar that they're working together behind the scenes to bring down trump and van jones
[01:42.800 --> 01:50.320]  says trump may have signed earth's death warrant that's right but only the super friends hillary
[01:50.320 --> 01:56.440]  and others by paying them carbon taxes directly can save you as a carbon dioxide out of a cold
[01:56.440 --> 02:01.480]  plant here in the united states giving us cheap clean energy is bad but china can have smokestacks
[02:01.480 --> 02:07.000]  no scrubbers as they're called the thing that looks like a small town all the tubes and
[02:07.000 --> 02:14.360]  things all the big containment facilities that's what they run the cold smoke through
[02:14.360 --> 02:19.880]  and they get all these distillants out that are used for roofing your house that are used
[02:19.880 --> 02:26.720]  for creating steel that are used for all sorts of different operations creating artificial
[02:26.720 --> 02:33.480]  diamonds yes that's where they get the carbon literally thousands of products coming out
[02:33.480 --> 02:40.120]  of the cold power plants you look at china they were just showing some photos of china
[02:40.120 --> 02:50.160]  that's real smoke coming out but they always only show our power plants in the winter those
[02:50.160 --> 02:57.240]  are nuclear plants that's steam but they always show us plants and british plants in the winter
[02:57.240 --> 03:04.600]  because the steam goes further the warm water vapor and carbon dioxide coming out just like
[03:04.600 --> 03:08.440]  during the winter when you breathe outside it's cold you see condensation kids they could
[03:08.440 --> 03:14.680]  smoke but it's water vapor they show the water vapor and say oh my god we're all dead look
[03:14.680 --> 03:21.000]  at the pollution treating you like you're a moron meanwhile in china on most days they
[03:21.000 --> 03:26.200]  have to wear masks people die every day from the smog it is living hell poll Watson has
[03:26.200 --> 03:32.600]  been all over china because he was married it's five six years to a nice chinese lady
[03:32.600 --> 03:39.680]  their divorce now and he said it was hell on earth he went all over the country would
[03:39.680 --> 03:44.400]  be shaken down by the police you think mexico is bad when they tried to go see to bet or
[03:44.400 --> 03:49.080]  try to travel around and see some of the sites he said china's got some beautiful beautiful
[03:49.080 --> 03:56.280]  areas but it's all just corruption and backstabbing and just dead people on a side of street and
[03:56.280 --> 04:03.280]  crap all over the ground and just but that's the sucking sound Ross Perot talked about
[04:03.280 --> 04:08.400]  you lower our wages you take our jobs overseas it doesn't build up the chinese it drives
[04:08.400 --> 04:15.400]  them down meanwhile most of china's not even populated the government didn't want the population
[04:15.400 --> 04:21.800]  to not be under their control so they forced them into sectors and into valleys where they
[04:21.800 --> 04:25.800]  forced them to be collectivized and farmed and then you can't make a living doing that
[04:25.800 --> 04:30.840]  so you then go to the city it is a truly nightmare situation you know I've already digressed excuse

[08:22.280 --> 08:28.560]  to spew his senile and paranoid fantasies on the airwaves thinks that Ivanka trump and
[08:28.560 --> 08:33.600]  her husband jared kushner may have people murdered if they look at them and when they're
[08:33.600 --> 08:38.320]  out to eat somewhere Ivanka is now officially an advisor to her father for the last several
[08:38.320 --> 08:43.480]  months she's had an office in the white house and in an unofficial role she's been an advisor
[08:43.480 --> 08:50.600]  but now she is officially part of the white house staff although it is an unpaid position
[08:50.600 --> 08:55.960]  she decided to forgo her salary and what this really means is that she is just now held
[08:55.960 --> 09:01.840]  accountable to the ethical standards of government employees but now that her role is official
[09:01.840 --> 09:07.280]  in his spark new paranoid delusions amongst the liberal lunatics take it away chris mathews
[09:07.280 --> 09:11.200]  you know uday and kusay working for Saddam Hussein you couldn't go to a restaurant and
[09:11.200 --> 09:15.800]  have eye contact when this guy's like getting killed these people are really powerful imagine
[09:15.800 --> 09:21.000]  getting to a fight in the office with jared or Ivanka they have enormous power and they're
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.280]  always going to be there this is what i worry about for other people in the white house
[09:24.280 --> 09:28.760]  Ivanka trump has been described as her father's eyes and ears on the ground that's a little
[09:28.760 --> 09:33.560]  scary if you're just a regular white house staffer yes you heard him correctly he just
[09:33.560 --> 09:38.640]  compared Ivanka trump and her husband jared kushner working for the president to Saddam
[09:38.640 --> 09:45.040]  Hussein's two psychotic and murderous sons working for him one of which reportedly covered
[09:45.040 --> 09:51.920]  a woman in honey and then fed her to two hungry and angry dogs who ripped her apart i don't
[09:51.920 --> 09:55.680]  know what the hell they're smoking over there at msnbc because it wasn't that long ago that
[09:55.680 --> 10:00.960]  reporter katie turr who covered the trump campaign throughout the entire 2016 election
[10:00.960 --> 10:05.960]  expressed concerns that president trump may start assassinating journalists what is your
[10:05.960 --> 10:12.880]  sense of why this president is going above and beyond bending over backwards if you will
[10:12.880 --> 10:19.840]  to stay away from criticizing the russian president and it's almost give him an excuse
[10:19.840 --> 10:25.760]  as we know there's since 2000 been a couple dozen suspicious deaths of journalists in
[10:25.760 --> 10:30.280]  russia who came out against the government there and donald trump has made no secret
[10:30.280 --> 10:35.040]  about going after journalists and then his distaste for any news that doesn't agree with
[10:35.040 --> 10:40.400]  him here do you find that this is a dangerous path he is heading down i think the enemy
[10:40.400 --> 10:45.400]  propaganda that spews out of your network is dangerous president trump you and Ivanka
[10:45.400 --> 10:49.320]  aren't going to start killing your critics are you i'm totally against that right by
[10:49.320 --> 10:54.440]  the way i hate some of these people but i'd never kill them i hate them no i think no
[10:54.440 --> 11:00.840]  these people honestly i'll be honest i'll be honest i would never kill them are you
[11:00.840 --> 11:09.360]  sure i would never do that okay uh positive that's safe no i wouldn't okay i would never
[11:09.360 --> 11:13.640]  kill them well thanks for clearing that up mr president we do have some good news though
[11:13.640 --> 11:18.560]  a new poll conducted by monmouth university shows that six out of ten americans think
[11:18.560 --> 11:24.440]  that mainstream media reports fake news buzzfeed is currently being sued for putting out fake
[11:24.440 --> 11:30.480]  news for publishing that shameful pathetic defamatory clickbait article about the debunked
[11:30.480 --> 11:36.000]  donald trump russian dossier which claimed that he was caught on camera getting urinated
[11:36.000 --> 11:41.200]  on by russian hookers unfortunately it's not president trump who is suing buzzfeed but
[11:41.200 --> 11:46.360]  a russian tech guru who was mentioned in the story is suing buzzfeed and their senior
[11:46.360 --> 11:52.080]  editor ben smith for defamation because they mentioned him in the article they have since
[11:52.080 --> 11:58.560]  apologized and retracted his name but the lawsuit is still going forward in other insane news
[11:58.560 --> 12:03.200]  michael moore is blaming president trump for the extinction of the human race and no i'm
[12:03.200 --> 12:07.520]  not joking every time i see crazy tweets like this floating around instead of just
[12:07.520 --> 12:11.120]  reporting on it because i don't want to be inaccurate i don't want to get duped by a
[12:11.120 --> 12:16.680]  satire of parody fake tweets i go to the official twitter account to make sure that it was a
[12:16.680 --> 12:21.640]  real tweet it's almost impossible to tell satire from the actual liberal agenda these
[12:21.640 --> 12:26.280]  days they're that insane and so this from the official michael moore verified twitter
[12:26.280 --> 12:33.860]  account yes historians in the near future will mark today march 28th 2017 as the day
[12:33.860 --> 12:42.960]  of the extinction of human life on earth began thanks to donald trump that's the great
[12:42.960 --> 12:51.600]  mark dice we also have van jones on cnn saying that trump is going to kill the planet and
[12:51.600 --> 12:57.640]  we also have april ryan responds to sean spicer praise by implying he's sexist so you can
[12:57.640 --> 13:02.040]  say that evanke trump shouldn't be in the lighthouse it's creepy to have your family
[13:02.040 --> 13:06.280]  working with you and around you that's why the world's always worked until recent times
[13:06.280 --> 13:11.400]  when the family's dirty and creepy and don't say you have a father or mother on your kindergarten
[13:11.400 --> 13:16.080]  entrance papers to school because someone else might not have a mother or father or don't
[13:16.080 --> 13:24.280]  say mankind in a paper you'll be given you know 20 points off your last names grab her
[13:24.280 --> 13:28.120]  i guess you can't use that in documents of your license plate because it's hurtful this
[13:28.120 --> 13:37.200]  is the attack on common sense the assault on knowledge the assault on language itself
[13:37.200 --> 13:43.560]  by design imagine saying that trump having some of his family around the white house
[13:43.560 --> 13:46.720]  because he trusts them and knows they can get things done they're already successful
[13:46.720 --> 13:50.640]  business people who've made hundreds of millions of dollars if not billions in the case of
[13:50.640 --> 13:55.280]  jared kushner on his own with millions he was given by family the point is these are
[13:55.280 --> 14:00.400]  good stewards these are smart people that's who you're supposed to have do you know who
[14:00.400 --> 14:05.960]  i have at info wars running things my dad and then i've got my first cousin buckley who
[14:05.960 --> 14:11.040]  does a lot of key work around here and i've got my sister working here because they're
[14:11.040 --> 14:19.160]  competent and i can trust them that's what families for but see they invert reality and
[14:19.160 --> 14:25.040]  have this hysteria now oh my god a new russian investigation republicans are joining in of
[14:25.040 --> 14:31.400]  course republicans are driving it like john mccain so they've gone from there is no intelligence
[14:31.400 --> 14:35.360]  to oh we were spying on you well first we're spying on you know we never did that you're
[14:35.360 --> 14:41.760]  crazy now we did spy on you we have the evidence we're going to bring it out and then trump
[14:41.760 --> 14:45.440]  keeps saying bring it out bring it out because the house intelligence committee has seen
[14:45.440 --> 14:53.960]  it phone calls by jared kushner and general flinn with the russians lining up calls with
[14:53.960 --> 15:02.560]  the president that's what happens donald trump calls he's just a secretary can you talk to
[15:02.560 --> 15:08.000]  mr trump now president trump and you're talking to the president or he just calls you up but
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.280]  sometimes the secretary calls and says are you available to talk to the president are
[15:12.280 --> 15:17.920]  you available to talk to president elect or before that trump absolutely all right he's
[15:17.920 --> 15:22.760]  going to call you in two minutes boom trump calls you but the point is that's what goes
[15:22.760 --> 15:28.880]  on that's what happens that that's how they line up these phone calls but trump can't
[15:28.880 --> 15:34.320]  just call putin up he has to have someone an intermediary go line up heads of state talking
[15:34.320 --> 15:39.560]  but again their big victory here is not even so much trying to remove trump from office
[15:39.560 --> 15:43.640]  which they're building towards the big picture they've already gotten is any communication
[15:43.640 --> 15:53.160]  with russia becomes a huge illegal activity in the public mind when it's not or sean
[15:53.160 --> 15:58.160]  spicer makes a joke about russian dressing russian salad dressing and it becomes an issue
[15:58.160 --> 16:05.120]  oh my god let's investigate salad dressing it's now reach total boogie man witch hunt
[16:05.120 --> 16:12.640]  look under the table proportions that's right video see an investigated russian salad dressing
[16:12.640 --> 16:17.960]  after white house press secretary joke network say spicer is racist and sexes for asking reporter
[16:17.960 --> 16:25.440]  not to shake her head at him which is just the body language of you ask a question and
[16:25.440 --> 16:29.520]  then you rudely are saying you're a liar with your body language 90% of communications
[16:29.520 --> 16:34.400]  is body language when it's physical it's it's not audible and it's his verbal communication
[16:34.400 --> 16:39.600]  don't shake your head at me like I'm full of baloney we ought to play that clip I've
[16:39.600 --> 16:45.680]  never gotten to that clip from a few days ago but that becomes the big controversy april
[16:45.680 --> 16:52.080]  ryan responds to sean spicer is praised by an implying he's sexist but oh nunez isn't
[16:52.080 --> 16:58.520]  qualified they just keep saying he's not qualified what does that mean when he's the head of
[16:58.520 --> 17:05.520]  the house intelligence committee and as a good long record it just makes no sense a panel
[17:05.520 --> 17:10.640]  on spicer and april ryan goes nuts i'm gonna play some of these clips because again we
[17:10.640 --> 17:18.240]  have all this incredible news to break down but when you understand the context of the
[17:18.240 --> 17:24.200]  type of people were fighting it's just crazy but the good news is we have several reports
[17:24.200 --> 17:30.080]  today one is by john bound maxine waters and chuck schumer psycho dims on the loose just
[17:30.080 --> 17:40.160]  shows what bumbling babbling ding dons they are and then you've got all these other clips
[17:40.160 --> 17:44.520]  where they're freaking out and melting down and acting like complete idiots i mean it's
[17:44.520 --> 17:50.240]  just everywhere chuck schumer has a hard time with simple leftist chant again they're acting
[17:50.240 --> 17:55.240]  very senile very off balance suddenly in the last few months i think they're completely
[17:55.240 --> 18:01.200]  stunned they thought they were invincible and all the things you're seeing all the harassment
[18:01.200 --> 18:06.680]  of the independent press and all the disinformation all the things they're doing are attempts to
[18:06.680 --> 18:13.440]  again triple down on the lies because the lies always worked in the past and the fact
[18:13.440 --> 18:25.760]  that it suddenly isn't working has them panicking and has them panicking in a big big big way
[18:25.760 --> 18:30.800]  meanwhile let's let's just before i get to that look at a couple little mini hoaxes it
[18:30.800 --> 18:37.680]  was spring break judge depolitano has personally told me years ago that he likes to take off
[18:37.680 --> 18:43.400]  a few weeks in march when things start to warm up a little bit on the east coast and go kayaking
[18:43.400 --> 18:49.440]  at his farm in new jersey and the few times i've met him it's all he talks about is his
[18:49.440 --> 18:56.300]  farm in new jersey he just likes rural things likes his garden likes kayaking in the river
[18:56.300 --> 19:00.280]  and by the way he was scheduled to go on vacation for a week and a half he went on vacation
[19:00.280 --> 19:04.840]  and they lied and said he'd been suspended or maybe fired because he said there was foreign
[19:04.840 --> 19:09.320]  intelligence that the u.s. was doing that caught up the president elect that's the fact that
[19:09.320 --> 19:15.120]  goes on they record the president elect with a phone system he uses when he starts making
[19:15.120 --> 19:18.760]  calls the foreign leaders and a transcript is released to the national archives and they
[19:18.760 --> 19:25.520]  decide whether to make it public or not that's been going on since jfk and sometimes before
[19:25.520 --> 19:35.080]  with eisenhower they come out and say that the highly respected judge is an idiot and
[19:35.080 --> 19:40.560]  then he's been suspended suspended fox news expert returns and doubles down on baseless
[19:40.560 --> 19:47.520]  bartending claims no the washington post doubled down yesterday with the same lie as before
[19:47.520 --> 19:53.040]  he went on spring break that's why you've been seeing the ads on fox this week bills
[19:53.040 --> 19:59.200]  back bills back bills back you notice you've seen the second string on fox news which i
[19:59.200 --> 20:03.400]  like a lot better than some of the first string but the point is i watch fox some in the morning
[20:03.400 --> 20:09.200]  when i'm on the elliptical or working out everybody's on spring break in the middle
[20:09.200 --> 20:16.840]  and late into march bill o'reilly hasn't been suspended he was on spring break fox put out
[20:16.840 --> 20:24.800]  a statement said he was on spring break he was not suspended so again they're spinning
[20:24.800 --> 20:30.920]  all of this napolitano came out when he was on vacation a day into it and said i'm on
[20:30.920 --> 20:36.200]  vacation this is fake news no one picked that up but us again you're saying well there's
[20:36.200 --> 20:39.920]  bigger things in the world than this alex i know there is the point is it's the way
[20:39.920 --> 20:46.720]  they lie the way they twist the way they spin so now they're getting even more out of control
[20:46.720 --> 20:51.640]  i made phone calls to bruce fine former chief counsel of the federal communications commission
[20:51.640 --> 20:57.760]  i read the briefs i read the reports i read what the outgoing head of the FCC said and
[20:57.760 --> 21:01.920]  other members of it that have been defending free speech and saying the federal elections
[21:01.920 --> 21:06.720]  commission and the FCC should not be over the internet that's the republican members
[21:06.720 --> 21:13.160]  that have been defending it now the republican house moves just as the FCC has done to say
[21:13.160 --> 21:16.800]  we're not doing obama's net neutrality you go wait a minute we all want that neutrality
[21:16.800 --> 21:23.880]  i want it too it's a name it's not net neutrality it was the FCC and the federal elections commission
[21:23.880 --> 21:28.960]  declaring full jurisdiction over the internet and the intent to openly ban info wars and
[21:28.960 --> 21:34.320]  drudge off of advertising on the internet or having political links that is their stated
[21:34.320 --> 21:41.760]  admission now and the members of the democratic FCC and federal elections commission last
[21:41.760 --> 21:50.120]  week issued statements again saying they intend to shut down drudge report if drudge can't
[21:50.120 --> 21:54.040]  link to articles that are deemed political they can't link to anything it's the same thing
[21:54.040 --> 22:00.640]  ad role oh you're political you're not allowed to have political ads what we're not packs
[22:00.640 --> 22:04.120]  we're not registered we're not collecting money for political stuff everything we do
[22:04.120 --> 22:12.600]  is political free speech is political my ads for my website or my show or for supplements
[22:12.600 --> 22:19.360]  or for body armor or for seeds or water filters that's what we ran ads for very successfully
[22:19.360 --> 22:25.600]  and ad role bands us and now media matters is making a big thing out of it going around
[22:25.600 --> 22:31.520]  saying shut off our money kick us off get rid of us and then behind the scenes trying to
[22:31.520 --> 22:38.720]  cook up other actions against us torches interference in my opinion by the very definition but you
[22:38.720 --> 22:42.040]  know call it what you want remember that memo came out five years ago political reported
[22:42.040 --> 22:50.120]  we probably pull it up the exact headline was media matters memo shows plan to take
[22:50.120 --> 22:55.680]  down right wing media but then you read it says things like fox news you know info wars
[22:55.680 --> 23:07.400]  and it says we will physically infiltrate and bring institutions down from within I'm
[23:07.400 --> 23:17.680]  not at liberty to get into it because it gets into classified information but there has
[23:17.680 --> 23:21.640]  been operations ongoing and I'm not going to say by media matters the media matters
[23:21.640 --> 23:26.120]  is called for them but by groups connected even to foreign intelligence trying to bring
[23:26.120 --> 23:29.960]  down info wars because see if they can't get our own intelligence agencies to do it they're
[23:29.960 --> 23:39.280]  going to farm it out the Saudi Arabians the Chinese are all over our asses okay I mean
[23:39.280 --> 23:44.040]  this country is in a total war right now for its very survival and how many times have
[23:44.040 --> 23:49.840]  I told you the UN and the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie endowment and all the same groups
[23:49.840 --> 23:54.960]  you hear that underwrite MPR they're the ones that go get the major fortune 500 to then put
[23:54.960 --> 24:01.320]  billions a year behind all the anti-family anti-gun anti-border crap you see and they
[24:01.320 --> 24:07.080]  have been openly teaching for 60 years in the entire southwest now it's nationwide that
[24:07.080 --> 24:13.080]  Mexicans have been abused and and had their mythical kingdom of Oslon it's literally taken
[24:13.080 --> 24:20.600]  out of a lion the witch in the wardrobe idea and that the mythical Texas all the way through
[24:20.600 --> 24:28.680]  Colorado to California up into Oregon is Oslon and there's actually UN models and maps to
[24:28.680 --> 24:32.920]  put us into a super region and then break the country up into ethnically controlled
[24:32.920 --> 24:37.400]  enclaves called Balkanization the British called it the great game this is admitted
[24:37.400 --> 24:47.720]  in the WikiLeaks and now top story on Drudge EU boss we will break up the USA that's not
[24:47.720 --> 24:59.840]  Alex Jones saying they're planning that that's out of his mouth Junker there's video EU could
[24:59.840 --> 25:06.680]  break up the US Junker in jaw-dropping threat to Trump over support for Brexit they've swallowed
[25:06.680 --> 25:11.240]  England without a vote ever happening make 91% of their laws the Brits don't like it
[25:11.240 --> 25:16.080]  and they're so arrogant they said we'll march our military into other states that try to
[25:16.080 --> 25:21.400]  leave they don't dare say that to England but they dare say it to France to Germany
[25:21.400 --> 25:32.120]  to Italy to Greece to Spain the EU has been threatening to send in EU troops into Catalonia
[25:32.120 --> 25:35.120]  because those folks aren't Spanish they're not French to their own group it goes back
[25:35.120 --> 25:41.560]  more than 5000 years they're interesting culture the point is is that's the big breath that's
[25:41.560 --> 25:46.160]  who makes all the money and the most creative in Spain they're also the area that held
[25:46.160 --> 25:51.640]  out everything about the Muslims but if you continue to break all this down understand
[25:51.640 --> 25:57.840]  the history of it they said we'll march EU troops and if you don't stay under Spain
[25:57.840 --> 26:11.840]  and the EU this is military threat and I guess no one took Hitler serious till he started
[26:11.840 --> 26:21.200]  going into Danzig and into Czechoslovakia and then into Poland and of course into Austria
[26:21.200 --> 26:29.480]  and then you know the rest of the story into France and then into North Africa and then
[26:29.480 --> 26:35.600]  into Russia and NATO's ignoring our troops in NATO or under NATO command ignoring what
[26:35.600 --> 26:39.320]  a U.S. president says that freaks Trump out he wouldn't know why Trump's freaked out he's
[26:39.320 --> 26:44.280]  learned that our military is basically run by NATO when it's in NATO and NATO is the
[26:44.280 --> 26:49.400]  UN EU globalist army and we're right back where we were and Russia doesn't like the
[26:49.400 --> 26:54.880]  EU and American patriots don't like the EU and so they say oh we're with Russia because
[26:54.880 --> 26:58.800]  we don't like a giant authoritarian state with nuclear weapons threatening to invade
[26:58.800 --> 27:07.560]  everywhere and the EU is what's trying to gobble up all the member states around Russia
[27:07.560 --> 27:17.680]  the EU is a giant disgusting unelected creature the EU was set up as a steel deal in the Treaty
[27:17.680 --> 27:29.040]  of London and then a decade later completed in the Treaty of Rome 1956 1949 the 1956 it's
[27:29.040 --> 27:34.640]  all my film in game I show all the documents all the treaties but then it allowed the co-opting
[27:34.640 --> 27:39.200]  of the politicians to then start creating boards that transferred power out of the country
[27:39.200 --> 27:44.240]  and then suddenly you wake up and you're under EU control and they're saying we will march
[27:44.240 --> 27:52.000]  troops into Greece into Italy we will do whatever we want and the EU was openly involved in
[27:52.000 --> 27:57.720]  the election remember giving money and trying to stop Trump and running bots and they say
[27:57.720 --> 28:03.880]  the Russians the EU is way more powerful than Russia economically the EU has an economy
[28:03.880 --> 28:06.880]  that is the third largest if not the second largest in the world depending on how you
[28:06.880 --> 28:11.480]  slice it because you got the US still number one China number two the EU a close third
[28:11.480 --> 28:16.000]  but you really look at a real industrialization and stuff you could argue when it comes to
[28:16.000 --> 28:22.480]  high-tech industrialization Europe is numero oh no because the elite are based there the
[28:22.480 --> 28:31.600]  public doesn't get any of it you go to Switzerland or something it's like you're in a spaceship
[28:31.600 --> 28:37.320]  surrounded by beautiful green mountains everywhere it's like what's going on here you go there
[28:37.320 --> 28:43.600]  and I want to come back EU could break up the US Junker in jaw dropping threat to Trump
[28:43.600 --> 28:49.680]  over support for Brexit European Union boss Jean-Claude Junker they had Nazi aircraft
[28:49.680 --> 28:57.000]  called Junkers that's a first family name this afternoon issued a jaw dropping threat
[28:57.000 --> 29:02.200]  to the United States saying he could campaign to break up the country in revenge for Donald
[29:02.200 --> 29:09.880]  Trump's supportive comments about Brexit you're not a country the people don't want to be in
[29:09.880 --> 29:19.320]  it the member states didn't get to vote on it but let's go look at the girl in the leotard
[29:19.320 --> 29:26.560]  that's probably more important better looking at Junker I'll tell you that and they just
[29:26.560 --> 29:32.400]  goes through it all so this is where we stand this is where we are this is what we're dealing
[29:32.400 --> 29:36.600]  with communist Chinese the EU all in our business and get out of our business will get in your
[29:36.600 --> 29:41.680]  business hey the EU is the global government it is in our business it's our enemy it's
[29:41.680 --> 29:45.840]  a whole region already taken over we want to free them we want to be free we want Russia
[29:45.840 --> 29:50.320]  to be free we want North Korea to be free want Venezuela to be free we're on the March
[29:50.320 --> 30:01.240]  the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network well John Podesta crawled

[30:05.600 --> 30:10.240]  not happy that the Daily Caller published a story headline exclusive John Podesta may
[30:10.240 --> 30:16.000]  have violated federal law by not disclosing 75,000 stock shares the Daily Caller story
[30:16.000 --> 30:20.920]  alleges that Podesta failed to disclose the receipt of 75,000 shares of stock from a
[30:20.920 --> 30:27.040]  Kremlin finance company when he joined the Hussein Obama White House team in 2014 Hussein's
[30:27.040 --> 30:31.880]  counsel Mark Elias has sent a cease and desist letter to the Daily Caller saying that Podesta
[30:31.880 --> 30:37.000]  did nothing wrong and he met all obligations regarding the deal then Podesta tweeted out
[30:37.000 --> 30:42.120]  false stories about me can't cover up Trump's growing Russia problem wait a minute they are
[30:42.120 --> 30:48.240]  still investigating Trump investigating we have you right here Podesta in the open making

[33:10.520 --> 33:17.520]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[33:41.520 --> 33:49.320]  now I'm calling junker it's junker john claude junker he's the head of the EU and I've read
[33:49.320 --> 33:55.400]  so much history that I went you know I know who he is he's he was the president of luxembourg
[33:55.400 --> 34:01.400]  which is the richest little country in the world tax exempt and it makes Switzerland look
[34:01.400 --> 34:08.120]  poor in the type of money and drug money and you name it that goes through it and basically
[34:08.120 --> 34:13.800]  NATO wanders its money through it so john claude junker or junker is how if you just
[34:13.800 --> 34:18.680]  spelled it out about the german pronunciation I was sitting there thinking about him and
[34:18.680 --> 34:29.680]  I went wait a minute the most powerful family in germany that backed hitler was the junkers
[34:29.680 --> 34:36.920]  I remember reading about the junkers and they even had their aircraft company junker that
[34:36.920 --> 34:41.880]  had bombers and fighter bombers and all the rest of it from world war two there's the
[34:41.880 --> 34:50.680]  yunkers ju 88 there were a bunch of them they had a yunker dive bombers that would accelerate
[34:50.680 --> 34:57.720]  down and then scream back up that way they could hit their targets dead on and a lot
[34:57.720 --> 35:05.800]  of loving weapons the ju 8hc the ju 8hr again let's look at the dive bomber let's go back
[35:05.800 --> 35:09.640]  up to the top there where it lists all the aircraft they made there's like 15 of them
[35:09.640 --> 35:14.600]  or so there yeah go to the dive bomber there you go the loving oh they really like those
[35:14.600 --> 35:18.240]  in greece when they yeah they first used a bunch of those and they came in greece and
[35:18.240 --> 35:23.400]  then would dive bomb all the fortresses and emplacements with them talk about horrifying
[35:23.400 --> 35:32.360]  yes they made the first attack bomber so it's just interesting to have background because
[35:32.360 --> 35:37.000]  that's why i get so frustrated when i see these people on tv i see yunker on tv and then
[35:37.000 --> 35:42.360]  i immediately get pissed because my brain pulls up there's the famous dive bomber in fact
[35:42.360 --> 35:46.240]  the biggest ace of world war two i forget his name was a german dive bomber he destroyed
[35:46.240 --> 35:55.840]  like 500 russian tanks with his uh with his uh dive bomber yunker aircraft 500 and that
[35:55.840 --> 36:00.520]  was the confirmed kills then they then they what was his name then they took him out of
[36:00.520 --> 36:04.640]  that when the jets came out and i was i was watching an interview with him before he died
[36:04.640 --> 36:07.280]  and he got a bit determined to have the best aces because they would just stay in the air
[36:07.280 --> 36:11.920]  like 15 hours a day and when the jet got shut down he turned it around the road was blowing
[36:11.920 --> 36:16.480]  tanks up with it with his cannon as they came down the road i mean just crazy stuff yeah
[36:16.480 --> 36:21.600]  it was like something 500 tanks he blew up with his yunker so let's talk about who real
[36:21.600 --> 36:26.360]  nazis are shall we because this guy was alive when this was going on and we need to do an
[36:26.360 --> 36:31.080]  investigative report on his family because they were the basically the the nobility and
[36:31.080 --> 36:37.040]  ruled prussia which was the jewel of the crown of the austrian hungarian empire and guess
[36:37.040 --> 36:42.680]  what prussia did it produced slave soldiers who were so into being slaves in their fancy
[36:42.680 --> 36:48.040]  black hessian boots and their blue uniforms that they were proud that they were raised
[36:48.040 --> 36:53.680]  their entire life to fight and die so that's where the nazis got that particular leadership
[36:53.680 --> 36:57.000]  of submarine captains and people that didn't care about dying whole crews that wanted to
[36:57.000 --> 37:02.640]  die nobody cared they were just ready to kill came out of prussia and who helped set it up
[37:02.640 --> 37:08.040]  and modern psychiatry and everything out of prussia our little boss that says he'll break
[37:08.040 --> 37:14.120]  the us up and he means it and he's threatening to of course he's from luxenberg now because
[37:14.120 --> 37:17.920]  he can tax the germans and suck off of them and have them fund the whole e you while he
[37:17.920 --> 37:29.880]  and his family sit tax-free in luxenberg he is a luxenberg politician since 2014 yonker
[37:29.880 --> 37:33.520]  has been president of the european commission which is unelected i should point out but
[37:33.520 --> 37:38.440]  runs it which is the european union e you executive branch that just created itself
[37:38.440 --> 37:46.560]  main future what about real nazis that's one on screen baby that's the real deal you
[37:46.560 --> 37:52.160]  want to talk about counteract you know you're looking at it and just pull up his family in
[37:52.160 --> 37:57.320]  fact let's let's let's pull up his bio let's let's get in his hold up born in 1954 i guess
[37:57.320 --> 38:02.640]  he looks old he missed it his major influence was his father joseph who was forcibly conscripted
[38:02.640 --> 38:08.360]  oh of course everyone got an order to be conscripted they didn't volunteer into the
[38:08.360 --> 38:12.880]  such little lawyer game they play you get the order you go in it isn't born in 54 his
[38:12.880 --> 38:17.360]  major influence was his father joseph who was forcibly conscripted into the nazi army
[38:17.360 --> 38:23.600]  just like george soros during the war and packed off the russian front he bore the scars
[38:23.600 --> 38:28.600]  of combat mental and physical for the rest of his days but stoically declined to discuss
[38:28.600 --> 38:34.000]  his suffering oh oh the nazi soldier of the richest family in germany is so cool he's
[38:34.000 --> 38:49.360]  so good he had to do it he got ordered to it gets better it gets better this is this is
[38:49.360 --> 39:03.440]  why i get frustrated constantly george soros for four years had a hungarian handler and
[39:03.440 --> 39:10.920]  they would send him in when he was 13 14 15 16 to ferret outward jews were hidden and
[39:10.920 --> 39:15.120]  then they would rob all their stuff and sell them out to the nazis and there's been books
[39:15.120 --> 39:19.960]  written by this by jewish historians you name it about madeline albright's family remember
[39:19.960 --> 39:24.320]  she got caught with the stolen art worth tens of millions in her house stolen from jews
[39:24.320 --> 39:31.840]  that were killed she was jewish her dad managed selling jews out yonker attended a boarding
[39:31.840 --> 39:36.720]  school in belgium and university in al-satia al-satian where he is thought to have met
[39:36.720 --> 39:42.640]  his future wife christine's father was one of hitler's so-called propaganda commissars
[39:42.640 --> 39:47.840]  oh he married into one of the top hitler of course and was among those responsible for
[39:47.840 --> 39:53.640]  the germification of his home country of luxembourg oh exactly that it's not just he moved there
[39:53.640 --> 40:00.640]  to be tax exempt they took it over that's nice little duchy for him he also helped enforce
[40:00.640 --> 40:05.200]  the neurenberg laws that stripped jews of their rights and was the precursor to the
[40:05.200 --> 40:11.480]  holocaust told you see notice i told you all this about yonker without even having to pull
[40:11.480 --> 40:18.640]  it up because i've read 500 books on nazi germany if i've read one and i see these six
[40:18.640 --> 40:23.000]  four snager loves hitler told rollingstone he loves hitler he wants to be a dictator he
[40:23.000 --> 40:29.680]  wants our guns he wants open borders he oh so the republicans worship him he would meet
[40:29.680 --> 40:36.560]  friends at the door in an ss uniform saying hyal hitler so he gets an adl award i fight
[40:36.560 --> 40:43.000]  nazis the adl lies about me because the adl in my research is is just the same brand of
[40:43.000 --> 40:48.160]  jews that sit on top the jews and feed on them generationally over and over again it's
[40:48.160 --> 40:53.760]  disgusting and then they have these articles oh alex hates jews oh yeah right there he
[40:53.760 --> 41:02.400]  is wearing a ss officer's belt but it's no big deal his dad was an ss officer in the
[41:02.400 --> 41:11.680]  gestapo oh that's right he wasn't he wasn't just in the armed ss or the commandos he was
[41:11.680 --> 41:20.960]  oh yeah there is a nazi naval belt but this just was his dad his dad his dad was so good
[41:20.960 --> 41:29.240]  he stayed behind in the war in austria to make sure everybody behaved themselves and
[41:29.240 --> 41:34.240]  then his older brother who died before him because he he was alive during the war arnold
[41:34.240 --> 41:38.760]  was born after the war for years died in a car wreck but he was the favorite he was the
[41:38.760 --> 41:45.720]  product of an approved ss marriage see i love how nazi this nazi that but the no one even
[41:45.720 --> 41:51.960]  really knows anything about it yes gustav sortzenegger here let's just go over all that
[41:51.960 --> 42:02.880]  for you now let's continue here let's hear though about the nazi now from from the forward
[42:02.880 --> 42:08.280]  the biggest jewish newspaper in the united states because media matters put an article
[42:08.280 --> 42:13.200]  out on me yesterday pro trump radio host alex jones rance that george soros is the head
[42:13.200 --> 42:17.560]  of the jewish mafia they then don't give all my quotes or all my comments where i said
[42:17.560 --> 42:23.440]  he was a nazi that fed on jews and rounded him up and then today has been caught in the
[42:23.440 --> 42:28.360]  wiki leaks trying to bring down israel and break it up that's in the wiki leaks so because
[42:28.360 --> 42:35.920]  i don't want to blow up israel and turn it over to the islamist i am now anti jew total
[42:35.920 --> 42:44.680]  inversion of reality they've made thousands of movies about nazi germany and then somehow
[42:44.680 --> 42:49.440]  projected the guilt onto the american people in hollywood but you've never seen a hollywood
[42:49.440 --> 42:55.960]  movie where they actually show you where all the really was happening with the nazis and
[42:55.960 --> 42:59.080]  what they're really up to and what's really happened but but i'm digressing i've got so
[42:59.080 --> 43:02.880]  much to cover but see i could do that with any one of these articles today i can give
[43:02.880 --> 43:07.960]  you a whole whole background on oh this guy says he'll break the us up he says he'll march
[43:07.960 --> 43:16.520]  troops into all these uu countries when his family marched into luxenburg and captured
[43:16.520 --> 43:21.720]  it in world war two and he was the head of it until four years ago when he got to the
[43:21.720 --> 43:33.520]  top slot of the unelected e you john claude yamper is a unelected dictator of the dictatorship
[43:33.520 --> 43:37.640]  that's the e you and ladies and gentlemen they have the communist chinese dictator who was
[43:37.640 --> 43:41.840]  elected by the central committee and bullet bureau show up at davos two months ago and
[43:41.840 --> 43:46.760]  say together the e you and china will lead the world and we will defeat trump and this
[43:46.760 --> 43:51.640]  nationalist populist movement every american should have gotten behind trump at that moment
[43:51.640 --> 43:57.720]  this is absolute organized crime declaration of war with the biggest crime lord in the
[43:57.720 --> 44:01.840]  history of the world the communist chinese openly announcing their working with zucker
[44:01.840 --> 44:05.960]  burg and everybody else to start censoring us zucker burg is now censoring any criticism
[44:05.960 --> 44:11.520]  of islam on facebook under orders by pakistan and helping report people who then have their
[44:11.520 --> 44:18.960]  heads chopped off in pakistan that was on the news yesterday you cannot make up the
[44:18.960 --> 44:25.080]  magnitude we got radical islam we got weirdo nazis running e you threatened to break us
[44:25.080 --> 44:30.800]  up we've got with their traders all in our government we've got crazy town going on and
[44:30.800 --> 44:36.960]  then we've got the media saying donald trump's a russian agent and he's being investigated
[44:36.960 --> 44:42.440]  and he might have to be overthrown and we might need c o g and you know just cancel congress
[44:42.440 --> 44:47.160]  for six months because it's it's all the republicans now they all came in on a fake election everybody
[44:47.160 --> 44:50.520]  else better get in line now a few republicans that say they want trump out office like these
[44:50.520 --> 44:56.000]  senators you can stay you're part of the club everybody else the american people don't like
[44:56.000 --> 45:02.280]  globalism don't like being sold out we're just going to cancel everything and they're
[45:02.280 --> 45:05.720]  trying to they're up at the edge of cliff oh yeah now the new york times says trumps
[45:05.720 --> 45:10.520]  a chinese agent that's right i forgot that one from yesterday they've now got themselves
[45:10.520 --> 45:18.400]  up to the edge of the cliff and they're thinking are we gonna jump we're gonna jump and they're
[45:18.400 --> 45:28.560]  kind of and they're led by a bunch of loons like nancy polosi and john claude yunker
[45:28.560 --> 45:34.960]  the war criminal nazi family of all families i mean there if there were nine ringwraiths
[45:34.960 --> 45:44.040]  and hitler was sauron the the the yunkers are like the witch king to use i like to use
[45:44.040 --> 45:47.120]  those allegories because they're good for what we're facing and of course he was in world
[45:47.120 --> 45:50.640]  war one i got that wrote that and so there's a lot of parallels to what's happened in european
[45:50.640 --> 45:54.200]  wars in the lord of the rings i don't like the cheesy movies but the books are good the
[45:54.200 --> 46:00.640]  point is is that this guy's literally the witch king of the lord of the rings i mean if there
[46:00.640 --> 46:06.600]  was nazgul he'd be the chief nazgul the number two guy i mean these families ladies and gentlemen
[46:06.600 --> 46:11.480]  joseph mingle is related to him look that up i remember that part that's the angel of
[46:11.480 --> 46:20.280]  death most what he did was classify brain transplants you name it and little kids i mean you name
[46:20.280 --> 46:28.600]  it and then sometimes for fun just in the morning he'd take like four or five little
[46:28.600 --> 46:33.600]  kids in the back of their big open top Mercedes out in the field and give them all chocolates
[46:33.600 --> 46:38.440]  and then pull his luger out and shoot them all in the head just just for just for a morning
[46:38.440 --> 46:44.320]  enjoyment these are really nice people and i get to have the jewish newspapers talk bad
[46:44.320 --> 46:51.200]  about me that nice good make up whatever crap you want i look at the san diego jewish
[46:51.200 --> 46:56.560]  world they look like a five year old girl wrote the article or is that in the forward
[46:56.560 --> 47:07.720]  here to sorry josephine dolstein looks like she's i mean she's like she's 12 years old
[47:07.720 --> 47:21.320]  i'm glad you're there to expose any semi sweetheart thank you and and and here's the deal this
[47:21.320 --> 47:31.760]  has come out in the news but see the media won't show you when she's about 14 right maybe
[47:31.760 --> 47:36.760]  12 my 13 year old daughter looks older than her i'm just saying this is the person that's
[47:36.760 --> 47:45.600]  writing articles basically trying to edit what i said to sound like i'm saying jewish
[47:45.600 --> 47:50.880]  mafia is running everything no no it's not that it's a jewish mafia running everything
[47:50.880 --> 47:56.040]  it's that there is a powerful jewish mafia that i've studied that more than any other
[47:56.040 --> 47:59.960]  mafia and all mafias feed on their own people and protecting them the jewish mafia has
[47:59.960 --> 48:06.880]  a horrible history especially in europe of making jews pay to get out and then double
[48:06.880 --> 48:11.800]  crossing them on top of it and it was a million equivalent of a million dollars us dollars
[48:11.800 --> 48:19.920]  at that time again my grandfather grew up in a wealthy area in a mainly kind of jewish
[48:19.920 --> 48:28.000]  german enclave in in dallas and he again there was a guy had a factory but he had his tinkering
[48:28.000 --> 48:32.040]  shop that was a factory down the road and and my grandfather sometimes a little kid
[48:32.040 --> 48:38.200]  worked over there he was german he wasn't jewish the guy down the street and he was a famous
[48:38.200 --> 48:41.600]  guy my grandfather told the story a couple times who had invented a lot of the modern
[48:41.600 --> 48:46.760]  refrigeration you see so he's very very rich but he had family still in germany and still
[48:46.760 --> 48:51.200]  spoke with a german accent you know my grandfather was several generations you know back germans
[48:51.200 --> 48:54.440]  that had come over but even back then germans kind of lived in their own area sometimes
[48:54.440 --> 49:01.160]  you know that's the way it is in big cities but the point is is that he watched all his
[49:01.160 --> 49:06.000]  companies get sold and everything gone well my grandfather was off in world war two and
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.440]  he came back and everything had been taken from the guy because the nazis had so many
[49:10.440 --> 49:16.320]  agents in south united states they were threatening to kill his family in germany if he didn't
[49:16.320 --> 49:22.680]  give him all his money that's why my grandfather hated nazis so much and then there were so
[49:22.680 --> 49:28.240]  many nazis and i remember my mom because it wasn't known that they brought over 36 thousand
[49:28.240 --> 49:36.320]  plus nazis just just 36 thousand nazi scientists in the rat line for nasa and you know so many
[49:36.320 --> 49:41.240]  other places and my grandfather was a lee sound and so he would drive around all over
[49:41.240 --> 49:45.200]  new mexico all over texas and the only places to get food sometimes are gas will be military
[49:45.200 --> 49:48.960]  bases and he would just talk about and he was you know part german so he was proud to be
[49:48.960 --> 49:53.960]  part german proud of his ancestry but he would get so mad at the arrogant nazis all just
[49:53.960 --> 49:58.400]  sitting around inside the military bases shooting their mouths off and he told me a couple stories
[49:58.400 --> 50:08.920]  but i'm just going to leave it at that let's just say there were some fights but the point
[50:08.920 --> 50:17.960]  is that i know all about this and it really is disgusting what the sellout media whether
[50:17.960 --> 50:21.840]  it's whether it's you know the jewish press and all this that always attacks people that
[50:21.840 --> 50:27.040]  expose this and i i just have to ask before we're gonna everybody else what the hell man
[50:27.040 --> 50:31.520]  i mean are you really want to be complicit in in in covering up the stuff that's going
[50:31.520 --> 50:36.640]  on when you know when any jews i talk to that are educated know all about this most
[50:36.640 --> 50:43.440]  issues i know are pissed off about this take steve pacinic he's jewish he's beef he hates
[50:43.440 --> 50:46.640]  he hates it they'll talk about it they'll tell you all about it and he actually had
[50:46.640 --> 50:52.120]  family that didn't make it out of europe roosevelt wouldn't it's just a whole other story we'll
[50:52.120 --> 50:55.560]  be back with other news though but there's the truth about who wants to break up america
[50:55.560 --> 51:03.240]  a filthy rich scumbag nazi they say you can't take on the man and win that one small company
[51:03.240 --> 51:07.280]  doesn't stand a chance against the corporate behemoths with all their money and lawyers

[54:20.600 --> 54:23.560]  i walked and i went you know the yunkers are one of the most powerful families in germany
[54:23.560 --> 54:33.020]  top three they created mind war mind control they basically hijacked luxembourg i said
[54:33.020 --> 54:39.920]  look that up and then you look it up and it's worse than i said i mean you study the people
[54:39.920 --> 54:43.600]  at bill der berg it'll make your mouth hang open they'll usually have a few people there
[54:43.600 --> 54:47.200]  that they're grooming to be president to see if they're gonna play ball rick perry went
[54:47.200 --> 54:50.880]  they didn't like him i'm not saying perry's perfect but they didn't like him uh peter
[54:50.880 --> 54:54.440]  teal's gone but he's doing a lot of goods if you judge a tree by its fruits but the
[54:54.440 --> 55:01.600]  old guys that set it up it was the nazi families left over from world war two in a true armistice
[55:01.600 --> 55:08.840]  meeting that they began to have in 1945 it didn't officially get a name till 1954 nine
[55:08.840 --> 55:16.160]  years later in usterbeck holland at the bill der berg hotel and see they hope you're not
[55:16.160 --> 55:21.560]  informed i'm informed i'm not bragging i'm on target i have their whole plan so this
[55:21.560 --> 55:28.080]  isn't a nazi conspiracy it's like hydra and again they put that in movies it shows how
[55:28.080 --> 55:34.280]  this is known that's what's so frustrating look at how the mainly uh jewish comic book
[55:34.280 --> 55:40.360]  writers create hydra and all this and it's dead on shadow underground eugenics style
[55:40.360 --> 55:45.960]  government because the jews have been assaulted by this i'm telling you anybody who's informed
[55:45.960 --> 55:50.760]  knows about this i'm not like making up some new cosmology here this is real then they
[55:50.760 --> 55:54.440]  turned into red skull and all this stuff and it becomes a joke and then they have the forward
[55:54.440 --> 55:59.680]  come out and attack me because i'm warning everybody about this i don't like george
[55:59.680 --> 56:03.880]  soros the nazi collaborator that rounded up thousands of jews and robbed them to their
[56:03.880 --> 56:08.560]  deaths that's he went on 60 minutes and said he's not ashamed of that because he survived
[56:08.560 --> 56:19.040]  a greedy monster and then the alchemy is he's good give him 80 yellow wards alex jones is
[56:19.040 --> 56:25.320]  anti-semitic and i don't even run from that i don't sit there and say i'm not because
[56:25.320 --> 56:30.320]  i want to carry favor with the dying msm and all the traders to humanity they're involved
[56:30.320 --> 56:36.280]  in it and hollywood and just all the the pedophilia and just evil people whether they're german

[56:54.600 --> 57:01.400]  globalist empire test of the groups operating in europe operating in england operating in
[57:01.400 --> 57:08.120]  the u.s in the 1850s the british royalty launched their mind war and eugenics programs to counter
[57:08.120 --> 57:12.200]  their german cousins because they were german they were related to the youngers and others
[57:12.200 --> 57:21.000]  they knew the british royalties german has been since uh george the first we defeated
[57:21.000 --> 57:27.120]  george the third and so they accelerated their mind war program to counter the germans because
[57:27.120 --> 57:31.320]  they were cousins but they were fighting with each other literal cousins i got a plug

[1:00:42.760 --> 1:00:49.440]  air of the great nazi fortunes and great stolen hordes they took the luxenberg the biggest
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:56.280]  money laundering operation on the planet he says he'll break up the united states using
[1:00:56.280 --> 1:01:00.480]  political forces and of course turkey says they'll break up the e you or have their islamists
[1:01:00.480 --> 1:01:04.320]  burn everything down if the e you doesn't capitulate to them i love how it's all these
[1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:11.040]  different thug groups and criminal groups threatening each other and you know when i
[1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:16.000]  say turkey threatened quote holy war to overthrow europe if they don't let more muslims in which
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  is why would you do that they're they're holding you hostage already it's not going to get
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:26.440]  better or that yulker has come out in a speech saying we'll break up the united states meddling
[1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:34.240]  in our internal affairs it sounds like a lie when i say it but it's it's the top of drudge
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:40.640]  it's it's it's officially released by him of course i already knew this was all happening
[1:01:40.640 --> 1:01:46.600]  but you see that's why they got to bring down in fours because everything we've talked
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:52.680]  about that was under the the waves submerged is now emerging it was always there and people
[1:01:52.680 --> 1:01:57.400]  are like it's exactly what he said word for word coming up out of the water well how do
[1:01:57.400 --> 1:02:03.320]  he did he have x-ray vision no the globalist think you're stupid and they write white papers
[1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:09.520]  to themselves and then they write stuff for the public for the public will have some narcissistic
[1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:13.880]  part up there you know doing selfies with blown up ugly you know lips with a bunch of
[1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:18.480]  injections and they'll have some idiot sports team running around with guys slapping each
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:22.520]  other on the butts and then they'll you know they'll have some other stupid diversions or
[1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:31.040]  nostradamus crap and then meanwhile the EU was set up oh i forgot to see that's the problem
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:35.200]  with the history lesson that's how my memory works i'm like yulker yulker i know he's the
[1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:39.640]  head of the uu used to be the head of luxembourg i know he's nobility out of germany and and
[1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:46.120]  alcession and then yeah sure enough alcession on one side top advisor to hitler his wife's
[1:02:46.120 --> 1:02:51.720]  father of his family the the richest probably the second or third richest germans german
[1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:58.840]  royalty the heads of prussia the prussian royal family the the military state of germany
[1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:05.480]  was prussia that's what they did everything you saw pour out in world war one and pour
[1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:13.320]  out in world war two came right out of that mouth
[1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:21.200]  and then they capture all this and then it just hit me it's undebatable that the EU
[1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:26.960]  was a nazi project that they had planned once they had everybody capitulate and then they
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:32.440]  were going to depopulate everywhere else with uh vaccines that that that that had delayed
[1:03:32.440 --> 1:03:39.240]  kill edam by the way folks i didn't read hundreds of books on on world war two because i was
[1:03:39.240 --> 1:03:44.160]  even into the nazis people say oh you must like the nazis no no no it was so interesting
[1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:48.360]  once you read one you had to read another and then the footnotes and the facts and all
[1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:54.080]  the and all the mind war and atomic weapons races and all the craziness that went on behind

[1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:45.040]  but he certainly knows what he's talking about is predicted so much of what's happening if

[1:09:15.480 --> 1:09:20.280]  e you bureaucracy appointed him the head of the commission that rules of the ceremonial
[1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:24.040]  elected parliament and he said we'll come in with our politicos and break up america
[1:09:24.040 --> 1:09:28.320]  now you can laugh at that i do it certain levels there's the problem they're working
[1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:32.440]  with the big banks that are trying to kill the trump recovery and putting out all this
[1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:36.200]  incredibly negative news that you know the economy's going to implode because trumps
[1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:40.440]  going to go to jail and he's a russian agent when we have these open globalist agents and
[1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:50.880]  literally this guy's whole family from the research were top nazis his dad ultra rich

[1:09:56.480 --> 1:10:04.640]  model that in ruins 88 this 88 that i mean it's it's it's nazi royalty as you had to
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:16.920]  say who are the heirs of the nazis you you would say john claude yunker tied into family
[1:10:16.920 --> 1:10:30.200]  ties to the angel of death joseph mingela and then his wife her father was hitler's
[1:10:30.200 --> 1:10:37.360]  right hand man they'll look it up we just covered it last hour so you have the literal
[1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:48.080]  unelected son of the top royal nazi line above the law diplomatic immunity royalty didn't
[1:10:48.080 --> 1:10:54.320]  touch him but they ruled prussia for hundreds of years germania was a bunch of little substates
[1:10:54.320 --> 1:10:58.240]  under catholic rule then became the austrian hungarian empire studied the history but
[1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:05.260]  it was all ruled out of germany and the military technology and systems and psychiatry and
[1:11:05.260 --> 1:11:18.560]  mind war and everything you just can't make this up and so he is a dictator with a chinese
[1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:23.920]  dictator at davos on the same stage saying we'll stop donald trump do americans have
[1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:28.680]  any instincts any nationalism they don't want us to have an economy they want us sold out
[1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:38.600]  they want us controlled that's some of the news up on info wars dot com right now the
[1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:44.040]  reason i went off on this today was obviously he made those statements but expanding on
[1:11:44.040 --> 1:11:51.720]  that i pointed out that george soros was a nazi collaborator actually helped go around
[1:11:51.720 --> 1:11:55.400]  and betray and round up his fellow jews of the thousands and says he's not sad for it
[1:11:55.400 --> 1:12:02.600]  sorry for it on a 60 minutes interview and so he's worshiped by the adl you gotta ask
[1:12:02.600 --> 1:12:07.280]  who is the adl when they give him awards the same craziness and they don't stop there
[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:14.400]  if you're new listener hearing this i'm not joking just search engine 60 minutes george
[1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:21.400]  soros is proud of using nazis to survive as he put it so i point out that if there's
[1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:26.960]  this jewish mafia that worked with the nazis to oppress jews and rob them of their money
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:31.880]  and the forward comes out the biggest jewish newspaper and attacks me basically saying
[1:12:31.880 --> 1:12:39.720]  it's anti-semitic there you go folks hack soros emails reveal plans to fight israel's
[1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:45.560]  racist policies and end the jewish state jerusalem post so see if you want to end israel
[1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:51.800]  you're get awards from the adl but if you actually aren't anti-semitic then you get called in
[1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:55.680]  a semi george soros criticized by pro-israel groups as conspiracy theorists sees on open
[1:12:55.680 --> 1:13:00.320]  society foundation link oh we're conspiracy theorists because we can read where he says
[1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:06.280]  get rid of israel oh and then muslims have been saying they want to turn england into
[1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:13.320]  an islamic country and we played a clip off singing him or they were saying that and then
[1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:18.880]  the daily beast comes out and inverse reality and says alex relax nobody's going to take
[1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:25.280]  over england when the muslims all over the world say that's their their aim and their
[1:13:25.280 --> 1:13:30.680]  goal and they're announcing that and we were playing chance of them saying get out of england
[1:13:30.680 --> 1:13:34.600]  it's ours now we've played all those videos of it that this is happening and they act
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:42.680]  like it's crazy and it's not happening says keep calm alex jones the queen is not being
[1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:49.160]  pressured to convert to islam and then they made joke memes showing prince charles saying
[1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:54.240]  he converted to islam in saudi arabia and being made an honorary member of the royal
[1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:58.960]  family over there in fact i forgot that research engine prince charles in islamic attire or
[1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:04.800]  saudi arabian garb they set up saudi arabia they're the ones driving radical islam all
[1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:08.960]  the world to conquer things of course they've let it in it's just a little authoritarian
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:15.240]  attack dog but again i'm cursed with knowing history so i guess i should be calm because
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:19.640]  the queen's got it all in hand doesn't she after all she's another transylvanian fake
[1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:29.520]  german fake brit like the yunkers there's prince charles in his islamic garb his saudi
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:37.320]  arabian garb and has been inducted into the saudi royal family so he's just a member
[1:14:37.320 --> 1:14:42.880]  of the saudi royal family no big deal i'm a complete cook there's no connection british
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:50.080]  intelligence created saudi arabia on record created it and then had them invade turkey
[1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:52.760]  again oh but the muslims aren't going to take over we're going to skip a break so you have
[1:14:52.760 --> 1:14:58.160]  more time with rolls the muslims aren't taking over anywhere haha urgun last week not once
[1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:03.360]  but twice and then his foreign minister threatened europe with quote a jihad holy war burning
[1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:07.200]  down their cities if they don't do whatever they say that means open the border up and
[1:15:07.200 --> 1:15:10.240]  give them more money we'll flood you and burn everything down if you don't want more of
[1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:14.160]  a sin and then let put everybody on welfare and let them send their money back to turkey
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:23.120]  because the muslims never take over anywhere they just took over the eastern holy roman
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:29.440]  empire that was the bizantine empire it was called constantanople it's now has another
[1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:37.920]  name these are fax fax fax fax fax but they call being informed hell having a doctorate
[1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:41.160]  in history they probably call that a conspiracy theory being in knowing how to read and write
[1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:45.800]  to conspiracy theory show here's the bottom line we're going to get into the whole fake
[1:15:45.800 --> 1:15:51.520]  russian investigation republicans piling on the massive cutting off of people being able
[1:15:51.520 --> 1:15:57.040]  to advertise on google the open calls the censors soros's disinfo the republicans did
[1:15:57.040 --> 1:16:01.200]  not vote to repeal web browsing laws the democrats i looked it up we're just saying
[1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:05.440]  that it's a soros line just like they said that oh they're ending net neutrality no they
[1:16:05.440 --> 1:16:11.880]  called net neutrality the fcc and the fbc taking over free speech okay they said well
[1:16:11.880 --> 1:16:18.000]  ban alex jones will ban that rudge they stated that so they spin the republicans reversing
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:27.880]  this as a takeover so it's all branding that's why the pro info wars pro drudge fcc members
[1:16:27.880 --> 1:16:32.480]  left and he said things are a lot better now i can move on to private industry they oh my

[1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:12.640]  course is James Wesley Rawls bestselling author researcher one of the top survival sites out
[1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:18.800]  there survivalblog.com probably the biggest former army intelligence a lot of folks even
[1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:23.640]  currently in the government you know tell me this is really a dead on guy but I've been
[1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:26.600]  saying that for like 15 16 years or maybe 20 years he's been on I don't know he's been
[1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:32.880]  on forever but he really he helped popularize the liberty movement and novels he's been
[1:18:32.880 --> 1:18:38.880]  writing for what 2526 years and James Wesley Rawls survivalblog.com joining us from an
[1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:43.320]  undisclosed location and you kind of heard me set the table here but I don't want to
[1:18:43.320 --> 1:18:46.440]  just sit here like a chihuahua barking saying we're under attack somebody's breaking in
[1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:52.000]  the front door but I am now don't talk about myself but we have to why are they so scared
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:56.440]  of infowords because we research their own documents we have guests on like Mr. Rawls
[1:18:56.440 --> 1:19:00.240]  we have this brain trust they know the military's listening they know the CIA's listening they
[1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:05.080]  know that all of the world we're exposing their program and so I don't want other people
[1:19:05.080 --> 1:19:08.840]  to go oh you're so wonderful other people to research what we've said and then do your
[1:19:08.840 --> 1:19:13.680]  own research and then put out your own variant of what we're doing I want competition I want
[1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:19.400]  to be made obsolete because that's when I'm safe for my children and myself I'm totally
[1:19:19.400 --> 1:19:25.920]  mission driven but we must get this out but we must also tell you alpha base is under
[1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:30.720]  attack folks this this is the alpha base this is the main resistance I never do this would
[1:19:30.720 --> 1:19:34.480]  happen I didn't want this to happen I don't want to be charging in ticking the door down
[1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:38.640]  first every time believe me I'm not you know but as a man I've got to do this and I'm here
[1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:43.440]  to tell you the only person attacked more than Donald Trump is Alex Jones now and I'm proud
[1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:47.920]  of that at a certain level but I don't like that mantle and so selfishly I want to ask
[1:19:47.920 --> 1:19:52.920]  you what do you make of what's going on the attacks everywhere the move to crack down the
[1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:58.840]  blustering by the globalist the attempt to implode the markets which is their real power
[1:19:58.840 --> 1:20:02.160]  the arrogance that they're the ones trying to implode it but they think they'll get away
[1:20:02.160 --> 1:20:07.520]  with it and blame it on Trump I mean they are so criminal and so reckless and so foaming
[1:20:07.520 --> 1:20:11.720]  at the mouth right now James Leslie Rawls let's look at big picture and then and then
[1:20:11.720 --> 1:20:16.680]  what is it in full wars is doing that makes them so angry that's key not to say oh look
[1:20:16.680 --> 1:20:20.960]  we're the biggest swing and you know what it's about what are we doing that has them
[1:20:20.960 --> 1:20:27.200]  shaking in their boots James Leslie Rawls well Alex I think that the truth is what really
[1:20:27.200 --> 1:20:34.240]  has them scared and it's people like you who are champions of the truth that are striking
[1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:39.760]  absolute fear in their hearts because once the truth comes out as to what they really
[1:20:39.760 --> 1:20:47.320]  have planned and how they are conspiring against the Trump administration and against the Liberty
[1:20:47.320 --> 1:20:55.560]  movement in general and against bloggers and journalists and video bloggers in particular
[1:20:55.560 --> 1:21:03.680]  then they're going to lose all credibility and they will lose the information war that's
[1:21:03.680 --> 1:21:09.040]  where they stand what's that that's what they stand to lose right now and they're in absolute
[1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:13.480]  panic mode let me ask you this question I was in the army I was a big critic of the army
[1:21:13.480 --> 1:21:18.840]  being for martial law drills with Obama and others before him like Clinton and the media
[1:21:18.840 --> 1:21:22.360]  would always sell that I was just anti-military course I was and I was anti an unconstitutional
[1:21:22.360 --> 1:21:26.120]  mission but the Marines are great the Navy is doing great stuff other folks doing things
[1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:29.400]  but I never see the Air Force I love the Air Force I never see the Air Force politically
[1:21:29.400 --> 1:21:35.720]  doing anything the army I know is the first thing found in America July 4 1776 the Commission
[1:21:35.720 --> 1:21:40.400]  George Washington but the army's done so many horrible things obviously under global control
[1:21:40.400 --> 1:21:44.600]  maybe that's why they're so awake but it's the army everywhere behind the scenes blocking
[1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:47.640]  the new world order right now I know you've got a lot of connections to that at least
[1:21:47.640 --> 1:21:52.560]  in the past did you concur with that and why is that the case yes in fact a lot of the
[1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:59.680]  people that were in my year group when I was commissioned are now colonels and even Brigadier
[1:21:59.680 --> 1:22:07.280]  generals and what I'm hearing from them is that they they are not going along with the
[1:22:07.280 --> 1:22:16.120]  program they are they've recognized what's going on they're awake they're alert and they're
[1:22:16.120 --> 1:22:22.320]  not going to put up with martial law they're not going to just passively go along and say
[1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:29.320]  oh well we're just obeying orders these are intelligent articulate people who see the
[1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:35.680]  big picture and they are ready to stand in the gap if that happens if there's orders
[1:22:35.680 --> 1:22:40.360]  for martial law and it's not a constitutional order they're going to be the very first to
[1:22:40.360 --> 1:22:47.560]  say I'm sorry I'm not going to obey that order I'm not saying this for bluster for David
[1:22:47.560 --> 1:22:53.400]  Brock who I know works for the Democrats openly and Soros but it's crazy it's it's not I would
[1:22:53.400 --> 1:23:00.680]  say the entire combat arms and the fourth branch the military the CIA now almost everyone's
[1:23:00.680 --> 1:23:06.160]  anti-globalist and the words come down from the CIA the generals everybody they try to
[1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:11.760]  kill Trump or move for martial law everybody wipe them out and I'm not and the point is
[1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:16.920]  these are all people like people like Tonto the hero of 13 hours I mean he's on here without
[1:23:16.920 --> 1:23:20.400]  me asking to say it I'm ready they try it I'm coming and they come after you I'm coming
[1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:24.040]  for them these aren't people playing games I don't think the globalist realize what they've
[1:23:24.040 --> 1:23:30.000]  set off here right and they're up against people who are very well trained they understand
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:37.240]  both strategy and tactics and when it comes you know when push comes to shove they're
[1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:42.600]  going to I think stand on the right side of this equation and the globalists have every
[1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:48.640]  reason to be scared because they're not they're not going to stand up to that now the officer
[1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:53.800]  core in the United States military has traditionally been very apolitical and in fact the whole
[1:23:53.800 --> 1:24:01.240]  military is structured to de-emphasize politics you know I don't I'm not saying that there's
[1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:06.280]  going to be a seven days in May type scenario but sure the point is that it's so clear we're
[1:24:06.280 --> 1:24:10.640]  being taken over by foreign powers it's cut and dry sorry go ahead I was just going to
[1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:21.120]  say if if there's a coup on the part of folks inside the Beltway I don't preclude the notion
[1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:26.840]  of a counter coup coming from within the United States military and I think it'll start first
[1:24:26.840 --> 1:24:37.560]  not at the Pentagon but at the at the divisional and lower levels of them of the US military
[1:24:37.560 --> 1:24:43.640]  in the combat arms in combat support and combat service support there's going to be a counter
[1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:51.920]  coup that will be unstoppable because let's face it they cannot institute martial law unless
[1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:59.000]  people at field grade and company grade go along with it and by the way by the way I'm
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:02.080]  sad we have to talk like this now this is not something I've done in 20 years on air
[1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:06.360]  but we're having to now in 22 years on air because I'm sure you've seen James they're
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:10.760]  all over the elite publication saying they're intending to organize a coup against Trump
[1:25:10.760 --> 1:25:14.880]  physical of need be and they're not going to let him testify defend himself so I think
[1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:18.320]  clearly they'll kill him tell me if you think I'm wrong they try a coup he's going to quote
[1:25:18.320 --> 1:25:23.280]  get killed in the fighting or you know whatever but pray that doesn't happen but they are
[1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:28.720]  now saying you COG bring in the shadow government remove all the Republicans in Congress basically
[1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:33.400]  except for a few that go along with it and this is in the Atlantic monthly this is an
[1:25:33.400 --> 1:25:37.680]  elite publications they are green lighting this when they when they start promoting
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:42.120]  something in public folks that means they're like trying to normalize it for all the people
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:45.960]  that have cold feet and I'm telling people that have cold feet on this you better have
[1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:51.800]  cold feet because I'm all in and so are the Patriots and I'd say 80% chance you get your
[1:25:51.800 --> 1:25:55.160]  asses handed to you big time and quickly and then the gloves are off and I don't want this
[1:25:55.160 --> 1:26:00.000]  to happen I know behind the scenes Trump gave them a chance like Napoleon into abstentia
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:07.440]  you know you know and you know being sent off into you know an island or whatever they
[1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:10.720]  gave the globalist a chance just to stop it he said you're going to even richer under
[1:26:10.720 --> 1:26:14.800]  a good economy Goldman Sachs has made his biggest profits ever the last few months just off
[1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:18.760]  the recovery just stop it and Trump can't believe how evil they are they just know they're
[1:26:18.760 --> 1:26:22.480]  not and they want to kill him they're trying to organize it and I'm not wanting some you
[1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:27.840]  know fascist uprising like the film you mentioned or anything they're organizing a criminal action
[1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:32.360]  in front of us they're not trying to do it to precipitate us to do something I've looked
[1:26:32.360 --> 1:26:35.720]  at it James they're doing it because they really mean to do it they are really that
[1:26:35.720 --> 1:26:43.080]  crazy I think you're right Alex they the the level of commitment on the side of the globalist
[1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:52.040]  is so strong now that they're willing to risk it all to see their end game played out but
[1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:56.600]  the American citizenry and as I mentioned before the officer corps within the United
[1:26:56.600 --> 1:27:02.040]  States Army and the United States Marine Corps is not going to put up with it it's just not
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:04.680]  going to the Marines have stood up as well and I guess they're a lot smaller that's why
[1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:08.360]  the army I see most of from the army what's going on in the other branches I don't a little
[1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:11.920]  bit from the Navy nothing from the Air Force and it was an Air Force intelligence officer
[1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:15.920]  who was retired of deputy fire chiefs that helped me get set up and help and you advise
[1:27:15.920 --> 1:27:19.720]  me on some basic things so I guess you could say in force kind of got started by a former
[1:27:19.720 --> 1:27:25.600]  intelligence officer in the Air Force he helped Dick Vreeland but well it's important to remember
[1:27:25.600 --> 1:27:32.040]  that that the United States has traditionally been a naval power not a land-based army power
[1:27:32.040 --> 1:27:38.160]  our our greatest strength was back when we had a 600 ship Navy we're still a very powerful
[1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:43.040]  naval power and the other thing that's really important to consider is it's the Navy and
[1:27:43.040 --> 1:27:49.360]  the Air Force Air Force that hold the strategic weapons the nuclear weapons and that really
[1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:56.680]  is is the real inch pin because if things completely come unglued and we have a situation
[1:27:56.680 --> 1:28:05.960]  where a a usurper administration comes into office and they try to use nuclear weapons
[1:28:05.960 --> 1:28:10.760]  in a provocation I don't think they're going to have the cooperation of the Navy well that's
[1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:15.600]  my question I've seen more action from the Army and Marines from your intel where is
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:21.480]  the Navy where is the Air Force from what I've heard and granted I was an Army officer
[1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:28.600]  I wasn't in either of those services but from what I've heard from within I have a couple
[1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:34.760]  of sources inside the Pentagon the Navy and Air Force general officers aren't going along
[1:28:34.760 --> 1:28:41.880]  with this either they're you know they're they're wondering how far they're going to
[1:28:41.880 --> 1:28:51.800]  push how hard they're going to push before they'll be pushed back and at this point they
[1:28:51.800 --> 1:28:59.360]  I think there's some some very quiet maneuvering going on and alignment within the Pentagon
[1:28:59.360 --> 1:29:07.240]  and at the lower level at the core level and divisional level within the Army and in the
[1:29:07.240 --> 1:29:15.560]  major commands within the Navy and Air Force those general officers are basically lining
[1:29:15.560 --> 1:29:22.560]  up one way or the other and I tell you the vast majority of them are in favor of restoration
[1:29:22.560 --> 1:29:27.320]  constitutional government not continuity of bad government that's right James Leslie
[1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:32.640]  Rawls is our guest you see Trump folks was a response to the globalist final takeover
[1:29:32.640 --> 1:29:38.280]  of America it wasn't even Trump taking America over it was a desperate attempt to stop this
[1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:49.080]  takeover and now we're in the main battle they'll be back with James Leslie Rawls
[1:29:49.080 --> 1:30:00.080]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:30:00.080 --> 1:30:04.120]  this is Owen shroyer for info wars dot com and I have had it with this Russia and Trump
[1:30:04.120 --> 1:30:08.260]  investigation we already know Democrats are up to their eyeballs and Russian connections
[1:30:08.260 --> 1:30:13.240]  with John Podesta stock deals and Hillary Clinton uranium for cash deals why are we investigating
[1:30:13.240 --> 1:30:19.440]  Trump we have American citizens homeless veterans senior citizens who need our help nope let's
[1:30:19.440 --> 1:30:24.640]  spend months on Russia we have Democrats on the hill crying Russian Russian Russian while
[1:30:24.640 --> 1:30:30.640]  ISIS is at the border screaming Russian Russian Russian how about the fact it was our influence
[1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:34.440]  on the geopolitics of the entire world that created these terrorist groups in the first
[1:30:34.440 --> 1:30:39.360]  place no investigation into that no cries of US influence on foreign elections keep in
[1:30:39.360 --> 1:30:44.400]  mind the WikiLeaks emails they continue to cite are verified and admitted to be real
[1:30:44.400 --> 1:30:49.640]  that would make it you Democrats who cost Hillary the election not Russia and by the
[1:30:49.640 --> 1:30:54.560]  way most of us were voting Trump before Maxine waters could even find Russia on a map it's
[1:30:54.560 --> 1:31:00.880]  up to us the US people to drain the swamp in all upcoming elections hey everyone pharmacist

[1:33:26.800 --> 1:33:36.160]  you know matt drudge is super smart i don't think anybody needs to be told that to know
[1:33:36.160 --> 1:33:42.280]  that but i had such frustration with ran paul when we supported him for the senate and
[1:33:42.280 --> 1:33:47.840]  they had people in kkk outfits trying to pose as his supporters and all sorts of dis info
[1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:55.440]  paul stood up against it boldly he won because he was anti-establishment anti-globalist and
[1:33:55.440 --> 1:34:04.200]  then he just kind of went sideways good policies but just kind of sideways the last couple
[1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:09.560]  years and kind of tried to carry to the mainstream media but now that he's come out and tried
[1:34:09.560 --> 1:34:15.840]  to shoot down this health care reform great job now that he is just getting so hardcore
[1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:21.640]  on so many issues it is very exciting to see his star rising again very very quickly because
[1:34:21.640 --> 1:34:30.280]  it it would have been ran paul in office right now folks if he wouldn't have kind of turned
[1:34:30.280 --> 1:34:36.480]  his back on the tea party and drunk the kool-aid that he was a big us senator he never sold
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:44.120]  out on issues he just as a doctor and you know as somebody growing up in texas and then
[1:34:44.120 --> 1:34:50.440]  kentucky southerners kind of tend to sometimes if they're not all acting like a crazy gorilla
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:56.320]  like i do kind of become the gentile gentleman all those like like walter jones a really great
[1:34:56.320 --> 1:35:01.640]  guy incredible courage he's just so polite and so nice it just he gets stuff done but
[1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:13.040]  it just you need some fireworks and i love jones he's just such a gentleman
[1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:16.920]  people people want people want down in the mud they want bare knuckles they want donald
[1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:23.200]  trump but with the brain of ran paul on policy because ran paul can run circles around people
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:27.480]  he actually goes like a doctor and studies hours a day everything just i mean his dad's
[1:35:27.480 --> 1:35:32.840]  the same way he'll be it's almost kind of ocd the pauls are just constantly reading
[1:35:32.840 --> 1:35:39.080]  i wanted to know stuff and reading textbooks and everything else drudge sees that these
[1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:45.880]  guys are doctors folks that come from hard working farmer stock we share a strong mutual
[1:35:45.880 --> 1:35:50.200]  admiration ran paul details meeting with matt drudge in washington business insider it's
[1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:55.720]  up on info wars dot com just remember everything we're doing they're trying to block everything
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:36:00.320]  we're saying they're trying to block it is an act of defiance against the globalists
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:06.960]  when you post our videos send out links when you on your phone turn on your notifications
[1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:11.460]  so that you get our youtube videos because what they do is they don't outright ban us

[1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:25.440]  just go in and turn your notification off and we've learned they're doing it every week

[1:36:31.160 --> 1:36:38.480]  and they admit they are so they're quietly trying to strangle us get our oxygen level
[1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:43.600]  down before they finally cut our head off and believe me they they're attacking us all
[1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:48.000]  point to the compass right now our fight is your fight and that's not some rhetoric that's

[1:37:45.360 --> 1:37:48.080]  than spraying some lighter fluid on the ground and trying to light it or whatever you take

[1:40:31.320 --> 1:40:38.600]  how bad it is not trying to be negative we've got major beachheads the enemy is demoralized
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:42.680]  but they're they're so desperate they're trying to blow the economy to make trump look bad
[1:40:42.680 --> 1:40:47.760]  admitting it they've got john claude yonker the super nazi air that was the base of the
[1:40:47.760 --> 1:40:51.720]  king of luxembourg that they hijacked world war two you're like where's the nazi wealth
[1:40:51.720 --> 1:40:59.480]  right there that means you can't make this up he thinks he's better than us and he's
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:05.040]  so arrogant he threatened trump a real german not a transylvanian like yonker nothing against
[1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:12.880]  hungarians and romanians but man stop posing as germans and stop posing as as as bretts
[1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:18.200]  i'm sick of it look at donald trump that's what a german looks like it doesn't look like
[1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:27.560]  yonker you want to know what a place the wealth looks like go to go to go to go to go to wales
[1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:31.720]  people look like me i'm just so sick of the fact that they even blame germans the nazis
[1:41:31.720 --> 1:41:35.560]  were a bunch of transylvanian trash folks and that's where they get the legends of all that
[1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:39.480]  crap because they're a bunch of filth because they picked up all these lomit garbage during
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:44.280]  those wars beating the muslims for hundreds of years they turned into it let's go back
[1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:47.920]  and look at yonker and then i'm going to our guest look at yonker and then look at prince
[1:41:47.920 --> 1:41:54.840]  charles and then look at vlad paintings of count dracula they all are the same genetic
[1:41:54.840 --> 1:42:04.120]  type because they're all related let's look up count dracula
[1:42:04.120 --> 1:42:09.000]  absolutely as vlad the impaler which is also count dracula it's the same guy count dracula
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:14.920]  is a bram stroker fictionalized deal but based on a real guy he didn't really live for everybody
[1:42:14.920 --> 1:42:21.000]  did drink blood so the point is is that now prince charles is directly related to him and
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:24.920]  he hails that as his original bloodline and lives there part of the year in count dracula's
[1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:29.120]  castle with google that prince charles has moved to again if you're new listeners that
[1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:32.000]  sounds completely insane let me go back to our guest i apologize i'm running over but
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:35.760]  he is here for commentary he can even go to the next hour with us if he wants james leslie
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:40.640]  ralls i'm ranting here i just want folks to know this is the enemy this is the threat
[1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:45.880]  this is what we're facing i don't make this stuff up this is out of their mouths go ahead
[1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:51.560]  just a magnitude of where we are if we don't get this out if we don't expose this they're
[1:42:51.560 --> 1:42:55.600]  just going to promote it to their people with no opposition i mean i don't know how trumps
[1:42:55.600 --> 1:43:00.920]  i don't know how the fbi who knows controlled is even allowing people like the former deputy
[1:43:00.920 --> 1:43:05.000]  defense secretary to try to organize the military overthrow of the president that's in the newspaper
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:10.840]  go ahead well i think you're right we do need to get the word out and at this point at this
[1:43:10.840 --> 1:43:19.440]  stage of the information war the powers that be are doing their very best to silence bloggers
[1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:30.200]  video bloggers talk show hosts people like you they want to shut us down and they started
[1:43:30.200 --> 1:43:41.040]  out with the whole fake fake fake news campaign where they are basically ignoring their own
[1:43:41.040 --> 1:43:48.540]  fake news and trying to make anyone in the alternative media out to look like fake news
[1:43:48.540 --> 1:43:54.440]  and then once they've identified who they consider to be fake news then they went on
[1:43:54.440 --> 1:44:02.960]  a campaign of trying to first discredit and demonetize all alternative media and i think
[1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:10.760]  their end game is going to be an attempt to actually pull the plug on alternative media
[1:44:10.760 --> 1:44:17.640]  outlets like facebook and youtube have already been playing all kinds of games with stopping
[1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:30.040]  feeds with demonetizing with requiring people to sign a statement that they're you need
[1:44:30.040 --> 1:44:35.360]  to do to click approval that you're that you're visiting a fake news site before they'll let
[1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:38.720]  you subscribe to a particular they've been doing that to info wars and then by the way
[1:44:38.720 --> 1:44:43.680]  i'll put it back on screen daily mail associated press he's moved back to transylvania lives
[1:44:43.680 --> 1:44:48.960]  are part of the year and yearns for transylvania where he believes again his soul is the prince
[1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:53.280]  of wales tenure battle to protect dracula's home and his yearning for transylvania he
[1:44:53.280 --> 1:44:58.000]  has moved in i saw the pbs special into dracula's castle does that not show how insane these
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:04.400]  people are it's pretty nuts to think that here we've got a descendant of lord teppich
[1:45:04.400 --> 1:45:10.000]  who wants to follow in his footsteps but it shows you just how absolutely power mad and
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:13.240]  corrupt some of these people are let's explain that came and took over germany too so let's
[1:45:13.240 --> 1:45:16.920]  hand it to the transylvanian royalty but i mean it's a sheer obviously a smart guy as
[1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:24.400]  well tell folks about vladium paler briefly well vladium paler got the name because in
[1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:31.760]  quelling any uprisings in his region he was famous for having the heads cut off of his
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:39.840]  opponents putting them on pikes and then staking those pikes around the perimeter of his castle
[1:45:39.840 --> 1:45:46.200]  so all the heads of his victims were staring out at the country at his countrymen as a reminder
[1:45:46.200 --> 1:45:49.720]  of what would happen if you went up against him and you're being pg that's why he got
[1:45:49.720 --> 1:45:55.640]  the name vladium paler you're being pg he would also put them live on a pole there's
[1:45:55.640 --> 1:46:02.960]  little like sketchings of that yeah that that was the uh the alternate method um yeah he
[1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:12.440]  was uh about as brutal and ruthless as any ruler has ever been he was uh the worst of
[1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:20.480]  the worst and unfortunately it's that same mindset that is infecting the the powers
[1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:25.520]  that be that the folks behind the scenes in in organizations like the trilateral commission
[1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:31.600]  and the council on foreign relations and so forth that they want global governance and
[1:46:31.600 --> 1:46:36.320]  they don't care what it takes to get it and they are they are willing to resort to any
[1:46:36.320 --> 1:46:42.000]  means even if that means starting starting another world war or crashing the global
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:46.560]  economy whatever it takes they'll do whatever it takes to make it happen but it all comes
[1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:54.040]  back to the information war which we are winning but i don't think we've seen the final battle
[1:46:54.040 --> 1:47:00.160]  yet i think that the next step is is going to be attempting to zero not just limit the
[1:47:00.160 --> 1:47:05.520]  income but zero the income of any one in the alternative media which drudge a year and
[1:47:05.520 --> 1:47:10.000]  a half ago coming here warned us exclusively was told by the supreme court justice the
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:15.600]  other conservative that isn't dead it was told this is coming they're going to use copyright
[1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:21.120]  all this other stuff to shut you down and now that's unfolding and again drudge went
[1:47:21.120 --> 1:47:25.680]  on to say after you're putting an electronic gulag the next thing is they start arresting
[1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:30.880]  people so folks have to understand this is a total battle to the end for yourself your
[1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:35.040]  family everybody when you go on message boards when you go out on youtube yourself you may
[1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:39.120]  not be being censored and launch a new fresh channel and call it puppy dogs and daisies
[1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:43.200]  but it's really alex jones videos we'll see one of my videos that somebody names puppy
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:46.880]  dogs and daisies get five million views when the same video on my channel gets a hundred
[1:47:46.880 --> 1:47:51.360]  thousand because they are blocking us they admit they're blocking us because they don't
[1:47:51.360 --> 1:47:56.480]  want you to know that john claude junker that just announced that he wants to break the united
[1:47:56.480 --> 1:48:01.600]  states up using economic warfare the head of the uu is an unelected dictator and the heir
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:07.440]  to the major nazi fortunes of world war two and rules as a royalty luxenberg i mean this
[1:48:07.440 --> 1:48:13.120]  is a joke some guy in a tax exempt kingdom runs the uu and is threatening us i mean you know
[1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:18.960]  what getting her boxing ring john claude junkers i mean it's just unbelievable i'm sick of these
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:25.760]  people well i think we're all sick of them alex it we're really seeing the the end game of the
[1:48:25.760 --> 1:48:32.240]  informant nation war starting to play out and it's interesting to see that there's collusion
[1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:40.320]  between the the shadow government and these corporations that run that run the organizations
[1:48:40.320 --> 1:48:47.520]  like facebook youtube amazon dot com most of these corporations are headquartered in california
[1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:56.000]  they're run by ultra liberals like the the zuckerbergs of the world and they are more dramatically
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:02.640]  turning the screws on the alternative media most recently as of the first of march amazon completely
[1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:08.880]  changed its structure for anyone who's an amazon associate a lot of bloggers and video bloggers
[1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:16.640]  make their living by having links to amazon products they cut that revenue in half very
[1:49:16.640 --> 1:49:22.560]  quietly with no no public announcement they just did it they just cut cut all the bloggers
[1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:30.480]  income in a half and i have no doubt that they had conservative bloggers in mind when they did
[1:49:30.480 --> 1:49:35.680]  that because they had some of the most influential sites in some of the most heavily visited sites
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:41.040]  well the way they rechain the way they restructured their commissions it was no longer based on
[1:49:41.040 --> 1:49:45.360]  volume they made it a straight commission and most of those commissions dropped to four percent
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:52.800]  so i think they they definitely want to silence the blogging community the the video blogging
[1:49:52.800 --> 1:49:59.040]  community a lot of those video bloggers are reposting info wars for example they're
[1:49:59.040 --> 1:50:06.640]  reposting info wars war segments so it's really obvious what's going on but again we haven't
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:12.000]  seen the end of it yet and i think in its final stages we'll see absolute cutoffs
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:22.960]  banning of of entire sites both your website and mine were both included in a list that came out
[1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:30.960]  from harvard university a couple of years ago a couple of weeks ago where we're named as we're
[1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:37.040]  on their bad boy list i think that the final step is going to be completely zeroing out all income
[1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:42.400]  for um bloggers video i know for a fact the democratic party has their top people
[1:50:42.400 --> 1:50:48.880]  it's not completely cutting off all access well that's right the democratic party is is is behind
[1:50:48.880 --> 1:50:53.440]  the scenes organizing and admitting that that their plan is to shut us off and destroy us and
[1:50:53.440 --> 1:50:58.400]  hell david rock just admits that here's the thing congress has to move against this and stop being
[1:50:58.400 --> 1:51:02.960]  on the defensive with all this made up russian crap the republicans have to get on the offensive
[1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:08.000]  the problem is so many of them are sold out and controlled as well i want to play a video that's
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:12.560]  up on info wars dot com it's shocking but everybody should spread this because this is what marilla
[1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:19.840]  pin has been indicted for in france this is what uh gert wilders has gotten indicted for is just
[1:51:19.840 --> 1:51:25.600]  showing videos of muslims hurting women or killing gays you're that's that's anti-islam and we now
[1:51:25.600 --> 1:51:31.280]  have uh facebook shamefully working with shawty arabia pakistan and others saying we'll report
[1:51:31.280 --> 1:51:35.440]  people in your country that criticize you show they can be taken and have their heads cut off
[1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:40.560]  i mean that's that's just like helping china round up chinese dissidents i mean the nakedness
[1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:46.880]  of the authoritarianism is dizzying and it just shows what they would do to us if they could get
[1:51:46.880 --> 1:51:52.000]  away with it so we're not looking for an offensive attack but remember women aren't allowed to go out
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:57.200]  in public without a man chaperone uh and and now the men chaperones beat them in public
[1:51:57.200 --> 1:52:03.120]  and they're they're treated as less than animals and this is what literal see feminists at major
[1:52:03.120 --> 1:52:08.640]  events have them put hijabs on they they they chant a lot bar at these events with their breast
[1:52:08.640 --> 1:52:13.600]  hanging out that they'd be killed instantly in these countries it is literally a cuckold twisted
[1:52:14.240 --> 1:52:20.320]  spoiled rotten trendies in dc a small memorial that 150 million killed by communists being spit on
[1:52:20.320 --> 1:52:28.080]  pissed on flipped off by trendies uh and then i saw it on facebook being praised oh yes screw
[1:52:28.080 --> 1:52:32.720]  them you know good communism let's kill more they're always a little glimpse never been in a fight
[1:52:33.280 --> 1:52:37.680]  and they're trying to start a fight with 150 million armed people almost all the combat vets
[1:52:37.680 --> 1:52:42.720]  are on our side and what they don't get is there's a reason you don't target people's families and
[1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:46.640]  you have chivalry it's not because people aren't mean it's because you want you want your family
[1:52:46.640 --> 1:52:52.800]  safe the globalists just keep pushing and pushing james they're going to do false flags try to
[1:52:52.800 --> 1:52:56.560]  blame it on us no i'm chomsky says trump is the false flags bringing all the muslims in
[1:52:56.560 --> 1:53:00.400]  then they're going to blow stuff up then they try to take our rights but i just don't think
[1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:04.960]  they know what they've gotten into just like they were delusional with the election i but that's my
[1:53:04.960 --> 1:53:10.320]  concern is it's like them trying to start a war with russia okay we've got some advanced laser
[1:53:10.320 --> 1:53:13.520]  stuff they can shoot down a lot of their missiles you're not going to stop them all nobody survives
[1:53:13.520 --> 1:53:19.120]  a nuclear war don't do it there's a madness and chomsky says we shouldn't attack the elites now
[1:53:19.120 --> 1:53:24.560]  alex jones is attacking the elites that's wrong they're innocent oh globalism is good i mean
[1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:32.640]  it's just crazy what do you say to all that well it shows you just how radically things are
[1:53:32.640 --> 1:53:41.120]  spinning out of control for the power elite they panicked when trump got elected they're scrambling
[1:53:41.120 --> 1:53:48.400]  to try to re-consolidate power they're attempting to set up a shadow government they're doing their
[1:53:48.400 --> 1:53:54.480]  very best to torpedo the alternative media they're doing their very best to vilify
[1:53:55.840 --> 1:54:03.920]  the entire trump cabinet especially people like steve bannon where they're they're in an
[1:54:03.920 --> 1:54:11.760]  out-and-out war against the entire patriot movement against the bedrock culture of this country and
[1:54:11.760 --> 1:54:19.840]  they don't care what they have to do to is one of those ends justify the means kind of situations
[1:54:19.840 --> 1:54:28.080]  for them so just beware folks the the war on the media is really not ended it's going to get worse
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:34.320]  people need to set up alternative communications amongst themselves it may come down to actually
[1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:44.080]  handing around copies of videos on dvds before it's all over and by the way if folks get demoralized
[1:54:44.080 --> 1:54:50.480]  by that if they go into that climate people will pass around something print it off on your computer
[1:54:50.480 --> 1:54:56.720]  that you saved 20 times like it's gold see that's the real danger for the globalist their admission
[1:54:56.720 --> 1:55:05.600]  they're censoring their admission they're proving themselves to china by censoring europe doesn't
[1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:11.120]  have the danger of turning us into the true rock stars which i don't even want the point is when
[1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:18.000]  they try to suppress something it makes it blow up so they're on a dangerous road right they're
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:24.720]  they're trying to um to demonize us but if they push too hard you're right they're going to make
[1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:33.600]  people hungry for the truth and there's going to be a a true counterculture uh in america where
[1:55:34.240 --> 1:55:40.160]  folks are organizing at the grassroots level and saying hey here's the real truth the mass media
[1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:48.240]  is lying to us so folks need to be ready to uh use alternate means to get information out there
[1:55:48.240 --> 1:55:56.720]  i have a feeling that youtube is going to be the real hatchet man in all of this when they
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:56:02.880]  when they try to cut off all alternative media i think youtube is going to be the main portal
[1:56:02.880 --> 1:56:08.640]  that they're going to use for control so it's important that people get used to and bookmark
[1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:20.720]  sites like vid me it's v vid dot me that's victor india delta dot mike echo vid me
[1:56:22.080 --> 1:56:28.240]  bookmark that site folks because youtube may soon go completely vanilla on you and there will be no
[1:56:28.240 --> 1:56:35.600]  more info wars on youtube you've got to bookmark these alternate sites because they're not under
[1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:41.360]  the same corporate uh control as the the sites like facebook and youtube and the crazy part is
[1:56:43.200 --> 1:56:49.200]  they're attacking us on all these platforms like cnn attacking last night they called like 30 minutes
[1:56:49.200 --> 1:56:54.800]  before the show to act like they got comment when they didn't they just want to act like they're
[1:56:54.800 --> 1:56:59.360]  still journalists so they're going to attack us and lie about us everywhere and then not even let us
[1:56:59.360 --> 1:57:07.840]  respond and then shut us off from the digital soap box that's the internet right and history has shown
[1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:14.160]  that when the soap box is taken away and the jury box is taken away that only leaves the cartridge
[1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:22.000]  box i talked a lot of military people they're smart and they say it seems almost like a setup
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:26.640]  against the left but no it's just arrogance the way they're starting to fight with the most trained
[1:57:26.640 --> 1:57:35.200]  aggressive patriot system in the world and cornering us i mean i don't see a lot of avenues for them
[1:57:35.200 --> 1:57:39.360]  that's what concerns me i'm not fearing for my own life i worry about the entire species of the
[1:57:39.360 --> 1:57:43.360]  planet with these type of people running it is there any way to get through to these elites
[1:57:43.360 --> 1:57:49.760]  james and get them to back down they seem power drunk at this point yeah they should have caught a
[1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:56.080]  clue with the november election or brexit or all the other globalist rebellions they didn't back
[1:57:56.080 --> 1:58:03.920]  down they're doubling down and that's evidence that they have no restraint whatsoever and as i
[1:58:03.920 --> 1:58:09.840]  mentioned before if it means crashing the economy or or or resorting to and that's another thing
[1:58:09.840 --> 1:58:14.720]  james how do they say we're trying to crash the economy to hurt trump and they should be crucified
[1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:22.880]  for that yeah but uh they think that they're tethalon they think they they can't be stopped
[1:58:22.880 --> 1:58:27.760]  or for advocating that or trying to make that happen and that if if they do make it happen
[1:58:28.320 --> 1:58:33.280]  they think that they're invulnerable from being caught all right we're back in 70 seconds five
[1:58:33.280 --> 1:58:37.680]  more minutes with james leslie rawl survival blog dot com on how we how we stopped this what we
[1:58:37.680 --> 1:58:43.600]  can do now but folks the the links are weapons in the truth war you gotta get them out you gotta
[1:58:43.600 --> 1:58:52.320]  get the links out it's a war folks you gotta hammer the enemy this is alex jones i want to
[1:58:52.320 --> 1:58:57.680]  tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off the grid products of 2017
[1:58:57.680 --> 1:59:01.840]  and seriously i really think everyone should have one of these i'm talking about the ppx solar
[1:59:01.840 --> 1:59:06.880]  generator system from our friends at solutions from science one of our oldest sponsors the ppx is
[1:59:06.880 --> 1:59:11.600]  so small you can put it in your pocket but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your
[1:59:11.600 --> 1:59:16.320]  house like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling plus you can take it with you
[1:59:16.320 --> 1:59:21.520]  to jumpstart cars trucks buses 18 wheelers heavy equipment even airplanes the system provides
[1:59:21.520 --> 1:59:26.080]  an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity allowing you to create your own private power grid
[1:59:26.080 --> 1:59:31.280]  literally anywhere in the world perfect for cabins remote locations any time you need to get off
[1:59:31.280 --> 1:59:36.560]  the grid for a while go to private power grid dot com to watch this thing in action that's private
[1:59:36.560 --> 1:59:42.720]  power grid dot com even better use coupon code private at checkout and get a second ppx energy
[1:59:42.720 --> 1:59:54.640]  unit for free check it out at private power grid dot com that's private power grid dot com
[2:00:13.440 --> 2:00:17.120]  foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[2:00:22.320 --> 2:00:28.960]  all the men the doctors and lawyers and real estate agents bankers shop foreman i know
[2:00:29.840 --> 2:00:38.240]  who are probably better men than i would just stand up be men again and get involved not be
[2:00:38.240 --> 2:00:47.680]  followers we'd save this planet so many men want to be followers they've been taught it's silly to
[2:00:47.680 --> 2:00:54.160]  care or to be involved that's why we're inches away from losing everything i've looked at history
[2:00:55.520 --> 2:00:59.520]  if things go south you're gonna have to break down a civilization
[2:01:02.080 --> 2:01:06.320]  james losie rolls i appreciate you riding shotgun with us once a month i really appreciate
[2:01:06.320 --> 2:01:12.320]  all the work you do i again don't have words to describe to the viewers and listeners how real all
[2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:17.440]  this is and how all hands on deck we have a chance a good chance to win this i think we're i think
[2:01:17.440 --> 2:01:23.600]  we're 60 right now i mean i think we've got the initiative we're winning but the enemy now knows
[2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:28.000]  how much trouble they're in they're really pressing the attack back the counter-defensive and what
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:32.480]  else can we do in four minutes we've got left here with you i mean i understand individually
[2:01:32.480 --> 2:01:38.880]  get ready but offensively what can we do to stand up against them and defeat these people
[2:01:38.880 --> 2:01:45.200]  well i guess first and foremost is pray hard second is organize folks need to get involved at the
[2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:53.600]  grassroots level in their communities because if if the threat is from the top down the solution
[2:01:53.600 --> 2:02:01.440]  is from the bottom up and you can't can't stop a grassroots american movement it's just not going
[2:02:01.440 --> 2:02:10.160]  to happen they're not going to be able to put their control grid down on an informed and motivated
[2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:15.840]  public if the populace really recognizes what's going on and i think they do because they're
[2:02:15.840 --> 2:02:20.960]  they're getting the news from the alternative media the mainstream news sources have essentially
[2:02:20.960 --> 2:02:28.320]  collapsed if you look at the ratings uh the the traditional big three networks are a joke now in
[2:02:28.320 --> 2:02:34.080]  terms of their actual viewership and their actual impact it when i was growing up and when you were
[2:02:34.080 --> 2:02:43.440]  growing up uh you and i saw you know huntley and brinkley and and welter cronkite as the
[2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:51.760]  authoritative sources now for this generation for the millennials they look at the the big three
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:59.120]  networks as a joke and rightfully so so they've actually lost the information war and as bad as
[2:02:59.120 --> 2:03:04.720]  brinkley and all them were they would never have gone along with what's happening now they just it
[2:03:04.720 --> 2:03:09.040]  was just a different time so it's not just the internet came along it was what destroyed them
[2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:13.360]  they also were so immoral and such liars they're really why they destroyed themselves with all
[2:03:13.360 --> 2:03:18.640]  their money and power they should still be dominating news if they weren't such liars right
[2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:24.640]  if if they were still responsible journalists and actually reporting objective facts rather
[2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:32.400]  than proselytizing and rather than you know grandstanding and faking news and pushing agendas
[2:03:32.400 --> 2:03:38.080]  if they were still real journalists they would still have that market share but because starting
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:46.160]  with cnn in the eighties uh mass media lost all credibility but they lost their soul you're so
[2:03:46.160 --> 2:03:49.920]  smart yeah i mean you're just dead on cnn is where the media totally lost its soul
[2:03:50.720 --> 2:03:54.560]  because before there was some disinfo but it would always become a scandal if they lied big
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:58.400]  and then and then it was mainly the propaganda was in you know mary tyler more and sitcoms that
[2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:02.960]  was the real brainwashing but with but in the eighties when cnn did you know the nineties of fake
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:08.240]  you know attacks you know nerve gas attacks and stuff they taught the media how to be total
[2:04:08.240 --> 2:04:16.080]  frauds and made it safe i guess that's right that's right so again we've we have effectively already
[2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:21.760]  won the information war it's just a matter of consolidating our victory at this point and
[2:04:21.760 --> 2:04:28.560]  making sure that the powers that be are are taught that they cannot get away with this
[2:04:28.560 --> 2:04:33.920]  that they they can try to silence us but it won't work and the harder they push the heart of the
[2:04:33.920 --> 2:04:38.400]  american people are going to push back and look they want a violent war and all this killing
[2:04:38.400 --> 2:04:42.080]  and stuff they see to know it's not the police and military that are going to get targeted
[2:04:42.080 --> 2:04:48.160]  in the civil war it's going to be them i'm not just a fact right and and i've got news for them
[2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:54.880]  there's a lot more of us than there are them you know they even the leftists use the term the one

[2:11:24.960 --> 2:11:29.600]  telling them to go to hell now mr robinson will but here's the deal i don't want to fight with muslims
[2:11:31.280 --> 2:11:34.880]  i went to high school and college with nice muslims that were engineers at degrees and
[2:11:34.880 --> 2:11:40.560]  didn't like radicalism wanted to go drink beer but the vast majority are under this control
[2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:46.000]  there's massive inbreeding it's admitted it's like elites get mentally ill that's a big problem in
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:55.680]  islam and so you've you've got some problems here and tommy robinson.co.uk is the website
[2:11:56.400 --> 2:11:59.680]  they take him out of context they lie about him all the news the point is is that
[2:12:01.920 --> 2:12:05.760]  leftists were out there last week after the big terror attack i run people over stabbing him
[2:12:05.760 --> 2:12:10.800]  with isis parliament says it's not islamic he goes out there there's a long video where
[2:12:10.800 --> 2:12:16.480]  we'll play some short clips of it they're out there laughing the leftist are about it in fact
[2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:20.720]  here's an article keep calm alex jones the queen is not being pressured to convert to islam

[2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:42.640]  they don't deny it's true they say i'm a cook because we got a guy saying you're going to convert
[2:12:42.640 --> 2:12:47.680]  that's what they did in constancy nopal but now it's standbull that's what turkey used to be christian
[2:12:48.640 --> 2:12:52.160]  that's what they did in greece greece just is now allowing mosques be set up it's only a few
[2:12:52.160 --> 2:12:55.840]  hundred years ago they got the muslims out greeks used to be blonde hair blue eyed folks
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:03.440]  do you understand what what islam does the most pure forms of it they have slavery and sell
[2:13:03.440 --> 2:13:09.280]  women on slave blocks and the media makes jokes and cobert goes what's a slave block knowing his
[2:13:09.280 --> 2:13:17.040]  dumb audience doesn't know they put your ass up on a block and people bid on you in sudan in places
[2:13:17.040 --> 2:13:23.120]  like that in somalia and trumps like seven countries don't even have ideas they don't even have
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:27.440]  working governments you can't even fly out of somalia you got to go to another country no we

[2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:44.560]  it's amazing it's amazing greeks were conquered and for hundreds of years under islamic control
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:51.840]  the greeks had to hide in the hills for hundreds of years and be in constant civil war till they
[2:13:51.840 --> 2:13:56.000]  finally drove them drove the muslims out to the greeks credit they actually kicked them out nobody
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:04.240]  else ever seems to europe almost got completely taken over the whole grace culture mission of islam
[2:14:04.240 --> 2:14:10.320]  is to conquer everything japan will not allow one muslim to immigrate to japan because they're not
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:16.320]  suicidal now i want to go to our guest rest of the hour i'll skip a break so we have more time

[2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:40.160]  out of the out of her palace i say if you know if the queen doesn't like having sovereignty
[2:14:40.160 --> 2:14:46.160]  she should go back to germany or back to transylvania where her and her whole carpet bag in anti-uk
[2:14:46.160 --> 2:14:50.960]  family came from i'm not going to get to that and there's some good things about having some
[2:14:50.960 --> 2:14:54.960]  sovereignty and some of the old systems there and people liking it i get that's the only culture
[2:14:54.960 --> 2:14:59.120]  england's got but that's another false culture dropped on top of its head if you're a historian
[2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:03.120]  you know that but but let's the point is you shouldn't ban the flags and the rest of it
[2:15:03.120 --> 2:15:08.160]  but let's go ahead and play those clips i'm a good our guest here it is i'm on the reality this is
[2:15:08.160 --> 2:15:13.280]  the reality the reality is this is a war these people are waiting war on us for for time this has
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:18.320]  gone on for 1400 years this is nothing new and the whole time why this goes goes on police leaders
[2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:21.760]  or police leaders want to invite more they want to invite more
[2:15:24.400 --> 2:15:27.520]  all right i've got some other clips we're going to get to uh coming up like the one that's in the
[2:15:27.520 --> 2:15:32.240]  daily beast uh where again keep calm alex jones the queen is not being pressured to convert to
[2:15:32.240 --> 2:15:38.160]  islam so the muslims don't pressure anybody to convert they never take over grasses and green
[2:15:38.160 --> 2:15:42.560]  this is an assault on reality so to give us the big picture and then to drill into what's currently
[2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:48.640]  happening tony robinson uh now joins us uh with with i mean we're gonna play video in a moment too
[2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:52.800]  shows a saudi man literally hurting women down the street with a stick this is routine
[2:15:54.480 --> 2:15:57.280]  if you're out without a hood on your head you you know you get beaten or killed
[2:15:58.080 --> 2:16:02.400]  but we should all accept this because we're liberals so so so tony robinson saying things
[2:16:02.400 --> 2:16:07.040]  now you get arrested for an angle but he keeps doing it uh here you are beaming into the united
[2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:12.080]  states and what's left of the free world thanks for joining us thanks for having me on elix well i've
[2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:16.960]  been ranting kind of set in the table give us the big picture what's going on in the uk uh
[2:16:16.960 --> 2:16:21.280]  you know the current battle what's happening so i'll give you the background of where i live
[2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:27.520]  i was i was born in 1982 when i was born we had one mosque um there's currently 30 mosques in my
[2:16:27.520 --> 2:16:33.680]  town my town is 30 miles north of london it was the launching pad for the 77 bomb block it was
[2:16:33.680 --> 2:16:38.560]  the fertilizer bomb block the stock home bomber there were muslims put in jail this year for
[2:16:38.560 --> 2:16:46.320]  planning to behead an american um soldier on the streets of the uk um currently 40 of my town is
[2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:53.360]  muslim i've seen firsthand i i've seen firsthand the problems that this culture and this ideology
[2:16:53.360 --> 2:16:59.360]  will bring to your town i've seen the attack on your freedom on your free speech on your women
[2:16:59.360 --> 2:17:06.160]  on your culture on your identity the erosion of who you are um everything comes under attack
[2:17:06.160 --> 2:17:11.200]  and of course not all muslims but this is a reality of what i think when you're talking a minute ago
[2:17:11.200 --> 2:17:18.000]  about you're discussing inbreeding in the islamic community now these are facts and i understand
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  liberals don't like facts 3.4 percent of of england is pakistani okay pakistani heritage
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:32.320]  3.4 percent they are responsible for over 30 percent of the birth defects these are all problems
[2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:39.120]  that will come with islam in the in the uk we've had 66 percent of british muslims said they would
[2:17:39.120 --> 2:17:47.200]  not report on fellow isis fighters 66 percent so when we talk about terrorism terrorism is very bad
[2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:52.880]  we've had 12 12 planned terrorist attacks last year no one draws in on that we've had one successful
[2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:57.840]  one in in years but we don't realize that every year if they were successful we'd have had shopping
[2:17:57.840 --> 2:18:02.400]  centers aeroplanes schools everything would have been attacked every month we'd then realize then
[2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:07.120]  the liberals would realize everyone would realize we're at war we're in a war zone here now the
[2:18:07.120 --> 2:18:13.040]  terrorism is bad but the general views the general consensus of the of the way in the swimming pools
[2:18:13.040 --> 2:18:18.720]  raping everybody running around bullying supporting all this crap the welfare rates 80
[2:18:18.720 --> 2:18:22.960]  some percent of the muslims in germany are on welfare i mean this is just staggering and then
[2:18:22.960 --> 2:18:28.000]  and then the the arrogance the bitching that that everybody has to roll a red carpet out and the
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:35.840]  grand imam saying take that web and they're weak i mean it's like a joke in the uk 75 percent of
[2:18:35.840 --> 2:18:40.640]  muslim women are on benefits and 50 percent of muslim men when you talk about taking our women
[2:18:40.640 --> 2:18:46.000]  most recently in cardiff which is the capital of wales we had an imam who said the time is coming
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:50.640]  soon when we take the non-muslim women as sexual slaves where we don't need an imam to say that
[2:18:50.640 --> 2:18:56.640]  because muslim men already in our country are taking our women as sexual slaves we have street level
[2:18:56.640 --> 2:19:01.120]  gang grooming grooming they call it grooming in the uk like it's cutting the hairs of dogs
[2:19:01.120 --> 2:19:07.120]  really it's a rape jihad it's a rape jihad going on our country where 90 percent of the convicted
[2:19:07.120 --> 2:19:13.600]  perpetrators are muslim men 20 percent of them are called muhammad we're told continually continuously
[2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:19.040]  this has nothing to do with islam this has everything to do with islam these gangs that
[2:19:19.040 --> 2:19:24.960]  are raping sex slavery look at al qaeda and isis all the sex slaves and let's expand on this though
[2:19:24.960 --> 2:19:29.760]  what's going on with the left and their true alliance with it how do they think being bought
[2:19:29.760 --> 2:19:34.640]  off by islam and i guess it's this anti-west that's all that left cares about the green party and all
[2:19:34.640 --> 2:19:39.440]  them cheering thank god germany won't be german will be islamic soon and they cheer you know in
[2:19:39.440 --> 2:19:44.960]  major cities and and and you know the feminist mayor of cologne says don't wear many skirts
[2:19:44.960 --> 2:19:48.880]  or the muslims will rape you it's your fault it's like because they're the feminists they've
[2:19:48.880 --> 2:19:53.760]  now become the anti-feminist it's a cult what the hell's going on with the left
[2:19:54.960 --> 2:19:59.760]  there seems to be in the left a strong alliance between the marxists the communists and islam
[2:19:59.760 --> 2:20:04.880]  and i believe they i believe they think they can use islam they confuse because they're against
[2:20:04.880 --> 2:20:08.480]  the rule of democracy they're against the rule of law they're against democracy and i believe they
[2:20:08.480 --> 2:20:13.200]  really think they can use it to bring it down not understanding that there'll be the first victims
[2:20:13.200 --> 2:20:18.080]  of it and whether this is whether this view that you could import islam into our country and combine
[2:20:18.080 --> 2:20:23.600]  the two together it's like oil and water now when you have Angela Merkel you have david camera and
[2:20:23.600 --> 2:20:28.640]  you have all world leaders saying that multiculturalism has failed they're just two cowardice to say
[2:20:28.640 --> 2:20:33.600]  islam has failed and let's expand on that my biggest issue with islam is it does come in and
[2:20:33.600 --> 2:20:38.080]  try to make you conform and all over germany says you can't have outdoor october fest because the
[2:20:38.080 --> 2:20:41.680]  muslims come and attack you because they don't like seeing men and women running around having a
[2:20:41.680 --> 2:20:47.280]  great time eating big old you know beef stew and sausage and drinking beer outside and it's just
[2:20:47.280 --> 2:20:52.640]  crazy a nice cool you know night they don't like people having a good time it's a it's a cult of
[2:20:52.640 --> 2:20:57.920]  killjoys and i'm and i'm just we're not going to put up with it and i don't understand what the
[2:20:57.920 --> 2:21:03.360]  hell the left is doing backing this so my biggest problem is it's not compatible and the left is
[2:21:03.360 --> 2:21:10.880]  trying to get rid of our speech so we can port to it no sorry and i think they they wish to maintain
[2:21:10.880 --> 2:21:16.160]  power now if i bring you back to my hometown again if you look at the demographical growth
[2:21:16.160 --> 2:21:22.000]  forecast for the communities in my town by 2030 the pakistani and the banglid deshi communities
[2:21:22.000 --> 2:21:28.400]  will increase by 70 to 77 percent the white and black community will increase by 1.3 percent to
[2:21:28.400 --> 2:21:34.400]  1.4 percent that's not even a replacement now that they see the future the future is with islam
[2:21:34.400 --> 2:21:39.760]  the future is with muslims having 5.6 children us having 1.3 so the labor party in my town
[2:21:39.760 --> 2:21:44.720]  which is the left wing labor party the equivalent of your democrats they completely see that we
[2:21:44.720 --> 2:21:50.160]  we as white working class english men we are irrelevant we do not matter anymore the future
[2:21:50.160 --> 2:21:54.880]  is not with us that so that they're biden but here's the deal it's not even like we're being racist
[2:21:54.880 --> 2:22:00.720]  they're totally race and religion based and then they won't even let us just die and them take over
[2:22:00.720 --> 2:22:05.280]  they want to piss on us while they take over and the left is just running around because they hate
[2:22:05.280 --> 2:22:11.680]  the west so much just it's just celebrating their own destruction it's crazy there's a great speech
[2:22:11.680 --> 2:22:16.080]  there's a speech by shahid malik who was the first muslim minister of the labor government
[2:22:16.080 --> 2:22:22.160]  and he said in 2004 we had one muslim MP in 2006 we had two muslim MPs in 2008 we had four muslim MPs
[2:22:22.160 --> 2:22:27.840]  in 2010 we had 10 muslim MPs and in between saying each thing he says inshallah inshallah inshallah
[2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:32.960]  he says within 30 years the leader of this country will share our faith and there's thousands and he's
[2:22:32.960 --> 2:22:37.280]  in our government he's the right unmanned talk about when the labor party were in there's thousands
[2:22:37.280 --> 2:22:42.000]  and then next comes convert or die convert or die and let's expand on that what do you make of the
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:48.560]  daily beast and others making fun of the muslims that muslims never take over a country how ridiculous
[2:22:48.560 --> 2:22:53.440]  ha ha ha we've got the clip in a moment of them at you know the palace saying if the queen doesn't
[2:22:53.440 --> 2:22:59.280]  convert she's got to leave that's what islam always does then they act like we're insane making this up
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:03.920]  anyone understand understands histories understand this happened to 45 countries
[2:23:03.920 --> 2:23:08.720]  what what i don't understand is for the first country in history why would britain or europe
[2:23:08.720 --> 2:23:13.760]  be any different to every other place that islam has ever gone in history a whole of history
[2:23:13.760 --> 2:23:18.480]  what makes us different it is exactly the same islam it hasn't changed it's not like you take
[2:23:18.480 --> 2:23:26.000]  muslims out of britain and you put them in britain and they're somehow different it's the same book
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:31.120]  it's the same caron it's the same people it's the same ideology it's just a speech by shally malik
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:36.160]  we're going to show the speech after the break but since you mentioned it now let's play the clip
[2:23:36.160 --> 2:23:42.640]  singing in play but then they make jokes and say oh it's ridiculous like like like muslims would ever
[2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:47.600]  you know take over anything you know they all say they are and say we're weak and can't believe
[2:23:47.600 --> 2:23:51.280]  how pathetic our leaders are uh let's go ahead and play that short clip here it is
[2:23:52.400 --> 2:23:58.320]  basically showing how we will transform walking the palace into a local mosque for the muslims
[2:23:59.200 --> 2:24:03.360]  and what happens to the queen well the queen she has a choice she can either become a muslim or she
[2:24:03.360 --> 2:24:08.080]  can leave or she'll have to leave now here's another one video shows saudi man literally
[2:24:08.080 --> 2:24:14.560]  hurting veiled waslam women with a stick in this brand of islam thinness want to import to the west
[2:24:14.560 --> 2:24:21.360]  and that's all of saudi arabia that controls sunni and wild obvious culture that is 79 of islam
[2:24:21.360 --> 2:24:26.720]  and taking over the rest of islam very very quickly because there are some muslim cultures that
[2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:31.520]  actually value women in life and everything they're being eradicated the biggest killers of muslims
[2:24:31.520 --> 2:24:37.920]  are muslims i mean i just i i don't i don't get it my friend if you understand how deep this has
[2:24:37.920 --> 2:24:43.040]  gone and how infiltrated our country and systems are so the most recent west minister attacker
[2:24:43.040 --> 2:24:49.520]  that the terrorist uh khalid masood he he was he went he taught at a school in lutan the director
[2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:54.400]  of the school is the local imam from the lutan islamic center yeah who's a radical i've been on
[2:24:54.400 --> 2:24:59.280]  the radio with this man where he said so he wishes to execute homosexuals this same radical mosque
[2:24:59.280 --> 2:25:06.320]  was the mosque that the stock home bomber went to now this radical imam is part of my town's
[2:25:06.320 --> 2:25:11.600]  government project of lutan in harmony there's pictures of this man hugging a police officer
[2:25:11.600 --> 2:25:17.920]  which celebrate diversity this is a man who wishes to enforce the real law and then what i find out
[2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:23.120]  then that the training of our government the training of our police the training on islam
[2:25:23.120 --> 2:25:27.920]  is being given to them by the will harvest salafist leading imam who's when they went
[2:25:27.920 --> 2:25:32.560]  off-stead raided the school at his mosque they found that the children were being taught in their
[2:25:32.560 --> 2:25:38.480]  library how to cut off hands and feet they have infiltrated everything our government our prison
[2:25:38.480 --> 2:25:44.640]  system our education system our university god everything everything is being used and the left
[2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:49.680]  and the far left are facilitating and accommodating this as it happens and let's be clear it's in the
[2:25:49.680 --> 2:25:55.840]  quran it's a fact that everything inside islam is the house of islam everything else is the house
[2:25:55.840 --> 2:26:00.080]  of war that's why they're constantly killing each other because the most radical groups always say
[2:26:00.080 --> 2:26:04.720]  they're in charge and and everybody else is a heretic it is the most anti-liberal thing the
[2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:11.520]  galaxy's seen it is a joke level and to watch foaming at the mouth leftist and big foundations
[2:26:12.320 --> 2:26:17.520]  funding it makes my head spin tommy robinson uh his former uh an ex-leader of the english defense
[2:26:17.520 --> 2:26:23.200]  league uh since leaving the edl he has become an avid speaker and the problems of western world rise
[2:26:23.200 --> 2:26:28.800]  of extremism islam isis and hate speech and syria and if you expand all this the muslims admit in
[2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:34.080]  the quran we go we lie we assimilate we act like we're with it and when our number hits a certain
[2:26:34.080 --> 2:26:40.080]  point then we call it radical islam that starts killing then we say oh just capitulate to us and
[2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:45.120]  we'll stop the attacks and we just saw the turkish leader ergun and we just saw as the foreign
[2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:50.160]  minister tell germany tell france and tell sweden you will let us in you will let us politically
[2:26:50.160 --> 2:26:55.760]  organize and have basically political takeover or we will burn your country down in a quote holy
[2:26:55.760 --> 2:27:05.440]  war that's a quote burn your country holy war all of it and and and all this crap and i mean that's
[2:27:05.440 --> 2:27:09.760]  pure terrorism that's threatening terror if you don't give them politically what they want that's
[2:27:09.760 --> 2:27:15.040]  the definition see how suddenly turkey played nice for 50 years oh we're western we're western
[2:27:15.040 --> 2:27:20.800]  they were conquered by islam then all of a sudden the everybody's going back to the traditional dress
[2:27:20.800 --> 2:27:26.000]  urguns and islamicists he's merging with the little hobbyist that it's it's total deception it's it's
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:32.960]  a culture of pure war pure takeover totally political that literally runs women as slaves
[2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:39.920]  and is absolute nightmare i i just cannot believe that that our elites are siding with this why are
[2:27:39.920 --> 2:27:45.360]  they doing it tommy what what americans what americans have to understand what you have to
[2:27:45.360 --> 2:27:51.040]  realize is just how quick this can happen yeah so as if you'd have said to the people in my hometown
[2:27:51.040 --> 2:27:56.080]  which would have been my parents if you'd have said 30 years ago in 30 years time there'd be 30
[2:27:56.080 --> 2:28:00.560]  mosques there'd be banning the emblem of your country there'd be changing the name of christmas
[2:28:00.560 --> 2:28:05.520]  every single food will be halal your troops will be attacked in the streets your women
[2:28:05.520 --> 2:28:09.680]  will be raped and attacked on a daily basis if you'd have said that 30 years ago people would
[2:28:09.680 --> 2:28:17.680]  have said never not here yeah it's happened it's already happened there's no come back to my hometown
[2:28:17.680 --> 2:28:22.000]  okay they control the streets they control the gangs they control the drugs they control the
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:26.400]  town they control the council that's it that's right because they admit they'll deal drugs or
[2:28:26.400 --> 2:28:30.720]  anything because it's okay as long as you're selling it to the to the to the caffers which is
[2:28:30.720 --> 2:28:34.640]  what they call black people they call everybody else that means slave that's openly admitted yeah
[2:28:34.640 --> 2:28:38.560]  as long as long as they don't they don't care as they can commit crime as long as this against the
[2:28:38.560 --> 2:28:42.560]  kafa they use their religious their religious intolerance against normal muslims to justify
[2:28:42.560 --> 2:28:48.560]  everything to justify everything now americans you may look and think and in the uk since 1960
[2:28:48.560 --> 2:28:53.200]  the muslim population doubles every 10 years so when you look around i can be not i've seen it i've
[2:28:53.200 --> 2:28:59.280]  looked around in the state where i'm from and five years later it's like what the hell's happened here
[2:28:59.840 --> 2:29:05.360]  how has this happened oh my god and what's crazy is i i was brought up classically liberal what to
[2:29:05.360 --> 2:29:10.240]  be open to stuff they literally all the videos they laugh it's a joke the arrogance because
[2:29:10.240 --> 2:29:15.680]  they have no respect for us that we're uh that we've done this now they have no respect because
[2:29:15.680 --> 2:29:21.200]  we're so weak they do laugh at that and funny enough i oppose islam i i get quite a lot of muslims
[2:29:21.200 --> 2:29:24.160]  shaking my hand and they start shaking your hand because i believe in you but i believe you have
[2:29:24.160 --> 2:29:28.720]  courage because they're not used to people standing up to him and speaking honestly they're used to
[2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:33.040]  people appeasing and bending over and showing weakness to them and as a country what you have
[2:29:33.040 --> 2:29:37.280]  to understand it hasn't happened to your country yet but they'll be on their way to well hold on
[2:29:37.280 --> 2:29:40.160]  tell us what's coming next and i want to play the clip with that member of parliament who admits
[2:29:40.160 --> 2:29:44.640]  you know to take over and of course the muslims won't let you come to your their country and set
[2:29:44.640 --> 2:29:50.080]  up your system they'll kill you in a second see that's the thing we'll be back we're on the march

[2:33:59.440 --> 2:34:05.520]  don't so it's it's for me it's an energy pill that's 30 off similar selenium out there that
[2:34:05.520 --> 2:34:11.120]  isn't even as good as 40 you can get it for what is it 20 something bucks right now normally 30
[2:34:11.120 --> 2:34:16.880]  you can also get the x2 together in this combo for 34 that's the good halogen the bad halogens
[2:34:16.880 --> 2:34:22.400]  fill up your different glands block your hormones you name it x2 has done so much for me if you've
[2:34:22.400 --> 2:34:25.920]  not tried x2 you owe it to yourself to go read the reviews you owe it to yourself to support the
[2:34:25.920 --> 2:34:29.520]  broadcast and get a bottle of it and see what it does for you talk to your physician though because
[2:34:29.520 --> 2:34:33.360]  it's it's serious business isn't you're over the counter iodine and by that the crap they
[2:34:33.360 --> 2:34:38.160]  solve the counter this is true iodine from the deep earth crystals not not from seaweed
[2:34:39.840 --> 2:34:43.680]  because it's basically bound up we found when you get from seaweed uh still you'll get lower
[2:34:43.680 --> 2:34:48.240]  IQ and brain damage all sorts of stuff and die without iodine but this is the good this is the
[2:34:48.240 --> 2:34:53.200]  fancy iodine and it all happened when we were having different globalist operations trying to
[2:34:53.200 --> 2:34:58.960]  block us from getting really pure seaweed base and then just a door opened up a door opened up
[2:34:58.960 --> 2:35:03.840]  and we were able to get some that was being used industrially this is actually the iodine that they
[2:35:03.840 --> 2:35:11.280]  end up using in hospitals but these are for the spray instead of actually well it's a long story
[2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:16.000]  the point is a drop of this will eat a hole through the concrete until it's been put into the palm
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:21.440]  oil uh and this uh russian patented technique oh we're all russian agents with yeah we actual
[2:35:21.440 --> 2:35:26.560]  russian patent that's how dr grip gets it get yours today in four store dot com or triple eight
[2:35:26.560 --> 2:35:32.560]  two five three three one three nine because here's the deal we're in a total war and they've already
[2:35:32.560 --> 2:35:37.120]  tried to ban the free speech of people like our guests at tommy robinson and they're restricting
[2:35:37.120 --> 2:35:40.480]  it more and more they're arresting people all over europe they're telling the police in sweden
[2:35:40.480 --> 2:35:45.360]  don't say that 90 plus percent of the rapes are islamic men even though it's all on video
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:50.480]  and then they're they're trying to arrest nigel forage the founder of ukip right now
[2:35:51.200 --> 2:35:54.960]  because they've got a criminal complaint out because he said sweden's the rape capital
[2:35:54.960 --> 2:35:58.480]  guess what go to the state department's own website it's admitted just pull up a world map of rape
[2:35:58.480 --> 2:36:05.840]  statistics you'll get it i mean they're again it's so comical but i realize people that don't know
[2:36:05.840 --> 2:36:11.280]  like i remember hearing tommy robinson ten years ago and and seeing him in british papers and going
[2:36:11.280 --> 2:36:15.520]  all that guy's a little extreme and now it's like i sound more extreme than he does because i actually
[2:36:15.520 --> 2:36:19.360]  did the research he did and now everything he warned about because he was living in a town where
[2:36:19.360 --> 2:36:23.600]  it was already happening folks point blank range i see the videos every day in england just like
[2:36:23.600 --> 2:36:27.280]  you're walking with your family we'll walk up go what's your wife's doing not wearing a hijab
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:31.040]  boom slap her right in the face and people are so conditioned a lot of the britches rollovers
[2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:35.600]  start peeing on themselves i mean not literally but it's like a dog doing that i mean i've seen these
[2:36:35.600 --> 2:36:39.680]  videos that's just like man you do that to my wife it's i'm not bragging here but people are gonna
[2:36:39.680 --> 2:36:43.840]  either you're gonna die or i'm gonna die this isn't you just you're about to get attacked really hard
[2:36:43.840 --> 2:36:48.080]  and i don't know where the fighting spirit is it's like you know the uk all in history was like
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:51.760]  one of the worst groups never lost a war except against more brits they were fighting america
[2:36:51.760 --> 2:36:56.240]  i don't understand how england has gotten to this point the romans couldn't take over england
[2:36:56.240 --> 2:37:02.000]  but here we are they built you know that wall hadrian's wall where to stop the you know stop the
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:07.920]  folks coming down uh from wales how did this happen how do we break it how do we stop it and
[2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:14.480]  then i have the clip that mp he uh mentioned saying we're taking over go ahead this happened this has
[2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:20.000]  all been unintentionally so the fighting spirit and the fighting people has been taken out it's been
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:26.320]  bred out of them uh with a left wing if i just talk debate i'll bring you back again to my children
[2:37:26.320 --> 2:37:32.160]  you know my daughter when she was seven i'm preparing for a debate so i've got the biography
[2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:37.600]  of muhammad my daughter walks past she looks she says muhammad peace be upon him i haven't
[2:37:37.600 --> 2:37:41.920]  spoken to my children about islam al muhammad i've never spoken to them about i said what did you
[2:37:41.920 --> 2:37:49.040]  just say muhammad peace be upon him okay and i said that this is all from school i've then gone to
[2:37:49.040 --> 2:37:52.320]  i've then when she's she's mentioned that she's seen something which is a mosque and she said
[2:37:52.320 --> 2:37:57.360]  that's a special place when muslims pray part of the national curriculum for every school in the
[2:37:57.360 --> 2:38:02.880]  uk is the children age seven and eight go to visit the mosque where they're lied to that's happening
[2:38:02.880 --> 2:38:07.360]  here in the us in in in high school and middle school and elementary they're forcing them to study
[2:38:07.360 --> 2:38:13.280]  islam for forced to study and like i wouldn't mind if they bought my daughter to a mosque and said
[2:38:13.280 --> 2:38:19.440]  our prophet married a child your age our prophet the head is 600 people our prophet our prophet
[2:38:19.440 --> 2:38:25.840]  killed poets our prophet raped women it tell the truth tell the truth but they're not they're saying
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:32.080]  that g hard means in a struggle that islam is a religion of peace they're lying and indoctrinating
[2:38:32.080 --> 2:38:36.080]  children of my young age so when you talk about where is the fighting spirit gone you have to
[2:38:36.080 --> 2:38:42.400]  understand that as an english kid born up where i live white english people in the town are a minority
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:48.400]  now we've never once i went when it's the lucian day massive celebration st patrick's day
[2:38:48.400 --> 2:38:54.080]  three day festival that's the irish when it's eed fairgrounds parks celebrations when it's
[2:38:54.080 --> 2:39:00.240]  st george's day that's our national day to celebrate who we are band you bring in an emblem
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:05.760]  of st george to your school you will be suspended so what you then find is that english kids are
[2:39:05.760 --> 2:39:09.520]  walking with their heads down they don't know who they are they don't know where they've come from
[2:39:09.520 --> 2:39:14.480]  oh well i'll interrupt you just to back you up i have major news articles in germany and the uk
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:20.800]  where parents are countermanded and their children are forced to go to mosque i mean this is insane
[2:39:21.760 --> 2:39:26.720]  yep this is what's happening and then and then you have so then you have a generation of children
[2:39:26.720 --> 2:39:32.160]  who don't know who they are the west indian community can be proud of their history the pakistanis
[2:39:32.160 --> 2:39:35.840]  community are allowed to be proud of their identity but the english people aren't so they
[2:39:35.840 --> 2:39:39.840]  let's not forget st george's flag i've heard has been banned off government buildings correct
[2:39:40.720 --> 2:39:44.800]  it spans so so if someone's in a council house and they fly to st george there's been many times
[2:39:44.800 --> 2:39:50.160]  if they're told to take it down there's there's what they've managed to do is installed in people
[2:39:50.160 --> 2:39:55.120]  that the emblem of st george the emblem of our country if you celebrate it you're racist that's
[2:39:55.120 --> 2:39:59.600]  what they've managed to do and there was no history of that they just chose it because it's the original
[2:39:59.600 --> 2:40:05.680]  english flag yeah you you have to understand just how powerful political correctness is you have to
[2:40:05.680 --> 2:40:12.640]  understand how where fear fear is paralyzing and the fear of being branded racist has paralyzed
[2:40:12.640 --> 2:40:18.480]  the nation it's paralyzed our government it's paralyzed our people it's paralyzed people so much
[2:40:18.480 --> 2:40:24.240]  so that the police the government allowed 1400 young children to be passed around and oh yeah
[2:40:24.240 --> 2:40:28.000]  tell folks that was you talked about that years ago it was now been confirmed the muslim grooming
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:32.880]  program of pedophilia which is legal under islam uh now in the case of your adult men you're not
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:36.240]  supposed to do it but as long as the kid you're screwing it's okay uh again i don't care it's
[2:40:36.240 --> 2:40:40.720]  heterosexual homosexual don't touch kids but see now nambla and others are trying to mainline i think
[2:40:40.720 --> 2:40:44.080]  that's one reason the globalists like it the globalists are into pedophilia we know that
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:48.400]  and islam is too so suspend a few minutes on those scandals and for radio listeners if you're
[2:40:48.400 --> 2:40:54.000]  watching on info wars dot com forward slash show as he speaks my crew googles it and is showing
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:59.360]  mainstream news reporting it but oh we ban st george's flag it's good oh it's okay for muslims
[2:40:59.360 --> 2:41:03.760]  to have sexual kids in fact in germany they're like oh they raped the five-year-old it's okay
[2:41:03.760 --> 2:41:09.440]  it's their culture so please continue so so so it in a small town in the north of england called
[2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:15.440]  rotherham so for years i warned and spoke about men prostituting our young kids gang raping them
[2:41:15.440 --> 2:41:19.680]  when the families go to the police the police do nothing the police refuse to do anything yeah
[2:41:19.680 --> 2:41:23.040]  what's the headlines i've never seen this last year tell folks the headlines we can pull it up
[2:41:23.040 --> 2:41:27.280]  it was uh this is rotherham rape scandal just put it put in the city of rotherham
[2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:34.160]  it which is for putting 1400 rotherham there was four 1400 children and the report the government
[2:41:34.160 --> 2:41:39.920]  report from a charity it found that's when some dads got together to go and rescue their daughters
[2:41:39.920 --> 2:41:44.720]  who were 12 years old they got to the house where the muslim men have all got their daughters the
[2:41:44.720 --> 2:41:49.920]  police turned up and arrested the dads the police turned up and arrested the dads for trying to save
[2:41:49.920 --> 2:41:55.280]  their daughters with another time let's be clear let's be clear the muslims are famous that's what
[2:41:55.280 --> 2:41:58.640]  you call white slavery it means sex slavery people are so gonna say white slavery's a big
[2:41:58.640 --> 2:42:03.280]  issue in islam they go what about blacks being slaves white slavery means sex slavery folks
[2:42:03.280 --> 2:42:09.680]  and and islam that's a tenet of it its main business is the trafficking of women so it says
[2:42:10.800 --> 2:42:15.040]  it says multiple times in the quran the outside of your four wives you can take whatever your
[2:42:15.040 --> 2:42:20.320]  right arm possesses sexual slaves and it's it's legitimate it's sanctioned it's okay
[2:42:20.320 --> 2:42:25.440]  mahamid by the way i'm showing bbc headlines this was last year where they tell folks about it all
[2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:30.640]  came out admitted and they're kind of saying well it's islam's culture and again the dads try to
[2:42:30.640 --> 2:42:35.040]  get their little daughters 10 years old nine years old eight years old out of these things
[2:42:35.040 --> 2:42:40.160]  and elegant muslims call the cops and the police say this is on the news your daughters belong to
[2:42:40.160 --> 2:42:46.560]  them now the another situation in this government report so i've been warning this for years and
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:50.880]  i was called a liar and extremist yeah in this car i read you 10 years ago saying this was
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:42:56.640]  happening and i didn't believe it no that no one did and then only now so 10 years later
[2:42:56.640 --> 2:43:00.720]  everything we've said we've been vindicated for everything we tried warning about and what
[2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:05.040]  is actually come out is come out that the government knew the police 60 police officers
[2:43:05.040 --> 2:43:09.360]  are under investigation the british government's full of pedophiles they love it and yet the
[2:43:09.360 --> 2:43:14.320]  council knew social services knew they were actually conspirators there was a conspiracy
[2:43:14.320 --> 2:43:20.880]  of silence from police and religious leaders to facilitate the rape of our youth the handing
[2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:24.800]  over of our children now describe how they do it because this is now happening here i notice like
[2:43:24.800 --> 2:43:30.080]  islamism kind of merged with the mac daddy uh gangster culture and i and i see a lot of this
[2:43:30.080 --> 2:43:35.920]  going on where it's very very aggressive sexualization and when i was in london i've seen it where you
[2:43:35.920 --> 2:43:40.560]  see like islamic men on the street to kind of dress them like uh you know rapper type outfits with
[2:43:40.560 --> 2:43:45.280]  girls that look like they're 14 what's going on there so that's the start of it i there's that's
[2:43:45.280 --> 2:43:49.680]  the start of it so what it's a grooming process and you can see it happens to my it happens to my
[2:43:49.680 --> 2:43:55.280]  cousin 13 years old gang raped by men dozens of men she won't talk about your own family look i know
[2:43:55.280 --> 2:44:00.400]  you get upset tony walk through what happened what got you motivated tell folks about it so so
[2:44:00.400 --> 2:44:05.280]  basically i had when i was younger she was when i was younger and i can remember all of this i
[2:44:05.280 --> 2:44:09.120]  can remember the family meetings about it to go into the police the police not doing anything
[2:44:09.120 --> 2:44:16.240]  she woke up naked in a house with bearded muslim men all raping her gang raping her she run naked
[2:44:16.240 --> 2:44:21.360]  from the house she run naked from the house and and and and this has happened this is happening to
[2:44:21.360 --> 2:44:25.600]  girls across our country and when the when people went to the police which only now people understand
[2:44:25.600 --> 2:44:30.320]  the police were in on it the government were in on it everyone that they were not arresting or
[2:44:30.320 --> 2:44:35.440]  doing anything there's another situation where five muslim men had a young 11 year old girl
[2:44:35.440 --> 2:44:41.600]  in a in a derelict home yeah the police turned up they found the five men abusing her they arrested
[2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:48.080]  the girl for drunken disorderly they left the men go they must they let the men go and and do you
[2:44:48.080 --> 2:44:52.720]  know the reason given in the government report for why this was allowed to happen because the
[2:44:52.720 --> 2:44:57.440]  police did not want to be seen as racist yeah well here's the deal here's the deal anybody
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:00.640]  does anything to my daughters like that you're not going to worry and i'm not just talking
[2:45:00.640 --> 2:45:06.160]  there's nobody so polite in the south was you know people used to kill for no reason i'm done
[2:45:06.160 --> 2:45:10.240]  and i just these muslims everybody else needs to know you walk on me you're going to get it and
[2:45:10.240 --> 2:45:15.360]  the cops too used to i mean i am so and it's not all the police around the world obviously
[2:45:15.360 --> 2:45:21.600]  what the hell happened in the uk uh because privately i've met with mi six mi five folks
[2:45:21.600 --> 2:45:25.760]  when i cover boulderburg and police most of them are actually listeners they said we're pissed
[2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:31.680]  we don't like what's happening so i mean but i guess it's certain towns i mean how let's go over
[2:45:31.680 --> 2:45:35.840]  because i actually know the answer muslims once they get control of councils then they
[2:45:35.840 --> 2:45:40.880]  intimidate the police correct correct and what and what the police do and what the muslims do
[2:45:40.880 --> 2:45:45.840]  is that they focus on young girls from broken backgrounds who don't have a father just like
[2:45:45.840 --> 2:45:50.080]  sandusky did he they go after troubled youth they go after the troubled girls they go after
[2:45:50.080 --> 2:45:55.680]  troubled girls and then they and then they and then they rape they abuse and only now like 30 years later
[2:45:55.680 --> 2:46:00.800]  this has been going on for 30 years and and and it's this is not this is in every single town
[2:46:00.800 --> 2:46:05.920]  and city and we're supposed to the minute you talk about it like i'll give you another example
[2:46:05.920 --> 2:46:10.960]  i was sat there watching the news of this unfold i saw the english defense league supporters
[2:46:10.960 --> 2:46:16.640]  protesting outside the police station of roverham i then saw the journalist snigger and mock the
[2:46:16.640 --> 2:46:21.280]  english defense league supporters one of the girls in that crowd because i was watching it
[2:46:21.280 --> 2:46:27.200]  and i know her was gang raped for years by muslim men and then not only are you abused and you're
[2:46:27.200 --> 2:46:32.320]  a victim once you're a victim twice to the media you're slandered you're humiliated by the way
[2:46:32.320 --> 2:46:36.240]  these women in sweden germany england we have videos we can't even show you the ones that aren't
[2:46:36.240 --> 2:46:41.920]  edited we have an edited one of the woman being torn apart with muslim men raping or at the anti-racism
[2:46:41.920 --> 2:46:47.280]  conference concert the women go to this to hand them flowers they grab them and then rape them
[2:46:47.280 --> 2:46:52.960]  and the police stand there and watch it this is insane well the police the police are terrible
[2:46:52.960 --> 2:46:56.960]  that that is what you have to understand for how powerful political correctness is now you have
[2:46:56.960 --> 2:47:03.120]  to understand that not just on this rape issue anything so anything that's taboo to dealing
[2:47:03.120 --> 2:47:08.960]  with the muslim community is not dealt with so raping little kids is okay because the taboo
[2:47:08.960 --> 2:47:15.120]  is it pedophilia now and rape the taboo is hurting muslim's feelings it's hurting muslim's feelings
[2:47:15.120 --> 2:47:24.000]  even even for example female genital mutilation 5700 girls in britain last year abedin hillary
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  clinton's girlfriend literally her mother is the global head of the push to genital mutilate and
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:33.920]  to make sure it's legal in the west i wrote an article about it and the media made jokes and
[2:47:33.920 --> 2:47:39.440]  said so what i'm obsessed with women's uh yeah well actually i am but the point is but yeah don't
[2:47:39.440 --> 2:47:45.440]  chop i am don't chop it off literally the liberals are promoting genital mutilation now
[2:47:45.440 --> 2:47:50.480]  what planet what kind of fruit balls are these i mean what the hell's going on
[2:47:52.480 --> 2:47:57.440]  it's so it's so bad the situation in our country and this comes from everything so you watch for
[2:47:57.440 --> 2:48:02.480]  years as muslims pray and they know it they laugh if the police turn up to an instant as i've been
[2:48:02.480 --> 2:48:07.520]  growing up if young as young white english men if there was a confrontation with young pakistanis
[2:48:07.520 --> 2:48:12.640]  anywhere in the town at a night time the police would turn up jump straight on the white englishmen
[2:48:13.840 --> 2:48:19.760]  the pakistanis they laugh they're confident they know no one touches them they know they have control
[2:48:19.760 --> 2:48:25.840]  and then there's another instant alex which if i explained to you a muslim a muslim tori
[2:48:25.840 --> 2:48:33.280]  mp uh who was going for mp um called afsal amin yeah now i i ended up wearing undercover footage he
[2:48:33.280 --> 2:48:37.760]  approached me offering me money yeah this was to try and get him into parliament he had already
[2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:42.560]  been asked by david cambran what seat he wants on on the government what's he wants on the committee
[2:48:42.560 --> 2:48:47.760]  when i had the undercover footage i had him in a he was in a meeting with pakistani gangsters
[2:48:47.760 --> 2:48:52.880]  who were funding him they actually said in the meeting once he gets into parliament that's our
[2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:59.120]  man on the inside the police can't touch us how many of our members of the muslim parliament
[2:48:59.120 --> 2:49:03.680]  are working for gangsters are working for criminals who are stopping the police do their job
[2:49:03.680 --> 2:49:10.320]  it's corruption to that maximum level any one of you can you can google this case it's as afsal amin
[2:49:10.320 --> 2:49:16.480]  he was the captain in the british army for 10 years after i exposed him it turned out that
[2:49:16.480 --> 2:49:21.920]  before he joined the british army he wrote a leaflet about the muslim dean attacking us and converting
[2:49:21.920 --> 2:49:27.200]  our country through war to islam he was undercover in the british army as a captain for 10 years he
[2:49:27.200 --> 2:49:32.320]  was about to be one of the highest ranking members of our parliament he says he says in the undercover
[2:49:32.320 --> 2:49:38.160]  footage his goal is to be prime minister he was also talking about mass mass funding from katar
[2:49:38.720 --> 2:49:43.280]  but for the city this is what's happening across our country they have bought our politicians
[2:49:43.280 --> 2:49:47.440]  we've been under globalist we've been under globalist indoctrination to be domesticated they
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:53.840]  brought in super third world stone age cult brainwashed groups that are just i mean we can show
[2:49:53.840 --> 2:49:58.880]  you endless footage of women just grabbed at concerts gang raped and the police just stand
[2:49:58.880 --> 2:50:03.040]  there and these women are panicked they're out of their minds and horror and these guys are raping
[2:50:03.040 --> 2:50:08.240]  them hour after hour the women are hospitalized sometimes they kill them they'll just run up and
[2:50:08.240 --> 2:50:13.680]  grab a woman's baby and throw it right in the water and it's all just a big sacrament of the left
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:18.560]  we're going to skip the sprays we have more time this is a total death cult takeover and zucker
[2:50:18.560 --> 2:50:23.680]  burgan all of them are now making deals to report muslims and countries that criticize islam so
[2:50:23.680 --> 2:50:28.400]  they can be killed but it's okay because he's liberal and smiles and has an asian wife so it's
[2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:32.320]  it's okay we're murdering everyone we're zucker but we're liberal and you know it's just it's all
[2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:37.120]  totally sick because they believe islam has the numbers and it's still primitive they've made us
[2:50:37.120 --> 2:50:40.720]  not primitive with the defense mechanism we're like dodo burge is waiting there to be you know
[2:50:40.720 --> 2:50:44.960]  hit over the head this is happening but who was the member of parliament we actually found the
[2:50:44.960 --> 2:50:50.320]  club who said you know every 10 years we double what's your name shally malik yeah we're gonna
[2:50:50.320 --> 2:50:53.760]  play that clip right now let's let's play the club of that member of parliament here it is
[2:50:55.760 --> 2:51:02.400]  i'm proud of the achievements of the muslims of this country from 97 in 1997 we got our first
[2:51:02.400 --> 2:51:10.400]  muslim MP in 2001 we had two muslim MPs in 2005 we had four muslim MPs in shallow in 2009 10 well
[2:51:10.400 --> 2:51:16.640]  we'll have eight muslim MPs in 2014 we'll have 16 muslim MPs at this rate the whole parliament will
[2:51:16.640 --> 2:51:24.800]  be muslim but just to say in case that our journalists here today that is not my objective
[2:51:25.840 --> 2:51:30.240]  but you know we've got four muslim MPs there should be 20 muslim MPs in parliament and in
[2:51:30.240 --> 2:51:35.680]  shallow very shortly we'll see that and i'm confident as britain's first muslim minister
[2:51:35.680 --> 2:51:40.480]  but in shallow in the next 30 years or we'll see a prime minister in this country who happens to
[2:51:40.480 --> 2:51:47.520]  share my faith you know it's sick their cultures can't even operate because they're so evil and
[2:51:47.520 --> 2:51:53.360]  then we just roll over when we've got everything and just say take it all and destroy us and we've
[2:51:53.360 --> 2:51:59.440]  got go ahead sir we've got a muslim mayor of london said he can't oh yeah like a banning banning
[2:51:59.440 --> 2:52:04.960]  women in bathing suits and advertising and saying he's not a quote uncle tom he is for islamic take
[2:52:04.960 --> 2:52:09.680]  over and then making jokes about the terror attack last week what a piece of filth let's talk about him
[2:52:10.400 --> 2:52:14.800]  not allowing christian not allowing christian advertisement on buses but allowing advertisement
[2:52:14.800 --> 2:52:20.160]  that says praise to a lot um currently bands seek community from celebrating their their
[2:52:20.160 --> 2:52:25.280]  celebration on the 29th of april he's putting bands so he's dictating to them so when when he
[2:52:25.280 --> 2:52:29.440]  said shally malik we will have a prime minister that shares our faith mark my words you can bring
[2:52:29.440 --> 2:52:34.560]  this video up in four years time once he's finished being the mayor of london for four years he will
[2:52:34.560 --> 2:52:39.600]  become the leader of the labor party the left and the liberals as they did in london will swarm for
[2:52:39.600 --> 2:52:45.280]  him and vote for him as a great sign of tolerance that sign of tolerance who is he working for
[2:52:45.280 --> 2:52:49.440]  that's what i want to know the same as the one i exposed who is this man working for what is
[2:52:49.440 --> 2:52:55.920]  interest is it the inbreeding that makes these guys no matter what country it is look so insane
[2:52:55.920 --> 2:53:00.160]  or is it like is it satanic because there's just like a crazed evil about it i mean how
[2:53:00.160 --> 2:53:03.760]  would a bunch of men show up at a concert that never happens in the west ever and just start
[2:53:03.760 --> 2:53:08.240]  raping women i mean if i saw men raping women i don't care what's 20 of them i mean i'm a bragging
[2:53:08.240 --> 2:53:14.160]  i would attack them i don't understand this i don't understand what the hell's going on here
[2:53:14.720 --> 2:53:20.720]  but when you read the cases it's brother-in-laws so men with their wife's brother with their dad
[2:53:20.720 --> 2:53:24.880]  with their dad i'll tell you another case another case from a father i met from blackpool who comes
[2:53:24.880 --> 2:53:29.280]  to me crying and breaking down and crying and crying and crying because his daughter had been
[2:53:29.280 --> 2:53:35.440]  groomed and taken as a thing as a victim and the young muslim that was raping her rang the dad's
[2:53:35.440 --> 2:53:42.160]  phone and left it on the side while him and his father raped her so the dad listened to it these
[2:53:42.160 --> 2:53:48.240]  and these sort of things when you hear this yeah people think it's unbelievable pick up read read
[2:53:48.240 --> 2:53:52.320]  the government why is it that the muslims like to like you said we're gonna rape your daughter we
[2:53:52.320 --> 2:53:58.320]  want you to listen now it's like a it's an enjoyment too it's a it's a pleasure because
[2:53:58.320 --> 2:54:03.120]  because by taking our women it's the old the first thing to attack is our women it's the first
[2:54:03.120 --> 2:54:07.920]  there's a sign against us to destroy us destroy the daughters you hear them saying it i remember
[2:54:07.920 --> 2:54:12.160]  that you know that the emom of jerusalem the head emom goes they are weak we will take
[2:54:12.160 --> 2:54:19.440]  better women we are you're so good and then the left side yes yeah if you look at an interview
[2:54:19.440 --> 2:54:24.880]  by one of the leading al Qaeda operatives years ago and they give their plan for europe and in
[2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:29.120]  their plan from europe they predict the the government the american invasion of the middle east
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:33.680]  and then they say that the next invasion which will be syria um our forces will be too weak
[2:54:33.680 --> 2:54:37.680]  because of the previous ones and they'll be able to establish a caliphate and then when it gets to
[2:54:37.680 --> 2:54:47.120]  2016 2016 it says the islamic invading army will invade europe and at the start of 2016
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:52.800]  attack the women what happened on new years even in 2016 2000 women were attacked in cologne
[2:54:52.800 --> 2:54:56.560]  1000 and they're teaching us to accept it and now they have three million more about to come
[2:54:56.560 --> 2:55:00.880]  across from north africa but the head of the uu ordering group let them in but let's explain
[2:55:00.880 --> 2:55:05.840]  john brennan admittedly converted to islam more than 20 years ago in the cia he was a communist
[2:55:05.840 --> 2:55:10.960]  before he's the guy that's sworn to bring down trump the reason it all seems messianic the muslims
[2:55:10.960 --> 2:55:16.000]  think they're invincible now is traders in western governments have laid out a blueprint
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:24.160]  to capitulate to islam bring it in make all other western freedom end to quote serve them
[2:55:24.160 --> 2:55:29.680]  the problem is urgun's launching an early saying i'll burn down europe unless you submit to me
[2:55:29.680 --> 2:55:34.720]  so i think their greed is what's going to undo them what is the hope tony robinson how do we defeat
[2:55:34.720 --> 2:55:39.760]  them well i don't know why they don't just shut up because they'll win anyway just be silent you
[2:55:39.760 --> 2:55:43.280]  don't need to blow things up you know you're in france you're having seven point one children in
[2:55:43.280 --> 2:55:48.320]  france in england you're having five point six so when we say what is the hope the hope and i only
[2:55:48.320 --> 2:55:55.360]  or the hope is up until 12 to 18 months ago i had no hope i had no hope um donald trump getting him
[2:55:55.360 --> 2:56:00.640]  i think for us give us hope it's a change gut builders rising that i'm looking at four years
[2:56:00.640 --> 2:56:04.160]  time at the election i don't think it's this election i think they'll be able to stop marina
[2:56:04.160 --> 2:56:08.320]  penn again but in four years time gut builders will win lapel will win when we get a leader
[2:56:08.320 --> 2:56:13.040]  win in europe whether it be swedish democrats when the first leader comes in europe who challenges is
[2:56:13.040 --> 2:56:18.800]  long who not not just challenges it but enforces the laws that are already here when they break the
[2:56:18.800 --> 2:56:22.880]  law you enforce the law but in the minute we don't we let them do what they want when you try to
[2:56:22.880 --> 2:56:27.200]  enforce the law you realize you can't you could not enforce the law now on four percent you have
[2:56:27.200 --> 2:56:32.560]  to understand that only four to five percent of the uk's muslim look at the chaos caused what do
[2:56:32.560 --> 2:56:36.720]  we think as a country is a country normally isn't it once they hit ten percent they always try to
[2:56:36.720 --> 2:56:41.440]  take over yeah ten percent but they're starting already at five percent look look at europe look
[2:56:41.440 --> 2:56:47.520]  so it is ten percent but i said frances france is over ten percent now i look at seven seven seven
[2:56:47.520 --> 2:56:52.320]  i believe no it's coming up ten is it but that's the document i think there's like another five
[2:56:52.320 --> 2:56:56.320]  million illegals well what about illegal numbers i mean we know about what about the countless
[2:56:56.320 --> 2:57:02.240]  videos of the hijacking cars and robbing everything and just running around foaming at the mouth i sat
[2:57:02.240 --> 2:57:07.760]  down my local lima when i spoke about the figures for lutan and um i said to him we have what it's
[2:57:07.760 --> 2:57:13.120]  supposedly at a time with 60 000 muslims double it that's what he said straight away double it

[3:01:33.680 --> 3:01:39.200]  defeating them and that they now have been backed off they come to my house this morning alex oh really
[3:01:39.200 --> 3:01:44.160]  head drop all the time tell us about that they come to my house to ask my whereabouts on saturday
[3:01:44.160 --> 3:01:48.400]  because i'm going to cover an anti-terrorism march in london there's going to be a terrorism march in
[3:01:48.400 --> 3:01:52.880]  london against terror so i'm going there so they come to my house to say what are your plans why are
[3:01:52.880 --> 3:01:57.280]  you going what are you doing mainly because they're concerned for my safety they said they're concerned
[3:01:57.280 --> 3:02:01.680]  for my safety because they know muslims wish to kill me um i think that i think that what people
[3:02:01.680 --> 3:02:06.640]  have to understand is when i started out against this i was ready full well and understood the
[3:02:06.640 --> 3:02:11.200]  challenge i was taking on with the threats of violence from muslims what i was not ready for
[3:02:11.200 --> 3:02:16.800]  and could not comprehend at all was the state persecution against myself against my family
[3:02:16.800 --> 3:02:20.800]  so the state of chosen aside in this battle it's not the side of freedom and democracy it's the
[3:02:20.800 --> 3:02:26.880]  side of sharia and what can we do what can every one of us do it's our job to enlighten to wake people
[3:02:26.880 --> 3:02:31.360]  up to educate people i'm i'm grateful to your show alex i'm grateful to pull joseph watson
[3:02:31.360 --> 3:02:36.320]  he's changing the scene he's changed waking so many people up it's brilliant you're not a wrecking
[3:02:36.320 --> 3:02:42.960]  ball isn't it good to see that oh man man it's it's it's so i sit and get so much satisfaction
[3:02:42.960 --> 3:02:47.920]  because you have to understand that 10 years ago when i was doing this it was a lonely place
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:52.480]  it was a lonely place and now i'm seeing so many people waking so many people up that's all i see
[3:02:52.480 --> 3:02:57.200]  my job as my job is to what i don't talk about so i come on and debate people sometimes i've
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:03:02.640]  debated some expert on multiculturalism yeah he's a speechwriter for kofi hannon from the uu
[3:03:02.640 --> 3:03:06.160]  when i asked him i said where do you live yeah where are you from where are you born
[3:03:06.160 --> 3:03:12.640]  he's born when i got down to it 99.9 percent christian white area okay i'm born as a minority english
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:17.840]  man living in a town with 30 mosques that's right the rich liberals do not live around it you look
[3:03:17.840 --> 3:03:22.320]  where they all live when they lecture other people they're in they're in 99 wide areas
[3:03:23.120 --> 3:03:27.280]  these hollywood celebrities all of them all of them so it's what's good for us you don't
[3:03:27.280 --> 3:03:30.880]  understand what it's like for us you don't understand what you're doing to us you don't
[3:03:30.880 --> 3:03:35.280]  understand what you don't understand the fear i feel the gut wrenching fear in my belly for my
[3:03:35.280 --> 3:03:41.040]  children i've got three children and you are destroying and putting their safety and their
[3:03:41.040 --> 3:03:45.120]  freedom in jeopardy and i i that's why i always say if there's going to be trouble and there's
[3:03:45.120 --> 3:03:49.600]  going to be a struggle let me struggle don't let my son struggle and that's what they have to
[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:54.000]  understand what they're doing and they don't even they don't understand because i said i put it into
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:58.960]  two camps of people those who have been affected by islam and those who are yet to be affected by
[3:03:58.960 --> 3:04:03.920]  islam because one day they will and then they'll wake up and you know how many people i see contacting
[3:04:03.920 --> 3:04:08.560]  me in commenting saying that a year ago i thought you as a fascist a year ago i didn't believe you
[3:04:08.560 --> 3:04:13.200]  and now now you've woke me up you've woke me up that's our job and platforms like info wars
[3:04:13.200 --> 3:04:17.040]  platforms like rebel media these are the platforms that will wake the public up because

[3:08:08.800 --> 3:08:18.240]  joneshow with anthony koumia i'm about to go to anthony right now we have breaking news the same
[3:08:18.240 --> 3:08:22.400]  reporter that said they were wiretapping trump and then said it was insane they never did
[3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:30.160]  and matthew rozenberg who has all these obama sources saying they had all this proof that
[3:08:30.160 --> 3:08:34.320]  all these russians were running things they were illegally spying then they were illegally leaking
[3:08:34.960 --> 3:08:40.640]  so they said trump's insane we never spied he's totally crazy and then now they've come out and
[3:08:40.640 --> 3:08:44.240]  said oh actually we have all the proof we're gonna bring it out we were spying on them
[3:08:45.840 --> 3:08:49.120]  and then they act like nunez the head of the intelligence committee of the house did something
[3:08:49.120 --> 3:08:55.600]  wrong they've now outed the sources that trump has he was being spied on he's the president
[3:08:56.160 --> 3:08:59.840]  he can know everything he could talk to anybody he can talk to the damn russians
[3:08:59.840 --> 3:09:08.480]  or the eastern bunny if he wants to i mean this is just ezra koan wattnick and michael ellis
[3:09:09.840 --> 3:09:15.360]  and then the headline should be we just outed secret intel and committed more crimes but instead
[3:09:15.360 --> 3:09:21.040]  they say two white house officials help give nunez intelligence reports so because they were in
[3:09:21.040 --> 3:09:25.840]  intelligence agencies and already knew it it's bad that those intelligence reports came back to
[3:09:25.840 --> 3:09:35.200]  the president he's the president man i tell you uh this is all about just not able to cut our taxes
[3:09:35.200 --> 3:09:40.960]  not able to scare a border not able to get thanks alone to small businesses the best consumer

[3:10:00.640 --> 3:10:05.120]  a health care through when it took obama two years with his scam and and obama cares his fault
[3:10:05.120 --> 3:10:11.360]  and he's a bad person and we're gonna take the economy and the junker the heir of the biggest

[3:11:04.400 --> 3:11:09.520]  where the they're in the atlantic monthly the most elite publications saying overthrow trump violently
[3:11:11.280 --> 3:11:14.480]  trump and trump was a liquid strength as they'll say he's a fascist if he does
[3:11:15.040 --> 3:11:20.480]  if you're trying to overthrow the country and saying want to end a free press and all this crap
[3:11:21.280 --> 3:11:26.240]  it's the law i get it comey won't do anything because comey's this little establishment guy

[3:11:50.880 --> 3:11:57.280]  those but uh the point is is that i just this isn't about a radio show anymore i've always wanted
[3:11:57.280 --> 3:12:03.120]  freedom and i've always said what i believe but now it's so clear cut and i'm surprised trump
[3:12:03.120 --> 3:12:08.000]  to get anything done when they're in open rebellion i'm gonna turn it over to you it's just twilight
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:14.160]  zone to have the air of all the nazi loot they admit that the richest nazis i mean royalty
[3:12:14.160 --> 3:12:19.920]  let that they're gonna break us up if we don't let eu go around and keep the uk in that never
[3:12:19.920 --> 3:12:26.960]  voted to enter it i mean it's just it's so a nazi dictator a literal nazi who is the dictator of

[3:12:31.600 --> 3:12:38.080]  ass just fundamentally george soros is a nazi collaborator this guy's family it's like when
[3:12:38.080 --> 3:12:42.560]  do we get these people and then they call us nazis when we have nothing to do with nazis

[3:13:07.680 --> 3:13:12.640]  good at night but we don't want them to win folks you're the power of the listeners spread
[3:13:12.640 --> 3:13:17.120]  the link spread the articles don't stop don't give up and to the kumia
[3:13:21.120 --> 3:13:28.160]  it alex gets about this because you're dealing with your life here this is the our way of life
[3:13:28.640 --> 3:13:36.320]  that people are out to destroy and this is it i'm not speaking figuratively this is literally
[3:13:36.320 --> 3:13:42.000]  this is literally they are out to destroy it it's in the the uh media every day especially
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:49.040]  alternative media um i've noticed uh uh what what tom he was saying earlier was amazing tommy
[3:13:49.040 --> 3:13:58.480]  robinson um did you hear the the sheer panic in that man's voice this guy's not a uh you know
[3:13:58.480 --> 3:14:06.000]  he's he's not a sissy mary by the way but he is actually in fear for the livelihood of his
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:13.840]  children and his country because there is an invasion taking place an invasion and if you
[3:14:13.840 --> 3:14:20.960]  think people like uh uh uh yunkers of the european union uh don't want that to happen
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:28.960]  you're sadly mistaken we are at a point right now where uh it's imperative to uh make a distinction
[3:14:28.960 --> 3:14:36.320]  between the the sides in this there are people that want to continue with our american way of
[3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:42.880]  life our freedom uh the greatest country in the world and there are a group of people who want
[3:14:42.880 --> 3:14:50.080]  that destroyed eliminated from the face of the earth and uh and don't think they can't do it
[3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:56.640]  all all we have to do for them to succeed is do nothing and just let them continue
[3:14:56.640 --> 3:15:05.280]  to roll over us and uh uh keep this refugee invasion that's happening uh don't secure the
[3:15:05.280 --> 3:15:13.200]  borders uh don't enforce laws and that's all we have to do and if you see who's doing that
[3:15:13.200 --> 3:15:22.080]  you'll really get uh a good idea of who the culprits are when at every turn they are stopping
[3:15:22.080 --> 3:15:29.680]  our president from doing what he feels is best for this country uh at every turn they're stopping
[3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:38.640]  them how do you argue secure borders how do you argue it well it's it's obvious how you argue it
[3:15:38.640 --> 3:15:45.440]  you call anyone that wants a secure border a racist or a xenophobe or somebody who's not
[3:15:45.440 --> 3:15:51.120]  caring of people that need help uh you're spitting on the Statue of Liberty the whole
[3:15:51.120 --> 3:15:57.120]  country was made up of immigrants and it's all these are all the excuses they use because there is
[3:15:57.680 --> 3:16:08.640]  actually no real uh uh honest way to say you don't want secure borders it's counterintuitive
[3:16:08.640 --> 3:16:15.040]  to a safe secure nation but you can't say that so they use other ways and the media
[3:16:15.040 --> 3:16:23.040]  uh the media they're their their mouthpieces they will spread this and you will be afraid
[3:16:23.040 --> 3:16:30.720]  i know people i i am around a lot of people in the comedy industry and uh they're petrified
[3:16:30.720 --> 3:16:37.520]  these are comedians their job is to go into a club have people come in that know where they're
[3:16:37.520 --> 3:16:42.560]  going they know they're going into a comedy club it's not a it's it doesn't they bank
[3:16:42.560 --> 3:16:47.120]  it doesn't say doctor's office and then you get in and a comedian starts talking to you oh
[3:16:47.760 --> 3:16:54.560]  what happened he said i'm so offended it's comedy club and you go in these comedians
[3:16:54.560 --> 3:17:03.760]  are scared out of their minds they're petrified of saying the wrong thing why because the right
[3:17:03.760 --> 3:17:10.400]  because conservatives or conservatives have been the targets of comedians for years and
[3:17:10.400 --> 3:17:19.440]  they really uh don't react they might get offended but they don't mobilize to shut people's freedom
[3:17:19.440 --> 3:17:28.160]  of speech down but the left oh my goodness the progressive left the left who actually spawned
[3:17:28.160 --> 3:17:36.160]  some of these amazing comedians of yesteryear george carlin and uh red fox years ago and eddie
[3:17:36.160 --> 3:17:46.240]  murphy uh uh all these amazing comics that used to be politically incorrect for their day uh
[3:17:46.240 --> 3:17:51.520]  thou the liberals are trying to shut them down to the point where they know these comics know
[3:17:51.520 --> 3:17:57.680]  if they say the wrong thing if they're next to someone that says the wrong thing there's
[3:17:57.680 --> 3:18:03.600]  guilt by association the level of fascism and i do use the word fascism because that's what
[3:18:03.600 --> 3:18:11.200]  we're seeing uh these people that are supposedly anti fascists are absolute fascists they're the
[3:18:11.200 --> 3:18:18.160]  ones that don't want people to be heard and and it goes right from uh the highest level of politics
[3:18:18.160 --> 3:18:24.080]  the president of the united states to the lowest level of a comedy club a comedian trying to do
[3:18:24.080 --> 3:18:32.160]  commentary a humorous commentary on on the world today and even they're being told that their
[3:18:32.160 --> 3:18:38.320]  material is offensive and shouldn't be said and jokes shouldn't be made about that topic
[3:18:38.320 --> 3:18:45.760]  or this topic and it's all part of the greater uh issue here changing the american way of life
[3:18:46.400 --> 3:18:53.840]  and uh when you see people trying to shut down other people's freedom of speech that's a biggie
[3:18:54.400 --> 3:19:01.120]  that's numero uno on our uh a bill of rights there and uh they're trying to shut it down
[3:19:01.120 --> 3:19:07.840]  and if you don't think so look what happens at uc berkeley uh with mylo look what happened with
[3:19:07.840 --> 3:19:14.720]  gavin mckinnis at nyu and then uh when we come back in a couple of minutes i want to talk about
[3:19:14.720 --> 3:19:19.280]  you know anthony we're just going to skip the break we i'm here okay we might even have a show
[3:19:19.280 --> 3:19:24.320]  soon the way this is all gone let's just skip the network breaks i got you short thing uh and
[3:19:24.320 --> 3:19:30.720]  colter and colter is supposed to be uh visiting uc berkeley and organizers are uh they they're
[3:19:30.720 --> 3:19:38.320]  fearing another backlash well let me tell you guaranteed there will be a giant backlash uh
[3:19:38.320 --> 3:19:48.560]  people will resort to violence vandalism assaults to prevent the wonderful people of berkeley
[3:19:48.560 --> 3:19:55.520]  from hearing anything and colter has to say because they have determined they have determined
[3:19:55.520 --> 3:20:00.560]  what you should or shouldn't hear isn't that nice if anthony does it that show us i just can't help
[3:20:00.560 --> 3:20:03.920]  but i'm here watching what they can't that shows what they're going to do with the internet and
[3:20:03.920 --> 3:20:08.240]  they're now trying to do it by stealth so let me ask you this question our audiences get bigger all
[3:20:08.240 --> 3:20:12.560]  the time yours does it compound media we're doing an info wars but at the same time congress should
[3:20:12.560 --> 3:20:16.800]  do something the the president should this is like organized racketeering with them rubbing
[3:20:16.800 --> 3:20:21.840]  their hands together in the media saying that we're killing the mainstream media shut down
[3:20:21.840 --> 3:20:26.400]  their competition how obvious is that and are they are they biting on more than they could
[3:20:26.400 --> 3:20:31.520]  chew because if they try to ban us like the sex pistols it doesn't work doesn't it just make
[3:20:31.520 --> 3:20:38.400]  compound media dot com bigger uh absolutely it does but here's the fear that i think we we all
[3:20:38.400 --> 3:20:45.680]  have that are doing uh shows like this uh we have to have a pipeline to get our our message out to
[3:20:45.680 --> 3:20:51.760]  the people and if the powers that be grab a hold of that pipeline and regulate it to the point
[3:20:51.760 --> 3:20:58.160]  where we're not allowed to say certain things we uh we have to uh you know play by the rules uh
[3:20:58.160 --> 3:21:01.680]  we're like an internet kill switch selective internet kill switch and then if you follow
[3:21:01.680 --> 3:21:06.480]  the rules we've all experienced it oh the rules get more every day oh sorry now you can say nothing
[3:21:07.280 --> 3:21:13.920]  right it's it's all the the more regulation we get the more people that want uh uh uh uh
[3:21:13.920 --> 3:21:20.240]  dissenting opinions eliminated and and when they're in the seats of power uh we're gonna have to
[3:21:20.240 --> 3:21:26.960]  find something else and um you know this is the most open and honest forum that we have right now
[3:21:26.960 --> 3:21:33.360]  mainstream media is they've gone from lying i've noticed this too especially with the russia uh
[3:21:34.080 --> 3:21:41.120]  the russia stories and and the wiretapping and surveillance stories on um president trump um
[3:21:41.120 --> 3:21:47.520]  i've noticed the news now it's very hard for them to just outright lie uh because we're on to them
[3:21:47.520 --> 3:21:53.120]  now they're confusing the issue so much that on a daily basis somebody that pays attention
[3:21:53.120 --> 3:21:59.760]  to the news like myself is confused as all hell oh here's an example what's going on google and
[3:21:59.760 --> 3:22:03.760]  sorrows are behind fake news internet privacy the republicans didn't vote to get rid of internet
[3:22:03.760 --> 3:22:09.440]  privacy that's just a subsection they called it net neutrality under obama it was an FCC which
[3:22:09.440 --> 3:22:15.920]  you've enjoyed takeover of the entire internet spectrum and they said no to that but they called
[3:22:15.920 --> 3:22:21.120]  it net neutrality so now the republicans killed net neutrality no they didn't it's all just deception
[3:22:21.120 --> 3:22:26.560]  but but you're right they just mislabel they scramble things it's crazy everything on a daily
[3:22:26.560 --> 3:22:33.680]  basis you could read or watch uh mainstream media and absolutely believe based on what you're reading
[3:22:33.680 --> 3:22:42.480]  that trump and uh his cohorts absolutely had uh inappropriate contacts with russia uh to uh kind
[3:22:42.480 --> 3:22:49.760]  of uh win a win the election or from the same mainstream media no one ever spoke to any russians
[3:22:49.760 --> 3:22:54.320]  and there's no evidence that that ever happened the same thing with the surveillance there were
[3:22:54.320 --> 3:23:00.400]  absolutely people surveilling from the obama obama administration on uh president uh trump
[3:23:00.400 --> 3:23:05.280]  and before he was president and then absolutely no evidence that that ever happened yeah so what do
[3:23:05.280 --> 3:23:09.840]  you think the tactic is someone asked your smart media guy where they go in the same breath that
[3:23:09.840 --> 3:23:14.160]  they have this former deputy defense head on and she's like oh of course we were spying on him and
[3:23:14.160 --> 3:23:18.560]  we have the russian contacts the privilege should release it but he's insane no one was spying on
[3:23:18.560 --> 3:23:22.240]  and you're like you just said you were but you won't produce it because the word is there's
[3:23:22.240 --> 3:23:26.880]  nothing there it's like it's like it's like the death of logic but it's like they're doing it on
[3:23:26.880 --> 3:23:32.400]  purpose like they're trying to kill logic yes anthony what are they doing it you're absolutely
[3:23:32.400 --> 3:23:37.600]  right alex they are doing this on purpose don't be fooled don't be fooled these mainstream media
[3:23:37.600 --> 3:23:43.280]  they're not a bunch of morons in there running things they have an agenda and their agenda now
[3:23:43.280 --> 3:23:48.480]  it used to be a lie they could get away with it they have this plausible deniability years ago
[3:23:48.480 --> 3:23:54.400]  during the course of this past election they expose themselves to being the liars and shills
[3:23:54.400 --> 3:24:00.560]  that they have been nothing to lose they yeah so now they're changing their tack a little bit
[3:24:00.560 --> 3:24:06.800]  what they're doing now is throwing out so much misinformation that everyone's confused so on
[3:24:06.800 --> 3:24:12.160]  a daily basis you might hear something and then something that directly contradicts what you just
[3:24:12.160 --> 3:24:17.520]  heard it takes more work now as americans that want to remain so you're a news channel so we're
[3:24:17.520 --> 3:24:22.240]  in the same boat i'm the same way now it takes me longer because i'll see the most crazy crap
[3:24:22.240 --> 3:24:28.240]  yes and it's like they know they have nothing to lose i'm sorry to interrupt you but let me
[3:24:28.240 --> 3:24:30.960]  just say this right now let me just say this and then i'm gonna get out of here let me just say
[3:24:30.960 --> 3:24:36.080]  this right now i heartfelt we're in the fight we're winning they were censoring me and i was
[3:24:36.080 --> 3:24:41.520]  getting shut down i got families have to do whatever i you know whatever i go sell cars the point is
[3:24:41.520 --> 3:24:47.760]  is that around our ranch or whatever but they're so evil they're so corrupt i personally invested
[3:24:47.760 --> 3:24:53.040]  in it i know everybody else is and then all people know they're really kicked us off ad role
[3:24:53.040 --> 3:24:57.680]  five million dollars a year they really are saying in the news shut us down completely
[3:24:57.680 --> 3:25:01.440]  they're really saying i'm a russian agent with no proof saying arrest me in congressional hearings
[3:25:01.440 --> 3:25:04.800]  but i can't be at those they're really you've already been kicked off all these stations when
[3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:08.640]  you were number one you were kicked off for criticizing uh the whole black lives matter
[3:25:08.640 --> 3:25:12.080]  kill the cop crap that's what you were fired for people don't know top number one show
[3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:17.600]  norris number two after how we're sitting on xm they're so pissed and so let's say how do people
[3:25:17.600 --> 3:25:21.920]  support compound media because maybe they shut me down maybe they shut you down first we have to
[3:25:21.920 --> 3:25:26.000]  hop scotch back over to the outlets that are there that are so precious drudge report whatever
[3:25:26.000 --> 3:25:30.320]  that's how we're gonna beat them and so their safety in numbers how do we support compound
[3:25:30.320 --> 3:25:36.000]  media dot com how do we support info wars dot com how do people realize how important this is
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:43.680]  yeah it really is imperative that people get on board because uh uh there's no true uh
[3:25:43.680 --> 3:25:49.440]  honest information getting out there it's so convoluted so mixed up and that is the mission
[3:25:49.440 --> 3:25:54.400]  to make it harder for the american people to get the truth i said george soros yesterday
[3:25:54.400 --> 3:25:59.440]  is an enemy of jews and rounded him up and he's part of this evil jewish right weird leftist
[3:25:59.440 --> 3:26:03.040]  mafia that feeds on jews they have articles out saying i'm anti-semitic because i don't
[3:26:03.040 --> 3:26:11.040]  like a nazi what the hell it's how much more backwards can things get and we we're supposed
[3:26:11.040 --> 3:26:15.920]  to read that and go all that makes sense no it doesn't make sense and you're supposed to read it
[3:26:15.920 --> 3:26:22.400]  and go why are they feeding me misinformation i need to dig deeper get alternative sources
[3:26:22.400 --> 3:26:28.960]  and disseminate it myself using my own mind and and uh various so people with your show gavin

[3:28:50.080 --> 3:28:53.760]  shut up let you come back but that's the answer is fighting back we had our fighting spirit we
[3:28:53.760 --> 3:28:57.520]  won with trump right but we're not we will live our lives we're not trying to run stuff like the
[3:28:57.520 --> 3:29:01.680]  globalists and leftists sorry folks we're either gonna take it back or they're gonna run our lives
[3:29:01.680 --> 3:29:07.280]  we have to do it we have to go on total political war path and that means spreading the word doing

[3:32:47.440 --> 3:32:53.920]  star in alex jones charlie daniels special ops general jerry boykin want to shed some tears over
[3:32:53.920 --> 3:32:58.800]  the red white and blue revelations the movie dot info let's fix it
[3:33:07.920 --> 3:33:14.880]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:14.880 --> 3:33:26.400]  and now your host anthony koumia maybe a bad bad thing maybe thank you um we were talking
[3:33:26.400 --> 3:33:32.560]  before the break about an colter uh going to uc berkeley i guess uh in a month about a month
[3:33:32.560 --> 3:33:40.240]  and they're worried about a backlash uh concerned they're they're fearing this is a guaranteed event
[3:33:40.240 --> 3:33:48.160]  this will they guarantee i guarantee there will be violence vandalism and assaults that will happen
[3:33:48.160 --> 3:33:53.520]  on the part of the people that do not want and colter to speak just for the fact that
[3:33:53.520 --> 3:34:01.600]  they don't want you to hear what she has to say they have deemed uh they have deemed themselves
[3:34:01.600 --> 3:34:11.280]  protectors of your uh fragile sensibilities and perhaps your eardrums um and this is the left
[3:34:11.840 --> 3:34:19.040]  like we would call it the progressive uh opened left um so progressive that they
[3:34:19.840 --> 3:34:27.360]  literally will use violence to shut down uh somebody from speaking uh we saw it happen with
[3:34:27.360 --> 3:34:35.920]  milo at uh berkeley we saw it happen with gavin mckinnis at uh nyu and again and colt and colter
[3:34:36.960 --> 3:34:44.320]  is more despised by the left than milo and you saw what happened there so now they're
[3:34:44.320 --> 3:34:52.240]  fearing this will there be a police presence in enough numbers to shut down any violence
[3:34:52.240 --> 3:34:58.480]  that is trying to infringe on people's first amendment rights will there be or will it be
[3:34:58.480 --> 3:35:04.240]  another uh dog and pony show where they stand around because they've been given that directive
[3:35:04.240 --> 3:35:08.880]  believe me i know enough police officers to know that they would love to run in there and crack
[3:35:08.880 --> 3:35:14.160]  their heads open uh but you know they have bosses and their bosses have bosses and it goes all the
[3:35:14.160 --> 3:35:23.200]  way up to the uh lousy uh liberal power base over there in berkeley and they're always told to
[3:35:23.200 --> 3:35:30.480]  take it easy observe maybe uh try to keep some people apart but when the the violence happens
[3:35:30.480 --> 3:35:36.960]  where are they these people are going around smashing uh others property assaulting people
[3:35:36.960 --> 3:35:45.280]  uh all in the name of anti fascism again when me and alex were talking uh just earlier
[3:35:46.000 --> 3:35:56.880]  the idea that their anti fascists yet their fascists is something so 2017 and um the idea
[3:35:57.440 --> 3:36:03.680]  like alex was saying that he was being called anti-semitic for pointing out that a literal nazi
[3:36:03.680 --> 3:36:12.560]  is uh yeah fbi allegedly investigating mayor of berkeley for inciting riot and ordering police
[3:36:12.560 --> 3:36:21.360]  to stand down cnn doing damage control this is happening this is what's happening they
[3:36:21.360 --> 3:36:29.280]  aren't letting the police do their jobs based on nothing but their political agenda that can't
[3:36:29.280 --> 3:36:39.520]  happen that is is is a an offense that should be uh looked at and taken care of with um extreme
[3:36:39.520 --> 3:36:46.800]  prejudice i think if you have a a um an official like the mayor telling the police not to do their
[3:36:46.800 --> 3:36:53.360]  job because you don't agree with what the speaker was going to say and and the people that are trying
[3:36:53.360 --> 3:37:01.840]  to um to stop the person from speaking uh you give them free rein to wreak havoc on the area
[3:37:01.840 --> 3:37:09.040]  you that's criminal that's criminal should be put in jail for that and meanwhile we're
[3:37:09.040 --> 3:37:14.000]  going to see it happen again i don't see i i will look at this story and culture to visit
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:20.160]  you see berkeley and i absolutely can predict the future i know what's going to happen here
[3:37:20.160 --> 3:37:30.480]  here violence vandalism and assaults uh because that's the new that's the new normal uh the
[3:37:30.480 --> 3:37:39.200]  progressives have used violence uh for years and now uh in order to keep people from giving
[3:37:39.200 --> 3:37:48.400]  an opposing viewpoint they will um injure and destroy um i played a video clip the other
[3:37:48.400 --> 3:37:54.000]  day i i don't know if we have it or i added it in today i think for uh my show later garret
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:38:03.600]  it's uh a guy and he's uh he's he's filming people with his iphone and they don't even want him
[3:38:03.600 --> 3:38:12.320]  asking them questions do you have that one i i hope so i think it was um from uh the bunch of clips
[3:38:12.320 --> 3:38:18.800]  i sent you at about about an hour ago i'm not sure if you find it you do if not i mean we've
[3:38:18.800 --> 3:38:25.200]  seen it all before it's a gentleman walking amongst the big group of these uh progressive left uh
[3:38:25.200 --> 3:38:33.840]  butterflies and um he's asking them questions he's got the his phone and they are just calling him a
[3:38:33.840 --> 3:38:40.480]  nazi and a fascist for doing nothing more than asking questions you can't even you're not even
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:44.800]  allowed to do that anymore without being tagged and labeled because that's what they do they don't
[3:38:44.800 --> 3:38:51.680]  have a valid argument they don't have a valid argument so you will be labeled something that
[3:38:51.680 --> 3:38:58.640]  they don't even want to look at or speak to you discuss them you're a racist you're sexist you're
[3:38:58.640 --> 3:39:04.080]  homophobic they'll slap the tag on you so now they don't have to argue with you now they don't have
[3:39:04.080 --> 3:39:11.040]  to listen to your valid points that you're making because you're so repulsive you don't even deserve
[3:39:11.040 --> 3:39:18.800]  to be conversed with that's their that's their tactic because they they can't debate what you're
[3:39:18.800 --> 3:39:26.800]  saying because it's based on such common sense let's have strong borders racist oh well i just
[3:39:26.800 --> 3:39:33.920]  want to talk about it's illegal i'm not arguing with you i've already labeled you a racist oh okay
[3:39:33.920 --> 3:39:40.880]  i guess i'll leave but this has been going on now for for quite a while and again escalates to the
[3:39:40.880 --> 3:39:48.480]  point of of violence another wonderful thing that's happening here in this country and it is
[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:53.040]  like you can't just look at things on the surface you got to look a little deeper and see what the
[3:39:53.040 --> 3:40:00.240]  motivation here is now obviously with these open borders that we have and and refugees pouring in
[3:40:00.240 --> 3:40:08.880]  from uh middle eastern war torn nations that uh are very hard to vet um you you have refugees
[3:40:08.880 --> 3:40:16.080]  coming in so now what should the people that want refugees coming in this slow invasion of our our
[3:40:16.080 --> 3:40:24.880]  nation uh what could they possibly do well they have to make you familiar with uh islam they have
[3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:33.200]  to make it safe and they have to uh embrace it to show how wonderful it is so uh women here in
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:41.120]  the united states feminists especially are using islamic dress we're covering up covering their
[3:40:41.120 --> 3:40:51.280]  heads and faces as get get this i'm not kidding you as a a salute to women and feminism they're
[3:40:51.280 --> 3:41:04.880]  wearing islamic garb the the most oppressive type of of religion you could put on somebody
[3:41:05.680 --> 3:41:13.760]  is being an islamic woman um and and having to dress in that garb cover up i don't know how
[3:41:13.760 --> 3:41:20.480]  this translates to feminism uh but it's to familiarize to make it seem okay so the people
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:30.320]  that bite on all of these uh hollywood types that are uh so so um they they love telling us how we
[3:41:30.320 --> 3:41:36.240]  should live our lives from from hollywood from bevelly hills or beller they love telling us
[3:41:36.240 --> 3:41:42.400]  how we should be living our lives so you get someone like alicia keys it was um showing how
[3:41:42.400 --> 3:41:51.120]  how much of a proud woman she is and uh how great this diversity is in our country by
[3:41:51.120 --> 3:42:01.280]  actually dressing up in islamic garb right there yet showing she's got a little sass to her she's
[3:42:01.280 --> 3:42:08.720]  gonna poke a leg out there a stem a gam she's gonna poke it out from under there our strength
[3:42:08.720 --> 3:42:15.520]  our strength is in our differences our power is in our diversity we are so beautiful all of us
[3:42:15.520 --> 3:42:21.920]  when we see each other we see ourselves we're all the same we're all the same see she's the same
[3:42:21.920 --> 3:42:28.400]  right there as a woman over in the middle east where except all right for the fact that if you
[3:42:28.400 --> 3:42:34.880]  were in the middle east and you poked your leg out they'd probably chop it off yes and as you
[3:42:34.880 --> 3:42:41.280]  lay bleeding in the street perhaps you should be stoned to death um how they twist these things
[3:42:41.280 --> 3:42:48.560]  around with complete false it's fake they're telling you they're giving you such misinformation
[3:42:48.560 --> 3:42:55.840]  to get their false narrative across here you go how about one of these gals pokes her leg out
[3:42:56.720 --> 3:43:02.000]  like alicia keys did because we're all the same and everything's fine and diversity is wonderful
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:07.840]  how about that you would see what amounts to a religious police they have that in many of
[3:43:07.840 --> 3:43:14.400]  these countries south of arabia there's one and here you go air that's what there's feminism
[3:43:15.040 --> 3:43:22.640]  right get dressed just like her and know what feminism is like that man is literally hitting
[3:43:22.640 --> 3:43:29.840]  women with a stick to get them to capitulate what were they doing was that a line to get into
[3:43:29.840 --> 3:43:34.800]  someplace i don't even know what it was but i'll tell you one thing didn't look very feminist
[3:43:36.080 --> 3:43:44.800]  i'd tell you what try doing that here uh and why why is it embraced you can't take something
[3:43:45.440 --> 3:43:55.760]  so anti-feminist as islam and then just dress up here in the united states pop your leg out
[3:43:55.760 --> 3:44:05.120]  out and say see look we're all we're all the same we're all great diversity blah blah uh yeah you
[3:44:05.120 --> 3:44:15.760]  would be you would be um beaten and most likely killed uh gay people too have a this weird you
[3:44:15.760 --> 3:44:22.240]  know let in the refugee they have a rainbow signs i'll just say refugees welcome we're all you know
[3:44:22.240 --> 3:44:29.920]  trumps a monster uh united states the land of the free home and and not realizing i think
[3:44:30.720 --> 3:44:38.000]  more than their intolerance for women is their intolerance intolerance for gays uh in islam
[3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:43.920]  it's not looked at like something that they want to accept they are again literally throwing people
[3:44:43.920 --> 3:44:55.520]  off the rooftops uh because they're gay uh so to use islam as some type of um representation of
[3:44:55.520 --> 3:45:06.880]  tolerance and of feminism and the gay community welcoming them over is so suicidal it's a suicidal
[3:45:06.880 --> 3:45:14.160]  mentality that that yeah there you go there's some gruesome images of isis uh terrorist hurling a
[3:45:14.160 --> 3:45:20.000]  man from the rooftop for being gay uh that's how they deal look at the pile of rocks waiting
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:24.720]  i guess if he lands and he's still moving you got to throw rocks at him because you know
[3:45:24.720 --> 3:45:30.640]  it's the 21st century that we're living in so that's what you want to do why can't we just
[3:45:30.640 --> 3:45:37.520]  look at it for what it is and understand there's grave intolerance there instead of instead of
[3:45:37.520 --> 3:45:42.240]  getting on people and calling people intolerant that want to uh close our borders up tighten them up
[3:45:42.960 --> 3:45:48.240]  and look into who's coming over here especially from these savage nations in the middle east
[3:45:48.960 --> 3:45:58.800]  uh yet wear the problem for even suggesting it um it's a topsy turvy world it's crazy
[3:45:58.800 --> 3:46:06.480]  and the political correctness that we just latch on to here is going to kill people it has already
[3:46:06.480 --> 3:46:13.040]  it has already when you look at uh the instances of police officers being killed in the united
[3:46:13.040 --> 3:46:18.640]  states gun down for nothing more than being police officers because the media in their
[3:46:18.640 --> 3:46:23.840]  political correctness went with this narrative that police officers are shooting and killing
[3:46:23.840 --> 3:46:31.360]  young black men at random that uh was then pumped up by the media and now you have people
[3:46:31.360 --> 3:46:37.040]  that think they actually are in a war with the police and they kill police officers they are
[3:46:37.040 --> 3:46:46.240]  absolutely causing people to die with their political correctness and um lies to perpetuate
[3:46:46.240 --> 3:46:58.320]  a lot of these stories uh the uh tsa the tsa is out of their minds uh i i believe in profiling
[3:46:58.960 --> 3:47:05.360]  it has been used successfully in many uh law enforcement agencies uh the first thing they'll
[3:47:05.360 --> 3:47:13.280]  do when they're trying to find a a killer uh especially um a serial killer a spree killer uh
[3:47:13.280 --> 3:47:23.520]  is profile you want to narrow down here's what profiling does it narrows down your pool of people
[3:47:23.520 --> 3:47:30.880]  you have to look into why look at a group of a thousand people if by profiling i can narrow
[3:47:30.880 --> 3:47:41.280]  it down to 10 people it just makes perfect sense profiling has become a nasty word akin to a racial
[3:47:41.280 --> 3:47:52.480]  slur or a homophobic epithet or a misogynistic slur it's just becomes something that's terrible
[3:47:52.480 --> 3:48:00.960]  profiling it's a tool it's a tool that is used to narrow down a group of people that you need to
[3:48:00.960 --> 3:48:08.800]  look into uh the tsa knows nothing of this when we travel we like to think we're safe profiling
[3:48:08.800 --> 3:48:17.520]  would help they in in a stunning video you see a tsa agent pawing pawing over a 13 year old boy
[3:48:18.160 --> 3:48:29.040]  who uh is wearing shorts and a t-shirt not even shoes there what could he possibly be hiding uh
[3:48:29.040 --> 3:48:37.200]  that could endanger the flight he is ready to get on yet time energies resources are being wasted
[3:48:37.200 --> 3:48:45.040]  searching this poor kid who i i am calling it molestation by the way he is being molested
[3:48:45.680 --> 3:48:55.120]  in front of a room full of people uh look at this for what this kid wouldn't make the
[3:48:55.120 --> 3:49:02.720]  thousandth cut in profiling who is dangerous when you're traveling you would if you had a
[3:49:02.720 --> 3:49:07.440]  thousand people he would be the first person you you shove out of the room if you had 10
[3:49:07.440 --> 3:49:12.720]  thousand people he'd be the first person you shove out of the room he's not who we're looking for
[3:49:13.600 --> 3:49:20.800]  why waste the time why uh traumatize a kid by having some old tsa agent pawing over him
[3:49:22.080 --> 3:49:27.920]  like that it's a waste of time it does nothing to make us safe and it's based on nothing but
[3:49:27.920 --> 3:49:34.960]  political correctness and appeasing groups that are responsible for terrorism are responsible
[3:49:34.960 --> 3:49:42.800]  for death and destruction here in this country and overseas and we can't look specifically at
[3:49:42.800 --> 3:49:50.880]  those people based on where they're from uh yes nationality just as when they profile a serial
[3:49:50.880 --> 3:49:58.480]  killer it's usually a white guy that's all we're getting a white male uh in his between 30s and
[3:49:58.480 --> 3:50:04.400]  they're at 50 and he's probably from this area but there's a whole profile that's worked up
[3:50:05.200 --> 3:50:11.040]  well let's look at terrorists let's look at who has been trying to take down airplanes
[3:50:11.040 --> 3:50:16.000]  who has been running people over with trucks uh machine gunning people stabbing people
[3:50:16.000 --> 3:50:23.600]  who's been doing the the terrorism in in the world for the past 40 years
[3:50:25.280 --> 3:50:34.720]  it's it's radical islamic terrorists does that kid really fit that bill does that poor molested
[3:50:34.720 --> 3:50:43.120]  child fit the the bill do you feel safer because that tsa agent spent two full minutes pawing
[3:50:43.120 --> 3:50:52.480]  through that kid's clothing it is the twilight song a bizarre place pitiful tortures of a child
[3:50:52.480 --> 3:51:03.200]  molested at the tsa complete insanity extendivite really worked just listen to what some people
