[00:00.000 --> 00:24.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.000]  It's Friday, August 6th.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  The year is 2021.
[00:33.000 --> 00:40.000]  And across the planet, permanent martial law is being established.
[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  The chains are going on.
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  Lockdown 2 is being incrementally activated in the United States
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  and in many areas of the world was never removed.
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.000]  And I've said this many times, each new broadcast we engage in
[00:59.000 --> 01:01.000]  is going to be more important and more extreme than last
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  because those are the times we live in.
[01:03.000 --> 01:07.000]  But this information now in front of us is 100% documented,
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  completely clear and is very paradoxical.
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  Very paradoxical because it is actually the National Health Services
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  that are reporting the data
[01:22.000 --> 01:26.000]  and it's completely being ignored by the media
[01:26.000 --> 01:28.000]  and they continue to move forward with it.
[01:28.000 --> 01:29.000]  And what am I talking about?
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  It's just dumb founding.
[01:32.000 --> 01:36.000]  They'd be like if they were on national TV saying 2 plus 2 equals 7.
[01:36.000 --> 01:37.000]  And then tomorrow it equals 10.
[01:37.000 --> 01:38.000]  The next day it equals 1.
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  You're like, no, it equals 4.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  Now we knew this months ago and we got data here, data there,
[01:45.000 --> 01:46.000]  but now it's confirmed.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  Remember Israel three weeks ago said,
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  we're getting new breakthrough cases and people that are vaccinated.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  Then they said, yeah, the majority of people that are really sick
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000]  have had the inoculation.
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.000]  And then other countries reported the same thing all over the world,
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.000]  same numbers.
[02:06.000 --> 02:09.000]  First 75% of our new cases are vaccinated.
[02:09.000 --> 02:11.000]  Then it's 85, then 90.
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  It's now 100% in major countries.
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.000]  I've got it right here.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  Hospitalized and dying.
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  Now remember what did Fauci say three weeks ago?
[02:21.000 --> 02:27.000]  100% or 99% of the people sick or dying didn't have the shot.
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.000]  And you just heard that lie and Congress said,
[02:30.000 --> 02:31.000]  where's the numbers on that?
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.000]  You don't get them.
[02:35.000 --> 02:37.000]  Put your mask back on.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  Take the shot.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  It's like Chucky, I got my shot.
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  I got my shot for you.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  FDA approved.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  He said, no, it's not yet.
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  Take it.
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  And look at these headlines.
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.000]  This is out of National Australian News,
[02:57.000 --> 03:01.000]  WSAU, Sydney, Australia.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  All new COVID hospitalizations
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  involve vaccinated individuals except one.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  And that came out weeks ago.
[03:12.000 --> 03:13.000]  New numbers are out.
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  It's now 100%.
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  They've had 10 deaths in the last eight months.
[03:17.000 --> 03:18.000]  They still keep the country locked down.
[03:18.000 --> 03:25.000]  Now here's the new one out of Israel that I'm going to play right now.
[03:25.000 --> 03:26.000]  It's clip 13.
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  This is their national news.
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  Dr. Kobe Heavy announcing that they are opening more COVID wards,
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  not COVID wards, for the inoculated.
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  And he says 95% of the severe patients are vaccinated.
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  And they spend that to go, oh, it's the Delta variant.
[03:45.000 --> 03:46.000]  Oh, yeah.
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  Yeah, that Delta variant sure seems to target people.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  Took the shot.
[03:51.000 --> 03:52.000]  Uh-huh.
[03:52.000 --> 03:53.000]  Sure.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  Pull that out of your rear end.
[03:55.000 --> 03:56.000]  Oh, yeah.
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  The Delta variant only gets you if you take the shot.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  It's called spike protein.
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  Oh, you're very sick now.
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  Let me go back to my laboratory where we tortured dogs to death.
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  Oh, babies.
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.000]  Oh, came out yesterday.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  We keep babies alive.
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  Fauci does while we get the organs.
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  Uh, a Fauci.
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  We're going to come back and play all that for you.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  I mean, it's just all a freak show.
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  Oh, it's the Delta variant.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  We got another shot for you.
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  And then they admit in the literature a year and a half ago,
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  they'll be need for more shots.
[04:40.000 --> 04:46.000]  I mean, they'll be a special booster because they can get away
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  with killing you en masse with the shots.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  Well, they're not even more for you.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  Not more for you.
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.000]  I love my laboratories where we torture beagles to death, though.
[04:57.000 --> 05:02.000]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell.
[05:02.000 --> 05:06.000]  And I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through
[05:09.000 --> 05:13.000]  in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[05:21.000 --> 05:26.000]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  on my new platform, frankspeech.com.
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to frankspeech.com now.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  To help support this cyber symposium event,
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products,
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  but they're only offered at frankspeech.com.

[06:11.000 --> 06:16.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[06:16.000 --> 06:23.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios,
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[06:25.000 --> 06:33.000]  Well, all over the world in the most vaccinated countries,
[06:33.000 --> 06:35.000]  in fact, if you look at all the big travel advisories
[06:35.000 --> 06:37.000]  of where the U.S. citizens shouldn't go
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.000]  with the highest, quote, COVID levels and illnesses,
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  why it's the people that have had the injections.
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  All COVID cases with hospitalization in Australia have had the inoculation.
[06:49.000 --> 06:53.000]  All except one.
[06:53.000 --> 06:58.000]  Israel is reporting officially 95% of those in the hospital
[06:58.000 --> 07:03.000]  with serious cases have had the shot.
[07:03.000 --> 07:07.000]  Gee, this snake bit me and I got sick.
[07:07.000 --> 07:10.000]  The snake must have poisoned in its fangs.
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.000]  If I walked over to you and hit you in the head with a baseball bat
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  and you got a subdermal hematoma and a concussion,
[07:17.000 --> 07:20.000]  you wouldn't go, gee, wonder what gave me that
[07:20.000 --> 07:21.000]  when the police got there.
[07:21.000 --> 07:24.000]  You'd say he hit me in the head with a baseball bat.
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  I'm dying. I need brain surgery.
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  But we sit here and go, oh, oh, it's the Delta variant.
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  Oh, yes.
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  So then the Delta variant only attacks those that are inoculated, right?
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  No, it's the vaccine doing it.
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  That's not even two plus two equals four, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:44.000 --> 07:49.000]  A lobotomized three-year-old could understand that.
[07:49.000 --> 07:53.000]  But we as a culture, including even Rand Paul,
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.000]  supposedly hardcore against these guys or DeSantis,
[07:56.000 --> 07:57.000]  where are they?
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.000]  They still just go along with the vaccine.
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.000]  So they vaccinate Florida and they've got a bunch of sick people now,
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  almost all vaccinated.
[08:03.000 --> 08:06.000]  And I saw DeSantis last night going, the numbers are clear.
[08:06.000 --> 08:10.000]  It's the unvaccinated that are getting sick. Bull crap.
[08:10.000 --> 08:13.000]  Yes, there are some people getting sick from the vaccinated
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.000]  because it's shedding and Pfizer and Moderna admit it sheds.
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  That's all admitted in their own studies.
[08:20.000 --> 08:23.000]  But the really, really, really, really sick people,
[08:23.000 --> 08:28.000]  95% of them Israel say, of the serious hospitalizations.
[08:28.000 --> 08:29.000]  What's that again?
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  95%.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  Oh, what's the numbers I talked about last week out of Gibraltar,
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.000]  out of Singapore, out of Iceland?
[08:36.000 --> 08:41.000]  75% to 98% inoculation rates
[08:41.000 --> 08:45.000]  and 75% to 90 plus percent of the hospitalized people
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  took the damn shot.
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  Country after country after country.
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  You know, again, we got John the boom operator over.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  It was a great job, the camera guy.
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  I would not do this, but you know, it's an analogy.
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  But again, if we got John out here in the middle of the floor
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  and poured gasoline over him like a Buddhist monk
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  protesting the Vietnam War and he let himself on fire,
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  he's going to really get hurt bad, probably die.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  We're going to wish he was dead.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  Now, did the gasoline light him on fire?
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  Can we show the famous Buddhist monk
[09:16.000 --> 09:18.000]  sets himself on fire in Vietnam?
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  Famous photo, Buddhist monk, Vietnam will pull it up.
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  Just took a little, yes, he took about a pint of gasoline,
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  put it on himself, let himself on fire, he died.
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  Meditated for about three minutes while he burned to death.
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.000]  Now, did the gasoline kill the Buddhist monk
[09:34.000 --> 09:36.000]  or did the Easter Bunny?
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  Because they're telling you this imaginary,
[09:38.000 --> 09:42.000]  this delta variant is putting almost everybody
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.000]  in the hospital, 95%, that's even higher percentage
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  in Australia.
[09:49.000 --> 09:52.000]  There's one person in the hospital in Australia
[09:52.000 --> 09:55.000]  that didn't have the injection.
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.000]  Now, did the gasoline kill the monk?
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  I put the photo back up there because I've seen
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  the pre-photos, they get a smaller little picture of it
[10:05.000 --> 10:06.000]  out of the bigger container.
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  Was it the gasoline out of that white picture,
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  out of that white container, or was it, again,
[10:11.000 --> 10:12.000]  Santa Claus did that?
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  What was it, Casper the friendly ghost,
[10:14.000 --> 10:15.000]  let that guy on fire?
[10:15.000 --> 10:17.000]  Because look, there it is, the delta variant,
[10:17.000 --> 10:18.000]  let that guy on fire.
[10:18.000 --> 10:19.000]  Did you know that?
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  Yeah, that's not gasoline.
[10:21.000 --> 10:27.000]  It's not what we know he took.
[10:27.000 --> 10:32.000]  So again, 95% of the big surge in the hospital beds
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  are actually full in Israel now.
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.000]  They don't have to make it up this time,
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.000]  and then they're going to gaslight us.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  Talk about gaslighting.
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  So here's one of the government spokespersons,
[10:46.000 --> 10:55.000]  Dr. Kobe Heavy, on 95% of the severe patients
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  are vaccinated.
[10:56.000 --> 10:57.000]  Here it is.
[10:57.000 --> 11:17.000]  Dr. Kobe Heavy, on 95% of the severe patients
[11:17.000 --> 11:40.000]  are vaccinated.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  So their answer is, because you know,
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  they're the doctors, they couldn't be doing any wrong
[11:44.000 --> 11:45.000]  with the National Health Service,
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  with their freedom bracelets and the rest of it,
[11:47.000 --> 11:48.000]  GPS tracking everybody.
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.000]  No, it must be the vaccine doesn't work.
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  Yeah, that's why all over the world,
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  in the old and the young, in the middle age,
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  that almost everyone in the hospital took the shot.
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  That's either one of two things,
[12:01.000 --> 12:08.000]  the injections doing it, or it makes you super susceptible
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  to other viruses, which the literature also shows it can do,
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  it makes you have a horrible autoimmune response to any coronavirus,
[12:15.000 --> 12:17.000]  which are the most common you ever come in contact with.
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  There's 30 plus horrible things these things can do.
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  But what did it say in all the literature?
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  What did the head scientist, the former chief scientist,
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  and the Nobel Prize winners, and what did they all say about this?
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  Last year when they looked at the vaccine,
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  most of the vaccine was secret, but they said,
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  it's going to block this spike protein by producing it in the body.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  And then that'll make your body then attack that.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  And they said, well, that's going to cause people to get blood clots and die,
[12:42.000 --> 12:46.000]  and have autoimmune responses and have seizures and Guillain-Marais.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  And now they admit all that.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  And so, wow, I was driving into work today,
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  and I saw a school bus, I guess getting ready for school to start,
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  it had like images of turtles and frogs on the side.
[12:57.000 --> 12:59.000]  I guess it was like a private school.
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.000]  And it made me feel physically angry that now they're moving against our children
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.000]  12 and under with these deadly injections.
[13:07.000 --> 13:10.000]  So here we are, my friends.
[13:10.000 --> 13:16.000]  In the year 2021, it's like, again, watching somebody on a train track
[13:16.000 --> 13:18.000]  when a train's coming at 60 miles an hour,
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  and you know the train can't stop in that limited amount of time.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  If you jump out in front of a train at 60 miles an hour,
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.000]  and that train's even 100 yards away, it can't stop.
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  And we've all seen, I guess, the footage online
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  of people committing suicide jumping in front of trains, at least I have.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  And you can watch people jump in front of trains.
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  And so they jump in front of the train, there's about 10 seconds,
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.000]  they try to slam the brakes on, and they still hit them going 50 miles an hour.
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  60 miles an hour.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  And that was last year.
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  Except Fauci and Bill Gates put us on the tracks.
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  We knew what the shots would do.
[13:49.000 --> 13:52.000]  All the top scientists told us.
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  We told you, it won't protect you.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  It'll lower your immunity. It'll cause autoimmune problems.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  It'll make your body attack itself.
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  It'll cause Guillain-Barre, narcolepsy, epilepsy, brain fog, prion disease,
[14:04.000 --> 14:09.000]  which will cause heart attacks, lung collapse, destruction of the brain, Alzheimer's.
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  And now it's all confirmed.
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  And it's just like a footnote.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  Okay, yeah, there's all that, but it's not the vaccine.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  No, no, no, no, no.
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  It's a delta variant.
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  And then they say, but it might have come from the vaccine.
[14:23.000 --> 14:29.000]  The point is they had the literature, and they did this because they know it causes a shotgun effect.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  But they also figured out about eight months ago,
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  where they had really high death numbers in England.
[14:34.000 --> 14:37.000]  There was a little too much for even the military to carry this out.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  And the military came out and said, don't take this.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  If you're over 75, under 16 are pregnant.
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  Even they put that alert out, but then the media hit it.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  Oh, Google and Facebook and Twitter.
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  Don't listen to the military's own warning.
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.000]  So then suddenly, saline started getting passed out everywhere.
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.000]  And that was the scientists and doctors and military going, screw this and say,
[14:57.000 --> 15:00.000]  let's agree to destroy this. Let's give them saline.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  That's why all over the world, it's saline.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  It's not like some people thought, oh, the government didn't want too high of death numbers.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  That was the argument.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  A little too obvious.
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  But the real reason I think most of this happened, because it happened everywhere.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  So some places, it happened for other reasons, obviously.
[15:16.000 --> 15:23.000]  We don't know everything, but we know that all over the country and all over facilities and all over CVS and Walgreens,
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  they've arrested a bunch of pharmacists.
[15:25.000 --> 15:28.000]  And at first, we get lots of coverage to scare more pharmacists, but it didn't work.
[15:28.000 --> 15:34.000]  That pharmacists themselves were destroying it or ruining it, heating it up and then giving people placebo because they care.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  Because they see the people that come to them not coming back and dying.
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.000]  They see basically their patients dying so they do the right thing because they're humans.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  Hey, it's simple. The vaccine's to kill us.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  Bill Gates says he wants to kill us. He's been kicked out of 30 plus countries.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  He's doing it to us now.
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  His vaccines banned in China and India. Arrest him and Fauci now.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  I want them arrested now.
[15:59.000 --> 16:04.000]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity,
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[16:07.000 --> 16:12.000]  Here's why. We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[16:12.000 --> 16:17.000]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[16:17.000 --> 16:26.000]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid,
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.000]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[16:35.000 --> 16:41.000]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too.
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[16:47.000 --> 16:55.000]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[16:58.000 --> 17:05.000]  Hey everybody, if you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[17:05.000 --> 17:07.000]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[17:07.000 --> 17:14.000]  Here's the thing, we've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans.
[17:14.000 --> 17:22.000]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[17:22.000 --> 17:29.000]  The best part, we've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.000]  and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to, gets even better.
[17:33.000 --> 17:37.000]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being,
[17:37.000 --> 17:45.000]  I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world, period.
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  Go to SoupBeansSurvival.com, that's SoupBeansSurvival.com
[17:49.000 --> 17:57.000]  and discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away at SoupBeansSurvival.com that's SoupBeansSurvival.com.
[18:20.000 --> 18:28.000]  I've been taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[18:28.000 --> 18:34.000]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements but I thought,
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.000]  you know, well maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[18:39.000 --> 18:44.000]  but when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately but you know, over a period of time,
[18:44.000 --> 18:50.000]  I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[18:50.000 --> 18:56.000]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[19:03.000 --> 19:06.000]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[19:06.000 --> 19:07.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[19:07.000 --> 19:08.000]  Good.
[19:08.000 --> 19:09.000]  Great last caller.
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.000]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.000]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization and absurdity.
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.000]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.000]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[19:22.000 --> 19:23.000]  Go ahead.
[19:23.000 --> 19:24.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  The X2 does wonders.
[19:29.000 --> 19:30.000]  They recommend it to everybody.
[19:30.000 --> 19:31.000]  You're on the fence about it.
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info ward.
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year.
[19:36.000 --> 19:37.000]  Thanks for holding.
[19:37.000 --> 19:38.000]  Go ahead.
[19:38.000 --> 19:39.000]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on.
[19:39.000 --> 19:40.000]  It's an honor.
[19:40.000 --> 19:41.000]  Honor, talk to you.
[19:41.000 --> 19:47.000]  So, first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.000]  Well, it definitely works.
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.000]  It's not a joke.
[19:55.000 --> 20:22.000]  Absolutely.
[20:25.000 --> 20:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't want this to be true, but it is true.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  And I'm completely freaked out.
[20:39.000 --> 20:40.000]  I'm so sad.
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  And a lot of people we know, a lot of people we care about are already dead and are already
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  dying.
[20:45.000 --> 20:52.000]  Last year, it was all people that were dying of other illnesses, cancer, heart attacks.
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  They were counting it as COVID to create the fear to get the vaccine in people.
[20:56.000 --> 21:03.000]  Then, literally, 90 plus percent of all the top scientists, just an ocean of them, said
[21:03.000 --> 21:04.000]  this won't protect you.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  It'll kill people.
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  It'll cause heart attacks, strokes, autoimmune disease.
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  I'm just repeating the same thing.
[21:10.000 --> 21:11.000]  That's what they all said.
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.000]  That's what in the studies they knew.
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  They said, what are you doing?
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  This is crazy.
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  And now they've gone ahead with it.
[21:18.000 --> 21:23.000]  And I said last year, they're going to claim it's a variant because the unvaccinated didn't
[21:23.000 --> 21:24.000]  vaccinate, because I just know how they operate.
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  I know how these criminals are.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  So I was thinking, how will they get away with this?
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  Well, they'll say all the dying people are because of the unvaccinated.
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  And then I said, but it'll be the vaccinated.
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  They're dying, but it doesn't matter because they've murdered logic.
[21:38.000 --> 21:44.000]  Are we not exactly where I said we'd be 16, 17 months ago, 10 months ago, five months
[21:44.000 --> 21:45.000]  ago?
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  We're here.
[21:47.000 --> 21:48.000]  And I don't just go off the news.
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  I've got all my contacts and sources.
[21:50.000 --> 21:56.000]  The hospitals across the world are full of vaccinated people dead and dying.
[21:56.000 --> 22:03.000]  And they're just gauging right now how they're going to announce this to the public.
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  Biden is going to announce his emergency probably next week.
[22:06.000 --> 22:07.000]  I know that they're preparing it.
[22:07.000 --> 22:08.000]  They've got the speech written.
[22:08.000 --> 22:09.000]  That's confirmed.
[22:09.000 --> 22:16.000]  He may not pull the trigger on January, on August 11th.
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  But then there's other dates that we're seeing into early next year with the national emergency.
[22:20.000 --> 22:21.000]  He's planning to announce.
[22:21.000 --> 22:22.000]  That's why I keep saying January.
[22:22.000 --> 22:27.000]  I'll talk about August, but the next move is the internet kill switch.
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  And it's the FEMA takeover of communications.
[22:29.000 --> 22:34.000]  And that's why Apple announced, okay, we're scanning and reading everything you say and do in
[22:34.000 --> 22:35.000]  live time.
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  Notice Apple has all these billboards and TV ads.
[22:37.000 --> 22:38.000]  We're the privacy company.
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  You have total privacy with us.
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  Four years ago, they gave all the code keys to everybody with Apple devices in the world,
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  to the Communist Chinese.
[22:46.000 --> 22:47.000]  Tim Cook moved to China.
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  He said he supports GG Ping and supports dictatorship.
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.000]  You've seen all these other leaders pledge themselves to GG Ping and say they want to be
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.000]  dictators.
[22:55.000 --> 23:00.000]  You've seen Bill Gates' lawyer, Berkshire Hathaway co-owner.
[23:00.000 --> 23:04.000]  Say he pledges himself to GG Ping.
[23:04.000 --> 23:08.000]  You've seen Trudeau pledge himself to GG Ping.
[23:08.000 --> 23:16.000]  Apple has revealed plans to spy on everyone's iPhone, but oh, it's to stop child porn.
[23:16.000 --> 23:17.000]  Mm-hmm.
[23:17.000 --> 23:18.000]  Sure it is.
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  Oh, we're going to read everything you do for your safety, but oh, we're the privacy
[23:22.000 --> 23:23.000]  company.
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.000]  You're like, but that's the opposite.
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.000]  Well, exactly.
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  And when we come back, I've still got a lot of time in this segment.
[23:30.000 --> 23:34.000]  When we come back, I'm going to talk about what was trending.
[23:34.000 --> 23:39.880]  Number one on many of the charts on Twitter and in the top 10 total, Alex Jones was right,
[23:39.880 --> 23:47.400]  and Alex Jones were trending yesterday and today at the top because there was a big document
[23:47.400 --> 23:54.760]  dump that Judicial Watch got about how they're keeping babies alive and then selling their
[23:54.760 --> 23:56.000]  organs while they're alive.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.500]  And you get asked, why do they do that?
[23:58.500 --> 24:04.200]  Well, because they've got these private auctions and systems.
[24:04.200 --> 24:07.760]  So if you can have a woman say, hey, you want to keep this baby at nine months?
[24:07.760 --> 24:11.000]  She says, no, they say, fine, we're not going to resuscitate.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.840]  Resuscitate is a legal term in bioethics, meaning we're not going to say it's a human.
[24:14.840 --> 24:20.160]  They then quote, keep the baby comfortable, but it's now a non-human.
[24:20.160 --> 24:25.680]  And then it's sent to a special ward while they then get all the buyers ready, get it
[24:25.680 --> 24:26.680]  prepared.
[24:26.680 --> 24:27.680]  Sometimes it takes a day.
[24:27.680 --> 24:28.680]  Sometimes it takes a week.
[24:28.680 --> 24:31.320]  I've been told they don't like to keep them around the ward more than a week or so because
[24:31.320 --> 24:36.800]  even the special nurses they've hired to work in these very secretive wards get a little
[24:36.800 --> 24:39.080]  freaked out.
[24:39.080 --> 24:43.720]  And we always use these of this graphic from five years ago, but it's way higher than that.
[24:43.720 --> 24:49.600]  They get the $300,000 or more from what's in a baby, a seven pound baby.
[24:49.600 --> 24:52.160]  So Ella Hart's like a hundred grand.
[24:52.160 --> 24:53.840]  So that's an inaccurate graph.
[24:53.840 --> 24:58.360]  Matt, the crew put it up there, just wanted to let you know that, and you ask, well, why
[24:58.360 --> 25:03.400]  would Governor Northam, he used to run harvesting of babies when he was not in a KKK outfit.
[25:03.400 --> 25:08.120]  Why would Governor Northam four years ago go on a show and say, well, we don't involve
[25:08.120 --> 25:09.120]  the authorities.
[25:09.120 --> 25:10.600]  We don't involve the police and the courts.
[25:10.600 --> 25:12.440]  It's between the mother and the doctor.
[25:12.440 --> 25:17.440]  She make a decision, seven months old, whether we're going to resuscitate or whether we're
[25:17.440 --> 25:19.760]  going to, you know, get rid of it.
[25:19.760 --> 25:24.560]  Even if she make the decision not to resuscitate, we take the baby and we keep it comfortable.
[25:24.560 --> 25:31.200]  Well, I don't need to know and to defer from what he said, what that means, I do know.
[25:31.200 --> 25:35.400]  And I've talked to the nurses and I've confirmed it.
[25:35.400 --> 25:39.680]  When they say you've died in a brain dead in a car accident, and your family's told
[25:39.680 --> 25:44.440]  your dad, and you make the decision to not quote, keep you alive, they then shuffle
[25:44.440 --> 25:47.040]  you out, you're still alive.
[25:47.040 --> 25:49.720]  And they keep you a lot of times for a week.
[25:49.720 --> 25:53.400]  They put an oxygen tent over, you know, you don't need it, just so it's like a symbol
[25:53.400 --> 25:54.400]  of this person's dead.
[25:54.400 --> 25:57.120]  It's been going on for 50 years.
[25:57.120 --> 25:59.840]  And then when they get the, all the stuff lined up, then they do the surgery and get
[25:59.840 --> 26:00.840]  all the stuff.
[26:00.840 --> 26:04.120]  Well, then they try to go on 20 years ago, well, why are we going to waste the seven
[26:04.120 --> 26:07.960]  pounds of meat?
[26:07.960 --> 26:12.080]  And so they then convinced poor women, oh, your baby's deformed or your baby's got a
[26:12.080 --> 26:13.080]  sickness.
[26:13.080 --> 26:17.280]  Oh, you know, oh, you're in labor, you're a homeless woman, we just, the baby didn't
[26:17.280 --> 26:20.000]  make it, sign the form, sweetheart.
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.280]  She signs the form, she's all drugged up, and they get that baby.
[26:25.280 --> 26:26.280]  And I mean, why not?
[26:26.280 --> 26:29.120]  It's all a commodity, we're all commodities now.
[26:29.120 --> 26:32.360]  You know, it's come out, nobody cared that Fauci got a lot of these babies that were
[26:32.360 --> 26:33.360]  still alive.
[26:33.360 --> 26:37.000]  They would actually deliver them living, that's in the documents to the universities, and
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.800]  it turns out Fauci was over most of those, of course he is.
[26:39.800 --> 26:42.240]  Everybody's really mad about beagles.
[26:42.240 --> 26:47.680]  And just one thing they did to beagles, hundreds of thousands of dollars per program, 300,000
[26:47.680 --> 26:50.360]  here, 500,000 there, it's all coming out.
[26:50.360 --> 26:55.760]  They would take beagles, puppies of course, they like to really hurt young things, and
[26:55.760 --> 27:01.800]  they would implant in them African and Latin American boring maggot flies and all sorts
[27:01.800 --> 27:05.520]  of other diseases, and then watch them eaten by the maggots.
[27:05.520 --> 27:07.880]  And you ask, why would they do that in other burrowing flies?
[27:07.880 --> 27:11.280]  And they said, well, they also had flies that burrow into the brain.
[27:11.280 --> 27:17.520]  Fauci, because Fauci in the program was trying to figure out how to give those to humans.
[27:17.520 --> 27:19.320]  That's admitted.
[27:19.320 --> 27:24.200]  The grants are for how to transmit things previously not transmitted to humans so that
[27:24.200 --> 27:30.840]  he can learn, God knows why, how to implant these things in your body.
[27:30.840 --> 27:35.000]  So just thought you might want to know, but he's a great man, right, running the Wuhan
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.520]  lab and ain't a function, all the rest of it.
[27:37.520 --> 27:44.520]  And of course, he also used scalps from Boarded Babies to create human mice, and they would
[27:44.520 --> 27:49.760]  put the hair on the mice, that's just part of it, that they would also keep the babies
[27:49.760 --> 27:54.520]  alive and put mice brains inside their brains and connect their brains together.
[27:54.520 --> 27:58.160]  And oh, here's a little secret, little extra for you.
[27:58.160 --> 28:07.080]  If they make the baby 1% bovine or porcine or pentaped, they do all that.
[28:07.080 --> 28:17.280]  It's porcines, pigs, pentapeds, you know, those are, that's seals, bovines, cow.
[28:17.280 --> 28:20.720]  When they make you just a small percentage an animal, you no longer have rights.
[28:20.720 --> 28:24.520]  That's why they're huge in the cloning chimera.
[28:24.520 --> 28:29.000]  Remember two months ago, Congress tried to pass a law saying stop all the cloning farms
[28:29.000 --> 28:34.280]  and they said, oh, it fell by nine votes, remember, nine votes in the U.S. Senate.
[28:34.280 --> 28:38.680]  Yeah, Republicans voted with Democrats to keep the animal human clones going.
[28:38.680 --> 28:39.680]  So they don't have any rights.
[28:39.680 --> 28:44.280]  And by the way, I mean, I've talked to three star generals who were in the basis with the
[28:44.280 --> 28:46.080]  human animal clones.
[28:46.080 --> 28:48.560]  General Stubblebine saw that kind of stuff.
[28:48.560 --> 28:51.640]  He was the head of all special forces, head of all the secret programs.
[28:51.640 --> 28:55.120]  He wasn't in those programs, but he, I know he saw some of that.
[28:55.120 --> 28:56.120]  He's dead now.
[28:56.120 --> 28:57.120]  We'll be right back.
[28:57.120 --> 28:58.120]  Stay with us.
[28:58.120 --> 29:03.160]  Hey, everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[29:03.160 --> 29:04.160]  Me too.
[29:04.160 --> 29:08.320]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[29:08.320 --> 29:11.040]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[29:11.040 --> 29:15.420]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[29:15.420 --> 29:17.160]  You probably already believe that.
[29:17.160 --> 29:18.320]  I certainly do.
[29:18.320 --> 29:19.320]  So here's the thing.
[29:19.320 --> 29:23.720]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant based substances actually
[29:23.720 --> 29:27.800]  have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[29:27.800 --> 29:32.920]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefence.com.
[29:32.920 --> 29:35.120]  No cures or treatments there.
[29:35.120 --> 29:39.560]  Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune
[29:39.560 --> 29:44.120]  support product based on that research called Immune 10X.
[29:44.120 --> 29:48.040]  In the best part, you can go to the Stronger Defense website right now and claim your own
[29:48.040 --> 29:51.760]  supply of Immune 10X without paying anything today.
[29:51.760 --> 29:52.760]  Crazy, right?
[29:52.760 --> 30:01.120]  Learn more about this unusual limited time offer at strongerdefence.com that's strongerdefence.com.
[30:01.120 --> 30:08.320]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on and that its
[30:08.320 --> 30:12.520]  criminals are extremely pathological, even more the general public.
[30:12.520 --> 30:17.200]  They do the same things over and over again and criminals like to commit the same types
[30:17.200 --> 30:19.640]  of crimes over and over again.
[30:19.640 --> 30:21.280]  Well, guess what?
[30:21.280 --> 30:29.200]  It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenice's globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment
[30:29.200 --> 30:33.400]  of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were
[30:33.400 --> 30:38.800]  the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the telent besides
[30:38.800 --> 30:42.000]  the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[30:42.000 --> 30:47.360]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down
[30:47.360 --> 30:48.360]  the road.
[30:48.360 --> 30:52.440]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the
[30:52.440 --> 30:57.760]  COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[30:57.760 --> 31:00.600]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[31:00.600 --> 31:05.280]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that
[31:05.280 --> 31:06.600]  I've ever done.

[31:11.000 --> 31:14.200]  in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[31:14.200 --> 31:16.240]  Well it's all come down to this.
[31:16.240 --> 31:22.000]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th and 12th.
[31:22.000 --> 31:30.120]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, frankspeech.com.

[31:57.960 --> 32:00.920]  code ALEKS.
[32:00.920 --> 32:04.040]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[32:04.040 --> 32:07.840]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to
[32:07.840 --> 32:08.840]  pass.
[32:08.840 --> 32:12.440]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach
[32:12.440 --> 32:16.680]  a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being
[32:16.680 --> 32:17.680]  totally enslaved.
[32:17.680 --> 32:21.400]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making
[32:21.400 --> 32:22.400]  that move.
[32:22.400 --> 32:26.400]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with
[32:26.400 --> 32:32.080]  the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis,
[32:32.080 --> 32:37.000]  under such a load, capitulate to the UN whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that
[32:37.000 --> 32:42.680]  they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees, not fleeing COVID or climate
[32:42.680 --> 32:48.160]  change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber and Bill Gates are saying, but fleeing the year-long
[32:48.160 --> 32:54.120]  lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more
[32:54.120 --> 32:56.240]  IMF and World Bank money.
[32:56.240 --> 33:02.600]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[33:02.600 --> 33:29.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:29.280 --> 33:34.720]  In a recent video, Polly St. George talks us through her recent investigation of the
[33:34.720 --> 33:41.320]  company in trust, a company who just recently signed a contract with the United Kingdom
[33:41.320 --> 33:46.680]  to provide digital passports for COVID-19 vaccine tracking.
[33:46.680 --> 33:52.320]  What she discovered was that the family who owns in trust not only has Nazi roots, but
[33:52.320 --> 33:56.160]  they are in fact a very prominent Nazi family.
[33:56.160 --> 33:59.160]  The family in question is the Quant family.
[33:59.160 --> 34:05.680]  In 1929, Günther Quant took over one of the largest arms manufacturers in Germany.
[34:05.680 --> 34:11.360]  He then divorced his second wife Magda, who then married Joseph Goebbels just two years
[34:11.360 --> 34:13.760]  later in 1931.
[34:13.760 --> 34:18.560]  The Goebbels family then became heavily involved in the Quant family business.
[34:18.560 --> 34:24.880]  Maybe this was one of those instances of marriage to cement a business relationship, sort of
[34:24.880 --> 34:26.480]  like royalty does.
[34:26.480 --> 34:29.040]  But this is the new royalty.
[34:29.040 --> 34:31.560]  This is the industrialist royalty.
[34:31.560 --> 34:35.920]  This is the globalist regime being born.
[34:35.920 --> 34:37.640]  That's just a guess.
[34:37.640 --> 34:39.720]  Here's some photos from the wedding.
[34:39.720 --> 34:45.080]  Their marriage took place on a grand property owned by Günther Quant, where Adolf Hitler
[34:45.080 --> 34:47.480]  served as the best man.
[34:47.480 --> 34:53.880]  In 1933, Günther officially joined the Nazi party and was granted special privileges
[34:53.880 --> 34:56.600]  to use slave labor.
[34:56.600 --> 35:02.640]  Günther and his sons, Herbert and Harold, staffed their factories with over 50,000 prisoners
[35:02.640 --> 35:06.400]  of war and concentration camp workers.
[35:06.400 --> 35:12.040]  One of their factories even had its own concentration camp, an execution area.
[35:12.040 --> 35:15.640]  The end of World War II had little effect on the Quant family.
[35:15.640 --> 35:20.920]  A former prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials claims that there was plenty of evidence to
[35:20.920 --> 35:26.240]  prosecute the Quant's and regrets how they were allowed to evade punishment.
[35:26.240 --> 35:31.320]  Not only did the Quant's evade punishment at Nuremberg, Herbert went on as a director
[35:31.320 --> 35:37.800]  of Deutsche Bank, became an honorary citizen and a czar of the whole German economy.
[35:37.800 --> 35:40.960]  He married Johanna Brun in 1960.
[35:40.960 --> 35:47.920]  They had two children, Stefan Quant and Suzanne Klatton, Germany's richest woman, who recently
[35:47.920 --> 35:52.400]  told reporters how difficult it is being a billionaire.
[35:52.400 --> 35:59.200]  Entrust was bought by the Quant family in 1987, has went on to gain contracts in banking and
[35:59.200 --> 36:04.880]  government, including just about every level of the U.S. federal government, and has just
[36:04.880 --> 36:10.280]  signed a contract to provide digital passports for the U.K.
[36:10.280 --> 36:16.320]  The Quant family weren't the only Nazi industrialists to go on after the war and thrive.
[36:16.320 --> 36:23.720]  I.G. Farben-Behr is the father of Big Pharma, and this ideology wasn't born with the Nazis.
[36:23.720 --> 36:31.480]  It comes from the Sabati and Frankist Rockefeller Rothschild banking empire, the ones who mysteriously
[36:31.480 --> 36:37.000]  create money and loan it to us with interest as if they own it all.
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.600]  We know who they are.
[36:38.600 --> 36:43.320]  Many of them are coming out of the shadows and offering us tyranny, and many of us are
[36:43.320 --> 36:45.280]  accepting the offer.
[36:45.280 --> 36:51.960]  And all we have to do to save our lives is say no to this criminal gang of psychotic
[36:51.960 --> 36:53.640]  vampires.
[36:53.640 --> 36:57.480]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[36:57.480 --> 37:04.720]  All right, that report digital passport company run by Nazis.
[37:04.720 --> 37:06.120]  Nazi royalty.
[37:06.120 --> 37:19.640]  You know when I used to be a little kid, I would see movies like Friday 13th, and I
[37:19.640 --> 37:23.120]  would wonder why in the movies, when Jason's chasing them with a butcher knife through
[37:23.120 --> 37:29.520]  the forest, why they run and fall down and like back away on their butts, oh please don't
[37:29.520 --> 37:32.600]  kill me please, because I would just keep running like a million miles an hour or I'd
[37:32.600 --> 37:35.040]  fight back.
[37:35.040 --> 37:39.280]  But then I grew up and learned how the world really worked, and I actually learned that
[37:39.280 --> 37:43.760]  a lot of people actually, if somebody pulled a knife on them, would just start falling
[37:43.760 --> 37:48.680]  down to the ground and begging and pleading and wouldn't even run.
[37:48.680 --> 37:56.800]  I've experienced that particularly in women, and that's what the globalist target women
[37:56.800 --> 38:01.880]  with all their propaganda and their attacks, but I never thought people would really like
[38:01.880 --> 38:02.880]  that.
[38:02.880 --> 38:03.880]  My instincts were like, this isn't real.
[38:03.880 --> 38:07.480]  No one would just beg and plead while the killer comes over with a knife.
[38:07.480 --> 38:11.960]  Somebody walks in here with a knife, I'm going to pick this marble table over and smash
[38:11.960 --> 38:13.440]  him over the head, I'm going to kill him.
[38:13.440 --> 38:15.720]  I'm going to die trying.
[38:15.720 --> 38:20.000]  I'm not Mr. Tough Guy, it's like flipping a damn switch.
[38:20.000 --> 38:25.880]  But now you see it, these people are killing us in mass, and we're not just groveling on
[38:25.880 --> 38:31.720]  the ground saying, please don't hurt me, please don't stab me.
[38:31.720 --> 38:34.600]  Instead, people are like, oh, I want more shots.
[38:34.600 --> 38:37.640]  It's like, but almost everyone dying is taking the shot.
[38:37.640 --> 38:38.640]  I want more shots.
[38:38.640 --> 38:39.640]  I want more shots.
[38:39.640 --> 38:42.140]  I want more shots.
[38:42.140 --> 38:47.640]  And you can't even admit to themselves that they're being attacked and they're being targeted.
[38:47.640 --> 38:51.920]  Instead, they turn around and go, it's you that didn't take the shot.
[38:51.920 --> 38:55.440]  You're the reason this is happening, and now you've got to do it.
[38:55.440 --> 39:01.160]  And I started saying this a month ago, and it's now borne out, the hospitals were totally
[39:01.160 --> 39:02.160]  empty last year.
[39:02.160 --> 39:04.840]  That was a total fraud.
[39:04.840 --> 39:11.840]  Hospitals are full of people, and the vaccinated are now growing spike proteins that are jumping
[39:11.840 --> 39:15.200]  into people and making them sick as well.
[39:15.200 --> 39:20.320]  But if you look at the statistics out of Australia and the statistics out of Gibraltar and out
[39:20.320 --> 39:28.920]  of Singapore, out of Israel, there's one right there, Jerusalem Hospital, 85 and 90% of cases
[39:28.920 --> 39:31.200]  are people who were vaccinated.
[39:31.200 --> 39:32.360]  And that's old news.
[39:32.360 --> 39:33.920]  That's from yesterday.
[39:33.920 --> 39:40.040]  Now it's 95% the National Health Service says.
[39:40.040 --> 39:43.040]  So think about that, and again, they're spinning it.
[39:43.040 --> 39:49.080]  Well, it's because the Delta variant.
[39:49.080 --> 39:51.560]  And then Congress goes, give us a scan of that Delta variant.
[39:51.560 --> 39:52.560]  Show us that virus.
[39:52.560 --> 39:55.320]  As normal when they find a new virus, they publish it on an international database.
[39:55.320 --> 39:56.840]  There's also a national database.
[39:56.840 --> 40:04.480]  No one will put it on the database.
[40:04.480 --> 40:08.600]  The Indians and the Australians claim they got a copy of it and said it was man-made.
[40:08.600 --> 40:10.480]  Remember that?
[40:10.480 --> 40:13.400]  So people say, well, the virus doesn't exist.
[40:13.400 --> 40:14.560]  That's why they won't put it on database.
[40:14.560 --> 40:17.120]  No, the damn thing looks like Frankenstein.
[40:17.120 --> 40:19.280]  It's got five viruses hammered together.
[40:19.280 --> 40:20.880]  It's real.
[40:20.880 --> 40:25.760]  But it killed people with a spike protein, not with its replication overall.
[40:25.760 --> 40:32.080]  That's what the medical stuff shows, the research, the white papers, the studies.
[40:32.080 --> 40:37.160]  But now, just what the actual Nobel Prize winners predicted, and what the actual former
[40:37.160 --> 40:43.080]  head of Pfizer said, it will then make what happened from the virus look like a cakewalk
[40:43.080 --> 40:44.320]  and be much worse.
[40:44.320 --> 40:45.320]  And it is.
[40:45.320 --> 40:49.200]  And you've got to really hand it to Bill Gates and the globalists that came up with
[40:49.200 --> 40:50.200]  this.
[40:50.200 --> 40:54.520]  This is something where you go voluntarily take it and then you grow the shell of the
[40:54.520 --> 41:01.040]  virus in you and it affect everybody, including yourself.
[41:01.040 --> 41:02.040]  And that doesn't matter.
[41:02.040 --> 41:05.200]  You see, there's all these patents from Bill Gates and all these Fauci patents and you and
[41:05.200 --> 41:10.320]  patents on vaccines that vaccinate others.
[41:10.320 --> 41:14.360]  Like, oh, we've just got to vaccinate one part of the village and then the live virus
[41:14.360 --> 41:15.360]  will vaccinate the rest.
[41:15.360 --> 41:18.200]  And it's like, oh, how wonderful Bill Gates came up with that.
[41:18.200 --> 41:20.800]  He funded that.
[41:20.800 --> 41:23.760]  Self-replicating vaccines, self-spreading vaccines.
[41:23.760 --> 41:24.760]  Look it up.
[41:24.760 --> 41:27.400]  Look up vaccines for birth control.
[41:27.400 --> 41:28.400]  Look up the UN.
[41:28.400 --> 41:29.400]  Look it all up.
[41:29.400 --> 41:32.000]  And they did it to us, folks.
[41:32.000 --> 41:35.440]  They didn't spend trillions of dollars.
[41:35.440 --> 41:40.720]  They didn't take over the world.
[41:40.720 --> 41:51.520]  They didn't do all of this for no reason.
[41:51.520 --> 41:55.240]  They did it because they want total power and control over the genetic future of humanity.
[41:55.240 --> 41:58.280]  They want to go to ultra or DNA when they want.
[41:58.280 --> 42:01.000]  They want to decide who can have children and who can't and they want to depopulate the
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.280]  vast majority of people and they're doing it.
[42:05.280 --> 42:11.160]  And I just sit here in absolute horror watching this all unfold.
[42:11.160 --> 42:12.160]  God help us.
[42:12.160 --> 42:13.160]  All right.
[42:13.160 --> 42:15.200]  I'm going to go to break and come back with what is one of the top stories in the world
[42:15.200 --> 42:16.200]  right now.
[42:16.200 --> 42:18.920]  Thanks to Jack Passovic and people sharing it.
[42:18.920 --> 42:21.600]  It was number one for a while on Twitter yesterday.
[42:21.600 --> 42:22.600]  Millions of people saw it.
[42:22.600 --> 42:24.840]  A lot of articles got written about it.
[42:24.840 --> 42:25.840]  And that's good.
[42:25.840 --> 42:31.360]  And I know it sounded macabre when I came out and said they're keeping babies alive,
[42:31.360 --> 42:34.840]  but I mean, it's in the literature they're doing it, okay?
[42:34.840 --> 42:38.080]  It's just that, oh, that's not acceptable to say because that obviously can't happen
[42:38.080 --> 42:39.640]  in America, right?
[42:39.640 --> 42:47.520]  I mean, obviously, obviously 95% of those in the hospitals don't have the vaccine, but
[42:47.520 --> 42:48.520]  they do.
[42:48.520 --> 42:50.720]  It's like it's the vaccine.
[42:50.720 --> 42:52.000]  It's the vaccine.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.480]  It's not a vaccine.
[42:53.480 --> 42:55.000]  It's a farming agent.
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  It's a protein crystal that grows in you and kills you.
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.160]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021.
[43:03.160 --> 43:07.240]  We're seeing world government, world IDs being announced, forced inoculations.
[43:07.240 --> 43:11.360]  All the tyranny we warned of is down here, but on the good side, there is also a global
[43:11.360 --> 43:14.360]  awakening, the lives of which this planet has never seen.
[43:14.360 --> 43:18.560]  So truly, the battle between good and evil is now front and center.
[43:18.560 --> 43:21.120]  That's why I want to thank all the viewers and all the listeners for your support, for
[43:21.120 --> 43:25.040]  your word of mouth, for your prayers over the years because without InfoWars, we'd be
[43:25.040 --> 43:27.040]  in a lot more trouble than we are right now.
[43:27.040 --> 43:29.160]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air.
[43:29.160 --> 43:33.000]  And please take advantage of the big super sale, flash sale we're doing right now at
[43:33.000 --> 43:34.000]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[43:43.280 --> 43:47.920]  our high-quality vitamin D3 formula with calcium, and we have the 1100% of your daily
[43:47.920 --> 43:50.800]  allowance, vitamin C with zinc.

[43:55.400 --> 43:59.520]  so please take advantage of it right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[43:59.520 --> 44:01.840]  The biosecurity state is here.
[44:01.840 --> 44:08.320]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation, training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[44:08.320 --> 44:13.440]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship
[44:13.440 --> 44:19.200]  of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines
[44:19.200 --> 44:24.880]  for every person in the country all the way out into 2024, and that in 2024 you will again
[44:24.880 --> 44:30.800]  take two shots, and he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[44:30.800 --> 44:32.520]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[44:32.520 --> 44:36.280]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates, they're now implementing it, and now
[44:36.280 --> 44:39.880]  they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[44:39.880 --> 44:44.760]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf, Alois
[44:44.760 --> 44:48.840]  Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Cosnerville Home Institute
[44:48.840 --> 44:49.840]  in Germany.
[44:49.840 --> 44:53.720]  InfoWars will continue to so fastly fight this, and I don't know how long we can.
[44:53.720 --> 44:56.560]  The enemy's coming for us all now, and God bless, and good luck.
[44:56.560 --> 44:59.240]  I would again get right with God right now.
[44:59.240 --> 45:05.680]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies
[45:05.680 --> 45:11.080]  we are told, and the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which
[45:11.080 --> 45:14.360]  is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[45:14.360 --> 45:19.080]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland, and shuts
[45:19.080 --> 45:24.320]  down its natural functions, natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[45:24.320 --> 45:28.480]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system, the chakra aligned with the pineal
[45:28.480 --> 45:33.200]  gland is the third eye, also described as the seat of the soul.
[45:33.200 --> 45:38.800]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness, and otherwise unseen
[45:38.800 --> 45:41.040]  dimensions of reality.
[45:41.040 --> 45:45.720]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[45:45.720 --> 45:51.040]  Our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your drinking water fluoride
[45:51.040 --> 45:54.880]  free, and the propure shower head will seal the deal.
[45:54.880 --> 46:00.320]  Get them both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com.
[46:00.320 --> 46:05.160]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[46:05.160 --> 46:07.880]  from beta testing to operational.
[46:07.880 --> 46:12.640]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[46:12.640 --> 46:13.640]  takeover.
[46:13.640 --> 46:16.760]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working, and others have been
[46:16.760 --> 46:21.680]  working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[46:21.680 --> 46:25.800]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible, and if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[46:25.800 --> 46:27.480]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[46:27.480 --> 46:32.640]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it, so prayer is essential, research is essential,
[46:32.640 --> 46:35.840]  getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[46:35.840 --> 46:40.400]  And at the same time, supporting info wars by buying high quality products to keep us
[46:40.400 --> 46:44.080]  on air is essential, because they're great products for you and your family, and they're
[46:44.080 --> 46:46.560]  also funding our operation.
[46:46.560 --> 46:52.000]  infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com is incredible, a lot of our products that have been sold
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.240]  out because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasobites and others,
[46:56.240 --> 47:03.640]  so get them today at infowarstore.com and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[47:03.640 --> 47:21.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.160 --> 47:48.680]  By the way, when I start the next hour, I'm gonna tell you about Gisling Maxwell's buddies
[47:48.680 --> 47:54.920]  who were at the Atlantic magazine quite the party over there, and we got the editor of
[47:54.920 --> 48:04.160]  it who used to work at a torture base in Israel, wants to set up internal checkpoints in America
[48:04.160 --> 48:08.920]  and make us take poison vaccines, be able to get on airplanes to have a natural database.
[48:08.920 --> 48:15.000]  We're gonna tell you about Lawrence Powell, Jobs, owner of the Atlantic magazine in Gisling
[48:15.000 --> 48:22.920]  Maxwell, got some new fun stuff coming out with the girls in bikinis.
[48:22.920 --> 48:31.080]  Let's just say it's a lot of fun when you're a psychotic, I think it's time to really start
[48:31.080 --> 48:32.920]  spotlighting these people, isn't it?
[48:32.920 --> 48:39.600]  It's time to take the gloves off like they say, since folks keep looking for a confrontation,
[48:39.600 --> 48:47.880]  sometimes they find it, don't they, sometimes people get what they want, sometimes they
[48:47.880 --> 48:52.480]  just push and push a little too hard.
[48:52.480 --> 49:00.520]  When I got visited by Goldberg to do their little assessment, I played dumb to buy time
[49:00.520 --> 49:05.600]  under the radar while I built the program to take them down.
[49:05.600 --> 49:13.600]  What a scared little man, and they did buy it, and that was the good point.
[49:13.600 --> 49:26.720]  At the end of the day, everyone will be judged, and not everybody will be treated the same
[49:26.720 --> 49:28.320]  as they say.
[49:28.320 --> 49:35.680]  Okay, so let's look at the little darling of the Rockefellers and the New World Order.
[49:35.680 --> 49:43.200]  Dr. Fauci funds organ trafficking from aborted babies, helping researchers craft baby scalps
[49:43.200 --> 49:44.200]  onto rodents.
[49:44.200 --> 49:50.160]  Now, that came out in May, seems like 100 years ago, from government documents to judicial
[49:50.160 --> 49:56.960]  watch and a bunch of other pro-life groups, life sites, and all over it got out.
[49:56.960 --> 50:01.920]  But that's only the tip of the iceberg.
[50:01.920 --> 50:06.800]  They're not just funny experiments with aborted fetal scalps, grafts onto rats, they're keeping
[50:06.800 --> 50:14.240]  babies alive, but you know, no one seems to be really upset about that, that's just a
[50:14.240 --> 50:25.240]  human screw them, but they are upset about Fauci and the dogs.
[50:25.240 --> 50:35.040]  Now I'm a dog lover myself, it's a big article on infowars.com by Steve Watson.
[50:35.040 --> 50:39.640]  Fauci oversaw dangerous, torturous experiments on dogs, so why should I tell you about kidnap
[50:39.640 --> 50:44.240]  babies and snuff films or kids spliced with animals so they have no rights and can be
[50:44.240 --> 50:49.680]  harvested or babies taken at birth and kept alive while they get auctions going for their
[50:49.680 --> 50:50.680]  body parts?
[50:50.680 --> 50:53.520]  Who cares about that?
[50:53.520 --> 50:54.520]  Screw humans.
[50:54.520 --> 50:55.520]  Right?
[50:55.520 --> 51:03.440]  Planned Parenthood told me so, CNN told me there's too many people, okay, but the doggies.
[51:03.440 --> 51:07.640]  In addition to overseeing funding of gain of function coronavirus experiments in Wuhan
[51:07.640 --> 51:13.560]  and then lying about it, it has now emerged that Dr. Fauci was in charge of funding horrid
[51:13.560 --> 51:19.760]  experimental research on dogs, including purposely infecting animals with parasites known to
[51:19.760 --> 51:23.280]  be contagious to humans because they were studying how to give humans this, the report
[51:23.280 --> 51:28.000]  from the White Coat Waste Project draws on information gained by a Freedom Information
[51:28.000 --> 51:35.640]  Act request by a judicial watch, 400,000 was pumped into the National Institutes of Allergy
[51:35.640 --> 51:43.560]  and Infectious Disease Experiments to infect beagles with parasites from biting flies, report
[51:43.560 --> 51:48.720]  outlines how the dogs endured months of pain and once researchers had eaten them alive
[51:48.720 --> 51:54.560]  with maggots and they were done with them, they were killed, the maggot lust, yes, that's
[51:54.560 --> 51:56.920]  part of the, the maggotting is one of the religious rights.
[51:56.920 --> 52:02.040]  I've told you about maggotting, that's Google, the finalist shows on maggotting years ago.
[52:02.040 --> 52:10.080]  I'm serious, they actually maggot troops and rituals at US military bases at the VA.
[52:10.080 --> 52:17.120]  They just, they put the flies in their nostrils, up in the sinus to lay eggs and then they
[52:17.120 --> 52:21.280]  just like veterans having maggots eat their brains, I'm not kidding, but here it is right
[52:21.280 --> 52:26.120]  here, maggots eating dogs, so let me continue, report outlines how dogs endured months of
[52:26.120 --> 52:30.520]  pain and once researchers were done with them, they were killed.
[52:30.520 --> 52:38.120]  The NIAID test order states that 28 beagles were to be allowed to develop infections for
[52:38.120 --> 52:42.040]  three months before being euthanized for blood collection.
[52:42.040 --> 52:48.000]  The records obtained during the FOI request show the dogs vocalized pain during the experiments.
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.800]  You didn't like maggots, special screwworms eating you?
[52:51.800 --> 52:55.760]  Who had been eradicated in the US but thought she was bringing back screwworms.
[52:55.760 --> 53:00.720]  Torturing and killing dogs was loving innocent creatures on earth, I disagree with Steve
[53:00.720 --> 53:03.440]  Watts, I think children are more loving, but I love dogs.
[53:03.440 --> 53:08.720]  With deadly parasites that are extremely dangerous to people, can this guy get more evil?
[53:08.720 --> 53:12.920]  What's next, funding for research on the temperature it's best to roast newborn babies?
[53:12.920 --> 53:15.280]  Well, we already sold our organs, why not?
[53:15.280 --> 53:21.740]  Breaking down the report, Fox News host Ben Dominic noted that if Dr. Fauci thought Rand
[53:21.740 --> 53:25.880]  Paul was mad at him, wait until the animal activists see this.
[53:25.880 --> 53:30.920]  Actually PETA is controlled by Eugenicist and Dr. Peter Singer and actually likes all
[53:30.920 --> 53:35.920]  of this and I told you before it ever came out on the news that PETA pressures its members
[53:35.920 --> 53:42.080]  to go adopt dogs and cats so the leadership of PETA can sacrifice them.
[53:42.080 --> 53:47.000]  By the way, I'm not saying any of this for effect, this is all true.
[53:47.000 --> 53:52.200]  See the people that tell you they care about dogs and cats don't.
[53:52.200 --> 53:56.640]  They just want you to see them as the leader, like oh we're guarding the earth from carbon
[53:56.640 --> 54:02.640]  that plants breathe, oh well they engage in the destruction of earth.
[54:02.640 --> 54:07.680]  So this went viral, Alex Jones was right, goes viral on Twitter for exposing fetal organ
[54:07.680 --> 54:14.200]  harvesting and it became a really, really big top story out there and got picked up
[54:14.200 --> 54:22.360]  by a lot of large publications and I've just run out of time on this subject and I really
[54:22.360 --> 54:27.580]  need to get back into it, plus there's this new Gisling Maxwell Atlantic monthly Atlantic
[54:27.580 --> 54:33.080]  Council news, the Jeffrey Epstein Council and I mean these are gods up above us, these
[54:33.080 --> 54:40.760]  are lords, oh my gosh but we're going to talk about these lofty individuals, they're just
[54:40.760 --> 54:49.080]  so powerful that we can't even imagine the visions of their mind even though I'm so sad
[54:49.080 --> 54:52.600]  for them, I think they're going to end up in fates far worse than Jeffrey in that jail
[54:52.600 --> 55:00.520]  cell or Gisling in that jail cell, something tells me that they don't have to wait until
[55:00.520 --> 55:07.360]  they die to suffer payment for what they've done in retribution, something tells me it's
[55:07.360 --> 55:12.240]  going to happen over and over again, that's why the universe works, goodness and victory
[55:12.240 --> 55:18.240]  and love and passion and honor just happens over and over again where it happens but where
[55:18.240 --> 55:25.520]  dishonor and evil happens it so grows there, so let us not hate these people, let us turn
[55:25.520 --> 55:30.920]  from their stench and just thank God and the stars He created that we are not with those
[55:30.920 --> 55:40.760]  people and their abomination, desolation and their system of Satan, their church of destruction,
[55:40.760 --> 55:52.160]  their church of failure, their temple of weakness, separately there isn't a place in the world
[55:52.160 --> 55:56.480]  that you can fund that's more aggressive in the fight against tyranny and I'm just blessed
[55:56.480 --> 56:01.840]  every day, every minute we're here is just all cake as they say, we've definitely gone
[56:01.840 --> 56:05.080]  in through and beyond and now we're on the other side of the New Orleans takeover and
[56:05.080 --> 56:08.480]  I never thought I'd actually make it into the takeover period but it just shows how weak
[56:08.480 --> 56:12.640]  they are and we're still contending even in their main assault, they would probably fail
[56:12.640 --> 56:18.400]  if they had total air superiority, they don't so they're in a lot of trouble so I do take
[56:18.400 --> 56:25.040]  some pleasure in that, I just hope that listeners will understand that Michael and Dell is also

[59:50.280 --> 59:55.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:55.400 --> 1:00:08.440]  Remember the borders wide open while they're telling you you've got to go in her lock-down
[1:00:08.440 --> 1:00:32.040]  Infowars the most banned network in the world one of the biggest developments the last year and a
[1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:38.920]  half of this insane COVID saga has now taken place as most of you know we've been down to the
[1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:44.520]  border six seven times with our crew in the last year and a half it is wide open on the Texas
[1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:50.120]  Mexican border we were just there a month ago and they reported over a thousand people a week
[1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:55.400]  are dumped off at one Catholic charity many of which are COVID positive and when they're
[1:00:55.400 --> 1:00:59.480]  COVID positive because they test them right there they don't send them back to Mexico they
[1:00:59.480 --> 1:01:03.160]  don't send them to the hospital they don't send them to quarantine they dump them out of the street
[1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:10.040]  well now today McCallan has announced an emergency just since they started counting a few weeks ago
[1:01:10.680 --> 1:01:18.600]  7,000 positive COVID individuals who've been tested at the facility have been dumped down the
[1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:22.760]  street so remember that when you're supposed to wear a mask in your house your kids are supposed
[1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:26.680]  to wear a mask you've had the vaccine you're supposed to still wear a mask because the vaccine
[1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:32.200]  doesn't work when you hear that oh you can't go in a store and uh New York has passed a law that
[1:01:32.200 --> 1:01:37.880]  you've got to have it to get on a train or leave your house or go to a grocery store remember that
[1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:47.480]  while all this is happening one border crossing in south Texas alone 7,000 plus people a thousand
[1:01:47.480 --> 1:01:53.000]  in the last week alone who are COVID positive and remember we sent a crew down there just a week ago
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:58.840]  so it was reported that people that actually sit coughing and and have real breathing men women
[1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:05.320]  and children are dumped off at water burgers so according to biden this is a serious crime according
[1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:10.520]  to buy this is a serious threat but because this is part of his larger agenda to collapse our borders
[1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:14.920]  they're doing it this proves the whole COVID thing is a power grab it's not about keeping us safe it's
[1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:21.640]  not about keeping us from dying it's about the control they can use against citizens who they
[1:02:21.640 --> 1:02:27.400]  just claim oh the contact tracing app on your phone says you came close to somebody we need you to go
[1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:33.640]  to quarantine but when you've actually got COVID and you're actually sick not a symptomatic you're
[1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:40.520]  then dumped out on the street this is the smoking gun of smoking guns and again it just shows the
[1:02:40.520 --> 1:02:46.520]  UN has done a worldwide lockdown for over a year and a half it's caused millions of starved to death
[1:02:46.520 --> 1:02:51.400]  it's caused the third world to collapse eight out of ten migrants who are asked why are you
[1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:57.400]  flood the u.s from latin america from africa from asia from the middle east say after a lockdown
[1:02:57.400 --> 1:03:02.280]  there's no jobs no farming no business so i don't blame these people trying to come here but most
[1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:09.720]  of them are coming here without any money without any future without any job prospects and many of
[1:03:09.720 --> 1:03:13.960]  them are seriously run down and sick and instead of giving them aid instead of giving them medical
[1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:18.920]  treatment when they get here they're dumped down america streets and then the rising COVID numbers
[1:03:18.920 --> 1:03:24.920]  are used as the pretext to further lockdown this country i don't see how biden can do a new lockdown
[1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:29.960]  i don't see how biden can do anything other than be impeached for what he's been doing because
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:35.880]  for months and months and months we have pointed out that open border is allowing a lot of serious
[1:03:35.880 --> 1:03:42.120]  disease and including bubonic plague that's now spread in california nevada and colorada
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:48.440]  they're closing down major parts of the country because of the black plague that's killed hundreds
[1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:52.600]  of millions of people before and again that's part of the open border and it's the same thing with
[1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:58.360]  COVID so i'll be covering this tomorrow my syndicated radio show 11 to 3 p.m central the daily
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:02.520]  color art was very very important i suggest you share this report everyone you know because
[1:04:02.520 --> 1:04:06.840]  this just proves they're not trying to shut things down to protect us from COVID they're
[1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:11.720]  shutting things down selectively to bankrupt the economy put us on to a social credit score
[1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:17.080]  put us on a universal basic income and bankrupt the mainstream economy by saying that small
[1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:21.880]  businesses are not essential this is a corporate consolidation of power and control nothing to
[1:04:21.880 --> 1:04:28.360]  do with safety and what biden's done with months of notice about the COVID surging across the border
[1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:35.560]  proves it 100 and he should be impeached right now for it but regardless the open border and
[1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:40.520]  biden's saying immediately surge the border if i'm elected this was all done premeditatedly
[1:04:40.520 --> 1:04:46.200]  and congress must act to rein in this rogue president and secure our border now it's in the
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:50.920]  constitution that one of the few actions the federal government has jurisdiction over is our
[1:04:50.920 --> 1:04:56.680]  border that's one of the few areas that they are completely derelict in right now i'm alec shones
[1:04:56.680 --> 1:05:01.000]  please spread the word about this report and hopefully we'll be able to stop hello i'm mike

[1:06:38.600 --> 1:06:45.880]  was on with the vanderbilt anderson cooper probably richer than them real wealth has their money hidden
[1:06:47.320 --> 1:06:51.000]  talking about he's sorry for meeting with jeff riebsky and his relationship with him
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:56.680]  and because we already exposed that years ago over a decade ago and the fact that bill gates
[1:06:57.800 --> 1:07:03.960]  lied about all of that bill gates used to live with him when he was in paris
[1:07:04.520 --> 1:07:12.280]  london and new york and zoro ranch and of course the pervert pedophile island
[1:07:12.280 --> 1:07:20.280]  little saint perverts little saint johnson so that's what they do and that's who they are
[1:07:21.320 --> 1:07:25.800]  and so now his wife knows that's all coming out so she's left it miss french
[1:07:28.680 --> 1:07:31.640]  but let's talk about the latest before i get back into bill gates
[1:07:32.600 --> 1:07:37.800]  and how it ties into the atlantic monthly and those people democrat state senator
[1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:42.920]  tony navarate arrested on suspicion with sex with a minor
[1:07:45.880 --> 1:07:49.400]  and we've also got photos of him with polosi and with all the top democrats
[1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:56.920]  i mean they're like arrested one of these guys every day it seems state senator tony navarate
[1:07:56.920 --> 1:08:02.440]  a phoenix democrat was arrested thursday on suspicion of multiple counts of sexual conduct
[1:08:02.440 --> 1:08:08.680]  with a minor navarate was arrested on the 27th avenue and bethany home road and booked into
[1:08:08.680 --> 1:08:13.560]  the america county jail police record show in addition being booked on suspicion of four counts
[1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:17.720]  of sexual conduct with a minor there are other charges police said without elaborating police
[1:08:17.720 --> 1:08:24.120]  said they received a report of at least one alleged incident that occurred in 2019 this is
[1:08:24.120 --> 1:08:28.120]  an arrest whipped through the political circles thursday night the statement thursday senator
[1:08:28.120 --> 1:08:33.480]  democrats said we are aware of our members have been arrested and are awaiting further details
[1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:40.120]  and law enforcement do its job we will not have further comment about that navarate 35
[1:08:40.120 --> 1:08:46.280]  nasferatu was elected to the house in 2016 to serve one term before being elected the state senate
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:53.400]  and there he is with uh guys in the ceremonial garb
[1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:59.080]  them they could show you the videos the folks saying we are groomers we're coming for your
[1:08:59.080 --> 1:09:03.880]  children it's always that similar garb maybe they're just magically wearing it by accident
[1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:10.440]  but they're pirates and they're coming for our liberty they're coming for control of our lives
[1:09:10.440 --> 1:09:15.800]  in my view but i don't think it's my opinion that this country is in the clutches of serious
[1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:21.880]  serious serious evil in fact we've got a three-minute compilation the five-minute
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:26.040]  compilation eight-minute compilation why don't you guys get one of the compilations together
[1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:29.800]  on we're grooming your kids we're coming for them we're going to get them they belong to us
[1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:34.760]  you know we had that compilation long before they had the san francisco choir we're gonna
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:38.360]  corrupt your kids we're gonna get them you're never gonna stop us they belong to us now we're
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:43.880]  coming for them we're gonna recruit them i mean that's what this is this is a assault of all these
[1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:49.240]  weaklings and and and and all these people that have been recruited into this evil
[1:09:49.240 --> 1:09:57.000]  now speaking of weaklings look at this headline the atlantic unvaccinated people belong to no
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:02.120]  fly list senator paul has come out and said these are nightmare authoritarians but what they're
[1:10:02.120 --> 1:10:07.080]  telling you is what biden's getting ready to do now we need to back biden off they'll they'll say
[1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:11.320]  oh jones finally was wrong about something no i want to put pressure on them through the governors
[1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:15.480]  of the states and say no you're not putting us on no fly list we haven't taken your experimental
[1:10:15.480 --> 1:10:21.080]  shot that almost everyone's sick and dying has taken all over the world they admit 95 percent of
[1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:26.360]  the people in the hospitals who are seriously ill had the shot most of those dying had the shot the
[1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:32.520]  opposite of what fowl she said the atlantic says unvaccinated people belong on a no fly list
[1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:35.000]  juliet
[1:10:37.800 --> 1:10:42.680]  came now let's look at some of these folks you've got the editor and chief jeffrey goldberg
[1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:45.960]  who published in this article he's the same guy that
[1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:57.480]  said that we should attack iraq and made up wmd's and you've got the obama homeland security
[1:10:57.480 --> 1:11:02.600]  official juliet cayam calling for unvaccinated people to be put on no fly list and what they're
[1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:07.080]  calling for is an id and a medical system with them in your life
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:13.160]  but let's look at who owns the atlantic
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:20.120]  let's look at that here it is this is a photo we can put the actual digital copy up please on
[1:11:20.120 --> 1:11:26.520]  screen this is uh miss jobs the former wife of steve jobs

[1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:41.560]  fathers like gizlain maxwell's father an israeli slash mi6 agent who ran sex operations across
[1:13:41.560 --> 1:13:48.120]  england and is credited with basically creating pedophilia systems to control all the british
[1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:56.920]  isles these are some sick sick sick puppies and they found it's much more successful having a woman
[1:13:56.920 --> 1:14:05.320]  i guess a woman that would consider herself attractive to seduce everyone into this culture
[1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:12.440]  and in these systems oh i'm not saying this woman juliet cayam working with these other

[1:20:13.240 --> 1:20:33.160]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[1:20:43.240 --> 1:20:55.160]  you're good
[1:20:55.880 --> 1:20:57.160]  so
[1:20:57.160 --> 1:21:09.080]  so
[1:21:10.280 --> 1:21:18.360]  99 plus percent of the hospitalize this is in the news of australia this is in abc news
[1:21:19.160 --> 1:21:23.720]  which is separate than our abc it's it's the australian broadcasting system company
[1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:30.600]  are reporting that thousands of people are in the hospital from covid and one person wasn't
[1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:36.600]  vaccinated it's when i say 99 i mean what is out 3000 plus are in the hospital they're saying and
[1:21:36.600 --> 1:21:42.440]  you've got one person wasn't vaccinated that's like 99.999 i don't know what the math is on that
[1:21:43.640 --> 1:21:45.640]  and then it's the same all over the world
[1:21:48.680 --> 1:21:52.440]  so you can't say oh well it's cuz you know these other companies have higher vaccine rates
[1:21:52.440 --> 1:21:57.080]  so the new variant is just affecting that no it's a bunch of countries with super low vaccination rate
[1:21:58.680 --> 1:22:03.640]  by the way in india they don't even take the same vaccines we do the majority of their sick
[1:22:03.640 --> 1:22:11.320]  took the damn shot because if you they never created a vaccine for a cold virus because
[1:22:11.320 --> 1:22:17.800]  the cold virus is in a protein jacket that is the same as our body very simple i could play you
[1:22:17.800 --> 1:22:23.640]  hundreds of doctors saying it we already know it why did we never have a cold virus vaccine
[1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:31.240]  because it causes autoimmune responses and makes your body eat holes in itself and then you have
[1:22:31.240 --> 1:22:40.280]  strokes and heart attacks and your lungs fail and so these people have taken a shot that does this
[1:22:40.280 --> 1:22:46.760]  and then they can shed it that's confirmed and give it to people so every minute i'm on air just
[1:22:46.760 --> 1:22:55.320]  feel surreal right now every second i'm on air i just cannot believe they actually did it and an
[1:22:55.320 --> 1:23:01.240]  idiot could see they did it and i try to explain this to lawyers i know i try to explain this to
[1:23:01.240 --> 1:23:07.560]  people out of that have degrees insurance salesman you know and they're just like but it's a variant
[1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:13.960]  and i go do you understand that that means the vaccine doesn't work even if you believe it's a
[1:23:13.960 --> 1:23:19.880]  variant and not the vaccine doing it then that means it doesn't work why is it the majority of
[1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:26.680]  the vaccinated because it's the variant it's like an idiocracy they go hey i made the crops grow
[1:23:26.680 --> 1:23:31.320]  well they put gatorade on the crops called brondo you know i think maybe you put water on it that
[1:23:31.320 --> 1:23:38.280]  might make me mean water like out of the toilet i mean it's like it maybe bill gates is right maybe
[1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:42.680]  we do that to kill all these people maybe i'm on the wrong team but i look at gizling maxwell and
[1:23:42.680 --> 1:23:48.120]  steve jobs ex-wife and i just think you know i don't want to hang around with them and and and
[1:23:48.120 --> 1:23:53.720]  you know molest little kids or whatever i just i mean you got the idiot public doesn't even know
[1:23:53.720 --> 1:23:58.280]  they're being murdered you got a bunch of vampire pedophiles got all mighty look at this demon on
[1:23:58.280 --> 1:24:04.280]  screen uk transport minister says vaccines will be needed for travel forever more looks like a
[1:24:04.280 --> 1:24:13.320]  freaking barracuda i mean that person's obviously a psychotic moron and they usually you've got the
[1:24:13.320 --> 1:24:24.840]  predators and then you've got the prey and then you've got those of us that just don't even know
[1:24:24.840 --> 1:24:30.440]  what to do because let me tell you they're already telling the sheep that they're dying because we
[1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:35.480]  didn't take the shot and the sheep are like i took the shot but i'm sick because you didn't take the
[1:24:35.480 --> 1:24:42.040]  shot and but but almost everyone that took the shot sick not us i don't care oh you are bad you
[1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:53.560]  need to you to burn your house down that's right that's what i need to do yep biden just came out
[1:24:53.560 --> 1:25:01.640]  remember he said that 200 million americans died of coven when it was less than uh 600 000 well now
[1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:07.560]  he's done some new math we got that video next segment he's out again in his uh brown suit
[1:25:08.200 --> 1:25:16.040]  biden says 350 million americans are vaccinated which of course is 20 million more in the entire
[1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:22.760]  population that's funny hey but that's better math than hey hey snopes is going to have a fact check
[1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:30.440]  and say that's correct come on snopes you know and last week biden said or two weeks ago he said
[1:25:30.440 --> 1:25:37.000]  yeah i just got my ass wiped snopes said he didn't say that doesn't matter you saw him say it snopes
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:45.080]  is god snopes is king and again remember you get millions and millions of people that take these
[1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:49.000]  shots that aren't vaccines for the majority of the sick and dying and that's being reported by the
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:56.360]  health services but just disregard all that it's the variant so again that means the vaccine doesn't
[1:25:56.360 --> 1:26:01.160]  work even if you buy their official crap but oh they got a booster for that which they said a year
[1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:07.000]  ago they were gonna have a booster this has all been pre-programmed so i i should open the phones
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:11.800]  up ahead of michael and delin my pillow joining us you know it's the big top thing on twitter
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:15.960]  everybody wants me to talk about everybody wants to want to go there do people really want me to
[1:26:15.960 --> 1:26:20.520]  go into the babies held all over the world right now in facilities with their organs taken
[1:26:22.600 --> 1:26:24.280]  because they like to jack the prices up
[1:26:27.720 --> 1:26:33.080]  when they harvest those little guys so they keep my wife sometimes a month usually about a week
[1:26:34.760 --> 1:26:41.080]  they tell mommy okay baby go on take him to special ward sit in the special nurses
[1:26:41.080 --> 1:26:45.800]  and those nurses to make an extra hundred grand a year the special nurses
[1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:51.080]  they sound all the non-disclosures everything else because all would take would be one video
[1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:56.600]  showing the little babies in there being harvested viable born baby and it'd all be over healthy babies
[1:26:57.160 --> 1:27:02.040]  but see that's why evil's moving it's like man we've got people running facilities all over the
[1:27:02.040 --> 1:27:06.840]  country in the world keeping babies alive and murdering them for their organs you don't want to

[1:28:05.880 --> 1:28:09.320]  all the literature i had it on the documents because he had to normalize it in front of

[1:28:15.880 --> 1:28:19.880]  because you've got to normalize something like that you can't just it's kind of like well the

[1:28:38.280 --> 1:28:44.760]  we put up with them and we don't stand up for ourselves so we are lower than animals and now
[1:28:44.760 --> 1:28:48.680]  there might get some traction with fouchy given dogs maggots and letting them eat them alive now

[1:30:15.240 --> 1:30:23.320]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate controlled slaves
[1:30:24.360 --> 1:30:31.240]  worsted slaves just just property from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile
[1:30:31.240 --> 1:30:38.440]  minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control we have to recognize the great
[1:30:38.440 --> 1:30:43.000]  reset post-industrial world which realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:48.920]  and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia it's that choice it's that realization that's
[1:30:48.920 --> 1:30:54.120]  going to change the world and it's the only choice we've got freedom or slavery go to
[1:30:54.120 --> 1:31:00.520]  evil it is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it i'm up here working on
[1:31:00.520 --> 1:31:06.200]  a thursday night in mid april 2021 and i just want to say something i am so blessed and honored to

[1:31:59.640 --> 1:32:06.040]  it is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told
[1:32:06.040 --> 1:32:11.480]  and the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated
[1:32:11.480 --> 1:32:17.960]  water is a big problem consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland
[1:32:17.960 --> 1:32:23.560]  and shuts down its natural functions natural functions which have been known for millennia
[1:32:23.560 --> 1:32:28.760]  the hindu chakras align with the endocrine system the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the
[1:32:28.760 --> 1:32:35.080]  third eye also described as the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher
[1:32:35.080 --> 1:32:41.400]  levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free water is
[1:32:41.400 --> 1:32:48.280]  essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems with the proper filters
[1:32:48.280 --> 1:32:54.360]  will keep your drinking water fluoride free and the pro pure showerhead will seal the deal get them
[1:32:54.360 --> 1:33:10.280]  both today for yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:55.080 --> 1:34:02.600]  sorry took me 45 seconds to get back to the chair here my headset had gone out
[1:34:03.240 --> 1:34:06.520]  so it feeds me the audio back welcome back to the alex jones show here
[1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:16.760]  again i don't do this for dramatic effect i'm really having trouble even doing this show
[1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:24.280]  and that's a paradox it's like this stuff's so horrible that's sitting around and talking about
[1:34:24.280 --> 1:34:29.800]  it almost is like we're part of it i mean they knew these vaccines weren't vaccines they knew it
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:33.800]  was going to make people's bodies attack themselves in their lungs and hearts and brains they knew it
[1:34:33.800 --> 1:34:39.720]  was going to attack the ovaries they had all the damn studies trying to create a vaccine for the cold
[1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:47.240]  which is what this is is is been the holy grail and it's it's well known i mean this is like
[1:34:47.240 --> 1:34:52.840]  very tried and true very known what they did so why would they pick an attack on everybody
[1:34:52.840 --> 1:35:01.560]  that's well known they just have no respect for us and so i'm trying to wrap my mind around this
[1:35:01.560 --> 1:35:08.120]  this whole normalization process and then i'm suddenly seeing articles all over the news about
[1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:12.920]  kathy griffin the one that said kill trump and all that oh she's got lung cancer never
[1:35:12.920 --> 1:35:18.280]  smoked in her life she doesn't know what's happening well i mean you live in los angeles
[1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:23.400]  that's a big giant mountain bowl of 10 million people and it's super toxic i feel sick anytime
[1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:28.120]  i'm there i mean you know that that's that's that you know that's one thing for you but
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:35.320]  she said also i'm fully vaccinated she added that with her little cancer deal well you know
[1:35:35.320 --> 1:35:40.680]  well you guys give me the folder here it is actually this is just a small folder right here
[1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:46.680]  of all the admissions of people getting cancer after the shot they say oh that's normal
[1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:52.280]  in your uterus or your breast or your lymph nodes or other organs like your lungs to go tumors
[1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:57.560]  just tell the doctors don't worry about it for six months that's actually the cdc recommendation
[1:35:57.560 --> 1:36:04.280]  not is it malignant isn't benign which would be science just oh you notice that tumor grew in
[1:36:04.280 --> 1:36:10.280]  about two weeks well just don't worry about that tumor sweetheart but then the doctors don't they
[1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:15.160]  cut out your uterus they cut out your lung they cut out your lymph nodes they cut out your cut
[1:36:15.160 --> 1:36:24.680]  off your testicles they cut off your breast oh it may cause cancer false alarms says abc
[1:36:24.680 --> 1:36:35.320]  and as well then i guess kathy griffin's going to be just fine and now andrew dice clay dealing
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:44.760]  with belph palsy by continuing to perform untouchable and have we looked it up is can we search
[1:36:44.760 --> 1:36:50.600]  andrew dice clay is he has he genuflected has he told us that he took the shot because you
[1:36:50.600 --> 1:36:55.000]  know belph palsy is one of the main things that quote covid shot causes that in guillaume boray
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:00.840]  i mean they admit it does that but if you try to talk about it like evil dr mercola they come to
[1:37:00.840 --> 1:37:05.560]  your house they come to your business they threaten you like i saw the scene in peace they go he puts
[1:37:05.560 --> 1:37:12.440]  out dis info that vitamin d and zinc and c are good to stop viral infections hell you just die without
[1:37:12.440 --> 1:37:18.920]  them and he puts out the dis info that vaccines can be dangerous wow that's why they got a multi
[1:37:18.920 --> 1:37:29.080]  billion dollar fund they pay out every year dr mercola and then i love how they pick a guy like
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:35.240]  him who's very introverted great guy for his age incredible shape you know runs marathons you name
[1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:42.840]  it there's exactly what he's talking about very moral guy but they knew he's an introvert and
[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:47.480]  already said no interviews so he he'll run away so they can act like oh he's scared you don't see
[1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:53.080]  seeing an ambushing me do you know they're scared of me i'll talk to see it in here get your ugly
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:58.680]  asses out here right now seeing in let's go but i'm gonna videotape what you do so you can't edit
[1:37:58.680 --> 1:38:04.440]  it out of context oh no you don't come after me you little slime bags and let me tell you something
[1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:11.080]  seeing and i don't get happy about this which has a universe works you're all gonna get cancer and
[1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:18.680]  so your kids i mean the level of suicide and death and failure by evil people i mean when you get
[1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:25.160]  god out of your life the just the evil energy just takes you over and kills you i mean look at
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:32.440]  mercola he looks like he's like 30 years old and a football player and the guy's old and then and i'm
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:36.120]  certainly not part of myself but life force wise i'm very strong but but just look at him on the
[1:38:36.120 --> 1:38:42.680]  bike and then show the cnn skexie wraith chasing him around
[1:38:45.160 --> 1:38:49.240]  now now he knew they were gonna edit it take it out of context he didn't have a camera on him
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:53.400]  so that's why he wisely went i'm not saying he's bad for leaving in fact if i was riding around
[1:38:53.400 --> 1:38:56.840]  on him you know bicycle had they come up i probably leave too because i didn't have a crew there but
[1:38:56.840 --> 1:39:00.920]  i'm telling cnn you want to come to papa just like pierce morgan did let's go
[1:39:00.920 --> 1:39:10.600]  go oh the doctor's a super spreader not only is the virus bad but oh information's a virus yeah
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:18.040]  that's what cnn calls me as a virus of course what's more colonel he says what do you do you go out
[1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:24.360]  and get sun you're like a plant you gotta have it to live is he stupid no who lives the longest in
[1:39:24.360 --> 1:39:30.200]  the world people in italy people in japan that are farmers who culturally till the fields and work
[1:39:30.200 --> 1:39:35.880]  the fields with their shirts off that's why in japan the ruling class wraps themselves in in all that
[1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:40.280]  that's how started the muslim world or before that the arabic world because royalty had to
[1:39:40.280 --> 1:39:45.880]  have real white skin those that had red skin or brown skin were associated with the lower classes
[1:39:45.880 --> 1:39:54.280]  that's what schwarzenegger means black farmer not because arnold schwarzenegger was uh comes from
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:40:02.040]  black people but but but in the old german in that old visigoth you know type language
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:07.480]  that's what they call the lower classes was the black people and the higher classes the white
[1:40:07.480 --> 1:40:13.880]  people because the the the kings didn't go out and told the fields well i want to be black and i
[1:40:13.880 --> 1:40:19.640]  don't mean copy average i got red skin baby i need this time i get depressed without it i get jealous
[1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:24.280]  looking at mercol all baked in that florida sign give it to me give it to me give it to me and i'm
[1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:29.080]  not bashing white people that can't tan and i've got a daughter that's got porcelain beautiful skin
[1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:35.240]  she can't tan tell my son can't tan so nothing against folks that can't tan i'm just telling you
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:41.160]  that that's what you need baby look at him almost what it's almost 70 years old look what he looks
[1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:47.160]  like he's a freaking football player in college and then look at this idiot running along behind
[1:40:47.160 --> 1:40:51.400]  him like like like like he's done something wrong and he's the bad guy
[1:40:56.680 --> 1:41:06.440]  meanwhile i got this whole stack here people going in after the shot cancers grow within weeks and
[1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:15.400]  they cut them out because they're malignant and it goes on and on and on and they want to shut us
[1:41:15.400 --> 1:41:20.440]  down but you know what you haven't shut us down that's why i love these listeners that's why i
[1:41:20.440 --> 1:41:28.120]  appreciate these listeners because uh this is a serious war and we knew we knew i mean i said it
[1:41:29.080 --> 1:41:32.280]  chris sky said it from the documents anybody looks at these is smart can tell you
[1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:39.400]  we said by the fall there'll be a new lockdown of this year last year and it'll be worse this
[1:41:39.400 --> 1:41:44.920]  time because these vaccines shed the literature the study show i mean they had to pass a law in
[1:41:44.920 --> 1:41:51.400]  the EU last year before they approved these vaccines saying you can viral shed
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:59.080]  from an mRNA shot and that people can infect others and have no liability they're not just
[1:41:59.080 --> 1:42:05.320]  given the vaccine makers liability now protection they're doing it for shedding what's that tell you
[1:42:08.280 --> 1:42:11.480]  and that's why biden said you're going to have more restrictions more guidelines they've already
[1:42:11.480 --> 1:42:17.800]  got them written up but they're getting all the stores and the shops one of my crew members tried
[1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:22.600]  to go to pop ice chicken yesterday and go in it's already shut down in austin this is the health
[1:42:22.600 --> 1:42:30.680]  department said so outside of law and their answer you're gonna stay shut in till you take our new
[1:42:30.680 --> 1:42:41.560]  shot when almost everyone's sick 95% in israel 99.99999% in australia all is this anything the
[1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:46.200]  vaccine is the plague but people can't admit they're being assaulted they can't admit they're
[1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:51.240]  being attacked they can't believe that bill gates wants to hurt him even though bill gates says i
[1:42:51.240 --> 1:42:59.480]  want to kill you i want to kill you i want to kill you now take my shot it was our number
[1:42:59.480 --> 1:43:04.600]  two best-selling product until the ongoing covid lockdowns destroyed the supply chain and it's been
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:09.400]  six months since we had bodies our ultimate turmeric formula and what's been holding up the last few
[1:43:09.400 --> 1:43:14.120]  months is the bottle cap that's why this one's white i said i don't care if the cap doesn't match

[1:43:56.760 --> 1:44:06.520]  still can there's one central fact of criminal psychology the criminologists all agree on and
[1:44:06.520 --> 1:44:12.120]  that it's criminals are extremely pathological even more the general public they do the same
[1:44:12.120 --> 1:44:18.120]  things over and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again
[1:44:18.120 --> 1:44:27.400]  well guess what it was anthony fouchy and eugenesis globalist that ran the rollout of hiv and the
[1:44:27.400 --> 1:44:32.040]  mistreatment of it with azt and other chemicals that actually killed more people than hiv and they
[1:44:32.040 --> 1:44:37.240]  were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the t-lymph
[1:44:37.240 --> 1:44:43.560]  besides the body and create autoimmune disorders the problem for them was the viruses would then
[1:44:43.560 --> 1:44:49.320]  break down and would be non-lethal down the road that's why they need to roll out the covet 19 and
[1:44:49.320 --> 1:44:54.440]  the vaccine because now they admit the covet 19 vaccine destroys your immune system basically giving
[1:44:54.440 --> 1:45:01.400]  you the equivalent of hiv that's right ladies and gentlemen when listeners call to the show and thank

[1:48:10.920 --> 1:48:18.840]  percent hospitalized fully vaccinated big article info wars.com get it change the headline do whatever
[1:48:18.840 --> 1:48:26.920]  you want put your name on it i don't care just get it out meanwhile knowingly exposing others
[1:48:26.920 --> 1:48:31.240]  hiv is no longer a felony in california they changed that four years ago
[1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:36.600]  they also basically legalized pedophilia giving kids inoculations on the h12 without
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:43.560]  parental consent it's all about raping innocence you see germany and the e you passed a law this
[1:48:43.560 --> 1:48:50.120]  year allowing viral spread from vaccines because that's what these mRNA vaccines do is they make
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:58.520]  you become a factory of that so that's what's going on that's what's happening and here is the
[1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:06.760]  white house on august 2nd biden health official says it's time to impose requirements that's
[1:49:06.760 --> 1:49:12.360]  mandates they get vaccinated against covet 19 with Fauci and they had the cdc looking on they had
[1:49:12.360 --> 1:49:17.960]  their minion do it and announced the crime the nuremberg code violating crime and now they're
[1:49:17.960 --> 1:49:24.600]  getting ready to do lockdown too because they've got to act like there's an emergency going on
[1:49:24.600 --> 1:49:29.640]  because there is because all these people sick and dying who've taken the vaccine and then those
[1:49:29.640 --> 1:49:35.800]  getting sick and dying now that are getting the virus protein sloughed off onto them they admit
[1:49:40.040 --> 1:49:45.400]  and what type of people would do this well the type of people that have thousands of studies
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:52.680]  going in the u.s alone god china they say is even more horrific with beagle puppies where they implant
[1:49:52.680 --> 1:49:58.520]  them with flesh-eating screwworms see the average maggot the average larva of a fly doesn't eat
[1:49:58.520 --> 1:50:04.840]  live meat but screwworms do and they've got a lot of varieties of screwworms that were eradicated
[1:50:04.840 --> 1:50:09.720]  in the u.s but Fauci wants to bring screwworms back oh this isn't satire this isn't me riding a
[1:50:09.720 --> 1:50:18.280]  clive barker hellraisers prequel this is this is this is on Fauci screensaver i'm serious he
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:22.280]  punches up laboratories i've been around these guys not him but others like oh there's the monkey
[1:50:22.280 --> 1:50:27.800]  lab there's the dog lab they enjoy watching a dog with maggots been planted throughout his body dying
[1:50:28.360 --> 1:50:32.280]  like i told you the va got by the way this is not a joke if you're a listener it's on enforce.com
[1:50:32.280 --> 1:50:41.160]  Fauci implanted beagle puppies with pleasure with maggots to eat their bodies and then finally kill
[1:50:41.160 --> 1:50:52.360]  them now nobody cares about humans but he of course scalped babies alive and put their skin
[1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:56.840]  onto rats but that was just part of what he did that's all come out too but he's the good man
[1:50:56.840 --> 1:51:04.040]  that works for bill gates he's the good man that did the inoculation program for different
[1:51:04.040 --> 1:51:10.680]  supposed pathogens in the new york gay community in the late 1970s where hiv popped up he's a nice
[1:51:11.720 --> 1:51:17.560]  nice man like gisling maxwell and steve jobs with a running all this uh continuing alex jones
[1:51:18.120 --> 1:51:23.160]  was right goes viral on twitter for exposing fetal organ harvesting and i mentioned this but let me
[1:51:23.160 --> 1:51:27.880]  just go over it i appreciate jack posovic when a bunch of documents came out confirming this is
[1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:34.440]  going on at major universities and that they are keeping babies alive sometimes for weeks
[1:51:34.440 --> 1:51:40.120]  so that they can auction off their livers and kidneys see these organs only live a few hours
[1:51:40.680 --> 1:51:47.240]  maximum if if they're not hooked to the blood supply but if you can keep the baby alive when
[1:51:47.240 --> 1:51:51.480]  it's in the in the third trimester partial abortion and then violate federal law because
[1:51:51.480 --> 1:51:55.560]  you're supposed to kill it inside the womb well then you can do that but the university is bragging
[1:51:55.560 --> 1:52:01.000]  here how they were delivered whole babies hearts still beating back i don't have a way with words
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:06.360]  do i should have just said up front a government documents for your confirms a fouchy programs
[1:52:06.360 --> 1:52:12.520]  fouchy driven run programs many of which he has his name on didn't just scalp babies and put their
[1:52:12.520 --> 1:52:17.400]  hair on rats and mice no no it's more liberal more loving than that
[1:52:17.400 --> 1:52:19.400]  that
[1:52:20.040 --> 1:52:29.400]  they delivered whole babies hearts beating to the universities and i'll just tell you we know
[1:52:29.400 --> 1:52:33.480]  what they do they also wrecked the babies so uh and i'm sorry i have to tell you that they also
[1:52:33.480 --> 1:52:37.320]  have sex with their babies okay uh that came out because they're still living sorry they have sex
[1:52:37.320 --> 1:52:40.840]  with them before they kill them uh that's a religion to them that came out i told you this
[1:52:40.840 --> 1:52:45.800]  20 years ago came out in documents in texas and in missouri other areas where they do rituals and
[1:52:45.800 --> 1:52:50.200]  have sex with the babies they go oh man your baby's been aborted and the doctor goes and have sex with
[1:52:50.200 --> 1:52:54.360]  it with the with the nurses behind the scenes they rub blood all over each other i mean i mean
[1:52:54.360 --> 1:52:57.480]  why would you want to be in a place that killed nine month old babies because you want to have
[1:52:57.480 --> 1:53:02.120]  sex with them now remember you're a new viewer you're tuning in you're like and see i think a lot
[1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:06.040]  of stuff i haven't told you yet but i will just let's just start telling you everything they
[1:53:06.040 --> 1:53:09.560]  these are people that want to have sex with living babies before they kill them
[1:53:09.560 --> 1:53:16.200]  and then after they're done raping the baby and it screams and cries then they go and they
[1:53:17.080 --> 1:53:22.280]  take its heart first the liver the kidneys the spoint all the different organs the kid
[1:53:22.280 --> 1:53:27.000]  and then they take the heart and then they suck all the blood out and then they take all the fat
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:32.120]  and all the tissue and all the bones and they sell every bit of it a ritual of hate and greed
[1:53:32.120 --> 1:53:37.720]  and pure satanism and that's who fouchy is when he's not implanting baby dogs with maggots
[1:53:37.720 --> 1:53:44.040]  they are taking babies and scalping them and implanting it on rats and his little vampire
[1:53:44.040 --> 1:53:51.000]  servants are in there hunched over the babies while they cry for mommy raping them so there you go
[1:53:51.880 --> 1:53:56.840]  now you wonder why they put protein crystals and vaccines to kill you and your family because
[1:53:56.840 --> 1:54:02.520]  they're satan worshipers that have gone to the ends of the universe they've gone straight to hell
[1:54:02.520 --> 1:54:10.120]  straight to hell down a black hole and anything you can imagine they do and that's it from implanting
[1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:16.360]  maggots and dogs to eat them alive so fouchy can watch it on the screen he just loves knowing those
[1:54:16.360 --> 1:54:21.960]  dogs are in pain itching and bleeding with maggots eating your flesh gobbling them whole he loves
[1:54:21.960 --> 1:54:25.880]  knowing that keep those babies alive and take those organs and he loves knowing he's implanted you
[1:54:25.880 --> 1:54:30.440]  with that deadly prion crystal and now it's spreading to everyone else and he's going to murder you
[1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:35.640]  he's got power over you he's been given power by satan over you and he is a servant of satan who
[1:54:35.640 --> 1:54:42.120]  is so proud of what he's doing and he's going to get your children you can look it up where they do
[1:54:42.120 --> 1:54:48.840]  satanic rituals with the baby's bodies but that's just child's play that's low level stuff for fouchy
[1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:55.880]  he likes to kill hundreds of millions of billions but his his his minions they you know they they
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:55:01.560]  get to you know it's like when cal Dracula gives the baby to his his his women oh you go have fun
[1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:08.840]  with this little baby here they're like oh that's all just little examples of what they do and how
[1:55:08.840 --> 1:55:13.560]  they operate and what they've got planned for you and your family okay so there you go there's fouchy
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:18.600]  thought you might want to know what he's up to today and by the way everything but the raping
[1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:23.240]  babies is documented on record the maggots and the dogs keeping babies alive taking their organs
[1:55:23.240 --> 1:55:27.320]  which is all just as evil as having sex with them but you have to understand the satanists like to
[1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:33.480]  have sex in churches at night that's that's called a blasphemy that's the high holy thing they do and
[1:55:33.480 --> 1:55:40.840]  they they they they they want to defile children and the highest order is to rape a child that's
[1:55:40.840 --> 1:55:46.360]  black Sabbath and then kill them and so these people are carrying out black Sabbaths at an
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:51.240]  industrial level the poor little kids grabbed out of Mexico and Latin America they're being fed
[1:55:51.240 --> 1:55:54.920]  they're being handed over they're being tortured they're being raped they're being beaten they're
[1:55:54.920 --> 1:55:59.480]  being enslaved it's all in a front to God to drive God's spirit out of the land so they're
[1:55:59.480 --> 1:56:05.800]  going to have full power and kill everybody so there you go there's the rest of story

[2:00:27.560 --> 2:00:33.240]  andrew kwomo governor of new york is every bit the creep you thought he was and more he talks
[2:00:33.240 --> 2:00:42.520]  like a mafia leader and he acts like one 11 sexual harassment claims against him public today if
[2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:48.360]  you're interested go over to cnn right now and watch jeffrey tubin of all people talk about how
[2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:53.800]  creepy governor kwomo is because this country just couldn't get better we're gonna have a lot
[2:00:53.800 --> 2:00:59.880]  more on that in just a minute but first tonight welcome to tucker carlson tonight coming to you
[2:00:59.880 --> 2:01:06.360]  from budapest hungary last summer as the covet pandemic raged throughout the united states people
[2:01:06.360 --> 2:01:11.880]  who still read the new york times began to notice something very strange happening at the paper
[2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:16.200]  hundreds of articles that had appeared there going back nearly a decade
[2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:21.960]  suddenly vanished they disappeared there's no way to find them nothing like this had ever happened
[2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:27.240]  the new york times considers itself very self-consciously a living historical record the
[2:01:27.240 --> 2:01:32.840]  paper maintains meticulous searchable archives going back to before the civil war to 1851
[2:01:33.720 --> 2:01:39.960]  yet last august a huge number of articles just disappeared so what was in those articles
[2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:44.600]  we know the answer because a handful of history-minded readers preserved them
[2:01:44.600 --> 2:01:49.960]  when they first appeared every one of them was a propaganda piece paid for by the chinese
[2:01:49.960 --> 2:01:54.760]  communist party all designed to look like news articles you're seeing on them on your screen
[2:01:54.760 --> 2:02:02.840]  right now it reads china watch dou islands belong to china that's the headline now why would the
[2:02:02.840 --> 2:02:09.720]  new york times america's paper of record print propaganda from a totalitarian regime and pretend
[2:02:09.720 --> 2:02:15.320]  it was a news article well for money financial filings show the new york times made more than
[2:02:15.320 --> 2:02:20.680]  a hundred thousand dollars a month from this garbage those payments were not disclosed at the time
[2:02:20.680 --> 2:02:24.840]  they were hidden from new york times readers they were only uncovered after the fact by the
[2:02:24.840 --> 2:02:29.720]  washington free beacon and the times wasn't the only news organization that did this that took
[2:02:29.720 --> 2:02:35.640]  money from the chinese communist party since 2016 the chinese communist party paid 20 million
[2:02:35.640 --> 2:02:42.120]  dollars to outlets like the los angeles times the chicago tribune and the washington post
[2:02:42.840 --> 2:02:47.800]  twitter which now operates as a publisher also recheese received checks from the chinese
[2:02:47.800 --> 2:02:52.840]  government totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars now these arrangements as we said
[2:02:52.840 --> 2:02:57.800]  continued for years and then last summer they stopped abruptly the new york times tried to
[2:02:57.800 --> 2:03:04.600]  hide the evidence that any of it ever happened but why the new york times won't say when we asked
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:09.400]  we do not discuss revenue beyond what is in our quarterly earnings report a spokesman told us this
[2:03:09.400 --> 2:03:14.840]  morning so we kept looking but first here's some context for what the new york times did
[2:03:15.480 --> 2:03:20.600]  this is what mainstream news coverage in the united states looked like for most of last year as you
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:25.560]  watch it see if you can tell the difference between this and what you might see on chinese state
[2:03:25.560 --> 2:03:31.480]  television the president referred to the corona virus as a quote foreign virus and i think it's
[2:03:31.480 --> 2:03:36.680]  going to smack uh it's going to come across to a lot of americans as spacking of a xenophobia
[2:03:36.680 --> 2:03:42.120]  xenophobic wartime trump where he thinks the only path now is to basically declare the virus
[2:03:42.120 --> 2:03:47.960]  public enemy number one uh painted in somewhat racist terms the xenophobia and the racism
[2:03:47.960 --> 2:03:53.720]  and outbreak is such a common thing and it is incredibly dangerous it is problematic and it
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:03:59.160]  is scary and i just really want to call that out why do you keep calling this the chinese virus
[2:03:59.160 --> 2:04:04.680]  why do you keep using this a lot of people say it's racist it's not racist at all no not at all
[2:04:04.680 --> 2:04:14.680]  it comes from china that's why so as this virus emerged from central china to kill americans in
[2:04:14.680 --> 2:04:20.120]  huge numbers and people throughout the west news organizations in this country made the same
[2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:27.000]  aggressively pro china noises almost all of them politico for example hired a full-time china shill
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:32.360]  called david wartime joined articles with headlines like this quote the verdict is in
[2:04:32.360 --> 2:04:38.120]  china has outperformed while the once respected american system has disastrously faltered
[2:04:39.320 --> 2:04:43.240]  now as you read that once again you wonder how is that different from what the chinese would
[2:04:43.240 --> 2:04:49.000]  write about themselves well it's not different the american media were especially hysterical on
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:53.480]  the question of where the coronavirus came from all right we'll be back with mike lindell but yeah

[2:06:41.640 --> 2:06:47.640]  mike lindell is a hero he's standing up for our american republic for integrity our election system
[2:06:47.640 --> 2:06:51.800]  i could play you hours of videos from just a year ago two years ago three years ago
[2:06:51.800 --> 2:06:57.240]  of democrats saying they don't trust the very companies that mike lindell has brought out and
[2:06:57.240 --> 2:07:03.480]  talked about we we've played those clips you've all seen them and then he says things milder than
[2:07:03.480 --> 2:07:09.240]  that and he gets sued and and and that's because these organizations are scared of what's coming out
[2:07:09.240 --> 2:07:14.280]  but i know at the retail level was come out in georgia and arizona other states with them
[2:07:14.280 --> 2:07:18.680]  sitting the same ballots through over and over again we caught that on tape that's all coming out
[2:07:18.680 --> 2:07:23.240]  and now the justice department run by this puppet president says they want to try to stop
[2:07:24.520 --> 2:07:30.440]  those audits and those findings so that vindicates what mike lindell has done he's been attacked
[2:07:30.440 --> 2:07:35.000]  he's been demonized he's got a big symposium coming up uh next week that's going to be

[2:08:36.760 --> 2:08:42.520]  uh let's get into the panic mode there and i want to play a clip here and get your full context
[2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:47.800]  of cnn where they're trying to say you've been conned you've been manipulated you say hey
[2:08:48.680 --> 2:08:49.960]  let me give you a hug here it is
[2:08:54.520 --> 2:08:59.320]  you could possibly be the victim of a scam here well then why don't you come to a
[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:03.560]  there's some policy of a make five million dollars are you worried about me we should give a hug
[2:09:03.560 --> 2:09:09.480]  you're worried about home mic oh god bless you i love how you kill them a kind list just like
[2:09:09.480 --> 2:09:14.840]  we've been on the some of the other national comedy shows uh tell us more about that interview and
[2:09:14.840 --> 2:09:19.880]  how the media is attacking you well that means that was a two and a half hour interview everybody
[2:09:19.880 --> 2:09:25.400]  there's a lady they came they came we did at mini apis and uh we had to go down they were adamant
[2:09:25.400 --> 2:09:29.800]  they wanted me to come down there they wouldn't come out here and i said you know what uh well
[2:09:29.800 --> 2:09:37.160]  once again it's like mike why would you do that for cnn well because where's fox shame on fox right
[2:09:37.160 --> 2:09:42.120]  so anyway i drive i go down there two and a half hours as someone holding a thing up behind me
[2:09:42.120 --> 2:09:47.960]  asking this asking this attack this but we recorded the whole thing we had i had two of my guys we
[2:09:47.960 --> 2:09:54.280]  recorded the whole thing and i'll tell you they tried to you know they took the combined things
[2:09:54.280 --> 2:10:01.720]  tried to try to uh come oh like here this data that i gave them that was just a data from the
[2:10:01.720 --> 2:10:07.560]  from the 2020 election and it's basically here come to the symposium it's kind of like a preliminary
[2:10:07.560 --> 2:10:13.720]  here you go show them what you're gonna see and uh cnn i mean i'm going why why don't you guys come
[2:10:13.720 --> 2:10:17.400]  and get you know like i say i've offered five million dollars to anyone there that can prove
[2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:23.480]  it's not valid data from the 2020 november election instead they try and do a hit job ahead of time
[2:10:23.480 --> 2:10:29.720]  but once again it sure got the word out because that's all we need everybody i have all the i
[2:10:29.720 --> 2:10:37.560]  have it all i have all the evidence 100 all the states all 50 states it's gonna uh it's gonna
[2:10:37.560 --> 2:10:43.000]  show what happened in not just the swing states but every single state we're gonna have like a
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:48.680]  behind us will be have these five uh um we're gonna have like a table of five there podium
[2:10:48.680 --> 2:10:52.760]  and this is it's gonna be like election night kind of we're gonna go back and forth to the
[2:10:52.760 --> 2:10:58.440]  to the mock election room the cyber the cyber center and then we'll be up front hey this just in
[2:10:58.440 --> 2:11:03.400]  the state of new hampshire goes to donald trump and then you know we'll have this backed up by the
[2:11:03.400 --> 2:11:08.600]  way the state of new hampshire remember when per biden they say no it didn't donald trump won
[2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:14.120]  and uh so we're gonna do all 50 states we've got the cyber forensic experts that have looked at
[2:11:14.120 --> 2:11:19.640]  all this they they're gonna do they're gonna speak tell you here here it is this is 100
[2:11:19.640 --> 2:11:25.000]  valid and then we're gonna break out all the cyber experts that have come from around the country
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:31.720]  and remember we even have lead stories the fact book fake checkers at the facebook that are coming
[2:11:31.720 --> 2:11:37.480]  with their own cyber guy and some other fact checkers so to speak bringing their cyber guys
[2:11:37.480 --> 2:11:41.800]  so we have a lot of naysayers there and they're gonna break out into into our rooms and then
[2:11:41.800 --> 2:11:46.360]  we'll we'll pull them out about every three hours and say well what have you found so far
[2:11:46.360 --> 2:11:51.320]  and it's going to be amazing or by the time this is done by the time it gets to our closing
[2:11:51.320 --> 2:11:56.680]  because we're going to go 72 hours it goes nine to nine we're going to live stream in a frank
[2:11:56.680 --> 2:12:01.560]  speech dot com continually at nine to nine we're going to flip it's on head because everyone
[2:12:01.560 --> 2:12:06.520]  overseas wants to see this too by the way we're going to have another speaker from another country
[2:12:06.520 --> 2:12:12.200]  i'm going to surprise you very high up i in government really high up in because all the other
[2:12:12.200 --> 2:12:17.560]  countries are worried too the ones that have these machines and the china takeover in this and
[2:12:18.760 --> 2:12:23.800]  so it's going to be uh this it's all come down to this just like that commercial says that uh
[2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:29.320]  that fox was the only one that didn't run it shame on fox i mean it's disgusting that the
[2:12:29.320 --> 2:12:34.440]  alex i'm sorry i'm still a little sore with fox they should be there telling everybody about this
[2:12:34.440 --> 2:12:39.640]  this is news well especially after you spent so much money with them an american company
[2:12:39.640 --> 2:12:44.680]  and all your ad says has drawn me for a symposium on cyber security well who's against the cyber
[2:12:44.680 --> 2:12:48.920]  security imposing i mean that shows they've got a lot of pressure put on them and the system is
[2:12:48.920 --> 2:12:55.240]  scared of this yeah 100 and i want everyone to know this isn't uh fox didn't just lose on this
[2:12:55.240 --> 2:13:01.080]  they're 50 million my pillow did that's another million dollars we were taking a hit for but
[2:13:01.080 --> 2:13:06.600]  i'm not going to do oh i need money so i so i succumb to this cancel culture with fox leading
[2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:11.320]  the way you know they wouldn't run this ad where is it coming to when they all of a sudden they're
[2:13:11.320 --> 2:13:16.040]  not going to run as they're going to maybe that's an ad for a concert oh yeah let's see who's playing
[2:13:16.040 --> 2:13:20.280]  and then decide well we don't want them to play that this is our first amendment right a free
[2:13:20.280 --> 2:13:25.720]  speech and i said it before alex i said at the last week i said fox should become a weather channel
[2:13:25.720 --> 2:13:30.120]  and then i changed it the next day and i said you know what probably not because they probably
[2:13:30.120 --> 2:13:37.000]  wouldn't report an oncoming storm exactly that's a great point let's talk about cnn's claim of no
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:42.120]  evidence whether they say have you been conned have you been manipulated uh speak to that and and
[2:13:42.120 --> 2:13:45.960]  how do you know i'm sure you've had other cyber security experts look at what you were brought
[2:13:45.960 --> 2:13:52.360]  or how have you verified this information i i have spent the last five months since the day
[2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:57.960]  i got the first piece of evidence on january night and i got that everybody knows i've been
[2:13:57.960 --> 2:14:03.640]  attacked every day i put out the movie absolute proof but there was we you know we cut off the
[2:14:03.640 --> 2:14:08.840]  tail of the ip addresses i didn't at that time that was on february fifth i didn't want dominion
[2:14:08.840 --> 2:14:14.040]  going out there and smashing their own machines and and getting rid of the evidence so i didn't
[2:14:14.040 --> 2:14:19.480]  i didn't do anything then but then the last four months i've hired white hat hackers they protect
[2:14:19.480 --> 2:14:25.000]  our country and different ones they don't know each other these are cyber forensic experts the
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:30.280]  best in the world they've looked at it validated and it's all there from the start of the election
[2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:37.720]  to the end cyber packet captures and data it shows every state and it's one thing it's great to have
[2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:42.440]  a complete set too because otherwise say let's say you're in wisconsin well how do we know in
[2:14:42.440 --> 2:14:47.640]  northern wisconsin they didn't vote from biden to trump well because we had the whole election
[2:14:47.640 --> 2:14:54.280]  everybody so cnn when they tried to say there that uh oh yeah michael indell he's gonna we're worried
[2:14:54.280 --> 2:15:00.360]  about mike you know he might lose his reputation and he might uh hurt his company you know i mean
[2:15:00.360 --> 2:15:05.880]  the guy drew interviewing me i go really oh now you really came out here because you care about me
[2:15:05.880 --> 2:15:12.840]  no you came out here to do some big hit job on me and say the evidence isn't valid what more can i
[2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:19.880]  say to the people come to the symposium watch the cyber symposium cnn was invited they can't you know
[2:15:19.880 --> 2:15:25.320]  come there and if you can prove that i'm wrong on that that is route from the uh the 2020 election
[2:15:25.320 --> 2:15:29.000]  you get five million exactly why are they trying to stop because the mainstream media has been
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:32.600]  trying to stop and others have been trying to stop you even having this event and not running your
[2:15:32.600 --> 2:15:36.920]  ad that that doesn't look good you're putting your money up your energy and and it's put up

[2:21:41.720 --> 2:21:47.400]  this to the supreme court but all these states are it's just all separate every state's going to
[2:21:47.400 --> 2:21:51.800]  want to do an audit not just the six in question let me show you what we're going to tell you at
[2:21:51.800 --> 2:21:57.320]  the symposium do you know new hampshire went to donald trump minnesota went to donald trump of
[2:21:57.320 --> 2:22:03.400]  course all those other five we talk about georgia philadelphia or pennsylvania michigan havada i mean
[2:22:03.400 --> 2:22:08.200]  all these but we're gonna have stuff on there you're gonna get real data that uh let's say it's
[2:22:08.200 --> 2:22:13.720]  ohio what did donald trump really went ohio by almost double florida every single thing we're
[2:22:13.720 --> 2:22:17.960]  going to talk about north carolina how they tried to take north carolina too you know so this is
[2:22:17.960 --> 2:22:23.160]  going to be absolutely amazing but you've got this this main thing that we have all the packet
[2:22:23.160 --> 2:22:28.120]  captures and and the data and then you've got all these things you talk about alex with all these
[2:22:28.120 --> 2:22:33.400]  states they're just it's all going to come down we're going to i'm telling you everybody this
[2:22:33.400 --> 2:22:38.440]  election is getting pulled down just like i said months ago and our real president's going to be
[2:22:38.440 --> 2:22:42.600]  back in well mike i know you're working around the clock of the six months we have left with you
[2:22:42.600 --> 2:22:45.880]  and how long i might just drive to cisco myself because i met you before but i really love what
[2:22:45.880 --> 2:22:50.840]  you're doing i've given you my advice you're as smart as i am or smarter we're both entrepreneurs
[2:22:50.840 --> 2:22:55.640]  american patriots that and you're not putting all your eggs in one basket with a symposium and and
[2:22:55.640 --> 2:22:59.560]  in the supreme court you've been talking about the states the other audits i'm just saying in
[2:22:59.560 --> 2:23:03.720]  general we got to keep fighting because we know that was fraud all over the place for the midterms
[2:23:03.720 --> 2:23:09.800]  coming up so regardless so trump can run again if need be or or whoever because we don't fix this
[2:23:09.800 --> 2:23:14.840]  and now 20 plus states have passed laws to stop a lot of the fraud this time and so one way or
[2:23:14.840 --> 2:23:18.760]  another the media is trying to act like if we don't reinstate trump by the end of august we're
[2:23:18.760 --> 2:23:25.000]  liars or we're losers no we're battling them they're scared this attorney general is trying to shut
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:29.320]  down the states investigating what are they scared of i'm just saying i don't like putting dates on
[2:23:29.320 --> 2:23:35.160]  things and no one is hard charging like you not even president trump and we appreciate him coming
[2:23:35.160 --> 2:23:39.560]  out saying little the election was stolen these are communists these are bad you know i should be
[2:23:39.560 --> 2:23:44.520]  reinstated that's great i'm just simply saying we're gonna fight this war like george washington
[2:23:44.520 --> 2:23:48.920]  and persevere and you're out there leading it right well what i'm saying is this how you know
[2:23:48.920 --> 2:23:54.440]  you say all these states are passing laws here's the bottom line everybody if these machines aren't
[2:23:54.440 --> 2:24:01.400]  gone there is no 2022 um you know here garbage like this this is from brian camp i got in the mail
[2:24:01.400 --> 2:24:06.600]  today uh from brian camp the governor george and you know how corrupt he is oh yeah urgent urgent
[2:24:06.600 --> 2:24:12.040]  urgent election integrity is under attack and then he wanted money for me you know he wanted money
[2:24:12.040 --> 2:24:18.360]  for me remember brian camp bought 107 million dollars with the dominion machines in 2019 on
[2:24:18.360 --> 2:24:24.280]  taxpayers money if the machines aren't gone which they will be and we have a at their symposium we're
[2:24:24.280 --> 2:24:31.480]  gonna also unveil a whole new way to do elections and it's uh and but we're gonna give the technology
[2:24:31.480 --> 2:24:36.520]  out we're just gonna give it away because we want without this has to change alex i got a good plan
[2:24:36.520 --> 2:24:42.840]  for the machines we melt them all down into prison bars and the ones that helped that china do this
[2:24:42.840 --> 2:24:47.800]  we have a good place you're good you're good use for them and this is and this is serious everybody
[2:24:47.800 --> 2:24:54.040]  you can have all the election things and talk about all that you want it's done unless we that's why
[2:24:54.040 --> 2:25:00.840]  it's so important this was a cyber attack by china and this was and period sure you had all these
[2:25:00.840 --> 2:25:04.760]  you know let me tell i'm gonna say something real quick about you know when we talk about you hear
[2:25:04.760 --> 2:25:10.760]  stories like 20 some thousand people in georgia were non-residents have voted or 20 some thousand
[2:25:10.760 --> 2:25:17.240]  in nevada that's not true everybody these people people are generally there's good people 20 some
[2:25:17.240 --> 2:25:23.480]  thousand people didn't go vote that were non-residents they used the 2010 voter rolls and it was done
[2:25:23.480 --> 2:25:28.200]  they needed to use names so they hack in and use them names that's where you have dead people that
[2:25:28.200 --> 2:25:33.000]  voted oh exactly the democrats are on record creating a list of people that have moved out of state
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:39.320]  to then steal their identity basically now this was an attack they used the 2010 voter rolls
[2:25:39.320 --> 2:25:44.360]  that's what i'm saying is they steal their voter roll name and use it yeah right but this was done
[2:25:44.360 --> 2:25:50.200]  by this time this the tax came out of china now what what what part of the democrat party they used
[2:25:50.200 --> 2:25:55.320]  or if they use some of the republican party we'll we're gonna show you all that what what actually
[2:25:55.320 --> 2:26:00.120]  happened and how they use those voter rolls you had to pull things for that's why alex you have a
[2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:05.640]  lot of states where in the rural areas you had you had more people voted they live in the county
[2:26:05.640 --> 2:26:10.760]  that's because a lot of them died or they moved out of that county since 2010 we're gonna show this
[2:26:10.760 --> 2:26:15.720]  and this isn't even up this is gonna be by dr franken that where you can do it in your own county
[2:26:15.720 --> 2:26:21.720]  the mathematics and uh you'll see exactly it was you this is what they used to set that algorithm
[2:26:21.720 --> 2:26:26.520]  and it's very and then you hear see what you're showing here they had to cover it in order to cover
[2:26:26.520 --> 2:26:31.000]  up this because donald trump was going to win anyway then you had these things in the middle
[2:26:31.000 --> 2:26:36.520]  of the night like uh like in uh michigan a hundred thousand votes went for bite well you had to bring
[2:26:36.520 --> 2:26:40.920]  in you had to bring in votes bring in ballots and then what's going well you know what those
[2:26:40.920 --> 2:26:46.520]  those democrats everybody votes democrat and then those mail-in votes the mail-in votes were counted
[2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:51.160]  on the morning of the third not in the middle of the night on the fourth so we're gonna take a lot
[2:26:51.160 --> 2:26:57.400]  of these lies out of the picture and we're gonna make it all make sense everybody i believe you

[2:31:07.640 --> 2:31:11.880]  with all the terrible things that are unfolding i want you to know that a lot of positive things
[2:31:11.880 --> 2:31:17.160]  are happening as well i'm a public figure so i get to see things the general public doesn't get
[2:31:17.160 --> 2:31:22.600]  to see and let me tell you whether it's police chiefs or members of congress or even folks in
[2:31:22.600 --> 2:31:29.080]  hollywood or or or mainstream media or industry people are really really awake in the establishment
[2:31:29.080 --> 2:31:34.520]  they don't want to go on with the globalist but they're scared they're looking for leadership

[2:31:39.480 --> 2:31:44.680]  products at the same time we will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular
[2:31:44.680 --> 2:31:49.560]  but the globalist will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to
[2:31:49.560 --> 2:31:56.200]  take the heat that's our job so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire so we can be
[2:31:56.200 --> 2:32:03.080]  the shock groups of the information war fund us at m4store.com it is through our five senses that
[2:32:03.080 --> 2:32:08.760]  we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and the only way to see through this
[2:32:08.760 --> 2:32:15.400]  illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated water is a big problem consuming too
[2:32:15.400 --> 2:32:21.640]  much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions
[2:32:21.640 --> 2:32:26.520]  natural functions which have been known for millennia the hindu chakras align with the
[2:32:26.520 --> 2:32:32.360]  endocrine system the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye also described as
[2:32:32.360 --> 2:32:37.880]  the seat of the soul the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness
[2:32:37.880 --> 2:32:44.040]  and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality fluoride free water is essential to keeping
[2:32:44.040 --> 2:32:50.360]  our pineal gland healthy our water filtration systems with the proper filters will keep your
[2:32:50.360 --> 2:32:56.600]  drinking water fluoride free and the proprio showerhead will seal the deal get them both today for
[2:32:56.600 --> 2:33:05.480]  yourself or a friend at infowarstore.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:33:05.480 --> 2:33:22.760]  we are back live michael indell is swinging for the fences fighting hard for america
[2:33:23.640 --> 2:33:29.000]  a true americana a businessman a patriot taking action and that break man i wish you could hear
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:33.080]  during the break what he was saying even more powerfully saying on air try to recap that the
[2:33:33.080 --> 2:33:36.920]  few minutes you've got left where you jump on that jet and fly down to texas to be with us here
[2:33:36.920 --> 2:33:42.520]  tonight uh there up in cisco but recapping behind the scenes two and a half hours boiled down to
[2:33:42.520 --> 2:33:48.840]  eight minutes on anderson cooper and then you were getting into the lawyers are going to have
[2:33:48.840 --> 2:33:53.800]  the symposium the battle plan that's all going to be announced there and when that's coming up and
[2:33:53.800 --> 2:33:58.440]  then again finish plugging because that's very intriguing getting all these marketplaces together
[2:33:58.440 --> 2:34:02.840]  at frankspeech.com and getting all these other entrepreneurs and companies that you've vetted
[2:34:02.840 --> 2:34:07.320]  and are great listed there so we can all start supporting each other and bring back america
[2:34:07.320 --> 2:34:11.560]  because that's really the revolution of past voting or past free speech that's all very important

[2:35:30.520 --> 2:35:35.800]  and a half hours everybody they got this lady behind me going ask him this attack him here attack
[2:35:35.800 --> 2:35:41.000]  him here we went back and forth and i you know i've battled those people and all these guys
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:46.520]  for since november 4th every day especially after i got all the evidence on january 9th
[2:35:46.520 --> 2:35:50.920]  now we went back and forth they couldn't get anything out of the best they could do is eight
[2:35:50.920 --> 2:35:58.280]  minutes on anerson cooper eight minutes worth and uh and the guy's trying to just credit me and i'm
[2:35:58.280 --> 2:36:04.280]  going you guys i put up a five million dollar price why don't you cnn bring your cyber guy to
[2:36:04.280 --> 2:36:09.480]  the symposium and make five million dollars i mean it doesn't hold water when a guy puts up five
[2:36:09.480 --> 2:36:14.040]  million and i've already put up probably 12 million dollars i've spent to my own money
[2:36:14.040 --> 2:36:18.920]  get to investigate and get hiring white hat hackers doing everything i can for the last
[2:36:18.920 --> 2:36:24.040]  six months to get this ready for the cyber symposium you guys one of the things on the
[2:36:24.040 --> 2:36:29.720]  first day my head lawyer he's gonna do he's gonna talk about our pathway after the symposium
[2:36:29.720 --> 2:36:34.360]  and we're gonna be it's called a quo warrant oh we're gonna bring it all to the supreme court
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:39.160]  all the states will be the plaintiffs and when it gets there they're gonna vote nine zero i've
[2:36:39.160 --> 2:36:44.120]  been saying this for five months because this is non-subjective evidence to everybody that you're
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:49.960]  all gonna see and that was the supreme court will never do that yes they will because you know what
[2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:54.440]  they're americans and they they grew up the american dream they have families they have
[2:36:54.440 --> 2:37:00.280]  children grandchildren neighbors friends family and this was an attack by china on our election
[2:37:00.920 --> 2:37:06.040]  they and and the democrats warned us about this attack they warned us kamala heros aiming
[2:37:06.040 --> 2:37:11.480]  klobuchar they warned us but you know they didn't capture these packets like these heroes did
[2:37:11.480 --> 2:37:17.480]  but the again at the the supreme court then is going to pull this down and it's going to be
[2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:21.400]  nine nothing because it can't be like seven to two because you can't argue with what we're
[2:37:21.400 --> 2:37:27.240]  going to show on the 10th 11th and 12th it's unchangeable irrefutable non-subjective so when
[2:37:27.240 --> 2:37:31.640]  they do that they're gonna now they're going to be a lot of options and it says well mike will
[2:37:31.640 --> 2:37:37.480]  they put donald trump in right away well they should because there's precedence every elected
[2:37:37.480 --> 2:37:44.440]  official in united states history where they found out that a crime was committed ie election fraud
[2:37:44.440 --> 2:37:49.560]  and they say hey because of this the other guy really won they put the other guy back in there's
[2:37:49.560 --> 2:37:54.440]  no statute limitations and it doesn't matter if there's a month left for that guy to serve or
[2:37:54.440 --> 2:37:59.480]  that gal they put him back in immediately now this never happened at the presidential level
[2:37:59.480 --> 2:38:05.880]  and also you know we had down tickets in this election were affected too all across the board
[2:38:05.880 --> 2:38:10.200]  so i don't know maybe the supreme court there the supreme court maybe they say hey we need to
[2:38:10.200 --> 2:38:15.240]  have a new election and get rid of these machines and have a whole new election and mike let me say
[2:38:15.240 --> 2:38:20.840]  this let me say this they did steal the election it is a fraud biden's telling people he had his
[2:38:20.840 --> 2:38:26.040]  butt wiped on tv he doesn't know what planet he's on all this evil's coming out i i agree they're
[2:38:26.040 --> 2:38:30.120]  gonna have to replace biden regardless so we are going into the waters where the supreme court
[2:38:30.120 --> 2:38:33.960]  if there's enough public pressure in a court of public opinion and the evidence is out there
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:38.680]  because the supreme court are our political and they're also scared they're being blackmailed by
[2:38:38.680 --> 2:38:43.160]  cnn and threatened and if they see momentum they would do the right thing i agree with you but
[2:38:43.160 --> 2:38:48.600]  regardless we're exposing the machines and we're fighting to change that and so that's why regardless
[2:38:48.600 --> 2:38:52.360]  of what you're doing you're winning brother you're the man in the arena that teddy roosevelt talked
[2:38:52.360 --> 2:38:57.880]  about that's all i'm saying is i i appreciate a man that puts everything on one number i'm just
[2:38:57.880 --> 2:39:02.440]  saying brother what you're doing is wonderful and regardless of what happens in the next few months
[2:39:02.440 --> 2:39:06.760]  we're moving in the right direction that's all i'm saying oh absolutely and you know you bring up a
[2:39:06.760 --> 2:39:10.600]  point there everyone says well the supreme court one of them's compromised they're always saying
[2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:15.400]  there's three liberals and all this stuff well let me tell you back when they voted seven to two not
[2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:19.240]  to look at it number one they didn't have this evidence but let me tell you something else if
[2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:24.840]  you back then if i was a democrat and i'm not talking about the party but if i was a democrat
[2:39:24.840 --> 2:39:30.680]  i would go wow those those lawyers that i mean those justices that donald trump would in they're
[2:39:30.680 --> 2:39:36.760]  fair because these guys really thought they won then but now they over 30 of democrats don't believe
[2:39:36.760 --> 2:39:42.920]  it was an attack and that they didn't win a check a cyber attack and over 90 of republicans so this
[2:39:42.920 --> 2:39:48.840]  time the evidence that i'm going to put out there that you're going to see on the 10th 11th and 12th
[2:39:48.840 --> 2:39:54.520]  it gives them it makes the supreme court they will be off the hook they can look over and say hey
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:40:01.560]  i can't say this isn't what it is because with this evidence it is what it is it's non-subjective
[2:40:01.560 --> 2:40:06.360]  that's what the beauty of it and that's why everybody needs to tune in what you said there alex
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:12.360]  about having pressure that's why we want a billion people to watch this and i mean that we're gonna
[2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:17.400]  have people from other countries speaking that and too because they're worried about this 2020
[2:40:17.400 --> 2:40:23.400]  election and getting rid of these machines we if we get enough people to watch but i'm talking a
[2:40:23.400 --> 2:40:27.640]  billion if everybody watches there's no argument about what's going on fold there and by the way
[2:40:27.640 --> 2:40:32.040]  let me stop you because because i'm not trying to take my horn but the reason all the democrats
[2:40:32.040 --> 2:40:40.360]  sued me came after me in 2016 we had 87 million different ip addresses on our streams in a five
[2:40:40.360 --> 2:40:46.440]  day period of the election alone not to mention our affiliates and then and then youtube and google
[2:40:46.440 --> 2:40:53.160]  we had we had a half a billion views that week and so absolutely if people get excited if they take
[2:40:53.160 --> 2:40:58.120]  action if i had in my whole history on youtube seven eight million views and then i got half a
[2:40:58.120 --> 2:41:03.480]  billion in in in in less than a week just i mean that that happened this can happen on our own
[2:41:03.480 --> 2:41:07.800]  platforms as long as we're willing to pay for the bandwidth which is what i know brother what
[2:41:07.800 --> 2:41:12.680]  it's costing you because i know frank speech has taken off on average 200 000 viewers at any time

[2:43:49.560 --> 2:43:54.200]  just number one for a few hours it only works it's not a joke yeah absolutely
[2:44:00.040 --> 2:44:05.960]  there's one central fact of criminal psychology the criminologists all agree on
[2:44:06.760 --> 2:44:11.640]  and that it's criminals aren't extremely pathological even more the general public they
[2:44:11.640 --> 2:44:17.160]  do the same things over and over again and criminals like to commit the same types of crimes
[2:44:17.160 --> 2:44:24.360]  over and over again well guess what it was anthony foushee and eugenicist's globalist that
[2:44:25.400 --> 2:44:30.600]  ran the rollout of hiv and the mistreatment of it with azt and other chemicals that actually killed
[2:44:30.600 --> 2:44:36.440]  more people than hiv and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would
[2:44:36.440 --> 2:44:41.800]  actually go attack the t-lint besides the body and create autoimmune disorders the problem for them
[2:44:41.800 --> 2:44:48.200]  was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road that's why they need
[2:44:48.200 --> 2:44:52.520]  to roll out the covet nineteen and the vaccine because now they admit the covet nineteen vaccine
[2:44:52.520 --> 2:44:57.800]  destroys your immune system basically giving you the equivalent of hiv that's right ladies and gentlemen
[2:45:00.200 --> 2:45:05.000]  i preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're super computers controlled
[2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:09.880]  by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go what we do but because they have great cameras
[2:45:09.880 --> 2:45:15.000]  and great recording systems and great ways to communicate i still have one because this trojan
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:20.280]  horse this permethean fire has a lot of power but when i'm not using it i lock it up in a high quality

[2:48:03.320 --> 2:48:07.320]  the shot that's now in the national statistics international statistics and i said but it's
[2:48:07.320 --> 2:48:12.040]  also hitting a lot of good people and i know when there's a real plague going on you don't see it on
[2:48:12.040 --> 2:48:17.880]  the news i had my uncle and uh my cousin and my dad's uh older cousin that was like his uncle
[2:48:18.440 --> 2:48:26.520]  all die in a month um of pneumonia seven years ago in 2014 so i know how real it is they all
[2:48:26.520 --> 2:48:34.520]  died the month of january and um i mean i can just tell you that this is very very serious
[2:48:35.880 --> 2:48:39.800]  and i have family that didn't listen to me and took the vaccine and got very very sick
[2:48:40.840 --> 2:48:45.960]  and i also have other people that i consider family that are in bad trouble right now
[2:48:45.960 --> 2:48:50.200]  and so i just want you to know this is not just me i tell you i don't just go off intelligence
[2:48:50.200 --> 2:48:55.720]  certain mainstream news i go off the ground i'm very observant and this is real bad this is real

[2:49:19.080 --> 2:49:25.240]  i pray privately but i just pray to god that the chains of these evil people be broken but
[2:49:25.240 --> 2:49:32.040]  if that's going to be done we first have to repent for the fact that we have killed 65 million innocent
[2:49:32.040 --> 2:49:39.960]  babies in this country and treated them like crap and treated them like they were lower than a worm
[2:49:39.960 --> 2:49:45.960]  you'd pull out of some packet of dirt and put on a hook i mean i feel bad for a worm when i'm sticking
[2:49:45.960 --> 2:49:51.560]  it on end of a hook but i know i'm going to catch fish on it so i do it my need to hunt and my need
[2:49:51.560 --> 2:49:56.280]  to catch a fish it gets me past the point of i feel bad sticking a worm on the end of that hook
[2:49:56.280 --> 2:50:02.600]  while it's alive but the fish bite on that they don't bite on a rubber worm that's where my conscience
[2:50:02.600 --> 2:50:09.560]  is at i think about Fauci for no reason other than evil just to have six scientists and it's a cult
[2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:15.640]  to like implant baby dogs puppies with worms that eat their bodies i mean and i know you're a new
[2:50:15.640 --> 2:50:19.400]  listener you hear that you think this is crazy he's making it up i get you think i'm making it up
[2:50:19.400 --> 2:50:23.880]  i'm not making any of it up they have sex with the babies that they partial birth abort before
[2:50:23.880 --> 2:50:30.120]  they kill them i mean it's come out in court cases i mean i'm not making any of this up
[2:50:31.240 --> 2:50:36.760]  i'm not making any of it up and i you know wish to god it wasn't true and i wish to god every day
[2:50:36.760 --> 2:50:42.200]  that we were under attack by these people but um i don't need to read the news or even call up a
[2:50:42.200 --> 2:50:48.440]  local medical facility to find out they're full of people right now i already see it and uh people
[2:50:48.440 --> 2:50:52.280]  better get right with god and you better get healthy and i'm telling myself that and you better get
[2:50:52.280 --> 2:50:57.240]  your body juiced up with all the natural things god's giving us because man when you look at the
[2:50:57.240 --> 2:51:01.960]  scum and you look at the trash and you look at steve jobs ex-wife and you look at gelena matchwell
[2:51:01.960 --> 2:51:07.960]  and you look at all these guys to them it's all about what they're doing to us and how they have
[2:51:07.960 --> 2:51:15.240]  this power over us they enjoy that power just like ed buck liked to lure homeless black men into his
[2:51:15.240 --> 2:51:21.240]  house and drug them up and then kill them and he'd look he'd hang over on the few that you know the
[2:51:21.240 --> 2:51:27.320]  ones that survived and say i'm sucking your soul you're all alone now god can't help you with a huge
[2:51:27.320 --> 2:51:34.200]  red skull poster on the ceiling the whole ceiling was this giant skull with red light behind it with
[2:51:34.200 --> 2:51:40.200]  this demon saying i'm sucking your energy i'm gonna get you that's them that's joe biden that's bill
[2:51:40.200 --> 2:51:46.840]  gauge him that spirit that's the enemy right there and why we sit there and let them be the authority
[2:51:46.840 --> 2:51:55.640]  over us and do this to us i will never figure out but joe biden is ed buck and some like to
[2:51:57.080 --> 2:52:01.800]  i haven't figured it all out i've just studied them and you know and i'm not giving saying women don't
[2:52:01.800 --> 2:52:11.000]  get attacked but i've studied these satanists women are not even what they're into because women
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  procreate are powerful on this engine of life they just want to dumb them down and control them
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:21.640]  they want little boys they want men they want to screw men over and they like to get little boys
[2:52:21.640 --> 2:52:27.400]  they can hurt and abuse and they like to get strong men they can have power over and dominate and
[2:52:27.400 --> 2:52:32.680]  break and that's what these guys are into and so what better than a big strong black man that they
[2:52:32.680 --> 2:52:37.960]  can do that too it's it's it's disgusting it's pathetic it's satanic but really it's of their
[2:52:37.960 --> 2:52:43.480]  father the devil because what does satan want he wants to get god's creation and screw with it
[2:52:43.480 --> 2:52:48.600]  and dominate it so satan can feel powerful and the minute you wake up to the fact that these people
[2:52:48.600 --> 2:52:55.960]  are devil worshipers is the minute we can start beating them it's just that simple they are the
[2:52:55.960 --> 2:52:59.720]  scum of the earth and these little girls have come public and they get shut down in the news
[2:52:59.720 --> 2:53:04.680]  people sued biden over they get shut down by the corrupt courts and joe biden pinches their ass
[2:53:07.560 --> 2:53:11.560]  you see the dads grab their daughters away when he does it he pinches little girls on the butt
[2:53:11.560 --> 2:53:14.120]  and then tells them you're making me really horny right now
[2:53:17.400 --> 2:53:23.080]  and see he gets off on the little girl's first sexual experience is a demonic pedophile leaning
[2:53:23.080 --> 2:53:29.800]  over him and then his son is in photos with the niece naked after they've had sex smoking crack
[2:53:29.800 --> 2:53:40.360]  with 12 year old that's just the beginning and now they want a relationship with your children
[2:53:40.360 --> 2:53:53.720]  and now they want to put a gmo system made out of cloned cells of a dead white kid from 1966
[2:53:53.720 --> 2:54:01.480]  and a dead black lady from 1951 and then a jellyfish gene genome and you say what's that for
[2:54:01.480 --> 2:54:06.440]  at least go you don't worry about that but it's because they know those cells never die and keep
[2:54:06.440 --> 2:54:13.160]  replicating the jellyfish is a hive organism it's a composite organism it the jellyfish is not one
[2:54:13.160 --> 2:54:22.360]  creature a jellyfish is a is a uh hive is the wrong term it is a uh wow what's the term
[2:54:23.640 --> 2:54:27.560]  just come to me in a minute it's like a hive but it's not it's a uh
[2:54:31.160 --> 2:54:35.000]  it doesn't matter you look it up for yourself it's all a bunch of cells that work in unison
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:40.600]  together but it's not one group it's a colony organism it's a colony organism they're injecting
[2:54:41.240 --> 2:54:48.520]  a colony organisms genome with this white kid and his black woman's genes that never die
[2:54:49.160 --> 2:54:52.680]  which means they just keep replicating and you will whatever these cells are mixed with makes them
[2:54:52.680 --> 2:55:01.800]  powerful and they are putting that into you god knows what they've done i mean we're like hey the
[2:55:01.800 --> 2:55:07.400]  study show it gives you cancer and eats your body alive and causes blood clots that's just a side
[2:55:07.400 --> 2:55:14.600]  effect it does something far more evil makes you magnetic takes over your body we're going to talk
[2:55:14.600 --> 2:55:18.360]  about the documents the science of it i've already taped an hour and a half long interview with David
[2:55:18.360 --> 2:55:22.280]  eich that was the best ever i've got a bunch of other huge guests i'm interviewing today i'll be
[2:55:22.280 --> 2:55:26.200]  here till six seven to nine interviewing them we're going to air it five o'clock tomorrow
[2:55:26.200 --> 2:55:32.600]  five o'clock tomorrow it will stream out and it will also be posted to band up video it's
[2:55:32.600 --> 2:55:40.280]  probably going to be four hour long with just a few breaks in it and look for that tomorrow and
[2:55:40.280 --> 2:55:44.920]  i don't know how long we'll be here but every day i can work i'm going to be here i mean you think i
[2:55:44.920 --> 2:55:48.920]  want to go on airplane and go to sue fall south dakota and be there would be a mob of people
[2:55:48.920 --> 2:55:54.280]  three days but i've got to go to that's too important um i mean i know you'd rather not be
[2:55:54.280 --> 2:55:57.400]  tuned into this hearing that you'd rather be out fishing or out doing something normal right i get
[2:55:57.400 --> 2:56:02.200]  it believe me they're not going to leave us alone folks we can't hide from this all right and i can't
[2:56:02.200 --> 2:56:07.560]  hold back and hope they don't destroy me just no i gotta just full on go 110 percent
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  was the best advice i ever got by football coach on the eighth grade said alex you do some great
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:17.320]  plays you're really strong you do good because but notice when you get hurt when you don't go 100
[2:56:17.320 --> 2:56:23.240]  percent every time yeah and i learned like you better go 100 every time or you're going to lose
[2:56:23.240 --> 2:56:27.800]  you're going to get hurt but it's when you go 100 percent it's almost like you can't get hurt but
[2:56:27.800 --> 2:56:31.720]  if i do that's the way it is because i'm not going to be signed up with you pedophiles and you
[2:56:31.720 --> 2:56:35.800]  devil worshipers that pull a baby out of a woman and take it in the back room and rape it because
[2:56:35.800 --> 2:56:40.600]  it's the most twisted thing you can think of or you cut its scalp off and put it on a rat or you
[2:56:40.600 --> 2:56:47.080]  inject puppy dogs with maggots so we gotta i know these people are scary folks but they got to be
[2:56:47.080 --> 2:56:52.680]  faced we got to expose them and my job is to laze them my job is to light them up with the spotlight
[2:56:52.680 --> 2:56:58.120]  for you politically so that we can culturally say no to them and resist them and so when you
[2:56:58.120 --> 2:57:03.160]  magnify what we do here you are literally turning up the spotlight on the cockroaches that uh
[2:57:05.160 --> 2:57:12.280]  teduja talks about so much so we've got uh harrison smith coming in here on the other side
[2:57:12.280 --> 2:57:17.800]  today and i really really appreciate harrison smith and all the great work he does and then we've
[2:57:17.800 --> 2:57:22.440]  got the war room coming up oh and sure had a really well-deserved week obviously his family in st louis

[2:57:41.800 --> 2:57:50.360]  part of the transmission coming up harrison smith it's hard to believe we're already halfway into
[2:57:50.360 --> 2:57:55.640]  this insane year of 2021 we're seeing world government world ideas being announced forced
[2:57:55.640 --> 2:58:01.240]  inoculations all the tyranny we warned of is now here but on the good side there is also a global
[2:58:01.240 --> 2:58:06.840]  awakening the lives of which this planet has never seen so truly the battle between good and evil is
[2:58:06.840 --> 2:58:10.760]  now front and center that's why i want to thank all the viewers all the listeners for your support
[2:58:10.760 --> 2:58:15.240]  for your word of mouth for your prayers over the years because without info wars we'd be in a lot

[3:00:53.000 --> 3:01:00.600]  i was sort of uh inspired by a headline on info wars dot com uh music in terms that i've used
[3:01:00.600 --> 3:01:06.920]  quite a bit actually recently neo feudalism neo feudalism as we know the so-called great reset
[3:01:06.920 --> 3:01:13.400]  being promoted by everybody from the un to the royal family to joe biden to claus schwaab you know
[3:01:13.960 --> 3:01:17.800]  what it is but do you know what it really is what it really is is the great
[3:01:17.800 --> 3:01:24.200]  merger the great combining of the most powerful forces in our entire world coming together in one
[3:01:24.200 --> 3:01:31.480]  singular monolithic control mechanism in order to well destroy human liberty worldwide and install
[3:01:31.480 --> 3:01:39.800]  themselves as the ruling elite over a planet of serfs and so what i've done is uh compiled this
[3:01:39.800 --> 3:01:46.920]  giant stack of stories while i was watching the alex joneshow and this is a stack of what i like
[3:01:46.920 --> 3:01:52.760]  to call your new dystopia where i'm laying out exactly what the world will look like if these
[3:01:52.760 --> 3:01:58.920]  people get their way and trust me it's not pretty it's not pretty at all actually it's
[3:01:58.920 --> 3:02:06.600]  quite horrific rather horrific so we're going to be taking a look at what facebook and amazon

[3:06:07.560 --> 3:06:16.320]  tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. Welcome ladies
[3:06:16.320 --> 3:06:20.520]  and gentlemen to the Alex Jones Show. My name is Harrison Smith. Excuse me while I pinch
[3:06:20.520 --> 3:06:28.280]  myself since I still have a hard time believing that I actually work at Infowars. My God,
[3:06:28.280 --> 3:06:33.360]  I've been a fan for Infowars since I was probably 12 or 13 years old. And here to be hosting
[3:06:33.360 --> 3:06:39.880]  the Alex Jones Show, I can tell you as a honor beyond my meager comprehension. So I'll do
[3:06:39.880 --> 3:06:46.040]  my best to live up to this incredible platform that the Infowars out there have been kind
[3:06:46.040 --> 3:06:52.000]  enough to give to me. So I'd like to talk about what our coming dystopia will look like
[3:06:52.000 --> 3:06:56.880]  when the big tech companies have their way and have total control of every system of
[3:06:56.880 --> 3:07:00.360]  our lives. But first I want to talk about how we're going to get there. And I'll show
[3:07:00.360 --> 3:07:05.480]  you a couple of videos. One you may have seen if you've been watching Infowars the past
[3:07:05.480 --> 3:07:09.200]  six months ago. We've played it a few times. It's the Milgram experiment, but I'm going
[3:07:09.200 --> 3:07:13.160]  to show you another experiment, the video of which has been going around on Twitter
[3:07:13.160 --> 3:07:19.080]  today called the Ash experiment. These experiments highlight very important aspects of human
[3:07:19.080 --> 3:07:25.400]  psychology that are now at work worldwide through the human population and being exploited,
[3:07:25.400 --> 3:07:31.600]  utilized, and really maximized in order to bring about total subjugation willingly in
[3:07:31.600 --> 3:07:36.160]  the American people or in really the people of Earth, everybody worldwide because this
[3:07:36.160 --> 3:07:42.800]  is not just an American problem. So let's begin first with the Milgram experiment. Again,
[3:07:42.800 --> 3:07:47.000]  you've probably heard of it. You probably know it. The Ash experiment may be new to
[3:07:47.000 --> 3:07:51.400]  you and it'll really shock you. But let's refresh our memories, shall we, with this
[3:07:51.400 --> 3:07:58.120]  classic experiment from 1963, the Milgram experiment showing just how easy it is to get people
[3:07:58.120 --> 3:08:04.360]  to do things they never would have done before. Really brutal things up to and including murder
[3:08:04.360 --> 3:08:10.520]  as long as a scientist says so. Trust the science. It's a doctor. He's wearing a white
[3:08:10.520 --> 3:08:16.000]  coat. Do what he says. Kill your friend. And they do. It's absolutely incredible, but it
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:26.640]  is simple psychology that can be and has been exploited all over the world. Not just in
[3:08:26.640 --> 3:08:33.120]  singular individuals, but even easier to do on a wider population. So here it is. Enjoy
[3:08:33.120 --> 3:08:43.280]  it if you can. Milgram experiment 1963. A decade earlier, psychologist Stanley Milgram
[3:08:43.280 --> 3:08:50.040]  had also looked at how we respond to authority. In order to understand how people were induced
[3:08:50.040 --> 3:08:56.000]  to obey unjust regimes and participate in atrocities such as the Holocaust, he set up
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:09:01.680]  an experiment. Volunteers were told they were taking part in scientific research to improve
[3:09:01.680 --> 3:09:10.600]  memory. Would you open those and tell me which of you is which, please? Teacher. Separated
[3:09:10.600 --> 3:09:16.320]  by a screen, the teacher would ask the learner questions in a word game and administer an
[3:09:16.320 --> 3:09:21.360]  electric shock when the answer was incorrect. He was told to increase the voltage with each
[3:09:21.360 --> 3:09:39.120]  wrong answer. Cloud. Horse. Rock. House. Answer. Wrong. 150 volts. Answer. Horse. Experiment.
[3:09:39.120 --> 3:09:43.640]  That's all. Get me out of here. Get me out of here, please. Continue, please. We're
[3:09:43.640 --> 3:09:50.560]  right out of time. The experiment requires you continue, teacher. Please continue. Participants
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:55.840]  didn't know that the learner was really an actor and the so-called shocks harmless. You
[3:09:55.840 --> 3:10:07.440]  are going to get a shock 180 volts. I can't stand it. I'm not going to kill that man today.
[3:10:07.440 --> 3:10:10.760]  I mean, who's going to take the responsibility if anything happens to that gentleman? I'm
[3:10:10.760 --> 3:10:16.880]  responsible for anything that happens here. Continue, please. All right, next one. Slow.
[3:10:16.880 --> 3:10:23.960]  Up. Dance. Truck. Music. Two-thirds of volunteers were prepared to administer a potentially fatal
[3:10:23.960 --> 3:10:29.040]  electric shock when encouraged to do so by what they perceived as a legitimate authority
[3:10:29.040 --> 3:10:36.760]  figure. In this case, a man in a white coat. 375 volts. I think something's happened to
[3:10:36.760 --> 3:10:41.360]  that fellow in there. I don't get no answer. He was hollering on a less voltage. Can't
[3:10:41.360 --> 3:10:46.760]  you check in and see if he's all right, please? Milgram's findings horrified America. They
[3:10:46.760 --> 3:10:50.680]  showed that decent American citizens were as capable of committing acts against their
[3:10:50.680 --> 3:10:59.640]  conscience as the Germans had been under the Nazis. There it is, the Milgram experiment.
[3:10:59.640 --> 3:11:04.080]  A couple of important things to notice from this experiment that, once again, simply illustrates
[3:11:04.080 --> 3:11:12.920]  a fundamental aspect of human psychology, which is that you can sort of offset your own guilt
[3:11:12.920 --> 3:11:18.040]  on somebody else if you think you are just doing something on behalf of a larger organization
[3:11:18.040 --> 3:11:21.080]  or, you know, it's not really your fault that you're the one doing the thing that you're
[3:11:21.080 --> 3:11:28.640]  doing. Again, basic human psychology that the elites know about and exploit and utilize
[3:11:28.640 --> 3:11:33.520]  to enslave us. But a few things to note about that. First of all, what the experiment is
[3:11:33.520 --> 3:11:39.000]  that they told they were engaged in was to improve memory. Okay, now you can kind of
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:43.780]  justify this if it's like, well, here you got to question this guy to get information
[3:11:43.780 --> 3:11:47.240]  about an upcoming terrorist attack. You're saving lives here, so you got to hurt this
[3:11:47.240 --> 3:11:51.600]  guy. Then maybe you can justify it in your head. There's something to justify this action.
[3:11:51.600 --> 3:11:56.640]  It's an experiment to improve memory, right? It's a simple test, no stakes, nothing that
[3:11:56.640 --> 3:12:00.800]  would justify this level of literal physical torture these people think that they're actually
[3:12:00.800 --> 3:12:05.480]  engaged in. And that shows you just how low the stakes have to be for people to be engaged
[3:12:05.480 --> 3:12:10.960]  in this. Just memory experiment. There's no reason to be hurting anybody over a memory
[3:12:10.960 --> 3:12:14.280]  experiment. These people will not just hurt people, they'll have people crying out in
[3:12:14.280 --> 3:12:19.240]  pain and then thinking that they're dead and still delivering the jolts. Two-thirds, two-thirds
[3:12:19.240 --> 3:12:24.560]  of people participated in this and refused to stop the test. Truly incredible. But the
[3:12:24.560 --> 3:12:29.120]  real most important line in that entire video is the line that the doctor says. He says,
[3:12:29.120 --> 3:12:34.000]  I'm responsible for anything that happens here. And that's it. And that's all it takes.
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:40.360]  And you can look at everything from the FBI, to the Army, to scientists and doctors. When
[3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:44.680]  you give people incredible amounts of power, like say you give people the ability to press
[3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:51.280]  a button and send an electric shock to somebody that they can't even see. There's something
[3:12:51.280 --> 3:12:56.400]  in us that sort of rebels at having that power. It's a lot of responsibility to have a lot
[3:12:56.400 --> 3:13:00.760]  of power. To be an FBI agent, I mean, imagine, just picture for yourself what it would be
[3:13:00.760 --> 3:13:06.680]  like to be able to walk up to any police officer, walk in the beat or in his car, and to hold
[3:13:06.680 --> 3:13:10.560]  up your wallet and go, I'm in charge here and have the cop say, yes, sir, and walk away.
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:14.560]  You know, like FBI agents could do whatever they want, right? That's a lot of power to
[3:13:14.560 --> 3:13:18.360]  have. Psychologically, you either got to be an insane narcissist to handle that much
[3:13:18.360 --> 3:13:24.240]  power that you've been given or you have to offload that responsibility onto your superiors.
[3:13:24.240 --> 3:13:28.360]  So yes, I do have ultimate power. If I'm an FBI agent in America, I can do basically whatever
[3:13:28.360 --> 3:13:33.280]  I want, but it's okay and I can handle it psychologically because I'm just doing what
[3:13:33.280 --> 3:13:38.560]  I'm told. I'm just following orders. It's not actually me. I'm just a vessel for the
[3:13:38.560 --> 3:13:42.880]  orders from the people above me. It's their fault if I do anything wrong. That is the
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:48.040]  psychological mechanism that's at work here. But let's look at another very important scientific
[3:13:48.040 --> 3:13:54.000]  study. This one is called the ASH experiment. It took place in Britain and has to do more
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:59.600]  with group conformity. I don't even think this needs an intro. Just watch this and come
[3:13:59.600 --> 3:14:04.520]  to your own conclusions. Here it is.
[3:14:04.520 --> 3:14:10.040]  The ASH experiment is one of psychology's oldest and most popular pieces of research.
[3:14:10.040 --> 3:14:16.040]  A volunteer is told that he's taking part in a visual perception test. What he doesn't
[3:14:16.040 --> 3:14:20.680]  know is that the other participants are actors and he's the only person taking part in the
[3:14:20.680 --> 3:14:25.960]  real test, which is actually about group conformity.
[3:14:25.960 --> 3:14:30.000]  The experiment you'll be taking part in today involves the perception of line length. Your
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:34.160]  task will be simply to look at the line here on the left and indicate which of the three
[3:14:34.160 --> 3:14:39.120]  lines on the right is equal to it in length. So for example, the actors have been told
[3:14:39.120 --> 3:14:45.080]  to match the wrong lines. The volunteer will be monitored to see if he gives the correct
[3:14:45.080 --> 3:14:51.560]  answer or if he goes along with the opinion of the group and gives the wrong answer. In
[3:14:51.560 --> 3:14:55.720]  the first test, the correct answer is two.
[3:14:55.720 --> 3:15:10.440]  One. One. One. Two. One.
[3:15:10.440 --> 3:15:25.280]  Once again, the correct answer is two. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three.
[3:15:25.280 --> 3:15:30.080]  The ASH experiment has been repeated many times and the results have been supported
[3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:35.800]  again and again. We will conform to the group. Again, we're very social creatures. We're
[3:15:35.800 --> 3:15:42.400]  very much aware of what the people around us think. We want to be liked. We don't want
[3:15:42.400 --> 3:15:47.360]  to be seen to be rocked about. So we will go along with the group. Even if we don't believe
[3:15:47.360 --> 3:15:53.760]  what people are saying, we'll still go along. One. One. One.
[3:15:53.760 --> 3:15:59.120]  Group dynamics is one of the most powerful forces in human psychology.
[3:15:59.120 --> 3:16:03.200]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace

[3:21:14.240 --> 3:21:23.000]  Journal. A crazy story about bodies. A guy who says he started walking again after using
[3:21:23.000 --> 3:21:28.120]  bodies. It was absolutely wild. But you hear the stuff about these supplements because
[3:21:28.120 --> 3:21:32.000]  they're so powerful and they're all natural and they can really do some great things.
[3:21:32.000 --> 3:21:39.240]  I'm not a doctor. I'm not making any claims here. I'm just saying people have had really
[3:21:39.240 --> 3:21:42.560]  wonderful experiences, and of course they come back again and again once they purchase
[3:21:42.560 --> 3:21:47.440]  it once. Heck, maybe you can be like Data Battle Z and just buy a whole handful of stuff
[3:21:47.440 --> 3:21:53.200]  and go hand it out at a protest. That's a great way to support us and spread the word
[3:21:53.200 --> 3:22:01.280]  as well. Now, on to the topic of neofutilism and what exactly that looks like. Got a couple
[3:22:01.280 --> 3:22:07.680]  videos here to illustrate exactly what that looks like. First, let's hear from a man
[3:22:07.680 --> 3:22:13.280]  who I hadn't seen before, but I'm a big fan of now. He called himself the Hard Hat Intellectual.
[3:22:13.280 --> 3:22:18.720]  He made this video, posted on Twitter, says now you see why they had essential and non-essential
[3:22:18.720 --> 3:22:25.680]  take it away, Hard Hat Intellectual. So now, in case nobody figured it out, I mean, I'm
[3:22:25.680 --> 3:22:29.840]  pretty sure everybody probably should have figured it out, but in case there's people
[3:22:29.840 --> 3:22:39.360]  that didn't. Now you see why you were allowed to go to a Walmart or any of these big corporations
[3:22:39.360 --> 3:22:45.280]  that were deemed essential to get your groceries or whatever it is that you need to get and
[3:22:45.280 --> 3:22:50.000]  why you couldn't go to a mom and pop shop that sold essentially the same things and
[3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:56.520]  get what you need to get. Because they wanted to squeeze out all of these little places
[3:22:56.520 --> 3:23:01.120]  to basically remain the only options that people had left to go to. So that way they
[3:23:01.120 --> 3:23:10.440]  could implement these rules such as COVID passports and vaccination only for their employees.
[3:23:10.440 --> 3:23:16.280]  Because if they didn't do this first, mom and pop shops could have blew up because they
[3:23:16.280 --> 3:23:20.920]  could have counted it and been like, you can come work here. You don't have to be vaccinated.
[3:23:20.920 --> 3:23:26.240]  You can come shop here. You don't need to wear a mask. They could have did all of that.
[3:23:26.240 --> 3:23:31.160]  So how did they make sure that didn't happen? Say that we have some essential and some non
[3:23:31.160 --> 3:23:34.040]  essential businesses. We'll just squeeze them out.
[3:23:34.040 --> 3:23:39.720]  Yeah, literally as simple as that. And the thing is, it's not even speculation, I should
[3:23:39.720 --> 3:23:46.560]  say, because if you look at who actually planned the lockdown and the response to coronavirus,
[3:23:46.560 --> 3:23:51.040]  it was Larry Fink of BlackRock, mostly working with the federal government and advising them
[3:23:51.040 --> 3:23:56.040]  on exactly how to do this. If you look at Amazon and the unbelievably massive gains
[3:23:56.040 --> 3:24:01.200]  they've made over the last year while simultaneously lobbying for the lockdowns. I mean, this is
[3:24:01.200 --> 3:24:06.200]  the plan. And again, it's not speculation. We don't have to assume what these people
[3:24:06.200 --> 3:24:09.960]  want. They've actually come out and told us at this point. You know it as well as I
[3:24:09.960 --> 3:24:14.400]  do. I'm sure if you're watching the Alex Jones show, you know that you will own nothing.
[3:24:14.400 --> 3:24:21.960]  You will have no privacy and you will be happy. That's not just idle words. That's a promise.
[3:24:21.960 --> 3:24:26.840]  That's what they're actually implementing. So what does that actually look like? Well,
[3:24:26.840 --> 3:24:31.080]  first let's step back and understand when they say you will own nothing. You will have
[3:24:31.080 --> 3:24:36.440]  no privacy and you will be happy. They mean you. They don't mean them. They will still
[3:24:36.440 --> 3:24:41.800]  own everything. They'll still have all the privacy in the world. You won't. Oh, but
[3:24:41.800 --> 3:24:47.000]  they certainly will. See, they're not even subtle about it anymore. They are literally
[3:24:47.000 --> 3:24:52.320]  now explicitly exempting themselves from the rules that they are saddling on everybody
[3:24:52.320 --> 3:24:58.240]  else. And I have a few examples for you here from the UK. Business travelers from big multinationals
[3:24:58.240 --> 3:25:03.560]  get English quarantine waiver. That's right, folks. Executives at large multinational companies
[3:25:03.560 --> 3:25:07.640]  will be allowed to skip quarantine in England if they're deemed to be bringing significant
[3:25:07.640 --> 3:25:13.480]  economic benefit according to government rules laid out Tuesday. And this was back on June
[3:25:13.480 --> 3:25:17.880]  29, 2021. The announcement prompted anger from opposition MPs and business groups that
[3:25:17.880 --> 3:25:23.200]  represented that represent excluded smaller companies coming amid a backlash about sponsors
[3:25:23.200 --> 3:25:29.040]  and officials from footballs governing bodies, FIFA and UEFA being allowed to enter the country
[3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:34.040]  for Euro 2020 without having to quarantine. So in other words, if you come from some small
[3:25:34.040 --> 3:25:37.360]  company, if you don't represent a company and you just want to come to the UK, you've
[3:25:37.360 --> 3:25:41.440]  got to stay in a hotel. You've got to spend thousands of dollars to pay for that stay
[3:25:41.440 --> 3:25:44.400]  in the hotel. You've got to stay there for two weeks to quarantine before you're allowed
[3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:49.040]  to enter into the country. Unless, of course, you are of the elected class, unless you are
[3:25:49.040 --> 3:25:55.560]  of the new neo feudal noble elite, in which case these laws literally just do not apply
[3:25:55.560 --> 3:26:00.880]  to you. And it's actually as simple as that. What about this story from just a few days
[3:26:00.880 --> 3:26:05.800]  ago? Google founder Larry Page gets New Zealand residency under new special visa for Uber
[3:26:05.800 --> 3:26:11.960]  wealthy. New Zealand totally locked down. You cannot visit New Zealand. You cannot go to
[3:26:11.960 --> 3:26:16.680]  New Zealand. New Zealand is off limits 100% unless you're an executive for Google, in
[3:26:16.680 --> 3:26:21.280]  which case the laws don't apply to you. You're a noble. You're an elite. You're not a surf
[3:26:21.280 --> 3:26:25.600]  or a slave that must be restricted in your movement. You have all the movement you could
[3:26:25.600 --> 3:26:33.200]  possibly want because you're the elite. You're the elect. You're the chosen. Google co founder
[3:26:33.200 --> 3:26:37.000]  Larry Page has gained New Zealand residency officials confirmed Friday, stoking debate
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:41.120]  over whether extremely wealthy people can essentially buy access to the South Pacific
[3:26:41.120 --> 3:26:45.640]  country. Well, they can buy access to absolutely anywhere. The laws don't apply to them. They're
[3:26:45.640 --> 3:26:52.760]  literally written that way. What about this video from earlier today? Representative Corey
[3:26:52.760 --> 3:26:58.520]  Bush says he deserves private security, but you need to suck it up and defund the police.
[3:26:58.520 --> 3:27:02.160]  We've said it a million times here. Defund the police means two things. Privatize the
[3:27:02.160 --> 3:27:06.440]  police, federalize the police. Those are the goals of the defund the police movement to
[3:27:06.440 --> 3:27:14.440]  have federal police that are not able to easily have oversight over them where you don't actually
[3:27:14.440 --> 3:27:18.640]  have control over them. You can't elect them like you elect a sheriff or a constable. They're
[3:27:18.640 --> 3:27:23.440]  controlled from Washington, DC, and they carry out the orders of the federal government completely
[3:27:23.440 --> 3:27:28.000]  outside of the realm of control of the local powers. That's one option. The other option
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:32.440]  is to privatize the police. That means the poor, the middle class, you won't have police
[3:27:32.440 --> 3:27:38.160]  because you can't afford it. But the gated communities, they'll have police. The politicians,
[3:27:38.160 --> 3:27:41.480]  they definitely, they'll have taxpayer funded police. They won't even have to pay for it.
[3:27:41.480 --> 3:27:45.560]  It'll be funded by you. I mean, Corey Bush is literally saying that again. None of this
[3:27:45.560 --> 3:27:51.440]  is speculation. None of this is like, uh, doomsday. Here's what I'm just telling you what's happening.
[3:27:51.440 --> 3:27:56.920]  I'm just telling you what's actually going on right now. And Representative Corey Bush
[3:27:56.920 --> 3:28:01.480]  is actively and telling you that she's doing this. She's defunding your police. She's taking
[3:28:01.480 --> 3:28:07.360]  the security away from your neighborhood and she's surrounding herself with men with guns.
[3:28:07.360 --> 3:28:11.080]  That's just what they're doing. They want you to eat bugs. They want you to no longer
[3:28:11.080 --> 3:28:16.000]  have a car. They don't want you to own a home. John Kerry, however, and his family has taken
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:23.120]  16 trips this year alone in their private jet. Again, he's the climate czar. He's the one
[3:28:23.120 --> 3:28:27.480]  going around literally telling us that we're not allowed to drive, that we shouldn't be
[3:28:27.480 --> 3:28:33.280]  able to buy gasoline vehicles or, you know, eat meat, right? Eat bugs, eat the chemical
[3:28:33.280 --> 3:28:39.160]  stew that, you know, we pretend looks like meat. Meanwhile, 17 trips in his family's
[3:28:39.160 --> 3:28:45.040]  private jet, one of which was to go pick up an award for his work with climate change.
[3:28:45.040 --> 3:28:49.200]  Truly incredible. And then of course you have Jeff Bezos, who is telling you to eat cockroaches
[3:28:49.200 --> 3:28:55.360]  for the sake of climate change while he takes a vanity spaceship ride above the atmosphere
[3:28:55.360 --> 3:28:59.640]  for an Instagram selfie using 100 times the gasoline for a cross country trip.
[3:28:59.640 --> 3:29:03.560]  A scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone
[3:29:03.560 --> 3:29:09.640]  from beta testing to operational. The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation
[3:29:09.640 --> 3:29:13.920]  takeover, their robot takeover. But the good news is we've been working and you've been
[3:29:13.920 --> 3:29:18.280]  working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this,
[3:29:18.280 --> 3:29:22.920]  to be able to find it off. Humanity is strong. We're incredible. And if we're aware of the
[3:29:22.920 --> 3:29:27.160]  attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God for guidance,
[3:29:27.160 --> 3:29:31.520]  we will defeat it. So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is
[3:29:31.520 --> 3:29:36.280]  essential and warning others is absolutely essential. And at the same time, supporting
[3:29:36.280 --> 3:29:40.440]  info wars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're
[3:29:40.440 --> 3:29:46.680]  great products for you and your family. And they're also funding our operation infowarstore.com.
[3:29:46.680 --> 3:29:51.440]  It's incredible. A lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain
[3:29:51.440 --> 3:29:56.720]  breakdowns are back in like bodies, vaso beats and others. So get them today at infowarstore.com.
[3:29:56.720 --> 3:29:58.720]  And I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[3:29:58.720 --> 3:30:05.560]  Let's go to one in Connecticut. You're on the air. Thanks for holding. I'm sure cancer.
[3:30:05.560 --> 3:30:11.360]  Thank you. Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro. And it's a pleasure to
[3:30:11.360 --> 3:30:14.160]  be talking right now. Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[3:30:14.160 --> 3:30:19.440]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in. I'm a truck driver and two
[3:30:19.440 --> 3:30:25.000]  before us have changed the way I drive. Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple
[3:30:25.000 --> 3:30:33.000]  of us. We are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans. We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and
[3:30:33.000 --> 3:30:37.040]  Rolla. And I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar. And I just want to
[3:30:37.040 --> 3:30:41.280]  thank you for that, man. Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long term
[3:30:41.280 --> 3:30:45.560]  high quality energy powder there is. So this, this was designed on one of the top guys in
[3:30:45.560 --> 3:30:48.600]  the country. He didn't want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but
[3:30:48.600 --> 3:30:51.880]  we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it. And we believe
[3:30:51.880 --> 3:30:56.040]  it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there. And you're saying that it's
[3:30:56.040 --> 3:30:59.040]  made your life better. So that means a lot to me. Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[3:30:59.040 --> 3:31:03.720]  We love you. The entire new order system is about making
[3:31:03.720 --> 3:31:09.440]  you feel pathetic, making you feel weak, making you play the part of a victim so you don't
[3:31:09.440 --> 3:31:13.920]  take your birthright as being made the image of God and the incredible mission and destiny
[3:31:13.920 --> 3:31:20.080]  we have being given free will, being given free will, being given consciousness is literally
[3:31:20.080 --> 3:31:26.360]  the seed of an entire universe, an entire system. And the fact that you're able to commune
[3:31:26.360 --> 3:31:30.160]  with God, the fact you're able to see the beauty of the sunset or the beauty of the
[3:31:30.160 --> 3:31:34.520]  waves in the ocean or the beauty of your wife, your husband, the beauty of your child
[3:31:34.520 --> 3:31:39.480]  learning knowledge, the beauty of music, the fact that you can commune with that and resonate
[3:31:39.480 --> 3:31:45.480]  with that is energetic. And that itself is what God teaches us is worship. So don't
[3:31:45.480 --> 3:31:49.920]  worship the globalist, don't worship the NFL, don't worship all the things in the system,
[3:31:49.920 --> 3:31:55.240]  but worship the things of God because we're made by God and appreciate your consciousness
[3:31:55.240 --> 3:32:00.200]  and appreciate free speech while you still have it, while you still have it.
[3:32:00.200 --> 3:32:05.040]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that
[3:32:05.040 --> 3:32:09.960]  I've ever done. All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five
[3:32:09.960 --> 3:32:16.680]  months in my efforts to bring the truth forward. Well, it's all come down to this. I'm having
[3:32:16.680 --> 3:32:24.160]  a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th and 12th. This historical event will be live streamed
[3:32:24.160 --> 3:32:32.440]  72 hours straight on my new platform, frankspeech.com. You can help by getting everybody you know
[3:32:32.440 --> 3:32:40.000]  to go to frankspeech.com now. To help support the cyber symposium event, I am offering
[3:32:40.000 --> 3:32:46.640]  some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at frankspeech.com.
[3:32:46.640 --> 3:32:56.920]  Thank you and God bless. Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALIX or call 800-675-4614
[3:32:56.920 --> 3:33:20.600]  and use promo code ALIX. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The thing, I won't let
[3:33:20.600 --> 3:33:24.520]  them get that off. You can't get that off. I'm going to make sure I have security because
[3:33:24.520 --> 3:33:28.800]  I know I have had attempts on my life and I have too much work to do. There are too many
[3:33:28.800 --> 3:33:35.200]  people that need help right now for me to allow that. So if I end up spending $200,000,
[3:33:35.200 --> 3:33:41.320]  if I spend $10 more on it, you know what? I get to be here to do the work. So suck it
[3:33:41.320 --> 3:33:45.720]  up and defunding the police has to happen. We need to defund the police and put that
[3:33:45.720 --> 3:33:50.840]  money into social safety net. Yep, they got to defund the police. We use your tax dollars
[3:33:50.840 --> 3:33:55.560]  to protect themselves and surround themselves with massive amounts of armed security. That's
[3:33:55.560 --> 3:34:01.840]  neofedalism in a nutshell, right? You only get security. You only get privacy. You only
[3:34:01.840 --> 3:34:05.400]  get property if you can pay for it and you can only pay for it if you serve the system
[3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:09.960]  because the system is total. The system is everything. The system decides what you do
[3:34:09.960 --> 3:34:15.540]  and don't deserve. Really incredible. So that's what neofedalism looks like. Let's just take
[3:34:15.540 --> 3:34:23.400]  a trip down memory lane, shall we? And take a quick little jaunt through dystopian hell
[3:34:23.400 --> 3:34:28.720]  world that's being built up for us. Here's the story from earlier today. Apple to scan
[3:34:28.720 --> 3:34:34.520]  U.S. iPhones for images of child sexual abuse. Apple unveiled plans to scan U.S. iPhones for
[3:34:34.520 --> 3:34:39.280]  images of child sexual abuse, drawing applause from child protection groups, but raising concern
[3:34:39.280 --> 3:34:43.480]  among some security researchers that their system could be misused, including by governments
[3:34:43.480 --> 3:34:48.200]  looking to surveil their citizens. Well, you don't say. I guess that is what it could
[3:34:48.200 --> 3:34:52.000]  be used for, isn't it? The tool designed to detect known images of child sexual abuse
[3:34:52.000 --> 3:34:56.960]  called neural match will scan images before they're uploaded to the iCloud, before they're
[3:34:56.960 --> 3:35:01.400]  uploaded to the iCloud. If it finds a match, the image will be reviewed by a human. If child
[3:35:01.400 --> 3:35:05.520]  pornography is confirmed, the user's account will be disabled in the National Center for
[3:35:05.520 --> 3:35:10.840]  Missing and Exploited Children notified. Separately, Apple plans to scan users' encrypted messages
[3:35:10.840 --> 3:35:17.360]  for sexually explicit content as a child safety measure, which is also alarmed privacy advocates
[3:35:17.360 --> 3:35:24.160]  should alarm every human being that they would actually implement this, like not just talk
[3:35:24.160 --> 3:35:27.560]  about it. They're implementing it now, and you are not going to be able to opt out of
[3:35:27.560 --> 3:35:32.280]  it. As far as I understand, it will be automatically uploaded to your phone, whether you like it
[3:35:32.280 --> 3:35:36.480]  or not. Remember, you don't own anything. This is the world they're creating. You're
[3:35:36.480 --> 3:35:39.840]  going to rent your car. You're going to rent your house. You're going to rent your phone.
[3:35:39.840 --> 3:35:42.760]  What does that mean? That means they want to come into your house. They don't need your
[3:35:42.760 --> 3:35:46.640]  permission. They need your landlord's permission. If they want to break into your phone, they
[3:35:46.640 --> 3:35:50.720]  don't need your permission. They need the corporation who owns the phone's permission.
[3:35:50.720 --> 3:35:55.520]  If they want to have your self-driving car, go ahead and turn yourself into the police
[3:35:55.520 --> 3:35:59.240]  station for a wrong think. Well, there's nothing you can do about that because it's not your
[3:35:59.240 --> 3:36:04.960]  car. You're renting that car. You're paying for that car piece by piece. So what are you
[3:36:04.960 --> 3:36:10.720]  going to do? Nothing. There's nothing you can do. Matthew Green, a top cryptology research
[3:36:10.720 --> 3:36:16.520]  at John Hopkins University, I'm sorry, cryptography research, warned that the systems could be
[3:36:16.520 --> 3:36:20.840]  used to frame innocent people by sending them seemingly innocuous images designed to trigger
[3:36:20.840 --> 3:36:25.920]  matches for child pornography. That could fool Apple's algorithm and alert law enforcement.
[3:36:25.920 --> 3:36:29.360]  Researchers have been able to do this pretty easily. He said of the ability to trick such
[3:36:29.360 --> 3:36:36.040]  systems, such systems so far utterly unreliable. Just as I was compiling these stories for
[3:36:36.040 --> 3:36:41.360]  today's program, I ran across the old story about Google's AI system that, just like this
[3:36:41.360 --> 3:36:46.320]  one from Apple, was scanning photos in order to try to determine what was pictured in the
[3:36:46.320 --> 3:36:51.480]  images. And they had to make big changes to it because it kept calling black people gorillas.
[3:36:51.480 --> 3:36:56.880]  Like these things are not as good as they would need to be for this actually to be effective.
[3:36:56.880 --> 3:37:02.280]  Now what they say is that they're only going to be scanning phones for already uploaded
[3:37:02.280 --> 3:37:06.080]  images of child pornography. So apparently they have a giant database somewhere that
[3:37:06.080 --> 3:37:13.160]  has every photo of known child pornography on it already right now. Okay, so that alone
[3:37:13.160 --> 3:37:19.200]  maybe is worth some talking about, but we'll just assume that it's all being done right.
[3:37:19.200 --> 3:37:24.640]  So they have the world's largest child pornography database there at Apple or whatever that they're
[3:37:24.640 --> 3:37:31.800]  going to basically scan and try to match images that from that known database with images
[3:37:31.800 --> 3:37:38.360]  in your phone. Now I'm not a technical expert. I'm not an engineer. I gotta think there's
[3:37:38.360 --> 3:37:44.360]  a better way to do this. Like this is so extreme. It's pretty outrageous. And look, just because
[3:37:44.360 --> 3:37:49.840]  it's on your phone doesn't mean the laws change at all. Right? They do if just Apple just
[3:37:49.840 --> 3:37:53.600]  does this and nobody does anything about it. And they're just like, yeah, we own your phone.
[3:37:53.600 --> 3:37:57.720]  We own all of your information. We'll look at it. We'll search it. We'll copy it. We'll
[3:37:57.720 --> 3:38:01.680]  show it to people that work for us. Like if they just do that and nobody stops them, then
[3:38:01.680 --> 3:38:05.640]  I guess that is legal because nobody's preventing them from doing so. That's sort of the reality
[3:38:05.640 --> 3:38:12.860]  of laws it is. But what if they wanted to come into your house and look through your
[3:38:12.860 --> 3:38:18.000]  photo albums? Is this any different? No, it's not. Just because it's on a phone doesn't
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:23.560]  mean suddenly anybody who works at Apple has access to this. This is a total violation
[3:38:23.560 --> 3:38:28.600]  and a total overreach. Other abuses could include government surveillance of dissidents
[3:38:28.600 --> 3:38:32.520]  or protesters. What happens, this article asks, when the Chinese government says, here's
[3:38:32.520 --> 3:38:35.920]  a list of files that we want you to scan for, green ass. Does Apple say no? I hope they
[3:38:35.920 --> 3:38:41.560]  say no, but their technology won't say no. Well, the technology is there. Apple has already
[3:38:41.560 --> 3:38:47.840]  given all of its encryption keys over to China in exchange for being able to build their
[3:38:47.840 --> 3:38:52.520]  devices in their slave factories and sell their product to Chinese consumers. So China
[3:38:52.520 --> 3:38:57.680]  has all the cards here, right? Hey, we want to use your file scanning methodology in order
[3:38:57.680 --> 3:39:02.880]  to search out and destroy people who are against us. Apple may, you know, maybe if they have
[3:39:02.880 --> 3:39:07.280]  a flash of conscience, they'll say, no, you're not allowed to do that. And then China says,
[3:39:07.280 --> 3:39:11.640]  then we'll bankrupt you. Apple says, okay, you can do it now, right? It's as simple as
[3:39:11.640 --> 3:39:15.440]  that. They have all the power. Meanwhile, you have this advocacy group reveals Amazon,
[3:39:15.440 --> 3:39:21.840]  Netflix and Twitter among the major facilitators of child exploitation. Remember, Tim Cook
[3:39:21.840 --> 3:39:25.960]  of Apple gave a speech where he talked about kicking off people like Alex Jones off of
[3:39:25.960 --> 3:39:30.760]  their devices off of the internet entirely. And he said it's a sin. It's a sin to let
[3:39:30.760 --> 3:39:36.920]  these people on our platform. It's a sin to let people like Alex Jones speak freely because
[3:39:36.920 --> 3:39:41.400]  he tells people what we're up to. But no, no, it's just a sin. It's a sin to allow this
[3:39:41.400 --> 3:39:45.560]  type of material. He didn't say it was a sin to allow child pornography. He didn't say it
[3:39:45.560 --> 3:39:50.720]  was a sin to allow hardcore pornography. He didn't say it was a sin to allow, you know,
[3:39:50.720 --> 3:39:56.600]  drug culture or any other incredibly damaging, you know, aspects of our culture. No, no,
[3:39:56.600 --> 3:40:01.000]  it was about Alex Jones. It was about people speaking up for freedom and liberty. See,
[3:40:01.000 --> 3:40:05.760]  they could have done a lot of things to solve these, these little issues of child pornography
[3:40:05.760 --> 3:40:11.040]  being shared on all of these sites to a massive degree. But they're not that interested in
[3:40:11.040 --> 3:40:16.080]  that. No, no, but they're very, very interested, very concerned about shutting down your freedom
[3:40:16.080 --> 3:40:20.520]  of speech. Right. Well, you can post whatever you want to Twitter. It goes right through.
[3:40:20.520 --> 3:40:25.840]  I mean, there's been awful stuff on Twitter that is actually illegal. That's just up there
[3:40:25.840 --> 3:40:31.120]  and stays up there for days and days and days. I mean, the porno sites are even worse, right,
[3:40:31.120 --> 3:40:35.840]  but they're all supported by Big Tech. You can still download their apps at the App Store.
[3:40:35.840 --> 3:40:40.400]  Right. Even though they've been caught and sued and had people actually reach out and
[3:40:40.400 --> 3:40:45.160]  say, Hey, this is an image of this is a video of me from when I was underage that was taken
[3:40:45.160 --> 3:40:49.200]  illegally. Please take it down. And they don't take it down. They just leave it up. Now they're
[3:40:49.200 --> 3:40:53.440]  being sued for that. So they're still allowed on the App Store. Right. They're still allowed
[3:40:53.440 --> 3:40:59.360]  to be present all these. It's not a sin to kick them off or to keep them on rather. No,
[3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:04.840]  they could be doing doing anything. Meanwhile, Netflix is like making the movie cuties, which
[3:41:04.840 --> 3:41:09.560]  is just like pretty much literally child pornography. So this is the way it's going. Right. Many
[3:41:09.560 --> 3:41:13.200]  companies made record profits during COVID-19 pandemic and advocacy group is calling on many
[3:41:13.200 --> 3:41:18.240]  of them to stop allowing child exploitation to be part of their bottom line. Well, here's
[3:41:18.240 --> 3:41:22.760]  the deal. They don't want to. They're going to keep doing this, but they do know that
[3:41:22.760 --> 3:41:28.400]  if they want to massively encroach on your privacy, if they want to spy in real time
[3:41:28.400 --> 3:41:33.080]  on your photos before they'd even gets uploaded to the cloud, then they've got to have something
[3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:37.680]  that they know the public will actually allow them to justify this insane behavior with.
[3:41:37.680 --> 3:41:46.080]  And of course, they choose child pornography as that particular topic. Folks, I want you
[3:41:46.080 --> 3:41:51.920]  to really understand where this is headed and what it means that big tech is now intimately
[3:41:51.920 --> 3:41:58.480]  involved with our government from the federal to the local level, that they not only essentially
[3:41:58.480 --> 3:42:02.120]  hold veto power over anybody running for our government. If they don't like you, they'll
[3:42:02.120 --> 3:42:07.920]  delete your account. They'll delete your ability to reach out over Twitter or Facebook or any
[3:42:07.920 --> 3:42:11.400]  other social media platform, which is the primary way people communicate these days,
[3:42:11.400 --> 3:42:16.720]  meaning they can completely neuter, completely destroy your entire campaign before it even
[3:42:16.720 --> 3:42:20.880]  leaves the barn. They can do that. They essentially veto power over who we have representing us.
[3:42:20.880 --> 3:42:26.320]  But it's not just that the number of people that intermingle between big tech and the
[3:42:26.320 --> 3:42:31.760]  government is truly astonishing. People moving back and forth between the FBI and Facebook
[3:42:31.760 --> 3:42:41.480]  or Twitter and the Biden administration, they're all intimately intertwined. An incestuous cabal
[3:42:41.480 --> 3:42:48.960]  of psychopath control freaks with their finger on the nuclear trigger and on your phone.
[3:42:48.960 --> 3:42:53.080]  What that looks like and where that's headed is all in this stack. And I'll get to that
[3:42:53.080 --> 3:42:58.880]  in the final segment on the other side. Don't go anywhere, folks. We'll be right back.

[3:45:04.040 --> 3:45:08.320]  controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go when we do. But because
[3:45:08.320 --> 3:45:12.560]  they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still
[3:45:12.560 --> 3:45:17.320]  have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire has a lot of power. But when I'm not

[3:47:05.560 --> 3:47:17.800]  All right, welcome back folks. Final segment of the ALIX Jones show. I'm Harrison Smith
[3:47:17.800 --> 3:47:23.040]  and the host of The American Journal, 8 to 11 a.m. every day here on infowars.com.
[3:47:23.040 --> 3:47:29.680]  So let's talk about what a world designed by big tech really looks like. First of all,
[3:47:29.680 --> 3:47:35.440]  this story from August 3rd a few days ago. Want a $10 credit from Amazon? Well, yeah,
[3:47:35.440 --> 3:47:41.160]  sure. Well, just let it scan your palm. Oh, never mind. No, thank you. No, I'd rather
[3:47:41.160 --> 3:47:47.360]  not have you scan my palm for a pittance. You weirdos. Amazon is offering store credit
[3:47:47.360 --> 3:47:51.760]  in exchange for customers submitting a digital scan of their palm according to reports. The
[3:47:51.760 --> 3:47:55.800]  e-commerce company in 2020 introduced biometric palm print scanners in some of its brick and
[3:47:55.800 --> 3:48:01.040]  mortar stores allowing registered shoppers to pay for goods by waving their hand over
[3:48:01.040 --> 3:48:09.720]  to the devices. I got to say that kind of makes sense actually. I can't do it. I can't
[3:48:09.720 --> 3:48:15.800]  do it. Just imagine what it would look like paying for something like that. See when corporations
[3:48:15.800 --> 3:48:20.560]  and the government combine together, it's what we call fascism. So when I reach out
[3:48:20.560 --> 3:48:29.320]  to scan my palm print, I think you get an image of what it might look like. Like a salute
[3:48:29.320 --> 3:48:36.840]  sort of in a way. So this is one step towards this all-encompassing total control grid of
[3:48:36.840 --> 3:48:43.600]  Amazon. But let's expand a little bit farther as we go to the Washington Post. Amazon is
[3:48:43.600 --> 3:48:48.520]  a, I'm sorry, let's go into the insider. Facebook and Amazon are so big, they're creating their
[3:48:48.520 --> 3:48:55.360]  own company towns. So Facebook and Amazon are actually building towns. So this is the
[3:48:55.360 --> 3:48:59.960]  vision of the future. The vision of the future is you'll work at a company that owns your
[3:48:59.960 --> 3:49:03.680]  town. That means they own your home. That means you're renting your home from your company.
[3:49:03.680 --> 3:49:07.600]  They own the store that you go to, meaning the wages that you're paid are then returned
[3:49:07.600 --> 3:49:12.320]  directly to the company to pay for the goods that you need to buy. The car that you drive
[3:49:12.320 --> 3:49:18.040]  will likely also be rented from that company. With Amazon and the media outlets they own,
[3:49:18.040 --> 3:49:21.280]  that means the news that you read will be coming from your company. Like the Washington
[3:49:21.280 --> 3:49:27.720]  Post that we're about to read is actually owned by Amazon. Of course, Amazon Productions,
[3:49:27.720 --> 3:49:32.560]  very large Amazon Prime video. So they'll own the entertainment that you enjoy. They'll
[3:49:32.560 --> 3:49:38.360]  own the media that you read, the news that you actually learn about the world for, the
[3:49:38.360 --> 3:49:43.120]  car that you drive, the phone that you have in your pocket, all of your information, your
[3:49:43.120 --> 3:49:47.760]  computer, your house, everything will be owned by the company that you work for, making you
[3:49:47.760 --> 3:49:54.560]  essentially an indentured servant, a member of a company town. That's literally what it
[3:49:54.560 --> 3:50:02.280]  is. And let's just understand real quick how big Amazon is. Amazon now employs more than
[3:50:02.280 --> 3:50:11.160]  one million people. They added 400,000 jobs in 2020 alone. Now this article is from October
[3:50:11.160 --> 3:50:17.720]  of 2020. Since then they've grown even more. One out of every 153 American workers is
[3:50:17.720 --> 3:50:26.040]  an Amazon employee. In other words, this trajectory continues by the end of this year about 1%
[3:50:26.040 --> 3:50:33.000]  of all of America will be employed by Amazon. Now what is it like to be employed by Amazon?
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:36.240]  I don't think you need me to answer this. I think you know what it's like to be employed
[3:50:36.240 --> 3:50:41.440]  by Amazon. I think it's a heck of a lot like slavery. Let's read some stories about how
[3:50:41.440 --> 3:50:47.440]  Amazon treats their workers and understand that if the Bohemoth, if the cancer continues
[3:50:47.440 --> 3:50:53.120]  to grow, more and more percentage of America will be under Amazon. Amazon will own more
[3:50:53.120 --> 3:50:59.160]  and more of the things that it then rents back to you for the wages that it pays you.
[3:50:59.160 --> 3:51:03.120]  But only if you're lucky enough to work for Amazon because as this headline points out,
[3:51:03.120 --> 3:51:08.120]  you might get fired by a robot. Amazon employee fired by a robot is you versus the machine's
[3:51:08.120 --> 3:51:14.760]  algorithm. As a 63-year-old Army veteran was fired by a machine for having not done his
[3:51:14.760 --> 3:51:21.040]  job properly despite the fact that the reason he couldn't deliver the packages he was slated
[3:51:21.040 --> 3:51:26.440]  to deliver were out of his control. It was things like locked apartment complexes and
[3:51:26.440 --> 3:51:32.520]  traffic that he couldn't control and yet now he's been fired by a machine. No one to
[3:51:32.520 --> 3:51:38.840]  appeal to, no human involved in the decision process, just an algorithm firing you from
[3:51:38.840 --> 3:51:42.520]  your job. And of course the opposite is also true. I saw a post on Twitter a little while
[3:51:42.520 --> 3:51:48.200]  ago that was a legit post where somebody like, I was blessed by the algorithm today. They're
[3:51:48.200 --> 3:51:53.920]  like, you know, I got up and there's a really good song playing on my Spotify list and then
[3:51:53.920 --> 3:51:59.440]  I got in my car and it led me around the traffic and then I, you know, I'm an Uber driver so
[3:51:59.440 --> 3:52:05.680]  it gave me really good and profitable rides to give to people. And then this is, you know,
[3:52:05.680 --> 3:52:11.200]  and so I mean, when you talk about an AI God, if you're living in a company town and you're
[3:52:11.200 --> 3:52:16.480]  working off an app on your phone and your hours and your pay is all determined by robots
[3:52:16.480 --> 3:52:20.600]  and they can actually slightly tweak it to where the more they approve of you, the better
[3:52:20.600 --> 3:52:25.240]  job you have, the easier, you know, the gigs that you have to work are, the less work you
[3:52:25.240 --> 3:52:29.000]  have to do, the more money you get paid. I mean, literally, you worship the algorithm
[3:52:29.000 --> 3:52:32.840]  and that's what this Twitter post was like, you know, praise the algorithm. They blessed
[3:52:32.840 --> 3:52:38.800]  me today. It's real. It's serious. And this is really where we're going. Moving away from
[3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:44.520]  Amazon. What about Facebook? Inside Facebook's cult like workplace where dissent isn't is
[3:52:44.520 --> 3:52:50.000]  discouraged and employees pretend to be happy all the time. Welcome to your new dystopia.
[3:52:50.000 --> 3:52:55.160]  Welcome to Facebook town. Smiler. You're fired, right? More than a dozen fit former Facebook
[3:52:55.160 --> 3:52:58.960]  employees detailed how the company's leadership and performance review system created a culture
[3:52:58.960 --> 3:53:03.760]  where any dissent is discouraged. Employees say Facebook's stack ranking performance review
[3:53:03.760 --> 3:53:07.620]  system drives employees to push out products and features that drive user engagement without
[3:53:07.620 --> 3:53:12.440]  fully considering potential long term negative impacts on user experience or privacy. Reliance
[3:53:12.440 --> 3:53:16.160]  on peer review creates an underlying pressure for Facebook employees to forge friendships
[3:53:16.160 --> 3:53:23.120]  with colleagues for the sake of career advancement. Sounds like dystopian hell to me. Quite frankly,
[3:53:23.120 --> 3:53:27.560]  to be honest with you, just horrific, pretend to be happy all the time, right? Like if you're
[3:53:27.560 --> 3:53:31.800]  sad, then you're being mean to the company. So you'll be punished. It's just communism.
[3:53:31.800 --> 3:53:37.480]  It's I mean, this is you recognize this mentality around the entire country right now about
[3:53:37.480 --> 3:53:42.680]  this from zero hedge. Amazon to use banned Chinese firms or welly and thermal cameras
[3:53:42.680 --> 3:53:48.880]  to scan workers. So they're just scanning workers and constantly surveilling them to
[3:53:48.880 --> 3:53:54.000]  watch them. Why are they watching them? Well, they want to crack down on unionizing. People
[3:53:54.000 --> 3:53:59.120]  want to unionize. They want to get together to maybe, you know, agitate for better pay,
[3:53:59.120 --> 3:54:04.160]  better, you know, benefits, whatever it is. Well, Amazon spends a lot of money and a lot
[3:54:04.160 --> 3:54:08.040]  of AI on how to prevent that from happening. One of the things they discovered is that
[3:54:08.040 --> 3:54:12.280]  the more diverse your workforce is, the less likely it is to unionize. So a little push
[3:54:12.280 --> 3:54:18.360]  diversity for the explicit purpose of causing lower social cohesion, which means there's
[3:54:18.360 --> 3:54:23.800]  a less likely chance that the serfs, the little people down below, get together, team up and
[3:54:23.800 --> 3:54:28.880]  actually apply pressure to the people above them. So you can expect Facebook town and
[3:54:28.880 --> 3:54:33.920]  Amazon town to be very diverse. It'll be a very diverse massive surveillance system
[3:54:33.920 --> 3:54:38.000]  scanning you and watching you all the time with thermal cameras, you know, because more
[3:54:38.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  diverse you are, the less you get along, the less you cooperate and the less threat you
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:47.960]  pose to your overrulers. What about this? Amazon wants a key to your business and your garage.
[3:54:47.960 --> 3:54:52.040]  Why security experts urge caution? Oh, I can tell you why. It's because they want you to
[3:54:52.040 --> 3:54:59.800]  give them a key to your house and their garage. Gee, what's wrong with that? Well, yeah, okay,
[3:54:59.800 --> 3:55:03.720]  it's pretty obvious. But again, they wouldn't even have to ask if you don't own your house,
[3:55:03.720 --> 3:55:08.400]  right? And BlackRock is involved in buying up massive swaths of houses in order to rent
[3:55:08.400 --> 3:55:11.040]  them back to people, meaning you don't own it, meaning you don't have a right to say
[3:55:11.040 --> 3:55:17.480]  who does and does not enter into your abode. No, they'll enter whether you like it or not.
[3:55:17.480 --> 3:55:22.480]  Former FBI officials tapped for Amazon's growing security apparatus. So, you know, they'll
[3:55:22.480 --> 3:55:27.840]  have the most high tech security surveillance and everything. Amazon delivery drivers forced
[3:55:27.840 --> 3:55:33.800]  you to sign biometric consent form or lose their job. We can always just get another job,
[3:55:33.800 --> 3:55:39.160]  you know, unless Amazon has a total monopoly over the entire economy, in which case, you're
[3:55:39.160 --> 3:55:46.120]  signing the damn form, right? Amazon warehouse organizers allege a year of retaliation. See,
[3:55:46.120 --> 3:55:49.560]  they wanted to unionize. They wanted slightly better pay. They wanted not to be fired by
[3:55:49.560 --> 3:55:53.760]  robots. They wanted to not have to pee in bottles while they were out doing deliveries.
[3:55:53.760 --> 3:55:58.480]  They wanted to not have a situation where instead of buying air conditioning so that
[3:55:58.480 --> 3:56:02.840]  people did not pass out while working on the warehouse floor, Amazon decided it was more
[3:56:02.840 --> 3:56:07.840]  cost effective to just park an ambulance outside and wait for people to pass out and then treat
[3:56:07.840 --> 3:56:12.960]  them afterwards. Horrific, anti-human, totally brutal. And if you try to organize, then the
[3:56:12.960 --> 3:56:19.480]  entire company will crush you, come down on you and try to destroy your life. These companies
[3:56:19.480 --> 3:56:23.360]  are not good. Like, I don't know how many more stories I have to read. I'll read more,
[3:56:23.360 --> 3:56:28.240]  but just bottom line, bottom story, these big tech companies that are now, you know,
[3:56:28.240 --> 3:56:33.200]  imposing themselves, putting themselves, usurping the government's power, usurping your own
[3:56:33.200 --> 3:56:36.840]  power saying, we are in charge, we will dictate how you live your life, what you're allowed
[3:56:36.840 --> 3:56:43.200]  to say, who you're allowed to vote for, are awful people who, when they have an iota of
[3:56:43.200 --> 3:56:47.360]  power, use it to destroy anybody that stands up against them. And we see it time and time
[3:56:47.360 --> 3:56:51.840]  again. What about this? Amazon enables Sidewalk Network on millions of devices. You thought
[3:56:51.840 --> 3:56:56.480]  it was your device? No, it's Amazon's device. It's Amazon's network. You're just on it.
[3:56:56.480 --> 3:57:03.000]  Doorbolt Camera Firm Ring has partnered with 2,000 police firms across the United States.
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:07.720]  Again, just solidifying the great merger. And of course, you have all of the stories
[3:57:07.720 --> 3:57:14.000]  of listening into devices, even when it's not, you know, even when they're not allowed
[3:57:14.000 --> 3:57:18.480]  to or you don't say, okay, Google or, you know, Alexa or whatever. They have all the
[3:57:18.480 --> 3:57:21.960]  medical records, by the way. I don't know if you know that. Project Nightingale with
[3:57:21.960 --> 3:57:27.840]  Google got all your medical records. AWS also has what they call a lake of medical records.
[3:57:27.840 --> 3:57:32.040]  And it goes on and on and on. What about this? Google Drive takes down users' personal copy
[3:57:32.040 --> 3:57:37.080]  of Pandemic. So even your files, if they're stored on the cloud, they'll be deleted. So
[3:57:37.080 --> 3:57:44.640]  just total surveillance, total control, total subjugation, and yet, in this cult-like atmosphere,
[3:57:44.640 --> 3:57:48.720]  you have to pretend like you're happy or you'll be fired. It's dystopia and it's coming.
[3:57:48.720 --> 3:57:53.200]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021. We're seeing
[3:57:53.200 --> 3:57:57.480]  world government, World Eye of the East being announced, forced inoculations. All the tyranny
[3:57:57.480 --> 3:58:02.000]  we warned of is down here. But on the good side, there is also a global awakening, the
[3:58:02.000 --> 3:58:06.280]  lives of which this planet has never seen. So truly, the battle between good and evil
[3:58:06.280 --> 3:58:10.000]  is now front and center. That's why I want to thank all the viewers, all the listeners

[3:58:49.760 --> 3:58:55.760]  The world is awakening. The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm. They
[3:58:55.760 --> 3:59:01.080]  are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral
[3:59:01.080 --> 3:59:08.120]  commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome. And so even though
[3:59:08.120 --> 3:59:13.000]  it seems like the globalist are winning, the truth is they've had to come out in the open
[3:59:13.000 --> 3:59:19.960]  to attack human freedom because they're actually losing. We have forced them out in the open.
[3:59:19.960 --> 3:59:24.160]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize
[3:59:24.160 --> 3:59:29.280]  humanity is winning. You've got to trust in the plan of God, and trust in the plan of
[3:59:29.280 --> 3:59:35.880]  God's justice. That is invincible. That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable. So don't
[3:59:35.880 --> 3:59:40.800]  trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action against
[3:59:40.800 --> 3:59:45.960]  the globalist and realize, you've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you. We will
[3:59:45.960 --> 3:59:53.000]  never back down from the globalist, and we will never surrender.
[3:59:53.000 --> 4:00:07.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
