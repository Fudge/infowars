[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:34.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.960 --> 00:41.520]  we are live ladies and gentlemen again thank you for joining us coming up in an
[00:41.520 --> 00:47.840]  hour and a half on this live Friday edition we're going to have Charlotte
[00:47.840 --> 00:51.880]  Isherby popping back in hadn't had her on over a year and a half and this will
[00:51.880 --> 00:55.920]  be our third visit where they're in the last two months because at the end of the
[00:55.920 --> 01:01.800]  show when she was on with us early last week she wanted to get into the
[01:01.800 --> 01:06.080]  Democratic and Republican parties and how they're infiltrated and controlled
[01:06.080 --> 01:11.360]  by different management groups and she wanted to get into an organization I've
[01:11.360 --> 01:19.200]  heard a lot about over the years the CNP and so we'll get more details from her
[01:19.200 --> 01:24.200]  coming up on that and how she believes they're infiltrating and controlling the
[01:24.200 --> 01:28.080]  Republican Party not just the Democratic Party so that's a 30-minute
[01:28.080 --> 01:32.600]  interview so we could get into that subject she brought up at the end of the
[01:32.600 --> 01:37.560]  show and then of course our once a week visit with Bob Chapman we're gonna have
[01:37.560 --> 01:42.240]  open phones today completely wide open phones interspersed with really
[01:42.240 --> 01:49.040]  important news in fact I've promised all week to really get in to the surveillance
[01:49.040 --> 01:52.920]  police state grid and then I had my stack sitting here and I guess somebody
[01:52.920 --> 01:57.160]  cleaned my desk off nicely I appreciate that but when you guys dig out that big
[01:57.160 --> 02:01.800]  police state stack I had you'll see a bunch of New York Times articles about
[02:01.800 --> 02:06.400]  smart cameras watching everyone or about how almost all digital cameras and
[02:06.400 --> 02:11.840]  cell phones stamp date and location on the photos you're taking all the major
[02:11.840 --> 02:16.920]  printer companies for decades put micro printing on it where the printer was
[02:16.920 --> 02:21.600]  bought and so they can track it back to you just total control guilty until
[02:21.600 --> 02:25.760]  proven innocent but then everything this government does they want to keep that
[02:25.760 --> 02:33.480]  and make that a major major secret so that is all coming up because I keep
[02:33.480 --> 02:36.960]  saying I'm gonna get to that big stack of new news dealing with the infrared
[02:36.960 --> 02:41.880]  body heat resonance ID biometric satellites that they launched to the
[02:41.880 --> 02:45.480]  name of fighting global warming now of course it comes out that's all a
[02:45.480 --> 02:53.560]  complete fraud also Paul Joseph Watson wrote two big stories yesterday dealing
[02:53.560 --> 02:59.520]  with prison cities called for for a long time by the Club of Rome United Nations
[02:59.520 --> 03:05.760]  CIA and others this is the global prison system where the entire world is a
[03:05.760 --> 03:08.820]  prison and they're getting the younger generations ready with the public
[03:08.820 --> 03:13.680]  schools the hospitals now operating like prisons guilty until proven innocent
[03:13.680 --> 03:17.800]  surveilling you getting intel on you trying to frame you not letting you
[03:17.800 --> 03:21.400]  know that you're in a law enforcement situation when the nurse is talking to
[03:21.400 --> 03:26.560]  you there's a whole bunch of different prominent world leaders including an
[03:26.560 --> 03:34.800]  IPCC leader of the UN another one Watson's discovered there's so many he
[03:34.800 --> 03:41.680]  list a whole bunch in this new article IPCC professor and head of report three
[03:41.680 --> 03:46.600]  and four some of the latest reports calls for elite warrior leadership to rule
[03:46.600 --> 03:52.720]  over eco dictatorship total police state where the SWAT teams will be the
[03:52.720 --> 03:57.520]  environmental priest this has always been their plan and of course they say
[03:57.520 --> 04:00.240]  they don't believe in God he says it's just you want to God we're gonna give
[04:00.240 --> 04:04.360]  you one and the God is the state and the state will deliver the carrot and the
[04:04.360 --> 04:09.520]  stick and it will be everything will be ruled by green police in black
[04:09.520 --> 04:15.360]  uniforms with submachine guns I mean you actual UN reports I mean this is
[04:15.360 --> 04:20.280]  Watson has it I mean you cannot make this stuff up that's what blows me away
[04:20.280 --> 04:25.520]  this is such a nightmare and I remember 16 years ago learning about the earth
[04:25.520 --> 04:33.360]  first battalion set up by the Pentagon and the weird chance they had the
[04:33.360 --> 04:37.560]  special forces do about we are the white horse death we come to kill we come to
[04:37.560 --> 04:40.960]  kill those that hurt and defile our mother earth we are the earth first
[04:40.960 --> 04:45.160]  battalion we come to bring blood we come to bring death oh white horse oh white
[04:45.160 --> 04:51.160]  horse this is official text Mars got a copy of the earth internal earth first
[04:51.160 --> 04:54.960]  battalion that's not earth first the group they're kind of named after that
[04:54.960 --> 05:01.480]  but it's it's all coming so get ready we'll be right back a very wealthy US

[07:00.760 --> 07:04.520]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[07:04.520 --> 07:08.280]  1 new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[07:08.280 --> 07:12.800]  number 2 our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[07:12.800 --> 07:17.040]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[07:17.040 --> 07:21.640]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number 3 in some areas of the
[07:21.640 --> 07:25.640]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[07:25.640 --> 07:30.000]  legislation is only compounding the problem number 4 dangerous weather is
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.720]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[07:33.720 --> 07:37.880]  power from weather related onages number 5 a solar power generator provides
[07:37.880 --> 07:41.440]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the
[07:41.440 --> 07:44.720]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest
[07:44.720 --> 07:50.040]  sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my
[07:50.040 --> 07:53.960]  solar back up dot com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go
[07:53.960 --> 08:03.880]  to my solar back up dot com or call 1-877-327-0365 he's the t-rex of political talk Alex
[08:03.880 --> 08:08.320]  Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:15.480 --> 08:23.920]  well there is almost no establishment corporate media news on the
[08:23.920 --> 08:31.360]  Maryland attacks of yesterday and almost all of the news stories about it now
[08:31.360 --> 08:38.240]  have Maryland staged terror theories develop after package explosions here
[08:38.240 --> 08:46.320]  on Friday January 7th 2011 there is almost no coverage of this and we know
[08:46.320 --> 08:50.480]  in Maryland they tried to set up this Martinez character and that even came
[08:50.480 --> 08:57.320]  out in places like salon headline FBI and trap Baltimore bomb plot suspect no
[08:57.320 --> 09:02.760]  way Antonio Martinez could have assembled the phony bomb intended to blow up
[09:02.760 --> 09:08.120]  recruitment centers defense says that was just back on December 13th of last
[09:08.120 --> 09:14.840]  year less than a month ago and we saw the same thing in Oregon and many many
[09:14.840 --> 09:21.520]  other states in the last few months with these provocative actions it isn't the
[09:21.520 --> 09:25.640]  FBI infiltrating already operating groups that they go out and find low-grade
[09:25.640 --> 09:31.640]  morons converts to Islam people that are always you know posing with their wife
[09:31.640 --> 09:37.960]  you know is in Islamic outfit with guns acting cartoonish buffoonish right out
[09:37.960 --> 09:43.560]  of a central casting same thing with Viper militia when I saw some of their
[09:43.560 --> 09:47.280]  members the way they were shooting videos the way they shot them I went on
[09:47.280 --> 09:51.920]  air seven months before it happened out of 400 plus known militias and I said
[09:51.920 --> 09:56.640]  that groups infiltrated by feds they're getting ready to set them up the
[09:56.640 --> 10:01.440]  Atari militia excuse me what a year and a half ago or so I first exposed it then
[10:01.440 --> 10:08.960]  later it came out seven months later so back in 90 2009 I warned people and then
[10:08.960 --> 10:14.960]  2010 seven months later that happened with the Atari militia good people in
[10:14.960 --> 10:22.800]  the Atari militia I pointed out on air that they had clearly been infiltrated
[10:22.800 --> 10:29.160]  and on air warned them and even had pale horse on of course another illusion to
[10:29.160 --> 10:34.080]  death and basically asked him are you a Fed because you sure act like one you
[10:34.080 --> 10:39.680]  sure look like one right out of central casting and I don't know if he's a Fed
[10:39.680 --> 10:43.120]  or not or was being manipulated by the Fed but it still sealed they ordered the
[10:43.120 --> 10:47.280]  Atari released of course a month after they'd been set up and lied about and it
[10:47.280 --> 10:51.600]  came out that they did did have an FBI informant and agent in the group of less
[10:51.600 --> 10:58.080]  than 14 and we still don't know who those agents are or who recorded the leader
[10:58.080 --> 11:02.720]  of Atari simply saying yeah of the whole country collapses and they send in
[11:02.720 --> 11:07.440]  you know UN troops to take our guns we'll have to fight back well I mean I've
[11:07.440 --> 11:11.080]  said on air that I'm not going to a FEMA camp I've said on air I would fight
[11:11.080 --> 11:16.200]  foreign occupation I mean who wouldn't whether you were Japanese Chinese
[11:16.200 --> 11:26.560]  Russian British Canadian American Mexican Iraqi for that matter and we day
[11:26.560 --> 11:32.040]  one came out and said there's a stage this is a setup release them and I said
[11:32.040 --> 11:37.200]  of course we fingered this group as clearly being manipulated by the
[11:37.200 --> 11:40.560]  statements and things coming out and that probably those making the statements
[11:40.560 --> 11:45.680]  worthy informants and then a strange thing happened in Michigan some of the
[11:45.680 --> 11:52.640]  militia groups obviously infiltrated and led by Feds got completely angry and
[11:52.640 --> 11:58.280]  said how dare Alex Jones say Atari's been infiltrated this is before it
[11:58.280 --> 12:01.560]  happened then once they got set up how dare him say they've been infiltrated
[12:01.560 --> 12:05.940]  Alex is saying all militias are feds and militias are bad so that's a straw man
[12:05.940 --> 12:11.160]  and they're counting on kind of lowest common denominator people buying into it
[12:11.160 --> 12:15.000]  I mean the same thing will happen with this but it's a good example for you to
[12:15.000 --> 12:21.520]  learn that I just said the Atari militia was good but that they were set up and
[12:21.520 --> 12:27.760]  of course I was right about that even before it happened not just when it
[12:27.760 --> 12:31.960]  happened I said they were set up and it was all a fraud and then it was
[12:31.960 --> 12:35.040]  confirmed that that was the case and the judge ordered them released and you know
[12:35.040 --> 12:42.240]  the case is now blown to bits because it was all a massive fraud and then people
[12:42.240 --> 12:46.600]  will say again that I'm saying all militias are bad or that all militias
[12:46.600 --> 12:51.440]  are run by Feds no I said there are infiltrators and anybody who tries to
[12:51.440 --> 12:58.680]  deny that anyone who tries to imply that that is not the case that's like saying
[12:58.680 --> 13:03.680]  the Sun doesn't affect weather on the planet like the UN says I mean it's just
[13:03.680 --> 13:08.480]  on its face comical there are other classic straw men I don't know why I'm
[13:08.480 --> 13:12.320]  going down this rabbit trail but it's always informative whatever rabbit trail
[13:12.320 --> 13:19.000]  we go down that people put out the straw man that I supported the flotilla attack
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.080]  that Israel did on that aid ship when we decried it and criticized it at nauseam
[13:24.080 --> 13:29.440]  or that I said that if you criticize Israel you're mentally ill and bad never
[13:29.440 --> 13:32.520]  said that people that attacked me with that
[13:32.520 --> 13:37.360]  ineffectively of course unless low-grade morons are fooled by it but that's their
[13:37.360 --> 13:42.280]  lot life I'm sad for them they weren't gifted with any intellect the very videos
[13:42.280 --> 13:47.480]  they use is where I say I don't say you're an idiot if you criticize Israel I
[13:47.480 --> 13:53.160]  say you're an idiot if you say that I work for Israel or that I work for the
[13:53.160 --> 13:59.120]  Vatican or the Masons or anybody else so that's how people operate and you've
[13:59.120 --> 14:04.520]  got to know in most of these cases these people are bought and paid for I mean
[14:04.520 --> 14:09.280]  more and more I analyze it and look at it the tactics I see are exactly what
[14:09.280 --> 14:15.160]  confirmed Feds do and exactly what the mainstream media does with straw man
[14:15.160 --> 14:20.840]  operations but the way I went down that rabbit trail was pointing out that
[14:20.840 --> 14:28.480]  you're gonna see more and more staged attacks but if the staged attack has
[14:28.480 --> 14:33.560]  too many whistleblowers on the inside they will pull back from it and then
[14:33.560 --> 14:39.200]  we'll stop hyping it and that's the real mark of this what we see going on in
[14:39.200 --> 14:44.720]  Maryland with the two packages that blew up at state offices that were being
[14:44.720 --> 14:49.160]  sorted on their way reportedly to the governor's office we're now seeing almost
[14:49.160 --> 14:54.440]  no news on this and they're not hyping it and fear mongering now that means one
[14:54.440 --> 14:59.760]  of two things it could be a few other things but two big things that that the
[14:59.760 --> 15:05.040]  probability studies and research shows 90% chance it's one of those two things
[15:05.040 --> 15:11.720]  just to give you a dead reckoning number a these were real terror attacks because
[15:11.720 --> 15:20.800]  the rule of thumb is real terror attacks are not hyped are not promoted or they
[15:20.800 --> 15:27.080]  had provocateurs in there running this and a good FBI agent or state police or
[15:27.080 --> 15:33.360]  others have recorded it and have tried to release it and we saw that in 93 with
[15:33.360 --> 15:37.040]  the first World Trade Center attack where their own informant knew they were
[15:37.040 --> 15:40.680]  setting him up so he recorded the FBI telling him no go ahead with the bombing
[15:40.680 --> 15:43.760]  well you said it was going to be inert then you said build a real one then you
[15:43.760 --> 15:47.240]  said a fake detonator now it's a real detonator now you're gonna go ahead with
[15:47.240 --> 15:53.840]  it no and then that guy the day it happened came out with the tapes did a
[15:53.840 --> 15:58.320]  press conference and hit CBS News New York Times and a bunch of other news and
[15:58.320 --> 16:02.400]  the feds just totally backed off and just you heard nothing about World Trade
[16:02.400 --> 16:06.720]  Center attack after that and they went on to start Waco as a smoke screen for it
[16:06.720 --> 16:16.560]  a few months later again I've studied these people I know how they operate and
[16:16.560 --> 16:21.760]  so this whole Maryland situation is very very suspicious obviously we'll
[16:21.760 --> 16:26.960]  continue to watch it now I'll tell you what else is suspicious in this larger
[16:26.960 --> 16:35.080]  equation and that is murdered Bush aid was an expert in chemical biological and
[16:35.080 --> 16:41.160]  cyber warfare had highest security clearances I mean this guy ran everything
[16:41.160 --> 16:48.080]  Maryland DC Amtrak chairman CEO mothers of drunk driving chairman Vietnam
[16:48.080 --> 16:53.560]  Veterans Memorial president CEO Vietnam Children's Fund I mean I don't have an
[16:53.560 --> 17:01.280]  hour to read all this West Point special ops from day one in the early 60s or
[17:01.280 --> 17:10.360]  mid 60s assigned to the defense secretary you know Harvard Cambridge systems
[17:10.360 --> 17:15.760]  analyst that's ran corporation strategic programs office of secretary of
[17:15.760 --> 17:24.360]  defense I mean this is this is right out of West Point in 67 just everything he
[17:24.360 --> 17:31.160]  ran the nuclear Nike Hercules missile sites it just this guy was a master go
[17:31.160 --> 17:37.360]  for he was a superclass he was part of the 6,000 super gophers and they killed
[17:37.360 --> 17:48.080]  him dead in a hammer in fact going over this it looks like it looks like he
[17:48.080 --> 17:52.840]  might be in a top thousand gophers or even more one of those quiet guys you
[17:52.840 --> 17:55.600]  really don't hear a lot about murdered Bush aid was expert in chemical
[17:55.600 --> 17:59.720]  biological and cyber warfare had highest security clearances this is from
[17:59.720 --> 18:03.640]  krypton.org we've got it up at info wars.com and prison planet.com and they
[18:03.640 --> 18:09.400]  got a good boil down here I mean but this guy is just the master spook and then
[18:09.400 --> 18:13.120]  now he's running around to shovel with a shoe off and no coat and freezing
[18:13.120 --> 18:19.400]  weather for two days and then and then and then he's found dead in a landfill
[18:19.400 --> 18:28.680]  and they've had people even on Fox News experts pull up the quote here where a
[18:28.680 --> 18:33.320]  different experts retired lieutenant general McInery on Fox News said it had
[18:33.320 --> 18:40.320]  to be a professional hit job meanwhile the big green light here is that the
[18:40.320 --> 18:50.960]  Delaware that the Delaware police and others are behaving like he's bad and
[18:50.960 --> 18:55.680]  he was going to fire bomb his neighbor I mean you've got this super spook with
[18:55.680 --> 19:00.200]  his hands in everything a master controller so that people like George
[19:00.200 --> 19:04.960]  Bush and Bill Clinton and people could go off and you know play golf that you
[19:04.960 --> 19:09.080]  this is a guy in the command seat at many levels I mean he's just got his
[19:09.080 --> 19:15.680]  fingers in literally everything the pedigree of a super ran corporation
[19:15.680 --> 19:26.720]  operative here and it's got mind control written all over it again just like the

[24:19.520 --> 24:23.240]  story from cryptum.org is up on info wars.com if you want to go over it it is
[24:23.240 --> 24:31.200]  long and lengthy dealing with the bush-aid John Jack Wheeler inside a
[24:31.200 --> 24:36.840]  Williamton office building the day before he died bizarre final days and
[24:36.840 --> 24:42.960]  hours of a John P. Wheeler the third and the retired major general saying it had
[24:42.960 --> 24:47.560]  to be a professional hit the police claiming he was planting bombs in his
[24:47.560 --> 24:54.120]  neighbor's house just totally crazy and then we get all these other reports now
[24:54.120 --> 24:59.320]  in Maryland two incendiary packages caused security scare across Maryland it
[24:59.320 --> 25:03.240]  was a tense afternoon across the region over two packages one addressed a
[25:03.240 --> 25:07.840]  governor Martin O'Malley ignited inside two state office buildings they showed
[25:07.840 --> 25:12.240]  up 20 miles apart one in Hanover and other in Annapolis just a few feet from
[25:12.240 --> 25:18.320]  the State House and they just don't have more information and they're not
[25:18.320 --> 25:23.120]  hyping it which is very very suspicious because when they stage something they
[25:23.120 --> 25:27.160]  hyped the living daylights out of it unless they know their staged event has
[25:27.160 --> 25:30.960]  been compromised I mean when you see a staged event they're ready in minutes
[25:30.960 --> 25:34.920]  minutes after the underwear bomber on Christmas Day Chertoff was on the news
[25:34.920 --> 25:41.200]  saying I got body scanners for you now we're lucky and Janet Napolitano oh we
[25:41.200 --> 25:44.640]  we're gonna order these today they ordered them a year before takes time to
[25:44.640 --> 25:48.840]  build them get them in place oh we're putting these in just cuz of this just
[25:48.840 --> 25:54.840]  like 40,000 US troops 18,000 British troops mashing in and around Afghanistan
[25:54.840 --> 25:59.320]  two carrier attack fleets Bush according to Newsweek signs the attack order to go
[25:59.320 --> 26:05.760]  after Afghanistan in the next week on September 10th has Jeb Bush court according
[26:05.760 --> 26:10.520]  to Associated Press declare martial law in Florida September 9th but not
[26:10.520 --> 26:14.080]  publicly issue it they planned on probably taking out the capital and going
[26:14.080 --> 26:20.360]  into full-bore martial law but the happy hooligans out of the Dakotas signed
[26:20.360 --> 26:24.360]  of Virginia that day did not follow orders and fired to aim nines according
[26:24.360 --> 26:29.240]  to our insiders and later a lot of this did leak into the flight over
[26:29.240 --> 26:34.880]  Pennsylvania some speculate it was going at Building 7 though that's why they had
[26:34.880 --> 26:37.680]  to go ahead and blow it up later in the day regardless because it was wired and
[26:37.680 --> 26:42.320]  ready here's some of the other crazy news I will get to after I take a bunch
[26:42.320 --> 26:53.640]  of calls the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231-8259-9231 the

[27:28.640 --> 27:35.440]  cover today but I've been noticing a degrading in the sound quality on the
[27:35.440 --> 27:39.320]  Sunday show phone calls and it's also that people have worse and worse cell
[27:39.320 --> 27:43.260]  phones but also we noticed that we think the quality is going down on the cheap
[27:43.260 --> 27:48.920]  1-800 service we have that's inexpensive and I only take calls in my studio on
[27:48.920 --> 27:53.480]  Sundays generally and I've just noticed the calls aren't as clean as when we
[27:53.480 --> 27:58.960]  take them on our local 512 number and so we're moving away from that number and
[27:58.960 --> 28:03.080]  testing a few new numbers here today and so this will be a first-time caller
[28:03.080 --> 28:09.520]  line first-time caller line we're testing this new phone line system out

[33:07.200 --> 33:11.200]  Waging War on Corruption
[33:11.200 --> 33:19.200]  it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War
[33:24.200 --> 33:31.400]  it is Friday seventh day of the new year thank you for joining us how to do
[33:31.400 --> 33:35.600]  justice to this article too much fluoride and water government says high
[33:35.600 --> 33:40.280]  levels causing spots on teeth recommended limit to be lowered this is
[33:40.280 --> 33:45.480]  really old news six years ago the American Dental Association was forced
[33:45.480 --> 33:49.560]  because of just the hundreds and hundreds of confirmed studies to start
[33:49.560 --> 33:53.480]  telling parents to not have their under six year olds brush their teeth with
[33:53.480 --> 33:56.720]  fluoride toothpaste of course you still go to the store and it's fluoride
[33:56.720 --> 34:01.480]  toothpaste for kids everywhere because it is causing massive dental
[34:01.480 --> 34:06.560]  fluorosis and also fracturing of the teeth now all the other major studies
[34:06.560 --> 34:10.720]  also show at least a doubling in bone cancer in boys it can be even higher for
[34:10.720 --> 34:19.000]  some reason it also shows early onset of heart disease because it starts a
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.520]  calcification process of the arteries and veins but mainly arteries it also of
[34:24.520 --> 34:31.800]  course retards growth reduces IQ I mean the list goes on and on and they know
[34:31.800 --> 34:37.440]  that it causes an earlier onset of different types of arthritis massive
[34:37.440 --> 34:41.720]  calcification most of it precipitates out in the bones and that's on Alex Jones
[34:41.720 --> 34:48.880]  that's medical doctors brain surgeons top toxicologist endocrinologist bone
[34:48.880 --> 34:56.640]  doctors I mean I've had them all on over 90% in 2000 and then in 2005 of the
[34:56.640 --> 35:05.720]  union members toxicologist doctors and others working for the EPA and then
[35:05.720 --> 35:11.880]  another action the FDA have sent letters to Congress and testified that it's
[35:11.880 --> 35:19.360]  total deadly poison and just earlier last year the same groups came out and
[35:19.360 --> 35:24.840]  said please take it out the cancer increases is an absolute fact take it
[35:24.840 --> 35:33.720]  out and their answer is just to laugh at everybody Marge did you hear that they
[35:33.720 --> 35:37.280]  said sodium fluoride isn't good for us and then if that doesn't freak you out
[35:37.280 --> 35:43.560]  in the rocks that they get most of sodium fluoride from the phosphate mines
[35:43.560 --> 35:47.800]  where they get the phosphate for the fertilizer this is the byproduct that
[35:47.800 --> 35:51.480]  they're not allowed under law though they violate that as well to dump on the
[35:51.480 --> 35:57.040]  crops they like to put it on grass grass fertilizer grass fertilizer it says
[35:57.040 --> 36:00.120]  don't use for food crops that's because it's what they're putting their water
[36:00.120 --> 36:06.720]  basically the same thing and it's got mercury lead radium uranium a whole
[36:06.720 --> 36:12.000]  bunch of other types of isotopes and you drink that okay they're putting
[36:12.000 --> 36:16.000]  everything you can imagine in your water it's not just fluoride that's the
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.040]  cover name it's the biggest sickest joke you know I was just reading some more
[36:21.040 --> 36:25.000]  big mainline studies out of major medical center one up in Dallas major
[36:25.000 --> 36:31.040]  universities just yesterday where they've known for decades that high fructose
[36:31.040 --> 36:37.280]  corn syrup in the first five years of life when you're forming your brain so
[36:37.280 --> 36:42.160]  many other things also it decides how many fat cells you get and it gears the
[36:42.160 --> 36:46.080]  fat cells and so that's another reason they've done studies on countries where
[36:46.080 --> 36:50.520]  people eat just as unhealthy overall calorie diets as Americans but they're
[36:50.520 --> 36:54.960]  not as overweight because when you drink all this and eat all this high fructose
[36:54.960 --> 36:57.440]  corn syrup and now look at the baby formulas most of them are over half
[36:57.440 --> 37:03.360]  high fructose corn syrup it literally grows your fat cells it supercharges
[37:03.360 --> 37:10.160]  them it supercharges them now I said I'd take your call see I'm already going
[37:10.160 --> 37:14.880]  off down another rabbit trail but you know this information you want to warn
[37:14.880 --> 37:22.680]  people and it's just incredible it's absolutely amazing and then there's
[37:22.680 --> 37:27.680]  the other issues of how they grow the corn how they do spray the toxic
[37:27.680 --> 37:32.600]  fertilizer on it and so that's why they found right at half of major corn syrup
[37:32.600 --> 37:35.560]  products that's Washington Post three years ago you can pull up that headline
[37:35.560 --> 37:42.720]  major study of corn syrup products have high levels of lead in them also lower
[37:42.720 --> 37:47.000]  numbers have mercury you just pull that up for yourself right now corn syrup lead
[37:47.000 --> 37:52.480]  corn syrup mercury so there's also that it's also getting toxic waste in it see
[37:52.480 --> 37:56.600]  they take the byproducts of the oil industry all the stuff they can't get
[37:56.600 --> 38:01.880]  rid of that's why I do want to go away from oil oh oil's not good it's allowed
[38:01.880 --> 38:06.000]  us to do so much of what we've done and it's a it's a wonder product out of the
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.840]  earth but it's not good what they do the toxic waste and it's not good to be
[38:09.840 --> 38:13.480]  using billions of barrels a month globally of it because they take all the
[38:13.480 --> 38:16.840]  stuff they can't use from the crude oil and they put it into distillates the
[38:16.840 --> 38:22.840]  products the haircare products the soaps the the water just just everything and
[38:22.840 --> 38:29.360]  it's toxic it's toxic they don't want to have to store that or get rid of it so
[38:29.360 --> 38:34.480]  they make it a product they make it a product and then you say well why would
[38:34.480 --> 38:38.520]  they do something cold-blooded like that it's not just profit it's eugenics
[38:38.520 --> 38:45.000]  ladies and gentlemen it's sick they could at least dump it in the ocean and
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.560]  then sure you'd get it back in the food chain through the fish but not as bad as
[38:48.560 --> 38:52.960]  putting it directly into your water so what an incredible article I'll cover
[38:52.960 --> 38:58.360]  that exclusively a little bit in the next hour because I want to go over all
[38:58.360 --> 39:03.240]  this properly but what they don't tell you here is they're recommending lowering
[39:03.240 --> 39:12.080]  it from 0.7 to 1.2 yeah that's the standard now from 0.7 part per million
[39:12.080 --> 39:18.240]  as high as 1.2 some places in the USF 0.4 I mean you do 0.1 massive IQ
[39:18.240 --> 39:22.600]  reduction imagine three times that or four times that to lowering it to an
[39:22.600 --> 39:26.720]  even lower level because you're getting too much in the toothpaste and in the
[39:26.720 --> 39:30.000]  water even according to them well what about all the foods they add it to I
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  mean do you know what they put in the food sometimes they've got hundreds of
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.680]  times this in the food I mean that's why the public is a bunch of brain damaged
[39:38.680 --> 39:44.160]  zombies you wonder why Americans can't get excited or get upset or get motivated
[39:44.160 --> 39:48.240]  why we're so obese why there's record numbers of women with thyroid dysfunction
[39:48.240 --> 39:52.080]  every time fluoride fluoride fluoride fluoride that's mainline medical
[39:52.080 --> 39:56.640]  literature I can't go to the gym or be in a restaurant or listen to women on
[39:56.640 --> 40:05.720]  talk radio or talk to women I know 25 30 40 years old hair falling out thyroid for
[40:05.720 --> 40:09.080]  some reason I've had medical doctors on they've gone over the reasons I don't
[40:09.080 --> 40:13.680]  understand it women absorb it more to their thyroid than men some things hurt
[40:13.680 --> 40:16.600]  men worse than that hurts women some things hurt women worse than it hurts
[40:16.600 --> 40:23.280]  men I mean this is devastating us and here we know that even the American
[40:23.280 --> 40:27.240]  Mental Association covered their hind in quietly they still have the fluoride for
[40:27.240 --> 40:31.080]  the kids in schools and push it but they did put the little proviso in oh by the
[40:31.080 --> 40:35.400]  way we have a recommendation if you can find it hidden officially don't do this
[40:35.400 --> 40:39.720]  but here here kids take it take it take it because the phosphate industry and
[40:39.720 --> 40:44.720]  the rest of them and the coal industry and the rest of them are just funding
[40:44.720 --> 40:50.520]  all of this okay I'm done I said I'll take your calls let's so we're gonna go
[40:50.520 --> 40:56.600]  to the Genesis phone system here in just a moment suddenly my mouse my
[40:56.600 --> 41:02.200]  wireless mouse is not working so I guess I'll have to go to the Genesis phone
[41:02.200 --> 41:05.280]  system because that's the only phone system I could see up in front of me and
[41:05.280 --> 41:09.640]  then we'll test out after the break when I'm able to get this working our phone
[41:09.640 --> 41:16.480]  system with the first-time callers let's go ahead and take a phone call from
[41:16.480 --> 41:21.640]  Chuck in Oklahoma Chuck you're on the air Alex has gone man I sure appreciate
[41:21.640 --> 41:26.040]  what you're doing for so I appreciate you I'm very excited that I'm starting to
[41:26.040 --> 41:30.240]  see some sanity the government's now saying too much fluoride and water they
[41:30.240 --> 41:34.200]  don't tell you also in food and toothpaste and Google violates laws the
[41:34.200 --> 41:38.600]  police are saying all over the world so we're starting to see a little positive
[41:38.600 --> 41:42.040]  movement here go ahead you know I think it's about time we start seeing a little
[41:42.040 --> 41:45.880]  positive movement and I just don't even know how it even came to this I mean
[41:45.880 --> 41:50.240]  the idea of it all putting fluoride into our water I mean they try to say oh
[41:50.240 --> 41:53.440]  itself to keep our teeth wide or whatever I mean I thought that's why we
[41:53.440 --> 41:57.600]  had a deal insurance I thought that's why we went and paid you know our $20 copays
[41:57.600 --> 42:00.880]  to get our teeth wide the government doesn't care about corn syrup and
[42:00.880 --> 42:04.000]  things that they know are really bad they don't care about our safety it's all
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.560]  about the excuse to force things into our body and now they admit that they're
[42:08.560 --> 42:13.000]  saying oh we want to put statins in the drugs for kids we want to put statins in
[42:13.000 --> 42:17.560]  the water and lithium in the water I mean we can see what they're doing yeah I
[42:17.560 --> 42:21.080]  think it's just absolutely crazy I don't even know how it's even come to this I
[42:21.080 --> 42:24.880]  mean I think it's a really ballsy move just by the government and everybody
[42:24.880 --> 42:30.320]  that's trying to well here's another hoods befilled move came out this week
[42:30.320 --> 42:34.720]  EPA leak documents they knew this pesticide was wiping bees out and they
[42:34.720 --> 42:38.760]  said go ahead and use it but don't tell anybody they know they're killing the
[42:38.760 --> 42:45.080]  earth but then they give us fake ways to help the earth so they get more power I
[42:45.080 --> 42:49.680]  mean we've got birds falling out of the sky we've got green algae falling on
[42:49.680 --> 42:54.000]  people in China I mean what are they exactly trying to do I mean they don't
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.680]  think that now had thousands of doves die with green dripping out of their
[42:59.680 --> 43:05.640]  beaks in Italy yeah I mean and what what kind of you know gets me thinking a
[43:05.640 --> 43:09.960]  little bit is you know you see how they can actually control you know volcanoes
[43:09.960 --> 43:13.880]  erupting and stuff like that you know a lot of these things that happen you know
[43:13.880 --> 43:17.720]  with killing a lot of wildlife that I noticed is around volcanoes when a lot
[43:17.720 --> 43:22.360]  of these you know poisonous gases infuse that fumigate from whatever these
[43:22.360 --> 43:26.120]  volcanoes and a lot of wildlife starts dying off I mean well there is a big
[43:26.120 --> 43:30.560]  fault line where all these birds are dying and over by Arkansas and that area
[43:30.560 --> 43:34.200]  where four states come together but there's no active volcanoes are off
[43:34.200 --> 43:38.560]  gassing going on and they now are trying to officially say that fireworks made
[43:38.560 --> 43:44.040]  5,000 birds fly into each other and liquefy their insides which is
[43:44.040 --> 43:49.440]  completely impossible and insane yeah that is completely insane I think the
[43:49.440 --> 43:52.120]  last thing a bird would do as soon as they see fireworks would probably go the
[43:52.120 --> 43:56.440]  opposite way well I mean if birds ran into each other I've seen birds fly in
[43:56.440 --> 44:01.160]  to glass windows on houses they're not pulverized inside break their neck I've
[44:01.160 --> 44:06.440]  shot hundreds of birds with a shotgun and eating them and let me tell you in
[44:06.440 --> 44:09.920]  fact I got emails about this folks that haven't dove or quail hunted don't know
[44:09.920 --> 44:14.040]  this you can butcher them in about 10 seconds or the only meat that's good on
[44:14.040 --> 44:19.480]  them maybe with bigger quail their legs but all you do is just reach in and rip
[44:19.480 --> 44:23.960]  the breast right off pull the feathers off and about another 10 seconds and have
[44:23.960 --> 44:30.640]  a plastic baggie with the marinade sauce that you're gonna baste it in you throw
[44:30.640 --> 44:33.920]  it into the bag while you're out hunting for a few hours when you get back to the
[44:33.920 --> 44:38.280]  house it's ready to cook but but I'll assure you folks I've shot birds with
[44:38.280 --> 44:43.880]  shotguns they're not pulverized the BB shoot little clean holes through them
[44:43.880 --> 44:48.960]  and there's almost no blood maybe their lungs will pump a little bit of blood up
[44:48.960 --> 44:52.440]  there'll be a little drop of blood coming out their beak that's it I've
[44:52.440 --> 44:58.280]  shot hundreds and hundreds of birds my dad's probably shot thousands anybody
[44:58.280 --> 45:03.560]  who's been bird hunting knows this it is ridiculous I appreciate your call good
[45:03.560 --> 45:08.880]  to hear from you Chuck let's take a phone call off our new phone line system and
[45:08.880 --> 45:13.960]  test it out let's talk to RJ in Texas RJ you're on the ear Alex what's up
[45:13.960 --> 45:18.520]  buddy good good to hear from you good how you done real quick anyway I just
[45:18.520 --> 45:23.400]  moved here to Austin and I don't really want to put any more money in the
[45:23.400 --> 45:30.200]  banksters hands I was wondering if you could recommend a good local bank could
[45:30.200 --> 45:34.880]  I recommend what specifically a good local bank small bank you know not in
[45:34.880 --> 45:37.560]  control the banksters sorry I was distracted they were fixing some
[45:37.560 --> 45:41.760]  equipment in here and have the door open I couldn't hear you I'd have to
[45:41.760 --> 45:49.400]  research local banks myself in your area RJ you know I don't really like to give
[45:49.400 --> 45:54.480]  people financial advice because even if it looks like good advice today you know
[45:54.480 --> 45:58.800]  the bank might go under tomorrow even if it's got some great local rating but
[45:58.800 --> 46:04.760]  you can pull up type in Texas you know top Texas rated banks and you'll see
[46:04.760 --> 46:08.600]  which ones have the biggest reserves which ones are rated having the best
[46:08.600 --> 46:13.240]  customer service and I would look at a wide range I personally think you know
[46:13.240 --> 46:20.600]  old local credit unions are great things like that but I mean I specifically RJ
[46:20.600 --> 46:25.680]  don't like to give people that you know individual advice and I was just trying
[46:25.680 --> 46:30.680]  my luck anyway can I get a plug from my site sure go ahead wondering glass studio
[46:30.680 --> 46:35.720]  calm alright RJ good to hear from you let's talk to Josh in Ohio Josh you're
[46:35.720 --> 46:40.840]  on the air hey Alex it's a pleasure to talk to you good to talk to you sir what's
[46:40.840 --> 46:47.120]  on your mind well actually I just wanted to kind of touch base with you and
[46:47.120 --> 46:52.040]  and let you know here in Ohio I've been speaking with people for about the last
[46:52.040 --> 46:57.880]  10 years and you know when I first started out everybody just laughed at
[46:57.880 --> 47:04.080]  me left and right and you know lately I talked to a lot of people at my job you
[47:04.080 --> 47:09.640]  know and even interact with different aspects of the government and police and
[47:09.640 --> 47:15.040]  what not and I tell you a lot of people are really starting to wake up and
[47:15.040 --> 47:19.080]  they're starting to notice well you know that's my one of my biggest
[47:19.080 --> 47:25.000]  frustrations is that I know people are waking up in mass because I'm well known
[47:25.000 --> 47:30.800]  and I go out on the street and so I can get kind of my own poll in different
[47:30.800 --> 47:34.760]  parts of the country and world on what number of people are awake and involved
[47:34.760 --> 47:41.200]  and I mean it's got to be 20% of people in Austin I walk by now come up to me I
[47:41.200 --> 47:45.840]  mean I'm or more sometimes I mean I can almost not even get through the day and
[47:45.840 --> 47:50.080]  function sometimes so many people I'll be walking my dog or walking with my kids
[47:50.080 --> 47:54.360]  around the neighborhood cars are stopping other parts of the country 10%
[47:54.360 --> 48:00.440]  probably stop other other parts of the world now 10% come over I mean it's
[48:00.440 --> 48:06.640]  getting really ridiculous and imagine how many other people are awake but just
[48:06.640 --> 48:12.200]  leave me alone or or know about the New World Order but don't know who I am I
[48:12.200 --> 48:17.560]  mean it's it's it's it's incredible and my frustration is though people who
[48:17.560 --> 48:21.960]  aren't prominent who aren't on TV and radio and doing all these interviews and
[48:21.960 --> 48:25.800]  things like I am or who aren't in films including some Hollywood films I've been
[48:25.800 --> 48:31.760]  in or the early Austin films but you know major film releases they don't have
[48:31.760 --> 48:36.760]  that interaction that's why we sell the t-shirts it's all symbiotic it funds the
[48:36.760 --> 48:42.440]  operation but it's also wearing your colors getting out of the fear I mean and
[48:42.440 --> 48:48.320]  if you don't want to wear an Alex Jones info wars.com shirt go buy a Ron Paul
[48:48.320 --> 48:56.080]  shirt or a campaign for liberty I mean you will be mobbed you will have folks you
[48:56.080 --> 49:02.160]  know if you're a drinker buy your drinks I mean it's ridiculous I talk to people
[49:02.160 --> 49:07.080]  all the time who wear info wars.com shirts and you know men have women
[49:07.080 --> 49:10.600]  coming up to them women have men coming up to them you know they're meeting
[49:10.600 --> 49:16.160]  people at church folks are coming over people get dinner bought for them drinks
[49:16.160 --> 49:21.680]  bought for them I mean it we need to have this community and it doesn't mean
[49:21.680 --> 49:25.840]  you know that we're all even on the same page except that we want more liberty
[49:25.840 --> 49:29.840]  and know we're going in the wrong direction I mean it is crazy Josh how
[49:29.840 --> 49:35.760]  awake people are getting. It's really exciting and I think you you know you
[49:35.760 --> 49:40.080]  really hit it on the head there when you said that we just need to interact more
[49:40.080 --> 49:45.840]  and people need to stop being so afraid to express their opinions and just come
[49:45.840 --> 49:51.160]  together more like you said if we disagree then you know we can agree to
[49:51.160 --> 49:58.400]  disagree so it's you know it's it's exciting I think. Absolutely folks you
[49:58.400 --> 50:02.600]  can experience what I experienced at least to some level people will still
[50:02.600 --> 50:05.640]  be more timid if you're wearing a t-shirt because they don't know who you are
[50:05.640 --> 50:09.240]  people feel like they really know me because they spend I guess you do I
[50:09.240 --> 50:12.360]  mean you spend more time with me if you're a regular looser than I've
[50:12.360 --> 50:16.960]  probably spent with my wife and children a lot of days and so you do know me and
[50:16.960 --> 50:22.440]  so people come up as if they know me because they do but you'll have I'd
[50:22.440 --> 50:28.680]  say 30% of what I get again that's a dead reckoning 20 30 I don't know maybe
[50:28.680 --> 50:33.200]  more if you're wearing a bold info wars.com shirt I mean I want you to
[50:33.200 --> 50:38.720]  experience this folks in fact we should probably put out a Ron Paul 2012 t-shirt
[50:38.720 --> 50:44.080]  and promote it you know draft Ron Paul 2012 so folks can get that going in fact
[50:44.080 --> 50:46.720]  I'm gonna announce it now I'm gonna have it designed today it'll be up by tomorrow
[50:46.720 --> 50:50.720]  a few weeks they'll be in we're gonna put out a draft Ron Paul 2012 shirt and
[50:50.720 --> 50:54.000]  that's another good thing wear your colors wear them loud wear them proud

[52:13.480 --> 52:17.560]  new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[52:17.560 --> 52:21.840]  It means all the world under their control. The United Nations would take
[52:21.840 --> 52:26.960]  over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire
[52:26.960 --> 52:30.600]  chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for
[52:30.600 --> 52:34.920]  centuries to establish an oppressive world government. I believe first of all
[52:34.920 --> 52:38.440]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global

[52:42.480 --> 52:46.640]  going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else and I got news for

[53:02.920 --> 53:06.640]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you
[53:06.640 --> 53:10.240]  know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[53:10.240 --> 53:13.960]  silver or gold? It's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in
[53:13.960 --> 53:17.840]  this country and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at
[53:17.840 --> 53:21.240]  Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid
[53:21.240 --> 53:26.800]  seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of
[53:26.800 --> 53:30.540]  nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best part. These
[53:30.540 --> 53:34.200]  seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get
[53:34.200 --> 53:38.280]  enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at
[53:38.280 --> 53:46.400]  survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[53:46.400 --> 53:54.720]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the
[53:54.720 --> 54:00.440]  ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[54:00.440 --> 54:16.440]  Day after day. Alone on a hill. The man with the foolish green is keeping perfectly still.
[54:16.440 --> 54:21.200]  Let's continue with your phone calls. Let's take a call off of the Genesis
[54:21.200 --> 54:25.680]  phone lines then we'll go back to the first-time callers that called 877-789
[54:25.680 --> 54:30.200]  Alex, the new number we're testing on today. Let's go ahead and talk to Chuck
[54:30.200 --> 54:35.520]  in Oklahoma. You're on the air. Thanks for holding Chuck. Oh, where I talked to Chuck.
[54:35.520 --> 54:42.000]  That's right. Jonathan in Kansas. Go ahead. Yes, Alex. There's three big stories I
[54:42.000 --> 54:47.680]  have for you and one of them is it's on YouTube now. It was off a, it was a clip
[54:47.680 --> 54:53.760]  taken off of Anderson Cooper's show and it's called 5200 Pentagon employees
[54:53.760 --> 54:59.400]  purchased child pornography and it's big if he's in Anderson Cooper was saying
[54:59.400 --> 55:04.200]  that nobody was getting charged, nobody was talking, was gonna get in trouble
[55:04.200 --> 55:10.440]  about it and you can type in 5200 Pentagon employees. Just that. I remember that came
[55:10.440 --> 55:14.400]  out. I mean that comes out all the time. I have to tell you I'm very suspicious of
[55:14.400 --> 55:19.720]  all of that because trillions have been stolen from the Pentagon so there's a
[55:19.720 --> 55:26.880]  process now of trying to blackmail lower level people and they're also killing
[55:26.880 --> 55:30.400]  quite a few people as folks have been noticing to cover up the trillions and
[55:30.400 --> 55:34.000]  trillions and trillions that are missing that make made-off look like a
[55:34.000 --> 55:39.360]  choir boy and I'm not doubting that that's going on. I would just like to
[55:39.360 --> 55:41.880]  see Anderson Cooper cover Dinecore and Halliburton when it was even in the
[55:41.880 --> 55:46.120]  Chicago Tribune running giant kidnapping rings. I mean they don't seem to ever get
[55:46.120 --> 55:50.600]  into the hardcore bonafide stuff. You know, they'll just claim that something's
[55:50.600 --> 55:54.360]  going on and that nothing's being done and then that's held over the Pentagon
[55:54.360 --> 55:59.520]  personnel's head and then they can claim, oh this was on your network. It was also
[55:59.520 --> 56:04.680]  in the news yesterday that the government is telling all federal
[56:04.680 --> 56:09.240]  employees to spy on each other, you know, to make sure that everyone's loyal and
[56:09.240 --> 56:12.880]  that people aren't giving stuff to WikiLeaks. So they're just using this
[56:12.880 --> 56:19.800]  as a secret police system. So as above so below, as the ancients would say, it's
[56:19.800 --> 56:24.340]  just as governments become more criminal, they start spying on everybody and it's
[56:24.340 --> 56:29.440]  not good for anyone but the tiny, tiny elite at the top. So I will check out
[56:29.440 --> 56:35.800]  that Anderson Cooper video. What's the other news? That there's a new mass grave
[56:35.800 --> 56:40.480]  that was found in Austria a few days ago and you can just type into the Google
[56:40.480 --> 56:45.760]  News Austrian mass grave and that's the first thing that comes up. And the last
[56:45.760 --> 56:50.760]  thing I have to say is that China released its new pictures of its new
[56:50.760 --> 56:55.920]  stealth spider and it looks nearly identical to the F-22 Raptor. So I'm
[56:55.920 --> 56:59.560]  speaking that Lockheed Martin might have sold some of the technology. They
[56:59.560 --> 57:05.760]  absolutely Laurel Hughes in the mid 90s with Clinton and that's why the
[57:05.760 --> 57:10.200]  Republicans wouldn't go after Clinton for anything truly substantive. They had to
[57:10.200 --> 57:14.680]  go after him for sex because that was compartmentalized to only Clinton. See
[57:14.680 --> 57:18.880]  politicians can't ever persecute each other or go on witch hunts against each
[57:18.880 --> 57:22.600]  other for political gain on any real issue because they're all involved in
[57:22.600 --> 57:27.680]  or the leadership is. They're all got their hands dirty. So Ken Starr and
[57:27.680 --> 57:32.320]  others were linked to the Chinese sellout and then that little ruse where
[57:32.320 --> 57:38.800]  the surveillance AWAC got forced down in China when Bush first got in office and
[57:38.800 --> 57:45.040]  then the crew didn't punch the button that wipes the computers or and they
[57:45.040 --> 57:49.760]  also have an acid bath. Others system they're supposed to activate. They
[57:49.760 --> 57:53.520]  didn't do it though. It takes one second. That was another cover up to
[57:53.520 --> 58:00.200]  deliver all of that stuff to him. And I have seen the reports. I have seen the
[58:00.200 --> 58:04.360]  new Chinese fighter and it's a complete knockoff. Now there's somebody else who
[58:04.360 --> 58:09.680]  may have sold it. You know who the number one culprit of selling US secrets to
[58:09.680 --> 58:14.840]  China predominantly but also to the Saudi Arabians and Russians. You know who's
[58:14.840 --> 58:18.800]  been caught over and over again giving all our secrets to other countries and
[58:18.800 --> 58:23.400]  that's Israel. You can just type in Israel,
[58:23.400 --> 58:29.400]  transfer technology, US technology to China. I mean it's constant. So it's
[58:29.400 --> 58:32.760]  all crooked as a Merrill of Snakes. Any other articles? You always call them a
[58:32.760 --> 58:37.200]  good stuff Jonathan. Yeah well I just wanted to say Yuri Besmanov
[58:37.200 --> 58:42.320]  revealed that Ford actually built. Stay there. Stay there. The GCN radio network

[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:12.720]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:20.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas. Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:32.720]  If you just joined us I'm going to continue to take calls from about 15 after
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.720]  and then I'm going to plunge into the news including some incredibly positive
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:42.720]  news. The government now admitting that fluoride is really hurting people. This
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.720]  is just incredible. But that's because we force their hand. The vast majority of
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.720]  government scientists are on record and they always say the same thing. I didn't
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:56.720]  believe it until I looked at it. It's deadly. I can't believe they did this. So
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:01.720]  incredible that's coming up. Jonathan in Kansas, you were finishing up a point with
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:06.720]  news items that you were raising for us. Yes, well I wanted to say that Yuri
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:12.720]  Bezmanoff in the 80s revealed that Ford actually built trucks and actual
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.720]  factories for military trucks in the Soviet Union. Yeah, that was Arm and Hammer
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:22.720]  and others. Look, Ford, General Motors right through World War II were making
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.720]  money off the German machine. That was in congressional hearings. Our Ford
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:34.720]  trucks, Chevy trucks, paid for with US tax money were built in Russia. They got
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:39.720]  money through their Opel division at GM and through the Ford division in Russia.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.720]  I forget the name. We were fighting our own equipment the entire time in Vietnam.
[01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.720]  It's called full spectrum dominance and the Rand Corporation and others have
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:52.720]  explained this. To fully dominate, you've got to fill every space. And so they
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:55.720]  believe in full spectrum dominance. Full spectrum dominance doesn't just mean
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:00.720]  land, air, sea, controlling your mind. It means creating and financing the
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:05.720]  Muslim extremist, creating and financing the Nazis, creating and financing
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:11.720]  communism. This is why they're so hard to beat because they will create a false
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:16.720]  political hologram with unlimited central banking funding. They have unlimited
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:21.720]  money because we accept it out of fraud. It's a magician's trick, but once you
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.720]  buy into it, that that's why they're so hard to beat. Once you're aware of it
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.720]  though, but I mean, I'm not familiar with the guy you mentioned. That stuff's
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:34.720]  all in congressional hearings. That all came out with Anthony Sutton's
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:38.720]  research. I mean, that is all very well documented.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:46.720]  Yeah. And well, I also wanted to tell you that this UFC fighter got a visit by
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.720]  the Secret Service because he criticized Obama. He said, well, he didn't agree
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.720]  with the socialized health care. He said that someone had to knock some sense
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:00.720]  into him. It's just a common sense. I mean, common saying, knock some sense
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:04.720]  into him. In fact, guys, guys, pull up. If I've got the article, I saw it three,
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.720]  four days ago, pull up the UFC fighter. It'll be on YouTube. It'll be
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:12.720]  something like UFC fighter wants to fight Obama. And the guy clearly said,
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:17.720]  I'd like to face him in the ring. Well, I mean, if Obama wanted to go join UFC,
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:20.720]  they're always talking about what a great basketball player he is and how he
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.720]  could play in the NBA. And then Barkley came out and said, you know, the guy was
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:29.720]  a joke and he'd completely game him, you know, even though, quote, I'm a fat man
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:34.720]  as Barkley said, I mean, I mean, are they going to get a Secret Service visit there?
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:41.720]  This is a sport. You know, they wear gloves and, you know, that's the end of it.
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:45.720]  And statistically, they've had time to look at it now over the last two decades.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.720]  The sport developing, it's less dangerous than boxing because with boxing, you got
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:54.720]  high powered men, but they're wearing gloves. And so it goes on a lot longer
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:04:00.720]  and it's the concussion that damages the brainstem. In UFC, you don't last very long.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:07.720]  So it's much less harmful than NFL. See the pads overall in the end hurt you worse
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:12.720]  because they extend unnaturally how long you can be in these high punishment zones,
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.720]  but you're still getting the concussions. Whereas UFC, yeah, you may not have as
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.720]  long a life in the sport and your ears may look like cauliflower, but your brain
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.720]  isn't going to be as dingy. And again, I've looked deeply into that because it's very
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.720]  interesting. I've also had a lot of head trauma myself, not from fighting
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:32.720]  professionally, but car wrecks and having people hit me upside the head with a
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:38.720]  pole axe and stuff like that. But listen, I appreciate your call. That's a really good
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:44.720]  point. I did see that. That's in the stack to get to. Obviously, he meant, you know,
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:49.720]  I'd like to fight him in the ring and you don't do that in America. Now, it'd be one
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:53.720]  old Obama with some 70 year old president, but Obama likes to run around like he's,
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:59.720]  you know, some kind of sports icon. So get in the ring. Come on.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:04.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:08.720]  generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.720]  electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.720]  electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:21.720]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:25.720]  some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:29.720]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.720]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:37.720]  their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:41.720]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.720]  the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:50.720]  sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's

[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:04.720]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.720]  respiratory system with your self produced colloidal silver solutions. Yet many
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.720]  are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been
[01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:15.720]  designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:19.720]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:23.720]  Generator. Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:27.720]  ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:32.720]  and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:38.720]  areas. This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:43.720]  orally for the digestive system. Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:49.720]  the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:54.720]  Silver Lungs system works. As well, we are always ready to answer any questions
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:07:09.720]  you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
