[00:00.000 --> 00:16.080]  To me, it's all positive. I was asked today, on a scale of 1 to 10, who will be the next
[00:16.080 --> 00:20.600]  president. And I said, 10, it'll be Donald Trump. It'll be President Trump. There's no
[00:20.600 --> 00:25.160]  doubt in my mind. There's no doubt in my mind that he won this election hands down, in a
[00:25.160 --> 00:32.840]  landslide, probably somewhere between 350 and 400 electoral college votes. He was part
[00:32.840 --> 00:38.760]  of those 16 intelligence agencies that is able to see all the intel and the data, and
[00:38.760 --> 00:42.040]  that's why his story is the same thing I tell you. I can read what the globalists
[00:42.040 --> 00:51.160]  say at the CFR and read what Gigi Ping says. I stopped the Chinese people and the Chinese
[00:51.160 --> 01:02.400]  nation. The projections are that by 2050, that that's 70 percent, or the 60 percent
[01:02.400 --> 01:12.000]  is now with the G7, that 70 percent will be 35 percent, 35 percent. China and India together
[01:12.000 --> 01:17.960]  will be 50 percent of the global GDP, 50 percent. We're seeing a move in the next 40 years,
[01:17.960 --> 01:25.720]  the likes of which has not been seen for 200 years. And it's real. And it's real. And
[01:25.720 --> 01:31.400]  we're not preparing for it. It turns out that China is going to overtake the United States
[01:31.400 --> 01:39.160]  in 2027. It was said that this might be delayed for a year or two. But this year, God has
[01:39.160 --> 01:46.320]  pulled off a little trick, right? God created COVID-19 and spread it to every country in
[01:46.320 --> 01:53.320]  the world. We still have 4,000 dead, right? But if 4,000 Chinese die versus 220,000 in
[01:53.320 --> 01:59.640]  the United States, we haven't really lost a single person, have we? In 2012, we achieved
[01:59.640 --> 02:05.560]  absolute superiority over the U.S. and Japan. We have gained absolute superiority over the
[02:05.560 --> 02:12.080]  U.S. military. And we are expanding our military at a rate unprecedented in human history.
[02:12.080 --> 02:18.240]  As long as we go to work every day, we will drive the U.S. to its death. Globalist men,
[02:18.240 --> 02:24.280]  they are, they teach of the Army and Marine Corps training centers that America must merge
[02:24.280 --> 02:29.440]  with China for world peace. We have to prepare for a more angry world. Well, if you listen
[02:29.440 --> 02:36.160]  to Klaus Schwab in the Davos group and Xi Jinping, the great reset is modeled after
[02:36.160 --> 02:40.320]  the great leap forward. The theme of this year's summer doubles is shaping innovative
[02:40.320 --> 02:46.520]  societies in the fourth industrial revolution. What does an innovative society look like
[02:46.520 --> 02:55.160]  on your mind? We are in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution. Technology will change
[02:55.160 --> 03:01.400]  everything, business models, but it will also change society. And we have to be prepared
[03:01.400 --> 03:09.440]  for it. What is necessary is to make sure that the population absorbs all those changes
[03:09.440 --> 03:17.000]  and understands that those changes at the end are beneficial for our lives, for the
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.960]  quality of our lives.
[03:19.960 --> 03:26.080]  From David Rockefeller's own words, he's the guy that opened up China in the 70s. They
[03:26.080 --> 03:41.080]  put Mao in in the late 40s and they just killed most of their people that were actually informed
[03:41.080 --> 04:08.640]  about what was going on to create the communist party you have today.
[04:08.640 --> 04:12.960]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[04:12.960 --> 04:18.320]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[04:18.320 --> 04:41.400]  All right, folks, we're coming back on the other side.
[04:41.400 --> 05:05.760]  The trick that social engineers use is very, very simple. They just teach us that the architecture
[05:05.760 --> 05:12.640]  of civilization, that the trajectory of a species is designed by these ever-knowing,
[05:12.640 --> 05:17.440]  loving, liberal technocrats, and that if we just sit back and enjoy the ride, everything
[05:17.440 --> 05:22.160]  will be great. But then they tell us that humans are obsolete, non-essential, and we're
[05:22.160 --> 05:26.760]  bad for the earth and we need to be phased out. So they're very open about what they're
[05:26.760 --> 05:33.520]  doing and they count on us just being very passive living in the matrix-like system that
[05:33.520 --> 05:38.560]  they're building. But what defines humans more than anything from the rest of the quote
[05:38.560 --> 05:44.760]  animal kingdom is that we control our environment, we build our own environments, we create our
[05:44.760 --> 05:52.080]  own systems, we really geo-engineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our aims.
[05:52.080 --> 05:55.840]  But instead, we're acting like animals, although the globalists play the part of humans and
[05:55.840 --> 06:06.160]  us as cattle. That's the trick.
[06:06.160 --> 06:12.600]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the
[06:12.600 --> 06:28.440]  front lines of the Info War. It's Monday night. We've been working on this story for two weeks
[06:28.440 --> 06:33.000]  and now the whistleblower has given us the authorization to go forward with the information
[06:33.000 --> 06:37.960]  you are about to see. This is the first report and several are going to be breaking with
[06:37.960 --> 06:45.400]  the documents if MSM challenges this in any way. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a major
[06:45.400 --> 06:54.000]  health executive over a 35 hospital network in western Pennsylvania that is exposing the
[06:54.000 --> 07:02.520]  fact that COVID-19 is a completely overblown power grab scam. Now, we received this information
[07:02.520 --> 07:08.240]  directly from this whistleblower, checked out their credentials and that was just the
[07:08.240 --> 07:14.800]  beginning of how insane this got. Listen to this information. This individual is involved
[07:14.800 --> 07:20.200]  in the management of 35 hospital network in western Pennsylvania. The UPMC is the name
[07:20.200 --> 07:26.880]  of the company. During the latest so-called surge of COVID-19 where they claim the hospitals
[07:26.880 --> 07:33.680]  are all overwhelmed, we've got to have a lockdown again, they went from 96 beds to around 600.
[07:33.680 --> 07:39.840]  That is only 10% of the capacity they have just for COVID-19 and their hospitals are
[07:39.840 --> 07:48.160]  basically wide open. And here's the most important point. No deaths of the 600 people. Most patients
[07:48.160 --> 07:53.680]  stayed overnight for observation because they tested positive. Media will say hospitalization
[07:53.680 --> 08:00.200]  patients have surged over 600%, but it's the test that's been turned up 45 times and German
[08:00.200 --> 08:06.840]  courts have ruled that it is a fake test 96% of the time. So this is a major industrial
[08:06.840 --> 08:11.680]  scam. You've seen the big reports about the famous female CEO that had a test that could
[08:11.680 --> 08:16.280]  find cancer in your blood. It was incredible and they made hundreds of billions of dollars.
[08:16.280 --> 08:21.320]  And it turned out it was all scam. That's what this PCR scam is and the inventor of
[08:21.320 --> 08:28.400]  it came out and said just that. If they could find this virus in you at all and with PCR
[08:28.400 --> 08:33.800]  if you do it well, you can find almost anything in anybody. It starts making you believe in
[08:33.800 --> 08:37.840]  the sort of Buddhist notion that everything is contained and everything else, right? I
[08:37.840 --> 08:42.800]  mean, because if you can amplify one single molecule up to something that you can really
[08:42.800 --> 08:49.600]  measure which PCR can do, then there's just very few molecules that you don't have at
[08:49.600 --> 08:53.280]  least one single one of them in your body. Okay. So that could be thought of as a misuse
[08:53.280 --> 08:58.240]  of it just to claim that it's meaningful. So it's not about deaths now. It's all about
[08:58.240 --> 09:02.880]  the cases, the cases, the cases. Remember what we first broke eight months ago, Texas
[09:02.880 --> 09:09.120]  counties where they were told if one person test positive, claim 15 people around them
[09:09.120 --> 09:15.640]  have it. And that's also used. So this is the biggest hoax ever perpetrated in history,
[09:15.640 --> 09:20.680]  not just a medical hoax. And that's why they've got top scientists and virologists and epidemiologists
[09:20.680 --> 09:25.080]  going public saying it's the biggest hoax ever. Not there isn't a virus that if you're
[09:25.080 --> 09:30.200]  run down and don't have your vitamin D3 and your vitamin C and your zinc, sure, you're
[09:30.200 --> 09:34.800]  an old person nursing home, 85 years old, already had cancer, heart attacks, it can
[09:34.800 --> 09:40.640]  kill you just like the flu or a regular cold or pneumonia. But the response to it and the
[09:40.640 --> 09:45.840]  fear mongering and the power grab is a hoax. And even Klaus Schwab, the globalist of the
[09:45.840 --> 09:50.720]  Davos group says this is a great reset, but the virus really isn't a threat. And if it's
[09:50.720 --> 09:57.320]  the excuse to bring in this planetary rule and total control, the COVID-19 crisis would
[09:57.320 --> 10:08.600]  be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack to use
[10:08.600 --> 10:17.800]  the COVID-19 crisis as a timely opportunity to reflect on the lessons the cybersecurity
[10:17.800 --> 10:27.640]  community can draw and improve our preparedness for a potential cyber pandemic. We are now
[10:27.640 --> 10:34.080]  still fighting the virus, but we can be rather optimistic after what we have seen with the
[10:34.080 --> 10:39.480]  announcement of vaccines. Now, we have to think how to structure, how to design the
[10:39.480 --> 10:46.040]  post-corona era. And here, of course, the word reset comes to my mind because one thing
[10:46.040 --> 10:54.080]  is clear. We cannot come back to the old normal. We have to use this opportunity as our parents
[10:54.080 --> 11:00.680]  and grandparents have done after the World War II to really reflect on what went wrong
[11:00.680 --> 11:06.080]  and what could we do better. Everything we're seeing this fall going into the winter is
[11:06.080 --> 11:12.320]  a repeat of what we saw in January, February and March earlier this year. They tell you
[11:12.320 --> 11:17.280]  just 15 days to stay at home. The hospitals will be overwhelmed. Was it true? The hospitals
[11:17.280 --> 11:21.960]  were empty. Independent journalists went out and documented that. The media tried to deny
[11:21.960 --> 11:26.480]  it at first, but later had to admit it was true. And as M4 Wars has pointed out in the
[11:26.480 --> 11:32.800]  last few years, Big Tech, Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter have been merging and investing in
[11:32.800 --> 11:39.000]  Big Pharma and the hospital systems. So now they're even banning consumer watchdog groups.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.360]  They're banning medical doctors and epidemiologists, virologists and scientists who come out and
[11:43.360 --> 11:56.320]  point all this out because they want to use this hysteria.
[11:56.320 --> 12:07.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, December 1st, 2020. I'm your host, Alex Jones, and
[12:07.440 --> 12:13.840]  I have been preparing for this broadcast since 6 a.m. this morning, and the news is so massive,
[12:13.840 --> 12:20.360]  so over the top, so dangerous that I was unable to go on until 12 minutes into the transmission.
[12:20.360 --> 12:25.080]  That is because we have breaking information coming in that is being added to information
[12:25.080 --> 12:30.440]  we've been working on for weeks and months and years as the conflagration, the planetary
[12:30.440 --> 12:37.120]  alignment politically, spiritually, economically happens.
[12:37.120 --> 12:43.600]  Let me tell you what we have here. We've talked about things that Project Veritas has
[12:43.600 --> 12:46.400]  broken. We've talked about things that Breitbart's broken. We've talked about things Tucker
[12:46.400 --> 12:51.520]  Carlson has broken. I love when they do big things to say they've broken the biggest thing
[12:51.520 --> 12:57.760]  ever. This isn't about credit, but I have to tell you, we are breaking information on
[12:57.760 --> 13:06.400]  this show today that is the biggest thing ever broken concerning this fraudulent election
[13:06.400 --> 13:07.400]  and what happened.
[13:07.400 --> 13:14.400]  Now, I have been on the phone with a lot of different White House lawyers, and I have
[13:14.400 --> 13:18.240]  been on the phone with what's left of the Patriots and the Pentagon, and I have been
[13:18.240 --> 13:22.920]  on the phone with a national talk show host, and everybody is trying to decide what to
[13:22.920 --> 13:23.920]  do at this point.
[13:23.920 --> 13:30.160]  But let me just drop it on you right now. In FullWars.com, live show feed headline, must
[13:30.160 --> 13:40.560]  watch Tuesday live. That's got a typo, that's okay. Top lawyers advise Trump to declare
[13:40.560 --> 13:46.200]  martial law, hold new election. And that headline just went out minutes ago. My typo, I put
[13:46.200 --> 13:51.680]  that myself. Let's get that fixed, please. But there is so much going on. There is so
[13:51.680 --> 14:00.600]  much breaking. There is so much unfolding right now. And you just heard what I told
[14:00.600 --> 14:01.600]  you.
[14:01.600 --> 14:07.200]  Look at this headline. Attorney Lynn Wood, President Trump should declare martial law
[14:07.200 --> 14:11.960]  to hold new election. That sounds radical. That sounds extreme. We've been put under
[14:11.960 --> 14:22.040]  corporate globalist martial law. We're already under martial law. They've already put us
[14:22.040 --> 14:29.480]  under UN martial law. It's unconstitutional, it's criminal, but it's like being kidnapped.
[14:29.480 --> 14:33.760]  There's not a legitimate warrant. It's illegitimate that you're being taken by force with guns,
[14:33.760 --> 14:40.240]  but it's happening. So that's just one of the big stories, and I've got the inside baseball
[14:40.240 --> 14:45.160]  on what's behind that. And the fact that three months ago, Roger Stone said Trump must declare
[14:45.160 --> 14:50.120]  martial law when they try to steal the election and seize the servers and the proof, which
[14:50.120 --> 14:55.120]  is now finally starting to happen. It's not us that want the martial law. It's the left
[14:55.120 --> 14:59.160]  and the corporate media and the chai comms that are ending this country as we know it.
[14:59.160 --> 15:04.440]  And who have announced the lockdown is permanent and will never end. Now, that's the big Lynn
[15:04.440 --> 15:08.360]  Wood story, full page ad Washington Times. We're going to be reading the whole thing
[15:08.360 --> 15:15.960]  here on air today. In fact, bottom of the hour. But then there's this story. I hired
[15:15.960 --> 15:23.600]  a respected security firm that's done security research, the army and other groups to dig
[15:23.600 --> 15:34.880]  in when I was asked by the White House to investigate it. Three weeks ago, in two dominion
[15:34.880 --> 15:41.000]  and it being owned by the chai comms. We got the proof. We checked it with the SEC confirmed
[15:41.000 --> 15:48.040]  it two days ago. And we now publish the findings at info wars.com firm that owns dominion voting
[15:48.040 --> 15:53.360]  systems received 400 million from Swiss bank account with connection to Chinese government
[15:53.360 --> 16:00.080]  before election. You heard me right. It's even stronger than that. It really is simple.
[16:00.080 --> 16:05.240]  The left are into being deviant and I don't mean sexually deviant. That goes to territory.
[16:05.240 --> 16:10.960]  I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors deviant against their own species deviant against
[16:10.960 --> 16:15.520]  the order of nature. Even though that deviance is destructive and poisonous, they still do
[16:15.520 --> 16:20.880]  it because they want to play God. Everything they touch, they destroy their sacrament is
[16:20.880 --> 16:26.640]  aborting babies and then using their body parts. Their religion is not taking care of
[16:26.640 --> 16:30.880]  the old but euthanizing them. Their whole system is designed for the UN to keep their
[16:30.880 --> 16:35.760]  world countries in serious poverty and poor, ballooning populations and then watching all
[16:35.760 --> 16:41.680]  that new fruit down the vine to continually reproduce the same nightmares over and over
[16:41.680 --> 16:45.120]  and over again. They truly are the children of Satan. They are the children of the devil.
[16:45.120 --> 16:49.760]  And if you look at the slaves that serve them, Biden and Kamala Harris, it really is manifested
[16:49.760 --> 16:54.960]  that being a slave of Satan is not profitable. Sin is not profitable. I'm Alex Jones and
[16:54.960 --> 16:56.960]  this is The Info War.
[17:54.960 --> 18:04.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:25.280 --> 18:34.960]  We are live. It's Tuesday, December 1st. The year is 2020. We are 50 days out
[18:35.520 --> 18:40.720]  from the inauguration. Will it be the puppet chai-com operative, Joe Biden? Or will it be
[18:40.720 --> 18:48.560]  the man who won an even bigger landslide, Donald John Trump? Now, Roger Stone said this three months
[18:48.560 --> 18:54.800]  ago. Lynn Wood is a very respected top lawyer, said it today in a full page ad in the Washington
[18:54.800 --> 19:00.080]  Times. We'll be reading in full next segment. But when you have foreign powers and massive
[19:00.080 --> 19:06.320]  election fraud, the executive branch must declare a civil emergency. Lynn Wood calls it
[19:06.320 --> 19:13.920]  martial law and have a new election. They put out a fraudulent election with 80 million ballots.
[19:13.920 --> 19:21.360]  They mailed out 700,000 extra ballots. Let me explain that again. 700,000 extra ballots came
[19:21.360 --> 19:30.000]  back in Georgia that did not exist, that were falsified, probably by the Communist Chinese.
[19:30.640 --> 19:36.960]  This is so huge. But let me give you the big Info Wars exclusive of two big Info Wars exclusives
[19:36.960 --> 19:42.960]  that the system is fighting and battling as hard as it can to make sure it does not get out to anybody.
[19:42.960 --> 19:52.160]  Firm that owns Dominion voting systems received 400 million from Swiss bank with connection
[19:52.160 --> 19:59.440]  to Chinese government before election. Now, that's putting it lightly. It's actually two
[19:59.440 --> 20:05.200]  of them are Chinese government run subsidiaries. An investigation into securities and exchange
[20:05.200 --> 20:11.360]  commission filings revealed that the firm which owns Dominion voting systems, which is a voting
[20:11.360 --> 20:16.960]  machine company, received $400 million from a Swiss bank account with close links to the Chinese
[20:16.960 --> 20:23.600]  government less than a month before the election. The investigation conducted by Austin security
[20:23.600 --> 20:29.600]  and investigation solutions centers on Staple Street capital and acquired Dominion voting
[20:29.600 --> 20:38.320]  systems in 2018. The Carlisle Group and Soros own that. Dominion voting systems operates voting
[20:38.320 --> 20:43.440]  machines in 28 states and has been accused by President Trump and his supporters of being
[20:43.440 --> 20:50.000]  involved in deleting millions of votes for Trump in addition to switching votes to Biden on election
[20:50.000 --> 20:58.880]  night. On October 8, 2020, Staple Street capital filed SEC form D offerings and sales amounts of
[20:58.880 --> 21:08.480]  $400 million with the sales compensation recipient identification as UBS securities
[21:08.480 --> 21:13.760]  states the investigation, which also notes another payment of $200 million was received in
[21:13.760 --> 21:21.760]  December of 2014. UBS securities is a Swiss investment bank, which owns 24.99 of UBS securities
[21:21.760 --> 21:29.200]  co-LTD, a Chinese investment bank. The remaining 75% of UBS securities co-LTD is owned by the
[21:29.200 --> 21:37.120]  Chinese government. Did you hear what I just said? UBS securities is a Swiss investment bank,
[21:37.120 --> 21:45.280]  which owns 24.99 of the UBS securities co-LTD, a Chinese investment bank. The remaining 75% of
[21:45.280 --> 21:51.760]  UBS securities co-LTD is owned by the Chinese government states the report. Almost all of it
[21:51.760 --> 21:57.680]  is Chinese government. So the real headline is Chinese communist government caught laundering
[21:57.680 --> 22:06.320]  400 million through Swiss bank to Dominion month before election. Whoa! And we've got all these
[22:06.320 --> 22:12.160]  documents they're linked to the article. The overall owners of UBS securities co-LTD are
[22:12.160 --> 22:24.800]  Beijing Guoxin, 33%, UBS 24.99, Guangdong Comm Group, 14.01, China Guangden, 14,
[22:25.360 --> 22:33.120]  COFCO Group, 14%. Almost all of it shy come. Aside from UBS, the other four owners of UBS
[22:33.120 --> 22:39.360]  securities are all communist Chinese front groups. Beijing Guoxin is a state-owned asset.
[22:39.360 --> 22:47.040]  Guangdong Comm Group 100% stakeholder in the Guangdong Provincial Government.
[22:47.040 --> 22:54.480]  The Guangdong Provincial Government, poor Chinese peasants money, was used to steal our election.
[22:54.480 --> 23:00.000]  China Guang Dean is a state-owned enterprise administered by the SASAC
[23:01.120 --> 23:08.240]  in-state council. COFCO Group is a state-owned enterprise under the direct supervision of SASAC,
[23:08.240 --> 23:13.520]  SASAC, the state-owned asset supervision and administration commission of the state council
[23:13.520 --> 23:17.600]  of the SASAC, the Special Commission of the People's Republic of China,
[23:17.600 --> 23:25.840]  directly under the state council. Wow! That's a GG ping. PDF documents confirm the above details
[23:25.840 --> 23:31.760]  were provided by Austin security and investigation solutions. The revelation that Dominion voting
[23:31.760 --> 23:37.600]  systems as financial ties to the Chinese government via UBS securities will boost claims and bolster
[23:37.600 --> 23:41.840]  claims by Trump supporters that foreign actors working on behalf of communist China
[23:41.840 --> 23:48.400]  may have sought to meddle in the presidential election. No, no, no. This is smoking freaking gun,
[23:48.400 --> 23:54.800]  man. If they caught Russian companies pumping hundreds of millions into a voting machine company
[23:54.800 --> 23:59.520]  that then did mysterious stuff for Trump, I would call for his damn arrest. But there was
[23:59.520 --> 24:08.000]  not a evidence of that. But here it's absolutely confirmed. Now, I was put on the lead of this by
[24:08.000 --> 24:13.200]  a very high-level individual in the White House and I said, why me? And they said, look, we already
[24:13.200 --> 24:18.640]  know it's there. This has to be independent. You need to go find it. So I hired a security firm
[24:18.640 --> 24:25.920]  and I told him dig and then this came in. And it's all confirmed. It's on infowars.com.
[24:25.920 --> 24:29.600]  Guys, show the article, please. Put the article up. Please scroll through for everybody.
[24:31.360 --> 24:36.400]  Firm that owns Dominion voting systems received 400 million from Swiss bank with connection
[24:36.400 --> 24:42.320]  to Chinese government. No, no, no. Swiss bank partnership owned by the Chinese government.
[24:42.960 --> 24:52.560]  Smoking freaking gun, smoking gun, smoking gun. And I'm going to leave it at that. But
[24:52.560 --> 24:59.280]  this is the biggest thing we've ever broken when it turns to this country in the Republic.
[24:59.280 --> 25:03.840]  I don't know what I have to do to get you to share it, to email it, to get it out.
[25:03.840 --> 25:10.240]  It's the smoking gun of the Communist Chinese. Did you hear almost the majority of the entire
[25:10.240 --> 25:16.160]  investment bank, Swiss investment bank fund is owned by provincial governments and the
[25:16.160 --> 25:24.320]  central committee of the Communist Party in Communist China. Holy hell. This is ridiculous.
[25:24.880 --> 25:30.720]  Where is the Senate? Where are the Republicans? They're on the payroll of the same thing,
[25:30.720 --> 25:34.560]  just like big tech. We were sold out to China. We were merged to China.
[25:35.680 --> 25:38.480]  And it's like that Howard Beale thing, a network where he says, listen,
[25:38.480 --> 25:41.840]  you didn't just mess up a business deal. The Arabs have taken billions out.
[25:41.840 --> 25:45.360]  Now the Arabs must put it back in. Oh, you mean to own our voting systems
[25:45.360 --> 25:50.400]  and say we don't have our right to vote? This is the smoking gun.
[25:51.920 --> 25:59.680]  Smoking gun, breaking Swiss bank fund owned by Chinese government gave Dominion $400 million
[26:00.240 --> 26:08.800]  on eve of election. I mean, wow, what do I need to do to get people to realize how huge this is?
[26:08.800 --> 26:15.280]  All the censorship, all the lockdowns, all the control was to stop this information getting out.
[26:15.280 --> 26:20.160]  And then you've got the Communist Chinese on record printing up millions of fake ballots
[26:20.160 --> 26:25.680]  and driver's license. And it came out that the U.S. rated the Chinese consulate in Houston
[26:25.680 --> 26:30.560]  and said they were creating counterfeit ballots and they were burning it all in a huge fire.
[26:30.560 --> 26:34.960]  And that even came out and was confirmed. And then now in Georgia, hundreds of thousands of
[26:34.960 --> 26:41.120]  ballots all perfectly printed by computers in the Scantron bubbles. I mean, it's all there.
[26:41.120 --> 26:46.560]  They did it. They did it. Chinese planes, private charter jets landing all over the U.S.
[26:46.560 --> 26:52.160]  the night before the election with ballots and the Chinese men going in after the polling places
[26:52.160 --> 26:57.120]  were closed with the big boxes of ballots. They even sent in their own people. There is an economic
[26:57.120 --> 27:02.240]  war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control. There's a headline
[27:02.240 --> 27:06.800]  out from zero heads that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global airlines are set to lose
[27:06.800 --> 27:13.840]  157 billion dollars this year by the end of December. It's already over 130 billion dollars
[27:13.840 --> 27:20.000]  they've lost. Why would they take part in the hoax, in the lockdown, in the hysteria,
[27:20.000 --> 27:23.920]  if it hurts them? Well, see, that'll knock out all the small airlines and consolidate control.
[27:23.920 --> 27:28.480]  And it's the same in every single industry. And the big megabanks have unlimited capital.
[27:28.480 --> 27:33.200]  They want to bankrupt the world economy until they buy it up for pennies on the dollar. That's
[27:33.200 --> 27:37.600]  why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned out was engineered by some central banks.
[27:37.600 --> 27:43.600]  This is how the global estate control. It stars the third world to death, makes the first world
[27:43.600 --> 27:48.960]  poor, it's economic warfare, and it gives cover to the big megabanks that created thousands
[27:48.960 --> 27:58.800]  of trillions of dollars in fake derivatives. Only the truth will set us free in FullWars.com.
[28:19.840 --> 28:24.160]  Mass starvation of hundreds of millions, millions have already starved to death,
[28:24.160 --> 28:28.880]  not from COVID, but from the lockdown. That's why it's important for people in North America
[28:28.880 --> 28:32.560]  to get prepared for all over the world. But we have high-quality horrible food,
[28:32.560 --> 28:38.480]  ready to ship to you the last 25 years, and prepare with alex.com. There's an additional 10%

[28:54.880 --> 29:01.760]  God bless. The great reset. Where have I heard of that before? Oh, the great leap forward,
[29:01.760 --> 29:07.840]  Mao Zedong, ordering all the small towns and small farms to basically shut down and have the rural
[29:07.840 --> 29:12.560]  people and the small business people move into the big cities and go under communist commune
[29:12.560 --> 29:16.880]  control. And that's all this is. The big megabanks want to break us into the same ones that put
[29:16.880 --> 29:20.960]  Mao Zedong into power. And they're creating the process of getting rid of our old economy and
[29:20.960 --> 29:25.920]  bringing in the new economy where everything's free. Because when you're a prisoner, well,
[29:25.920 --> 29:30.560]  everything's free, but you're also a slave. Scotland is going to have universal guaranteed
[29:30.560 --> 29:34.960]  incomes now of subsistence level. But of course, you got to take those vaccines. You can't have
[29:34.960 --> 29:41.280]  any kids. And oh, don't worry, though, all of the tampons and stuff like that's free too as well.
[29:41.280 --> 29:45.760]  I'm not kidding. So they'll give me some free paper. They'll give me enough money to basically live
[29:45.760 --> 29:50.400]  in a tiny apartment, but they own you, they control you. That's the great reset. That's why
[29:50.400 --> 29:54.720]  it's got to be resisted to total takeover and we're fighting it at info wars.com.
[29:54.720 --> 30:12.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:12.640 --> 30:29.760]  If you visit the tip of the spear info wars.com site, the enemy has been attacking and trying to
[30:29.760 --> 30:37.680]  shut down like none other. You will see the top story voting machine firm that owns dominion
[30:37.680 --> 30:45.440]  voting systems received 400 million from Swiss bank fund 75 plus percent owned officially
[30:45.440 --> 30:48.960]  by the communist Chinese government a month before the election.
[30:50.720 --> 30:55.120]  Now we are publishing this quite a bit of these documents from the securities and
[30:55.120 --> 30:58.640]  exchange commission on the site. As we speak, more is being added
[31:00.720 --> 31:04.000]  because the individual here at my office put this report together wanted to be careful about
[31:04.000 --> 31:08.880]  how much you put out, but I told him just post everything justice be done may the heavens fall.
[31:09.680 --> 31:16.240]  You know, I'm Alex Jones, your host. So we have that incredible story for you
[31:19.120 --> 31:26.160]  that is smoking gun. It's not nebulous. No, it's it's the proof and what do you do when a foreign
[31:26.160 --> 31:33.840]  government owns your debt owns most of Hollywood on record four of the six big studios is financing
[31:33.840 --> 31:40.880]  race war and have national state run TV programs where they say America will never be unlocked
[31:40.880 --> 31:45.920]  down. We are not locked down. We're using code to quote destroy and kill America. America will
[31:45.920 --> 31:52.080]  be gone soon. We are killing America. These are quotes. I played them at the very start of the
[31:52.080 --> 31:58.400]  show in the report America on collision course with communism ally with all these big banks
[31:58.400 --> 32:08.800]  corporations because they're all authoritarians and they have an alliance of evil. And so when
[32:08.800 --> 32:13.440]  you have the blue states, the blue cities, the corporations, big tech censoring everybody's
[32:13.440 --> 32:18.560]  speech about criticizing the lockdown, censoring thousands of doctors and scientists and nurses
[32:18.560 --> 32:23.920]  that say covid and overblown hoax. When you have people being arrested and beat up by the police
[32:23.920 --> 32:28.560]  because they're not wearing a mask in public walking down the street, you're under martial law. Corporate
[32:28.560 --> 32:36.080]  globalist martial law has already been declared. And Bill Gates says I want to depopulate you
[32:36.080 --> 32:40.400]  and I'm coming with a forced inoculation. You won't get a job or get on an airplane or go to
[32:40.400 --> 32:45.360]  a grocery store unless you have a QR code showing that you've been vaccinated with five vaccines.
[32:45.360 --> 32:49.040]  I want you to take a year which he admits can hurt you violating the Nuremberg code
[32:49.040 --> 32:55.360]  and the Geneva Convention. I mean, this is Nazi stuff on its face, dyed in the wool to the fine
[32:55.360 --> 33:04.960]  print bonafide. And so what is the response to that? Well, you got a bunch of not need lawyers
[33:04.960 --> 33:09.840]  and leftist and all the big Democrat lawyers meeting with the key leadership in Georgia
[33:09.840 --> 33:14.480]  and Pennsylvania and Nevada and Arizona and obviously paying them off to go along with this
[33:14.480 --> 33:19.120]  is saying you'll be supported. We'll use the machines to keep you in power now that you're
[33:19.120 --> 33:22.480]  part of the club. You'll end up being a U.S. Senator. You'll end up being a president.
[33:24.640 --> 33:28.080]  Just betray America and play ball. Well, that leads us to this next article.
[33:28.880 --> 33:36.400]  What's up on infowars.com. We've posted the full page article ad that the very respected
[33:36.400 --> 33:42.960]  lawyer Lee Lynn Greenwood has put out. And I'm going to go ahead and again read you this headline
[33:42.960 --> 33:51.520]  right here. Attorney Lynn Wood, President Trump should declare martial law and hold new election.
[33:53.280 --> 33:57.520]  Then he goes through in this full page article, full page ad.
[33:59.040 --> 34:02.720]  You can still pay to get your speech out. I guess in America that I totally agree
[34:03.840 --> 34:05.440]  with this constitutional analysis.
[34:05.440 --> 34:15.360]  And I'm asking you to go to infowars.com and to get this op-ed, to get this report
[34:15.920 --> 34:20.160]  and get it out to everyone you know now. It's also posted at thegatewaypundit.com.
[34:20.720 --> 34:32.080]  We the people, convention, we're right back to July 4th, 1776 exercising extraordinary
[34:32.080 --> 34:37.680]  authority and defense of our vote may be required because martial law is better than civil war.
[34:39.120 --> 34:42.480]  In the months following the start of the civil war, President Abraham Lincoln struggled to
[34:42.480 --> 34:47.440]  preserve the union. He objected to Lincoln's extraordinary use of presidential authority,
[34:47.440 --> 34:53.200]  in particular his suspension of the right of Abe's corpus. On June 12th, 1863, Lincoln defended
[34:53.200 --> 34:57.440]  his extreme measures in a letter published in the New York Times, citing article one of the
[34:57.440 --> 35:05.360]  constitution he argued, ours is a case of rebellion. In fact, a clear flagrant and gigantic case of
[35:05.360 --> 35:10.800]  rebellion and the provision of the constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus
[35:10.800 --> 35:18.160]  shall not be suspended unless when in case of rebellion, this is the key or invasion. This
[35:18.160 --> 35:24.640]  is a globalist takeover. The public safety may require it in the provision which specifically
[35:24.640 --> 35:30.640]  applies to our present case. Lincoln used the same reason to justify a series of extraordinary
[35:30.640 --> 35:35.680]  presidential orders. But why even use what Lincoln did? That was questionable. This is a foreign
[35:35.680 --> 35:43.120]  chai-com takeover. Lincoln ordered hundreds of northern newspapers that spoke against him to
[35:43.120 --> 35:48.480]  be shut down and their owners and editors arrested. But they're chai-com agents, the globalist are.
[35:48.480 --> 35:56.160]  Lincoln ordered the arrest of Ohio Congressman Clement Vandal de Ham for the crime of speaking
[35:56.160 --> 36:02.720]  out against him. Chief Justice of the U.S. Roger Taney ruled that Lincoln had violated the U.S.
[36:02.720 --> 36:07.520]  Constitution when he illegally suspended the writ of habeas corpus. After hearing this,
[36:07.520 --> 36:12.480]  Lincoln signed an arrest warrant to have Chief Justice of the U.S. arrested. Lincoln ordered
[36:12.480 --> 36:17.920]  the arrest of thousands in Maryland for crime of suspected southern sympathies, including ordering
[36:17.920 --> 36:24.000]  the arrest of U.S. Congressman Henry May from Maryland. These people were arrested and held
[36:24.000 --> 36:29.360]  in military prisons without trial, some of them for years. And again, I'm not even endorsing the
[36:29.360 --> 36:36.560]  Lincoln course. This is a foreign outside technocracy cyber attack takeover. By the way,
[36:36.560 --> 36:41.920]  they now have a dominion engineer in the county in Georgia walking up illegally,
[36:41.920 --> 36:45.600]  plugging a thumb drive in, walking out with it for a few hours, coming back and plugging it
[36:45.600 --> 36:50.080]  back in. Totally illegal. That's how you change votes. I mean, we have them, folks. We have them.
[36:50.080 --> 36:56.560]  We have them. While some debate, these measures still today, no one disagrees that Lincoln and
[36:56.560 --> 37:00.640]  his use of presidential power were responsible for saving the republic. While history and even
[37:00.640 --> 37:06.160]  former President Obama has judged Lincoln as perhaps the greatest president, few would have
[37:06.160 --> 37:12.720]  argued at the time he took those actions. Then as now, a president with courage and determination
[37:12.720 --> 37:16.960]  was needed to preserve the union. Today, the current threat to our United States by the
[37:16.960 --> 37:21.600]  international domestic socialist communists left is much more serious than anything Lincoln,
[37:21.600 --> 37:25.920]  our nation has faced in history, including our civil war. And I agree, and including the British,
[37:26.800 --> 37:33.520]  both in 1812 and 1776. We have well-funded, armed and trained Marxist and anti-VNBOM,
[37:33.520 --> 37:38.480]  strategically positioned in our major cities, acting openly with violence to silence,
[37:38.480 --> 37:43.840]  opposition to their anti-American agenda, attacking federal buildings and police,
[37:43.840 --> 37:47.920]  cowardly punching innocent people in the back of the head, assaulting people just for siding
[37:47.920 --> 37:52.080]  and just for eating in restaurants, and burning minority-owned businesses to the ground.
[37:52.640 --> 37:55.760]  All of the elected officials in Democrat, Socialist-controlled cities
[37:55.760 --> 37:59.520]  openly encouraging this planned violence against civilians and businesses,
[37:59.520 --> 38:06.640]  then to advance their cause, their socialists are acting to defund the police, creating chaos and
[38:06.640 --> 38:13.920]  suspending the rule of law that protects millions of average and particularly minority Americans,
[38:13.920 --> 38:18.480]  which is their own leftist form of martial law, because they suspend the normal law to stop crime,
[38:18.480 --> 38:23.680]  stop arson, stop attack, to get the malice youth brigades going like dominoes to take over the
[38:23.680 --> 38:29.040]  whole country through intimidation. This is a classic commie takeover. The results being massive
[38:29.040 --> 38:33.280]  increases in violent crime and death in our cities and the destruction of small businesses
[38:33.280 --> 38:37.840]  orchestrated by those politicians and leftist groups, many funded by domestic international
[38:37.840 --> 38:43.600]  communists. We are literally under attack from within, and I would add orchestrated from without.
[38:46.320 --> 38:50.720]  Then there are admitted Democrat, Socialist, Federal officials plotting to finish gutting
[38:50.720 --> 38:56.000]  the U.S. Constitution after 100 years of trying. They promise to take away critical
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.000]  individual rights like free speech. See, that's martial law already. Religious freedom, the
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.040]  Second Amendment, destroy states' rights by eliminating those electoral college and more,
[39:05.040 --> 39:09.440]  pack the Supreme Court with activists, anti-constitutional judges who will make law from
[39:09.440 --> 39:13.840]  the bench and give the right to vote to tens of millions of non-Americans and open our borders
[39:13.840 --> 39:20.880]  to more illegals, which will reduce wages. No one voted for these things that were hidden
[39:20.880 --> 39:26.320]  from the majority of Americans, but the corrupt media covered it up. Not only do we have corrupt
[39:26.320 --> 39:30.960]  media, and it goes on. And this is just the tip of the iceberg what this prestigious lawyer wrote.
[39:30.960 --> 39:36.640]  This is Chai-Kam Globalist War. All the big banks, all the big tech have doubled their profits or
[39:36.640 --> 39:41.200]  more. They're raping everything. We're going bankrupt. They're telling us we're not essential.
[39:41.200 --> 39:47.760]  This is 21st century war. Recognizes an outside globalist attack and arrests the collaborators now.

[40:55.840 --> 41:01.040]  The globalists and their minions want to play God. Chuck E. Schumer, Hillary Clinton,
[41:01.040 --> 41:06.800]  Barack Obama. You look at these sacks of garbage and you think, why do they hate humanity so much?
[41:06.800 --> 41:14.560]  Why do they love death? Because they hate themselves. They project their own disgust with
[41:14.560 --> 41:20.800]  their soul onto us. And once you understand that basic psychological point, every other answer
[41:20.800 --> 41:25.680]  is completely clear. That's why they hate info wars. We believe in humanity. We think you're
[41:25.680 --> 41:31.280]  beautiful. We think you're amazing. Info wars knows you're fallen, but that you have God's
[41:31.280 --> 41:36.480]  potential that God gave you. Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here. It's now upon
[41:36.480 --> 41:40.400]  us. I want to encourage you all to spread the word about info wars now more than ever when the
[41:40.400 --> 41:44.800]  enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth. We know you're going to override these globalists.
[41:44.800 --> 41:48.240]  We know you're going to defeat them. I just want to salute you all for your action, everything
[41:48.240 --> 41:52.320]  you've already done because God's on our side and the globalists know it.
[41:56.160 --> 42:01.120]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the
[42:01.120 --> 42:06.400]  economy's Chinese and the United Nations. And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be
[42:06.400 --> 42:11.440]  subservient, the worst Australian models of complete lockdowns you can't even leave your
[42:11.440 --> 42:17.120]  house for months and months are being announced. And in Germany, the police are using giant armored
[42:17.120 --> 42:22.080]  tanks with water cannons to blast men, women and children that protest the fact that Merkel,
[42:22.080 --> 42:26.480]  the dictator, has put them under her control. That's right. She's been ringing elections for
[42:26.480 --> 42:32.240]  years and years. And the same thing is coming here to the United States. This is world government.
[42:32.240 --> 42:36.960]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested.
[42:36.960 --> 42:41.440]  They're announcing the Christmas is canceled. This is what the communist takeover looks like,
[42:41.440 --> 42:47.200]  to bankrupt you, to take red of all your due process and absolutely transform the world
[42:47.200 --> 42:53.120]  into a prison planet. How long have we warned you about this? But you can fight back. America
[42:53.120 --> 42:57.760]  is the last bastion. Stop submitting.
[43:07.760 --> 43:14.320]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with your
[43:14.320 --> 43:19.680]  Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu comes
[43:19.680 --> 43:26.640]  up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest band.video.
[43:26.640 --> 43:31.520]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to
[43:31.520 --> 43:35.840]  stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override
[43:35.840 --> 43:41.360]  them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app. So it's up to you
[43:41.360 --> 43:46.080]  whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook,
[43:46.080 --> 43:50.240]  on Twitter, on YouTube. However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[44:16.080 --> 44:26.240]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[44:46.960 --> 45:12.480]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you so much for joining us. We are in the middle of a globalist
[45:12.480 --> 45:17.520]  takeover by communist Chinese and our allies. We have caught them red-handed.
[45:18.240 --> 45:24.080]  Division software given 400 million in October of this year through a secret Swiss bank account.
[45:24.080 --> 45:29.760]  We have them now. The article is at infowars.com. If you want to fight this takeover,
[45:31.600 --> 45:36.480]  you should need to share it to your email over the phone. You need to print copies off. You
[45:36.480 --> 45:39.600]  can get out to everyone. The documents are all being posted there. You can see it for yourself.
[45:39.600 --> 45:46.800]  The constitutional lawyer, very respected. Lynn Wood has come out with a full page ad. I'm going
[45:46.800 --> 45:52.560]  to continue reading through an op-ed The Washington Times calling for Trump to respond to this foreign
[45:52.560 --> 45:57.920]  international takeover with martial law. They've already put us under leftist martial law in their
[45:57.920 --> 46:03.680]  cities. Closing grocery stores now saying you don't have speech censoring you if you speak
[46:03.680 --> 46:08.400]  out in England and in Australia. They arrest you if you criticize the lockdowns. They're
[46:08.400 --> 46:13.840]  arresting doctors in Germany that say it's a fraud. This is the UN global takeover. So the
[46:13.840 --> 46:21.600]  response is martial law to stop their martial law and arrest them. But the FBI has been sold out.
[46:22.960 --> 46:25.920]  Even though they're going to all be destroyed and have no pension funds either,
[46:25.920 --> 46:33.200]  they just are too cowardly. They're a yes man. Not all of them at the top. This is what we've
[46:33.200 --> 46:39.280]  been made a party to. But America's seeing it in awakening. It's easy to try to occupy a country,
[46:39.840 --> 46:44.720]  but we'll see how easy it is as the global awakening happens. I was in two stores this
[46:44.720 --> 46:48.640]  morning and both people said they were aware of the great reset of the new world order. They were
[46:48.640 --> 46:55.760]  both young women. The people are awake. Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, and they're getting more awake
[46:55.760 --> 47:00.400]  by the minute. And they're every race, color, and creed coming together. But talk about tomorrow's
[47:00.400 --> 47:07.360]  news today. Here's the London Guardian, the New York Times, Business Insider. Roger was on back
[47:07.360 --> 47:12.960]  in September. Roger Stone to Donald Trump, bringing martial law if you lose election.
[47:12.960 --> 47:17.040]  Roger Stone calls for Trump to declare martial law if he loses election. Order rest of Mark
[47:17.040 --> 47:21.600]  Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and the Clintons. Roger Stone calls on Trump to seize total power and
[47:22.720 --> 47:27.920]  assert martial law. He says he has total power in the Constitution. If they have dominion software
[47:27.920 --> 47:35.360]  and fraudulent stuff, then he has to move and seize those. If the FBI and the courts won't act,
[47:35.360 --> 47:39.920]  he has to declare the civil emergency. He's the executive. Protect the Republic. This is when
[47:39.920 --> 47:46.400]  you do it. I'm an expert on martial law, ladies and gentlemen. I'm against it because the UN
[47:46.400 --> 47:51.600]  wanted to have it through Obama or the Clintons to take our guns. This is them doing it to move
[47:51.600 --> 47:58.960]  the president out to do it. This is their UN globalist medical martial law, as the Archbishop
[47:58.960 --> 48:03.040]  and others have called it. It's what it is to circumvent the government and hope the government
[48:03.040 --> 48:10.080]  just stands back and watches it all happen. Globalism is corporate media governance. It's
[48:10.080 --> 48:18.880]  technocracy. The old dinosaur media, working with the corporate media, working with big tech,
[48:18.880 --> 48:24.640]  with the big banks, the multinationals. So let's continue. I'm not going to read his whole letter.
[48:24.640 --> 48:31.200]  It's up on inforwars.com. The well-trained communists funded by the Chinese. They're admitted
[48:31.200 --> 48:35.520]  Democrat, socialist, federal officials plotting to finish gutting the Constitution, taking all
[48:35.520 --> 48:42.000]  our speech, our guns, everything as we know it will be ending. The socialist slept has been
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.880]  openly working to destroy the United States since Obama promised to and tried to transform America
[48:46.880 --> 48:51.840]  2008. And having been stopped by the will of American people, they openly staged four-year
[48:51.840 --> 48:57.040]  long coup to remove the duly elected president. And you know all about that.
[48:59.040 --> 49:04.960]  So he goes on to say, President Trump, you and every other official in our local state and federal
[49:04.960 --> 49:10.160]  government and everyone in law enforcement in our military have sworn an oath that says
[49:11.840 --> 49:16.400]  I will support and I will defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies far in
[49:16.400 --> 49:22.480]  the domestic. It is time for everyone who swore that oath to act upon it. The enemies are within the
[49:22.480 --> 49:30.880]  gates. I'm going to read that again. It is time for everyone who swore that oath to act upon it.
[49:32.400 --> 49:37.440]  And even if you didn't, it's your own self-preservation. The enemies are within the gates,
[49:37.440 --> 49:43.120]  but our Constitution and nation are in real risk of being lost to the socialist communist
[49:43.120 --> 49:49.120]  invasion unless you act decisively. At least half of America do not and will not accept
[49:49.120 --> 49:53.680]  this fraudulent election because of the eyewitness testimony and the material statistical and
[49:53.680 --> 50:02.160]  mathematical evidence of overwhelming fraud. The other half will not accept the outcome
[50:02.160 --> 50:07.440]  if the court see the evidence of fraud and rightfully overturn the election. The left has
[50:07.440 --> 50:15.360]  literally been planning riots just for that occasion for months. We the people must not and
[50:15.360 --> 50:20.400]  will not cede our exclusive constitutional right to elect representatives to judges,
[50:20.400 --> 50:25.200]  lawyers, courts, governors, secretaries of state, congress and corrupt election officials and local
[50:25.200 --> 50:33.520]  politicians, the corrupt media or leftist threats of violence. It is our exclusive right to decide
[50:33.520 --> 50:40.080]  our representatives not theirs. Therefore, we the people must demand a new and fair national vote,
[50:40.720 --> 50:46.560]  a vote that all Americans can trust and live by regardless of the winner. Without a fair vote,
[50:46.560 --> 50:54.000]  we fear with good reason the threat of a shooting civil war is imminent. Gun sales are at all time
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.800]  high and 40% for the first time gun owners looking to defend themselves, their property
[50:58.800 --> 51:04.880]  and their rights. Therefore, Mr. President, we must act now before there is no peaceful way left
[51:04.880 --> 51:10.160]  to preserve our nation. Exactly. Why the chai comms in the UN do this? Because even if Trump
[51:10.160 --> 51:17.040]  removes the fraud, there'll be a civil war. If he goes through the fraudulent system, it has to be
[51:17.040 --> 51:22.480]  its chai comm attack. He has to arrest the heads of the media. He has to arrest them. They're all
[51:22.480 --> 51:27.680]  Chinese agents. We have all the proof and we have to just go after them and have Nuremberg trials.
[51:27.680 --> 51:32.000]  I mean, this is on the tip of the takeover. This happened during Roosevelt. The Nazis tried to
[51:32.000 --> 51:36.800]  get 500,000 man team up to overthrow the government. Then the Spendley Butler went and exposed it.
[51:36.800 --> 51:44.080]  They got stopped. When the legislature's courts and Congress fell to do their duty
[51:44.080 --> 51:49.040]  on 12th Amendment, you must be ready, Mr. President, to immediately declare a limited form of martial
[51:49.040 --> 51:53.920]  law. That's key. A limited form. Because the left already put us under it. And temporarily suspend
[51:53.920 --> 51:58.480]  the Constitution and civilian control of these federal elections for the sole purpose of having
[51:58.480 --> 52:04.240]  the military oversee a national revote, a vote that assures a fair election in every jurisdiction
[52:04.240 --> 52:09.040]  and reflects the true will of the people. And by the way, under even the UN and the U.S.
[52:09.040 --> 52:13.680]  State Department rules, if there aren't poll watchers and there isn't a record that can be
[52:13.680 --> 52:19.120]  inspected, elections are thrown out. Well, they kicked all the poll watchers out, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:19.120 --> 52:25.760]  A vote that assures a fair election in every jurisdiction and reflects the true will of the
[52:25.760 --> 52:32.080]  people. Federal candidates only. Paper ballots, no computers, hand counted, and it's counted
[52:32.080 --> 52:37.920]  local, precinct, and that's how it's done. It's easier. Hand counted with both parties watching
[52:37.920 --> 52:43.680]  every vote. Only registered votes, photo ID to provide residents, conducted safely with everyone
[52:43.680 --> 52:48.880]  wearing masks and six feet apart, blah, blah, blah. And it goes on from that point. It's on
[52:48.880 --> 52:55.360]  infowars.com, the full letter. It's strong, but not strong enough. It's a CHICOM Globalist Funded
[52:55.360 --> 53:00.640]  Attack. The article is at infowars.com. If you value your freedom, if you value the future,

[53:18.400 --> 53:24.480]  owned by the Communist Chinese government itself and a 400 million out of a secret
[53:24.480 --> 53:32.160]  Swiss bank account on October 7th, less than a month before the election, 27 days before the
[53:32.160 --> 53:38.240]  election. I mean, that is incredible. The documents are all there at infowars.com. Share it.
[53:38.240 --> 53:43.600]  It's from the SEC. You can go find it. If this goes out, this is the total proof,

[53:49.200 --> 53:54.800]  to dig through all this. And they tried to hide it, but they failed. They tried to hide the
[53:54.800 --> 54:00.800]  subsidiary names and subgroups, but we tracked it all back and we have it now. Separately going

[54:49.440 --> 54:53.840]  imposed worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control. That's their
[54:53.840 --> 54:58.720]  stated admitted plan. Justin Trudeau's on record, Klaus Schwab, all the different Democrat mayors,
[54:58.720 --> 55:03.280]  they admit it's clowered in heaven, implode the economy to make us go under their control.
[55:03.280 --> 55:08.240]  But if we expose they're the ones doing it, they go to prison instead of getting total power and
[55:08.240 --> 55:12.560]  total control. And there are major uprisings happening across the world. You're in the U.S.
[55:12.560 --> 55:16.400]  thousands of sheriffs are saying hell no to the lockdowns. People are finally starting to fight
[55:16.400 --> 55:21.840]  back. But regardless, you need to get prepared. We have high quality, swarble food last 25 years,
[55:21.840 --> 55:26.880]  highest quality, lowest prices, great containers ready to ship. But when people figure this out

[55:31.440 --> 55:36.480]  have been going for a few months. So get your orders in today at preparewithalix.com. You get

[55:48.240 --> 55:53.520]  place of the ruling class to consolidate power and control. There's a headline out of zero heads
[55:53.520 --> 56:00.560]  that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global airlines are set to lose $157 billion this year
[56:00.560 --> 56:06.080]  by the end of December. It's already over 130 billion dollars they've lost. Why would they take
[56:06.080 --> 56:12.080]  part in the hoax, in the lockdown, in the hysteria if it hurts them? We'll see. That'll knock out
[56:12.080 --> 56:16.640]  all the smaller lines and it's all they control and it's the same in every single industry. And
[56:16.640 --> 56:21.200]  the big megabanks have unlimited capital. They want to bankrupt the world economy until they buy it
[56:21.200 --> 56:26.400]  up for pennies on the dollar. That's why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned out was
[56:26.400 --> 56:32.160]  engineered by some central banks. This is how the global estate control. It stars the third world
[56:32.160 --> 56:37.760]  of death, makes the first world poor, it's economic warfare and it gives cover to the big megabanks
[56:37.760 --> 56:43.680]  that created thousands of trillions of dollars in fake derivatives. Only the truth will set us free
[56:43.680 --> 56:59.600]  in FullWars.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:04.880 --> 57:10.480]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
[57:10.480 --> 57:18.080]  All right. I rarely play a clip twice in a show, but I'm going to play right now on the head of
[57:18.080 --> 57:24.960]  Dr. Steve Picenic joining us. A report that's at Bandot Video in the John Bounds section.
[57:27.520 --> 57:32.000]  And that is America's Collision Course with Communism. Now, I haven't even gotten to all
[57:32.000 --> 57:38.640]  the latest evidence or Trump's latest lawsuit or all these SEC documents we've got and just
[57:38.640 --> 57:45.920]  the insanity of all of this. Listen, I wish that Joe Biden really would have won for real,
[57:45.920 --> 57:48.800]  because then I wouldn't have to fight so hard. I mean, I wouldn't be happy he won,
[57:48.800 --> 57:52.240]  but I could deal with that. I wish he wasn't a Communist Chinese agent. He is.
[57:53.360 --> 57:59.040]  And we all think of America as invincible, but they have drag queen story time with convicted
[57:59.040 --> 58:03.120]  pedophiles being promoted by the media with your children and many times not announced.
[58:03.120 --> 58:07.680]  I mean, we keep babies alive and sell their organs. America is basically gone. We have to
[58:07.680 --> 58:14.720]  realize that to get it back. We have to repent. So let's go ahead and go to this report that
[58:14.720 --> 58:18.880]  shows the global submitting it all. I'm going to come back and recap the top news and then show
[58:18.880 --> 58:24.400]  you footage of Dominion worker reportedly caught manipulating voter data. What they did was illegal
[58:24.400 --> 58:28.480]  on tape. We actually know who he is. We're not going to release his name yet, but we've got the
[58:28.480 --> 58:34.240]  intel and so do our people. But this is incredible. This will not stand global. As you've been caught,
[58:34.240 --> 58:38.880]  we do not accept your fraudulent leader, your CHICOM agent Joe Biden. You're on notice. Here's the
[58:38.880 --> 58:44.480]  report. To me, it's all positive. I was asked today on a scale of one to 10, who will be
[58:44.480 --> 58:49.760]  the next president. And I said 10, it'll be Donald Trump. It'll be President Trump. There's no doubt
[58:49.760 --> 58:54.880]  in my mind. There's no doubt in my mind that he won this election hands down in a landslide,
[58:54.880 --> 59:02.960]  probably somewhere between 350 and 400 electoral college votes. He was part of those 16 intelligence
[59:02.960 --> 59:08.800]  agencies that is able to see all the intel and the data. And that's why his story is the same
[59:08.800 --> 59:13.040]  thing I tell you. I can read what the globalists say at the CFR and read what G.G. Pink says.
[59:13.680 --> 59:25.600]  The force has stopped the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. The projections are that by
[59:25.600 --> 59:39.680]  2050, that that 70% or the 60% is now with the G7, that 70% will be 35%, 35%. China and India together
[59:40.800 --> 59:47.680]  will be 50% of the global GDP, 50%. We're seeing a move in the next 40 years, the likes of which
[59:47.680 --> 59:56.320]  has not been seen for 200 years. And it's real. And it's real. And we're not preparing for it.
[59:56.320 --> 1:00:03.920]  It turns out that China is going to overtake the United States in 2027. It was said that this might
[1:00:03.920 --> 1:00:09.840]  be delayed for a year or two. But this year, God has pulled off a little trick, right?
[1:00:09.840 --> 1:00:16.240]  God created COVID-19 and spread it to every country in the world. We still
[1:00:16.240 --> 1:00:23.520]  have 4,000 dead, right? But if 4,000 Chinese die versus 220,000 in the United States,
[1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:30.240]  we haven't really lost a single person, have we? In 2012, we achieved absolute superiority over
[1:00:30.240 --> 1:00:36.080]  the U.S. and Japan. We have gained absolute superiority over the U.S. military. And we
[1:00:36.080 --> 1:00:42.640]  are expanding our military at a rate unprecedented in human history. As long as we go to work every
[1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:49.440]  day, we will drive the U.S. to its death. Globalists, man, they teach of the army and
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:54.400]  Marine Corps training centers that America must merge with China for world peace.
[1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:59.440]  We have to prepare for a more angry world. Well, if you listen to Klaus Schwab in the
[1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:06.560]  Debo script and Xi Jinping, the great reset is modeled after the great leap forward.
[1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:11.280]  Theme of this year's summer doubles is shaping innovative societies in the fourth industrial
[1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:16.160]  revolution. What does an innovative society look like on your mind?
[1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:24.720]  We are in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution. Technology will change everything.
[1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:31.040]  Business models, but it will also change society. And we have to be prepared for it.
[1:01:31.040 --> 1:01:39.840]  What is necessary is to make sure that the population absorbs all those changes and understands
[1:01:39.840 --> 1:01:47.280]  that those changes at the end are beneficial for our lives, for the quality of our lives.
[1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:53.920]  From David Rockefeller's own words, he's the guy that opened up China.
[1:02:17.280 --> 1:02:23.600]  Myth that they're doing it for power and control and that they're not even worried about COVID-19.
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:28.160]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said. Think about how to say that as oh,
[1:02:28.160 --> 1:02:31.520]  big tech's got to track you. They've got to trace you. They've got to control you.
[1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:35.120]  You've got to have absolutely your house. You've got to have secret police come
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:40.240]  disappear you because, my God, this thing has 110 to 1 percent chance of killing you.
[1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:44.800]  Give your ability to have cancer or heart attack. This is their takeover.
[1:02:44.800 --> 1:02:49.600]  Imagine on America's death certificate killed by the fear of the common cold.
[1:02:49.600 --> 1:03:15.600]  Yeah, that's fair monitoring. That's my control.
[1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:21.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are living in the most incredible time in world history on so many fronts.
[1:03:21.920 --> 1:03:30.000]  But I got a call from the president's representative and they asked me three weeks ago
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:37.040]  when I was in Arizona. Let's just say one of Trump's sons gave me a call
[1:03:37.920 --> 1:03:42.400]  and he put me in touch with a executive with a major voting machine company. I'm going to leave
[1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:49.040]  it at that. And they said, look, we know Soros, the Chinese are involved. We want you to investigate
[1:03:49.040 --> 1:03:52.880]  it and we want you to separately bring it out. And I said, well, if you know it, why do I have to
[1:03:52.880 --> 1:03:57.520]  find it? And they said, look, I said, oh, because it's classified and I've got to find it myself.
[1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:02.640]  They said, we're not saying that. Well, I got a call two days ago from the security firm I hired
[1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:08.400]  that were former Army internal security researchers. So they're good, good researchers.
[1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:16.320]  And they ferreted out and found that 75 plus percent of a major Swiss UBS bank investment firm
[1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:23.280]  is owned by the Communist Party Central Committee and by one of their major provinces. And that they put
[1:04:24.320 --> 1:04:37.040]  all of this money, 400 million into dominion on October 7th. Now, they didn't even use the names.
[1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:41.760]  They used a bunch of cutout corporations and all of it, but this is confirmed. We've published this
[1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:46.320]  information. And listen, I'm not a guy that skydives. I'm not scared of skydiving. I've
[1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:50.080]  cliff jumped and stuff. I don't risk my life for a reason, but I just want you to know this is
[1:04:50.080 --> 1:04:53.920]  risking my life right now. I mean, if you think Hillary was pissing me before, they're not going
[1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:58.960]  to be happy now. So I just hope you realize what you're looking at. Here's the article.
[1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:04.800]  It's on infowars.com. You notice there's nobody's name on this because people are so scared to
[1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:11.520]  even publish this. A firm that owns Dominican voting systems received 400 million from Swiss bank
[1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:16.160]  that 75 plus percent owned by the Chinese government. It's not just a connection.
[1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:23.360]  And here it all is for you, ladies and gentlemen. So Trump knows all this. The White House knows
[1:05:23.360 --> 1:05:28.880]  all this. And again, they I'm going to leave it at that. I'm just giving you some of the background.
[1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:34.320]  They put me in touch with the top computer scientists and major people. And they just
[1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:39.520]  stay again. It was like kind of like the guessing game here. They wouldn't tell me anything.
[1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:43.920]  They just said, look into China, look into Soros, look into foreign bank accounts.
[1:05:44.560 --> 1:05:49.200]  And holy hell, there it is. Took us almost two and a half weeks to find it.
[1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:56.800]  But we did. And man, is it hundreds of pages of treason? I think this is incredible. Staple
[1:05:56.800 --> 1:06:04.160]  Street, L I L P. And then how it all goes back into the whole thing. So there you go.
[1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:10.560]  And by the way, I can tell you that other big national talk show hosts were given this information,
[1:06:11.200 --> 1:06:19.120]  but have such short leashes on them. They aren't going to tell you this. So this is it. You want
[1:06:19.120 --> 1:06:25.840]  the smoking gun. I mean, you know, you want the CIA putting the gun right to Kennedy's head and pull
[1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:29.120]  the trigger. I mean, this is the equivalent of that. You want hand in the cookie jar.
[1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:33.120]  You walk in, you've, you've thought your neighbor's screwing your wife for a while,
[1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:37.280]  but you walk in, he's on top of her legs behind her ears. You see the whole thing. I mean, this
[1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:44.320]  is it, ladies and gentlemen. This is one trillion percent the smoking gun. And then it just gets
[1:06:44.320 --> 1:06:49.920]  worse from there. The communist Chinese wired through a secret of Swiss bank account, $400
[1:06:49.920 --> 1:06:59.360]  million to the million on October 7th. I mean, wow, I suggest you go get these documents. I
[1:06:59.360 --> 1:07:04.320]  suggest you get them out. And I don't normally say sources and things like that, but you know,
[1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:10.880]  I want you to know how real this is. Okay. We're in such crisis right now that I haven't given up
[1:07:10.880 --> 1:07:16.480]  any confidence that I wasn't supposed to, but that's what's going on. And do you think I'm the
[1:07:16.480 --> 1:07:24.400]  first person they came to know? Everybody else pisses and are yellow bellies. The president isn't,
[1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:29.440]  but he's like a quadriplegic. He's paralyzed. No one will help him. No one below him will do
[1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:34.400]  anything. They're all coward lawyers. He's like, he wants to do something, but he can't move his
[1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:39.360]  arms. So he has to look over a little info wars and give us the message. And then he wants to
[1:07:39.360 --> 1:07:43.440]  follow the law. So he won't tell us what it is. It's classified. And then we have to go around
[1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:49.280]  like little beavers and find it, but we did. Thanks to you supporting us and keeping us on air. So
[1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:54.320]  I don't tell the story about us to even include a Senate. It's important to understand what the
[1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:59.840]  president of the attack level he's under and the amount of scum and cowards. I was talking to people
[1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:04.720]  in the White House last week, they said, and the state department, they said he only had about 30%
[1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:09.360]  of the people, but by the election under him and the government finally following the law and doing
[1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:14.800]  what the president said in the executive, he's down to maybe 10% last week. They're all parling
[1:08:14.800 --> 1:08:19.040]  a new job. They're all abandoning ship to the chai comms at the end of the country. But you see
[1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:23.520]  Lynn Wood came out very prestigious lawyer and he said Trump has to declare martial law. We're
[1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:29.520]  under armed gangs, thugs, communist takeover, Chinese funded. Lincoln, you could say went too
[1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:35.120]  far was a tyrant, but the president's there. I mean, Trump has a thousand times the reasons to go
[1:08:35.120 --> 1:08:40.960]  after this because it's not an insurrection. It's not a rebellion. It's, it's a foreign multinational
[1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:48.400]  takeover of this country. And so the president, if he came out from the resolute desk and said,
[1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:54.080]  it's time to take action and laid all the seven inside, it would be over. So there you have it.
[1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:56.800]  Let me go ahead and show you this clip. We're going to go to break and come back with Dr. Steve
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:01.920]  Pachennick. But here's video. We know who the guy is. We track team Democrat operative. We know
[1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:06.080]  where he worked. McDonald's and GameStop before this. We've not released his photo or his name yet.
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:14.640]  Javier. But we have the footage of him in the Key County illegally, whether he knew it or not,
[1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:18.720]  going up with a thumb drive, taking it out. Same thing, 30 something missing hard drives and thumb
[1:09:18.720 --> 1:09:25.040]  drives in Pennsylvania testified. Here it is. You want more smoking guns? Here it is story.
[1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:33.040]  Dominion worker reportedly caught manipulating voter data in the Key County caught on video.
[1:09:33.040 --> 1:09:37.360]  They reported at the time were told shut up at under state and federal law. This is illegal.
[1:09:37.360 --> 1:09:42.160]  Coming up, getting votes off, coming back later, putting something back on, unbelievable. Here
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:57.920]  it is. She's looking at her cell spreadsheet with notes, handing it to him.
[1:09:57.920 --> 1:10:11.440]  They're boys looking for certain kind of handlers.
[1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:24.560]  He just walks over, kind of slips in the thumb drive, those little something waffles off.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.880]  He's pulling USB out. Did he? Yeah.
[1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:40.240]  Yeah. And now he slinks off with it. Is he taking it to that laptop? Yeah.
[1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:42.720]  And this went on everywhere.
[1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:49.360]  It should not be connected.
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:55.360]  Doing some important work over here, are you?
[1:10:55.360 --> 1:11:03.520]  Hold on a minute. After all, he's just fighting Hitler, right? Trying to get us out of all the
[1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:08.160]  wars. Look at the left battling to keep us in wars. They actually call themselves the rebel
[1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:11.680]  alliance. That guy thinks he's Luke Skywalker, working for the shy cops.
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:21.280]  Does this look like files from a distance, but I can't really tell. And then he wanders off.
[1:11:21.280 --> 1:11:24.640]  They go, yeah, he has a thumb drive big deal. They go, you're not supposed to plug one in
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:28.960]  to the main tabulation computer, by the way. He's at the main tabulation, the whole county.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:35.360]  And then he takes some stuff off, leaves with those, brings them back. What do you think happened?
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:43.280]  If you've ever had a cat and a dog, you know, the dogs get in the cat box
[1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:47.600]  and they're real guilty when they go in there and eat all the crap. And they have this look on
[1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:51.760]  their face. When the guy wanders off, he's wearing a mask and see him. He looks really
[1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:59.760]  suspicious. But notice they've got all the masks and then just now you want, and then later he
[1:11:59.760 --> 1:12:12.480]  comes back. I got a baby bumblebee. He first waits to see if I was going to tackle him and he comes
[1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:19.440]  back. I mean, I shouldn't be laughing, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come right back after
[1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:24.080]  the break. Remember, I won't be here if it isn't for your word of mouth and your prayers. So I
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:27.920]  suggest you share all these articles and breaking videos that are coffin nails if you share them.
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:32.800]  I would flood all the state houses with these videos and articles. I would, I would flood
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:37.760]  everybody and I would go to m4store.com and promo code PATRIOT. It's only going this week during
[1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:42.240]  Cyber Week. Additional 10% off on the already big discounts. You might want to fund the Second
[1:12:42.240 --> 1:12:46.000]  American Revolution. We'll get you great products at the same time. But regardless, all you guys put
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:53.840]  us in attack formation, we'll keep fighting until the end. Stay with us. You can watch a factory
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:13:01.200]  of robots being controlled by wireless internet commands. But if you were a person just 200 years
[1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:05.440]  ago and you saw that, you think it was magic. You wouldn't even know really what the machines were
[1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:10.480]  or what was controlling them. So for that person, it would be spiritual or it would be something of
[1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:16.240]  a spirit. And it's similar to how ducks and butterflies and many other species of animal
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:20.160]  know how to fly thousands and thousands of miles back to the exact place where they were born.
[1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:24.960]  They're following magnetic lines. They have magnetic cells in their brains. We now know
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:29.040]  side difference what's going on. There's even a lot more than that. So when we talk about the spirit,
[1:13:29.920 --> 1:13:32.480]  we're talking about all the dark matter. We're talking about all the things you don't understand,
[1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:37.760]  but we know it's there. And just like you can have a bunch of robots working off a wireless system,
[1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:42.640]  that's what's going on with this satanic transmission that's working through people.
[1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:47.280]  And that's how this entity behind it all is able to direct it because it is a
[1:13:47.280 --> 1:14:11.280]  consciousness manipulative of space-time continuum.
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:22.880]  Both rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints
[1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:29.760]  and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can
[1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:36.000]  stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:42.640]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts
[1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:48.640]  that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at
[1:14:48.640 --> 1:15:14.640]  InfowarsStore.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:38.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the most historic times in world history,
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:44.080]  certainly the most important in American history. Big exclusive article, firm that owns the Minion
[1:15:44.080 --> 1:15:49.520]  voting systems received 400 million from Swiss bank with connection to Chinese government before
[1:15:49.520 --> 1:15:57.680]  election. And imagine the White House knows this, the Pentagon knows this and three weeks ago told
[1:15:57.680 --> 1:16:02.960]  us to investigate it because they weren't going to give us classified information and violate the
[1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:08.720]  law unlike the Democrats. So we went and reverse engineered the whole thing and damn it, we have
[1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:15.680]  the SEC filings Infowars.com. By the way, they've been ongoing DOS and all sorts of attacks from
[1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:19.520]  China trying to shut us down. So I can drive out of my office and they get shot in the head.
[1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:24.320]  Remember, this is a war. This is the real deal, folks need to understand this.
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:29.600]  That shows how paralyzed and cut off the president is that the former deputy attorney general or
[1:16:29.600 --> 1:16:33.920]  acting attorney general is a good guy on Fox right now. He's like, well, none of these state
[1:16:33.920 --> 1:16:38.480]  legislatures or courts will stand up for the president. Well, finally a court said, oh, you can
[1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:42.880]  hold the files for 10 days in Georgia, but they, but now they're saying, oh, no, it's proprietary.
[1:16:42.880 --> 1:16:48.000]  We can't let you do that. You're not the individual who just finally got identified. We weren't going
[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:52.480]  to identify him. Dement, uh, Dominion employee identified, allegedly caught on video downloading
[1:16:52.480 --> 1:17:00.480]  data on USB, plugging into laptop and letting data and then palming the USB and waddling out.
[1:17:00.480 --> 1:17:08.480]  And we've got his name, Javier Corey, as we told you. I wasn't going to break it myself.
[1:17:08.480 --> 1:17:16.080]  Let Gateway Pundit do it. Stay in attack formation. So it's all coming out. So attorney Lynn Wood says
[1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:22.800]  martial law limited to stop this. Well, yeah, this is globalist martial law. Dr. C. Pachennick's
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:28.000]  bestselling author wrote books with Tom Clancy, my major films, ran the state department psychological
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:34.560]  operations, MIT train. He's also a Harvard psychiatrist. You know, I'm Mr. Anti martial law.
[1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:38.720]  You're against the police state as well. This is a globalist corporate police state overthrowing
[1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:43.600]  the country. There was a huge Trump landslide. We know he was getting double triple the numbers he
[1:17:43.600 --> 1:17:50.160]  got of margins of victory, not 1% in battlegrounds, but two, three, four, five, six until they shut
[1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:55.760]  it down. What do you call this moment we're at? Because America knows the truth. It doesn't matter
[1:17:55.760 --> 1:18:01.200]  how long CNN gas lights us. What do you expect to happen here? And is Lynn Wood right? And what would
[1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:07.040]  that martial law look like? Because we know if Trump showed any strength that had federal troops,
[1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:13.120]  SWAT team, Soros and a few of the globalists, they would roll over, piss on themselves and turn
[1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:17.920]  states evidence in five seconds. But instead, we just bow down to the mouse that roars. Dr. Pachennick.
[1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:26.320]  Well, let me remind you that a couple of weeks ago and several months ago, I told you that I was
[1:18:26.320 --> 1:18:36.960]  told by my fellow countrymen in Cybertraman that I was to announce on your show, Owen Shroyer show,
[1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:44.800]  that we had put QFS watermarks on all the ballots. We had monitored all the machines on dominion,
[1:18:44.800 --> 1:18:49.440]  and we had expected everything to come out, and it came out of cyber control.
[1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:57.600]  I don't have the same fear factor that you have, but I do respect you. Number one, we don't need
[1:18:57.600 --> 1:19:04.320]  martial law. What we have in effect now is we have prepared the sting operation, which I announced
[1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:10.560]  here on Alex Jones, because I was given that permission by exactly cyber command. And let
[1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:16.800]  me explain what I mean by that and what is happening from my point of view. Number one,
[1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:24.400]  gentlemen's like Keith Alexander, who was having cyber command, G2 army intelligence, trained
[1:19:24.400 --> 1:19:32.080]  another general by the name of Nakasone. Nakasone is the third generation Japanese-American,
[1:19:32.080 --> 1:19:38.880]  a war hero, four star general who is in the White House, has been in the White House for over four
[1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:48.240]  years, and is the man in charge of having put in all the watermarks, all the cyber indications and
[1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:55.040]  marks on everything that we needed in dominion and everywhere else around the country for us to
[1:19:55.040 --> 1:20:01.280]  monitor all of the irregularities. This was not unexpected. As I said, we had done the same thing
[1:20:01.280 --> 1:20:07.040]  with Hillary Clinton. She remains silent. Some people say you're making this up, you're full
[1:20:07.040 --> 1:20:10.480]  of it. Let me just say what we know. Okay. And I think you're an incredible person. I respect you.
[1:20:10.480 --> 1:20:15.600]  You've been really accurate in the past. So that goes a long way for me. Trump set up a task force,
[1:20:16.320 --> 1:20:21.440]  an executive order on election fraud to track it and control it two years ago. We know, at least
[1:20:21.440 --> 1:20:25.680]  to the software levels, they had Homeland Security and Cyber Command trying to monitor it and Trump
[1:20:25.680 --> 1:20:31.600]  was over at the, at the, you know, naval building where the vice president lives on that night.
[1:20:31.600 --> 1:20:36.160]  We know all that. I know that the White House contacted me and said, look into China and dominion,
[1:20:36.160 --> 1:20:41.120]  ensure as hell there it is in the SEC. So, so, so clearly, I mean, Trump said they're going
[1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:45.600]  to try to steal it and these ballots are fraud. So he said, my only question is how much the
[1:20:45.600 --> 1:20:49.280]  government's loyal, how much isn't, and you know, I just hope that people aren't being
[1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:52.720]  over optimistic to you because they're acting like Biden's about to be sworn in.
[1:20:54.960 --> 1:21:02.880]  I'm not an optimist. I'm a realist. Basically, exactly what I'm told, and I understand what's
[1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:08.640]  happening. People can attack me if they want. They can read my history if they want. I'm not
[1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:15.920]  here to apologize. I'm not here to make excuses. This is what I've been saying all along. I said
[1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:21.920]  that Biden, we knew he was corrupt. Number two, we know that Simon and Schuster will have a
[1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:29.600]  merger with Random House because Simon and Schuster made all of their money from being
[1:21:29.600 --> 1:21:35.440]  anti-Trump. Now, we can stop that if you want, and that's one of the reasons why I go on. It's a
[1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:43.120]  2.2 billion acquisition. At the same time, I can tell you that Nakasone has been running a very
[1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:51.920]  effective monitoring system and that we have deployed military elements all over the country.
[1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:58.080]  I can tell you that in North Florida, the amount of planes that have come in with war equipment,
[1:21:58.080 --> 1:22:05.360]  with a regular army, National Guard, and others has increased markedly. I can tell you that at the
[1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:13.360]  same time, John Roberts of the Supreme Court may have a problem. He is a sick man. He's had a history
[1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:19.920]  of seizures. We know that his interpretation of corruption is what we call the minimalist quid
[1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:27.600]  pro quo corruption, meaning that in many ways, he has allowed corruption in the system to expand
[1:22:27.600 --> 1:22:33.760]  both at the state level and the national level. Trump knew this. At the same time, Trump knew
[1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:40.880]  that Krebs, whoever this gentleman was, went to George Mason University and was head of cybersecurity
[1:22:40.880 --> 1:22:45.840]  at home. Security was not even relevant to the entire situation.
[1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:51.920]  You have the four next segment, but I want you to talk in language. We can all understand. I
[1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:55.760]  get most of what you're saying. The audience is really smart, but maybe you lost some of them.
[1:22:55.760 --> 1:23:01.120]  Give us the prime analysis of where the country is, of what's happening. I'll tell you this.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:06.080]  Trump being in the background, waiting for the courts to take action, is one view of why he's
[1:23:06.080 --> 1:23:11.280]  doing it. Other views are he knows this is really going on, and this is this big sting,
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:16.880]  and he knows he has all this incredible evidence. I hear him on Fox News. I hear the few interviews.
[1:23:16.880 --> 1:23:21.920]  He sounds more confident and more happy than he's ever sounded. So if you're going on body language,
[1:23:21.920 --> 1:23:26.480]  he either knows he's got him or he's being fed a lot of bull, and so are you. But regardless,
[1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:30.240]  we know he set up this whole surveillance system on the election two years ago,
[1:23:30.240 --> 1:23:34.240]  so that is going on. We know there is watermarks at many state levels. The question is,
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:38.400]  was Homeland Security involved in that? Regardless, we now have this smoking gun
[1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:43.280]  out of Switzerland with the Chinese government funding dominion. That's open and shut right
[1:23:43.280 --> 1:23:48.080]  there for me. StevePochinic.com is the website. We'll be right back. StevePochinic, I'm all jokes.
[1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:53.840]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different
[1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:59.200]  mixes of the two. One is born of renaissance. The other is born of conquest. One bases its power
[1:23:59.200 --> 1:24:05.440]  on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity, art
[1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:10.560]  and skill and strength. The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls
[1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:17.600]  with a tiny elite above it. America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty
[1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:22.960]  and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery. That's why the globalists tell us
[1:24:22.960 --> 1:24:27.440]  America was founded on slavery when it wasn't. They point out one of our evils so they can
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:32.320]  invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters. A global permanent lockdown is here
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:35.760]  that is already causing millions and millions of starved to death. When they're done,
[1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:40.160]  billions will starve to death. Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and
[1:24:40.160 --> 1:24:45.200]  a top general have come out and said the covered lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:48.160]  That's the facts. This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[1:24:49.120 --> 1:24:55.680]  PrepareWithAlex.com is a special website with MyPatriot because they have agreements with
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:25:00.320]  other distributors that they all sell the same low-price, high-quality, durable food.
[1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:05.680]  But occasionally they can do promotions on their own platform. That's what we've set up with them
[1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:12.640]  is at PrepareWithAlex.com is a subdomain of MyPatriot. You get an additional 10% off.

[1:25:29.120 --> 1:25:36.960]  other great items, huge discounts that will be ending next Wednesday. That is December 2nd.
[1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:41.520]  So you've got this week and a little bit of next week to get your orders in. They're ready to ship
[1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:45.840]  to you right now and the profit that comes in funds the info war. So it's a 360 win. You need
[1:25:45.840 --> 1:25:50.720]  durable food to fight the great reset. Get prepared now. You know something very sad is happening.
[1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:54.800]  It's very sad because it was all avoidable two and a half years ago when info wars got banned off
[1:25:54.800 --> 1:26:01.200]  of more than 60 major platforms. I warn everybody that was a precedent for the upcoming presidential
[1:26:01.200 --> 1:26:07.040]  election and that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship until
[1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:12.400]  effectively there was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives, nationals and
[1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:16.960]  populace and now that's happened. And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to
[1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:23.360]  arrest individuals that demonstrate in protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown and that Trump
[1:26:23.360 --> 1:26:29.040]  needed to get out front and fully repudiate COVID-19 is basically an overblown hoax. He started to do
[1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:34.160]  that the last few months of the campaign but we have to understand that that's the pincer attack
[1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:38.800]  they're going to use. They're going to use Black Lives Matter and race war to stir up the American
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:42.400]  people and divide us and they're going to use economic warfare shutting down the economy
[1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:47.680]  to try to control us. I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air. Tell me
[1:26:47.680 --> 1:27:05.600]  before what's coming next. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:10.720 --> 1:27:16.800]  Little less talk, little more action. How do they put a course like Joe Biden in who can hardly
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:22.400]  walk or talk? How do they put Kamala Harris who pulled it less than half a percent
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:28.160]  with Democrat voters even lower blacks? I mean she's incredibly disingenuous and faker than a
[1:27:28.160 --> 1:27:34.560]  plastic banana. And then the massive evidence of fraud and the media saying there is no evidence
[1:27:35.280 --> 1:27:42.160]  and it's just founting out like an exploded dam. And then you've got Hunter Biden and the laptop
[1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:47.440]  confirmed, a Chinese agent, his dad bragging he's a Chinese agent, he's a Russian agent,
[1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:52.000]  everything they said about Trump. And then they're up there, oh I'm the office of President-Elect and
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:56.640]  then Trump's going through the process through the states. And I get he wants to go to the Supreme
[1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:00.240]  Court, he knows his political operas, the other states, they're having incredible hearings where
[1:28:00.240 --> 1:28:06.160]  they put on have computer scientists, eyewitnesses of the fraud, you know, they say the counting
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:12.080]  stopped, it doesn't stop, they say water mains break, they don't break. Then they're doing
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:16.000]  a recount and then the Dominion servers crash in Georgia so they can put up fake numbers.
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:21.840]  I mean they have really, I agree that this is a sting by God because down the road Biden and
[1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:24.880]  this attempted theft will just blow up in their face bigger even if they're able to get rid of
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:30.320]  Trump. But if Congress doesn't stand up, if the electors on December 15th, Dr. Steve Pachennick,
[1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:36.240]  don't say no to this fraud, then they will put Biden in and Trump says he'll go. So if there is
[1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:40.080]  these watermarks and all this proof and I believe you talked to those sources who told you,
[1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:44.240]  so I believe you're in good faith, I think you're a good person, when do we see the cards
[1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:48.880]  on the table? What's about to happen? Like why would the White House, see to me this doesn't
[1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:53.520]  mean I'm important, it means the president's quadriplegic politically cut off, why would they
[1:28:53.520 --> 1:29:00.240]  get me to go after Soros and the Chai comms and then it's true, we get the smoking documents,
[1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:03.920]  but it takes us two and a half weeks to get it, why? I mean, if they have this, why?
[1:29:03.920 --> 1:29:11.920]  Let me explain something. The one thing I do and I've done in the past and I've been involved
[1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:19.600]  with the Nixon transition, remember we had a quandary with Nixon, we had a Watergate situation,
[1:29:19.600 --> 1:29:25.200]  we were involved and I was involved in what's called the soft coup, the transfer of power.
[1:29:25.200 --> 1:29:30.640]  Then we had Iran-Contra under Reagan where we had a problem, I had to be involved in that,
[1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:37.440]  we maintained that and quieted it. What I've been told and what I'm saying to you and I appreciate
[1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:43.520]  the fact that you're getting very excited, but the reality is the game has already been played.
[1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:51.120]  What's happening is that Trump anticipated most of this, Trump actually and the intelligence
[1:29:51.120 --> 1:29:58.080]  community really picked you as the source for which I was to announce what they wanted me to
[1:29:58.080 --> 1:30:03.520]  announce and I'm not just a certain person or student because I don't get paid, I'm really
[1:30:03.520 --> 1:30:12.000]  not interested in promotion, I really don't garner anything other than being a citizen warrior and
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:17.200]  you were chosen as the mainstream media as opposed to the New York Times, the post.
[1:30:17.920 --> 1:30:23.760]  So although you're getting excited, what is happening all around you Alex is exactly what
[1:30:23.760 --> 1:30:30.480]  we expected. The New York Times is going under, the Washington Post is going under, Simon and
[1:30:30.480 --> 1:30:37.840]  Schuster is going under and they're trying to make the best of it to make a merger with the other
[1:30:37.840 --> 1:30:45.440]  houses. At the same time, there are arrests being made in Florida, over 300 to 700 people
[1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:52.160]  were arrested in northern Florida, southern Florida in regards to this illegal activity
[1:30:52.160 --> 1:30:58.880]  and pedophilia. That's the other element that we've been looking at. The military has been deployed
[1:30:58.880 --> 1:31:06.080]  all over the United States. We're quiet about it and at the same time I will guarantee you
[1:31:06.080 --> 1:31:12.720]  Biden will not become president of the United States because right now he's wearing possibly
[1:31:12.720 --> 1:31:20.800]  an ankle bracelet because he said he has a little bit of problem on his ankle and he's twisted his
[1:31:20.800 --> 1:31:27.360]  ankle. I don't believe that so. You might look at that problem. So in effect what you're seeing now
[1:31:28.640 --> 1:31:33.680]  that sounds like cute stuff. He's got an ankle bracelet. I mean, I hope so. I hope he gets a
[1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:41.200]  different type of bracelet. But look, I can't get excited the way you can Alex. That's the reason
[1:31:41.200 --> 1:31:46.880]  why I come on. I mean, this is not unusual for me. We've said it a long time ago. Well, I want to
[1:31:46.880 --> 1:31:52.400]  believe you. So in 50 days, I want to tell you this, buddy, I am going to, I'm just going to,
[1:31:53.440 --> 1:31:57.440]  if you're writing 50 days, you are going to be the king of the planet to me. I already really
[1:31:57.440 --> 1:32:01.760]  liked you. You've given me great info over the years. You've been on the show for 19 years. It's
[1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:09.600]  been really accurate info. So I just hope you're right. Well, let me put it this way. What exactly
[1:32:09.600 --> 1:32:15.040]  is the alternative? Is Biden coming in with a history of corruption? No, I get it. If we believe
[1:32:15.040 --> 1:32:18.320]  he's a criminal and going down, that will give people confidence and he'll be defeated. And we
[1:32:18.320 --> 1:32:23.040]  do have incredible evidence. This is insane. The Democrats would try this. Talk about self-destruction.
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:28.880]  Well, but that's exactly what happened. Last time I was on your show, you asked me,
[1:32:28.880 --> 1:32:36.720]  what is the dynamics of the self-destruction? I told you, it's arrogance, the self-aggrandizement,
[1:32:36.720 --> 1:32:43.840]  denial, distortion, and exactly what's happening. And the reason for it is because they can no
[1:32:43.840 --> 1:32:51.040]  longer admit the reality that Trump, whoever he might be, and he's going to be ruthless,
[1:32:51.040 --> 1:32:57.280]  and he is ruthless, but at the same time, he understood when he came into the administration
[1:32:57.280 --> 1:33:04.400]  that it was so corrupt, both Republicans and Democrats were so corrupt that he had to rely.
[1:33:04.400 --> 1:33:08.480]  Okay, then give us a timeline. We're 50 days out. What do you expect to start seeing?
[1:33:08.480 --> 1:33:14.960]  By December 14th, you're going to see the electoral colleges go back to Trump. Basically,
[1:33:14.960 --> 1:33:22.000]  he will remain in power in January. You have special forces, a unit underneath now,
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:25.840]  the Secretary of Defense Miller. We've deployed all the time.
[1:33:25.840 --> 1:33:28.880]  Amala, you did say a month ago, right before the election, you said,
[1:33:28.880 --> 1:33:32.240]  what's there about to replace the Secretary of Defense? All that. You said two months ago,
[1:33:32.240 --> 1:33:35.680]  it happened. So tell me what's going on with that because that's got the left really scared.
[1:33:35.680 --> 1:33:41.440]  Well, it's not an accident. I don't make prognostications like that. I said,
[1:33:41.440 --> 1:33:46.960]  Gina Haspel has to go. She left, but there was going to be more serious repercussions for the
[1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:56.160]  CIA. Esper had to go. He's left. The CIA and Brennan, Obama, Clinton, and the Bushes have
[1:33:56.160 --> 1:34:01.360]  to be held accountable. This is what you're watching. Is that why Brennan said two weeks ago,
[1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:06.160]  Trump's born dangerous and ever must be removed now. We can't leave him until the inauguration
[1:34:06.160 --> 1:34:10.320]  because he looks scared. He's always looked very arrogant. Brennan does. He looks scared now.
[1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:18.080]  He has to be scared, but he knows that the military intelligence, the people I work with,
[1:34:18.080 --> 1:34:25.200]  the Keith Alexander's, and he was put. Keith Alexander went just before at the same time
[1:34:25.200 --> 1:34:32.560]  to Amazon. Now, the reason we put him in Amazon is because Amazon is the largest private cloud
[1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:40.080]  computing service in the world. At the same time, we have his protege, Nakasone, in the White House.
[1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:47.840]  At the same time, I've got Boykin special forces underneath Miller who brought in the special forces
[1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:53.840]  and took it out of the Department of Defense and under the Army and brought it right to the top.
[1:34:53.840 --> 1:35:00.000]  So everything I told you is happening right now. The fact that you're getting excited,
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:06.800]  I can't help that, Alex. I am what I am. I'm a person who says what I know. I can't make up
[1:35:06.800 --> 1:35:11.360]  the stories. If I did, that's why I sell fiction underneath the plants.
[1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:15.840]  Now, I hear you. Well, I mean, I know this. I know this. I got contacted by the White House
[1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:21.120]  and they told me, look into this company, look into the Chinese and sure as hell it was all there.
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:24.960]  And now we're breaking it. So, I mean, I think that just means they probably went to Fox and
[1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:29.200]  everybody else wouldn't break it. But this is the total proof on infowars.com right now. I mean,
[1:35:29.200 --> 1:35:34.000]  Dr. Pachennick, is that not bombshell that the Chinese put in $400 million into Dominion
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:40.800]  a month before the election? No. And the reason why is we knew that Dominion was corrupt. We
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:45.680]  understood exactly what the Chinese and Xi Jinping did. Actually, believe it or not,
[1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:52.800]  because of your show and that video that I did with you, it was sent to China. And believe it
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:36:00.720]  or not, I got a call from what I call my Chinese nanny who's been my control officer in China for
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:08.160]  the past 30 years. That means President Xi and the Public Bureau of Safety in China personally
[1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:15.120]  had to call me up three weeks ago because of the show that I went on on your show, Alex,
[1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:21.360]  to explain that they are not looking for any trouble to say that it was an excellent show,
[1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:26.080]  meaning that they don't want to get into a problem situation. Whatever their
[1:36:27.040 --> 1:36:32.000]  investments are in Dominion, you have to understand one thing. Dominion was a corrupt
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:37.120]  company from its very start. Stay there. Let's talk about what you see happening next, Pachennick.
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:40.480]  And I pray to God you're right because I know the evidence is overwhelming. But this is just
[1:36:40.480 --> 1:36:46.800]  incredible. Steve Pachennick.com's website, infowars.com is ours. Get the Dominion article out, folks.
[1:36:48.400 --> 1:36:52.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope we can stop the great reset. That means a globalist-imposed
[1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:57.280]  worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control. That's their state-admitted
[1:36:57.280 --> 1:37:02.320]  plan. Justin Trudeau's on record, Klaus Schwab, all the different Democrat mayors. They admit
[1:37:02.320 --> 1:37:07.200]  it's clowered in heaven, implode the economy to make us go under their control. But if we expose
[1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:11.760]  they're the ones doing it, they go to prison instead of getting total power and total control.
[1:37:11.760 --> 1:37:15.920]  And there are major uprisings happening across the world. You're in the U.S., thousands of
[1:37:15.920 --> 1:37:19.840]  sheriffs are saying hell no to the lockdowns. People are finally starting to fight back.
[1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:24.720]  But regardless, you need to get prepared. We have high-quality, swarble food last 25 years,
[1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:29.760]  highest quality, lowest prices, great containers ready to ship. But when people figure this out
[1:37:29.760 --> 1:37:34.320]  in a few months, I think there'll be long lines again to get swarble food after the lockdowns
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:39.360]  have been going for a few months. So get your orders in today at PrepareWithAlex.com. You get
[1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:44.400]  an additional 10% off when they're ready to ship. The sale ends next Wednesday, or I guess
[1:37:44.400 --> 1:38:10.400]  that's December 2nd. So get your orders in now. PrepareWithAlex.com.
[1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:15.040]  And once you understand that basic psychological point, every other answer is completely clear.
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:19.680]  That's why they hate InfoWars. We believe in humanity. We think you're beautiful.
[1:38:19.680 --> 1:38:25.280]  We think you're amazing. InfoWars knows you're falling, but that you have God's potential
[1:38:25.280 --> 1:38:30.320]  that God gave you. Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here. It's now upon us.
[1:38:30.320 --> 1:38:33.440]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about InfoWars now more than ever,
[1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:37.680]  when the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth. We know you're going to override these
[1:38:37.680 --> 1:38:41.280]  globalists. We know you're going to defeat them. I just want to salute you all for your action,
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:45.680]  everything you've already done, because God's on our side and the globalists know it.
[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:56.720]  Back in 1996, the head of the World Food Program said that they would use food and global lockdowns
[1:38:56.720 --> 1:39:02.720]  due to a virus scare to bring in world government. That also came out in the North American Union
[1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:08.320]  documents that Judicial Watch and Lou Dobbs got more than 15 years ago as well. So we know they're
[1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:12.080]  playing. And if they're able to keep this lockdown going, it's going to cause not just a worldwide
[1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:17.280]  depression, but mass starvation of hundreds of millions, millions have already starved to death,
[1:39:17.280 --> 1:39:22.000]  not from COVID, but from the lockdown. That's why it's important for people in North America
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:25.680]  to get prepared all over the world. But we have high-quality swarble food,
[1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:31.840]  ready to ship to you the last 25 years, and prepare with alex.com. There's an additional 10%
[1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:38.160]  off of a very rare sale. It's going right now. Prepare with alex.com. Also at infowars.com,
[1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:42.240]  we have all the great supplements that boost your immune system and so much more with free shipping
[1:39:42.240 --> 1:39:48.080]  as well up to 60% off. Take advantage of that at infowarstore.com and prepare with alex.com.
[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:54.960]  God bless. The great reset. Where have I heard of that before? Oh, the great leap forward,
[1:39:54.960 --> 1:40:00.640]  now say tongue, ordering all the small towns and small farms to basically shut down and have the
[1:40:00.640 --> 1:40:05.760]  rural people and the small business people move into the big cities and go under communist commune
[1:40:05.760 --> 1:40:10.080]  control. And that's all this is. The big mega banks want to break us to the same ones that put
[1:40:10.080 --> 1:40:14.080]  mousey tongue into power. And they're creating the process of getting rid of our old economy and
[1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:19.120]  bringing in the new economy where everything's free because when you're a prisoner, well,
[1:40:19.120 --> 1:40:23.760]  everything's free, but you're also a slave. Scotland is going to have universal guaranteed
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:28.160]  incomes now of subsistence level. But of course, you got to take those vaccines. You can't have
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:34.480]  any kids and oh, don't worry though, all of the tampons and stuff like that's free too as well.
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:38.960]  I'm not kidding. So give me some free paper. They give me enough money to basically live
[1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:43.520]  in a tiny apartment, but they own you. They control you. That's the great reset. That's why
[1:40:43.520 --> 1:40:47.840]  it's got to be resisted to total takeover and we're fighting it at info wars.com.
[1:40:47.840 --> 1:41:12.080]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm not going to be playing hooky in the next two hours when Paul
[1:41:12.080 --> 1:41:18.720]  Joseph Watson has Candace Owens an amazing guest on. I am so busy with breaking news and documents
[1:41:18.720 --> 1:41:26.880]  and Intel that I have to go off air and tomorrow we'll have giant breaking news here for you on
[1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:30.800]  air with the information I'm going to be getting, but it's so huge. I'm going to have to go off
[1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:35.040]  air in about 10 minutes. Paul Joseph Watson will take over. I'll probably be back on the
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:39.920]  rural room this evening, but you'll see some of the big news tomorrow on multiple fronts.
[1:41:39.920 --> 1:41:43.760]  We're entering that zeitgeist point and Steve Pachennick, you know, has, has
[1:41:45.440 --> 1:41:49.760]  never really steered us wrong on things. I hope he's right, but this is what I do know.
[1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:57.520]  I am a public figure. So I, I get a gauge of the public and I went from, you know, every
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:42:01.600]  hundredth hand I shake. Somebody's saying FQ Russian agent. That never even happens anymore.
[1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:06.640]  And now it's young women. It's black people. It's Hispanics. It's, it's old people. It's,
[1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:12.240]  it's Asians. It's Muslims. Info wars is totally in the zeitgeist. I can't walk down the street
[1:42:12.240 --> 1:42:16.480]  now. The cars just start stopping. Okay. And that's not about Alex is a big guy. I'm great.
[1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:21.520]  That's people are really away. And so at a sick Machiavellian level, I hope they actually try
[1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:26.400]  to put Biden in because he's so unpopular and it's such a joke to put Skeletor in there. No one's
[1:42:26.400 --> 1:42:31.440]  going to buy it. So that's something that's positive that should be added. I mean, I mean,
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:35.120]  here's an example. We don't really promote our radio affiliates, TV and cable affiliates,
[1:42:35.120 --> 1:42:38.080]  because the left targets them and harasses them. So we don't put a list of them up.
[1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:45.920]  We're gaining 20 cable systems a week right now. We're gaining TV stations every day. I was just
[1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:52.160]  back there looking at a map this week over a hundred cable systems as people leave Fox News
[1:42:52.160 --> 1:42:57.680]  and the rest of it around the country. So I want you to know keeping us on air is so critical
[1:42:57.680 --> 1:43:00.880]  because we get these cable systems. These are new viewers. They don't buy the products. It's you,
[1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:05.920]  the original hardcore audience that buy the products at m4store.com. 10% off with promo code
[1:43:06.800 --> 1:43:14.320]  Patriot on top of all the other big discounts. X2, X3, DNA Force Plus, Ultra 12, the DNA Force,
[1:43:14.320 --> 1:43:19.680]  the PQQ, the CoQ10 sold out for a year because of the shutdowns and things. We now have Alpha
[1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:23.200]  Power for your libido. You're standing people up so much that's back in stock. But just keep
[1:43:23.200 --> 1:43:28.160]  financially supporting us because we're having fabulous success despite the bands online with
[1:43:28.160 --> 1:43:34.320]  radio stations, TV stations, cable stations, and just huge audience increase five-fold, you know,
[1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:39.120]  what we had just a year ago on our own streams. So thank God for your prayers and support. But
[1:43:39.120 --> 1:43:44.400]  now's the time to fund us more than ever because I'm spending everything I've got in this fight.
[1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:48.640]  Dr. Steve Pachennick, we really appreciate you. I'm trying to give people the truth to good news.
[1:43:48.640 --> 1:43:53.440]  I'm seeing a major bellwether however this cookie crumbles. But other key points you'd like to add
[1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:56.560]  about what's coming up, what you think the American people should be doing right now.
[1:43:56.560 --> 1:44:04.960]  Number one, let's remember it was on your show that I said a year ago or two years ago,
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:10.720]  John Bolton should never been brought into the White House. That turned out to be correct.
[1:44:10.720 --> 1:44:17.680]  It was on your show that I said Tony Fauci is totally out of control. He was my intern at
[1:44:17.680 --> 1:44:24.320]  Cornell University Medical College. I said he's an excellent medical doctor that has no capability
[1:44:24.320 --> 1:44:31.120]  to run an epidemic. It was I who ran the epidemic for Ebola. There was no one on the Biden team who
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:37.920]  ran the epidemic for Ebola because I had to use the military. So I'm telling you, Beijing called
[1:44:37.920 --> 1:44:44.800]  me directly because of the show that you're doing right now. And we wanted to use you as the main
[1:44:44.800 --> 1:44:51.840]  thoroughfare for that announcement. The last part that you have to know is that ironically,
[1:44:51.840 --> 1:45:00.960]  one of my neighbors in Northern Florida increased the fencing and the size of Gitmo by 200%.
[1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:07.680]  In other words, I have a neighbor who's in charge of wire and fencing for prisons.
[1:45:08.400 --> 1:45:18.080]  And he went to Gitmo a year ago and increased the size of Gitmo, Guantanamo Bay by over 100%.
[1:45:18.080 --> 1:45:24.800]  Why did the Justice Department a week ago change it to add electric chair and hanging and firing
[1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:33.040]  squad again? Because Trump, let me go back to the point, Trump understood exactly what was about
[1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:39.920]  to happen. A month ago, I said to you, he's Sun Tzu. The art of war is to allow your enemies to
[1:45:39.920 --> 1:45:47.360]  make all those mistakes. A year ago or two years ago, he had passed a national executive order
[1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:53.600]  including the concept of treason and national treason. And what you're seeing now,
[1:45:54.160 --> 1:45:58.080]  forget the Chinese influence, what you're seeing now. So is this like one of fish bites on the
[1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:04.080]  line? You let them run with it until they get tired? Correct. And what's happening now in every
[1:46:04.080 --> 1:46:13.680]  state, every county, we know the governors, the political operatives, the people on the ground
[1:46:13.680 --> 1:46:18.720]  who are corrupt. This is a massive, massive... Why do you think that federal judge,
[1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:24.400]  Batten, first said yes, save the servers, then don't save the servers and said yes,
[1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:33.680]  do save them in the same day three times? That's unprecedented. Because we already know which
[1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:40.240]  servers have been compromised. We know exactly what has been happening. There's a reason why
[1:46:40.240 --> 1:46:46.880]  my military intelligence and non-civilian intelligence was brought in. And what you
[1:46:46.880 --> 1:46:53.600]  have to understand, and I've said it to you since 9-11, this is the payback from all of those of
[1:46:53.600 --> 1:47:01.040]  us who served in the military and particularly military intelligence for the 9-11 false flags
[1:47:01.040 --> 1:47:06.960]  created by the Bushists, the concepts and the irregularities created by the Clintons,
[1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:13.920]  the total nonsense narrative created by Brennan and Obama, who was nothing more than a
[1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:20.640]  Manchurian candidate. This is all the payback for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that we
[1:47:20.640 --> 1:47:26.720]  didn't have to go to. You have to understand it on the level of those of us who had to go overseas
[1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:33.440]  to fight wars that were created by the CIA. And let me go back to the greatest president,
[1:47:33.440 --> 1:47:42.400]  we had Eisenhower, who once said in the 1950s that the CIA has created a legacy of ashes
[1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:49.200]  unknown in the history of this country. That's 1950s. So you imagine what's been happening
[1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:56.320]  for the next 50 years that was created by the CIA, political operatives like the Bushists,
[1:47:56.320 --> 1:48:05.200]  the Clintons, the Obamas, and so forth and so on. So this has been going on for 40 to 50 years,
[1:48:05.200 --> 1:48:13.040]  and we were fortunate, or God sent us, a man who was a businessman who decided to help us out,
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:21.200]  thanks to his wife, Melania and his sons, Eric and Trump Jr. and all the others, Ivanka and all
[1:48:21.200 --> 1:48:26.480]  the other people in his family. They came forth to serve the country, not to serve themselves.
[1:48:26.480 --> 1:48:31.040]  No, we know Trump's lost most his wealth during this, but I go there in the breaks. Fox News
[1:48:31.040 --> 1:48:35.120]  has Biden measuring the drapes, and they're like, well, Trump will still be powerful as a Republican
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:39.920]  leader. I mean, even Fox News says Trump's done. So I don't, what happens if you're right and all
[1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:44.720]  this gaslighting fails? Is that just totally in the mainstream media, the zombie media, because
[1:48:44.720 --> 1:48:50.160]  the dinosaur media, because they'll be, I mean, they are just completely committed fraudulently
[1:48:50.160 --> 1:48:56.000]  that Joe Biden is the president of what? Well, I think correct. First of all, what happens to
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:49:05.280]  dinosaurs? They died. They eliminated. Alex, when I said to you 20 years ago, we had decided to use
[1:49:05.280 --> 1:49:12.240]  you as the main channel. I've said it repeatedly. Alternative media, the Alex Jones show became
[1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:19.760]  mainstream media. Now, how did that happen over 20 years where increasingly the New York Times
[1:49:19.760 --> 1:49:30.560]  was funded with more money? Became irrelevant. ABC, NBC, CBS irrelevant. All the TV shows irrelevant.
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:37.680]  Hollywood dead. What happened? Netflix. What's happened? Alex Jones, just what we predict.
[1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:43.520]  But don't they get that the more they lie, people go with the opposite of what they say?
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:47.840]  They're not even smart enough to Machiavelli say the truth because the public would then go against
[1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:53.920]  it. They just are so arrogant that keep lying, lying, lying, lying, lying. Because you got to
[1:49:53.920 --> 1:50:02.320]  remember something, Alex. When you're addicted to a lie, when you're addicted to the same phrases
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:08.320]  that you live by, remember all of these politicians, you're talking about thousands of them all over
[1:50:08.320 --> 1:50:12.800]  the United States, Republicans and Democrats. They're in their own rut. They're in their own bubble.
[1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:19.440]  It's not only their own bubble. They're used to paying off for what they need. They're used to
[1:50:19.440 --> 1:50:26.240]  manipulation. They're used to cronyism. They're used to using all kinds of favors to get into
[1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:34.400]  position. The very nature of politics is nothing more than kind of a harsh element. You basically
[1:50:34.400 --> 1:50:40.400]  sell yourself to the highest bidder to come into a process that really has no outcome,
[1:50:40.400 --> 1:50:43.920]  whether it's... Oh, I learned that. I had so many, they quit years ago. They come out and say,
[1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:46.720]  what's your price? The price went up and up. I said, the price is freedom.
[1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:51.280]  Dr. Pachennick, God bless you. We'll talk to you as soon as tpachennick.com. Have a great week coming
[1:50:51.280 --> 1:51:00.000]  up. You too. All right. Man, I hope he's right. We've got Paul Joseph Watson coming up with Candice
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:04.400]  Owens. That's going to be interesting. Two hours. I'm going to go work on all these big stories.
[1:51:04.400 --> 1:51:09.520]  We've got the big story I barely talked about where the hospital executive, 35 major hospital
[1:51:09.520 --> 1:51:14.480]  groups, Pennsylvania, the main hospital group, Pennsylvania, said it's all a fraud and that
[1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:18.960]  nobody's died and that they're totally empty. I mean, this is just smoking gun stuff. That's on
[1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:28.560]  infowars.com. That Dominion's ChaiCom owned Swiss bank accounts. I mean, holy mackerel Toledo.
[1:51:29.120 --> 1:51:35.760]  I mean, this is just insane. Wow. I got a few more things to say than Paul Watson takes over. Stay with us.
[1:51:35.760 --> 1:51:42.880]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[1:51:43.520 --> 1:51:49.120]  because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support,
[1:51:49.680 --> 1:51:54.080]  and for word of mouth. And then we're all this together. And I, you know, it gets old having
[1:51:54.080 --> 1:51:57.920]  to come to you and say, Hey, I got great products, please bomb or we won't be here on air. But it's
[1:51:57.920 --> 1:52:01.760]  true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[1:52:01.760 --> 1:52:06.480]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors. And they've harassed and almost shut down
[1:52:06.480 --> 1:52:10.480]  everybody else. They crippled all the other groups. And we're still here. And as this whole new
[1:52:10.480 --> 1:52:15.360]  world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken
[1:52:15.360 --> 1:52:19.120]  off air. That's why America has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other nations
[1:52:19.120 --> 1:52:24.080]  enslaved and America still quasi free. You can't have info wars has been proven right,
[1:52:24.080 --> 1:52:28.880]  being on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold. Because if you think stuff's bad now,
[1:52:28.880 --> 1:52:34.080]  just get ready. So thank you all and get an info wars.com, get some great 2020 election shirts,
[1:52:34.080 --> 1:52:37.360]  supplements and so much more. They're wonderful products. Yeah, they support the info. We're
[1:52:37.360 --> 1:52:43.760]  thank you. There is an economic war taking place of the ruling class to consolidate power and
[1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:48.320]  control. There's a headline out from zero heads that breaks down Bloomberg numbers that global
[1:52:48.320 --> 1:52:55.920]  airlines are set to lose $157 billion this year by the end of December. It's already over 130
[1:52:55.920 --> 1:53:02.960]  billion dollars they've lost. Why would they take part in the hoax in the lockdown in the hysteria
[1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:07.040]  if it hurts them? We'll see that'll knock out all the smaller lines and solidate control and
[1:53:07.040 --> 1:53:11.840]  it's the same in every single industry. And the big megabanks have unlimited capital. They want
[1:53:11.840 --> 1:53:16.800]  to bankrupt the world economy, build a buy it up for pennies on the dollar. That's why the great
[1:53:16.800 --> 1:53:21.600]  stock market crash of 29 later turned out was engineered by some central banks. This is how
[1:53:21.600 --> 1:53:27.200]  the global estate control. It stars the third world to death, makes the first world poor,
[1:53:27.200 --> 1:53:32.720]  its economic warfare and it gives cover to the big megabanks to create thousands of trillions
[1:53:32.720 --> 1:53:37.440]  of dollars in fake derivatives. Only the truth will set us free info wars.com.
[1:53:37.440 --> 1:53:47.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.

[2:00:53.920 --> 2:00:59.840]  news i'm delighted to be welcomed by somebody who needs no introduction the website for the purposes
[2:00:59.840 --> 2:01:08.480]  of this conversation is factcheckzuk.com headline here out of fox news can this oans targets facebook
[2:01:08.480 --> 2:01:14.800]  third party fact checkers with lawsuit she says i decided i was not going to give up and sit down
[2:01:15.520 --> 2:01:20.880]  she is a new york times bestselling author of the book blackout which has just been released
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:25.520]  recently of course founder of the black zit movement as well we'll talk about that later on
[2:01:25.520 --> 2:01:33.360]  in the show can this welcome back it's good to be back pjw first person who ever had me on his
[2:01:33.360 --> 2:01:40.240]  show ever it's good to see you again can this now i want to get into this you fighting the fact
[2:01:40.240 --> 2:01:44.560]  checkers because this is something that's happened relatively recently it's kind of flown under the
[2:01:44.560 --> 2:01:51.360]  radar what with all the election news you're basically saying it's time to fact check the fact
[2:01:51.360 --> 2:01:57.360]  checkers i want to go on and talk about this development with polity fact having to publicly
[2:01:57.360 --> 2:02:03.600]  back down but first you you're taking legal action against usa today and this group called
[2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:09.840]  lead stories fact checker just tell us what prompted this initial lawsuit in the first place
[2:02:09.840 --> 2:02:15.760]  yeah so it's a very interesting story and basically i had published an article onto
[2:02:15.760 --> 2:02:20.480]  my facebook page that was written by a guy named dr john lee who writes for the spectator
[2:02:21.200 --> 2:02:27.040]  and it was basically him just you know he's a former nhs pathologist you know very strong
[2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:32.720]  resume is a doctor and can of course write his opinion on the cobit 19 sort of scare tactics
[2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:36.960]  that we see in in the article he basically just did a deep dive on how they were calculating
[2:02:36.960 --> 2:02:44.480]  cobit 19 deaths to expose you know just sort of the fraudulence behind it and people were dying
[2:02:44.480 --> 2:02:48.720]  and they were doing postmortem testing for this virus which they had never done before which of
[2:02:48.720 --> 2:02:53.760]  course was flopping the numbers and i published this onto my facebook page and it got back checked
[2:02:53.760 --> 2:03:00.240]  and it got removed by lead stories llc so i look into lead stories llc and lo and behold
[2:03:00.240 --> 2:03:08.880]  it turns out um that a cnn editor of 26 years in 2015 decided to leave cnn and start lead stories
[2:03:08.880 --> 2:03:15.040]  llc um and somehow scored one of the biggest contracts ever with facebook to become a legal
[2:03:15.040 --> 2:03:20.240]  fact checker his name is alan duke and as soon as i saw this i went this is crazy and i went through
[2:03:20.240 --> 2:03:25.040]  the proper means i contacted facebook and said um you know i want this to move from my account what
[2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:29.680]  i said was not false um and he basically wrote an article declaring it was false because he
[2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:34.640]  had found another doctor that disagreed so basically this was a game of my doctor is better than your
[2:03:34.640 --> 2:03:39.200]  doctor but i'm lead stories and i work for facebook so i'm going to be able to censor you
[2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:44.720]  and that's pointedly ridiculous um and so i contacted lead stories and contacted facebook and
[2:03:44.720 --> 2:03:49.760]  went through the means of their process where you're allowed to say okay well uh you can appeal it and
[2:03:49.760 --> 2:03:54.320]  of course he came back and was basically like i'm a god and i've decided that this is still false
[2:03:54.320 --> 2:03:59.280]  but i'll remove it from false to kind of false and i just wasn't happy with that um so i decided you
[2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:03.680]  know what let's put these guys through discovery uh said to my husband i want to i want to go after
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:08.640]  them i want to sue them and i want to expose who exactly these fact checkers are um and and just
[2:04:08.640 --> 2:04:13.360]  really understand how they got these contracts how they got this contract with facebook and facebook
[2:04:13.360 --> 2:04:17.920]  immediately um distance themselves from the fact checkers they wrote my lawyer back the letter
[2:04:17.920 --> 2:04:22.640]  was like we have nothing to do with these third party fact checkers great okay so if you're saying
[2:04:22.640 --> 2:04:27.280]  now that we can just go after the fact checkers one by one and sue them i'm happy to do that as
[2:04:27.280 --> 2:04:32.800]  well so um because he didn't change the false rating we went after the usa today for another uh
[2:04:32.800 --> 2:04:37.760]  scenario that was similar to that one which made no sense it was basically an opinion check um and
[2:04:37.760 --> 2:04:42.640]  we're you know we hired Todd McMurtry who represented the Covington Catholic Nick Sandman
[2:04:42.640 --> 2:04:48.880]  with some great success and we are going after the fact checkers plain and simple now to make it
[2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:54.000]  clear you've got four million followers on facebook they demonetize your entire account
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:05:00.160]  after this initial fact check post did you get re-monetized or is it still demonetized because
[2:05:00.160 --> 2:05:05.120]  we have to make people understand here according to the Washington Times report because of your
[2:05:05.120 --> 2:05:10.720]  contract with facebook which they agreed to you make around a million dollars a month off of your
[2:05:10.720 --> 2:05:16.720]  facebook account by means of this fact check it got demonetized of course we know along with that
[2:05:16.720 --> 2:05:22.240]  your entire account gets relegated in the algorithm they're interfering with your book sales you've
[2:05:22.240 --> 2:05:27.840]  got a new book out that's again being relegated in the algorithm people seeing that because of this
[2:05:28.720 --> 2:05:32.800]  parasitical fact checking company which is not just trying to
[2:05:32.800 --> 2:05:37.920]  demean you in terms of your reputation they're literally stealing content and they're stealing
[2:05:37.920 --> 2:05:43.280]  revenue from your facebook account because it was demonetized as a result of this correct
[2:05:43.920 --> 2:05:47.840]  that's exactly right because don't forget when they issue that false rating they then direct
[2:05:47.840 --> 2:05:52.720]  traffic from your page to their site because they say this is why it's false and usually what they
[2:05:52.720 --> 2:05:57.440]  put up is completely not even addressing what you initially put up you know they get around it and
[2:05:57.440 --> 2:06:02.400]  say something ridiculous where they go well this is this is false because this doctor this is literally
[2:06:02.400 --> 2:06:08.240]  what they wrote on that post this doctor in uh colorado disagrees with dr john lee in in the
[2:06:08.240 --> 2:06:13.920]  uk therefore we're going to say this is false and you know my average post uh and this is without
[2:06:13.920 --> 2:06:19.200]  being monetized this is with them shadow banning me i'll usually get three million people looking
[2:06:19.200 --> 2:06:24.400]  at each of my facebook posts so that that directs three million people to their site where they have
[2:06:24.400 --> 2:06:29.440]  advertisement and they earn money i mean it's completely parasitic behavior and they do this
[2:06:29.440 --> 2:06:32.720]  just because they decide they're the fact check gods and what we really know is that they're not
[2:06:32.720 --> 2:06:38.480]  actually checking facts they're checking against what they deem to be wrong think right and wrong
[2:06:38.480 --> 2:06:44.000]  think is anything that goes against the preferred leftist mainstream narrative um and i mean you
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  could do could write something like only women can have birth only women can give birth and you can
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:54.320]  get fact check and they can pull that down and they can say well we found this guy john doe
[2:06:54.320 --> 2:06:58.480]  out in utah who disagrees and says men can give birth and that's enough for them to fact check you
[2:06:58.480 --> 2:07:03.120]  and demonetize your page um and to me it's pointedly ridiculous and i'm prepared to fight them because
[2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:09.040]  i have the platform and the means to do so and again this isn't with the background of course
[2:07:09.040 --> 2:07:14.880]  you were placed on this hate agent list by facebook i think last year that came out or even the year
[2:07:14.880 --> 2:07:21.600]  before of course i was banned entirely back in may 2019 because they called me a dangerous individual
[2:07:22.160 --> 2:07:27.520]  again i'm still in the process of suing facebook simply to get information out of them what they
[2:07:27.520 --> 2:07:32.640]  hold on me which in the uk is the law that you have to have have access to that by law they've
[2:07:32.640 --> 2:07:39.520]  delayed that for over a year citing coronavirus most recently but we also had again these dangerous
[2:07:39.520 --> 2:07:45.920]  persons being put on this list incredibly a couple of weeks later facebook came out with a fat war
[2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:50.720]  which said it's acceptable it's unacceptable to incite violence against anyone using their
[2:07:50.720 --> 2:07:57.120]  platform except if the person is on their dangerous individuals list of course i was on that list
[2:07:57.120 --> 2:08:03.680]  along with people like laura luma myla unopolis alex jones and others literally inciting people
[2:08:03.680 --> 2:08:08.640]  to organize and commit violence using their service by saying it was okay and then you
[2:08:08.640 --> 2:08:13.840]  made the point earlier about you know you you go after facebook and they pass it off and say oh
[2:08:13.840 --> 2:08:18.480]  it's the third party we have we have no relation to them what we're not responsible for their
[2:08:18.480 --> 2:08:23.520]  activities similar thing with wikipedia i don't know if you've found this can this but you've
[2:08:23.520 --> 2:08:29.760]  probably been in battles with wikipedia over the past four or five years recently some bright
[2:08:29.760 --> 2:08:36.960]  sparks and leftist editor at wikipedia decided to call me a political extremist and now i'm forever
[2:08:36.960 --> 2:08:43.280]  defined as a political extremist the source for that is of course bias for left news outlets and
[2:08:43.280 --> 2:08:50.400]  mark zuckerberg and facebook itself so once you get defined as this hateful individual by facebook
[2:08:50.400 --> 2:08:55.760]  which of course is completely bias in its approach to all this then that suddenly becomes a neutral
[2:08:55.760 --> 2:09:02.880]  source then that suddenly becomes used by wikipedia editors all but you can't sue wikipedia because
[2:09:02.880 --> 2:09:07.600]  that's not a good organization apparently but then when you try and go and sue the editors
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:14.080]  they get protected by wikipedia if you go after them so across the board it's creating this miasma
[2:09:14.080 --> 2:09:20.080]  about not knowing who to go after legally right that's exactly right and and that's why we wanted
[2:09:20.080 --> 2:09:24.640]  we actually wanted facebook to distance themselves in a letter which is what they did we wanted them
[2:09:24.640 --> 2:09:28.400]  to say we had nothing to do with the fact checkers because then you're saying to the fact checkers
[2:09:28.400 --> 2:09:31.520]  i mean what is the upside of being a fact checker for facebook if you can be
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:39.840]  all right i think we lost kandace there but we're going to break now we'll come right back and talk
[2:09:39.840 --> 2:10:00.240]  about this and more submit dot news now it's easier than ever to have band dot video on your iphone

[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:54.880]  worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control that's their stated admitted plan
[2:10:54.880 --> 2:10:59.840]  just introduce on record claus swab all the different democrat mayors they admit it's clowered
[2:10:59.840 --> 2:11:04.880]  and pivot implode the economy to make us go to their control but if we expose they're the ones
[2:11:04.880 --> 2:11:09.200]  doing it they go to prison instead of getting total power and total control and there are
[2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:14.000]  major uprisings happening across the world during the us thousands of sheriffs are saying hell no
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:19.120]  to the lockdowns people are finally starting to fight back but regardless you need to get prepared
[2:11:19.120 --> 2:11:24.960]  we have high-quality swarble food last 25 years highest quality lowest prices great containers
[2:11:24.960 --> 2:11:29.520]  ready to ship but when people figure this out in a few months i think they'll be long lines again to

[2:11:34.480 --> 2:11:39.920]  get prepared with alex dot com get an additional 10 off and they're ready to ship the sale ends
[2:11:39.920 --> 2:11:44.720]  next wednesday or i guess that's december 2nd so get your orders in now prepare with alex dot com
[2:11:47.920 --> 2:11:50.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:11:50.560 --> 2:12:02.960]  you're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[2:12:08.960 --> 2:12:15.120]  and we are back live with paul joseph watson summit dot news we're talking about fact checking
[2:12:15.120 --> 2:12:19.520]  the fact check is of course a major example of this that i personally experienced back in
[2:12:20.240 --> 2:12:26.000]  april 2019 before i was banned on facebook so this actually applied to facebook at the time
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:31.200]  and this mirrors what can this experience with her facebook page being demonetized
[2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:37.840]  by this fact checking agency lead stories placing a hoax alert on their article which
[2:12:37.840 --> 2:12:43.520]  talked about her facebook post which was simply a post of a doctor speaking common sense about
[2:12:43.520 --> 2:12:51.200]  coronavirus in my case it was related to the notre dame cathedral fire in paris there was
[2:12:51.200 --> 2:12:58.480]  widespread celebrations from a certain demographic islamists and muslims on facebook you could go
[2:12:58.480 --> 2:13:05.680]  to arty's arabic facebook page france 24 arabic there was a live video stream of notre dame cathedral
[2:13:05.680 --> 2:13:12.000]  burning and you could watch in real time the gleeful responses from these muslims and islamists
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:16.080]  and you could tell they were muslims and islamists because they were speaking arabic they had muslim
[2:13:16.080 --> 2:13:21.920]  names and it was smiley face emoji smiley face emoji excited emoji clapping emoji
[2:13:21.920 --> 2:13:28.320]  that was their response in droves to the ongoing fire the burning of the notre dame cathedral
[2:13:28.320 --> 2:13:33.680]  so i put out an article about that with the screenshots from the facebook posts and bus
[2:13:33.680 --> 2:13:39.440]  feed which is another fact checker that facebook uses put out a whole article claiming that this
[2:13:39.440 --> 2:13:45.680]  was a hoax and once again they slapped a giant hoax alert across the front of their article
[2:13:45.680 --> 2:13:52.240]  and they claimed that we didn't know what these people were celebrating when they were responding
[2:13:52.240 --> 2:13:59.680]  gushingly and excitingly with these happy smiley excitable emoticons now unfortunately for them
[2:13:59.680 --> 2:14:06.160]  the live video of the notre dame cathedral was at the top of the page in the screenshots that i
[2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:11.760]  provided but bus feed said oh we we don't know what they were responding to so they had to change
[2:14:11.760 --> 2:14:18.720]  that now we have a similar situation here with eukendis because aside from your lawsuit against
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:25.040]  usa today and this lead stories group you also threatened polity fact with legal action over
[2:14:25.040 --> 2:14:31.680]  a facebook post that they erroneously labeled false what was the nature of that post and what
[2:14:31.680 --> 2:14:36.720]  was their response you know i had done a video obviously i've been very vocal um i've been
[2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:40.160]  one of the people that have used my platform to talk about all the irregularities in this
[2:14:40.160 --> 2:14:44.960]  election cycle i mean there's no doubt um in my mind the mind of millions of americans and people
[2:14:44.960 --> 2:14:50.240]  abroad that this election was rigged the numbers just don't make sense and so once we saw the media
[2:14:50.240 --> 2:14:54.880]  just decide on the narrative that he was that joe biden was the president elect he legally is not
[2:14:54.880 --> 2:14:59.600]  the president elect you can't just say that um and make that true because you want it to be true
[2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:05.120]  so i did a video discussing how you know the media is actually duping people and brainwashing people
[2:15:05.120 --> 2:15:09.680]  into believing that he is the president elect because if it turns out that he's not and trump
[2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:14.800]  gets a second term it's going to inspire a civil war obviously when you've been brainwashed by so
[2:15:14.800 --> 2:15:19.920]  many media conglomerates to believe that this has already happened and the election is over um and
[2:15:19.920 --> 2:15:25.520]  they slapped a warning on that and said that this was false and that president that joe biden was
[2:15:25.520 --> 2:15:30.160]  the president elect how long they slapped a warning they wrote an entire article um saying here is how
[2:15:30.160 --> 2:15:35.280]  we at political fact know that joe biden is the president elect and he's legally not um so it was
[2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:39.600]  just a no-brainer this is just you guys deciding on a narrative that is not true so we immediately
[2:15:39.600 --> 2:15:44.880]  went after them and i was very keen to go after them because political fact um has been so poisonous
[2:15:44.880 --> 2:15:50.240]  and in doing this and just to say we decided this and therefore it's true and i wanted to see
[2:15:50.240 --> 2:15:54.480]  uh you know how willing are you to stand by the fact that joe biden is the president elect are you
[2:15:54.480 --> 2:15:58.800]  are you millions of dollars willing to stand by that but stand by that fact because we are going
[2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:04.080]  to add you to this lawsuit um that we have against us a today that we have against leaf stories and
[2:16:04.080 --> 2:16:09.360]  they immediately backed down and said it was a mistake the lawyer back and said it was a mistake
[2:16:09.360 --> 2:16:16.160]  i mean that's quite the mistake right pjw like like you wrote an entire article it wasn't like
[2:16:16.160 --> 2:16:20.480]  you know you just kept making that mistake 1200 words kind of making a mistake it wasn't a mistake
[2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:25.280]  it was intentional and it was done to keep continually delude society to believe that this
[2:16:25.280 --> 2:16:30.960]  election is over um and that you know that trump is not has no shot at becoming um at
[2:16:30.960 --> 2:16:36.640]  remaining the president for the next four years and this is exactly why i started fact checks.com
[2:16:36.640 --> 2:16:40.720]  is to independently go after each one of their fact checkers that are doing justice they are
[2:16:40.720 --> 2:16:47.200]  deluding the minds of brainwashed americans who cannot separate um media brainwashing from real
[2:16:47.200 --> 2:16:55.440]  life now the uh politic fact organization is basically a unit of the pointer institute this
[2:16:55.440 --> 2:17:03.040]  is this big umbrella fact checking network interestingly enough in 2017 the pointer institute
[2:17:03.040 --> 2:17:09.280]  which owns politic fact received 1.3 million dollars from the omidor network and the open
[2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:16.080]  society foundations of course overseen by our favorite mr george soros and then they came out
[2:17:16.080 --> 2:17:22.320]  also i recall with this uh blacklist of conservative websites which were pretty mainstream websites the
[2:17:22.320 --> 2:17:28.240]  free beak and the washington times they had to withdraw that because of uh they they admitted
[2:17:28.240 --> 2:17:33.760]  their own methodology was completely flawed so these fact checking groups are more sensitive and
[2:17:33.760 --> 2:17:39.200]  of course as we know with snopes for example they're all left wing fronts this notion that they're
[2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:46.240]  neutral uh you know impartial denizens of truth has been disproven time and time again right they're
[2:17:46.240 --> 2:17:52.080]  all left wing fronts and now in fact the facebook officials that were put under so much scrutiny
[2:17:52.080 --> 2:17:57.520]  for killing democracy and helping trump win half of them are now on the biden transition team
[2:17:59.360 --> 2:18:04.240]  it's exactly right i mean and it's just it's so ridiculous because i mean the the bigger problem
[2:18:04.240 --> 2:18:08.240]  here is that what we're facing is extreme censorship um and you this is something you just
[2:18:08.240 --> 2:18:12.160]  would never think would happen especially in america where we so much believe in free speech
[2:18:12.160 --> 2:18:16.400]  you are starting to see that they are censoring people and i think what they did in the beginning
[2:18:16.400 --> 2:18:19.920]  and what people didn't speak was they said oh we'll just we'll just censor the people that
[2:18:19.920 --> 2:18:24.320]  are on the fringe and conservatives got in line and said okay well that's fine yeah we're just
[2:18:24.320 --> 2:18:29.920]  censoring alex jones and and lora lumar and mylo and that's okay because this is polite society
[2:18:29.920 --> 2:18:34.320]  but inevitably what always happens is is that they move in and and there's no such they're not going
[2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:38.720]  after the fringes they're going after everybody that is conservative this has always been their
[2:18:38.720 --> 2:18:42.960]  plan and this is why it's important that whether or not you agree with someone or not whether or
[2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:47.600]  not you think lora lumar is is such an outstanding character that she should have won that congressional
[2:18:47.600 --> 2:18:52.000]  see or whether you absolutely despise her you need to speak out and defend her right to free
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  speech um and because otherwise we end up in a society where now i can't publish the work of
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:04.320]  an actual doctor because it's not it's not it's not a preferred narrative um that these that
[2:19:04.320 --> 2:19:08.320]  these leftists agree with and they have so much power and control with this tech censorship
[2:19:08.880 --> 2:19:12.960]  it's why they're attacking a parlor right now because people are fleeing and that's a free
[2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:18.160]  market response and so they're trying to essentially um demonize parlor and make it seem like it's you
[2:19:18.160 --> 2:19:22.400]  know it's being run by people who are racist and white supremacists and all of this crazy stuff
[2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:29.440]  um but you know i i know that they are fearful of this lawsuit i i think that they made a dangerous
[2:19:29.440 --> 2:19:34.480]  mistake by not just changing um when we gave them the opportunity by going back and changing the
[2:19:34.480 --> 2:19:41.360]  rating from false um and i continued to i i'm planning to take this the entire way um because
[2:19:41.360 --> 2:19:46.640]  i do think that this our freedoms actually depend on this if we don't actually score a win against
[2:19:46.640 --> 2:19:51.120]  these big tech companies um we aren't going to have a a western society we're defending we're
[2:19:51.120 --> 2:19:57.680]  going to be like communist china now let's do one more segment when we come back can this but we've
[2:19:57.680 --> 2:20:02.320]  got about 50 seconds here so i'll introduce the next topic now you talked about the the vast
[2:20:03.280 --> 2:20:09.920]  oppressive sensorious approach towards covid even from whistleblowers experts the key fact here is
[2:20:10.560 --> 2:20:17.200]  the very whistleblowers who raised the alarm bill alarm bell about covid 19 at the very start of the
[2:20:17.200 --> 2:20:23.280]  pandemic were doctors and medical professionals in china saying that it was a real thing back in
[2:20:23.280 --> 2:20:30.160]  december they received police visits they were censored on chinese social media they were silenced
[2:20:30.160 --> 2:20:36.560]  for trying to warn about coronavirus so the very first acts of censorship in terms of coronavirus
[2:20:36.560 --> 2:20:41.360]  were against people trying to alert the world to the fact that china was covering it oh we'll talk
[2:20:41.360 --> 2:20:46.560]  about that and more on the other side so make no news don't go this is gonna come down the site over
[2:20:46.560 --> 2:20:49.840]  how many people are awake and how many aren't they're going to contest the election they're going to
[2:20:49.840 --> 2:20:54.720]  say trump lost they're super pissed that i'm on air i want them shut down i want them silenced i want
[2:20:54.720 --> 2:20:59.680]  them muted i think they are horrible for our society you kept us on air we did the analysis first
[2:20:59.680 --> 2:21:04.640]  it's now gonna make street we continue to be the epicenter and and what they said directly to us
[2:21:04.640 --> 2:21:10.080]  is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want and you need to stop
[2:21:10.080 --> 2:21:13.680]  right now and they're very very serious well i'm not signing on with a bunch of devil worshiping
[2:21:13.680 --> 2:21:18.160]  child violence it's not going to happen so they are moving now to destroy it i used to say support
[2:21:18.160 --> 2:21:23.680]  informers rescue info save yourself save the world we're in this together because let me tell you
[2:21:23.680 --> 2:21:29.040]  something communism's up here info wars is the damn blocking it which is all of us together supporting
[2:21:29.040 --> 2:21:34.800]  and you and i are all down here with our families my children are right here but i need money to fight
[2:21:34.800 --> 2:21:40.320]  a war and i need word of mouth and i need prayer and i need action because that damn's going to come
[2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:50.240]  down trops told you hell's coming warning warning warning there is not long to stop the complete
[2:21:50.240 --> 2:21:56.480]  martial law takeover the giant third world collapse and a new world war that is going to be triggered
[2:21:56.480 --> 2:22:02.560]  by the new covid lockdown announced by globalist systems in europe in asia and now in the united
[2:22:02.560 --> 2:22:09.760]  states joe bite is set to announce today that he has a new covid task force that is calling for a
[2:22:09.760 --> 2:22:15.840]  national mask mandate to prove your servitude contact tracing forced inoculations coming
[2:22:15.840 --> 2:22:22.800]  but most importantly a new lockdown that way he can say that trump is to blame for covid and claim
[2:22:22.800 --> 2:22:29.440]  that only a new lockdown will stop covid then of course when that new lockdown doesn't work those of
[2:22:29.440 --> 2:22:33.600]  us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it and that's when all the masks
[2:22:33.600 --> 2:22:39.600]  arrest start sometime towards the end of next year this is a permanent martial law plan trump
[2:22:39.600 --> 2:22:46.480]  must be putiated exposed pouching gates and the un takeover not play games with it the trick that
[2:22:46.480 --> 2:22:53.680]  social engineers use is very very simple they just teach us that the architecture of civilization
[2:22:53.680 --> 2:23:00.640]  that the trajectory of the species is designed by these ever-knowing loving liberal technocrats
[2:23:01.600 --> 2:23:05.280]  and that if we just sit back and enjoy the ride everything will be great but then they tell us
[2:23:05.920 --> 2:23:10.640]  that humans are obsolete not essential and we're bad for the earth and we need to be faced out so
[2:23:11.520 --> 2:23:17.600]  they're very open about what they're doing and they count on us just being very passive living
[2:23:17.600 --> 2:23:24.400]  in the matrix like system that they're building but what defines humans more than anything from the
[2:23:24.400 --> 2:23:30.720]  rest of the quote animal kingdom is that we control our environment we build our own environments we
[2:23:30.720 --> 2:23:37.280]  create our own systems we really geoengineer and terraform the planet and its systems towards our
[2:23:37.280 --> 2:23:42.480]  aims but instead we're acting like animals and the globalists play the part of humans and us
[2:23:42.480 --> 2:23:48.640]  as cattle and that's the trick the great reset where have i heard of that before oh the great
[2:23:49.520 --> 2:23:55.920]  leap forward Mao Zedong ordering all the small towns and small farms to basically shut down
[2:23:55.920 --> 2:24:00.480]  and have the rural people and the small business people move into the big cities and go under
[2:24:00.480 --> 2:24:05.440]  communist commune control and that's all this is the big mega banks want to break us and the same
[2:24:05.440 --> 2:24:09.440]  ones that put Mao Zedong into power and they're creating the process of getting rid of our old
[2:24:09.440 --> 2:24:14.640]  economy and bringing in the new economy where everything's free because when you're a prisoner
[2:24:14.640 --> 2:24:19.520]  well everything's free but you're also a slave Scotland is going to have universal guaranteed
[2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:24.160]  incomes now of subsistence level but of course you got to take those vaccines you can't have any
[2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:30.640]  kids and oh don't worry though all of the tampons and stuff like that's free too as well i'm not
[2:24:30.640 --> 2:24:35.760]  kidding so give me some free paper they give me enough money to basically live in a tiny apartment
[2:24:35.760 --> 2:24:40.560]  but they own you they control you that's the great reset that's why it's got to be resisted
[2:24:40.560 --> 2:24:43.680]  to total takeover and we're fighting it at info wars dot com
[2:24:47.840 --> 2:24:50.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:24:50.480 --> 2:25:06.080]  live from london england it's paul joseph watson with summit dot news
[2:25:09.680 --> 2:25:16.320]  and we are back the website is fact check suck dot com and can this has got real good chance
[2:25:16.320 --> 2:25:21.120]  if you listen to some of the legal experts uh robert bonds and others she's got a real good
[2:25:21.120 --> 2:25:26.080]  chance of being these people as we know they have endless vast pots of money thanks to the fact that
[2:25:26.080 --> 2:25:32.240]  they're funded by groups linked to open society foundations and other leftist front groups like
[2:25:32.240 --> 2:25:38.640]  that now you can go and support kandace at fact check suck dot com and i invite everyone to do
[2:25:38.640 --> 2:25:43.120]  that right now the link will be in the description when this goes up on youtube but i was talking
[2:25:43.120 --> 2:25:49.120]  kandace before the break the very whistleblowers who tried to warn the world about covet when
[2:25:49.120 --> 2:25:53.920]  china was trying to cover it up when the world health organization by the way said there was no
[2:25:53.920 --> 2:25:59.280]  human to human transmission as late as the middle of january at different times they
[2:25:59.280 --> 2:26:04.640]  urged people not to buy face masks the world health organization that is now youtube says
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:11.040]  you can't question the world health organization it's this idea that challenging health authorities
[2:26:11.040 --> 2:26:16.160]  threatens public health when the very first people doing that at the start of the pandemic
[2:26:16.160 --> 2:26:22.720]  were the chinese doctor whistleblowers calling the communist party out for covering up the pandemic
[2:26:22.720 --> 2:26:29.360]  surely that's the lifeblood of a free society right great stuff the covet 19 stuff i've been
[2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:34.400]  talking about for a very long time because we've never seen such mass censorship over an issue
[2:26:35.120 --> 2:26:39.040]  you would think and by the way let's remove covet 19 from from the scenario that we're
[2:26:39.040 --> 2:26:43.040]  talking about let's create a new scenario let's create any health predicament anybody could
[2:26:43.040 --> 2:26:48.160]  possibly have whether it's cancer uh for pregnancy i'm pregnant right now you are always allowed to
[2:26:48.160 --> 2:26:53.280]  hear multiple opinions from doctors right i could go to a doctor right now who would tell me that
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:57.680]  giving birth naturally is the best thing in the entire world i can go see another doctor who says
[2:26:57.680 --> 2:27:01.840]  you know take the epidural and in the long run it's gonna be better for your baby um if you're
[2:27:01.840 --> 2:27:05.760]  relaxed you know if you're a relaxed mom right so we've always been in a society that allows for
[2:27:05.760 --> 2:27:13.680]  different opinions covet 19 we have seen suddenly that you cannot question who you cannot question
[2:27:13.680 --> 2:27:20.800]  the cvc um and and questioning them whatsoever can lead to censorship of even doctors right remember
[2:27:20.800 --> 2:27:25.520]  the youtube videos of doctors who were going and talking about what they were seeing um as they were
[2:27:25.520 --> 2:27:30.880]  treating patients patients with covet 19 doctors that were against the lockdowns um you know doctors
[2:27:30.880 --> 2:27:37.040]  that were saying that vitamin c um you know mass mega doses of vitamin c could help cure this so
[2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:42.240]  this entire predicament of covet 19 no matter which way you look at it there we have a problem we
[2:27:42.240 --> 2:27:47.920]  have a very very real problem in terms of a free society that is not able to get any truth
[2:27:47.920 --> 2:27:53.360]  about this uh alleged infectious disease that it has been worse have it has been worse has been
[2:27:53.360 --> 2:27:58.720]  worth shutting down virtually all of western society and i say western society because it's
[2:27:58.720 --> 2:28:04.880]  fascinating to consider that it's only the west that has been this locked down for this long we're
[2:28:04.880 --> 2:28:08.960]  supposed to believe that china as you just mentioned we're learning now today seeing that it's saying
[2:28:08.960 --> 2:28:12.720]  oh they covered some deaths we're supposed to believe that china only took what was it a month
[2:28:12.720 --> 2:28:17.360]  before they reopened was it a couple of weeks before they were able able to reopen their society
[2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:22.720]  people were able to get back to work um so i have been talking about this for a very long time and
[2:28:22.720 --> 2:28:29.440]  it is shameful um that the media has been participating in censoring so much information
[2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:32.960]  um from valid sources regarding what sort of a predicament we're actually in
[2:28:34.560 --> 2:28:39.440]  no you've mentioned china i've got an article out today china to enjoy better post-covid economy
[2:28:39.440 --> 2:28:45.120]  than all other major nations they're out there having pool parties in wilham they're at the
[2:28:45.120 --> 2:28:51.680]  nightclubs no masks no social distancing their gdp this year is set for a 1.8 percent increase the
[2:28:51.680 --> 2:29:01.120]  us is going to be down 3.7 percent meanwhile in the us you've got amazon adding 427 000 employees
[2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:06.640]  between january and october throughout this pandemic you've got small businesses going bust
[2:29:06.640 --> 2:29:12.960]  they've lost an average 30 of their income over the past six months so the only people
[2:29:12.960 --> 2:29:18.560]  benefiting out of this economically are amazon walmart target and all these big retailers who
[2:29:18.560 --> 2:29:23.280]  everyone has now become completely dependent upon as if they weren't dependent on them enough
[2:29:23.840 --> 2:29:29.760]  and china which went from literally putting out videos of people convulsing and collapsing in the
[2:29:29.760 --> 2:29:35.680]  street back in january which all we all freaked out about that was obviously some kind of propaganda
[2:29:35.680 --> 2:29:41.840]  designed to make the west overreact to the covid pandemic and now we're in this situation where we
[2:29:41.840 --> 2:29:48.240]  can't even talk about it i want to bring it out to the back i was the only one who never freaked out it
[2:29:48.240 --> 2:29:52.800]  was so obviously propaganda when i saw people wiping out in the streets i'm like wrong you know
[2:29:52.800 --> 2:29:57.280]  somebody passed out i mean this happens i lived in new york city stuff happens on the train like
[2:29:57.280 --> 2:30:01.760]  this all the time now all of a sudden you have people you know putting together these videos
[2:30:01.760 --> 2:30:04.880]  and you're saying oh i'm like so we're all just going to wipe out in the middle of the street and
[2:30:04.880 --> 2:30:09.200]  it just it always seemed a bit weird to me everything about covid 19 just it was one of those
[2:30:09.200 --> 2:30:14.000]  things where it just a chill one up my spine i was like something's weird about this it was also the
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:18.240]  timing um you know in the midst of such a serious election in america just a lot of it just didn't
[2:30:18.240 --> 2:30:23.280]  make sense uh you know apps and any facts that was going on basically just an inkling um that
[2:30:23.280 --> 2:30:27.040]  something was really wrong here but i do want to add one more thing to what you said which
[2:30:27.040 --> 2:30:31.920]  really should let you know how much bs this is they've shut down small businesses they have shut
[2:30:31.920 --> 2:30:36.080]  down restaurants they have said that eating in restaurants is just not okay and yet they have
[2:30:36.080 --> 2:30:42.240]  condoned flying on a plane next to each other okay where you are allowed to take off your mask
[2:30:42.240 --> 2:30:47.200]  you are allowed to eat you can drink coffee while you are on the flight because harvard did a study
[2:30:47.200 --> 2:30:52.800]  and determined that um somehow planes are safe and restaurants are not if that does not let you
[2:30:52.800 --> 2:30:58.560]  know that there is a true financial incentive behind this to attack small business owners um
[2:30:58.560 --> 2:31:03.840]  and while protecting the lease and nothing will and by the way guys every time any like funding
[2:31:03.840 --> 2:31:08.160]  of a study is done through harvard you can almost guarantee that they were there to produce their
[2:31:08.160 --> 2:31:13.600]  desired results the person that funded the study um and and that is i think the most despicable thing
[2:31:13.600 --> 2:31:18.320]  that you can point to that airlines are allowed to fill their flights with people everybody gets
[2:31:18.320 --> 2:31:23.680]  sick every time you fly because it's just the air is just so disgusting on all airlines um and yet
[2:31:23.680 --> 2:31:29.520]  they are allowed to fly people and business owners cannot open their restaurants no it's ridiculous
[2:31:29.520 --> 2:31:34.080]  we had a rule at 10 p.m curfew where everyone was thrown out of the bars at 10 p.m they all
[2:31:34.080 --> 2:31:39.040]  congregate on the streets and just have street parties now in wales the government is saying
[2:31:39.600 --> 2:31:44.560]  pubs can't serve alcohol as if you're more susceptible to the virus if you're drinking
[2:31:44.560 --> 2:31:49.440]  alcohol that's going to put those pubs those restaurants even further into the mayer and
[2:31:49.440 --> 2:31:54.560]  then we have the vaccine of course you've had the debate in the u.s but it's come to the four more
[2:31:54.560 --> 2:32:00.160]  in the uk with companies and airlines now saying suggesting that you won't be allowed to enter a
[2:32:00.160 --> 2:32:05.680]  bar or restaurants in our sports stadium or any other kind of similar venue if you don't take the
[2:32:05.680 --> 2:32:10.560]  vaccine so we have the government saying oh we're not going to make it mandatory but you're not going
[2:32:10.560 --> 2:32:17.040]  to be able to travel or have any kind of social life if you don't take it so again it's this kind
[2:32:17.040 --> 2:32:22.720]  of it's this two-tier system where you have a lower cast of people who aren't going to be able to
[2:32:22.720 --> 2:32:29.040]  enjoy basic freedoms mobility and social life but if you take the shot then you can what kind of
[2:32:29.040 --> 2:32:34.640]  backlash is it going to create or need or require for these small businesses these bars restaurants
[2:32:34.640 --> 2:32:39.520]  to go against the grain and say no you don't have to take the vaccine to come into our premises
[2:32:39.520 --> 2:32:45.360]  given that we've seen polls can this in the uk and it's probably even greater in the u.s that show
[2:32:45.360 --> 2:32:52.160]  36 percent of people are very unlikely to take the vaccine so a bars restaurant sports stadiums
[2:32:52.160 --> 2:32:58.080]  really going to take that financial hit to carry through this compulsory vaccine policy or do you
[2:32:58.080 --> 2:33:03.600]  see that falling by the wayside i see it falling by the wayside now we'll say this i have already
[2:33:03.600 --> 2:33:07.280]  spoken out and said i will not be taking the vaccine i've been saying this since february i knew
[2:33:07.280 --> 2:33:11.760]  this was coming um it makes no sense it's a 99 chance that you're going to survive if you get
[2:33:11.760 --> 2:33:18.160]  covid 19 why the hell would you take a vaccine that has 94 effective and causes you to be sick
[2:33:18.160 --> 2:33:21.840]  and now they're prepping people oh well the vaccine could make you sick but make sure you come
[2:33:21.840 --> 2:33:25.760]  back and get the second dose i won't be taking it but i do want to say as a reminder to everybody who's
[2:33:25.760 --> 2:33:31.760]  watching if there's one thing that every society in the entire world that has had slaves has had
[2:33:31.760 --> 2:33:36.240]  in common what does every society in the entire world that has had slaves had in common and the
[2:33:36.240 --> 2:33:42.240]  answer is is that there was always more slaves and there were masters i keep that in my mind
[2:33:42.240 --> 2:33:46.800]  when i when i go through and i think about things there's always going to be more of us than them
[2:33:46.800 --> 2:33:52.160]  you know if we say no it's a no um you know if if we decide that okay you say that i can't fly unless
[2:33:52.160 --> 2:33:56.160]  i get this vaccine let's just not fly for a year eventually they're going to have to come to because
[2:33:56.160 --> 2:34:01.520]  it's going to hurt them um so you know i i think every person should do their best with the information
[2:34:01.520 --> 2:34:05.680]  that they have available the vaccine is not for kandace owens the vaccine will not be taken in my
[2:34:05.680 --> 2:34:09.440]  family and it won't be given to my children and that's the most that i can say about that
[2:34:09.440 --> 2:34:16.640]  okay kandace that's a good place to close the website is factcheckzuck.com we'll be sure to

[2:36:44.720 --> 2:36:52.160]  back in 1996 the head of the world food program said that they would use food and global lockdowns
[2:36:52.160 --> 2:36:58.160]  due to a virus scare to bring in world government that also came out the north american union
[2:36:58.160 --> 2:37:04.320]  documents the judicial watch and lou dobbs got more than 15 years ago as well so we know their plan
[2:37:04.320 --> 2:37:08.320]  and if they're able to keep this lockdown going it's going to cause not just a worldwide depression
[2:37:08.320 --> 2:37:13.120]  but mass starvation of hundreds of millions millions have already starved to death not from

[2:38:47.840 --> 2:38:50.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:02.960]  you're listening to summit.news with paul joseph watson
[2:39:02.960 --> 2:39:12.400]  we are back live on the show we're going to delve into the latest news and we're going to
[2:39:12.400 --> 2:39:18.320]  start an article that i mentioned earlier on during that interview which is up on summit.news
[2:39:18.320 --> 2:39:25.040]  china to enjoy better coast povid economy than all other major nations we've got the gdp figures
[2:39:25.600 --> 2:39:32.720]  not just for this year but for 2021 at least the forecast for gdp for 2020 and 2021
[2:39:32.720 --> 2:39:40.000]  and guess who's come out of all this smelling like roses oh it's the communist chinese well what a
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:46.560]  surprise the country in which the coronavirus originated has come out better than anyone
[2:39:46.560 --> 2:39:52.320]  they're all having pool parties they're all dancing in nightclubs meanwhile you can't hug
[2:39:52.320 --> 2:39:58.800]  your granny at christmas in fact the cdc came out last week and said you can't sing at thanksgiving
[2:39:58.800 --> 2:40:06.560]  i'm sure a lot of people are bided by that directive but now the oecd has revealed that china
[2:40:06.560 --> 2:40:12.960]  is set to enjoy a post-covid economic recovery that outstrips every other major country in the world
[2:40:12.960 --> 2:40:19.520]  most of which will see debilitating drops in their gdp and we have a list here it says a graph
[2:40:19.520 --> 2:40:25.760]  proposing gdp projection projections for various nations and areas show that china was the only
[2:40:25.760 --> 2:40:36.080]  nation on the list to enjoy a real gdp growth in 2020 with 1.8 plus this year as well as a
[2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:44.240]  prediction of 8 percent in 2021 and 4.9 percent in 2022 in comparison the united states having
[2:40:44.240 --> 2:40:52.480]  suffered a 3 drop 3.7 percent drop in 2020 is set to achieve 3.2 and 3.5 real gdp growth in 2021
[2:40:52.480 --> 2:41:00.080]  in 2022 respectively bear in mind that's with the potential god forbid of a biden presidency
[2:41:00.080 --> 2:41:06.000]  where he's called for a national mask mandate where his advisors have called for rolling lockdowns on
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:13.280]  and off so i reckon those numbers are a bit overall a bit too positive given the fact that
[2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:17.280]  we're going to have a massive change in policy and it's going to come from the federal level
[2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:23.440]  with biden encouraging all these areas to lock down even further but china is going to be just fine
[2:41:24.560 --> 2:41:29.040]  does the united kingdom compared to most countries on the outlooks graph got affected more heavily
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:37.440]  suffering a gdp reduction of 11.2 percent in 2020 with only argentina suffering worse results and
[2:41:37.440 --> 2:41:43.520]  that's of course because we've completely failed to follow the model of sweden by not locking down
[2:41:43.520 --> 2:41:48.800]  despite the fact that sweden has a lower death rate a lower infection rate even if you compare
[2:41:48.800 --> 2:41:54.880]  the populations and of course they never told their population to lock down businesses across
[2:41:54.880 --> 2:42:01.440]  the united kingdom are closing down you've got the cabbies on starvation wages the taxis are all
[2:42:01.440 --> 2:42:07.920]  be have all been mothballed they're just sitting in empty fields but china's going to be just fine
[2:42:07.920 --> 2:42:13.680]  and of course we had this article oh by the way this also relates to the fact that china deliberately
[2:42:14.560 --> 2:42:20.720]  hyped this virus to hysterical levels before it crossed over into europe and the united states
[2:42:20.720 --> 2:42:27.200]  as i was talking about before there were multiple videos that emerged out of china every single
[2:42:27.200 --> 2:42:31.760]  day during the early stages of the pandemic before it even reached europe
[2:42:31.760 --> 2:42:37.840]  with people literally convulsing collapsing and dying in the streets apparently due to coronavirus
[2:42:37.840 --> 2:42:44.400]  infection now we know that whatever coronavirus symptoms are you know loss of taste loss of
[2:42:44.400 --> 2:42:50.320]  smell coughing of course we know that the vast majority of people are either asymptomatic or
[2:42:50.320 --> 2:42:56.480]  recover within three or four days we know that convulsing and dying in the streets like you see
[2:42:56.480 --> 2:43:02.880]  here is not a coronavirus symptom and yet we saw multiple videos of precisely that coming
[2:43:02.880 --> 2:43:11.040]  out of china day after day after day and that prompted a great overreaction in the west with
[2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:16.880]  these different lockdown policies now of course you could make the argument that china was lying
[2:43:16.880 --> 2:43:24.000]  about their true death rate i think it was five thousand the last time i checked i'm going to check
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:32.160]  again but if you compare the population of china of course 1.3 billion compared to what 370 million
[2:43:32.160 --> 2:43:40.400]  people in the united states china has 4600 coronavirus deaths compared to what is the united
[2:43:40.400 --> 2:43:48.320]  states up to i think is like 300 000 by this point the uk is on 55 000 of course with a far lower
[2:43:48.320 --> 2:43:57.040]  population deaths from coronavirus in the u.s. 269 000 again with a 370 million population compared
[2:43:57.040 --> 2:44:05.360]  to not even 5 000 in china the origin of the virus now unless the chinese government was lying all
[2:44:05.360 --> 2:44:11.360]  along about their death rate that's definitely a possibility unless there was a mutation of the
[2:44:11.360 --> 2:44:17.840]  virus that caused the spread of the virus and the spread of the virus and the spread of the
[2:44:17.840 --> 2:44:25.840]  virus that caused it to become more potent more fatal when it reached europe and america or of
[2:44:25.840 --> 2:44:32.480]  course the other fact remains the potential that authorities in the us in the uk and across europe
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:38.720]  counted covid deaths as a covid death despite the fact that these people have several other
[2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:44.320]  comorbidities which we now know for a fact so all these covid deaths could be completely wrong
[2:44:44.320 --> 2:44:51.120]  across the board but we know for a fact for a fact that convulsing vomiting and dying on the
[2:44:51.120 --> 2:44:57.440]  streets was not ever a symptom of coronavirus but now china's completely recovered they're
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:04.640]  all going to pull parties in wuhan and their economy is just going to be tickety boo in a
[2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:10.800]  similar way to amazon headline amazon goes on lockdown hiring spree while small businesses
[2:45:10.800 --> 2:45:19.120]  go bust yes the only competitors in terms of the economy to come out of this even better than before
[2:45:19.120 --> 2:45:25.760]  are giant transnational corporations the very same ones that fund the news networks that push the
[2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:31.600]  hysteria about this virus being more deadly being more debilitating than it is they've all
[2:45:31.600 --> 2:45:37.440]  cashed in while your small business is going bust while people are losing their jobs left right and
[2:45:37.440 --> 2:45:44.240]  center amazon went on a record global hiring spree over the course of 2020 while small businesses
[2:45:44.240 --> 2:45:49.520]  went bust proving that lockdown policies only benefit giant transnational corporations they
[2:45:49.520 --> 2:45:57.280]  added 427 000 employees between january and october throughout the height of this pandemic
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:04.160]  pushing their workforce to more than 1.2 million people up more than 50 percent from a year ago
[2:46:04.160 --> 2:46:10.080]  amazon's number of workers now approaches the entire population of dallas and they're hiring an
[2:46:10.080 --> 2:46:18.960]  average of about 2800 employees a day now if you compare that historically they've outstripped the
[2:46:18.960 --> 2:46:27.120]  previous record which was walmart two decades ago where they added 230 000 employees in a single year
[2:46:27.120 --> 2:46:35.520]  so amazon's already outstripped that within 10 months times two so they've beaten walmart times
[2:46:35.520 --> 2:46:42.240]  two not even accounting for the full year and in fact historically that rate of hiring was only
[2:46:42.240 --> 2:46:49.280]  beaten during world war two because of the rapid increase in the shipbuilding industry
[2:46:49.280 --> 2:46:55.440]  and the need for workers to fight the war during world war two so literally in a commercial sense
[2:46:55.440 --> 2:47:04.080]  it's the biggest by 100 of walmart economic hiring growth ever seen it says the scale of
[2:47:04.080 --> 2:47:09.280]  hiring is even larger than it may seem because the numbers do not account for employee churn
[2:47:09.280 --> 2:47:13.520]  nor do they include the 100 000 temporary workers who have been recruited for the holiday shopping
[2:47:13.520 --> 2:47:19.440]  season they also don't include what internal documents show are as roughly 500 000 delivery
[2:47:19.440 --> 2:47:26.400]  drivers who are contractors and not direct amazon employees and that's key because if you
[2:47:26.400 --> 2:47:33.520]  recall at schwarbs claus schwarbs sorry covid 19 the great reset book he of course is the head
[2:47:33.520 --> 2:47:39.280]  honcho the founder of the world economic forum this global elite technocrat group that's pushed for a
[2:47:39.280 --> 2:47:45.920]  quote great reset and if you read his book he openly praises the fact that everyone will
[2:47:45.920 --> 2:47:52.400]  basically be technically self-employed but they'll be completely dependent on giant
[2:47:52.400 --> 2:47:59.360]  transnational corporations like amazon and they'll be contractors for amazon so they get none of the
[2:47:59.360 --> 2:48:05.920]  employment benefits or protections but they'll get all of the downsides and it is a race to the
[2:48:05.920 --> 2:48:14.480]  bottom because here in the uk you have delivery men delivery drivers who have to bid on prices to
[2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:20.480]  deliver amazon parcels and of course the company will choose whoever bids the lowest amount so
[2:48:20.480 --> 2:48:26.240]  it's always a race to the bottom they're making less and less money and yet amazon is hiring
[2:48:26.240 --> 2:48:34.960]  more and more of them at a greater rate meanwhile 100 percent amazon has seen its profits during
[2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:41.040]  covid pandemic so by 100 percent while small businesses have lost 30 percent in profits and
[2:48:41.040 --> 2:48:48.960]  that's only going to get worse and 21 1 in 5 plus small businesses have closed down permanently
[2:48:48.960 --> 2:48:55.440]  you look at the personal wealth increase accrued by the CEOs of companies like amazon
[2:48:55.440 --> 2:49:04.560]  walmart target lows amazon it's up 91 billion in the in terms of jeff bezos walmart 38 billion
[2:49:04.560 --> 2:49:12.560]  google 70 37 billion microsoft 33 billion while small businesses collectively have lost over 200
[2:49:12.560 --> 2:49:19.440]  billion now as we point out in this article amazon's jeff bezos owns the washington post which has
[2:49:19.440 --> 2:49:26.480]  advocated lockdowns and corona hysteria from the very beginning and that's made him and his company
[2:49:26.480 --> 2:49:32.800]  filthy rich while everybody else goes bust now go away we'll be back to talk about vaccine and more
[2:49:32.800 --> 2:49:38.320]  summit dot news ladies and gentlemen i hope we can stop the great reset that means a globalist
[2:49:38.320 --> 2:49:42.640]  imposed worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control that's their
[2:49:42.640 --> 2:49:47.520]  stated admitted plan just introduce on record claus swab all the different democrat mayors
[2:49:47.520 --> 2:49:52.400]  they admit it's clowered in pevin implode the economy to make us go into their control but if
[2:49:52.400 --> 2:49:57.280]  we expose they're the ones doing it they go to prison instead of getting total power and total
[2:49:57.280 --> 2:50:01.840]  control and there are major uprisings happening across the world during the us thousands of
[2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:05.920]  sheriffs are saying hell no to the lockdowns people are finally starting to fight back but
[2:50:05.920 --> 2:50:10.960]  regardless you need to get prepared we have high-quality storeable food last 25 years highest
[2:50:10.960 --> 2:50:16.560]  quality lowest prices great containers ready to ship but when people figure this out in a few months
[2:50:16.560 --> 2:50:20.720]  i think they'll be long lines again to get storeable food after the lockdowns been going for

[2:50:31.520 --> 2:50:38.320]  your orders in now preparewithalix.com there is an economic war taking place of the ruling class
[2:50:38.320 --> 2:50:42.800]  to consolidate power and control there's a headline out from zero hedge that breaks down
[2:50:42.800 --> 2:50:49.920]  bloomberg numbers the global airlines are set to lose 157 billion dollars this year by the end of
[2:50:49.920 --> 2:50:56.800]  december it's already over 130 billion dollars they've lost why would they take part in the hoax
[2:50:56.800 --> 2:51:02.080]  in the lockdown in the hysteria if it hurts them we'll see that'll knock out all the small airlines
[2:51:02.080 --> 2:51:06.400]  and it's holiday control and it's the same in every single industry and the big megabanks have
[2:51:06.400 --> 2:51:12.160]  unlimited capital they want to bankrupt the world economy to buy it up for pennies on the dollar
[2:51:12.160 --> 2:51:16.720]  that's why the great stock market crash of 29 later turned out was engineered by some central banks
[2:51:16.720 --> 2:51:23.280]  this is how the global estate control it stars the third world to death makes the first world poor
[2:51:23.280 --> 2:51:28.800]  it's economic warfare and it gives cover to the big megabanks that created thousands of trillions
[2:51:28.800 --> 2:51:33.520]  of dollars in fake derivatives only the truth will set us free temple wars dot com
[2:51:37.440 --> 2:51:40.080]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:51:40.080 --> 2:51:57.280]  live from the summit dot news headquarters it's paul joseph watson
[2:52:00.720 --> 2:52:06.480]  welcome back we are entering the fourth hour of the show i'm going to talk about the push
[2:52:06.480 --> 2:52:13.680]  to mandate vaccines not via government law but via services and companies demanding people take
[2:52:13.680 --> 2:52:19.040]  the vaccine before they're allowed to travel and to bars and to restaurants and to sports stadiums
[2:52:19.600 --> 2:52:23.520]  the push is on now to be fair some airlines have said they've come out and said they're not going
[2:52:23.520 --> 2:52:29.040]  to force that for travel within europe but long call airliners are signaling that you're going to
[2:52:29.040 --> 2:52:36.320]  have to have your digital certificate your proof of vaccination simply to be allowed not just to fly
[2:52:36.320 --> 2:52:43.760]  but in other cases merely to enter different venues even suggesting maybe even taxis and trains you
[2:52:43.760 --> 2:52:51.120]  won't even be able to use those unless you've submitted to the shop but this is far a far
[2:52:51.120 --> 2:52:57.040]  bigger agenda than just the shop than just the economic aspects which we talk about before the
[2:52:57.040 --> 2:53:02.560]  break because of course we have the great reset now i talked with kandace about how fact checkers
[2:53:02.560 --> 2:53:09.840]  work to relegate important and true statements and articles by slapping hoaxes by slapping fact
[2:53:09.840 --> 2:53:15.440]  check warnings of them and of course that relegates the content within the algorithms of social media
[2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:22.480]  corporations so we have that taking place we also have this and this is an article that i flashed
[2:53:22.480 --> 2:53:27.360]  back to again and again and again because it relates to that to that fact checking process
[2:53:28.720 --> 2:53:32.560]  but the new york times last week and other organizations came out once again and they're
[2:53:32.560 --> 2:53:38.000]  doing this on a daily basis and telling people that the great reset is just a conspiracy theory
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:42.720]  either it doesn't exist or it does exist and it's a good thing it's just if you say it's a
[2:53:42.720 --> 2:53:48.480]  bad thing then suddenly it does exist it doesn't exist because we had prime minister just in trudeau
[2:53:48.480 --> 2:53:55.840]  come out back in september and tell the world that the coronavirus pandemic was an excuse for a quote
[2:53:55.840 --> 2:54:02.800]  reset uh reporters literally asked him about that when it re-emerged a couple of months later
[2:54:03.440 --> 2:54:08.560]  just in trudeau lied and what did he call it he called it a conspiracy theory even though
[2:54:08.560 --> 2:54:14.880]  those very words came out of his mouth we have claus schwaab writing a book called covid 19 the
[2:54:14.880 --> 2:54:21.280]  great reset literally saying that this goes way beyond medical martial law this goes way beyond a
[2:54:21.280 --> 2:54:28.640]  vaccine this goes to implantable microchip something that we've been talking about for the past 20
[2:54:28.640 --> 2:54:36.400]  years plus and a quote from his book says quote as capabilities in this area improve you have to
[2:54:36.400 --> 2:54:41.920]  imagine him saying this in a dr strangelove style voice the temptation for law enforcement
[2:54:41.920 --> 2:54:46.880]  agencies and courts to use techniques to determine the likelihood of criminal activity assess guilt
[2:54:46.880 --> 2:54:53.360]  or even possibly retrieve memories directly from people's brains will increase what is that it's
[2:54:53.360 --> 2:55:00.080]  literally a minority report style pre-crime program he says people will need potentially
[2:55:00.080 --> 2:55:05.440]  brain scans to cross borders and he also makes it clear that implantable microchips will be the
[2:55:05.440 --> 2:55:11.840]  cornerstone of a transhumanist agenda that will merge man with machine today's external device
[2:55:11.840 --> 2:55:16.560]  is from wearable computers to virtual reality headsets will almost become implantable in our
[2:55:16.560 --> 2:55:22.160]  bodies and brains so they want the implantable microchip as a result of this covid hysteria
[2:55:22.800 --> 2:55:31.040]  they also want you to eat weeds now we've seen over the course of the past two years even more
[2:55:31.040 --> 2:55:36.560]  perhaps this push for people in the name of preventing global warming and man-made climate
[2:55:36.560 --> 2:55:42.960]  change to eat bugs because they're such a great source of protein and you're probably racist if
[2:55:42.960 --> 2:55:50.160]  you think that's disgusting well now headline out of moon battery dot com let them eat weeds
[2:55:50.800 --> 2:55:56.000]  our globalist moon bat overlords not only want us to eat insects they also want us to eat weeds
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:56:02.080]  this is from our friends at the world economic forum who by the way have blocked me on twitter
[2:56:02.080 --> 2:56:06.880]  they blocked a bunch of other people who question their agenda because they're totally above board
[2:56:06.880 --> 2:56:12.240]  with it it says finding a new plant-based food is becoming increasingly urgent with the world
[2:56:12.240 --> 2:56:18.800]  population due to grow by two billion in the next 30 years it says that you know bugs will be one
[2:56:18.800 --> 2:56:25.600]  aspect of that but the other solution will be to eat weeds because they're easy to grow contain
[2:56:25.600 --> 2:56:34.720]  nutrients a diet needs diversity and they say weeds taste great so you're going to have a side
[2:56:34.720 --> 2:56:40.560]  salad serving of weeds with your crickets with your bugs we've got that to look forward to
[2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:46.320]  our new globalist overlords we'll be right back don't go most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional
[2:56:46.320 --> 2:56:51.280]  criminal lockdowns directed by the communist chinese and the united nations and now because
[2:56:51.280 --> 2:56:57.360]  the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient the worst australian models of complete lockdowns
[2:56:57.360 --> 2:57:02.400]  you can't even leave your house for months and months are being announced and in germany the
[2:57:02.400 --> 2:57:07.600]  police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast men women and children that
[2:57:07.600 --> 2:57:12.320]  protests the fact that merkel the dictator has put them under her control that's right she's been
[2:57:12.320 --> 2:57:18.080]  rigging elections for years and years and the same thing is coming here to the united states this is
[2:57:18.080 --> 2:57:23.920]  world government in philadelphia they've announced four people are more seen together will be arrested
[2:57:23.920 --> 2:57:28.400]  they're announcing the christmas is cancelled this is what the communist takeover looks like
[2:57:28.400 --> 2:57:34.160]  to bankrupt you to take rid of all your due process and absolutely transform the world
[2:57:34.160 --> 2:57:40.320]  into a prison planet how long have we warned you about this but you can fight back america is the
[2:57:40.320 --> 2:57:53.040]  last bastion stop submitting broadcasting internationally from the summit dot news headquarters
[2:57:53.040 --> 2:58:02.400]  in the united kingdom it's paul joseph watson we're live and we're talking about our future
[2:58:02.400 --> 2:58:07.040]  diet which apparently not only includes bugs but thanks to our globalist overlords at the world
[2:58:07.040 --> 2:58:12.960]  economic forum will soon include weeds now of course they're not going to be eating weeds
[2:58:12.960 --> 2:58:17.760]  they're not going to be eating bugs but they're going to expect you to do so because again this
[2:58:17.760 --> 2:58:25.120]  is all tied into the economic agenda which is a lowering of living standards we already have
[2:58:26.160 --> 2:58:32.640]  laws being introduced in the united kingdom that will completely ban the sale of all petrol vehicles
[2:58:32.640 --> 2:58:39.760]  within 10 years we have these massive programs of carbon reduction zero carbon which can only
[2:58:39.760 --> 2:58:46.080]  come with a massive decrease in your quality your standard of living that's been proven it's been
[2:58:46.080 --> 2:58:51.360]  proven that the green economy doesn't even work in places like spain where they tried to introduce
[2:58:51.360 --> 2:59:00.400]  it in a major way it led to 50 youth unemployment and 25 percent overall unemployment so these ideas
[2:59:00.400 --> 2:59:05.840]  are completely harebrained they don't work in reality the elite won't be subject themselves
[2:59:05.840 --> 2:59:12.240]  to any of these things but you the pleb the commoner will it be expected not only to limit your
[2:59:12.240 --> 2:59:18.480]  travel your consumption your quality of life but you'll also be expected to change your diet and
[2:59:18.480 --> 2:59:25.120]  yes the world economic forum the same group behind the great reset which they're bragging about as
[2:59:25.120 --> 2:59:29.680]  such a great thing but then if you question them about it on social media they'll literally block
[2:59:29.680 --> 2:59:36.320]  you that's quite the thing isn't it you don't normally get either government officials government
[2:59:36.320 --> 2:59:43.200]  bodies or globalist bodies deliberately going on twitter and blocking individuals who criticize
[2:59:43.200 --> 2:59:49.040]  their agenda kind of suggests to me that their agenda isn't really going to be that great for
[2:59:49.040 --> 2:59:55.760]  the little man not going to be really that great and that's been born that's been born to fruition
[2:59:55.760 --> 2:59:59.920]  what we've already experienced economically with the pandemic with the lockdown as i mentioned
[2:59:59.920 --> 3:00:06.720]  before the break massive monumental profits for amazon for all the ceo's small businesses going
[3:00:06.720 --> 3:00:11.840]  bust and yet the very people supporting those lockdown policies which led to that economic
[3:00:11.840 --> 3:00:19.280]  situation and now saying give us more power we'll redistribute the wealth we'll take care of everyone
[3:00:19.280 --> 3:00:25.360]  oh by the way their idea of taking care of everyone is by literally having you on a de facto house
[3:00:25.360 --> 3:00:29.840]  arrest you're not going to need to work a job but then you're going to have no incentive to get up
[3:00:29.840 --> 3:00:33.520]  in the morning you're going to be even more miserable you're going to hate yourself because
[3:00:33.520 --> 3:00:39.440]  you're not going to have any self-autonomy whatsoever but the one saving grace is that you
[3:00:39.440 --> 3:00:46.240]  will have a diet of weeds and bugs they're literally telling us we're going to start eating weeds this
[3:00:46.240 --> 3:00:56.320]  is from the world economic forum website we forum org weeds good food control climate change that's
[3:00:56.320 --> 3:01:02.000]  the url and there's a breakdown of this on moon battery dot com it says while farming animals
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:08.800]  for me generates 14.5 percent of total global greenhouse emissions weeds capture carbon from
[3:01:08.800 --> 3:01:13.280]  the atmosphere and can therefore help to control climate change now i don't know about you i've
[3:01:13.280 --> 3:01:18.240]  never eaten weeds i can't imagine they're that tasty but apparently this is what we're going to
[3:01:18.240 --> 3:01:24.480]  have to do for mother earth the elite in their ivory towers will still be dining on fillet steak
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:31.280]  but you'll be eating grasshoppers and plants invasive species many of them but i'm sure they
[3:01:31.280 --> 3:01:38.720]  taste delicious dave blount comments on this he says eating a normal human diet makes it to be too
[3:01:38.720 --> 3:01:44.720]  warm out according to progressive doctrine so we must find alternatives they list they go on to list
[3:01:44.720 --> 3:01:51.920]  the advantages of eating weeds including that they taste great big doubt big doubt on that
[3:01:51.920 --> 3:01:57.760]  says another benefit is the low price of weeds many can be had for free the next time a panhandler
[3:01:57.760 --> 3:02:02.560]  approaches your car at stoplight point to the tasty and nutritious weeds sprouting up through
[3:02:02.560 --> 3:02:07.840]  the cracks in the pavement the people have probably been peeing on no doubt and tell him
[3:02:07.840 --> 3:02:13.440]  bon appetit most details of life after the great reset remain a mystery but at least we have a
[3:02:13.440 --> 3:02:19.920]  good idea what will be on the menu for those of us who don't hobnob at davos bugs and weeds
[3:02:19.920 --> 3:02:24.640]  now there's all these hippies out there who claim oh no actually you're being a little bit bigoted
[3:02:24.640 --> 3:02:30.640]  and a little bit close-minded bugs actually do taste no they don't know they don't you see travel
[3:02:30.640 --> 3:02:39.200]  videos all across youtube of people trying bugs at malaysian or vietnamese markets just for the
[3:02:39.200 --> 3:02:45.280]  you know the open-minded travel experience of sampling new cultures even the people living
[3:02:45.280 --> 3:02:50.400]  in those countries they ask them do you eat these bugs now they don't eat the bugs they're disgusting
[3:02:51.760 --> 3:02:56.080]  i know people eat some weird things in the world and sometimes those weird things don't
[3:02:56.080 --> 3:03:04.000]  actually taste too bad bugs on in that category you watch any travel youtuber there's one
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:10.240]  bug stand in the market not very popular from what i've seen even with the local population
[3:03:10.800 --> 3:03:18.400]  many of whom can't afford to eat beef on a regular basis not very popular i mean look at the side of
[3:03:18.400 --> 3:03:24.080]  it just look how can that not cause you to just naturally convulse but that's what the world
[3:03:24.080 --> 3:03:30.720]  economic forum wants you to eat and they've been introducing this idea for many many years in fact
[3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:37.200]  there's an article here which i wrote last year texas art museum encourages children to eat bugs
[3:03:37.760 --> 3:03:42.720]  an art museum in texas encourages children and families to eat insects including crickets and
[3:03:42.720 --> 3:03:48.880]  mealworms during its eat a bug day this past weekend we had another one and i think i included
[3:03:48.880 --> 3:03:56.720]  this in a video bugs are also a fetish a sexual fetish for weirdos vise showcases fetish of
[3:03:56.720 --> 3:04:04.560]  people who incorporate bugs into their sex lives we had that wondrous presentation last year so
[3:04:04.560 --> 3:04:11.520]  this is our collective future mealworms crickets weeds while claus schwaub and his technocrat
[3:04:11.520 --> 3:04:18.080]  elitist friends continue to dine on fine fillet steak in their ivory towers but they really care
[3:04:18.080 --> 3:04:23.200]  about us and they're going to reset the economy even though what they've already done in this
[3:04:23.200 --> 3:04:29.440]  10 months since covid has put tons of people out of business they're losing their jobs small
[3:04:29.440 --> 3:04:34.560]  business is going bust amazon record profits walmart record profits target record profits
[3:04:34.560 --> 3:04:41.200]  but just give them more power you can trust them meanwhile the people protesting against that
[3:04:41.200 --> 3:04:48.160]  agenda continue to be arrested in massive numbers across the world a couple of weeks ago we had
[3:04:48.160 --> 3:04:54.960]  big protests in denmark that was successful in that they pressured the government into stripping
[3:04:54.960 --> 3:05:00.960]  out a bill which would have mandated vaccines for certain groups of people that was a white pill
[3:05:00.960 --> 3:05:05.680]  they were out on the streets protesting against that similar scenes in germany where they got
[3:05:05.680 --> 3:05:12.000]  out the water cannons massive opposition to lockdown in germany and we see it building in the uk
[3:05:12.960 --> 3:05:18.080]  of course we have warnings from police chiefs saying that this could eventually lead to wider
[3:05:18.080 --> 3:05:25.280]  civil unrest we had a protest another protest in london on the weekend bbc news headline covid more
[3:05:25.280 --> 3:05:31.600]  than 150 arrests at london anti-lockdown protest there's more than 150 people have been arrested
[3:05:31.600 --> 3:05:37.440]  during anti-lockdown protests in london's west end the group save our rights uk said it held the
[3:05:37.440 --> 3:05:43.040]  protest on marble arch on saturday afternoon metropolis and police said it had been a challenging
[3:05:43.040 --> 3:05:51.040]  day for its officers yeah somewhat different from how they responded to much larger black lives matter
[3:05:51.040 --> 3:05:56.560]  protests in june where the individuals who took part in that were literally violently attacking
[3:05:56.560 --> 3:06:04.160]  police officers vandalizing statues trying to drag down statues and what was the response from the
[3:06:04.160 --> 3:06:10.240]  metropolitan police they bowed down and they worshipped this group which i imagine was probably
[3:06:10.240 --> 3:06:18.400]  about 1500 people maybe a little more 150 of them were arrested they literally arrested about 10
[3:06:18.400 --> 3:06:23.920]  percent of the people who showed up how many arrests were there during the months and months
[3:06:23.920 --> 3:06:30.720]  of black lives matter protests in london basically a handful on each occasion but again they want to
[3:06:30.720 --> 3:06:35.760]  make examples of people they want to see they want other people to see this is what happens
[3:06:36.560 --> 3:06:43.040]  when you defy our covid restrictions and this is may what may be what happens if you defy
[3:06:43.040 --> 3:06:51.360]  taking the vaccine meanwhile elvis impersonators solo house party crashed by cops this is a video
[3:06:51.360 --> 3:06:58.880]  that came out on friday basically a guy was live streaming his elvis impersonation on the internet
[3:06:58.880 --> 3:07:04.240]  and there's a video in this article he had his back turned to the entrance of his living room
[3:07:04.960 --> 3:07:10.960]  and about 10 seconds into the clip four police officers burst in he thinks they're intruders
[3:07:10.960 --> 3:07:16.960]  he goes and tries to attack them because they've rushed into his home that falls rushed in pun
[3:07:16.960 --> 3:07:23.600]  intended again because he was making noise and they suspected he was having a house party in
[3:07:23.600 --> 3:07:29.840]  violation of covid rules so with no warrant whatsoever they just burst into his house could
[3:07:29.840 --> 3:07:35.280]  have ended up in a more violent confrontation absolutely ridiculous it was one guy on his
[3:07:35.280 --> 3:07:41.760]  own doing an elvis impersonation on the internet this is our world this is life right now we'll be
[3:07:41.760 --> 3:07:48.240]  live it really is simple the left are into being deviant and i don't mean sexually deviant that
[3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:53.200]  goes to territory i'm talking about deviant against their ancestors deviant against their own
[3:07:53.200 --> 3:07:59.120]  species deviant against the order of nature even though that deviance is destructive and poisonous
[3:07:59.120 --> 3:08:04.400]  they still do it because they want to play god everything they touch they destroy their their
[3:08:04.400 --> 3:08:10.720]  sacrament is affording babies and then using their body parts their their religion is not taking care
[3:08:10.720 --> 3:08:16.000]  of the old but euthanizing them their whole system is designed for the un to keep their world countries
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:21.120]  in serious poverty and poor ballooning populations and then watching all that new fruit down the
[3:08:21.120 --> 3:08:27.360]  vine to continually reproduce the same nightmares over and over and over again they truly are the
[3:08:27.360 --> 3:08:30.960]  children of satan they are the children of the devil and if you look at the slaves that serve
[3:08:30.960 --> 3:08:36.960]  them byton and kamala harris it really is manifested being a slave of satan is not profitable soon is
[3:08:36.960 --> 3:08:44.400]  not profitable i'm alex chance and this is the info war cognitive dissonance is a major issue
[3:08:44.400 --> 3:08:50.640]  amongst the left it can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you have a
[3:08:50.640 --> 3:08:56.000]  family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition buy them a bottle of ultimate
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:09:01.920]  fish oil from info wars store dot com studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil
[3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:08.240]  supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure decrease triglyceride levels decrease the growth
[3:09:08.240 --> 3:09:14.080]  rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses and joints and the
[3:09:14.080 --> 3:09:21.520]  digestive system recent studies have suggested that high epa and dha fish oil can stimulate
[3:09:21.520 --> 3:09:27.920]  immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells it worked for my
[3:09:27.920 --> 3:09:34.640]  family and now i can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to
[3:09:34.640 --> 3:09:41.120]  reality get your ultimate fish oil for a friend family member or yourself at info wars store dot
[3:09:41.120 --> 3:10:05.040]  com you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:10:05.040 --> 3:10:13.280]  now we have increased discussion in the united kingdom and also in the united states about
[3:10:13.280 --> 3:10:19.760]  this vaccine which is set to come to market in a month or two obviously the vulnerable individuals
[3:10:19.760 --> 3:10:24.560]  are going to be offered it first and everybody else is going to be offered it and then maybe
[3:10:24.560 --> 3:10:30.640]  corporation service providers are going to step in and say well if you don't take it you're not
[3:10:30.640 --> 3:10:36.800]  coming in that's going to be a problem in the uk because 30 percent 36 percent of people in a recent
[3:10:36.800 --> 3:10:44.240]  poll said they were extremely or very unlikely to take this vaccine are these restaurants these
[3:10:44.240 --> 3:10:50.640]  bars these sports venues these cinemas really going to potentially sacrifice 36 percent of their
[3:10:50.640 --> 3:10:59.040]  customer base by mandating digital proof of a coronavirus vaccine before allowing people to
[3:10:59.040 --> 3:11:06.400]  enter their premises well that's certainly what vaccine minister nadhim zahawi in the uk expects
[3:11:07.040 --> 3:11:10.480]  and in fact we've got a clip of this which we're going to play here in a second
[3:11:11.840 --> 3:11:16.960]  headline vaccine minister says bars restaurants and cinemas will demand proof of vaccination
[3:11:16.960 --> 3:11:23.840]  before entry this is uk vaccine minister nadhim zahawi who says he expects all those venues
[3:11:23.840 --> 3:11:29.680]  to demand proof of vaccination against covert 19 before allowing customers to enter their venues
[3:11:30.400 --> 3:11:36.160]  this was an interview on bbc radio's the world at one and we have a clip of that and we're going to
[3:11:36.160 --> 3:11:42.240]  play that right now here it is okay but it presumably it will be the case that if you have a vaccine
[3:11:42.240 --> 3:11:47.120]  you will then have some form of immunity passport and we know that baroness harding who's running
[3:11:47.120 --> 3:11:52.320]  test and traces is looking at this idea of even having it in the app the proof of your vaccine
[3:11:52.320 --> 3:11:57.040]  status so that is presumably going to limit what some people do if you want to go to a football
[3:11:57.040 --> 3:12:02.800]  game for example if you want to get on a flight we are looking at the technology and of course
[3:12:02.800 --> 3:12:08.080]  a way of people being able to inform their gp that they've been vaccinated but also i think you'll
[3:12:08.080 --> 3:12:14.960]  probably find restaurants and bars and and cinemas and other venues sports venues will probably also
[3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:18.800]  use that system as they've done with the app the reason i think partly the app's been so successful
[3:12:18.800 --> 3:12:25.440]  i think we're touching just under 19 million downloads of the app is because a lot of places
[3:12:25.440 --> 3:12:31.680]  that you would go to they've got the qr code from the nhs that you scan for your own safety and so
[3:12:31.680 --> 3:12:38.160]  i think the in many ways the the sort of the pressure will come from both ways from service
[3:12:38.160 --> 3:12:44.400]  providers who will say look you know demonstrate to us that you've been vaccinated but also we
[3:12:44.400 --> 3:12:48.880]  will make the technology as easy and as excessive as possible okay so it'll be it'll become virtually
[3:12:48.880 --> 3:12:52.640]  impossible to do anything if you don't have the vaccine i see the people have to make a decision
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:12:58.240]  but i think you'll you'll probably find many service providers who will want uh to engage in
[3:12:58.240 --> 3:13:04.720]  this in the way they did with the app so what is that other than people basically being under
[3:13:04.720 --> 3:13:10.800]  permanent lockdown one of the main drawbacks of lockdown of course is that the bars the restaurants
[3:13:10.800 --> 3:13:16.960]  the cinemas the sports venues the entertainment arenas the music concerts are all closed cutting
[3:13:16.960 --> 3:13:21.760]  off social life for millions of millions of people now if you don't take the vaccine and
[3:13:21.760 --> 3:13:26.560]  they don't allow you in because you haven't got digital proof of having had the injection
[3:13:27.280 --> 3:13:33.360]  what is that other than a form of permanent lockdown for everyone 36 percent of brits say
[3:13:33.360 --> 3:13:38.640]  they're not going to take it are those industries really going to sacrifice another 36 percent of
[3:13:38.640 --> 3:13:44.400]  their customer base given that their profits are already in the toilet to mandate this vaccine
[3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:49.680]  that's going to be an interesting question going forward but when you've got the uk vaccine minister
[3:13:49.680 --> 3:13:56.080]  saying that this goes straight to the point they don't have to make it compulsory by law they just
[3:13:56.080 --> 3:14:02.000]  get service providers corporations businesses companies to enforce it of course you had the
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:09.280]  head hon show over the NHS trace and test and trace program which they introduced a few months ago
[3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:14.960]  here in the uk basically whenever you go into a bar a restaurant when they're allowed to be open
[3:14:15.680 --> 3:14:20.880]  you have to sign a form if you don't have the app you have to give your name and address
[3:14:20.880 --> 3:14:26.800]  then you're in the system then if anybody in the immediate vicinity reports having caught coronavirus
[3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:32.320]  you get contacted by the NHS and then you're expected to self-isolate for two weeks if you
[3:14:32.320 --> 3:14:38.400]  don't do so you get fine if you continue to refuse you get a bigger and bigger fine the head of that
[3:14:38.400 --> 3:14:45.680]  program admitted that that was the foundational basis for the future recording of whether people
[3:14:45.680 --> 3:14:53.120]  have had the vaccine or not she said the NHS app this is baroness harding she said the NHS app will
[3:14:53.120 --> 3:14:59.600]  be used to quote record as a citizen your test results and whether you've been vaccinated so
[3:14:59.600 --> 3:15:05.760]  you have the head of the test and trace program saying that you have the uk vaccine minister
[3:15:05.760 --> 3:15:12.080]  saying that this newly created position but then you have this out of michael gove another cabinet
[3:15:12.080 --> 3:15:18.960]  minister headline gove claims government not considering vaccine passports to enter venues
[3:15:18.960 --> 3:15:24.240]  cabinet office minister michael gove contradicted his own government's vaccine minister by asserting
[3:15:24.240 --> 3:15:30.080]  there was no plan to issue vaccination passports that would be required before people were allowed
[3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:35.360]  to enter bars restaurants and other venues by the way if you go to a bar on a saturday night in
[3:15:35.360 --> 3:15:40.640]  london there's no way they're enforcing this program it's complete bedlam so on a practical
[3:15:40.640 --> 3:15:45.520]  level it's not even going to work in the first place but gove is coming out and contradicting
[3:15:45.520 --> 3:15:51.440]  other people within his own government and saying that this won't be mandated by government
[3:15:51.440 --> 3:15:57.040]  but then again will that matter because the companies can just go ahead and mandate it anyway
[3:15:57.040 --> 3:16:04.400]  we had the CEO of quantas airlines out of australia come out last week and say basically no vaccination
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:12.000]  no flight on the flip side we had ryan air which is a european airline in the european union which
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:18.000]  operates between countries in europe saying they're not going to mandate mandatory vaccines to fly
[3:16:18.880 --> 3:16:23.040]  because of people of course europe has open borders basically you can just drive between
[3:16:23.040 --> 3:16:28.960]  all the different countries so there's really no point whatsoever so mixed messages across
[3:16:28.960 --> 3:16:33.840]  the board whether this is going to mandatory in terms of how it's enforced by companies or not
[3:16:34.960 --> 3:16:39.280]  but as regards to the propaganda behind the vaccine itself we have this headline
[3:16:39.280 --> 3:16:47.280]  uk deploys military info war unit against covid vaccine skeptics the british government has mobilized
[3:16:47.280 --> 3:16:53.680]  an elite information warfare unit to combat anti-vaccine militants and interrupt their
[3:16:53.680 --> 3:16:59.840]  propaganda content which of course is going to percolate down and be represented with anyone
[3:16:59.840 --> 3:17:05.680]  on social media being censored being banned for questioning not just the safety of this vaccine
[3:17:05.680 --> 3:17:11.040]  and again that's the point i don't care if it's safe if you set the precedent where governments
[3:17:11.040 --> 3:17:17.280]  or corporations can demand you had somebody stick a needle in your arm before you're allowed any
[3:17:17.280 --> 3:17:22.480]  freedom of mobility that has to be the red line if you let them get away with that what are they
[3:17:22.480 --> 3:17:28.960]  going to get away with next it's not even about the efficacy the safety of the vaccine it's about
[3:17:28.960 --> 3:17:35.520]  the complete imposition on our freedom of mobility it's about basically being under de facto lockdown
[3:17:35.520 --> 3:17:41.840]  forever if you're one of the refuse nix who doesn't take it the report says the unit
[3:17:42.480 --> 3:17:48.160]  is usually used to assist with operations against al-qaeda and the taliban so they're
[3:17:48.160 --> 3:17:55.840]  literally using propaganda units normally used to fight terrorists to fight people who question
[3:17:55.840 --> 3:18:03.840]  either the safety or the sanity of handing governments the power to mandate vaccines
[3:18:03.840 --> 3:18:10.320]  it will be turned on those who dare question the sanctity of covid vaccination the report
[3:18:10.320 --> 3:18:15.360]  notes the outfit known as the defense cultural specialist unit was formed in afghanistan in
[3:18:15.360 --> 3:18:23.360]  2010 and is part of the army's 77th brigade so they're literally using military psychological
[3:18:23.360 --> 3:18:28.400]  operations units out of the army not to fight terrorists and we're going to have a bigger
[3:18:28.400 --> 3:18:33.040]  problem with terrorists by the way as i'm going to get into after the break probably because of
[3:18:33.040 --> 3:18:39.360]  biden's foreign policy not to fight terrorists but to fight people who question the covid vaccine
[3:18:39.360 --> 3:18:45.040]  so make that news we'll be back don't go away you can't have thanksgiving you can't have christmas
[3:18:46.480 --> 3:18:48.960]  the globalists and their minions want to play god
[3:18:49.920 --> 3:18:55.920]  chucky schumer hillary clinton barack obama you look at these sacks of garbage and you think
[3:18:55.920 --> 3:19:03.040]  why do they hate humanity so much why do they love death because they hate themselves they project
[3:19:03.040 --> 3:19:09.600]  their own disgust with their soul onto us and once you understand that basic psychological
[3:19:09.600 --> 3:19:15.360]  point every other answer is completely clear that's why they hate info wars we believe in
[3:19:15.360 --> 3:19:20.880]  humanity we think you're beautiful we think you're amazing info wars knows you're fallen
[3:19:20.880 --> 3:19:25.920]  but that you have god's potential that god gave you ladies and gentlemen the great epic battle
[3:19:25.920 --> 3:19:29.920]  is now here it's now upon us i want to encourage you all to spread the word about info wars now
[3:19:29.920 --> 3:19:34.480]  more than ever when the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth we know you're gonna
[3:19:34.480 --> 3:19:38.080]  override these globalists we know you're gonna defeat them i just want to salute you all for
[3:19:38.080 --> 3:19:42.960]  your action everything you've already done because god's on our side and the globalists know it
[3:19:42.960 --> 3:19:52.400]  imagine a dystopic novel or a dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold you can
[3:19:52.400 --> 3:19:58.080]  be locked up in your home you can be taken away you can be forcibly inoculated with drugs that
[3:19:58.080 --> 3:20:03.520]  mass greatest vaccines that actually change your very dna that's where you are in the year 2020
[3:20:03.520 --> 3:20:07.840]  global government the united nations all these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it they
[3:20:07.840 --> 3:20:14.160]  even admit that they're doing it for power and control and that they're not even worried about
[3:20:14.160 --> 3:20:19.840]  kevin 19 that's what claus swath the others have said think about how to say that as oh and big
[3:20:19.840 --> 3:20:23.600]  tech's got to track you they've got to trace you they've got to control you you've got to have
[3:20:23.600 --> 3:20:29.120]  absolutely your house why you've got to have secret police come disappear you because my god this
[3:20:29.120 --> 3:20:33.680]  thing has one tenth of one percent chance of killing you give your ability to get cancer
[3:20:33.680 --> 3:20:40.240]  or heart attack this is their takeover imagine on america's death certificate killed by the fear of
[3:20:40.240 --> 3:20:47.760]  the common cold yeah that's fair monitoring that's my control the great reset where have i heard of
[3:20:47.760 --> 3:20:54.560]  that before oh the great leap forward now stay tongue ordering all the small towns and small
[3:20:54.560 --> 3:20:59.440]  farms to basically shut down and have the rural people and the small business people move into
[3:20:59.440 --> 3:21:04.960]  the big cities and go under communist commune control and that's all this is the big mega banks
[3:21:04.960 --> 3:21:08.560]  want to break us of the same ones that put now stay tongue into power and they're creating the
[3:21:08.560 --> 3:21:13.760]  process of getting rid of our old economy bringing in the new economy where everything's free because
[3:21:13.760 --> 3:21:18.880]  when you're a prisoner well everything's free but you're also a slave scotland is going to have
[3:21:18.880 --> 3:21:23.920]  universal guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level but of course you got to take those vaccines
[3:21:23.920 --> 3:21:29.680]  you can't have any kids and oh and don't worry though all of the tampons and stuff like that's
[3:21:29.680 --> 3:21:34.800]  free too as well i'm not kidding so they'll give me some free paper they give me enough money to
[3:21:34.800 --> 3:21:39.680]  basically live in a tiny apartment but they own you they control you that's the great reset that's
[3:21:39.680 --> 3:21:44.080]  why it's got to be resisted to total takeover and we're fighting it at info wars dot com
[3:21:44.080 --> 3:21:51.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:22:04.640 --> 3:22:10.720]  back and we're gonna go now to a youtube video that i put up on friday regarding the absolute
[3:22:10.720 --> 3:22:17.840]  horror that awaits america if joe biden is allowed into the oval office if you thought the foreign
[3:22:17.840 --> 3:22:23.840]  policy of barack obama and hillary clinton was bad in terms of invading libya in terms of invading
[3:22:23.840 --> 3:22:30.480]  jihadist in syria uh was a negative impact on the world in regard to the rise of isis terrorism
[3:22:31.120 --> 3:22:36.000]  and the future of america in terms of this internet interventionist foreign policy
[3:22:36.000 --> 3:22:40.880]  hellscape then it's only going to get worse then we're going to come back and talk about the latest
[3:22:40.880 --> 3:22:46.080]  with regard to election fraud now that attorney general bar has come out and said basically
[3:22:46.080 --> 3:22:50.160]  there's no evidence of election fraud we're going to come back and talk about that but for the rest
[3:22:50.160 --> 3:23:06.640]  of this segment here is the video it's called meet the new boss let's roll it
[3:23:13.760 --> 3:23:19.040]  enjoyed the last four years of relative peace in the middle east felt safer after isis was bombed
[3:23:19.040 --> 3:23:24.320]  into near oblivion thankful that your tax dollars aren't funding arms for jihadists so get ready
[3:23:24.320 --> 3:23:29.680]  to dispense with all that because the neoliberal war machine is back remember that weird couple
[3:23:29.680 --> 3:23:34.960]  of days back in 2017 when trump ordered the bombing of the syrian airfield it was the one
[3:23:34.960 --> 3:23:41.440]  single time over the past four years that the mainstream media praised something he did ms mbc's
[3:23:41.440 --> 3:23:47.920]  brian williams called the missiles beautiful three times in the space of 30 seconds we see these
[3:23:47.920 --> 3:23:54.320]  beautiful pictures at night from the decks of these two us navy vessels in the eastern
[3:23:54.320 --> 3:24:00.480]  Mediterranean i'm guided by the beauty of our weapons um and they are beautiful pictures well
[3:24:00.480 --> 3:24:05.200]  williams and his ilka gonna be creaming their pants over the next four years if biden gets into
[3:24:05.200 --> 3:24:11.040]  office because the same people who masterminded the disastrous invasion of libya and the catastrophic
[3:24:11.040 --> 3:24:18.000]  policy of attempted regime change in syria are back like a bitch in heat your biden america is back
[3:24:18.000 --> 3:24:24.240]  syrian children right now biden has tapped this guy antony blinkin as secretary of state to head
[3:24:24.240 --> 3:24:30.000]  up foreign policy and he was immediately lavished with praise by the mainstream media the guardian
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:36.320]  gushed calling him a born internationalist who will utilize his urbane bilingual charm to
[3:24:36.320 --> 3:24:41.360]  soothe the frayed nerves of western allies they marveled at his previous appearance on sesame
[3:24:41.360 --> 3:24:47.200]  street where he regaled rover about the wondrous benefits and desperate hardships of refugees
[3:24:47.200 --> 3:24:53.040]  i'm talking about refugees these are people who've had to leave their homes because life in their
[3:24:53.040 --> 3:24:58.320]  countries was not safe for them and why was that mr blinkin do you think it had anything to do with
[3:24:58.320 --> 3:25:04.000]  the obama administration which you are a part of toppling secular leaders like gadafi do you think
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:09.120]  it had anything to do with the obama administration which you were a part of arming jihadist groups
[3:25:09.120 --> 3:25:14.800]  in syria in an attempt to topple a sad the administration's policies that you helped craft
[3:25:14.800 --> 3:25:20.000]  created the power vacuum that was filled by isis which in turn caused the international migrant
[3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:25.600]  crisis you vehemently supported the calamitous foreign policy that created all these refugees
[3:25:25.600 --> 3:25:31.040]  in the first place remember gadafi's warning that the Mediterranean would become a sea of chaos
[3:25:31.040 --> 3:25:35.680]  well that's precisely what happened because of people in the old barma state department
[3:25:35.680 --> 3:25:41.840]  like tony blinkin oh but mr blinkin really cares about the refugees his administration made them
[3:25:41.840 --> 3:25:48.640]  refugees by over their countries well grover sadly refugees have to leave everything behind
[3:25:49.360 --> 3:25:56.080]  communities schools friends even all of their favorite things don't know about that some of
[3:25:56.080 --> 3:26:11.120]  them appear to be doing just fine even the un admitted that 70 percent of them weren't even
[3:26:11.120 --> 3:26:15.920]  refugees they were economic migrants even though they come from many different places
[3:26:15.920 --> 3:26:21.600]  they're just like you and me yeah that's not strictly true is it you see tony here has failed
[3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:27.680]  to mention one crucial detail the obama administration's proxy support for jihadist thugs in libya
[3:26:27.680 --> 3:26:33.440]  and syria which led directly to the rise of isis which led directly to the migrant crisis also led
[3:26:33.440 --> 3:26:38.240]  to isis exploiting the refugee wave to smuggle terrorists into europe who went on to commit
[3:26:38.240 --> 3:26:43.440]  mass casualty atrocities oh don't take my word for it isis bragged about how they did this in
[3:26:43.440 --> 3:26:49.440]  their own propaganda magazine the manchester arena bomber was a refugee rescued by the royal navy
[3:26:49.440 --> 3:26:56.560]  from libya in 2014 the paris massacre terrorists hid themselves amongst the refugee wave to enter
[3:26:56.560 --> 3:27:02.240]  europe one of them was even carrying a fake syrian passport several of the brussels terrorists who
[3:27:02.240 --> 3:27:08.720]  helped plan the paris massacre also re-entered europe on the refugee wave having fought for isis
[3:27:08.720 --> 3:27:14.880]  in syria the berlin truck terrorist anis amry arrived in europe on a refugee boat the terrorist
[3:27:14.880 --> 3:27:19.600]  who stabbed three people in redding was a libian refugee the terrorist who beheaded the french
[3:27:19.600 --> 3:27:24.160]  school teacher was a refugee the terrorist who beheaded a woman and killed two others near a
[3:27:24.160 --> 3:27:29.760]  church in nise was a refugee a heritage foundation study found that more than a thousand people had
[3:27:29.760 --> 3:27:36.320]  been murdered or injured on european soil between 2014 and 2018 by asylum seekers or refugees starting
[3:27:36.320 --> 3:27:41.120]  to notice a pattern here they're just like you and me and no obviously i'm not saying that all
[3:27:41.120 --> 3:27:45.840]  refugees are terrorists many of them are trying to escape terrorism in their own countries i'm
[3:27:45.840 --> 3:27:52.000]  saying interventionist foreign policy creates a vacuum which is filled by violent islamists that
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:58.160]  drives people out of their countries on a refugee wave the refugee wave is then exploited by terrorists
[3:27:58.160 --> 3:28:04.160]  who go on to commit attacks in the west that was the obama administration's policy for eight years
[3:28:04.160 --> 3:28:10.480]  and under biden and blinkin it's on its way back that's right biden wants to boost america's refugee
[3:28:10.480 --> 3:28:18.640]  quota from 15 000 to 125 000 a year while isis was smuggling terror cells into europe obama was
[3:28:18.640 --> 3:28:24.480]  dropping leaflets on isis in syria while jihadists were radicalized across the continent to commit
[3:28:24.480 --> 3:28:31.360]  mass atrocities in paris niece brussels and berlin obama was afraid to even utter the words islamic
[3:28:31.360 --> 3:28:37.200]  terrorism whereas islamic terrorism in the west noticeably declined after trump began eliminating
[3:28:37.200 --> 3:28:42.880]  isis rather than arming them under biden and blinkin it's set for a revival radical islamists
[3:28:42.880 --> 3:28:48.320]  across the world must be licking their lips with glee blinkin is a died in the wall globalist a
[3:28:48.320 --> 3:28:53.520]  council on foreign relations member who once described brexit as a total mess and he's never
[3:28:53.520 --> 3:28:59.360]  come across a foreign intervention he didn't like not only did he enthusiastically support us nato
[3:28:59.360 --> 3:29:03.920]  regime change in libya according to the washington post blinkin was quote one of the government's
[3:29:03.920 --> 3:29:10.800]  key players in drafting syria policy he repeatedly justified arming syrian rebels on national news
[3:29:10.800 --> 3:29:16.640]  networks you want more blinkin supported israel's bombing of gaza in 2014 blinkin supported saudi
[3:29:16.640 --> 3:29:22.800]  arabia's barbarous bombing of yemen in 2015 he was obama's point man for providing weaponry to
[3:29:22.800 --> 3:29:29.680]  the saudi so u n went on to declare yemen the world's worst humanitarian disaster 100 000
[3:29:29.680 --> 3:29:35.680]  people dead that's right thanks tony and then of course the biggie the notoriously successful
[3:29:35.680 --> 3:29:41.840]  2003 us invasion of iraq which toppled another secular leader while bolstering al qaeda and
[3:29:41.840 --> 3:29:47.040]  li fg terrorist groups in the region as well as killing hundreds of thousands of people in the
[3:29:47.040 --> 3:29:53.760]  process including 5000 us troops maiming another 30 000 and leaving half a million with life
[3:29:53.760 --> 3:29:59.200]  debilitating ptsd yeah guess who vehemently supported that that's right in fact blinkin's
[3:29:59.200 --> 3:30:04.400]  role in overseeing the pivotal two-day senate hearing in the summer of 2002 directly greased
[3:30:04.400 --> 3:30:10.240]  the skids for the invasion of iraq this guy's bloodlust for war puts genghis khan to shame and
[3:30:10.240 --> 3:30:15.840]  unless trump turns it around in just two months time he's in charge of us foreign policy listen
[3:30:15.840 --> 3:30:22.320]  when someone's geopolitical agenda gets hillary clinton seal of approval watch out we came we saw
[3:30:22.320 --> 3:30:29.200]  he died you'll also be shocked to learn that blinkin despises whistleblowers like edward
[3:30:29.200 --> 3:30:34.000]  snowden and julian assange and wants them both extradited oh yeah and you remember those two
[3:30:34.000 --> 3:30:39.440]  other glorious components of pre-trump american foreign policy drone strikes and torture well
[3:30:39.440 --> 3:30:45.280]  under biden that's making a comeback too avril hains biden's pick for director of national
[3:30:45.280 --> 3:30:51.840]  intelligence provided legal cover for and worked closely with obama and brennan on obama's 10 fold
[3:30:51.840 --> 3:30:56.800]  expansion of drone strikes an expansion that she enthusiastically drove home despite the fact
[3:30:56.800 --> 3:31:02.400]  that 90 percent of the victims of drone strikes were innocent civilians oh but according to this
[3:31:02.400 --> 3:31:09.760]  simp and countless others on twitter she's the nicest human alive just a hunch but if your entire
[3:31:09.760 --> 3:31:15.280]  family's just been wiped out by an mq1 predator during a wedding ceremony those probably aren't
[3:31:15.280 --> 3:31:20.160]  the words i choose hains is also a member of the center for a new american security a think tank
[3:31:20.160 --> 3:31:25.840]  that has received millions of dollars in funding from weapons contractors cia director jena haspel
[3:31:25.840 --> 3:31:31.120]  will report directly to hains who has repeatedly sung the praises of haspel a key architect of
[3:31:31.120 --> 3:31:37.360]  president george w bush's torture program but i'm sure she's a nice person too the front runner to
[3:31:37.360 --> 3:31:42.960]  be joe biden's pick the secretary of defense is michelle flaunoy flaunoy is such a nice person
[3:31:42.960 --> 3:31:49.360]  that she ladies and gentlemen i hope we can stop the great reset that means a globalist imposed
[3:31:49.360 --> 3:31:54.240]  worldwide depression to break us and bring us under their control that's their stated admitted plan
[3:31:54.240 --> 3:31:59.280]  just introduce on record claus swabb all the different democrat mayors they admit it's clowered
[3:31:59.280 --> 3:32:04.240]  and pivot implode the economy to make us go into their control but if we expose they're the ones
[3:32:04.240 --> 3:32:08.960]  doing it they go to prison instead of getting total power and total control and there are major
[3:32:08.960 --> 3:32:13.520]  uprisings happening across the world during the us thousands of sheriffs are saying hell no to the

[3:33:12.560 --> 3:33:17.440]  it's the same in every single industry and the big megabanks have unlimited capital they want to

[3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:14.560]  well team trump continues to get absolutely no support from the federal government in regards
[3:36:14.560 --> 3:36:21.680]  to its attempt to legally professionally properly accurately count the votes in the us presidential
[3:36:21.680 --> 3:36:27.840]  election this headline came out just about an hour ago out of zero hedge white house slams a g bars
[3:36:27.840 --> 3:36:34.160]  claims of no election fraud there's been no semblance of a doj investigation this was attorney general
[3:36:34.160 --> 3:36:39.840]  william bar who said today the justice department has not uncovered evidence of widespread voter
[3:36:39.840 --> 3:36:45.520]  fraud that would change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election that was immediately
[3:36:45.520 --> 3:36:52.000]  challenged by trump's legal team by a rudy juliani who said with all due respect to the
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:57.440]  attorney general there hasn't been any semblance of a department of justice investigation we've
[3:36:57.440 --> 3:37:03.200]  gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states which they have not examined
[3:37:03.200 --> 3:37:07.440]  we have many witnesses swearing in a row they saw crimes being committed in connection with voter
[3:37:07.440 --> 3:37:12.800]  fraud as far as we know not a single one has been interviewed by the doj the justice department
[3:37:12.800 --> 3:37:18.000]  also hasn't audited any voting machines or used their subpoena powers to determine the truth so
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:23.520]  again yet another body within the federal government coming out and saying there's no evidence of
[3:37:23.520 --> 3:37:27.760]  voter fraud despite the fact they haven't even properly analyzed the actual evidence of voter
[3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:34.880]  fraud being presented which is being and will continue to be presented in the courts so we have
[3:37:34.880 --> 3:37:40.560]  that going on we also have this video which came back to prominence over the weekend and we're
[3:37:40.560 --> 3:37:47.440]  going to play here in a second out of of all places cnn and this caused a lot of consternation
[3:37:47.440 --> 3:37:54.480]  amongst the left headline cnn there are quote legal and constitutional ways for trump to stay in
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:38:02.000]  office this was a video released before the election and in this video cnn's farid zikaria
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:07.120]  explains the legal and constitutional case by which president trump could stay in office
[3:38:07.120 --> 3:38:13.600]  even if he loses the election they didn't like seeing this one pop up again and you'll find out
[3:38:13.600 --> 3:38:20.960]  why as we play it right now here it is that are legal and constitutional that could enable
[3:38:20.960 --> 3:38:27.280]  trump to stay in office without actually winning the vote the system of electing the president
[3:38:27.280 --> 3:38:33.280]  is complicated because it was not designed to be directly democratic the constitution calls
[3:38:33.280 --> 3:38:38.800]  for states to choose the presidential electors who in turn gather to vote for the president
[3:38:39.440 --> 3:38:45.680]  over time states have passed laws that ensured their state's popular vote for the presidency
[3:38:45.680 --> 3:38:52.560]  would determine the electors but those are laws not a constitutional obligation now imagine the
[3:38:52.560 --> 3:38:57.440]  scenario during election week trump is leading on november 3rd but joe biden pulls ahead in the
[3:38:57.440 --> 3:39:02.800]  days following republicans file objections to tens of thousands of mail-in ballots democrats
[3:39:02.800 --> 3:39:09.680]  file countersuits taking account of the confusion legislators decide to choose the electors themselves
[3:39:09.680 --> 3:39:17.840]  here's the worry of the nine swing states eight have republican legislatures if one or more decide
[3:39:17.840 --> 3:39:23.280]  that balloting is chaotic and marred by irregularities they could send what they regard as the
[3:39:23.280 --> 3:39:29.120]  legitimate slate of electors which would be republican democrats may object and file lawsuits
[3:39:29.120 --> 3:39:33.680]  in some of those states democratic governors or secretaries of state could send their own
[3:39:33.680 --> 3:39:39.600]  slates of electors to washington that would add to the confusion but that might well be part of
[3:39:39.600 --> 3:39:46.240]  the republican plan because you see when congress convenes on january 6th to tally the electors
[3:39:46.240 --> 3:39:52.240]  votes there would be challenges to the legitimacy of some electors it's possible congressional
[3:39:52.240 --> 3:39:58.000]  republicans could decide that disputed states should simply not be counted suppose in the
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:40:04.320]  scenario michigan's votes are invalidated that would ensure that neither candidate would get to
[3:40:04.320 --> 3:40:11.840]  270 electoral votes at that point the constitution clearly directs that the house of representatives
[3:40:11.840 --> 3:40:19.200]  vote to determine the presidential election but it does so with each state casting a single ballot
[3:40:20.240 --> 3:40:26.240]  if the current numbers hold there would be 26 state delegations that are republican and 23
[3:40:26.240 --> 3:40:31.280]  democratic with one tide so the outcome would be to re-elect donald trump
[3:40:32.000 --> 3:40:37.120]  trump doesn't need to do anything other than to simply accept this outcome which is constitutional
[3:40:38.560 --> 3:40:43.920]  so that caused a lot of consternation once leftist over the weekend desperately pointing out oh
[3:40:43.920 --> 3:40:49.040]  well this video was released before the election but it still stands doesn't it and you heard the
[3:40:49.040 --> 3:40:54.880]  explanation right there as to how trump or republicans if they actually grew a spine
[3:40:54.880 --> 3:41:00.160]  could actually challenge this election legally and constitutionally which now seems like an
[3:41:00.160 --> 3:41:07.280]  even more urgent thing given that ag bar of course busher pointe basically has now said that he's
[3:41:07.280 --> 3:41:14.000]  not going to stand behind the trump administration no real surprise there meanwhile we have this
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:22.000]  story which went viral actually last week again going to the point they say jump you say how high
[3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:27.920]  and it's not uh do as they do it's do as they say in terms of coronavirus lockdowns
[3:41:29.040 --> 3:41:34.400]  headline doctor who demanded mandatory mask law pictured partying maskless on boat
[3:41:34.960 --> 3:41:41.520]  surrounded by bikini clad women the world's so-called hottest doctor who's repeatedly called
[3:41:41.520 --> 3:41:47.760]  for mandatory mask laws and social distancing this is a guy who they trotted out on cnn every other
[3:41:47.760 --> 3:41:52.640]  week to demand that you wear a mask to demand that you don't see your friends and relatives
[3:41:52.640 --> 3:41:58.240]  to demand that you follow all these arbitrary laws this was one of their main guys low and
[3:41:58.240 --> 3:42:06.480]  behold he's out in miami on his 31st birthday surrounded by bikini women performing no social
[3:42:06.480 --> 3:42:13.600]  distancing whatsoever micael vasharsky known as dr mike online completely contradicted his own
[3:42:13.600 --> 3:42:21.120]  advice by throwing a super spreader 31st birthday party for himself who was surrounded by 14 other
[3:42:21.120 --> 3:42:27.120]  people most of them women wearing bikinis another video shows the doctor massaging a woman's neck
[3:42:27.120 --> 3:42:31.680]  on the deck of the boat while wearing a facegoth isn't even covering his nose but he's going to
[3:42:31.680 --> 3:42:38.240]  tell you what to do he's going to tell you you can't hug your gran at thanksgiving this is a
[3:42:38.240 --> 3:42:44.160]  guy who tweeted quote if by not wearing a mask you put others lives at risk it might make sense to
[3:42:44.160 --> 3:42:50.080]  make it mandatory wouldn't you agree unless you're on a luxury boat having a birthday bash surrounded
[3:42:50.080 --> 3:42:57.120]  by scantily clad women apparently if you're dr mike then that makes it okay he also told fox
[3:42:57.120 --> 3:43:03.120]  business wearing a mask decreases the spread of the virus and that is of utmost importance for
[3:43:03.120 --> 3:43:09.120]  people's health so if you're going outside in public and are going to be around other people
[3:43:09.120 --> 3:43:17.920]  wear a mask apart from if you're dr mike on his luxury boat surrounded by his girls in bikinis
[3:43:17.920 --> 3:43:24.240]  then that apparently doesn't apply again this is cropped up time and time again we had polosi
[3:43:24.240 --> 3:43:31.360]  not wearing a mask when she was in the hairdressers we had other congresswomen inside congress not
[3:43:31.360 --> 3:43:39.120]  wearing masks we've got sam lucardo today the mayor of san josei having to issue a public apology
[3:43:40.400 --> 3:43:45.280]  he just tweeted this about an hour ago i apologize for my decision to gather for thanksgiving with
[3:43:45.280 --> 3:43:50.160]  my family contrary to the rules and again it's not just that these people break the rules and
[3:43:50.160 --> 3:43:54.960]  they're in positions of power it's that they endlessly lecture you about the rules and break
[3:43:54.960 --> 3:44:01.600]  them themselves you had the abc news correspondent constantly lecturing other reporters about not
[3:44:01.600 --> 3:44:07.360]  wearing masks pictures come out of him on synco de maya walking around new york everyone else is
[3:44:07.360 --> 3:44:14.640]  wearing a mask he's not wearing one the rules don't apply to them now sam lucardo the mayor of san
[3:44:14.640 --> 3:44:20.400]  josei has issued a groveling apology saying i understand my obligation as a public official
[3:44:20.400 --> 3:44:24.800]  to provide exemplary complaints with public health orders and not to ignore them and yet
[3:44:24.800 --> 3:44:32.400]  he did anyway because again he's not subject to the rules that he himself creates neither is
[3:44:32.400 --> 3:44:39.200]  apparently la supervisor sheila kuhl this is the bright bar headline dines at outdoor restaurant
