[00:00.000 --> 00:13.600]  This is an island that at its widest level is 12 miles from shore to shore and at its
[00:13.600 --> 00:30.600]  smallest level or smallest location it's seven miles between one shore and the other. Is that correct?
[00:30.600 --> 00:36.600]  I don't have the exact dimensions but to your point sir I think Guam is a small island.
[00:36.600 --> 00:49.600]  My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.
[00:56.600 --> 00:58.600]  I stand here as a freed slave.
[00:58.600 --> 01:10.600]  We've seen nothing that I can work with President Bush on and I'm disappointed because I thought that there might be some interest because of what he said in the campaign.
[01:10.600 --> 01:23.600]  What are we going to do? How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting, whether he's talking about the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims,
[01:23.600 --> 01:34.600]  or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin and knowing that they have hacked our DCCC and DNC
[01:34.600 --> 01:46.600]  and knowing that he's responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families.
[01:46.600 --> 01:48.600]  What is Aleppo?
[01:48.600 --> 01:58.600]  Yeah, in Aleppo. You are correct.
[01:58.600 --> 02:11.600]  The fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea.
[02:11.600 --> 02:18.600]  Stop it.
[02:18.600 --> 02:23.600]  I've decided we're ending all videos now with bong bong bing bong bong bong.
[02:23.600 --> 02:28.600]  I mean, think of it, could you have a better president if somebody liked Trump? It's so hilarious.
[02:28.600 --> 02:33.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we knew it was coming. The 9th Circuit is reversed. It's known as the 9th Circus.
[02:33.600 --> 02:40.600]  80 plus percent of the time but Buckley ran in here before the show and reminded me of something.
[02:40.600 --> 02:48.600]  That's right. It's the 9th Circuit that multiple times has overturned lawsuits and agreed with public schools,
[02:48.600 --> 02:54.600]  saying the American flag is offensive and cannot be worn on any clothing period.
[02:54.600 --> 02:59.600]  That's right. You can wear death metal shirts. You can wear Satanism shirts. You can wear Islamic shirts.
[02:59.600 --> 03:05.600]  You can wear Coca-Cola shirts. You can wear La Raza Mecha Mexican flag shirts,
[03:05.600 --> 03:10.600]  but you cannot wear the American flag according to the 9th Circuit.
[03:10.600 --> 03:16.600]  And boy, they're having victory laps on the news. You'd have thought that it was just the end for Trump.
[03:16.600 --> 03:21.600]  Of course, former prosecutors and others and judges are on record saying this is crazy.
[03:21.600 --> 03:24.600]  The law can be understood by a five-year-old.
[03:24.600 --> 03:31.600]  But the president had even wider discretion than just a temporary ban and other presidents have done basically the exact same thing.
[03:31.600 --> 03:37.600]  This is a huge judicial power grab and as soon as he gets his first Supreme Court nominee seated,
[03:37.600 --> 03:41.600]  he got five to four, it's going to go down, down, down.
[03:41.600 --> 03:45.600]  But the problem is, in the meantime, there's big stories on infohors.com.
[03:45.600 --> 03:50.600]  There is massive, unprecedented, never-before-seen in U.S. history.
[03:50.600 --> 03:54.600]  Revolt by the federal government. You want somebody to go clean house? He's trying.
[03:54.600 --> 03:59.600]  The State Department is trying to overthrow Lapin. She's in the lead.
[03:59.600 --> 04:02.600]  They're saying we're going to say the Russians are behind her.
[04:02.600 --> 04:09.600]  So our State Department is involved trying to stop the French getting their sovereignty back from the globalist EU project.
[04:09.600 --> 04:16.600]  And the State Department is now announced this morning, I got up at 6 a.m. and it's already been announced,
[04:16.600 --> 04:22.600]  that they're going to double the number of refugees that even Hillary was going to bring in if she got elected.
[04:22.600 --> 04:26.600]  So understand, they are ignoring Rex Tillerson. They're ignoring the president. They're ignoring the law.
[04:26.600 --> 04:30.600]  They're ignoring everything. They're just saying, the courts are now the president.
[04:30.600 --> 04:34.600]  The courts are now unelected, our new commanders-in-chief.
[04:34.600 --> 04:39.600]  In fact, the night circuit is now about the Supreme Court, the president and everybody.
[04:39.600 --> 04:44.600]  According to the traders, you already a thousand people quit at the State Department.
[04:44.600 --> 04:48.600]  How about the rest of you that signed these letters saying, you don't like Trump?
[04:48.600 --> 04:51.600]  How about that's a list who gets their asses thrown out of there?
[04:51.600 --> 04:56.600]  Good, let's purge all these arrogant, snot-nosed, globalist collaborating enemies.
[04:56.600 --> 05:23.600]  They are enemies.
[05:27.600 --> 05:33.600]  This is merely a psychological tactic forcing the carbon tax into your subconscious so they can eventually ram it home.
[05:33.600 --> 05:37.600]  The government will never pay you any money from a carbon tax. This plan is a red herring.
[05:37.600 --> 05:42.600]  Bloomberg published a piece praising the carbon tax plan, claiming it will save the world from climate change.
[05:42.600 --> 05:46.600]  Yes, the bureaucratic exchange of money will stop climate change. Give me a break.
[05:46.600 --> 05:52.600]  Really, this is a final attempt by the bought and paid for government to have say over who gets to make what and how much.
[05:52.600 --> 05:56.600]  This is essentially burying any free market competition in taxes and regulations.
[05:56.600 --> 06:23.600]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[06:26.600 --> 06:35.600]  This is an example of how you can promote the products and free shipping when you sign up for auto-ship and you're able to promote the products to friends and family and neighbors in your community and make money while helping people at the same time.

[07:00.600 --> 07:07.600]  This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off the grid products of 2017.
[07:07.600 --> 07:10.600]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[07:10.600 --> 07:16.600]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[07:16.600 --> 07:25.600]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator so you can keep food from spoiling.
[07:25.600 --> 07:30.600]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[07:30.600 --> 07:37.600]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid, literally anywhere in the world.
[07:37.600 --> 07:42.600]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, any time you need to get off the grid for a while.
[07:42.600 --> 07:47.600]  Go to privatepowergrid.com to watch this thing in action. That's privatepowergrid.com.

[08:16.600 --> 08:28.600]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[08:28.600 --> 08:37.600]  Here we are Friday, the 10th day of February 2017. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you so much for joining us.
[08:37.600 --> 08:47.600]  We're now, what, three weeks in since the inauguration and how time flies, and President Trump is devastating the globalist on every front.
[08:47.600 --> 08:57.600]  He is totally responsive to the American people, responsive to Matt Drudge within hours yesterday, just incredible.
[08:57.600 --> 09:01.600]  But for every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[09:01.600 --> 09:07.600]  When I say this, this is not rhetoric. Okay, this is what's happening. I've studied U.S. history.
[09:07.600 --> 09:15.600]  Everybody knows that I think Andrew Jackson is probably even more interesting than George Washington.
[09:15.600 --> 09:19.600]  If you understand the time the man lived in, he did some brutal things.
[09:19.600 --> 09:27.600]  But if you went and saw a Conan the Barbarian movie and somebody did the things that Jackson did in it, you'd say, that's ridiculous. That's impossible.
[09:27.600 --> 09:34.600]  It's like the Revenant. Go see the Revenant that's historically very, very accurate and amazing film by an amazing Mexican director.
[09:34.600 --> 09:45.600]  But the point is, Andrew Jackson lived things like that movie hundreds of times and survived when nobody else did.
[09:45.600 --> 09:50.600]  He was completely charmed. He had luck that no one could even deal with.
[09:50.600 --> 10:00.600]  When he was down there as a colonel battling the British in New Orleans, they had ships only a few hundred yards away with hundreds of men shooting at him in cannons for over a day.
[10:00.600 --> 10:08.600]  And he had to stand up on this big makeshift blockade they put on the road and they couldn't kill him.
[10:08.600 --> 10:14.600]  They were shooting people all around him and he stood there in a big black fur coat just scaring at him with his eyes in the night.
[10:14.600 --> 10:22.600]  It was like a specter completely broke their will. Nobody talks about Jackson. No movies are made about him.
[10:22.600 --> 10:34.600]  But notice in the White House, there is a bust of Jackson on a horse and then there's a big painting right behind Trump of Andrew Jackson.
[10:34.600 --> 10:41.600]  He's the guy that killed the early Federal Reserve they had then. He's the guy that survived more than 15 duels.
[10:41.600 --> 10:46.600]  I mean, it's so crazy the stuff Andrew Jackson did, it'll make your head spin.
[10:46.600 --> 10:51.600]  Let me tell you, George Washington's life was charmed and unbelievable as well.
[10:51.600 --> 11:00.600]  But I got to tell you, he's easily, easily dwarfed by Andrew Jackson with the sheer magic providence.
[11:00.600 --> 11:10.600]  And also toughness like he'd get stabbed in duels, shot in duels, bleed for three days, blood everywhere, threw his organs, wouldn't die,
[11:10.600 --> 11:20.600]  would refuse to die. It was crazy. By the time he was an old man, he would just like drink big containers of like arsenic and lead just to get up in the morning.
[11:20.600 --> 11:24.600]  I mean, that's what they did back then. He was wild.
[11:24.600 --> 11:32.600]  And somebody really should do a profile on Andrew Jackson because he was something else.
[11:32.600 --> 11:45.600]  And the fact that Trump's done his research and is modeling himself after Andrew Jackson sins horror into the guts and spines of the enemy.
[11:45.600 --> 11:48.600]  Because the United States would not be the United States without Jackson.
[11:48.600 --> 11:54.600]  British intelligence tried to get the South to secede, just like they did a few decades later, try to break the country up.
[11:54.600 --> 11:58.600]  Jackson knew about it as president, killed the plan because he was a Southerner.
[11:58.600 --> 12:10.600]  And I wish they would have listened to him. Of course, his protoge Sam Houston, president of Texas, and then the governor of Texas from the Civil War was about to start.
[12:10.600 --> 12:14.600]  Said this is a British intelligence setup. Do not do this. It's been to destroy us all.
[12:14.600 --> 12:21.600]  And of course, he was removed from office and ceremonially by all the young snot noses that knew everything and set up.
[12:21.600 --> 12:35.600]  So the fact that he's modeling himself after Andrew Jackson, who covertly sent in basically the special ops of the day to set up Texas when he was still president.
[12:35.600 --> 12:40.600]  It's amazing. See, see, I'm already going into a history lesson about Andrew Jackson. Excuse me.
[12:40.600 --> 12:46.600]  But let me now just just break down the big news here.
[12:46.600 --> 12:52.600]  For you, I have some phone calls coming in that I just cannot ignore. Yes. Hello.
[12:52.600 --> 13:01.600]  Hey. Hey, good. Listen, I'm on the air. I'm going to call you back. Okay. Thanks. It's all right.
[13:01.600 --> 13:16.600]  You can't ignore those calls at DC in New York. Excuse me. Now, getting back to what I was saying here.
[13:16.600 --> 13:22.600]  If George Washington was America's first founder, the second founder was Andrew Jackson.
[13:22.600 --> 13:27.600]  And I'm telling you in the relaunch of America, Trump intended to be number three.
[13:27.600 --> 13:31.600]  And I guess they say good things come in three, the trifecta.
[13:31.600 --> 13:36.600]  And he has the trifecta of the legislative, the executive and the judicial right now.
[13:36.600 --> 13:41.600]  The problem is the judiciary is completely and totally out of control.
[13:41.600 --> 13:48.600]  The ninth circuit known as the circus is reversed over 80% of the time.
[13:48.600 --> 13:54.600]  You'll see the number of 80%, but I went and looked it up. It's reversed currently about 83% of the time. It varies.
[13:54.600 --> 14:03.600]  They're the ones that banned wearing American flags in public schools in California and said that they ruled that it was an offensive bad symbol.
[14:03.600 --> 14:09.600]  But you can wear a Mexican flag or a motocross symbol or rock and roll.
[14:09.600 --> 14:16.600]  But the flag triggers people on the mental institutions that masquerade as public schools.
[14:16.600 --> 14:23.600]  So that's who's doing this and he'll beat them at the Supreme Court.
[14:23.600 --> 14:27.600]  And of course, the news is pointing out that Lincoln didn't just criticize judges.
[14:27.600 --> 14:31.600]  Lincoln had judges arrested in mass as I pointed out a few days ago.
[14:31.600 --> 14:44.600]  So this claim that Trump mildly criticizing them, they need to be criticized when the law on what the president can do with aliens who are from outside the country is absolutely crystal.
[14:44.600 --> 14:58.600]  And every other major country has the same type of laws on the books from Mexico to Russia, from Japan to Chile, from the Dominican Republic to the UK.
[14:58.600 --> 15:12.600]  It's the same thing. I have flown in on a plane to England and seen another known journalist activist young lady with no criminal record who was flying there as a Canadian citizen to do a report.
[15:12.600 --> 15:17.600]  And they just said, we don't want activists here. We're not letting you in. They let me in.
[15:17.600 --> 15:23.600]  But I watched them. She got off another plane. We're going through customs at the same time a few years ago.
[15:23.600 --> 15:27.600]  Leanne McAdoo was there. I forget her name. It may be McAdoo. She's here to run and remind me.
[15:27.600 --> 15:31.600]  And there was that young activist. And they just said, no, we're not letting you in.
[15:31.600 --> 15:39.600]  Well, you know, that's their prerogative. Even though Canada's supposedly part of the Commonwealth, they just didn't let her in.
[15:39.600 --> 15:44.600]  But they sit there and howl and scream and act like some great crime has been committed by Trump.
[15:44.600 --> 16:00.600]  So the same court that says the American flag is offensive has now come out and said that basically judges can circumvent Congress and the president and our borders and national sovereignty.
[16:00.600 --> 16:12.600]  And the fact that since this country was founded 244 years ago, that the president would execute the congressional laws dealing with our border and our military.
[16:12.600 --> 16:17.600]  That has all been overthrown according to the night circuit. And they are now the commander in chief.
[16:17.600 --> 16:28.600]  Now, I said this last night in videos we shot live that they are involved in an attempt to overthrow the Constitution and declared themselves above the president or commander in chief.
[16:28.600 --> 16:32.600]  Breitbart has an article today saying just that. That's what this is.
[16:32.600 --> 16:43.600]  The night circuit out in Sanford Fran, who says the American flag should not be seen in public. You shouldn't be able to wear it because it's offensive at public schools, but everybody else can wear whatever they want.
[16:43.600 --> 16:51.600]  They're saying openly that they are now over the visa process and laws of this country and can veto any of them.
[16:51.600 --> 16:59.600]  Truly unprecedented and shows you what these activists, court judges, and you look at the three judges that ruled they look like total fruit loops.
[16:59.600 --> 17:04.600]  I mean, look at them, but their rulings are even more fruit loop.
[17:04.600 --> 17:12.600]  Globalist rebellion appeals court rules against Trump overturns Constitution.
[17:12.600 --> 17:24.600]  The night circuit has 80% reversal rate at Supreme Court. State Department, here's the big news. State Department doubles refugee inflow since court ruling.
[17:24.600 --> 17:36.600]  Most from terror prone countries. One out of every 1,100 refugees admitted 346 come from Syria while 232 originate from Iraq.
[17:36.600 --> 17:45.600]  And here's the big news. The State Department is announcing they're going to work to beat LePen, who's in the lead, another nationalist.
[17:45.600 --> 17:57.600]  Now, this is Trump's supposed State Department is working against other Trump type and Brexit type candidates in the total Soros agenda.
[17:57.600 --> 18:09.600]  So that shows how Trump is completely surrounded in all these agencies with sickening traders. And it's still battling to try to get this agenda through.
[18:09.600 --> 18:15.600]  State Department doubles refugee inflow since the ruling yesterday evening.
[18:15.600 --> 18:24.600]  Why not? State Department and the courts are God. Forget the president. You've got bureaucrats and you've got the night circuit and they say what happens in CNN and MSNBC.
[18:24.600 --> 18:35.600]  They're all acting like this is completely normal and Twitter and Facebook and Apple and Microsoft as well as Amazon are all celebrating this.
[18:35.600 --> 18:42.600]  This is a time to battle racism. That's right. National sovereignty and the American flag is now racism.
[18:42.600 --> 18:55.600]  State Department revolt against Trump for securing border Clinton cronies at state double the inflow of Muslim migrants after the night circuit ruling.
[18:55.600 --> 19:03.600]  That's up on info wars.com by Dr. Jerome Corsi and they went further and said and we will beat LePen.
[19:03.600 --> 19:17.600]  They said we're going to skip this break. We're going to promote. Listen to this carefully. We're going to promote the Russia hack narrative.
[19:17.600 --> 19:32.600]  They're so arrogant that they don't even admit that it's real or act like it's real, push that narrative. They just say, oh, we admit it's not true, but we're just going to push that the Russians are going to steal the election in France.
[19:32.600 --> 19:37.600]  I gotta tell you folks, the Russians are all powerful. Here's a clip of that.
[19:37.600 --> 19:46.600]  Tonight, new concerns that Vladimir Putin's notorious hacking teams could be trying to influence another election targeting a key U.S. ally.
[19:46.600 --> 19:56.600]  A French official tells CNN the French government is concerned about Russian involvement in their upcoming presidential elections and they're monitoring for possible cyber attacks.
[19:56.600 --> 20:06.600]  CNN has learned French officials are worried that Putin's hackers will fish for damaging information using similar tactics to how they targeted Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.
[20:06.600 --> 20:27.600]  So number one, they never proved Russia hacked anything here. They called them being on Russian TV supporting Trump some that that was the influence. What about the Saudi Arabians? What about the Communist Chinese? What about the EU? What about Hollywood? What about the whole power structure in Katy Perry and the kitchen sink against Trump and the bitter clingers, the American people and the deplorables?
[20:27.600 --> 20:36.600]  But see, no, no, it's the Russians. So now, if anything ever comes out corrupt about officials here in America or in Russia or anywhere else, the Russians did it.
[20:36.600 --> 20:42.600]  If corruption comes out in Japan or Mexico, the Russians did it. If your wife catches you cheating on her, the Russians did it.
[20:42.600 --> 20:51.600]  You know that Brady and others didn't win the Super Bowl Sunday. You know that there's a meme out there that the Russians did it.
[20:51.600 --> 21:01.600]  And it's white supremacy. I'm not joking. It's white supremacy because there were a few white players on the New England Patriots, and that's not right.
[21:01.600 --> 21:11.600]  We pull up some of those memes maybe where they just just type in memes. Russians made the Patriots win. Folks, the Russians didn't make the Patriots win.
[21:11.600 --> 21:22.600]  The islands don't float. The Russians didn't attack Korea. Bush isn't still in office. These are all real things that current members of Congress believe.
[21:22.600 --> 21:31.600]  What type of drugs are they on? We don't know. What's wrong with Nancy Pelosi? She looks like an ostrich on PCP. What's wrong with Maxine Waters?
[21:31.600 --> 21:41.600]  She looks like she's on another planet. But the Russians did it. The Russians did it. Let's finish up the, oh my gosh, the French might want sovereignty.
[21:41.600 --> 21:49.600]  The French might not want to be part of the unelected EU they never voted to be part of. The Russians pulled out of globalism as well 18, 19 years ago.
[21:49.600 --> 22:01.600]  So the only truth that the Russians did it is the Russians started doing it first after they enjoyed 85 years of New World Order social engineering, robber baron, proto-globalism.
[22:01.600 --> 22:12.600]  And thank God they've partly struggled free from it. Are there still big globalist combines in Russia still tentacling back trying to take control of the US? Absolutely.
[22:12.600 --> 22:22.600]  Just like there's globalist tentacles inside the State Department trying to defeat Le Pen. I mean, look at this guy. The French brace for possible election cyber attacks from Russia.
[22:22.600 --> 22:33.600]  How about the French brace under EU and Islamic invasion? And a bunch of fifth column collaborators shelling out their country where it's so dangerous.
[22:33.600 --> 22:46.600]  I was reading their tourism's down by like 80% the last three years. It's a hellhole. Islamic jihad people running around who've like mutated and mixed into the whole gangster culture. It's a joke.
[22:46.600 --> 22:48.600]  Let's go back to the ridiculous piece.
[22:48.600 --> 22:52.600]  It's an account of many of these, of many of the leading politicians.
[22:52.600 --> 22:54.600]  Oh my God, rewind this.
[22:54.600 --> 23:05.600]  If you're a radio listener, there's this thing trendies do where they basically wear costumes and they festoon themselves and they dress weird and they want to look strange.
[23:05.600 --> 23:16.600]  I mean, this guy looks like what cartoon character does he look like? Like the character that's in Monopoly or metastopheles who's wearing a black top hat.
[23:16.600 --> 23:25.600]  He needs a monocle or is he in the German high command? But this is what trendies do. They go, how do we convince them? They don't trust us anymore. We've tried info babes.
[23:25.600 --> 23:31.600]  Roll out trendies to sound real pseudo intellectual here. Don't interrupt him. Rewind it.
[23:31.600 --> 23:34.600]  I mean, I want to hear everything this guy has to say.
[23:34.600 --> 23:40.600]  So again, folks, the Russians are the reason the Patriots won and white supremacy.
[23:40.600 --> 23:48.600]  Because it's like homophobe, white supremacist, Russian agent. And you can mix it. Russian agent, homophobe, KKK.
[23:48.600 --> 23:56.600]  You can interchange those, but always, though, the same things in different orders. This is the great intellectual gravitas we're dealing with.
[23:56.600 --> 24:02.600]  So let's go back to a guy in a costume. Okay, here he is.
[24:02.600 --> 24:11.600]  This is a personal account of many of these, of many of the leading politicians, and also that of their spouses, their friends, their lovers.
[24:11.600 --> 24:15.600]  I would think all of those would be very rich targets for people that were brought up in the KGB.
[24:15.600 --> 24:27.600]  Okay, let's hit pause. Let's rewind it again. This is what the CIA is filled with. There's all these foppish, effeminate, weak little nobodies that want to just get off on the secrecy
[24:27.600 --> 24:34.600]  and break into your files and, you know, be over you in the new Uber, Uber class, the Uber mention.
[24:34.600 --> 24:46.600]  But then, meanwhile, everyone hates them. And so they just roll out these twits, the villains out of central casting, to act like the Russians are the only people to ever get involved in elections.
[24:46.600 --> 24:56.600]  And they're the only ones to ever use sex operatives. And again, if anybody breaks into anybody's computers and there's criminal activity going on, it's not the fault of the criminal or the pedophiles.
[24:56.600 --> 25:04.600]  I know that's in the WikiLeaks. No, no, no. It's the fault of the Russians, even though it's U.S. intelligence that leaked almost all of it, and more is getting ready to come out.
[25:04.600 --> 25:14.600]  So don't worry, my little twit friend. A lot more is going to be coming out. So let's, who is this guy even? I mean, this guy is unbelievable.
[25:14.600 --> 25:23.600]  Look at that outfit. Oh my, and look at the eyes. Look at the arrogance. That guy thinks he is so smart, man.
[25:23.600 --> 25:31.600]  You know women run from him. This is a loser. Just, oh my gosh. Let's continue. Here we go.
[25:31.600 --> 25:40.600]  Personal account of many of these, of many of the leading politicians, and also that of their spouses, their friends, their lovers.
[25:40.600 --> 25:45.600]  I would think all of those would be very rich targets for people that were brought up in the KGB system.
[25:45.600 --> 25:57.600]  I wonder, does that guy drive like a white van? It kind of fits with the outfit, don't you think? And then kind of like a onesie jumpsuit or something?
[25:57.600 --> 26:06.600]  Oh yeah, around the house, that's what he's wearing. I wonder if he has little animals, little pets and cages or anything.
[26:06.600 --> 26:15.600]  We're watching you, buddy. The people. Let's continue with the report here it is.
[26:15.600 --> 26:23.600]  One French official worries, Russian hackers will send out fabricated news reports or social media postings that might influence voters' minds.
[26:23.600 --> 26:36.600]  Like George Soros admittedly spent hundreds of millions the last election flooding social media, having Facebook, Twitter, Google, everybody censor us when we just personally try to say something or do something.
[26:36.600 --> 26:45.600]  If it goes viral, you block it. Like you've been doing to us, the whole world ganging up on the American people and we still kicked your ass and now you're scared the French might get loose from you.
[26:45.600 --> 26:48.600]  So blame it on the all powerful Russians.
[26:48.600 --> 26:58.600]  Asked if France was safe from cyber attacks similar to those in America, France's defense minister recently said, no, of course, one must not be naive.
[26:58.600 --> 27:08.600]  No, we're the socialist globalist, most of us leftovers from the old Soviet Union when it collapsed in Eastern Europe and we're setting up a similar system and our own leaked documents admit we're setting up a new Soviet.
[27:08.600 --> 27:20.600]  And so people in America and Russia with nothing to do with it. And so, no, we're not safe. And so if we do lose, it's the Russians. That's the reason Le Pen so popular, not that her dad was so popular, not that he had other elections stolen from him.
[27:20.600 --> 27:28.600]  No, no, no, everyone loves the millions of Islamists we brought in. Here, here. Oh, no, of course not. Oh, no, no. Here, continue.
[27:28.600 --> 27:38.600]  And in recent weeks, US intelligence officials warned that Putin's government has tried to influence elections across Europe. Russian hackers are believed to have targeted France before.
[27:38.600 --> 27:51.600]  In 2015, a powerful cyber attack almost destroyed a top French TV network to pause again. Oh, powerful. The powerful cyber attack. The Russians are so powerful.
[27:51.600 --> 28:00.600]  On behalf of their infrastructures collapsed. That's why we're at much of Russia is rotting their population is imploding and Putin's just trying to stabilize Russia.
[28:00.600 --> 28:12.600]  And so again, Russia is the big bad guy. Let's go back to Mr. Peanut or whatever this guy is. Mr. Creepy. I mean, let's name this guy. We didn't we did a meme out of this guy. Who is this guy?
[28:12.600 --> 28:28.600]  Jason Healy. Cyber security expert Columbia University. I bet you money that Mr. Creepy is a creep. Look at that guy. Look at how smart he thinks he is.
[28:28.600 --> 28:37.600]  I mean, this is a joke. You send your kids to the mental institutions they call public schools to learn at the feet of this guy. Here, here, here. Let's play the rest.
[28:37.600 --> 28:42.600]  And they disrupted TV Mon's television broadcast. They hacked the Twitter.
[28:42.600 --> 28:48.600]  Listen to the arrogance as he has these little scripted lines he practices all day.
[28:48.600 --> 28:54.600]  As he goes in and sits down at CNN with almost no viewers and then just tries to talk with total confidence.
[28:54.600 --> 29:08.600]  They disrupted the Mon's with this precision deadly attack. But we are onto them now. Anytime corruption comes out, don't look at the corruption. It's the Russians. And the Russians run everything.
[29:08.600 --> 29:13.600]  Do you see my little 18th century beard? Let's continue.
[29:13.600 --> 29:27.600]  It got into emails. They did all sorts of things to really disrupt this TV news station.
[29:27.600 --> 29:39.600]  Marine Le Pen is one of the Kremlin's favorite politicians. Why? Because Le Pen wants to break Euro-Atlantic institutions. Le Pen wants to bring...
[29:39.600 --> 29:49.600]  Alright, we're gonna go to break. Guys, the globalists have taken over. They're enslaving us all. Of course, Russia, a sovereign nation wants it to be defeated. We should all be praying for it like Donald Trump is.
[29:49.600 --> 29:52.600]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:52.600 --> 29:59.600]  Hear that? The Empire, the globalist, unelected, anti-family, devil empire is burning.
[29:59.600 --> 30:21.600]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense probiotic. We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[31:00.600 --> 31:21.600]  Hi there, Dick Holgeier here. I was a mainstream television news reporter for over three decades. I normally never do commercial endorsements. I am very skeptical of health supplements, but a friend of mine told me about his experience with Synergy One, so I purchased a bottle and my wife and I have been using it for a few weeks now.
[31:21.600 --> 31:41.600]  I very much dislike so-called energy boosters, those little energy drinks that have caffeine and Guarana and other things that make your heart race. This is not that. My experience with Synergy One has been great. My mood is better, my joints feel better, I have more vigor, more stamina, way increased productivity.
[31:41.600 --> 31:51.600]  My wife and I both noticed that we even dream more, so I recommend Synergy One. It's really good stuff. I'm having great results with it.
[32:11.600 --> 32:17.600]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[32:41.600 --> 32:58.600]  Big Berkey, the one powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water. Get your Big Berkey today. Call 1-877-99 Berkey or click bigberkeywaterfilters.com. That's 1-877-99 BERKEY. Big Berkey Water Filters for the love of clean water.
[33:12.600 --> 33:23.600]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[33:23.600 --> 33:39.600]  In the streets, the darks are on the run, cats are all in heat. In the streets, the leagues are on the run.
[33:53.600 --> 34:02.600]  Here it is, Associated Press saying that the president can't execute faithfully the law that says he can ban people entirely from countries.
[34:02.600 --> 34:12.600]  Not just do it while they're trying to get a vetting process in place. Then the media lies and says, oh, we already do extreme vetting. No, you have a bunch of fake passports, fake visas, everybody knows that.
[34:12.600 --> 34:23.600]  And I have a big stack of news on that front. But we now have the State Department all over. I mean, while I was playing that clip, I walked out during the break into the control room.
[34:23.600 --> 34:41.600]  Fox News was on, running the exact same style story saying, oh my gosh, the State Department's going to have to battle Russians now in France and in Germany because all over Europe, nations want out of the Euro because they're Russian agents.
[34:41.600 --> 34:49.600]  No, ladies and gentlemen, Maria Le Pen is a right-wing anti-communist, nothing to do with old Russian communism or Russia.
[34:49.600 --> 34:56.600]  The Euro was a, quote, trade deal that was really a stealth political takeover and the people now know it's true.
[34:56.600 --> 35:09.600]  So as they have election after election in Germany, pulling out of that globalist model, because the Germans are tired of paying for globalism and tired of the open borders, they're saying that that's Russian agents too.
[35:09.600 --> 35:21.600]  Again, the Russians did not make the Patriots win, the Patriots won. Again, the Russians did not invade Korea, Maxine Waters. Again, Nancy Pelosi at the same press conference.
[35:21.600 --> 35:26.600]  George W. Bush has not been in office in over eight years, sweetheart.
[35:26.600 --> 35:42.600]  So you look at how dumb the elite are, that's why they're shoveling this propaganda, but then you look at CNN, its average show, 100,000 viewers. Do you understand that in the last seven days, Paul Watson has had 18 million plus views just on YouTube and Facebook?
[35:42.600 --> 35:54.600]  18 million views. This show, over 50 million, 60 million views last week or more, was upwards of 80 or 90 if you add Joe Rogan's podcast.
[35:54.600 --> 36:01.600]  That's people tuning into what I had to say for almost four hours.
[36:01.600 --> 36:13.600]  These people are all legends in their own minds. I don't tell you all these big numbers to make you feel powerful and me feel powerful. It's that they're that big a joke.
[36:13.600 --> 36:27.600]  The Super Bowl doesn't have the amount of viewers that we had election week and that's real verified numbers. That's not reach. That's not how people could see our video because Facebook calls it reach.
[36:27.600 --> 36:37.600]  It says, oh, you've had 2 million reach in the last quarter. That just means people saw pages that had links or images of your stuff.
[36:37.600 --> 36:54.600]  You know, watched, listened, consumed our information, 85 million. 50 plus million last week. You had Joe Rogan's podcast. That's now about 40 million.
[36:54.600 --> 37:06.600]  What are they going to do? They're going to try to say we're all Russians, folks. It's amazing, but it's not working. But here's the paradox and here's the key.
[37:06.600 --> 37:25.600]  This is Donald Trump State Department on the news still saying Russians stole the election for Trump and openly criticizing Trump trying to defend our borders and openly siding with the Ninth Circuit in sedition against this country and the American people in our security.
[37:25.600 --> 37:37.600]  Now, you put that in your pipe and smoke that and just let that sink in for a little bit because it's serious. But let's finish up with a CNN clip where, again, they're saying, oh, and it's not just France, you see.
[37:37.600 --> 37:44.600]  Oh, now they're trying to say the Russians might be involved in Brazil because they have a nationalist movement.
[37:44.600 --> 37:55.600]  You see, we got no immediate response from the Kremlin to the concerns over Russian hacking of the French elections. But Vladimir Putin has, of course, consistently denied ordering the hacks that targeted Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[37:55.600 --> 38:09.600]  Analyst caution, France is not the only US ally which could be in the crosshairs of those Russian hackers. They say Germany and the Netherlands could also be targeted in their elections coming up this year.
[38:09.600 --> 38:29.600]  Did you hear that? So if corruption comes out, I mean, the French, the entire Socialist Party, most of their leadership has been caught. It was in the papers the last few years, not paying federal taxes and putting it in Swiss bank accounts or Luxembourg bank accounts or Bahamas bank accounts.
[38:29.600 --> 38:46.600]  And they've caught the EU bureaucracy. I say catch. They passed laws where they don't pay the EU tax. I'm going to say that again. The bureaucrats exempt themselves from the EU tax in a law.
[38:46.600 --> 38:58.600]  And then, meanwhile, the leftists are indicting people that are more right wing like Nicholas Sarkozy, who's been indicted multiple times and continues to be found not guilty, but they don't care. They just re-indicted him. And I'm not defending Sarkozy. He's a warmonger.
[38:58.600 --> 39:07.600]  But Nicholas Sarkozy's trial is no surprise. Fraud is how French conservative politicians seem to earn their money.
[39:07.600 --> 39:23.600]  That's how these bureaucrats operate. France, for four years, has a 101% tax rate on the poor, the middle class, and the rich. You say, how do you pay 100% tax? You're not meant to. If you're not in the inside party, you get indicted.
[39:23.600 --> 39:32.600]  Taxes can be used to destroy people. The power to tax is the power to destroy. And selective taxation is a form of siege.
[39:32.600 --> 39:46.600]  Now, let me give you these headlines and get to more of these key clips. Globalist rebellion appeals court rules against Trump, and Trump must clean house now and make a big issue about what's happening in the State Department.
[39:46.600 --> 40:01.600]  They are openly trying to say the Russians run the president. This is the president's State Department under the executive. This is his employees in open, lying revolt with a bunch of offshore globalists trying to overthrow the country.
[40:01.600 --> 40:12.600]  The State Department revolt against Trump for securing the border. The U.S. State Department begins efforts to undermine French election and utilize the vast Russian conspiracy close quote.
[40:12.600 --> 40:25.600]  The first, it used to be a vast right-wing conspiracy, but now it's a vast Russian conspiracy. And they go, look, Alex goes on Russian TV and has had some top Russians on. Yeah, just like CNN does. I'm talking to people.
[40:25.600 --> 40:36.600]  Judge declares, judges can grant immigration visas even when elected president disagrees and are now more powerful than the president and are now the executive branch.
[40:36.600 --> 40:48.600]  The judges are now declaring that they are the commander in chief. It's called a judicial coup. Amazon takes victory lap for its role in halting Trump travel ban.
[40:48.600 --> 40:58.600]  Whole world ganging up together to defeat the American people. Facebook joins Google to attack Trump on border security.
[40:58.600 --> 41:14.600]  Assad says some refugees are definitely terrorists. Yeah, no kidding. University of Central Florida campus. Progressive start. Leftist fight club to learn how to viciously attack from behind with lead pipes even.
[41:14.600 --> 41:30.600]  People that disagree with Duke University training students in anti Trump activism, but be careful because I saw them engage in racketeering and assaulting people in DC and over 100 plus have been indicted for rioting.
[41:30.600 --> 41:45.600]  Continuing, Katy Perry song encourages anti Trump riots. Big corporate Hollywood mega banks want to take out our president with the communist Chinese, the Saudi Arabians, the EU, the bureaucrats, the big banks, everything.
[41:45.600 --> 41:53.600]  Everybody hates Trump, but the American people, everybody hates Le Pen, everybody hates Nigel Farage, but the people of England.
[41:53.600 --> 42:04.600]  It's nation states desperately simply trying to get their countries back from a global private corporate system, and they are freaking out as we wake up saying we don't care of Trump selected.
[42:04.600 --> 42:14.600]  We don't care. We're going to say he's a Russian agent, his own State Department, and we're going to try to stop Le Pen, just like they overthrew the elected government of Ukraine.
[42:14.600 --> 42:32.600]  The same State Department is announcing that it is an open revolt against the Constitution, against the Bill of Rights, against the Declaration of Independence, against the President, against the Congress, against the rule of law, against the American people, against our security, against our sovereignty.
[42:32.600 --> 42:48.600]  Donald Trump could have them all arrested, just like Lincoln did. Lincoln had members of the State Department arrested, Lincoln had judges arrested, and hundreds of newspaper editors arrested, because they were in open sedition calling for the overthrow of the republic.
[42:48.600 --> 42:56.600]  Now, did he go too far? Absolutely. Was the North and South played off against each other? Absolutely. Did my entire ancestral background fight in the South? You bet they did.
[42:56.600 --> 43:07.600]  The point is, is that he did all that one million light years more than what Trump's done, and hey, Trump's a big old Yankee, just like the guy from Illinois was.
[43:07.600 --> 43:17.600]  So everybody just better get ready, because I'm going to back this Yankee in the attack on our republic, in the attempt to completely overthrow this country, and make no mistake.
[43:17.600 --> 43:35.600]  Those aren't words. I have read 100 history books on Andrew Jackson. I've read probably 15 on Thomas Jefferson, 20 or so on Washington, probably six or seven on Lincoln.
[43:35.600 --> 43:48.600]  Probably read 20 books on the Civil War, watched tons of documentaries on PBS. I mean, I studied it. I could go into a college with a professor that teaches the Civil War and stand my own with him.
[43:48.600 --> 43:57.600]  I know what I'm talking about. I'm not some pseudo-intellectual here. I'm not bragging either, but I've done my homework, because it's so interesting.
[43:57.600 --> 44:05.600]  Donald Trump could have the people in the State Department who openly worked with Soros in the last few years to overthrow countries, and they're not trying to do it here.
[44:05.600 --> 44:15.600]  He could have them arrested right now. He could send the Marines in right now to put them in irons and drag them before juries and grand juries for sedition.
[44:15.600 --> 44:20.600]  We think sedition is working with like the Chinese, even though they are working with the globalists or the Russians.
[44:20.600 --> 44:38.600]  They say, we're doing this because they want to shut our speech down, claiming it's sedition. When they're the ones involved in open sedition and big news coming, big news coming soon on who the leakers are in the White House.
[44:38.600 --> 44:46.600]  On Monday, we're putting together investigative reports. On Monday, we're going to tell you who the leakers are.
[44:46.600 --> 44:56.600]  There is a coup at every level against President Trump. That's why he's racing to cut your taxes, racing to stabilize the economy, racing to trump up the economy.
[44:56.600 --> 45:08.600]  A Trump bubble, which he admits is a bubble, but man, we're trying to blast off as stuff is melting down. We're trying to get off Krypton here, folks, as it is going down the proverbial molten drain.
[45:08.600 --> 45:19.600]  So Katy Perry wants you to go out and riot and attack, but watch out 146 anti-Trump protesters facing felony rioting charges from Inauguration Day.
[45:19.600 --> 45:30.600]  And I say beating up women and children. Absolutely. They're being indicted with felonies. That's day one of the new Attorney General.
[45:30.600 --> 45:39.600]  To beat women over the head and stuff in a mass criminal action, you're going to get indicted. And then they're going to find out about your Soros funding and start rolling up through the chain.
[45:39.600 --> 45:48.600]  Oh, and pedophiles. Pedophiles. Let me give you a little news flash. Trump's coming for you and your bosses. I know you're fighting for your lives now.
[45:48.600 --> 45:56.600]  You're openly in sedition. I know. We're just going to sit back and let you get enough rope to hell, hang yourselves.
[45:56.600 --> 46:02.600]  Okay, so just get ready because national sovereignty is exploding worldwide.
[46:02.600 --> 46:11.600]  Senate confirms new Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who's a doctor, and actually has some sensible ideas on how to repeal Obamacare.
[46:11.600 --> 46:17.600]  How you like that? Pat Buchanan writes for World that Daily, Trump must break judicial power. Absolutely.
[46:17.600 --> 46:24.600]  State Department whistleblower, refugee program, full of fraud, infowars.com. Dan Lyman.
[46:24.600 --> 46:31.600]  New era of justice. AG Sessions vows to tackle cartels. Illegal immigration because that's what a sovereign country does.
[46:31.600 --> 46:42.600]  It's big league time. Trump promises a phenomenal tax cut plan for businesses in coming weeks as stocks notch record close in anticipation.
[46:42.600 --> 46:48.600]  GOP frets over too high expectations, though.
[46:48.600 --> 46:55.600]  Now, I've got Paul Joseph Watson's incredibly important report that is the key to victory that I want to hear.
[46:55.600 --> 47:01.600]  I've got loaded guests here, but I may have to cancel some guests because Trump has a press conference coming up in about 15 minutes.
[47:01.600 --> 47:06.600]  He's always a little bit late, but we'll be carrying that bottom line. We'll be playing excerpts of it regardless.
[47:06.600 --> 47:14.600]  I do have a lot of guests today, but Niko's done a great job getting all the guests I wanted, but Brackham pops in a lot.
[47:14.600 --> 47:24.600]  It's right shotgun during the press conference. Rappaport has really found the keys to the kingdom documenting the actual plan to turn colleges into giant mental illness factories
[47:24.600 --> 47:32.600]  to make you mentally ill, gibbering idiots so you don't know you were sold worthless degrees and to prepare you for assimilation into the corporate Borg system
[47:32.600 --> 47:37.600]  and to make sure you hate families so you automatically self-censor and don't have kids.
[47:37.600 --> 47:47.600]  So it's basically a death cult brainwashing, soul-sucking system. Not attacking you that have degrees. Everybody knows 90% of the degrees are worthless
[47:47.600 --> 47:56.600]  or actually are negative value. You have to pay for the toilet paper. And it's a metaphysical toilet paper, so you can't even wipe your end with it.
[47:56.600 --> 48:00.600]  Rappaport's got a big report on that. He broke down yesterday that hour. I listened to that hour last night.
[48:00.600 --> 48:07.600]  It was just his voice and just his focus and his understanding and his gravitas.
[48:07.600 --> 48:16.600]  John Rappaport deserves to be a superstar. He's popular. He's a great writer, great researcher, investigative journalist, but he just is a piece of work.
[48:16.600 --> 48:25.600]  John Rappaport, I want to get more board ops, more people, more folks to run shows and keep working with GCN.
[48:25.600 --> 48:31.600]  I'm not competition with GCN. I love Ted and love GCN, but more people like Rappaport need daily shows.
[48:31.600 --> 48:40.600]  The problem is talk radio is geared to three-hour shows. Rappaport probably couldn't do that or doesn't want to do that, but it's just so good.
[48:40.600 --> 48:49.600]  He's so informed because when you're really researched like I am, you hear somebody that's researched as well and they just so lovingly lay it all out.
[48:49.600 --> 48:57.600]  It's just soothing to be freed from the bondage. With me, it's more like a desperate barking dog trying to warn people about the enemy breaking in the house.
[48:57.600 --> 49:04.600]  But with Rappaport, it's just like, here, let's remove that mind control. Let's just take all that away.
[49:04.600 --> 49:10.600]  I was very upset yesterday about the New World Order and I was listening to him driving to a company meeting last night and then driving home.
[49:10.600 --> 49:18.600]  I listened to the whole hour and I got in bed last night with a phone and I was listening to it and I went to sleep listening to Rappaport.
[49:18.600 --> 49:23.600]  And no, I don't have a crush on Rappaport before those memes start.
[49:23.600 --> 49:28.600]  I love memes that attack me. They're so funny. I actually encourage people to do it.
[49:28.600 --> 49:36.600]  The point is that that's why the memeosphere loves me because we like to have fun.
[49:36.600 --> 49:39.600]  But Rappaport's awesome. He's going to be joining us.
[49:39.600 --> 49:46.600]  Another awesome guy who was doing all the cool 18th century, 19th century facial hair before everybody else was doing it.
[49:46.600 --> 49:50.600]  It's a founder device, but he has the face to pull it off, so it looks good on him.
[49:50.600 --> 49:52.600]  Not on the Count Dracula guy we showed earlier.
[49:52.600 --> 49:59.600]  Gavin McGinnis is going to be joining us. He's been getting physically attacked by these people and fighting back all over the country so they're actually panicking.
[49:59.600 --> 50:01.600]  So that's all coming up.
[50:01.600 --> 50:04.600]  I'm going to go to this break, though, and we come back.
[50:04.600 --> 50:11.600]  I've got a bunch of clips I haven't gotten to yet that deal with CNN compares Islamic terror to lightning.
[50:11.600 --> 50:16.600]  Meanwhile, the FBI says it cannot vet Syrian refugees, though our media says they're all vetted, just total lie.
[50:16.600 --> 50:18.600]  Whistleblower reveals passport fraud.
[50:18.600 --> 50:22.600]  Trump on border wall says he wasn't kidding. That's coming up.
[50:22.600 --> 50:25.600]  Then I've got Paul's report.
[50:25.600 --> 50:27.600]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[50:27.600 --> 50:28.600]  Why is that important?
[50:28.600 --> 50:33.600]  The left is all about how they're cool, their anti-establishment, when they're the ultimate establishment.
[50:33.600 --> 50:35.600]  Trump is the ultimate outsider.
[50:35.600 --> 50:42.600]  The big golden bull in the China cabinet wrecking their dreams, now becoming nightmares.
[50:42.600 --> 50:44.600]  Their nightmares are our dreams.
[50:44.600 --> 50:49.600]  And so it's a very powerful piece Paul did.
[50:49.600 --> 50:53.600]  It's only going to get like 3 million views, I think, which is terrible because it's one of his more important videos.
[50:53.600 --> 50:57.600]  It should get 20 million like his other ones, but you know, we'll still take 3 million.
[50:57.600 --> 50:59.600]  I mean, come on.
[50:59.600 --> 51:06.600]  Many books have been written regarding the law of attraction, but what if all these books are missing the most important information we can use
[51:06.600 --> 51:09.600]  when it comes to activating this law in our lives?
[51:09.600 --> 51:14.600]  The new book, It's Time to Align, the most powerful self-help book ever written by Alan Laudinger,
[51:14.600 --> 51:19.600]  takes a look at how the law of attraction really works and how it is being suppressed in our lives.
[51:19.600 --> 51:25.600]  Learn how to overcome this manipulation and how to experience alignment with the creative power of the universe.
[51:25.600 --> 51:29.600]  Get the new book, It's Time to Align, available at Amazon.com
[51:55.600 --> 51:59.600]  Just won't quit.
[52:26.600 --> 52:32.600]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is
[52:32.600 --> 52:34.600]  Freedom from insurance.
[52:34.600 --> 52:40.600]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[52:40.600 --> 52:45.600]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.
[52:45.600 --> 52:47.600]  Choose from three health sharing programs.
[52:47.600 --> 52:49.600]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[52:49.600 --> 52:50.600]  See guidelines.
[52:50.600 --> 52:53.600]  Discount programs available for dental, vision and pharmacy.
[52:53.600 --> 52:55.600]  Go to libertyoncall.org.
[52:55.600 --> 53:24.600]  That's libertyoncall.org.

[53:55.600 --> 54:00.600]  Visit pixwireless.com
[54:25.600 --> 54:30.600]  Baby, baby, baby
[54:30.600 --> 54:34.600]  Baby, baby, baby
[54:34.600 --> 54:35.600]  Baby
[54:35.600 --> 54:38.600]  Woo!
[54:38.600 --> 54:39.600]  That's right.
[54:39.600 --> 54:42.600]  Out there, the globalists get involved in our families.
[54:42.600 --> 54:46.600]  In the ancient, eternal relationship between men and women.
[54:46.600 --> 54:51.600]  How much fathers love their daughters, how much mothers love their sons and vice versa.
[54:51.600 --> 54:55.600]  Trying to turn the species itself against each other.
[54:55.600 --> 54:57.600]  Women.
[54:57.600 --> 55:06.600]  Believing they're empowered because they see men falling before them and the system collapsing.
[55:06.600 --> 55:14.600]  And then they're so unhappy because they're married to a state that's there to take all their resources away
[55:14.600 --> 55:17.600]  and only give them a culture of death.
[55:17.600 --> 55:20.600]  Speaking of culture of life.
[55:20.600 --> 55:28.600]  The surgeon general and the American Dental Association get it right when they say a lot of heart attacks are associated with bacteria
[55:28.600 --> 55:34.600]  that get into the bloodstream and create plaques inside the arteries and veins and inside the ventricles of the heart
[55:34.600 --> 55:40.600]  because they're first able to have colonies develop inside the teeth or on the gum line
[55:40.600 --> 55:42.600]  and then get into the bloodstream.
[55:42.600 --> 55:48.600]  That's why it's essential that you go out and get at least in my view three, four cleanings, deep scale cleanings a year
[55:48.600 --> 55:53.600]  and that you also brush in my view three times a day intensely and floss.
[55:53.600 --> 56:00.600]  But a lot of toothpaste obviously a fluoride or they got a bunch of garbage or a bunch of silicates that tear up your teeth.
[56:00.600 --> 56:10.600]  My dad, it's a long time retired dentist has developed a lot of products in his time and he developed super blue non fluoride toothpaste.
[56:10.600 --> 56:19.600]  The reason it's so game changing is it has iodine and nano silver in it and it's a big old tube made right here in America
[56:19.600 --> 56:27.600]  by the leading producer of organic toothpaste but this is our own proprietary system made there on their assembly line.
[56:27.600 --> 56:31.600]  That's peppermint and tea tree oil it's going to sell out in the next week and a half.
[56:31.600 --> 56:37.600]  This is so popular now I'm going to double down even more in order even more now we put another big order will take too much to get more.
[56:37.600 --> 56:42.600]  And then of course you have bubblegum flavor that's being produced right now that doesn't have the peppermint and tea tree oil at it
[56:42.600 --> 56:46.600]  because that obviously that's pretty strong some kids don't like it especially younger children.
[56:46.600 --> 56:50.600]  So for your children with the iodine and the silver the bubblegum is coming.
[56:50.600 --> 57:01.600]  So infowarstore.com infowarslife.com or call toll three triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[57:01.600 --> 57:07.600]  That's triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[57:07.600 --> 57:10.600]  And it really is the best toothpaste out there from our research.
[57:10.600 --> 57:12.600]  We set out to do it.
[57:12.600 --> 57:15.600]  We've got some of the reviews here on the site.
[57:15.600 --> 57:19.600]  Let me just read you a few of these new reviews five star review Ed Hunter Omaha Nebraska.
[57:19.600 --> 57:24.600]  I can put you notice a difference after about three days of use best toothpaste ever.
[57:24.600 --> 57:26.600]  I'll never use anything else now.
[57:26.600 --> 57:38.600]  This is Carlos unfortunately Chicago the one and only toothpaste I use I have searched the entire liberal occupied Chicago land area for toothpaste with no fluoride.
[57:38.600 --> 57:50.600]  I am glad they have formulated a toothpaste that substitutes fluoride for iodine which again is the good halogen fluoride is the bad halogen for the body.
[57:50.600 --> 57:58.600]  infowarslife.com or call toll three triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[57:58.600 --> 58:00.600]  And I want to thank you all for your support.

[58:09.600 --> 58:14.600]  The radio stations carrying this show are on the front lines of really battling for the future of this country.
[58:14.600 --> 58:22.600]  And now it's so clear as global government is in crisis and attempting to plunge our economy so they can dictate the terms of our surrender.
[58:22.600 --> 58:23.600]  Let's not let them do that.
[58:23.600 --> 58:24.600]  All right.
[58:24.600 --> 58:29.600]  Our number two is going to be jam packed with the press conference coming up any minute now with the president the president.
[58:29.600 --> 58:30.600]  That's Donald Trump the president.
[58:30.600 --> 58:31.600]  Yes.
[58:31.600 --> 58:32.600]  The anti-globalist is in there.
[58:32.600 --> 58:37.600]  We're winning the tide is turning and so much more in our number two.
[58:37.600 --> 58:49.600]  Please spread the URL infowars.com or slash show you are listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today.
[58:49.600 --> 58:56.600]  First Trump submits a temporary travel ban something legal and lawful done in the past based off Obama's list.
[58:56.600 --> 59:02.600]  Then the Democrats and media spin it protests ensue nationwide judges block it and Trump tweets see you in court.
[59:02.600 --> 59:11.600]  Meanwhile Steve Jern a U.S. Marine working in Iraq post a viral video explaining to people that if an American walks out on the streets in Iraq he'd be scooped up and tortured.
[59:11.600 --> 59:21.600]  Then 15 hours later after that video gets viewed millions of times he gets blocked on Facebook and is evacuated out of Iraq and sent back to America.
[59:21.600 --> 59:31.600]  Now hundreds of thousands of Iranians are rallying in the streets carrying signs and chanting death to America while a military police band plays revolutionary music getting hyped up over their enemy.
[59:31.600 --> 59:39.600]  Us let's not forget terrorists have been taking advantage of refugee programs for years and Assad has just said there are terrorists within the refugees.
[59:39.600 --> 59:44.600]  Are these judges not treasonous you still want to protest the travel ban.
[59:44.600 --> 1:00:11.600]  This is Owen Schreuer for info wars dot com. You can't script this. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:11.600 --> 1:00:24.600]  Before America can be great again. She must be free again. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:29.600]  Coming up soon Trump's schedule this hour to have a press conference to respond to the night circuit.
[1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:36.600]  The same court that ruled years ago that American flags are hurtful and can be banned from California schools.
[1:00:36.600 --> 1:00:43.600]  They're reversed 80% of the time. A lot of times higher courts don't hear it like the Supreme Court that is its higher court.
[1:00:43.600 --> 1:00:49.600]  But right now let's go to a clip here. Seeing it compares Islamic terror to lightning.
[1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:53.600]  Well, yeah, because we haven't brought in as many here.
[1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:59.600]  But if you're in the Middle East or areas of Europe, thousands and thousands of not hundreds of thousands are being killed a year.
[1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:11.600]  And so we're bringing in incompatible oppressive groups to this country. Meanwhile, Trump has increased letting in refugees from the Middle East that are Christian that are real refugees.
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:18.600]  But the media is silent on that. That story is on info wars dot com right now. But here's part of the CNN propaganda.
[1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:29.600]  You know that more Americans are killed by lightning strikes every year than by terrorism. So how much do you want Americans to worry about terrorism here?
[1:01:29.600 --> 1:01:36.600]  Well, I would just tell you if you go to the nightclub, the gay nightclub in Orlando and talk about what this means to that community.
[1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:49.600]  And you want to compare that terror attack to lightning, Allison, or you want to go to Boston for the bombing and talk to those in Boston who were bombed by radical Islamic terrorists and say you want to compare that to lightning.
[1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:51.600]  I challenge you to have that conversation.
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:53.600]  Yeah, we did go.
[1:01:53.600 --> 1:01:55.600]  Yeah, how about the 300,000 killed in Syria?
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:59.600]  Lightning may be random, but this is purposeful. It's death.
[1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:05.600]  Let's stop right there. It's like saying lightning kills more people than rattlesnakes every year.
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:16.600]  Lightning kills a lot of people, hundreds and hundreds. So can we like put rattlesnakes in our beds at night because, you know, only a few hundred people die a year from them?
[1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:19.600]  I mean, it's crazy.
[1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:22.600]  The numbers we have are like 50 a year.
[1:02:22.600 --> 1:02:28.600]  And you'll get terrorism worldwide. It's in the tens of thousands and it's mainly against Christians and it's massively exploding.
[1:02:28.600 --> 1:02:30.600]  Let's go to the next piece, though.
[1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:33.600]  This is flashback.
[1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:44.600]  FBI cannot vet Syrian refugees, but you watch the news. I had your spiegel here a couple days ago and the guy with a straight face kept looking at me going, Alex.
[1:02:44.600 --> 1:02:47.600]  It's extreme vetted. These are all vetted. These are all safe.
[1:02:47.600 --> 1:02:53.600]  And I'm like, Sudan and Libya are failed states. They have fake passports you can make up on a computer.
[1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:56.600]  That's it. I have all the articles. Oh, come on, Alex.
[1:02:56.600 --> 1:03:03.600]  They talk to you like you're stupid because you're informed and they just make this look like you're wrong, even though you know you're right.
[1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:12.600]  Like, Obamacare is free, Alex. There's no penalties, Alex. Yes, there is. It's right here in the bill. Alex, stop being racist.
[1:03:12.600 --> 1:03:27.600]  Before this committee, Assistant Director Steinback said that the concerns in Syria is that we don't have the systems in place on the ground to collect the information to vet.
[1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:38.600]  That would be the concern. Databases don't hold the information on these individuals. Is that still the position of the department?
[1:03:38.600 --> 1:03:45.600]  Yes, I think that's the challenge we're all talking about, is that we can only query against that which we have collected.
[1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:54.600]  And so if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database,
[1:03:54.600 --> 1:04:02.600]  we can query our database until the cows come home, but we're not going to – nothing show up because we have no record on that person.
[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:09.600]  As Assistant Director Steinback was talking about, you can only query what you've collected. And with respect to Iraqi refugees,
[1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:16.600]  we had far more in our databases because of our country's work there for a decade. This is a different situation.
[1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:23.600]  Now, let me tell you what the customs officials really want to do. And this information is classified, but they classify everything.
[1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:32.600]  And so I'm just going to tell you, and I've been aware of this for a decade, Google has software where you can take a picture of somebody and run it on your computer,
[1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:38.600]  and it's free software, and it'll find that person. And you can also have picture match where it's the exact picture,
[1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:45.600]  and they find it really quick in seconds and where it came from. They at the border, when these people have fake passports that don't know who they are,
[1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:53.600]  they want to just take their picture, run it against the database of the Internet, to pop up that indeed they're really a jihadi on their own Facebook,
[1:04:53.600 --> 1:04:59.600]  because these people are so arrogant, they'll have their own Facebooks showing they're a terrorist.
[1:04:59.600 --> 1:05:06.600]  First, Trump submits a temporary travel ban, something legal and lawful, done in the past, based off Obama's list.
[1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:12.600]  Then the Democrats and media spin it, protests ensue nationwide, judges block it, and Trump tweets, see you in court.
[1:05:12.600 --> 1:05:20.600]  Meanwhile, Steve Jern, a US Marine working in Iraq, posts a viral video explaining to people that if an American walks out on the streets in Iraq,
[1:05:20.600 --> 1:05:27.600]  he'd be scooped up and tortured. Then, 15 hours later, after that video gets viewed millions of times, he gets blocked on Facebook
[1:05:27.600 --> 1:05:34.600]  and is evacuated out of Iraq and sent back to America. Now, hundreds of thousands of Iranians are rallying in the streets,
[1:05:34.600 --> 1:05:41.600]  carrying signs and chanting, Death to America, while a military police band plays revolutionary music, getting hyped up over their enemy.
[1:05:41.600 --> 1:05:50.600]  Us, let's not forget, terrorists have been taking advantage of refugee programs for years, and Assad has just said there are terrorists within the refugees.
[1:05:50.600 --> 1:06:19.600]  Are these judges not treasonous? You still want to protest the travel ban? This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com. You can't script this.

[1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:16.600]  Okay, the Japanese Prime Minister has already come out of the podium. President Trump is set to any minute now at the White House.
[1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:24.600]  The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:47.600 --> 1:08:55.600]  You can see what he's saying in the closed caption, but they are about to speak, so let's go to a few minutes of that live right now.
[1:08:55.600 --> 1:09:02.600]  To the very famous White House, you honor us with your presence.
[1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:14.600]  This is one of our earliest visits from a foreign leader, and I am truly glad that it could be from such an important and steadfast ally.
[1:09:14.600 --> 1:09:24.600]  The bond between our two nations and the friendship between our two peoples runs very, very deep.
[1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:31.600]  This administration is committed to bringing those ties even closer.
[1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:46.600]  We are committed to the security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control and to further strengthening our very crucial alliance.
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:52.600]  The US-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace and stability.
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:10:00.600]  In the Pacific region, it is important that both Japan and the United States continue to invest very heavily.
[1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:05.600]  He's probably coming up building up defense because of China.
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:12.600]  He'll probably make his comments here in a moment about the ruling last night, and then we'll get on back to the broadcast, but this is important.
[1:10:12.600 --> 1:10:14.600]  Let's go back to the President.
[1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:18.600]  Ultimately, they will be impenetrable.
[1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:25.600]  We face numerous challenges, and bilateral cooperation is essential.
[1:10:25.600 --> 1:10:31.600]  Our country is committed to being an active and fully engaged partner.
[1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:42.600]  We will work together to promote our shared interests, of which we have many in the region, including freedom from navigation and of navigation,
[1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:49.600]  and defending against the North Korean missile and nuclear threat,
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:57.600]  both of which I consider a very, very high priority.
[1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:08.600]  On the economy, we will seek a trading relationship that is free, fair, and reciprocal, benefitting both of our countries.
[1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:14.600]  The vibrant exchange between us is a true blessing.
[1:11:14.600 --> 1:11:19.600]  Japan is a proud nation with a rich history and culture,
[1:11:19.600 --> 1:11:28.600]  and the American people have profound respect for your country and its traditions.
[1:11:28.600 --> 1:11:30.600]  By the way, Japan's about to give us a lot better deals there.
[1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:32.600]  He admitted because we're now allies of them against China.
[1:11:32.600 --> 1:11:34.600]  There's a secret alliance with Russia.
[1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:39.600]  The globalists know that, and we're about to take down the EU for a link up.
[1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:44.600]  We have our armed forces working together.
[1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:53.600]  Our two countries have the ability to bring greater harmony, stability, and prosperity to the Pacific region and beyond,
[1:11:53.600 --> 1:11:56.600]  improving countless lives in the process.
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:59.600]  See, the Chinese broke the deal that Kissinger made with them in the 70s.
[1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:00.600]  Highly committed.
[1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:03.600]  That they wouldn't be military, but they could dominate economics.
[1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:06.600]  They double crossed, broke the deal, and that's the pivot.
[1:12:06.600 --> 1:12:12.600]  America, I thank you for being with us today.
[1:12:12.600 --> 1:12:15.600]  We will soon be traveling to the great state of Florida.
[1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:17.600]  Okay, guys, I'm going to go to Bracken.
[1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:19.600]  I think I'll go to the prime minister now.
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:24.600]  As soon as Trump comes back and starts making comments on the night circuit, I'm going to go to him.
[1:12:24.600 --> 1:12:26.600]  That's President Trump live.
[1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:27.600]  This is the Alex Jones show.
[1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:32.600]  Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL terrorism expert, author, is our guest.
[1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:36.600]  And again, we'll come back to Trump as soon as he gets into anything on the night circuit or other big announcements,
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:38.600]  but I believe they're going to the prime minister now.
[1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:40.600]  Going back to Matt.
[1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:43.600]  Matt, we're witnessing open rebellion against the president.
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:47.600]  The state department says they're going to work to stop Le Pen getting elected in France,
[1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:53.600]  who's just a basic nationalist like Trump or the whole Brexit movement in England.
[1:12:53.600 --> 1:13:00.600]  We have them openly siding with the state department, doubling the amount of refugees that are coming in outside of the president's order.
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:02.600]  They're in open sedition.
[1:13:02.600 --> 1:13:05.600]  The night circuit ruled that American flags can be banned in California.
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:12.600]  Schools has now come out and ruled against clear law the president can engage in.
[1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:15.600]  In fact, the president's been very restrained, quite frankly.
[1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:24.600]  This is just unbelievable to see the mainstream media, the globalists, the communist Chinese, Hollywood calling for insurrection,
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:30.600]  Katy Perry calling for riots, major publications, daily calling for the president to be killed.
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:34.600]  What would you call this moment we're at right now?
[1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:38.600]  This is the political schism that we're seeing.
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:43.600]  We just haven't witnessed the Fort Sumter moment yet, which I think could come at any time.
[1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:47.600]  But the judges are clearly in open rebellion against the Constitution.
[1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:55.600]  There's nowhere in my Constitution does it say that a couple of left-wing federal judges supersede the president of the United States,
[1:13:55.600 --> 1:13:57.600]  the commander-in-chief, on immigration.
[1:13:57.600 --> 1:14:01.600]  They didn't even reference the law in their decision.
[1:14:01.600 --> 1:14:05.600]  The five-year-old could tell the law they have no purview in this area.
[1:14:05.600 --> 1:14:07.600]  Aren't they declaring themselves?
[1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:09.600]  I said this last night, Stephen Bennett said it today in Breibart.
[1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:13.600]  These three judges are declaring themselves the commander-in-chief.
[1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:21.600]  At this point, why couldn't they just demand that an aircraft carrier turn around and go off from country A to country B?
[1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:27.600]  They're declaring themselves to be the superior part of the Constitution.
[1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:34.600]  In the Constitution, Article 1 deals with the Congress for three or four pages in my little booklet.
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:37.600]  Then there's two, two-and-a-half pages on the president.
[1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:45.600]  It's about one page on the judiciary, and it even says that Congress gives the cases to the judiciary that it wants to give to the judiciary.
[1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:47.600]  And can override them.
[1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:48.600]  And can override them.
[1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:56.600]  It just takes political will, but it's easier for cowardly, you know, cuck politicians to punt and just, you know, run for cover,
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:15:01.600]  stay in their cushy job and let the judiciary make the decisions.
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:03.600]  But we're about at the end of that thread.
[1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:04.600]  That's right.
[1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:09.600]  It's such a bubble that they don't get that the mega tsunami, as you've called it, of liberty is here.
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:11.600]  They may hold it back for a while, but not for long.
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:17.600]  I mean, the law could not be clearer and the president's purview could not be clearer.
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:27.600]  I think that the liberal politicians and judges are playing checkers and they just jumped one piece and they're celebrating.
[1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:28.600]  They're all high-fiving.
[1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:31.600]  They don't realize they're playing 3D chess against Trump.
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:34.600]  And he's thought this out months and years ahead of them.
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:39.600]  But they've been like little lobsters who just walked right into a lobster trap.
[1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:44.600]  And now they're chewing on the bait and they think that they've really put one over on the man.
[1:15:44.600 --> 1:15:47.600]  But all they've done is swim right into Trump's trap.
[1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:55.600]  Anything now that happens, the next San Bernardino or Orlando is going to be laid right on their doorstep.
[1:15:55.600 --> 1:15:56.600]  That's Sumer.
[1:15:56.600 --> 1:15:57.600]  That's Pelosi.
[1:15:57.600 --> 1:15:58.600]  That's these federal judges.
[1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:01.600]  Absolutely, what's wrong with them?
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:03.600]  Why don't they do what's popular and constitutional?
[1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:08.600]  Why are they committed that any idiot can tell playing checkers they're walking right into Trump's trap?
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:11.600]  I mean, Pelosi doesn't know that Trump's even president.
[1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:12.600]  She says Bush is.
[1:16:12.600 --> 1:16:17.600]  In the same press conference, Waters believes that Russia actually attacked Korea.
[1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:19.600]  I mean, these people are insane.
[1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:26.600]  Why does the bull charge the matador because he's waving a flashy red blanket in front of him?
[1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:33.600]  You know, the matador's got the sword behind that blanket every time the matador wins 99% of the time.
[1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:36.600]  But the matador or the bull can't help it.
[1:16:36.600 --> 1:16:42.600]  You know, the bull sees the red bandero, whatever it's called, and it has to charge.
[1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:45.600]  This is the downfall of the of the Democrats.
[1:16:45.600 --> 1:16:50.600]  Their Trump hatred is as blinded them to the long game.
[1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:52.600]  The next big act of terror.
[1:16:52.600 --> 1:16:55.600]  Never mind another 91911.
[1:16:55.600 --> 1:16:59.600]  The next San Bernardino or it will be there.
[1:16:59.600 --> 1:17:01.600]  I'll bet they totally own it.
[1:17:01.600 --> 1:17:06.600]  What about what about how he trolled them and got them to cover Islamic terror by pointing out they've been under reporting it?
[1:17:06.600 --> 1:17:14.600]  I mean, they just they don't seem to get it that they're not in an air superiority game anymore where they have a monopoly and nobody can counter them.
[1:17:14.600 --> 1:17:15.600]  That's right.
[1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:20.600]  And it kind of reminds me in a kind of a perverse way.
[1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:28.600]  You know, we're just finding out now that almost two thirds of our Navy fighters can't fly, you know, cannot or not mission capable.
[1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:39.600]  So we're in the kind of situation where we've always assumed air superiority and we would go into World War three just like it was Dr. Strangelove back in the good old days.
[1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:40.600]  But we don't have that anymore.
[1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:46.600]  Well, the Liberals, they think that they own the media air superiority.
[1:17:46.600 --> 1:17:50.600]  They're they don't they haven't yet sussed on to the fact that they're in a new era.
[1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:53.600]  They're they're in the Info Wars Breitbart era.
[1:17:53.600 --> 1:18:00.600]  The mainstream media now just gets trolled and they just actually are following the Democrats and the judges into the same trap.
[1:18:00.600 --> 1:18:03.600]  They're going to own Islamic terrorism.
[1:18:03.600 --> 1:18:05.600]  What Trump has done is really brilliant.
[1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:10.600]  He has put the Democrats and I use a capital R with that for I call them the rats.
[1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:16.600]  These put the Democrats in the same leaky boat with the Islamic terrorists.
[1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:19.600]  So they're now the same target in the same boat.
[1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:23.600]  Chuck Schumer is in the same boat with the next Omar Mateen.
[1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:24.600]  He doesn't know it yet.
[1:18:24.600 --> 1:18:25.600]  I'm going to ask you a question.
[1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:26.600]  You're a smart guy.
[1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:27.600]  I'm serious.
[1:18:27.600 --> 1:18:28.600]  What's wrong with them?
[1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:34.600]  They seem so arrogant like they have some secret weapon, but studying history and other megalomaniacs, they're delusional.
[1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:41.600]  I think the Democratic Party's Soros leadership is truly insane because they're in such cloistered bubbles.
[1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:43.600]  The Democrats have three to one money the Republicans have.
[1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:48.600]  They're really the rich, powerful KKK party that's always used race politics.
[1:18:48.600 --> 1:18:51.600]  I'm not saying all Democrats are bad, but let's just look at their history.
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:56.600]  The Republican leadership is just as cloistered, just as delusional, just as ivory towered as they are.
[1:18:56.600 --> 1:19:00.600]  And I don't think they understand that they are basically dead already politically.
[1:19:00.600 --> 1:19:02.600]  I mean, what do you think is going on with them?
[1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:07.600]  I mean, who the hell thinks that Bush is still president and that Russia attacked Korea?
[1:19:07.600 --> 1:19:09.600]  Or that the Russians stole the election?
[1:19:09.600 --> 1:19:12.600]  Delusions are extremely powerful.
[1:19:12.600 --> 1:19:14.600]  Brainwashing works.
[1:19:14.600 --> 1:19:21.600]  When you are in a cloistered thought bubble, you're kind of like the Japanese on some island in the Pacific.
[1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:24.600]  You can't come to grips with a new reality.
[1:19:24.600 --> 1:19:29.600]  You're going to be like the Japanese running off the cliffs in Saipan
[1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:35.600]  because you just can't come to grips with the fact that the other side is actually winning now.
[1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:38.600]  And you've just got to turn the page and wake up.
[1:19:38.600 --> 1:19:41.600]  They haven't turned the page. They can't turn the page.
[1:19:41.600 --> 1:19:45.600]  I have relatives even that I'm shocked.
[1:19:45.600 --> 1:19:48.600]  If you go to their Facebook page, it's I hate my whiteness.
[1:19:48.600 --> 1:19:54.600]  It's like, wait, when were the Irish the oppressors of the world?
[1:19:54.600 --> 1:19:58.600]  Everything on the page is I hate my own heritage.
[1:19:58.600 --> 1:20:00.600]  I hate capitalism.
[1:20:00.600 --> 1:20:02.600]  I hate my ethnicity.
[1:20:02.600 --> 1:20:06.600]  And if you don't hate it, then I hate you.
[1:20:06.600 --> 1:20:11.600]  If you don't hate your white privilege, then you're evil and deserve to die.
[1:20:11.600 --> 1:20:14.600]  We have a guest coming up that's gotten all the documents together.
[1:20:14.600 --> 1:20:16.600]  Can I have Rabbi Ford's article from yesterday, guys?
[1:20:16.600 --> 1:20:18.600]  I forgot to bring it in here out of yesterday.
[1:20:18.600 --> 1:20:21.600]  That they actually want to create a bunch of basket cases and mental patients at the colleges
[1:20:21.600 --> 1:20:24.600]  because they know most of the degrees are going to be worthless in the future.
[1:20:24.600 --> 1:20:29.600]  This is actually a premeditated sabotage and a drug company move
[1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:33.600]  to try to put half the kids at least or young men and women on psychotropics.
[1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:36.600]  And that's why they're, quote, triggered is they've turned the colleges
[1:20:36.600 --> 1:20:38.600]  into giant mental institutions.
[1:20:38.600 --> 1:20:44.600]  Well, not only the colleges, the smartphone generation generally
[1:20:44.600 --> 1:20:47.600]  is addicted to electronic heroin.
[1:20:47.600 --> 1:20:50.600]  I mean, it is a powerful addiction.
[1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:54.600]  If you do put brains in the MRI, then you put the kid in the MRI
[1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:56.600]  and you yank away the smartphone.
[1:20:56.600 --> 1:21:00.600]  It's just as if you took a junkie's needle away from them and smashed it.
[1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:03.600]  They absolutely go into meltdown.
[1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:05.600]  What will help happen in this country?
[1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:09.600]  God forbid the internet goes down, the grid goes down.
[1:21:09.600 --> 1:21:13.600]  Without a little magic box to tell you which way to turn
[1:21:13.600 --> 1:21:17.600]  and what to think, they're incapable of normal life
[1:21:17.600 --> 1:21:21.600]  just out in the meat space in the oxygen environment.
[1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:25.600]  What's going to happen anytime we're in a kind of a crisis
[1:21:25.600 --> 1:21:28.600]  where their little magic box is gone.
[1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:33.600]  We have literally raised an entire generation now of electronic heroin addict.
[1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:37.600]  Look at 140 plus of the people that attack me and women and children in front of me
[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:40.600]  trying to get into the Trump events, really nasty people.
[1:21:40.600 --> 1:21:46.600]  They've been indicted for rioting and assault and basically racketeering.
[1:21:46.600 --> 1:21:49.600]  Meanwhile, they've got Katy Perry in the media and the college is teaching
[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:55.600]  how to go out and put concrete inside what looks like styrofoam tubes
[1:21:55.600 --> 1:22:00.600]  or paper tubes so the police let you have it and then they hit you over the head with it
[1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:02.600]  and then you're going to end up getting indicted now.
[1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:05.600]  One day after sessions gets in and already they're being indicted.
[1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:07.600]  The rule of law is coming back.
[1:22:07.600 --> 1:22:10.600]  They're already arresting pedophile networks all over the country.
[1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:13.600]  People better realize, folks, the reason the left is fighting so hard
[1:22:13.600 --> 1:22:16.600]  is they represent a lot of criminal underground groups
[1:22:16.600 --> 1:22:19.600]  and they know their time is basically running out.
[1:22:19.600 --> 1:22:22.600]  Let's real quick go back to the President of the United States
[1:22:22.600 --> 1:22:25.600]  and his live press conference with the Japanese Prime Minister.
[1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:28.600]  Daniel Halper, New York Post. Daniel.
[1:22:34.600 --> 1:22:37.600]  I'm curious about yesterday's ruling in the Ninth Circuit Court.
[1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:40.600]  Has it caused you to rethink your use of executive power
[1:22:40.600 --> 1:22:44.600]  and how will you respond and will you sign new executive orders
[1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:46.600]  or perhaps a new traffic?
[1:22:46.600 --> 1:22:48.600]  Will you roll over to the totally legal order of the court?
[1:22:48.600 --> 1:22:52.600]  I'm curious about your reaction to America's withdrawal from the
[1:22:52.600 --> 1:22:55.600]  Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP.
[1:22:55.600 --> 1:23:00.600]  Do you think that's weakened America's position in Asia
[1:23:00.600 --> 1:23:05.600]  and how do you envision any sort of trade deal with the President working out?
[1:23:05.600 --> 1:23:09.600]  Well, your question was unrelated to what we're here for today, but I'll answer it.
[1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:11.600]  We are going to keep our country safe.
[1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:16.600]  We are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe.
[1:23:16.600 --> 1:23:20.600]  We had a decision which we think will be very successful with.
[1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:25.600]  It shouldn't have taken this much time because safety is a primary reason.
[1:23:25.600 --> 1:23:29.600]  One of the reasons I'm standing here today is the security of our country.
[1:23:29.600 --> 1:23:31.600]  The voters felt that I would give it the best security.
[1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:36.600]  So we'll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security
[1:23:36.600 --> 1:23:39.600]  for our country. You'll be seeing that sometime next week.
[1:23:39.600 --> 1:23:43.600]  In addition, we will continue to go through the court process.
[1:23:43.600 --> 1:23:53.600]  And ultimately, I have no doubt that we'll win that particular case.
[1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:59.600]  This is a press conference from the White House.
[1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:07.600]  In the world, we are also facing the issues of refugees and terrorism.
[1:24:07.600 --> 1:24:11.600]  We need to work closely together on these global issues.
[1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:13.600]  Japan will not let one Muslim in.
[1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:16.600]  Japan will always play our own role.
[1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:20.600]  But come forward, we will continue to work with international communities.
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:23.600]  They want to kill people for their visas? You don't come in our country.
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:26.600]  Execute our responsibility in a commercial manner.
[1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:29.600]  Terrorism, zero.
[1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:35.600]  And each of our country has immigration control, the scheme,
[1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:38.600]  as well as policy on immigration, as well as refugees.
[1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:41.600]  These are to do with domestic affairs of that country,
[1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:44.600]  so I would refrain from making any comments.
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:47.600]  You just said we have it too. I mean, they have total control.
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:57.600]  Fox, Blake Berman.
[1:24:57.600 --> 1:24:59.600]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:02.600]  I'd like to pick up where Daniel left off, if you don't mind.
[1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:05.600]  You said earlier this week, and I'm quoting for you,
[1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:08.600]  you said, I've learned a lot in the last two weeks,
[1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:12.600]  and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand,
[1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:16.600]  but we're going to take care of it based off of what you have learned.
[1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:21.600]  Your executive order is at least temporarily on hold.
[1:25:21.600 --> 1:25:25.600]  Do you still feel as confident now as you have been at any point
[1:25:25.600 --> 1:25:29.600]  that you and the administration will be able to protect the homeland?
[1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:31.600]  And, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you.
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:33.600]  I would just like to pick off.
[1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:36.600]  What happens when the Jihadi is attacking you?
[1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:42.600]  Do you feel it's a mistake that the United States has at least signaled its intention
[1:25:42.600 --> 1:25:45.600]  to withdraw from the deal? Thank you both.
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:53.600]  I feel totally confident that we will have tremendous security
[1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:55.600]  for the people of the United States.
[1:25:55.600 --> 1:26:02.600]  We will be extreme vetting, which is a term that I developed early in my campaign
[1:26:02.600 --> 1:26:04.600]  because I saw what was happening.
[1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:08.600]  And while I've been president, which is just for a very short period of time,
[1:26:08.600 --> 1:26:12.600]  I've learned tremendous things that you could only learn, frankly,
[1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:16.600]  if you were in a certain position, namely president.
[1:26:16.600 --> 1:26:20.600]  And there are tremendous threats to our country.
[1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:23.600]  We will not allow that to happen. I can tell you that right now.
[1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:25.600]  We will not allow that to happen.
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:27.600]  So we'll be going forward.
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:32.600]  We'll be doing things to continue to make our country safe.
[1:26:32.600 --> 1:26:34.600]  It will happen rapidly.
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:41.600]  And we will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people.
[1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:46.600]  We will allow lots of people into our country that will love our people
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:48.600]  and do good for our country.
[1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:50.600]  He's letting questions in now that have actually been persecuted.
[1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:52.600]  That's on infowars.com.
[1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:54.600]  I can tell you that.
[1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:57.600]  Trump opens border to Christians, refugees, but left ignores.
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:08.600]  On TPP, we are fully aware of President Trump's decision.
[1:27:08.600 --> 1:27:13.600]  On economic issues, we will be discussing at the working lunch to follow.
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:18.600]  As for Japan and the United States, a trade and investment, as well as economic relations,
[1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:21.600]  how can we develop and grow our relationship?
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:23.600]  As I have already mentioned,
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:30.600]  Deputy Prime Minister Aso and Vice President Pence will create a new framework for dialogue.
[1:27:30.600 --> 1:27:32.600]  That's right. Okay, that's good.
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:34.600]  The United States has made an alliance with Japan.
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:38.600]  It's one of the only countries that's actually invested here and built factories all over the United States.
[1:27:38.600 --> 1:27:41.600]  More than Ford and other companies, there's like,
[1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:43.600]  a whole bunch of their factories are out here in Texas.
[1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:45.600]  And so that's good.
[1:27:45.600 --> 1:27:49.600]  The multilateral agreements are sucker deals for the US.
[1:27:49.600 --> 1:27:54.600]  Here we are, either the first or second most powerful economy in the world.
[1:27:54.600 --> 1:28:01.600]  When you join one of these multi-dozen countries, Brunei plus Vietnam outvote us.
[1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:06.600]  People that want to hook us into being one of 12 or 15 don't have our best interests.
[1:28:06.600 --> 1:28:08.600]  They know they can bribe their way.
[1:28:08.600 --> 1:28:11.600]  They can get Brunei's vote through bribery and corruption.
[1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:19.600]  So we really want to join groups that where little Pipsqueak countries like Vietnam and Brunei can outvote the United States.
[1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:21.600]  Sure, let's expand. We are the biggest economy.
[1:28:21.600 --> 1:28:23.600]  China's got all fraudulent stock market numbers.
[1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:25.600]  It's a paper tiger, a paper dragon.
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:27.600]  It's about to collapse.
[1:28:27.600 --> 1:28:29.600]  But we've been deindustrialized.
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:31.600]  We've got to build that back. We don't have a country.
[1:28:31.600 --> 1:28:35.600]  Closing comments on just the whole situation in the next minute, Matt Bracken.
[1:28:35.600 --> 1:28:38.600]  Well, I think that Trump is thinking way ahead on this.
[1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:44.600]  He's very brilliantly maneuvered the Democrats into stampeding into this what they think is a victory.
[1:28:44.600 --> 1:28:52.600]  It's going to be a very hollow victory for them because the first act of Islamic terrorism in this country, the Democrats own it 100%.
[1:28:52.600 --> 1:29:06.600]  And it's going to demolish them in 2018. It's going to also stiffen the backbones of Republican Congress to put very strong constitutional conservative judges everywhere that they can.
[1:29:06.600 --> 1:29:11.600]  This is really stung Trump, I think, seeing just how radical these Ninth Circuit judges were.
[1:29:11.600 --> 1:29:15.600]  But it's going to have ramifications all throughout federal judiciary.
[1:29:15.600 --> 1:29:18.600]  They need to clean house also the State Department everywhere else.
[1:29:18.600 --> 1:29:22.600]  It's crazy. They have no right under any 200-plus years.
[1:29:22.600 --> 1:29:25.600]  Courts have never acted like this. This is insane.
[1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:27.600]  The law is completely understandable.
[1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:32.600]  This is three judges usurping the power of the president as commander-in-chief.
[1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:34.600]  They might as well move into the White House.
[1:29:34.600 --> 1:29:37.600]  I agree. All right, Matt Bracken, thank you so much. Talk to you soon.
[1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:38.600]  Thank you.
[1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:41.600]  Thank you, Rebecca. John Rappaport on why are the colleges so brainwashed?
[1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:43.600]  What's wrong with these young adults?
[1:29:43.600 --> 1:29:48.600]  Well, it turns out it's a scientific plan to turn them into the gibbering maniacs they are.
[1:29:48.600 --> 1:29:52.600]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:52.600 --> 1:30:18.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:18.600 --> 1:30:24.600]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable and stronger than anything else on the market.
[1:30:24.600 --> 1:30:27.600]  You said when you talk to people that have been using this actually testing for years,
[1:30:27.600 --> 1:30:30.600]  people that currently are testing for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[1:30:30.600 --> 1:30:31.600]  What did they really say about them?
[1:30:31.600 --> 1:30:34.600]  They want to know how do they get it? Where do they find it?
[1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:38.600]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[1:30:38.600 --> 1:30:41.600]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[1:30:41.600 --> 1:30:43.600]  I mean, it's unbelievable. It's a quarter-inch thick.
[1:30:43.600 --> 1:30:46.600]  It's got a 20-year warranty. It's waterproof. You can wear it. It's comfortable.
[1:30:46.600 --> 1:30:48.600]  And we shot everything you can imagine of it.
[1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:53.600]  Again, fund the info or get the game changing in nanotech tubes.

[1:30:57.600 --> 1:31:17.600]  And at Forrester.com, it's amazing.
[1:31:28.600 --> 1:31:32.600]  BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[1:31:32.600 --> 1:31:36.600]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.

[1:32:26.600 --> 1:32:30.600]  In these uncertain times,
[1:32:30.600 --> 1:32:34.600]  it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[1:32:34.600 --> 1:32:38.600]  If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove or cooking over an open fire,
[1:32:38.600 --> 1:32:40.600]  then there's a much better way.
[1:32:40.600 --> 1:32:43.600]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass burning cooking stove
[1:32:43.600 --> 1:32:46.600]  that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:48.600]  The Minuteman stove is easy to use,
[1:32:48.600 --> 1:32:50.600]  smokeless, portable, powerful and sustainable.
[1:32:50.600 --> 1:32:55.600]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA,

[1:36:59.600 --> 1:37:02.600]  The black kids. Everybody is sick of this crap.
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:05.600]  As children, they inherently know they haven't done anything
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:07.600]  and their parents haven't either.
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:10.600]  They were brought up liberal and they're sick of hearing their bad
[1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:14.600]  and they understand the man and the brainwashing when they see it, Gavin.
[1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:16.600]  Well they made a fatal mistake.
[1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:19.600]  You see their narrative doesn't have truth on its side
[1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:23.600]  and it may have worked if back in the Dewey Decimal System days,
[1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:26.600]  they had to go to the library to look up whether what your teacher was saying
[1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:28.600]  is true or not.
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:30.600]  But they did it in the information age.
[1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:33.600]  They did it when we could just Google it and we hear white men are evil,
[1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:36.600]  Western society sucks, America's a racist hellhole.
[1:37:36.600 --> 1:37:40.600]  And they just go to YouTube, they go to Google, they look up and they go,
[1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:44.600]  wait a minute, everything my teacher's saying is a lie.
[1:37:44.600 --> 1:37:49.600]  And when reality isn't on your side, when your narrative is the opposite of the truth,
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:52.600]  you should shy away from any information.
[1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:54.600]  We're noticing this with cops and body cams.
[1:37:54.600 --> 1:37:56.600]  They said, we need cops to be responsible.
[1:37:56.600 --> 1:37:57.600]  We want body cams.
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:37:58.600]  The cops said, sure.
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:38:02.600]  And now we're seeing these kids are pointing guns at them before they get shot.
[1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:04.600]  Oops.
[1:38:04.600 --> 1:38:06.600]  Wow, we've only got like 20 minutes with you.
[1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:07.600]  Where to start?
[1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:10.600]  I mean, what do you make of Trump's first three weeks?
[1:38:10.600 --> 1:38:14.600]  Just your top points.
[1:38:14.600 --> 1:38:17.600]  Well, you talked about a bunch of different things
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:20.600]  and I think they all do convalesce.
[1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:22.600]  Is that the word?
[1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:24.600]  The mainstream media is done, right?
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:30.600]  Fox News, ABC, they're all watched by 70-year-olds who aren't invested in society.
[1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:34.600]  You also have, our side just ended up being the cool fun side.
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:37.600]  Like when I did my talk at NYU last week and got pepper sprayed,
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:41.600]  I'm looking at the guys we're with and they're a hell of a lot more diverse,
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:44.600]  especially when you include class, than these Antifa kids.
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:47.600]  The Antifa kids are all living with their parents,
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:49.600]  92% live with their parents.
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:51.600]  They're all sons of professors.
[1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:53.600]  They're all rich white squares.
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:57.600]  And the second we started punching back, they started screaming for police.
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:38:59.600]  And I gotta say, I've been in a few fights,
[1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:04.600]  but there's nothing funner than fighting these so-called anti-fascists.
[1:39:04.600 --> 1:39:06.600]  Well, I watched the video.
[1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:08.600]  They run up and punch you and others at the back of the head
[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:10.600]  and then you just grab them and start beating them down
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:12.600]  on something they start squealing for mommy.
[1:39:12.600 --> 1:39:15.600]  Well, the NYU wouldn't let my guys in.
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:17.600]  They locked the doors.
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:20.600]  And then they went, okay, and just started boom, boom, boom,
[1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:21.600]  plowing through them.
[1:39:21.600 --> 1:39:23.600]  Some of our guys went to jail for defending themselves.
[1:39:23.600 --> 1:39:25.600]  They'll get out soon enough.
[1:39:25.600 --> 1:39:27.600]  I mean, they did get out, but the court date won't matter.
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:29.600]  I think it'll just be a violation.
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:30.600]  But it was really fun.
[1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:32.600]  One of my guys said he started to feel bad
[1:39:32.600 --> 1:39:35.600]  because they were clearly never been in a fight before
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:38.600]  and he was just pounding them in the face, feeling guilty.
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:41.600]  You know, like in World War II with the Russians,
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:43.600]  they just used so much human fodder
[1:39:43.600 --> 1:39:46.600]  that I think the Germans started to feel bad about killing all these Russians.
[1:39:46.600 --> 1:39:48.600]  That's what it was like fighting these guys.
[1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:51.600]  It was just, oh, my fists are starting to hurt.
[1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:54.600]  Well, I got to tell you, it's incredible though.
[1:39:54.600 --> 1:39:57.600]  But the way, the fact that they're getting in the street,
[1:39:57.600 --> 1:39:59.600]  none of their mother's basements, as you said,
[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:00.600]  90% live with their parents.
[1:40:00.600 --> 1:40:01.600]  Most of them are virgins.
[1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:02.600]  They never date.
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:04.600]  They're really scared of the world.
[1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:06.600]  It's kind of good they're coming out and getting their ass kicked
[1:40:06.600 --> 1:40:07.600]  and starting to fight.
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:09.600]  So I'm sure you saw the articles all over the country.
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:12.600]  They're training now to fight us and attack us.
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:16.600]  You know, as if 25 years of fighting that I've had
[1:40:16.600 --> 1:40:19.600]  till I stopped fighting and, you know, the court cases
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:21.600]  and the people in commas and all the rest of it
[1:40:21.600 --> 1:40:23.600]  teached me not to do it anymore, even if they start to fight.
[1:40:23.600 --> 1:40:25.600]  I mean, it's like, you don't have 25 years, guys.
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:28.600]  You're not going to get trained to fight even in a month.
[1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:31.600]  Well, it's also the lack of courage.
[1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:33.600]  They don't have the courage of their convictions,
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:35.600]  so they can't have courage in a street fight.
[1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:37.600]  I mean, there's two types of fights, right?
[1:40:37.600 --> 1:40:40.600]  There's the fight in the pub when someone spills your pint
[1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:42.600]  and your heart's not really in it.
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:44.600]  Someone slaps your mother, you want to eat their face.
[1:40:44.600 --> 1:40:45.600]  Exactly.
[1:40:45.600 --> 1:40:47.600]  There's kind of a drunken, you're being a jerk, had a bad day.
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:50.600]  You kind of, you know, hit you a few times, you're both idiots.
[1:40:50.600 --> 1:40:53.600]  But then somebody's up to your mother, you can, like, pick cars up.
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:54.600]  Yes.
[1:40:54.600 --> 1:40:55.600]  Like, deplorable.
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:40:57.600]  They go there and these anarchists show up
[1:40:57.600 --> 1:40:58.600]  and they walk in front of me.
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:00.600]  I've got all these women behind me.
[1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:04.600]  We're in a sort of a Spartan phalanx fighting them.
[1:41:04.600 --> 1:41:07.600]  And the fact that this kid, this little fake anarchist,
[1:41:07.600 --> 1:41:10.600]  was trying to stop me from going to a ball
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:14.600]  and attacking the women behind me and threatening their children,
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:17.600]  that was just, I had the agency now.
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:21.600]  I had the background, the rage, and it was just so easy to bow.
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:23.600]  And meanwhile, they're just dressing up.
[1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:24.600]  Yeah, that's the fight.
[1:41:24.600 --> 1:41:26.600]  They're just dressing up for Halloween.
[1:41:26.600 --> 1:41:27.600]  That's why they don't want to debate.
[1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:29.600]  They don't really believe any of this stuff.
[1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:31.600]  And that's why their hearts aren't in the fight.
[1:41:31.600 --> 1:41:33.600]  Yeah, they don't know what to do when you start punching them
[1:41:33.600 --> 1:41:34.600]  upside the head.
[1:41:34.600 --> 1:41:36.600]  And that's the crazy part about this is, when you hit them back,
[1:41:36.600 --> 1:41:39.600]  they start squealing and begging and calling the police.
[1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:40.600]  Don't they understand?
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:41.600]  They just punched you.
[1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:42.600]  Another thing.
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:43.600]  I'm sorry to say it.
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:45.600]  I don't care if it was black, white, Hispanic folks.
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:46.600]  As you said, very diverse crowd.
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:47.600]  They had to pour a ball at other places.
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:51.600]  The libertarian conservatives are a good-looking crowd.
[1:41:51.600 --> 1:41:55.600]  The other side looked like they got hit with a mutation ray.
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:41:59.600]  Well, what's really been going on for the past quarter century is,
[1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:01.600]  conservatives have been wimps.
[1:42:01.600 --> 1:42:04.600]  I remember when Rush Limbaugh called Sandra Fluck a slut.
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:07.600]  I heard all these Republicans and conservatives going,
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:08.600]  oh, no, no, no, no.
[1:42:08.600 --> 1:42:09.600]  I'm not backing that.
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:10.600]  He took the low road.
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:11.600]  She is a slut.
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:13.600]  She wants us to pay for her lube and condoms.
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:14.600]  Pay for them yourself.
[1:42:14.600 --> 1:42:15.600]  Exactly.
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:17.600]  It's a dictionary definition of a slut.
[1:42:17.600 --> 1:42:18.600]  And I said, no, no, no.
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:20.600]  We're not doing any of this high road crap anymore.
[1:42:20.600 --> 1:42:23.600]  When someone punches us, we punch back twice as hard.
[1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:24.600]  We're the new Malcolm Xs.
[1:42:24.600 --> 1:42:26.600]  We're the new by any means necessary.
[1:42:26.600 --> 1:42:29.600]  And they don't have the gumption to take us on.
[1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:32.600]  And it feels so liberating to finally say,
[1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:34.600]  no, we're not going to be polite anymore.
[1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:37.600]  We're not going to be nice because you're a liar and you're
[1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:40.600]  trying to restrict my freedoms.
[1:42:40.600 --> 1:42:44.600]  And they dehumanize us by screaming racist KKK go away.
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:45.600]  That's all they've got.
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:47.600]  And none of their people will even talk to you.
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:49.600]  They always just are controlled by these weird leaders.
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:53.600]  And you find out it's Islamist funded by Soros that ran the
[1:42:53.600 --> 1:42:54.600]  women's march in DC.
[1:42:54.600 --> 1:42:57.600]  I was there and then we're handing out a jibs to all the women
[1:42:57.600 --> 1:42:58.600]  plastic jibs.
[1:42:58.600 --> 1:42:59.600]  And what is this?
[1:42:59.600 --> 1:43:02.600]  Where the feminists are chanting Allah Akbar and saying,
[1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:03.600]  we want Sharia.
[1:43:03.600 --> 1:43:07.600]  What type of weird mass Stockholm syndrome cuckling is that?
[1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:11.600]  I mean, if you, if I heard you out of context and I was away on
[1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:13.600]  vacation, I would say, well, that can't be right.
[1:43:13.600 --> 1:43:17.600]  But everything you just said is literally true.
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:18.600]  She got out there.
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:19.600]  She said, I still am.
[1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:21.600]  This is Linda Sarsour.
[1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:25.600]  She's pro Sharia law in Sharia courts.
[1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:28.600]  A woman's vote is worth half a man's vote in Sharia law.
[1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:30.600]  You can beat your wife in Sharia law.
[1:43:30.600 --> 1:43:32.600]  There's no such thing as marriage rape.
[1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:34.600]  You can't rape during a marriage.
[1:43:34.600 --> 1:43:35.600]  It just doesn't exist.
[1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:36.600]  And she's pushing for this.
[1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:38.600]  It was a pro choice march.
[1:43:38.600 --> 1:43:39.600]  Muslims are pro life.
[1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:41.600]  And then they have that woman.
[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:42.600]  Donna Hilton comes out.
[1:43:42.600 --> 1:43:47.600]  She murdered a man by sodomizing him to death and she's sitting
[1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:51.600]  up there on a podium talking about LGBT violence and how we
[1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:53.600]  have to come together and stop dropping me.
[1:43:53.600 --> 1:43:56.600]  I'm thinking, how about we have to come together and stop
[1:43:56.600 --> 1:43:59.600]  from sodomizing men to death?
[1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:00.600]  You lunatic.
[1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:01.600]  That's right.
[1:44:01.600 --> 1:44:02.600]  Kidnapped them, sodomizing to death.
[1:44:02.600 --> 1:44:05.600]  And then meanwhile, they're calling how we hate gay people
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:08.600]  when they're the ones with the Muslims that kill gays.
[1:44:08.600 --> 1:44:09.600]  I mean, I get accused.
[1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:11.600]  I said, look, trannies are not women.
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:12.600]  They're just mentally ill gays.
[1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:17.600]  That became, you are advocating violence against trans people.
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:18.600]  What?
[1:44:18.600 --> 1:44:20.600]  I don't care enough about trans people that advocate violence.
[1:44:20.600 --> 1:44:23.600]  And I go, if you're looking for someone who advocates violence
[1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:26.600]  against gays and trans, go check out Islam.
[1:44:26.600 --> 1:44:29.600]  Go see how well they do in Turkey where they just burnt a man
[1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:32.600]  alive, burnt him to death and dismembered him because he was
[1:44:32.600 --> 1:44:33.600]  dressed as a woman.
[1:44:33.600 --> 1:44:36.600]  I can show you hours of footage all over the Middle East of them
[1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:39.600]  winding up gay men they catch and throwing them off buildings.
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:40.600]  And why?
[1:44:40.600 --> 1:44:43.600]  And then you go, well, wait a minute, why are you choosing them
[1:44:43.600 --> 1:44:46.600]  as bedfellows when they personify everything you hate?
[1:44:46.600 --> 1:44:49.600]  And that's when you realize, oh, you're not in it for justice.
[1:44:49.600 --> 1:44:50.600]  You're not in it for equality.
[1:44:50.600 --> 1:44:52.600]  You're in it for sabotage.
[1:44:52.600 --> 1:44:56.600]  And these Muslims, these radical extremists seem to be the best
[1:44:56.600 --> 1:44:57.600]  at sabotage.
[1:44:57.600 --> 1:44:58.600]  Well, that's it.
[1:44:58.600 --> 1:44:59.600]  They just take the West.
[1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:00.600]  They feel like losers.
[1:45:00.600 --> 1:45:01.600]  It's exponential envy.
[1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:03.600]  They feel like they don't have a piece of the pie because they
[1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:04.600]  grew up in basements.
[1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:05.600]  Nothing against that.
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:07.600]  But you're supposed to get out of them on the time you're 14.
[1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:09.600]  And, you know, we've all sat there eating hot pies in a basement
[1:45:09.600 --> 1:45:10.600]  at one time or not playing games.
[1:45:10.600 --> 1:45:14.600]  But they just are mad at the party, you know, like the wicked
[1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:17.600]  witch is mad at the balls she's not invited to.
[1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:18.600]  Yeah.
[1:45:18.600 --> 1:45:22.600]  You know, when I saw Milo in that giant tub of pigs blood wearing
[1:45:22.600 --> 1:45:25.600]  a MAGA hat and he was, he had pictures of all the different
[1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:28.600]  victims of illegal aliens on his wall, murder victims.
[1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:32.600]  And I just thought, man, the liberals and the left and Antifa
[1:45:32.600 --> 1:45:35.600]  and the communists, they must be so bummed.
[1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:38.600]  They must be so bummed to discover that they're the church ladies.
[1:45:38.600 --> 1:45:40.600]  They're the ones saying, isn't that special?
[1:45:40.600 --> 1:45:43.600]  And they're the ones that are all white and all rich and telling
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:46.600]  everyone they can't have sex and they can't say this and they
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:47.600]  can't say that.
[1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:51.600]  They've become the uptight squares that they thought they were
[1:45:51.600 --> 1:45:52.600]  fighting against.
[1:45:52.600 --> 1:45:56.600]  And we're the ones having a ball, fighting, having art shows,
[1:45:56.600 --> 1:45:59.600]  going to meetings where we get wasted and walk around with
[1:45:59.600 --> 1:46:03.600]  mad dog Madison's having a vigil in Times Square for all the
[1:46:03.600 --> 1:46:05.600]  people we lost who died of winning.
[1:46:05.600 --> 1:46:09.600]  They've just been party after party after party since November
[1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:10.600]  10th.
[1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:14.600]  And they've just been losing after losing after losing.
[1:46:14.600 --> 1:46:15.600]  You're right.
[1:46:15.600 --> 1:46:16.600]  You're right.
[1:46:16.600 --> 1:46:20.600]  I got to tell you, I'm very positive as you are about things,
[1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:22.600]  but I'm also really concerned.
[1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:23.600]  What about the judiciary?
[1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:26.600]  A clear law, something other presidents have done.
[1:46:26.600 --> 1:46:29.600]  And they're now saying they're the commander-in-chief and the
[1:46:29.600 --> 1:46:30.600]  media all celebrating.
[1:46:30.600 --> 1:46:32.600]  And I think they've walked into Trump's trap because the
[1:46:32.600 --> 1:46:34.600]  Supreme Court's going to, you know, obviously once he gets
[1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:37.600]  the new court in there, the new member rule against them,
[1:46:37.600 --> 1:46:38.600]  they'll have the 5-4.
[1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:40.600]  But I think they've really been set up by Trump.
[1:46:40.600 --> 1:46:43.600]  But still, don't they know when there's more terror attacks
[1:46:43.600 --> 1:46:45.600]  now they're going to own it?
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:48.600]  It is bizarre, but the thing I'm learning about Trump is he's
[1:46:48.600 --> 1:46:50.600]  always four chess moves ahead.
[1:46:50.600 --> 1:46:53.600]  Like when he said, with the birth certificate, he said,
[1:46:53.600 --> 1:46:56.600]  I'll offer money for anyone who can show me a fake birth
[1:46:56.600 --> 1:46:57.600]  certificate.
[1:46:57.600 --> 1:46:58.600]  Boom.
[1:46:58.600 --> 1:46:59.600]  That was the end of that thing.
[1:46:59.600 --> 1:47:01.600]  Or when he said, the press isn't reporting on all this
[1:47:01.600 --> 1:47:02.600]  Muslim terror.
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:05.600]  So then the press goes out there and starts listing,
[1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:06.600]  no, no, we did report on this.
[1:47:06.600 --> 1:47:07.600]  We did report on this bombing.
[1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:09.600]  We did report on this asset attack.
[1:47:09.600 --> 1:47:11.600]  The next thing you know, all the press is doing is talking
[1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:15.600]  about Muslim terror, and that ends up justifying his travel
[1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:16.600]  ban.
[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:19.600]  So every time you think he's made a move that seems like a
[1:47:19.600 --> 1:47:22.600]  blunder, you wait a couple weeks, as Steve Bannon told the
[1:47:22.600 --> 1:47:24.600]  press to do, just shut up and listen.
[1:47:24.600 --> 1:47:26.600]  And you see, Jesus, that was brilliant.
[1:47:26.600 --> 1:47:28.600]  You were four steps ahead of everyone.
[1:47:28.600 --> 1:47:32.600]  So this, what seems like a loss right now, I think if we just
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:35.600]  give it some time, we'll see he's going to turn it into yet
[1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:36.600]  another win.
[1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:37.600]  Devin McGinnis is our guest.
[1:47:37.600 --> 1:47:39.600]  People keep asking me, Alex, how do you predict what Trump's
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:41.600]  going to do before he does it?
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:42.600]  Because I've watched what he does.
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:43.600]  I've gotten into the mind frame.
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:44.600]  Plus, we're both Americana.
[1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:45.600]  We're all Americana.
[1:47:45.600 --> 1:47:46.600]  We're looking at the same journey.
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:48.600]  We're driving on the same road together.
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:50.600]  We're not telling each other what to think or do.
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:53.600]  We're seeing, as on its face, prima facie.
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:56.600]  And that's why I'm saying, very good chance, rinse
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:48:00.600]  previous within three weeks will be gone because he's
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:01.600]  clearly the leaker.
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:03.600]  He's clearly the one that continues to basically
[1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:05.600]  undermine the president and say that, you know, the
[1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:07.600]  president's like a, you know, lost child in the White
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:09.600]  House, all these leaks.
[1:48:09.600 --> 1:48:11.600]  And Trump's really upset about, I know for a fact, is
[1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:13.600]  looking for a new chief of staff.
[1:48:13.600 --> 1:48:14.600]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:17.600]  Monday, we're going to have the big story for everybody.
[1:48:17.600 --> 1:48:19.600]  So the good news is he's going to purge a lot of these
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:20.600]  people.
[1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:22.600]  The problem is, have you seen the State Department
[1:48:22.600 --> 1:48:23.600]  doubling the amount of refugees?
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:25.600]  That's supposedly Trump's State Department.
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:28.600]  They're now in revolt against their boss saying they're
[1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:30.600]  going to open the border up even more.
[1:48:30.600 --> 1:48:31.600]  This is crazy.
[1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:33.600]  Well, we knew draining the swamp wasn't going to be easy.
[1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:35.600]  We knew it wouldn't happen overnight.
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:38.600]  And there's obviously going to be people that are furious.
[1:48:38.600 --> 1:48:40.600]  I mean, everyone, Maggie Satcher came in and she just
[1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:43.600]  started chopping federal government jobs.
[1:48:43.600 --> 1:48:45.600]  She started chopping bureaucrats jobs.
[1:48:45.600 --> 1:48:47.600]  And everyone hated her because unemployment was going
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:49.600]  up, but unemployment was going up because she was
[1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:52.600]  getting rid of losers and privatizing all of Britain,
[1:48:52.600 --> 1:48:55.600]  creating a middle class for the first time in British
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:48:56.600]  history.
[1:48:56.600 --> 1:48:59.600]  So yeah, it's going to be a rocky beginning, but God,
[1:48:59.600 --> 1:49:01.600]  there's still so much winning in it.
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:02.600]  Isn't it fun?
[1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:04.600]  I mean, I don't, I was pretty young when Reagan was
[1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:07.600]  president, but I don't remember a presidency ever being
[1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:09.600]  so fun.
[1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:10.600]  Wow.
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:14.600]  Tell me about your view with the whole Hollywood
[1:49:14.600 --> 1:49:15.600]  bullying people.
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:17.600]  And like I mentioned, Katie Perry coming out and saying,
[1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:19.600]  let's organize physical attacks.
[1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:22.600]  It seems like Hollywood itself is even financially going
[1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:23.600]  bankrupt now.
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:25.600]  Communist China is coming in to buy it up.
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:27.600]  Where do you see Hollywood going?
[1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:29.600]  They have to comply to the free market.
[1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:31.600]  I mean, we saw American Sniper.
[1:49:31.600 --> 1:49:34.600]  Didn't it gross more movies, more money than all the
[1:49:34.600 --> 1:49:38.600]  other contestants for Academy Awards that year combined?
[1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:40.600]  So the free market wants guns.
[1:49:40.600 --> 1:49:41.600]  It wants Americana.
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:43.600]  It wants national pride.
[1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:44.600]  Look at Ghostbusters.
[1:49:44.600 --> 1:49:47.600]  Milo got banned for saying, I don't want to see a movie with
[1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:48.600]  a bunch of ugly chicks.
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:50.600]  And then they banned him for saying he doesn't like
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:51.600]  public figures.
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:53.600]  And then now that might bankrupt Sony.
[1:49:53.600 --> 1:49:55.600]  The movie lost so much money.
[1:49:55.600 --> 1:49:57.600]  But these people are court gestures.
[1:49:57.600 --> 1:50:00.600]  There's here to dance around for us and make us giggle.
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:03.600]  So if the king, which is the free market, tells you to
[1:50:03.600 --> 1:50:06.600]  stop dancing that way and go dance over there, they will
[1:50:06.600 --> 1:50:07.600]  comply.
[1:50:07.600 --> 1:50:11.600]  I mean, look at Amy Schumer bitching about guns.
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:13.600]  And then in her movie right now, she's got her gun out,
[1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:14.600]  shooting it everywhere.
[1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:15.600]  Matt Damon is the same way.
[1:50:15.600 --> 1:50:16.600]  Guns are evil.
[1:50:16.600 --> 1:50:17.600]  He's got a gun.
[1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:20.600]  Jim Carrey pretending he hates guns and he's shooting guns
[1:50:20.600 --> 1:50:22.600]  and kick ass two or three or whatever it is.
[1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:25.600]  They have to comply to the market because they have to pay
[1:50:25.600 --> 1:50:26.600]  for their divorce.
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:27.600]  They have to pay for their mortgage.
[1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:28.600]  And they're just posturing.
[1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:31.600]  This is the beauty of their side right now.
[1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:32.600]  It's all posturing.
[1:50:32.600 --> 1:50:35.600]  So it's like going to a Halloween party and going up to
[1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:37.600]  someone dressed as a pirate and saying, you want a sword fight
[1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:39.600]  and you bring out a real sword and they go, no, no, no,
[1:50:39.600 --> 1:50:40.600]  no, this is just plastic.
[1:50:40.600 --> 1:50:42.600]  You're all take it all off right now.
[1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:43.600]  It's getting.
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:46.600]  Let's talk about what happens next and how Trump defeats
[1:50:46.600 --> 1:50:49.600]  his biggest enemy, the GOP establishment, those WIMP
[1:50:49.600 --> 1:50:52.600]  conservatives you talked about that have been sabotaging
[1:50:52.600 --> 1:50:53.600]  the movement forever.
[1:50:53.600 --> 1:50:55.600]  How do we deal with them straight ahead?
[1:50:55.600 --> 1:50:58.600]  The folks trying to block the tax cut.
[1:51:25.600 --> 1:51:32.600]  Now's the time to refresh your home and save at Lumber

[1:51:59.600 --> 1:52:02.600]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are
[1:52:02.600 --> 1:52:05.600]  very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead,
[1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:08.600]  disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines,
[1:52:08.600 --> 1:52:12.600]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[1:52:12.600 --> 1:52:14.600]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter
[1:52:14.600 --> 1:52:16.600]  these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[1:54:28.600 --> 1:54:34.600]  The Russian's did it, but we joke about that.
[1:54:34.600 --> 1:54:37.600]  They're all over the place saying everybody is a Russian
[1:54:37.600 --> 1:54:40.600]  agent. The nationalist movement in Spain is Russian.
[1:54:40.600 --> 1:54:43.600]  The nationalist movement in Germany is Russian.
[1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:45.600]  Again, in France, it's Russian.
[1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:49.600]  At some point this has to run out of gas, but the Republican
[1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:54.600]  leadership goes along with it and keeps playing along with
[1:54:54.600 --> 1:54:55.600]  this.
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:55:00.520]  read in hundreds of newspapers where I'm supposedly a Russian agent. Now, I laugh at it, but it's
[1:55:00.520 --> 1:55:04.160]  not funny because some people still believe it. And I think our biggest problem is the,
[1:55:04.160 --> 1:55:08.200]  not against old people, but you know what I mean, the old mummy Republicans that are
[1:55:08.200 --> 1:55:13.400]  all part of the establishment. We need rock star, cool libertarian Republicans that are
[1:55:13.400 --> 1:55:17.960]  in there having a great time like Trump. But I see people still running from Trump when
[1:55:17.960 --> 1:55:23.680]  he's obviously the manifestation of the new wave of total victory, a total pull shift,
[1:55:23.680 --> 1:55:28.680]  a seismic shift. I mean, who is the biggest enemy in us, you know, completing our journey
[1:55:28.680 --> 1:55:31.960]  towards an absolutely open rock and roll society, Gavin?
[1:55:31.960 --> 1:55:38.000]  Well, the left clearly is the ones that are stopping us. And I think we also are our own
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:46.120]  worst enemy because of this ethnomasticism. White people, Americans, Westerners, we're
[1:55:46.120 --> 1:55:51.360]  the only culture that hates ourselves. You know, you don't have Japan coveching about
[1:55:51.360 --> 1:55:56.360]  the horrible things they did to the ANU when they were creating Japan. We don't hear Mexicans
[1:55:56.360 --> 1:56:00.760]  bitching about the horrible things they do to Guatemalan immigrants and immigrants from
[1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:06.040]  Panama. But for some reason, we just seem to thrive on self-hatred.
[1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:10.560]  And if I'm a Christian, but isn't that a twisted form of Christianity, you know, to kind of
[1:56:10.560 --> 1:56:15.200]  beat yourself and, and, and just feel guilty and, and, and, you know, it's like being obsessed
[1:56:15.200 --> 1:56:19.640]  with, you know, sexual repression of the kind of Elizabethan garbage.
[1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:23.920]  That's the million dollar question, the chicken or the egg. Did Christianity thrive? Because
[1:56:23.920 --> 1:56:30.160]  there's something genetically about us where we like self-flagellation. We like crucifying
[1:56:30.160 --> 1:56:35.600]  ourselves. Or did it come from Christianity? I don't know. All I know is that it's time
[1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:41.120]  has come because I never thought of myself as a white guy or a particularly Western male
[1:56:41.120 --> 1:56:44.920]  before I was told that I ruined the world. And then I went over to my computer and I
[1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:49.440]  looked up and they go, Oh, huh. It says here that we didn't start slavery. We ended it.
[1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:56.800]  And then I start to realize cement, electricity, infrastructure, roads, water. We're kind of
[1:56:56.800 --> 1:57:02.760]  great guys. Uh, you're wrong. And the irony too is we're the best for all these other
[1:57:02.760 --> 1:57:04.680]  people that are telling us we suck.
[1:57:04.680 --> 1:57:07.640]  But here's the deal. I'm not being politically correct. It's true. It's a bunch of white
[1:57:07.640 --> 1:57:12.800]  people telling us we're bad, who just want control and know that we're all into guilt.
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:17.080]  Yeah. Look at this show, Dear White People, that Netflix is putting out. It was written
[1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:23.680]  by white people and it's, it's got this incredibly patronizing tone. Like imagine your babysitter
[1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:28.080]  was talking to you like she's God and you just go, what the hell are you drunk? The
[1:57:28.080 --> 1:57:31.720]  way she talks, she says, here's the costumes you can wear.
[1:57:31.720 --> 1:57:34.960]  I'll tell you what, Gavin, we're back in one minute. I want to come back and play that
[1:57:34.960 --> 1:57:38.360]  and get your final take on that and then get into the whole Super Bowl thing more. But
[1:57:38.360 --> 1:57:44.720]  again, folks, it's the best website is compoundmedia.com, follow me at Gavin or McInnis on Twitter
[1:57:44.720 --> 1:57:47.880]  as well. We're going to go to break here in just one moment. Before I go any further,
[1:57:47.880 --> 1:57:53.520]  we fund ourselves not so much with sponsorships. The local stations do. And of course, the
[1:57:53.520 --> 1:57:58.600]  network does. But I fund the Info Wars News Center here in Austin, Texas, selling toothpaste.
[1:57:58.600 --> 1:58:02.000]  That's right. Right now, toothpaste is funding this operation that's changing the world.
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:05.800]  It's got iodine. It's got colloidal silver. It's made by the biggest manufacturer in the
[1:58:05.800 --> 1:58:10.760]  country that makes non, you know, GMO organic fluoride free toothpaste. This is our proprietary
[1:58:10.760 --> 1:58:15.080]  private label, but with added ingredients produced by the biggest company in the United
[1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:18.080]  States that puts up organic products. We can't say because it's a private label. That's
[1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:22.480]  how those contracts work. But it's got five star reviews. It's a game changer. Info Wars
[1:58:22.480 --> 1:58:28.160]  store.com. Info Wars live.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:58:28.160 --> 1:58:32.280]  And the more you fund us, the more you know, we will grow in the face of the globalists
[1:58:32.280 --> 1:58:37.240]  and stomp them into the dirt. Stay with us, spread the link. They're censoring us infowars.com
[1:58:37.240 --> 1:58:45.280]  and also spread compound media.com. Gavin McGinnis, five more minutes straight ahead.
[1:58:45.280 --> 1:58:50.040]  Visit GCN live.com today.
[1:58:50.040 --> 1:58:54.280]  The carbon tax has been pushed hard this week. James Baker, former White House chief of staff
[1:58:54.280 --> 1:58:58.600]  was running around doing interviews and speeches pushing the carbon tax in the name of saving
[1:58:58.600 --> 1:59:03.040]  the environment with his newly formed climate leadership council. Mitt Romney tweeted praise
[1:59:03.040 --> 1:59:07.760]  for the CLC's new carbon tax plan. Even Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has supported a carbon
[1:59:07.760 --> 1:59:11.480]  tax in the past. This tax would be terrible for the coal industry, which Trump voiced
[1:59:11.480 --> 1:59:15.920]  support of during his campaign. Don't be fooled by the suggested inner workings of this plan,
[1:59:15.920 --> 1:59:19.760]  which would sound good to the average show. This is merely a psychological tactic forcing
[1:59:19.760 --> 1:59:23.600]  the carbon tax into your subconscious so they can eventually ram it home. The government
[1:59:23.600 --> 1:59:28.160]  will never pay you any money from a carbon tax. This plan is a red herring. Bloomberg
[1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:31.640]  published a piece praising the carbon tax plan claiming it will save the world from
[1:59:31.640 --> 1:59:36.040]  climate change. Yes, the bureaucratic exchange of money will stop climate change. Give me
[1:59:36.040 --> 1:59:37.040]  a break.
[1:59:37.040 --> 1:59:40.640]  Really, this is a final attempt by the bought and paid for government to have say over who
[1:59:40.640 --> 1:59:45.520]  gets to make what and how much, essentially burying any free market competition in taxes
[1:59:45.520 --> 1:59:52.160]  and regulations. This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[1:59:52.160 --> 2:00:09.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:09.080 --> 2:00:15.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance from the front lines of
[2:00:15.400 --> 2:00:22.120]  the information war. It's Alex Jones and Gavin McGinnis. So here is the new Netflix series
[2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:26.760]  Dear White People. This isn't as condescending as the MTV deal that was similar saying whites
[2:00:26.760 --> 2:00:30.800]  are inherently evil. Only they can be racist. They are scum. And you're like, is this a
[2:00:30.800 --> 2:00:34.600]  joke trying to turn whites into racists? I think there's some of that too. It's just
[2:00:34.600 --> 2:00:38.320]  all balkanization, folks. We should really, really say no to it. But here's what Gavin
[2:00:38.320 --> 2:00:40.520]  was bringing up.
[2:00:40.520 --> 2:00:52.720]  Pirate, slutty nurse, any of our first 43 presidents, top of the list of unacceptable
[2:00:52.720 --> 2:01:03.000]  costumes. Me.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:07.760]  Dear White People, again, I mean, Gavin, it's the condescension. Do these people realize
[2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:11.400]  everything they're doing is blowing up in their face? Or is it just that old, weird,
[2:01:11.400 --> 2:01:17.160]  mentally ill hippies who are worth hundreds of millions in Hollywood are so guilt driven
[2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:20.400]  that they don't even know what they're doing. So they're doubling down on what they already
[2:01:20.400 --> 2:01:22.120]  did that blew them up.
[2:01:22.120 --> 2:01:28.480]  I don't know. I mean, my theory is that a lot of these TV execs are divorced women with
[2:01:28.480 --> 2:01:34.520]  an axe to grind. They're divorced liberal Democrats and they don't like men. They hate
[2:01:34.520 --> 2:01:38.400]  white men because it reminds them of their ex-husband. And they're just out for revenge.
[2:01:38.400 --> 2:01:42.400]  It's not the free market doesn't want that show. I mean, look at the number of dislikes
[2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:49.360]  that that trailer has on YouTube. It's something like 30,000 to 2,000 likes. It's probably
[2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:56.400]  the most rejected video in the history of YouTube trailers. And it's because it doesn't
[2:01:56.400 --> 2:02:00.640]  make sense. I mean, you're going to come to a party because you found the costumes offensive
[2:02:00.640 --> 2:02:05.280]  and you're going to destroy all our PA system. What's that 1500 bucks you just destroyed
[2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:09.480]  because you've described white people are really having blackface parties. I mean, I've
[2:02:09.480 --> 2:02:13.520]  never, I mean, I grew up in the South never heard of such a thing.
[2:02:13.520 --> 2:02:18.200]  It's probably happened six times in the past 10 years, but every time you see it, it gets
[2:02:18.200 --> 2:02:21.880]  blown up. It's all over the news. And the next thing you know, they're pretending that
[2:02:21.880 --> 2:02:22.880]  it's a trend.
[2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:25.840]  How do we know what is it left is doing false flags. They're always getting caught putting
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:31.680]  crosses in the yard or swastikas on the Jewish dorm. I mean, what 900 times out of out of
[2:02:31.680 --> 2:02:34.920]  a one. I mean, it's staged.
[2:02:34.920 --> 2:02:39.800]  And here's the other crazy thing no one would ever bring up. Blackface isn't offensive.
[2:02:39.800 --> 2:02:43.600]  It's just a given that it's offensive because it's related to Jim Crow. But if you go back
[2:02:43.600 --> 2:02:49.040]  and you look the way they did it in the 1800s, 20% of the time they were insulting. But the
[2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:53.520]  other 80% it was somewhat reverent. It was just like a man dressing up as a woman in
[2:02:53.520 --> 2:02:58.400]  a play. And then in Europe, we've got Black Pete and we've had the Black and White Minstrel
[2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:05.040]  show in Britain right up until the 80s. These people, all they know is the taboos and taking
[2:03:05.040 --> 2:03:06.040]  offense.
[2:03:06.040 --> 2:03:09.880]  And it's worse than you say, 275,000 plus dislikes.
[2:03:09.880 --> 2:03:16.800]  Yeah, I was 10 times off. I was saying it was a tenth of that. But here's the deal.
[2:03:16.800 --> 2:03:22.360]  If you're offended, it's beholden upon you to justify why you're offended and explain
[2:03:22.360 --> 2:03:23.360]  it to the rest of you.
[2:03:23.360 --> 2:03:26.160]  But Ron, though, you looked at it a few days ago. Now it's 10 times that.
[2:03:26.160 --> 2:03:31.200]  Yeah, I guess. Yeah, it'll be 10 times that soon too. I don't see this show airing. I
[2:03:31.200 --> 2:03:34.840]  mean, the vitriol behind it because I think Americans are sick of this.
[2:03:34.840 --> 2:03:38.680]  That's my next question. When do they figure out everything they're doing is making it
[2:03:38.680 --> 2:03:39.680]  worse for them?
[2:03:39.680 --> 2:03:45.080]  That's a good question because they just got Trump reelected. All these Antifa dudes
[2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:49.240]  in Berkeley and the guys pepper spraying me and the guys going up and grabbing MAGA hats
[2:03:49.240 --> 2:03:54.680]  and punching Nazis in the face, as they put it, just gets them reelected because we realized
[2:03:54.680 --> 2:04:00.080]  these spoiled brats are out of control, rolling a garbage into the street because you hate
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:04.520]  capitalism says to the rest of America, reelect Trump.
[2:04:04.520 --> 2:04:08.680]  And I mean, I'll eat my hat. I'll eat my MAGA hat if he doesn't win in 2020.
[2:04:08.680 --> 2:04:14.880]  Sure. Well, let's say killing. But I'm seeing mega massive amounts of quote minorities blowing
[2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:19.640]  up and saying, we're sick of all this race crap. We just want prosperity. Stop it.
[2:04:19.640 --> 2:04:24.400]  I mean, what was Obama? It was eight years of, okay, okay, I'm going to give you a chance.
[2:04:24.400 --> 2:04:28.680]  Here's your side of the argument. Go nuts. And then we look after eight years, the economies
[2:04:28.680 --> 2:04:35.000]  that had brutal recovery, worst recovery ever. We see way more racism. I mean, talking about
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:41.680]  white supremacy in Nazis, it sounds like it's 1945 again. He sent us back half a century.
[2:04:41.680 --> 2:04:46.720]  Well, he's on every day. It's of course, the website, compound media.com, Gavin McGinnis.
[2:04:46.720 --> 2:04:51.880]  I'm Alex shows Gavin. Thanks for joining us. And my kids say hi. You know, the 12 and 14
[2:04:51.880 --> 2:04:55.400]  year olds love you, but adults love you too. I just love the work you're doing. God bless
[2:04:55.400 --> 2:05:00.280]  you. We appreciate you. Thanks. You bet. Big guests coming up. Stay with us.
[2:05:00.280 --> 2:05:04.680]  First Trump submits a temporary travel ban, something legal and lawful done in the past
[2:05:04.680 --> 2:05:09.640]  based off Obama's list. Then the Democrats and media spin it protests ensue nationwide
[2:05:09.640 --> 2:05:15.000]  judges block it and Trump tweets, see you in court. Meanwhile, Steve Jern, a US Marine
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:19.520]  working in Iraq post a viral video explaining to people that if an American walks out on
[2:05:19.520 --> 2:05:24.600]  the streets in Iraq, he'd be scooped up and tortured. Then 15 hours later after that video
[2:05:24.600 --> 2:05:29.960]  gets viewed millions of times, he gets blocked on Facebook and is evacuated out of Iraq and
[2:05:29.960 --> 2:05:35.440]  sent back to America. Now hundreds of thousands of Iranians are rallying in the streets carrying
[2:05:35.440 --> 2:05:40.160]  signs and chanting death to America while a military police band plays revolutionary
[2:05:40.160 --> 2:05:44.760]  music getting hyped up over their enemy. Us. Let's not forget terrorists have been taking
[2:05:44.760 --> 2:05:49.640]  advantage of refugee programs for years and Assad has just said there are terrorists within
[2:05:49.640 --> 2:05:55.240]  the refugees. Are these judges not treasonous? You still want to protest the travel ban? This

[2:08:10.880 --> 2:08:25.880]  Shenzhou Abe is the prime minister of Japan. He met for hours with Trump a few months ago
[2:08:25.880 --> 2:08:30.480]  when he was just president elect. They talked about hugging each other in the big love fest.
[2:08:30.480 --> 2:08:35.240]  The Japanese, that's a big deal for Trump to talk like that. And the Japanese made basically
[2:08:35.240 --> 2:08:40.200]  behind the scenes deal. Little bird told me strategically the Pentagon already wanted
[2:08:40.200 --> 2:08:44.000]  for Japan to really link up with the United States against China, who is very expansionist
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:48.240]  right now, and with Russia behind the scenes and to bring down the EU that's basically
[2:08:48.240 --> 2:08:53.000]  a George Soros Rothschild Combine and to bring down globalism worldwide, go back to
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:59.080]  nation states and back to trading with each other and doing, you know, the individual
[2:08:59.080 --> 2:09:03.680]  trade deals, not the big blanket ones. Way of our rights. It's a very magic time right
[2:09:03.680 --> 2:09:09.240]  now. It's not the Trump's perfect. He's just not out to get us. And again, it looks like
[2:09:09.240 --> 2:09:14.440]  he's going back to old American plans. America was the cutting edge of all this. The Heritage
[2:09:14.440 --> 2:09:19.040]  Foundation, other neocon fake conservative groups go, Oh, us having no controls over
[2:09:19.040 --> 2:09:25.280]  trade is free trade, but everybody else gives us screw jobs. No, this is going to be reciprocal.
[2:09:25.280 --> 2:09:29.560]  This is going to be a two way street for everybody. This is the beginning of prosperity coming
[2:09:29.560 --> 2:09:34.520]  back. If we take it our hands, talk to Mr. Rappaport investigative journals about this
[2:09:34.520 --> 2:09:39.320]  at the moment and more. But first, since we mentioned it, here he is earlier with the
[2:09:39.320 --> 2:09:48.560]  Prime Minister, developed a great friendship when we met in New York City at Trump Tower.
[2:09:48.560 --> 2:09:54.040]  We spoke for a long, long period of time. And when I greeted him today at the car, I
[2:09:54.040 --> 2:10:00.400]  was saying I shook hands, but I grabbed him and hugged him because that's the way we feel.
[2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:06.000]  They have a very, very good bond, very, very good chemistry. I'll let you know if it changes,
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:11.680]  but I don't think it will. So I just want to, I just want to thank the Prime Minister for
[2:10:11.680 --> 2:10:16.440]  being here. We're going to be meeting your wife in a very short period of time. And I
[2:10:16.440 --> 2:10:21.280]  look very much forward to that. And I want to thank everybody in the room. We're going
[2:10:21.280 --> 2:10:28.080]  to have a tremendous relationship, long term relationship of mutual benefit with Japan.
[2:10:28.080 --> 2:10:31.160]  Thank you all very much. Thank you.
[2:10:31.160 --> 2:10:39.840]  See, folks, the globalist fear virile energy. They also fear the feminine energy, just the
[2:10:39.840 --> 2:10:46.120]  human energy. And they fear real bonds and real oaths. And everything is about playing
[2:10:46.120 --> 2:10:50.360]  us down, making us feel weak, making us feel like we're all robots. We're all programmable.
[2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:55.200]  We're all broken. We're all failed. But with Trump, especially in person, the magnetism
[2:10:55.200 --> 2:11:00.160]  is clear that he really does care about you and he cares about himself, but he's not going
[2:11:00.160 --> 2:11:04.600]  to be run over. He likes to dominate bad people. And that's why the leader is so scared of
[2:11:04.600 --> 2:11:05.600]  him.
[2:11:05.600 --> 2:11:10.320]  He doesn't care about special interest or money he's offered. He lost hundreds of millions
[2:11:10.320 --> 2:11:13.920]  of dollars just to run, just to pay for it himself. And Howard Stern says, well, Trump
[2:11:13.920 --> 2:11:18.160]  never told me this, but I think he just wanted to publicity stunt. No, he put his family
[2:11:18.160 --> 2:11:24.280]  and himself through hell and he's real and he's making alliances that are absolutely
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:25.280]  on target.
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:30.920]  And so this is an amazing time to be alive. And the Japanese absolutely sense it. They
[2:11:30.920 --> 2:11:38.400]  see it. And it's a genuineness too. It's not America lecturing Japan and telling Japan
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:42.760]  what to do after they were conquered in World War II. That's all over. That's why there
[2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:46.720]  were signals at Pearl Harbor not attacking Japan this year at the memorial, everything
[2:11:46.720 --> 2:11:53.160]  that's all done after 70 plus years. Okay, there's a whole new alliance. And I can see
[2:11:53.160 --> 2:11:57.560]  the alliance also know about the alliance because here's the deal. China had a deal
[2:11:57.560 --> 2:12:02.640]  to get all the industrial jobs, but none of the military. They broke their deal. They
[2:12:02.640 --> 2:12:06.400]  were given the Panama Canal, everything. So they broke their globalist deal and Trump's
[2:12:06.400 --> 2:12:10.880]  like, look, globalism is a double cross of America. I'm taking it over. I'm negotiating
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:14.880]  every other deal. Instead of America being disengaged, it's going to be more engaged
[2:12:14.880 --> 2:12:20.760]  now, but on a two way street, he's not going to do deals to exploit a third world country.
[2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:25.480]  He's going to do deals that raise their wages and raise ours. Actually, the original plan
[2:12:25.480 --> 2:12:30.320]  of globalism 60 years ago was sold as a plan to do that, but it was always a double cross.
[2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:33.800]  And Trump knows all this. Trump has been advised by the people that were there at the time
[2:12:33.800 --> 2:12:37.680]  it all happened. I'm going to leave it at that. But Nixon filled him out on the master
[2:12:37.680 --> 2:12:44.480]  plan in the 80s and the 90s. Roy Cohn figured, I mean, the new orders scared folks. They're
[2:12:44.480 --> 2:12:48.480]  really scared right now. Trump has the whole battle plan. He has all the generals around
[2:12:48.480 --> 2:12:52.680]  him. He's got the whole thing down. And it's an incredible time. I just wanted to have
[2:12:52.680 --> 2:12:58.600]  him on briefly because I want to put out as one piece. I think he broke it into yesterday.
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:03.600]  My fault. I had it broken into the hour that John Rabaport investigative journalist of
[2:13:03.600 --> 2:13:08.880]  no more fake news.com heard about that from him 15 years ago for the media called it that
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:13.280]  breaking down the big secret here that the colleges are meant to make you mentally ill
[2:13:13.280 --> 2:13:16.800]  meant to basically destroy your minds. He's put the pieces together. So I want to spend
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:22.840]  some time on that, but really just to direct you to the larger PC wrote for info wars.com.
[2:13:22.840 --> 2:13:26.080]  The number one mind control program at US colleges is that the whole thing is a mind
[2:13:26.080 --> 2:13:29.920]  control program. The unspoken secret plan in sight. If you're a college student or have
[2:13:29.920 --> 2:13:35.120]  a child at college, read this. This is why they seem like such closeted in my closet.
[2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:41.320]  I mean, never out of their closet. Gibbering scared of the sunlight people is because this
[2:13:41.320 --> 2:13:46.760]  is the model they want for all of us, the coffin apartments, the, the, the, the drugging,
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:51.720]  all of it. So I want to get into this briefly, the limited time we have with him. And then
[2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:54.960]  also, you know, put up on screen some of the videos from yesterday. In fact, I'm going
[2:13:54.960 --> 2:13:58.880]  to have them repost both pieces from the third hour yesterday or fourth hour and put that
[2:13:58.880 --> 2:14:03.640]  as a separate article with this on info wars because he really laid it all out in, in,
[2:14:03.640 --> 2:14:07.360]  in riveting fashion. It was kind of horrifying at the same time because I know all the stuff
[2:14:07.360 --> 2:14:11.640]  he's talking about. It's all true. But there is, is an investigative journalist putting
[2:14:11.640 --> 2:14:14.840]  all the pieces together. It's one thing to have all the pieces laid out and know they're
[2:14:14.840 --> 2:14:20.080]  all horrible, but he just put them all together yesterday. And it was just like very positive
[2:14:20.080 --> 2:14:24.560]  to know the plan, but also like, my God, it's even worse than I thought. It's so premeditated.
[2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:28.840]  It's an attempt to unconsciousness. So John, good to have you with us here briefly today.
[2:14:28.840 --> 2:14:32.160]  So much to get into with the whole state of the world, but briefly what you've discovered
[2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:36.040]  in a nutshell, kind of condensed that hour down yesterday into what, what the colleges
[2:14:36.040 --> 2:14:37.920]  really are.
[2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:43.160]  They're psychiatric clinics now, Alex. That's the deal. Because this statistic at the top
[2:14:43.160 --> 2:14:49.640]  of the article, 25% of all college students in America now have either been diagnosed
[2:14:49.640 --> 2:14:56.760]  with a mental disorder or treated for a mental disorder as a, as a total takeover. Because
[2:14:56.760 --> 2:15:03.080]  now you're talking about tremendously toxic drugs that caused violence, that caused people
[2:15:03.080 --> 2:15:09.800]  to be debilitated and confused and just out of their minds. Basically, that's psychiatry.
[2:15:09.800 --> 2:15:14.320]  That's what it is. I documented step by step in the article. So when these kids are now
[2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:19.560]  running around screaming, I'm triggered. I need to save space. That was a microaggressive.
[2:15:19.560 --> 2:15:22.440]  They're teaching them how to be gibbering idiot masqueraces.
[2:15:22.440 --> 2:15:30.040]  Yeah. And also the drugs are doing it to them because some of this is not these kids just,
[2:15:30.040 --> 2:15:35.040]  you know, adopting the role of a victim and saying, now I can just do anything I want
[2:15:35.040 --> 2:15:41.080]  to and everybody will take care of me. Some of it is the effects of the psychiatric drugs
[2:15:41.080 --> 2:15:46.200]  that they've been prescribed and are taking that just drive them nuts because that's what
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:52.800]  these drugs do. The kids were not nuts to begin with. They had problems. Problems studying.
[2:15:52.800 --> 2:15:53.800]  What about dating?
[2:15:53.800 --> 2:15:56.720]  But those are normal problems of development, as you point out.
[2:15:56.720 --> 2:16:01.720]  And you work your way through that or you talk to somebody who's smarter than you are
[2:16:01.720 --> 2:16:08.880]  and they help you along. But instead you wander into, you know, the counseling center and
[2:16:08.880 --> 2:16:15.720]  before you know it, somebody's diagnosed you as bipolar or clinical depression or ADHD
[2:16:15.720 --> 2:16:21.040]  and bang, bang, bang. You've got drugs and now you're in the system and now these kids
[2:16:21.040 --> 2:16:24.320]  don't know up from down. They're just driven crazy.
[2:16:24.320 --> 2:16:31.360]  But what it is, it's the George W. Bush bipartisan new freedom initiative of 2004, which seeks
[2:16:31.360 --> 2:16:37.840]  to put half the kids by 2020 are young people on psychotropic. This is the total Psyop takeover.
[2:16:37.840 --> 2:16:42.800]  That's right. It's also the brain initiative of Obama and starting all these new mental
[2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:49.160]  health clinics all over America. Yeah, empowering destruction. That's what this freedom initiative
[2:16:49.160 --> 2:16:54.800]  is all about. Of course Bush didn't have a clue himself, but he was guided through it
[2:16:54.800 --> 2:16:55.800]  by other people.
[2:16:55.800 --> 2:17:03.760]  Well, he himself now is reportedly just completely mentally ill, so yeah, exactly. Well, maybe
[2:17:03.760 --> 2:17:10.640]  he's on the drugs too. And in fact, you know, during my hour yesterday, the boys over there
[2:17:10.640 --> 2:17:17.360]  put up, you know, some really insane comments by congressional representatives in America,
[2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:23.320]  a little montage of all that. What are these people taking? I mean, we needed a count.
[2:17:23.320 --> 2:17:27.400]  Yeah, since when does it's not even an issue that the same press conference Bush is still
[2:17:27.400 --> 2:17:35.560]  president according to Pelosi and Waters. Trump helped Putin bomb Korea. I mean, these
[2:17:35.560 --> 2:17:37.000]  people are crazy.
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:41.840]  Yeah. So some of this might be the result of that. But the bottom line on the article
[2:17:41.840 --> 2:17:50.320]  in the investigation that I did is that psychiatry itself is an extension of the MK Ultra program,
[2:17:50.320 --> 2:17:51.320]  the CIA.
[2:17:51.320 --> 2:17:57.560]  It's just coming out all in the open and making it public. You've got 300 mental disorders
[2:17:57.560 --> 2:17:59.840]  listed in the psychiatric body.
[2:17:59.840 --> 2:18:03.880]  Yeah, they say if I oppose Obamacare because it's a ripoff written by insurance companies
[2:18:03.880 --> 2:18:11.440]  with death panels and IRS enforcement and penalties that I have this opposition to authority
[2:18:11.440 --> 2:18:12.440]  disorder.
[2:18:12.440 --> 2:18:17.880]  That's right. So if you were, you know, I don't know, somebody else before you knew
[2:18:17.880 --> 2:18:23.200]  it, you would be on these drugs and you would be diagnosed and you would be debilitated
[2:18:23.200 --> 2:18:29.200]  and you would be crazy. And then they would make more diagnoses and give you more drugs.
[2:18:29.200 --> 2:18:33.000]  And this gets tremendously heavy. I mean, we're talking about destruction of the country,
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:37.360]  folks, from the inside, by the way, let's go down to the really young kids. There was
[2:18:37.360 --> 2:18:42.080]  a top psychiatrist about four years ago came out and W.O.A.I. TV and radio was, it was
[2:18:42.080 --> 2:18:46.280]  a big in San Antonio and he said, listen, I'm doing this 20 years, we take perfectly
[2:18:46.280 --> 2:18:49.200]  healthy kids that are four or five years old, maybe their parents spanked them, might be
[2:18:49.200 --> 2:18:52.560]  bad parents, might have even beat them up or something. The point is, we put them on
[2:18:52.560 --> 2:18:55.880]  a couple of drugs, then they're on six, seven drugs and they're having seizures. And a
[2:18:55.880 --> 2:19:00.360]  few years later, they're dead from the drugs by the time they're 10 years old. The parents
[2:19:00.360 --> 2:19:04.200]  might have been bad parents and nobody debate their bad parents. The point is, is that you
[2:19:04.200 --> 2:19:07.800]  drug them so much, they're dead by the time they're 10 years old.
[2:19:07.800 --> 2:19:13.520]  Exactly. And now we're talking about the, you know, Risperdoll, the neuroleptics. They're
[2:19:13.520 --> 2:19:15.760]  also called major tranquilizers or anti-seizure.
[2:19:15.760 --> 2:19:20.760]  That's it. They're putting them on anti-seizure drugs now. It's so hardcore. Because the other
[2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:24.680]  cocktail gives them seizures. So now let's just totally drug them till they're taking,
[2:19:24.680 --> 2:19:27.920]  you know, stuff that literally eats your neurons.
[2:19:27.920 --> 2:19:32.360]  You know, it occurred to me that all this crazy stuff about zombies in America and that
[2:19:32.360 --> 2:19:37.880]  trend and how people are just so caught up in it and so forth, that this is kind of a
[2:19:37.880 --> 2:19:42.480]  description of what we're talking about here. Yeah. These people are making zombies. That's
[2:19:42.480 --> 2:19:46.800]  what they're doing. The psychiatrists. That's their job. That's what they do.
[2:19:46.800 --> 2:19:51.800]  And they're selling those of us that are still conscious to accept the new cultural meme
[2:19:51.800 --> 2:19:55.640]  that they're going to be zombies that have to be exterminated. So this is a mass culling
[2:19:55.640 --> 2:19:58.080]  being prepared as the military trains to kill zombies.

[2:24:08.280 --> 2:24:11.800]  John, I've got Nico and the crew saying, what do we call this segment? We put it on Facebook
[2:24:11.800 --> 2:24:18.120]  and YouTube and it's so big. I don't know what you call it. The truth about why colleges
[2:24:18.120 --> 2:24:23.360]  are falling apart. The truth about why colleges are creating mental patients. I mean, what
[2:24:23.360 --> 2:24:27.040]  do you call this? You've got all the documents in your article. It's admitted they're trying
[2:24:27.040 --> 2:24:31.520]  to create psychological basket cases to make us more manageable, but it actually creates
[2:24:31.520 --> 2:24:37.000]  the breakdown of society because now you've got a bunch of crazy people. I'm not saying
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:40.440]  every psychologist, psychiatrist is a bad person, but undoubtedly it's being used for
[2:24:40.440 --> 2:24:44.960]  social control just as it was in Russia or Nazi Germany. I mean, there's no doubt we're
[2:24:44.960 --> 2:24:50.240]  the most drugged, most psychiatrically controlled public in the world. Statistically, psychologists
[2:24:50.240 --> 2:24:53.800]  and psychiatrists have the highest levels of suicide and mental illness themselves.
[2:24:53.800 --> 2:24:58.200]  I mean, this is almost like a virus of insanity. Not letting people go through their rite of
[2:24:58.200 --> 2:24:59.200]  passages.
[2:24:59.200 --> 2:25:05.720]  That's right. Any time there's a slight bit of a problem, we've got to get diagnosed.
[2:25:05.720 --> 2:25:12.040]  And then, like I said at the top, these kids now have license to say, well, I'm a victim.
[2:25:12.040 --> 2:25:16.640]  So now I don't have to do well in school. Now I see why I was having problems with this,
[2:25:16.640 --> 2:25:22.320]  that and the other thing because I have this condition. And so now I'm a victim for the
[2:25:22.320 --> 2:25:27.840]  rest of my life. What a horrible thing to do to a kid and make them, you know, give them
[2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:31.240]  an out to the point where they don't have to deal with their own problems.
[2:25:31.240 --> 2:25:36.320]  So that's like these designations and diagnoses are like awards or something.
[2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:40.080]  That's right. They wear them like a badge of honor and they can share, well, what do
[2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:43.960]  you have? Well, this is what I have and that's what I'm taking. What are you taking?
[2:25:43.960 --> 2:25:48.160]  So when we were young, we had baseball cards and now you have the little mental illnesses.
[2:25:48.160 --> 2:25:53.120]  That's right. That's what you're trading with. And then, well, you think you've got a problem.
[2:25:53.120 --> 2:25:56.840]  You think you've got a Daryl Strawberry? Well, I got a Mickey Mantle.
[2:25:56.840 --> 2:26:02.400]  Exactly. My mental condition is much worse than yours because they have me on anti-psychotics,
[2:26:02.400 --> 2:26:10.240]  right? And somebody was just telling me yesterday a story about how, you know, somebody who
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:15.720]  started out in college with a few little problems about study ended up on several of these drugs.
[2:26:15.720 --> 2:26:19.480]  Oh, I know women that have a caesarean and then they try to put them on drugs. They're
[2:26:19.480 --> 2:26:22.000]  saying, you're going to be a little depressed because you can't walk around a lot for the
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:26.200]  next few weeks. How about this new drug where people are in a car wreck now and their back
[2:26:26.200 --> 2:26:28.920]  gets hurt and they go, how about some drugs?
[2:26:28.920 --> 2:26:34.200]  And then you get kids that absolutely can't study anymore. Now it's forget it because they're
[2:26:34.200 --> 2:26:38.680]  on these drugs. They're going up, they're going down, they're going sideways. Sometimes
[2:26:38.680 --> 2:26:43.360]  they're hallucinating and they're sitting with a book in the library. Forget it. So
[2:26:43.360 --> 2:26:47.320]  now they've got to look for something else. What group can I belong to? Can I throw a
[2:26:47.320 --> 2:26:52.720]  rock through a plate glass window? Is that going to get me any kind of status? Now you
[2:26:52.720 --> 2:27:02.000]  have an underlying force, a pharmaceutical force that's destroying the young of the country
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:08.800]  and giving rise to some of this completely insane behavior. That's where it is.
[2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:13.480]  I'm going to post your interview from yesterday or the hour you hosted infowars.com as one
[2:27:13.480 --> 2:27:17.000]  piece. What should we call it? Maybe the same as your headline, the number one mind control
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:20.680]  program that US colleges discovered? I mean, what do we call it?
[2:27:20.680 --> 2:27:25.840]  Yeah, that or how colleges are destroying your children's minds.
[2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:29.880]  Or like emergency report or like proof colleges ruining America.
[2:27:29.880 --> 2:27:33.520]  Yeah, and I'm not saying colleges weren't good or there aren't still some good degrees.
[2:27:33.520 --> 2:27:38.280]  It's just they are basket case facilities. They don't just teach basket weaving or have
[2:27:38.280 --> 2:27:41.560]  you go play with Play-Doh if you get see something you're upset by that they're literally
[2:27:41.560 --> 2:27:46.240]  arresting development and treating you like someone who's had a lobotomy.
[2:27:46.240 --> 2:27:53.080]  That's right. Or if you haven't, you'll soon need one. 25% remember this now. 25% of all
[2:27:53.080 --> 2:27:58.440]  college students in America have been diagnosed with a mental disorder or treated for a mental
[2:27:58.440 --> 2:28:03.520]  disorder. Like I said, now you're talking about universities
[2:28:03.520 --> 2:28:11.560]  and colleges that are pharmaceutically controlled. They are captives of the pharmaceutical cartel
[2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:16.360]  and they are all psychiatric clinics. That's what this has become.
[2:28:16.360 --> 2:28:20.240]  By the way, I mean, I've been inside the UT more secretive areas of the psychology department.
[2:28:20.240 --> 2:28:24.400]  That's admitted. They know that kids going to the school are just there to be processed
[2:28:24.400 --> 2:28:29.040]  and programmed and they don't have real degrees now. So all it is is like the football game.
[2:28:29.040 --> 2:28:33.800]  It's all just like a giant corporate brainwashing facility and the professors know that. It's
[2:28:33.800 --> 2:28:38.000]  what's crazy. I had a professor contact me and tell me
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:43.040]  after yesterday's show, absolutely right. This is what's happening. This is what's happening
[2:28:43.040 --> 2:28:49.320]  at his university and it's happening all over the country. So any parent out there, why
[2:28:49.320 --> 2:28:57.800]  you would want to send your kid to college where this is prevalent? I mean, why would
[2:28:57.800 --> 2:29:00.720]  you send your kid to a non-house? I've talked to people that have worked at the state hospital
[2:29:00.720 --> 2:29:04.880]  and stuff. My dad worked in his internship. You start feeling crazy when you've been there
[2:29:04.880 --> 2:29:09.280]  a few months yourself. And you look around and you see, go to a
[2:29:09.280 --> 2:29:14.600]  campus like you said, walk around, see what's happening. Look in the eyes of all these kids.
[2:29:14.600 --> 2:29:19.440]  What are you seeing? And then imagine that you're there for months or years. You don't
[2:29:19.440 --> 2:29:24.200]  even have to be diagnosed to feel like you're out of your mind because that's the environment
[2:29:24.200 --> 2:29:28.840]  you're in. Everybody's a psychiatric case. Well, I gotta say, because I've been to the
[2:29:28.840 --> 2:29:33.800]  university, it's almost, it's not a cliche. It's true. The Asians on average are almost
[2:29:33.800 --> 2:29:37.360]  like immune. They're just getting their scientific degree and ignoring everything else and getting
[2:29:37.360 --> 2:29:41.720]  out of there. John Rabaport, Nomarfakenews.com. Great job. We'll talk to you again soon.
[2:29:41.720 --> 2:29:46.360]  You report 12 pages of true, true divorce. Everybody should get it out today. The number
[2:29:46.360 --> 2:29:49.720]  one mind control program at U.S. colleges. Get this out to everybody you know who's in
[2:29:49.720 --> 2:29:53.160]  high school, their parents as well. We got Paul Watson coming up.
[2:29:53.160 --> 2:30:00.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.240 --> 2:30:03.440]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why
[2:30:03.440 --> 2:30:06.920]  is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the
[2:30:06.920 --> 2:30:12.400]  problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put
[2:30:12.400 --> 2:30:17.120]  toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with
[2:30:17.120 --> 2:30:22.720]  massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host
[2:30:22.720 --> 2:30:28.120]  mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around. We have biological
[2:30:28.120 --> 2:30:32.200]  warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff I said.
[2:30:32.200 --> 2:30:35.560]  There's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic
[2:30:35.560 --> 2:30:41.160]  clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a
[2:30:41.160 --> 2:30:42.680]  year. All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back
[2:30:42.680 --> 2:30:46.280]  in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense,

[2:33:13.800 --> 2:33:18.680]  All right, Paul has filed a really important report that I want to play here in a minute
[2:33:18.680 --> 2:33:22.840]  and break down. And then I want to hit a bunch of the news we haven't gotten to get on this Friday
[2:33:22.840 --> 2:33:28.360]  edition. I'll be back this Sunday, or willing, 4 to 6 p.m. Central. And I'll be following a
[2:33:28.360 --> 2:33:34.200]  bunch of special reports tomorrow. Tomorrow is my birthday. But I'm going to be spending my
[2:33:34.200 --> 2:33:41.480]  birthday because that's what I want to do, working from about 9 a.m. to about 3 p.m. And then I'm
[2:33:41.480 --> 2:33:46.360]  going to go back and celebrate my birthday and my youngest daughter's birthday that comes pretty
[2:33:46.360 --> 2:33:50.920]  close to mine. And I don't say that to act tough or cool or say, oh, you worked so hard. I mean,
[2:33:50.920 --> 2:33:57.400]  that's my birthday. That's what I want is to battle the globalist. I want to file a special report
[2:33:58.760 --> 2:34:02.440]  that's going to be airing on Monday when we announce big news about treasonous operatives
[2:34:02.440 --> 2:34:07.320]  inside the Trump White House and get the president's attention and try to really do this country in
[2:34:07.320 --> 2:34:14.360]  the world of big service. So, you know, these are big things. These are, I mean, look, the Super Bowl
[2:34:14.360 --> 2:34:19.160]  makes billions of dollars. But in the future of the country, we do things here on a monthly basis
[2:34:19.160 --> 2:34:23.960]  that are bigger for the future of humanity than the Super Bowl. I mean, really, that's why I take
[2:34:23.960 --> 2:34:30.600]  it real serious. I'm mad at myself that I haven't succeeded enough. I have nightmares about it and
[2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:36.360]  be like, oh, man, you've done so much. No. That's it. See, that's an example of will.
[2:34:38.840 --> 2:34:42.760]  I've got the will and you've got the will to defeat these tyrants. Our will is greater than
[2:34:42.760 --> 2:34:47.800]  theirs, but we have to put it into action. We have to take action. We have to be, you know, heads up
[2:34:47.800 --> 2:34:56.760]  about what we're doing. And I think about the fact, you know, I've gotten this level of understanding
[2:34:56.760 --> 2:35:02.120]  and it's just exponential. This is such an animating contest that we're involved in.
[2:35:02.840 --> 2:35:07.720]  So, on the air polls, report in a moment. First off though, I want to really thank all the listeners
[2:35:07.720 --> 2:35:11.960]  and viewers for your support, but you're getting things you need. Water filtration systems are
[2:35:11.960 --> 2:35:17.800]  the best out there at the lowest prices. You're getting, you know, t-shirts that spread the word
[2:35:17.800 --> 2:35:22.360]  and help you meet like-minded people. You're getting really high quality supplements and things like
[2:35:22.360 --> 2:35:27.160]  that. And I'm going to play a clip in a moment that's particularly powerful. It's a shorter clip,
[2:35:27.160 --> 2:35:31.720]  the long clips up on infowars.com with that Shia Labouf or wherever you say his name.
[2:35:32.600 --> 2:35:38.200]  There's so many drugs being used and attacks and everything. The museum has shut down his
[2:35:38.200 --> 2:35:42.760]  live feed after I guess a month or so of it being up, but before it got shut down, the real reason
[2:35:42.760 --> 2:35:49.160]  they got shut down is people are showing up locals and rebuking the whole propaganda situation. So,
[2:35:49.160 --> 2:35:55.160]  that's coming up here in just a moment as well. But super blue is super high quality, organic,
[2:35:55.160 --> 2:36:01.880]  non-fluoride toothpaste made in America by the top brand name, uh, non-fluoride toothpaste. Everybody
[2:36:01.880 --> 2:36:06.920]  knows the name. But frankly, it's the group that makes it for the folks that are up in Maine,
[2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:14.680]  and everywhere else. Uh, but we add iodine and nano silver to the peppermint and tea tree oil.
[2:36:15.240 --> 2:36:18.040]  We have a children's coming out that doesn't have the peppermint because that's a little strong for
[2:36:18.040 --> 2:36:22.680]  kids. Bubblegum flavors should be here in about a month, but I doubled the amount the first run
[2:36:22.680 --> 2:36:26.040]  thinking, oh, well, the first runs while we sold out of it in a week. Well, I guess you love it.
[2:36:26.040 --> 2:36:30.360]  And people are looking for this. So thank God we've got a way to fund our operation and get
[2:36:30.360 --> 2:36:34.040]  things out to people that really help them. This is an amazing toothpaste with iodine and
[2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:38.520]  colloidal silver do for your gums along with peppermint and tea tree oil and other things.
[2:36:38.520 --> 2:36:44.760]  Go read the five star reviews and info or store.com or enforce life.com takes you right to the
[2:36:44.760 --> 2:36:50.440]  supplement page or call toll three, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And
[2:36:50.440 --> 2:36:55.400]  again, read those reviews that they were just putting some on screen for TV viewers. It's amazing.
[2:36:56.680 --> 2:37:01.480]  Separately, you need DNA force. You need bio tricillinium. You need biome defense probiotic.
[2:37:01.480 --> 2:37:07.080]  We've got the best or knock out our sleep formula or winter sun or super mill vitality or brain
[2:37:07.080 --> 2:37:13.640]  force or living defense parasite cleanse or bio PCA for skin hair and nails or vitamin mineral
[2:37:13.640 --> 2:37:20.280]  fruit punch fusion with amino acids or lung cleanse. These are all are anthroplex or liver
[2:37:20.280 --> 2:37:25.480]  shield or oxy powder or bone and joint formula or prostagard. Take prostagard.
[2:37:25.480 --> 2:37:32.520]  It's saw palm metal at the recommended dose organic at $20 less than what you hear advertised on
[2:37:32.520 --> 2:37:36.920]  radio everywhere with the same dose of saw palm metal. And then we add what eight other things
[2:37:36.920 --> 2:37:42.680]  organic known to help not just your prostate, but other glands. The leading competitor you hear
[2:37:42.680 --> 2:37:50.680]  is like 40 bucks on radio. This is half that price and has the same dose of just the saw palm
[2:37:50.680 --> 2:37:55.640]  metal. That's one of the things that the government even lets you say is good for the prostate saw
[2:37:55.640 --> 2:38:00.840]  palm metal has been proven to help your prostate and overall health. And it's got a bunch of other
[2:38:00.840 --> 2:38:06.920]  stuff in it as well. Other thing we can make claims on is DNA force, the bio PQQ 170 plus studies,
[2:38:06.920 --> 2:38:12.280]  nerve regrowth, you name it. If you've got the money, some of our stuff's like 995 because it's
[2:38:12.280 --> 2:38:16.120]  a great low cost herb. We give you the best boom. There it is. If something's expensive, it is
[2:38:16.120 --> 2:38:20.920]  you know, 120 something bucks for DNA force. Right now it's not discount. It's 134. Well,
[2:38:20.920 --> 2:38:25.640]  I mean, just one ingredients costing like $50 a bottle, the bio PQQ. We've got the real bio
[2:38:25.640 --> 2:38:30.600]  PQQ from the Japanese here in the US, Miss Abishi America. Nobody else has got it. Folks,
[2:38:30.600 --> 2:38:35.960]  I've been to Whole Foods. I go through there. They got this bio PQQ that bio PQQ. It's not even real
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:43.960]  from our research. This is the bio PQQ and it's like 40 50 bucks for the fake synthetic stuff
[2:38:43.960 --> 2:38:50.520]  at a low lower dose. You understand? And that's just one of the things that's in DNA force.
[2:38:51.960 --> 2:38:54.840]  That's why it's expensive because it's the real deal.
[2:38:56.840 --> 2:39:02.600]  Bio PQQ is found in comets. By the way, it's stardust. It's magic stuff. So check it out
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:06.840]  infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. I want to think
[2:39:08.120 --> 2:39:12.360]  MSNBC, CNN, the New York Times, Washington Post, and over a thousand other publications
[2:39:12.360 --> 2:39:17.000]  for attacking our supplements. We have computer graphs showing it. You don't have big audiences,
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:21.080]  but one thing liberals are right about is supplements. So they know how good they are.
[2:39:21.080 --> 2:39:25.400]  They go look up our stuff and go, man, that's a great brand. That's a great lung cleanse. That's
[2:39:25.400 --> 2:39:30.200]  a great iodine. I remember good liberals, you know, at Barton Springs like 20 years ago going,
[2:39:30.200 --> 2:39:33.720]  Alex, what are you drinking that water jug? Oh, it's so good for you. You know,
[2:39:33.720 --> 2:39:37.240]  the guy's some Olympic swimmer who's like an anti-war hippie. That's a real liberal,
[2:39:37.240 --> 2:39:43.400]  not you, you know, the fascist if you're watching laughing. And they're the reason we were so successful
[2:39:44.600 --> 2:39:49.400]  is just researching what liberals wanted. So they actually, the last three or four years
[2:39:49.400 --> 2:39:55.960]  attacking our supplements grew our market share like 30%. I mean, a big part of funding
[2:39:55.960 --> 2:40:02.040]  new studios and more crew was the media because we can watch it in the graph attacking us. We,
[2:40:02.040 --> 2:40:08.760]  we, they actually gave us their viewers who happen to be folks that are right about supplements.
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:12.760]  They're wrong about a lot of other stuff, but liberals are like, we don't want radiation.
[2:40:12.760 --> 2:40:16.280]  You know, we don't, we don't want fluoride. We don't want GMO. We don't want glyphosate.
[2:40:16.280 --> 2:40:21.000]  Well, I'm, I'm, I'm right with you because the studies are clear. You're right. Roundup ain't
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:26.920]  good for you. It'll give you breast cancer, disticular cancer. It's bad. It'll kill you.
[2:40:26.920 --> 2:40:32.200]  So, you know, we've got no supplements that are known to strip that out of the body.
[2:40:36.600 --> 2:40:42.440]  It's just crazy. It's crazy how they've done these big month-long jags attacking us. Look,
[2:40:42.440 --> 2:40:46.680]  they sell snake oil and they go, oh, Alex shows us the snake oil salesman. And then everybody knows
[2:40:47.800 --> 2:40:51.720]  that this isn't the Rockefellers that they were snake oil salesmen that would sell heroin
[2:40:51.720 --> 2:40:55.720]  in bottles and say, this will cure you of a headache. This will cure you of depression.
[2:40:55.720 --> 2:40:59.640]  Well, of course it will. You drink heroin, you're going to be laid out for five hours.
[2:40:59.640 --> 2:41:02.680]  We don't sell heroin. Snake oil was heroin.
[2:41:05.160 --> 2:41:09.080]  But I love how people we're fighting got in power selling snake oil and we're just selling good
[2:41:09.080 --> 2:41:13.320]  old fashioned high quality supplements. Mother nature. There's studies out about cancer lowering
[2:41:13.320 --> 2:41:17.640]  when you take one aspirin a day and heart disease. Everybody knows that. Aspirin's an incredible drug
[2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:26.760]  like marijuana. It's an incredible plant. I don't sell an aspirin drug. We probably should. But the
[2:41:26.760 --> 2:41:33.400]  point I'm getting at here is these plants have values. And so thank you all for your support.
[2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:37.960]  Just briefly and then I'm going to get to this other report and then I come back into that
[2:41:37.960 --> 2:41:44.520]  fellow there at the Shia LaBeouf facility. Solutions from Science has the next generation

[2:42:11.960 --> 2:42:18.920]  one says. So find privatepowergrid.com. They'll find out about that today. We're about to end
[2:42:18.920 --> 2:42:26.120]  a special 10% off as well on the secret 12, Methylcopolamine, vitamin B12 under the tongue.
[2:42:26.680 --> 2:42:33.080]  And we are also 20% on Roger Stone's book. Oh, that's a side issue. Roger, two weeks ago when
[2:42:33.080 --> 2:42:38.040]  the book came out announced, I'm going to sign all the books that Alex sells. And then we've
[2:42:38.040 --> 2:42:42.200]  been waiting for him to send us stuff. We got a few thousand signatures, thousands more are coming.
[2:42:42.200 --> 2:42:45.720]  And so we got like 10,000 people saying, I want my book right now. It's the announcement right
[2:42:45.720 --> 2:42:49.240]  now. We're all about shipping you stuff next day. But what I'm dealing with somebody else,
[2:42:49.240 --> 2:42:52.280]  we can't do that. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to mail everybody the book
[2:42:52.840 --> 2:42:57.720]  for the next two days. And then if you're really upset and you want the signature,
[2:42:57.720 --> 2:43:01.800]  we won't, when it comes in, we'll mail you that to stick in the book. And we're sending everybody
[2:43:01.800 --> 2:43:09.240]  that ordered the book, a 15% promo code off stuff as well. Because people are like next day
[2:43:09.240 --> 2:43:12.680]  delivery. They want it. We love you. We appreciate you're getting a piece of history. But I'm not
[2:43:12.680 --> 2:43:16.040]  mad at Roger, but that's how that train wreck started. We've learned not to do those train
[2:43:16.040 --> 2:43:20.040]  wrecks here, you know, shipping stuff for 20 years. But that's going on with the book. It's
[2:43:20.040 --> 2:43:24.360]  very popular. And so I'm just saying now, all future books are not going to be signed by me.
[2:43:24.360 --> 2:43:28.520]  Everything previous, if you want to sign plate, you'll get it. But who cares? You want the book.
[2:43:28.520 --> 2:43:38.760]  Now, speaking of plugging, and then I'm going to finish up, the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:43:40.200 --> 2:43:45.240]  And there's like a six minute video that's gone super viral that Milo put out millions of years
[2:43:46.040 --> 2:43:51.240]  of a black man in New York, going up to the Shia LaBeouf video camera that got shut down now
[2:43:51.240 --> 2:43:56.600]  because of violence and saying the answer in 1984 1776. But you read the quotes of what he said,
[2:43:56.600 --> 2:44:01.880]  it's powerful in the transcripts up on info wars.com. And he's sporting the shirt, which I
[2:44:01.880 --> 2:44:06.120]  designed six, seven years ago. And it's not even one of our best sellers. It should be. It's one
[2:44:06.120 --> 2:44:13.320]  of my favorites. That says the answer to 1984 1776. And that explains it all the answer to the
[2:44:13.320 --> 2:44:19.560]  1984 society. On the back, it says info wars.com, a great shirt. And I want this gentleman to reach
[2:44:19.560 --> 2:44:24.040]  out to us. We'd like to get him on as a guest. So please, sir, show tips info wars.com. Please
[2:44:24.040 --> 2:44:28.360]  contact us. We'd love to have you on the show and send you all the t-shirts you never want.
[2:44:29.080 --> 2:44:35.560]  But man, he tears them up. Now he exposes the whole thing, but here's just part of where he
[2:44:36.680 --> 2:44:40.120]  and the two liberals there can't even talk. They're not talking before he even shows up.
[2:44:40.680 --> 2:44:48.600]  So here it is. I'm sick of this. He's not dividing us. This is propaganda.
[2:44:48.600 --> 2:45:01.640]  Edward Bernays. Read the book. Read it. Edward Bernays. Propaganda. 101. I'm tired of it.
[2:45:02.440 --> 2:45:07.560]  I love America. You got that? I love America.
[2:45:07.560 --> 2:45:18.600]  And I appreciate a point of opposite views. That's what this country's about.
[2:45:20.440 --> 2:45:27.880]  Opposite views. You don't live under totalitarian where they tell you how to think.
[2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:37.960]  This is not 1984. It's 1776. Worldwide.
[2:45:39.720 --> 2:45:49.960]  Get used to it. You Berkeley anarchists. You are stoned. Just like Black Lives Matter.
[2:45:50.600 --> 2:45:53.800]  You got that? All lives matter.
[2:45:53.800 --> 2:45:59.800]  Yeah. You know, we've got ourselves put the whole speech up. That guy's all just on target.
[2:45:59.800 --> 2:46:05.320]  And it's beautiful. It's just crazy. It's like you ever heard of other views? Like if they were
[2:46:05.320 --> 2:46:10.040]  arresting liberal filmmakers, I'd be totally freaked out. I supported Michael Moore in his
[2:46:10.040 --> 2:46:16.200]  film, Exposing Bush in the War. And then he's just like, oh yeah, you know, and the young
[2:46:16.200 --> 2:46:23.640]  Turks are like arguing for the arrest of, you know, the filmmaker that made America 2016,
[2:46:23.640 --> 2:46:28.440]  Dinesh Ysouza. I mean, I've seen like hour-long debates with him in the Turks when they're
[2:46:28.440 --> 2:46:32.360]  like calling him a criminal and stuff. It's like, he's got five of his friends that donate to his
[2:46:32.360 --> 2:46:37.880]  friend to run for Senate, which isn't even illegal. He didn't sign the paperwork. It's sick.
[2:46:40.200 --> 2:46:45.000]  So personally, that's my favorite shirt other than mass murders, the Greek un-control works.
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:48.280]  And it's never been a big seller. I wish listeners would make it a big-head shirt.
[2:46:50.520 --> 2:46:53.000]  It just, it says it all. People are going to ask you, well, what's that mean?
[2:46:54.200 --> 2:47:02.040]  Well, the answer to 1974, 1776. I mean, the answer to 1984 world is freedom. It doesn't mean 1776
[2:47:02.040 --> 2:47:08.360]  was perfect, but it meant we were trying to do something. And man, I know people, look, Trump
[2:47:08.360 --> 2:47:13.320]  just wants wealth. Trump wants to make you rich. The globalists think you're trash, and I think
[2:47:13.320 --> 2:47:21.560]  you deserve it. They want to make you poor. They say that in their own reports. That's what's so
[2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:31.960]  frustrating. It hurts me to see this type of racism being created because I'm tired of people
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:37.560]  that are praying on folks getting away with stuff like this. People that are trying to start a war
[2:47:37.560 --> 2:47:44.440]  with Russia, trying to say that, you know, I started getting tears in my eyes because I'm
[2:47:44.440 --> 2:47:48.360]  scared of losing all these people. I hate con artists and scumbags. I mean, I'll be honest,
[2:47:48.360 --> 2:47:53.480]  we don't want to break their necks. And not to some wish for violence just because I'm tired
[2:47:53.480 --> 2:47:57.720]  of being pushed around and seeing innocent people get chewed up. Humanity can do anything,
[2:47:57.720 --> 2:48:03.480]  but we've got to start letting people go through experiences, letting people go through crises,
[2:48:03.480 --> 2:48:07.240]  and learning to just deal with each other and not have some big nanny state that they have a
[2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:11.720]  stopping all these problems because all it's meant to do is make the problems worse. Now,
[2:48:11.720 --> 2:48:15.480]  I want to say something at the intro of this Paul Watson video that's extremely powerful
[2:48:15.480 --> 2:48:21.880]  and is entitled. I want to say something at the start of this extremely important Paul Watson
[2:48:21.880 --> 2:48:29.160]  report he's put out, this title, conservatism is the new counterculture. And I want to point out
[2:48:29.160 --> 2:48:37.640]  here that Paul could have gone further in his report show how modern conservatism is the answer
[2:48:37.640 --> 2:48:44.520]  to the establishment liberalism by showing the numbers of when I checked two days ago, Paul
[2:48:45.160 --> 2:48:50.440]  on his Facebook, my Facebook and our YouTubes had had 18 million plus views.
[2:48:50.440 --> 2:48:57.880]  We had had all of us together at M4 Wars on top of that another 20 something million.
[2:48:59.560 --> 2:49:06.440]  That's close to 40 million views separate from terrestrial radio and everything else we're
[2:49:06.440 --> 2:49:10.840]  doing. I mean, that's nobody does that week after week. We're doing it.
[2:49:13.240 --> 2:49:18.680]  Paul Watson gets more views than Gavin McGinnis, Milo and everybody else combined.
[2:49:18.680 --> 2:49:22.520]  I'm not in competition with them. I love the fact they're viral and my kids listen to them and
[2:49:22.520 --> 2:49:27.480]  people are waking up. The point is, is that M4 Wars is a wrecking ball to the globalist.
[2:49:31.320 --> 2:49:34.840]  Yeah, that's just Paul's YouTube, I think. Go to his Facebook, go to my Facebook.
[2:49:34.840 --> 2:49:38.840]  He's got one video with 11 million views, one with 5 million, one with 4 million.
[2:49:38.840 --> 2:49:42.440]  We do that. I think it's like actually 19 million now. The point is, is that
[2:49:42.440 --> 2:49:49.720]  we are dominating these people, but I think to use the term conservative is not even right.
[2:49:49.720 --> 2:49:53.080]  It's just free thinkers. Let's go to the special report here at us.
[2:49:54.040 --> 2:49:59.240]  Having lost the political argument, leftists are desperately clinging to this idea that they have
[2:49:59.240 --> 2:50:05.800]  the monopoly on cool and that no counter-cultural movement could ever be created by the right.
[2:50:05.800 --> 2:50:12.360]  In fact, I've never seen so many members of the lefty Twitter arty so triggered as when I tweeted
[2:50:12.360 --> 2:50:22.680]  conservatism is the new counter-culture. So I tweeted it again and again and again and again
[2:50:22.680 --> 2:50:27.480]  and again. I'm triggered. Seriously, I know the word triggered gets overused now, but this was a
[2:50:27.480 --> 2:50:33.560]  deluge of butthurt. What are they so afraid of? Well, as Breitbart said, politics is downstream
[2:50:33.560 --> 2:50:38.440]  from culture. Most young people who aren't paying attention to the news get their opinions from
[2:50:38.440 --> 2:50:43.240]  celebrities. Hollywood and the entertainment industry viciously polices the boundaries of
[2:50:43.240 --> 2:50:49.880]  accepted opinion so that anyone who strays from the leftist orthodoxy is ostracized and excommunicated.
[2:50:49.880 --> 2:50:55.880]  They're all for diversity until it comes to diversity of thought. And that's why celebrities
[2:50:55.880 --> 2:51:01.880]  are so fucking boring. None of them dare express an original opinion, because if they did, they'd
[2:51:01.880 --> 2:51:07.400]  be hounded out of a career by their intolerant peers. I mean, look at Eminem. He used to be happy
[2:51:07.400 --> 2:51:13.480]  to offend absolutely everyone. Christians, lesbians, feminists, the gay lobby. Now he's calling
[2:51:13.480 --> 2:51:20.200]  Donald Trump a bitch. Oh, how daring. That's so controversial. I mean, it's not like every
[2:51:20.200 --> 2:51:25.880]  other virtue signaling quat in Hollywood and the music industry is doing exactly the same thing,
[2:51:25.880 --> 2:51:31.240]  is it? But the left is starting to lose their omnipotent control of counter-culture. Why?
[2:51:31.240 --> 2:51:37.000]  Well, counterculture used to be intrinsically leftist because the right had political power.
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:43.320]  It was a natural counterbalance. But up until very recently, the right had been getting its ass
[2:51:43.320 --> 2:51:49.640]  kicked in the culture war for decades. So now we have a whole new generation emerging who have no
[2:51:49.640 --> 2:51:55.880]  memory whatsoever of the right being in political power or having any dominance in the culture
[2:51:55.880 --> 2:52:01.640]  war. All they've experienced is the left's total domination of the culture war and their intellectual
[2:52:01.640 --> 2:52:06.120]  intolerance of anyone who goes against the grain. So for teenagers and 20-somethings,
[2:52:06.120 --> 2:52:12.600]  all they've ever known is having dominant culture fed to them by the left. So it comes down to this.
[2:52:12.600 --> 2:52:18.760]  You can't be the dominant culture and the counterculture. That's why conservatism or a
[2:52:18.760 --> 2:52:24.200]  particular brand of it is becoming the new counterculture. It's a natural progression. And you
[2:52:24.200 --> 2:52:29.960]  can see this new phenomenon beginning to emerge when you look at Generation Z. Teenagers born
[2:52:29.960 --> 2:52:36.760]  after the year 2000 and the most conservative generation since World War II. 14% of 14 and
[2:52:36.760 --> 2:52:43.560]  15-year-olds said they had a conservative outlook compared to 2% of millennials and just 1% of Gen
[2:52:43.560 --> 2:52:49.720]  Xers. That's a huge difference, and it's only going to grow. We're red-pilling. Generation Z.
[2:52:49.720 --> 2:52:56.040]  The tsunami of positive messages I get from teenagers every single day telling me about how
[2:52:56.040 --> 2:53:00.920]  it was my videos that turned them from being a social justice warrior, a Black Lives Matter
[2:53:00.920 --> 2:53:06.600]  supporter to becoming a conservative is staggering. They're sick to the back teeth of being forced
[2:53:06.600 --> 2:53:12.520]  to sit in classes about gender studies or colonialism and brow-beaten about their original
[2:53:12.520 --> 2:53:18.040]  sin of being male, being white, or being a Westerner. Young people are rebelling against this
[2:53:18.040 --> 2:53:25.880]  stifling safe space trigger warning PC attitude in droves. Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[2:53:25.880 --> 2:53:31.720]  Why? Because progressives are the new puritans. They're completely joyless and authoritarian.
[2:53:31.720 --> 2:53:37.960]  In the 1970s, the Christian Right protested to try and shut down sex pistols concerts.
[2:53:37.960 --> 2:53:43.640]  They called on radio stations, venues, and TV networks to no platform the pistols because
[2:53:43.640 --> 2:53:51.560]  they found them offensive. No, no. What was the rule? In 2017, it's the politically correct,
[2:53:51.560 --> 2:53:58.920]  obsessed left that campaigns and riots to no platform and shut down conservatives for being
[2:53:58.920 --> 2:54:05.000]  offensive. The right-wing temper tantrum over the sex pistols back in the 70s only made the
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:10.760]  pistols more taboo, more avant-garde, and therefore more counterculture. And we're seeing the same
[2:54:10.760 --> 2:54:17.560]  effect now only in reverse. What happened after the Berkeley riots? Milo's book sales surged by
[2:54:17.560 --> 2:54:23.880]  over 12,000 percent, with the book having already skyrocketed to number one on Amazon because
[2:54:23.880 --> 2:54:30.760]  the left had a temper tantrum. Your joyless, sensorious, puritanical persecution of Milo
[2:54:30.760 --> 2:54:37.560]  is exactly what's turned him into a complete rock star. After his Twitter ban, Milo became more
[2:54:37.560 --> 2:54:43.480]  counterculture than ever before because Silicon Valley doesn't represent the counterculture.
[2:54:43.480 --> 2:54:50.680]  It's been in place so long now that it's the new establishment. Conservatism is the new punk rock.
[2:54:50.680 --> 2:54:55.720]  And you've only got yourselves to blame. You complete idiots. And obviously I don't mean
[2:54:55.720 --> 2:55:01.480]  conservatism like Mitch McConnell conservatism. I'm not talking about old establishment Republicans.
[2:55:01.480 --> 2:55:06.200]  If you prefer, you can think of it as cultural libertarianism. But whatever you want to call it,
[2:55:06.200 --> 2:55:11.960]  this is the new counterculture. Everything that the left had has gone completely stagnant.
[2:55:11.960 --> 2:55:17.160]  This is the only countercultural movement that's definable, that's going anywhere,
[2:55:17.160 --> 2:55:22.520]  that resonates with anyone. And that's why the regressive left is terrified.
[2:55:22.520 --> 2:55:27.880]  Oh yeah, and don't come at me with a bunch of obscure movements within music or popular culture
[2:55:27.880 --> 2:55:34.360]  to try and debunk me, okay? Barely anyone has ever heard of those movements where the ones who
[2:55:34.360 --> 2:55:39.320]  are resonating. The other thing is, I don't know what it is about this profile image,
[2:55:39.320 --> 2:55:44.760]  but it triggers the holy hell out of leftists. I was actually going to change it for 2017,
[2:55:44.760 --> 2:55:49.880]  but after I saw how much they can't stand it, I'm keeping it forever.
[2:55:56.520 --> 2:56:00.760]  I also made it more triggering by adding Trump in an executive order that says
[2:56:00.760 --> 2:56:05.320]  conservatism is the new counterculture. Your avatar versus what you really look like.
[2:56:05.320 --> 2:56:11.000]  Yeah, Superman versus Clark Kent. Oh yeah, and you look like this. When your dog is more attractive
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:16.120]  than you, probably wise to stop throwing stones from within that glass house. You want to talk
[2:56:16.120 --> 2:56:20.520]  about fake news, the state of your profile pic compared to what you actually look like.
[2:56:21.240 --> 2:56:27.160]  Oh, so you really want to turn this into a beauty contest? Okay, so we've got the likes of Milo,
[2:56:27.160 --> 2:56:31.800]  Crowder, Lauren, Marion, Tomy, and yours truly. Who've you got? Michael Moore?
[2:56:31.800 --> 2:56:39.240]  Leena Dunham? Amy Schumer? Madonna? Cenk Yuga?
[2:56:40.760 --> 2:56:45.240]  Yeah, good luck with that. Studies show that conservatives are more attractive. And that's
[2:56:45.240 --> 2:56:50.360]  another reason why we're taking over the counterculture. Because no matter how much you try and
[2:56:50.360 --> 2:56:58.440]  make it that way, being fat and ugly isn't cool. Studies also show that 92% of left-wing activists
[2:56:58.440 --> 2:57:04.840]  live with their parents and 90% are single. In other words, leftists are statistically far more
[2:57:04.840 --> 2:57:11.000]  likely to be complete losers who spend all day masturbating alone in their own basements.
[2:57:11.720 --> 2:57:17.480]  And that's not cool either. So when Generation Z sees smart, attractive, rebellious, daring,
[2:57:17.480 --> 2:57:23.720]  successful people pissing off the Puritans, pissing off the authoritarians at school who lecture them
[2:57:23.720 --> 2:57:29.160]  all day about what they can and can't say and how they should behave. Obviously, they're naturally
[2:57:29.160 --> 2:57:34.840]  going to be drawn to us. That's why we're resonating so much with young people. That's why
[2:57:34.840 --> 2:57:41.000]  conservatism is the new punk rock. Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[2:57:46.440 --> 2:57:51.640]  Every video I've ordered ends with bing bong, bing bing bing. That's like the signature of the
[2:57:51.640 --> 2:57:56.440]  victory. Like in thousands of years, like they'll know that was the signal of victory. Bing bong,
[2:57:56.440 --> 2:58:00.360]  bing bing, bing bing, bong bong, bing bing. David Knight's coming up. I got one more important
[2:58:00.360 --> 2:58:05.880]  report I want to get to that's very powerful. Why? Left to left, Prager University, that's coming up
[2:58:06.680 --> 2:58:13.240]  and much, much more. I wouldn't call this even left or right. The left though is a very authoritarian
[2:58:13.240 --> 2:58:18.520]  group. It's globalist social engineering. It's declassified, cooked up by the big tank tanks,
[2:58:18.520 --> 2:58:23.400]  the CIA, and it is created in a mitigated mess. By the way, I'm not saying you're bad
[2:58:23.400 --> 2:58:27.880]  if you're fat. I've been fat. The point is they're telling you to try to stay as fat as possible
[2:58:27.880 --> 2:58:32.520]  and then hate everyone else. It's like this misery loves company type paradigm. All right,
[2:58:32.520 --> 2:58:37.480]  fourth hour with David Knight and more coming up, but I've got more to say. Straight ahead in 70
[2:58:37.480 --> 2:58:44.040]  seconds. Infowars.com has a ton of breaking news. It's a whole other dimension of the show. Get those
[2:58:44.040 --> 2:58:53.720]  articles. The carbon tax has been pushed hard this week. James Baker, former White House Chief
[2:58:53.720 --> 2:58:58.120]  of Staff, was running around doing interviews and speeches pushing the carbon tax in the name of
[2:58:58.120 --> 2:59:02.680]  saving the environment with his newly formed Climate Leadership Council. Mitt Romney tweeted
[2:59:02.680 --> 2:59:07.240]  praise for the CLC's new carbon tax plan. Even Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has supported
[2:59:07.240 --> 2:59:11.160]  a carbon tax in the past. This tax would be terrible for the coal industry, which Trump
[2:59:11.160 --> 2:59:15.720]  voiced support of during his campaign. Don't be fooled by the suggested inner workings of this plan,
[2:59:15.720 --> 2:59:20.120]  which would sound good to the average show. This is merely a psychological tactic forcing the carbon
[2:59:20.120 --> 2:59:24.520]  tax into your subconscious so they can eventually ram it home. The government will never pay you
[2:59:24.520 --> 2:59:29.080]  any money from a carbon tax. This plan is a red herring. Bloomberg published a piece praising
[2:59:29.080 --> 2:59:33.560]  the carbon tax plan claiming it will save the world from climate change. Yes, the bureaucratic
[2:59:33.560 --> 2:59:38.200]  exchange of money will stop climate change. Give me a break. Really, this is a final attempt by
[2:59:38.200 --> 2:59:42.120]  the bought and paid for government to have say over who gets to make what and how much,
[2:59:42.120 --> 2:59:46.520]  essentially burying any free market competition in taxes and regulations.
[2:59:46.520 --> 3:00:09.640]  This is Owen Schreuer for info wars.com. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:09.640 --> 3:00:15.400]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing bing.
[3:00:15.400 --> 3:00:20.440]  That is like when aliens land. You like just cut the big broadcasting thing and you just say
[3:00:20.440 --> 3:00:23.160]  bing bing bong bing bing bong bing bing bing. I mean I'm
[3:00:24.520 --> 3:00:27.640]  is Trump giving us the secret code of the universe to probably have like 100 newspapers
[3:00:27.640 --> 3:00:32.440]  tomorrow. Jones believes Trump has a secret alien code. It's a joke New York Times,
[3:00:32.440 --> 3:00:36.560]  It's a joke, I actually have the New York Times calling me right now.
[3:00:36.560 --> 3:00:39.800]  It's a joke, ha-ha.
[3:00:39.800 --> 3:00:43.040]  David Knight's coming up with a huge broadcast in the fourth hour today, and I only knew
[3:00:43.040 --> 3:00:44.040]  tonight's 7 o'clock.
[3:00:44.040 --> 3:00:45.720]  But this report is key.
[3:00:45.720 --> 3:00:48.280]  Why I left the left.
[3:00:48.280 --> 3:00:49.280]  This is very important.
[3:00:49.280 --> 3:00:50.280]  Here it is.
[3:00:50.280 --> 3:00:51.280]  I'm Alex Jones.
[3:00:51.280 --> 3:00:52.280]  This is the Info War.
[3:00:52.280 --> 3:00:54.160]  Do you believe in free speech?
[3:00:54.160 --> 3:00:59.480]  Do you believe that people should be judged by their character, not their skin color?
[3:00:59.480 --> 3:01:01.880]  Do you believe in freedom of religion?
[3:01:01.880 --> 3:01:06.160]  If you believe these things, you're probably not a progressive.
[3:01:06.160 --> 3:01:09.600]  You might think you're a progressive, I used to think I was.
[3:01:09.600 --> 3:01:15.400]  My show, The Rubin Report, was originally part of the Progressive Young Turks Network.
[3:01:15.400 --> 3:01:18.600]  Progressives struck me as liberals, but louder.
[3:01:18.600 --> 3:01:19.800]  Progressives were the nice guys.
[3:01:19.800 --> 3:01:21.320]  They looked out for the little guy.
[3:01:21.320 --> 3:01:23.760]  They cared about women and minorities.
[3:01:23.760 --> 3:01:25.520]  They embraced change.
[3:01:25.520 --> 3:01:28.920]  In short, who wouldn't want to be a progressive?
[3:01:28.920 --> 3:01:34.200]  But over the last couple of years, the meaning of the word progressive has changed.
[3:01:34.200 --> 3:01:38.440]  Progressives used to say, I may disagree with what you say, but I'll fight to the death
[3:01:38.440 --> 3:01:40.400]  for your right to say it.
[3:01:40.400 --> 3:01:41.800]  Not anymore.
[3:01:41.800 --> 3:01:46.200]  Banning speakers whose opinions you don't agree with from college campuses?
[3:01:46.200 --> 3:01:48.040]  That's not progressive.
[3:01:48.040 --> 3:01:52.320]  Prohibiting any words not approved of as politically correct?
[3:01:52.320 --> 3:01:53.960]  That's not progressive.
[3:01:53.960 --> 3:01:59.400]  Using trigger warnings on books, movies, music, anything that might offend people?
[3:01:59.400 --> 3:02:01.440]  That's not progressive either.
[3:02:01.440 --> 3:02:06.800]  All of this has led me to believe that much of the left is no longer progressive, but
[3:02:06.800 --> 3:02:08.240]  regressive.
[3:02:08.240 --> 3:02:12.560]  This is one of the reasons I've spent so much time on my show talking about the regressive
[3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:13.960]  left.
[3:02:13.960 --> 3:02:19.760]  This regressive ideology doesn't judge people as individuals, but as a collective.
[3:02:19.760 --> 3:02:25.080]  If you're black or female or Muslim or Hispanic or member of any other minority group, you're
[3:02:25.080 --> 3:02:30.120]  judged differently than the most evil of all things, a white Christian male.
[3:02:30.120 --> 3:02:34.320]  The regressive left ranks minority groups in a pecking order to compete in a kind of
[3:02:34.320 --> 3:02:36.160]  oppression Olympics.
[3:02:36.160 --> 3:02:38.360]  Gold medal goes to the most offended.
[3:02:38.360 --> 3:02:43.760]  Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream that his children would be judged by their character and not
[3:02:43.760 --> 3:02:50.120]  their skin color was a liberal idea, but these days it's not a progressive ideal.
[3:02:50.120 --> 3:02:55.040]  And what about religious freedom, the idea that no one else can tell you what you have
[3:02:55.040 --> 3:02:56.040]  to believe?
[3:02:56.040 --> 3:02:59.600]  Surely progressives still support that basic right?
[3:02:59.600 --> 3:03:01.280]  Well, not so much.
[3:03:01.280 --> 3:03:05.760]  I'm a married gay man, so you might think that I appreciate the government forcing a
[3:03:05.760 --> 3:03:10.560]  Christian baker or photographer or florist to act against their religion in order to
[3:03:10.560 --> 3:03:14.600]  cater, photograph, or decorate my wedding, but you'd be wrong.
[3:03:14.600 --> 3:03:19.440]  A government that can force Christians to violate their conscience can force me to violate
[3:03:19.440 --> 3:03:20.440]  mine.
[3:03:20.440 --> 3:03:24.080]  If a baker won't bake you a cake, find another baker.
[3:03:24.080 --> 3:03:28.720]  Don't demand that the state tell him what to do with his private business.
[3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:33.840]  I'm pro-choice, but a government that can force a group of Catholic nuns, literally
[3:03:33.840 --> 3:03:39.640]  called the Little Sisters of the Poor, to violate their faith and pay for abortion-inducing
[3:03:39.640 --> 3:03:44.000]  birth control can force anyone to do anything.
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:47.800]  That's not progressive, that's regressive.
[3:03:47.800 --> 3:03:53.920]  Today's progressivism has become a foe-moral movement hurling charges of racism, bigotry,
[3:03:53.920 --> 3:03:59.960]  xenophobia, homophobia, Islamophobia, and a slew of other meaningless buzzwords at anyone
[3:03:59.960 --> 3:04:01.760]  they disagree with.
[3:04:01.760 --> 3:04:06.800]  The battle of ideas has been replaced by a battle of feelings, and outrage has replaced
[3:04:06.800 --> 3:04:08.320]  honesty.
[3:04:08.320 --> 3:04:13.160]  Society reigns supreme as long as it's not that pesky diversity of thought.
[3:04:13.160 --> 3:04:19.000]  This isn't the recipe for a free society, it's a recipe for authoritarianism.
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:22.720]  For these reasons, I can no longer call myself a progressive.
[3:04:22.720 --> 3:04:25.080]  I don't really call myself a Democrat either.
[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:30.160]  I'm a classical liberal, a free thinker, and as much as I don't like to admit it,
[3:04:30.160 --> 3:04:35.080]  defending my liberal values has suddenly become a conservative position.
[3:04:35.080 --> 3:04:39.200]  So if you think people should be able to say what they think without being punished
[3:04:39.200 --> 3:04:44.280]  for it, that people should be judged by their behavior, not their skin color, and that people
[3:04:44.280 --> 3:04:49.240]  should be able to live the way that they want to live without government interference, then
[3:04:49.240 --> 3:04:53.760]  there's not much left on the left for you.
[3:04:53.760 --> 3:04:55.760]  David Rubin produced a perfect report there.
[3:04:55.760 --> 3:04:57.960]  I don't think I've ever seen that before, we gotta get him on.
[3:04:57.960 --> 3:04:58.960]  That is amazing.
[3:04:58.960 --> 3:04:59.960]  We'll be back with David Knight.
[3:04:59.960 --> 3:05:04.960]  First, Trump submits a temporary travel ban, something legal and lawful, done in the past,
[3:05:04.960 --> 3:05:06.440]  off Obama's list.
[3:05:06.440 --> 3:05:11.080]  Then the Democrats and media spin it, protests ensue nationwide, judges block it, and Trump
[3:05:11.080 --> 3:05:13.000]  tweets, see you in court.
[3:05:13.000 --> 3:05:17.640]  Meanwhile, Steve Jern, a U.S. Marine working in Iraq, posts a viral video explaining to
[3:05:17.640 --> 3:05:22.400]  people that if an American walks out on the streets in Iraq, he'd be scooped up and tortured.
[3:05:22.400 --> 3:05:26.840]  Then, 15 hours later, after that video gets viewed millions of times, he gets blocked
[3:05:26.840 --> 3:05:31.480]  on Facebook and is evacuated out of Iraq and sent back to America.
[3:05:31.480 --> 3:05:35.880]  And now, hundreds of thousands of Iranians are rallying in the streets, carrying signs
[3:05:35.880 --> 3:05:40.840]  and chanting, Death to America, while a military police band plays revolutionary music, getting
[3:05:40.840 --> 3:05:42.320]  hyped up over their enemy.
[3:05:42.320 --> 3:05:43.320]  Us!
[3:05:43.320 --> 3:05:44.320]  Let's not forget.
[3:05:44.320 --> 3:05:48.280]  Terrorists have been taking advantage of refugee programs for years, and Assad has just said
[3:05:48.280 --> 3:05:50.680]  there are terrorists within the refugees.
[3:05:50.680 --> 3:05:52.760]  Are these judges not treasonous?
[3:05:52.760 --> 3:05:55.160]  You still want to protest the travel ban?
[3:05:55.160 --> 3:05:58.040]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[3:05:58.040 --> 3:05:59.840]  You can't script this.
[3:05:59.840 --> 3:06:01.680]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[3:06:01.680 --> 3:06:03.720]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[3:06:03.720 --> 3:06:06.600]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[3:06:06.600 --> 3:06:12.640]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[3:06:12.640 --> 3:06:17.560]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking
[3:06:17.560 --> 3:06:22.520]  Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[3:06:22.520 --> 3:06:27.640]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[3:06:27.640 --> 3:06:29.400]  you can to purify your air.
[3:06:29.400 --> 3:06:34.400]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[3:06:34.400 --> 3:06:37.400]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[3:06:37.400 --> 3:06:39.600]  The general public doesn't.
[3:06:39.600 --> 3:06:43.560]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[3:06:43.560 --> 3:06:47.160]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[3:06:47.160 --> 3:06:50.760]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[3:06:50.760 --> 3:06:53.920]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[3:06:53.920 --> 3:07:00.320]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.

[3:07:56.840 --> 3:08:22.040]  This world can't disagree, they don't understand how it can be.
[3:08:22.040 --> 3:08:34.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Friday, February the 10th, 2017, we're going
[3:08:34.320 --> 3:08:35.880]  pretty quickly through February.
[3:08:35.880 --> 3:08:39.600]  Today we're going to be talking a great deal about the law, about the Supreme Court, and
[3:08:39.600 --> 3:08:44.360]  of course about this decision, the most popular executive order that Donald Trump has done,
[3:08:44.360 --> 3:08:46.600]  now being shut down by some activist judges.
[3:08:46.600 --> 3:08:51.120]  So we're going to have reactions from a lot of people on both the left and the right.
[3:08:51.120 --> 3:08:55.760]  We have Judge Napolitano, we have Trey Gowdy on the right, but we also have Jonathan Turley
[3:08:55.760 --> 3:08:59.640]  on MSNBC talking about this and disagreeing with the court.
[3:08:59.640 --> 3:09:03.040]  We're going to have Lionel join us at the bottom of the hour, and he's going to talk
[3:09:03.040 --> 3:09:07.920]  about what is behind this, and we're going to actually read you a little bit of the
[3:09:07.920 --> 3:09:13.400]  key statements about what they said at the Ninth Circuit yesterday, in terms of why they
[3:09:13.400 --> 3:09:15.280]  were overthrowing this.
[3:09:15.280 --> 3:09:18.840]  But before we get into that, I want to get into something else that I think is also very
[3:09:18.840 --> 3:09:23.680]  important when we look at the Supreme Court, and that is the right to life.
[3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:28.280]  And we have to understand that when we look at this judicial activism, and now they've
[3:09:28.280 --> 3:09:34.560]  even got a term for it, they love to call it impact litigation, in other words they
[3:09:34.560 --> 3:09:39.720]  want to use litigation to achieve what they cannot achieve at the ballot box, to enact
[3:09:39.720 --> 3:09:41.280]  a judicial tyranny on us.
[3:09:41.280 --> 3:09:45.120]  And I think it's very important that when we go back and look at what the founders thought
[3:09:45.120 --> 3:09:50.640]  about the courts, Alexander Hamilton, who was really no libertarian, he was one of the
[3:09:50.640 --> 3:09:55.720]  most statist of the founding fathers, said that the judiciary was the least dangerous
[3:09:55.720 --> 3:09:59.200]  of all the branches because they didn't have the power of the executive, and they didn't
[3:09:59.200 --> 3:10:01.880]  have the passion of the legislative branch.
[3:10:01.880 --> 3:10:04.320]  Well, now they have both power and passion.
[3:10:04.320 --> 3:10:10.120]  They have assumed the power, and they are passionately activist on their political positions.
[3:10:10.120 --> 3:10:11.880]  And so that's the state that we're in today.
[3:10:11.880 --> 3:10:17.240]  But before we get to all this, I want to take a look at some life issues here.
[3:10:17.240 --> 3:10:20.640]  There's a story that came out of the UK, the UK Telegraph.
[3:10:20.640 --> 3:10:28.000]  And this is some ethicists, and I put that in air quotes here, ethicists, at Oxford University.
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:34.160]  And they have argued that newborn babies may be killed because they have no right to life.
[3:10:34.160 --> 3:10:38.080]  They are morally irrelevant in their terms, morally irrelevant, a newborn baby.
[3:10:38.080 --> 3:10:44.200]  Now, I just talked, I guess it was two weeks ago, to the author, looking at the case of
[3:10:44.200 --> 3:10:50.560]  Kermit Gosnell, he is serving life sentence without possibility of parole because he killed
[3:10:50.560 --> 3:10:55.800]  fully formed babies, newborn babies, babies that the mothers went for an abortion, but
[3:10:55.800 --> 3:10:59.280]  they were able to survive on their own, they were born alive.
[3:10:59.280 --> 3:11:03.200]  And we have had this battle here in America, and I got to say that was one of the things
[3:11:03.200 --> 3:11:05.360]  that changed my mind, and I had never really thought about it.
[3:11:05.360 --> 3:11:08.280]  And then the abstract, I looked at it and thought, well, you know, I don't really want
[3:11:08.280 --> 3:11:10.440]  government making a lot of decisions about my life.
[3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:15.000]  This is kind of fuzzy at one point, I was looking at it, and I thought, well, maybe they shouldn't
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:16.000]  get involved.
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:19.800]  But then why I realized what was going on with partial birth abortion, the lie involved
[3:11:19.800 --> 3:11:23.880]  in that, a full term baby, capable of survival on its own.
[3:11:23.880 --> 3:11:27.440]  They bring this baby out, and as long as one teeny bit of that baby is still inside the
[3:11:27.440 --> 3:11:30.480]  mother, they can do whatever they want to legally to it.
[3:11:30.480 --> 3:11:32.800]  Well, that's been shut down, thankfully.
[3:11:32.800 --> 3:11:37.440]  And babies that were born alive, that was shut down before Kermit Gosnell.
[3:11:37.440 --> 3:11:41.640]  And so now he's serving multiple terms in prison and rightfully so, rightfully so.
[3:11:41.640 --> 3:11:47.920]  He was, as I point out in that book, America's biggest serial killer, had absolutely no conscience
[3:11:47.920 --> 3:11:50.680]  to it.
[3:11:50.680 --> 3:11:55.240]  He was a total sociopath, psychopath killer.
[3:11:55.240 --> 3:11:57.360]  He had no conscience whatsoever about that.
[3:11:57.360 --> 3:11:58.360]  He was proud of what he did.
[3:11:58.360 --> 3:11:59.640]  He kept souvenirs of what he did.
[3:11:59.640 --> 3:12:03.680]  That's one of the things that essentially hung him, metaphorically.
[3:12:03.680 --> 3:12:07.040]  But these people, this is what they're arguing in a Journal of Medical Ethics.
[3:12:07.040 --> 3:12:10.920]  They say newborn babies are not, quote, actual persons.
[3:12:10.920 --> 3:12:12.920]  They do not have a moral right to life.
[3:12:12.920 --> 3:12:16.520]  This is the Oxford Center for Practical Ethics.
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:18.640]  What have our universities become?
[3:12:18.640 --> 3:12:23.440]  I think it's time we start seriously considering whether or not we need to remove funding
[3:12:23.440 --> 3:12:27.520]  from these corrupt organizations.
[3:12:27.520 --> 3:12:29.760]  Universities are dragging down society.
[3:12:29.760 --> 3:12:34.440]  They are a cesspool of the very worst in society.
[3:12:34.440 --> 3:12:36.880]  And I think we need to start looking at cutting their funding.
[3:12:36.880 --> 3:12:41.920]  And quite frankly, you'll be interested to find out that the universities are at the
[3:12:41.920 --> 3:12:47.320]  center of opposing this travel ban that was enacted by the executive branch.
[3:12:47.320 --> 3:12:51.560]  The first judge who did it said, this is having a tremendous effect on the states.
[3:12:51.560 --> 3:12:56.360]  When we talk about who had standing to sue, I looked at it and it's like, how could this
[3:12:56.360 --> 3:12:57.920]  even get to court?
[3:12:57.920 --> 3:13:01.800]  Because you're talking about people who are not citizens, who are not in this country,
[3:13:01.800 --> 3:13:04.720]  or if they're in this country, they're still not citizens.
[3:13:04.720 --> 3:13:06.120]  They don't have standing to sue.
[3:13:06.120 --> 3:13:07.120]  They don't have rights.
[3:13:07.120 --> 3:13:08.120]  But of course, that's part of it.
[3:13:08.120 --> 3:13:13.840]  Just as they invented a right to kill children, they're now inventing a right to emigrate
[3:13:13.840 --> 3:13:14.840]  in the United States.
[3:13:14.840 --> 3:13:16.480]  And that's the key thing we're going to be talking about.
[3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:21.400]  But let's go back to this, these so-called medical ethicists at Oxford University in
[3:13:21.400 --> 3:13:22.480]  England.
[3:13:22.480 --> 3:13:26.600]  The article said that the authors had received death threats since publishing the article.
[3:13:26.600 --> 3:13:28.000]  Why do you think that is?
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:36.920]  Look, if you say that an innocent baby has no right to life, how can you stand?
[3:13:36.920 --> 3:13:39.560]  We can all look at any individual person here.
[3:13:39.560 --> 3:13:45.240]  We can say, look, as an adult, I don't like what this guy did and I think they ought to
[3:13:45.240 --> 3:13:46.240]  be killed or whatever.
[3:13:46.240 --> 3:13:47.440]  A baby's never done anything.
[3:13:47.440 --> 3:13:51.760]  So you can make an extreme case about anybody who's been alive for a while.
[3:13:51.760 --> 3:13:58.240]  It wouldn't be necessarily supported, certainly, but an innocent newborn baby is innocent as
[3:13:58.240 --> 3:13:59.240]  they come.
[3:13:59.240 --> 3:14:00.280]  And you say they have no right to life.
[3:14:00.280 --> 3:14:05.800]  How are you, you medical ethicists who are calling for the murder of innocent babies,
[3:14:05.800 --> 3:14:11.680]  how can you say that you have a moral right to life, understand that you're throwing yourself
[3:14:11.680 --> 3:14:12.680]  out of the bus?
[3:14:12.680 --> 3:14:16.000]  See, this is what's very important about Neil Gorsuch, the Supreme Court appointment.
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:19.480]  One of the things that he did that everybody is very impressed with, even if they don't
[3:14:19.480 --> 3:14:21.880]  agree with his conclusions, they're very impressed with his legal arguments.
[3:14:21.880 --> 3:14:28.520]  He wrote a book on assisted suicide in euthanasia, and he talked about the moral imperative of
[3:14:28.520 --> 3:14:29.640]  life.
[3:14:29.640 --> 3:14:34.160]  We need someone like that on the Supreme Court.
[3:14:34.160 --> 3:14:38.480]  We should all be very thankful that that is the kind of person that Donald Trump has
[3:14:38.480 --> 3:14:39.480]  nominated.
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:45.000]  And I'm talking about this, everything we're talking about today really is about setting
[3:14:45.000 --> 3:14:50.040]  the course for this country, especially within the judicial system, taking it back away from
[3:14:50.040 --> 3:14:51.680]  this activism.
[3:14:51.680 --> 3:14:54.320]  And of course, Neil Gorsuch is on the right idea there.
[3:14:54.320 --> 3:14:59.040]  He's also of the mold of Antonin Scalia in the sense that we're going to go with the
[3:14:59.040 --> 3:15:00.040]  text.
[3:15:00.040 --> 3:15:01.040]  We're going to go with the Constitution.
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:02.760]  We're going to go with original intent.
[3:15:02.760 --> 3:15:09.120]  We're going to look at what the actual law says instead of what you, as judges, prefer.
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:10.920]  What your personal opinion is about life.
[3:15:10.920 --> 3:15:14.040]  No, you're supposed to have an opinion about the text.
[3:15:14.040 --> 3:15:16.200]  Not an opinion about the issues.
[3:15:16.200 --> 3:15:18.280]  See, that's the key thing here.
[3:15:18.280 --> 3:15:23.480]  Now, they go on to say rather than being an actual person, newborns were potential persons,
[3:15:23.480 --> 3:15:24.480]  potential persons.
[3:15:24.480 --> 3:15:29.720]  So they only have potential even though they're capable of existing on their own.
[3:15:29.720 --> 3:15:34.320]  That is the slippery slope that we have created when we said that babies have no right to
[3:15:34.320 --> 3:15:37.360]  life as long as their little bit of them is in the mother.
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:38.640]  And of course, they still argue for this.
[3:15:38.640 --> 3:15:44.680]  And at the same time, Daily Caller points out that the president of Planned Parenthood,
[3:15:44.680 --> 3:15:49.320]  Cecil Richards, and of course, she is the daughter of Ann Richards, who used to mock
[3:15:49.320 --> 3:15:53.320]  George W. Bush for poor George, born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
[3:15:53.320 --> 3:15:58.720]  I guess she would rather he'd never been born and if they'd had their way, I'm sure he wouldn't.
[3:15:58.720 --> 3:16:03.200]  Of course, the Bushes are heavily into the Planned Parenthood issue as well.
[3:16:03.200 --> 3:16:11.400]  It was George W.'s grandfather, Preston, who was I think the first treasure for them back
[3:16:11.400 --> 3:16:17.080]  when they were just getting started and we had Margaret Sanger who was setting up her
[3:16:17.080 --> 3:16:19.920]  centers to eradicate the black population.
[3:16:19.920 --> 3:16:25.280]  She was open about that and Prescott Bush was all about that.
[3:16:25.280 --> 3:16:30.160]  And so we also have connections with George H. W. Bush as well with Planned Parenthood.
[3:16:30.160 --> 3:16:34.880]  So this is what Cecil Richards, the current president of Planned Parenthood said.
[3:16:34.880 --> 3:16:40.400]  She wants to push the pro-abortion movement to the next level and to do that, she wants
[3:16:40.400 --> 3:16:45.160]  to get rid of the stigma and shame, she said, surrounding abortion.
[3:16:45.160 --> 3:16:50.880]  I think it's time for us to be bold and so I want to ask you to do something or to think
[3:16:50.880 --> 3:16:54.080]  about doing something and that is to share your story.
[3:16:54.080 --> 3:16:55.240]  This is the time to do it.
[3:16:55.240 --> 3:17:00.520]  So let's be proud of our abortions instead of understanding what is there and look,
[3:17:00.520 --> 3:17:07.280]  I want to say to people who have made that decision, there's times in my life when if
[3:17:07.280 --> 3:17:11.120]  I'd been confronted with that decision, as I said before, I didn't really understand
[3:17:11.120 --> 3:17:12.480]  the issues involved in it.
[3:17:12.480 --> 3:17:16.600]  I didn't understand it from a theological standpoint, I didn't understand it from a
[3:17:16.600 --> 3:17:19.480]  moral standpoint, I didn't understand it from a legal standpoint.
[3:17:19.480 --> 3:17:23.720]  When I realized what was involved in partial birth abortion, I knew that what they'd been
[3:17:23.720 --> 3:17:25.000]  telling me was simply a lie.
[3:17:25.000 --> 3:17:28.720]  They had a different agenda and you need to understand what that agenda is and if you
[3:17:28.720 --> 3:17:34.640]  did that, you have to understand there is something about that that you can talk about,
[3:17:34.640 --> 3:17:40.120]  not to be proud of it, but to tell people that you'd been deceived about that, to tell
[3:17:40.120 --> 3:17:44.040]  people that you regret that and to tell people that you found forgiveness for that in the
[3:17:44.040 --> 3:17:48.960]  Lord Jesus Christ, you can find that.
[3:17:48.960 --> 3:17:55.280]  So that is where we are and we're going to talk about these other court cases.
[3:17:55.280 --> 3:17:59.160]  Let's talk about something that's a little more cut and dried for most people, I think.
[3:17:59.160 --> 3:18:02.840]  And that is, why do we have these decisions being made?
[3:18:02.840 --> 3:18:04.480]  Is it something that is reviewable?
[3:18:04.480 --> 3:18:05.800]  Can the President shut this down?
[3:18:05.800 --> 3:18:10.360]  Of course, President Andrew Jackson said of the Supreme Court, well, they've made their
[3:18:10.360 --> 3:18:11.640]  decision.
[3:18:11.640 --> 3:18:15.720]  Let's see the Supreme Court justice enforce that.
[3:18:15.720 --> 3:18:19.640]  Something that goes back to what Alexander Hamilton said.
[3:18:19.640 --> 3:18:24.400]  He said the executive branch has the power, the judicial branch doesn't have the power
[3:18:24.400 --> 3:18:27.480]  to enforce its orders.
[3:18:27.480 --> 3:18:32.920]  And so you have to submit yourself to that authority and it's wrong to do that.
[3:18:32.920 --> 3:18:36.280]  We've had a lot of Presidents now, modern Presidents who do do that.
[3:18:36.280 --> 3:18:43.040]  One of the things that this judge in Seattle said was he said, I think I have jurisdiction
[3:18:43.040 --> 3:18:44.040]  here.
[3:18:44.040 --> 3:18:47.240]  We have some traditions in terms of our decisions.
[3:18:47.240 --> 3:18:51.800]  And the very fact that the executive branch has sent representatives here from the Department
[3:18:51.800 --> 3:18:57.520]  of Justice, federal delegates to come to my court to argue before my court, they have
[3:18:57.520 --> 3:19:00.280]  submitted themselves to my authority, essentially.
[3:19:00.280 --> 3:19:04.520]  I think what they ought to do, and I'll talk to Lionel when he joins us at the bottom of
[3:19:04.520 --> 3:19:09.680]  the hour, I think the Justice Department, I go in on behalf of the President and say,
[3:19:09.680 --> 3:19:13.640]  here's the relevant sections of the Constitution that shows the executive branch has power over
[3:19:13.640 --> 3:19:16.800]  immigration and over national security.
[3:19:16.800 --> 3:19:19.720]  And we're going to talk to you later.
[3:19:19.720 --> 3:19:22.360]  We're out of here because you have no jurisdiction over us.
[3:19:22.360 --> 3:19:28.600]  No more jurisdiction than if the Seattle judge wanted to rule on a court that was in Georgia.
[3:19:28.600 --> 3:19:31.840]  See, it's not his jurisdiction.
[3:19:31.840 --> 3:19:37.760]  And that jurisdiction has not only geographical, but it also has constitutional limits.
[3:19:37.760 --> 3:19:42.840]  And we have had Presidents over and over again, the beginning of this country, that would
[3:19:42.840 --> 3:19:43.840]  shut that down.
[3:19:43.840 --> 3:19:44.840]  It's rightly or wrongly.
[3:19:44.840 --> 3:19:47.920]  I mean, many times the Presidents were wrong and the Supreme Court was right.
[3:19:47.920 --> 3:19:49.320]  Sometimes it was the other way around.
[3:19:49.320 --> 3:19:50.960]  The Supreme Court has been wrong about a lot of things.
[3:19:50.960 --> 3:19:52.120]  They were wrong about slavery.
[3:19:52.120 --> 3:19:55.400]  They were wrong about freedom of speech with movies.
[3:19:55.400 --> 3:19:59.200]  For about 50 years, it was not considered to be free speech for movies.
[3:19:59.200 --> 3:20:00.360]  Remember that, liberals would be right back.

[3:23:07.320 --> 3:23:13.440]  I had fantastic results with the Andro 400 Mac, probably lost 35 pounds.
[3:23:13.440 --> 3:23:19.240]  And more impressive than that was the inches I lost off of my belly and my waist.
[3:23:19.240 --> 3:23:21.240]  And the increased energy is fantastic.
[3:23:21.240 --> 3:23:26.720]  I'll be totally honest, I tried a different product and I wasn't happy with the different
[3:23:26.720 --> 3:23:27.720]  product.
[3:23:27.720 --> 3:23:32.200]  These guys are considerably cheaper than the other brand and I can really feel the

[3:23:54.120 --> 3:24:10.120]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:24:10.120 --> 3:24:14.800]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:24:14.800 --> 3:24:17.600]  I'm David Knight and we're going to be joined in the next segment by Lionel.
[3:24:17.600 --> 3:24:22.120]  He, of course, is a talk show host but he's also an attorney.
[3:24:22.120 --> 3:24:23.120]  He's worked as a prosecutor.
[3:24:23.120 --> 3:24:28.080]  He understands the law so we're going to get him to weigh in on these decisions about
[3:24:28.080 --> 3:24:30.280]  Donald Trump's executive order on travel bans.
[3:24:30.280 --> 3:24:33.760]  I'm going to read to you in this segment some of the things that people on both the left
[3:24:33.760 --> 3:24:38.240]  and the right have been saying from Judge Apollo and Trey Gowdy to Jonathan Turley on
[3:24:38.240 --> 3:24:39.240]  MSNBC.
[3:24:39.240 --> 3:24:45.240]  I think it's very interesting to see what people are saying and we'll get Lionel's
[3:24:45.240 --> 3:24:50.000]  reactions to their opinions as well as his own opinion on the law when he joins us in
[3:24:50.000 --> 3:24:51.000]  the next segment.
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:24:56.400]  To get back to this issue, I want to remind you that we have a new product that's just
[3:24:56.400 --> 3:25:00.360]  come online, an air filter for your car from Alexa Pure.
[3:25:00.360 --> 3:25:06.200]  This is the Alexa Pure Breeze Micro at infowarsstore.com, powerful little workhorse that plugs in
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:11.560]  your car and cleans the air up there where you've got some of the dirtiest air that you're
[3:25:11.560 --> 3:25:15.640]  going to find that is following along behind another car.
[3:25:15.640 --> 3:25:22.520]  Of course, if you're with the EPA, you want to try to use that to literally, folks, hooked
[3:25:22.520 --> 3:25:27.880]  people up to diesel tailpipes so they could have an excuse to up their regulations.
[3:25:27.880 --> 3:25:32.400]  But of course, we're not talking the EPA, we're talking about real life here, so don't
[3:25:32.400 --> 3:25:34.760]  be a guinea pig for the EPA.
[3:25:34.760 --> 3:25:39.320]  Run this little Alexa Pure Breeze Micro in your car to clean up the air that you're going
[3:25:39.320 --> 3:25:44.000]  to be exposed to on the highway and then of course, as you see up there, super blue is
[3:25:44.000 --> 3:25:47.480]  now back in stock after being sold out for months at infowarslife.com.
[3:25:47.480 --> 3:25:51.960]  I was able to get that yesterday and I tried it for the first time yesterday and I think
[3:25:51.960 --> 3:25:52.960]  it is great.
[3:25:52.960 --> 3:25:57.080]  I was just talking to Zaka, Owen Shroyer was saying he loves it.
[3:25:57.080 --> 3:26:01.800]  This is a great toothpaste, folks, that makes your mouth feel really fresh.
[3:26:01.800 --> 3:26:05.640]  And if you look at the ingredients in there, there's nothing harmful that's all natural,
[3:26:05.640 --> 3:26:11.720]  very powerful ingredients, things like xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and many
[3:26:11.720 --> 3:26:12.720]  other things.
[3:26:12.720 --> 3:26:19.640]  It's there to be a very effective, to effectively fight the bacteria that are in your gums.
[3:26:19.640 --> 3:26:24.520]  Because if you have bacteria in your gums, it can lead to development of heart disease,
[3:26:24.520 --> 3:26:28.640]  heart attacks, it can enter your bloodstream, it can even cause blood clots or heart attacks.
[3:26:28.640 --> 3:26:33.360]  So that's why they've taken out the, there's no fluoride in there and they've added nano
[3:26:33.360 --> 3:26:39.600]  silver and other things, even tea tree oil to fight the bacteria in your mouth in your
[3:26:39.600 --> 3:26:40.600]  gums.
[3:26:40.600 --> 3:26:43.400]  And like I said before, it is great, I really love it.
[3:26:43.400 --> 3:26:47.200]  I'm going to, that's going to be the toothpaste for my entire family.
[3:26:47.200 --> 3:26:50.320]  It's the first time I was able to get it yesterday, like I said, it's sold out.
[3:26:50.320 --> 3:26:54.320]  Now it is back in stock at infowarslife.com.
[3:26:54.320 --> 3:26:58.680]  Now I said Lionel is going to be joining us to talk about this outrageous couple of decisions
[3:26:58.680 --> 3:26:59.680]  that we've seen from these courts.
[3:26:59.680 --> 3:27:04.600]  I want to give you an example here, when we talk about whether or not the president can
[3:27:04.600 --> 3:27:08.640]  ignore a court order and of course there's a long history for this.
[3:27:08.640 --> 3:27:12.440]  We had FDR, remember when FDR wanted to put his new deal through?
[3:27:12.440 --> 3:27:18.160]  And was it, was he kind of rude to these judges?
[3:27:18.160 --> 3:27:20.080]  Yeah, I think so.
[3:27:20.080 --> 3:27:22.880]  Pat Buchanan had a great editorial on WND.
[3:27:22.880 --> 3:27:26.040]  He said, Trump must break judicial power.
[3:27:26.040 --> 3:27:30.520]  And he said, okay, so we've heard the quote about disheartening and demoralizing, of course,
[3:27:30.520 --> 3:27:31.520]  Trump has pushed back.
[3:27:31.520 --> 3:27:35.960]  He says, I don't really trust the comments of the senator who put that out there because
[3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:41.560]  he's made some pretty absurd comments to suck with him for a long time about his history
[3:27:41.560 --> 3:27:43.120]  in Vietnam, which wasn't true.
[3:27:43.120 --> 3:27:48.760]  So Trump questioned the veracity of the comments, but even if that were true, even if that were
[3:27:48.760 --> 3:27:54.360]  true, what Donald Trump said about this so-called judge, he points out that there's been much
[3:27:54.360 --> 3:27:55.360]  worse in the past.
[3:27:55.360 --> 3:27:59.120]  He said, Thomas Jefferson, this is Pat Buchanan writing, Thomas Jefferson not only refused
[3:27:59.120 --> 3:28:04.880]  to enforce the Alien and Sedition Acts by President John Adams, his party impeached the
[3:28:04.880 --> 3:28:09.080]  Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase, who had presided over one of the trials.
[3:28:09.080 --> 3:28:12.560]  And as I mentioned before, Andrew Jackson defied Chief Justice John Marshall.
[3:28:12.560 --> 3:28:15.680]  He said, okay, you made your decision, let's see you enforce it.
[3:28:15.680 --> 3:28:19.360]  And he was talking about moving the chair keys out of Georgia.
[3:28:19.360 --> 3:28:23.280]  Something, by the way, an action that I don't support, but it was Jackson's authority to
[3:28:23.280 --> 3:28:24.280]  do that.
[3:28:24.280 --> 3:28:28.880]  Again, Chief Justice Roger Taney declared the President Abraham Lincoln suspension of the
[3:28:28.880 --> 3:28:33.080]  writ of habeas corpus, which was horrible, by the way, folks.
[3:28:33.080 --> 3:28:38.720]  People don't talk about the horrible things that Lincoln did during the Civil War.
[3:28:38.720 --> 3:28:41.320]  One of these was to suspend habeas corpus.
[3:28:41.320 --> 3:28:45.240]  And the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court said that violates the Constitution.
[3:28:45.240 --> 3:28:50.520]  Lincoln nearly sent troops to arrest him, openly talked about sending troops to arrest
[3:28:50.520 --> 3:28:55.080]  the Supreme Court Justice and FDR said, well, I'm going to add six justices to the court
[3:28:55.080 --> 3:29:00.440]  because everybody knew that the things that he was doing with the New Deal were not constitutional.
[3:29:00.440 --> 3:29:03.800]  And so he decided that he was going to try to pack it at one point.
[3:29:03.800 --> 3:29:08.640]  He referred to them as the nine old men, and then President Eisenhower said his two worst
[3:29:08.640 --> 3:29:15.400]  mistakes that he made as President were his Supreme Court choices, Earl Warren and William
[3:29:15.400 --> 3:29:16.600]  Brennan.
[3:29:16.600 --> 3:29:21.520]  So we have a long tradition of that, and we have a long tradition of executives resisting
[3:29:21.520 --> 3:29:23.000]  the Supreme Court.
[3:29:23.000 --> 3:29:24.000]  Think about this.
[3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:30.760]  In Ohio, there was a small town that used traffic cameras, speed cameras, and handed
[3:29:30.760 --> 3:29:35.000]  out $3 million to drivers, about 45,000 people in just 15 months.
[3:29:35.000 --> 3:29:41.000]  Now, the judge there said that's not constitutional, doesn't match the constitutional of Ohio.
[3:29:41.000 --> 3:29:43.840]  And they said, we don't care, we're going to keep doing it anyway.
[3:29:43.840 --> 3:29:47.640]  So even little municipalities are ignoring the courts in some areas.
[3:29:47.640 --> 3:29:48.640]  Stay with us.
[3:29:48.640 --> 3:29:49.640]  We'll be right back with Lionel.
[3:29:49.640 --> 3:29:56.120]  March, The Empire's on the Run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:56.120 --> 3:30:05.520]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can
[3:30:05.520 --> 3:30:06.520]  produce.
[3:30:06.520 --> 3:30:09.840]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[3:30:09.840 --> 3:30:13.280]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think
[3:30:13.280 --> 3:30:15.480]  it's very, very important.
[3:30:15.480 --> 3:30:22.120]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[3:30:22.120 --> 3:30:24.400]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[3:30:24.400 --> 3:30:26.480]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[3:30:26.480 --> 3:30:30.800]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[3:30:30.800 --> 3:30:33.680]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[3:30:33.680 --> 3:30:35.360]  It works like an antioxidant.
[3:30:35.360 --> 3:30:38.240]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[3:30:38.240 --> 3:30:41.440]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[3:30:41.440 --> 3:30:42.480]  It's in powder form.
[3:30:42.480 --> 3:30:45.200]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[3:30:45.200 --> 3:30:46.200]  I take this.
[3:30:46.200 --> 3:30:50.680]  This is the product that I take, infowarslife.com, and the profit we make.
[3:30:50.680 --> 3:30:51.680]  We fight the global.
[3:30:51.680 --> 3:30:52.680]  We fight the new world order.

[3:31:00.800 --> 3:31:01.800]  David from Seattle.
[3:31:01.800 --> 3:31:07.920]  I'm 51 years old, and six months ago, I started taking Andro 400 to increase my testosterone.
[3:31:07.920 --> 3:31:10.200]  Since then, I've lost 35 pounds of fat.
[3:31:10.200 --> 3:31:13.160]  My waist went from size 38 to size 32.
[3:31:13.160 --> 3:31:16.680]  I have more energy, and I looked and feel 20 years younger.
[3:31:16.680 --> 3:31:19.680]  And now my wife tells me I have to take Andro 400.
[3:31:19.680 --> 3:31:22.320]  Hi, this is Ron Johnson from Utah.
[3:31:22.320 --> 3:31:27.960]  After 10 weeks of taking Andro 400, I lost 13 pounds, and my waist went from 36 to 33.
[3:31:27.960 --> 3:31:29.200]  That was eight years ago.
[3:31:29.200 --> 3:31:35.160]  I continue to take Andro 400, and I've maintained my weight at 172, gained muscle and energy.
[3:31:35.160 --> 3:31:39.000]  I'm 63 now and feel better than I have in 30 years.
[3:31:39.000 --> 3:31:45.560]  Andro 400, the natural way to increase testosterone, lose belly fat, gain energy, and feel great.

[3:31:59.720 --> 3:32:03.320]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[3:32:03.320 --> 3:32:04.520]  food and boil water.
[3:32:04.520 --> 3:32:08.920]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then
[3:32:08.920 --> 3:32:10.360]  there's a much better way.
[3:32:10.360 --> 3:32:15.160]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities
[3:32:15.160 --> 3:32:16.800]  of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[3:32:16.800 --> 3:32:20.840]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[3:32:20.840 --> 3:32:25.440]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA,

[3:32:29.280 --> 3:32:33.480]  Now there's a proven powerful anti-inflammatory that absorbs 40 times better.
[3:32:33.480 --> 3:32:38.640]  Yes, Nando Percumin Plus from One Planet Nutrition contains smaller particle size that allows

[3:33:13.000 --> 3:33:20.600]  From the Infowars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas and broadcasting
[3:33:20.600 --> 3:33:26.600]  worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[3:33:26.600 --> 3:33:28.600]  technocracy tankover.
[3:33:28.600 --> 3:33:44.920]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[3:33:44.920 --> 3:33:45.920]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:45.920 --> 3:33:49.920]  I'm David Knight, your host and joining us now is Lionel and the award-winning commentator.
[3:33:49.920 --> 3:33:56.080]  And I just saw his clip the other day where he was on House of Cards.
[3:33:56.080 --> 3:34:02.120]  I'm not a House of Cards fan because, actually, surprisingly, I don't like politics.
[3:34:02.120 --> 3:34:06.040]  I follow it very closely because it makes me so angry and because I want to stop it.
[3:34:06.040 --> 3:34:07.920]  But I'm not a big fan of it.
[3:34:07.920 --> 3:34:10.200]  House of Cards is just too much like real life.
[3:34:10.200 --> 3:34:15.120]  But I did suffer through an episode just so I could see Lionel on there, but of course
[3:34:15.120 --> 3:34:20.160]  you can follow him at, I think Lionel, help me here.
[3:34:20.160 --> 3:34:21.160]  Is it at Lionel Media?
[3:34:21.160 --> 3:34:22.160]  Is that your Twitter handle?
[3:34:22.160 --> 3:34:23.160]  I should know this.
[3:34:23.160 --> 3:34:24.160]  Twitter is at Lionel Media.
[3:34:24.160 --> 3:34:29.680]  But more important, what's taking the world by storm, David, is my YouTube channel Lionel
[3:34:29.680 --> 3:34:30.680]  Nation.
[3:34:30.680 --> 3:34:31.680]  Lionel Nation.
[3:34:31.680 --> 3:34:32.680]  Lionel Nation.
[3:34:32.680 --> 3:34:33.680]  On YouTube.
[3:34:33.680 --> 3:34:34.680]  All right.
[3:34:34.680 --> 3:34:35.680]  Great.
[3:34:35.680 --> 3:34:36.680]  There was no immigration problems.
[3:34:36.680 --> 3:34:38.520]  There was no Ninth Circus in Lionel Nation.
[3:34:38.520 --> 3:34:41.120]  Everybody is equally not welcome.
[3:34:41.120 --> 3:34:45.840]  Well, yeah, I want to get your legal opinion here as an attorney.
[3:34:45.840 --> 3:34:48.120]  Let's start with standing, okay?
[3:34:48.120 --> 3:34:50.720]  How do these people have standing, of course?
[3:34:50.720 --> 3:34:51.720]  You don't want to look at this.
[3:34:51.720 --> 3:34:52.720]  Absolutely.
[3:34:52.720 --> 3:34:57.280]  You know, these people are foreign citizens and how do they get to sue in court?
[3:34:57.280 --> 3:35:00.840]  Maybe they're not even here in this country and yet we're being told that they can sue
[3:35:00.840 --> 3:35:01.840]  in court.
[3:35:01.840 --> 3:35:06.920]  And then I looked at the opinion and what he said was we're acting the states, there's
[3:35:06.920 --> 3:35:07.920]  two states that sued.
[3:35:07.920 --> 3:35:11.280]  They were the ones who said that we're going to sue on behalf of these people and they
[3:35:11.280 --> 3:35:12.960]  said they're suing in their role.
[3:35:12.960 --> 3:35:17.600]  This is the lower court judge who stayed the order that was upheld by the Ninth Circuit
[3:35:17.600 --> 3:35:18.600]  yesterday.
[3:35:18.600 --> 3:35:24.360]  He said the states are suing in their role as parents patrie, which is a parents of
[3:35:24.360 --> 3:35:29.080]  the nation, Latin phrase for that, parents of the nation, of the residents living within
[3:35:29.080 --> 3:35:30.080]  their borders.
[3:35:30.080 --> 3:35:32.520]  I thought, well, these are foreign citizens.
[3:35:32.520 --> 3:35:36.720]  And the states themselves, he said, are harmed by damage that the executive order inflicts
[3:35:36.720 --> 3:35:40.280]  upon operations and missions of their public universities.
[3:35:40.280 --> 3:35:43.920]  So this is to support the universities and foreign citizens and what's going on here.
[3:35:43.920 --> 3:35:45.480]  David, I love you.
[3:35:45.480 --> 3:35:47.760]  God, I love you.
[3:35:47.760 --> 3:35:51.360]  My friend, you're not going to believe what I'm going to tell you.
[3:35:51.360 --> 3:35:53.760]  There's nothing wrong with this decision.
[3:35:53.760 --> 3:35:58.440]  There's nothing wrong if they review, if they appeal this decision, it will be upheld.
[3:35:58.440 --> 3:35:59.680]  Nothing wrong with it.
[3:35:59.680 --> 3:36:02.440]  You're looking at something, not you mind you, but a lot of people are jumping in for
[3:36:02.440 --> 3:36:03.440]  the first time.
[3:36:03.440 --> 3:36:08.040]  They're looking at this rodeo and they're looking to go, what the hell, what, standing?
[3:36:08.040 --> 3:36:10.400]  Yes, yes, yes.
[3:36:10.400 --> 3:36:12.040]  Here's what happened.
[3:36:12.040 --> 3:36:13.720]  These people are so smart.
[3:36:13.720 --> 3:36:18.240]  The Ninth Circuit, as they're called, by the way, and a little bit of background, the
[3:36:18.240 --> 3:36:22.400]  ABA in about 2010 did a grading.
[3:36:22.400 --> 3:36:24.920]  There's 13 circuits total.
[3:36:24.920 --> 3:36:29.160]  Remember, district court judges are the trial court and federal court.
[3:36:29.160 --> 3:36:31.080]  That's the first level.
[3:36:31.080 --> 3:36:35.960]  All that is circuit courts of appeal, there's 13 of them, and then the Supreme Court of
[3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:42.680]  the 13, actually 12 plus one, of the 13 at the bottom, at the bottom in terms of most
[3:36:42.680 --> 3:36:49.000]  reversed where the federal circuit, which doesn't really apply, and the Ninth Circuit,
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:51.600]  as they're lovingly referred to.
[3:36:51.600 --> 3:36:53.520]  So they do have a bit of history.
[3:36:53.520 --> 3:36:59.200]  Not to mention, since 1941 or so, there's been a move, David, to break this circuit
[3:36:59.200 --> 3:37:02.760]  up, it's, as Donald Trump would say, huge.
[3:37:02.760 --> 3:37:05.080]  It takes sometimes 18 months to deliver decision.
[3:37:05.080 --> 3:37:09.320]  It's just too many cases, too many states, too few judges.
[3:37:09.320 --> 3:37:13.840]  So that being said, here's what would have been the problem.
[3:37:13.840 --> 3:37:16.040]  There is nothing wrong with what they wrote.
[3:37:16.040 --> 3:37:21.600]  I know, I know, I'm not smoking anything, I'm not drunk, trust me.
[3:37:21.600 --> 3:37:26.960]  What I wanted to know was, which I thought was the most egregious, was how, in the name
[3:37:26.960 --> 3:37:36.680]  of God, would any judge rule that this was a ban on Muslims, number one, or a violation
[3:37:36.680 --> 3:37:45.720]  of the establishment clause, where one particular religion is basically singled out versus another,
[3:37:45.720 --> 3:37:50.240]  irrespective of whether citizens are not, because a lot of these are naturalized citizens
[3:37:50.240 --> 3:37:52.680]  and green cards, and that's not a problem.
[3:37:52.680 --> 3:37:55.760]  But I thought, here's where the problem is.
[3:37:55.760 --> 3:37:56.760]  Work with me on this.
[3:37:56.760 --> 3:38:04.040]  They were going to say, well, Donald Trump said, as candidate Trump, along with his
[3:38:04.040 --> 3:38:10.400]  boy wonder, Rudy Giuliani, they said that Muslims were the problem, that this was going
[3:38:10.400 --> 3:38:14.680]  to be a Muslim ban, and that they were going to make provisions to make exceptions for
[3:38:14.680 --> 3:38:15.680]  Christians.
[3:38:15.680 --> 3:38:16.680]  Uh-huh.
[3:38:16.680 --> 3:38:18.440]  And I thought, that's it.
[3:38:18.440 --> 3:38:25.140]  If these people are stupid enough, stupid enough to base a decision and establishment
[3:38:25.140 --> 3:38:31.720]  clause basis, as striking down this, and by the way, it's very confusing, it's a stay
[3:38:31.720 --> 3:38:33.800]  of the ban.
[3:38:33.800 --> 3:38:38.440]  It's the ban, and then Robart banned the ban, and then these people are going to stay the
[3:38:38.440 --> 3:38:39.440]  ban on the ban.
[3:38:39.440 --> 3:38:40.880]  So it's very, very confusing.
[3:38:40.880 --> 3:38:44.760]  But if I thought, if they do that, they're through their toes, their elbows, they're
[3:38:44.760 --> 3:38:45.760]  finished.
[3:38:45.760 --> 3:38:46.760]  You know what they did?
[3:38:46.760 --> 3:38:48.280]  They were so smart.
[3:38:48.280 --> 3:38:50.600]  They referred to it.
[3:38:50.600 --> 3:38:56.340]  They said, you know, he did mention these things, but we're not going to base the opinion
[3:38:56.340 --> 3:38:59.020]  on that.
[3:38:59.020 --> 3:39:00.520]  So they knew what they were doing.
[3:39:00.520 --> 3:39:02.000]  Now, here's the good news.
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:03.920]  I want everybody to calm down, okay?
[3:39:03.920 --> 3:39:04.920]  Calm down.
[3:39:04.920 --> 3:39:05.920]  I was what?
[3:39:05.920 --> 3:39:08.340]  I swear to you, I don't want to mention any names, but I was watching some characters
[3:39:08.340 --> 3:39:13.640]  on Fox News, and I like a lot of these guys, but I'm wondering, where did, what law universe
[3:39:13.640 --> 3:39:14.720]  are they in?
[3:39:14.720 --> 3:39:16.960]  This is their first bad case they've ever read.
[3:39:16.960 --> 3:39:24.240]  You mentioned Justice Tawny, how about the internment case, we can go down the list.
[3:39:24.240 --> 3:39:25.240]  Okay.
[3:39:25.240 --> 3:39:26.240]  Yeah, Dred Scott, yeah.
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:28.960]  Yeah, we've had the Supreme Court said that there was no First Amendment protection for
[3:39:28.960 --> 3:39:33.120]  movies in the early part of the 20th century, instead of the 50s, you know, whatever.
[3:39:33.120 --> 3:39:35.400]  They've done some ridiculous stuff, but what about Griswold?
[3:39:35.400 --> 3:39:38.480]  Griswold has said that basically adults couldn't use contraception.
[3:39:38.480 --> 3:39:39.480]  I mean, stop it.
[3:39:39.480 --> 3:39:40.480]  Look.
[3:39:40.480 --> 3:39:41.480]  Yeah.
[3:39:41.480 --> 3:39:42.480]  Dred Scott, of course.
[3:39:42.480 --> 3:39:43.480]  Yeah, we got to mention Dred Scott.
[3:39:43.480 --> 3:39:44.480]  Okay.
[3:39:44.480 --> 3:39:45.480]  But listen, that was then this is now.
[3:39:45.480 --> 3:39:51.520]  But I would advise President Trump, I would say, you know how good this is, right?
[3:39:51.520 --> 3:39:55.800]  You're going to now turn to the people politically now, you hate politics and I do too, but politically,
[3:39:55.800 --> 3:39:56.800]  here's what he's going to do.
[3:39:56.800 --> 3:39:57.800]  He's a master of this.
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:00.960]  He's going to say, well, folks, you see what happens?
[3:40:00.960 --> 3:40:02.240]  You see why you need me?
[3:40:02.240 --> 3:40:04.480]  I'm trying to protect you.
[3:40:04.480 --> 3:40:10.480]  I'm trying to protect you and our borders, and these folks decide they're going to strike
[3:40:10.480 --> 3:40:11.480]  me down.
[3:40:11.480 --> 3:40:14.600]  And I love when they say, the commander in chief.
[3:40:14.600 --> 3:40:17.160]  He's only the commander in chief to the military.
[3:40:17.160 --> 3:40:22.080]  He's not my commander in chief and he's not yours because we ain't in the military, but
[3:40:22.080 --> 3:40:26.440]  so what he's going to do is he's going to say, folks, I'm going to need you more now,
[3:40:26.440 --> 3:40:27.440]  more than ever.
[3:40:27.440 --> 3:40:32.360]  And if this were to go to the Supreme Court, remember a couple of things now, what could
[3:40:32.360 --> 3:40:36.600]  happen next is, and I'll get to the punch line, but they could either appeal this to
[3:40:36.600 --> 3:40:45.920]  an en banc ENBANC, the entire 11 judges of the ninth circus as we call it, or eventually
[3:40:45.920 --> 3:40:49.320]  to the Supreme Court, but there's a four four tie.
[3:40:49.320 --> 3:40:51.280]  Remember it's silly and nobody's replacing him.
[3:40:51.280 --> 3:40:56.280]  So now President Trump can look to everybody and say, this is why I need Gorsuch now more
[3:40:56.280 --> 3:40:57.280]  than ever.
[3:40:57.280 --> 3:40:59.480]  Now do you know why this is important?
[3:40:59.480 --> 3:41:01.080]  Now do you know why you need me?
[3:41:01.080 --> 3:41:02.080]  Now do you know?
[3:41:02.080 --> 3:41:03.080]  It's perfect.
[3:41:03.080 --> 3:41:08.720]  In the meantime, and I was saying this from the beginning, and I'm proven right because
[3:41:08.720 --> 3:41:16.080]  my sources and what I'm reading shows me that I thought all their ninth circuit did was give
[3:41:16.080 --> 3:41:23.160]  me, the president, a roadmap as to what I have to do, clean the language up, what you
[3:41:23.160 --> 3:41:24.160]  object to.
[3:41:24.160 --> 3:41:25.160]  Great.
[3:41:25.160 --> 3:41:26.160]  Here comes another one.
[3:41:26.160 --> 3:41:27.160]  Here's another executive order.
[3:41:27.160 --> 3:41:28.160]  You don't like that?
[3:41:28.160 --> 3:41:29.160]  Here's another one.
[3:41:29.160 --> 3:41:34.480]  And another one, and another one, and I'm going to bury you in executive orders.
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:42.840]  You won't be, I want you, the ninth circuit, to tell me I can't issue any more executive
[3:41:42.840 --> 3:41:45.640]  orders because I want a showdown.
[3:41:45.640 --> 3:41:46.640]  Now they do.
[3:41:46.640 --> 3:41:48.080]  Well, what we're in executive order is Lionel.
[3:41:48.080 --> 3:41:52.240]  Let me ask you this because we had on MSNBC, we had Jonathan Turleygo, law professor from
[3:41:52.240 --> 3:41:56.400]  George Washington University, and he doesn't agree with the order.
[3:41:56.400 --> 3:42:00.040]  He said he thought it was a poorly crafted order in addition and it was a terrible rollout,
[3:42:00.040 --> 3:42:01.040]  okay?
[3:42:01.040 --> 3:42:04.400]  But he said, I still think the law favors administration once you get to the merits.
[3:42:04.400 --> 3:42:07.520]  He said, I don't agree with many of those, some of those cases, but the courts have been
[3:42:07.520 --> 3:42:11.280]  highly deferential to the president and they generally don't second guess.
[3:42:11.280 --> 3:42:13.000]  But here's the key thing he said, Lionel.
[3:42:13.000 --> 3:42:17.040]  He said the Obama administration argued the president's judgment on the administration
[3:42:17.040 --> 3:42:20.320]  was largely unreviewable, and they went with that.
[3:42:20.320 --> 3:42:24.320]  Then he argued that he could even refuse or order the failure to enforce immigration
[3:42:24.320 --> 3:42:25.320]  laws.
[3:42:25.320 --> 3:42:30.200]  So all the Democrats objecting now says Jonathan Turley, I didn't hear a peep of objection
[3:42:30.200 --> 3:42:36.320]  from them when just last year these same arguments were being made by the same Justice Department.
[3:42:36.320 --> 3:42:43.400]  So when Obama says, I'm not going to enforce the immigration laws, and I have power here
[3:42:43.400 --> 3:42:45.680]  and it's unreviewable, they're fine.
[3:42:45.680 --> 3:42:48.560]  But then when Trump says, I'm going to enforce immigration laws or I'm going to have some
[3:42:48.560 --> 3:42:50.960]  other tests here, I'm going to more carefully vet these.
[3:42:50.960 --> 3:42:51.960]  No, you can't do that.
[3:42:51.960 --> 3:42:52.960]  You can't do that.
[3:42:52.960 --> 3:42:55.640]  You better calm down, it's right, you're going to lose your mind.
[3:42:55.640 --> 3:42:56.640]  Let me tell you a couple.
[3:42:56.640 --> 3:43:00.840]  Here's my favorite to show you hypocrisy, and that's the part that gets me hypocrisy.
[3:43:00.840 --> 3:43:05.480]  Look, just don't, don't, what's that, don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining.
[3:43:05.480 --> 3:43:06.480]  Look, I understand.
[3:43:06.480 --> 3:43:08.040]  Outlaw Josie Wells, yeah.
[3:43:08.040 --> 3:43:10.680]  Here's my favorite one, just in that line.
[3:43:10.680 --> 3:43:17.960]  How do people say, oh, I declare, I declare Ivanka Trump killing Conway, he's going on
[3:43:17.960 --> 3:43:25.880]  TV, he's violating the ethics rules, praise God, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
[3:43:25.880 --> 3:43:30.560]  Now the same people have said, hey, what about Hillary Clinton?
[3:43:30.560 --> 3:43:33.800]  Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, Clinton Health Access Initiative, what are
[3:43:33.800 --> 3:43:34.800]  you talking about?
[3:43:34.800 --> 3:43:40.800]  Cartel's a server game, but Nordstrom's, okay, fine.
[3:43:40.800 --> 3:43:44.800]  Well, you know what's interesting about that too, again, the double standard Lionel, we
[3:43:44.800 --> 3:43:49.200]  had Michelle Obama go to Subway with a couple of athletes and all the uniformed people behind
[3:43:49.200 --> 3:43:51.080]  her and did a commercial for Subway.
[3:43:51.080 --> 3:43:52.560]  And that was the whole context.
[3:43:52.560 --> 3:43:57.240]  She made her comments in terms of defending Donald Trump's reactions publicly on his
[3:43:57.240 --> 3:43:58.240]  Twitter account.
[3:43:58.240 --> 3:43:59.240]  Yeah.
[3:43:59.240 --> 3:44:02.720]  Remember Bill Gates, Professor Gates and Obama had the beer and he mentioned, this is a good
[3:44:02.720 --> 3:44:05.680]  beer and he mentioned the beer and then Jimmy Carter and Billy Beer.
[3:44:05.680 --> 3:44:06.680]  That's right.
[3:44:06.680 --> 3:44:08.880]  That wasn't good, and Billy Beer, yeah, that's right.
[3:44:08.880 --> 3:44:13.920]  People ban, all right, that doesn't matter, but here's the bottom line.
[3:44:13.920 --> 3:44:18.600]  The way they did it, I mean, if you, by the way, I would, if I were teaching appellate
[3:44:18.600 --> 3:44:24.880]  advocacy at a law school, I would say, listen to this very interesting phone conversation.
[3:44:24.880 --> 3:44:28.080]  And this is not how to appeal the case.
[3:44:28.080 --> 3:44:32.480]  First, first rule, number one, pardon my French.
[3:44:32.480 --> 3:44:36.640]  I think it was Blackstone who said, don't piss the judge off.
[3:44:36.640 --> 3:44:39.760]  Don't tell a judge what he can't do.
[3:44:39.760 --> 3:44:40.760]  Don't dare them.
[3:44:40.760 --> 3:44:47.200]  Oh, by the way, justices, don't you think you have the authority to overthrow or overrule
[3:44:47.200 --> 3:44:49.560]  overthrow, overrule the king?
[3:44:49.560 --> 3:44:51.320]  Oh, please stop it.
[3:44:51.320 --> 3:44:53.240]  They should have crafted it.
[3:44:53.240 --> 3:44:56.280]  All they had to do was simply do it differently.
[3:44:56.280 --> 3:45:01.640]  But David, let me reiterate for the millions and millions of people who are watching us
[3:45:01.640 --> 3:45:02.640]  now.
[3:45:02.640 --> 3:45:03.640]  Okay.
[3:45:03.640 --> 3:45:09.480]  Now, do you realize that if 90% of all of your internet capabilities went out, you would
[3:45:09.480 --> 3:45:15.880]  still beat MSDNC by 10,000%, okay.
[3:45:15.880 --> 3:45:19.880]  What's going to happen is the course, Trump knows exactly what he's doing.
[3:45:19.880 --> 3:45:23.120]  He's going to say, I'm going to give you another one, and I'm going to give you another executive
[3:45:23.120 --> 3:45:24.120]  order.
[3:45:24.120 --> 3:45:28.440]  Now, here's something which is very interesting, and remember, let's be true, a theoretical
[3:45:28.440 --> 3:45:32.920]  purist here, David, just because we may like Trump or, and by the way, I didn't vote for
[3:45:32.920 --> 3:45:33.920]  him.
[3:45:33.920 --> 3:45:34.920]  I voted for me.
[3:45:34.920 --> 3:45:40.240]  I'm standing up for, I'm, I'm finding myself in a strange way, David, defending him more
[3:45:40.240 --> 3:45:45.800]  often because what's being thrown at him is absolutely absurd.
[3:45:45.800 --> 3:45:48.720]  So people think, boy, I never knew you were such a Trump fan.
[3:45:48.720 --> 3:45:53.600]  It's like I'm defending not him per se, but this insanity.
[3:45:53.600 --> 3:45:54.600]  Yeah.
[3:45:54.600 --> 3:45:59.360]  Like the Nordstrom, Ivanka stuff and, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[3:45:59.360 --> 3:46:03.880]  I'm not crazy about this guy, you know, Mnuchin and these others, and he was talking about
[3:46:03.880 --> 3:46:08.920]  the torture, and I mean, we'll get to that in a moment, but look, he still works for
[3:46:08.920 --> 3:46:12.920]  me and he better do a good job for me, but we'll get to that in a moment.
[3:46:12.920 --> 3:46:18.000]  But as far as this goes, the whole notion, David, explain this one to me.
[3:46:18.000 --> 3:46:23.760]  If I said, let's say you were the president, president, the night, with all due respect,
[3:46:23.760 --> 3:46:27.000]  sir, where do you get these seven countries from?
[3:46:27.000 --> 3:46:28.000]  What is this?
[3:46:28.000 --> 3:46:29.600]  Why not Saudi Arabia?
[3:46:29.600 --> 3:46:30.600]  Why not?
[3:46:30.600 --> 3:46:31.600]  And here's the irony.
[3:46:31.600 --> 3:46:33.840]  This is a part, another talk about irony.
[3:46:33.840 --> 3:46:39.120]  These people will say, this was a Muslim ban once, it goes, it's not a Muslim ban.
[3:46:39.120 --> 3:46:46.000]  If you want to ban Muslims, ban Muslims, say it, but he didn't, or mention all the Muslim
[3:46:46.000 --> 3:46:48.720]  countries like Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.
[3:46:48.720 --> 3:46:51.840]  So I would ask people, I would say, let me get this straight.
[3:46:51.840 --> 3:46:54.600]  You're upset because he didn't ban?
[3:46:54.600 --> 3:46:57.200]  You want him to ban more?
[3:46:57.200 --> 3:47:02.360]  You're upset with the fact that he's banning Muslims because he didn't ban enough?
[3:47:02.360 --> 3:47:05.000]  Would you, because they didn't even know what they're saying.
[3:47:05.000 --> 3:47:06.000]  So-
[3:47:06.000 --> 3:47:09.000]  Well, that's a good point right there, Lionel, because he said that the seven countries,
[3:47:09.000 --> 3:47:13.280]  and I'm reading from the arguments that they said, they've been targeted because they quote
[3:47:13.280 --> 3:47:18.040]  have significant terrorist presence and they were safe havens for terrorism.
[3:47:18.040 --> 3:47:22.480]  And it was Barack Obama that went to war with these seven countries, okay?
[3:47:22.480 --> 3:47:26.480]  We're dropping bombs on them, we're sending troops in, and so if they're not dangerous,
[3:47:26.480 --> 3:47:31.040]  why isn't the left saying, let's stop the war, instead of bringing in the immigrants?
[3:47:31.040 --> 3:47:36.160]  These are saying you're talking about people who live in these countries versus, look,
[3:47:36.160 --> 3:47:44.240]  let me tell you something, do you really think, David, these people give a damn about Muslims
[3:47:44.240 --> 3:47:45.240]  and immigration?
[3:47:45.240 --> 3:47:50.680]  I mean, do you really think, look, let's assume, God forbid, that troubles in Northern Ireland
[3:47:50.680 --> 3:47:51.680]  were up again.
[3:47:51.680 --> 3:47:54.160]  They would say, you're banning Catholics, aren't you?
[3:47:54.160 --> 3:47:57.360]  I'm not banning Catholics, you missed the point.
[3:47:57.360 --> 3:48:01.120]  Yeah, I'm banning people who are dropping, pulling up buildings, yeah.
[3:48:01.120 --> 3:48:04.600]  Let's assume after the mafia, you know, and we're going after Italians, and no, that's
[3:48:04.600 --> 3:48:05.600]  not it.
[3:48:05.600 --> 3:48:15.320]  Look, these people are sworn to stop this president over everything he does.
[3:48:15.320 --> 3:48:20.600]  Did you see the other day at the Washington Post, they must be saying, hey, boss, I've
[3:48:20.600 --> 3:48:24.080]  got an idea, can I write it, do it.
[3:48:24.080 --> 3:48:25.480]  Don't you want to hear the story?
[3:48:25.480 --> 3:48:26.480]  No, write it!
[3:48:26.480 --> 3:48:28.000]  Just write it!
[3:48:28.000 --> 3:48:31.760]  Keep shoveling the coal into this runaway train.
[3:48:31.760 --> 3:48:35.480]  They had an article that Trump's a bad misspeller.
[3:48:35.480 --> 3:48:36.480]  What?
[3:48:36.480 --> 3:48:37.480]  Print it!
[3:48:37.480 --> 3:48:38.480]  What else do you got?
[3:48:38.480 --> 3:48:41.600]  He walks around in a bathrobe, print it, next!
[3:48:41.600 --> 3:48:43.360]  They don't care what it is.
[3:48:43.360 --> 3:48:46.960]  They don't care what this is.
[3:48:46.960 --> 3:48:50.960]  And what they're also doing, which is the most important and the most critical to understand
[3:48:50.960 --> 3:48:57.200]  right now is that this has nothing to do with anything that these people care about, terrorism
[3:48:57.200 --> 3:48:58.680]  or Muslims or whatever.
[3:48:58.680 --> 3:48:59.680]  They don't care about that.
[3:48:59.680 --> 3:49:02.040]  Look, bottom line is simply this.
[3:49:02.040 --> 3:49:07.440]  He is going to, he just scored beautifully in this.
[3:49:07.440 --> 3:49:13.360]  You can't, I mean, look what this guy's done every single day.
[3:49:13.360 --> 3:49:15.480]  He has more executive orders.
[3:49:15.480 --> 3:49:16.720]  Let me just say about that.
[3:49:16.720 --> 3:49:20.680]  By the way, before we get too complacent about this, I'm not crazy about executive
[3:49:20.680 --> 3:49:21.680]  orders.
[3:49:21.680 --> 3:49:22.920]  I don't like PDDs.
[3:49:22.920 --> 3:49:26.920]  I don't like signing statements.
[3:49:26.920 --> 3:49:30.800]  I don't like, if you go back in this notion of the unitary executive, this goes way back,
[3:49:30.800 --> 3:49:34.120]  not way back, but it was really big during Cheney and Addington's days.
[3:49:34.120 --> 3:49:35.120]  Oh yeah, I agree.
[3:49:35.120 --> 3:49:37.520]  I would like to see the legislature do more.
[3:49:37.520 --> 3:49:40.080]  They've abdicated their authority not only to the executive branch.
[3:49:40.080 --> 3:49:43.960]  They also abdicated it to the judicial branch, but even more importantly, they've abdicated
[3:49:43.960 --> 3:49:44.960]  it to the bureaucracies.
[3:49:44.960 --> 3:49:46.520]  They let the bureaucracies write the rules.
[3:49:46.520 --> 3:49:49.600]  I mean, when Nacey Pelosi said we got to pass it so we can find out what's in it, they
[3:49:49.600 --> 3:49:53.360]  were just giving broad authority to these bureaucracies and the bureaucracies are going
[3:49:53.360 --> 3:49:56.600]  to come up with the devils and the details for everybody.
[3:49:56.600 --> 3:49:57.600]  That's the real issue.
[3:49:57.600 --> 3:49:58.600]  Let me give you another one for you.
[3:49:58.600 --> 3:49:59.600]  This is going to blow your mind.
[3:49:59.600 --> 3:50:01.200]  I'm a lawyer by profession, right?
[3:50:01.200 --> 3:50:06.240]  Licensed lawyer, trial lawyer, and I do all kinds of trial work, personally to be criminal.
[3:50:06.240 --> 3:50:10.600]  Here's one that I came up with the other day and I saw this and it was a case involving
[3:50:10.600 --> 3:50:14.000]  somebody who was an illegal alien, illegal.
[3:50:14.000 --> 3:50:22.520]  I mean illegal, not somebody who overstayed or somebody who was the child of an, no, I
[3:50:22.520 --> 3:50:26.840]  mean somebody who is as illegal as you can get.
[3:50:26.840 --> 3:50:32.680]  Who basically gets hurt, soothes her personal injury, gets a decent settlement and now wants
[3:50:32.680 --> 3:50:36.760]  to enforce it and you're thinking, what?
[3:50:36.760 --> 3:50:37.760]  Wait a minute.
[3:50:37.760 --> 3:50:38.760]  What?
[3:50:38.760 --> 3:50:48.000]  Wait a minute and if you were to dare, dare bring up this fact or dare involve yourself
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:52.480]  in maybe threatening him with any kind of action, you could be looking at perhaps contempt
[3:50:52.480 --> 3:50:53.480]  of court.
[3:50:53.480 --> 3:50:54.480]  Yeah.
[3:50:54.480 --> 3:50:55.480]  Amazing.
[3:50:55.480 --> 3:50:56.480]  We'll talk more about that when we come back.
[3:50:56.480 --> 3:50:57.480]  Stay with us and be right back with Lionel.
[3:50:57.480 --> 3:51:00.320]  We got to take a quick break.
[3:51:00.320 --> 3:51:02.880]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[3:51:02.880 --> 3:51:05.000]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[3:51:05.000 --> 3:51:07.200]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[3:51:07.200 --> 3:51:09.200]  Paying your happiness with pure soap.
[3:51:09.200 --> 3:51:13.960]  These all natural, earth-friendly pure soaps are the very best you've ever used.
[3:51:13.960 --> 3:51:14.960]  Buy in bulk.

[3:51:20.520 --> 3:51:24.760]  You're getting soap products twice as good as what you're using now, earth-friendly and
[3:51:24.760 --> 3:51:26.040]  natural soaps.
[3:51:26.040 --> 3:51:28.120]  Your family deserves the best.

[3:51:59.600 --> 3:52:00.600]  I'm Chris Walton.
[3:52:00.600 --> 3:52:01.600]  I'm a truck driver from Missouri.
[3:52:01.600 --> 3:52:04.600]  For 13 hours a night, I sit in my truck and I drive.
[3:52:04.600 --> 3:52:06.160]  On a boredom, I'll stop and eat.
[3:52:06.160 --> 3:52:09.920]  If I'm not doing fast food, I guarantee there's a bag of chips open on my dashboard.
[3:52:09.920 --> 3:52:11.520]  That was all until Andro 400.
[3:52:11.520 --> 3:52:16.240]  I started out four months ago and since taking Andro 400, I have dropped 45 pounds.
[3:52:16.240 --> 3:52:17.240]  I'm sleeping better.
[3:52:17.240 --> 3:52:18.240]  There's no cravings.
[3:52:18.240 --> 3:52:19.880]  I actually don't even think about food.
[3:52:19.880 --> 3:52:21.280]  My knee pain went away.
[3:52:21.280 --> 3:52:26.240]  I've had some lower back issues and I've noticed that that went away and I can only contribute
[3:52:26.240 --> 3:52:28.160]  that to Andro 400.
[3:52:28.160 --> 3:52:31.680]  One thing that Andro 400 said on the radio ad is it attacks belly fat.
[3:52:31.680 --> 3:52:32.800]  Well, let me tell you did.
[3:52:32.800 --> 3:52:37.760]  The second month is where I saw a drastic change in the size of my stomach.
[3:52:37.760 --> 3:52:39.160]  I've lost six inches.
[3:52:39.160 --> 3:52:40.720]  This product really does work.

[3:53:58.320 --> 3:54:20.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, David Knight, and we're talking to Lionel, an attorney,
[3:54:20.320 --> 3:54:23.760]  and talk show host, and of course you can find his new YouTube channel.
[3:54:23.760 --> 3:54:28.040]  I don't know if it's new, but I want you to take a look at Lionel Nation.
[3:54:28.040 --> 3:54:30.160]  You can find him on Twitter, at Lionel Media.
[3:54:30.160 --> 3:54:33.600]  We're going to go back to Lionel in just a moment, but before we do, I want to quickly
[3:54:33.600 --> 3:54:38.160]  remind you that we have Roger Stone's book, The Making of a President at 20% off.
[3:54:38.160 --> 3:54:44.880]  That's our introductory pricing at InfowarsStore.com, 20% off the introductory pricing on Making
[3:54:44.880 --> 3:54:46.720]  of the President by Roger Stone.
[3:54:46.720 --> 3:54:51.080]  Also, Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is now back in stock after being sold out
[3:54:51.080 --> 3:54:52.920]  for months at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:54:52.920 --> 3:54:54.640]  I tried it last night for the first time.
[3:54:54.640 --> 3:54:59.040]  The first time I was able to get my hands on it, and I thought it was great.
[3:54:59.040 --> 3:55:02.440]  And I've talked to everybody I've talked to in the office, loves it as well.
[3:55:02.440 --> 3:55:08.720]  It's got peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, tea tree oil, things that are going to combat
[3:55:08.720 --> 3:55:13.320]  bacteria in your mouth that are going to help your gums be healthy.
[3:55:13.320 --> 3:55:16.960]  And if you don't have healthy gums, if you've got a lot of bacteria in your gums and they
[3:55:16.960 --> 3:55:19.320]  tend to collect there, they can get in your bloodstream.
[3:55:19.320 --> 3:55:22.480]  They can give you blood clots, heart attacks, heart disease.
[3:55:22.480 --> 3:55:27.000]  It's a key issue in terms of protecting your health, and it's getting rid of that harmful
[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:29.920]  bacteria that sets up in your gums and lids there.
[3:55:29.920 --> 3:55:34.360]  So the nano silver, the iodine, the tea tree oil, all those things, and the peppermint oil
[3:55:34.360 --> 3:55:35.360]  is great tasting.
[3:55:35.360 --> 3:55:37.680]  They even have a kid's flavor, which I haven't tried.
[3:55:37.680 --> 3:55:39.800]  It's a bubble gum, but I loved the other one.
[3:55:39.800 --> 3:55:44.800]  Very fresh tasting when you use it, and a lot of great, healthy ingredients in that.
[3:55:44.800 --> 3:55:47.160]  Now it's now back in stock at InfowarsLife.com.
[3:55:47.160 --> 3:55:51.600]  Lionel, I want to go back to the thing that we started here with the standing, because
[3:55:51.600 --> 3:55:55.240]  I thought something that was interesting came out by Japan Times talking about the same
[3:55:55.240 --> 3:56:00.920]  Judge Robart in Washington, and of course that's where Microsoft is.
[3:56:00.920 --> 3:56:07.280]  And Microsoft had a case where they're protesting the fact that the Justice Department wants
[3:56:07.280 --> 3:56:11.460]  to get information of Microsoft's customers, and Microsoft wants to tell them that the
[3:56:11.460 --> 3:56:16.560]  Justice Department is looking at you and is put in order for your information.
[3:56:16.560 --> 3:56:22.120]  And this judge, Judge Robart, said, well, okay, I agree that you have a First Amendment
[3:56:22.120 --> 3:56:28.160]  right to speak to your customers, but as a third party, Microsoft can't assert constitutional
[3:56:28.160 --> 3:56:29.720]  rights for someone else.
[3:56:29.720 --> 3:56:32.600]  And we go back to look at this case at the same judge.
[3:56:32.600 --> 3:56:38.840]  He's saying that these states who are acting as parents of the nation have the ability,
[3:56:38.840 --> 3:56:42.720]  I don't see how they've got any more connection to these foreign citizens than Microsoft does
[3:56:42.720 --> 3:56:44.240]  to its customers to stand.
[3:56:44.240 --> 3:56:49.640]  Well, a couple of things here, first, let me just say I concur on Roger Stone's book
[3:56:49.640 --> 3:56:50.640]  as well.
[3:56:50.640 --> 3:56:57.280]  This is a barn burner, a stem whiner, and a page turner.
[3:56:57.280 --> 3:56:58.600]  I love him.
[3:56:58.600 --> 3:56:59.600]  I mean, I was-
[3:56:59.600 --> 3:57:02.240]  You know, it's where the skeletons are buried, doesn't it?
[3:57:02.240 --> 3:57:06.600]  Oh, put it this way, you don't want him as your enemy.
[3:57:06.600 --> 3:57:12.680]  Look, I will tell you things, and I'm reading this, and I suggest everything.
[3:57:12.680 --> 3:57:17.280]  In fact, I did two videos on Lionel Nation, you can read them, and I went through it step
[3:57:17.280 --> 3:57:18.280]  by step.
[3:57:18.280 --> 3:57:19.960]  I went through this case.
[3:57:19.960 --> 3:57:25.800]  It's not very long, but I went through the standing, and the issue is simply this.
[3:57:25.800 --> 3:57:32.320]  Do you- does the state of Minnesota- does the state of Washington- do they have an actual
[3:57:32.320 --> 3:57:33.320]  standing?
[3:57:33.320 --> 3:57:36.960]  Do they have a- do they suffer?
[3:57:36.960 --> 3:57:39.400]  And they said, yes.
[3:57:39.400 --> 3:57:40.680]  How's that?
[3:57:40.680 --> 3:57:41.680]  Our university.
[3:57:41.680 --> 3:57:44.280]  Yeah, there we go back to the universities again.
[3:57:44.280 --> 3:57:45.280]  Okay, fine.
[3:57:45.280 --> 3:57:46.280]  Whatever.
[3:57:46.280 --> 3:57:50.160]  Listen, standing, if standing- let me tell you we're standing.
[3:57:50.160 --> 3:57:51.160]  This is the best one ever.
[3:57:51.160 --> 3:57:52.160]  I gotta tell you this quick story.
[3:57:52.160 --> 3:57:57.360]  Remember New Dau years ago, there was a case of the father who objected to his kid saying
[3:57:57.360 --> 3:57:58.360]  under God?
[3:57:58.360 --> 3:57:59.360]  It was a ninth circuit.
[3:57:59.360 --> 3:58:00.360]  Oh, yeah.
[3:58:00.360 --> 3:58:01.360]  Remember this?
[3:58:01.360 --> 3:58:02.360]  Under God.
[3:58:02.360 --> 3:58:03.360]  Michael New Dau, the atheist-
[3:58:03.360 --> 3:58:04.360]  That's right.
[3:58:04.360 --> 3:58:05.360]  And he was offended.
[3:58:05.360 --> 3:58:06.360]  Okay, fine.
[3:58:06.360 --> 3:58:11.360]  And ninth circuit, I thought was spot on because I'm against- I think under God is unconstitutional.
[3:58:11.360 --> 3:58:12.360]  For a host of reasons.
[3:58:12.360 --> 3:58:14.840]  I don't want to go into it because it's a law.
[3:58:14.840 --> 3:58:17.360]  The Pledge of Allegiance is a law which most people don't know.
[3:58:17.360 --> 3:58:18.360]  Anyway-
[3:58:18.360 --> 3:58:19.360]  You got 20 seconds, Lionel.
[3:58:19.360 --> 3:58:22.200]  Okay, so the Supreme Court granted cert.
[3:58:22.200 --> 3:58:25.920]  When it went, they said, guess what, New Dau, you don't have standing because your kid
[3:58:25.920 --> 3:58:26.920]  doesn't live with you.
[3:58:26.920 --> 3:58:29.360]  They granted cert and then punted on standing.
[3:58:29.360 --> 3:58:30.360]  Yeah.
[3:58:30.360 --> 3:58:31.360]  So standing drives people-
[3:58:31.360 --> 3:58:33.040]  They waive it as they wish.
[3:58:33.040 --> 3:58:34.040]  That's Lionel.
[3:58:34.040 --> 3:58:35.040]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[3:58:35.040 --> 3:58:37.040]  You can find him at Lionel Nation on YouTube.
[3:58:37.040 --> 3:58:38.040]  Thank you, Lionel.
[3:58:38.040 --> 3:58:43.040]  Thank you.
