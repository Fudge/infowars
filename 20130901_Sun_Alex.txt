[00:00:52.717 --> 00:00:55.099]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:55.099 --> 00:01:00.524]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:01:07.518 --> 00:01:11.899]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:17.381]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:01:17.381 --> 00:01:20.922]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is the
[00:01:26.364 --> 00:01:32.048]  First day of September 2013 as you listen to this worldwide transmission.
[00:01:32.048 --> 00:01:41.774]  And I am normally live here on Sundays, but we are taking off a little bit of time to actually work on Obama Deception 2, to be quite frank with you.
[00:01:41.774 --> 00:01:46.437]  The woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have miles to go before I sleep.
[00:01:46.437 --> 00:01:50.199]  But part of this transmission will be original.
[00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:50.799]  It will be virgin.
[00:01:52.347 --> 00:02:06.690]  It will be a maiden voyage in the last three segments of the second hour coming up today because I had a chance to interview Friday night just a little while ago.
[00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.991]  As I said, I'm recording this on Friday night.
[00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:10.551]  Russell Brand.
[00:02:10.551 --> 00:02:11.932]  A lot of you probably heard of him.
[00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:17.333]  He is a very fast rising movie star, TV host, and a comic.
[00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:25.689]  And he's really been shaking things up, calling the media a bunch of narcissistic, basically mentally ill fools.
[00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.651]  And I had heard from David Icke that he was a listener, so we contacted him.
[00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:34.715]  Turned out he was a follower of me on my little Twitter account, Real Alex Jones.
[00:02:35.865 --> 00:02:43.767]  And so I contacted him on his Twitter that's got six million plus followers and said, hey, we'd like to catch you on.
[00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:48.769]  And boom, he came on and he says when he comes to Austin in a few weeks, we'll be able to do a video interview.
[00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:49.489]  So that should be interesting.
[00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.230]  People say, oh, why do we care about that?
[00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.570]  Well, he's a smart guy.
[00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.651]  He's getting people to think outside the box.
[00:02:54.651 --> 00:03:04.414]  And he's really, you know, awakened a lot from purely Marxist type ideas to a more libertarian view is what I got from the interview that you will be hearing.
[00:03:05.154 --> 00:03:08.397]  Because when I did it earlier today, it was only myself and the crew that heard it.
[00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:09.758]  Very small audience.
[00:03:09.758 --> 00:03:12.160]  But you will be hearing it by the millions coming up.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.261]  And I think it was very informative.
[00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:29.856]  And then, the best part is, all of Russell Brand's hundreds of millions of fans around the world will then, many of them, tune in to this radio broadcast and to see the video of the interview that we will be posting up on Infowars.com after the show today.
[00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:37.137]  Uh, so that they can then hear him not being interrupted, uh, by petty issues.
[00:03:37.137 --> 00:03:39.959]  Only interrupted by other serious questions.
[00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.301]  So, that is coming up.
[00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:51.169]  Don't worry, the signature, trademark, interruptions, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, uh, will be, uh, brought to you by the speech impediment master, Alex Jones.
[00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.451]  I don't really have that, but I wish I did.
[00:03:53.451 --> 00:03:55.913]  So, ladies and gentlemen, that is coming up.
[00:03:55.913 --> 00:03:56.534]  Now, um,
[00:03:57.722 --> 00:04:03.507]  It doesn't really matter that I'm saying this, but it's interesting.
[00:04:03.507 --> 00:04:08.272]  If there is a big strike on Syria, you will be hearing me this Sunday, so you'll never hear this tape.
[00:04:08.272 --> 00:04:10.254]  This is all for naught.
[00:04:10.254 --> 00:04:18.942]  But obviously, if you are hearing it, there's a little inside baseball of how we're pre-planning things and how hard we work here at TheInfoWars.com studios.
[00:04:18.942 --> 00:04:22.706]  If Obama, for face-saving, only cruise missiles and a few military outposts,
[00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:24.439]  I don't
[00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:46.567]  He will be live doing three hours of the show.
[00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:51.710]  I will be here at the office working on the bomb deception too, as I have been about seven days a week as of late.
[00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.411]  Best film, most powerful film ever made.
[00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:54.371]  It's unbelievable.
[00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:55.832]  I mean, just how it exposes this thing.
[00:04:55.832 --> 00:04:58.053]  It's the Rosetta Stone of understanding this tyranny.
[00:04:58.053 --> 00:04:59.134]  So that's coming up.
[00:04:59.134 --> 00:05:09.519]  But we've got a still boiled down to the most important World War III, the potential World War III news of the week with Greg Pallast, Dr. Jerome Corsi, Dr. Paul Greg Roberts.
[00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:12.120]  That's all coming up from those interviews this week.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.901]  Boiled down.
[00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:18.466]  And then you get the, again, maiden voyage of my interview with Russell Brandt.
[00:05:18.466 --> 00:05:33.521]  And again, if we win the culture wars to wake up people that have once been the princes of trendiness and now they're the princes of mass awakening, we are certainly beginning to win the culture war for free humanity against the bored, collectivist, globalist.
[00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:34.583]  So we're going to go to break.
[00:05:35.183 --> 00:05:43.791]  For now, though, my friends, I've got to leave you with the original transmission until Russell Brand joins us in about an hour and 15 minutes from now.
[00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:46.554]  But next, Dr. Jerome Corsi, straight ahead.
[00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:47.435]  It's September 1st, 2013.
[00:05:47.435 --> 00:05:48.255]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:00.774 --> 00:06:02.859]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:10.415]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[00:06:13.102 --> 00:06:15.824]  50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[00:06:15.824 --> 00:06:18.006]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[00:06:18.006 --> 00:06:24.410]  If every one of us who can will take care of ourselves, we can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:32.635]  The new Just In Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[00:06:32.635 --> 00:06:38.980]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.182]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.
[00:06:41.182 --> 00:06:44.086]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[00:06:44.086 --> 00:06:46.408]  Order two or more, get 10% off, free shipping applies.
[00:06:46.408 --> 00:06:49.412]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:14.591]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:07:14.591 --> 00:07:22.017]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:22.017 --> 00:07:25.399]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:27.221]  We're here Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:27.721]  to 2 p.m.
[00:07:27.721 --> 00:07:28.101]  Central.
[00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:30.683]  Back Sundays live 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:36.528]  But this is a retransmission for part of the broadcast today because the information was so important this week.
[00:07:37.088 --> 00:07:47.952]  Breaking down the confusing mess that is the Middle East, and then a premiere interview that I taped Friday with the top comedian, movie star, you name it, Russell Brand on a host of political issues.
[00:07:47.952 --> 00:07:49.172]  It's powerful.
[00:07:49.172 --> 00:07:55.455]  We're going to premiere it in the last three segments of the second hour, coming up in about an hour and 15 minutes.
[00:07:55.455 --> 00:07:57.295]  So stay with us for that.
[00:07:57.295 --> 00:08:01.457]  First up, Dr. Jerome Corsi of WorldNetDaily.
[00:08:01.457 --> 00:08:03.958]  You cannot get a better political mind on what's happening in the Middle East.
[00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:15.626]  With bombshell info about the nuclear threat, the World War III threat, posed if this expansion of the war gets out of hand by Obama.
[00:08:15.626 --> 00:08:18.488]  Excuse me, that's illegal in America to talk about the President.
[00:08:18.488 --> 00:08:19.869]  We don't have a First Amendment anymore.
[00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:24.732]  I meant our Lord, our King, our dear leader, Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un.
[00:08:24.732 --> 00:08:25.692]  I meant Obama.
[00:08:25.692 --> 00:08:26.133]  Here it is.
[00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:28.871]  This is unprecedented.
[00:08:28.871 --> 00:08:29.611]  Here's the headline.
[00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:06.252]  Dr. Corsi, how big is this that they're doing this and that they don't have support?
[00:09:06.252 --> 00:09:13.953]  Bush had 72% in Gallup polls and Pew had 72% in 2003.
[00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:21.715]  I think this is the total collapse of credibility, but it's kind of like Hitler wasn't supported at the end either, but he was still in control of the Reich.
[00:09:21.715 --> 00:09:22.675]  What are we seeing here?
[00:09:22.675 --> 00:09:23.815]  And break down this bombshell.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:40.121]  Well, first of all, Alex, the article we've got running on world.dailywnd.com right now, as you say, I went yesterday and researched, checked with the Arabic-speaking sources, Waleed Chobat, who helped write the article.
[00:09:41.182 --> 00:09:55.022]  There's numerous videos on the internet and in the Arabic-speaking world that make it clear the rebels are the ones who have launched the sarin gas attacks, not the Assad government.
[00:09:55.768 --> 00:09:58.449]  Now, the Assad government is not a great government.
[00:09:58.449 --> 00:10:01.671]  I mean, there's no good guys in Syria.
[00:10:01.671 --> 00:10:04.032]  But the point is, the truth is the truth.
[00:10:04.032 --> 00:10:12.096]  And I think the attempt by the Obama administration, which now appears to be the second time the Obama administration has tried this.
[00:10:12.096 --> 00:10:16.219]  It was the narrative being run out of the White House back in May.
[00:10:17.119 --> 00:10:21.363]  That the Assad government was launching chemical attacks.
[00:10:21.363 --> 00:10:24.666]  But the problem is that there's no validation of it.
[00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.207]  There's no hard proof.
[00:10:26.207 --> 00:10:30.851]  John Kerry, Secretary of State, said yesterday he has indisputable proof.
[00:10:30.851 --> 00:10:32.132]  Well, let's see it.
[00:10:33.095 --> 00:10:34.797]  Why don't we see this proof?
[00:10:34.797 --> 00:10:36.619]  It's not there.
[00:10:36.619 --> 00:10:47.132]  Even the United Nations, going back to May, doubted very seriously that the Assad regime, as bad as it is, was going to use sarin gas attacks.
[00:10:47.132 --> 00:10:49.114]  As you said, it does not make any sense.
[00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:56.283]  Why, when the Assad government's winning, would it resort to sarin gas attacks?
[00:10:56.283 --> 00:11:13.457]  And with video after video, with testimony after testimony coming out of the Arab world, in Syria it's widely known that it's the rebels, which are a group of Al-Qaeda, Muslim Brotherhood, ragtag radicals.
[00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:14.569]  That's
[00:11:30.917 --> 00:11:33.838]  Gas and the other chemicals coming from Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:33.838 --> 00:11:43.861]  I mean, it seems to me that if the Obama administration is going to go to war on Syria, which is what this means, a very massive step.
[00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:51.603]  I can't emphasize to people listening how much we are on the verge here of World War III.
[00:11:51.603 --> 00:11:53.404]  Russia and China are not going to sit by
[00:11:54.184 --> 00:12:11.750]  If Obama thinks he can wag the dog to get attention off of his other problems or run a false flag here, it isn't going to fly with Russia and China saying to Obama, you don't have the evidence and we're not going to tolerate a military attack.
[00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:17.251]  Very, very succinctly said, Dr. Corsi, I want to break something down.
[00:12:17.251 --> 00:12:21.432]  You have never talked like this in the decade that I've been interviewing you or more.
[00:12:21.432 --> 00:12:27.293]  And I've talked to a lot of other top people on and off air about this.
[00:12:27.293 --> 00:12:30.133]  Colonel Schaefer is one of them, but many others off record.
[00:12:30.133 --> 00:12:33.434]  And they all are saying exactly what you're saying.
[00:12:33.434 --> 00:12:35.355]  And it's so transparent.
[00:12:35.355 --> 00:12:37.455]  How does Obama think he's going to get away with this?
[00:12:38.291 --> 00:12:43.935]  Well, again, I think the Obama administration has gotten to the point where they think they can lie with impunity.
[00:12:43.935 --> 00:12:46.137]  Certainly, that's what this appears to be.
[00:12:46.137 --> 00:12:51.962]  And, you know, Alex, I don't think we've been in a more critical moment since the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:12:51.962 --> 00:12:59.848]  Now, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Jack Kennedy had photographs of the missiles from U-2 flights over Cuba.
[00:12:59.848 --> 00:13:02.010]  And Jack Kennedy showed those to the world.
[00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:06.974]  He went to the United Nations and he said, here's the pictures of the missiles in Cuba.
[00:13:07.634 --> 00:13:09.015]  Obama has not done that.
[00:13:09.015 --> 00:13:19.262]  Obama has not presented to the American people or to the UN his evidence of the Assad regime being involved in the sarin gas attacks.
[00:13:19.262 --> 00:13:32.551]  And you've got Assad denying it, you've got Russia denying it, you've got China denying it, all of them with logic on their side, and we publish at WND the videos where you can see with your own eyes
[00:13:33.211 --> 00:13:40.237]  The terrorists, the rebels, the forces Obama is supporting being the culprits in the gas attacks.
[00:13:40.237 --> 00:13:41.638]  I want to make a couple of points.
[00:13:41.638 --> 00:13:51.787]  One, first of all, people have got to realize that Russia and China are not borrowing a trillion dollars a year to make their budget.
[00:13:51.787 --> 00:13:52.868]  We are.
[00:13:52.868 --> 00:13:57.993]  We're in a vastly weakened economic position and the world knows it.
[00:13:57.993 --> 00:13:58.513]  Secondly,
[00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:07.177]  Well, where American public opinion is right now is not in favor of a military action, and I don't see it changing quickly.
[00:14:07.177 --> 00:14:14.541]  Now, let's say we have a cruise missile attack or we have a bomber attack over Syria.
[00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:27.927]  If we get involved in a shooting war, not just with Syria, but with Russia, or with Russia and China, the ramifications of that are unpredictable and unpredictably frightening.
[00:14:28.735 --> 00:14:51.712]  Because if Russia and China say to the United States, you can't sustain a war economically, and you're on the wrong side here, and if Russia and China stand behind Assad, which they are doing, we are moving, we're escalating the whole conflict beyond the level of surrogates into where we're risking a direct confrontation with Russia, certainly with Russia.
[00:14:51.712 --> 00:14:57.677]  And giving them the moral high ground, which history shows you cannot win a immoral war long term.
[00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:10.387]  Well, where is, you know, at least with Jack Kennedy in the White House, he sent Adlai Stevenson, who was the UN ambassador to the UN, and he showed the pictures of the missiles in Cuba.
[00:15:11.331 --> 00:15:12.912]  Today we don't have a single thing.
[00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:18.075]  By the way, they're coming out with this new dossier, but I expect that to be more, you know, phony baloney as well.
[00:15:18.075 --> 00:15:19.296]  What are you expecting?
[00:15:19.296 --> 00:15:21.997]  Remember, we've had, we've gone through this.
[00:15:21.997 --> 00:15:25.579]  The left is, the publicity here is amazing to me.
[00:15:25.579 --> 00:15:29.342]  When it was George W. Bush saying there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[00:15:30.242 --> 00:15:36.185]  The left, John Kerry, Barack Obama, were all over the issue, saying it was a lie.
[00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:43.949]  And now, you've got Obama and Kerry using the same lie to advance what could end up being another phony pretext for a phony war.
[00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:46.991]  I think the American people can see through this.
[00:15:46.991 --> 00:15:48.271]  Sure, we've got one minute left.
[00:15:48.271 --> 00:15:51.073]  Bottom line, what do you expect to happen in your gut?
[00:15:51.073 --> 00:15:56.516]  My gut is that the Obama administration is so far out on the limb they're going to attack and we're going to come to the edge of World War III.
[00:15:57.839 --> 00:15:59.281]  Unfortunately, I agree with you.
[00:15:59.281 --> 00:16:03.365]  I hope everybody's saying their prayers for their children tonight.
[00:16:03.365 --> 00:16:05.367]  People better understand how serious this is.
[00:16:05.367 --> 00:16:10.513]  It's been one of the most serious moments in world history that we have ever faced.
[00:16:10.513 --> 00:16:15.439]  And they're all doing it because these power-mad control freaks that run Washington think they're invincible.
[00:16:16.281 --> 00:16:25.885]  And Obama does not want us talking about the IRS scandal with the Tea Party groups or the NSA eavesdropping on... Or Benghazi.
[00:16:25.885 --> 00:16:27.225]  Or Benghazi.
[00:16:27.225 --> 00:16:32.587]  Or the fact that we're again out of money and spending another trillion dollars we don't have on an out-of-control budget.
[00:16:32.587 --> 00:16:34.128]  Obama doesn't want these topics.
[00:16:34.128 --> 00:16:37.129]  Doctor, we're going to have to get updates from you every day if we can do it.
[00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:38.229]  I know you've got to go.
[00:16:38.229 --> 00:16:39.670]  Please join us again tomorrow.
[00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.571]  I know you're on top of this like no one else.
[00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:42.191]  Thank you so much.
[00:16:42.631 --> 00:16:44.113]  Thanks Alex, great to be with you.
[00:16:44.113 --> 00:16:48.898]  Wow, man, I just, I thought I'd tuck my kids in tonight twice and kiss them twice.
[00:16:48.898 --> 00:16:50.960]  I mean, I hate the New World Order!
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.844]  These people are the greatest threat to civilization!
[00:16:53.844 --> 00:16:55.506]  We've got to stop these people!
[00:16:55.506 --> 00:16:57.288]  We'll be right back, stay with us.

[00:18:03.983 --> 00:18:09.486]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[00:18:09.486 --> 00:18:17.231]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:18:17.231 --> 00:18:26.317]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:18:26.537 --> 00:18:33.684]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[00:18:33.684 --> 00:18:36.586]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[00:18:36.586 --> 00:18:42.552]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[00:18:43.212 --> 00:18:43.812]  War.
[00:18:43.812 --> 00:18:45.133]  Oh, there's another one!
[00:18:45.133 --> 00:18:46.394]  Another plane just hit!

[00:21:04.784 --> 00:21:07.986]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:21:16.138 --> 00:21:17.259]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:21:17.259 --> 00:21:19.460]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:21:30.074 --> 00:21:32.076]  I wanted to get Dr. Roberts on today.
[00:21:32.076 --> 00:21:35.738]  He wrote a story that's at paulcraigroberts.org.
[00:21:35.738 --> 00:21:38.020]  And we also have it up on InfoWars.com.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.842]  Syria, another Western war crime in the making.
[00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:41.983]  Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:21:41.983 --> 00:21:46.306]  And I wanted to get the former head of policy at the Treasury, father of Reaganomics.
[00:21:47.446 --> 00:21:57.870]  on to give a truly conservative perspective on this and to ask him is it good news that only 9% of Americans in a Reuters poll agree with us?
[00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:05.452]  I think this is the collapse of support and it really shows we have a rogue state kleptocracy in there.
[00:22:05.452 --> 00:22:08.774]  A, but B, does he think they'll go ahead and strike?
[00:22:08.774 --> 00:22:11.795]  Dr. Corsi believes they will and it may cause World War III.
[00:22:11.795 --> 00:22:13.215]  Dr. Roberts, thanks for coming on.
[00:22:13.215 --> 00:22:14.696]  Pleased to be with you, Alex.
[00:22:14.696 --> 00:22:15.276]  Break it down.
[00:22:16.365 --> 00:22:17.846]  Well, they're going to strike.
[00:22:17.846 --> 00:22:20.308]  And of course, it was not done by Assad.
[00:22:20.308 --> 00:22:23.630]  It was staged by the Americans and the Israelis.
[00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.352]  We've known this from the beginning.
[00:22:25.352 --> 00:22:31.736]  The minute that Obama said there was a line drawn, we knew they were going to have a false flag event.
[00:22:32.677 --> 00:22:47.675]  The fact that the American people are finally caught on or tired of these wars that don't serve their purposes doesn't matter because Washington now is no longer accountable except to a few powerful private interests.
[00:22:47.675 --> 00:22:49.877]  So I think it will go ahead.
[00:22:50.678 --> 00:23:03.684]  I don't think nuclear war will result because of this strike, but it's going to result because what the United States is doing, they're radicalizing the Muslims.
[00:23:03.684 --> 00:23:08.206]  It's a way of destabilizing both Russia and China.
[00:23:08.206 --> 00:23:11.728]  Russia has large Muslim populations.
[00:23:11.728 --> 00:23:14.329]  It's bordered by numerous Muslim countries.
[00:23:14.329 --> 00:23:17.471]  China has some Muslim populations and borders.
[00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:26.397]  And so as this radicalization of Muslims spreads, it spreads into these two countries and becomes destabilizing for them.
[00:23:26.397 --> 00:23:35.123]  And as well, the United States has inside Russia hundreds of non-governmental organizations funded with American money.
[00:23:36.043 --> 00:23:53.857]  Whose purpose is to destabilize Russia, to demand liberalization, which is really a way of creating dissenting voices, arousing the different nationality passions of the peoples in Russia.
[00:23:53.857 --> 00:23:54.838]  The same in China.
[00:23:54.838 --> 00:24:00.783]  In China, every time an American company locates a new plant or a bank branch,
[00:24:01.583 --> 00:24:24.664]  In China they create a board and they put on this board the Chinese relatives of the local and regional party officials and so that board becomes a way of, it's a conduit for money into the regional and local Communist Party and it creates loyalties that put them at odds with the central government.
[00:24:24.664 --> 00:24:25.265]  So it's a global
[00:24:25.305 --> 00:24:25.726]  That's true.
[00:24:43.587 --> 00:24:55.297]  I think the only thing that may stop it is the military itself quietly leaking information, sabotaging things in a peaceful way, kind of blocking what's going on.
[00:24:55.297 --> 00:25:07.467]  And that's why you see such a focus on persecuting whistleblowers, because the kleptocrats that have seized control of our central government seem to be concerned about that.
[00:25:07.467 --> 00:25:09.309]  So I think that shows that that may be a weakness.
[00:25:10.339 --> 00:25:15.424]  Well, you know, Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, has warned against it.
[00:25:15.424 --> 00:25:19.809]  But I think on the whole, the military is unable to do anything.
[00:25:19.809 --> 00:25:22.812]  What they would have to do would be simply to have a coup.
[00:25:22.812 --> 00:25:25.815]  But actually, the war serves the purpose of the military.
[00:25:25.815 --> 00:25:27.957]  It serves a military security complex.
[00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:33.025]  They go along, get along generals when they retire.
[00:25:33.025 --> 00:25:37.471]  They either get to be Pentagon consultants or they become lobbyists.
[00:25:37.471 --> 00:25:41.016]  Sure, but it's not going to serve them if we go totally bankrupt and there's a nuclear war.
[00:25:42.671 --> 00:25:45.593]  I know, but everybody thinks about their interests.
[00:25:45.593 --> 00:25:46.694]  Who's looking after me?
[00:25:46.694 --> 00:25:48.195]  This is my chance.
[00:25:48.195 --> 00:25:50.116]  I can't rock the boat.
[00:25:50.116 --> 00:26:03.006]  So it becomes very hard for the military to do something that's actually against the short-run interests of all of the members in the higher ranks.
[00:26:03.006 --> 00:26:06.068]  So I don't know that we can count on the military stopping it.
[00:26:07.372 --> 00:26:10.519]  They haven't stopped any of the other wars.
[00:26:10.519 --> 00:26:12.062]  Why do you think they're going ahead with this now?
[00:26:12.062 --> 00:26:13.706]  To distract from all the scandals?
[00:26:13.706 --> 00:26:16.753]  To try to get Iran to get involved?
[00:26:16.753 --> 00:26:17.875]  So they can have a wider war?
[00:26:19.069 --> 00:26:30.692]  Well, you know, it's part of the neoconservative document that they put out and General Wesley Clark has reported he was shown the same thing when he visited the Pentagon.
[00:26:30.692 --> 00:26:40.675]  So I think what it's really about is the United States was going to pull off in Syria exactly the same scenario it used in Libya.
[00:26:40.675 --> 00:26:46.137]  Only this time the Russians and the Chinese vetoed the no-fly zone because they
[00:26:46.537 --> 00:26:54.222]  They had learned that the no-fly zone was actually something the Americans and NATO used for attacking Qaddafi's forces.
[00:26:54.222 --> 00:26:55.142]  So they vetoed it.
[00:26:55.142 --> 00:27:08.890]  So the Americans, Washington, had already instigated the outside jihadists going into Syria to overthrow the secular president, and yet there was no air support.
[00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:12.773]  And so the American-backed forces, the Washington-backed forces, are being defeated.
[00:27:13.982 --> 00:27:19.970]  And so they've got to find some way to come to the aid of the forces.
[00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:24.996]  And so that's what this chemical weapons false flag attack is all about.
[00:27:24.996 --> 00:27:30.323]  It gives Washington an excuse to run in there and rescue the forces that it sent to work.
[00:27:31.124 --> 00:27:37.168]  Sir, Joel Skousen, who does World Affairs Brief, has been very accurate in his analysis, as have you, Ben.
[00:27:37.168 --> 00:27:59.683]  He believes that the Anglo-American power structure is trying to get Russia and China to start a nuclear war, and that they believe, out of that global crisis, they'll be able to create a new police state here, roll out some of the space-based weapons they've got to defeat them, and finally have world domination, and that this is truly a megalomaniacal thing that's happening.
[00:27:59.683 --> 00:28:00.544]  What's your take on that?
[00:28:02.185 --> 00:28:07.008]  Well, we already have a police state, they already have that, and nobody survives nuclear war.
[00:28:07.008 --> 00:28:09.870]  I mean, there won't be any survivors.
[00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:13.192]  So I think that that's an incorrect analysis.
[00:28:16.394 --> 00:28:24.217]  If you and I can see the end of this, and he can see the end of it, and everybody else I talk to that's intelligent can see the end of it, what is the power structure thinking then?
[00:28:24.217 --> 00:28:27.638]  If they don't want World War III, why are they trying to start it?
[00:28:27.638 --> 00:28:33.881]  Or are they so arrogant, like Don Corzine making 40 to 1 bets in the stock market, that they just think they're invincible?
[00:28:34.795 --> 00:28:43.941]  Well, they probably are full of hubris, and they're full of the ideology that they're indispensable and exceptional, but they're also counting on winning.
[00:28:43.941 --> 00:28:47.963]  They're counting on their strategy of destabilizing Russia and China working.
[00:28:47.963 --> 00:28:51.586]  I mean, Washington does have fifth columns in both countries.
[00:28:52.246 --> 00:29:00.410]  And so if radicalizing the Muslim populations causes more instability, then Washington says we can win.
[00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:03.311]  So they're banking on winning without the nuclear war.
[00:29:03.311 --> 00:29:08.394]  But what they're overlooking is that that's the only weapons that China and Russia would have to stop this.
[00:29:08.394 --> 00:29:11.855]  So I think it would come out, we'll all be simply destroyed.
[00:29:11.855 --> 00:29:13.176]  It'd be the end of life on Earth.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.042]  And they also like to use the radical Muslims they're flooding the U.S.
[00:29:18.042 --> 00:29:23.505]  and Europe with as another way to destabilize and then take all our liberties from the threat they literally created.
[00:29:23.505 --> 00:29:31.929]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, folks can read your columns on your site and syndicated around the web on places like InfoWars.com, PaulCraigRoberts.org.
[00:29:31.929 --> 00:29:33.650]  Thank you so much for your analysis.
[00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:34.931]  Pleased to talk to you.
[00:29:34.931 --> 00:29:35.591]  Well, there you go.
[00:29:35.591 --> 00:29:40.294]  There's the father of Reaganomics, listed as one of the top ten economists in the world by Forbes magazine.
[00:29:40.984 --> 00:29:45.508]  You're telling us that we're probably going to end up in the next few years and not sooner have nuclear war and we're all dead.
[00:29:45.508 --> 00:29:54.475]  And Don Corzine and Blank Fine are by just doesn't care because they've just got trillions they've stolen and they're just they're all just got jet copters and 20 mattresses and they're invincible.
[00:30:00.711 --> 00:30:03.713]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.

[00:34:31.646 --> 00:34:32.710]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:49.808]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back here on this Sunday Transmission playing some of the most important clips of the weekday broadcast.
[00:34:49.808 --> 00:34:52.551]  Coming up, Russell Brand premiere interview I did Friday night.
[00:34:52.551 --> 00:34:56.875]  That's coming up to be exclusively premiered here on the Sunday Transmission.
[00:34:56.875 --> 00:34:59.077]  But first off, I want to go back to the day before.
[00:35:00.158 --> 00:35:17.033]  The last clip you heard with Dr. Corsi when he was getting into the Muslim Brotherhood connection to Obama, and I've researched this myself, this is just bombshell info about how treacherous this federal government has gotten, led by this globalist, Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:35:17.033 --> 00:35:19.375]  So, here's a key clip with Dr. Corsi.
[00:35:20.106 --> 00:35:33.056]  All right, I wanted to get, for the balance of the hour, Dr. Jerome Corcyon, because I saw an article he did for WND.com, WorldNetDaily, last Friday, about Obama's connections to his cousins in the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:35:33.056 --> 00:35:42.043]  Well, Odinga was made to be the Prime Minister after they rioted and killed people all over the country, and Obama's senatorial emails are public, where he advised him how to do it.
[00:35:42.043 --> 00:35:44.045]  So, yes, Obama is Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:35:44.545 --> 00:35:46.906]  But from my research, but that's another cover.
[00:35:46.906 --> 00:35:48.246]  They're just manipulating that group.
[00:35:48.246 --> 00:35:59.389]  So I want to segue into that briefly, then get Dr. Corsi, because he's worked in security in the Middle East as a contractor to the State Department and other things, get his take on where all this is going.
[00:35:59.389 --> 00:36:03.550]  And the chemical attack that I think all the evidence shows was a false flag.
[00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:05.350]  Dr. Corsi has a Ph.D.
[00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:06.931]  from Harvard University in political science.
[00:36:07.871 --> 00:36:17.180]  And he's currently a senior writer for WorldNetDaily, and he's got a whole bunch of number one New York Times bestsellers, and we'll tell you about those as well.
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.863]  But Dr. Corsi, we're going to break in about two minutes.
[00:36:19.863 --> 00:36:27.510]  Briefly, what is your take on the situation with all this Muslim Brotherhood news coming out and Obama's family?
[00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:38.116]  Well, I think the bottom line is that the Egyptian government, the current government, the military, have decided to out the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:36:38.116 --> 00:36:39.658]  They're prosecuting the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:36:39.658 --> 00:36:52.466]  In the process, they want the world to know that the Obama administration is very tightly tied to the Muslim Brotherhood, including in financial ties to the Obama family.
[00:36:52.466 --> 00:36:57.650]  So, the news we're going to talk about is news that WND got
[00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:05.218]  When it was released by the Egyptian government asking for the United States press to pick up the story.
[00:37:07.116 --> 00:37:07.696]  Wow.
[00:37:07.696 --> 00:37:09.878]  And you've written quite a few articles on this.
[00:37:09.878 --> 00:37:11.679]  The latest I saw was on Friday.
[00:37:11.679 --> 00:37:12.719]  We should check WorldNetDaily.
[00:37:12.719 --> 00:37:13.840]  Is there a new article out?
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.920]  And give us the headline.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.241]  We'll put that on screen.
[00:37:16.241 --> 00:37:34.831]  Well, I have a new article out right now today that argues from some sources in the Middle East that the intention of the Egyptian government when these trials begin for the Muslim Brotherhood is to implicate President Obama directly.
[00:37:34.831 --> 00:37:35.632]  That's bombshell.
[00:37:36.391 --> 00:37:41.044]  In a series of financial transactions with the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
[00:37:42.449 --> 00:38:09.076]  The Egyptian government sent out the head of the, it was the Vice President for the Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt, her name was Tahani al-Jibali, and she gave a speech and then several interviews in Egyptian television in which she said she wanted the American people to know that President Obama's brother was managing the money of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
[00:38:09.946 --> 00:38:15.487]  And that brother we've identified as Malik Obama, who is in Kenya.
[00:38:15.487 --> 00:38:20.008]  But what Jabali said was very important.
[00:38:20.008 --> 00:38:31.090]  She said, we want to inform the American people that their president's brother Obama is one of the architects of the major investments of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
[00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:32.470]  We will carry out the law.
[00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:34.730]  The Americans will not stop us.
[00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:38.391]  We need to open the files and begin court sessions.
[00:38:39.175 --> 00:38:43.378]  She said further that the Obama administration knows they've supported terrorism.
[00:38:43.378 --> 00:38:52.964]  We're going to open these files so the nations know the truth and the Obama administration is exposed that they have collaborated with terrorists.
[00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:56.286]  And it's this reason that the administration fights us.
[00:38:56.286 --> 00:39:05.692]  So this is a clear attempt by the Egyptian government to out and embarrass the Obama administration for supporting the Egyptian Brotherhood in Egypt.
[00:39:06.291 --> 00:39:09.693]  You know, I don't just believe what they say.
[00:39:09.693 --> 00:39:11.914]  I've done so much research like you have.
[00:39:11.914 --> 00:39:15.615]  I know his cousin Odinga was the treasurer for the Brotherhood.
[00:39:15.615 --> 00:39:17.456]  They burned half the country down.
[00:39:17.456 --> 00:39:19.497]  Obama advised him in emails, as you know.
[00:39:19.497 --> 00:39:21.218]  I want you to give people some history.
[00:39:21.218 --> 00:39:23.059]  So this all fits.
[00:39:23.059 --> 00:39:30.162]  He and his family would become like the offshore dictators of the Middle East with the Muslim Brotherhood funneling them all the money.
[00:39:30.882 --> 00:39:31.983]  My gosh!
[00:39:31.983 --> 00:39:33.404]  Now it makes sense.
[00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:35.546]  Because these aren't just allegations from Egypt.
[00:39:35.546 --> 00:39:40.149]  When I was reading your article, I'm like, wait, this has come out before in this country.
[00:39:40.149 --> 00:39:42.271]  This has come out before in Sudan.
[00:39:42.271 --> 00:39:44.052]  It's come out before in Kenya.
[00:39:44.052 --> 00:39:45.673]  And then it all clicked.
[00:39:45.673 --> 00:39:50.157]  They're going to burn down the Middle East and hand it all over to themselves as a mafia.
[00:39:50.157 --> 00:39:51.438]  This is unbelievable.
[00:39:51.438 --> 00:39:52.759]  And then the magnitude
[00:39:54.099 --> 00:40:03.546]  Of the Egyptian military turning against it, defending the Christians, CNN calling them when they killed 25 cops, calling them activists, that CNN's involved in this.
[00:40:03.546 --> 00:40:09.990]  Am I right in saying that if this all comes out, Dr. Corsi, this could bring down this criminal faction of the New World Order?
[00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:14.594]  You've got the floor, give us the history, all of it, how big this is, do you agree with what I just said?
[00:40:15.094 --> 00:40:16.635]  Well, I think you're right, Alex.
[00:40:16.635 --> 00:40:18.316]  Let's detail some of it.
[00:40:18.316 --> 00:40:29.563]  I mean, the article I published over the weekend, which shows a document in it, an Egyptian government document that we got out of the Middle East, WND.
[00:40:29.563 --> 00:40:40.130]  And what this is, is it's a government document listing from the Minister of Foreign Affairs the names of Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt.
[00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:45.013]  And the amount in bribes that they were paid in U.S.
[00:40:45.013 --> 00:40:49.937]  dollars by the Obama administration with the money sent through the U.S.
[00:40:49.937 --> 00:40:58.824]  Embassy in Cairo, the money paid over to the Morsi government, to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and then handed out
[00:40:59.485 --> 00:41:03.288]  to this list of Muslim Brotherhood leaders.
[00:41:03.288 --> 00:41:06.450]  And they came in, the Muslim Brotherhood leaders, and signed for the money.
[00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:07.871]  It's a receipt.
[00:41:07.871 --> 00:41:14.016]  The amounts of money paid are up to $850,000 a year.
[00:41:14.016 --> 00:41:15.977]  And this is an authenticated document.
[00:41:15.977 --> 00:41:26.645]  It's going to be presented at the trials of the Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo, alleging that these Muslim Brotherhood leaders are spies
[00:41:27.426 --> 00:41:37.032]  Working for Obama, being paid by the Obama administration, and here's the documentary evidence of it, which we have in advance of the trial through our sources in Cairo.
[00:41:37.032 --> 00:41:37.872]  It's incredible.
[00:41:37.872 --> 00:41:50.580]  I mean, it's a list of the Muslim Brotherhood bad guys being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars off the books by the United States government, the Obama administration, through our embassy in Cairo.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.502]  Paid via the Morsi government.
[00:41:54.502 --> 00:42:00.567]  This document was obtained when the Morsi government was deposed and the military went in and occupied the offices.
[00:42:00.567 --> 00:42:03.669]  This is unbelievable.
[00:42:03.669 --> 00:42:07.232]  Is this why they're trying to ratchet up the Syria thing right now as a distraction?
[00:42:07.232 --> 00:42:09.994]  And what do you expect them to do to try to cover this up?
[00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:17.740]  And how are things going for the Democratic, Socialist, Communist wing of the New World Order in their takeover of the Middle East?
[00:42:18.223 --> 00:42:37.047]  Well, this is going to be explosive because the Egyptian government has announced in the newspapers, and we even cite the newspapers in the Middle East, this newspaper Al-e Sarun, which published in Egypt over the weekend, that this document existed and was going to be introduced at the trials of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:42:37.247 --> 00:42:45.912]  And the Egyptian government has come out and said they want to expose the Obama administration's ties to terrorists, namely the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
[00:42:45.912 --> 00:42:52.775]  Remember, the Muslim Brotherhood, before the Morsi government came in, was outlawed under Mubarak in Egypt.
[00:42:52.775 --> 00:42:54.536]  It was an outlaw organization.
[00:42:54.536 --> 00:43:01.320]  When Morsi came in, won the election, brought in the Muslim Brotherhood, Obama celebrated it.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.621]  He said this was a positive development.
[00:43:03.621 --> 00:43:04.562]  Now it turns out,
[00:43:05.222 --> 00:43:12.016]  That Obama had been paying, the administration had been paying Muslim Brotherhood under the table.
[00:43:12.952 --> 00:43:24.736]  Through our embassy in Cairo with the cooperation, we even have the receipt with the signed signatures on it of the Muslim Brotherhood members that got paid these hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes.
[00:43:24.736 --> 00:43:34.819]  Now this document is going to be an explosive document all through the Middle East because it puts the Obama administration on the side of the Muslim Brotherhood terrorists under the table.
[00:43:34.819 --> 00:43:38.760]  I mean, this makes things like Iran-Contra pale.
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:49.932]  Insignificance compared to the magnitude of this behavior, which when fully documented, I think is going to lead to treason charges.
[00:43:49.932 --> 00:43:53.395]  I mean, I think it's of that magnitude.
[00:43:53.395 --> 00:43:56.979]  All right, folks, we'll be back with more with Dr. Jerome Corsi on Alex Jones.
[00:44:01.081 --> 00:44:08.843]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.

[00:45:09.824 --> 00:45:17.547]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[00:45:17.547 --> 00:45:26.672]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[00:45:26.872 --> 00:45:34.020]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.

[00:45:45.452 --> 00:45:46.573]  Another plane just hit!

[00:48:08.532 --> 00:48:14.335]  Hey, I'll show you politics in America.
[00:48:14.335 --> 00:48:16.796]  Here it is, right here.
[00:48:16.796 --> 00:48:19.478]  I think the puppet on the right shares my beliefs.
[00:48:19.478 --> 00:48:23.600]  I think the puppet on the left is more to my liking.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.801]  Hey, wait a minute!
[00:48:24.801 --> 00:48:26.682]  There's one guy holding up both puppets!
[00:48:26.682 --> 00:48:27.942]  Shut up!
[00:48:27.942 --> 00:48:29.343]  Go back to bed, America.
[00:48:29.343 --> 00:48:30.684]  Your government is in control.
[00:48:32.867 --> 00:48:37.760]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.184]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:48:41.246 --> 00:48:42.326]  And we are back live.
[00:48:42.326 --> 00:48:54.791]  I want to play a little bit more of this just astonishingly important information that is now coming out in federal court in Egypt with the government, formerly allies with this country, stabbed in the back by Obama.
[00:48:54.791 --> 00:49:00.392]  Al-Qaeda allowed to murder police, military, blow up churches by the hundreds, get away with everything.
[00:49:00.392 --> 00:49:02.773]  And now their own government bringing out the documents.
[00:49:02.773 --> 00:49:05.534]  And they posted them on the news site WorldNetDaily.
[00:49:05.534 --> 00:49:07.375]  We have them on Infowars.com as well.
[00:49:07.375 --> 00:49:10.356]  This is just so insane.
[00:49:11.901 --> 00:49:15.205]  That our government's trying to put Al-Qaeda in all over the Middle East.
[00:49:15.205 --> 00:49:18.048]  Let's go back to the conclusion of this information.
[00:49:18.048 --> 00:49:19.049]  Then we'll go to break.
[00:49:19.049 --> 00:49:20.430]  Stations will have the news.
[00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:22.072]  We'll come back with a second hour.
[00:49:22.072 --> 00:49:23.733]  Russell Brandt and more.
[00:49:23.733 --> 00:49:24.835]  Greg Palast as well.
[00:49:24.835 --> 00:49:30.661]  But here's the conclusion of Dr. Jerome Corsney and Obama selling us out to the Muslim Jihadis.
[00:49:31.653 --> 00:49:33.735]  All right, Doc, we got you.
[00:49:33.735 --> 00:49:35.076]  How does this tie into Benghazi?
[00:49:35.076 --> 00:49:38.159]  Because we know there was a cover up there of the missiles being transferred.
[00:49:38.159 --> 00:49:42.363]  We know elements of the government did not want to back Al-Qaeda.
[00:49:42.363 --> 00:49:49.410]  It looks like that Obama and his controllers may be running a rogue operation, and if so, who is behind it?
[00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:50.491]  I mean, it's not just Obama.
[00:49:50.911 --> 00:50:01.155]  Well, let's first deal with Benghazi, because we reported, WND reported, and we've been working with Waleed Chobat, who is also published alongside WND.
[00:50:01.155 --> 00:50:02.896]  Waleed is one of our sources.
[00:50:02.896 --> 00:50:05.077]  He's former PLO, Arabic-speaking.
[00:50:05.077 --> 00:50:09.519]  And you remember in Benghazi, when we ran WND, those clips.
[00:50:10.399 --> 00:50:18.330]  of the latecomers, the second wave of the attack of the terrorists on the Benghazi compound.
[00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:21.775]  And when they entered, they said, don't shoot at us.
[00:50:21.775 --> 00:50:23.497]  We are on your side.
[00:50:23.497 --> 00:50:25.079]  We're from Egypt.
[00:50:25.079 --> 00:50:26.321]  Morsi sent us.
[00:50:27.142 --> 00:50:32.644]  And in fact, even if you can't speak Arabic, you can hear them say Morsi, because Morsi was the guy.
[00:50:32.644 --> 00:50:41.308]  Now this is Egyptian terrorists in Libya attacking our embassy in Benghazi.
[00:50:41.308 --> 00:50:54.554]  Now, we at that time had put it together with the idea that the Muslim Brotherhood, which was behind the attacks from Egypt on Benghazi, were angling to try to, with the Morsi government,
[00:50:55.305 --> 00:50:58.827]  Get Obama to release the blind sheik.
[00:50:58.827 --> 00:51:09.792]  And we have not ruled out yet that one of the theories behind the Benghazi attack was to kidnap Ambassador Stevens and exchange him for the blind sheik.
[00:51:09.792 --> 00:51:18.035]  And it seems like this was kind of a behind-the-scenes, back-room deal between the Obama administration, perhaps the CIA, and
[00:51:20.097 --> 00:51:26.764]  The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt operating with full sanction of the Egyptian government under Morsi.
[00:51:26.764 --> 00:51:36.754]  But it would mean that, in a sense, we ourselves through the CIA may have been responsible for the attack and that we were supporting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt.
[00:51:37.495 --> 00:51:42.839]  That I sent terrorists to Benghazi in Libya to attack the embassy.
[00:51:42.839 --> 00:51:44.201]  That's pretty incredible stuff.
[00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:45.001]  Well, exactly.
[00:51:45.001 --> 00:51:58.312]  I mean, I had one of those moments, that's why I brought up Benghazi, where it all crystallized and I saw that triangle from Kenya and what's already been on record and what your book exposed with the documents, with Odinga and Obama and emails.
[00:51:58.312 --> 00:52:00.774]  We'll just have riots and they'll make you part of the government.
[00:52:00.774 --> 00:52:03.376]  And then you see worldwide what's going on.
[00:52:03.376 --> 00:52:04.337]  This is what I want to ask you.
[00:52:04.417 --> 00:52:10.339]  We know the big banks are behind Obama, the globalist, but geopolitically, I look at what's going on, there's something else there.
[00:52:10.339 --> 00:52:12.260]  Who do you think Obama really works for?
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:22.123]  Well, I mean, I think it's hard to say, but I mean, first, your idea about money motives, that there's money motives here, I think is quite right.
[00:52:22.123 --> 00:52:27.564]  Because, you know, you've got Obama's brother now managing the money of the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:52:27.564 --> 00:52:31.966]  Don't forget that terrorism is big business, that there's a lot of money involved here.
[00:52:32.586 --> 00:52:33.887]  A lot of money being stolen.
[00:52:33.887 --> 00:52:35.808]  Look at that list of bribes.
[00:52:35.808 --> 00:52:38.830]  The bribes are being paid $850,000 a year, $750,000 a year.
[00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:41.692]  Individually, yeah.
[00:52:41.692 --> 00:52:42.433]  Individually.
[00:52:42.433 --> 00:52:44.894]  That's a lot of money in the Middle East to get $850,000.
[00:52:44.894 --> 00:52:48.677]  It's a lot of money anywhere to get $850,000.
[00:52:48.677 --> 00:52:53.500]  Income tax-free, unrecorded, just here's the cash in your pocket.
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:53:01.206]  Which is the way the Muslim Brotherhood was being paid the cash through the Morsi government after it received the cash from the State Department.
[00:53:02.006 --> 00:53:14.690]  But I want to go to one of your other points also here, Alex, because what it looks like is that the Obama administration is trying to pin these nerve gas attacks on Assad.
[00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:22.352]  Now, Russia has said increasingly that, you know, there's no evidence that the Assad government is behind these nerve gas attacks.
[00:53:23.072 --> 00:53:30.257]  I think the truth is that the evidence is very, very thin that the Assad government can be blamed for these attacks.
[00:53:30.257 --> 00:53:31.678]  I know there's a drum roll.
[00:53:31.678 --> 00:53:33.639]  Obama's now got the U.N.
[00:53:33.639 --> 00:53:36.541]  in inspecting, but it's equal probability.
[00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:42.085]  And I think it's pretty good evidence that maybe it's the rebels that we're backing
[00:53:42.765 --> 00:53:45.948]  Who may have launched the nerve attacks.
[00:53:45.948 --> 00:53:49.251]  And again, that question's not yet, but you asked what's the false flag.
[00:53:49.251 --> 00:53:53.475]  I mean, clearly, if we can have an invasion of Syria with the U.S.
[00:53:53.475 --> 00:54:04.345]  military forces involved or cruise missile attacks, it takes the headlines away from the Obama administration paying the Muslim Brotherhood under the carpet through the embassy in Cairo.
[00:54:04.505 --> 00:54:07.167]  But I mean, look, I know there's corrupt forces in the government.
[00:54:07.167 --> 00:54:10.190]  It's an empire and it wants to take over and all the rest of this.
[00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:13.313]  But there's a lot of evidence Israel's working with these rebels as well.
[00:54:13.313 --> 00:54:16.235]  You've got France really cheerleading when they're usually on the sidelines.
[00:54:16.235 --> 00:54:18.377]  I want to get your take on why that is.
[00:54:18.377 --> 00:54:21.740]  And I've had a bunch of special forces and military call in last hour.
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.803]  They said, yes, what you're saying is exactly what we see going on.
[00:54:24.803 --> 00:54:25.784]  But it's been on record.
[00:54:25.784 --> 00:54:30.469]  You've got these extremists being staged at bases in Iraq and in Turkey.
[00:54:30.469 --> 00:54:32.771]  You've had Turkey bombarding them with artillery.
[00:54:32.771 --> 00:54:35.975]  This is a two and a half year attempt to cut that country up.
[00:54:35.975 --> 00:54:41.140]  And look, if they took Assad out and put some real Republican, I'd say, OK, whatever.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:42.382]  But that's unconstitutional.
[00:54:42.882 --> 00:54:44.864]  This is so immoral!
[00:54:44.864 --> 00:54:58.956]  How does Washington and NATO think they're going to get away with turning that country, or half of it, over to Al-Qaeda when they're pulling over truck drivers who aren't Wahhabists and shooting them in the head on video, cutting Christians' heads off, blowing up every church?
[00:54:58.956 --> 00:55:06.802]  I mean, I really take it personal that the churches, the media, even conservative media, are not standing up for one of the oldest Christian communities in the world.
[00:55:07.803 --> 00:55:21.133]  And that CNN's helping cover it up, it makes me realize, man, there's really some weird hatred of Christians, not just by the Wahhabist, but by the so-called liberals who are really, who really are more criminal than I thought.
[00:55:21.133 --> 00:55:22.253]  These are sick freaks!
[00:55:22.253 --> 00:55:23.835]  I mean, who are these people?
[00:55:23.835 --> 00:55:25.596]  Why do they want to do this?
[00:55:25.596 --> 00:55:29.699]  And remember, one of the early purposes, we've been reporting on this at WND all along,
[00:55:30.854 --> 00:55:37.884]  What Ambassador Stevens was doing in Benghazi, and now it appears clear, that was a CIA compound.
[00:55:37.884 --> 00:55:41.469]  There were CIA operatives on the ground that night.
[00:55:41.469 --> 00:55:47.357]  The last meeting that Stevens had was dinner with one of the diplomatic representatives from Turkey.
[00:55:48.158 --> 00:56:02.025]  It looks like the whole purpose of that compound was to run weapons out of Libya via Turkey to get them into the hands... Sure, we both had that info a week after it happened and now it's been confirmed, which just shows how this is all an open secret.
[00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:02.966]  That's my point!
[00:56:02.966 --> 00:56:04.787]  No one seems to care to hide it anymore!
[00:56:05.447 --> 00:56:08.912]  And also, you know, there are no good guys in this story.
[00:56:08.912 --> 00:56:18.446]  The rebels that Obama wants to support are fundamentally Al Qaeda and many of them come from Libya after having attacked our embassy.
[00:56:18.446 --> 00:56:20.949]  Remember, Alex, no one has ever been
[00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:25.894]  Identified by the Obama Administration as responsible for the Benghazi attack.
[00:56:25.894 --> 00:56:31.679]  Oh yeah, they say it's a protest over our First Amendment and then they arrest the guy that put out the video that's protected.
[00:56:31.679 --> 00:56:33.160]  He's the only guy in jail.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:41.948]  There's nobody, none of the attackers after all these months are in jail in any country in Northern Africa for the Benghazi attack.
[00:56:42.408 --> 00:57:06.179]  Alright, well listen, I agree with you that if this gets out, this is bigger than Benghazi altogether, and Benghazi's part of it, but the media is so controlled, they call people rocket launchers and tanks, activists and protesters, and then criticize the Egyptian military, which I'm not in some love fest with them either, but compared to the radical Muslim Brotherhood running around blowing up churches every day, I mean, what do you expect the military to do?
[00:57:06.179 --> 00:57:08.640]  Well, that's the problem, you see, the point is here,
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:19.364]  When you've got Obama lining up on the side of Assad, Obama also lined up on the side of Morsi, and he funded the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:57:19.364 --> 00:57:22.625]  That's the evidence we've been reporting in WND.
[00:57:22.625 --> 00:57:24.766]  It's direct funding in the Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:57:25.106 --> 00:57:26.427]  Let me ask you this then.
[00:57:26.427 --> 00:57:28.107]  Everything's mounting against Obama.
[00:57:28.107 --> 00:57:29.968]  His approval rating's plunging.
[00:57:29.968 --> 00:57:34.831]  He's got all his advisors saying we need a false flag in the financial times of London.
[00:57:34.831 --> 00:57:37.672]  Washington Post, they go, gee, a terror attack would sure help.
[00:57:37.672 --> 00:57:39.373]  Like, almost encouraging him.
[00:57:39.373 --> 00:57:41.254]  It's so thinly veiled.
[00:57:41.254 --> 00:57:43.895]  I expect him to pull some big, big staged event.
[00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:51.093]  Well that's what I think, you know, the whole, the concern about it's only hours before we attack Syria.
[00:57:51.093 --> 00:57:52.314]  As soon as U.S.
[00:57:52.314 --> 00:58:00.038]  military are involved in an attack on Syria, well then you've got a situation where, you know, that becomes the news.
[00:58:00.038 --> 00:58:00.258]  U.S.
[00:58:00.258 --> 00:58:01.438]  has gone to war with Syria.
[00:58:01.438 --> 00:58:04.120]  And there might actually be real stuff.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:07.902]  Iran has come out saying they're going to fire scuds at Israel if this starts.
[00:58:07.902 --> 00:58:09.182]  And then Russia comes in.
[00:58:09.182 --> 00:58:10.023]  This could be World War III.
[00:58:10.563 --> 00:58:11.363]  How about Russia?
[00:58:11.363 --> 00:58:15.265]  Russia's not going to let Assad go down without a fight, and neither is Iran.
[00:58:15.265 --> 00:58:23.190]  You know, this is Obama taking on Russia directly, or indirectly through Assad, but I mean, it's clearly a direct confrontation.
[00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:25.351]  Well, the Russians are there, it is a direct, yeah.
[00:58:25.931 --> 00:58:37.375]  But remember, at the core of this is evidence the Egyptian government's going to use in the trials of the Muslim Brotherhood that the Obama administration has been paying under the table.
[00:58:37.375 --> 00:58:40.196]  Alright, then explain what that's going to mean when we come back.
[00:58:40.196 --> 00:58:41.257]  I'm going to take a few phone calls.
[00:58:41.257 --> 00:58:42.557]  Mark and Joe have been holding.
[00:58:42.557 --> 00:58:46.899]  Wanted to talk to you and I. This is Bombshell Info with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[00:58:46.899 --> 00:58:47.719]  I'm Alex Jones.

[00:59:00.233 --> 00:59:06.617]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[00:59:07.017 --> 00:59:09.319]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[00:59:09.319 --> 00:59:10.660]  They're the good guys.

[00:59:50.267 --> 00:59:54.990]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:58.113]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:59:58.113 --> 01:00:03.677]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:00:03.677 --> 01:00:05.278]  It all comes down to one thing.
[01:00:05.578 --> 01:00:07.219]  We are what we eat.
[01:00:07.219 --> 01:00:11.882]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:00:11.882 --> 01:00:16.125]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[01:00:16.125 --> 01:00:18.667]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:00:18.667 --> 01:00:24.911]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:00:55.024 --> 01:00:58.245]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:01:10.529 --> 01:01:14.632]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:01:14.632 --> 01:01:18.595]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:01:18.595 --> 01:01:20.497]  It certainly is.
[01:01:20.497 --> 01:01:37.589]  And regardless of whether Obama and the globalists continue to expand the premeditated war to wreck Syria and put something in ten times worse conservatively than Assad, regardless, the jig is up, the train has left the station,
[01:01:38.672 --> 01:01:47.795]  Nine percent approval rating in the United States, similar numbers in Europe, against launching this war, expanding this war.
[01:01:47.795 --> 01:01:52.337]  They've already launched it with the proxy forces for two and a half years.
[01:01:52.337 --> 01:01:56.379]  It shows that there is a huge awakening taking place.
[01:01:56.379 --> 01:02:05.482]  And coming up, we've got some very important information with Greg Pallast on Larry Summers, who they want, he was already head of the Treasury, now they want to make him
[01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:08.881]  The head of the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve.
[01:02:08.881 --> 01:02:12.602]  And since he's the main architect, he even gets the credit himself.
[01:02:12.602 --> 01:02:18.985]  It's admitted in his own banker-loving publications out there that he helped engineer the end of Glass-Steagall, the derivatives.
[01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:24.166]  So why not put one of the main criminals who's behind all this in charge?
[01:02:24.166 --> 01:02:27.007]  That is coming up.
[01:02:27.007 --> 01:02:30.649]  But you got to remember that it hasn't been since
[01:02:33.353 --> 01:02:42.780]  It's 1782 that the British Parliament has said no to a Prime Minister asking for a war.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:44.822]  So that's over 200 years.
[01:02:44.822 --> 01:02:50.226]  And you'll probably notice that 1782 is when the war ended here in the colonies.
[01:02:50.226 --> 01:02:54.009]  We officially had won the war to become the United States of America.
[01:02:54.009 --> 01:02:55.610]  That's how big a deal this is.
[01:02:57.154 --> 01:03:07.919]  That the Parliament in England before 1776, when that war kicked off, was set to vote against the war.
[01:03:07.919 --> 01:03:13.082]  And then the King of England rode famously and addressed Parliament, which was unheard of.
[01:03:13.082 --> 01:03:14.742]  And they said, OK, we'll launch the war.
[01:03:14.742 --> 01:03:15.743]  And then seven years later,
[01:03:16.843 --> 01:03:20.848]  Or six years later, six and a half years later, they had to back off and stop.
[01:03:20.848 --> 01:03:23.031]  Not even because the colonies had won most of the battles.
[01:03:23.031 --> 01:03:24.292]  They'd lost most of them.
[01:03:24.292 --> 01:03:25.674]  They persevered though.
[01:03:25.674 --> 01:03:26.795]  They didn't give up.
[01:03:26.795 --> 01:03:27.636]  They continued.
[01:03:27.636 --> 01:03:30.099]  They kept hammering and hammering and hammering.
[01:03:30.099 --> 01:03:33.623]  And that's why I say resistance is victory.
[01:03:33.623 --> 01:03:36.046]  So that is coming up.
[01:03:37.122 --> 01:03:40.583]  In the next segment, Greg Powell is breaking down what the banksters are up to.
[01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.623]  More news and the latest on Syria.
[01:03:42.623 --> 01:03:51.124]  And then I did a 30-minute interview with Russell Brand Friday night while I'm sitting here recording this, just a little while ago.
[01:03:51.124 --> 01:03:54.705]  And we're going to premiere that for the radio audience coming up.
[01:03:54.705 --> 01:03:56.125]  And a lot of you know who he is.
[01:03:56.125 --> 01:03:58.486]  Some may not, but anybody under 30 does.
[01:03:58.486 --> 01:04:01.066]  He's one of the big cult icons right now.
[01:04:01.066 --> 01:04:05.287]  And luckily, he's talking about the New World Order and the brainwashing of the public and
[01:04:06.367 --> 01:04:31.649]  The tyranny and how they want to keep us dumbed down and so it's great I mean we won't agree with him on every political issue, but the fact is he's definitely moving in our direction Anti-establishment waking up paradigm shattering systems, and he follows me on Twitter at real Alex Jones And he has like six million followers So that's important to be able to reach out to his his audience of people that we wouldn't be able to get to so it was exciting to talk to him and
[01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:33.950]  And so far, only my crew's heard this.
[01:04:33.950 --> 01:04:40.093]  You're going to get a chance to hear it coming up in the last three segments of this hour if we talk to Greg Palliston.
[01:04:40.093 --> 01:04:42.814]  Some people will say, oh, what's the big deal hearing from that guy?
[01:04:42.814 --> 01:04:44.254]  Again, come on.
[01:04:44.254 --> 01:04:49.517]  We're not just trying to convert the converted or talk to the choir here.
[01:04:49.517 --> 01:05:00.061]  I'm here to get KRS-One on, or Professor Griff, hip-hop icons, or to get Charlie Sheen on, or to get Viggo Mortensen on, or to get
[01:05:01.502 --> 01:05:14.416]  Just all sorts here, all the amazing guests we have, because we get to hear what they have to say, we get to show you who they really are instead of who the media distorts and says they are, and then we also get to then reach out to all of their fan base.
[01:05:15.504 --> 01:05:20.569]  And that's how you network the Liberty Movement to really change the course of history.
[01:05:20.569 --> 01:05:28.335]  And that's why Zbigniew Brzezinski said two days ago, I guess four days ago now, if it's on Sunday, that, oh my gosh, the alternative media has destroyed us.
[01:05:28.335 --> 01:05:30.177]  They all know how we're staging stuff.
[01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:33.179]  I mean, he's putting on a mayday to the elite right now.
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:44.446]  Just like the Pentagon a month ago put out a mayday about the Drudge Report, you know, that they get caught in all their lies because Drudge will just put up what they said previously, showing how they're engaged in disinfo.
[01:05:44.446 --> 01:05:47.408]  So, we're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:05:47.408 --> 01:05:56.573]  Whether you're black, white, old, young, liberal, conservative, whatever the terms are, if you love justice, if you love freedom, if you love the truth, we are a movement of truth.
[01:05:56.573 --> 01:05:57.834]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:06:00.976 --> 01:06:14.747]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.

[01:07:03.718 --> 01:07:05.339]  Obama!
[01:07:05.339 --> 01:07:07.241]  Obama!
[01:07:07.241 --> 01:07:08.682]  Obama!
[01:07:08.682 --> 01:07:10.363]  Re-healthcare!
[01:07:10.363 --> 01:07:12.365]  Turn in my guns!
[01:07:12.365 --> 01:07:14.306]  Take my rights!
[01:07:14.306 --> 01:07:15.307]  Make me safe!
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:23.660]  Yeah.
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:24.261]  Ooh.
[01:07:24.261 --> 01:07:27.762]  That's a bad man.
[01:07:27.762 --> 01:07:28.982]  We need to turn our guns in.
[01:07:28.982 --> 01:07:29.202]  Yay!
[01:07:50.939 --> 01:07:54.141]  That's discriminatory to say the name Cod.
[01:07:54.141 --> 01:07:56.582]  Or the name father or mother.
[01:07:56.582 --> 01:07:58.864]  Or to say brown paper bag in Seattle, that's bad.
[01:07:58.864 --> 01:08:00.204]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:08:00.204 --> 01:08:00.705]  Not 1776!
[01:08:00.705 --> 01:08:01.625]  No!
[01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:01.845]  No!
[01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:02.786]  Help me, I'm weak!
[01:08:02.786 --> 01:08:03.946]  George Washington's bad!
[01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:05.427]  I love big government!
[01:08:23.496 --> 01:08:26.577]  Hello, Queens of the Stone Age, bringing us in.
[01:08:26.577 --> 01:08:37.602]  Hey, here's some snippets of my interview with Greg Pallast, BBC reporter, fraud investigator, on what's happening with the move for the new Fed Chief, Larry Summers, the brilliant one that brought us derivatives.
[01:08:37.602 --> 01:08:41.703]  And then, the exclusive premiere of my Russell Brand interview, straight ahead.
[01:08:41.703 --> 01:08:43.124]  The website's InfoWars.com.
[01:08:43.504 --> 01:08:54.249]  The new September issue, Thou Shalt Not Have Any Gods Above the State, is available at InfoWarsTore.com with Obama as our savior, like Kim Jong Un on the front.
[01:08:54.249 --> 01:08:56.490]  Just check out InfoWarsTore.com to find that.
[01:08:56.490 --> 01:09:00.531]  But now, Greg Pallas and then the premiere of Russell Brandt.
[01:09:00.531 --> 01:09:04.793]  Thanks for joining us on the September 1st, 2013 Transmission.
[01:09:04.793 --> 01:09:06.954]  We're awake, we're free, we're alive.
[01:09:06.954 --> 01:09:09.415]  We have high IQs.
[01:09:09.415 --> 01:09:11.156]  That means we're terrorists.
[01:09:11.696 --> 01:09:16.359]  Greg Palast is with us for the next 40 minutes or so, but he joins us.
[01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:21.683]  He is, of course, a syndicated columnist, documentary filmmaker, best-selling author, gregpalast.com.
[01:09:21.683 --> 01:09:23.984]  He's worked for BBC, ABC News, you name it.
[01:09:23.984 --> 01:09:35.592]  He broke some of the big banking scandals back in 2002 with the documents that are planning a global meltdown by design to consolidate power, and he exposes the left, the right, all the kleptocratic bankers
[01:09:36.112 --> 01:09:42.054]  that are in control of this, but we're going to break in two minutes, Greg, and we're going to come back and get in to the banking big breaking news you've got.
[01:09:42.054 --> 01:09:46.695]  But what is your take on lining up against Russia with Syria?
[01:09:46.695 --> 01:09:50.176]  And I mean, these rebels have been caught staging false flags before.
[01:09:50.176 --> 01:09:51.557]  Why are we supposed to believe them now?
[01:09:51.557 --> 01:09:55.318]  Why would Assad nerve gas right in front of the U.N.
[01:09:55.318 --> 01:09:56.378]  so he can be blown up?
[01:09:57.987 --> 01:10:01.833]  Well, I don't, you know, to me it looks like these people were gassed.
[01:10:01.833 --> 01:10:03.856]  The question is, of course, who?
[01:10:03.856 --> 01:10:04.717]  I think it's Assad.
[01:10:04.717 --> 01:10:06.700]  He's not exactly a genius.
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.843]  But don't forget... No, no, but I believe it.
[01:10:08.843 --> 01:10:11.107]  I believe people were gassed, Greg.
[01:10:11.107 --> 01:10:11.568]  Yeah.
[01:10:11.568 --> 01:10:13.511]  I'm saying, I'm saying I don't think he did it.
[01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:15.550]  Well, I don't know.
[01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:25.255]  I mean, but what we do know is that, you know, we, look, let's remember, just like Saddam Hussein, Assad, Saddam Hussein, they all come from the same Frankenstein factory.
[01:10:25.255 --> 01:10:36.041]  You got to go back to the years of Carter and Bush, Democrats and Republicans, putting these guys into positions of power in the Mideast.
[01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:41.883]  And then, you know, like it often happens when you create Frankensteins, they get up off the table and try to kill you or kill someone else.
[01:10:41.883 --> 01:10:42.684]  They're out of control.
[01:10:43.044 --> 01:10:50.434]  Well, shifting gears out of that, you've got a big story out now on Larry Summers, our new special treasury secretary.
[01:10:50.434 --> 01:10:51.775]  I mean, I think he's the man for the job.
[01:10:51.775 --> 01:11:00.386]  If he helped engineer the too-big-to-fail Ponzi scheme derivatives deal, credit default swaps, why not make him emperor of the earth?
[01:11:01.124 --> 01:11:04.427]  Well, because he's not, in my opinion, actually human.
[01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:17.258]  My information is that Larry Summers, who is Obama's first choice for the Federal Reserve Board to take Ben Bernanke's place... Is Lemmy Winks from South Park?
[01:11:17.258 --> 01:11:23.804]  Well, I think that he's actually a colony of aliens sent here to turn the human race into a cheap source of protein.
[01:11:25.767 --> 01:11:34.531]  In all seriousness, Larry Summers is Obama's first choice for the head of the Federal Reserve Board, take Bernanke's place.
[01:11:34.531 --> 01:11:48.498]  He was Secretary of Treasury under Clinton, where he, with Robert Rubin, pushed and created the whole deregulation of the banking system, turning your bank vaults into roulette wheels.
[01:11:48.498 --> 01:11:54.341]  And he's the guy that personally, personally body-blocked all regulation
[01:11:55.301 --> 01:12:05.124]  Of the derivatives market, all these financial toxic assets like synthetic collateralized debt obligations, which we lived without, by the way, for several thousand years.
[01:12:05.124 --> 01:12:10.305]  And suddenly we had to have these things, which brought our planet financially to its knees.
[01:12:10.305 --> 01:12:16.366]  This is so this is Larry Summers, the mayor, you know, he's kind of the typhoid Mary of economics.
[01:12:16.366 --> 01:12:21.268]  And now he's back as Obama's first choice for the Fed.
[01:12:21.268 --> 01:12:22.468]  The key thing is
[01:12:23.522 --> 01:12:26.144]  And of course he was Obama's economics czar.
[01:12:26.144 --> 01:12:27.044]  That worked out really well.
[01:12:27.044 --> 01:12:32.929]  We have fewer jobs, fewer people working today than we did when Obama took the oath of office.
[01:12:32.929 --> 01:12:36.791]  So unemployment's down because employment is way down.
[01:12:36.791 --> 01:12:37.872]  People just don't have jobs.
[01:12:37.872 --> 01:12:39.253]  I was just in Detroit.
[01:12:39.253 --> 01:12:40.193]  No one's looking for jobs.
[01:12:40.193 --> 01:12:45.437]  So they're not in the... Technically, auto workers out of work are not in the workforce, okay?
[01:12:45.437 --> 01:12:46.738]  So understand what's going on here.
[01:12:46.738 --> 01:12:51.321]  This is Obama's economics czar, Mr. Deregulation.
[01:12:51.321 --> 01:12:52.222]  Now my story
[01:12:52.682 --> 01:12:58.884]  Which I did for, um, that I was doing for BBC Television Guardian.
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:14.090]  My story is that I found inside documents, confidential documents, which were so unbelievable that I had to fly to Geneva, Switzerland, speak to the head of the WTO himself to get confirmation that these things are real.
[01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:27.439]  It was documents in which Timothy Geithner, later to become Secretary of Treasury under Obama, was writing to his boss at the time, Larry Summers of Treasury.
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:36.383]  Saying, reminding him about the meetings that they had and that he had to make phone calls to the five most powerful bankers in America.
[01:13:36.383 --> 01:13:43.086]  The head of Citibank, the head of Goldman Sachs, Merrill, Bank of America.
[01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:48.928]  He took the five big bankers and he had secret phone calls with them on a scheme to blow apart
[01:13:49.688 --> 01:13:52.709]  Regulation of the banking system worldwide.
[01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:57.311]  Now, he called it the endgame memo, as we reach the endgame.
[01:13:57.311 --> 01:13:58.332]  Well, we're the endgame.
[01:13:58.332 --> 01:14:02.494]  I don't like the game at all, but the end of it was not too pretty.
[01:14:02.494 --> 01:14:04.875]  It was extraordinary, because you have to understand, it's illegal.
[01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:07.896]  He's not allowed to meet.
[01:14:07.896 --> 01:14:10.137]  Larry Summers is not allowed to have private phone calls.
[01:14:10.799 --> 01:14:17.323]  With billionaire bankers to determine what the financial policies of the United States should be.
[01:14:17.323 --> 01:14:19.565]  Now he can have meetings with bankers, that's legal.
[01:14:19.565 --> 01:14:26.869]  You can't have secret meetings with bankers to get their approval and veto and determination of what our policies should be.
[01:14:26.869 --> 01:14:30.632]  And in this case it was deadly because it was a plan to blow apart.
[01:14:31.272 --> 01:14:37.075]  The regulations of banking in 156 nations, and they did it in 155 nations.
[01:14:37.075 --> 01:14:41.318]  They did it by abusing the World Trade Organization's trade rule.
[01:14:41.318 --> 01:14:59.128]  156 nations were told by Larry Summers and his coterie that unless they opened up their banking sectors to Citibank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and the rest of the boys, that any nation would have their markets closed to the United States and they'd go bankrupt.
[01:15:00.678 --> 01:15:02.580]  I want to expand on something here with you, though.
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:09.528]  I mean, I understand you not taking sides on the whole, you know, Assad thing, because he's obviously a bad guy, but putting al-Qaeda in is even worse.
[01:15:09.528 --> 01:15:11.910]  I mean... Yeah, I mean, look, we did this.
[01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:19.058]  We... Don't forget, who put in the Mujahideen in Afghanistan that we're now... that we have... How many kids?
[01:15:19.058 --> 01:15:20.159]  2,000 kids have died there?
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.521]  Fighting the guys that we armed in the first place?
[01:15:22.521 --> 01:15:23.882]  And a couple thousand from suicide.
[01:15:23.882 --> 01:15:26.483]  Well, shifting gears out of that, we'll cover it as it unfolds.
[01:15:26.483 --> 01:15:32.426]  You've got a big story out now on Larry Summers, our new special treasury secretary.
[01:15:32.426 --> 01:15:33.787]  I mean, I think he's the man for the job.
[01:15:33.787 --> 01:15:42.372]  If he helped engineer the too-big-to-fail Ponzi scheme derivatives deal, credit default swaps, why not make him emperor of the earth?
[01:15:43.132 --> 01:15:46.435]  Well, because he's not, in my opinion, actually human.
[01:15:46.435 --> 01:15:59.267]  My information is that Larry Summers, who is Obama's first choice for the Federal Reserve Board to take Ben Bernanke's place... Is Lemmy Winks from South Park?
[01:15:59.267 --> 01:16:05.813]  Well, I think that he's actually a colony of aliens sent here to turn the human race into a cheap source of protein.
[01:16:07.781 --> 01:16:16.546]  In all seriousness, Larry Summers is Obama's first choice for the head of the Federal Reserve Board, take Bernanke's place.
[01:16:16.546 --> 01:16:30.514]  He was Secretary of Treasury under Clinton, where he, with Robert Rubin, pushed and created the whole deregulation of the banking system, turning your bank vaults into roulette wheels.
[01:16:30.514 --> 01:16:36.358]  And he's the guy that personally, personally body-blocked all regulation
[01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:52.694]  ...of the derivatives market, all these financial toxic assets like synthetic collateralized debt obligations, which we lived without, by the way, for several thousand years, and suddenly we had to have these things, which brought our planet financially to its knees.
[01:16:52.694 --> 01:16:59.281]  So this is Larry Summers, the mayor, you know, he's kind of the typhoid mayor of economics, and now he's back!
[01:17:01.167 --> 01:17:03.568]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[01:17:03.568 --> 01:17:11.293]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:16.216]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[01:17:16.216 --> 01:17:18.117]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[01:17:18.797 --> 01:17:21.798]  Every one of us who can, will take care of ourselves.
[01:17:21.798 --> 01:17:24.800]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:33.023]  The new Just In Case Pack from eFoods Direct is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.

[01:21:05.104 --> 01:21:08.327]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:21:17.159 --> 01:21:19.941]  Well, folks, I've wanted to get him on for a long time.
[01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:29.109]  Russell Brand, who is a comedian, best-selling author, actor, TV host, you name it, who has been popular for many years, but he's really a sensation now.
[01:21:29.109 --> 01:21:33.172]  The whole office today, when they found out he was coming on, got really excited.
[01:21:33.172 --> 01:21:35.934]  We have a lot of big guests on.
[01:21:35.934 --> 01:21:40.058]  And what's exciting about this is that
[01:21:40.798 --> 01:21:42.439]  Alex, it's a privilege to be on your show.
[01:21:42.439 --> 01:21:42.699]  Thank you.
[01:22:09.178 --> 01:22:10.359]  No, it's a privilege to have you here.
[01:22:10.359 --> 01:22:13.803]  What's the best site for people to visit to find out about the tour?
[01:22:13.803 --> 01:22:15.384]  Is it RussellBrand.TV?
[01:22:15.384 --> 01:22:18.447]  Yeah, that'd be perfect, thanks.
[01:22:18.447 --> 01:22:19.689]  You bet.
[01:22:19.689 --> 01:22:23.633]  Bottom line, what is front and center most important to you right now that's happening in the world?
[01:22:25.169 --> 01:22:43.365]  I think the thing that is most important to me, the thing that I'm talking about in my show, is the cultural narratives that we are told, the way that we are presented with information, the way that meaning is designated, the significance that is given to certain issues and not to others, and the light in which stories are told.
[01:22:43.365 --> 01:22:45.707]  So I think that that could obviously comprise
[01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:50.708]  Edward Snowden or it could comprise Syria.
[01:22:50.708 --> 01:23:02.572]  It could comprise more broadly the manufacture of consent or the manipulation of the consciousness of civilization through a conglomeration of government, big business and media.
[01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:14.715]  Coming into this interview, we played a clip when you were on MSNBC and that really struck a chord with people when you just laughed at their narcissism and said, you don't talk about anything real.
[01:23:14.715 --> 01:23:18.117]  You're basically a bunch of peacocks up here.
[01:23:18.117 --> 01:23:20.098]  What was it like behind the scenes?
[01:23:20.098 --> 01:23:28.022]  And it seemed like you were clashing with them and it really captured people's imagination.
[01:23:28.022 --> 01:23:28.822]  What happened there?
[01:23:28.822 --> 01:23:29.763]  Because you were in the middle of it.
[01:23:30.947 --> 01:23:40.437]  Well, I mean, it's quite typical when you go on those type of TV shows that there's a particular frequency or pitch to the interview.
[01:23:40.437 --> 01:23:48.626]  There is a normal manner of speaking, not only the type of topics that are discussed, but the kind of banal
[01:23:49.447 --> 01:23:53.652]  Slightly shrill tone.
[01:23:53.652 --> 01:24:04.643]  The information is predicated on celebrity and gossip and what I would call low frequency data, low vibration information.
[01:24:05.203 --> 01:24:08.705]  It was like that when you go on anything on mainstream television.
[01:24:08.705 --> 01:24:12.608]  Those programs all sound the same, people all look the same, they all talk in the same way.
[01:24:12.608 --> 01:24:15.330]  It was that kind of atmosphere.
[01:24:15.330 --> 01:24:30.299]  The only difference was that the impoliteness was at such an extreme level that it gave me an opportunity to point out some of that stuff, which I wouldn't typically do because it sometimes doesn't seem appropriate to tell people that what they're doing is pointless or silly.
[01:24:31.013 --> 01:24:37.937]  I want to get into world events, your tour that's so popular that I hope to see when you come to Austin in a few weeks here in Texas.
[01:24:37.937 --> 01:24:49.125]  But just getting back to that, they genuinely seemed extremely uncomfortable, but the women also seemed very sexually excited and were not faking it.
[01:24:49.125 --> 01:24:52.387]  I mean, I could tell that somehow you absolutely
[01:24:53.007 --> 01:24:57.151]  Like, broke the spell of their self-centered, petty narcissism.
[01:24:57.151 --> 01:24:58.152]  And I'm not kissing your butt.
[01:24:58.152 --> 01:24:59.373]  I mean, it really happened.
[01:24:59.373 --> 01:25:03.357]  That's a magic clip, uh, from my perspective.
[01:25:03.357 --> 01:25:04.439]  You've become nervous.
[01:25:04.439 --> 01:25:05.860]  Why are you nervous?
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:07.421]  You're a powerful woman.
[01:25:07.421 --> 01:25:08.463]  You've got a lovely job.
[01:25:08.463 --> 01:25:09.584]  What seems to be the trouble?
[01:25:09.584 --> 01:25:10.605]  I don't know.
[01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:12.467]  You've got hair like Princess Diana.
[01:25:12.467 --> 01:25:12.727]  Oh, wow.
[01:25:13.668 --> 01:25:15.190]  Is this what you all do for a living?
[01:25:15.190 --> 01:25:15.990]  Yes!
[01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:20.435]  We're going to be talking about the situation with Edward Snowden.
[01:25:20.435 --> 01:25:21.697]  This whistleblower, is it good?
[01:25:21.697 --> 01:25:23.238]  What he's done for America?
[01:25:23.238 --> 01:25:26.442]  Or are our secrets being jeopardized by his intentions?
[01:25:26.442 --> 01:25:28.124]  We're going to be talking about that.
[01:25:28.124 --> 01:25:29.886]  Why do you think you shook him up so bad?
[01:25:30.166 --> 01:25:30.766]  I don't know.
[01:25:30.766 --> 01:25:39.171]  I'm a bit confused by it, because I just went on there and did what I normally do, which is just being polite, and then if I point out something idiosyncratic or weird, I observe that.
[01:25:39.171 --> 01:25:49.718]  But don't you think, Alex, that you deal with so much duplicity, whether in a situation where you're in an interview on the TV or on the radio, or if you're making a purchase in a shop.
[01:25:49.718 --> 01:25:55.041]  Sometimes we lose our authenticity, our ability to be human and truthful with one another.
[01:25:55.421 --> 01:26:01.046]  I think if you interact in a very human and truthful way, then that can be very disruptive.
[01:26:01.046 --> 01:26:01.366]  Sure.
[01:26:01.366 --> 01:26:04.589]  It's not like there are certain individuals that are good and certain individuals that are bad.
[01:26:04.589 --> 01:26:15.518]  I know myself, you know, I work in films and I've worked a lot in media, so I must be culpable as well for propagating these ideas and supporting them in my own way and on a bad day.
[01:26:15.518 --> 01:26:23.044]  Like just now, I arrived at Seattle Airport and there were people that wanted autographs and they were the kind of people that filled the photographs
[01:26:23.624 --> 01:26:24.165]  We're good to go.
[01:26:49.527 --> 01:27:10.434]  I think it's more of a problem when you have a massive machine that conducts consciousness and orchestrates the way that we think en masse that has a set of priorities and an agenda that is making people in huge numbers think in a selfish, insular, atomized, apathetic and impotent way.
[01:27:10.434 --> 01:27:10.694]  Wow!
[01:27:11.795 --> 01:27:13.177]  Man, I tell you, you're on fire.
[01:27:13.177 --> 01:27:15.821]  It seems like you have really had an awakening.
[01:27:15.821 --> 01:27:21.309]  I mean, you've been awake for a long time, but it seems like your awakening is accelerating.
[01:27:21.309 --> 01:27:22.270]  Is that accurate to say?
[01:27:23.348 --> 01:27:26.749]  Yeah, I think you might be right, as a matter of fact, Alex.
[01:27:26.749 --> 01:27:31.091]  I mean, like for me, spirituality is an important component.
[01:27:31.091 --> 01:27:40.614]  I meditate a lot and I practice certain spiritual principles that mean I have to be very mindful one day at a time about the way I live my life.
[01:27:40.614 --> 01:27:47.977]  I'm like a drug and alcohol free and the more that I've detached myself from the things I thought would make me happy, like
[01:27:48.537 --> 01:28:09.856]  Money and fame and other people's opinions the more truth is being revealed That is pure Veritas Because that's been my experience as well and what you were just talking about just being aware that you're being selfish or Doing things that are self-centered or narcissistic is is half the battle
[01:28:10.677 --> 01:28:17.825]  Most of the people out there, especially that are in the mainstream media, they are purely turned over to the narcissism and are like biological androids.
[01:28:17.825 --> 01:28:19.487]  They're not even real.
[01:28:19.487 --> 01:28:25.313]  And I think that's why you freak Brzezinski's daughter out and others so much is because they...
[01:28:25.894 --> 01:28:39.839]  Got into this conscious of the manipulation they were involved in, but really what you do to others comes back on you, so now they've turned into what they tried to do to the public, making the public one-dimensional cutouts of what they projected.
[01:28:39.839 --> 01:28:41.460]  It's now blown back on them.
[01:28:42.142 --> 01:28:42.923]  That's very interesting.
[01:28:42.923 --> 01:28:46.165]  I often wonder, Alex, how those situations are contrived.
[01:28:46.165 --> 01:28:50.229]  I suppose if you work in the media, you go through so many filters.
[01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:55.493]  You're just not going to get that kind of job unless you're a certain type of person, unless you know the right sort of people.
[01:28:55.493 --> 01:28:58.295]  If you say the wrong type of things, you'll be filtered out.
[01:28:58.295 --> 01:29:08.924]  So by the time you get to the point where you have your own show, generally speaking, you think a certain way that is in alignment with the elitist interests that are behind whatever corporation owns the outlet.
[01:29:09.484 --> 01:29:29.636]  Yeah, but like, I think too that there is probably a less obvious way of understanding things in terms of, I wonder what happens neurologically, I wonder what the energy in a brain looks like, I wonder what that is like if our brains are surrounded by other brains that are thinking in a certain way, that are broadcasting, transmitting at a certain frequency.
[01:29:29.636 --> 01:29:32.518]  This is what I feel like we have is a sort of a situation where
[01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:39.702]  There's such a strong and hypnotic message that exists, not just externally, but more worrying internally.
[01:29:39.702 --> 01:29:48.947]  I'm always more worried when I find my... That's why I don't like it when I've transgressed my own personal principles, because I think, well, then I'm not behaving in accordance with what I believe in.
[01:29:48.947 --> 01:29:50.328]  I'm policing myself.
[01:29:50.328 --> 01:29:53.530]  You know, if I'm selfish, then I'm part of the problem.
[01:29:53.530 --> 01:29:56.312]  You know, like Gandhi said, be the change you want to see in the world.
[01:29:56.312 --> 01:29:59.594]  But really, all I can control is that I treat people well, you know?
[01:30:01.072 --> 01:30:04.074]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[01:30:04.074 --> 01:30:10.440]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:16.825]  Listen, there was some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:19.527]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.
[01:30:19.527 --> 01:30:20.868]  They're the good guys.
[01:30:20.868 --> 01:30:23.950]  You can trust SimpliSafe to protect your family.
[01:30:23.950 --> 01:30:28.453]  SimpliSafe was created by a Harvard Business School engineer and it's revolutionary.

[01:31:04.634 --> 01:31:05.914]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:05.914 --> 01:31:09.775]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:09.775 --> 01:31:12.056]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:12.056 --> 01:31:17.938]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:17.938 --> 01:31:24.599]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:24.599 --> 01:31:30.581]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.581 --> 01:31:34.282]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:31:34.742 --> 01:31:39.046]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:39.046 --> 01:31:44.991]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:44.991 --> 01:31:48.553]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.553 --> 01:31:50.535]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.535 --> 01:31:51.656]  It's here.

[01:32:00.894 --> 01:32:02.976]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[01:32:02.976 --> 01:32:11.025]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[01:32:11.025 --> 01:32:15.950]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:18.132]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[01:32:18.132 --> 01:32:19.674]  If every one of us who can,
[01:32:20.014 --> 01:32:21.515]  We'll take care of ourselves.
[01:32:21.515 --> 01:32:24.537]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.
[01:32:24.537 --> 01:32:32.741]  The new Just-In-Case Pack from eFoodsDirect is the big brother to the 7-Day Emergency Pack designed for Oklahoma disaster donations.
[01:32:32.741 --> 01:32:39.125]  It contains a 2-month supply for 1 person, or a 1-month supply for 2 adults, or a 2-week supply for a family of 4.
[01:32:39.125 --> 01:32:40.145]  The $320 price is $50 less than retail.

[01:33:00.018 --> 01:33:03.879]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:33:03.879 --> 01:33:09.401]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:33:09.401 --> 01:33:17.143]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:33:17.143 --> 01:33:26.245]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:33:26.445 --> 01:33:33.607]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:33:33.607 --> 01:33:36.668]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:33:36.668 --> 01:33:42.430]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse, but demand.
[01:33:43.130 --> 01:33:43.710]  War.
[01:33:43.710 --> 01:33:45.051]  Oh, there's another one!
[01:33:45.051 --> 01:33:46.312]  Another plane just hit!
[01:33:46.312 --> 01:33:47.393]  State of Mind.
[01:33:47.393 --> 01:33:48.953]  Because there's a war on.
[01:33:48.953 --> 01:33:49.994]  For your mind.
[01:33:49.994 --> 01:33:54.176]  Get your copy of State of Mind the movie at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:54.176 --> 01:34:01.560]  And remember, every order at InfoWarsStore.com receives a free citizen rulebook.
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.081]  Coast to Coast.
[01:34:03.081 --> 01:34:05.143]  Direct from Austin.
[01:34:05.143 --> 01:34:08.344]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:34:21.261 --> 01:34:28.585]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:28.585 --> 01:34:35.089]  Russell, the establishment is aware of the group consciousness, the group collective, and they're trying to program it, as you said, on record.
[01:34:35.089 --> 01:34:46.056]  They've written books about it, to lower the frequency down to a bestial, or even below bestial level, beyond common sense, even self-preservation, so that people can be programmable.
[01:34:46.056 --> 01:34:47.257]  So it comes down to the old
[01:34:48.377 --> 01:34:54.759]  A question of free will versus not free will, and I think that's how you can tell the good guys from the bad guys.
[01:34:54.759 --> 01:35:01.302]  If someone wants to expand consciousness, awakening, understanding, and empower people, then that means they're on the good side.
[01:35:01.302 --> 01:35:07.944]  If they want to shutter the horizons and put walls around the mind, that's the bad guys.
[01:35:07.944 --> 01:35:15.727]  And from what I've heard, it's got an amazing review, sold out in many places in the world, Messiah Complex, Revolution of Consciousness Tour,
[01:35:16.107 --> 01:35:19.909]  You're attempting to show people what different perspectives or windows into this?
[01:35:19.909 --> 01:35:21.529]  Describe it for us.
[01:35:21.529 --> 01:35:29.072]  What I do, Alex, is I use as navigational points certain personal heroes of mine.
[01:35:29.072 --> 01:35:42.738]  I talk about Malcolm X, Che Guevara, Dandy, and Jesus Christ, and how each of those characters represent certain traits, certain human facilities
[01:35:43.258 --> 01:35:43.979]  We're good to go.
[01:36:03.812 --> 01:36:04.472]  I don't know.
[01:36:25.478 --> 01:36:26.559]  We're good to go.
[01:36:55.547 --> 01:37:21.407]  Our heritage, our cultural myths and our stories that keep us bonded and unified and to a degree, I don't know, human, are being lost and subjugated because as long as human beings are in a state of fear and a state of stimulated desire, we will always be beholden to the elites, we will always be beholden to the corporate interests that offer to resolve these problems by selling us products.
[01:37:21.407 --> 01:37:24.690]  I've got to keep it funny Alex, I have to talk about sex every few seconds as well.
[01:37:25.390 --> 01:37:31.753]  Wow, Russell Brand is joining us right now on the road, part of his international tour.
[01:37:31.753 --> 01:37:43.280]  And, you know, speaking of getting people outside the box, from my own research, you're absolutely on target at the core here that the establishment is expert at hijacking
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:38:00.629]  Icons or as Campbell wrote archetypes archetypal images and then twisting them towards their aim and then really Rewriting all the basic cultural knowledge that every group out there had and replacing it
[01:38:01.389 --> 01:38:02.030]  I don't know.
[01:38:22.729 --> 01:38:30.380]  Standing up non-violently to oppression or never think about the fact that they could change the course and be an example to others.
[01:38:30.380 --> 01:38:38.651]  And so I really get from this that you're trying to almost go back and see what the people really stood for and try to get folks to become aware of this power?
[01:38:39.594 --> 01:38:40.895]  Yes, exactly Alex.
[01:38:40.895 --> 01:38:50.959]  I look at some corporate slogans like McDonald's, loving it, which is kind of meaningless and empty and an exploitation of an interesting piece of language to do with love.
[01:38:50.959 --> 01:38:57.422]  I look at Diet Dr Pepper and their slogan, unbelievably satisfying and how ridiculous and hyperbolic that is.
[01:38:57.842 --> 01:39:08.090]  Even the slogan of Gillette Razors, the best a man can get, I can immediately point out that this is setting the bar very, very low for humankind and for mankind.
[01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:20.860]  The kind of language used and slogans used by Malcolm X, by any means necessary, Che Guevara, it's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees, and Gandhi, be the change that you want to see in the world.
[01:39:20.860 --> 01:39:22.721]  These messages are subjugated.
[01:39:22.721 --> 01:39:23.262]  Furthermore,
[01:39:23.882 --> 01:39:30.824]  These heroes I offer replaced gods and gods themselves are symbols of certain traits and ideas.
[01:39:30.824 --> 01:39:36.486]  Indigenous faiths typically are pagan, which means they worship the earth and their environment.
[01:39:36.486 --> 01:39:44.449]  If you have a culture of people like the Celts that worship and revere rivers, how will you feel when corporations want to pollute your rivers?
[01:39:44.449 --> 01:39:49.070]  If you have an indigenous faith like the Nordics who revere the noble
[01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:50.071]  Sure, they get us.
[01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:27.559]  Wow, so they get us to sell out for light beer and blue jeans, as they say in a recent popular film, and then we're not satisfied by the light beer and blue jeans.
[01:40:27.559 --> 01:40:34.105]  Folks, go to RussellBrand.TV to find out if they can still get tickets in their area of the world.
[01:40:34.105 --> 01:40:40.911]  Russell, where else are you going now on the tour, and where was your favorite place you visited since you got on the road?
[01:40:41.971 --> 01:40:45.734]  Well, I've been all over Canada and had a great time there.
[01:40:45.734 --> 01:40:51.678]  I'm currently in... I've just come from San Francisco, that was fantastic, and I'm in Seattle now.
[01:40:51.678 --> 01:41:01.864]  I'm going to Portland, then I'm going to be back in my country for a few days, and then, like, I'll be in New York and Florida and Austin, Texas.
[01:41:01.864 --> 01:41:03.225]  I'm enjoying all of it, really.
[01:41:03.225 --> 01:41:06.728]  I mean, you know what it's like when you're touring, you don't spend an awful lot of time
[01:41:08.035 --> 01:41:09.217]  Any one location.
[01:41:09.217 --> 01:41:22.593]  So like, I really love America and love being with the American people and find that, broadly speaking, American media and American politics is not representative of my experience directly with American people.
[01:41:23.004 --> 01:41:23.685]  Sure, absolutely.
[01:41:23.685 --> 01:41:27.829]  It's a fake, projected culture that the world sees that is not even America.
[01:41:27.829 --> 01:41:36.079]  It's like New Yorkers still move to Austin or still visit Texas and think we ride horses to work and that we're all the Beverly Hillbillies.
[01:41:36.079 --> 01:41:42.606]  In the ten minutes we've got left, Russell, I want to go over some of the world events with you that are happening right now, like Syria.
[01:41:42.606 --> 01:41:43.147]  But first,
[01:41:43.627 --> 01:41:46.048]  What do you think is happening in the media revolution?
[01:41:46.048 --> 01:41:48.470]  Because mainstream media is dying.
[01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:50.111]  Every metric shows that.
[01:41:50.111 --> 01:41:55.194]  Alternative media, the people's media with its real diversity is exploding.
[01:41:55.194 --> 01:42:01.097]  I want to get your take on where you think the future of the media is going and cultural developments.
[01:42:01.097 --> 01:42:07.161]  And do you think that the human species will survive to become a type one civilization and make it off the planet?
[01:42:09.941 --> 01:42:11.123]  That's cool.
[01:42:11.123 --> 01:42:12.024]  What does that mean?
[01:42:12.024 --> 01:42:16.949]  That we get our own extraterrestrial operations going and populate other planets?
[01:42:16.949 --> 01:42:20.133]  With Alex, what I think with the media stuff is that...
[01:42:22.013 --> 01:42:28.918]  I think that, yeah, I think the diversity provided by social networking and new media is very, very positive.
[01:42:28.918 --> 01:42:35.983]  But like, the status quo are expert at manipulating and co-opting any counter-cultural movement.
[01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:46.209]  If you look at how hip-hop began as a very sort of radical, anti-establishment voice and eventually became, couldn't be more about consumerism and bling and wealth.
[01:42:46.209 --> 01:42:48.551]  The same thing happened with punk.
[01:42:48.551 --> 01:42:51.293]  So I think any counter-cultural movement is at risk.
[01:42:51.853 --> 01:42:53.115]  We're good to go.
[01:43:11.816 --> 01:43:12.236]  I think we do.
[01:43:12.236 --> 01:43:14.777]  I hear buzz about Russell Brand all over the place, mainly in new media.
[01:43:14.777 --> 01:43:16.478]  Why do you think you're getting so much more popular?
[01:43:37.188 --> 01:43:37.708]  I don't know.
[01:43:37.708 --> 01:43:49.915]  I hope, Alex, that it's a result of moving out of alignment with the messages and narrative of mainstream media and being truthful to my, sort of, you know, my original intentions when I became a stand-up comedian.
[01:43:49.915 --> 01:43:59.181]  So, sort of, being inspired very much by men like Bill Hicks and Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor who made telling the truth funny.
[01:44:01.050 --> 01:44:14.817]  With over 3,000 years of historic use, Pure Silver continues to be one of nature's most reliable and effective agents against fighting viruses, mold, fungus, bacteria, pathogens and parasites.
[01:44:14.817 --> 01:44:25.123]  At Silver Lungs, we have developed a reliable and easy-to-use full production system for creating endless Pure Nano Silver solutions right from the convenience and comfort of your home.

[01:44:40.794 --> 01:44:47.301]  Our nano silver soap and our most popular product the all-natural nano silver gel.

[01:45:00.976 --> 01:45:08.740]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:12.982]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.
[01:45:12.982 --> 01:45:26.529]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast, and a limited number of parasites.
[01:45:27.089 --> 01:45:29.572]  It can even purify water!

[01:47:00.757 --> 01:47:02.860]  It's hurricane and wildfire season again.
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:10.889]  Why do thousands of people sit in these reoccurring problem areas year after year, betting their lives that the disaster won't get them?
[01:47:10.889 --> 01:47:15.835]  Hundreds of you helped eFoodsDirect ship 50,000 donated meals to the Oklahoma victims.
[01:47:15.835 --> 01:47:18.017]  The problem is we can't help everybody.
[01:47:18.017 --> 01:47:18.558]  If everyone
[01:47:18.558 --> 01:47:21.379]  One of us who can, will take care of ourselves.
[01:47:21.379 --> 01:47:24.399]  We can all pitch in to take care of those who really can't.

[01:48:03.113 --> 01:48:05.173]  Direct from Austin.
[01:48:05.173 --> 01:48:08.375]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:48:14.164 --> 01:48:19.791]  I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here.
[01:48:19.791 --> 01:48:24.436]  It came to me when I tried to classify your species.
[01:48:24.436 --> 01:48:28.020]  I realized that you're not actually mammals.
[01:48:29.574 --> 01:48:37.396]  Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment.
[01:48:37.396 --> 01:48:39.857]  But you humans do not.
[01:48:39.857 --> 01:48:43.417]  You move to an area and you multiply.
[01:48:43.417 --> 01:48:48.619]  You multiply until every natural resource is consumed.
[01:48:48.619 --> 01:48:53.400]  The only way you can survive is to spread to another area.
[01:48:59.226 --> 01:49:04.009]  There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.
[01:49:04.009 --> 01:49:07.230]  Do you know what it is?
[01:49:07.230 --> 01:49:10.212]  A virus.
[01:49:10.212 --> 01:49:12.473]  Human beings are a disease.
[01:49:12.473 --> 01:49:15.315]  A cancer of this planet.
[01:49:15.315 --> 01:49:16.736]  You are a plague.
[01:49:25.805 --> 01:49:29.913]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:49:29.913 --> 01:49:31.637]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:49:33.368 --> 01:49:36.610]  Russell, I want to talk about some good news from my perspective.
[01:49:36.610 --> 01:49:43.153]  Nobody's saying Assad's a good guy, but the West did start the war, did fund the rebels starting two and a half years ago.
[01:49:43.153 --> 01:49:56.180]  And for the first time since 1782, when the British Parliament voted to end the war against the colonies, they voted down the Prime Minister in the UK, David Cameron, wanting to go to war.
[01:49:57.220 --> 01:50:03.422]  Obama, he has a 9% approval rating on this war in a Reuters, Washington Post poll.
[01:50:03.422 --> 01:50:06.483]  I mean, when Bush did all these lies, he had a 72.
[01:50:06.483 --> 01:50:07.823]  Now it's very unpopular.
[01:50:07.823 --> 01:50:22.427]  I see this as a sea change where libertarians, conservatives, liberals, everybody I know sees through this and knows that it's about the takeover of the Middle East that Wesley Clark exposed, the seven nations they wanted to target.
[01:50:23.607 --> 01:50:26.549]  I went through the Pentagon 10 days after 9-11.
[01:50:26.549 --> 01:50:33.434]  And an officer from the Joint Staff called me into his office and said, I want you to know, he said, sir, we're going to attack Iraq.
[01:50:33.434 --> 01:50:34.194]  And I said, why?
[01:50:34.194 --> 01:50:37.496]  He said, we don't know.
[01:50:37.496 --> 01:50:40.178]  And then I came back to the Pentagon about six weeks later.
[01:50:40.178 --> 01:50:41.059]  I saw the same officer.
[01:50:41.059 --> 01:50:43.821]  I said, why haven't we attacked Iraq?
[01:50:43.821 --> 01:50:45.002]  Are we still going to attack Iraq?
[01:50:45.002 --> 01:50:46.883]  He said, oh, sir, he says, it's worse than that.
[01:50:46.883 --> 01:50:50.085]  He said, I just got this memo from the Secretary of Defense's office that says we're going to attack
[01:50:50.911 --> 01:50:55.033]  And destroy the governments in seven countries in five years.
[01:50:55.033 --> 01:51:02.756]  We're going to start with Iraq and then we're going to move to Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran.
[01:51:02.756 --> 01:51:12.521]  What is your view on Syria and are you optimistic and excited that the UK Parliament, for the first time in 200 years, did the right thing on war?
[01:51:14.068 --> 01:51:21.076]  I certainly agree with you that that vote is the result of widespread disillusionment with the political process.
[01:51:21.076 --> 01:51:29.006]  I think that obviously the Middle East is one of the most complex issues in contemporary world affairs and has been for millennia.
[01:51:29.606 --> 01:51:43.004]  What I believe is that our focus has to be the humanitarian aspect, the displaced refugees and the hundreds of thousands that are suffering as a result of military conflict in that area.
[01:51:43.004 --> 01:51:45.968]  What I also believe, Alex, is that
[01:51:47.060 --> 01:51:51.881]  These affairs are conducted behind a veil of disingenuity and duplicity.
[01:51:51.881 --> 01:51:55.461]  It's very difficult for any of us to understand what's truly happening.
[01:51:55.461 --> 01:52:00.762]  My experience tells me that whatever they are telling me, I intuitively don't trust.
[01:52:00.762 --> 01:52:06.303]  It's typically about the interests of business and government and how they align with one another.
[01:52:06.303 --> 01:52:10.484]  So that's what I'm going to assume until I hear otherwise.
[01:52:10.484 --> 01:52:14.325]  The claims were going into Iraq and Afghanistan were duplicitous.
[01:52:16.645 --> 01:52:25.592]  The starting point I have is going to be not to trust any advocacy of military action in Syria.
[01:52:25.592 --> 01:52:31.878]  Whilst it's not an issue I can pretend to fully understand, it seems like it's extremely complex that there are many factions fighting there.
[01:52:31.878 --> 01:52:34.400]  There's no clear good, even, bad situation.
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:35.801]  Absolutely.
[01:52:35.801 --> 01:52:39.343]  Ron Paul recently came out and said he basically thinks it's a false flag.
[01:52:39.343 --> 01:52:42.146]  There's evidence that the Al-Qaeda groups staged a chemical attack.
[01:52:42.846 --> 01:52:47.270]  We're not really positive who set off the gas.
[01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:51.053]  The group that's most likely to benefit from that is Al-Qaeda.
[01:52:51.053 --> 01:52:52.395]  I think it's a false flag.
[01:52:52.395 --> 01:52:54.817]  I think really, indeed.
[01:52:54.817 --> 01:52:57.719]  It is obviously an incredibly complex situation.
[01:52:57.719 --> 01:52:58.400]  In closing,
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:01.523]  Because this happens to me a lot every time I finish an interview.
[01:53:01.523 --> 01:53:06.089]  After it ends, there's something or a group of things I wish that I would have said.
[01:53:06.089 --> 01:53:08.432]  Russell Brand, we really appreciate your time.
[01:53:08.432 --> 01:53:15.581]  In closing, in a minute or two, any other key points that you'd like to put out there to the millions that will end up watching and listening to this?
[01:53:16.909 --> 01:53:20.550]  Well, Alex, I think probably you and me are coming at things from a different perspective.
[01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:27.433]  But me, I see my views are more informed by socialism, even Marxism.
[01:53:27.433 --> 01:53:31.234]  But I think, ultimately, what we believe in is freedom and truth.
[01:53:31.234 --> 01:53:44.879]  And I think that as long as people respect each other's differences, and also acknowledge that we, the people struggling against oppression, have more in common with each other than we do than the people that control us, then I think there's a chance for unity and change.
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:54:08.215]  Sure, I mean, I think that at a level you can see as a counter to the centralized corporatist communism, socialism, but then you realize that they selectively use the deployment of collectivism to only create a permanent peasant class to control us, so that we never have come to the libertarian view of the individual being empowered and having a giant middle class.
[01:54:08.215 --> 01:54:10.997]  I mean, what's your view of, say, libertarianism or Ron Paul?
[01:54:10.997 --> 01:54:13.699]  I mean, off-air, you said that you were aware of my work.
[01:54:13.699 --> 01:54:15.520]  What's your view for folks of what I do?
[01:54:16.801 --> 01:54:22.245]  I think that you're fantastic because you're challenging authority and you're challenging the status quo, so I agree with you.
[01:54:22.245 --> 01:54:29.910]  But for me, the number one priority for anyone who wants social change has to be the welfare of those most in need of it.
[01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:33.513]  The support of society's poorest and most vulnerable.
[01:54:34.333 --> 01:54:43.482]  And for me that's not socialism, if anything it's Christian, it's spiritual, that's why I believe it's the most important issue.
[01:54:43.482 --> 01:54:48.087]  I think if you're in a position of power and your priority is not helping the poor and the dispossessed,
[01:54:48.726 --> 01:54:50.666]  Then you shouldn't be in power.
[01:54:50.666 --> 01:54:59.208]  Now, of course, a healthy society across the board, you know, and hierarchies are always going to be to a degree necessary.
[01:54:59.208 --> 01:55:04.049]  But for me, on a deeper human level, I feel our obligation is to help those that are suffering.
[01:55:04.049 --> 01:55:04.269]  Sure.
[01:55:04.269 --> 01:55:06.290]  You've got a giant Twitter account.
[01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:06.890]  What is it?
[01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:09.711]  Rusty Rockets.
[01:55:09.711 --> 01:55:15.212]  Is there any other places on the web people should visit other than that and your TV site?
[01:55:16.149 --> 01:55:18.991]  Nah, that's all cool for me, mate.
[01:55:18.991 --> 01:55:22.814]  I already follow you and stuff, but let's keep this dialogue going and I hope I see you in Austin.
[01:55:47.890 --> 01:55:55.175]  Well, that whilst Hitler's actions were deplorable, it's not his extremism that is terrifying, it's his mundanity.
[01:55:55.175 --> 01:56:04.141]  He was just a normal man created by a number of geopolitical, economic, and religious circumstances at the time.
[01:56:04.141 --> 01:56:04.782]  Versailles!
[01:56:04.782 --> 01:56:11.887]  Yeah, of course Versailles and the anti-Semitism that was very prominent in that part of Europe at that time.
[01:56:13.288 --> 01:56:17.632]  But now, in those days it was clear what evil was.
[01:56:17.632 --> 01:56:19.213]  Ah, evil is Adolf Hitler.
[01:56:19.213 --> 01:56:23.417]  Now evil comes dressed in the white of Ronald McDonald.
[01:56:23.417 --> 01:56:26.259]  Now evil is hidden behind the Apple logo.
[01:56:26.259 --> 01:56:31.444]  Now evil is indecipherable in derivative bundles and in dispossessed millions.
[01:56:31.444 --> 01:56:35.007]  So again, it's about the narrative and the way we're told stories.
[01:56:35.427 --> 01:56:35.948]  Exactly.
[01:56:35.948 --> 01:56:41.554]  It knows how to hide and deciphering it, and knowing what evil is, is really the answer.
[01:56:41.554 --> 01:56:46.140]  Russell Brand, thank you so much, and I look forward to hopefully meeting you when you're in Austin in a few weeks.
[01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:47.321]  I'll be at your show regardless.
[01:56:47.321 --> 01:56:48.823]  Stay in touch, Alex.
[01:56:48.823 --> 01:56:49.824]  I can't wait to see you.
[01:56:49.824 --> 01:56:50.224]  Thank you, sir.
[01:56:50.224 --> 01:56:50.485]  Goodbye.
[01:56:52.503 --> 01:57:00.108]  Well, folks, there goes Russell Brand, and I have been told by David Icke that he was a listener, and we got a hold of him and discovered he was.
[01:57:00.108 --> 01:57:06.092]  We found out he was following us on Twitter at RealAlexJones and got him on, and I've been fascinated with his work for a few years.
[01:57:06.092 --> 01:57:13.316]  He's been around for a long time, but he certainly has gone from just kind of being the wild party animal guy to being a serious thinker.
[01:57:13.316 --> 01:57:14.837]  You can tell he's a smart guy.
[01:57:14.837 --> 01:57:18.440]  And look, folks, you know I don't like communism, but he's on a journey here.
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:20.181]  He said that was a long time ago.
[01:57:20.181 --> 01:57:21.522]  Now his views are changing.
[01:57:22.262 --> 01:57:29.144]  We have to reach out to everybody, especially if they're outside the box and want to try to make connections to others.
[01:57:29.144 --> 01:57:36.207]  And so this is how those of us that want true Thomas Jefferson-style liberty are going to win the fight against the tyrants.
[01:57:36.207 --> 01:57:38.228]  But I tell you, that interview couldn't have gone better.
[01:57:38.228 --> 01:57:39.148]  That was amazing.
[01:57:39.688 --> 01:57:44.889]  And so I know that listeners out there probably want to send me their comments.
[01:57:44.889 --> 01:57:47.690]  You can do that at RealAlexJones on Twitter.
[01:57:47.690 --> 01:57:52.191]  And then later on in the broadcast, I will come back and read over some of those.
[01:57:52.191 --> 01:57:59.952]  We'll also open the phones up later and get your take on that amazing, groundbreaking interview with Russell Brand.
[01:57:59.952 --> 01:58:06.754]  And I hope this one gets eight and a half million views or whatever, like his MSNBC, because this will really get people thinking and talking.
[01:58:06.754 --> 01:58:07.894]  If him just shaking up
[01:58:08.354 --> 01:58:14.077]  Those cut out paper people went so viral and spurred people's humanity.
[01:58:14.077 --> 01:58:15.858]  This will really get people talking.
[01:58:15.858 --> 01:58:19.560]  So please, folks, send this out when it's posted on YouTube to everyone you know.
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:20.300]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:22.682]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the Alex Jones Show.
