[01:16.520 --> 01:30.000]  of the Info War. Ladies and gentlemen it is the first day of September 2013 as you listen
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.360]  to this worldwide transmission and I am normally live here on Sundays but we are taking off
[01:36.360 --> 01:41.800]  a little bit of time to actually work on Obama Deception 2 to be quite frank with you. The
[01:41.800 --> 01:47.720]  woods are lovely dark and deep but I have miles to go before I sleep but part of this
[01:47.720 --> 01:55.720]  transmission will be original. It will be virgin. It will be a maiden voyage in the
[01:55.720 --> 02:03.240]  last three segments of the second hour coming up today because I had a chance to interview
[02:03.240 --> 02:09.280]  Friday night just a little while ago as I said a recording this on Friday night. Russell
[02:09.280 --> 02:16.280]  Brand. A lot of you probably heard of him. He is a very fast rising movie star TV host
[02:16.280 --> 02:22.600]  and a comic and he's really been shaking things up calling the media a bunch of narcissistic
[02:22.600 --> 02:28.760]  basically mentally ill fools and I had heard from David Eich that he was a listener so
[02:28.760 --> 02:35.720]  we contacted him. He was a follower of me on my little Twitter account real Alex Jones
[02:35.720 --> 02:42.720]  and so I contacted him on his Twitter that has got 6 million plus followers and said
[02:42.720 --> 02:47.000]  hey we'd like to get you on and boom he came on and he says when he comes to Austin in
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.960]  a few weeks we'll be able to do a video interview so that should be interesting and people say
[02:49.960 --> 02:53.680]  oh why do we care about that. Well he's a smart guy. He's getting people to think outside
[02:53.680 --> 02:59.920]  the box and he's really you know awakened a lot from purely Marxist type ideas to a
[02:59.920 --> 03:05.480]  more libertarian view is what I got from the interview that you will be hearing because
[03:05.480 --> 03:09.720]  when I did it earlier today it was only myself and the crew that heard it very small audience
[03:09.720 --> 03:13.160]  but you will be hearing it by the millions coming up and I think it was very informative
[03:13.160 --> 03:20.360]  and then the best part is all of Russell Brand's hundreds of millions of fans around the world
[03:20.360 --> 03:26.640]  will then many of them tune in to this radio broadcast and to see the video of the interview
[03:26.640 --> 03:32.640]  that we will be posting up on info wars.com after the show today so that they can then
[03:32.640 --> 03:39.840]  hear him not being interrupted by petty issues only interrupted by other serious questions
[03:39.840 --> 03:48.560]  so that is coming up don't worry the signature trademark interruptions will be brought to
[03:48.560 --> 03:53.760]  you by the speech impediment master Alex Jones I don't really have that but I wish I did so
[03:53.760 --> 03:59.880]  ladies and gentlemen that is coming up now doesn't really matter that I'm saying this
[03:59.880 --> 04:06.560]  but it's interesting if there is a big strike on Syria you will be hearing me this Sunday
[04:06.560 --> 04:11.560]  so you'll never hear this tape this is all for naught but obviously if you are hearing
[04:11.560 --> 04:15.120]  it there's a little inside baseball of how we're pre-planning things and how hard we
[04:15.120 --> 04:20.880]  work here at the info wars.com studios if Obama for face-saving only cruise missiles
[04:20.880 --> 04:27.880]  is a few military outpost then was you still a war crime the back al-qaeda in Syria I will
[04:27.880 --> 04:35.440]  not be live and you'll get to hear the Russell brand interview and more but obviously if
[04:35.440 --> 04:39.080]  there is a big attack we will be here and we'll be here Monday as well David Knight
[04:39.080 --> 04:45.680]  tomorrow on the Monday show is that September 2nd he will be live doing three hours of the
[04:45.680 --> 04:49.400]  show I will be here at the office working on the bottom of section two as I have been
[04:49.400 --> 04:54.320]  about seven days a week as of late best film most powerful film ever made it's unbelievable
[04:54.320 --> 04:58.000]  I mean just how it exposes this thing it's the Rosetta stone of understanding this journey
[04:58.000 --> 05:02.200]  so that's coming up but we've got a still boil down the most important World War three
[05:02.200 --> 05:08.120]  the potential World War three news of the week with a Greg ballast Dr. Jerome Corsi
[05:08.120 --> 05:13.560]  Dr. Paul Greg Roberts that's all coming up from those interviews this week boiled down
[05:13.560 --> 05:18.680]  and then you get the again maiden voyage of my interview with Russell Brandt and again
[05:18.680 --> 05:23.120]  if we win the culture wars to wake up people that have once been the princes of trendiness
[05:23.120 --> 05:28.760]  and now they're the princes of mass awakening we are certainly beginning to win the culture
[05:28.760 --> 05:35.120]  war for free humanity against the board collectivist globalist so we're going to go to break
[05:35.120 --> 05:39.960]  for now though my friends I've got to leave you with the original transmission until Russell

[07:37.440 --> 07:42.200]  down the confusing mess that is the middle east and then a premier interview that I
[07:42.200 --> 07:47.080]  taped friday with the top comedian movie star you name it rustle brand on a host of political
[07:47.080 --> 07:52.600]  issues it's powerful we're going to premiere it in the last three segments of the second

[07:57.760 --> 08:03.120]  dr. Jerome coursey of world net daily you cannot get a better political mind on what's
[08:03.120 --> 08:09.040]  happening in the middle east with bombshell info about the nuclear threat the world war
[08:09.040 --> 08:15.920]  three threat posed if this if this expansion of the war gets out of hand bio vomit excuse
[08:15.920 --> 08:19.680]  me that's illegal in america talk about the president we don't have a first minute anymore
[08:19.680 --> 08:25.800]  i meant our lord our king our dear leader kim jong il kim jong on i meant obama here
[08:25.800 --> 08:34.360]  it is this is unprecedented here's the headline syria gas attack work of u.s. allies dr. Jerome
[08:34.360 --> 08:40.920]  coursey very respected person of course phd harvard university political science bestselling
[08:40.920 --> 08:45.160]  new york times bestselling author of unfit for command and so many other amazing books
[08:45.160 --> 08:49.720]  worked as a consultant at the highest levels of national security i know large areas of
[08:49.720 --> 08:54.640]  the pentagon know this is a pure evil what's about to happen and the russians will probably
[08:54.640 --> 08:59.600]  respond so i want to give him the floor we only got him for this segment dr. coursey
[08:59.600 --> 09:06.440]  how big is this uh that that they're doing this and that they don't have support bush
[09:06.440 --> 09:16.200]  had 72 in gallup polls and pew at 72 in 2003 i think this is the total collapse of credibility
[09:16.200 --> 09:20.560]  but it's kind of like hitler wasn't supported at the end either but he was still in control
[09:20.560 --> 09:25.440]  of the rike what are we seeing here and break down this bombshell well and first of all
[09:25.440 --> 09:32.560]  like the article we got running on world at daily wnd dot com right now as you say we
[09:32.560 --> 09:38.240]  went i went yesterday and researched check with the arabic speaking sources while each
[09:38.240 --> 09:45.720]  show bot who helped write the article there's numerous videos on the internet and in the
[09:45.720 --> 09:52.160]  arabic speaking world that make it clear the rebels are the ones who have launched the
[09:52.160 --> 09:58.400]  sarin gas attacks not the Assad government now the Assad government is not a great government
[09:58.400 --> 10:04.920]  i mean it's it's there's no good guys in syria but the point is the truth is the truth and
[10:04.920 --> 10:10.000]  i think the attempt by the obama administration which now appears to be the second time the
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.000]  obama administration has tried this there was the narrative being run out of the white
[10:15.000 --> 10:21.880]  house back in may that the Assad government was launching chemical attacks but the problem
[10:21.880 --> 10:28.320]  is that there's no validation of it there's no hard proof john carry secretary of state
[10:28.320 --> 10:34.880]  said yesterday he has indisputable proof well let's see it why don't we see this proof it's
[10:34.880 --> 10:42.640]  not there even the united nations going back to may doubted very seriously that the Assad
[10:42.640 --> 10:48.320]  regime as bad as it is was going to use sarin gas attacks as you said it doesn't does not
[10:48.320 --> 10:56.040]  make any sense why when the Assad government's winning would it resort to sarin gas attacks
[10:56.040 --> 11:03.360]  and with video after video with testimony after testimony coming out of the era of world
[11:03.360 --> 11:09.400]  in syria it's widely known that it's the rebels which are a group of al-qaeda muslim
[11:09.400 --> 11:18.240]  brotherhood ragtag radicals that are opposing the regime and the obama administration supporting
[11:18.240 --> 11:24.840]  them these are not good guys and to think that they wouldn't use sarin gas attacks stretches
[11:24.840 --> 11:31.520]  the imagination especially when we have pictures of the sarin gas arsenals with the gas and
[11:31.520 --> 11:38.480]  the other chemicals coming from Saudi Arabia I mean it seems to me that if the obama administration
[11:38.480 --> 11:45.280]  is going to go to war on syria which is what this means a very massive step I can't emphasize
[11:45.280 --> 11:51.840]  to helmet to people listening how much we are on the verge here of world war three russia
[11:51.840 --> 11:58.280]  and china not going to sit by if obama thinks he can wag the dog get attention off of his
[11:58.280 --> 12:05.080]  other problems or you know run a false flag here it isn't going to fly with russia and
[12:05.080 --> 12:11.280]  china saying to obama you don't have the evidence and we're not going to tolerate a military
[12:11.280 --> 12:17.840]  attack very very succinctly said dr. coursey I want to break something down you have never
[12:17.840 --> 12:22.520]  talked like this in the decade that I've been interviewing you or more and I've talked to
[12:22.520 --> 12:28.720]  a lot of other top people on and off air about this colonel shaffer is one of them but many
[12:28.720 --> 12:35.280]  others off record and they all are saying exactly what you're saying and it's so transparent
[12:35.280 --> 12:40.160]  how does obama think he's going to get away with this well again I think the obama administration
[12:40.160 --> 12:44.560]  has gotten to the point where they think they can lie with impunity certainly that's what
[12:44.560 --> 12:49.640]  this appears to be and you know Alex I don't think we've been in a more critical moment
[12:49.640 --> 12:55.720]  since the cuban missile crisis now the cuban missile crisis jack kennedy had photographs
[12:55.720 --> 13:01.920]  of the missiles from u2 flights over cuba and jack kennedy showed those to the world
[13:01.920 --> 13:07.920]  he went to the united nations and he said here's the pictures of the missiles in cuba obama
[13:07.920 --> 13:14.560]  has not done that obama has not presented to the american people or to the un his evidence
[13:14.560 --> 13:21.040]  of the Assad regime being involved in the sarin gas attacks and you've got Assad denying
[13:21.040 --> 13:26.760]  it got russia denying it you've got china denying it all of them with logic on their
[13:26.760 --> 13:34.360]  side and we published at w&d the the videos where you can see with your own eyes the terrorists
[13:34.360 --> 13:40.480]  the rebels the forces obama supporting being the culprits in the gas attacks i want to
[13:40.480 --> 13:46.560]  make a couple of points one first of all people got to realize that you know russia and china
[13:46.560 --> 13:53.640]  are not borrowing a trillion dollars a year to make their budget we are we're in a vastly
[13:53.640 --> 14:01.160]  weakened economic position and the world knows it secondly we're american public opinion
[14:01.160 --> 14:07.120]  is right now is not in favor of a military action and i don't see it changing quickly
[14:07.120 --> 14:14.440]  now when the let's say we have a cruise missile attack or we have a bomber attack over syria
[14:14.440 --> 14:20.640]  if we get involved in a shooting war not just with syria but with russia or with russia
[14:20.640 --> 14:29.480]  and china the ramifications of that are unpredictable and unpredictably frightening because if russia
[14:29.480 --> 14:35.000]  and china say the united states you can't sustain a war economically and you're on the
[14:35.000 --> 14:43.040]  wrong side here and if russia and china stand behind Assad which they are doing we are moving
[14:43.040 --> 14:47.400]  we're escalating the whole conflict beyond the level of surrogates into where we're
[14:47.400 --> 14:52.520]  risking a direct confrontation with russia certainly with russia and giving them the
[14:52.520 --> 14:59.240]  moral high ground which history shows you cannot win a immoral war long term well where is
[14:59.240 --> 15:04.920]  you know at least with jack kennedy the white house he said adlai stevens said it was the
[15:04.920 --> 15:11.760]  un ambassador to the un and he showed the pictures of the missiles in cuba today we
[15:11.760 --> 15:15.520]  don't have a single thing by the way they're coming out with this new dossier but i expect
[15:15.520 --> 15:20.040]  that to be more you know phony baloney as well what are you expecting remember we've
[15:20.040 --> 15:26.200]  had we've gone through this the the leftist the publicity here is amazing to me when it
[15:26.200 --> 15:30.960]  was george w boys saying there were weapons of mass destruction in iraq the left john
[15:30.960 --> 15:37.720]  carrey brock obama were all over the issue saying it was a lie and now you've got obama
[15:37.720 --> 15:43.080]  and carrey using the same lie to advance what could end up being another phony pretext for
[15:43.080 --> 15:47.880]  a phony war i think the american people are can see through this sure we got one minute
[15:47.880 --> 15:52.960]  left bottom line what do you expect to happen in your gut my gut is that the obama administration
[15:52.960 --> 15:56.200]  so far out in the limb they're going to attack and we're going to come to the edge of world
[15:56.200 --> 16:01.120]  war three unfortunately i agree with you i hope everybody's saying their prayers for
[16:01.120 --> 16:05.920]  their children tonight and red people better understand how serious this is it's been one
[16:05.920 --> 16:10.720]  of the most serious serious moments in world history that we have ever faced and they're
[16:10.720 --> 16:16.080]  all doing it because these power mad control freaks that run washington think they're invincible
[16:16.080 --> 16:21.960]  and obama does not want to talk to you about the irs scandal with the tea party groups or
[16:21.960 --> 16:28.880]  the nsa eavesdropping on ben gazi or ben gazi or the fact that we're again out of money
[16:28.880 --> 16:33.120]  and spending another trillion dollars we don't have another controlled budget obama doesn't
[16:33.120 --> 16:36.520]  want these topics doctor we're going to have to get updates from you every day if we can
[16:36.520 --> 16:40.520]  do it i know you've got to go please join us again tomorrow i know you're on top of

[18:19.600 --> 18:25.320]  the hollywood media brainwashing machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas

[21:23.400 --> 21:33.520]  jones show i wanted to get dr roberts on the day he wrote a story that said paul craig
[21:33.520 --> 21:39.440]  roberts dot org and we also have it up on info wars dot com syria another western war
[21:39.440 --> 21:44.440]  crime in the making paul craig roberts and i wanted to get the former head of policy
[21:44.440 --> 21:51.800]  at the treasury father of ergonomics on to give a truly conservative perspective on this
[21:51.800 --> 21:57.400]  and to ask him is it good news that only nine percent of americans in a roiders poll agree
[21:57.400 --> 22:04.400]  with us i think this is the collapse of support and it really shows we have a rogue state kleptocracy
[22:04.400 --> 22:09.840]  in there a but b does he think they'll go ahead and strike dr course he believes they
[22:09.840 --> 22:14.680]  will and it may cause world war three dr roberts thanks for coming on please to be with alex
[22:14.680 --> 22:20.360]  break it down well they're going to strike and of course it was not done by a sod it
[22:20.360 --> 22:25.880]  was staged by the americans and the israelis we've known this from the beginning the minute
[22:25.880 --> 22:32.640]  that obama said there was a line drawn we knew they were gonna have a false flag event
[22:32.640 --> 22:37.760]  the fact that the american people are finally caught on or tired of these wars that don't
[22:37.760 --> 22:45.120]  serve their purposes doesn't matter because washington now is no longer accountable except
[22:45.120 --> 22:52.400]  to a few powerful private interests so i think it will go ahead i don't think nuclear war
[22:52.400 --> 22:58.160]  will result because of this strike but it's going to result because what the united states
[22:58.160 --> 23:07.280]  is doing they're radicalizing the muslims it's a way of destabilizing both russia and
[23:07.280 --> 23:14.160]  china russia has large muslim populations it's bordered by numerous muslim countries
[23:14.160 --> 23:21.080]  china has some muslim populations and borders and so as this radicalization of muslim spreads
[23:21.080 --> 23:27.720]  it spreads into these two countries and becomes destabilizing for them and as well the united
[23:27.720 --> 23:36.520]  states has inside russia hundreds of non-governmental organizations funded with american money whose
[23:36.520 --> 23:45.320]  purpose is to destabilize russia to demand liberalization which is really a way of creating
[23:45.320 --> 23:54.160]  dissenting voices arousing the different nationality passions of the peoples in russia the same
[23:54.160 --> 24:01.400]  in china and china every time an american company locates a new plant or a bank branch
[24:01.400 --> 24:07.760]  in china they create a board and they put on this board the chinese relatives of the
[24:07.760 --> 24:13.640]  local and regional party officials and so that board becomes a way of it's a conduit
[24:13.640 --> 24:22.200]  for money into the regional and local communist party and it creates loyalties that put them
[24:22.200 --> 24:24.640]  at odds with the central government.
[24:24.640 --> 24:31.920]  you know it's a global corporateist takeover above all the nations again dr paul craig roberts joins us he's an economist
[24:31.920 --> 24:36.840]  and also has worked internationally on many deals including the peace deals with the soviet
[24:36.840 --> 24:41.280]  union back in 1991 doctor unfortunately i have to agree with you and all the other experts
[24:41.280 --> 24:45.520]  i talked to agree and i've done my own research i think the only thing that may stop it is
[24:45.520 --> 24:53.520]  the military itself quietly leaking information sabotaging things in a peaceful way kind of
[24:53.520 --> 24:59.440]  blocking what's going on and that's why you see such a focus on persecuting whistleblowers
[24:59.440 --> 25:06.320]  because the the the kleptocrats that have seized control of our central government seem to
[25:06.320 --> 25:12.000]  be concerned about that so i think that shows that that may be a weakness well you know dimsey
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.560]  the chairman of the joint chiefs has warned against it but i think on the whole the military
[25:17.560 --> 25:22.720]  is unable to do anything on what they would have to do would be simply to have a coup
[25:22.720 --> 25:28.080]  but actually the war serves the purpose of the military it serves a military security complex
[25:29.120 --> 25:35.760]  they go along get along generals when they retire they either get to be a pentagon consultants or
[25:35.760 --> 25:40.080]  they become lobbyists sure but it's not going to serve them if we go totally bankrupt and
[25:40.080 --> 25:46.800]  there's a nuclear war i know but everybody thinks about their interests who's looking after me this
[25:46.800 --> 25:55.920]  is my chance i can't rock the boat so it becomes very hard for the military to to do something
[25:55.920 --> 26:03.440]  that's actually against the short run interest of all of the members in the higher ranks so i don't
[26:03.440 --> 26:09.360]  know that we can count on the military stopping it they haven't stopped any of the other wars
[26:10.320 --> 26:14.240]  why do you think they're going ahead with this now to distract from all the scandals to
[26:14.240 --> 26:22.880]  try to get iran to get involved so they can have a wider war well you know it's part of the neoconservative
[26:22.880 --> 26:28.720]  document that they put out and general wesley clark is reported he he was shown the same thing
[26:28.720 --> 26:34.400]  when he visits the pentagon so i think what what it's really about is uh the united states was
[26:34.400 --> 26:41.920]  going to pull off in syria the exactly the same scenario it used in libya only this time the russians
[26:41.920 --> 26:48.480]  and the chinese vetoed the no-fly zone because they they had learned that the no-fly zone was
[26:48.480 --> 26:55.200]  actually something the americans and they used for attacking qaddafi's forces so they vetoed it so
[26:55.200 --> 27:04.240]  the americans had already washington had already instigated the outside jihadists going into syria
[27:04.240 --> 27:09.840]  to overthrow the secular president and yet there was no air support and so the american
[27:09.840 --> 27:15.760]  backs forces the washington backed forces are being defeated and so they've got to find some
[27:16.320 --> 27:24.240]  way to come to the aid of the forces and so that's what this chemical weapons uh false flag attack
[27:24.240 --> 27:30.320]  is all about it gives washington an excuse to run in there and rescue the forces that it sent to work
[27:31.040 --> 27:36.000]  sir uh joel scalzen who does world affairs brief has has has been very accurate in his analysis
[27:36.000 --> 27:43.520]  as have you been he believes that the anglo-american power structure is trying to get russia and
[27:43.520 --> 27:48.240]  china to start a nuclear war and that they believe out of that global crisis they'll be able to create
[27:48.240 --> 27:52.960]  a new police state here roll out some of the space-based weapons they've got to defeat them
[27:52.960 --> 27:59.520]  and finally have world domination and that this is truly uh a megalomaniacal thing that's happening
[27:59.520 --> 28:04.720]  what's your take on that analysis well we already have a police state they already have that and
[28:04.720 --> 28:12.000]  nobody survives nuclear war i mean there won't be any survivors so i think uh sure that that's an
[28:12.000 --> 28:18.560]  incorrect analysis and uh okay okay well you and i could see the end of this and he can see the end
[28:18.560 --> 28:22.480]  of it and then everybody else i talked to that's intelligent could see the end of it what is the
[28:22.480 --> 28:27.360]  power structure thinking then if they don't want world war three why are they trying to start it
[28:27.360 --> 28:32.880]  or are they so arrogant like don corezine making 40 to one bets uh in the stock market that they
[28:32.880 --> 28:38.480]  just think they're invincible well they probably are full of hubris and they're full of the ideology
[28:38.480 --> 28:44.480]  that they're indispensable and exceptional but they're also counting on winning they're counting on
[28:44.480 --> 28:50.000]  their strategy of destabilizing russia and china working i mean they did we washington does have
[28:50.000 --> 28:58.240]  fifth columns in both countries and so if radicalizing the muslim populations causes more instability
[28:58.240 --> 29:03.440]  than washington says we can win so they're they're banking on winning without the nuclear war but
[29:03.440 --> 29:07.920]  what they're overlooking is that that's the only weapons that china and russia would have to stop
[29:07.920 --> 29:13.120]  this so i think it would come out will all be simply destroyed it'd be the end of life on earth
[29:14.400 --> 29:19.280]  and they also like to use the radical muslims they're flooding the u.s and europe with as another
[29:19.280 --> 29:23.760]  way to destabilize and then take all our liberties from the threat they literally created dr paul

[34:40.000 --> 34:46.320]  ladies and gentlemen we are back here on this sunday transmission playing some of
[34:46.320 --> 34:51.920]  the most important clips of the weekday broadcast coming up russell brand premiere interview i did
[34:51.920 --> 34:56.880]  friday night that's coming up to be exclusively premiered here on the sunday transmission but
[34:56.880 --> 35:02.720]  first off i want to go back to the day before uh the last clip you heard with dr corcy when he was
[35:02.720 --> 35:07.840]  getting into the muslim brotherhood connection to obama and i've researched this myself this is
[35:07.840 --> 35:14.560]  just bombshell info about how treacherous this federal government has gotten led by this globalist
[35:14.560 --> 35:21.840]  uh barak hussein obama so here's a key clip with dr corcy all right i wanted to get for the balance
[35:21.840 --> 35:27.680]  of the hour dr jerome corcy on because i saw an article he did for wnd dot com world net daily
[35:27.680 --> 35:33.680]  last friday about obama's connections to his cousins and muslim brotherhood well odinga
[35:33.680 --> 35:37.680]  was made to be the prime minister after they rioted and killed people all over the country
[35:37.680 --> 35:43.600]  and obama's senatorial emails are public we advise him how to do it uh so yes obama is muslim
[35:43.600 --> 35:48.240]  brotherhood but from my research but that's another cover they're just manipulating that group so
[35:48.240 --> 35:52.480]  i wanted to segue into that briefly then get dr corcy because he's worked in security in the middle
[35:52.480 --> 35:58.240]  east uh as a contractor to the state department and other things get his take on where all this is
[35:58.240 --> 36:04.160]  going and uh the chemical attack that i think all the evidence shows was a false flag dr corcy
[36:04.160 --> 36:09.360]  has a phd from harvard university of political science and he's currently a senior writer for
[36:09.360 --> 36:15.200]  world net daily and he's got a whole bunch of number one uh new york times best sellers and
[36:15.200 --> 36:19.680]  we'll tell you about those as well uh but dr corcy we're going to break it about two minutes
[36:19.680 --> 36:25.360]  briefly what is your your take uh on the situation with all this muslim brotherhood news coming out
[36:25.360 --> 36:32.240]  in uh obama's family well i think the the bottom line is that the egyptian government the current
[36:32.240 --> 36:39.120]  government the military have decided to out the muslim brotherhood they're prosecuting the muslim
[36:39.120 --> 36:44.400]  brotherhood in the process they want the world to know that the obama administration is very tightly
[36:45.040 --> 36:53.680]  tied to the muslim brotherhood uh including in financial ties to the obama family so the news
[36:53.680 --> 37:01.680]  we're going to talk about is news that wnd got when it was released by the egyptian government
[37:02.480 --> 37:05.200]  asking for the united states press to pick up the story
[37:05.200 --> 37:11.840]  wow and you've written quite a few articles on this uh the latest i saw was on friday we should
[37:11.840 --> 37:16.080]  check world net daily is there a new article out and give us the headline we'll put that on screen
[37:16.080 --> 37:22.800]  well i i have a new article out right now today that's the article it argues from some sources in
[37:22.800 --> 37:30.080]  the middle east that uh the intention of the egyptian government when these trials began
[37:30.080 --> 37:35.520]  from the muslim brotherhood is to implicate uh president obama directly that's bombshell
[37:36.160 --> 37:41.040]  in a series of uh financial transactions with the muslim brotherhood in egypt
[37:42.240 --> 37:48.720]  the egyptian government sent out the ahead of the i was a vice president for the supreme
[37:48.720 --> 37:56.480]  constitutional court of egypt her name was tahani al jibali and she gave a speech and then several
[37:56.480 --> 38:02.160]  interviews in egyptian television in which she said she wanted the american people to know
[38:02.880 --> 38:09.040]  that president obama's brother was managing the money of the muslim brotherhood in egypt
[38:09.760 --> 38:15.760]  and that brother is uh we've identified as malik obama who is in kenya but the
[38:16.560 --> 38:22.400]  that's what what jibali said was very important that she once said we want to inform the american
[38:22.400 --> 38:28.720]  people that their president's brother obama is one of the architects of the major investments of the
[38:28.720 --> 38:35.040]  muslim brotherhood in egypt said we will carry out the law the americans will not stop us we need to
[38:35.040 --> 38:41.520]  open the files and begin court sessions she said further that the obama administration knows they've
[38:41.520 --> 38:47.520]  supported terrorism we're going to open these files so the nations know the truth and the obama
[38:47.520 --> 38:53.920]  administration is exposed that they have collaborated with terrorists and it's this reason that the
[38:53.920 --> 39:01.360]  administration fights us so it's a clear attempt by the egyptian government to out and embarrass the
[39:01.360 --> 39:07.600]  obama administration for supporting the egyptian brotherhood in egypt you know i i don't just
[39:07.600 --> 39:14.080]  believe what they say i've done so much research like you have i know his cousin odinga was the
[39:14.080 --> 39:19.040]  treasurer for the brotherhood they burned half the country down obama advised him in emails as
[39:19.040 --> 39:24.560]  you know i want you to give people some history so this all fits he and his family would become
[39:24.560 --> 39:29.760]  like the offshore dictators of the middle east with the muslim brotherhood funneling them all the
[39:29.760 --> 39:35.760]  money my gosh now it makes sense because these aren't just allegations from egypt when i was
[39:35.760 --> 39:41.120]  reading your article i'm like wait this has come out before in this country this has come out before
[39:41.120 --> 39:47.120]  in sudan it's come out before in kenya and then it all clicked they're going to burn down the middle
[39:47.120 --> 39:52.720]  east and hand it all over to themselves as a mafia this is unbelievable and then the magnitude
[39:53.840 --> 39:58.720]  of of the egyptian military turning against it defending the christians cnn calling them when
[39:58.720 --> 40:04.640]  they kill 25 cops calling them activists that cnn's involved in this am i right in saying that if
[40:04.640 --> 40:09.840]  this all comes out dr corcy this could bring down this criminal faction of the new world order
[40:09.840 --> 40:14.960]  you've got the floor give us the history all of it how big this is do you agree with what i just said
[40:14.960 --> 40:20.000]  well i i think you're right alex let me let's detail some of it i mean the article i published
[40:20.000 --> 40:27.200]  over the weekend which shows a documented in an egyptian government document that we got out of
[40:27.200 --> 40:34.560]  the middle east wnd and what this is is it's a government document listing from the minister
[40:34.560 --> 40:43.120]  of foreign affairs the names of muslim brotherhood leaders in egypt and the amount in bribes that
[40:43.120 --> 40:49.040]  they were paid in us dollars by the obama administration with the money sent through
[40:49.040 --> 40:57.200]  the u.s embassy in chiral the money paid over the morse government to the minister of foreign
[40:57.200 --> 41:04.240]  affairs and then handed out to this list of muslim brotherhood leaders and they came in the muslim
[41:04.240 --> 41:09.920]  brotherhood leaders and signed for the money it's a receipt the amounts of money paid are up to
[41:09.920 --> 41:16.160]  eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year and this is an authenticated document it's going
[41:16.160 --> 41:24.480]  to be presented at the trials of the muslim brotherhood in chiral alleging that these muslim
[41:24.480 --> 41:31.440]  brotherhood leaders are spies working for obama being paid by the obama administration and here's
[41:31.440 --> 41:36.880]  the documentary evidence of it which we have an advance of the trial through our sources in chiral
[41:36.880 --> 41:43.760]  it's incredible i mean it's a list of the muslim brotherhood bad guys being paid hundreds of thousands
[41:43.760 --> 41:48.880]  of dollars off the books by the united states government the obama administration through our
[41:48.880 --> 41:56.720]  embassy in chiral paid via the morse government this document was obtained when the morse government
[41:56.720 --> 42:04.000]  was deposed and the military went in and occupied the offices this is unbelievable uh is this why
[42:04.000 --> 42:08.240]  they're trying to ratchet up the syria thing right now is a distraction and and what do you expect
[42:08.240 --> 42:14.080]  them to do to try to cover this up and and how are things going for the democratic socialist
[42:14.080 --> 42:18.880]  communist wing of the new world order in their takeover of the middle east well this is going to
[42:18.880 --> 42:24.800]  be explosive because the egyptian government has enounced in the newspapers we've incite the newspapers
[42:24.800 --> 42:32.400]  in the middle east this newspaper ala ala saroon which published in egypt over the weekend that
[42:32.400 --> 42:37.360]  this document existed it was going to be introduced at the trials of the muslim brotherhood and the
[42:37.360 --> 42:43.360]  egyptian government has come out and said they want to expose the obama administration's ties
[42:43.360 --> 42:48.560]  terrorists namely the muslim brotherhood in egypt remember the muslim brotherhood before the morse
[42:48.560 --> 42:55.120]  government came in was outlawed under mubarak in egypt it was an outlaw organization when when
[42:55.120 --> 43:01.040]  most when morse came in won the election brought in the mother muslim brotherhood obama celebrated
[43:01.040 --> 43:07.440]  and he said this was a positive development now it turns out that obama had been paying
[43:07.440 --> 43:14.640]  administration had been paying muslim brotherhood under the table through our embassy in chiral
[43:14.640 --> 43:20.320]  with the cooperation uh we even have the receipt with the signed signatures on it of the muslim
[43:20.320 --> 43:25.360]  brotherhood members that got paid these hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes now this document
[43:25.360 --> 43:30.320]  is going to be an explosive document all through the middle east because it puts the obama administration
[43:30.320 --> 43:36.880]  on the side of the muslim brotherhood terrorists under the table i mean this makes things like
[43:36.880 --> 43:46.080]  iran contra pail in significance compared to the magnitude of um this behavior which when fully
[43:46.080 --> 43:51.360]  documented i think is going to lead to trees and charges i mean i think it's of that magnitude

[48:41.040 --> 48:46.400]  and we are back live i want to play a little bit more of this just astonishingly important
[48:46.400 --> 48:51.760]  information that is now coming out in federal court in egypt with the government formally
[48:51.760 --> 48:56.560]  allies with this country stabbed in the back by obama al-qaeda allowed to murder police
[48:56.560 --> 49:01.120]  military blow-up churches by the hundreds get away with everything and now their own government
[49:01.120 --> 49:05.760]  bringing out the documents and then they posted them on the news site worldnet daily we have them
[49:05.760 --> 49:13.680]  on info wars dot com as well this is so insane that that our government's trying to put al-qaeda
[49:13.680 --> 49:18.480]  in all of the middle east let's go back to the conclusion of this information then we'll go to
[49:18.480 --> 49:23.600]  break stationery will have the news we'll come back with a second hour russell brand and more
[49:23.600 --> 49:29.520]  greg palest as well but here's the conclusion of dr gerome coursey and obama selling a sound
[49:29.520 --> 49:35.360]  to the muslim jihadis all right doc we got you how does this tie into bin gazi because we know
[49:35.360 --> 49:39.280]  there was a cover up there the missiles being transferred we know elements of the government
[49:39.280 --> 49:46.400]  did not want to back al-qaeda it looks like that obama and his controllers may be running a rogue
[49:46.400 --> 49:51.920]  operation and if so who is behind it i mean it's not just obama well let's first deal with
[49:51.920 --> 49:59.040]  but gazi because we reported wnd reported and now we've been working with um walley chobat who is
[49:59.040 --> 50:04.960]  also published alongside wnd walley is one of our sources he's former plo arabic speaking
[50:05.600 --> 50:14.320]  and you remember in bin gazi when we ran wnd those clips of the the late comers the second wave of
[50:14.320 --> 50:20.320]  the attack of the terrorists on the bin gazi compound and when they entered they said don't
[50:20.320 --> 50:28.080]  shoot at us we are on your side we're from egypt morseys sent us and in fact in the tape even if
[50:28.080 --> 50:33.040]  you can't speak arabic you can hear them say morseys because morseys was the guy now this is
[50:33.680 --> 50:43.440]  egyptian terrorists in libya attacking our embassy in bin gazi now we at that time had put it together
[50:43.440 --> 50:49.520]  with the idea that the muslim brotherhood which was behind the attacks from egypt on
[50:49.520 --> 50:58.080]  bin gazi were angling to try to with the morsey government get obama to release the blind chic
[50:58.640 --> 51:02.800]  and we have not ruled out yet that one of the theories behind the bin gazi attack
[51:03.520 --> 51:10.880]  was to kidnap ambassador stevens and exchange him for the blind chic and it seems like this was kind
[51:10.880 --> 51:18.160]  of a behind the scenes back back room deal between the obama administration perhaps the cia
[51:18.960 --> 51:25.920]  and the muslim brotherhood in egypt operating with full sanction of the egyptian government
[51:25.920 --> 51:32.240]  under morseys but it would mean that in a sense we ourselves through the cia may have been responsible
[51:32.960 --> 51:39.360]  for the attack and that we were supporting the muslim brotherhood in egypt that sent terrorists
[51:39.360 --> 51:45.360]  to bin gazi in libya to attack the embassy that's pretty incredible stuff well exactly i mean i had
[51:45.360 --> 51:50.080]  one of those moments that's why i brought up in gazi we're at all crystallized and i saw that
[51:50.080 --> 51:55.280]  triangle from kenya and what's already been on record and what your book exposed with the documents
[51:55.280 --> 52:00.240]  with odinga and obama and emails but we'll just have riots and they'll make you part of the
[52:00.240 --> 52:04.800]  government and then you see worldwide what's going on this is what i want to ask you we know the big
[52:04.800 --> 52:08.960]  banks are behind obama the globalist but geopolitically i look at what's going on there's something
[52:08.960 --> 52:15.520]  else there who do you think obama really works for well i mean i think it's it's hard to say but i
[52:15.520 --> 52:21.360]  mean first your idea about money motives that there's money motives here i think is quite right
[52:22.000 --> 52:27.440]  because you know you've got obama's brother now managing the money of the of the muslim brotherhood
[52:27.440 --> 52:33.040]  don't forget the terrorism is big business so there's a lot of money involved here a lot of money
[52:33.040 --> 52:37.920]  being stolen look at that list of bribes the bribes are being paid eight hundred and fifty thousand
[52:37.920 --> 52:42.880]  dollars a year seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars individually individually that's a lot
[52:42.880 --> 52:46.880]  of money in the middle east to get eight hundred fifty thousand a lot of money anywhere to get eight
[52:46.880 --> 52:53.280]  hundred fifty thousand dollars income tax free unrecorded just here's the cash in your pocket
[52:53.280 --> 52:58.960]  which is the way the muslim brotherhood was being paid the cash through the morsea government
[52:58.960 --> 53:03.600]  after it received the cash from the state department but i want to go to one of your other points
[53:04.560 --> 53:10.320]  also here alex because what it looks like is that the obama administration is trying to pin
[53:11.040 --> 53:17.840]  these um nerve gas attacks on Assad now russia has said increasingly that you know there's
[53:17.840 --> 53:24.000]  no evidence that the Assad government is behind these nerve gas attacks and i think the truth is
[53:24.000 --> 53:30.160]  that the the evidence is very very thin that the the Assad government can be blamed for these attacks
[53:30.160 --> 53:36.400]  i know there's a drum roll obama's not got the un in in inspecting but it's equal probability
[53:36.960 --> 53:42.000]  and i think some pretty good evidence that maybe it's the the rebels that we're backing
[53:42.640 --> 53:48.320]  who may have launched the nerve attacks and again that question's not yet but you ask what's the
[53:48.320 --> 53:54.960]  false flag i mean clearly if we can have an invasion of syria with the u.s military forces involved
[53:54.960 --> 54:00.560]  or cruise missile attacks it takes the headlines away from the obama administration paying the
[54:00.560 --> 54:05.600]  muslim brotherhood under the carpet through the embassy in Cairo but but i mean look i know there's
[54:05.600 --> 54:10.080]  corrupt forces in the government it's an empire and it wants to take over and all the rest of this
[54:10.080 --> 54:14.400]  but there's a lot of evidence israel's working with these rebels as well you've got france really
[54:14.400 --> 54:18.960]  sure leading when they're using on the sidelines i want to get your take on why that is and i've
[54:18.960 --> 54:22.880]  had a bunch of special forces in military call in last hour they said yes what you're saying is
[54:22.880 --> 54:27.360]  exactly what we see going on but it's been on record you've got these extremists being staged
[54:27.360 --> 54:33.040]  at bases in iraq and in uh turkey you've had turkey bombarding them with artillery and this is a
[54:33.040 --> 54:38.480]  two and a half year attempt to cut that country up and look if they took a saw it out and like
[54:38.480 --> 54:44.880]  put some real republican i'd say okay whatever but that's unconstitutional this is so immoral how
[54:44.880 --> 54:50.400]  does washington and nato think they're going to get away with turning that country or half of it over
[54:50.400 --> 54:54.960]  to al qaeda when they're pulling over truck drivers who aren't well hobbyists and shooting them in the
[54:54.960 --> 55:01.120]  head on video cutting christians heads off blowing up every church i mean i i really take it personal
[55:01.120 --> 55:05.600]  that the churches the media even conservative media are not standing up for one of the oldest
[55:05.600 --> 55:11.120]  christian communities in the world and that and that cnn's helping cover it up it makes me realize
[55:11.120 --> 55:17.360]  man there's really some weird hatred of christians not just by the wahhabist but by the so-called
[55:17.360 --> 55:22.240]  liberals who are really uh who really are more criminal than i thought these are sick freaks i
[55:22.240 --> 55:27.520]  mean who are these people why do they want to do this well and remember one of the early purposes
[55:27.520 --> 55:33.600]  we've been reporting on this at wnd all along but what uh what ambassador stevens was doing in him
[55:33.600 --> 55:39.520]  and bengazi and now it appears clear that was a cia compound there were cia operatives on the
[55:39.520 --> 55:46.000]  ground that night uh the last meeting that stevens had was dinner with one of the diplomatic
[55:46.000 --> 55:52.640]  representatives from turkey it looks like the whole purpose of that compound was to run weapons
[55:52.640 --> 55:58.560]  out of libya via turkey to get them into the hand we both had that info a week after it happened
[55:58.560 --> 56:03.200]  and now it's been confirmed which just shows how this is all an open secret that's my point no one
[56:03.200 --> 56:09.280]  seems to care to hide it anymore and also you know there are no good guys in this story there i mean
[56:09.280 --> 56:15.680]  if we the the rebels that obama wants to support are fundamentally al-qaeda and many of them come
[56:15.680 --> 56:22.240]  from libya after having attacked our embassy remember alex no one has ever been identified by
[56:22.240 --> 56:27.680]  the obama administration as responsible for the bengazi oh yeah they say it's a protest over our
[56:27.680 --> 56:32.400]  first amendment and then they arrest the guy that put out the video that's protected it's the only
[56:32.400 --> 56:39.360]  in jail there's nobody none of the attackers after all these months are in jail in in any
[56:39.360 --> 56:43.920]  country in northern africa for the bengazi attack all right well listen listen i agree with you that
[56:43.920 --> 56:49.600]  if this gets out this is bigger than bengazi altogether bengazi's part of it but the media
[56:49.600 --> 56:54.560]  is so controlled they call people with rocket launchers and tanks activists and protesters
[56:55.200 --> 56:59.600]  and and then criticize the egyptian military which i'm not in some lovefest with them either but
[56:59.600 --> 57:03.520]  compared to compared to the radical muslim brotherhood running around blowing up churches
[57:03.520 --> 57:08.080]  every day i mean what do you expect the military to do well that's the problem i see the the point
[57:08.080 --> 57:15.600]  is here when you've got obama lining up on the side of a sod obama also lined up on the side of
[57:15.600 --> 57:22.720]  morsey and he funded the muslim brotherhood that's the evidence we've been reporting in wnd it's
[57:22.720 --> 57:27.600]  direct funding in the muslim brotherhood let me ask you this then everything's mounting against
[57:27.600 --> 57:32.400]  obama his approval ratings plunging he's got all his advisors saying we need a false flag in the
[57:32.400 --> 57:38.080]  financial times of london uh washington post they go gee a terror attack was your help like almost
[57:38.080 --> 57:44.880]  encouraging him it's so thinly veiled i expect him to pull some big big staged event well that's
[57:44.880 --> 57:50.880]  what i think you know the whole the the concern about it's all the hours before we attack syria
[57:50.880 --> 57:58.480]  as soon as us military are involved in attack on syria well then you've got a situation where it
[57:58.480 --> 58:02.880]  you know that becomes the news us has gone to war with syria and there might actually be real stuff
[58:03.920 --> 58:08.400]  iran has come out saying they're going to fire scuds at israel if this starts so and then russia
[58:08.400 --> 58:13.040]  comes in this could be world war three how about russia russia's not going to let a sod go down
[58:13.040 --> 58:19.120]  without a fight and neither is iran you know this is obama taking on russia directly or
[58:19.120 --> 58:24.320]  indirectly through a sod but i mean it's clearly a direct confrontation the russians are there it is
[58:24.320 --> 58:31.280]  a direct you know but remember the at the core of this is evidence the egyptian government's
[58:31.280 --> 58:36.640]  going to use the trials of the muslim brotherhood the obama administration has been paying under
[58:36.640 --> 58:40.800]  the table you guys explain what that's going to mean when we come back i want to take a few phone

[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:30.560]  continue to expand the premeditated war to wreck syria and put something in 10 times worse
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:37.520]  conservatively than Assad regardless the the jig is up the the train has left the station
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:45.760]  nine percent approval rating in the united states similar numbers in europe against launching this
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:51.760]  war expanding this war they've already launched it with the proxy forces for two and a half years
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:58.480]  it it shows that there is a huge awakening taking place and coming up we've got some very important
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:04.720]  information with greg palast on larry summers who they want he was already head of the treasury
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.280]  now they want to make him the head of the private run for profit federal reserve and since he's the
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:15.840]  main architect he even gets the credit himself he it's admitted in his own banker loving publications
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.240]  out there that he helped engineer the end of glass steagle the derivatives so why not put one of the
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:29.600]  main criminals who's behind all this in charge that is coming up but you got to remember that it
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:41.280]  hasn't been since eight 1782 that the british parliament has said no to a prime minister asking
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:48.160]  for a war so that's over 200 years and you'll probably notice that 1782 is when the war ended
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:53.840]  here in the colonies we officially had won the war to become the united states of america
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:03:01.840]  that's how big a deal this is that that the parliament in england before 1776 and that
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:10.080]  war kicked off was set to vote against the war and then the king of england rode famously and
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.120]  addressed parliament which was unheard of and they said okay we'll launch the war and then seven
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.880]  years later or six years later six and a half years later they had to back off and stop not
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:25.520]  even because the colonies had won most the battles they'd lost most of them they persevered though
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:30.240]  they didn't give up they continued they kept hammering and hammering and hammering and that's
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:38.720]  why i say resistance is is victory so that is coming up in the next segment reg palace breaking
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:44.960]  down with the bankers are up to more news and the latest on syria and then i did a 30 minute
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.080]  interview with russell brand friday night while i'm sitting here recording this just a little
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.280]  while ago and we're going to premiere that for the radio audience coming up and a lot of you
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:00.880]  know who he is some may not but anybody under 30 does he's one of the big cult icons right now
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.200]  and luckily he's talking about the new world order and the brainwashing of the public and
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:10.800]  and the charity and how they want to keep us dumbed down and and so it's great i mean we won't
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.200]  agree with him on every political issue but the fact is he's definitely moving in our direction
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:21.600]  anti-establishment waking up paradigm shattering systems and he follows me on twitter at real
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:26.240]  alex jones and he has like six million followers so that's important to be able to reach out to
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:30.960]  his his audience of people that we wouldn't be able to get to so it was exciting to talk to him
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:36.720]  and so far only my crews heard this you're going to get a chance to hear it uh coming up
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:40.800]  in the last three segments of the shower if we talk to greg palestin some people will say all
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.640]  is the big deal here and from that guy again come on we're not just trying to convert the converted
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:55.280]  or talk to the the choir here i'm here to get krs one op or professor griff hip hop icons or to get
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:03.200]  charlie sheen on or to get vego mortensen on uh or to get uh just all sorts here all the amazing
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:08.720]  guess we have because we get to hear what they have to say we get to show you who they really are
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:13.520]  instead of who the media distorts and says they are and then we also get to then reach out to all
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:20.080]  of their fan base and that's how you network the liberty movement uh to really change the course
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:24.080]  of history and that's why it's big to brzezinski said two days ago i guess four days ago now if it's
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:29.440]  on sunday uh that oh my gosh the alternative media has destroyed us they all know how we're staging
[01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:34.880]  stuff we're i mean he's putting out a mayday to the elite right now just like the pentagon of
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:39.120]  a month ago put out a mayday about the drudge report you know that they get caught in all their
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:43.040]  lives because drudge will just put up what they said previously showing how they're engaged in
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:49.280]  disinfo so we're on the march the empire's on the run whether you're black white old young liberal
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:54.320]  conservative whatever the terms are if you love justice if you love freedom if you love the truth

[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:47.360]  you've got but what is your take on lining up against russia with syria and the i mean these
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:51.840]  rebels have been caught staging false flags before why are we supposed to believe them now why would
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:10:00.000]  Assad nerve gas right in front of the u n so he can be blown up well i don't you know to me it looks
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:05.520]  like these people were gassed the question is of course who i think it's a sod he's not exactly a
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:11.680]  genius but don't forget no no but i believe it i believe people were gassed great greg yeah i'm
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:18.000]  saying i'm saying i don't think he did it well i don't know i mean but what we do know is that you
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.960]  know we look let's remember just like Saddam Hussein Assad Saddam Hussein they all come from
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:30.000]  the same frankenstein factory you got to go back to the years of of carter and bush democrats and
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:37.120]  republicans putting these guys into positions of power in the mid east and then you know like it
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:41.200]  often happens when you create frankenstein's they get up off the table and try to kill you or kill
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:46.160]  someone else they're out of control well shifting yours out of that you've got a big story out now
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.600]  uh on larry summers our new special treasury secretary i mean i think he's the man for the job
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:57.600]  if he helped engineer the too big to fail ponzi scheme derivatives deals and you know the credit
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:03.920]  default swaps why not make him emperor of the earth well i because he's not in my opinion actually
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:11.280]  human my information is that larry summers uh who is obama's first choice for uh the federal reserve
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:18.320]  board to take ben bernanke's place is lemmy winks from um from south park well i think that he's
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:23.760]  actually uh a colony of aliens sent here to turn the human race into a cheap source of protein
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:32.240]  but in all seriousness uh larry summers is obama's first choice for the head of the federal reserve
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:38.800]  board take bernanke's place he was secretary treasury under clinton where he where he with robert
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:46.080]  rubin pushed and created the whole deregulation of banking system turning your bank vaults into
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:55.680]  roulette wheels um and he's the guy that personally personally um body blocked all regulation of the
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:01.680]  derivatives market all these financial toxic assets like synthetic collateralized debt obligations
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:06.400]  which we lived without by the way for several thousand years and suddenly we had to have these
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:12.320]  things which brought our planet financially to its knees this is so this is larry summers the
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:19.200]  mayor you know he's kind of the typhoid merry of economics and now he's back as obama's first
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:26.160]  choice for uh the fed the key thing is and of course he was obama's uh economics czar that
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:31.280]  worked out really well we have fewer jobs fewer people working today than we did when obama took
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:37.360]  the oath of office so unemployment's down because employment is way down people just don't have
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:41.840]  jobs i was just in detroit there's no one's looking for jobs so they're not in the technically
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:47.280]  auto workers out of work are not in the workforce okay so understand what's going on here this is
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:56.320]  this is obama's economics czar mr deregulation now my story which i did for for um uh that i was
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:05.280]  doing for um bbc television guardian my story is that i found inside documents confidential documents
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:10.400]  which uh were so unbelievable that i had to fly to geneva switzerland speak to the head of the
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:16.720]  wto himself to get the confirmation that these things are real it was documents in which timothy
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:23.760]  geithner later to become uh secretary of treasury under obama was writing to his boss at the time
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:31.440]  tim uh larry summers of treasury saying reminding him about the meetings that they had and that he
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:38.000]  had to make phone calls to the five most powerful bankers in america the head of of city bank the
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:45.360]  head of goldman sacks um merrill bank of america uh he he took the five big bankers and he had secret
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:52.880]  phone calls with them on a scheme to blow apart regulation of the banking system worldwide now
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:58.560]  it he called it the end game memo as we reached the end game well we're the end game i don't like
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.680]  the game at all but the the end of it was not too pretty it was extraordinary because you have to
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:09.520]  understand it's illegal he can't he's not allowed to meet larry summers not to allow to have private
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:16.080]  phone calls with billionaire bankers to determine what the what the uh financial policies of the
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:20.800]  united states should be now he can have meetings with bankers that's legal you can't have secret
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:26.320]  meetings with bankers to get their approval and veto and determination of what our policies
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:32.320]  should be and in this case it was deadly because it was a plan to blow apart the regulations of
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:38.800]  banking in 156 nations and they did it in 155 nations they did it by abusing the world trade
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:47.920]  organizations trade rule 156 nations were told by larry summers and his coterie that unless they
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:53.200]  opened up their banking sectors the city bank goldman sacks bank of america and the rest of the
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:59.040]  boys that uh any nation would have their markets closed to the united states and they'd go bankrupt
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:04.080]  uh i want to expand on something here with you though i mean i understand you not taking sides
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.600]  on the whole you know a sod thing because he's obviously a bad guy but putting al-qaeda in is
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:16.000]  even worse i i mean yeah i mean look we did this we don't forget who put in the mujahideen in in
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.960]  afghanistan that we're now that we have uh how many kids 2000 kids have died there fighting the
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:24.240]  guys that we armed in the first place and a couple thousand from suicide well shifting
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:29.920]  gears out of that we'll cover it as it unfolds you've got a big story out now uh on larry summers
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:35.120]  our new special treasury secretary i mean i think he's the man for the job if he helped engineer
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:40.640]  the too big to fail ponzi scheme derivatives deals since you know the credit default swaps
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:46.320]  why not make him emperor of the earth well i because he's not in my opinion actually human
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:53.280]  my information is that larry summers uh who is obama's first choice for uh the federal reserve
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:16:00.320]  board to take ben benanti's place is lemmy winks from um from south park well i think that he's
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:05.760]  actually uh a colony of aliens sent here to turn the human race into a cheap source of protein
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:13.840]  but in all seriousness uh larry summers is obama's first choice for the head of the federal
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:19.360]  reserve board to take ben anki's place he was secretary treasury under clinton where he
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:26.240]  where he with robert rubin pushed and created the whole deregulation the banking system
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:32.880]  turning your bank vaults into roulette wheels um and he's the guy that personally personally
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:40.880]  um body block all regulation of the derivatives market all these financial toxic assets like
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:46.240]  synthetic collateralized debt obligations which we've lived without by the way for several

[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:22.320]  well folks i've wanted to get him on for a long time russel brand who is a comedian best-selling
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:28.320]  author actor tv host you name it who has been popular for many years he's really a sensation
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:33.280]  now the whole office today when they found out he was coming on i got really excited we have a
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:42.000]  lot of a lot of big guests on and and what's exciting about this is that russel brand is
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.400]  outside the box and and he's getting people to think and obviously it went viral all over the
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:53.680]  world a few months ago when he confronted kind of the talking heads that are on the
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:01.520]  mainstream media msnbc channel with mika brzezinski and so russel brand he's doing his
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:07.280]  worldwide tour right now joins us russel thanks for giving us some time alex it's a
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:10.880]  privilege to be on your show thank you oh it's a privilege to have you here what's the best
[01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:17.040]  site for people to visit to find out about the the tour is it russel brand dot tv yeah that'd be
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:22.800]  perfect thanks you bet bottom line what is front and center most important to you right now that's
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:28.400]  happening in the world i think the thing that is most important to me the thing that i'm talking
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:33.440]  about in my show is the cultural narratives that we are told the way that we are presented with
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:39.440]  information the way that meaning is designated the significance that is given to certain issues
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:45.120]  and not to others and the light in which stories are told so i think that that could obviously
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:52.480]  comprise uh edward snowden or it could comprise syria it could comprise that more broadly the
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:58.640]  manufacture of consent or the manipulation of the consciousness of civilization through a
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:04.880]  conglomeration and conglomeration of government big business and media coming into this interview
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:10.240]  we played a clip uh when you were on msnbc and that really struck a chord with people when you
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:15.120]  just laughed at their narcissism and said you don't talk about anything real you're basically a
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:22.080]  bunch of peacocks up here uh what was it like behind the scenes and and and and it seemed like
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:28.480]  you were clashing with them uh and it really captured people's imagination what what happened
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:34.640]  there because you were in the middle of it well i mean it's quite typical when you go on those type
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:41.600]  of tv shows that there's a particular frequency or pitch to the interview there's a normal manner
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:50.560]  of speaking not only the type of topics that are discussed but the kind of uh banal slightly shrill
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:24:00.880]  tone that the information that is predicates on celebrity and gossip and what i would call low
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:07.040]  frequency data low vibration information so like it was like that so it's like that when you go on
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:11.040]  anything on mainstream television those programs all sound the same people all look the same they
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:16.880]  all talk in the same way and it was that kind of atmosphere um the only difference was it is that
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:22.720]  that that the impoliteness was at such an extreme level that gave me an opportunity to point out
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.960]  some of that stuff which i wouldn't typically do because it sometimes doesn't seem appropriate to
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:32.480]  tell people that what they're doing is pointless or silly i want to get into world events your
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:37.120]  term that's so popular that i hope to see when you come to austin in a few weeks here in texas
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:44.560]  but just getting back to that they genuinely seemed extremely uncomfortable but the women
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:51.440]  also seemed very sexually excited and were not not faking it i mean i could tell that somehow you
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:57.840]  absolutely like broke the spell of their self-centered petty narcissism and i'm not kissing your
[01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:04.080]  butt i mean it really happened that's a magic clip uh from my perspective you've become nervous
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:09.120]  why are you nervous you're a powerful woman you've got a lovely job what seems to be the
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:16.000]  trouble you've got a hair like princess diane oh wow is this what you all do for a living yes we're
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.040]  going to be uh talking about the uh the talk situation with edward snowden this whistleblower
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:26.400]  is it good what he's done for america or are our secrets being jeopardized by his intentions we're
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:31.120]  going to be talking about that why do you think you shook him up so bad i don't know i'm a bit
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:34.960]  confused by it because i just went on then did what i normally do is just be polite and then if
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:41.040]  i point out something idiosyncratic or weird i observe that but then you think alex that sort of
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:46.320]  you deal with so much stupidity whether in a situation where you're in an interview on the tv
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:52.160]  or on the radio or if you're making a purchase in a shop sometimes we lose our authenticity our
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:57.520]  ability to be human and truthful with one another so i think if you interact in a very human and
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:02.400]  truthful way then that's just can be very disruptive yeah it's not like there are certain
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.560]  individuals that are good and certain individuals that are bad i know myself that you know i work in
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:12.240]  films and i've worked a lot in media so i must be culpable as well for propagating these ideas and
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:19.120]  supporting them in my own way and on a bad day like just now uh i arrived at uh at fiatto airport
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:23.440]  and there were people that wanted autographs and they were the kind of people that sell the photographs
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.280]  on afterwards you know they'd like you know they for ebay they don't want them for themselves they
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:33.440]  want them to sell on ebay and i just i couldn't be bothered to sign it i just didn't feel like
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:37.600]  doing it you know and that's but that's not the absolute best aspect of me as a person the person
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:44.000]  i aspire to be will always sign everything for everyone you know so like i'm capable in myself
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.480]  of being selfish egocentric and self-obsessed and self-centered but like i think it's more of a
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:56.800]  problem when you have a massive machine of that conducts consciousness and orchestrates the way
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:04.720]  that we think en masse that has a set of priorities and an agenda that is making people in huge numbers
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:13.040]  thinking a selfish insular atomized apathetic and impotent way wow man i tell you you're on fire
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:17.600]  it seems like you have really had an awakening i mean you've been awake for a long time but it
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:24.400]  seems like your awakening is accelerating is that is that accurate to say yeah i think you might be
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:31.440]  right as a matter of fact alex i mean like for me spirituality is an important component i i i
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:38.240]  meditate a lot and i practice certain spiritual principles that mean i have to be very mindful
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:43.600]  one day at a time about the way i live my life i'm like a drug and alcohol free and the more
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:50.160]  that i've detached myself from the things i thought would make me happy like money and fame and other
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:59.040]  people's opinions the more truth is being revealed uh that is pure veritas uh because that's been my
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:04.720]  experience as well and what you were just talking about just being aware that you're being selfish
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:11.440]  or doing things that are self-centered or narcissistic is is half the battle most of the people out
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.160]  there especially that are in the mainstream media they are purely turned over to the narcissism and
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:22.320]  are like biological androids they're not even real and i think that's why you freak uh brazinski's
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:28.400]  daughter out and others so much is because they got into this conscious of the manipulation they
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:34.320]  were involved in but really what you do to others comes back on you so now they've turned into what
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:40.000]  they tried to do to the public making the public one-dimensional cutouts of what they projected
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.720]  it's now blown back on them that's very interesting i wonder how i often wonder alex how those
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:50.080]  situations are contrived i suppose if you work in the media you go through so many filters you know
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:53.920]  you're just not going to get that kind of job unless you're a certain type of person unless you
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:58.320]  know the right sort of people if you say the wrong type of things you'll be filtered out you know so
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:02.960]  by the time you get to the point where you have your own show generally speaking you think a certain
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:08.480]  way that is in alignment with the elitist interest that are behind whatever corporation owns the
[01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:14.800]  outlet yeah but like i think too that there is probably a less obvious way of understanding things
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:20.160]  in terms of i wonder what happens neurologically i wonder what the energy in a brain looks like
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:25.040]  i wonder what that it's like if the our brains are surrounded by other brains that are thinking
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:31.040]  in a certain way they're broadcasting transmitting a certain frequency this is what i feel like we
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:36.640]  have is a sort of a situation where there's such a strong and hypnotic message that exists not
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:41.680]  just externally but more worrying internally i'm always more worried when i find my that's why i
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:46.480]  don't like it when i've transgressed my own personal principles because i think well then i'm not
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:51.760]  behaving in accordance with what i believe in i'm policing myself you know if i'm selfish then

[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:27.440]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:32.640]  russell the establishment is aware of the group consciousness the group collective and they're
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:37.440]  trying to program and as you said on record they've written books about it to lower the frequency
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:43.680]  down to a bestial or even below bestial level beyond common sense even self-preservation
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:50.480]  so that people can be programmable so it comes down to the old question of free will versus
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:55.040]  not free will and i think that's how you can tell the good guys from the bad guys if someone
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.640]  wants to expand consciousness awakening understanding and empower people then that means they're on the
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:07.040]  good side if they want to shutter the horizons and and and put walls around the mind that's the
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:11.760]  bad guys and from what i've heard it's gotten amazing reviews sold out in many places in the
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:17.680]  world messiah complex revolution of consciousness tour you're attempting to show people what different
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:25.360]  perspectives or windows into this describe it for us what do alex you know use as navigational points
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:35.120]  certainly uh personal heroes of mind i talk about um malchemic che gavara dandy and jesus christ and
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:44.560]  how each of those characters represent certain traits certain human facilities that are oppressed
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:50.160]  and have been lost from our cultural narrative like that you can't have figures like gandy
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:54.720]  che gavara malchemic being celebrated in the mainstream because you would then have an
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:59.440]  insurgent population if people start to think like malchemic they're not going to tolerate
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:06.240]  being treated as a complying consumer cattle if people think like che gavara they're going to
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:10.160]  be prepared to take up an arm struggle if they think like gandy they're going to they're not
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:14.320]  going to be seduced by consumerism and they're going to be prepared to protest en masse i also
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:19.120]  point out that all those individuals explored che gavara was a you know famously quite brutal man
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:26.880]  and kind of homophobic and malchemic had a sort of a difficult criminal past and gandy had some
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:31.200]  domestic and personal issues but complex and i point out that all these free people are human
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:36.320]  and therefore flawed but that does not negate the positivity of their message i also say that
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:42.320]  why we have lost to these iphons lost these heroes and indeed seen them appropriated in a
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:48.000]  corporate context the posthumous image of gandy is used to sell apple computers che gavara crops up
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:56.960]  at Mercedes at Mercedes car exhibitions is because we're we're in a situation where our heritage our
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:05.440]  cultural myths and our stories that keep us bonded and unified and to a degree i don't know human
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:10.560]  are being lost and subjugated because as long as human beings are in a state of fear and a state
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:16.640]  of stimulated desire we will always be beholden to the elites we will always be beholden to the
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:21.840]  corporate interests that offer to resolve these problems by selling us products i've got to keep
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:27.200]  it funny alexa i have to talk about sex every two seconds as well while Russell brand is joining
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:33.840]  us right now on the road part of his international tour and you know speaking of getting people
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:41.440]  outside the box from my own researcher absolutely on target at the core here that the establishment
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:51.840]  is expert at hijacking icons or as Campbell wrote art types archetypal images and then twisting them
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:58.480]  towards their aim and then really rewriting all the basic cultural knowledge that every group
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:06.000]  out there had and replacing it basically only with the new world order's propaganda i mean nothing
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:11.360]  against basketball players or movie stars but if that's what kids aspire to be there's not many
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:17.600]  slots there but by making those people the icons artificially and making that the only thing that
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:23.040]  matters then kids will never think about being a revolutionary or never think about a standing
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:28.560]  up non-violently to oppression or never think about the fact that they could change the course
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:33.440]  and be an example to others and so i really get from this that you're trying to almost
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:38.560]  go back and see what the people really stood for and try to get folks to become aware of this power
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:44.960]  yeah yes exactly Alex i look at some corporate slogans like mcdonald's loving it which is kind
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:50.720]  of meaningless and empty and an exploitation of an interesting piece of language to do with love
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:56.240]  i look at uh diet dot the pepper and their slogan unbelievably satisfying and how ridiculous and
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:02.000]  hyperbolic that is even the slogan of gillette razors the best a man can get i can immediately
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:07.920]  point out that this is setting the low very the bar very very low for humankind and for mankind
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:14.240]  the kind of language used and slogans used by Malcolm X by any means necessary Che Guevara it's
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:20.080]  better to die on your feet than to live on your knees and gandy be the change that you want to
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:26.960]  see in the world these messages are subjugated furthermore these heroes i offer replace the gods
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:33.520]  and gods themselves are symbols of certain traits and ideas indigenous faith typically are pagan
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:37.840]  which means they worship the earth and their environment if you have a culture of people like
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:43.680]  the Celts but worship and revere rivers how will you feel when corporations want to pollute your
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:50.320]  rivers if you have an indigenous faith like the Nordics who revere the noble oak tree how will
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:55.840]  you feel about deforestation if you have people like the native people of this country the revere
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:01.840]  and worship the earth and soil how will you feel when people say that fracking is a good idea and
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:07.520]  necessary it means that we've lost our narrative that ties us to our actual reality our authentic
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:13.360]  reality as part of nature not living separate from nature but part of nature they get us a
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:18.080]  narrative where we live in accordance with the interest well so they get us to sell out for
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:24.960]  light beer and blue jeans as they are saying in a recent popular film and then we're not
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:30.800]  satisfied by the light beer and blue jeans folks go to Russell brand dot tv to find out if they
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:36.400]  can still get tickets in their area of the world Russell where else are you going now on the tour
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:43.360]  and and where was your favorite place you visited since you got on the road well I've been all over
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:49.680]  Canada and had a great time there I'm currently in I've been to just come from San Francisco that
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:54.880]  was fantastic and I'm in Seattle now I'm going to Portland then I'm gonna be back in my country for
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:41:02.800]  a few days and then like I'll be in New York and Florida and Austin Texas I mean join all of it
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:06.800]  really I mean you know where it's like when you're touring you don't spend an awful lot of time in
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:13.760]  any one location so but like I really love America and love being with the American people
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:19.760]  and find that broadly speaking American media and American politics is not representative of
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:26.080]  my experience directly with American people sure absolutely it's a fake projected culture that the
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:31.520]  world sees that is not even America it's like New Yorkers still move to Austin or still visit Texas
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:36.640]  and think we ride horses to work and that and we're all the Beverly hillbillies in the 10 minutes
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:41.600]  we've got left Russell I want to go over some of the world events with you that are happening right
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:46.560]  now like Syria but first what do you think's happening in the media revolution because
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:52.400]  mainstream media is dying every metric shows that alternative media the people's media with
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:57.840]  its real diversity is exploding I want to get your take on where you think the future of the
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:03.760]  media is going and cultural developments and do you think that the human species will survive
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.120]  to become a type one civilization and make it off the planet
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:13.280]  type one civilization now of course what does that mean but you get our our own
[01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:17.920]  extraterrestrial operations going and populate other planets well with Alex well what I think
[01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:25.680]  we've heard like the media stuff is that I think that yeah I think the diversity provided by social
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:33.200]  networking and new media is very very positive but like the the status quo are expert at manipulating
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:38.400]  and co-opting any counter cultural movement if you look at how hip hop began as a very sort of
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:45.200]  radical anti-establishment voice and eventually became couldn't be more about consumerism and
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:50.000]  bling and wealth the same thing happened with punk you know so I think any counter cultural
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:56.320]  movement is at risk of being approximated and appropriated by the mainstream and I think we
[01:42:56.320 --> 01:43:01.360]  sort of see already the way that sort of safe social networking is in cahoots with with the
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:06.080]  government and with the whole prism affair that you know like it's going to be very difficult for
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:13.840]  for truly radical new media to survive particularly if it's effective so I feel very optimistic about
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:18.640]  it and the more that people communicate the more that people realize that even if we are different
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:23.520]  from one another we have more in common with each other than we do with the people that rule us
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:29.680]  and govern us then I think that we have a chance of changing the world I think we do I hear buzz
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:34.960]  about Russell brand all over the place mainly in new media why do you think you're getting
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:42.320]  so much more popular I don't know I hope Alex but as a result of moving out of alignment with the
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:47.280]  messages and narratives of mainstream media and being truthful to my sort of you know my original
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:54.560]  intentions when I became a stand-up comedian inspired very much by men like Bill Hicks and

[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:18.800]  broadcasting network network i like to share a revelation that i've had during my time here
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:28.000]  it came to me when i tried to classify your species i realized that you're not actually mammals
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:36.480]  every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:45.280]  environment but you humans do not you move to an area and you multiply multiply until every
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:53.360]  natural resource is consumed the only way you can survive is to spread to another area
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:05.520]  there is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern do you know what it is
[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:16.560]  a virus human beings are a disease a cancer of this planet your plague
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:31.520]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:38.000]  i want to talk about some good news from my perspective nobody's saying Assad's a good guy
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.520]  but the west did start the war did fund the rebel starting two and a half years ago and for the
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:51.200]  first time since 1782 when the british parliament voted to end the war against the colonies they
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:58.320]  voted down uh the prime minister in the uk david cameron wanting to go to war uh obama he has a
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:04.000]  nine percent approval rating on this war in a roiders washington post poll i mean when bush
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:10.800]  did all these lies he had a 72 now it's very unpopular i see this as a sea change or libertarians
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:18.240]  conservatives liberals everybody i know sees through this and knows that it's about the takeover
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:23.920]  of the middle east that wesley clark exposed the seven nations they wanted to target i went through
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:29.120]  the pentagon 10 days after 9 11 and an officer from the joint staff called me into his office and
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:37.840]  said i want you to know he said sir we're gonna attack iraq and i said why he said we don't know
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:42.240]  and then i came back to the pentagon about six weeks later i saw the same officer i said why
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:46.320]  why haven't we attacked iraq we're still gonna attack iraq he said oh sir he says it's worse
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:49.680]  than that because i just got this memo from the secretary of defense's office it says we're gonna
[01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:55.760]  attack and destroy the governments in in seven countries in five years we're gonna start with
[01:50:55.760 --> 01:51:03.440]  iraq and then we're gonna move to syria lebanon libya somalia sudan and iran what is your view
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:10.400]  on syria and uh are you optimistic and excited that uh the uk parliament for the first time in
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:17.120]  200 years did the right thing on war i certainly agree with you that that voted as a result of
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:22.400]  widespread disillusionment with the political process i i think that obviously the middle east
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:29.920]  is one of the most complex issues in uh contemporary world affairs and has been millennia what i
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:35.840]  believe is that our focus has to be on the humanitarian aspects of the displaced refugees
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:42.080]  and the hundreds of thousands that are suffering as a result of uh military conflict in that area
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:49.840]  uh what i also believe alex is that we've got these affairs are conducted behind a veil of
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:55.280]  disingenuity and duplicity it's very difficult for any of us to understand what's truly happening
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:52:00.000]  my experience tells me that you know whatever they are telling me i've been truly intuitively
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:05.120]  don't trust is typically about the interests of big business and government and how they align
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:10.960]  with one another so that's what i'm going to assume until i hear otherwise like you know
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:17.680]  that the claims are going into iraq and afghanistan would you please and so my the starting point i
[01:52:17.680 --> 01:52:25.840]  have is going to be not to trust any um any any advocacy of military action in syria whilst it's
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:30.160]  not an issue i can pretend to fully understand it seems like it's extremely complex but there
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:34.960]  are many factions fighting there there's no clear good even bad in situations absolutely
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:39.440]  boy ron paul recently came out and said he basically thinks it's a false flag there's
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:44.560]  evidence that the al-qaeda groups stage the chemical attack we're not really positive
[01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:50.880]  who uh who set off the gas the group that's most likely to benefit from that is al-qaeda
[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:57.600]  i think it's a false flag i think really indeed it is obviously an incredibly complex situation
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:02.000]  in closing because this happens to me a lot every time i finish an interview after it ends
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:07.040]  there's something or a group of things i wish that i would have said russell brand we really
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:12.640]  appreciate your time in closing in a minute or two any other key points that you'd like to
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:15.520]  put out there to the millions that will end up watching and listening to this
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:20.400]  well i think probably you and me are coming at things from a sort of a different perspective
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:27.440]  but me i see like my views are sort of more informed by sort of socialism even marxism but
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:32.640]  i think ultimately what we believe in is freedom and truth and i think that as long as people
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:38.240]  respect each other's differences then i think and also acknowledge that we the people struggling
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:42.640]  against oppression have more in common with each other than we do than the people that control
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:48.080]  us then i think there's a chance for unity and change sure i mean i think that at a level you
[01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:53.760]  can see as a counter to the centralized corporatist uh communism socialism but then you realize that
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:54:00.240]  they selectively use the deployment of collectivism to only create a permanent peasant class to
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:06.640]  control us so that we never have come to libertarian view of the individual being empowered and having
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:11.680]  a giant middle class i mean what's your view of say libertarianism or ron paul i mean off air you
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:16.720]  said that you were aware of my work what's your what's your view for folks of what i do well i
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:20.720]  think that you're fantastic because uh you're challenging authority and you're challenging
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:26.160]  state it's close so i agree with you but me for me the number one priority for anyone who wants
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:32.080]  social change has to be the welfare of those most in need of it they're the support of society's
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:38.560]  poorest and most vulnerable and for me that's not socialism that it's you know if anything it's
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:43.600]  christian it's spiritual it's uh you know that's why i believe it's the most important issue i think
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:48.000]  if you're in a position of power and your priority is not helping the poor and the dispossessed
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:53.040]  then you shouldn't be in power you know and now of course a healthy society across the board
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:55:00.240]  uh you know and hierarchies are always going to be to a degree necessary but for me on a
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:04.560]  decent human level i feel our obligation is to help those that are suffering sure you've got a
[01:55:04.560 --> 01:55:11.280]  giant twitter account uh what is it rusty rockets uh uh is there any other places on the web people
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:18.880]  should should visit other than that uh and your tv site no that's what called for me mate i'll
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:23.040]  i already follow you and stuff but let's keep this dialogue going and i i hope i see you in austin you
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:26.560]  bet and i said that was the final question one more and i'll let you get on down the rugs and
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:31.920]  you're at the airport one last question i've got to ask you here rustle you you mentioned jesus and
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:38.800]  shea guvara and uh gondi and malcom x but it says and hitler and that's one reason i want to see
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:43.600]  your show this is such an icon that's used everywhere but in your research you got to give
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:51.040]  away a little bit what's the angle on hare hitler well that whilst hitler's actions were deplorable
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:57.520]  it's not his extremism that is terrifying it's his mundanity he was just a normal man created by
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:05.120]  a number of geopolitical economic and religious circumstance their size time in germany yeah
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:10.320]  of course Versailles and the and the anti-semitism anti-semitism that was very prominent in that
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:17.440]  part of europe at that time and that but now we don't like in those days it was clear what evil was
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:23.920]  our evil is adult hitler now evil comes dressed as the in the white of ronald mcdonald now evil
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:29.920]  is hidden behind the apple logo now evil is indecipherable in derivative bundles and in
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:35.920]  dispossessed millions so again it's about the narrative in a way we're told stories exactly it
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:41.760]  knows how to hide and deciphering it and knowing what evil is yeah is is really the answer russell
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:45.600]  brand thank you so much and i look forward to hopefully meeting you when you're in austin a
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:52.960]  few weeks i'll be at your show regardless thank you sir goodbye see you mate thanks well folks
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:58.400]  there goes russell brand and i had been told by david ike that he was a listener and we got a hold
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:02.800]  up and discovered he was and we found he was following us on twitter at real alec shones and
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:07.120]  got him on and i've been fascinated with his work for a few years he's been around for a long time
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:12.480]  but he certainly has gone from just kind of being the wild party animal guy uh to being a
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:16.960]  serious thinker you can tell he's a smart guy and look folks you know i don't like communism
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:21.440]  but he's on a journey here he said that was a long time ago now his views are changing
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:27.360]  we have to reach out to everybody especially if they're outside the box and want to try to make
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:33.760]  connections to others and so this is how those of us that want true thomas jefferson style liberty
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:37.600]  are going to win the fight against the tyrants but i tell you that interview couldn't have gone
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:44.800]  better that was amazing and so i know that listeners out there probably want to send me their comments
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:50.960]  you can do that at real alec shones on twitter and then later on in the broadcast i will come back
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:55.840]  and read over some of those we'll also open the phones up later and get your take on that amazing
[01:57:55.840 --> 01:58:01.840]  uh groundbreaking uh interview with russell brand and i hope this one gets eight and a half million
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:06.960]  views or whatever like his msnbc because this will really get people thinking and talking if him
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:13.360]  just shaken up those uh those cut out paper people uh went so viral and spurred people's
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:17.840]  humanity this will really get people talking so please folks send this out when it's posted on
