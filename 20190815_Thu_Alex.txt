[00:00.000 --> 00:14.480]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[00:14.480 --> 00:22.920]  front lines of the Info War.
[00:22.920 --> 00:26.280]  It is Thursday, August 15th, 2019.
[00:26.280 --> 00:30.920]  I am Alex Jones, your host, coming to you for the last day from San Diego, I'll be back
[00:30.920 --> 00:36.680]  in studio for the willing tomorrow when Shroyer was scheduled to be hosting the full four
[00:36.680 --> 00:41.560]  hours today, but I am going to be co-hosting some of them because wild horses could not
[00:41.560 --> 00:44.040]  drag me away.
[00:44.040 --> 00:45.040]  It's now conclusive.
[00:45.040 --> 00:52.240]  In fact, I even forgot to give the broadcast crew a name of this show today when we post
[00:52.240 --> 00:53.240]  it.
[00:53.240 --> 00:54.240]  Well, here it is.
[00:54.240 --> 00:55.240]  It's official.
[00:55.240 --> 00:57.160]  Jeffrey Epstein was murdered.
[00:57.160 --> 00:59.160]  The evidence is incontrovertible.
[00:59.160 --> 01:03.080]  There isn't a jury in the world with all this evidence that wouldn't say he was murdered
[01:03.080 --> 01:06.120]  and there is an ongoing cover-up that is unraveling.
[01:06.120 --> 01:13.920]  So Jeffrey Epstein was murdered and the cover-up is unraveling.
[01:13.920 --> 01:18.400]  That's the headline, Shaking the World.
[01:18.400 --> 01:20.400]  It's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[01:20.400 --> 01:24.680]  The autopsy says his neck was broken in two places.
[01:24.680 --> 01:29.080]  We're going to lay all that out coming up and why it's so significant at the start of
[01:29.080 --> 01:30.600]  the next segment.
[01:30.600 --> 01:36.040]  Then we have that big, huge Google whistleblower that's a hero because he didn't just leak
[01:36.040 --> 01:41.000]  the info of the criminal's activity going on.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.760]  The election meddling, the election fixing, he went public himself.
[01:44.760 --> 01:48.600]  He will be joining us coming up in the third segment in about 15 minutes.
[01:48.600 --> 01:55.440]  Jack Voorhees will be joining us, he's releasing more information today.
[01:55.440 --> 01:57.080]  He's already done it on his Twitter.
[01:57.080 --> 02:00.680]  You'll want to hear this major whistleblowing information.
[02:00.680 --> 02:05.040]  In fact, we're already linked on DrudgeReport.com, but in case Drudge isn't listening, we probably
[02:05.040 --> 02:09.280]  want to send an email over pointing out that we're going to have the Google whistleblower
[02:09.280 --> 02:10.600]  live on air.
[02:10.600 --> 02:12.360]  This will be a first.
[02:12.360 --> 02:15.640]  But Project Veritas did was amazing and the interview is powerful.
[02:15.640 --> 02:16.640]  It's stunning.
[02:16.640 --> 02:20.640]  But he's going to be live with us for three segments.
[02:20.640 --> 02:26.680]  That's about 30 minutes of airtime coming up and I'm just going to give him the floor
[02:26.680 --> 02:30.920]  to tell it all, to tell what else he's going to be bringing out, the other shoes to drop.
[02:30.920 --> 02:35.000]  Now, here's the even bigger news that's coming up after that.
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.960]  Tens of thousands of Chinese troops mash at sports stadiums right across the border from
[02:40.960 --> 02:44.520]  Hong Kong and the bridge and openly say they're getting ready to fully invade.
[02:44.520 --> 02:46.880]  They've already used paramilitary troops.
[02:46.880 --> 02:51.320]  Now, let's hit this right now first, though.
[02:51.320 --> 02:56.000]  Six officers delivering a felony drug warrant in Philadelphia in what's basically a no-go
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.280]  zone, get pinned down, six get shot.
[03:00.280 --> 03:05.000]  The local news basically celebrates it.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.620]  Thousands of people show up on the streets instead of throwing water balloons or pictures
[03:08.620 --> 03:11.480]  of water at the police, they begin to throw bottles at them.
[03:11.480 --> 03:17.360]  We're going to roll some of that video and tell them, we'll call them all sorts of horrible
[03:17.360 --> 03:19.280]  violent names.
[03:19.280 --> 03:24.240]  This is what Netflix and Hollywood is pushing, all cops are evil, all cops are racist, all
[03:24.240 --> 03:29.440]  these cops are black and they have black folks wound up by the media to believe that their
[03:29.440 --> 03:34.120]  enemy is the police when nine out of 10 blacks are killed by other black folks, not by white
[03:34.120 --> 03:37.720]  folks, not by Hispanics, not by police.
[03:37.720 --> 03:42.600]  And now these areas like Chicago, South Side and areas of Philly will be even bigger no-go
[03:42.600 --> 03:45.800]  zones for police and crime rates will only go up.
[03:45.800 --> 03:50.800]  But here are the police already six down and on their flank, here comes folks brainwashed
[03:50.800 --> 03:53.000]  by the media to attack the police.
[03:53.000 --> 03:54.120]  This is the race baiting.
[03:54.120 --> 03:55.120]  This is Hollywood.
[03:55.120 --> 03:56.120]  Here is the awful footage.
[03:56.120 --> 04:09.040]  Come back over here.
[04:39.040 --> 04:58.840]  They shouted at the police, we're going to kill you, die, they call black police the
[04:58.840 --> 04:59.840]  n-word.
[04:59.840 --> 05:00.840]  This is the breakdown of civilization.
[05:00.840 --> 05:02.520]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[05:02.520 --> 05:06.040]  A Big Tech or Big Babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because
[05:06.040 --> 05:10.480]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities
[05:10.480 --> 05:11.480]  over two decades.
[05:11.480 --> 05:14.880]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[05:14.880 --> 05:18.160]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[05:18.160 --> 05:22.440]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[05:22.440 --> 05:25.520]  to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change and they will become the
[05:25.520 --> 05:29.560]  Big Tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century, who ran American
[05:29.560 --> 05:33.840]  politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after
[05:33.840 --> 05:34.840]  the Great Depression.
[05:34.840 --> 05:39.840]  The court's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make
[05:39.840 --> 05:44.600]  real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent
[05:44.600 --> 05:45.600]  free press.
[05:45.600 --> 05:50.000]  Real collusion is Big Tech and Big Media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[05:50.000 --> 05:52.000]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.960]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[05:54.960 --> 05:56.760]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[05:56.760 --> 05:58.720]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[05:58.720 --> 06:14.880]  And it is what we just saw.
[06:14.880 --> 06:25.160]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:25.160 --> 06:28.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, world history is unfolding right now.
[06:28.640 --> 06:33.360]  This is a great time of awakening, this is a great time of what has been hidden coming
[06:33.360 --> 06:34.360]  to light.
[06:34.360 --> 06:39.240]  It's also an incredible crossroads where we see major military proxy wars from the US
[06:39.240 --> 06:44.080]  and China, breaking out in Hong Kong, breaking out in Kashmir.
[06:44.080 --> 06:49.600]  We see Islamic attacks exploding across Europe of every type, hundreds of churches being
[06:49.600 --> 06:52.520]  burned a year, many, many a week.
[06:52.520 --> 06:59.200]  In Europe alone, this is just a quickening time, an acceleration that we're living in.
[06:59.200 --> 07:06.080]  We have a huge Google whistleblower that first was broke yesterday with Project Veritas.
[07:06.080 --> 07:12.840]  Zach Voorhees will be joining us live uncensored and unfiltered the first time a major Google
[07:12.840 --> 07:19.080]  engineer with access to all these manuals and training systems of how to suppress nationalist
[07:19.080 --> 07:23.920]  and conservatives and Christians and veterans and gun owners is going to be live on a show
[07:23.920 --> 07:24.920]  or three segments.
[07:24.920 --> 07:30.360]  But let's get into the big story right now that ties into all of it.
[07:30.360 --> 07:39.240]  The loss of confidence in the system, no one buying the pedophile pimp, the pedophile
[07:39.240 --> 07:45.120]  procurer, the blackmail intelligence operative Jeffrey Epstein, no one believing that he
[07:45.120 --> 07:47.840]  committed suicide.
[07:47.840 --> 07:55.240]  I had breakfast this morning with my head security guy who's been to the Army, the Marines,
[07:55.240 --> 08:02.360]  Blackwater, done CIA contracting, been an Austin police officer in his history, been
[08:02.360 --> 08:05.040]  a federal air marshal, you name it.
[08:05.040 --> 08:09.240]  He's talked to all of his federal associates and, I mean, everyone he knows, and these
[08:09.240 --> 08:14.560]  guys aren't, quote, conspiracy theorists, and they say 100% killed in the cell.
[08:14.560 --> 08:19.400]  But I sat there at breakfast for 30 minutes while he recited all of this and I said, you've
[08:19.400 --> 08:25.800]  got to start doing a radio show, Tim, because he's just totally dead pan like dragnet.
[08:25.800 --> 08:30.840]  And he was just laying it all out and I'd forgotten half of this stuff.
[08:30.840 --> 08:37.680]  There's a story up on DrudgeReport.com from the Gateway pundit that says list of inconsistencies.
[08:37.680 --> 08:42.040]  I'd say list of smoking guns, but we're going to go over these, but let's just walk through
[08:42.040 --> 08:44.720]  the big ones, shall we?
[08:44.720 --> 08:49.080]  He gets this sweetheart deal a decade ago and he was already procuring conservatively
[08:49.080 --> 08:54.160]  thousands of underage girls, the black male people, taking them on to this island where
[08:54.160 --> 09:00.160]  far worse things happen, other facilities in New York, other facilities in Florida.
[09:00.160 --> 09:07.520]  When it all starts to come out, the fed swoop in, bust him again, charge him with more sex
[09:07.520 --> 09:13.560]  trafficking, which ties into the Clintons and the open borders and Obama and Haiti.
[09:13.560 --> 09:18.360]  I mean, they are up to their necks and eyeballs in this.
[09:18.360 --> 09:19.680]  He goes into jail.
[09:19.680 --> 09:30.720]  They put a huge giant bodybuilder cop who is in there for killing four drug dealers we
[09:30.720 --> 09:35.440]  know of taking their money and burying them in his backyard.
[09:35.440 --> 09:39.360]  His specialty was shooting him and also choking him to death.
[09:39.360 --> 09:43.080]  They put him in there with this nonviolent offender.
[09:43.080 --> 09:44.080]  You never do that.
[09:44.080 --> 09:48.080]  And of course, I already knew that from researching it, but Tim was explaining to me this morning.
[09:48.080 --> 09:54.720]  You never put them in with a violent offender like that before they're transferred and convicted
[09:54.720 --> 09:57.120]  or sent to prison.
[09:57.120 --> 10:00.800]  This guy tries to break his neck, but good jail guards that weren't on the take got in
[10:00.800 --> 10:05.160]  and stopped him, found him in a catatonic position.
[10:05.160 --> 10:10.680]  He tells his lawyer who's in the news, no, he tried to kill me.
[10:10.680 --> 10:14.280]  Then they put him on suicide watch.
[10:14.280 --> 10:18.400]  They pull him off suicide watch, put him in a cell by himself.
[10:18.400 --> 10:20.320]  All this unfolds.
[10:20.320 --> 10:23.080]  They pull the regular guards off.
[10:23.080 --> 10:27.200]  The big finale coming in a moment is broken neck.
[10:27.200 --> 10:30.040]  And it just goes on and on from there.
[10:30.040 --> 10:31.280]  The lights are off.
[10:31.280 --> 10:32.520]  The cameras are off.
[10:32.520 --> 10:35.880]  They tell the regular jail guards go home early.
[10:35.880 --> 10:42.480]  Other jail guards, not just one, but now they're saying a special crew is brought in.
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.880]  And then the jail guards that are there and other floors say they all fell asleep.
[10:46.880 --> 10:48.720]  So they can't say anything.
[10:48.720 --> 10:52.400]  Then the other witnesses that the feds have already talked to, as AG Barr took over the
[10:52.400 --> 10:57.920]  day it happened, he said, clearly a cover up, appointed a special prosecutor, fired the
[10:57.920 --> 11:03.760]  warden, I mean, removed the warden, took the jail guards that found him off, put them on
[11:03.760 --> 11:06.760]  administrative leave.
[11:06.760 --> 11:08.320]  They talked to all the cells around.
[11:08.320 --> 11:14.120]  They said, we heard the door open him screaming and yelling, basically fighting for his life.
[11:14.120 --> 11:19.120]  They instantly start saying, breathe, breathe, breathe, the cover up, the screaming.
[11:19.120 --> 11:20.120]  So that's their cover story.
[11:20.120 --> 11:25.240]  Well, you're not screaming while you're leaning down on the so-called blanket to choke yourself.
[11:25.240 --> 11:26.960]  It's not breaking your neck.
[11:26.960 --> 11:31.920]  It's being violently grabbed and you're fighting back or you dropped from a distance and it
[11:31.920 --> 11:32.920]  can break a vertebra.
[11:32.920 --> 11:35.200]  No, broken in two places.
[11:35.200 --> 11:39.200]  So they went in there, two things happened, either the guards that went in, went in and
[11:39.200 --> 11:46.080]  brutally manhandled him or someone else got in, pulled out and then the guards came in.
[11:46.080 --> 11:53.000]  But everyone heard the yelling, everyone heard the screaming, the wailing as he fought.
[11:53.000 --> 11:59.120]  And then all breathe, breathe, I've seen it's all right, buddy, breathe as they're killing
[11:59.120 --> 12:01.000]  him.
[12:01.000 --> 12:02.840]  Now again, we have the screams.
[12:02.840 --> 12:05.600]  We have all the normal protections, the defaults turned off.
[12:05.600 --> 12:13.840]  We have him parked with a killer who has dead bodies in his yard, a huge gorilla, a huge
[12:13.840 --> 12:17.480]  guy, a cop.
[12:17.480 --> 12:21.920]  And so all of this goes on and on and you have his lawyer and others saying, no, he
[12:21.920 --> 12:24.080]  said they're going to kill me in here.
[12:24.080 --> 12:25.200]  That guy attacked me.
[12:25.200 --> 12:26.840]  I'm not going to commit suicide.
[12:26.840 --> 12:28.440]  Then he was up me.
[12:28.440 --> 12:30.320]  He was hearing that he had a deal.
[12:30.320 --> 12:32.040]  He was going to be getting out.
[12:32.040 --> 12:33.760]  He was going to turn to the justice department.
[12:33.760 --> 12:39.400]  He was going to go ahead and destroy the Clintons and man, the money flowed, the special and
[12:39.400 --> 12:43.320]  they're like, hey, we can't get the regular guards to do it.
[12:43.320 --> 12:45.960]  And so they turn off all the default protections.
[12:45.960 --> 12:51.440]  They bring in the special guys or somebody else went in, there was wailing and screaming.
[12:51.440 --> 12:53.160]  They were able to get out of the jail.
[12:53.160 --> 12:54.160]  Everybody was asleep.
[12:54.160 --> 12:57.320]  The lights were off and then other and then the guards found him.
[12:57.320 --> 13:00.480]  That's the only way where the door opens.
[13:00.480 --> 13:01.480]  No.
[13:01.480 --> 13:03.640]  I don't want to scream in the hotel.
[13:03.640 --> 13:05.800]  They'll send security here.
[13:05.800 --> 13:11.680]  People come to screams and then breathe Alex, breathe or breathe Epstein.
[13:11.680 --> 13:14.680]  This is completely beyond Hollywood.
[13:14.680 --> 13:15.940]  The wheels have come off.
[13:15.940 --> 13:19.300]  The deep state isn't as slick as it used to be because it's not in full control.
[13:19.300 --> 13:24.960]  This was a total kamikaze suicide mission sent in there by people.
[13:24.960 --> 13:31.040]  I guarantee you, they already had massive dirt on, but they already had control of and Epstein
[13:31.040 --> 13:32.480]  was told, oh, you're getting out, buddy.
[13:32.480 --> 13:34.880]  But yeah, he was getting out feet first.
[13:34.880 --> 13:40.000]  That's why I told people this earlier this week, I said, listen, dead men tell no tales.
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.840]  And I said, they want to send the message to everybody else.
[13:41.840 --> 13:43.600]  I believe he's dead.
[13:43.600 --> 13:47.880]  All this stuff about, oh, look, this photo looks the same as him standing up as it looks
[13:47.880 --> 13:48.880]  at him on the stretcher.
[13:48.880 --> 13:51.440]  Yeah, it's the same guy.
[13:51.440 --> 13:53.240]  It's his face.
[13:53.240 --> 13:56.680]  Jeffrey Epstein is as dead as a doornail.
[13:56.680 --> 14:01.240]  He's as dead as pirate ships from 500 years ago at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.
[14:01.240 --> 14:05.600]  He's as distinct as Tyrannosaurus Rex and the Easter Bunny.
[14:05.600 --> 14:06.600]  Okay.
[14:06.600 --> 14:08.320]  I know the Easter Bunny in real folks' joke.
[14:08.320 --> 14:09.320]  He's gone.
[14:09.320 --> 14:10.920]  He's dead and gone.
[14:10.920 --> 14:15.600]  And here's the thing though, all the other witnesses now are going to understand.
[14:15.600 --> 14:17.840]  You start trying to plea bargain with Trump.
[14:17.840 --> 14:21.200]  We've got people in the Justice Department, and we've got people in every federal jail
[14:21.200 --> 14:26.760]  and prison, and we'll kill you in front of everybody, and the whole corporate media will
[14:26.760 --> 14:30.200]  go along with us and help cover that up.
[14:30.200 --> 14:37.520]  But you go to drudgereport.com, Gateway Pundit, and you read the list of inconsistencies.
[14:37.520 --> 14:38.520]  I read this this morning.
[14:38.520 --> 14:40.720]  I can think of some that they don't even have listed.
[14:40.720 --> 14:43.320]  By the way, they've done a better list than I did.
[14:43.320 --> 14:49.400]  So I'm saying the inconsistencies are so monumental, are so massive that I can't even
[14:49.400 --> 14:51.600]  go over all of them.
[14:51.600 --> 14:56.160]  But coming up second hour, we're going to go through all of these.
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.520]  We've also posted a link to this on infowars.com and newswars.com, but remember, one of the
[15:00.520 --> 15:05.520]  main reasons they took me off air last year, took us off all the platforms, was because
[15:05.520 --> 15:10.320]  they said I was saying the Clintons were involved in sex rings to black male people, and they
[15:10.320 --> 15:14.840]  diverted off on that pizza place, which the media made a big deal on that we did go focus
[15:14.840 --> 15:15.840]  on.
[15:15.840 --> 15:16.840]  We took the bait.
[15:16.840 --> 15:21.200]  But they, like a mockingbird, like its wings broke, and when you get close to its nest,
[15:21.200 --> 15:23.160]  you go over to it instead of the nest.
[15:23.160 --> 15:24.840]  But it was spirit cooking.
[15:24.840 --> 15:30.680]  It was the, all of the Alistair Crowley stuff with the Clintons, with John Podesta, with
[15:30.680 --> 15:37.160]  Tony Podesta, with the whole UN, the whole history, it is incredible how out of control
[15:37.160 --> 15:38.160]  all the system.
[15:38.160 --> 15:41.040]  When we come back, we've got the big whistleblower on with us.
[15:41.040 --> 15:43.360]  Please remember, we're Alistair Supported, and we want to thank all the Alistair's for
[15:43.360 --> 15:44.360]  your financial support.
[15:44.360 --> 15:47.920]  You get high quality, fluoride-free toothpaste that we're blue, get the great grill oil that's
[15:47.920 --> 15:52.000]  back in stock, get the great and new tropic herbophores, the great quick America coffee,
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.920]  and so much more at infowarsstore.com.
[15:53.920 --> 16:23.760]  Thank you.
[16:23.760 --> 16:53.560]  We'll see you in the next one.
[16:53.560 --> 17:19.960]  We'll see you in the next one.
[17:19.960 --> 17:46.080]  We'll see you in the next one.
[17:46.080 --> 18:01.520]  We'll see you in the next one.
[18:01.520 --> 18:27.880]  We'll see you in the next one.
[18:27.880 --> 18:57.800]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[18:57.800 --> 19:24.200]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[19:24.200 --> 19:50.600]  We'll see you in the next one.
[19:50.600 --> 20:06.640]  We'll see you in the next one.
[20:20.600 --> 20:29.920]  Now, Zach Voorhees is about to be interviewed by Owen Schreuer, because Owen has had time
[20:29.920 --> 20:34.760]  to go over these documents, go over the project veritas reports, and so he'll be conducting
[20:34.760 --> 20:35.760]  the main interview.
[20:35.760 --> 20:40.200]  I'll have a few more questions at the end, but this is a major Google engineer who's
[20:40.200 --> 20:43.520]  going public, unlike others that have just leaked.
[20:43.520 --> 20:44.520]  He is a hero.
[20:44.520 --> 20:45.800]  This is the first time I know of.
[20:45.800 --> 20:50.560]  We've got a Google engineer on live, so he'll be with us for the next 40 minutes or so.
[20:50.560 --> 20:56.120]  Until the end of the hour, and so from our main studios, Owen Schreuer takes over the
[20:56.120 --> 20:57.120]  interview.
[20:57.120 --> 20:58.120]  Owen.
[20:58.120 --> 21:01.760]  Well, Zach, thank you for joining us today.
[21:01.760 --> 21:05.800]  These are incredible times, incredible history that we're living, and I know that that is
[21:05.800 --> 21:09.400]  what led you to release these documents.
[21:09.400 --> 21:14.000]  But before we get into that, I want to do a brief history in your time at Google.
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.240]  You've been at Google for six years, correct?
[21:17.240 --> 21:18.760]  Actually, eight.
[21:18.760 --> 21:19.920]  Eight years.
[21:19.920 --> 21:25.080]  And when you started at Google, what was your position and where did you finish?
[21:25.080 --> 21:31.400]  So I started as a junior engineer, and then I got promoted twice, and when I left Google,
[21:31.400 --> 21:34.040]  I was a senior software engineer.
[21:34.040 --> 21:42.440]  So this allowed you special access to the algorithms and the codes that Google was using
[21:42.440 --> 21:46.920]  for their search engine optimization and that they would also use on some of their sub-platforms
[21:46.920 --> 21:48.560]  like YouTube, correct?
[21:48.560 --> 21:49.560]  Yeah.
[21:49.560 --> 21:54.080]  A common question people ask me is, what kind of special access did I have?
[21:54.080 --> 21:57.920]  And one of the things I just want to state for the record is that these were documents
[21:57.920 --> 22:06.120]  that were available to any full-time employee on the internal public internet.
[22:06.120 --> 22:11.160]  So they made these documents available for anyone to see, but then when you released
[22:11.160 --> 22:14.840]  them, they panicked and they called the police on you, correct?
[22:14.840 --> 22:16.000]  Yeah.
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.280]  So Google has been scrubbing the inside of their corporate internet.
[22:21.280 --> 22:27.240]  I started to become aware of these documents in 2017, and I just started grabbing them
[22:27.240 --> 22:32.640]  and then finding keywords, and that led me to other documents that I was then able to
[22:32.640 --> 22:33.640]  grab.
[22:33.640 --> 22:37.680]  And so I just started collecting this treasure trove of documents that was showing clear
[22:37.680 --> 22:43.680]  intention to unduly influence the election and other nefarious things.
[22:43.680 --> 22:48.840]  Now, you said you started collecting these documents in 2017.
[22:48.840 --> 22:54.440]  When do you think this sort of pattern of behavior at Google of manipulating search
[22:54.440 --> 23:00.440]  results for a political agenda, when do you think that started?
[23:00.440 --> 23:05.560]  It started in 2016, right after Donald Trump got elected.
[23:05.560 --> 23:11.160]  The company did a full 180 and started to communicate their intentions to sort of break
[23:11.160 --> 23:16.520]  away from their mission statements to the employees of the company.
[23:16.520 --> 23:22.960]  Now how clear were they with you and the rest of their employees that from now on Google
[23:22.960 --> 23:28.000]  was basically operating as a political wing that was favoring one side of the aisle.
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.240]  In this case, it would be the Democrat Party, but it could be anybody.
[23:32.240 --> 23:36.080]  When did they decide that this was going to be their mission and did they make that clear
[23:36.080 --> 23:37.320]  to their employees?
[23:37.320 --> 23:42.160]  Well, you know, there's a misconception that Google is trying to just censor the right.
[23:42.160 --> 23:44.680]  They're trying to censor the left.
[23:44.680 --> 23:53.480]  Today I just made a post to Tolly Gabbard's attorney describing that I know how people
[23:53.480 --> 23:58.520]  can take down accounts because I saw them take down Jordan B. Peterson's account.
[23:58.520 --> 24:04.200]  And the information for that is still located inside of Google's internal bug database on
[24:04.200 --> 24:08.240]  Jordan B. Peterson.
[24:08.240 --> 24:13.440]  So you put out an open letter to Tolly Gabbard's attorney saying, you know what it looks like
[24:13.440 --> 24:14.440]  to be taken down.
[24:14.440 --> 24:19.000]  Tolly Gabbard sued Google for, I believe, $57 million for the interference they ran
[24:19.000 --> 24:25.320]  during her ad campaign on Google during the presidential debates.
[24:25.320 --> 24:30.760]  What kind of information can she look at or get access to to prove that Google actively
[24:30.760 --> 24:34.480]  made sure to keep her down during the presidential debate?
[24:34.480 --> 24:36.240]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[24:36.240 --> 24:40.960]  So you know, the challenge for these attorneys is that they don't have like knowledge of
[24:40.960 --> 24:42.840]  how Google's internal system works.
[24:42.840 --> 24:46.080]  And so that discovery process can be really challenging.
[24:46.080 --> 24:52.720]  And so what I did is I used my knowledge on how they took down Jordan B. Peterson to give
[24:52.720 --> 24:55.720]  them instructions on how to discovery.
[24:55.720 --> 25:02.520]  So they'll be able to see, you know, that bug and I described to them how how these
[25:02.520 --> 25:07.200]  malicious third party actors were able to exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities
[25:07.200 --> 25:16.520]  to Google in order to trigger their A.I. to take down their Jordan's email address.
[25:16.520 --> 25:20.720]  In this sense, I'm kind of testifying as an expert witness inside the system.
[25:20.720 --> 25:24.080]  And if you'd like, I would I would love to tell you how they were able to take down Jordan
[25:24.080 --> 25:25.240]  B. Peterson.
[25:25.240 --> 25:29.500]  In fact, let's actually go specifically with the Jordan B. Peterson example.
[25:29.500 --> 25:34.840]  Talk about exactly what they do inside internally with the engineers and the softwares and the
[25:34.840 --> 25:39.280]  algorithms to remove somebody like Jordan Peterson.
[25:39.280 --> 25:45.560]  So what happens is that there is a there's a group of people and what they do is that
[25:45.560 --> 25:47.280]  they get the target's address.
[25:47.280 --> 25:51.920]  So I'm not going to say Jordan Peterson's email address on on air, but let's just say
[25:51.920 --> 26:00.040]  that the the his email address is X, Y, Z. And so this third party will go and change
[26:00.040 --> 26:01.040]  one of the letters.
[26:01.040 --> 26:02.040]  Right.
[26:02.040 --> 26:06.000]  So instead of X, Y, Z will be X, Y, Y at gmail.com.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.400]  And they repeat this process and they create this network of spam accounts that then push
[26:10.400 --> 26:14.680]  out spam to other users.
[26:14.680 --> 26:21.560]  And this triggers the A.I. system to flag the spam accounts and bring them down.
[26:21.560 --> 26:25.400]  But surprisingly, it also brings down the original person's accounts.
[26:25.400 --> 26:29.040]  And so the original person, they go dark, their accounts go down.
[26:29.040 --> 26:33.480]  Google tells them that the accounts down for suspicious activity.
[26:33.480 --> 26:39.760]  And then they have no way of having any recourse because Google's not going to share their
[26:39.760 --> 26:40.760]  information.
[26:40.760 --> 26:44.040]  They're not going to share like what's going on and they're they're hiding it.
[26:44.040 --> 26:47.720]  And so people on the inside, we can see this kind of stuff.
[26:47.720 --> 26:52.280]  And and so and so this is how they're doing it.
[26:52.280 --> 26:55.160]  And I've never seen Google really address this problem.
[26:55.160 --> 26:58.600]  The exploit, as far as I know, still exists.
[26:58.600 --> 27:01.440]  And it's something that needs to be investigated.
[27:01.440 --> 27:05.880]  In fact, I think that Google is actually purposely leaving this vulnerability open just so that
[27:05.880 --> 27:11.880]  they can claim plausible deniability and say, well, it wasn't us.
[27:11.880 --> 27:15.480]  And they're technically not taking down these malicious third parties that are taking it
[27:15.480 --> 27:16.980]  down.
[27:16.980 --> 27:22.760]  So it sounds to me whether or not you could you could say Google is involved or not.
[27:22.760 --> 27:23.760]  It sounds me.
[27:23.760 --> 27:27.520]  People are doing an end around of censorship, loading up the network with a bunch of false
[27:27.520 --> 27:29.680]  accounts in this example, Jordan B Peterson.
[27:29.680 --> 27:34.120]  So you've got Jordan B Peterson, but then Jordan B Peter Sons, Jordan B Peter Zens, Jordan
[27:34.120 --> 27:35.520]  B Peter Zens.
[27:35.520 --> 27:40.400]  And then it just bogs it all down and it turns all of it into spam, including the real Jordan
[27:40.400 --> 27:41.400]  B Peterson.
[27:41.400 --> 27:44.600]  But but you're saying this is mostly done by third parties.
[27:44.600 --> 27:47.200]  But you think maybe Google turns a blind eye.
[27:47.200 --> 27:48.880]  Yes, that's exactly what's happening.
[27:48.880 --> 27:52.680]  Google is turning a blind eye and allowing these malicious third party hackers to hack
[27:52.680 --> 27:53.880]  the system.
[27:53.880 --> 27:56.800]  And so, you know, it started with, you know, Jordan B Peterson.
[27:56.800 --> 28:01.760]  And now what we're seeing is, you know, it's evolved into, you know, election interference.
[28:01.760 --> 28:03.480]  Tulsi Gabbard has an ad account.
[28:03.480 --> 28:10.520]  And after she did the first democratic debate, everybody, you know, swarmed to Google search
[28:10.520 --> 28:13.160]  to try to find information on Tulsi Gabbard.
[28:13.160 --> 28:17.320]  Well, Tulsi Gabbard's ad account went down and it went down the same way that Jordan
[28:17.320 --> 28:21.240]  B Peterson's account was going down, you know, for suspicious activity.
[28:21.240 --> 28:28.000]  So during the surge, she's not able to utilize all the keywords that she's purchased.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.720]  And so her opponents can can still buy her keywords.
[28:31.720 --> 28:36.400]  And as a result, users traffic is redirected towards establishment.
[28:36.400 --> 28:39.160]  So let's let's focus on that on the other side.
[28:39.160 --> 28:43.080]  And let's highlight how this is something that's so important because during the presidential
[28:43.080 --> 28:47.360]  debates is when most of the traffic is on Google for people searching for information.
[28:47.360 --> 28:51.040]  So they go on there, they search Tulsi Gabbard, they don't find anything.
[28:51.040 --> 28:55.120]  That's because Tulsi Gabbard has been removed by Google, it's been marked as spam.
[28:55.120 --> 28:58.560]  We've got the whistleblower on with a sack, Voorhees will get into it on the other side
[28:58.560 --> 28:59.560]  of this break.
[28:59.560 --> 29:03.920]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[29:03.920 --> 29:05.840]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[29:05.840 --> 29:07.560]  I had a problem like you once.
[29:07.560 --> 29:12.960]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[29:12.960 --> 29:14.080]  my life.
[29:14.080 --> 29:19.320]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[29:19.320 --> 29:24.520]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,

[30:59.880 --> 31:05.880]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[31:05.880 --> 31:10.280]  in the future, it would be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality,
[31:10.280 --> 31:13.160]  who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[31:13.160 --> 31:17.880]  And today, the Communist Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago.
[31:17.880 --> 31:22.400]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president and what he's
[31:22.400 --> 31:26.720]  doing in this trade war once China put pressure on our farmers.
[31:26.720 --> 31:27.720]  That's beautiful.

[31:52.240 --> 32:00.240]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[32:00.240 --> 32:05.120]  George Arwell said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary
[32:05.120 --> 32:06.120]  act.
[32:06.120 --> 32:10.080]  And so used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag because we still loved
[32:10.080 --> 32:13.360]  our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it.
[32:13.360 --> 32:16.320]  But now they're trying to take it out of schools.
[32:16.320 --> 32:18.680]  They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[32:18.680 --> 32:22.280]  Two white leftists that won a virtue signal are pulling down American flags and running
[32:22.280 --> 32:24.080]  up Mexican flags.
[32:24.080 --> 32:26.920]  This is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing.
[32:26.920 --> 32:31.480]  So now it is a revolutionary act in a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying
[32:31.480 --> 32:37.120]  to wear the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag and particularly
[32:37.120 --> 32:43.000]  when it says on the back, right there, ladies and gentlemen, americasbackinfowarstore.com.
[32:43.000 --> 32:47.440]  So whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies
[32:47.440 --> 32:51.720]  face all over, not just the U.S., but worldwide because more than ever, the American flag
[32:51.720 --> 33:20.680]  is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[16:40.580 --> 33:33.080]  in San Francisco.
[33:33.080 --> 33:38.280]  I'm about to turn it back over to them and then I'll be back live with Owen in the next
[33:38.280 --> 33:39.280]  hour.
[33:39.280 --> 33:43.880]  But you have to understand he's talking from his perspective, which was high level in the
[33:43.880 --> 33:47.720]  engineering department, able to see these documents and Congress has been lied to.
[33:47.720 --> 33:52.360]  But classically, just like motorcycle gangs like Hell's Angels will use what they call
[33:52.360 --> 33:57.000]  puppet organizations to carry out their crimes for them.
[33:57.000 --> 33:58.000]  That's what you're hearing.
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.680]  We got secret documents, thanks to Mike Cernovich last year, which Google admitted were real,
[34:02.680 --> 34:07.520]  where they were hiring outside contractors, paying a millions of dollars to go in manually
[34:07.520 --> 34:14.440]  and downvote us and spam using my name to then say in full wars was not real news.
[34:14.440 --> 34:17.720]  That's exactly what he was just getting at and make one more point and turn it back over
[34:17.720 --> 34:22.200]  to live interview and understand how much courage Mr. Voorhees has.
[34:22.200 --> 34:24.040]  You expand on that.
[34:24.040 --> 34:28.960]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, media matters and others, they hired over 100,000 people
[34:28.960 --> 34:33.920]  trained by them to be brought into Google who then on their outside time are given these
[34:33.920 --> 34:38.520]  exploits and then go in and do it and then Google has the plausible deniability.
[34:38.520 --> 34:41.120]  This is criminal racketeering in my view.
[34:41.120 --> 34:45.600]  So I'd like Owen to take over, ask these key questions, we'll show some of these articles
[34:45.600 --> 34:50.320]  and then I'd also like to get into what he thinks Congress should do.
[34:50.320 --> 34:52.800]  But what he's saying is so central.
[34:52.800 --> 34:55.680]  Tulsi Gabbard is beautiful, smart, a real liberal.
[34:55.680 --> 34:57.080]  I really like her.
[34:57.080 --> 34:59.240]  She pulls the best so they bury her.
[34:59.240 --> 35:03.040]  Just like Bernie Sanders was polling better than Hillary, so they buried him.
[35:03.040 --> 35:04.040]  This is what they're able to do.
[35:04.040 --> 35:08.120]  When he says this is about the left and right being censored, he's absolutely correct.
[35:08.120 --> 35:09.920]  They're going to try to make this partisan.
[35:09.920 --> 35:10.920]  He's right.
[35:10.920 --> 35:14.240]  These big giants, these big tech giants want total control.
[35:14.240 --> 35:17.600]  They're working with China to suppress their own liberal movements.
[35:17.600 --> 35:22.200]  So back to Owen Schreuer and this incredible Google whistleblower, we're top linked on
[35:22.200 --> 35:23.720]  DrudgeReport.com.
[35:23.720 --> 35:24.720]  History's happening.
[35:24.720 --> 35:25.720]  Please share the link.
[35:25.720 --> 35:28.280]  Back to our guest.
[35:28.280 --> 35:31.160]  So I want to get into two things with you now, Zach.
[35:31.160 --> 35:37.080]  One is exactly what they did specifically to keep Tulsi Gabbard from trending in Google
[35:37.080 --> 35:41.520]  search results and to keep her ad campaign from showing up during the presidential debate.
[35:41.520 --> 35:47.520]  And then I want to talk about the other thing that Google does, or if they are aware of
[35:47.520 --> 35:51.680]  this going on, we got the internal documents that they are hiring people, but they use
[35:51.680 --> 35:55.920]  other groups out there to go flag a bunch of things and they say, oh, we just have curated
[35:55.920 --> 36:00.560]  content where the end user flags hate speech or abusive behavior.
[36:00.560 --> 36:02.560]  Well, they don't actually check that.
[36:02.560 --> 36:06.320]  They just look at the flaggings and say, oh, that's a flag you're banned.
[36:06.320 --> 36:07.320]  We banned Alex Jones.
[36:07.320 --> 36:08.320]  We banned you.
[36:08.320 --> 36:09.320]  So let's talk about that.
[36:09.320 --> 36:13.120]  But first, get into the specifics of what Tulsi Gabbard's attorneys need to know about
[36:13.120 --> 36:18.120]  what Google did to keep her from trending and from showing up with her ads during the
[36:18.120 --> 36:20.200]  Democrat presidential debate.
[36:20.200 --> 36:21.600]  Right.
[36:21.600 --> 36:27.520]  So I want to clarify that I don't have direct knowledge on how exactly Tulsi Gabbard got
[36:27.520 --> 36:28.520]  down.
[36:28.520 --> 36:34.040]  All I know is that it matches the pattern that it took on how Jordan B. Peterson was
[36:34.040 --> 36:35.040]  taking down.
[36:35.040 --> 36:37.760]  And that's just a Tulsi out of existence.
[36:37.760 --> 36:38.760]  Yeah.
[36:38.760 --> 36:44.720]  And there's been other people that have been taken out using this method of attack.
[36:44.720 --> 36:49.520]  And it actually constitutes a family of attacks where there are these vulnerabilities that
[36:49.520 --> 36:56.600]  Google is allowing third parties to exploit in order to take down targets that they want
[36:56.600 --> 36:58.840]  to take out.
[36:58.840 --> 37:04.120]  So let's talk about this other angle, which is a bunch of people going in and flagging
[37:04.120 --> 37:10.960]  groups consciously doing this to flag people they don't like, like for, say, Alex Jones.
[37:10.960 --> 37:13.440]  Does Google know that this is going on?
[37:13.440 --> 37:18.200]  How aware is Google that groups of people consciously go flag people they don't like
[37:18.200 --> 37:20.360]  for abusive behavior or hate speech?
[37:20.360 --> 37:24.280]  And then the AI ends up censoring those people based on the numbers that they have in the
[37:24.280 --> 37:27.720]  algorithm for the number of flaggings it takes to do so.
[37:27.720 --> 37:30.760]  How aware is Google that that is going on?
[37:30.760 --> 37:34.800]  I mean, we're aware of it as anyone who investigates it sees that that's happening.
[37:34.800 --> 37:40.520]  And you don't need to be an insider to know that 5,000 downvotes on a video that appear
[37:40.520 --> 37:45.160]  in the span of 30 seconds is not normal, right?
[37:45.160 --> 37:51.640]  And so the data on this is pretty clear that there is gamification of the system by automated
[37:51.640 --> 37:58.000]  systems that other people are using to control.
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.000]  And all that data is being claimed as a trade secret.
[38:03.000 --> 38:10.360]  And so because it can't be audited, there is the plausible deniability of calling anybody
[38:10.360 --> 38:15.360]  who says that a conspiracy theory theorist.
[38:15.360 --> 38:20.000]  So what, I mean, because I'm trying to think, are they trying to just act incompetent?
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.120]  You obviously saw what was going on.
[38:22.120 --> 38:23.440]  You collected the documents.
[38:23.440 --> 38:25.360]  You released them so that the people know what's going on.
[38:25.360 --> 38:29.760]  But when you brought this to other executives or perhaps superiors at Google saying, hey,
[38:29.760 --> 38:33.840]  look what they're doing to try to stop people's voices from being heard, this AI algorithm
[38:33.840 --> 38:35.320]  isn't working fairly.
[38:35.320 --> 38:38.520]  We have these groups going out and flagging things that they shouldn't be flagging.
[38:38.520 --> 38:40.960]  What was the response?
[38:40.960 --> 38:45.120]  I got reprimanded for trying to bring this to attention.
[38:45.120 --> 38:53.760]  So it was literally setting me down and saying, you've been too outspoken and this is going
[38:53.760 --> 38:56.760]  to reflect negatively on your next performance review.
[38:56.760 --> 38:59.960]  I mean, that sounds like a big brother to me.
[38:59.960 --> 39:00.960]  It is.
[39:00.960 --> 39:01.960]  And then they don't follow through.
[39:01.960 --> 39:02.960]  It's a bluff, right?
[39:02.960 --> 39:04.240]  Because they just want to shut you up.
[39:04.240 --> 39:10.160]  But they don't want any record that they're retaliating for political based speech.
[39:10.160 --> 39:15.000]  And so there's really no outlet for people to go to try to fix the system because the
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.040]  system is not broken by accident.
[39:17.040 --> 39:19.160]  It's being broken purposely.
[39:19.160 --> 39:23.520]  Well, we've had now three whistleblowers go to Google.
[39:23.520 --> 39:27.240]  We've had, excuse me, Google whistleblowers go to Project Veritas.
[39:27.240 --> 39:30.840]  We've had undercover video from Project Veritas exposing Google.
[39:30.840 --> 39:34.600]  We've had Sundar Pichai perjure himself, in my opinion, under.
[39:34.600 --> 39:36.360]  Perjure himself in front of Congress.
[39:36.360 --> 39:38.440]  So you've witnessed this.
[39:38.440 --> 39:39.440]  You've seen this all.
[39:39.440 --> 39:41.120]  You know it's going on.
[39:41.120 --> 39:45.920]  What do you think about the fact that you had Sundar Pichai perjure himself and there
[39:45.920 --> 39:50.000]  hasn't been any action yet, even though we know that's the case?
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.520]  I mean, well, this is the reason why I'm coming forward is because, you know, as an insider,
[39:54.520 --> 40:02.080]  I can see that the executives have no allegiance to the truth and that not even bringing them
[40:02.080 --> 40:08.440]  under oath is a strong enough method to have them tell the truth.
[40:08.440 --> 40:11.640]  And the thing is, is that they're not just lying to the Congress people.
[40:11.640 --> 40:13.920]  They're not just lying to the American people.
[40:13.920 --> 40:17.280]  They're lying to their stockholders because they're telling their stockholders that they're
[40:17.280 --> 40:18.280]  not doing this.
[40:18.280 --> 40:20.400]  They don't have any ideological bias.
[40:20.400 --> 40:22.400]  And it's it's absurd to think that they don't.
[40:22.400 --> 40:26.960]  I mean, you know, how many how many times can they fool us before we wake up and we
[40:26.960 --> 40:29.200]  say, no, this is something that's deliberate.
[40:29.200 --> 40:31.160]  And this is something that's dark.
[40:31.160 --> 40:37.400]  And this is something that needs to be exposed to the light is Sundar Pichai.
[40:37.400 --> 40:44.280]  Is he really the head of Google or is he just a frontman, in your opinion?
[40:44.280 --> 40:49.240]  It's difficult with these people like a lot of these CEOs seem to be figureheads.
[40:49.240 --> 40:54.520]  And well, I asked because he seemed very aloof during his congressional testimony.
[40:54.520 --> 40:55.520]  Yeah.
[40:55.520 --> 41:00.280]  And the thing is, is that how does, you know, if he's being honest, how does how is he in
[41:00.280 --> 41:01.280]  that role?
[41:01.280 --> 41:04.080]  Because he just seems so incompetent, you know, when they can't answer the questions.
[41:04.080 --> 41:05.640]  But it's not incompetence.
[41:05.640 --> 41:06.640]  It's deception.
[41:06.640 --> 41:09.360]  They don't want their dancing around the truth.
[41:09.360 --> 41:13.440]  And I actually feel bad for these executives like they're under control.
[41:13.440 --> 41:14.440]  They can't.
[41:14.440 --> 41:16.480]  They're not free to say what the truth is.
[41:16.480 --> 41:23.240]  They have to play a very careful dance between what their investors want, what a certain
[41:23.240 --> 41:26.960]  group of investors want to have disposed to the rest of the public.
[41:26.960 --> 41:29.680]  Well, coming up, you got one more segment coming up.
[41:29.680 --> 41:32.440]  Let's talk about what you think Congress and the president should do about this.
[41:32.440 --> 41:36.360]  And then comment on the weight that's been lifted off your soul.
[41:36.360 --> 41:38.640]  But talk about what you were just saying.
[41:38.640 --> 41:42.560]  Other executives, how many other people at Google are like you and how much pressure
[41:42.560 --> 41:44.840]  are there on executives not to come forward right now?
[41:44.840 --> 41:49.760]  Do you think there's about to be a waterfront or are they still intimidated by, you know,
[41:49.760 --> 41:51.400]  powerful forces?
[41:51.400 --> 41:54.560]  So there's this weird culture in Google.
[41:54.560 --> 41:56.680]  It's they're trying to like install this monoculture.
[41:56.680 --> 41:57.680]  And yes, there are people.
[41:57.680 --> 42:01.560]  There's there's kind of a patriot network inside of Google, but they're afraid to come
[42:01.560 --> 42:02.560]  out.
[42:02.560 --> 42:06.920]  And some of it, you know, some of the some of that extends all the way into the executive
[42:06.920 --> 42:08.520]  class.
[42:08.520 --> 42:13.040]  And so the thing is, is that I felt that if I came forward that I would galvanize other
[42:13.040 --> 42:19.120]  people by by paving a path of disclosure for these documents so that people could come
[42:19.120 --> 42:25.000]  forward and say their opinion without violating the the NDA.
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.720]  We've got one more segment with Google whistleblower, Zach Voorhees.
[42:28.720 --> 42:31.840]  First of all, I want to thank Project Veritas for putting your story out there.
[42:31.840 --> 42:35.320]  I want to thank you, Zach Voorhees, for having the courage to come forward and hopefully
[42:35.320 --> 42:36.320]  others will follow.
[42:36.320 --> 42:41.400]  I want to thank Info Wars audience for making sure that we still have this platform despite
[42:41.400 --> 42:43.640]  Google trying to shut us down.
[42:43.640 --> 42:44.640]  This is amazing.
[42:44.640 --> 42:47.800]  I want to thank Drudge for linking to this so we can amplify this story.
[42:47.800 --> 42:54.560]  The world needs to know America needs to know Google is trying to manipulate U.S. elections
[42:54.560 --> 42:59.200]  and potentially committing treason more on the other side with the whistleblower.
[42:59.200 --> 43:03.400]  The globalists are hyper competitive, scientific dictators.
[43:03.400 --> 43:04.400]  They are technocrats.
[43:04.400 --> 43:08.280]  They are control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your
[43:08.280 --> 43:12.800]  own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge
[43:12.800 --> 43:13.800]  with AI gods.
[43:13.800 --> 43:16.000]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.640]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension, but one of the biggest places
[43:19.640 --> 43:24.920]  that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[43:24.920 --> 43:30.200]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[43:30.200 --> 43:34.560]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[43:34.560 --> 43:40.280]  Methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[43:40.280 --> 43:45.160]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going
[43:45.160 --> 43:46.160]  to find anywhere.
[43:46.160 --> 43:47.160]  It is amazing.
[43:47.160 --> 43:52.560]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against
[43:52.560 --> 44:00.200]  the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[44:00.200 --> 44:04.200]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're
[44:04.200 --> 44:07.840]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[44:07.840 --> 44:11.160]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk
[44:11.160 --> 44:14.640]  about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and I'd have
[44:14.640 --> 44:16.960]  doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[44:16.960 --> 44:20.320]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, Hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[44:20.320 --> 44:23.040]  shut us down, the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how
[44:23.040 --> 44:24.600]  great they are and how wonderful they were.
[44:24.600 --> 44:26.600]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[44:26.600 --> 44:30.840]  Jones sells unapproved supplements and he claims are supplements.
[44:30.840 --> 44:36.200]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[44:36.200 --> 44:38.760]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[44:38.760 --> 44:42.600]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the
[44:42.600 --> 44:46.160]  system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[44:46.160 --> 44:47.480]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[44:47.480 --> 44:51.480]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[44:51.480 --> 44:57.640]  God's medicine chest info or store.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one,
[44:57.640 --> 45:00.440]  three, nine.
[45:00.440 --> 45:02.120]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[45:02.120 --> 45:04.240]  I love tuning in to Owen Troyer.
[45:04.240 --> 45:07.880]  I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you.
[45:07.880 --> 45:13.600]  We run during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads show.
[45:13.600 --> 45:14.920]  You think you don't want to hear an ad.
[45:14.920 --> 45:15.920]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[45:15.920 --> 45:18.200]  But here's the bottom line.
[45:18.200 --> 45:22.240]  We're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face of the globalists not contract.
[45:22.240 --> 45:23.480]  I don't want them to win.
[45:23.480 --> 45:26.400]  So listen, you've got this guarantee for me.
[45:26.400 --> 45:31.000]  We saw enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really
[45:31.000 --> 45:32.720]  give the globalists around for their money.
[45:32.720 --> 45:37.280]  But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus, X2, these will change
[45:37.280 --> 45:38.280]  your life.
[45:38.280 --> 45:41.560]  Go check out the turmeric products, check out the water filtration, air filtration, check
[45:41.560 --> 45:42.560]  it all out.
[45:42.560 --> 45:47.000]  Take action and no, be part of the Second American Revolution, be part of Crush the Globalist.
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.120]  And get great products at the same time.
[45:49.120 --> 45:51.480]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[45:51.480 --> 45:53.560]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[45:53.560 --> 46:01.080]  Take action now and fund the Infowar for your own future.
[46:01.080 --> 46:03.560]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[46:03.560 --> 46:06.920]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[46:06.920 --> 46:08.320]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[46:08.320 --> 46:09.960]  I want to take the globalist on.
[46:09.960 --> 46:11.720]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[46:11.720 --> 46:15.800]  Vibrating in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products because we don't mark
[46:15.800 --> 46:16.800]  stuff up that much.
[46:16.800 --> 46:19.840]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[46:19.840 --> 46:24.200]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things
[46:24.200 --> 46:28.560]  like DNA Force Plus, but ultimate krill oil has been sold out for four months for whatever
[46:28.560 --> 46:30.920]  reason this became the most popular fish oil.
[46:30.920 --> 46:35.160]  It's totally full of the bottle and it is the strongest, purest krill oil and it cost
[46:35.160 --> 46:40.000]  us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to
[46:40.000 --> 46:41.560]  remove mercury.
[46:41.560 --> 46:45.320]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like but
[46:45.320 --> 46:47.320]  gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[46:47.320 --> 46:49.600]  It's been boiled, it's been rillined, it's been homogenized.
[46:49.600 --> 46:50.600]  This is not it.
[46:50.600 --> 46:55.280]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're going to find anywhere.
[46:55.280 --> 46:56.720]  Real krill oil folks is red.
[46:56.720 --> 46:57.720]  It's not yellow.
[46:57.720 --> 46:58.720]  It's not milky.
[46:58.720 --> 47:22.120]  It is nothing but krill oil.
[47:22.120 --> 47:25.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a Netflix drama show.
[47:25.840 --> 47:28.280]  This isn't a law and order TV program.
[47:28.280 --> 47:29.280]  This is not a movie.
[47:29.280 --> 47:30.280]  This is not a drill.
[47:30.280 --> 47:31.360]  This is not fiction.
[47:31.360 --> 47:32.360]  This is reality.
[47:32.360 --> 47:36.920]  You have a major Google engineer backing up what the other engineers have said, what the
[47:36.920 --> 47:40.360]  documents have shown, and talking about perjury before Congress.
[47:40.360 --> 47:45.360]  Well, I'm going to turn this over again to Owen Troyer in Austin, Texas to finish up
[47:45.360 --> 47:50.760]  this amazing interview, but pray and support this individual and others to come forward.
[47:50.760 --> 47:54.760]  You heard him say he hopes to blaze a path to get others to have the courage.
[47:54.760 --> 47:55.760]  That's leadership.
[47:55.760 --> 48:00.640]  So, Zach, for he's we salute you, and I'll say this, it's all of our birthright, black,
[48:00.640 --> 48:04.760]  white, old, young, gay, straight from whether you're from San Francisco, New York City or
[48:04.760 --> 48:10.120]  Austin, Texas or Des Moines, Iowa, we're all having our birthright stolen right now.
[48:10.120 --> 48:14.440]  We're seeing election meddling and it's time to admit it and to realize we've seen a giant
[48:14.440 --> 48:16.240]  backdoor power grab.
[48:16.240 --> 48:19.480]  They didn't come like an enemy from over the horizon.
[48:19.480 --> 48:23.480]  They came from inside and they came through cyberspace.
[48:23.480 --> 48:28.440]  Our republic, our constitutional little D democracy has been hacked.
[48:28.440 --> 48:33.240]  And please remember, without your financial support, we wouldn't have stood this withering
[48:33.240 --> 48:36.400]  storm of censorship, attacks and lies.
[48:36.400 --> 48:42.040]  We have the new World Awakens mega sale, Globalist House of Cards collapsing end of summer super
[48:42.040 --> 48:43.040]  sale.
[48:43.040 --> 48:47.720]  It's the big giant 50 to 60% off, store-wide free shipping, double patriot points, but
[48:47.720 --> 48:53.440]  only on 50 something items, not on every item because a bunch of these are very close to
[48:53.440 --> 48:57.760]  selling out, whether it's ultimate krill oil, bodies, turmeric, brain force, plus knockout
[48:57.760 --> 49:01.080]  sleep bait, turbo force, eight pack power stack.
[49:01.080 --> 49:06.360]  It's all 50 to 60% off and your purchases make it all possible here, but an incredible
[49:06.360 --> 49:10.320]  time to be alive, an incredible time to be making history together and standing up and
[49:10.320 --> 49:17.000]  seeing the good guys wake up and to see us coming back from zero to basically tying the
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.840]  globalist right now for a football analogy.
[49:19.840 --> 49:23.680]  So back to Owen Schreuer and Zach Voorhees.
[49:23.680 --> 49:25.920]  Once again, Zach, thank you for joining us.
[49:25.920 --> 49:32.960]  I want to get into Google's ability to rig and manipulate U.S. elections where we have
[49:32.960 --> 49:39.160]  congressmen and media crying, Russia interference, this interference talking about election integrity.
[49:39.160 --> 49:44.960]  Do you think Google is the biggest threat to U.S. elections?
[49:44.960 --> 49:50.080]  I think that, you know, if you want to look at the biggest threat, it's Google together
[49:50.080 --> 49:57.520]  with Facebook, together with Twitter, they form this echo chamber in which if they want
[49:57.520 --> 50:02.040]  to apply their control of narratives, then what they're going to do is they're going
[50:02.040 --> 50:06.680]  to press down the voices that they don't want and they're going to boost up the voices
[50:06.680 --> 50:07.680]  that they do.
[50:07.680 --> 50:16.040]  So Infowars has been sort of the main victim in this and it's clear that as if your audience
[50:16.040 --> 50:21.280]  looks through the disclosure list hosted at project Veritas.com, they're going to see
[50:21.280 --> 50:27.160]  Infowars pop up in numerous blacklists that have been disclosed.
[50:27.160 --> 50:32.920]  Now do you actually have information from people inside Facebook or Twitter that they're
[50:32.920 --> 50:36.800]  doing the same thing Google is doing to censor voices like Alex Jones?
[50:36.800 --> 50:37.800]  Yeah.
[50:37.800 --> 50:40.800]  In fact, it's been disclosed with Project Veritas.
[50:40.800 --> 50:44.880]  There was a leaker from Facebook and there was a leaker from Pinterest who came out and
[50:44.880 --> 50:52.240]  disclosed that, you know, people in the influencer networks are being, you know, nefariously
[50:52.240 --> 50:54.640]  blacklisted within these companies.
[50:54.640 --> 50:58.160]  And I understand the same pattern that's being applied to Google is the same pattern
[50:58.160 --> 51:03.480]  that's being applied to Facebook, which is the same pattern that's being applied to Pinterest.
[51:03.480 --> 51:07.880]  You know, Project Veritas did an undercover sing operation with the Twitter folks.
[51:07.880 --> 51:13.200]  And what these people say when, you know, they don't think that the cameras are rolling
[51:13.200 --> 51:14.720]  is pretty insane.
[51:14.720 --> 51:20.360]  You know, they think that if you love guns, if you, you know, enjoy your First Amendment
[51:20.360 --> 51:25.520]  rights that you're a Russian bot, you know, and, and when I tell people that they have
[51:25.520 --> 51:31.040]  their skeptical, but that's literally what was on the video.
[51:31.040 --> 51:36.960]  What do you think this does knowing what these big tech companies do and the power they have?
[51:36.960 --> 51:40.160]  What do you think this does to U.S. election integrity?
[51:40.160 --> 51:48.280]  I mean, election, U.S. election integrity goes out the window if the voices on the left
[51:48.280 --> 51:55.560]  and voices on the right can't, can't have a voice, you know, and, you know, Google's
[51:55.560 --> 52:01.000]  mission statement is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible.
[52:01.000 --> 52:02.000]  And useful.
[52:02.000 --> 52:07.040]  You know, when Info World, when Info Wars was taking, was taken offline, was that making
[52:07.040 --> 52:10.360]  information universally accessible and useful?
[52:10.360 --> 52:16.440]  No, it wasn't, you know, when other news sites are taking off the index, is that making
[52:16.440 --> 52:18.640]  information universally accessible?
[52:18.640 --> 52:19.640]  And no, it's not.
[52:19.640 --> 52:24.200]  So they're clearly violating their contract, their social contract that they've given
[52:24.200 --> 52:27.400]  to, to the American people and to their investors.
[52:27.400 --> 52:32.280]  And I'm specifically talking about Google here because when they went IPO on their initial
[52:32.280 --> 52:37.640]  public offering, they had a constitution that they said that they would not violate.
[52:37.640 --> 52:39.680]  And the first one was do no evil.
[52:39.680 --> 52:44.160]  The second one was, you know, organize the world's information and they're violating
[52:44.160 --> 52:45.840]  that that mandate.
[52:45.840 --> 52:49.920]  And they're lying to Congress under oath that they're violating that that thing by giving
[52:49.920 --> 52:54.040]  the field the deception that they're still following it and that they're not politically
[52:54.040 --> 52:56.880]  biased.
[52:56.880 --> 53:03.760]  What do you think comes next in this disclosure of what Google is doing to manipulate U.S.
[53:03.760 --> 53:04.760]  elections?
[53:04.760 --> 53:09.080]  And what would you like to say to the Google executives that are engaging in this?
[53:09.080 --> 53:12.600]  Yeah, well, something, something quite amazing is happening right now.
[53:12.600 --> 53:16.160]  Like there's been a huge document up, I've released over 950 pages.
[53:16.160 --> 53:20.680]  And right now there is a crowd raid.
[53:20.680 --> 53:24.760]  There are a bunch of users, they, they're, they're looking at these documents, they're
[53:24.760 --> 53:30.160]  digesting them and they're posting the content of them onto Twitter for us all to see.
[53:30.160 --> 53:35.800]  And so, you know, one of the things I want to invite for your audience is to come online,
[53:35.800 --> 53:40.440]  you know, go to Project Veritas, see their, their, their disclosure.
[53:40.440 --> 53:42.800]  They've posted a link to all of these documents.
[53:42.800 --> 53:48.120]  I'm asking your audience to download the everything dot zip file and just go to town.
[53:48.120 --> 53:52.680]  And the thing is, is that whatever you think Google is doing, I promise you it's way,
[53:52.680 --> 53:53.680]  way worse.
[53:53.680 --> 53:59.280]  You know, I see the reaction online and everyone, everyone's like, you know, WTF, WTF.
[53:59.280 --> 54:05.360]  And I'm like, yes, everyone is now seeing what I've seen privately.
[54:05.360 --> 54:12.240]  And you know, we're finally having the exposure of light into the darkness and, and people
[54:12.240 --> 54:15.200]  are finally understanding what's really going on in America.
[54:15.200 --> 54:16.200]  Yeah.
[54:16.200 --> 54:21.520]  I mean, this is like finding out the NFL has been telling referees to favor a certain team
[54:21.520 --> 54:23.720]  every year and they keep winning the Super Bowl.
[54:23.720 --> 54:26.280]  That's what this is, but they're doing it with U.S. elections.
[54:26.280 --> 54:29.160]  So what would you like to say, though, to the Google executives that are engaged in
[54:29.160 --> 54:33.800]  this right now, as you're saying that they, some of them that have testified are guilty
[54:33.800 --> 54:34.800]  of perjury?
[54:34.800 --> 54:44.240]  What I have to say to the executives is that your days of deception are limited.
[54:44.240 --> 54:48.800]  We are all paying attention to the things that you're saying.
[54:48.800 --> 54:56.000]  And whatever you say is going to be audited at some point in the future.
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.160]  And you're going to be held to account to lying to the American public because it's
[55:00.160 --> 55:02.520]  not just about corporate profits.
[55:02.520 --> 55:06.280]  You've entered into the dangerous territory of national security issue.
[55:06.280 --> 55:10.240]  You're now exposing yourself as a national security threat.
[55:10.240 --> 55:14.240]  You're hosting your AI Manhattan project in a foreign country.
[55:14.240 --> 55:18.280]  Meanwhile, you're using deception in order to cancel contracts with the United States
[55:18.280 --> 55:19.280]  military.
[55:19.280 --> 55:22.680]  So, you know, who is it that you're working for?
[55:22.680 --> 55:24.400]  Why are you beholden to them?
[55:24.400 --> 55:28.800]  And have you been infiltrated so thoroughly by foreign actors that you're now taking
[55:28.800 --> 55:33.720]  this position because you're afraid of the retribution of this infiltration?
[55:33.720 --> 55:40.200]  Now, you said something interesting, a Manhattan AI project that they've moved to a foreign
[55:40.200 --> 55:41.200]  country.
[55:41.200 --> 55:42.200]  Are you talking about China?
[55:42.200 --> 55:43.760]  Yes, I am.
[55:43.760 --> 55:48.720]  And what is that project that you would say is the AI equivalent of a Manhattan project,
[55:48.720 --> 55:51.880]  which was, of course, the atom bomb?
[55:51.880 --> 55:56.240]  So the equivalent that Google is working on is called deep mind.
[55:56.240 --> 56:00.480]  And if people use that keyword, they can search for it right now.
[56:00.480 --> 56:06.400]  And they can find, they've been pretty public about all that information about deep mind.
[56:06.400 --> 56:14.120]  But Google has been trying to deceive the public by creating a fake AI project called
[56:14.120 --> 56:16.680]  Dragonfly.
[56:16.680 --> 56:21.880]  And you know, they were telling the public that Dragonfly was their censorship weapon
[56:21.880 --> 56:26.080]  and they were, and everyone was like, oh, what's up with Dragonfly?
[56:26.080 --> 56:30.120]  And they're trying to find information, but no information existed because it was a fake
[56:30.120 --> 56:31.120]  project.
[56:31.120 --> 56:35.080]  And you'll know that it's a fake project because right after I disclosed ML fairness,
[56:35.080 --> 56:40.480]  which is the real AI censorship project, Google then decided that, OK, well, the ruse
[56:40.480 --> 56:41.480]  is over.
[56:41.480 --> 56:44.400]  We're just going to, you know, officially terminate the Dragonfly project.
[56:44.400 --> 56:46.880]  And that happened in July.
[56:46.880 --> 56:50.680]  What do you know about the deep mind product project that they're doing in China?
[56:50.680 --> 56:51.680]  Have they been testing this?
[56:51.680 --> 56:56.520]  Have they have they done any sort of form of seeing if it truly is artificially intelligent?
[56:56.520 --> 56:59.240]  Have they done, let's say, human testing?
[56:59.240 --> 57:00.720]  I don't know.
[57:00.720 --> 57:03.720]  That's probably like top secret for the company.
[57:03.720 --> 57:07.800]  The person that seems to know most about this is Peter Thiel.
[57:07.800 --> 57:13.280]  He wrote an article in The New York Times a week ago accusing Google of treason and
[57:13.280 --> 57:18.640]  asking for an investigation into Google's activities with China.
[57:18.640 --> 57:25.280]  So I'm going to direct your audience to, you know, search that direction for, you know,
[57:25.280 --> 57:29.800]  the accusations of what Google is doing with China with their with their AI Manhattan project
[57:29.800 --> 57:31.800]  called Deep Mind.
[57:31.800 --> 57:35.560]  This is incredible if you can stick around for five more minutes, we'd love to have you.
[57:35.560 --> 57:40.360]  Zach Voorhees, Google executive whistleblower, huge document dump, this kind of stuff changes
[57:40.360 --> 57:41.360]  the world.
[57:41.360 --> 57:45.000]  I'd like to know, what is it like knowing that Google pretty much can just follow you
[57:45.000 --> 57:50.080]  anywhere you go, spy on you, listen to you, does that scare you?
[57:50.080 --> 57:52.320]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[57:52.320 --> 57:55.640]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[57:55.640 --> 57:57.080]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[57:57.080 --> 57:58.720]  I want to take the globalist on.
[57:58.720 --> 58:00.480]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[58:00.480 --> 58:04.760]  Vibrating in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, we don't mark stuff
[58:04.760 --> 58:05.760]  up that much.
[58:05.760 --> 58:08.600]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[58:08.600 --> 58:12.960]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things
[58:12.960 --> 58:17.080]  like DNA Force Plus, but ultimate krill oil has been sold out for four months.
[58:17.080 --> 58:19.680]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[58:19.680 --> 58:20.680]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[58:20.680 --> 58:25.880]  And it is the strongest, purest krill oil and it cost us three times more because we
[58:25.880 --> 58:30.280]  have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[58:30.280 --> 58:34.080]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like but
[58:34.080 --> 58:36.080]  gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[58:36.080 --> 58:38.360]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[58:38.360 --> 58:39.360]  This is not good.
[58:39.360 --> 58:44.040]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're going to find anywhere.
[58:44.040 --> 58:45.480]  Real krill oil folks is red.
[58:45.480 --> 58:46.480]  It's not yellow.
[58:46.480 --> 58:47.480]  It's not milky.
[58:47.480 --> 58:52.600]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[58:52.600 --> 58:57.360]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:21.000]  Double Awakening is incredible, there are fires lighting in the mines of men and women everywhere.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:31.760]  The whole house of cards is coming down, you can smell it, you can see it, but Google and
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.960]  the other big tech are pushing more racial division, more collapse of society, a few
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:40.820]  final questions for Zach Vorhees who will get a lot of heat for this, but people understand
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:44.660]  now, the good guys get the heat, there's a real turning point we've reached, we are
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:47.340]  now getting the upper hand against evil.
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:52.220]  But this is so historic, I wanted Owen just to ask a few final questions, and then I'm
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.020]  coming back with my next segment with my own comments.
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:01:00.740]  But I think the central point here is, if Trump doesn't act and act very strategically
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:06.020]  now, and if Congress doesn't act, and the people don't act in a peaceful way, then there's
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:12.780]  no limit, because Owen was bringing up all the spying by big tech, Facebook listening
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:16.460]  to in your house and transcribing it and selling it to people, and then lying to Congress
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:18.980]  about it, these people are out of control.
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:24.620]  They are the new axis of evil threat like Hitler and Mussolini were, I mean, I'm sorry,
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:26.500]  they are beyond that in their power.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.380]  So Owen, final questions for Zach.
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:34.580]  Well, Zach, I want to ask you point blank right now, because not only are probably the
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:38.020]  executives of Google tuned in right now listening to what you have to say, but my guess is
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:40.900]  that the White House is listening very closely as well.
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:45.700]  So as a Google executive that's been with Google for nearly 10 years, you've been in
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:49.940]  the meetings, you've seen the internal memos, you've released the documents, do you believe
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:55.380]  that Google, as an entity, a powerful entity that it is, will do anything and everything
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:02:01.700]  they can to keep Donald Trump from winning the 2020 presidential election?
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:06.860]  Every single time I thought that Google would have some limit, some line that they wouldn't
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:10.380]  like pass, they blew past it.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:19.500]  And I want to tell you a story about a breaking point that I had, which was in 2017, Trump
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:29.140]  made a tweet that included Arabic after he came back from Saudi Arabia, and Google deleted
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:38.740]  a word out of the Arabic translation dictionary in order to make the Trump tweet become nonsense.
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:40.660]  Explain that a little more in detail.
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:45.580]  You're saying I caught Google deleting words out of the Arabic translation dictionary to
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.340]  make Trump tweets sound crazy.
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:53.020]  So you're saying they want people in, let's say, Saudi Arabia to see Trump's tweets,
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:56.020]  but get a different translation than what it actually was.
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:01.740]  Okay, so Trump came back from Saudi Arabia, and he made a tweet, and it was something
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:08.380]  like, the news is fake, kefefe, well, kefefe was a word that existed in the Arabic to
[01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:10.700]  English translation dictionary.
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:16.820]  Google deleted that because the New York Times made an article arguing that the word
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.620]  didn't make any sense.
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:21.300]  And so they went through, they created a design document.
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:30.740]  I think this was June 1, 2017, saying we need to get rid of this word because it doesn't
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.380]  make any sense.
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:36.780]  And it's an error that we're translating it into an English equivalent.
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:43.380]  So they created this design duck, and then they created this bug feature so that you
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:47.100]  can track the engineers as they make progress towards their goal.
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:52.500]  And not only did they have to delete it once, they actually had to delete it twice because
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.620]  the AI was smart enough that it was able to translate the word through a different path.
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:01.420]  So in this log, you can see the engineers going through and saying, oh, wait, we've deleted
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:02.940]  it, but it's still appearing.
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:03.940]  Why is this?
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:05.180]  And then they go through the resolution.
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:09.100]  Yep, there it is, the kefefe Easter egg.
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:12.260]  And they deleted it off the internet.
[01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:18.900]  And then everybody, and then shortly thereafter, there was an attempt to invoke the 25th Amendment
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:22.660]  against the president of the United States by saying that he was crazy because he was
[01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.420]  tweeting nonsense.
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:26.980]  But the nonsense was after the fact.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:27.980]  Wow.
[01:04:27.980 --> 01:04:31.300]  And so that was your breaking point where you realized, yes, Google will do anything
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.300]  to stop Trump.
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:36.900]  Yeah, that was that was a final thank you so much, Zachary Voorhees, hero whistleblower,
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:40.700]  Google executive Alex Jones, final statement.
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:45.860]  That man needs to testify to Congress along with a professor, Epstein, Robert Epstein
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:46.860]  and others.
[01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:47.860]  This is huge.
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:48.860]  This is a giant scandal.
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:52.300]  Coming up my interview with Steven Crowder when he interviewed me yesterday, then we'll
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:54.700]  be back live with so much more.
[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:55.700]  Stay with us.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:56.700]  History's happening.
[01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:59.140]  And thank you to the whistleblower and everybody else making this possible.

[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:25.500]  We were just able to have a groundbreaking interview that will be seen millions of times
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:30.940]  even though YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Google all wanted it to never be seen.
[01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:32.140]  They wanted us shut down.
[01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:33.420]  Thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:34.420]  We are still here.
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:38.500]  Now, Alex Jones did an interview with Steven Crowder.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.860]  It was very powerful, very informative and fun.
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.100]  Here is how it went.
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:46.020]  Well, we have a ton to talk about.
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:49.060]  But first off, I want to say I don't know that that's true about anyone mentioned because
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.540]  you were on one of the change my minds.
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:54.340]  We ran some of that and we've had you on since and I don't think YouTube is banned.
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:58.700]  I mean, maybe we're just fortunate, but obviously I know that they've been after you and you've
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:02.260]  been public enemy number one with them, but we don't really care.
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:03.260]  I mean, we care for you.
[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:04.260]  It's Facebook.
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:05.260]  It's Facebook.
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:07.500]  It's Facebook that's been doing the total blackout.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.780]  And sure, they let me get on Joe Rogan.
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:10.780]  He talked to YouTube before.
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:13.980]  They said, fine, because you're big enough, you're respected enough, but a lot of the
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:18.580]  smaller shows and things that I've gone on have gotten strikes because they don't have
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:19.740]  a big enough name.
[01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:26.220]  Take the guy that uploaded the video of Chris Cuomo blowing up in New York.
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:29.260]  Well, they took his video down till there was an outcry.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:30.260]  They put the video back up.
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:34.220]  So I think it's because you've got enough clout and a big fan base that supports you
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:35.380]  that you're still here, my friend.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:38.020]  I mean, as you know, they've been working around the clock to take you off.
[01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:39.020]  Yes, I do.
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:40.940]  I don't know about clout or respect fan base.
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:41.940]  I appreciate it.
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:43.860]  I'm certainly not respected in the halls of Google.
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.980]  They've made that no secret.
[01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:49.100]  Before we get into, I want to talk about Epstein, because obviously this seems, like
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.500]  I said, we said, well, we want to get Mr. Jones on.
[01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:55.660]  But what's your take on Chris Cuomo and Fredo?
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:58.660]  First off, do you believe that Fredo is as bad as the N-word to Italians?
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.140]  I'm not sold.
[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:06.420]  Well, I mean, in fact, I interviewed the fellow that was given the video.
[01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.860]  It's called That's the Point with Brandon.
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:13.380]  And he was given the video by a very wealthy individual, very wealthy family.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:20.220]  It turns out, is Italian, and just called the guy Fredo, because everybody knows that
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.180]  Chris Cuomo is a chump.
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.780]  He's the guy that said the Epstein thing shouldn't be investigated.
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:29.300]  He's the guy that said, if you're re-wiki leaks, you'll go to jail, but I'm allowed
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:30.300]  to.
[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:33.100]  He's the guy that said, if you're an 11-year-old daughter, doesn't want to be in the shower
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:38.340]  with a transgendered woman with large genitals, large male genitals that she's bad.
[01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:42.260]  So what is the large matter when it comes to transgendered genitals?
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:44.500]  The fair genitals, that's enough.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.500]  Exactly.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:50.020]  But expanding on that, this is the guy that's always blowing up at people, always threatening
[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:51.020]  him.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:57.180]  And new video has surfaced where he called himself Fredo on TV a decade ago.
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.820]  His dad called him Fredo.
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:00.540]  So we now know what this means.
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:04.180]  He's the dumb son compared to his brother, the governor, who's still pretty bad.
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:05.500]  America's never been that great.
[01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:06.900]  It's not going to be great.
[01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:11.300]  So this is my view on it, and I think it's the truth.
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:15.500]  They've already said anybody that Trump supports, anybody that supports Trump, or anybody that
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:19.180]  wants to keep their guns, or anybody that likes capitalism, or anybody that's just right
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:23.060]  of Mao Zedong or Vi Lenin is a racist.
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:26.900]  So by logical extension, if somebody says, hey, Fredo, can I take a picture with you?
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:27.900]  Oh, you just attacked me.
[01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:32.340]  I'm an Italian American with a CNN show worth tens of millions of dollars, and my brother's
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:35.780]  the governor, and our family's worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:39.740]  I've got white privilege, but because I'm Italian, you just put me down.
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:40.740]  That's the n-word.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.140]  I'm not going to throw you down the stairs.
[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:43.140]  I'm going to wreck you.
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:47.860]  Basically, I'm going to kill you because you dared joke at a public figure.
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:53.340]  It shows the entitlement of these elites, but now wrapping themselves in this new calculus
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:57.580]  of all Trump supporters are racist, or anyone that disagrees with me is a racist, so they've
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:01.700]  kind of an alchemy now to, oh, well, don't call me any names because that's racist, too.
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:05.860]  Well, I mean, to be fair, I think it's poor form to call somebody, like, to insult somebody.
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:07.780]  It was meant to be insulting in front of his wife and kid.
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:10.100]  Like, I think that there's sort of these rules of engagements where-
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:11.900]  Turns out that's not- that's a lie, though.
[01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.460]  His wife and kid weren't there reportedly.
[01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:16.460]  Okay, well, either way, if someone, for example, we talk about Sarah Huckabee being out to
[01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:17.660]  dinner, like, I don't like Chris Cuomo.
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:20.660]  I call him the DNC pool boy in chief just because- and by the way, it sounds like his
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.660]  dad's a dick if his dad called him a freighter.
[01:10:22.660 --> 01:10:25.140]  It sounds like that guy was setting him up to fail.
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.140]  He was like, what are you setting me up for, Dad?
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:28.140]  CNN.
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:29.140]  Primetime?
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:30.140]  No, I think you're right.
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:31.140]  We don't want to become Maxine Waters.
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.140]  Right.
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.300]  When they're getting gas harassed, when they're in the grocery store harassed, when they're
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:37.140]  at the mall harassed them, I get harassed all the place, so do you.
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:40.300]  That's why I did that joke bit where I walked up and harassed you as a leftist, and you
[01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:43.100]  were, you know, kind-hearted, not to slug me, because you and your dad are both pretty
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.100]  big guys.
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.900]  But, you know, I mean, I think you're right that, overall, we don't want to become the
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:47.900]  left.
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:48.900]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:52.140]  And that does not change the fact that he clearly overreacted, because I get this kind
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:56.380]  of stuff all the time, and I just say, oh, okay, all right, and my rule is, I can't let
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:59.140]  you get within arm's length of me if you're being aggressive, that's different, you know,
[01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:02.740]  but if someone were to say, hey, I've had people go, hey, Steven, you're a fag, okay,
[01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:05.900]  whatever, all right, I take the good with the bad, okay.
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:09.420]  So yeah, Fredo, we get it, Chris Cuomo, not a great guy, I don't think anyone's a fan
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:10.420]  of him.
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:13.580]  And what's crazy about him is his ratings are terrible, like nobody, you know what nobody
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:17.700]  is, what I haven't, I don't imagine, I can't say this, I don't want to say it definitively,
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:21.860]  because this could end up being a permaband, but I don't imagine that anyone has said,
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:24.060]  you know what I really want to know?
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:27.860]  What Chris Cuomo thinks about X?
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:31.420]  We have had a lot of people saying, you know what, you should probably get Alex Jones'
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:37.180]  take on the Epstein saga, because he talked about this and predicted it a while ago.
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:42.220]  Now, to be clear, you've talked about sort of this, the pedophile rings and those in
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:46.540]  power and people who are sexual abuse or sex trafficking, which we know, I don't use the
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:49.700]  word pedophile rings, but that's really what it is, it's a pedophile ring.
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:51.740]  Let me just give you an open field here.
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:55.060]  What's your take on the Epstein issue right now?
[01:11:55.060 --> 01:12:00.900]  First off, do you think that he committed suicide or was he suicide and then your thoughts?
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:05.380]  Okay, I'm not somebody that thinks he's in the witness protection program.
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:09.380]  Most people I see online, when they learn that the cameras were turned off, he was moved
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:15.100]  out of death watch, he was put in a cell by himself, and then wallah, you know, the body
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:19.220]  basically disappears and now they're saying we can't hear about the autopsy for some time.
[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:24.180]  A lot of folks think that he was basically, again, a witness protection program.
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:28.780]  And because we've been lied to so much, people have a right to think that.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:31.860]  People have a right to think he actually committed suicide, people have a right to think that
[01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:35.340]  he was murdered, but the evidence points towards murder.
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:39.780]  He had this little black book, he had all this information at his island.
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:44.340]  He was reportedly talking about working with the Trump administration and prosecutors.
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:49.660]  He was a concierge, he was a pimp, and I'll get to that next, but for very powerful big
[01:12:49.660 --> 01:12:58.020]  groups setting up these facilities in New Mexico and the Caribbean, and it's huge compound
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:02.100]  in New York, where people just didn't have sex with underage girls and things, they did
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:08.500]  all sorts of rituals and drugs and weird eugenics things, and if people go back to documentaries
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:12.820]  and reports I've done over the last 10 years, well, really 20, but Epstein's name specifically
[01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:21.700]  for 10, I explain, it's a whole cult religion based on transhumanism and eugenics that's
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:27.900]  then merged with trauma-based mind control and things developed by the CIA and MI6.
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:34.260]  And the reason I knew about this was I was told by Ted Gunderson, oh, let me get to that
[01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:35.260]  next.
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:36.260]  Okay.
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:37.260]  Going back to what I think happened.
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:39.100]  Let me ask you this real quick, because you mentioned it's a sort of cultish religion,
[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:42.580]  and as a Christian I believe that people can be serving evil without necessarily knowing
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:43.580]  it.
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:46.700]  For example, you know, the greatest trick Satan never played is making you believe that he
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:47.700]  doesn't exist, right?
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:50.660]  I think he's going to show up in a busty, in the form of a busty secretary, not a creaky
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:53.420]  coffin, like most Satanists aren't really worshiping Satan.
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:57.980]  So when you say that, do you mean they are actually a part of a Satanic cult knowingly,
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:02.860]  or it's just hedonism and serving the flesh and being very selfish, and so it basically
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:07.660]  manifests itself as this sort of glorified self-religion?
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:08.660]  That is exactly right.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:12.700]  And if I have the time, I mean, because anybody that studied history, you already know all
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:13.700]  the answers to this, Steve.
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:15.620]  I'm not kissing your ass, it's true.
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:19.420]  But just getting back to your first question, because I'm already digressing, I don't believe
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:24.140]  he staged his death, because dead men tell no tales, they want to threaten all the other
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:30.660]  witnesses to show them we can kill him inside a federal jail in New York City, nobody can
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:31.660]  stop us.
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:33.620]  So let's go to what I really think happened.
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:37.980]  We know that all the default protections were turned off.
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:42.060]  We know that somebody already tried to kill him in the cell, he had told people that,
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:45.820]  that's come out in the news, so they moved him with somebody else.
[01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:49.020]  Then a few days before, they moved him into a cell by himself.
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:51.580]  They take him off suicide watch.
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:57.420]  Then there's a camera over the cell, that malfunction, that's now ABC News, NBC News,
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:58.580]  that's confirmed.
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:03.100]  Then they tell all the guards that normally every 30 minutes, go by your cell, don't worry
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:07.100]  about it, take off the day early, they go off an hour early.
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:13.940]  Someone who'd never been a worker at that jail, this is CBS News today, was allowed
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:19.860]  in to the facility and then reportedly, this is now in CBS News and others are reporting
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:25.300]  it, that people heard screaming and yelling and basically begging for his life.
[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:33.580]  As people go into his cell, then they start shouting, breathe, breathe, breathe, Epstein.
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:38.940]  Now a lot of people have obviously speculated what's going on here, but everything is turned
[01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:43.700]  off, all the emergency defaults are turned off, that everything is left in the black.
[01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:48.980]  The door opens, two guards go in and then immediately we hear him screaming and yelling
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:56.500]  the exact words that I have written down here was that he was basically begging for
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.060]  his life.
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:04.020]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now

[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:03.300]  Thank you for your support, we won't be here and I couldn't thank you all enough for the
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:04.620]  fact that you've kept us in the game.
[01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:08.460]  I mean I want to stay in this game, I want to take the globalist on, total transparencies
[01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:09.460]  are whole operation.
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:13.380]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products because we don't
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:14.380]  mark stuff up that much.
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:17.580]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:21.900]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:26.300]  like DNA Force Plus, but ultimate krill oil has been sold out for four months for whatever
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:28.620]  reason this became the most popular fish oil.
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:32.860]  It's totally full of the bottle and it is the strongest purest krill oil and it cost
[01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:37.700]  us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:38.700]  remove mercury.
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:43.020]  Any kind of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like but
[01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:45.020]  gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.300]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:48.300]  This is not good.
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:52.980]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're going to find anywhere.
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:56.100]  Real krill oil folks is red, it's not yellow, it's not milky.
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:58.980]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:02.900]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:07.420]  The other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:12.420]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire,
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:15.980]  that's not being funded by secret foreign government, it is completely independent of
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:16.980]  all that.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:22.340]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and
[01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:26.060]  freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:30.340]  the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:33.980]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era
[01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:37.820]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:41.940]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:46.820]  have or express or hear and the InfoWars audience has broken through that, that they are the
[01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:51.260]  bridge from the age of founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom
[01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:56.260]  and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the black warming defamation,
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:20:26.100]  and libel targeting youth.
[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:42.740]  But because this tranche of 2,000 documents came out from a lawsuit two days before showing
[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:47.900]  all this British royalty, all these big media heads, all these big top Democrats, all these
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:53.060]  CEOs at Petafile Island matching the manifest that have come out in federal documents that
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:57.620]  Dan Bongino and the Secret Service have warned of saying you better watch it, Hillary don't
[01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:03.140]  poke the bear, we know you and Bill were on that airplane, now it's 27 times for Bill
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:04.140]  alone.
[01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:09.780]  So with that whole waterfront going there, these documents come out on a Friday, I actually
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:14.740]  had the lawyer, Mark Rondaza on my show last Friday, broke the documents, said what was
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:21.980]  in them, next morning he's dead and now it's confirmed, 4chan had it 38 minutes before
[01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:27.980]  that he was dead from hanging, so now there's an investigation of that where 4chan is scooping
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:32.060]  the New York Times, even in New York City, so the whole thing stinks to I haven't and
[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:33.060]  then it gets worse.
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:36.420]  But that's not all that odd, I mean people online tend to be faster than most mainstream
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:40.580]  news nowadays, you've gotten scoops, we've gotten scoops accidentally, so I don't know
[01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:44.140]  that that means foul play, it just means that the New York Times sucks at their job.
[01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:47.700]  Oh sure, I wasn't saying that was a foul play, I'm just saying it shows the breakdown of
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:48.700]  the system.
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:54.340]  Again, if you look at all the defaults, and there's a whole bunch of them, I was talking
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:58.460]  to a constitutional lawyer and criminal and defense lawyer, Robert Barnes to Sheshka about
[01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:03.900]  this, and if you go through all, there's more than 15 things that are defaults that
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:08.780]  are done with a high profile person or a suicidal person like we were told, that were all turned
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:14.180]  off, all the defaults, and then he told friends they're trying to kill me, this is mainstream
[01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:17.980]  news, he told people over the telephone, they're trying to kill me, you gotta get me out of
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:22.700]  here, they're gonna kill me, I'm not gonna commit suicide, I didn't try to commit suicide,
[01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:30.020]  I was attacked in my jail cell, and so now he's dead, now regardless, it gets worse
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:31.660]  Stephen, and jumping at any time, there's just so much.
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.220]  I do have a question, because this is one thing, first off I've not heard all the things
[01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:38.860]  that you're discussing, we've talked about sort of the five irrefutable facts yesterday,
[01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:43.260]  we uploaded it to YouTube, and yes, of course, documents released Friday, dead on a Saturday,
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:46.420]  pedophile island, the guy got off, if you look at the overtime that was paid for some
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:50.220]  of these guards that is first stint in prison, was paid by Epstein himself, there's a paper
[01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:55.060]  trilogy that is really bad, that being said, one thing I have not been able to find, and
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:23:00.100]  someone can correct, you probably know this, was he in solitary confinement?
[01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:01.100]  Was he supposed to be?
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:05.220]  It seems like that would be very pertinent information, and I can't find the specifics
[01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:06.220]  anywhere.
[01:23:06.220 --> 01:23:09.380]  Yes, I mean if I was able to pull up my phone here, I could dig that out, because I've been
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:13.940]  following this very closely, first he was a high profile guy, so they put him in A,
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:17.140]  they don't call it solitary confinement there, but they call it protective custody, so he's
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:22.900]  put in a cell, then he gets put with another person who's reportedly quite a big bull,
[01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:30.580]  and this guy is what's being said, there's different reports basically hurting, and then
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:35.540]  he was put on suicide watch because they tried to imply they tried to commit suicide, though
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:40.460]  he told friends and family that that was not the case, and then he was by himself in a
[01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:45.620]  jail cell, which you're again not supposed to be if you're on suicide watch, because
[01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:50.900]  that increases it, but then they took him out of the suicide watch area, and put him
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:56.260]  into another cell by himself, and so we're not sure if he had the regular covers and
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:00.460]  things that are actually made where you could hang yourself, when the people on suicide
[01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:04.140]  watch have the type that are like paper where you can't kill yourself.
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:08.420]  Right, and I think something that's very relevant is, you know listen, intent really
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:12.180]  matters here, and it would be interesting to see how much information we have regarding
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:17.260]  Epstein, was his sentiment there, was he enthusiastic about bringing other people down on this ring,
[01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:22.060]  saying listen, I'm gonna burn this whole ship down with me, or was he a guy who seemed as
[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:26.340]  though he was hopeless, defeated, and wanted to check out, because if it's the former,
[01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:30.100]  the guy wouldn't commit suicide if you placed a razor blade in his cell because he has a
[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:33.300]  mission to accomplish, if it's the latter it's totally reasonable, and everything that
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:38.140]  I've read seems to insinuate that he wasn't looking to kill himself, but I understand
[01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:41.300]  that a lot of that is conjecture.
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:44.860]  Well what Friends and Family have said in a bunch of news articles, there's actual quotes,
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:48.820]  but the media lies so much, you're right, who knows what's true, it is kind of conjecture,
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:54.180]  in the fake news era of the mainstream media, but they said that he was looking forward
[01:24:54.180 --> 01:24:59.500]  to things, he was settling into life, he was happy, and then they spun that and said,
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:03.060]  oh well he fooled him to put him in an area where he could kill himself, but the information
[01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:10.020]  from CBS News and others, that no, the camera was turned off, and that the jail guards go
[01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:13.580]  in, one of the jail guards had never worked there before, and then they heard howling
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:18.940]  and screaming and begging, and them saying, breathe, Jeffrey Epstein breathe, you can breathe,
[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:24.940]  come on, the whole thing is just over the top bizarre, but here's what's even crazier.
[01:25:24.940 --> 01:25:29.900]  It's confirmed that in the last few weeks, all these people pulled boats up to the little
[01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:34.980]  petafile island, and that they flew the drones around his house, and got video of all these
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:40.740]  Apple computers and hard drives and things in the windows, and shots of binoculars and
[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:43.460]  printers, and you know, because people when they're doing computer work want to look out
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:46.420]  on the ocean, like I'm doing right now.
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:51.780]  Days before the FBI raided it a few days ago, all of that got pulled, because people were
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:56.620]  droning it every day, so three days before the FBI raids, someone goes in and pulls
[01:25:56.620 --> 01:26:01.940]  all the computers and equipment that can be seen through the windows out of the house.
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:04.540]  So who knew the FBI was coming, and who did that?
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:07.020]  That is another huge area that needs to be investigated.
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:10.660]  Wow, that is pretty, now is that something, is there like a before and after picture that
[01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.060]  people can see?
[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:13.060]  There absolutely.
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:18.020]  There is a before and after infowars.com and newswars.com, where some of the first to break
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:23.300]  it, drugs report, link to our article, but it's now out there, and have been pretty big,
[01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:27.500]  and so you can just pull up those articles for yourself.
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:31.660]  Yeah, because one thing I noticed was a sort of, I guess, for lack of a better word, temple
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:35.060]  on his island that people saw, I did notice that when you watched, you saw some more recent
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:38.700]  drone footage, a lot of the pic and iconography had been removed from it, as opposed to if
[01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:42.220]  you look at the older ones, and I want to say, was it like a, was it Poseidon, or was
[01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:45.940]  it Medusa, and then there were these two animal figures, and they were gone in the more recent
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:46.940]  ones.
[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:50.580]  You still see that optical illusion of the recessed door, and it's hard, and this is
[01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:54.180]  what I do, right, for a living-ish, I mean, more of a comedian, but I'm going, okay, hold
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:58.580]  on a second, is there a timeline here as to when this changed, and it seems very difficult
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.580]  to find a lot of this info?
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:05.940]  Exactly, and that's what we're saying, is that the timeline of the dome being removed,
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:13.020]  and then the creatures of mythology on top and below, and they went, oh, a hurricane
[01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:16.860]  did that, but then folks checked the timeline of the last hurricane, no, in fact, a lot
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:22.220]  of this is recent, and so yes, the place is being torn apart, the FBI had people with
[01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:27.380]  snorkels out in the water looking, but then, when you pull back Big Picture, Jeffrey Epstein
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:33.820]  was a concierge, he was a pimp, he was a handler, we've tracked his whole history, but the reason
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:39.180]  this is so important is, it's like a string on a sweater, you pull that string out on
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:46.820]  that sweater, and the whole thing can unravel, so if you'd like, I can tell folks, as specifically
[01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:52.980]  or not as specifically as you would like, because even Mark Rondaza, who's been my lawyer
[01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:57.540]  off and on, you know, the student got this, he's been on my show, and he doesn't even
[01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:02.780]  like to read the documents on air, even though it's from lawsuits, from federal documents,
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:07.100]  it matches up with flight manifestos and other witnesses, but it names a lot of names, and
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:11.260]  so I think instead of just even naming names, perhaps we should just get into what eyewitnesses
[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:16.300]  said is inside the temple, and then other temples around the world, and the Big Picture.
[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:20.380]  Yeah, absolutely, let's do that, and we released some of this info yesterday, like the flight
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:24.100]  manifest, and obviously, I mean, you're not naming names, we mentioned Bill Clinton, and
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:28.980]  Prince Andrew, and people like that, I remember what was written was a Kevin Spacey, and
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:29.980]  Matt Groening.
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:31.980]  Governor Bill Richardson, but it's a lot of other pictures.
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:34.900]  That surprised me, Governor Bill Richardson, because I just thought of him as sort of an
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:38.660]  inconsequential governor who, you know, wasn't really a part of the elite, because no one
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:42.700]  really liked him.
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:50.180]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:58.700]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:02.620]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:04.180]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:07.140]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:10.380]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:12.620]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:12.620 --> 01:29:13.940]  I can help you too.

[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:04.620]  that you've kept us in the game.
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:07.700]  I mean, I want to stay in this game, I want to take the globalist on.
[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:09.460]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:13.540]  Vibrating in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:14.540]  stuff up that much.
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:17.620]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:21.940]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things
[01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:26.060]  like DNA Force Plus, but ultimate krill oil has been sold out for four months.
[01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:28.660]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:32.900]  It's totally full of the bottle, and it is the strongest, purest krill oil, and it cost
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:37.740]  us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:39.300]  remove mercury.
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:43.060]  Any kind of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:44.900]  gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:47.380]  It's been boiled, it's been rillined, it's been homogenized.
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:48.380]  This is not good.
[01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:53.020]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're going to find anywhere.
[01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:56.180]  Real krill oil folks is red, it's not yellow, it's not milky.
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:58.700]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:05.220]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:10.260]  are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:14.020]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:20.920]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:24.100]  to stay strong when the system fails.
[01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:30.140]  The system is vulnerable, electricity could be gone in an instant, and grocery stores
[01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:32.660]  could be empty in three days.

[01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:45.340]  slave to a dying system.

[01:31:58.420 --> 01:32:04.380]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:08.780]  in the future, it would be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality,
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:11.700]  who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:16.860]  And today the communist Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago, and we've
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:21.340]  seen massive increases in polls to support for the president, and what he's doing in
[01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:25.260]  this trade war, once China put pressure on our farmers.
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:26.700]  That's beautiful.
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:29.780]  These aren't going to be bullied, and we aren't going to back down.
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:33.820]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's, the world that want to intimidate
[01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:38.020]  people, and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up, and all you've done is
[01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:43.220]  awaken the human spirit, and the human spirit lives at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com.
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:48.500]  And I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links, because we are the light
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:33:01.980]  of the dark of the night, we are the resistance, we are 1776 worldwide.
[01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:30.660]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:36.900]  Well everybody saw Jeffrey Epstein's death in jail coming, the victims, the lawyers
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:41.580]  of the victims, anyone in media worked their salt.
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:42.580]  And then what happened?
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:49.340]  Jeffrey Epstein found dead in prison cell apparent suicide, but the forensic analysis
[01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:51.500]  has come out.
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:59.980]  Broken bones in Epstein's neck indicate estrangulation would be the cause of death.
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:04.820]  So now all of a sudden this opens up a whole new can of worms, a whole new can of questioning,
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:09.980]  and you have to wonder how Jeffrey Epstein was able to be strangled and murdered in
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:18.020]  jail in a correctional facility with video surveillance that goes haywire, with guards
[01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:23.100]  that are apparently sleeping, with paperwork that apparently they didn't do, with other
[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:26.900]  people present that apparently heard him struggling.
[01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:31.660]  But the mainstream media is right there to tell you what, don't question anything.
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:35.220]  And if you do question the official narrative of Epstein's suicide, well you're a conspiracy
[01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:40.060]  theorist and well if you're a conspiracy theorist now, they say you're a domestic terrorist.
[01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:45.020]  So Epstein committed suicide even though the evidence says broken bones in the neck, he
[01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:46.300]  was strangled to death.
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.660]  Here's Alex Jones with Stephen Crowder.
[01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:52.700]  So before we get into the specifics, do you think there's a connection, because we do
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:55.900]  have to be honest about this full disclosure with President Donald Trump, do you think
[01:34:55.900 --> 01:35:00.260]  there's a connection with President Trump beyond what we already know that they were
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:04.460]  friends a long time ago when he kicked him out of Mar-a-Lago, I think in 2011?
[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:06.580]  Is there anything else going on there?
[01:35:06.580 --> 01:35:14.380]  I would, here's the bottom line, I already vetted Trump early on and if he had any connection
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:19.820]  to pedophilia or any connection to child trafficking that the Clintons just have all around them.
[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:24.340]  I mean it's not just Epstein, you can't swing a stick in the dark and not run into, you
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:29.660]  know this head of her foundation convicted of smuggling kids out of Haiti and now she
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:36.500]  runs this major child group and Obama opening the borders up and saying let kids come across
[01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:40.900]  unattended and then the Senate report admits thousands ended up in sex slavery, hundreds
[01:35:40.900 --> 01:35:46.100]  dead, Washington Post, I mean that's what's so frustrating here is Stephen, I love to
[01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:52.620]  say this is something I broke, this is something that vindicates me, I'm so cool, I'm so incredible,
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:57.900]  it's like breaking that this pen in my hand is orange, this has been very well known for
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:03.100]  decades, it's been all over the British news for decades about Prince Andrew and the Royals
[01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:08.820]  and how they compromised people using this and so Epstein and the Clintons is just a
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:14.540]  tentacle and an extension of this, so here's what I did to research Trump, should I saw
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:19.580]  him get big, I always thought he was annoying, I'm not into casinos, I'm not into bling but
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:24.300]  I get that's his advertising but as soon as I saw, I liked what he was saying on the stage,
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:30.300]  I went into research mode and I read Roger Stone's War on Women, Roger Stone's book
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:34.380]  Clintons, War on Women and I already knew most of that about the Clintons so I thought
[01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:38.060]  okay this is really accurate so then I went and researched a lot of the Epstein stuff in
[01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:43.540]  there that I already knew was true, there was no Trump connection, Trump met, was probably
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:47.900]  with him at 10 or 15 parties while they lived in the same towns, he was a member of the
[01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:53.020]  club, Trump did throw him out and it turns out told people, it was on record for hitting
[01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:57.740]  on a 11 year old girl and just being a creepy person that people were complaining about
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:37:02.780]  and Trump's heart was hardly ever even there and so the media always tries to divert it
[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:09.140]  off onto Trump like oh Donald Trump's best friend Jeffrey Epstein, there's nothing there
[01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:14.220]  but when you look at the Clintons, it is just incredible what's there and it goes back to
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:21.180]  27 different flights over six visits as I remember if I'm not, if memory serves me correctly.
[01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:25.500]  Yes and they were on a lot of other jets together to well-known sultans that are pedophiles
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:30.700]  in the Middle East and if you get into the spirit cooking, the real WikiLeaks stuff,
[01:37:30.700 --> 01:37:35.180]  not the fake pizza gate stuff that the media created and got people to divert it off onto
[01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:40.260]  and then blamed on me, the real spirit cooking stuff, real Aleister Crowley stuff so here's
[01:37:40.260 --> 01:37:42.820]  the best place to start.
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:48.500]  You rightfully explained that most people get recruited by evil because it's a hot secretary
[01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:53.300]  or a hot, you know, woman and that's actually how most Satanists recruit people and really
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:38:00.820]  all Satanists are is 3,000 year old private intelligence agencies going back to the Middle
[01:38:00.820 --> 01:38:06.180]  East where this got written about in scrolls who learn to recruit righteous people with
[01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:12.780]  slow corruption, first have sex with somebody else's wife, then be corrupt on your taxes
[01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:16.820]  and that's how it begins but the way it's been described to me and it's in history books
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:22.420]  as well is it circles of corruption so at the center of the circle, I don't know if
[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:23.420]  you can see that.
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:24.420]  Yeah, I can see it.
[01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:27.100]  But at the center, it looks kind of like an everlasting gobstopper when you cut it in
[01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:28.100]  half.
[01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:29.100]  Yes, exactly.
[01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:33.260]  At the center, you've got really evil control freaks that want to manipulate and control
[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:37.380]  everybody else because they have all the information, they know where the bodies are buried and
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:41.820]  then they have people outside of them that they have dirt on, who they control, who go
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:47.260]  out and work for them, just like a mafia, but then they get power and then they go out
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:54.180]  and manipulate people on the outside ring of that and so it's like any cult, any cult
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:58.260]  operates, they just expand out from there so you've got Jeffrey Epstein is in the second
[01:38:58.260 --> 01:38:59.260]  ring here.
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:03.020]  He's not in the ring with the royalty and the Clintons and all the rest of them.
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:07.360]  I'd say the Clintons got into that final little center area and you've got all the minions
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:11.820]  out here that kind of know what's going on, but they just turned a blind eye to kids.
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:14.540]  They turned a blind eye to cocaine being shipped in, blah, blah, blah.
[01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:18.620]  But you see, just like the Mexican mafia will make you go kill a liquor store owner or a
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:22.700]  rival member of the gang to be in their mafia or the crypts will make you go kill somebody
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:28.220]  in the in the bloods or in La Cosa Nostra, you've got to kill at least three or four
[01:39:28.220 --> 01:39:32.780]  people and you've got to carry out a bunch of other crimes so they have all the dirt
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:34.900]  on you so they can burn you anytime they want.
[01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:37.860]  Well, they found that people don't care if you've killed somebody or two year on your
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:43.060]  wife's last 50 years, but what they'll really get you for is sex with kids.
[01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:49.300]  And so people know that you have to have sex with first underage people, then you've got
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:53.660]  to have sex with people that are even younger until you finally go wear a mask at a satanic
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:59.780]  ritual and they will usually bring a high end hooker there and they will poison her
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:03.940]  and they'll say, okay, she's dead, we've got to cover this up, you were all involved.
[01:40:03.940 --> 01:40:07.220]  The next level is actually usually shooting somebody.
[01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:10.540]  They'll bring somebody in, say this guy's a criminal, you go up and you shoot him.
[01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:15.740]  You're like, wait a minute, that's in the first born movie where after he's in mind
[01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:19.460]  control he goes and kills the other soldier that failed.
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:25.260]  This is all CIA mind control, ancient mind control, ancient secret societies are just
[01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:27.580]  what we call modern intelligence agencies.
[01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:32.340]  To look at the circle, another way to look at it is what they see it as.
[01:40:32.340 --> 01:40:39.260]  It's a pyramid, okay, and you've got the group at the top that has the knowledge, everybody
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:42.460]  else below it has less and less knowledge.
[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:47.500]  All I did was study history and how these groups actually operate to try to take people
[01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:49.260]  to the top of the pyramid.
[01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:56.060]  And so now that they're externalizing all of these methods to corrupt the general public
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:41:01.780]  because they're now going from their cult level, getting control to their final phase
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:06.220]  where they try to take full societal cultural control and that's when these cults, from
[01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:13.100]  the Aztecs to the ancient Babylonians to the ancient Assyrians to the every ancient culture,
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:19.620]  the Druids, the Visigoths, the Austro-Goths, all went through periods where they would
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:25.580]  go into a decadent cycle where finally the priest class would emerge with the human sacrifice,
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:30.020]  emerged with the killing of the virgins, that's children, and externalize it and get the entire
[01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:32.020]  tribe to accept it.
[01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:36.940]  So, are you saying you think that Epstein would have been involved with actual human
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:38.940]  sacrifices at Satanic rituals?
[01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:39.940]  Absolutely.
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:44.060]  And that's what's now coming out, I've been saying this for 10 years, because we knew
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:45.780]  about the islands, we knew about it all.
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:50.780]  They had underground dungeons, underground passages, all the locals that built it said
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:51.780]  this.
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:58.460]  The boats would pull up at night, not just with high-end girls that were 16 down to 12
[01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:02.340]  that kind of knew what they were doing or their families had sold into this, because
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:06.380]  Epstein, again, would go to Romania, Hungary, and actually buy girls, that's now confirmed,
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:09.940]  who were 12 years old, train them and use them as sex ops.
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:16.340]  But we're talking about poor kids from the Caribbean being brought in on boats at night,
[01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:21.260]  and see that's the final level of the top of the pyramid is that just like the crypts
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:25.940]  or the bloods want you to kill somebody, the final level of the pyramid in this is killing
[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:26.940]  children.
[01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:31.780]  And it just came out in Italian newspapers two days ago that other rich elites are getting
[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:38.300]  busted on islands off the coast of Italy, where they're doing ritual murder, orgy, first
[01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:39.300]  is sex orgy.
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:44.500]  First you go to the island and you have sex with a bunch of hot hookers, then it's a 16-year-old,
[01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:49.940]  then it's a 14-year-old, then it's a 12-year-old, then, oh, this person's talking, we're going
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:58.020]  to have to kill him, you're involved, you're going to have to help us dispose of the body.
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:02.620]  Without your support, we won't be here, and I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:03.620]  that you've kept us in the game.
[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:06.660]  I mean, I want to stay in this game, I want to take the globalist on.
[01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:08.420]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:12.340]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't
[01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:13.500]  mark stuff up that much.
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:16.540]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:19.900]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste.
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:24.020]  We've got great things like DNA Force Plus, but ultimate krill oil has been sold out for
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:25.020]  four months.
[01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:27.620]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:32.860]  It's totally full of oil, and it is the strongest, purest krill oil, and it cost us three times
[01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:38.260]  more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:42.020]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:43.940]  gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:46.300]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:47.300]  This has not been.
[01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:51.980]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:56.260]  Real krill oil folks is red, it's not yellow, it's not milky, this is nothing but krill
[01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:57.260]  oil.
[01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:01.540]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful
[01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:04.100]  products ever made, Alpha Power.

[01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:40.300]  To make real the actions of independent free speech.
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:44.740]  To make real the original promise of an independent free press, real collusion is big tech and
[01:45:44.740 --> 01:45:48.860]  big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to
[01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:52.340]  try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:53.340]  not happening.
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:54.780]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.

[01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:08.500]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:31.220]  Well one little birdie won't be chirping, that's Jeffrey Epstein, no, autopsy now reveals
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:39.220]  he had broken vertebrae, which means he was strangled to death.
[01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:46.700]  Oh, but don't you worry because cable news will be sure to tell you nothing to see here.
[01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:51.620]  Just a suicide, just another suicide.
[01:47:51.620 --> 01:48:00.100]  Really amazing, but I think this is a major opportunity to show people just how, I mean
[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:04.220]  what do you, how do you even explain it's corrupt the world is, how much power a shadow
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:12.340]  government has a secret society, I mean who could pull this off, I mean reasonably and
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:15.260]  logically think about this.
[01:48:15.260 --> 01:48:18.780]  How could this have happened, somebody had to pay people off right, somebody had to blackmail
[01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:25.820]  people in the facility right, I mean what is going on here, will we ever get answers.
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:34.420]  But how about this though, can I get a doc cam please or just pull this up in HD.
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:43.860]  They remove a portrait from Jeffrey Epstein's mansion or was it on the island, I think it
[01:48:43.860 --> 01:48:44.860]  was on the island.
[01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:51.100]  Either way, Epstein had a portrait of Bill Clinton in a blue dress, one that I think
[01:48:51.100 --> 01:48:57.100]  people are claiming Hillary Clinton war because there's pictures of her in a similar dress
[01:48:57.100 --> 01:49:04.900]  and then red high heels on, now red high heels may or may not have some sort of symbolism
[01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:10.900]  for some sort of sexual perversion, I don't know why else you would be putting the red
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:20.220]  heels on Bill and then of course the blue dress and it's in the Oval Office.
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:27.820]  This is the clown world ladies and gentlemen right here.
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:33.580]  This is what we're dealing with, Jeffrey Epstein having a portrait of Bill Clinton in the Oval
[01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:37.780]  Office in a blue dress and red heels.
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:47.500]  What in the hell do you think that is?
[01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:56.980]  So the whole world is watching the Epstein cover up happen, but the story will not die
[01:49:56.980 --> 01:50:10.020]  with Epstein as the victims now look at Maxwell Epstein's procurer, although she walks free
[01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:18.540]  and is living in her sprawling mansion just outside of Boston, Massachusetts, tough life
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:26.940]  being a sex slave procurer for Jeffrey Epstein and how is she still alive?
[01:50:26.940 --> 01:50:33.540]  She's not even in a jail in a facility that has guards and video surveillance and how
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:34.700]  is she still alive?
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:44.220]  She knows everything that Epstein knows, hmm, a lot of questions, not a lot of answers,
[01:50:44.220 --> 01:50:49.300]  but one portrait of Bill Clinton in the Oval Office in a blue dress and red heels.
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:55.260]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:51:00.220]  The symbolism is everywhere ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:04.380]  Open your eyes and see it.
[01:51:04.380 --> 01:51:07.700]  They're flaunting it right in front of your face.
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:08.820]  You know, that's really what this is.
[01:51:08.820 --> 01:51:13.100]  This is a total flex on the American people.
[01:51:13.100 --> 01:51:23.700]  We're going to have murdered the biggest witness to one of the biggest underground child sex
[01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:27.660]  rings to ever be exposed.
[01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:32.540]  We're so powerful, we operate in the shadows, we're so untouchable, we're going to murder
[01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:37.420]  him right in front of your eyes and then we're so powerful and in control of the media they're
[01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:51.500]  going to tell you it was suicide and then they'll demonize you if you ever question it.
[01:51:51.500 --> 01:52:01.540]  Some things just become a little mundane and trivial when you realize what is actually
[01:52:01.540 --> 01:52:04.460]  going on out there.
[01:52:04.460 --> 01:52:12.260]  Now, there is some other news, economic news, cultural news, I'm going to get to all of
[01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:13.260]  it.
[01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:16.260]  Gerald Salenti is going to be joining me in the third hour.
[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:22.300]  He predicted a recession and then there were the bad yields in the stock market yesterday,
[01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:31.100]  but it has made a recovery somewhat today, still over 25 on the Dow.
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:36.500]  I just wonder if this Epstein story is ever going to die.
[01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:47.500]  Clearly murdered, clearly a cover up, clearly trying to stop an industrial level sex slave
[01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:57.260]  pedophile ring from being exposed and bringing down powerful names and royalty.
[01:52:57.260 --> 01:53:10.060]  Now, meanwhile, you've got Chinese troops gathering inside a sports stadium near the
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:13.700]  Hong Kong border, images are coming out.
[01:53:13.700 --> 01:53:19.340]  So China is getting ready to invade Hong Kong, they've been thinking about invading Taiwan,
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:28.420]  they're building these islands in the South China Sea, and it's only getting worse in
[01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:34.900]  Hong Kong, it's only going to get worse unless the Chinese pull back, but all signs indicate
[01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:38.900]  the exact opposite, they're going in even harder.
[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:46.300]  Now, are you going to see a Tiananmen square like situation in Hong Kong now?
[01:53:46.300 --> 01:53:48.140]  What is going to happen?
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:54.260]  China is trying to remain neutral on it, despite the tough trade talk, which you think people
[01:53:54.260 --> 01:54:01.620]  would appreciate somebody who's not trying to save a catalyst into a war, wants to meet
[01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:06.060]  with President Xi, but you notice how every time there's some sort of thing like this
[01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:10.060]  and it's all making more sense to me now with North Korea, anytime there's some sort of
[01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:16.060]  struggle with China and either Western Allied forces or even in their own region, North
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:18.940]  Korea just fires off a missile or fires off a nuke.
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:23.580]  North Korea is the Chinese junkyard dog.
[01:54:23.580 --> 01:54:27.860]  I think Kim Jong-un actually really likes President Trump and gets along well with President
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:36.460]  Trump who is engaging in world diplomacy, but you see, when China and the United States
[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:42.020]  start sparring, North Korea needs to fire off a missile to make Trump look weak.
[01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:46.220]  You see, that's how that works.
[01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:52.900]  And then they use that in the media to make Trump look weak and then China puffs out their
[01:54:52.900 --> 01:55:01.820]  chest because Trump knows full well that this is how it goes on, but it's all about optics.
[01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:05.500]  And meanwhile, because the whole world is changing right now, you had Boris Johnson
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:09.020]  get elected who promised Brexit by October.
[01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:18.540]  Well, now the opposition party has come out and said with Jeremy Corbyn, they are going
[01:55:18.540 --> 01:55:23.180]  to stop the Brexit.
[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:28.700]  So you know, it's just like, okay, the people want to get out of the EU.
[01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:29.700]  What should we do?
[01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:33.020]  Well, let's have a vote and we'll see.
[01:55:33.020 --> 01:55:34.020]  They vote.
[01:55:34.020 --> 01:55:35.020]  Okay.
[01:55:35.020 --> 01:55:36.460]  They voted to leave the EU.
[01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:38.620]  Well, we didn't actually want that to happen.
[01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:40.700]  So we're going to stay in the EU.
[01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:42.260]  They have a referendum vote again.
[01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:43.260]  Leave the EU.
[01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:44.740]  Well, we'll start working on plans.
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:46.820]  Maybe someday we'll get out, but probably not.
[01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:47.820]  They have another vote.
[01:55:47.820 --> 01:55:51.900]  They vote Boris Johnson in because he's a Brexit party guy.
[01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:53.660]  So he says, hey, we're going to get out of Brexit.
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:55.500]  You guys voted for it 500 times.
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:56.500]  Everybody wants it.
[01:55:56.500 --> 01:55:58.180]  We're going to be out of Brexit by October.
[01:55:58.180 --> 01:55:59.180]  And then what happened?
[01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:02.780]  The old guard, the old establishment comes back and says, nope.
[01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:15.980]  You voted three times to leave the European Union were not going to let you total tiering.
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:21.060]  So but this is what's happening right now as the new world order is collapsing and the
[01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:28.700]  fight for the new new world order is happening right now.
[01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:33.660]  And at least we have a president that doesn't want to see America go the way of the dodo
[01:56:33.660 --> 01:56:40.060]  bird as the new new world order emerges from the ashes of the old.
[01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:42.380]  And hopefully it's not literal ashes.
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:46.520]  But let me tell you, people are predicting a recession.
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:51.700]  People are afraid that a larger conflict of war could break out.
[01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:55.620]  And you'd hate to be in a situation like Russia where they have to stockpile on iodine right
[01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:59.420]  now because they just had another nuclear disaster that they're trying to get under control.
[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:04.000]  But you know, we have emergency food supplies for situations like this.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.500]  We sell them at info or store.com.
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:06.980]  They're discounted right now.
[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:12.460]  We have nascent iodine, which is great is why Russia is loading up on nascent iodine
[01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:15.700]  fights radiation, nuclear radiation specifically.
[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:19.940]  So if you're working on a bug out bag, you're afraid of these events happening.
[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:20.940]  We can help you.
[01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:25.340]  We in fact, we have a whole section of survival here at info or store.com.
[01:57:25.340 --> 01:57:28.780]  The emergency food is on sale.
[01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:36.420]  And we've also got nascent iodine that is on sale info or store.com shopping info or
[01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:47.300]  store.com today to keep info wars on the air tomorrow.
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:53.100]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[01:57:53.100 --> 01:57:57.540]  in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who
[01:57:57.540 --> 01:58:00.420]  actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:05.140]  And today the communist Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago.
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:09.940]  And we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's doing
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:13.980]  in this trade war once China put pressure on our farmers.
[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:15.420]  That's beautiful.
[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:18.460]  Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down.
[01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:23.180]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the world that want to intimidate
[01:58:23.180 --> 01:58:27.260]  people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up and all you've done is awaken
[01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:28.260]  the human spirit.
[01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:34.500]  The human spirit lives at info wars.com and news wars.com and I'm asking listeners, whatever

[02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:42.140]  What is on the audience's mind today before Gerald Salenty joins us?

[02:00:48.300 --> 02:00:55.420]  Again, is the Epstein cover up still on your mind?
[02:00:55.420 --> 02:01:00.220]  Hong Kong with China, Google rigging elections.
[02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:01.420]  What's on the audience's mind today?
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:12.700]  We'll take your calls 877-789-ALEX but first, this video is going viral on Twitter and to
[02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:25.780]  me it's basically just an encapsulated snapshot of what's happening to children right now
[02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:29.980]  and what pop culture is doing and we sit here and we point fingers at everybody and everything
[02:01:29.980 --> 02:01:36.420]  and we forget that as a society we're decaying, as a society we're degenerating, as a society
[02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:43.700]  we're worshiping sex and drugs and violence and not modesty and honesty and integrity
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:46.060]  and so what do you get?
[02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:54.620]  You get a toddler which starts off seeming like an innocent dance routine, ends up twerking
[02:01:54.620 --> 02:02:01.860]  like Miley Cyrus on a wrecking ball.
[02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:08.860]  So just dancing, just a older gentleman dancing with a little girl probably like 5, normal
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:14.140]  dance routine and then all of a sudden she literally gets on all fours, sticks her butt
[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:19.020]  in the air and starts shaking it and the guy is appalled, he literally is like what am
[02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:20.020]  I seeing?
[02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:23.700]  This is disgusting, honestly I'm sick right now even having to do commentary and show
[02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:32.280]  this to you, I'm sick.
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:34.060]  So what happens?
[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:38.300]  Your kid logs into Snapchat, your kid logs onto MTV, your kid logs onto Twitter and what
[02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:39.300]  do they see?
[02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:46.380]  Cardi B sticking her butt in the air, shaking it and then little girls mimic that and you
[02:02:46.380 --> 02:02:52.460]  want to talk about innocence being lost, you want to talk about modesty being lost?
[02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:57.340]  When you're endorsing that for children, where do you think their head is going to go when
[02:02:57.340 --> 02:03:03.900]  they're actually reaching the age where sex is becoming a thought in their mind?
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:05.900]  Where do you think they're going to go then?
[02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:11.340]  Not only do you have it in music videos getting pushed with pop culture, Drag Queen Storytime
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:15.660]  just last week we had the video where they had the Drag Queen Storytime at the public
[02:03:15.660 --> 02:03:22.700]  library and the Drag Queen is teaching the kids how to twerk.
[02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:26.820]  What in the hell is that?
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:31.020]  So here's where they want, so this is where culture goes, if good people don't stand up,
[02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:35.900]  if Christians don't stand up, if God fearing people don't stand up, if Bible readers don't
[02:03:35.900 --> 02:03:44.100]  stand up, if just modest people don't stand up.
[02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:50.140]  You have Cardi B endorsing Bernie Sanders in one of the dumbest political interviews
[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:55.620]  you've ever seen, but it's actually like, oh this is legit, like this is real, oh Cardi
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:04:01.300]  B with Bernie Sanders, like yay, this is politics now.
[02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:11.140]  And then your kid dancing to music at home, your young girl is going to get on all fours
[02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:17.380]  like she's in a Diplo video and twerk.
[02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:22.420]  And this is pop culture now, this is what's cool, this is what's trendy, this is what
[02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:28.260]  is promoted, this is what's considered cool.
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:36.660]  I don't think so, it's not cool to me, fact makes me sick, but what is it really?
[02:04:36.660 --> 02:04:43.740]  It's all fake, ladies and gentlemen, just like a man dressed up as a woman, that's no woman,
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:48.300]  that's a man man, it's all fake.
[02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:53.620]  And then they give children, like this is the real world that you'll never really reach
[02:04:53.620 --> 02:05:23.140]  your experience and then they end up depressed.
[02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:27.700]  So now it is a revolutionary act at the time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying
[02:05:27.700 --> 02:05:33.340]  to wear the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag, and particularly
[02:05:33.340 --> 02:05:39.220]  when it says on the back, right there ladies and gentlemen, americasbackinfowars.com.
[02:05:39.220 --> 02:05:43.660]  So whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies
[02:05:43.660 --> 02:05:47.980]  face all over, not just the US, but worldwide, because more than ever, the American flag
[02:05:47.980 --> 02:06:14.380]  is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[01:49:30.920 --> 02:06:41.100]  what are you going to do when you see that horizon that you've been fighting
[02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:43.940]  to get to?
[02:06:43.940 --> 02:06:49.060]  Your entire existence, are you going to stop and stare, are you going to turn around and
[02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:59.820]  retreat, or are you going to go forward until you have accomplished, achieved your manifest
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:05.820]  destiny, because that's where we're at right now.
[02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:14.420]  Freedom has been fully exposed, literal pedophile sex slave networks have been fully exposed,
[02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:18.700]  treason at the upper echelons of the United States government have been fully exposed,
[02:07:18.700 --> 02:07:24.780]  and it's all happened in the last three years.
[02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:27.020]  So where do we go from here?
[02:07:27.020 --> 02:07:31.420]  Do we lay our sword and shield down?
[02:07:31.420 --> 02:07:46.220]  Do we retreat and claim victory, or do we press forward through that dark, cold night,
[02:07:46.220 --> 02:07:51.540]  because we see the horizon, because that's where this goes, I mean, it's only going to
[02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:58.140]  get worse before it gets better, but man, when you see a portrait of Bill Clinton in
[02:07:58.140 --> 02:08:02.540]  red heels and a blue dress, folks, you know what's going on.
[02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:03.740]  And it's depraved stuff.
[02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:07.300]  And it's what we've been talking about in info wars for a long time, and it's all coming
[02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:11.180]  out.
[02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:15.620]  And the old world order known as the new world order is collapsing.
[02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:18.500]  What comes out on the other side of it is determined in the fight now.
[02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:22.780]  Now, I want to go to your phone lines to hear your take on all this with the audience.
[02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:26.260]  But again, folks, they try to shut info wars down.
[02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:27.980]  They try to ban us off the internet.
[02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:30.380]  They try to demonize us in the media.
[02:08:30.380 --> 02:08:37.220]  They try to hurt us financially with all the lawsuits and legal warfare that we have to
[02:08:37.220 --> 02:08:38.220]  deal with here.
[02:08:38.220 --> 02:08:43.860]  But thanks to this audience, we're still able to exist.
[02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:45.140]  We're still able to persist.
[02:08:45.140 --> 02:08:47.540]  We're still able to break ground.
[02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:52.660]  Like today, when we bring on the Google whistleblower first live interview and we get the top link
[02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:55.420]  on Drudge, red linked.
[02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:57.380]  We just changed the world.
[02:08:57.380 --> 02:08:59.940]  You just changed the world.
[02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:02.500]  Now info wars can expand.
[02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:04.900]  And we're trying to expand.
[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:07.620]  And it's not easy around here.
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:10.100]  But we give it our damnedest.
[02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:14.220]  And the good news is the products we sell at info wars store.com are the best.
[02:09:14.220 --> 02:09:16.700]  We have the best water filters at info wars store.com.

[02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:28.820]  I have I have the water filters.
[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:29.820]  I have the air filters.
[02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:35.540]  I take the supplements info wars store.com, ladies and gentlemen, if you haven't started
[02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:38.500]  shopping at info wars store.com, what are you waiting for?
[02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:40.300]  We are in the trenches.
[02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:41.780]  We are having victories.
[02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:51.940]  We are plowing forward, push us forward, fuel our jets so that we can clear the way
[02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:55.540]  to the horizon and the rest of the world can follow behind.
[02:09:55.540 --> 02:10:00.060]  Now we've got callers lined up.
[02:10:00.060 --> 02:10:07.620]  So let's go out to the phone lines and start with, let's start with, let's see, where should
[02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:08.620]  we go here, guys?
[02:10:08.620 --> 02:10:09.980]  Let's go with Floyd in Virginia.
[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:10.980]  Let's just start at the top.
[02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:11.980]  Floyd, go ahead.
[02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:12.980]  Hey, Ellen.
[02:10:12.980 --> 02:10:13.980]  I am.
[02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:23.820]  I've been a long time listener of info wars and a long time buyer of the product.
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:24.820]  Thank you.
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:31.540]  I had so much that I wanted to say until, man, we really start it all, it all ties together
[02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:36.620]  with this Jeffrey Epstein and the Clintons in the deep state.
[02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:42.020]  And I mean, going all the way back, and I hate to even, even mention it, but, you know,
[02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:47.940]  with the fellow that had to, I'm sorry, I got a big storm coming through right now,
[02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:52.060]  but the fellow that right up there was with Trump that had to resign because he didn't
[02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:58.220]  want to implicate Trump into the whole matter, because Trump obviously tried to separate himself
[02:10:58.220 --> 02:11:01.940]  from this whole entire Jeffrey thing.
[02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:05.540]  I mean, I, well, it was President Trump that spurred the whole thing.
[02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:08.660]  Here's what I wish people could, here's what I wish people could comprehend though, Floyd,
[02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:09.660]  and it's not easy.
[02:11:09.660 --> 02:11:11.220]  It's not like I'm mad and upset at people.
[02:11:11.220 --> 02:11:12.220]  It's tough.
[02:11:12.220 --> 02:11:19.500]  Like, for example, you've got a brief eye into the mind of Ben Shapiro and his elitism,
[02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:22.500]  where he trashes people that have two jobs at the same time.
[02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:27.220]  Well, I had parts of life where I had like six jobs at the same time, so okay.
[02:11:27.220 --> 02:11:29.340]  But that's not even the point.
[02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:35.060]  That's just a little, that's just a little look into the mind of an elitist like Ben
[02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:36.340]  Shapiro.
[02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:42.940]  People like Epstein and the Clintons and these Royals that were involved with Epstein, they're
[02:11:42.940 --> 02:11:45.540]  so beyond that we can't even comprehend.
[02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:49.820]  They look at the average human driving on the highway like they look at a cockroach.
[02:11:49.820 --> 02:11:51.820]  You should just be smashed out of existence.
[02:11:51.820 --> 02:11:53.260]  You're just a bother.
[02:11:53.260 --> 02:11:56.460]  So it's like the whole thing with Epstein getting killed in prison.
[02:11:56.460 --> 02:11:58.340]  I just want people to understand.
[02:11:58.340 --> 02:12:04.220]  And I think the hurdle here is that people have, they have their own pride, they have
[02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:12.540]  their own, like, you know, nothing could possibly be better than me type of thing, but like
[02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:13.900]  these people don't give a damn.
[02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:16.540]  They just murdered Jeffrey Epstein right in front of you and lied about it.
[02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:18.580]  They've been talking about a fake Russian collusion.
[02:12:18.580 --> 02:12:23.780]  They lie us into wars that kill hundreds of thousands of people, millions of people.
[02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:24.780]  Okay.
[02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:26.320]  So they don't care about humanity.
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:29.980]  Whoever these people are that had Epstein killed, whoever the people are that lie about
[02:12:29.980 --> 02:12:36.780]  the JFK and cover that up and the CIA and all of it, they're so beyond the average human.
[02:12:36.780 --> 02:12:40.460]  I just wish that the average citizen can understand the power that we're dealing with, the danger
[02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:43.340]  of this and how they're laughing at us right now.
[02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:47.900]  They're laughing at us that they just killed Jeffrey Epstein and there's a damn portrait
[02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:51.980]  of Bill Clinton in a woman's dress wearing red hat, high heels.
[02:12:51.980 --> 02:12:55.500]  These people are laughing at the average citizen and if the average citizen isn't standing
[02:12:55.500 --> 02:13:02.420]  up screaming like what the hell's going on, then they're, that's why they laugh.
[02:13:02.420 --> 02:13:07.260]  They, well, if you even ask the average citizen, you know, anything about some of the, the
[02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:14.020]  hitting of the facts, they've never even heard of it and a lot of the times what you get is
[02:13:14.020 --> 02:13:15.020]  info wars.
[02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:19.060]  Info wars gets you literally like tomorrow's news today, kind of crap.
[02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:23.660]  This is stuff that, that Alex was talking about 10 years or more ago.
[02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:29.300]  And when I talked to friends or relatives about this, they never even, they never even
[02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:34.220]  heard of this guy, Jeffrey Epstein and you let, I knew about the low lead express years
[02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:42.020]  ago because of Alex talking about it back 2008 when he first got up for, you know, having
[02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:44.340]  relations with a 14 year old girl and stuff.
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:45.340]  Yeah.
[02:13:45.340 --> 02:13:48.740]  It's like people are like, how do you do, cause all these TV people, they do three hour
[02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:51.740]  shows or whatever, two hour shows, hour shows, they all, it's all scripted out.
[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:53.260]  It's all a teleprompter.
[02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:57.340]  Most radio shows are scripted out and produced and have, you know, segments planned out and
[02:13:57.340 --> 02:13:58.340]  everything.
[02:13:58.340 --> 02:13:59.860]  But people say, you know, how do you do three hours?
[02:13:59.860 --> 02:14:06.180]  It's like if you had a treasure map to some huge treasure in the mountains, you know the
[02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:07.180]  treasure map.
[02:14:07.180 --> 02:14:08.860]  Like you're not going to forget the treasure map.
[02:14:08.860 --> 02:14:10.620]  Like that's what this is.
[02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:14.100]  Like we're just giving people the treasure map of the information to the treasure that
[02:14:14.100 --> 02:14:17.260]  the media will never tell you that has been hidden for so long.
[02:14:17.260 --> 02:14:18.620]  Thanks for the call, Floyd.
[02:14:18.620 --> 02:14:20.060]  Let's go to Lyle in Idaho.
[02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:22.060]  Go ahead, Lyle.
[02:14:22.060 --> 02:14:25.420]  Hey, yeah.
[02:14:25.420 --> 02:14:32.340]  I just wanted to kind of echo a sentiment that you expressed a couple of days ago concerning
[02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:41.340]  William Barr and how he handled all of this lack of security surrounding such a high value
[02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:50.980]  asset or whatever you want to call this guy Epstein in terms of what he knew and the lack
[02:14:50.980 --> 02:14:52.860]  of protection he was receiving.
[02:14:52.860 --> 02:15:00.220]  You know, and it all goes back to the bar when he was, uh, you know, under Bush senior
[02:15:00.220 --> 02:15:05.060]  and he was a known Iran contract cover up my shirt.
[02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:12.460]  And you know, I, his credibility in my opinion, uh, based upon just the empirical data that's
[02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:15.220]  out there, he hasn't impressed me all that much.
[02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:19.340]  Well, here's the thing about that because I understand Barr's dad and the whole Epstein
[02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:22.900]  connection there and, but here's where it's at.
[02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:28.340]  It's like, I'm going to wait and see for my final verdict when it's all said done.
[02:15:28.340 --> 02:15:32.540]  But even the information that's gotten out, even if you want to say, oh, Trump should
[02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:37.140]  have done more, Barr should have done more, which I think is fair to say, even with all
[02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:39.660]  the information getting out, it's so devastating.
[02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:41.580]  I mean, it's like this.
[02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:45.300]  The only way they don't care about this information getting out is if they're about to launch
[02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:48.300]  some full blown nuclear war or a bio weapon.
[02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:52.580]  Otherwise, just this information getting out is so devastating to them.
[02:15:52.580 --> 02:15:54.820]  It's like, well, maybe Barr's not the bad guy.
[02:15:54.820 --> 02:15:59.260]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector
[02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:00.980]  without all the speculation.
[02:16:00.980 --> 02:16:06.300]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[02:16:06.300 --> 02:16:10.660]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox business news, blockchain, Davis enters offer an equipment
[02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:15.260]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace inspired by entrepreneurs who
[02:16:15.260 --> 02:16:17.340]  sold picks and shovels during the gold rush.
[02:16:17.340 --> 02:16:21.300]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital
[02:16:21.300 --> 02:16:24.180]  assets, not a security IPO or note.
[02:16:24.180 --> 02:16:29.260]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27%
[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:33.420]  annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:51.500]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before
[02:16:51.500 --> 02:16:55.300]  purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[02:16:55.300 --> 02:17:00.460]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:04.380]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave
[02:17:04.380 --> 02:17:05.860]  my family to freedom.
[02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:10.260]  Today we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden and homeschool
[02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:13.380]  our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[02:17:13.380 --> 02:17:17.980]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our BlackRifle RealEstate
[02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:18.980]  team is here to help.
[02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:46.540]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com, that's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:53.540]  We'll see you next time on BlackRifle RealEstate.
[02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:44.540]  We'll see you next time on BlackRifle RealEstate.
[02:18:44.540 --> 02:18:56.300]  Thanks for the support.
[02:18:56.300 --> 02:19:02.180]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[02:19:02.180 --> 02:19:06.500]  in the future, it would be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality
[02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:09.460]  who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[02:19:09.460 --> 02:19:14.660]  And today the communist Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago and we've
[02:19:14.660 --> 02:19:19.180]  seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's doing in this
[02:19:19.180 --> 02:19:23.020]  trade war once China put pressure on our farmers.
[02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:24.020]  That's beautiful.
[02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:27.500]  Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down.
[02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:31.540]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clinton's of the world that want to intimidate
[02:19:31.540 --> 02:19:35.780]  people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up and all you've done is
[02:19:35.780 --> 02:19:41.620]  awaken the human spirit and the human spirit lives at infowars.com and newswars.com and
[02:19:41.620 --> 02:19:46.460]  I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light, the
[02:19:46.460 --> 02:20:02.020]  dark of the night, we are the resistance, we are 1776 worldwide.
[02:03:35.060 --> 02:20:45.580]  a class that we could even understand or comprehend, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:45.580 --> 02:20:51.540]  But the barriers are starting to break down.
[02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:53.340]  So let's go back out to your calls.
[02:20:53.340 --> 02:20:57.500]  Let's go to ELSA in North Carolina to lead us off this segment.
[02:20:57.500 --> 02:20:58.500]  Go ahead, ELSA.
[02:20:58.500 --> 02:21:04.580]  Oh, and thanks so much for what you guys do, you and Alex and David and the crew, you
[02:21:04.580 --> 02:21:05.580]  guys are great.
[02:21:05.580 --> 02:21:13.900]  I want you to know, let your people who are trying to do you in like Soros and the Google
[02:21:13.900 --> 02:21:19.060]  and Apple and all of them, when they band you together, when they colluded to ban you,
[02:21:19.060 --> 02:21:23.940]  I started listening to the show and I have a feeling a lot more people did the same thing
[02:21:23.940 --> 02:21:28.780]  and I've been sharing the links and even before that, when I used to listen to the Blaze TV
[02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:35.140]  and Glenn Beck used to sell this nasty stuff about Trump, I saw your videos on the documentaries
[02:21:35.140 --> 02:21:40.380]  on Hillary and I shared them with my family who some of them, you know, a couple of them
[02:21:40.380 --> 02:21:43.180]  were like Democrats, but most of them are Republicans.
[02:21:43.180 --> 02:21:47.700]  Anyway, I was just really blown away by the fact that, you know, they used to make fun
[02:21:47.700 --> 02:21:48.700]  of Alex.
[02:21:48.700 --> 02:21:51.460]  And then as soon as I start watching him, I thought, he makes perfect sense.
[02:21:51.460 --> 02:21:52.460]  What is this?
[02:21:52.460 --> 02:21:57.340]  And so I start watching imports all the time and I buy the products and I send out the
[02:21:57.340 --> 02:21:58.900]  links as often as I can.
[02:21:58.900 --> 02:21:59.900]  I'm pretty busy.
[02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:03.740]  You know, I run a farm and I also work full time and kind of getting old too.
[02:22:03.740 --> 02:22:09.380]  But, you know, I really think you guys are a blessing and, you know, I really hope that
[02:22:09.380 --> 02:22:12.180]  we can stop the monarchy.
[02:22:12.180 --> 02:22:13.780]  I think it's really deep down.
[02:22:13.780 --> 02:22:14.780]  I think it's the Brits.
[02:22:14.780 --> 02:22:17.020]  I think they've been doing this for centuries.
[02:22:17.020 --> 02:22:18.860]  They busted up India.
[02:22:18.860 --> 02:22:21.340]  They busted up a lot of empires.
[02:22:21.340 --> 02:22:27.300]  And actually, if you read the Vedic literature, my spiritual master, I follow A.C. Bhaktivedanta
[02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:29.020]  Swami Prabhupada.
[02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:35.300]  He actually said that England and Europe are European stock that Bali Maharaj years ago,
[02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:39.740]  many, many years ago, thousands of years ago, there's all kinds of different, you know,
[02:22:39.740 --> 02:22:45.100]  effects of power that have merged throughout time and we're dealing with a world power
[02:22:45.100 --> 02:22:46.100]  right now.
[02:22:46.100 --> 02:22:47.180]  We've never seen thanks to technology.
[02:22:47.180 --> 02:22:48.900]  But you're a blessing, Elza.
[02:22:48.900 --> 02:22:49.900]  Thank you for calling in.
[02:22:49.900 --> 02:22:51.700]  Thank you for spreading our videos.
[02:22:51.700 --> 02:22:57.460]  And I think that what she was expressing is so common because it's like you can play
[02:22:57.460 --> 02:23:02.940]  the video game where you simulate being a football quarterback or you can play the video
[02:23:02.940 --> 02:23:07.260]  game where you simulate being an adventurer on a treasure hunt.
[02:23:07.260 --> 02:23:13.020]  But this isn't a game like cable news, mostly like 90% of it.
[02:23:13.020 --> 02:23:14.020]  That's just a game.
[02:23:14.020 --> 02:23:15.820]  It's like a simulation like, oh, we're pretending to be news.
[02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:16.820]  Oh, we're pretending to care.
[02:23:16.820 --> 02:23:21.060]  No, we're actually like out in the field, like looking at the trail that's been blazed,
[02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:24.660]  looking at, you know, the clues on the treasure map, trying to get there with you.
[02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:25.820]  So this isn't a game here.
[02:23:25.820 --> 02:23:26.820]  But you know, it's funny.
[02:23:26.820 --> 02:23:30.980]  She brought up the lineup, you know, even in the middle of the censorship, we're still
[02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:33.620]  able to expand and we're live 10 hours a day.
[02:23:33.620 --> 02:23:34.860]  Most people don't know that.
[02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:40.620]  We are live here at info wars 10 hours a day info wars.com slash show David night starts
[02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:47.500]  it off every weekday at 8am to 11am central, then the Alex Jones show from 11am to 3pm.
[02:23:47.500 --> 02:23:55.980]  And then I host the war room weekdays from 3pm to 6pm central, but we're able to do this
[02:23:55.980 --> 02:23:59.700]  thanks to the audience spreading those links and shopping and info store.com.
[02:23:59.700 --> 02:24:03.260]  But if you don't spread the links, if you don't tell friends and family, then nobody
[02:24:03.260 --> 02:24:04.260]  will.
[02:24:04.260 --> 02:24:07.700]  So let's go to Stuart in West Virginia.
[02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:08.700]  Go ahead.
[02:24:08.700 --> 02:24:14.940]  Hey, Owen, congratulations first off on the Zach Voorhees interview.
[02:24:14.940 --> 02:24:16.420]  That was really terrific.
[02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:18.660]  So important to get that out.
[02:24:18.660 --> 02:24:25.540]  The reason I was calling is to draw a comparison between the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the
[02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:33.580]  Saudi reporter who was murdered inside the embassy, the Saudi Arabian embassy in Istanbul
[02:24:33.580 --> 02:24:35.300]  and the Epstein murder.
[02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:43.820]  In the case of Khashoggi, which was last October, the U.S. whipped the world into a frenzy demanding
[02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:47.420]  justice, demanding an immediate investigation.
[02:24:47.420 --> 02:24:56.540]  Gina Haspel, the head of the CIA, personally gave Trump daily updates on who was involved,
[02:24:56.540 --> 02:24:59.220]  who ordered the assassination.
[02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:08.540]  I mean, Merkel, Macron, every every European country was all over the Saudis demanding
[02:25:08.540 --> 02:25:11.260]  answers to this assassination, to this murder.
[02:25:11.260 --> 02:25:12.980]  No, I see where you're going with this.
[02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:16.340]  And yet Epstein gets murdered in prison and nobody blinks an eye.
[02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:17.340]  That's exactly it.
[02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:20.180]  It's like it's all being shoved under the rug.
[02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:23.220]  But doesn't that just show you the control of the media?
[02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:24.220]  Absolutely.
[02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:25.220]  That's that's what I mean.
[02:25:25.220 --> 02:25:33.100]  And this is just, this is a case, you know, just a perfect postcard example of the hypocrisy
[02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:38.820]  of the double standard, frankly, with all due respect to Mr. Khashoggi, who was obviously
[02:25:38.820 --> 02:25:42.700]  just innocent and just taken out.
[02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:51.740]  The fact is that Epstein was a far more, on a global basis, a far more pivotal figure.
[02:25:51.740 --> 02:25:57.300]  And the fact that they are just trying to disappear this entire incident with all these
[02:25:57.300 --> 02:26:01.940]  phony explanations and everything else, it just, it's exactly what you just said.
[02:26:01.940 --> 02:26:02.940]  No, no, no.
[02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:08.380]  And imagine that too, because it's like, they're all demanding answers from Saudi Arabia.
[02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:09.380]  I'm not even mad.
[02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:12.100]  I wish the media was demanding answers from Trump.
[02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:14.140]  I wish the heat was on Trump and Barr.
[02:26:14.140 --> 02:26:15.300]  I really do.
[02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:16.300]  It's ridiculous.
[02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:17.300]  But exactly.
[02:26:17.300 --> 02:26:21.700]  You pointed out perfectly all this hysteria, all this hype, all, I mean, for weeks.
[02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:22.700]  Khashoggi.
[02:26:22.700 --> 02:26:23.700]  Khashoggi.
[02:26:23.700 --> 02:26:24.700]  Khashoggi.
[02:26:24.700 --> 02:26:25.700]  Murdered.
[02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:26.700]  Well, who's fault?
[02:26:26.700 --> 02:26:27.700]  Who did it?
[02:26:27.700 --> 02:26:28.700]  Who'd done it?
[02:26:28.700 --> 02:26:29.700]  Story of all time.
[02:26:29.700 --> 02:26:30.700]  Khashoggi.
[02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:33.140]  But then the Epstein deal happens, which is much larger in scale.
[02:26:33.140 --> 02:26:36.700]  And it's just like, oh, suicide, no questions asked.
[02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:41.980]  Mohammed bin Salman, they demanded answers.
[02:26:41.980 --> 02:26:47.900]  They demanded that he personally, you know, personally assure them that it was not an assassination
[02:26:47.900 --> 02:26:49.940]  and that he was not involved.
[02:26:49.940 --> 02:26:55.660]  You know, I mean, and all of these world leaders with all of this moral righteousness that,
[02:26:55.660 --> 02:26:59.300]  you know, justice must be found, but justice must be done.
[02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:00.780]  The answers must be found.
[02:27:00.780 --> 02:27:04.180]  I mean, you compare that to this.
[02:27:04.180 --> 02:27:07.220]  I mean, it is just night and day.
[02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:12.300]  And it really is a great example, as you said, a postcard example of how the media controls
[02:27:12.300 --> 02:27:14.140]  the narrative and what people care about.
[02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:15.140]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:15.140 --> 02:27:17.140]  Let's go to Kevin in Virginia.
[02:27:17.140 --> 02:27:19.140]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:27:19.140 --> 02:27:27.660]  Hey, Ellen, that blue dress is not Hillary's.
[02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:31.660]  That's Monica Lewinsky's dress and red shoes.
[02:27:31.660 --> 02:27:34.260]  It's for twisted that it looks at the surface.
[02:27:34.260 --> 02:27:36.260]  That guy is a sick freak.
[02:27:36.260 --> 02:27:37.260]  Oh, totally.
[02:27:37.260 --> 02:27:43.460]  Like this was like this picture and the fact that anything exists just shows the clown
[02:27:43.460 --> 02:27:44.820]  world we're living in.
[02:27:44.820 --> 02:27:45.820]  I'm not convinced.
[02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:49.580]  I first thought it was Monica Lewinsky's dress, then people showed me the picture of Hillary
[02:27:49.580 --> 02:27:51.620]  in the exact dress.
[02:27:51.620 --> 02:27:53.660]  There's some rumors going on about the red heels.
[02:27:53.660 --> 02:27:58.980]  Some people believe it is a symbolism, a call to pedophiles and a pedophilia symbolism
[02:27:58.980 --> 02:27:59.980]  thing.
[02:27:59.980 --> 02:28:05.020]  So either way, whatever it is, it just shows how sick and twisted and freaky these people
[02:28:05.020 --> 02:28:06.020]  really are.
[02:28:06.020 --> 02:28:07.020]  Yeah.
[02:28:07.020 --> 02:28:08.020]  Hey, you know what?
[02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:09.020]  Judgment's coming, brother.
[02:28:09.020 --> 02:28:10.020]  Hang on.
[02:28:10.020 --> 02:28:20.580]  You know, and I just hope, oh boy, that's, I mean, you think about how evil and wicked
[02:28:20.580 --> 02:28:28.300]  and twisted it's become and how just the average human has just watched it and even
[02:28:28.300 --> 02:28:30.580]  just engaged in it to some extent.
[02:28:30.580 --> 02:28:32.100]  Yeah, judgment is coming.
[02:28:32.100 --> 02:28:37.980]  You just hope that it's not going to be so merciless that everybody has to go down with
[02:28:37.980 --> 02:28:43.940]  these people because that's the level of Satanism we're dealing with here.
[02:28:43.940 --> 02:28:49.060]  That's the level of evil that we're dealing with here.
[02:28:49.060 --> 02:28:55.980]  And when, when redemption comes from God, it's not going to be pretty.

[02:29:56.180 --> 02:30:02.100]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[02:30:02.100 --> 02:30:06.500]  in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who
[02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:09.420]  actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[02:30:09.420 --> 02:30:14.140]  And today, the Communist Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago.
[02:30:14.140 --> 02:30:18.620]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president and what he's
[02:30:18.620 --> 02:30:22.980]  doing in this trade war once China put pressure on our farmers.
[02:30:22.980 --> 02:30:24.380]  That's beautiful.
[02:30:24.380 --> 02:30:27.460]  Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down.
[02:30:27.460 --> 02:30:32.220]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the world that want to intimidate
[02:30:32.220 --> 02:30:34.820]  people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.

[02:32:01.700 --> 02:32:02.700]  in the game.
[02:32:02.700 --> 02:32:03.700]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[02:32:03.700 --> 02:32:07.020]  I want to take the globalist on total transparency is our whole operation.
[02:32:07.020 --> 02:32:10.460]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products.
[02:32:10.460 --> 02:32:12.100]  We don't mark stuff up that much.
[02:32:12.100 --> 02:32:15.140]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[02:32:15.140 --> 02:32:16.140]  We got coffee.
[02:32:16.140 --> 02:32:17.140]  We got fish oil.
[02:32:17.140 --> 02:32:18.140]  We got turmeric.
[02:32:18.140 --> 02:32:19.140]  We got great toothpaste.
[02:32:19.140 --> 02:32:23.500]  We need things like DNA force plus, but ultimate krill oil has been sold out for four months
[02:32:23.500 --> 02:32:24.500]  for whatever reason.
[02:32:24.500 --> 02:32:26.220]  This became the most popular fish oil.
[02:32:26.220 --> 02:32:30.460]  It's totally full of the bottle and it is the strongest, purest krill oil and it cost
[02:32:30.460 --> 02:32:35.300]  us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to
[02:32:35.300 --> 02:32:36.860]  remove mercury.
[02:32:36.860 --> 02:32:40.620]  Any kind of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but
[02:32:40.620 --> 02:32:42.620]  gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[02:32:42.620 --> 02:32:43.620]  It's been boiled.
[02:32:43.620 --> 02:32:44.620]  It's been ruined.
[02:32:44.620 --> 02:32:45.620]  It's been a modus.
[02:32:45.620 --> 02:32:46.620]  This is not good.
[02:32:46.620 --> 02:32:50.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, he is the highest quality krill oil you're going to find anywhere.
[02:32:50.580 --> 02:32:52.020]  Real krill oil folks is red.
[02:32:52.020 --> 02:32:53.020]  It's not yellow.
[02:32:53.020 --> 02:32:54.020]  It's not milky.
[02:32:54.020 --> 02:32:58.980]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[02:32:58.980 --> 02:33:03.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:03.980 --> 02:33:27.340]  All right, we're about to be joined by Gerald Salenti.
[02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:31.100]  That means it's boogie time with Gerald Salenti from the Trends Research Journal.
[02:33:31.100 --> 02:33:37.860]  First folks, we've got exclusive breaking images right now.
[02:33:37.860 --> 02:33:39.620]  Literally we've got the exclusive right now.
[02:33:39.620 --> 02:33:44.700]  They have just found a couple more paintings from Jeffrey Epstein's mansion.
[02:33:44.700 --> 02:33:45.700]  Let's pull the new painting up.
[02:33:45.700 --> 02:33:47.820]  They just pulled this one out of the Epstein mansion.
[02:33:47.820 --> 02:33:51.300]  Look at that portrait of Michelle Obama right there.
[02:33:51.300 --> 02:33:57.260]  You really have to wonder who the artist is that is making these amazing portraits of
[02:33:57.260 --> 02:34:00.220]  Bill Clinton in a blue dress, Michelle Obama flexing.
[02:34:00.220 --> 02:34:03.460]  Is there another Michelle one that we found, too, guys?
[02:34:03.460 --> 02:34:06.860]  I think that they also found a second Michelle Obama.
[02:34:06.860 --> 02:34:07.860]  There it is.
[02:34:07.860 --> 02:34:08.860]  And there it is.
[02:34:08.860 --> 02:34:18.660]  So two new portraits emerging from Epstein's mansion featuring Michelle Obama as a muscle-bound
[02:34:18.660 --> 02:34:19.660]  roid head.
[02:34:19.660 --> 02:34:20.660]  Amazing.
[02:34:20.660 --> 02:34:22.460]  I wonder what other portraits will come out.
[02:34:22.460 --> 02:34:24.220]  Okay, we're having a little fun.
[02:34:24.220 --> 02:34:29.860]  We just found those images on the internet before somebody says, oh, fake news.
[02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:31.980]  We're just trying to have a laugh here, folks.
[02:34:31.980 --> 02:34:32.980]  It's okay to laugh.
[02:34:32.980 --> 02:34:36.420]  Gerald Salenti, Trends Research Journalist with us.
[02:34:36.420 --> 02:34:43.940]  Now, Gerald, you came on the war room with me two days ago saying, look out for a major
[02:34:43.940 --> 02:34:44.940]  recession.
[02:34:44.940 --> 02:34:47.780]  Look out for the market to correct itself.
[02:34:47.780 --> 02:34:50.500]  Look out for the yields to go low.
[02:34:50.500 --> 02:34:52.580]  Literally less than 24 hours later that happens.
[02:34:52.580 --> 02:34:56.340]  There's been a bit of a bump up back, but I think we're still in yesterday's market
[02:34:56.340 --> 02:34:57.940]  more than anything.
[02:34:57.940 --> 02:35:01.140]  So what did yesterday's market represent?
[02:35:01.140 --> 02:35:04.420]  What do these low yields represent?
[02:35:04.420 --> 02:35:13.020]  Yesterday's market down the Dow, down 800 points, represented factual data that no one
[02:35:13.020 --> 02:35:15.580]  could deny, that they keep trying to deny.
[02:35:15.580 --> 02:35:19.900]  We saw data coming in from China very weak.
[02:35:19.900 --> 02:35:22.020]  So data coming in from Germany.
[02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:25.700]  I mean, these are the two power nations of the world.
[02:35:25.700 --> 02:35:31.860]  These are big economies, the, you know, what is the second and third biggest economies.
[02:35:31.860 --> 02:35:32.980]  Germany's going into recession.
[02:35:32.980 --> 02:35:36.020]  We had a contraction last quarter.
[02:35:36.020 --> 02:35:39.780]  You're looking at weak data coming in from all over the world.
[02:35:39.780 --> 02:35:45.140]  The UK, the pound is plummeting, and they're moving toward recession.
[02:35:45.140 --> 02:35:48.500]  Look what just happened in Argentina.
[02:35:48.500 --> 02:35:51.860]  Their market's down over 40%.
[02:35:51.860 --> 02:35:55.620]  The peso's down over 25%.
[02:35:55.620 --> 02:36:02.980]  So around the world, India, one after another, all the economies are going down.
[02:36:02.980 --> 02:36:06.260]  And what they're doing is they're lowering interest rates around the world.
[02:36:06.260 --> 02:36:08.820]  New Zealand has record low interest rates now.
[02:36:08.820 --> 02:36:11.860]  They just lowered them last week, 50 basis points.
[02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:14.420]  Australia's record loads.
[02:36:14.420 --> 02:36:21.220]  India, I just mentioned, they're down four times they lowered interest rates.
[02:36:21.220 --> 02:36:25.220]  So they're real problems going on.
[02:36:25.220 --> 02:36:30.260]  What did the election in Argentina mean for these markets?
[02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:34.180]  Because it was tough for me to get a lot of information out of Argentina on this, but
[02:36:34.180 --> 02:36:39.540]  it appears it's kind of not necessarily a Trump, Bolsonaro candidate, but more of that
[02:36:39.540 --> 02:36:41.380]  ilk than of the globalist ilk.
[02:36:41.380 --> 02:36:43.380]  And it seems to be causing problems in Argentina.
[02:36:43.380 --> 02:36:46.020]  Is that an accurate analysis?
[02:36:46.020 --> 02:36:47.020]  Yes.
[02:36:47.020 --> 02:36:53.340]  It is an accurate analysis, and the guy that's in there now, McCree, and they had a primary
[02:36:53.340 --> 02:36:56.940]  election to see what's going to happen in the coming months.
[02:36:56.940 --> 02:36:59.780]  They have the official election, I believe, in October.
[02:36:59.780 --> 02:37:01.780]  He got slaughtered.
[02:37:01.780 --> 02:37:05.540]  McCree, he was built up, and we've been writing about this for months.
[02:37:05.540 --> 02:37:10.380]  Matter of fact, we did a big article in the November Trends Journal on it.
[02:37:10.380 --> 02:37:14.700]  And the reality is that he's one of the white shoe boys.
[02:37:14.700 --> 02:37:16.940]  They were so happy they were going to bring a pro in there.
[02:37:16.940 --> 02:37:18.100]  This guy's a businessman.
[02:37:18.100 --> 02:37:19.100]  He knows what to do.
[02:37:19.100 --> 02:37:21.020]  He's going to straighten his deal out.
[02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:28.900]  Yeah, they went to the mob, the International Mafia Federation, that people like to call
[02:37:28.900 --> 02:37:40.540]  the International Monetary Fund, and they borrowed $56 billion to pump up the economy.
[02:37:40.540 --> 02:37:46.060]  $56 billion, the most that the IMF have aloneed out.
[02:37:46.060 --> 02:37:49.700]  Hey, well, loan you the money, but here's what you got to do.
[02:37:49.700 --> 02:37:52.980]  I don't want the people having any benefits, pensions.
[02:37:52.980 --> 02:37:56.780]  They get nothing, and you raise the retirement age till after they die.
[02:37:56.780 --> 02:38:00.220]  Well, I'm going to give you the money I want to back.
[02:38:00.220 --> 02:38:03.100]  You sell everything that you got over here.
[02:38:03.100 --> 02:38:06.420]  They're in a deep depression.
[02:38:06.420 --> 02:38:10.620]  You got 23% unemployment.
[02:38:10.620 --> 02:38:16.780]  You have inflation going up yearly by over 50%.
[02:38:16.780 --> 02:38:19.540]  You have the peso plummeting.
[02:38:19.540 --> 02:38:25.620]  The guy was nothing more than one of the front men for the mob.
[02:38:25.620 --> 02:38:26.700]  That's why he's out of there.
[02:38:26.700 --> 02:38:30.380]  Now they're bringing another mob back in.
[02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:32.940]  So one mob is in place and the other.
[02:38:32.940 --> 02:38:38.300]  As we see the stock market yesterday, again, a little recovery today, I think the story
[02:38:38.300 --> 02:38:39.460]  is still yesterday's market.
[02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:40.460]  It's nothing.
[02:38:40.460 --> 02:38:47.980]  Versus what's happening in China, what is the world watching as they see the tensions
[02:38:47.980 --> 02:38:53.100]  in China and Hong Kong, the trade wars with China and the United States, and the markets
[02:38:53.100 --> 02:38:54.100]  fluctuating.
[02:38:54.100 --> 02:39:00.500]  So, I mean, sporadically, again, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:03.820]  You mentioned what's going on with China and Hong Kong.
[02:39:03.820 --> 02:39:07.780]  Now let's look what's going on with India and Pakistan.
[02:39:07.780 --> 02:39:10.300]  India's in deep economic trouble.
[02:39:10.300 --> 02:39:14.180]  The guy Modi that just got reelected prime minister promised promised promised the markets
[02:39:14.180 --> 02:39:17.940]  a way down they load interest rate four times in a row.
[02:39:17.940 --> 02:39:18.940]  Look at the new car sales.
[02:39:18.940 --> 02:39:19.940]  It just came out in India.
[02:39:19.940 --> 02:39:20.940]  They're in the tank.
[02:39:20.940 --> 02:39:22.460]  Had nothing to do with trade wars.
[02:39:22.460 --> 02:39:25.940]  The whole economy is going down around the world.
[02:39:25.940 --> 02:39:27.660]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:28.660]  You know, I want cash.
[02:39:28.660 --> 02:39:31.900]  Me are going to rip up that 1947 agreement.
[02:39:31.900 --> 02:39:32.900]  Screw you, Pakistan.
[02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:34.260]  I know we've been fighting about it.
[02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:35.260]  You believe it's yours.
[02:39:35.260 --> 02:39:36.260]  I believe it's mine.
[02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:40.460]  We've killed over 50,000 people there already, but I'm going to get my people's mind off
[02:39:40.460 --> 02:39:46.460]  the problems they're having economically and we're going to take all the cash in here.
[02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:52.860]  Go back to what's going on in Hong Kong, 7 million people in Hong Kong, verse 1.4 billion
[02:39:52.860 --> 02:39:53.860]  in China.
[02:39:53.860 --> 02:39:56.380]  Who do you think's going to win anyway?
[02:39:56.380 --> 02:39:59.460]  What happens when they win?
[02:39:59.460 --> 02:40:06.860]  They wipe out the Western banking systems, Asian headquarters in Hong Kong.
[02:40:06.860 --> 02:40:14.860]  This is going to be a bank war between China and its allies in the United States and its
[02:40:14.860 --> 02:40:16.060]  allies.
[02:40:16.060 --> 02:40:17.860]  It's already happening.
[02:40:17.860 --> 02:40:20.380]  This thing is going down big.
[02:40:20.380 --> 02:40:22.300]  History is repeating itself.
[02:40:22.300 --> 02:40:24.860]  We're in the 1930s.
[02:40:24.860 --> 02:40:32.340]  Trade wars, currency wars, Great Depression, World War II.
[02:40:32.340 --> 02:40:35.040]  Here we are in August.
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:48.620]  Trade wars, currency wars, the Great Depression, World War III, if we don't change the course.
[02:40:48.620 --> 02:40:51.980]  So what do you think the course change needs to be?
[02:40:51.980 --> 02:40:57.260]  The president is begging the Fed to lower interest rates and help him out, but doesn't
[02:40:57.260 --> 02:40:58.780]  seem to be getting the response he wants.
[02:40:58.780 --> 02:41:01.060]  What do you think the president needs to do?
[02:41:01.060 --> 02:41:03.340]  It's not going to help that much.
[02:41:03.340 --> 02:41:07.220]  The last time we were in a recession, the Fed lowered interest rates five percentage
[02:41:07.220 --> 02:41:08.220]  points.
[02:41:08.220 --> 02:41:09.860]  They got two to go.
[02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:10.860]  That's all they have left.
[02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:12.500]  They're going to come up with a scheme.
[02:41:12.500 --> 02:41:13.740]  All the central banks will.
[02:41:13.740 --> 02:41:16.380]  They'll pump it up artificially for a while.
[02:41:16.380 --> 02:41:20.740]  That's why we don't see the Great Depression really becoming, hitting the public so they
[02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:24.380]  really know it until probably about a year from now.
[02:41:24.380 --> 02:41:26.940]  So what can he do?
[02:41:26.940 --> 02:41:34.260]  He direct the energies of the nation into a more positive future.
[02:41:34.260 --> 02:41:38.100]  Again, it's my Occupy Peace Program.
[02:41:38.100 --> 02:41:42.820]  Bring home the troops, close the bases overseas, secure the homeland, put them to work rebuilding
[02:41:42.820 --> 02:41:45.020]  our rotted infrastructure.
[02:41:45.020 --> 02:41:50.180]  Happen during the Great Depression, the WPA, Work Progress Administration, Hoover Dam,
[02:41:50.180 --> 02:41:52.820]  the highways, bridges all over the country.
[02:41:52.820 --> 02:41:54.900]  We bring that energy back in.
[02:41:54.900 --> 02:42:00.180]  But two, what we do is rather than supporting the military industrial complex to build these
[02:42:00.180 --> 02:42:05.660]  deadly weapons, we start developing alternative energies for real, putting trillions in to
[02:42:05.660 --> 02:42:08.220]  come out with the newest of the 21st century.
[02:42:08.220 --> 02:42:15.620]  We start building the 21st century and finally shrinking government from city level to federal
[02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:16.620]  level.
[02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:17.620]  You talk about Trump.
[02:42:17.620 --> 02:42:21.260]  Look at the budget they just passed, trillion dollar a year loss.
[02:42:21.260 --> 02:42:28.180]  We've got to start shrinking budgets on a national level, personal level, state level,
[02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:29.180]  all of us.
[02:42:29.180 --> 02:42:33.100]  We have to prepare, prevail, to prosper in the coming Great Depression.
[02:42:33.100 --> 02:42:37.420]  You know, I kind of want to just in the next segment, I think it'd be fun, maybe me and
[02:42:37.420 --> 02:42:41.540]  you should just, you want to just take 10 minutes and just bitch about taxes?
[02:42:41.540 --> 02:42:42.540]  Sure.
[02:42:42.540 --> 02:42:46.540]  I'm so sick of, I could go, I could go all day.
[02:42:46.540 --> 02:42:50.940]  I'm so sick of paying taxes, I can't even drive on a road that doesn't have 10 potholes
[02:42:50.940 --> 02:42:51.940]  in it.
[02:42:51.940 --> 02:42:52.940]  It's a joke.
[02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:53.940]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:53.940 --> 02:42:54.940]  Sick of taxes.
[02:42:54.940 --> 02:43:01.100]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:05.500]  in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who
[02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:08.380]  actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[02:43:08.380 --> 02:43:13.580]  And today the communist Chinese have banned all U.S. farming goods a week ago and we've
[02:43:13.580 --> 02:43:18.020]  seen massive increases in polls to support for the president and what he's doing in
[02:43:18.020 --> 02:43:21.980]  this trade war, once China put pressure on our farmers.
[02:43:21.980 --> 02:43:23.380]  That's beautiful.
[02:43:23.380 --> 02:43:26.460]  Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down.
[02:43:26.460 --> 02:43:30.500]  So to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's, the world that want to intimidate
[02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:35.220]  people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up and all you've done is awaken
[02:43:35.220 --> 02:43:36.220]  the human spirit.
[02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:42.500]  The human spirit lives at infowars.com and newswars.com and I'm asking listeners, whatever
[02:43:42.500 --> 02:43:46.380]  you do, spread those links because we are the light, the dark of the night.
[02:43:46.380 --> 02:43:47.460]  We are the resistance.
[02:43:47.460 --> 02:43:55.100]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[02:43:55.100 --> 02:43:59.300]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators.
[02:43:59.300 --> 02:44:00.380]  They are technocrats.
[02:44:00.380 --> 02:44:04.180]  They are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your
[02:44:04.180 --> 02:44:08.700]  own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge
[02:44:08.700 --> 02:44:09.700]  with AI gods.
[02:44:09.700 --> 02:44:13.340]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[02:44:13.340 --> 02:44:14.340]  third dimension.
[02:44:14.340 --> 02:44:18.540]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control
[02:44:18.540 --> 02:44:20.820]  in our lives is our bodies.
[02:44:20.820 --> 02:44:26.100]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements for the fourslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[02:44:26.100 --> 02:44:30.420]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[02:44:30.420 --> 02:44:36.140]  medical bottom and double the strength of it in a new formula, ultra 12.
[02:44:36.140 --> 02:44:40.940]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're
[02:44:40.940 --> 02:44:41.940]  going to find anywhere.
[02:44:41.940 --> 02:44:47.180]  It is amazing, experience pure medical bottom and B12 for yourself and fund the second American
[02:44:47.180 --> 02:44:57.020]  evolution against the tyrants at info wars store.com, info warslife.com or AAA 253 3139.
[02:44:57.020 --> 02:45:01.620]  Without your support, we won't be here and I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact
[02:45:01.620 --> 02:45:02.620]  that you've kept us in the game.
[02:45:02.620 --> 02:45:04.020]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[02:45:04.020 --> 02:45:07.420]  I want to take the globalist on total transparency is our whole operation.
[02:45:07.420 --> 02:45:11.340]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products because we don't
[02:45:11.340 --> 02:45:12.340]  mark stuff up that much.
[02:45:12.340 --> 02:45:15.580]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[02:45:15.580 --> 02:45:19.900]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things
[02:45:19.900 --> 02:45:24.300]  like DNA force plus, but ultimate krill oil has been sold out for four months for whatever
[02:45:24.300 --> 02:45:26.620]  reason this became the most popular fish oil.
[02:45:26.620 --> 02:45:30.860]  It's totally full of the bottle and it is the strongest, purest krill oil and it cost
[02:45:30.860 --> 02:45:35.740]  us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to
[02:45:35.740 --> 02:45:36.740]  remove mercury.
[02:45:36.740 --> 02:45:41.020]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like but
[02:45:41.020 --> 02:45:42.460]  it gives you all the great benefits.
[02:45:42.460 --> 02:45:43.460]  Is it real?
[02:45:43.460 --> 02:45:45.340]  It's been boiled, it's been rillent, it's been homogenized.
[02:45:45.340 --> 02:45:46.340]  This is not it.
[02:45:46.340 --> 02:45:51.020]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're going to find anywhere.
[02:45:51.020 --> 02:45:52.460]  Real krill oil folks is red.
[02:45:52.460 --> 02:45:53.460]  It's not yellow.
[02:45:53.460 --> 02:45:54.460]  It's not milky.
[02:45:54.460 --> 02:45:57.300]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[02:45:57.300 --> 02:46:01.300]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're
[02:46:01.300 --> 02:46:04.940]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[02:46:04.940 --> 02:46:08.260]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk
[02:46:08.260 --> 02:46:11.700]  about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and I'd have
[02:46:11.700 --> 02:46:14.060]  doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[02:46:14.060 --> 02:46:17.660]  And instead the last few years I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut
[02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:18.660]  us down.
[02:46:18.660 --> 02:46:20.820]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[02:46:20.820 --> 02:46:21.820]  wonderful they were.
[02:46:21.820 --> 02:46:23.660]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:26.540]  Jones sells unapproved supplements.
[02:46:26.540 --> 02:46:27.900]  He claims they're supplements.
[02:46:27.900 --> 02:46:33.300]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[02:46:33.300 --> 02:46:35.860]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[02:46:35.860 --> 02:46:39.740]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the
[02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:43.300]  system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[02:46:43.300 --> 02:46:44.620]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[02:46:44.620 --> 02:46:48.580]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[02:46:48.580 --> 02:46:50.220]  God's medicine chest.
[02:46:50.220 --> 02:47:08.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:08.260 --> 02:47:34.940]  It's like you buy something and you pay a tax on it and then the government comes back
[02:47:34.940 --> 02:47:39.300]  a month later says, hey, you owe us taxes on that, you're like, for what?
[02:47:39.300 --> 02:47:42.140]  But before we do that, folks, we've got big specials.
[02:47:42.140 --> 02:47:46.100]  Now Gerald Solenti has his supermail vitality on his desk right now.
[02:47:46.100 --> 02:47:51.780]  Now as Gerald Solenti says it, when it's boogie time, it's supermail vitality time.
[02:47:51.780 --> 02:47:57.940]  You can take that for whatever you want it to mean on the dance floor or, you know, but

[02:48:12.740 --> 02:48:17.580]  And when you combine the two folks, you better be active, you better be ready to be a toxic
[02:48:17.580 --> 02:48:18.580]  Maskey Linus.
[02:48:18.580 --> 02:48:23.180]  If you're going to be combining supermail vitality and alpha power, let me tell you.

[02:49:01.140 --> 02:49:06.860]  It's you, the audience, true grassroots, true independent media here at InfoWars.
[02:49:06.860 --> 02:49:11.500]  And the formula is you shop at infowarstore.com.

[02:49:21.980 --> 02:49:26.420]  This segment is brought to you by Supermail Vitality because we're with Gerald Salenty.
[02:49:26.420 --> 02:49:35.860]  Now, Gerald, so I had before you go on, before you move forward, you were talking about your
[02:49:35.860 --> 02:49:42.540]  to be prepared and the meals that you can, the survival gear and the meals and the filters
[02:49:42.540 --> 02:49:44.580]  and all the things you have.
[02:49:44.580 --> 02:49:49.260]  This is time to prepare so you can prevail and prosper.
[02:49:49.260 --> 02:49:51.420]  You know, you prepare for the worst.
[02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:54.660]  If the worst doesn't happen, you've lost nothing.
[02:49:54.660 --> 02:49:59.340]  If the worst happens and you haven't prepared, you could lose everything.
[02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:04.380]  So when you're talking about storing up on food, water filters, everything that you need.
[02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:09.380]  And again, one of my GCs, 3Gs, guns, gold and a getaway plan.
[02:50:09.380 --> 02:50:15.020]  Because when this breaks out, things are going to get very ugly and you may want to get away
[02:50:15.020 --> 02:50:19.580]  and you better, you know, learn how to read a map and find out back roads to where you
[02:50:19.580 --> 02:50:23.820]  want to go to get away because the whole system will be down.
[02:50:23.820 --> 02:50:27.760]  So when you have all these products that you're talking about, you know, a lot of them really
[02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:33.540]  have to do with, you know, survival in its truest sense.
[02:50:33.540 --> 02:50:44.820]  So Gerald, I had to recently pay a license renewal fee for my vehicle.
[02:50:44.820 --> 02:50:48.660]  And it's actually not so bad here in Texas, the property taxes, but another state is truly
[02:50:48.660 --> 02:50:49.660]  bad.
[02:50:49.660 --> 02:50:50.660]  But, you know, I'm sitting here.
[02:50:50.660 --> 02:50:51.660]  I'm sitting here.
[02:50:51.660 --> 02:50:52.660]  Yeah.
[02:50:52.660 --> 02:50:54.660]  Probably in New York, you know, they chop off your, they chop off your arm.
[02:50:54.660 --> 02:50:55.900]  Oh, this is what I want.
[02:50:55.900 --> 02:50:58.180]  This is exactly what I wanted right here.
[02:50:58.180 --> 02:51:01.900]  So anyway, so they send me the bill.
[02:51:01.900 --> 02:51:05.540]  You know, it could be worse, but it's just, you know, it's like somebody's coming in like
[02:51:05.540 --> 02:51:09.460]  knocking you on the back of the head with a baton or something like, oh, like, oh, like
[02:51:09.460 --> 02:51:13.260]  maybe you don't have a concussion, but you're kind of stirred and I'm like, you know, so,
[02:51:13.260 --> 02:51:14.260]  so I have to go.
[02:51:14.260 --> 02:51:15.420]  Oh, so Gerald.
[02:51:15.420 --> 02:51:17.140]  So here's how it goes.
[02:51:17.140 --> 02:51:21.580]  So I have to drive to the government office to pay this bill.
[02:51:21.580 --> 02:51:26.900]  As I'm driving down the roads that I pay for via the government, I hit 10 different potholes
[02:51:26.900 --> 02:51:29.220]  probably ruin my axle.
[02:51:29.220 --> 02:51:33.260]  Then I get to the government building and what I'm waiting in line for an hour because
[02:51:33.260 --> 02:51:35.260]  there's 30 schlubs ahead of me.
[02:51:35.260 --> 02:51:39.420]  And then finally I pay the bill for the roads that don't even work and the lines that would
[02:51:39.420 --> 02:51:40.580]  take too long to get through.
[02:51:40.580 --> 02:51:42.780]  So it's just, I'm so sick of getting taxes.
[02:51:42.780 --> 02:51:44.300]  I want to cut taxes.
[02:51:44.300 --> 02:51:47.220]  I'd start cutting taxes and never until I die.
[02:51:47.220 --> 02:51:50.100]  I'd literally be like, I'm just cutting every tax until I'm out of office.
[02:51:50.100 --> 02:51:55.740]  Well, we could we could start when we didn't have a federal income tax.
[02:51:55.740 --> 02:52:02.060]  And I believe that Woodrow, may he rotten held Wilson, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, bullets,
[02:52:02.060 --> 02:52:08.380]  bombs and banks, who is a Princeton president gave us those when he started World War One
[02:52:08.380 --> 02:52:15.660]  as well, gave us the Federal Reserve, do away with federal taxes, we don't, we should
[02:52:15.660 --> 02:52:17.180]  not be paying them.
[02:52:17.180 --> 02:52:23.540]  Look, all of these jobs, again, I began my career at a graduate school as the number
[02:52:23.540 --> 02:52:28.700]  two guy running the mayoral campaign in Yonkers, New York, and this is a city like 300,000
[02:52:28.700 --> 02:52:29.700]  people.
[02:52:29.700 --> 02:52:33.140]  I was working on all the Westchester County campaigns.
[02:52:33.140 --> 02:52:36.260]  They sent me up to Albany, they were grooming me.
[02:52:36.260 --> 02:52:39.860]  I was the assistant to the secretary of the New York State Senate.
[02:52:39.860 --> 02:52:43.420]  I've been with presidents, princes, prime ministers.
[02:52:43.420 --> 02:52:50.980]  All these these things are is they politicians create jobs for their friends, morons and
[02:52:50.980 --> 02:52:54.300]  imbeciles, column bureaucrats.
[02:52:54.300 --> 02:52:56.060]  That's all this is.
[02:52:56.060 --> 02:53:02.900]  We should not be building one new government facility, city, state or federal.
[02:53:02.900 --> 02:53:06.780]  We should be, again, with Trump building the budget, they should have been cutting
[02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:07.780]  the budget.
[02:53:07.780 --> 02:53:08.780]  Big time.
[02:53:08.780 --> 02:53:16.020]  I don't want to pay more money to give it to cowards, liars, freaks and fools that
[02:53:16.020 --> 02:53:17.700]  people call bureaucrats.
[02:53:17.700 --> 02:53:20.980]  I'm sick of paying school taxes.
[02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:22.500]  Here's the way I look at it.
[02:53:22.500 --> 02:53:27.980]  The more kids you have, the more you pay, the less you have, the less you pair and have
[02:53:27.980 --> 02:53:28.980]  any kids.
[02:53:28.980 --> 02:53:29.980]  I don't want to pay for you.
[02:53:29.980 --> 02:53:34.740]  I hope by you educating our children, they're going to help you save it, save it.
[02:53:34.740 --> 02:53:36.860]  Don't want to hear it.
[02:53:36.860 --> 02:53:39.180]  You want to have kids, you put them pay for school.
[02:53:39.180 --> 02:53:41.460]  I don't want to pay.
[02:53:41.460 --> 02:53:42.940]  The taxes are ridiculous.
[02:53:42.940 --> 02:53:44.820]  I'm up here in Kingston, New York.
[02:53:44.820 --> 02:53:50.820]  We got this little nothing boy of a mayor, a little gutless little clown that cut down
[02:53:50.820 --> 02:53:58.180]  the trees in front of my most historic buildings in America, the only four corners with pre-revolutionary
[02:53:58.180 --> 02:54:03.020]  war stone buildings with the seeds of democracy was sown.
[02:54:03.020 --> 02:54:08.060]  The whole place looks like garbage, and they keep raising your taxes.
[02:54:08.060 --> 02:54:13.660]  The taxes I pay are enormous, but nothing.
[02:54:13.660 --> 02:54:19.660]  The taxes they're going to raise on us, Owen, they're going to raise taxes on us as the
[02:54:19.660 --> 02:54:22.380]  economy goes down.
[02:54:22.380 --> 02:54:28.860]  They'll find new ways to shaft us so these worthless garbage people could keep their
[02:54:28.860 --> 02:54:29.860]  job.
[02:54:29.860 --> 02:54:30.860]  They already figured it out.
[02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:32.260]  I got them figured out, Jill.
[02:54:32.260 --> 02:54:34.900]  This is what their new plan is.
[02:54:34.900 --> 02:54:39.860]  This whole minimum wage thing is such a front for them getting more tax dollars because
[02:54:39.860 --> 02:54:43.460]  they're going to raise the minimum wage, say $15, $20 or whatever, and then they're going
[02:54:43.460 --> 02:54:45.380]  to raise the percentage of taxes.
[02:54:45.380 --> 02:54:49.380]  So oh, you know, oh, look at me, I'm getting paid $20 an hour.
[02:54:49.380 --> 02:54:50.740]  Well, no, you're not.
[02:54:50.740 --> 02:54:56.260]  You're going to take 60% of that now, and now you're actually only making $9 an hour,
[02:54:56.260 --> 02:54:57.940]  and the government's just getting more money.
[02:54:57.940 --> 02:55:03.740]  To me, the minimum wage hike is just government going deeper into your pockets.
[02:55:03.740 --> 02:55:05.220]  And add on to that.
[02:55:05.220 --> 02:55:06.940]  I'm telling you what's going to happen.
[02:55:06.940 --> 02:55:12.860]  I was talking about what happened with Argentina, same thing in Brazil.
[02:55:12.860 --> 02:55:17.660]  They shaft you on one end and raise the taxes on the other end.
[02:55:17.660 --> 02:55:21.060]  They call it austerity measures.
[02:55:21.060 --> 02:55:22.060]  They're doing it in Japan.
[02:55:22.060 --> 02:55:25.900]  They're going to try to try to raise the tax there, 10%.
[02:55:25.900 --> 02:55:27.780]  They're doing it all over.
[02:55:27.780 --> 02:55:31.940]  They're going to raise our taxes any way they can.
[02:55:31.940 --> 02:55:34.700]  Whatever they charge us for, they'll make up something new.
[02:55:34.700 --> 02:55:37.780]  It's the same thing about the legalization of marijuana.
[02:55:37.780 --> 02:55:39.980]  What do you think they're legalizing it for?
[02:55:39.980 --> 02:55:41.180]  It's already legal.
[02:55:41.180 --> 02:55:42.540]  Mother Nature made it.
[02:55:42.540 --> 02:55:47.020]  No, we're going to take control of it so we can get more of your money.
[02:55:47.020 --> 02:55:49.660]  The higher you get, the more we make.
[02:55:49.660 --> 02:55:51.580]  No, that's a good point.
[02:55:51.580 --> 02:55:56.460]  And then they even talk about, I think there were just stories out about how Colorado has
[02:55:56.460 --> 02:56:00.620]  become the first state with a billion-dollar pot industry.
[02:56:00.620 --> 02:56:05.020]  And they're taxing it pretty high, pretty steep.
[02:56:05.020 --> 02:56:08.260]  But it's just like, I mean, so do you think, though, that-
[02:56:08.260 --> 02:56:15.500]  They're making more money on taxes on pot in Colorado than they are on booze.
[02:56:15.500 --> 02:56:22.860]  And what right do they have to tax us to drink alcohol, to smoke pot, to take it as a medicine,
[02:56:22.860 --> 02:56:23.860]  whatever?
[02:56:23.860 --> 02:56:30.340]  We got liars, cowards, freaks and fools running our world and ruining our nation.
[02:56:30.340 --> 02:56:34.300]  Morons and imbeciles call them Democrats and Republicans.
[02:56:34.300 --> 02:56:37.940]  I call them the Bloods and the Crips, murderers and thieves.
[02:56:37.940 --> 02:56:40.060]  I've had a change of heart.
[02:56:40.060 --> 02:56:43.180]  I think I want to pay more taxes.
[02:56:43.180 --> 02:56:53.420]  Then you should vote for Mr. Boogie, who pays the taxes, whether taxes Mr. Boogie's going
[02:56:53.420 --> 02:56:55.860]  to put on you is a fat tax.
[02:56:55.860 --> 02:56:58.300]  The more you weigh, the more you pay.
[02:56:58.300 --> 02:56:59.300]  That's right.
[02:56:59.300 --> 02:57:03.300]  The more you weigh, the more you pay, because look at the obesity rates in this country.
[02:57:03.300 --> 02:57:05.260]  Hey, that might actually help.
[02:57:05.260 --> 02:57:09.020]  Look what we're going to have to pay for all of these people that are going to become very
[02:57:09.020 --> 02:57:11.660]  ill because they won't take care of themselves.
[02:57:11.660 --> 02:57:12.980]  Oh, I hate that.
[02:57:12.980 --> 02:57:13.980]  That's the thing too.
[02:57:13.980 --> 02:57:17.020]  It's like, if you are a healthy individual, I take really good care of my body.
[02:57:17.020 --> 02:57:20.700]  I mean, I'm not perfect, but I have to pay for someone's health care that smokes a pack
[02:57:20.700 --> 02:57:24.420]  of cigarettes every day, that doesn't exercise, that eats unhealthy.
[02:57:24.420 --> 02:57:25.420]  You got it.
[02:57:25.420 --> 02:57:26.420]  You're right.
[02:57:26.420 --> 02:57:27.420]  No, I want to.
[02:57:27.420 --> 02:57:28.420]  I want to pay more taxes.
[02:57:28.420 --> 02:57:29.780]  I'm a Democrat voter.
[02:57:29.780 --> 02:57:31.100]  I hate Trump's tax cuts.
[02:57:31.100 --> 02:57:36.620]  But Republicans too are repulsive kids, Democrats are repulsive kids.
[02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:46.380]  There's research, the Trends Journal, Gerald Salenti, always fun, cut the damn taxes please.
[02:57:46.380 --> 02:57:53.740]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[02:57:53.740 --> 02:57:58.140]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[02:57:58.140 --> 02:58:07.340]  To say the name, Alex Jones, are infowars.com.
[02:58:07.340 --> 02:58:09.060]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[02:58:09.060 --> 02:58:10.300]  This is racketeering.
[02:58:10.300 --> 02:58:11.300]  This is cartels.
[02:58:11.300 --> 02:58:13.780]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[02:58:13.780 --> 02:58:15.660]  We need it now.
[02:58:15.660 --> 02:58:17.340]  You can take on big tech.
[02:58:17.340 --> 02:58:24.780]  They saw infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[02:58:24.780 --> 02:58:26.300]  populist organization.
[02:58:26.300 --> 02:58:31.020]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him
[02:58:31.020 --> 02:58:34.300]  off the air, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[02:58:34.300 --> 02:58:39.220]  The way to fight back is to support infowars now more than ever and make it a standard
[02:58:39.220 --> 02:58:41.020]  of freedom and free speech.
[02:58:41.020 --> 02:58:47.380]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[02:58:47.380 --> 02:58:52.500]  An info warrior fan favorite formula, Survival Shield X2, continues to lead the way into

[03:01:10.940 --> 03:01:15.580]  So welcome to pod cuck america, Alexandra, please go on.
[03:01:15.580 --> 03:01:22.300]  Line, and there's racism there, and then I wonder, like I don't necessarily want to
[03:01:22.300 --> 03:01:27.860]  vilify people who vote for Trump, but at the same time, you also need to call racism out,
[03:01:27.860 --> 03:01:32.380]  and I don't know how, even beyond Trump, I don't know how we ever sort of piece this
[03:01:32.380 --> 03:01:36.380]  back together, or where are the spaces for these conversations?
[03:01:36.380 --> 03:01:37.380]  It's not Twitter.
[03:01:37.380 --> 03:01:38.380]  No, it's certainly not.
[03:01:38.380 --> 03:01:39.380]  First slide.
[03:01:39.380 --> 03:01:45.620]  This is, you know what, I almost apologize.
[03:01:45.620 --> 03:01:52.500]  This is such low IQ dribble, I mean, but this is what the left is.
[03:01:52.500 --> 03:01:59.500]  That's what I'm saying, like, we're not freaking racist, you guys are just stupid.
[03:01:59.500 --> 03:02:06.380]  That's really what this is, but they deny their own stupidity, and then they just mask
[03:02:06.380 --> 03:02:09.860]  it by saying, oh, everyone's a racist that I politically disagree with.
[03:02:09.860 --> 03:02:13.380]  So let's go back to pod cuck soy america.
[03:02:13.380 --> 03:02:22.180]  I think the biggest mistake that we have, and it's a trap that gets set by the right,
[03:02:22.180 --> 03:02:26.900]  whether intentionally or unintentionally, is just the frame of asking is blank racist.
[03:02:26.900 --> 03:02:27.900]  That's all I do.
[03:02:27.900 --> 03:02:31.460]  It's something that we have to pull ourselves out of.
[03:02:31.460 --> 03:02:34.620]  It's not about asking whether Trump voters are racist.
[03:02:34.620 --> 03:02:37.900]  We need to talk about racism, not racists.
[03:02:37.900 --> 03:02:39.900]  What is with these people?
[03:02:39.900 --> 03:02:40.900]  Pause it.
[03:02:40.900 --> 03:02:43.140]  I'm telling you, like, do you hear what they're saying?
[03:02:43.140 --> 03:02:46.540]  I'm wondering, like, do they even hear what they're saying?
[03:02:46.540 --> 03:02:50.660]  It's like that old joke from arrested development with Tobias Fugue.
[03:02:50.660 --> 03:02:53.660]  I just blew myself, like, did you hear what you just said?
[03:02:53.660 --> 03:02:56.340]  It's like, I wonder, are they even listening to what they're saying?
[03:02:56.340 --> 03:02:58.220]  Do they understand how dumb they sound?
[03:02:58.220 --> 03:03:00.780]  We need to talk about racism.
[03:03:00.780 --> 03:03:01.780]  Everybody's racist.
[03:03:01.780 --> 03:03:05.540]  Yes, Trump supporters are very racist, but how do we move the conversation beyond Trump
[03:03:05.540 --> 03:03:06.540]  supporters being racist?
[03:03:06.540 --> 03:03:10.620]  Well, we need to talk about how everything's racist and ask what's racist about this.
[03:03:10.620 --> 03:03:13.300]  Oh, I have a toilet seat in my house that's white.
[03:03:13.300 --> 03:03:14.300]  Is that racist?
[03:03:14.300 --> 03:03:18.220]  Yes, you did have a toilet seat that's white and black, and then you not racist.
[03:03:18.220 --> 03:03:21.300]  Oh, but you still might be racist because everything is racist.
[03:03:21.300 --> 03:03:25.380]  Oh, but we have to talk about the racism, and then maybe nothing will be racist, but everything
[03:03:25.380 --> 03:03:26.380]  is still racist.
[03:03:26.380 --> 03:03:31.780]  So we talk about it, and then everybody that listens to my podcast is a bunch of basket
[03:03:31.780 --> 03:03:38.060]  cases because they think everything's racist.
[03:03:38.060 --> 03:03:39.060]  Something racist?
[03:03:39.060 --> 03:03:40.060]  Yes or no?
[03:03:40.060 --> 03:03:41.060]  And then you debate it.
[03:03:41.060 --> 03:03:42.500]  What do you do about that?
[03:03:42.500 --> 03:03:48.860]  We need to talk about racism, its contours, its histories, where it manifests, how it's
[03:03:48.860 --> 03:03:56.340]  used, because by winning political phenomena, whether they're good or bad in your opinion,
[03:03:56.340 --> 03:03:58.340]  they rely on the coalition bill.
[03:03:58.340 --> 03:03:59.340]  Stop it, stop it, stop it.
[03:03:59.340 --> 03:04:00.340]  I can't take it anymore.
[03:04:00.340 --> 03:04:01.340]  I can't take it anymore.
[03:04:01.340 --> 03:04:02.340]  Yes.
[03:04:02.340 --> 03:04:10.140]  Oh, oh, the intellectual genius of Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez on Podcast America.
[03:04:10.140 --> 03:04:14.940]  Yeah, yeah, because like, there's no real issues in America like poverty and homelessness.
[03:04:14.940 --> 03:04:19.260]  So by the way, I think nine police officers have committed suicide this month, hundreds
[03:04:19.260 --> 03:04:21.860]  of veterans are committing suicide all the time.
[03:04:21.860 --> 03:04:25.580]  We've got, you know, on the verge of international conflicts that could break out.
[03:04:25.580 --> 03:04:30.820]  I don't think a bomb cares about what color your skin is, but no, no, no, no, no, racism
[03:04:30.820 --> 03:04:31.820]  is the big thing.
[03:04:31.820 --> 03:04:36.420]  We all need to talk about it, because I'm on Podcast America with Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez.
[03:04:36.420 --> 03:04:37.420]  Wow.
[03:04:37.420 --> 03:04:39.660]  All right, well, I got good news.
[03:04:39.660 --> 03:04:44.340]  I'm signing off, and Matt Bracken is taking over, and in fact, I'm going to take a little
[03:04:44.340 --> 03:04:46.540]  vacation starting right now.
[03:04:46.540 --> 03:04:48.300]  Alex Jones will be back tomorrow.
[03:04:48.300 --> 03:04:50.820]  I'm checking out, and I don't know.
[03:04:50.820 --> 03:04:51.980]  I'm going into the clown world.
[03:04:51.980 --> 03:04:56.260]  I may never come back.

[03:05:55.100 --> 03:06:21.860]  Well, what a show today.
[03:06:21.860 --> 03:06:28.580]  The bar is set very high, watching Alex from remote and Owen in the studio.
[03:06:28.580 --> 03:06:34.900]  It's amazing how good the sound was with Alex on remote, really good video and audio.
[03:06:34.900 --> 03:06:41.940]  I have to salute Owen for the terrific job, getting the interview with the Google engineer
[03:06:41.940 --> 03:06:53.100]  Zach Voorheiss, who just took it from Project Veritas' very good canned stuff and brought
[03:06:53.100 --> 03:06:54.100]  him in live.
[03:06:54.100 --> 03:06:55.340]  The guy is very brave.
[03:06:55.340 --> 03:07:01.060]  I just did a quick Google search on the engineer, and guess what?
[03:07:01.060 --> 03:07:02.940]  He's a terrible person.
[03:07:02.940 --> 03:07:07.460]  Just look at the first five links on Google.
[03:07:07.460 --> 03:07:11.980]  If you look up Google engineer, he's a terrible person.
[03:07:11.980 --> 03:07:13.900]  You shouldn't listen to him.
[03:07:13.900 --> 03:07:15.500]  He's a really bad guy.
[03:07:15.500 --> 03:07:18.780]  Isn't it amazing how that works?
[03:07:18.780 --> 03:07:22.140]  But anyway, great job, Owen, with that interview.
[03:07:22.140 --> 03:07:24.460]  Everybody should watch it.
[03:07:24.460 --> 03:07:31.820]  Like it was said, download the zip file and get these things out so that they can never
[03:07:31.820 --> 03:07:41.140]  be disappeared the way that Epstein's testimony has disappeared and has any blackmail documents
[03:07:41.140 --> 03:07:44.740]  or videos seem to have disappeared.
[03:07:44.740 --> 03:07:52.260]  We'll see in the coming days and weeks if Epstein had any dead man switches, you know,
[03:07:52.260 --> 03:07:55.940]  thumb drives sent to 100 media people, things like that.
[03:07:55.940 --> 03:07:56.940]  Probably not.
[03:07:56.940 --> 03:07:59.140]  I tend to think not.
[03:07:59.140 --> 03:08:02.060]  Epstein, I guess he thought he was untouchable.
[03:08:02.060 --> 03:08:07.700]  He was still living in New York and flying freely around the world when he was arrested.
[03:08:07.700 --> 03:08:12.780]  It seems amazing to me that he didn't years ago bug out to someplace with no extradition
[03:08:12.780 --> 03:08:19.060]  treaty where he could buy off the local establishment, maybe even get plastic surgery.
[03:08:19.060 --> 03:08:24.260]  You know, the fact that he was thinking that he was untouchable, he must have thought that
[03:08:24.260 --> 03:08:30.980]  he had very good security from his blackmail videos, but evidently not.
[03:08:30.980 --> 03:08:37.820]  And they put him in a place where whether he committed suicide or was strangled by somebody
[03:08:37.820 --> 03:08:41.340]  that they led into the cell, we'll never know for sure.
[03:08:41.340 --> 03:08:46.100]  I would certainly doubt that he committed suicide.
[03:08:46.100 --> 03:08:51.540]  But just the fact that they had him in a place like that where he was just dead meat counting
[03:08:51.540 --> 03:08:55.420]  down the days until his lips would be sealed forever.
[03:08:55.420 --> 03:09:01.660]  There were a lot of powerful people that probably are on those blackmail videos.
[03:09:01.660 --> 03:09:06.140]  And now they're sleeping a little bit better, but maybe there'll be some other things.
[03:09:06.140 --> 03:09:11.700]  You know, this Maxwell woman who is not only one of the procurers, you might say she's
[03:09:11.700 --> 03:09:19.420]  a seductress, like a break in to break in the new girls, very similar in a sense in
[03:09:19.420 --> 03:09:25.780]  a way to the way that Harvey Weinstein operated, you know, Harvey Weinstein or the elderly
[03:09:25.780 --> 03:09:32.220]  Mr. Epstein, they're not exactly Brad Pitt, you know, in terms of the sex appeal.
[03:09:32.220 --> 03:09:38.500]  So what you do is you have female handlers to sort of smooth the path and show them the
[03:09:38.500 --> 03:09:42.620]  way, shall we say, and these women are still out there.
[03:09:42.620 --> 03:09:49.100]  They might have their own blackmail video files that they can bring in at some point.
[03:09:49.100 --> 03:09:55.380]  Not to mention going going down to Pito Island, Lolita Island.
[03:09:55.380 --> 03:09:59.500]  It's really been great seeing the drone video.
[03:09:59.500 --> 03:10:05.180]  Paul Joseph Watson has some good stories up on info wars and summit news about the changing
[03:10:05.180 --> 03:10:10.020]  windows, you know, where the computers are shown and then the computers are gone.
[03:10:10.020 --> 03:10:16.540]  And then weeks later, you know, the FBI shows up the famous but incompetent faking bogus
[03:10:16.540 --> 03:10:23.260]  investigations FBI, the same guys that like waited a month after Benghazi to get in there
[03:10:23.260 --> 03:10:26.860]  and and recover any lost documents.
[03:10:26.860 --> 03:10:32.320]  This was like weeks after independent journalists had gone into the Benghazi consulate.
[03:10:32.320 --> 03:10:39.460]  But no, the FBI gives them weeks to either clean up the place or plant new fake evidence.
[03:10:39.460 --> 03:10:45.820]  So it's one more thing giving us more and more reasons not to trust our government,
[03:10:45.820 --> 03:10:48.660]  not to have confidence or faith in them.
[03:10:48.660 --> 03:10:53.660]  And if anything comes out of Epstein at all, because I don't think he's his blackmail videos
[03:10:53.660 --> 03:10:56.820]  are ever going to probably see the light of day.
[03:10:56.820 --> 03:11:02.940]  It's been a massive red pill for the American normies, people that just don't want to believe
[03:11:02.940 --> 03:11:09.300]  like guys like Hannity, you know, 99% of the FBI, they're just great, they're really working
[03:11:09.300 --> 03:11:10.300]  hard.
[03:11:10.300 --> 03:11:11.300]  They're just great guys.
[03:11:11.300 --> 03:11:16.620]  Well, Hannity, I guess you could say is for all the great work he's done on exposing the
[03:11:16.620 --> 03:11:22.300]  rush to collusion hoax, he's still basically at heart a normie, you know, and and he's
[03:11:22.300 --> 03:11:27.660]  kind of member of the establishment in his own way, which we saw where he's he came to
[03:11:27.660 --> 03:11:35.340]  the defense of Frito Cuomo over Cuomo getting jumped very mildly compared to conservatives
[03:11:35.340 --> 03:11:40.420]  that have had drinks thrown on them, you had mobs just screaming at them and chasing them
[03:11:40.420 --> 03:11:45.860]  out of restaurants, a couple goofballs come up in a kind of a friendly way, call him Frito
[03:11:45.860 --> 03:11:49.140]  Cuomo, he totally loses it.
[03:11:49.140 --> 03:11:53.340]  And this is this is something I wanted to to mention this because I really hadn't seen
[03:11:53.340 --> 03:11:56.660]  this aspect, of course, I don't watch all media all the time.
[03:11:56.660 --> 03:12:03.580]  But the biggest mistake that Frito Cuomo made was in branding himself for the rest of his
[03:12:03.580 --> 03:12:09.820]  life as Frito, the weak moron younger brother, you will give him a job at the casino, he'll
[03:12:09.820 --> 03:12:14.660]  think he's running it, we'll give him a job on CNN, he'll think he's an anchor, you know,
[03:12:14.660 --> 03:12:20.620]  he's just a conduit for the for the deep state and for, you know, left left wing causes.
[03:12:20.620 --> 03:12:26.460]  And but he'll think he's an anchor, so he totally owns the Frito label for the rest
[03:12:26.460 --> 03:12:27.460]  of his life.
[03:12:27.460 --> 03:12:33.060]  But going back to my youth, I was a I took Taekwondo from a when I was in a high school
[03:12:33.060 --> 03:12:42.060]  from an old Korean guy, tall Korean hardcore, he told me back in Korea, they practiced outside
[03:12:42.060 --> 03:12:49.140]  snow, summer, ice, anything on gravel, they would do fist push ups, tiger push ups, all
[03:12:49.140 --> 03:12:51.460]  seasons on on gravel.
[03:12:51.460 --> 03:12:57.860]  Well, in the in the dojang, that's what they call a dojo for Taekwondo, I guess it's Korean,
[03:12:57.860 --> 03:13:03.020]  in the dojang, he didn't want us to have our mouth open up, you know, your hyperventilation
[03:13:03.020 --> 03:13:05.500]  you're you're you're working out.
[03:13:05.500 --> 03:13:09.260]  He wanted us to be breathing through our nose.
[03:13:09.260 --> 03:13:14.620]  And the way he explained it in his in his not so great English, you don't want to let
[03:13:14.620 --> 03:13:20.260]  your enemy, your adversary, ever see that you're struggling, that you're afraid, that
[03:13:20.260 --> 03:13:26.380]  you're winded, you know, you want to show your same game face, your war face all the
[03:13:26.380 --> 03:13:28.500]  time to your adversaries.
[03:13:28.500 --> 03:13:35.940]  And what Frito Cuomo did was expose his weakness, he flipped out over being called Frito.
[03:13:35.940 --> 03:13:41.180]  And as a result, for the rest of his life, that's going to be the number one search result
[03:13:41.180 --> 03:13:43.980]  for for him is going to be Frito.
[03:13:43.980 --> 03:13:50.540]  So in terms of our own selves, in terms of your own, you know, self improvement or how
[03:13:50.540 --> 03:13:56.860]  you look at life, never let them see a sweat, you know, don't don't show your weakness.
[03:13:56.860 --> 03:14:01.300]  If you're if you're going to have a moment of weakness, do it in private.
[03:14:01.300 --> 03:14:05.740]  You know, if somebody gets up in your face, the thing that he should have done is just
[03:14:05.740 --> 03:14:09.020]  say, hey, look, fellas, I'm here with my family, can you guys chill out and then even
[03:14:09.020 --> 03:14:10.420]  just walk away.
[03:14:10.420 --> 03:14:15.940]  But he actually he actually empowered his enemies by showing so much of his weakness.
[03:14:15.940 --> 03:14:16.940]  All right.
[03:14:16.940 --> 03:14:22.180]  Today, I've got I've got a whole wide range of things to talk about, you know, the global
[03:14:22.180 --> 03:14:28.420]  elites, the crisis in Hong Kong, the red flag laws, now the Democrats are openly talking
[03:14:28.420 --> 03:14:33.660]  about gun confiscation, which they call a buyback, which makes no sense.
[03:14:33.660 --> 03:14:38.180]  It's totally Orwellian Newspeak, because they never they never owned my guns.
[03:14:38.180 --> 03:14:39.860]  They can't buy them back.
[03:14:39.860 --> 03:14:45.300]  What they're talking about is confiscation now, not only so called assault weapons, they're
[03:14:45.300 --> 03:14:53.540]  talking about all semi-automatics, you know, the up with the Las Vegas kill count.
[03:14:53.540 --> 03:14:56.980]  I think the next biggest was the Pulse nightclub.
[03:14:56.980 --> 03:14:58.140]  That was pistols.
[03:14:58.140 --> 03:14:59.380]  That was Glock's.
[03:14:59.380 --> 03:15:06.420]  So now the liberals are talking about an assault weapon assault weapons ban and all semi-automatics.
[03:15:06.420 --> 03:15:08.660]  They don't distinguish rifle or pistol.
[03:15:08.660 --> 03:15:10.180]  We'll see where that goes.
[03:15:10.180 --> 03:15:16.060]  I've got some some more on Paddle Island, and I'd also like to talk today about this
[03:15:16.060 --> 03:15:24.740]  film, The Hunt, which I started exploring into this this film and uncovered a huge goldmine
[03:15:24.740 --> 03:15:31.980]  of information about the producer of The Hunt, who's a guy named Jason Bloom, who also produced
[03:15:31.980 --> 03:15:34.220]  the Purge series.
[03:15:34.220 --> 03:15:39.740]  And it seems like he's got a consistent theme, which we'll get in when we'll come to when
[03:15:39.740 --> 03:15:41.100]  we get back.
[03:15:41.100 --> 03:15:46.740]  And we'll see you on the other side of the break and you've got me for the whole hour.

[03:17:23.860 --> 03:17:27.780]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.

[03:18:03.660 --> 03:18:08.340]  unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen but I wanted to take just a minute out here

[03:18:12.060 --> 03:18:16.020]  lies against us last week the worst things you can say about people that you knew they

[03:18:40.820 --> 03:18:45.100]  in this fight we're being used by God you're being used by God this is Providence so I
[03:18:45.100 --> 03:18:50.580]  salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart Infowars
[03:18:50.580 --> 03:18:58.700]  the most banned network in the world Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that
[03:18:58.700 --> 03:19:02.460]  when our republic was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that were close to the
[03:19:02.460 --> 03:19:06.780]  ground close to reality who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the
[03:19:06.780 --> 03:19:12.460]  nation and today the communist Chinese have banned all US farming goods a week ago and
[03:19:12.460 --> 03:19:17.060]  we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's doing in
[03:19:17.060 --> 03:19:22.820]  this trade war once China put pressure on our farmers that's beautiful Americans aren't
[03:19:22.820 --> 03:19:27.820]  going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down so to the walking cruises and the
[03:19:27.820 --> 03:19:31.660]  Hillary Clinton's the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down
[03:19:31.660 --> 03:19:35.700]  we're never going to give up and all you've done is awaken the human spirit and the human
[03:19:35.700 --> 03:19:41.500]  spirit lives at info wars dot com and news wars dot com and I'm asking listeners whatever
[03:19:41.500 --> 03:19:46.380]  you do spread those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the resistance
[03:19:46.380 --> 03:20:11.220]  we are 1776 worldwide you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:11.220 --> 03:20:36.380]  it's almost impossible to overstate how disruptive trump has been to the to the new global world
[03:20:36.380 --> 03:20:42.940]  order he is he came out of like another another universe that he stepped through another dimension
[03:20:42.940 --> 03:20:51.860]  they act the left thought that they had Hillary's election sewn up for sure and we don't know
[03:20:51.860 --> 03:20:58.140]  if trump is going to be reelected war could break out at any time you know with Hong Kong
[03:20:58.140 --> 03:21:06.260]  cashmere other places Iran straights of Hormuz and as a mr. solenti said in the last hour
[03:21:06.260 --> 03:21:12.980]  when the when the bankers are in a panic war is always the best reset button is if you
[03:21:12.980 --> 03:21:19.420]  burn down the entire global financial system then all the paper is gone and that means
[03:21:19.420 --> 03:21:24.900]  all the culpability for wrecking the economy in the first place it's gone the people who
[03:21:24.900 --> 03:21:31.860]  own real property the diamonds and the gold those people after the after the ashes cool
[03:21:31.860 --> 03:21:37.020]  off you know they they think that they can return from Patagonia or wherever they've
[03:21:37.020 --> 03:21:42.460]  been hiding out you know running generators they think that they can return and depending
[03:21:42.460 --> 03:21:47.380]  on which countries because they're usually very diversified they've got properties everywhere
[03:21:47.380 --> 03:21:53.460]  depending on which countries regain stability first they'll go back and they'll try to buy
[03:21:53.460 --> 03:22:00.180]  off whatever political order is reestablished to get the the local establishment to recognize
[03:22:00.180 --> 03:22:05.540]  their property deeds now in some countries they may have just been their properties might
[03:22:05.540 --> 03:22:10.340]  have just been seized they might have been turned into communal collective farms but
[03:22:10.340 --> 03:22:15.780]  in another country they might be able to buy off the politicians and get their deeds their
[03:22:15.780 --> 03:22:23.540]  deeds a property they're they're right to own the land reasserted push out the squatters and just can
[03:22:23.540 --> 03:22:29.780]  carry on but this time without the overhanging debt burden which has been burned up in the in
[03:22:29.780 --> 03:22:36.660]  this world war is coming potential world war three now something that everybody needs to
[03:22:36.660 --> 03:22:43.220]  to consider very carefully and and mr. Salanti hinted at this when he was talking about you
[03:22:43.220 --> 03:22:50.980]  know guns gold and the get at getaway plan what if there's a war this time it's not going to be
[03:22:50.980 --> 03:22:56.660]  like world war two where it's fought over in some other continent and back here in America all we
[03:22:56.660 --> 03:23:02.980]  have is some rationing cards and you know a little bit of hardship but really not much the next war
[03:23:03.860 --> 03:23:09.460]  that may or may not involve missiles or nukes but for sure the next war is going to involve
[03:23:09.460 --> 03:23:15.380]  everybody doing cyber attacks on everybody else's electrical grid uh banking systems
[03:23:16.500 --> 03:23:22.340]  you know this means water won't flow food won't be distributed and our american cities
[03:23:22.340 --> 03:23:28.580]  and around the world as well our american cities will go absolutely haywire i mean haywire and
[03:23:28.580 --> 03:23:35.540]  when this happens it's not going to be like an elevator where you can fall from the 21st floor
[03:23:35.540 --> 03:23:42.020]  but hit the button and stop somewhere in the 20th century or the 19th century all of the infrastructure
[03:23:42.020 --> 03:23:49.460]  that existed to support a 1950s economy you know the sears robot catalog uh that kind of thing it's
[03:23:49.460 --> 03:23:56.020]  gone that doesn't exist anymore you can't stop at the 19th century you know the the cast iron
[03:23:56.020 --> 03:24:02.820]  plows and cast iron machinery those factories are gone so if we go into an economic freefall
[03:24:02.820 --> 03:24:11.220]  we can continue falling and and god only knows where we'll end up i i wrote a a almost a novella
[03:24:11.220 --> 03:24:16.420]  a short story you can just google it and find it on the internet called a last brave new Babylon
[03:24:16.420 --> 03:24:22.100]  kind of a worst-case scenario but in it for everybody and and we don't want that obviously
[03:24:22.100 --> 03:24:25.300]  but i don't think that next war is going to be a matter of a little belt tightening
[03:24:26.180 --> 03:24:32.260]  and we'll get back to normal it could go really crazy off the rails and to that end
[03:24:32.260 --> 03:24:37.380]  i don't even think that having a water purifier is enough because i would say more than half of
[03:24:37.380 --> 03:24:43.860]  americans they're on city water of some kind or another if there's no power for for days weeks
[03:24:43.860 --> 03:24:49.700]  or months there's not going to be city water so just fill in your bathtub yeah that'll that'll
[03:24:49.700 --> 03:24:55.460]  get you through the weekend or maybe a week but then what i mean it can get extremely ugly
[03:24:55.460 --> 03:25:01.220]  extremely fast and that's where you know you need to think about things to prolong your life
[03:25:01.220 --> 03:25:06.340]  where you don't need to go out like a gazelle going to the watering hole that's surrounded by
[03:25:06.340 --> 03:25:11.780]  lions and crocodiles which will be you know your eluded local supermarket if you're the dad and
[03:25:11.780 --> 03:25:16.820]  you're trying to go out and find food for your starving kids and so is everybody else and so
[03:25:16.820 --> 03:25:23.220]  are the bad guys you want to be able to stay home for weeks or months that means food water
[03:25:23.220 --> 03:25:29.220]  all kind of supplies a lot of which you can find in the info war store frankly things that can preserve
[03:25:29.220 --> 03:25:34.340]  your food preserve your life and if you're if you aren't drinking ditch water or from the local stream
[03:25:34.340 --> 03:25:39.700]  you are going to want those filters you are going to want your your um your long-term survival food
[03:25:39.700 --> 03:25:44.660]  because you know if you have to go to the supermarket which is surrounded by eluders and
[03:25:44.660 --> 03:25:51.220]  shooters you know you may not come back to your family so seriously these are very perilous times
[03:25:51.220 --> 03:25:57.060]  we all hope that it never happens but like like jerald solenti said it's if you buy this stuff it's
[03:25:57.060 --> 03:26:01.780]  like insurance you hope you never need it you stockpile it it's good for 20 years you and you
[03:26:01.780 --> 03:26:07.460]  hope you never need it but by god if you need it and you don't have it and you have to go out
[03:26:07.460 --> 03:26:13.860]  scrounging for food with all the other starving people it's going to be real ugly real fast and
[03:26:14.740 --> 03:26:19.460]  some of the dynamics that are building up that that were mentioned in the last hour
[03:26:20.420 --> 03:26:24.580]  when when the chinese are moving all these troops to the border of hong kong
[03:26:24.580 --> 03:26:30.100]  that there was a similar type of a dynamic not quite exactly it's not a perfect parallel but
[03:26:30.100 --> 03:26:37.140]  in 1914 the european armies moved those armies up to the to the borders of their adversaries
[03:26:37.140 --> 03:26:41.700]  well then you can't just keep them there they're not robots that you switch on and switch off
[03:26:41.700 --> 03:26:46.020]  these are human beings that have to be fed and and housed they they're you know coming from
[03:26:46.020 --> 03:26:52.180]  bases all over china you get into a posture where if you remove them it's going to look like a
[03:26:52.180 --> 03:26:58.180]  back down and if you just keep them there it's very difficult so there's going to be a lot of
[03:26:58.180 --> 03:27:03.060]  pressure for the chinese to move into hong kong and i don't expect to see all those trucks and
[03:27:03.060 --> 03:27:08.420]  armored personnel carriers going in immediately i think that even right now as we're speaking
[03:27:08.980 --> 03:27:15.940]  the chinese version of the russian men with green faces you know these are these are troops that are
[03:27:15.940 --> 03:27:22.020]  like chinese spetsnaz that are going to be wearing civilian clothes easily able to infiltrate
[03:27:22.020 --> 03:27:28.020]  into hong kong and then they can they can either you know set up watch positions be in positions
[03:27:28.020 --> 03:27:33.620]  to throw the switches on communication and electronics you know commandos with uh technical
[03:27:33.620 --> 03:27:41.220]  training or kidnap leaders of the resistance um do false flag operations snipe at hong kong police
[03:27:41.220 --> 03:27:47.140]  which will then be blamed on on the uh chinese uh you know freedom resistance all of this is
[03:27:47.140 --> 03:27:55.140]  happening right now i promise you in this system this uh scenario where you see the the uh uniformed
[03:27:55.140 --> 03:28:02.580]  troops moving up to the border you can bet already the chinese special ops troops not in uniform
[03:28:02.580 --> 03:28:08.740]  already fanning out all through hong kong so it's you know god bless these guys that are brave enough
[03:28:08.740 --> 03:28:15.140]  to go out day after day uh wave in american flags which is really poking a stick in the eye of the
[03:28:15.140 --> 03:28:21.380]  chinese dragon for that to be on world television that takes a lot of courage to do that and living
[03:28:21.380 --> 03:28:26.980]  here off the fat of the land in the united states of america if things go seriously haywire in this
[03:28:26.980 --> 03:28:33.780]  country say after trump loses an election and we wind up with uh gun confiscation under kamala harris
[03:28:33.780 --> 03:28:39.460]  will we be as brave you know it's time to do an inside look and a gut check and when we come back
[03:28:39.460 --> 03:28:44.900]  i'm gonna talk about uh some gun confiscation scenarios that are going to be unfolding in front
[03:28:44.900 --> 03:28:51.700]  of our eyes going forward

[03:31:36.100 --> 03:31:42.020]  lives at info wars dot com and news wars dot com and i'm asking listeners whatever you do spread
[03:31:42.020 --> 03:31:48.660]  those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the resistance we are 1776 worldwide
[03:31:54.660 --> 03:31:59.060]  it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in the public square the other thing
[03:31:59.060 --> 03:32:04.340]  that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a
[03:32:04.340 --> 03:32:08.740]  corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire that's not being
[03:32:08.740 --> 03:32:12.980]  funded by a secret foreign government it is completely independent of all that it is an old
[03:32:12.980 --> 03:32:18.500]  school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom
[03:32:18.500 --> 03:32:22.420]  of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country
[03:32:22.420 --> 03:32:26.820]  they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was
[03:32:26.820 --> 03:32:30.740]  the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been
[03:32:30.740 --> 03:32:35.620]  co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[03:32:35.620 --> 03:32:40.820]  what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has
[03:32:40.820 --> 03:32:45.700]  broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate
[03:32:45.700 --> 03:32:49.940]  american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the
[03:32:49.940 --> 03:32:59.780]  platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:32:59.780 --> 03:33:24.100]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host matt bracken
[03:33:24.100 --> 03:33:37.300]  it's um pretty amusing watching alexandria or casio court uh cortez talking about racism in
[03:33:37.300 --> 03:33:45.780]  america and what we see from the left constantly is a total lack of self-awareness and just an
[03:33:45.780 --> 03:33:52.420]  amazing level of projection you know when she's calling everything racist if you're not if you're
[03:33:52.420 --> 03:33:59.060]  basically if you're not a communist you're a racist if you're a black guy who hates communism
[03:33:59.060 --> 03:34:04.420]  you're a self-hating black because you should be you know you should be automatically with the left
[03:34:05.220 --> 03:34:10.420]  that was her one of her the other squad you know if you're a if you're a black you got to be
[03:34:10.420 --> 03:34:16.180]  speaking like us if you're if you're hispanic you got to be speaking like us they have absolutely
[03:34:16.180 --> 03:34:23.220]  no self-awareness about the dangerous identity politics road they're taking this country down and
[03:34:23.220 --> 03:34:29.620]  you know that i would say that that cortez i like to call her cortez instead of aoc which is kind of
[03:34:29.620 --> 03:34:37.140]  giving her too much cred like lbj or jfk i just like to call her cortez because cortez was a pure
[03:34:37.140 --> 03:34:45.460]  blood spanish conquistador who came to the new world and wiped out the aztecs so i like to just
[03:34:45.460 --> 03:34:53.540]  remind her of her of her spanish white conquistador roots with her name cortez it's all i call her
[03:34:53.540 --> 03:35:02.980]  cortez so cortez has been leading the drumbeat calling um ice facilities concentration camps
[03:35:02.980 --> 03:35:08.980]  we know what that means concentration camp in the in now modern vernacular terminology means
[03:35:08.980 --> 03:35:15.700]  means a nazi death camp it means dot cal or al-switz we know what we're supposed to do when we're
[03:35:15.700 --> 03:35:22.260]  confronted with the real evil of real nazis like the al-switz guys you're supposed to kill them
[03:35:22.260 --> 03:35:28.180]  that's where we saw a attempted bombing in the northwest against an ice facility the guy was
[03:35:28.180 --> 03:35:34.820]  trying to set fire to a you know a giant uh you know like 500 gallon propane tank i'm not sure how
[03:35:34.820 --> 03:35:41.220]  big it was but a big propane tank his goal was to light that thing off and just a day or two ago
[03:35:41.220 --> 03:35:47.700]  we saw in san antonio somebody firing at the specific floors of ice in a federal building in
[03:35:47.700 --> 03:35:55.380]  san antonio which means a rifleman somebody who had uh you know studied the range knew how to count
[03:35:55.380 --> 03:36:00.740]  the floors which isn't always obvious because sometimes the ground level floor may or may not
[03:36:00.740 --> 03:36:05.540]  count as a garage or the first deck and it is so just counting windows is not always going to get
[03:36:05.540 --> 03:36:12.340]  you to the right answer somebody did some recon they put aimed rifle shots into the ice offices
[03:36:12.340 --> 03:36:19.460]  this is really an act of civil war or insurrection it's way beyond sedition so i mean we actually
[03:36:19.460 --> 03:36:27.300]  have have uh in the constitution sedition is mentioned i believe but people like aoc calling ice
[03:36:27.300 --> 03:36:33.060]  you know not see concentration camp guards is going to get them killed and it's already resulted
[03:36:33.060 --> 03:36:39.540]  in rifle fire the guy who shot at the ice building in san antonio i promise you that's not as far as
[03:36:39.540 --> 03:36:47.140]  he's going to go that's his that's the stage that he's at developmentally this week but he is not
[03:36:47.140 --> 03:36:52.260]  going to stop in portland this weekend there's going to be another big uh face off between
[03:36:52.260 --> 03:37:00.260]  antifa and the uh proud boy types and i think that we're going to see an escalation to the next
[03:37:00.260 --> 03:37:07.700]  level where somebody is going to pop off rounds and i say that because if you if you fire into a
[03:37:07.700 --> 03:37:15.540]  crowd it's the easiest false flag in the world remember communists like you know radical islamists
[03:37:15.540 --> 03:37:23.060]  they believe that the ends justify the means so any tactic that results in in uh your cause
[03:37:23.060 --> 03:37:29.460]  being furthered is good no matter what you have to do so if you have to lie about whether you're a
[03:37:29.460 --> 03:37:35.940]  communist or not sure that's fine it's perfectly okay likewise if you have to shoot a couple of
[03:37:35.940 --> 03:37:42.340]  your comrades and then leave literature blaming the proud boys they'll do it you know they're
[03:37:42.340 --> 03:37:48.180]  they've all already um been talking about going in going in among the uh proud boys side you know
[03:37:48.180 --> 03:37:55.460]  with the trump hats uh you know wearing a mega hats and and mega gear in order to provoke violence
[03:37:55.460 --> 03:38:00.340]  that'll be blamed on the proud boys this is the kind of tactic we're going to be seeing and i can't
[03:38:00.340 --> 03:38:06.340]  emphasize enough how important it is this ice facility being shot with a rifle from a distance
[03:38:06.340 --> 03:38:12.900]  it's not the it's the first maybe shot of an of an opening stages of what could be a civil war
[03:38:12.900 --> 03:38:17.860]  you know the the elites are extremely desperate and they're going to stop at nothing to see that
[03:38:17.860 --> 03:38:23.540]  trump is unelected they'll wreck the economy they'll talk down the economy in any way they can they'll
[03:38:23.540 --> 03:38:31.860]  sabotage trump trying to lead to his uh being uh uh you're not reelected and in that vein talking
[03:38:31.860 --> 03:38:38.260]  about cortez and the squad and her constant calls of that everybody on our side is a racist
[03:38:39.060 --> 03:38:45.700]  i was studying this um this film that's now supposedly not going to be released in september
[03:38:45.700 --> 03:38:52.900]  called the hunt and i was looking at it from the point of view of you know in previous genocides
[03:38:52.900 --> 03:39:00.420]  where socialists you know mostly international socialists aka communists but also national
[03:39:00.420 --> 03:39:08.180]  socialists before a genocide they always demonize and scapegoat their enemy and i looked into this
[03:39:08.180 --> 03:39:17.300]  film and i found a a just a one or two frame shot that has a bulletin board picture of the people
[03:39:17.300 --> 03:39:23.940]  that are being hunted and it's hard to see because it's kind of dark but you but you can see on this
[03:39:23.940 --> 03:39:31.140]  on this um bulletin board that there's a rhino hunter who looks suspiciously like uh like ted
[03:39:31.140 --> 03:39:38.820]  nugent and there's a and there's a um a talk show host who could be you know alex jones or a rush
[03:39:38.820 --> 03:39:44.820]  limbaugh guy with a microphone and there are as a guy there's a guy with a tiki torch you know
[03:39:44.820 --> 03:39:50.980]  that's the charlotte'sville nazis but then you've just got like a some guy standing on the capital
[03:39:50.980 --> 03:39:56.980]  steps poly politicians or lobbyists you see a lady with a long gun standing in front of an
[03:39:56.980 --> 03:40:03.620]  american flag you know you see a campaign worker and it says behind her range which i think in the
[03:40:03.620 --> 03:40:10.580]  film context is trump so these are the types of people that the left think it's legitimate to
[03:40:10.580 --> 03:40:19.380]  kidnap drug take to some some uh manner and then hunt and murder and i and i i was looking at writing
[03:40:19.380 --> 03:40:25.060]  something about this i'm writing for a website now called american partisan it's been out for a year
[03:40:25.060 --> 03:40:29.940]  or two um they've been inviting me to come over and i'm i'm writing writing for them now but i was
[03:40:29.940 --> 03:40:34.340]  going to write something about the hunt and then it got canceled but in my research i found this
[03:40:34.340 --> 03:40:40.900]  amazing thread where the producer of the hunt he's a guy named jason bloom he's about 50 years old
[03:40:41.620 --> 03:40:48.500]  he came out of vassar college extreme left-wing college sjw university type of place he goes to
[03:40:48.500 --> 03:40:55.380]  work for miramax as a as a a mentee under the tutelage of none under none other than harvey
[03:40:55.380 --> 03:41:02.340]  Weinstein you know the rapist and democrat party bundler and donor and fundraiser then he goes to
[03:41:02.340 --> 03:41:11.220]  work for universal all of his pictures have a common theme they they all portray america as this
[03:41:11.220 --> 03:41:19.220]  evil horrible place uncle sam with an ak-47 uh you know the white cops tracking down and
[03:41:19.220 --> 03:41:25.220]  killing blacks these these are films primarily he's known for the purge you can see on that purge
[03:41:25.220 --> 03:41:30.900]  election year picture it says keep america great like that's a real hint you see on the left you
[03:41:30.900 --> 03:41:36.100]  know it's somebody's just blowing away a black chick who's on who's on the ground this all of his
[03:41:36.100 --> 03:41:45.780]  films feature white guys hunting down and murdering minorities in the in the in the uh in the the um
[03:41:45.780 --> 03:41:54.420]  purge series a group called the new american founding fathers has taken over their white racist
[03:41:54.420 --> 03:42:01.380]  you know uh evil people and what he what bloom is doing is conflating the founding fathers
[03:42:01.380 --> 03:42:09.220]  you know george washington etc with evil racist nazi like slave owning bastards who all they want
[03:42:09.220 --> 03:42:15.780]  to do is go out and murder minorities this is a deep level of propaganda and people say matt well
[03:42:15.780 --> 03:42:21.940]  there's been movies like death wish and there's been you know movie uh slasher films like halloween
[03:42:21.940 --> 03:42:29.620]  but not like jason bloom's films because what they do is intermingle the gory slasher stuff
[03:42:29.620 --> 03:42:38.340]  with a very anti-american anti-white you know just a a a message that's designed to stoke racial
[03:42:38.340 --> 03:42:45.380]  hatred and i you know it's very lucrative the guy's rich but look what it's doing to our country
[03:42:45.380 --> 03:42:48.980]  and i'm gonna get more into this when i come back at the other side of this break

[03:45:35.780 --> 03:45:41.700]  lives at info wars dot com and news wars dot com and i'm asking listeners whatever you do spread
[03:45:41.700 --> 03:45:48.340]  those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the resistance we are 1776 worldwide
[03:45:48.340 --> 03:45:59.220]  without your support we won't be here and i couldn't thank you all enough for the fact
[03:45:59.220 --> 03:46:03.060]  that you've kept us in the game i mean i want to stay in this game i want to take the globalist on
[03:46:03.060 --> 03:46:07.620]  total transparency is our whole operation if i bring in 35 million dollars half of that's the
[03:46:07.620 --> 03:46:11.700]  cost of the products because we don't mark stuff up that much i don't care if i'm not making money
[03:46:11.700 --> 03:46:16.020]  but you need to buy the products we got coffee we got fish oil we got turmeric we got great
[03:46:16.020 --> 03:46:20.820]  toothpaste we've got great things like dna force plus but ultimate krill oil has been sold out for
[03:46:20.820 --> 03:46:24.980]  four months for whatever reason this became the most popular fish oil it's totally full of the
[03:46:24.980 --> 03:46:30.900]  bottle and it is the strongest purest krill oil and it cost us three times more because we have it
[03:46:30.900 --> 03:46:36.260]  put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury any kind of krill oil you get that
[03:46:36.260 --> 03:46:40.740]  doesn't give you fish burps which i don't like but gives you all the great benefits isn't real it's
[03:46:40.740 --> 03:46:45.780]  been boiled it's been ruined it's been homogenized this is not good this ladies and gentlemen is the
[03:46:45.780 --> 03:46:50.340]  highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere real krill oil folks is red it's not
[03:46:50.340 --> 03:47:12.260]  yellow it's not milky this is nothing but krill oil you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:12.260 --> 03:47:25.380]  okay i'm going to continue now with uh this dive into the world of hollywood twisted psychodrama
[03:47:25.380 --> 03:47:33.860]  that generations of americans are just swallowing but it's really been getting worse in a in a
[03:47:33.860 --> 03:47:41.620]  very distinct way recently i've heard people say when i talk about this film the hunt but
[03:47:41.620 --> 03:47:48.020]  matt you know what about death wish it's just another revenge flick in death wish charles bronson's
[03:47:48.020 --> 03:47:53.380]  character his wife and his daughter are like murdered by home invaders and the police can't
[03:47:53.380 --> 03:48:00.100]  find them and don't do anything he doesn't he gets a gun somebody gives him a revolver he goes out
[03:48:00.100 --> 03:48:06.340]  walking around the streets of new york and muggers attack him he shoots back this is in no way
[03:48:06.340 --> 03:48:14.500]  anything like the hunt where deplorable conservative red staters are kidnapped and hunted by liberals
[03:48:15.300 --> 03:48:20.740]  and in fact it's it's it said that the original title was going to be red state versus blue state
[03:48:21.380 --> 03:48:28.340]  and other people will say but matt there's always been slasher films these aren't just gory slasher
[03:48:28.340 --> 03:48:36.660]  films you know the purge of the hunt these are political films with a point and as far as the
[03:48:36.660 --> 03:48:42.100]  hunt people say yeah but matt in the trailer it looks like the blonde betty gilpin she kicks ass
[03:48:42.100 --> 03:48:48.740]  she turns the tables you know she she makes the blue state uh champagne sippers the caviar guys on
[03:48:48.740 --> 03:49:03.300]  the jet she she takes it to them hey there help you what state is this sorry you don't
[03:49:03.300 --> 03:49:11.300]  understand the question oh no i didn't most people know where they are why ain't most people you're
[03:49:11.300 --> 03:49:27.860]  in the glorious state arkansas sweetheart well this ain't arkansas so everyone is lying
[03:49:30.260 --> 03:49:37.060]  your idea is incredible they can't argue with that we pay for everything so this country belongs to us
[03:49:37.060 --> 03:49:44.660]  it's just business hunting human beings for sport they're not human beings
[03:49:49.460 --> 03:49:55.860]  every year a bunch of elites kidnapped normal folks like us where they get you from my only
[03:49:55.860 --> 03:50:06.740]  miss if they were laying though and hunt us for sport hurry hurry hurry up so it's true we're being
[03:50:06.740 --> 03:50:28.660]  hunted hey put him in the back with the rest now they can't see us you just told them we're here
[03:50:28.660 --> 03:50:39.700]  here what was that i think that was a right for
[03:50:39.700 --> 03:50:45.620]  who are these people how are they getting away with this you have no idea what you're up against
[03:50:49.060 --> 03:50:56.260]  they're playing you don't take the pieces we'll see of all the people you kidnapped
[03:50:56.260 --> 03:51:11.300]  of all the people you killed you picked the wrong game lady you're crazy
[03:51:16.340 --> 03:51:23.460]  okay a lot of folks like i was saying a lot of folks will say but matt they flipped the you know
[03:51:23.460 --> 03:51:30.020]  the the script flips on the against the blue the blue crazy people and the red state guys take
[03:51:30.020 --> 03:51:36.100]  them down that's true but as far as i'm concerned looking at jason blooms entire track record
[03:51:36.100 --> 03:51:42.740]  this is purely a fig leaf there's no way he could make a film where the blue state killers
[03:51:42.740 --> 03:51:47.620]  are shown as the heroes just tracking down and exterminating these under mention but they make
[03:51:47.620 --> 03:51:54.420]  their points along the way like where the the ted nugent rhino hunter is killed with arrows
[03:51:54.420 --> 03:52:00.820]  graphically up close so all through the movie what they're doing is desensitizing the viewers
[03:52:00.820 --> 03:52:06.260]  getting them used to the idea of hunting these deplorables sure that deplorables might in the
[03:52:06.260 --> 03:52:15.140]  end flip the switch um for a while but this is all designed to turn up the heat under the under the
[03:52:15.140 --> 03:52:22.420]  latent civil war the cold civil war there jason bloom his goal here is in every one of his movies
[03:52:22.420 --> 03:52:29.620]  stoke racial hatred stoke anti americanism any association with guns and firearms of american
[03:52:29.620 --> 03:52:36.820]  flag it's evil you know george washington uncle sam they're evil and that's his entire stick
[03:52:36.820 --> 03:52:42.500]  one of his movies that i saw recently is called get out it's a really good movie i mean it's well
[03:52:42.500 --> 03:52:49.060]  done in that sense but what is the what is the plot of get out some evil white guys that are very
[03:52:49.060 --> 03:52:54.980]  rich they trick and kidnap young black guys to coming out like you know you're my daughter's
[03:52:54.980 --> 03:53:01.220]  new boyfriend come out to our our estate somewhere in new england it looks like and then we chain you
[03:53:01.220 --> 03:53:07.060]  up in the basement and perform some kind of a lobotomy where we're going to put the mind of some
[03:53:07.060 --> 03:53:13.540]  old geriatric white person into the young healthy black guy and turn them into like a something
[03:53:13.540 --> 03:53:21.540]  like a zombie with the memory of the old white guy see all of his movies involve hatred for america
[03:53:22.100 --> 03:53:28.340]  hatred for whites and he's a white guy but he's making tons of money you know off of these films
[03:53:28.340 --> 03:53:33.780]  so there are people out there they don't care if they're stoking a civil war it doesn't matter
[03:53:33.780 --> 03:53:39.140]  as long as they've got their cash i guarantee you people like that they don't think this will
[03:53:39.140 --> 03:53:44.900]  ever touch them and it's it's getting really sick and it's not just in the films you know there's
[03:53:44.900 --> 03:53:51.220]  there's this guy named reza aslan he had a show on cnn kind of like trying to be a political
[03:53:51.220 --> 03:53:58.020]  anthony bordain but he got fired when the hindu's didn't appreciate him eating human brains on camera
[03:53:58.020 --> 03:54:03.860]  it's a long story but he's still a college professor in california and good standing
[03:54:03.860 --> 03:54:09.140]  teaching our you know students that are paying a fortune or taking loans to go out on for a fortune
[03:54:09.780 --> 03:54:16.420]  reza aslan he has tweets up that are unbelievable he is a blue check famous guy with thousands you
[03:54:16.420 --> 03:54:21.780]  know how many umpteen thousand followers he has a tweet that's still up i'm going to read it
[03:54:21.780 --> 03:54:28.660]  it after today there is no longer any room for nuance the president is a white nationalist terror
[03:54:28.660 --> 03:54:35.460]  leader his supporters all of them in caps are by definition white nationalist terror supporters
[03:54:35.460 --> 03:54:44.020]  the maga hat is a kkk hood and this evil racist scourge that's us trump voters this evil racist
[03:54:44.020 --> 03:54:51.620]  scourge must be eradicated from society twitter is cool with that you know i got perma band
[03:54:51.620 --> 03:54:58.020]  from twitter for posting a burqa meme that didn't even name a religion it just showed a succession
[03:54:58.020 --> 03:55:04.420]  of a woman and a daughter going from like a very loose hijab to a total blackout burqa
[03:55:04.420 --> 03:55:12.260]  i got perma band as an islamaphobe but you can call for the eradication of all trump supporters
[03:55:12.260 --> 03:55:17.700]  and it's fine with you know left-wing social media so what you're seeing through this lens
[03:55:17.700 --> 03:55:25.460]  is the films of jason bloom you know anti-american anti-white stoking racial hatred and you have
[03:55:26.020 --> 03:55:34.020]  aoc cortez she's calling ice the people that work for ice concentration camp guards she's
[03:55:34.020 --> 03:55:38.020]  saying oh i never thought i would see this in america there's nothing you can call them but
[03:55:38.020 --> 03:55:45.060]  concentration camps which means al-shuets and dakal no so no wonder people are taking pot shots
[03:55:45.060 --> 03:55:51.060]  at the ice facility in san antonio and not even pot shots aimed shots going dead through the
[03:55:51.060 --> 03:55:56.980]  window of ice office of of the ice offices i mean they were right through the window and if
[03:55:56.980 --> 03:56:01.540]  somebody had been standing there they would have died you know and and that was somebody that's
[03:56:01.540 --> 03:56:07.540]  still out there still has the rifle still has the scope so we're in very dangerous times now
[03:56:07.540 --> 03:56:13.540]  here's where i'm going to end today the left believes that by hooker by crook they're going to
[03:56:13.540 --> 03:56:20.020]  they're going to use their old alinsky and gram c and marx playbooks and they're going to trick
[03:56:20.020 --> 03:56:26.180]  hoodwink elect their way into power and once they're in power they'll just be able to ratchet up
[03:56:26.180 --> 03:56:32.820]  the taxes confiscate our guns and for our own good whether we like it or not shove socialism
[03:56:32.820 --> 03:56:40.100]  down our throats and make it like california that we can never ever you know throw them out of
[03:56:40.100 --> 03:56:44.580]  office because by then they'll they'll own the supreme court you know they'll they're talking
[03:56:44.580 --> 03:56:50.740]  about packing the supreme court they'll they'll own every judicial level they already own 90
[03:56:50.740 --> 03:56:55.780]  percent of the media they own 99 percent of colleges and universities that are you know
[03:56:55.780 --> 03:57:02.020]  turning out little marxist robots by the millions but what they don't factor in this is their lack
[03:57:02.020 --> 03:57:08.820]  of self-awareness they are going to meet an iron resistance from half of the country
[03:57:08.820 --> 03:57:15.300]  that are trump owners and there are 400 million guns out there and we're not just going to get on
[03:57:15.300 --> 03:57:20.660]  the boxcar we're not going to drink the kool-aid you know they think that they're just going to
[03:57:20.660 --> 03:57:26.820]  one way or the other turn the entire country into california so it can never be switched back
[03:57:26.820 --> 03:57:33.540]  but when they come for the guns when they do this mandatory compensated confiscation it's going to
[03:57:33.540 --> 03:57:40.500]  go back on them and the police that any police that go on confiscation raids you're not my brother
[03:57:40.500 --> 03:58:04.580]  and god help you
