[00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:16.432]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:25.834]  It is Thursday, August 15th, 2019.
[00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:30.517]  I am Alex Jones, your host, coming to you for the last day from San Diego.
[00:00:30.517 --> 00:00:33.059]  I'll be back in studio, Lord willing, tomorrow.
[00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:43.988]  Owen Schroyer was scheduled to be hosting the full four hours today, but I am going to be co-hosting some of them because wild horses could not drag me away.
[00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:44.889]  It's now conclusive.
[00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:52.258]  In fact, I even forgot to give the broadcast crew a name of this show today when we post it.
[00:00:52.258 --> 00:00:53.719]  Well, here it is.
[00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:54.980]  It's official.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.121]  Jeffrey Epstein was murdered.
[00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:59.081]  The evidence is incontrovertible.
[00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:06.085]  There isn't a jury in the world with all this evidence that wouldn't say he was murdered, and there is an ongoing cover-up that is unraveling.
[00:01:06.085 --> 00:01:12.528]  So, Jeffrey Epstein was murdered, and the cover-up is unraveling.
[00:01:13.604 --> 00:01:15.565]  That's the headline.
[00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:18.347]  Shaking the world.
[00:01:18.347 --> 00:01:20.348]  It's up on DrugsReport.com.
[00:01:20.348 --> 00:01:24.571]  The autopsy says his neck was broken in two places.
[00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:30.515]  We're going to lay all that out coming up and why it's so significant at the start of the next segment.
[00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:39.641]  Then we have that big, huge Google whistleblower that's a hero because he didn't just leak the info of the criminal's activity going on.
[00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:42.812]  The election meddling, the election fixing.
[00:01:42.812 --> 00:01:44.692]  He went public himself.
[00:01:44.692 --> 00:01:48.554]  He will be joining us coming up in the third segment in about 15 minutes.
[00:01:48.554 --> 00:01:51.055]  Zach Voorhees will be joining us.
[00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:55.356]  He's releasing more information today.
[00:01:55.356 --> 00:01:57.017]  He's already done it on his Twitter.
[00:01:57.017 --> 00:02:00.698]  You'll want to hear this major whistleblowing information.
[00:02:00.698 --> 00:02:00.958]  In fact,
[00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:10.526]  We're already linked on DredgeReport.com, but in case Dredge isn't listening, we probably want to send an email over pointing out that we're going to have the Google Whistleblower live on air.
[00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:12.268]  This will be a first.
[00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:15.571]  What Project Veritas did was amazing, and the interview is powerful.
[00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:17.712]  It's stunning.
[00:02:17.712 --> 00:02:20.535]  He's going to be live with us for three segments.
[00:02:20.535 --> 00:02:30.283]  That's about 30 minutes of airtime coming up, and I'm just going to give him the floor to tell it all, to tell what else he's going to be bringing out the other shoes to drop now.
[00:02:31.437 --> 00:02:35.980]  Here's the even bigger news that's coming up after that.
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:44.807]  Tens of thousands of Chinese troops mass at sports stadiums right across the border from Hong Kong and the bridge and openly say they're getting ready to fully invade.
[00:02:44.807 --> 00:02:46.888]  They've already used paramilitary troops.
[00:02:46.888 --> 00:02:51.171]  Now, let's hit this right now first, though.
[00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:58.476]  Six officers delivering a felony drug warrant in Philadelphia in what's basically a no-go zone get pinned down.
[00:02:58.476 --> 00:02:59.357]  Six get shot.
[00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:04.600]  The local news basically celebrates it.
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.341]  Thousands of people show up on the streets.
[00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:11.466]  Instead of throwing water balloons or pictures of water at the police, they begin to throw bottles at them.
[00:03:11.466 --> 00:03:19.153]  We're going to roll some of that video and tell them, we'll call them all sorts of horrible, violent names.
[00:03:19.153 --> 00:03:24.137]  This is what Netflix and Hollywood is pushing, that all cops are evil, all cops are racist.
[00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:25.118]  All these cops are black.
[00:03:25.837 --> 00:03:37.649]  And they have black folks wound up by the media to believe that their enemy is the police when nine out of ten blacks are killed by other black folks, not by white folks, not by Hispanics, not by police.
[00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:46.098]  And now these areas like Chicago, South Side and areas of Philly will be even bigger no-go zones for police and crime rates will only go up.
[00:03:46.098 --> 00:03:47.880]  But here are the police already six down.
[00:03:48.607 --> 00:03:52.891]  And on their flank, here comes folks brainwashed by the media to attack the police.
[00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:54.052]  This is the race baiting.
[00:03:54.052 --> 00:03:55.053]  This is Hollywood.
[00:03:55.053 --> 00:03:56.074]  Here is the awful footage.
[00:03:58.643 --> 00:03:58.963]  We're good to go.
[00:04:31.203 --> 00:04:31.243]  Oh,
[00:04:55.214 --> 00:04:57.796]  They shouted at the police, we're going to kill you, die.
[00:04:57.796 --> 00:04:59.737]  They called black police the n-word.
[00:04:59.737 --> 00:05:00.958]  This is the breakdown of civilization.
[00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.899]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:04.921]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:11.285]  And the way they did so is because they faced no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:23.491]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:24.951]  Otherwise, they will never change.
[00:05:24.951 --> 00:05:34.556]  And they will become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trusts of the 19th century, who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[00:05:34.616 --> 00:05:39.600]  The InfoWars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.283]  To make real the actions of independent free speech.
[00:05:42.283 --> 00:05:45.266]  To make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[00:05:45.266 --> 00:05:52.032]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[00:05:52.032 --> 00:05:54.914]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[00:05:54.914 --> 00:05:56.696]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[00:05:56.696 --> 00:05:58.617]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[00:05:58.617 --> 00:05:59.859]  Even it is what you just saw.
[00:06:02.376 --> 00:06:08.698]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:06:24.942 --> 00:06:28.563]  Ladies and gentlemen, world history is unfolding right now.
[00:06:28.563 --> 00:06:30.824]  This is a great time of awakening.
[00:06:30.824 --> 00:06:34.486]  This is a great time of what has been hidden coming to light.
[00:06:34.486 --> 00:06:39.367]  It's also an incredible crossroads where we see major military proxy wars between the U.S.
[00:06:39.367 --> 00:06:44.069]  and China breaking out in Hong Kong, breaking out in Kashmir.
[00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:48.671]  We see Islamic attacks exploding across Europe of every type.
[00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:51.632]  Hundreds of churches being burned a year, many, many a week.
[00:06:52.507 --> 00:06:58.088]  In Europe alone, this is just a quickening time, an acceleration that we're living in.
[00:06:58.088 --> 00:07:06.130]  We have a huge Google whistleblower that first broke yesterday with Project Veritas.
[00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:13.332]  Zach Voorhees will be joining us live, uncensored and unfiltered, the first time a major Google engineer.
[00:07:14.561 --> 00:07:24.828]  With access to all these manuals and training systems of how to suppress nationalists and conservatives and Christians and veterans and gun owners is going to be live on a show for three segments.
[00:07:24.828 --> 00:07:28.591]  But let's get into the big story right now.
[00:07:28.591 --> 00:07:30.352]  It ties into all of it.
[00:07:30.352 --> 00:07:33.714]  The loss of confidence in the system.
[00:07:33.714 --> 00:07:38.037]  No one buying the pedophile pimp
[00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:48.008]  The pedophile procurer, the blackmail intelligence operative Jeffrey Epstein, no one believing that he committed suicide.
[00:07:48.008 --> 00:08:04.972]  I had breakfast this morning with my head security guy who's been in the Army, the Marines, Blackwater, done CIA contracting, been an Austin police officer in his history, been a federal air marshal, you name it.
[00:08:04.972 --> 00:08:07.092]  He's talked to all of his federal associates and
[00:08:07.893 --> 00:08:14.474]  I mean, everyone he knows, and these guys aren't quote, conspiracy theorists, and they say 100% killed in the cell.
[00:08:14.474 --> 00:08:25.637]  But I sat there at breakfast for 30 minutes while he recited all of this, and I said, you've got to start doing a radio show, Tim, because he's just totally deadpan like Dragnet.
[00:08:25.637 --> 00:08:30.698]  And he was just laying it all out, and I'd forgotten half of this stuff.
[00:08:30.698 --> 00:08:36.899]  There's a story up on DrudgeReport.com from the Gateway Pundit that says, list of inconsistencies.
[00:08:37.762 --> 00:08:39.923]  I'd say list of smoking guns, but we're going to go over these.
[00:08:39.923 --> 00:08:44.684]  But let's let's just walk through the big ones, shall we?
[00:08:44.684 --> 00:08:47.444]  He gets this sweetheart deal a decade ago.
[00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:56.787]  He was already procuring conservatively thousands of underage girls, the black male people, taking them on to this island where far worse things happen.
[00:08:56.787 --> 00:09:00.828]  Other facilities in New York, other facilities in Florida.
[00:09:00.828 --> 00:09:01.908]  When it all starts to come out,
[00:09:03.354 --> 00:09:13.639]  The feds swoop in, bust him again, charge him with more sex trafficking, which ties into the Clintons and the open borders and Obama and Haiti.
[00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:18.322]  I mean, they are up to their necks and eyeballs in this.
[00:09:18.322 --> 00:09:19.642]  He goes into jail.
[00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:28.147]  They put a huge, giant bodybuilder cop who is in there for killing
[00:09:29.472 --> 00:09:35.397]  Four drug dealers we know of taking their money and burying them in his backyard.
[00:09:35.397 --> 00:09:39.300]  His specialty was shooting him and also choking him to death.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.022]  They put him in there with this non-violent offender.
[00:09:43.022 --> 00:09:43.943]  You never do that.
[00:09:43.943 --> 00:09:48.026]  And of course, I already knew that from researching it, but Tim was explaining to me this morning.
[00:09:48.026 --> 00:09:55.312]  You never put them in with a violent offender like that before they're transferred and convicted or sent to prison.
[00:09:56.992 --> 00:10:04.878]  This guy tries to break his neck, but good jail guards that weren't on the take got in and stopped him, found him in a catatonic position.
[00:10:04.878 --> 00:10:10.382]  Epstein tells his lawyer, who's in the news, no, he tried to kill me.
[00:10:10.382 --> 00:10:14.245]  Then they put him on suicide watch.
[00:10:14.245 --> 00:10:18.348]  They pull him off suicide watch, put him in a cell by himself.
[00:10:18.348 --> 00:10:20.309]  All this unfolds.
[00:10:20.309 --> 00:10:23.031]  They pull the regular guards off.
[00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:25.153]  The big finale coming in a moment, his broken neck.
[00:10:27.119 --> 00:10:30.000]  And it just goes on and on from there.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.261]  The lights are off.
[00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:32.481]  The cameras are off.
[00:10:32.481 --> 00:10:35.782]  They tell the regular jail guards, go home early.
[00:10:35.782 --> 00:10:42.385]  Other jail guards, not just one, but now they're saying a special crew is brought in.
[00:10:42.385 --> 00:10:48.648]  And then the jail guards that are there in other floors said they all fell asleep, so they can't say anything.
[00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:54.510]  Then the other witnesses that the feds have already talked to, as AG Barr took over the day it happened, he said, clearly a cover up.
[00:10:55.635 --> 00:11:06.760]  Appointed a special prosecutor, fired the warden, I mean, removed the warden, took the jail guards that found him off, put them on administrative leave.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.361]  They talked to all the cells around.
[00:11:08.361 --> 00:11:14.084]  They said, we heard the door open, him screaming and yelling, basically fighting for his life.
[00:11:14.084 --> 00:11:19.066]  They instantly start saying, breathe, breathe, breathe, the cover up, the screaming.
[00:11:19.066 --> 00:11:20.067]  So that's their cover story.
[00:11:20.532 --> 00:11:25.534]  Well, you're not screaming while you're leaning down on the so-called blanket to choke yourself.
[00:11:25.534 --> 00:11:26.854]  It's not breaking your neck.
[00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:29.796]  That's being violently grabbed and you're fighting back.
[00:11:29.796 --> 00:11:33.037]  Or you dropped from a distance and it can break a vertebra.
[00:11:33.037 --> 00:11:33.477]  No.
[00:11:33.477 --> 00:11:35.158]  Broken in two places.
[00:11:35.158 --> 00:11:37.118]  So they went in there.
[00:11:37.118 --> 00:11:37.779]  Two things happened.
[00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:41.580]  Either the guards that went in went in and brutally manhandled him.
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.901]  Or someone else got in, pulled out,
[00:11:44.775 --> 00:11:45.956]  And then the guards came in.
[00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:52.919]  But everyone heard the yelling, everyone heard the screaming, the wailing as he fought.
[00:11:52.919 --> 00:11:56.900]  And then, oh breathe, breathe Epstein, it's alright buddy.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.261]  Breathe!
[00:11:58.261 --> 00:12:00.982]  As they're killing him.
[00:12:00.982 --> 00:12:02.823]  Now again, we have the screams.
[00:12:02.823 --> 00:12:05.564]  We have all the normal protections and defaults turned off.
[00:12:05.564 --> 00:12:10.066]  We have him parked with a killer.
[00:12:10.066 --> 00:12:12.647]  Who has dead bodies in his yard.
[00:12:12.647 --> 00:12:14.188]  A huge gorilla, a huge guy.
[00:12:15.143 --> 00:12:17.445]  A cop.
[00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:19.866]  And so all of this goes on and on.
[00:12:19.866 --> 00:12:23.929]  And you have his lawyer and others saying, no, he said, they're going to kill me in here.
[00:12:23.929 --> 00:12:25.250]  That guy attacked me.
[00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.711]  I'm not going to commit suicide.
[00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:28.412]  Then he was upbeat.
[00:12:28.412 --> 00:12:30.273]  He was hearing that he had a deal.
[00:12:30.273 --> 00:12:32.015]  He was going to be getting out.
[00:12:32.015 --> 00:12:34.176]  He was going to turn to the Justice Department.
[00:12:34.176 --> 00:12:36.157]  He was going to go ahead and destroy the Clintons.
[00:12:36.157 --> 00:12:38.599]  And man, the money flowed.
[00:12:38.599 --> 00:12:41.381]  The special, you know, they're like, hey, we can't get the regular guards to do it.
[00:12:43.183 --> 00:12:45.905]  And so they turn off all the default protections.
[00:12:45.905 --> 00:12:48.647]  They bring in the special guys.
[00:12:48.647 --> 00:12:51.389]  Or somebody else went in, there was wailing and screaming.
[00:12:51.389 --> 00:12:52.910]  They were able to get out of the jail.
[00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:53.770]  Everybody was asleep.
[00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.332]  The lights were off.
[00:12:55.332 --> 00:12:57.173]  And then other, and then the guards found him.
[00:12:57.173 --> 00:12:58.754]  That's the only way.
[00:12:58.754 --> 00:13:00.475]  Where the door opens.
[00:13:00.475 --> 00:13:00.915]  No!
[00:13:00.915 --> 00:13:01.496]  Please help!
[00:13:01.496 --> 00:13:03.577]  I don't want to scream in the hotel.
[00:13:03.577 --> 00:13:04.438]  It'll send security here.
[00:13:04.438 --> 00:13:06.880]  People come to screams.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.661]  And then, breathe Alex!
[00:13:08.661 --> 00:13:10.102]  Breathe Epstein!
[00:13:11.539 --> 00:13:14.640]  This is completely beyond Hollywood.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.901]  The wheels have come off.
[00:13:15.901 --> 00:13:19.162]  The Deep State isn't as slick as it used to be because it's not in full control.
[00:13:19.162 --> 00:13:29.626]  This was a total kamikaze suicide mission sent in there by people I guarantee you they already had massive dirt on, who they already had control of.
[00:13:29.626 --> 00:13:32.387]  And Epstein was told, oh, you're getting out, buddy.
[00:13:32.387 --> 00:13:34.727]  But yeah, he was getting out feet first.
[00:13:34.727 --> 00:13:37.388]  That's why I told people this earlier this week.
[00:13:37.388 --> 00:13:38.969]  I said, listen, dead men tell no tales.
[00:13:39.901 --> 00:13:43.484]  And I said, they want to send the message to everybody else, I believe he's dead.
[00:13:43.484 --> 00:13:48.869]  All this stuff about, oh look, this photo looks the same as him standing up as it looks at him on the stretcher.
[00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:51.391]  Yeah, it's the same guy.
[00:13:51.391 --> 00:13:53.052]  It's his face.
[00:13:53.052 --> 00:13:56.615]  Jeffrey Epstein is as dead as a doornail.
[00:13:56.615 --> 00:14:00.639]  He's as dead as pirate ships from 500 years ago at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:03.261]  He's as extinct as Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[00:14:04.369 --> 00:14:06.190]  And the Easter Bunny, okay?
[00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:08.251]  I know the Easter Bunny in real folks is a joke.
[00:14:08.251 --> 00:14:09.152]  He's gone.
[00:14:09.152 --> 00:14:10.793]  He's dead and gone.
[00:14:10.793 --> 00:14:12.413]  And here's the thing, though.
[00:14:12.413 --> 00:14:15.555]  All the other witnesses now are going to understand.
[00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:22.779]  You start trying to plea bargain with Trump, we've got people in the Justice Department and we've got people in every federal jail and prison.
[00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:30.163]  And we'll kill you in front of everybody and the whole corporate media will go along with us and help cover that up.
[00:14:30.163 --> 00:14:33.685]  But you go to DrugsReport.com, Gateway Pundit,
[00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:37.613]  And you read the list of inconsistencies.
[00:14:37.613 --> 00:14:38.494]  I read this this morning.
[00:14:38.494 --> 00:14:40.716]  I can think of some that they don't even have listed.
[00:14:40.716 --> 00:14:43.318]  By the way, they've done a better list than I did.
[00:14:43.318 --> 00:14:51.444]  So I'm saying the inconsistencies are so monumental, are so massive that I can't even go over all of them.
[00:14:51.444 --> 00:14:56.108]  But coming up second hour, we're going to go through all of these.
[00:14:56.108 --> 00:14:59.270]  We've also posted a link to this on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:04.234]  But remember, one of the main reasons they took me off air last year, took us off all the platforms,
[00:15:05.191 --> 00:15:10.237]  Was because they said I was saying the Clintons were involved in sex rings to blackmail people.
[00:15:10.237 --> 00:15:15.203]  And they diverted off on that pizza place, which the media made a big deal on, that we did go focus on.
[00:15:15.203 --> 00:15:16.684]  We took the bait.
[00:15:16.684 --> 00:15:23.092]  But they, like a mockingbird, will act like its wings broken when you get close to its nest, so you go over to it instead of the nest.
[00:15:23.092 --> 00:15:24.854]  But it was spirit cooking.
[00:15:24.854 --> 00:15:25.775]  It was the, uh...
[00:15:27.014 --> 00:15:33.900]  All of the Aleister Crowley stuff with the Clintons, with John Podesta, with Tony Podesta, with the whole U.N., the whole history.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:37.723]  It is incredible how out of control all this is.
[00:15:37.723 --> 00:15:40.906]  When we come back, we've got the big whistleblower on with us.
[00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:42.107]  Please remember, we're Lister Supported.

[00:17:28.877 --> 00:17:30.098]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:17:30.098 --> 00:17:34.019]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:35.540]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.502]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:17:38.502 --> 00:17:44.064]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:17:44.064 --> 00:17:45.265]  I can help you, too.
[00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:48.206]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:17:48.206 --> 00:17:50.427]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:17:50.427 --> 00:17:54.869]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[00:17:54.869 --> 00:17:57.171]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[00:18:00.316 --> 00:18:01.637]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[00:18:01.637 --> 00:18:02.437]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[00:18:02.437 --> 00:18:02.997]  Thanks for holding.
[00:18:02.997 --> 00:18:03.518]  Hey, Alex.
[00:18:03.518 --> 00:18:06.339]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[00:18:06.339 --> 00:18:12.463]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[00:18:12.463 --> 00:18:21.268]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[00:18:21.268 --> 00:18:22.428]  That's it.
[00:18:22.428 --> 00:18:25.090]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.931]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[00:18:27.931 --> 00:18:29.212]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[00:18:29.372 --> 00:18:30.133]  I agree entirely.
[00:18:30.133 --> 00:18:35.576]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[00:18:35.576 --> 00:18:38.358]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[00:18:38.358 --> 00:18:40.439]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[00:18:40.439 --> 00:18:49.666]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[00:18:49.666 --> 00:18:51.587]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[00:18:51.587 --> 00:18:58.071]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[00:18:58.071 --> 00:18:59.012]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[00:19:00.362 --> 00:19:02.063]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[00:19:02.063 --> 00:19:04.165]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer.
[00:19:04.165 --> 00:19:05.926]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[00:19:05.926 --> 00:19:07.668]  But I'll be honest with you.
[00:19:07.668 --> 00:19:13.012]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[00:19:13.012 --> 00:19:14.893]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[00:19:14.893 --> 00:19:16.174]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[00:19:16.174 --> 00:19:16.915]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:19:17.921 --> 00:19:19.401]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[00:19:19.401 --> 00:19:22.102]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[00:19:22.102 --> 00:19:23.262]  I don't want them to win.
[00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:26.183]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[00:19:26.183 --> 00:19:29.284]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[00:19:29.284 --> 00:19:32.444]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[00:19:32.444 --> 00:19:36.245]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[00:19:36.245 --> 00:19:37.826]  These will change your life.
[00:19:37.826 --> 00:19:39.226]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[00:19:39.226 --> 00:19:41.227]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[00:19:41.227 --> 00:19:41.927]  Check it all out.
[00:19:41.927 --> 00:19:43.867]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[00:19:43.867 --> 00:19:45.668]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[00:19:45.668 --> 00:19:46.848]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[00:19:47.248 --> 00:19:49.210]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:25.644 --> 00:20:35.952]  Zach Voorhees is about to be interviewed by Owen Schroyer because Owen has had time to go over these documents, go over the Project Veritas reports, and so he'll be conducting the main interview.
[00:20:35.952 --> 00:20:42.578]  I'll have a few more questions at the end, but this is a major Google engineer who's going public, unlike others that have just leaked.
[00:20:43.459 --> 00:20:44.460]  He is a hero.
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.905]  This is the first time I know of we've had a Google engineer on live.
[00:20:47.905 --> 00:20:52.731]  So he'll be with us for the next 40 minutes or so until the end of the hour.
[00:20:52.731 --> 00:20:56.617]  And so from our main studios, Owen Schroyer takes over the interview.
[00:20:56.617 --> 00:20:56.777]  Owen.
[00:20:59.755 --> 00:21:01.616]  Well, Zach, thank you for joining us today.
[00:21:01.616 --> 00:21:09.202]  These are incredible times, incredible history that we're living, and I know that that is what led you to release these documents.
[00:21:09.202 --> 00:21:13.946]  But before we get into that, I want to do a brief history in your time at Google.
[00:21:13.946 --> 00:21:17.848]  You've been at Google for six years, correct?
[00:21:17.848 --> 00:21:19.129]  Actually, eight.
[00:21:19.129 --> 00:21:19.790]  Eight years.
[00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:23.813]  And when you started at Google, what was your position and where did you finish?
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:34.003]  So I started as a junior engineer and then I got promoted twice and when I left Google I was a senior software engineer.
[00:21:34.003 --> 00:21:48.108]  So this allowed you special access to the algorithms and the codes that Google was using for their search engine optimization and that they would also use on some of their sub platforms like YouTube, correct?
[00:21:49.176 --> 00:21:53.918]  Yeah, a common question people ask me is, what kind of special access did I have?
[00:21:53.918 --> 00:22:06.023]  And one of the things I just want to state for the record is that these were documents that were available to any full-time employee on the internal public internet.
[00:22:06.023 --> 00:22:13.906]  So they made these documents available for anyone to see, but then when you released them, they panicked and they called the police on you, correct?
[00:22:15.413 --> 00:22:21.336]  Yeah, so Google has been scrubbing the inside of their corporate internets.
[00:22:21.336 --> 00:22:33.021]  I started to become aware of these documents in 2017 and I just started like grabbing them and then, you know, finding keywords and that led me to other documents that I was then able to grab.
[00:22:33.021 --> 00:22:43.386]  And so I just started collecting this treasure trove of documents that was showing a clear intention to unduly influence the election and other nefarious things.
[00:22:44.085 --> 00:22:48.647]  Now you said you started collecting these documents in 2017.
[00:22:48.647 --> 00:23:00.412]  When do you think this sort of pattern of behavior at Google of manipulating search results for a political agenda, when do you think that started?
[00:23:00.412 --> 00:23:05.515]  It started in 2016, right after Donald Trump got elected.
[00:23:05.515 --> 00:23:12.678]  The company did a full 180 and started to communicate their intentions to sort of break away from their mission statements.
[00:23:13.183 --> 00:23:16.464]  To the employees of the company.
[00:23:16.464 --> 00:23:27.989]  Now, how clear were they with you and the rest of their employees that from now on, Google was basically operating as a political wing that was favoring one side of the aisle?
[00:23:27.989 --> 00:23:32.051]  In this case, it would be the Democrat Party, but it could be anybody.
[00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:35.012]  When did they decide that this was going to be their mission?
[00:23:35.012 --> 00:23:36.873]  And did they make that clear to their employees?
[00:23:37.793 --> 00:23:41.995]  Well, you know, there's a misconception that Google is trying to just censor the right.
[00:23:41.995 --> 00:23:44.477]  They're trying to censor the left.
[00:23:44.477 --> 00:23:58.385]  Today I just made a post to Toby Gabbard's attorney describing that I know how people can take down accounts because I saw them take down Jordan B. Peterson's account.
[00:23:58.385 --> 00:24:05.409]  And the information for that is still located inside of Google's internal bug database under Jordan B. Peterson.
[00:24:08.171 --> 00:24:14.173]  So you've put out an open letter to Tulsa Gabbard's attorney saying you know what it looks like to be taken down.
[00:24:14.173 --> 00:24:25.156]  Tulsa Gabbard sued Google for I believe $57 million for the interference they ran during her ad campaign on Google during the presidential debates.
[00:24:25.156 --> 00:24:35.279]  What kind of information can she look at or get access to to prove that Google actively made sure to keep her down during the presidential debate?
[00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:36.059]  That's a good question.
[00:24:36.715 --> 00:24:42.777]  You know, the challenge for these attorneys is that they don't have, like, knowledge of how Google's internal system works.
[00:24:42.777 --> 00:24:46.019]  And so that discovery process can be really challenging.
[00:24:46.019 --> 00:24:55.663]  And so what I did is I used my knowledge on how they took down Jordan Peterson to give them instructions on how to do discovery.
[00:24:55.663 --> 00:24:59.624]  So they'll be able to see, you know, that bug.
[00:24:59.624 --> 00:25:01.265]  And I described to them how
[00:25:02.246 --> 00:25:16.493]  How these malicious third-party actors were able to exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities to Google in order to trigger their AI to take down Jordan's email address.
[00:25:16.493 --> 00:25:20.575]  In this sense, I'm kind of testifying as an expert witness inside the system.
[00:25:20.575 --> 00:25:24.717]  And if you'd like, I would love to tell you how they were able to take down Jordan B. Peterson.
[00:25:25.191 --> 00:25:29.294]  In fact, let's actually go specifically with the Jordan B. Peterson example.
[00:25:29.294 --> 00:25:39.200]  Talk about exactly what they do inside, internally, with the engineers and the softwares and the algorithms to remove somebody like Jordan Peterson.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:47.206]  So what happens is that there is a group of people and what they do is that they get the target's address.
[00:25:47.206 --> 00:25:50.628]  So I'm not going to say Jordan Peterson's email address on air.
[00:25:51.212 --> 00:25:55.956]  But let's just say that his email address is XYZ.
[00:25:55.956 --> 00:26:01.320]  And so this third party will go and change one of the letters, right?
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.844]  So instead of XYZ, it'll be xyy at gmail.com.
[00:26:05.844 --> 00:26:14.531]  And they repeat this process and they create this network of spam accounts that then push out spam to other users.
[00:26:14.531 --> 00:26:18.134]  And this triggers the AI system to flag
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.821]  We're good to go.
[00:26:48.733 --> 00:26:52.155]  And so this is how they're doing it.
[00:26:52.155 --> 00:26:55.137]  And I've never seen Google really address this problem.
[00:26:55.137 --> 00:26:58.479]  The exploit, as far as I know, still exists.
[00:26:58.479 --> 00:27:01.421]  And it's something that needs to be investigated.
[00:27:01.421 --> 00:27:11.807]  In fact, I think that Google is actually purposely leaving this vulnerability open just so that they can claim plausible deniability and say, well, it wasn't us.
[00:27:11.807 --> 00:27:13.468]  And they're technically not taking down.
[00:27:13.468 --> 00:27:15.749]  It's these malicious third parties that are taking it down.
[00:27:16.946 --> 00:27:28.292]  So it sounds to me, whether or not you could say Google is involved or not, it sounds to me people are doing an end around of censorship, loading up the network with a bunch of false accounts.
[00:27:28.292 --> 00:27:29.692]  In this example, Jordan B. Peterson.
[00:27:29.692 --> 00:27:41.578]  So you've got Jordan B. Peterson, but then Jordan B. Peterson's, Jordan B. Peterson's, Jordan B. Peterson's, and then it just bogs it all down and it turns all of it into spam, including the real Jordan B. Peterson.
[00:27:41.578 --> 00:27:46.461]  But you're saying this is mostly done by third parties, but you think maybe Google turns a blind eye?
[00:27:47.369 --> 00:27:48.770]  Yes, that's exactly what's happening.
[00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:53.812]  Google's turning a blind eye and allowing these malicious third party hackers to hack the system.
[00:27:53.812 --> 00:27:56.833]  And so, you know, it started with, you know, Jordan Peterson.
[00:27:56.833 --> 00:28:01.555]  And now what we're seeing is, you know, it's evolved into, you know, election interference.
[00:28:01.555 --> 00:28:03.395]  Tulsi Gabbard has an ad account.
[00:28:03.395 --> 00:28:12.679]  And after she did the first Democratic debate, everybody, you know, swarmed to Google search to try to find information on Tulsi Gabbard.
[00:28:13.086 --> 00:28:21.169]  Well, Tulsi Gabbert's ad account went down and it went down the same way that Jordan Peterson's account was going down, you know, for suspicious activity.
[00:28:21.169 --> 00:28:27.911]  So during the surge, she's not able to utilize all the keywords that she's purchased.
[00:28:27.911 --> 00:28:31.672]  And so her opponents can can still buy her keywords.
[00:28:33.715 --> 00:28:36.676]  Users traffic is redirected towards establishment players.
[00:28:36.676 --> 00:28:47.298]  So let's focus on that on the other side and and let's highlight how this is something that's so important because during the presidential debates is when most of the traffic is on Google for people searching for information.
[00:28:47.298 --> 00:28:50.899]  So they go on there, they search Tulsi Gabbard, they don't find anything.
[00:28:50.899 --> 00:28:53.780]  That's because Tulsi Gabbard has been removed by Google.
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.880]  It's been marked as spam.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.621]  We've got the whistleblower on with us, Zach Voorhees.
[00:28:57.621 --> 00:28:58.921]  We'll get into it on the other side of this break.
[00:28:59.301 --> 00:29:03.865]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[00:29:03.865 --> 00:29:05.947]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:29:05.947 --> 00:29:07.689]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:29:07.689 --> 00:29:14.255]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:29:14.255 --> 00:29:19.320]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:24.024]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[00:29:24.464 --> 00:29:27.565]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[00:29:27.565 --> 00:29:34.587]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.

[00:30:59.913 --> 00:31:13.086]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[00:31:13.086 --> 00:31:16.008]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[00:31:16.008 --> 00:31:17.770]  farming goods a week ago.
[00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:21.413]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[00:31:22.054 --> 00:31:26.616]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[00:31:26.616 --> 00:31:27.656]  That's beautiful.
[00:31:27.656 --> 00:31:29.537]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[00:31:29.537 --> 00:31:31.157]  And we aren't going to back down.
[00:31:31.157 --> 00:31:38.740]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:41.081]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[00:31:41.081 --> 00:31:45.242]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:31:45.242 --> 00:31:46.183]  And I'm asking listeners,
[00:31:46.963 --> 00:31:51.087]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[00:31:51.087 --> 00:31:52.188]  We are the resistance.
[00:31:52.188 --> 00:31:52.908]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:32:00.083 --> 00:32:06.048]  George Orwell said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:32:06.048 --> 00:32:09.031]  And so, used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag.
[00:32:09.031 --> 00:32:13.234]  Because we still loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it.
[00:32:13.234 --> 00:32:16.217]  But now, they're trying to take it out of schools.
[00:32:16.217 --> 00:32:18.439]  They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[00:32:18.439 --> 00:32:23.283]  Weird white leftists that want a virtue signal are pulling down American flags and running up Mexican flags.
[00:32:23.903 --> 00:32:26.824]  This is the bizarreness of the America-hating we're seeing.
[00:32:26.824 --> 00:32:42.929]  So now it is a revolutionary act in a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag, and particularly when it says on the back, right there ladies and gentlemen, America's back, Infowars.com.
[00:32:42.929 --> 00:32:53.512]  So whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies' face, all over, not just the U.S., but worldwide, because more than ever, the American flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[00:33:03.267 --> 00:33:05.897]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:28.709 --> 00:33:33.133]  I'm interviewing Zach Voorhees, who is in San Francisco.
[00:33:33.133 --> 00:33:38.778]  I'm about to turn it back over to them, and then I'll be back live with Owen in the next hour.
[00:33:38.778 --> 00:33:46.224]  But you have to understand, he's talking from his perspective, which was high level in the engineering department, able to see these documents.
[00:33:46.224 --> 00:33:47.666]  And Congress has been lied to.
[00:33:47.666 --> 00:33:53.631]  But classically, just like motorcycle gangs like Hells Angels will use what they call puppet organizations
[00:33:54.784 --> 00:33:56.825]  To carry out their crimes for them.
[00:33:56.825 --> 00:33:57.646]  That's what you're hearing.
[00:33:57.646 --> 00:34:14.314]  We got secret documents thanks to Mike Cernovich last year, which Google admitted were real, where they were hiring outside contractors paying millions of dollars to go in manually and downvote us and spam using my name to then say InfoWars was not real news.
[00:34:14.314 --> 00:34:16.315]  That's exactly what he was just getting at.
[00:34:16.315 --> 00:34:21.438]  I'll make one more point and then turn it back over to the live interview and understand how much courage Mr. Voorhees has.
[00:34:21.438 --> 00:34:23.119]  If you expand on that,
[00:34:23.999 --> 00:34:38.324]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, Media Matters and others, they hired over 100,000 people trained by them to be brought into Google, who then on their outside time are given these exploits, and then go in and do it, and then Google has the plausible deniability.
[00:34:38.324 --> 00:34:41.045]  This is criminal racketeering in my view.
[00:34:41.045 --> 00:34:48.068]  So I'd like Owen to take over, ask these key questions, we'll show some of these articles, and then I'd also like to get into what he thinks
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.340]  Congress should do.
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.761]  But what he's saying is so central.
[00:34:52.761 --> 00:34:55.783]  Tulsi Gabbard is beautiful, smart, a real liberal.
[00:34:55.783 --> 00:34:57.003]  I really like her.
[00:34:57.003 --> 00:34:59.084]  She polls the best, so they bury her.
[00:34:59.084 --> 00:35:02.886]  Just like Bernie Sanders was polling better than Hillary, so they buried him.
[00:35:02.886 --> 00:35:03.966]  This is what they're able to do.
[00:35:03.966 --> 00:35:08.448]  And when he says this is about the left and right being censored, he's absolutely correct.
[00:35:08.448 --> 00:35:09.809]  They're going to try to make this partisan.
[00:35:09.809 --> 00:35:10.229]  He's right.
[00:35:10.769 --> 00:35:14.150]  These big giants, these big tech giants want total control.
[00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:17.531]  They're working with China to suppress their own liberal movements.
[00:35:17.531 --> 00:35:21.452]  So back to Owen Schroer and this incredible Google whistleblower.
[00:35:21.452 --> 00:35:23.433]  We're top-linked on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:35:23.433 --> 00:35:24.353]  History's happening.
[00:35:24.353 --> 00:35:25.294]  Please share the link.
[00:35:25.294 --> 00:35:26.554]  Back to our guest.
[00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:31.008]  So, I want to get into two things with you now, Zach.
[00:35:31.008 --> 00:35:41.377]  One is exactly what they did specifically to keep Tulsi Gabbard from trending in Google search results and to keep her ad campaign from showing up during the presidential debate.
[00:35:41.377 --> 00:35:48.223]  And then, I want to talk about the other thing that Google does, or if they are aware of this going on.
[00:35:48.223 --> 00:35:56.550]  We got the internal documents that they are hiring people, but they use other groups out there to go flag a bunch of things and they say, oh, we just have curated content
[00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:00.934]  Where the end user flags hate speech or abusive behavior.
[00:36:00.934 --> 00:36:02.475]  Well, they don't actually check that.
[00:36:02.475 --> 00:36:06.259]  They just look at the flaggings and say, oh, that's a flag you're banned.
[00:36:06.259 --> 00:36:07.119]  We banned Alex Jones.
[00:36:07.119 --> 00:36:07.620]  We banned you.
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.441]  So let's talk about that.
[00:36:08.441 --> 00:36:19.411]  But first, get into the specifics of what Tulsi Gabbard's attorneys need to know about what Google did to keep her from trending and from showing up with her ads during the Democrat presidential debate.
[00:36:21.164 --> 00:36:28.468]  Right, so I want to clarify that I don't have direct knowledge on how exactly Tulsi Gabbard got down.
[00:36:28.468 --> 00:36:34.892]  All I know is that it matches the pattern that it took on how Jordan B. Peterson was taken down.
[00:36:34.892 --> 00:36:38.114]  And that's just to spam Tulsi out of existence?
[00:36:38.114 --> 00:36:48.080]  Yeah, and there's been other people that have been taken out using this method of attack, and it actually constitutes a family of attacks where there are
[00:36:48.496 --> 00:36:58.801]  These vulnerabilities that Google is allowing third parties to exploit in order to take down targets that they want to take out.
[00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:09.627]  So let's talk about this other angle, which is a bunch of people going in and flagging groups consciously doing this to flag people they don't like, like for say Alex Jones.
[00:37:10.799 --> 00:37:12.741]  Does Google know that this is going on?
[00:37:12.741 --> 00:37:27.672]  How aware is Google that groups of people consciously go flag people they don't like for abusive behavior or hate speech, and then the AI ends up censoring those people based on the numbers that they have in the algorithm for the number of flaggings it takes to do so?
[00:37:27.672 --> 00:37:29.694]  How aware is Google that that is going on?
[00:37:30.836 --> 00:37:34.639]  I mean, we're aware of it, as anyone who investigates it sees that that's happening.
[00:37:34.639 --> 00:37:44.367]  And you don't need to be an insider to know that 5,000 downvotes on a video that appear in the span of 30 seconds is not normal.
[00:37:44.367 --> 00:37:45.087]  Right?
[00:37:45.087 --> 00:37:57.798]  And so the data on this is pretty clear that there is gamification of the system by automated systems that other people are using to control.
[00:37:57.798 --> 00:37:59.459]  And, you know,
[00:38:00.379 --> 00:38:02.924]  All that data is being claimed as a trade secret.
[00:38:02.924 --> 00:38:12.961]  And so, because it can't be audited, there is the plausible deniability of calling anybody who says that a conspiracy theorist.
[00:38:15.258 --> 00:38:19.899]  So what, I mean, because I'm trying to think, are they trying to just act incompetent?
[00:38:19.899 --> 00:38:39.444]  You obviously saw what was going on, you collected the documents, you released them so that the people know what's going on, but when you brought this to other executives or perhaps superiors at Google saying, hey look what they're doing to try to stop people's voices from being heard, this AI algorithm isn't working fairly, we have these groups going out and flagging things that they shouldn't be flagging, what was the response?
[00:38:41.304 --> 00:38:45.025]  I got reprimanded for trying to bring this, you know, to attention.
[00:38:45.025 --> 00:38:56.669]  So, you know, it was literally sitting me down and saying, you've been too outspoken and this is going to reflect negatively on your next performance review.
[00:38:56.669 --> 00:38:59.950]  I mean, that sounds like a big brother to me.
[00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:01.411]  It is, and then they don't follow through.
[00:39:01.411 --> 00:39:02.451]  It's a buff, right?
[00:39:02.451 --> 00:39:06.433]  Because they just want to shut you up, but they don't want any record that they're retaliating
[00:39:08.354 --> 00:39:10.116]  Uh, for political-based speech.
[00:39:10.116 --> 00:39:16.982]  And so, uh, there's really no outlet for people to go to try to fix the system because the system is not broken by accident.
[00:39:16.982 --> 00:39:20.285]  It's being broken purposely.
[00:39:20.285 --> 00:39:23.428]  Well, we've had now three whistleblowers go to Google.
[00:39:23.428 --> 00:39:27.172]  We've had, or excuse me, Google whistleblowers go to Project Veritas.
[00:39:27.172 --> 00:39:30.795]  We've had undercover video from Project Veritas exposing Google.
[00:39:30.795 --> 00:39:31.856]  We've had Sundar Pichai
[00:39:32.873 --> 00:39:36.235]  I mean, well, this is the reason why I'm coming forward is because, you know,
[00:39:53.672 --> 00:40:08.423]  As an insider, I can see that the executives have no allegiance to the truth, and that not even bringing them under oath is a strong enough method to have them tell the truth.
[00:40:08.423 --> 00:40:11.565]  And the thing is, is that they're not just lying to the Congress people.
[00:40:11.565 --> 00:40:13.847]  They're not just lying to the American people.
[00:40:13.847 --> 00:40:17.950]  They're lying to their stockholders, because they're telling their stockholders that they're not doing this.
[00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:20.251]  They don't have any ideological bias.
[00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:22.373]  And it's absurd to think that they don't.
[00:40:23.066 --> 00:40:35.833]  You know, how many times can they fool us before we wake up and we say, no, this is something that's deliberate, and this is something that's dark, and this is something that needs to be exposed to the light?
[00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:40.375]  Is Sundar Pichai, is he really the head of Google, or is he just a front man, in your opinion?
[00:40:44.232 --> 00:40:45.693]  It's difficult with these people.
[00:40:45.693 --> 00:40:49.495]  Like, a lot of these CEOs seem to be figureheads.
[00:40:49.495 --> 00:40:55.119]  Well, I ask that because he seemed very aloof during his congressional testimony.
[00:40:55.119 --> 00:41:00.603]  Yeah, and the thing is, is that how does, you know, if he's being honest, how is he in that role?
[00:41:00.603 --> 00:41:03.965]  Because he just seems so incompetent, you know, when they can't answer the questions.
[00:41:03.965 --> 00:41:06.547]  But it's not incompetence, it's deception.
[00:41:06.547 --> 00:41:09.228]  They don't want, they're dancing around the truth.
[00:41:09.228 --> 00:41:11.770]  And I actually feel bad for these executives.
[00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:12.931]  Like, they're under control.
[00:41:13.396 --> 00:41:13.897]  They can't.
[00:41:13.897 --> 00:41:16.440]  They're not free to say what the truth is.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:26.612]  They have to play a very careful dance between what their investors want, what a certain group of investors want to have disclosed to the rest of the public.
[00:41:27.486 --> 00:41:29.167]  Well, coming up, you got one more segment.
[00:41:29.167 --> 00:41:36.249]  Coming up, let's talk about what you think Congress and the President should do about this, and then comment on the weight that's been lifted off your soul.
[00:41:36.249 --> 00:41:38.530]  But talk about what you were just saying.
[00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:44.832]  Other executives, how many other people at Google are like you, and how much pressure are there on executives not to come forward right now?
[00:41:44.832 --> 00:41:50.314]  Do you think there's about to be a waterfront, or are they still intimidated by, you know, powerful forces?
[00:41:51.365 --> 00:41:54.447]  So, um, there's this weird culture in Google.
[00:41:54.447 --> 00:41:56.609]  It's they're trying to like install this monoculture.
[00:41:56.609 --> 00:42:02.173]  And yes, there are people, there's, there's kind of a patriot network inside of Google, but they're afraid to come out.
[00:42:02.173 --> 00:42:08.117]  And some of it, you know, some of the, some of that extends all the way into the executive class.
[00:42:08.117 --> 00:42:16.763]  Um, and so the thing is, is that I felt that if I came forward that I would galvanize other people by, by paving a path of disclosure.
[00:42:17.482 --> 00:42:22.877]  For these documents so that people can come forward and say their opinion without violating the NDA.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:28.542]  We've got one more segment with Google whistleblower Zach Voorhees.
[00:42:28.542 --> 00:42:31.883]  First of all, I want to thank Project Veritas for putting your story out there.
[00:42:31.883 --> 00:42:36.426]  I want to thank you, Zach Voorhees, for having the courage to come forward and hopefully others will follow.
[00:42:36.426 --> 00:42:43.549]  I want to thank InfoWars audience for making sure that we still have this platform despite Google trying to shut us down.
[00:42:43.549 --> 00:42:44.229]  This is amazing.
[00:42:44.229 --> 00:42:47.791]  I want to thank Drudge for linking to this so we can amplify this story.
[00:42:47.791 --> 00:42:51.113]  The world needs to know, America needs to know, Google
[00:42:52.373 --> 00:42:56.554]  ...is trying to manipulate US elections and potentially committing treason.
[00:42:56.554 --> 00:42:59.195]  More on the other side with the Whistleblower.
[00:42:59.195 --> 00:43:03.376]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:43:03.376 --> 00:43:04.436]  They are technocrats.
[00:43:04.436 --> 00:43:06.717]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:14.079]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life, make your own decisions, it's in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:43:14.079 --> 00:43:15.960]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:18.420]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:20.501]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect
[00:43:21.061 --> 00:43:24.904]  To forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:43:24.904 --> 00:43:30.107]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:43:30.107 --> 00:43:39.113]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical modelment and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:43:40.094 --> 00:43:46.079]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[00:43:46.079 --> 00:43:47.019]  It is amazing.
[00:43:47.019 --> 00:43:57.027]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:44:00.293 --> 00:44:16.857]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[00:44:16.997 --> 00:44:21.060]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:24.762]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:26.524]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[00:44:26.524 --> 00:44:30.747]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[00:44:30.747 --> 00:44:38.672]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[00:44:38.732 --> 00:44:40.313]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[00:44:40.313 --> 00:44:42.034]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[00:44:42.034 --> 00:44:43.154]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[00:44:43.154 --> 00:44:43.814]  But I'll be honest with you.
[00:45:07.802 --> 00:45:13.166]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[00:45:13.166 --> 00:45:15.047]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[00:45:15.047 --> 00:45:16.328]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[00:45:16.328 --> 00:45:17.069]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:45:18.095 --> 00:45:19.575]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[00:45:19.575 --> 00:45:22.256]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[00:45:22.256 --> 00:45:23.417]  I don't want them to win.
[00:45:23.417 --> 00:45:26.338]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[00:45:26.338 --> 00:45:29.459]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[00:45:29.459 --> 00:45:32.599]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[00:45:32.599 --> 00:45:36.401]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[00:45:36.401 --> 00:45:37.981]  These will change your life.
[00:45:37.981 --> 00:45:39.382]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[00:45:39.382 --> 00:45:41.382]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[00:45:41.382 --> 00:45:42.082]  Check it all out.
[00:45:42.082 --> 00:45:44.023]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[00:45:44.023 --> 00:45:45.804]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[00:45:45.804 --> 00:45:47.004]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[00:45:47.304 --> 00:45:48.765]  You get great products at the same time.
[00:45:48.765 --> 00:45:51.248]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:45:51.248 --> 00:45:53.410]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:56.493]  Take action now and fund the InfoWar for your own future.
[00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:03.391]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[00:46:03.391 --> 00:46:06.872]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[00:46:06.872 --> 00:46:08.392]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[00:46:08.392 --> 00:46:09.712]  I want to take the globalist on.
[00:46:09.712 --> 00:46:11.673]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[00:46:11.673 --> 00:46:16.854]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[00:46:16.854 --> 00:46:19.795]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[00:46:19.795 --> 00:46:20.535]  We got coffee.
[00:46:20.535 --> 00:46:21.415]  We got fish oil.
[00:46:21.415 --> 00:46:22.195]  We got turmeric.
[00:46:22.195 --> 00:46:23.176]  We got great toothpaste.
[00:46:23.176 --> 00:46:25.576]  We've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[00:46:25.576 --> 00:46:28.017]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[00:46:28.217 --> 00:46:30.839]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[00:46:30.839 --> 00:46:32.341]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[00:46:32.341 --> 00:46:34.683]  And it is the strongest, purest krill oil.
[00:46:34.683 --> 00:46:41.468]  And it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[00:46:41.468 --> 00:46:47.253]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[00:46:47.253 --> 00:46:49.515]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[00:46:49.515 --> 00:46:50.216]  This is not real.
[00:46:50.436 --> 00:46:55.060]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.621]  Real krill oil, folks, is red.
[00:46:56.621 --> 00:46:57.301]  It's not yellow.
[00:46:57.301 --> 00:46:58.242]  It's not milky.
[00:46:58.242 --> 00:47:03.386]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[00:47:03.386 --> 00:47:05.988]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.986 --> 00:47:25.771]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a Netflix drama show.
[00:47:25.771 --> 00:47:28.194]  This isn't a Law & Order TV program.
[00:47:28.194 --> 00:47:29.075]  This is not a movie.
[00:47:29.075 --> 00:47:29.917]  This is not a drill.
[00:47:29.917 --> 00:47:31.238]  This is not fiction.
[00:47:31.238 --> 00:47:33.241]  This is reality.
[00:47:33.241 --> 00:47:40.010]  You have a major Google engineer backing up what the other engineers have said, what the documents have shown, and talking about perjury before Congress.
[00:47:40.908 --> 00:47:46.591]  Well, I'm going to turn this over again to Owen Troyer in Austin, Texas, to finish up this amazing interview.
[00:47:46.591 --> 00:47:50.673]  But pray and support this individual and others to come forward.
[00:47:50.673 --> 00:47:54.495]  You heard him say he hopes to blaze a path to get others to have the courage.
[00:47:54.495 --> 00:47:55.916]  That's leadership.
[00:47:55.916 --> 00:47:57.377]  So Zach Voorhees, we salute you.
[00:47:57.377 --> 00:47:59.217]  And I'll say this.
[00:47:59.217 --> 00:48:07.842]  It's all of our birthright, black, white, old, young, gay, straight, whether you're from San Francisco, New York City, or Austin, Texas, or Des Moines, Iowa.
[00:48:07.842 --> 00:48:09.923]  We're all having our birthright stolen right now.
[00:48:12.449 --> 00:48:12.889]  We're good.
[00:48:37.896 --> 00:48:42.519]  World Awakens, Mega Sale, Globalist House of Cards Collapsing, End of Summer Super Sale.
[00:48:42.519 --> 00:48:46.922]  It's the big, giant, 50-60% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot Points.
[00:48:47.532 --> 00:49:01.025]  But only on 50 something items, not on every item, because a bunch of these are very close to selling out, whether it's ultimate krill oil, bodies, turmeric, brain force, plus knockout sleep, a turbo force, eight pack power stack.
[00:49:01.025 --> 00:49:05.810]  It's all 50 to 60 percent off and your purchases make it all possible here.
[00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:10.675]  But an incredible time to be alive, an incredible time to be making history together and standing up and seeing
[00:49:11.575 --> 00:49:19.761]  The good guys wake up and to see us coming back from zero to basically tying the Globalists right now for a football analogy.
[00:49:19.761 --> 00:49:22.043]  So back to Owen Schroer and Zach Voorhees.
[00:49:23.615 --> 00:49:25.976]  Once again, Zach, thank you for joining us.
[00:49:25.976 --> 00:49:30.958]  I want to get into Google's ability to rig and manipulate U.S.
[00:49:30.958 --> 00:49:39.102]  elections, where we have congressmen and media crying Russia interference, this interference, talking about election integrity.
[00:49:39.102 --> 00:49:41.963]  Do you think Google is the biggest threat to U.S.
[00:49:41.963 --> 00:49:45.044]  elections?
[00:49:45.044 --> 00:49:50.947]  I think that, you know, if you want to look at the biggest threat, it's Google together with Facebook.
[00:49:51.417 --> 00:50:07.403]  Together with Twitter, they formed this echo chamber in which if they want to apply their control of narratives, then what they're going to do is they're going to press down the voices that they don't want, and they're going to boost up the voices that they do.
[00:50:07.403 --> 00:50:12.425]  And InfoWars has been sort of the main victim in this.
[00:50:12.425 --> 00:50:19.628]  And it's clear that as if your audience looks through the disclosure list hosted at ProjectVeritas.com,
[00:50:20.486 --> 00:50:27.110]  They're going to see InfoWars pop up in numerous blacklists that have been disclosed.
[00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:36.416]  Now, do you actually have information from people inside Facebook or Twitter that they're doing the same thing Google is doing to censor voices like Alex Jones?
[00:50:37.401 --> 00:50:40.723]  Yeah, in fact, it's been disclosed with Project Veritas.
[00:50:40.723 --> 00:50:54.511]  There was a leaker from Facebook and there was a leaker from Pinterest who came out and disclosed that, you know, people in the influencer networks are being, you know, nefariously blacklisted within these companies.
[00:50:54.511 --> 00:50:57.413]  And I understand it's the same pattern that's being applied to Google.
[00:50:57.413 --> 00:51:03.417]  It's the same pattern that's being applied to Facebook, which is the same pattern that's being applied to Pinterest.
[00:51:03.417 --> 00:51:06.999]  You know, Project Veritas did an undercover sting operation with the Twitter folks.
[00:51:07.663 --> 00:51:15.188]  And what these people say when they don't think that the cameras are rolling is pretty insane.
[00:51:15.188 --> 00:51:24.053]  They think that if you love guns, if you enjoy your First Amendment rights, that you're a Russian bot.
[00:51:24.053 --> 00:51:28.736]  And when I tell people that, they're skeptical, but that's literally what was on the video.
[00:51:30.905 --> 00:51:36.327]  What do you think this does, knowing what these big tech companies do and the power they have?
[00:51:36.327 --> 00:51:38.507]  What do you think this does to U.S.
[00:51:38.507 --> 00:51:41.548]  election integrity?
[00:51:41.548 --> 00:51:43.669]  I mean, election, U.S.
[00:51:43.669 --> 00:51:53.772]  election integrity goes out the window if the voices on the left and voices on the right can't have a voice, you know?
[00:51:53.772 --> 00:51:59.854]  And, you know, Google's mission statement is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible.
[00:52:00.683 --> 00:52:01.123]  I'm good to go.
[00:52:11.434 --> 00:52:18.499]  You know, when other news sites are taking off the index, is that making information universally accessible?
[00:52:18.499 --> 00:52:19.500]  And no, it's not.
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:27.325]  So they're clearly violating their contract, their social contract that they've given to the American people and to their investors.
[00:52:27.325 --> 00:52:37.553]  And I'm specifically talking about Google here, because when they went IPO on their initial public offering, they had a constitution that they said that they would not violate.
[00:52:37.553 --> 00:52:39.674]  And the first one was do no evil.
[00:52:39.674 --> 00:52:40.395]  The second one was
[00:52:40.916 --> 00:52:44.299]  What do you think comes next in this disclosure of what Google is doing to manipulate U.S.
[00:52:44.299 --> 00:52:48.502]  elections, and what would you like to say to the Google executives that are engaging in this?
[00:53:10.184 --> 00:53:12.485]  Yeah, well, something quite amazing is happening right now.
[00:53:12.485 --> 00:53:14.286]  Like, there's been a huge document dump.
[00:53:14.286 --> 00:53:20.509]  I've released over 950 pages, and right now there is a crowd raid.
[00:53:20.509 --> 00:53:30.093]  There are a bunch of users, they're looking at these documents, they're digesting them, and they're posting the content of them onto Twitter for us all to see.
[00:53:30.093 --> 00:53:37.456]  And so, you know, one of the things I want to invite for your audience is to come online, you know, go to Project Veritas,
[00:53:38.166 --> 00:53:40.086]  Uh, see their, their, their disclosure.
[00:53:40.086 --> 00:53:42.807]  They posted a link to all of these documents.
[00:53:42.807 --> 00:53:47.948]  I'm asking your audience to download the everything dot zip file and just go to town.
[00:53:47.948 --> 00:53:53.469]  And the thing is, is that whatever you think Google's doing, I promise you it's way, way worse.
[00:53:53.469 --> 00:53:59.131]  And you know, I see the reaction online and everyone's like, you know, WTF, WTF.
[00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:04.312]  And I'm like, yes, everyone is now seeing what I've seen, uh, privately.
[00:54:04.312 --> 00:54:05.832]  Uh, and you know,
[00:54:06.397 --> 00:54:15.944]  We're finally having the exposure of light into the darkness, and people are finally understanding what's really going on in America.
[00:54:15.944 --> 00:54:23.609]  Yeah, I mean, this is like finding out the NFL has been telling referees to favor a certain team every year, and they keep winning the Super Bowl.
[00:54:23.609 --> 00:54:25.491]  That's what this is, but they're doing it with U.S.
[00:54:25.491 --> 00:54:26.251]  elections.
[00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:34.297]  So what would you like to say, though, to the Google executives that are engaged in this right now, as you're saying that some of them that have testified are guilty of perjury?
[00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:44.232]  What I have to say to the executives is that your days of deception are limited.
[00:54:44.232 --> 00:54:48.613]  We are all paying attention to the things that you're saying.
[00:54:48.613 --> 00:54:55.875]  And whatever you say is going to be audited at some point in the future.
[00:54:55.875 --> 00:54:59.295]  And you're going to be held to account for lying to the American public.
[00:54:59.295 --> 00:55:01.816]  Because it's not just about corporate profits.
[00:55:02.389 --> 00:55:06.192]  You've entered into the dangerous territory of a national security issue.
[00:55:06.192 --> 00:55:10.155]  You are now exposing yourself as a national security threat.
[00:55:10.155 --> 00:55:14.117]  You're hosting your AI Manhattan project in a foreign country.
[00:55:14.117 --> 00:55:19.301]  Meanwhile, you're using deception in order to cancel contracts with the United States military.
[00:55:19.301 --> 00:55:22.603]  So, you know, who is it that you're working for?
[00:55:22.603 --> 00:55:24.265]  Why are you beholden to them?
[00:55:24.265 --> 00:55:30.409]  And have you been infiltrated so thoroughly by foreign actors that you're now taking this position because you're afraid
[00:55:30.896 --> 00:55:34.858]  of the retribution of this infiltration.
[00:55:34.858 --> 00:55:36.338]  Now, you said something interesting.
[00:55:36.338 --> 00:55:40.480]  A Manhattan AI project that they've moved to a foreign country.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.341]  Are you talking about China?
[00:55:42.341 --> 00:55:43.681]  Yes, I am.
[00:55:43.681 --> 00:55:51.804]  And what is that project that you would say is the AI equivalent of a Manhattan project, which was, of course, the atom bomb?
[00:55:51.804 --> 00:55:56.146]  So, the equivalent that Google's working on is called DeepMind.
[00:55:56.146 --> 00:56:00.428]  And if people use that keyword, they can search for it right now and
[00:56:01.235 --> 00:56:16.506]  They've been pretty public about all that information about DeepMind, but Google has been trying to deceive the public by creating a fake AI project called Dragonfly.
[00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:26.033]  And, you know, they were telling the public that Dragonfly was their censorship weapon, and everyone was like, oh, what's up with Dragonfly?
[00:56:26.033 --> 00:56:30.636]  And they're trying to find information, but no information existed because it was a fake project.
[00:56:31.278 --> 00:56:40.960]  And you'll know that it's a fake project because right after I disclosed ML Fairness, which is the real, you know, AI censorship project, Google then decided that, OK, well, the ruse is over.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:44.341]  We're just going to, you know, officially terminate the Dragonfly project.
[00:56:44.341 --> 00:56:46.761]  And that happened in July.
[00:56:46.761 --> 00:56:50.602]  What do you know about the DeepMind product project that they're doing in China?
[00:56:50.602 --> 00:56:51.642]  Have they been testing this?
[00:56:51.642 --> 00:56:56.424]  Have they have they done any sort of form of seeing if it truly is artificially intelligent?
[00:56:56.424 --> 00:56:58.164]  Have they done, let's say, human testing?
[00:56:59.644 --> 00:57:00.124]  I don't know.
[00:57:00.124 --> 00:57:03.685]  That's probably like top secret for the company.
[00:57:03.685 --> 00:57:07.766]  The person that seems to know most about this is Peter Thiel.
[00:57:07.766 --> 00:57:18.609]  He wrote an article in the New York Times a week ago accusing Google of treason and asking for an investigation into Google's activities with China.
[00:57:18.609 --> 00:57:22.730]  So I'm going to direct your audience to search that direction.
[00:57:23.682 --> 00:57:31.708]  For, you know, the accusations of what Google is doing with China, with their AI Manhattan project called DeepMind.
[00:57:31.708 --> 00:57:32.509]  This is incredible.
[00:57:32.509 --> 00:57:35.611]  If you can stick around for five more minutes, we'd love to have you.
[00:57:35.611 --> 00:57:38.314]  Zach Voorhees, Google executive whistleblower.
[00:57:38.314 --> 00:57:39.474]  Huge document dump.
[00:57:39.474 --> 00:57:41.256]  This kind of stuff changes the world.
[00:57:41.256 --> 00:57:46.840]  I'd like to know, what is it like knowing that Google pretty much can just follow you anywhere you go, spy on you, listen to you?
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:47.541]  Does that scare you?
[00:57:49.747 --> 00:57:52.150]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.634]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[00:57:55.634 --> 00:57:57.176]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[00:57:57.176 --> 00:57:58.497]  I want to take the globalist on.
[00:57:58.497 --> 00:58:00.459]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[00:58:00.459 --> 00:58:05.265]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[00:58:05.605 --> 00:58:08.567]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[00:58:08.567 --> 00:58:16.994]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus, but Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[00:58:16.994 --> 00:58:19.616]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[00:58:19.616 --> 00:58:25.300]  It's totally full of the bottle, and it is the strongest, purest krill oil, and it cost us three times more
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:30.225]  Because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[00:58:30.225 --> 00:58:36.030]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:38.293]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[00:58:38.293 --> 00:58:39.214]  This has not been.
[00:58:39.214 --> 00:58:43.838]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:58:43.838 --> 00:58:45.400]  Real krill oil, folks, is red.
[00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.021]  It's not yellow, it's not milky.
[00:58:47.021 --> 00:58:48.543]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[00:58:52.518 --> 00:58:57.122]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[00:59:53.374 --> 01:00:01.406]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:01.406 --> 01:00:04.130]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:09.237]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:00:12.321 --> 01:00:14.263]  The Global Awakening is incredible.
[01:00:14.263 --> 01:00:19.088]  There are fires lighting in the minds of men and women everywhere of the deception.
[01:00:19.088 --> 01:00:27.156]  Zach Voorhees is just the archetype of the hero taking action, the trailblazer, with the intent to tell the truth.
[01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:28.878]  The whole house of cards is coming down.
[01:00:28.878 --> 01:00:29.578]  You can smell it.
[01:00:29.578 --> 01:00:30.159]  You can see it.
[01:00:31.008 --> 01:00:35.709]  But Google and the other big tech are just pushing more racial division, more collapse of society.
[01:00:35.709 --> 01:00:39.971]  A few final questions for Zach Voorhees, who will get a lot of heat for this.
[01:00:39.971 --> 01:00:42.751]  But people understand now, the good guys get the heat.
[01:00:42.751 --> 01:00:44.452]  There's a real turning point we've reached.
[01:00:44.452 --> 01:00:47.213]  We are now getting the upper hand against evil.
[01:00:47.213 --> 01:00:49.353]  But this is so historic.
[01:00:49.353 --> 01:00:53.815]  I wanted Owen just to ask a few final questions, and then I'm coming back the next segment with my own comments.
[01:00:56.157 --> 01:01:09.459]  I think the central point here is, if Trump doesn't act, and acts very strategically now, and if Congress doesn't act, and if the people don't act in a peaceful way, then there's no limit, because Ohm is bringing up all the spying by big tech.
[01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:16.878]  Facebook, listening to you in your house and transcribing it and selling it to people, and then lying to Congress about it.
[01:01:16.878 --> 01:01:18.919]  These people are out of control.
[01:01:18.919 --> 01:01:23.642]  They are the new axis of evil threat like Hitler and Mussolini were.
[01:01:23.642 --> 01:01:24.582]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:01:24.582 --> 01:01:26.443]  They are beyond that in their power.
[01:01:26.443 --> 01:01:27.744]  So Owen, final questions for Zach.
[01:01:29.107 --> 01:01:40.833]  Well, Zach, I want to ask you point blank right now, because not only are probably the executives of Google tuned in right now listening to what you have to say, but my guess is that the White House is listening very closely as well.
[01:01:40.833 --> 01:01:48.678]  So as a Google executive that's been with Google for nearly 10 years, you've been in the meetings, you've seen the internal memos, you've released the documents.
[01:01:49.338 --> 01:02:01.562]  Do you believe that Google as an entity, a powerful entity that it is, will do anything and everything they can to keep Donald Trump from winning the 2020 presidential election?
[01:02:01.562 --> 01:02:10.225]  Every single time I thought that Google would have some limit, some line that they wouldn't like pass, they blew past it.
[01:02:10.225 --> 01:02:14.166]  And I want to tell you a story about a breaking point that I had, which was in 2017.
[01:02:18.954 --> 01:02:38.431]  Trump made a tweet that included Arabic after he came back from Saudi Arabia and Google deleted a word out of the Arabic translation dictionary in order to make the Trump tweet become nonsense.
[01:02:38.431 --> 01:02:40.593]  Explain that a little more in detail.
[01:02:40.593 --> 01:02:40.974]  You're saying
[01:02:41.579 --> 01:02:47.262]  I caught Google deleting words out of their Arabic translation dictionary to make Trump tweets sound crazy.
[01:02:47.262 --> 01:02:56.367]  So you're saying they want people in, let's say, Saudi Arabia to see Trump's tweets but get a different translation than what it actually was?
[01:02:56.367 --> 01:03:04.991]  Okay, so Trump came back from Saudi Arabia and he made a tweet and it was something like, the news is fake, kefefe.
[01:03:04.991 --> 01:03:09.894]  Well, kefefe was a word that existed in the Arabic to English translation dictionary.
[01:03:10.455 --> 01:03:18.542]  Google deleted that because the New York Times made an article arguing that the word didn't make any sense.
[01:03:18.542 --> 01:03:36.619]  And so they went through, they created a design document, I think this was June 1st, 2017, saying we need to get rid of this word because it doesn't make any sense and it's an error that we're translating it into an English equivalent.
[01:03:37.455 --> 01:03:46.902]  They created this design duck, and then they created this bug feature so that, you know, you can track the engineers as they make progress towards their goal.
[01:03:46.902 --> 01:03:56.589]  And, you know, Owen, not only did they have to delete it once, they actually had to delete it twice because the AI was smart enough that it was able to translate the word through a different path.
[01:03:56.589 --> 01:04:02.874]  So in this log, you can see the engineers going through and saying, oh, wait, we've deleted it, but it's still appearing.
[01:04:02.874 --> 01:04:03.635]  Why is this?
[01:04:03.635 --> 01:04:05.016]  And then they go through the resolution.
[01:04:05.578 --> 01:04:08.859]  Yep, there it is, the Cafe Easter Egg.
[01:04:08.859 --> 01:04:11.480]  And they deleted it off the internet.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:24.264]  And then shortly thereafter, there was an attempt to invoke the 25th Amendment against the President of the United States by saying that he was crazy because he was tweeting nonsense.
[01:04:24.264 --> 01:04:27.145]  But the nonsense was after the fact.
[01:04:27.145 --> 01:04:32.487]  Wow, and so that was your breaking point where you realized, yes, Google will do anything to stop President Trump.
[01:04:33.614 --> 01:04:40.598]  Let's get a final thank you so much Zachary Voorhees, hero whistleblower, Google executive, Alex Jones, final statement.
[01:04:40.598 --> 01:04:46.262]  That man needs to testify to Congress along with Professor Epstein, Robert Epstein, and others.
[01:04:46.262 --> 01:04:47.162]  This is huge.
[01:04:47.162 --> 01:04:48.363]  This is a giant scandal.
[01:04:48.363 --> 01:04:51.865]  Coming up, my interview with Steven Crowder when he interviewed me yesterday.
[01:04:51.865 --> 01:04:54.647]  Then we'll be back live with so much more.
[01:04:54.647 --> 01:04:55.187]  Stay with us.
[01:04:55.187 --> 01:04:56.848]  History's happening and thank you to the whistleblower.
[01:04:57.148 --> 01:04:59.110]  And everybody else making this possible.
[01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:08.457]  An InfoWarrior fan favorite formula, Survival Shield X2, continues to lead the way into the next generation of super high quality nasoniodine formulas.
[01:05:08.457 --> 01:05:16.263]  Derived from ancient sea salts found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface, every drop of Survival Shield X2 contains 650 micrograms

[01:05:20.366 --> 01:05:33.014]  Even today, iodine deficiency remains a serious problem, with the World Health Organization estimating that nearly 50 million people still suffer from some kind of mental impairment related to iodine deficiency.
[01:05:33.014 --> 01:05:47.442]  That's why it's so important that you try Survival Shield X2, the only source of 99.999% ultra-pure deep-earth iodine crystals exclusively available through InfoWars Life at an extremely affordable price.

[01:06:06.974 --> 01:06:08.195]  You found it.
[01:06:08.195 --> 01:06:10.217]  The tip of the spear.
[01:06:10.217 --> 01:06:15.060]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:06:16.491 --> 01:06:30.874]  Thanks to this audience shopping at Infowarsstore.com, we were just able to have a groundbreaking interview that will be seen millions of times, even though YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Google all wanted it to never be seen.
[01:06:30.874 --> 01:06:31.934]  They wanted us shut down.
[01:06:31.934 --> 01:06:34.054]  Thanks to your support at Infowarsstore.com, we are still here.
[01:06:34.054 --> 01:06:38.455]  Now, Alex Jones did an interview with Steven Crowder.
[01:06:38.455 --> 01:06:41.636]  It was very powerful, very informative, and fun.
[01:06:41.636 --> 01:06:42.976]  Here is how it went.
[01:06:44.096 --> 01:06:45.937]  Well, we have a ton to talk about.
[01:06:45.937 --> 01:06:50.501]  But first off, I want to say, I don't know that that's true about anyone mentioned, because you were on one of the Change My Minds.
[01:06:50.501 --> 01:06:51.321]  We ran some of that.
[01:06:51.321 --> 01:06:52.902]  We've had you on since.
[01:06:52.902 --> 01:06:54.343]  And I don't think YouTube is banned.
[01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:56.185]  I mean, maybe we're just fortunate.
[01:06:56.185 --> 01:07:00.128]  But obviously, I know that they've been after you, and you've been public enemy number one with them.
[01:07:00.128 --> 01:07:02.289]  But we don't really care.
[01:07:02.289 --> 01:07:03.970]  I mean, we care for you, but we don't really care what they do.
[01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:04.391]  It's Facebook.
[01:07:04.391 --> 01:07:05.071]  It's Facebook.
[01:07:05.071 --> 01:07:07.413]  It's Facebook that's been doing the total blackout.
[01:07:07.413 --> 01:07:09.755]  And sure, they let me get on Joe Rogan.
[01:07:09.755 --> 01:07:10.675]  He talked to YouTube before.
[01:07:10.675 --> 01:07:11.296]  They said fine.
[01:07:11.776 --> 01:07:13.537]  Because you're big enough, you're respected enough.
[01:07:13.537 --> 01:07:19.599]  But a lot of the smaller shows and things that I've gone on have gotten strikes because they don't have a big enough name.
[01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:26.442]  Take the guy that uploaded the video of Chris Cuomo blowing up in New York.
[01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:29.203]  Well, they took his video down until there was an outcry.
[01:07:29.203 --> 01:07:30.203]  They put the video back up.
[01:07:30.203 --> 01:07:35.445]  So I think it's because you've got enough clout and a big fan base that supports you that you're still here, my friend.
[01:07:35.445 --> 01:07:37.866]  I mean, as you know, they've been working around the clock to take you off.
[01:07:38.106 --> 01:07:38.786]  Yes, I do.
[01:07:38.786 --> 01:07:40.367]  I don't know about clout or respect.
[01:07:40.367 --> 01:07:43.728]  Fan base I appreciate, but I'm certainly not respected in the halls of Google.
[01:07:43.728 --> 01:07:45.809]  They've made that no secret.
[01:07:45.809 --> 01:07:51.392]  Before we get into, I want to talk about Epstein, because obviously this seems, like we said, we want to get Mr. Jones on.
[01:07:51.392 --> 01:07:55.513]  But what's your take on Chris Cuomo and Fredo?
[01:07:55.513 --> 01:07:58.695]  First off, do you believe that Fredo is as bad as the N-word to Italians?
[01:07:58.695 --> 01:07:59.415]  I'm not sold.
[01:08:01.104 --> 01:08:06.390]  Well, I mean, in fact, I interviewed the fellow that was given the video.
[01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:13.417]  It's called That's the Point with Brandon, and he was given the video by a very wealthy individual, very wealthy family.
[01:08:13.417 --> 01:08:15.600]  It turns out is Italian and
[01:08:17.282 --> 01:08:22.105]  Just call the guy Fredo, because everybody knows that Chris Cuomo is a chump.
[01:08:22.105 --> 01:08:24.687]  He's the guy that said the Epstein thing shouldn't be investigated.
[01:08:24.687 --> 01:08:28.690]  He's the guy that said if you read WikiLeaks, you'll go to jail.
[01:08:28.690 --> 01:08:29.570]  But I'm allowed to.
[01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:38.276]  He's the guy that said if your 11-year-old daughter doesn't want to be in the shower with a transgendered woman with large genitals, large male genitals, that she's bad.
[01:08:38.276 --> 01:08:42.299]  So... Well, why does the large matter when it comes to transgendered genitals?
[01:08:42.299 --> 01:08:43.920]  If there are genitals, that's enough!
[01:08:45.174 --> 01:08:45.715]  Exactly.
[01:08:45.715 --> 01:08:50.298]  But expanding on that, this is the guy that's always blowing up at people, always threatening him.
[01:08:50.298 --> 01:08:57.083]  And new video has surfaced where he called himself Fredo on TV a decade ago.
[01:08:57.083 --> 01:08:58.764]  His dad called him Fredo.
[01:08:58.764 --> 01:09:00.385]  So we now know what this means.
[01:09:00.385 --> 01:09:04.147]  He's the dumb son compared to his brother, the governor, who's still pretty bad.
[01:09:04.147 --> 01:09:05.468]  America has never been that great.
[01:09:05.468 --> 01:09:06.829]  It's not going to be great.
[01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:09.811]  So this is my view on it.
[01:09:09.811 --> 01:09:10.412]  I think it's the truth.
[01:09:11.212 --> 01:09:20.837]  They've already said anybody that Trump supports, or anybody that supports Trump, or anybody that wants to keep their guns, or anybody that likes capitalism, or anybody that's just right of Mao Zedong or V.I.
[01:09:20.837 --> 01:09:22.118]  Lenin is a racist.
[01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:26.914]  So by logical extension, if somebody says, hey Fredo, can I take a picture with you?
[01:09:26.914 --> 01:09:27.915]  Oh, you just attacked me.
[01:09:27.915 --> 01:09:31.819]  I'm an Italian American with a CNN show worth tens of millions of dollars.
[01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:35.083]  And my brother's the governor and our family's worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:09:35.083 --> 01:09:39.608]  You know, I've got white privilege, but because I'm Italian, you just put me down.
[01:09:39.608 --> 01:09:40.348]  That's the N word.
[01:09:40.348 --> 01:09:42.230]  So I'm going to throw you down the stairs.
[01:09:42.230 --> 01:09:43.131]  I'm going to wreck you.
[01:09:43.131 --> 01:09:44.353]  Basically, I'm going to kill you.
[01:09:45.211 --> 01:09:47.833]  Because you dare joke at a public figure.
[01:09:47.833 --> 01:10:01.941]  It shows the entitlement of these elites, but now wrapping themselves in this new calculus of all Trump supporters are racist, or anyone that disagrees with me is a racist, so they've kind of an alchemy now to, oh, well, don't call me any names because that's racist too.
[01:10:01.941 --> 01:10:05.883]  Well, I mean, to be fair, I think it's poor form to call somebody, like, to insult somebody.
[01:10:05.883 --> 01:10:07.684]  It was meant to be insulting in front of his wife and kid.
[01:10:07.684 --> 01:10:10.046]  Like, I think that there's sort of these rules of engagement.
[01:10:10.046 --> 01:10:11.847]  It turns out that's not, that's a lie though.
[01:10:11.847 --> 01:10:13.428]  His wife and kid weren't there reportedly.
[01:10:14.008 --> 01:10:16.750]  Okay, well either way, if someone, for example, we talk about Sarah Huckabee being out to dinner.
[01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:17.670]  Like, I don't like Chris Cuomo.
[01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:22.854]  I call him a DNC pool boy in chief just because... And by the way, it sounds like his dad's a d**k if his dad called the press.
[01:10:22.854 --> 01:10:25.075]  It sounds like that guy was setting him up to fail.
[01:10:25.075 --> 01:10:27.537]  He was like, what are you setting me up for, dad?
[01:10:27.537 --> 01:10:27.997]  CNN.
[01:10:27.997 --> 01:10:28.457]  Primetime?
[01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:28.738]  Not exactly.
[01:10:28.738 --> 01:10:29.218]  No, I think you're right.
[01:10:29.278 --> 01:10:31.259]  We don't want to become Maxine Waters.
[01:10:31.259 --> 01:10:32.579]  When they're getting gas, harass them.
[01:10:32.579 --> 01:10:34.100]  When they're in the grocery store, harass them.
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:35.481]  When they're at the mall, harass them.
[01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:36.601]  I get harassed all over the place.
[01:10:36.601 --> 01:10:37.021]  So do you.
[01:10:37.021 --> 01:10:42.184]  That's why I did that joke bit where I walked up and harassed you as a leftist and you were kind-hearted not to slug me.
[01:10:42.184 --> 01:10:44.725]  Because you and your dad are both pretty big guys.
[01:10:44.725 --> 01:10:47.166]  I think you're right that overall we don't want to become the left.
[01:10:47.606 --> 01:11:04.413]  Yeah, exactly, and that does not change the fact that he clearly overreacted, because I get this kind of stuff all the time, and I just say, oh, okay, alright, and my rule is, I can't let you get within arm's length of me if you're being aggressive, that's different, you know, but if someone were to say, hey, I've had people go, hey, Steven, you're a fag, and I'm like, okay, whatever, alright, I take the good with the bad.
[01:11:05.874 --> 01:11:07.154]  So yeah, Fredo, we get it.
[01:11:07.154 --> 01:11:08.575]  Chris Cuomo, not a great guy.
[01:11:08.575 --> 01:11:09.875]  I don't think anyone's a fan of him.
[01:11:09.875 --> 01:11:12.296]  And what's crazy about him is his ratings are terrible.
[01:11:12.296 --> 01:11:23.999]  You know what nobody is... I don't imagine, I can't say this, I don't want to say it definitively because this could end up being a permabanned, but I don't imagine that anyone has said, you know what I really want to know?
[01:11:23.999 --> 01:11:25.319]  What Chris Cuomo thinks about X.
[01:11:27.817 --> 01:11:37.108]  We have had a lot of people saying, you know what, you should probably get Alex Jones' take on the Epstein saga, because he talked about this and predicted it a while ago.
[01:11:37.108 --> 01:11:46.098]  Now, to be clear, you've talked about sort of this, the pedophile rings and those in power and people who are sexual abuse or sex trafficking, which we know.
[01:11:46.098 --> 01:11:48.740]  I'm not using the word pedophile rings, but that's really what it is, it's a pedophile ring.
[01:11:49.601 --> 01:11:51.583]  Let me just give you an open field here.
[01:11:51.583 --> 01:11:54.846]  What's your take on the Epstein issue right now?
[01:11:54.846 --> 01:11:59.310]  First off, do you think that he committed suicide or was he suicided?
[01:11:59.310 --> 01:12:00.772]  And then, your thoughts.
[01:12:00.772 --> 01:12:02.533]  Okay.
[01:12:02.533 --> 01:12:05.156]  I'm not somebody that thinks he's in the witness protection program.
[01:12:05.156 --> 01:12:11.642]  Most people I see online, when they learn that the cameras were turned off, he was moved out of death watch, he was put in a cell by himself.
[01:12:12.432 --> 01:12:19.214]  And then voila, the body basically disappears and now they're saying we can't hear about the autopsy for some time.
[01:12:19.214 --> 01:12:24.076]  A lot of folks think that he was basically, again, a witness protection program.
[01:12:24.076 --> 01:12:28.617]  And because we've been lied to so much, people have a right to think that.
[01:12:28.617 --> 01:12:30.558]  People have a right to think he actually committed suicide.
[01:12:30.558 --> 01:12:32.659]  People have a right to think that he was murdered.
[01:12:32.659 --> 01:12:35.300]  But the evidence points towards murder.
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.020]  He had this little black book.
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.861]  He had all this information at his island.
[01:12:39.763 --> 01:12:44.286]  He was reportedly talking about working with the Trump administration and prosecutors.
[01:12:44.286 --> 01:12:45.687]  He was a concierge.
[01:12:45.687 --> 01:13:01.877]  He was a pimp, and I'll get to that next, but for very powerful big groups setting up these facilities in New Mexico and the Caribbean and in this huge compound in New York where people just didn't have sex with underage girls and things.
[01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:07.161]  They did all sorts of rituals and drugs and weird eugenics things, and if people go back to
[01:13:07.859 --> 01:13:27.813]  Documentaries and reports I've done over the last 10 years, well really 20, but Epstein's name specifically for 10, I explain it's a whole cult religion based on transhumanism and eugenics that's then merged with trauma-based mind control and things developed by the CIA and MI6.
[01:13:27.813 --> 01:13:34.498]  And the reason I knew about this was I was told by Ted Gunderson, well, let me get to that next.
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:42.585]  Let me ask you this real quick, because you mentioned it's a sort of cultish religion, and as a Christian I believe that people can be serving evil without necessarily knowing it.
[01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:47.468]  For example, we hear the greatest trick Satan ever played is making you believe that he doesn't exist, right?
[01:13:47.468 --> 01:13:51.210]  I think he's going to show up in the form of a busty secretary, not a creaky coffin.
[01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:53.392]  Most Satanists aren't really worshipping Satan.
[01:13:53.392 --> 01:14:05.540]  So when you say that, do you mean they're actually a part of a satanic cult knowingly, or it's just hedonism and serving the flesh and being very selfish, and so it basically manifests itself as this sort of glorified
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:07.481]  Self-religion.
[01:14:07.481 --> 01:14:08.963]  That is exactly right.
[01:14:08.963 --> 01:14:13.667]  And if I have the time, I mean, because anybody that studied history, you already know all the answers to this, Stephen.
[01:14:13.667 --> 01:14:15.528]  I'm not kissing your ass, it's true.
[01:14:15.528 --> 01:14:20.232]  But just getting back to your first question, because I'm already digressing, I don't believe he staged his death.
[01:14:20.896 --> 01:14:23.077]  Because dead men tell no tales.
[01:14:23.077 --> 01:14:29.821]  They want to threaten all the other witnesses to show them we can kill him inside a federal jail in New York City.
[01:14:29.821 --> 01:14:31.222]  Nobody can stop us.
[01:14:31.222 --> 01:14:32.963]  So let's go to what I really think happened.
[01:14:32.963 --> 01:14:33.563]  Okay.
[01:14:33.563 --> 01:14:37.945]  We know that all the default protections were turned off.
[01:14:37.945 --> 01:14:40.827]  We know that somebody already tried to kill him in the cell.
[01:14:40.827 --> 01:14:41.927]  He had told people that.
[01:14:41.927 --> 01:14:42.928]  That's come out in the news.
[01:14:44.204 --> 01:14:45.705]  So they move him in with somebody else.
[01:14:45.705 --> 01:14:48.968]  Then a few days before, they move him into a cell by himself.
[01:14:48.968 --> 01:14:51.230]  They take him off suicide watch.
[01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:58.436]  Then, even though there's a camera over the cell, that malfunction, that's now ABC News, NBC News, that's confirmed.
[01:14:58.436 --> 01:15:05.061]  Then they tell all the guards that normally every 30 minutes, go by your cell, don't worry about it, take off the day early.
[01:15:05.061 --> 01:15:06.803]  They go off an hour early.
[01:15:06.803 --> 01:15:08.084]  Someone who'd never been
[01:15:09.452 --> 01:15:27.122]  A worker at that jail, this is CBS News today, was allowed in to the facility and then reportedly, this is now in CBS News and others are reporting it, that people heard screaming and yelling and basically begging for his life as people go into his cell.
[01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:30.724]  Then they start shouting, breathe, breathe, breathe.
[01:15:32.678 --> 01:15:33.519]  Epstein.
[01:15:33.519 --> 01:15:39.282]  Now, a lot of people have obviously speculated what's going on here, but everything is turned off.
[01:15:39.282 --> 01:15:43.665]  All the emergency defaults are turned off, that everything is left in the black.
[01:15:43.665 --> 01:15:49.109]  The door opens, two guards go in, and then immediately we hear him screaming and yelling.
[01:15:49.109 --> 01:15:57.955]  The exact words were that I have written down here was that he was basically begging for his life.
[01:15:57.955 --> 01:15:59.596]  When you have a pain in the neck,
[01:16:00.476 --> 01:16:03.777]  A real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs.

[01:18:25.942 --> 01:18:28.563]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[01:18:28.563 --> 01:18:34.245]  It's totally full of the bottle, and it is the strongest, purest krill oil, and it cost us three times more
[01:18:34.465 --> 01:18:39.166]  Because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[01:18:39.166 --> 01:18:44.947]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[01:18:44.947 --> 01:18:47.228]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[01:18:47.228 --> 01:18:48.148]  This is not real.
[01:18:48.148 --> 01:18:52.769]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:18:52.769 --> 01:18:54.369]  Real krill oil, folks, is red.
[01:18:54.369 --> 01:18:55.950]  It's not yellow, it's not milky.
[01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:57.470]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:14.785]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[01:19:14.785 --> 01:19:16.506]  It is completely independent of all that.
[01:19:16.506 --> 01:19:27.389]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[01:19:27.589 --> 01:19:28.570]  We're good to go.

[01:20:30.895 --> 01:20:35.839]  Now back to Alex Jones on Louder with Prouder.
[01:20:35.839 --> 01:20:41.503]  But because this tranche of 2,000 documents came out from a lawsuit two days before,
[01:20:42.503 --> 01:20:58.639]  Showing all this British royalty, all these big media heads, all these big top Democrats, all these CEOs at Pedophile Island matching the manifest that have come out in federal documents that Dan Bongino and the Secret Service have warned of, saying you better watch it, Hillary, don't poke the bear.
[01:20:58.639 --> 01:21:00.821]  We know you and Bill were on that airplane.
[01:21:00.821 --> 01:21:03.704]  Now it's 27 times for Bill alone.
[01:21:04.798 --> 01:21:09.505]  With that whole waterfront going there, these documents come out on a Friday.
[01:21:09.505 --> 01:21:15.053]  I actually had the lawyer, Mark Rondazza, on my show last Friday, broke the documents, said what was in them.
[01:21:16.369 --> 01:21:24.071]  Next morning he's dead, and now it's confirmed 4chan had it 38 minutes before that he was dead from hanging.
[01:21:24.071 --> 01:21:30.593]  So now there's an investigation of that, where 4chan is scooping the New York Times, even in New York City.
[01:21:30.593 --> 01:21:32.634]  So the whole thing stinks to heaven, and then it gets worse.
[01:21:32.634 --> 01:21:33.874]  But that's not all that odd.
[01:21:33.874 --> 01:21:37.875]  I mean, people online tend to be faster than most mainstream news nowadays.
[01:21:37.875 --> 01:21:38.895]  You've gotten scoops.
[01:21:38.895 --> 01:21:40.296]  We've gotten scoops accidentally.
[01:21:40.296 --> 01:21:41.976]  So I don't know that that means foul play.
[01:21:41.976 --> 01:21:43.897]  It just means that the New York Times sucks at their job.
[01:21:44.617 --> 01:21:44.897]  Oh, sure.
[01:21:44.897 --> 01:21:46.378]  I wasn't saying that was a foul play.
[01:21:46.378 --> 01:21:48.178]  I'm just saying it shows the breakdown of the system.
[01:21:48.178 --> 01:21:54.041]  But, again, if you look at all the defaults, and there's a whole bunch of them.
[01:21:54.041 --> 01:21:58.903]  I was talking to a constitutional lawyer and criminal defense lawyer, Robert Barnes, just yesterday about this.
[01:21:58.903 --> 01:22:10.647]  And if you go through all, there's more than 15 things that are defaults that are done with a high profile person or a suicidal person, like we were told, that were all turned off, all the defaults.
[01:22:10.647 --> 01:22:12.528]  And then he told friends they're trying to kill me.
[01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:14.448]  This is mainstream news.
[01:22:14.448 --> 01:22:17.149]  He told people over the telephone, they're trying to kill me.
[01:22:17.149 --> 01:22:18.170]  You got to get me out of here.
[01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:19.770]  They're going to kill me.
[01:22:19.770 --> 01:22:21.131]  I'm not going to commit suicide.
[01:22:21.131 --> 01:22:22.811]  I didn't try to commit suicide.
[01:22:22.811 --> 01:22:25.532]  I was attacked in my jail cell.
[01:22:25.532 --> 01:22:27.213]  And so now he's dead.
[01:22:27.213 --> 01:22:28.273]  Now, regardless.
[01:22:29.574 --> 01:22:30.395]  It gets worse, Stephen.
[01:22:30.395 --> 01:22:31.695]  I'm jumping at any time, but there's just so much here.
[01:22:31.695 --> 01:22:33.076]  Well, I do have a question, because this is one thing.
[01:22:33.076 --> 01:22:35.297]  First off, I've not heard all the things that you're discussing.
[01:22:35.297 --> 01:22:40.340]  We've talked about sort of the five irrefutable facts yesterday, and we uploaded it to YouTube.
[01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:43.202]  And yes, of course, documents released Friday, dead on a Saturday.
[01:22:43.202 --> 01:22:44.963]  Pedophile Island, the guy got off.
[01:22:44.963 --> 01:22:49.806]  If you look at the overtime that was paid for some of these guards at his first stint in prison, you know, it was paid by Epstein himself.
[01:22:49.806 --> 01:22:52.187]  There's a paper trail here that is really bad.
[01:22:52.187 --> 01:22:58.531]  That being said, one thing I have not been able to find, and someone can correct, you probably know this, was he in solitary confinement?
[01:22:59.997 --> 01:23:00.797]  Was he supposed to be?
[01:23:00.797 --> 01:23:06.299]  Because it seems like that would be very pertinent information and I can't find the specifics anywhere.
[01:23:06.299 --> 01:23:11.361]  Yes, I mean if I was able to pull up my phone here I could dig that out because I've been following this very closely.
[01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:16.843]  First he was a high-profile guy so they put him in a, they don't call it solitary confinement there, but they call it protective custody.
[01:23:16.843 --> 01:23:17.003]  Right.
[01:23:17.003 --> 01:23:18.164]  So he's put in a cell.
[01:23:18.164 --> 01:23:29.168]  Then he gets put with another person who's reportedly quite a big bull and this guy is what's being said, there's different reports, basically hurting.
[01:23:29.808 --> 01:23:38.011]  And then he was put on suicide watch because they tried to imply they tried to commit suicide, though he told friends and family that that was not the case.
[01:23:38.011 --> 01:23:38.512]  Right.
[01:23:38.512 --> 01:23:46.455]  And then he was by himself in a jail cell, which you're again not supposed to be if you're on suicide watch because that increases it.
[01:23:47.115 --> 01:23:47.296]  Right.
[01:24:04.931 --> 01:24:12.695]  And I think something that's very relevant is, you know, listen, intent really matters here, and it would be interesting to see how much information we have regarding Epstein.
[01:24:12.695 --> 01:24:20.779]  Was his, was his sentiment there, was he enthusiastic about bringing other people down in this ring, saying, listen, I'm gonna burn this whole, this whole ship down with me?
[01:24:20.779 --> 01:24:24.801]  Or was he a guy who seemed as though he was hopeless, defeated, and wanted to check out?
[01:24:24.801 --> 01:24:31.064]  Because if it's the former, the guy wouldn't commit suicide if you placed a razor blade in his cell, because he has a mission to accomplish.
[01:24:31.144 --> 01:24:32.906]  If it's the latter, it's totally reasonable.
[01:24:32.906 --> 01:24:37.611]  And everything that I've read seems to insinuate that he wasn't looking to kill himself.
[01:24:37.611 --> 01:24:41.175]  But I understand that a lot of that is conjecture.
[01:24:41.175 --> 01:24:46.261]  Well, what friends and family have said in a bunch of news articles is actual quotes, but the media lies so much, you're right.
[01:24:46.261 --> 01:24:47.342]  Who knows what's true?
[01:24:47.342 --> 01:24:51.446]  It is kind of conjecture in the fake news era of the mainstream media.
[01:24:51.446 --> 01:24:52.087]  But they said that
[01:24:52.825 --> 01:24:54.667]  He was looking forward to things.
[01:24:54.667 --> 01:24:55.869]  He was settling into life.
[01:24:55.869 --> 01:24:58.172]  He was happy.
[01:24:58.172 --> 01:25:02.277]  And then they spun that and said, oh, well, he fooled them to put him in an area where he could kill himself.
[01:25:02.277 --> 01:25:07.243]  But the information from CBS News and others that no, the camera was turned off.
[01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:19.775]  And that the jail guards go in, one of the jail guards had never worked there before, and then they heard howling and screaming and begging, and them saying, breathe, Jeffrey Epstein, breathe, you can breathe, come on.
[01:25:19.775 --> 01:25:23.077]  The whole thing is just over-the-top bizarre, but here's what's even crazier.
[01:25:24.861 --> 01:25:46.193]  It's confirmed that in the last few weeks all these people pulled boats up to the little pedophile island and that they flew the drones around his house and got video of all these Apple computers and hard drives and things in the windows and shots of binoculars and printers and you know because people when they're doing computer work want to look out on the ocean like I'm doing right now.
[01:25:46.193 --> 01:25:48.995]  Days before the FBI raided it a few days ago
[01:25:49.887 --> 01:25:53.188]  All of that got pulled because people were droning it every day.
[01:25:53.188 --> 01:26:01.850]  So three days before the FBI raids, someone goes in and pulls all the computers and equipment that can be seen through the windows out of the house.
[01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:04.411]  So who knew the FBI was coming and who did that?
[01:26:04.411 --> 01:26:07.692]  That is another huge area that needs to be investigated.
[01:26:07.692 --> 01:26:11.253]  Wow, that is pretty, now is that something, is there like a before and after picture that people can see?
[01:26:11.946 --> 01:26:12.827]  They're absolutely.
[01:26:12.827 --> 01:26:14.007]  There is a before and after.
[01:26:14.007 --> 01:26:18.270]  Infowars.com and Newswars.com were some of the first to break it.
[01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:27.796]  Drugs Report linked to our article, but it's now out there and have been pretty big, and so you can just pull up those articles for yourself.
[01:26:27.796 --> 01:26:29.517]  Yeah, because one thing I noticed was a sort of, I guess,
[01:26:30.297 --> 01:26:32.798]  For lack of a better word, temple on his island that people saw.
[01:26:32.798 --> 01:26:40.061]  I did notice that when you watched, you saw some of the more recent drone footage, a lot of the Pagan iconography had been removed from it, as opposed to if you look at the older ones.
[01:26:40.061 --> 01:26:44.163]  And I want to say, was it like a, was it Poseidon, or was it Medusa, and then there were these two animal figures?
[01:26:44.163 --> 01:26:46.103]  And they were gone in the more recent ones.
[01:26:46.103 --> 01:26:48.825]  You still see that optical illusion of the recessed door.
[01:26:48.825 --> 01:26:52.686]  And it's hard, and this is what I do, right, for a living-ish.
[01:26:52.686 --> 01:26:54.487]  I mean, more, I'm a comedian, but I'm going, okay, hold on a second.
[01:26:54.487 --> 01:26:57.448]  Is there a timeline here as to when this changed?
[01:26:57.448 --> 01:26:59.509]  And it seems very difficult to find a lot of this info.
[01:27:00.489 --> 01:27:16.095]  Exactly, and that's what we're saying, is that the timeline of the dome being removed, and then the creatures of mythology on top and below, and they went, oh, a hurricane did that, but then folks checked the timeline of the last hurricane.
[01:27:16.095 --> 01:27:18.376]  No, in fact, a lot of this is recent.
[01:27:18.376 --> 01:27:20.437]  And so, yes, the place is being torn apart.
[01:27:21.238 --> 01:27:24.359]  The FBI had people with snorkels out in the water looking.
[01:27:24.359 --> 01:27:31.140]  But then, when you pull back big picture, Jeffrey Epstein was a concierge, he was a pimp, he was a handler.
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:37.341]  We've tracked his whole history, but the reason this is so important is, it's like a string on a sweater.
[01:27:37.341 --> 01:27:42.662]  You pull that string out on that sweater, and the whole thing can unravel.
[01:27:42.662 --> 01:27:45.263]  So, if you like, I can tell folks
[01:27:46.309 --> 01:28:02.773]  As specifically or not as specifically as you would like, because even Mark Rondazza, who's been my lawyer off and on, the student who got this, he's been on my show and he doesn't even like to read the documents on air, even though it's from lawsuits, from federal documents.
[01:28:02.773 --> 01:28:07.034]  It matches up with flight manifestos and other witnesses, but it names a lot of names.
[01:28:07.034 --> 01:28:12.515]  And so I think instead of just even naming names, perhaps we should just get into what eyewitnesses said is inside the temple.
[01:28:13.135 --> 01:28:16.437]  And then other temples around the world and the big picture.
[01:28:16.437 --> 01:28:17.318]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:28:17.318 --> 01:28:17.938]  Let's do that.
[01:28:17.938 --> 01:28:26.083]  And we released some of this info yesterday, like the Flight Manifest and obviously, I mean, you're not naming names if you mention Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew and people like that.
[01:28:26.083 --> 01:28:30.005]  I remember, what was weird was that Kevin Spacey and... Matt Groening?
[01:28:30.005 --> 01:28:32.767]  Governor Bill Richardson, but it's a lot of other... That surprised me!
[01:28:32.767 --> 01:28:33.667]  Governor Bill Richardson.
[01:28:33.667 --> 01:28:39.391]  Because I just thought of him as sort of an inconsequential governor who, you know, wasn't really a part of the elite because no one really liked him.
[01:28:42.572 --> 01:28:47.427]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:28:47.427 --> 01:28:48.871]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:28:57.503 --> 01:28:58.723]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:58.723 --> 01:29:02.644]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.644 --> 01:29:04.185]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:04.185 --> 01:29:07.146]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.146 --> 01:29:12.707]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:12.707 --> 01:29:13.907]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:13.907 --> 01:29:16.848]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:16.848 --> 01:29:19.069]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:19.069 --> 01:29:23.510]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:25.851]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:27.391 --> 01:29:28.652]  Maybe not today.
[01:29:28.652 --> 01:29:29.933]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:29:29.933 --> 01:29:33.675]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:29:33.675 --> 01:29:34.756]  Forget bunkers.
[01:29:34.756 --> 01:29:36.597]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:29:36.597 --> 01:29:38.298]  You need Survivalist Camps.
[01:29:38.298 --> 01:29:46.102]  The ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid, mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[01:29:46.102 --> 01:29:47.103]  Bold statement?
[01:29:47.103 --> 01:29:48.103]  You bet.
[01:29:48.103 --> 01:29:50.585]  See them now at survivalistcamps.com.
[01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:52.786]  That's survivalistcamps.com.
[01:29:52.786 --> 01:29:55.568]  Trust your family's survival to survivalistcamps.com.
[01:29:58.723 --> 01:30:01.125]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[01:30:01.125 --> 01:30:04.627]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[01:30:04.627 --> 01:30:06.128]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[01:30:06.128 --> 01:30:07.469]  I want to take the globalist on.
[01:30:07.469 --> 01:30:09.411]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[01:30:09.411 --> 01:30:14.374]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[01:30:14.554 --> 01:30:17.537]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[01:30:17.537 --> 01:30:25.986]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus, but Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[01:30:25.986 --> 01:30:28.588]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[01:30:28.588 --> 01:30:34.274]  It's totally full of the bottle, and it is the strongest, purest krill oil, and it cost us three times more
[01:30:34.514 --> 01:30:39.196]  Because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[01:30:39.196 --> 01:30:44.978]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[01:30:44.978 --> 01:30:47.259]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[01:30:47.259 --> 01:30:48.180]  This has not been.
[01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:52.802]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:30:52.802 --> 01:30:54.403]  Real krill oil, folks, is red.
[01:30:54.403 --> 01:30:55.983]  It's not yellow, it's not milky.
[01:30:55.983 --> 01:30:57.504]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[01:30:58.610 --> 01:31:09.837]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[01:31:09.837 --> 01:31:13.979]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[01:31:13.979 --> 01:31:23.345]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[01:31:24.065 --> 01:31:26.085]  The system is vulnerable.
[01:31:26.085 --> 01:31:28.766]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[01:31:28.766 --> 01:31:32.407]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[01:31:32.407 --> 01:31:39.308]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[01:31:39.308 --> 01:31:45.269]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.

[01:31:58.444 --> 01:32:11.617]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[01:32:11.617 --> 01:32:14.540]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:16.302]  farming goods a week ago.
[01:32:16.302 --> 01:32:19.945]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[01:32:20.586 --> 01:32:25.130]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[01:32:25.130 --> 01:32:26.171]  That's beautiful.
[01:32:26.171 --> 01:32:28.073]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[01:32:28.073 --> 01:32:29.675]  And we aren't going to back down.
[01:32:29.675 --> 01:32:37.282]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[01:32:37.282 --> 01:32:39.584]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[01:32:39.584 --> 01:32:43.728]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:32:43.728 --> 01:32:44.709]  And I'm asking listeners,
[01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:49.612]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[01:32:49.612 --> 01:32:50.713]  We are the resistance.
[01:32:50.713 --> 01:33:01.759]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[01:33:01.759 --> 01:33:04.421]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.377 --> 01:33:18.618]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[01:33:18.618 --> 01:33:21.180]  stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:24.662]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.662 --> 01:33:30.545]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:30.545 --> 01:33:35.608]  Well, everybody saw Jeffrey Epstein's death in jail coming.
[01:33:35.608 --> 01:33:39.851]  The victims, the lawyers of the victims, anyone in media worth their salt.
[01:33:41.471 --> 01:33:42.272]  And then what happened?
[01:33:42.272 --> 01:33:45.196]  Jeffrey Epstein found dead in prison cell.
[01:33:45.196 --> 01:33:46.337]  Apparent suicide.
[01:33:46.337 --> 01:33:51.083]  But the forensic analysis has come out.
[01:33:51.083 --> 01:33:55.849]  Broken bones in Epstein's neck indicate a strangulation.
[01:33:56.912 --> 01:33:59.894]  Would be the cause of death.
[01:33:59.894 --> 01:34:25.511]  So now all of a sudden this opens up a whole new can of worms, a whole new can of questioning, and you have to wonder how Jeffrey Epstein was able to be strangled and murdered in jail, in a correctional facility, with video surveillance that goes haywire, with guards that are apparently sleeping, with paperwork that apparently they didn't do, with other people present that apparently heard him struggling.
[01:34:26.769 --> 01:34:29.892]  But the mainstream media is right there to tell you what?
[01:34:29.892 --> 01:34:31.554]  Don't question anything!
[01:34:31.554 --> 01:34:35.699]  And if you do question the official narrative of Epstein's suicide, well, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[01:34:35.699 --> 01:34:40.004]  And well, if you're a conspiracy theorist now, they say you're a domestic terrorist.
[01:34:40.004 --> 01:34:46.171]  So, Epstein committed suicide even though the evidence says, broken bone to the neck, he was strangled to death.
[01:34:46.171 --> 01:34:48.073]  Here's Alex Jones with Stephen Crowder.
[01:34:49.562 --> 01:34:55.444]  So, before we get into the specifics, do you think there's a connection, because we do have to be honest about this, full disclosure, with President Donald Trump.
[01:34:55.444 --> 01:34:58.845]  Do you think there's a connection with President Trump beyond what we already know?
[01:34:58.845 --> 01:35:04.406]  That, you know, they were friends a long time ago when he kicked him out of Mar-a-Lago, I think in 2011.
[01:35:04.406 --> 01:35:06.747]  Is there anything else going on there?
[01:35:06.747 --> 01:35:10.048]  I would... Here's the bottom line.
[01:35:10.048 --> 01:35:11.228]  I already vetted Trump.
[01:35:12.165 --> 01:35:19.771]  Early on, and if he had any connection to pedophilia or any connection to child trafficking, that the Clintons just have all around them.
[01:35:19.771 --> 01:35:20.832]  I mean, it's not just Epstein.
[01:35:20.832 --> 01:35:30.700]  You can't swing a stick in the dark and not run into, you know, this head of her foundation convicted of smuggling kids out of Haiti, and now she runs this major child group.
[01:35:33.642 --> 01:35:42.489]  Obama opening the borders up and saying, let kids come across unattended, and then the Senate report admits thousands ended up in sex slavery, hundreds dead, Washington Post.
[01:35:42.489 --> 01:35:46.492]  I mean, that's what's so frustrating here is, Stephen, I'd love to say
[01:35:47.583 --> 01:35:49.124]  This is something I broke.
[01:35:49.124 --> 01:35:50.944]  This is something that vindicates me.
[01:35:50.944 --> 01:35:51.624]  I'm so cool.
[01:35:51.624 --> 01:35:52.565]  I'm so incredible.
[01:35:52.565 --> 01:35:55.786]  It's like breaking that this pen in my hand is orange.
[01:35:55.786 --> 01:35:58.807]  This, this has been very well known for decades.
[01:35:58.807 --> 01:36:05.729]  It's been all over the British news for decades about Prince Andrew and the Royals and how they compromise people using this.
[01:36:05.729 --> 01:36:10.971]  And so Epstein and the Clintons is just a tentacle and an extension of this.
[01:36:10.971 --> 01:36:14.212]  So, so here's what I did to research Trump.
[01:36:14.212 --> 01:36:15.212]  So does all him get big.
[01:36:16.121 --> 01:36:17.262]  I always thought he was annoying.
[01:36:17.262 --> 01:36:18.342]  I'm not into casinos.
[01:36:18.342 --> 01:36:19.483]  I'm not into bling.
[01:36:19.483 --> 01:36:20.923]  But I get that's his advertising.
[01:36:20.923 --> 01:36:25.946]  But as soon as I saw, I liked what he was saying on the stage, I went into research mode.
[01:36:25.946 --> 01:36:29.728]  And I read Roger Stone's War on Women.
[01:36:29.728 --> 01:36:31.769]  Roger Stone's book, Clinton's War on Women.
[01:36:31.769 --> 01:36:34.050]  And I already knew most of that about the Clintons.
[01:36:34.050 --> 01:36:35.651]  So I thought, okay, this is really accurate.
[01:36:35.651 --> 01:36:39.593]  So then I went and researched a lot of the Epstein stuff in there that I already knew was true.
[01:36:39.593 --> 01:36:41.614]  There was no Trump connection.
[01:36:42.354 --> 01:36:46.735]  Trump was probably with him at 10 or 15 parties while they lived in the same towns.
[01:36:46.735 --> 01:36:48.896]  He was a member of the club.
[01:36:48.896 --> 01:36:54.397]  Trump did throw him out, and it turns out, told people, and it was on record, for hitting on an 11-year-old girl.
[01:36:54.397 --> 01:36:55.418]  Yeah.
[01:36:55.418 --> 01:37:00.099]  And just being a creepy person that people were complaining about, and Trump was hardly ever even there.
[01:37:00.099 --> 01:37:07.761]  And so, the media always tries to divert it off onto Trump, like, oh, Donald Trump's best friend Jeffrey Epstein, there's nothing there.
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:20.334]  But when you look at the Clintons, it is just incredible what's there, and it goes back to... Well, it's 27 different flights over six visits, as I remember, if memory serves me correctly.
[01:37:21.092 --> 01:37:26.515]  Yes, and they were on a lot of other jets together to well-known sultans that are pedophiles in the Middle East.
[01:37:26.515 --> 01:37:39.662]  And if you get into the spirit cooking, the real WikiLeaks stuff, not the fake Pizzagate stuff that the media created and got people diverted off onto and then blamed on me, but the real spirit cooking stuff, real Aleister Crowley stuff.
[01:37:39.662 --> 01:37:42.804]  So here's the best place to start.
[01:37:42.804 --> 01:37:47.627]  You rightfully explained that most people get recruited by evil because it's a hot secretary.
[01:37:48.616 --> 01:37:50.157]  Or a hot, you know, woman.
[01:37:50.157 --> 01:37:53.098]  And that's actually how most Satanists recruit people.
[01:37:53.098 --> 01:38:07.765]  And really, all Satanists are is 3,000-year-old private intelligence agencies going back to the Middle East, where this got written about in scrolls, who learn to recruit righteous peoples with slow corruption.
[01:38:07.765 --> 01:38:10.807]  First, have sex with somebody else's wife.
[01:38:10.807 --> 01:38:12.888]  Then be corrupt on your taxes.
[01:38:12.888 --> 01:38:13.928]  And that's how it begins.
[01:38:13.928 --> 01:38:15.209]  But the way it's been described to me,
[01:38:15.976 --> 01:38:20.119]  And it's in history books as well, is it circles of corruption.
[01:38:20.119 --> 01:38:22.861]  So at the center of the circle, I don't know if you can see that.
[01:38:22.861 --> 01:38:23.581]  Yeah, I can see it.
[01:38:23.581 --> 01:38:27.364]  But at the center... It looks kind of like an everlasting gobstopper when you cut it in half.
[01:38:27.364 --> 01:38:28.524]  Yes, exactly.
[01:38:28.524 --> 01:38:35.489]  At the center, you've got really evil control freaks that want to manipulate and control everybody else because they have all the information.
[01:38:35.489 --> 01:38:37.270]  They know where the bodies are buried.
[01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:44.095]  And then they have people outside of them that they have dirt on, who they control, who go out and work for them, just like a mafia.
[01:38:45.521 --> 01:38:50.844]  But then they get power and then they go out and manipulate people on the outside ring of that.
[01:38:50.844 --> 01:38:56.286]  And so it's like any cult, any cult operates, they just expand out from there.
[01:38:56.286 --> 01:38:59.247]  So you've got Jeffrey Epstein is in the second ring here.
[01:38:59.247 --> 01:39:03.029]  He's not in the ring with the royalty and the Clintons and all the rest of them.
[01:39:03.029 --> 01:39:06.411]  I'd say the Clintons got into that final little center area.
[01:39:06.411 --> 01:39:08.932]  Then you've got all the minions out here that kind of know what's going on.
[01:39:10.106 --> 01:39:14.430]  But they just turn a blind eye to kids, they turn a blind eye to cocaine being shipped in, blah, blah, blah.
[01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:34.806]  But you see, just like the Mexican Mafia will make you go kill a liquor store owner or a rival member of the gang to be in their mafia, or the Crips will make you go kill somebody in the bloods, or in La Costa Nostra, you've got to kill at least three or four people and you've got to carry out a bunch of other crimes so they have all the dirt on you so they can burn you anytime they want.
[01:39:34.806 --> 01:39:38.890]  Well, they found that people don't care if you've killed somebody or cheated on your wife the last 50 years.
[01:39:39.767 --> 01:39:42.993]  But what they'll really get you for is sex with kids.
[01:39:42.993 --> 01:39:47.621]  And so people know that you have to have sex with first underage people.
[01:39:48.942 --> 01:40:03.912]  Then you've got to have sex with people that are even younger until you finally go, wear a mask at a satanic ritual, and they will usually bring a high-end hooker there, and they will poison her, and they'll say, okay, she's dead, we've got to cover this up, you were all involved.
[01:40:03.912 --> 01:40:07.195]  The next level's actually usually shooting somebody.
[01:40:07.195 --> 01:40:10.517]  They'll bring somebody in, say this guy's a criminal, you go up and you shoot him.
[01:40:10.517 --> 01:40:11.958]  And you're like, wait a minute, that's in the Bourne
[01:40:13.091 --> 01:40:19.357]  Uh, first born movie where after he's in mind control, he goes and kills the other soldier that, you know, that failed.
[01:40:19.357 --> 01:40:22.199]  This is all CIA mind control.
[01:40:22.199 --> 01:40:23.600]  Ancient mind control.
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:29.525]  Ancient secret societies are just what we call modern intelligence agencies to look at the circle.
[01:40:29.525 --> 01:40:32.228]  Another way to look at it is what they see it as.
[01:40:32.228 --> 01:40:34.690]  It's a pyramid.
[01:40:34.690 --> 01:40:35.791]  Okay.
[01:40:35.791 --> 01:40:37.192]  And you've got the group at the top.
[01:40:37.938 --> 01:40:42.380]  That has the knowledge everybody else below it has less and less knowledge.
[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:49.184]  All I did was study history and how these groups actually operate to try to take people to the top of the pyramid.
[01:40:49.184 --> 01:41:01.171]  And so now that they're externalizing all of these methods to corrupt the general public because they're now going from their cult level getting control to their final phase.
[01:41:01.883 --> 01:41:02.063]  Thank you.
[01:41:18.246 --> 01:41:32.058]  All went through periods where they would go into a decadent cycle where finally the priest class would emerge with the human sacrifice, emerge with the killing of the virgins, that's children, and externalize it and get the entire tribe to accept it.
[01:41:32.058 --> 01:41:39.564]  Let me ask you, are you saying you think that Epstein would have been involved with like actual human sacrifices at satanic rituals?
[01:41:39.564 --> 01:41:41.466]  Absolutely, and that's what's now coming out.
[01:41:41.466 --> 01:41:42.607]  I've been saying this for 10 years.
[01:41:43.775 --> 01:41:45.776]  Because we knew about the islands, we knew about it all.
[01:41:45.776 --> 01:41:49.397]  They had underground dungeons, underground passages.
[01:41:49.397 --> 01:41:51.257]  All the locals that built it said this.
[01:41:51.257 --> 01:42:01.941]  They said that boats would pull up at night, not just with high-end girls, you know, that were 16 down to 12, that kind of knew what they were doing or their families had sold into this.
[01:42:01.941 --> 01:42:09.823]  Because Epstein, again, would go to Romania, Hungary and actually buy girls, that's now confirmed, who were, you know, 12 years old, train them and use them as sex ops.
[01:42:09.823 --> 01:42:13.124]  But we're talking about poor kids from the Caribbean
[01:42:14.017 --> 01:42:16.279]  Uh, being brought in on boats at night.
[01:42:16.279 --> 01:42:26.786]  And see, that's the final level of the top of the pyramid, is that just like the crypts or the bloods want you to kill somebody, the final level of the pyramid in this is killing children.
[01:42:26.786 --> 01:42:39.914]  And it just came out in Italian newspapers two days ago that other rich elites are getting busted on islands off the coast of Italy, where they're doing ritual murder orgies versus sex orgies.
[01:42:39.914 --> 01:42:42.016]  First, you go to the island and have sex with a bunch of hot hookers.
[01:42:42.759 --> 01:42:44.361]  Then it's a 16-year-old.
[01:42:44.361 --> 01:42:45.903]  Then it's a 14-year-old.
[01:42:45.903 --> 01:42:47.325]  Then it's a 12-year-old.
[01:42:47.325 --> 01:42:53.813]  Then, oh, this person's talking, we're gonna have to kill him, you're involved, you're gonna have to help us dispose of the body.
[01:42:57.683 --> 01:43:00.106]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[01:43:00.106 --> 01:43:03.571]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[01:43:03.571 --> 01:43:05.113]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[01:43:05.113 --> 01:43:06.434]  I want to take the globalist on.
[01:43:06.434 --> 01:43:08.397]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[01:43:08.397 --> 01:43:13.183]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[01:43:13.263 --> 01:43:16.505]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[01:43:16.505 --> 01:43:17.246]  We got coffee.
[01:43:17.246 --> 01:43:18.106]  We got fish oil.
[01:43:18.106 --> 01:43:18.907]  We got turmeric.
[01:43:18.907 --> 01:43:19.887]  We got great toothpaste.
[01:43:19.887 --> 01:43:22.289]  We've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[01:43:22.289 --> 01:43:24.931]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[01:43:24.931 --> 01:43:27.552]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[01:43:27.552 --> 01:43:29.033]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[01:43:29.033 --> 01:43:31.395]  And it is the strongest, purest krill oil.
[01:43:31.395 --> 01:43:33.236]  And it cost us three times more.
[01:43:33.476 --> 01:43:38.140]  Because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:43.965]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[01:43:43.965 --> 01:43:46.227]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[01:43:46.227 --> 01:43:47.148]  This has not been.
[01:43:47.148 --> 01:43:51.772]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:43:51.772 --> 01:43:53.374]  Real krill oil, folks, is red.
[01:43:53.374 --> 01:43:54.955]  It's not yellow, it's not milky.
[01:43:54.955 --> 01:43:56.477]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[01:43:57.298 --> 01:44:03.021]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[01:44:58.863 --> 01:45:00.904]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[01:45:00.904 --> 01:45:02.905]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[01:45:02.905 --> 01:45:09.409]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[01:45:09.409 --> 01:45:21.496]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[01:45:21.496 --> 01:45:24.578]  Otherwise, they will never change, and they will become the Big Tech oligarchs
[01:45:24.738 --> 01:45:26.739]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[01:45:54.679 --> 01:45:56.600]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:59.042]  Even it is what you just saw.
[01:45:59.042 --> 01:46:02.265]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor.
[01:46:02.265 --> 01:46:03.866]  But I still need my morning coffee.
[01:46:05.191 --> 01:46:14.594]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[01:46:14.594 --> 01:46:26.238]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[01:46:26.238 --> 01:46:30.419]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[01:46:31.339 --> 01:46:35.383]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[01:46:35.383 --> 01:46:42.289]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[01:46:42.289 --> 01:46:45.212]  Order now at the InfoWars store.

[01:47:01.315 --> 01:47:04.818]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:04.818 --> 01:47:12.963]  Well, one little birdie won't be chirping.
[01:47:12.963 --> 01:47:14.945]  That's Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:47:14.945 --> 01:47:15.005]  No.
[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:39.167]  Autopsy now reveals he had broken vertebrae, which means he was strangled to death.
[01:47:39.167 --> 01:47:46.433]  Oh, but don't you worry because cable news will be sure to tell you nothing to see here.
[01:47:46.433 --> 01:47:47.934]  Just a suicide.
[01:47:47.934 --> 01:47:51.456]  Just another suicide.
[01:47:51.456 --> 01:47:58.742]  Really amazing, but I think this is a major opportunity to show people just how
[01:47:59.977 --> 01:48:02.879]  I mean, how do you even explain how corrupt the world is?
[01:48:02.879 --> 01:48:05.060]  How much power a shadow government has?
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:05.781]  A secret society?
[01:48:05.781 --> 01:48:11.284]  I mean, who could pull this off?
[01:48:11.284 --> 01:48:15.207]  I mean, reasonably and logically, think about this.
[01:48:15.207 --> 01:48:16.207]  How could this have happened?
[01:48:16.207 --> 01:48:17.848]  Somebody had to pay people off, right?
[01:48:17.848 --> 01:48:20.070]  Somebody had to blackmail people in the facility, right?
[01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:22.071]  I mean, what is going on here?
[01:48:22.071 --> 01:48:25.753]  Will we ever get answers?
[01:48:25.753 --> 01:48:26.734]  But how about this, though?
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:34.383]  Can I get a dot cam please, or just pull this up in HD?
[01:48:34.383 --> 01:48:43.609]  They remove a portrait from Jeffrey Epstein's mansion, or was it on the island?
[01:48:43.609 --> 01:48:44.530]  I think it was on the island.
[01:48:44.530 --> 01:48:59.120]  Either way, Epstein had a portrait of Bill Clinton in a blue dress, one that I think people are claiming Hillary Clinton wore, because there's pictures of her in a similar dress, and then red high heels on.
[01:49:01.618 --> 01:49:06.660]  Now, red high heels may or may not have some sort of symbolism for some sort of sexual perversion.
[01:49:06.660 --> 01:49:12.582]  I don't know why else you would be putting the red heels on, Bill.
[01:49:12.582 --> 01:49:15.584]  And then, of course, the blue dress.
[01:49:15.584 --> 01:49:20.026]  And it's in the Oval Office.
[01:49:20.026 --> 01:49:27.689]  This is the clown world, ladies and gentlemen, right here.
[01:49:27.689 --> 01:49:28.429]  This is what we're dealing with.
[01:49:30.751 --> 01:49:37.572]  Jeffrey Epstein having a portrait of Bill Clinton in the Oval Office in a blue dress and red heels.
[01:49:37.572 --> 01:49:47.414]  What in the hell do you think that is?
[01:49:47.414 --> 01:49:57.996]  So, the whole world is watching the Epstein cover-up happen, but the story will not die with Epstein.
[01:50:00.658 --> 01:50:16.970]  As the victims now look at Maxwell, Epstein's procurer, although she walks free and is living in her sprawling mansion just outside of Boston, Massachusetts.
[01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:22.955]  Tough life being a sex slave procurer for Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:50:22.955 --> 01:50:26.817]  And how is she still alive?
[01:50:26.817 --> 01:50:28.659]  She's not even in a jail
[01:50:29.958 --> 01:50:33.379]  In a facility that has guards and video surveillance.
[01:50:33.379 --> 01:50:34.639]  And how is she still alive?
[01:50:34.639 --> 01:50:36.359]  She knows everything that Epstein knows.
[01:50:36.359 --> 01:50:38.320]  Hm.
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:42.521]  A lot of questions.
[01:50:42.521 --> 01:50:44.081]  Not a lot of answers.
[01:50:44.081 --> 01:50:49.422]  But one portrait of Bill Clinton in the Oval Office in a blue dress and red heels.
[01:50:49.422 --> 01:50:51.863]  Oh yeah.
[01:50:51.863 --> 01:50:55.204]  Oh yeah.
[01:50:55.204 --> 01:50:57.104]  The symbolism is everywhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:04.262]  Open your eyes and see it.
[01:51:04.262 --> 01:51:07.604]  They're flaunting it right in front of your face.
[01:51:07.604 --> 01:51:08.705]  You know, that's really what this is.
[01:51:08.705 --> 01:51:12.887]  This is a total flex on the American people.
[01:51:12.887 --> 01:51:24.094]  We're going to have murdered the biggest witness to one of the biggest underground child sex rings
[01:51:26.138 --> 01:51:51.344]  To ever be exposed, we're so powerful, we operate in the shadows, we're so untouchable, we're gonna murder him right in front of your eyes, and then we're so powerful and in control of the media, they're gonna tell you it was suicide, and then they'll demonize you if you ever question it.
[01:51:51.344 --> 01:51:55.405]  Some things just become a little mundane,
[01:51:56.377 --> 01:52:05.640]  And trivial when you realize what is actually going on out there.
[01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:11.623]  Now, there is some other news, economic news, cultural news.
[01:52:11.623 --> 01:52:12.423]  I'm going to get to all of it.
[01:52:12.423 --> 01:52:15.324]  Gerald Salenti is going to be joining me in the third hour.
[01:52:15.324 --> 01:52:24.047]  You know, he predicted a recession and then there were the bad yields in the stock market yesterday, but it has made a recovery somewhat today.
[01:52:24.047 --> 01:52:25.728]  Still over 25 on the Dow, but
[01:52:31.149 --> 01:52:36.193]  I just wonder if this Epstein story is ever going to die.
[01:52:36.193 --> 01:52:37.974]  Clearly murdered.
[01:52:37.974 --> 01:52:41.897]  Clearly a cover-up.
[01:52:41.897 --> 01:52:58.428]  Clearly trying to stop an industrial-level sex slave pedophile ring from being exposed and bringing down powerful names and royalty.
[01:52:58.428 --> 01:52:59.069]  Now, meanwhile,
[01:53:02.065 --> 01:53:11.091]  You've got Chinese troops gathering inside a sports stadium near the Hong Kong border.
[01:53:11.091 --> 01:53:13.673]  Images are coming out.
[01:53:13.673 --> 01:53:16.855]  So, China's getting ready to invade Hong Kong.
[01:53:16.855 --> 01:53:19.257]  They've been thinking about invading Taiwan.
[01:53:19.257 --> 01:53:21.839]  They're building these islands in the South China Sea.
[01:53:26.105 --> 01:53:29.747]  And it's only getting worse in Hong Kong.
[01:53:29.747 --> 01:53:33.688]  It's only going to get worse unless the Chinese pull back.
[01:53:33.688 --> 01:53:35.809]  But all signs indicate the exact opposite.
[01:53:35.809 --> 01:53:39.691]  They're going in even harder.
[01:53:39.691 --> 01:53:46.214]  Now, are you going to see a Tiananmen Square-like situation in Hong Kong now?
[01:53:46.214 --> 01:53:47.974]  What is going to happen?
[01:53:47.974 --> 01:53:51.976]  Trump is trying to remain neutral on it despite the tough trade talk.
[01:53:53.339 --> 01:54:00.502]  Which you'd think people would appreciate somebody who's not trying to saber-rattle us into a war.
[01:54:00.502 --> 01:54:03.583]  Wants to meet with President Xi.
[01:54:03.583 --> 01:54:18.749]  But you notice how every time there's some sort of thing like this, and it's all making more sense to me now with North Korea, anytime there's some sort of struggle with China and either Western allied forces, or even in their own region, North Korea just fires off a missile or fires off a nuke.
[01:54:18.749 --> 01:54:22.551]  North Korea is Chinese, is the Chinese junkyard dog.
[01:54:23.655 --> 01:54:32.899]  I think Kim Jong-un actually really likes President Trump and gets along well with President Trump, who is engaging in world diplomacy.
[01:54:32.899 --> 01:54:41.964]  But you see, when China and the United States start sparring, North Korea needs to fire off a missile to make Trump look weak.
[01:54:41.964 --> 01:54:46.146]  You see, that's how that works.
[01:54:46.146 --> 01:54:50.588]  And then they use that in the media to make Trump look weak.
[01:54:51.806 --> 01:54:58.129]  And then China puffs out their chest, because Trump knows full well that this is how it goes on.
[01:54:58.129 --> 01:55:01.751]  But it's all about optics.
[01:55:01.751 --> 01:55:09.435]  And meanwhile, because the whole world is changing right now, you had Boris Johnson get elected, who promised Brexit by October.
[01:55:09.435 --> 01:55:19.381]  Well now, the opposition party has come out and said, with Jeremy Corbyn, they are going to stop
[01:55:21.613 --> 01:55:23.114]  The Brexit.
[01:55:23.114 --> 01:55:28.576]  So, you know, it's just like, okay, the people want to get out of the EU.
[01:55:28.576 --> 01:55:29.296]  What should we do?
[01:55:29.296 --> 01:55:32.977]  Well, let's have a vote and we'll see.
[01:55:32.977 --> 01:55:33.557]  They vote.
[01:55:33.557 --> 01:55:36.258]  Okay, they voted to leave the EU.
[01:55:36.258 --> 01:55:40.640]  Well, we didn't actually want that to happen, so we're going to stay in the EU.
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:41.761]  They have a referendum vote.
[01:55:41.761 --> 01:55:42.801]  Again, leave the EU.
[01:55:42.801 --> 01:55:44.542]  Well, we'll start working on plans.
[01:55:44.542 --> 01:55:46.722]  Maybe someday we'll get out, but probably not.
[01:55:46.722 --> 01:55:47.263]  They have another vote.
[01:55:47.263 --> 01:55:50.764]  They vote Boris Johnson in because he's a Brexit party guy.
[01:55:51.826 --> 01:55:53.607]  So he says, hey, we're going to get out of Brexit.
[01:55:53.607 --> 01:55:55.249]  You guys voted for it 500 times.
[01:55:55.249 --> 01:55:55.749]  Everybody wants it.
[01:55:55.749 --> 01:55:58.091]  We're going to be out of Brexit by October.
[01:55:58.091 --> 01:55:58.791]  And then what happens?
[01:55:58.791 --> 01:56:02.654]  The old guard, the old establishment comes back and says, nope.
[01:56:02.654 --> 01:56:06.957]  You voted three times to leave the European Union.
[01:56:06.957 --> 01:56:11.921]  We're not going to let you.
[01:56:11.921 --> 01:56:13.822]  Total tearing.
[01:56:15.925 --> 01:56:28.591]  So, this is what's happening right now as the New World Order is collapsing and the fight for the new New World Order is happening right now.
[01:56:28.591 --> 01:56:39.976]  And at least we have a president that doesn't want to see America go the way of the dodo bird as the new New World Order emerges from the ashes of the old.
[01:56:39.976 --> 01:56:42.277]  And hopefully it's not literal ashes.
[01:56:42.277 --> 01:56:42.857]  But let me tell ya,
[01:56:44.574 --> 01:56:46.238]  People are predicting a recession.
[01:56:46.238 --> 01:56:50.268]  People are afraid that a larger conflict of war could break out.
[01:56:51.562 --> 01:56:59.327]  And you'd hate to be in a situation like Russia where they have to stockpile on iodine right now because they just had another nuclear disaster that they're trying to get under control.
[01:56:59.327 --> 01:57:03.970]  But, you know, we have emergency food supplies for situations like this.
[01:57:03.970 --> 01:57:05.431]  We sell them at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:57:05.431 --> 01:57:06.952]  They're discounted right now.
[01:57:06.952 --> 01:57:09.954]  We have nascent iodine, which is great.
[01:57:09.954 --> 01:57:12.236]  This is why Russia's loading up on nascent iodine.
[01:57:12.236 --> 01:57:14.918]  It fights radiation, nuclear radiation specifically.
[01:57:15.678 --> 01:57:20.561]  So, if you're working on a bug-out bag, you're afraid of these events happening, we can help you.
[01:57:20.561 --> 01:57:25.184]  In fact, we have a whole section of survival gear at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:57:25.184 --> 01:57:33.309]  But emergency food is on sale, and we've also got nascent iodine that is on sale.
[01:57:33.309 --> 01:57:35.831]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:57:35.831 --> 01:57:40.994]  Shop at InfoWarsStore.com today to keep InfoWars on the air tomorrow.
[01:57:47.216 --> 01:58:00.379]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[01:58:00.379 --> 01:58:03.300]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:05.060]  farming goods a week ago.
[01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:08.701]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[01:58:09.341 --> 01:58:13.905]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[01:58:13.905 --> 01:58:14.946]  That's beautiful.
[01:58:14.946 --> 01:58:16.848]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.

[02:00:04.625 --> 02:00:09.486]  Well, my daddy left home when I was three, and he didn't leave much to maulin' me.
[02:00:09.486 --> 02:00:14.207]  Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze.
[02:00:14.207 --> 02:00:23.789]  Now, I don't blame him, cause he run and hid, but the meanest thing that he ever did was before he left, he went and maimed me.
[02:00:23.789 --> 02:00:28.190]  I'm going to open up the phone lines, and I want to hear from the audience on this Friday.
[02:00:29.833 --> 02:00:30.674]  What you're thinking about?
[02:00:30.674 --> 02:00:32.175]  Are you still on the Epstein thing?
[02:00:32.175 --> 02:00:33.576]  Are you thinking about Hong Kong?
[02:00:33.576 --> 02:00:38.900]  Are you thinking about Google rigging elections using their power to do so?
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:42.063]  What is on the audience's mind today before Gerald Salenti joins us?
[02:00:42.063 --> 02:00:44.564]  I'm going to go ahead and put the phone number out now, guys, and then we'll play those videos.
[02:00:44.564 --> 02:00:48.367]  1-877-789-ALEX 1-877-789-ALEX Again, is the Epstein cover-up still on your mind?
[02:00:48.367 --> 02:00:49.048]  Hong Kong with China?
[02:00:57.914 --> 02:01:00.135]  Google rigging elections.
[02:01:00.135 --> 02:01:01.376]  What's on the audience's mind today?
[02:01:01.376 --> 02:01:04.498]  We'll take your calls.
[02:01:04.498 --> 02:01:05.258]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:01:05.258 --> 02:01:12.423]  But first, this video is going viral on Twitter.
[02:01:12.423 --> 02:01:24.550]  And to me, it's a... It's basically just an encapsulated snapshot of what's happening to children right now.
[02:01:25.692 --> 02:01:46.030]  And what pop culture is doing and we sit here and we point fingers at everybody and everything and we forget that as a society we're decaying, as a society we're degenerating, as a society we're worshipping sex and drugs and violence and not modesty and honesty and integrity and so what do you get?
[02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:52.595]  You get a toddler which starts off seeming like an innocent dance routine
[02:01:53.645 --> 02:01:57.401]  Ends up twerking like Miley Cyrus on a wrecking ball.
[02:02:01.826 --> 02:02:08.688]  So just dancing, just an older gentleman dancing with a little girl, probably like five.
[02:02:08.688 --> 02:02:15.751]  Normal dance routine, and then all of a sudden, she literally gets on all fours, sticks her butt in the air, and starts shaking it.
[02:02:15.751 --> 02:02:17.812]  And the guy is appalled.
[02:02:17.812 --> 02:02:20.072]  He literally is like, what am I seeing?
[02:02:20.072 --> 02:02:21.393]  This is disgusting, honestly.
[02:02:21.393 --> 02:02:24.774]  I'm sick right now even having to do commentary and show this to you.
[02:02:24.774 --> 02:02:25.114]  I'm sick.
[02:02:32.219 --> 02:02:33.981]  So what happens?
[02:02:33.981 --> 02:02:38.765]  Your kid logs into Snapchat, your kid logs onto MTV, your kid logs onto Twitter, and what do they see?
[02:02:38.765 --> 02:02:46.192]  Cardi B sticking her butt in the air, shaking it, and then little girls mimic that.
[02:02:46.192 --> 02:02:48.815]  And you want to talk about innocence being lost?
[02:02:48.815 --> 02:02:52.378]  You want to talk about modesty being lost?
[02:02:52.378 --> 02:02:54.220]  When you're endorsing that for children?
[02:02:55.310 --> 02:03:03.732]  Where do you think their head is going to go when they're actually reaching the age where sex is becoming a thought in their mind?
[02:03:03.732 --> 02:03:05.753]  Where do you think they're going to go then?
[02:03:05.753 --> 02:03:22.538]  Not only do you have it in music videos getting pushed with pop culture, Drag Queen Storytime, just last week we had the video where they had the Drag Queen Storytime at the public library, and the drag queen is teaching the kids how to twerk.
[02:03:22.538 --> 02:03:23.938]  What in the hell is that?
[02:03:26.318 --> 02:03:29.540]  Oh, so here's where they want, so this is where culture goes.
[02:03:29.540 --> 02:03:45.026]  If good people don't stand up, if Christians don't stand up, if God-fearing people don't stand up, if Bible readers don't stand up, if just modest people don't stand up, you have Cardi B
[02:03:46.778 --> 02:03:55.245]  Endorsing Bernie Sanders in one of the dumbest political interviews you've ever seen, but it's actually like, oh, this is legit, like, this is real!
[02:03:55.245 --> 02:04:01.209]  Oh, Cardi B with Bernie Sanders, like, yay, this is politics now!
[02:04:01.209 --> 02:04:14.220]  And then your kid, dancing to music at home, your young girl, is gonna get on all fours, like she's in a Diplo video, and twerk.
[02:04:17.273 --> 02:04:18.674]  And this is pop culture now.
[02:04:18.674 --> 02:04:20.155]  This is what's cool.
[02:04:20.155 --> 02:04:21.716]  This is what's trendy.
[02:04:21.716 --> 02:04:25.018]  This is what is promoted.
[02:04:25.018 --> 02:04:28.340]  This is what's considered cool.
[02:04:28.340 --> 02:04:29.841]  I don't think so.
[02:04:29.841 --> 02:04:31.422]  It's not cool to me.
[02:04:31.422 --> 02:04:35.285]  In fact, it makes me sick.
[02:04:35.285 --> 02:04:36.385]  But what is it really?
[02:04:36.385 --> 02:04:40.128]  It's all fake, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:40.128 --> 02:04:42.369]  Just like a man dressed up as a woman.
[02:04:42.369 --> 02:04:43.590]  That's no woman.
[02:04:43.590 --> 02:04:44.651]  That's a man, man.
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:48.224]  It's all fake.
[02:04:48.224 --> 02:04:55.219]  And then they give children like this is the real world that you'll never really reach or experience and then they end up depressed.
[02:04:56.308 --> 02:05:02.250]  George Orwell said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[02:05:02.250 --> 02:05:05.250]  And so, used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag.
[02:05:05.250 --> 02:05:09.451]  Because we still loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it.
[02:05:09.451 --> 02:05:12.412]  But now, they're trying to take it out of schools.
[02:05:12.412 --> 02:05:14.653]  They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[02:05:14.653 --> 02:05:19.494]  Weird white leftists that want a virtue signal are pulling down American flags and running up Mexican flags.
[02:05:20.134 --> 02:05:23.055]  This is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing.
[02:05:23.055 --> 02:05:29.376]  So now it is a revolutionary act in a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the American flag.
[02:05:29.376 --> 02:05:32.657]  Particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag.
[02:05:32.657 --> 02:05:39.158]  And particularly when it says on the back, right there ladies and gentlemen, America's back in full wars dot com.
[02:05:39.158 --> 02:05:44.379]  So whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies face.
[02:05:44.379 --> 02:05:46.459]  All over, not just the U.S., but worldwide.
[02:05:46.459 --> 02:05:49.740]  Because more than ever, the American flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[02:06:02.553 --> 02:06:06.919]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:06:06.919 --> 02:06:11.545]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:06:11.545 --> 02:06:14.468]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:46.083]  What are you going to do when you see that horizon that you've been fighting to get to your entire existence?
[02:06:46.083 --> 02:06:48.143]  Are you going to stop and stare?
[02:06:48.143 --> 02:06:50.624]  Are you going to turn around and retreat?
[02:06:50.624 --> 02:07:00.326]  Or are you going to go forward until you have accomplished, achieved your manifest destiny?
[02:07:00.326 --> 02:07:03.067]  Because that's where we're at right now.
[02:07:05.216 --> 02:07:08.399]  Globalism has been fully exposed.
[02:07:08.399 --> 02:07:14.164]  Literal pedophile sex slave networks have been fully exposed.
[02:07:14.164 --> 02:07:19.948]  Treason at the upper echelons of the United States government have been fully exposed.
[02:07:19.948 --> 02:07:24.692]  And it's all happened in the last three years.
[02:07:24.692 --> 02:07:26.934]  So where do we go from here?
[02:07:26.934 --> 02:07:31.358]  Do we lay our sword and shield down?
[02:07:31.358 --> 02:07:33.500]  Do we retreat and claim victory?
[02:07:34.304 --> 02:07:47.191]  Or do we press forward through that dark, cold night because we see the horizon?
[02:07:47.191 --> 02:07:49.253]  Because that's where this goes.
[02:07:49.253 --> 02:07:53.235]  I mean, it's only going to get worse before it gets better, but man...
[02:07:55.523 --> 02:08:02.467]  When you see a portrait of Bill Clinton in red heels and a blue dress, folks, you know what's going on.
[02:08:02.467 --> 02:08:03.688]  And it's depraved stuff.
[02:08:03.688 --> 02:08:06.089]  And it's what we've been talking about in Infowars for a long time.
[02:08:06.089 --> 02:08:11.012]  And it's all coming out.
[02:08:11.012 --> 02:08:15.515]  And the old world order, known as the New World Order, is collapsing.
[02:08:15.515 --> 02:08:19.277]  What comes out on the other side of it is determined in the fight now.
[02:08:19.277 --> 02:08:22.719]  Now, I want to go to your phone lines to hear your take on all this with the audience.
[02:08:22.719 --> 02:08:23.340]  But again, folks,
[02:08:24.414 --> 02:08:53.887]  They try to shut InfoWars down, they try to ban us off the internet, they try to demonize us in the media, they try to hurt us financially with all the lawsuits and legal warfare that we have to deal with here, but thanks to this audience, we're still able to exist, we're still able to persist, we're still able to break ground, like today, when we bring on the Google whistleblower, first live interview, and we get the top link on Drudge, red-linked.
[02:08:55.370 --> 02:08:57.232]  We just changed the world.
[02:08:57.232 --> 02:08:59.895]  You just changed the world.
[02:08:59.895 --> 02:09:02.418]  Now, InfoWars can expand.
[02:09:02.418 --> 02:09:04.821]  And we're trying to expand.
[02:09:04.821 --> 02:09:05.983]  And it's not easy around here.
[02:09:07.486 --> 02:09:14.132]  But we give it our damnedest, and the good news is the products we sell at Infowarsstore.com are the best.
[02:09:14.132 --> 02:09:16.635]  We have the best water filters at Infowarsstore.com.

[02:09:27.906 --> 02:09:28.967]  I have the water filters.
[02:09:28.967 --> 02:09:29.948]  I have the air filters.
[02:09:29.948 --> 02:09:30.829]  I take the supplements.
[02:09:31.846 --> 02:09:34.287]  Infowarsstore.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:34.287 --> 02:09:38.408]  If you haven't started shopping at Infowarsstore.com, what are you waiting for?
[02:09:38.408 --> 02:09:40.228]  We are in the trenches.
[02:09:40.228 --> 02:09:41.688]  We are having victories.
[02:09:41.688 --> 02:09:43.049]  We are plowing forward.
[02:09:43.049 --> 02:09:44.449]  Push us forward.
[02:09:44.449 --> 02:09:55.471]  Fuel our jets so that we can clear the way to the horizon and the rest of the world can follow behind.
[02:09:55.471 --> 02:09:57.932]  Now, we've got callers lined up.
[02:10:00.017 --> 02:10:08.318]  So let's go out to the phone lines and start with... Let's start with... Let's see, where should we go here, guys?
[02:10:08.318 --> 02:10:09.879]  Let's go with Floyd in Virginia.
[02:10:09.879 --> 02:10:10.759]  Let's just start at the top.
[02:10:10.759 --> 02:10:12.979]  Floyd, go ahead.
[02:10:12.979 --> 02:10:16.340]  Hey, Owen.
[02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:23.681]  I've been a long-time listener of InfoWars and a long-time buyer of the product.
[02:10:23.681 --> 02:10:24.481]  Thank you.
[02:10:24.481 --> 02:10:27.642]  I had so much that I wanted to say until...
[02:10:28.891 --> 02:10:55.520]  Man we really start, it all ties together with this Jeffrey Epstein and the Clintons and the deep state and I mean going all the way back and I hate to even mention it but you know with the fellow that had to, I'm sorry I got a big storm coming through right now, but the fellow right up there with Trump that had to resign because he didn't want to implicate Trump into the whole matter because Trump
[02:10:56.616 --> 02:11:03.042]  Obviously trying to separate himself from this whole entire Jeffrey thing.
[02:11:03.042 --> 02:11:05.403]  Well it was President Trump that spurred the whole thing.
[02:11:05.403 --> 02:11:09.467]  Here's what I wish people could comprehend though, Floyd, and it's not easy.
[02:11:09.467 --> 02:11:10.908]  It's not like I'm mad and upset.
[02:11:10.908 --> 02:11:11.829]  It's tough.
[02:11:11.829 --> 02:11:18.514]  For example, you've got a brief eye into the mind of Ben Shapiro and his elitism.
[02:11:19.349 --> 02:11:22.311]  Where he trashes people that have two jobs at the same time.
[02:11:22.311 --> 02:11:25.693]  Well, I had parts of life where I had like six jobs at the same time.
[02:11:25.693 --> 02:11:27.074]  So, okay.
[02:11:27.074 --> 02:11:29.095]  But that's not even the point.
[02:11:29.095 --> 02:11:36.140]  That's just a little, that's just a little look into the mind of an elitist like Ben Shapiro.
[02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:41.584]  People like Epstein and the Clintons and these Royals that were involved with Epstein,
[02:11:42.739 --> 02:11:45.461]  They're so beyond that, we can't even comprehend.
[02:11:45.461 --> 02:11:49.723]  They look at the average human driving on the highway like they look at a cockroach.
[02:11:49.723 --> 02:11:51.665]  You should just be smashed out of existence.
[02:11:51.665 --> 02:11:53.205]  You're just a bother.
[02:11:53.205 --> 02:11:56.728]  So, it's like the whole thing with Epstein getting killed in prison.
[02:11:56.728 --> 02:12:10.076]  I just want people to understand, and I think the hurdle here is that people have, they have their own pride, they have their own, like, you know, nothing could possibly be better than me type of thing, but like,
[02:12:12.332 --> 02:12:13.813]  These people don't give a damn.
[02:12:13.813 --> 02:12:16.456]  They just murdered Jeffrey Epstein right in front of you and lied about it.
[02:12:16.456 --> 02:12:18.518]  They've been talking about a fake Russian collusion.
[02:12:18.518 --> 02:12:23.783]  They lie us into wars that kill hundreds of thousands of people, millions of people.
[02:12:23.783 --> 02:12:26.045]  Okay, so they don't care about humanity.
[02:12:26.045 --> 02:12:33.633]  Whoever these people are that had Epstein killed, whoever the people are that lie about the JFK and cover that up and the CIA and all of it,
[02:12:34.605 --> 02:12:43.229]  They're so beyond the average human, I just wish that the average citizen can understand the power that we're dealing with, the danger of this, and how they're laughing at us right now.
[02:12:43.229 --> 02:12:51.854]  They're laughing at us that they just killed Jeffrey Epstein, and there's a damn portrait of Bill Clinton in a woman's dress wearing redhead high heels.
[02:12:51.854 --> 02:12:57.577]  These people are laughing at the average citizen, and if the average citizen isn't standing up screaming like, what the hell's going on?
[02:12:57.577 --> 02:12:59.458]  Then they're, that's why they laugh.
[02:13:02.675 --> 02:13:10.482]  Well, if you even ask the average citizen anything about any of the facts, they've never even heard of it.
[02:13:10.482 --> 02:13:13.885]  And a lot of the times what you get is InfoWars.
[02:13:13.885 --> 02:13:18.949]  InfoWars gets you literally like tomorrow's news today kind of crap.
[02:13:18.949 --> 02:13:27.056]  This is stuff that Alex was talking about 10 years or more ago, and when I talked to friends or relatives about this,
[02:13:27.924 --> 02:13:31.767]  They've never even heard of this guy, Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:13:31.767 --> 02:13:39.973]  I knew about the Lolita Express years ago because of Alex talking about it back in 2008 when he first got popped for
[02:13:40.768 --> 02:13:44.350]  You know, having relations with a 14-year-old girl and stuff.
[02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:53.035]  Yeah, it's like, people are like, how do you do, because all these TV people, they do three-hour shows or whatever, two-hour shows, hour shows, they all have, it's all scripted out, it's all a teleprompter.
[02:13:53.035 --> 02:13:58.038]  Most radio shows are scripted out and produced and have, you know, segments planned out and everything.
[02:13:58.038 --> 02:13:59.779]  But people say, you know, how do you do three hours?
[02:13:59.779 --> 02:14:07.084]  It's like, if you had a treasure map to some huge treasure in the mountains, you know the treasure map!
[02:14:07.084 --> 02:14:08.665]  Like, you're not going to forget the treasure map.
[02:14:09.864 --> 02:14:17.708]  That's what this is, like we're just giving people the treasure map of the information to the treasure that the media will never tell you that has been hidden for so long.
[02:14:17.708 --> 02:14:18.488]  Thanks for the call, Floyd.
[02:14:18.488 --> 02:14:20.009]  Let's go to Lyle in Idaho.
[02:14:20.009 --> 02:14:23.150]  Go ahead, Lyle.
[02:14:23.150 --> 02:14:25.151]  Hey, Owen.
[02:14:25.151 --> 02:14:36.416]  Yeah, I just wanted to kind of echo a sentiment that you expressed a couple days ago concerning William Barr and how he handled all of this
[02:14:37.310 --> 02:15:04.861]  Um, lack of security surrounding such a high value, uh, uh, asset or whatever you want to call, uh, uh, this guy Epstein, um, in terms of what he knew and the lack of protection he was receiving, uh, you know, and it all goes back to the bar when he was, uh, you know, under Bush senior and he was a known, uh, Iran contra cover up Meister.
[02:15:04.861 --> 02:15:05.501]  And, you know, I,
[02:15:06.601 --> 02:15:15.131]  His credibility, in my opinion, based upon just the empirical data that's out there, he hasn't impressed me all that much.
[02:15:24.764 --> 02:15:39.955]  I'm going to wait and see for my final verdict when it's all said and done, but even the information that's gotten out, even if you want to say, oh, Trump should have done more, Barr should have done more, which I think is fair to say, even with all the information getting out, it's so devastating.
[02:15:39.955 --> 02:15:41.576]  I mean, it's like this.
[02:15:41.576 --> 02:15:48.421]  The only way they don't care about this information getting out is if they're about to launch some full-blown nuclear war or a bioweapon.
[02:15:48.421 --> 02:15:52.524]  Otherwise, just this information getting out is so devastating to them.
[02:15:52.524 --> 02:15:54.265]  It's like, well, maybe Barr's not the bad guy.
[02:15:55.325 --> 02:16:01.070]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.

[02:16:06.175 --> 02:16:13.902]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[02:16:13.902 --> 02:16:21.789]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[02:16:21.949 --> 02:16:23.749]  Not a security IPO or note.
[02:16:23.749 --> 02:16:33.252]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[02:16:50.281 --> 02:16:52.006]  Consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[02:16:52.006 --> 02:16:54.513]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.

[02:17:56.607 --> 02:18:00.171]  Alex, I gotta plug for the Patriot Points I get.
[02:18:00.171 --> 02:18:03.675]  I've gotten $180 so far this year, and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[02:18:03.675 --> 02:18:06.778]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[02:18:06.778 --> 02:18:11.563]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in, so I'd rather give that money to you.
[02:18:11.563 --> 02:18:12.685]  And I'm getting quality products.
[02:18:12.685 --> 02:18:15.087]  The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[02:18:15.848 --> 02:18:17.549]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[02:18:17.549 --> 02:18:18.529]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[02:18:18.529 --> 02:18:19.270]  I want a good price.
[02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:21.150]  But I've kind of habituated everybody.
[02:18:33.516 --> 02:18:35.757]  To where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[02:18:35.757 --> 02:18:38.019]  I'm making $2 on my toothpaste 50% off.
[02:18:38.019 --> 02:18:41.621]  And so it's the same thing with like the fish oil, or the turmeric, or the bone broth.
[02:18:41.621 --> 02:18:42.562]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[02:18:42.562 --> 02:18:46.764]  But listen, when people get the Patriot Points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[02:18:46.764 --> 02:18:54.469]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship, then we're doing 50% off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot Points, we lose money.
[02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:55.109]  But that's okay.
[02:18:55.109 --> 02:18:55.730]  Thanks for the support.
[02:18:56.226 --> 02:19:09.417]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[02:19:09.417 --> 02:19:12.320]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:14.081]  farming goods a week ago.
[02:19:14.081 --> 02:19:17.725]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[02:19:18.365 --> 02:19:22.927]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[02:19:22.927 --> 02:19:23.947]  That's beautiful.
[02:19:23.947 --> 02:19:25.868]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[02:19:25.868 --> 02:19:27.468]  And we aren't going to back down.
[02:19:27.468 --> 02:19:35.071]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[02:19:35.071 --> 02:19:37.472]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[02:19:37.472 --> 02:19:41.553]  The human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:19:41.553 --> 02:19:42.494]  And I'm asking listeners,
[02:19:43.274 --> 02:19:47.396]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[02:19:47.396 --> 02:19:48.497]  We are the resistance.
[02:19:48.497 --> 02:19:59.282]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[02:19:59.282 --> 02:20:01.924]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:23.584 --> 02:20:25.184]  Alright, I'm going to do better taking your calls.
[02:20:25.184 --> 02:20:26.465]  I got a little long-winded.
[02:20:26.465 --> 02:20:29.005]  It's just these times are so incredible.
[02:20:29.005 --> 02:20:40.167]  And I'm probably word vomit, but trying to explain just the fight right now of the... It's not even fair to call them the world elite.
[02:20:40.167 --> 02:20:47.028]  I mean, they're not even in a class that we could even understand or comprehend, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:47.028 --> 02:20:50.189]  But the barriers are starting to break down.
[02:20:51.485 --> 02:20:53.166]  So let's go back out to your calls.
[02:20:53.166 --> 02:20:57.430]  Let's go to Elza in North Carolina to lead us off this segment.
[02:20:57.430 --> 02:20:59.431]  Go ahead, Elza.
[02:20:59.431 --> 02:21:01.353]  Owen, thanks so much for what you guys do.
[02:21:01.353 --> 02:21:05.736]  You and Alex and David and the crew, you guys are great.
[02:21:05.736 --> 02:21:12.442]  I want you to know, let your people who are trying to do you in, like Soros and the
[02:21:13.052 --> 02:21:21.076]  Yeah, Google and Apple and all them, when they banned you together, when they colluded to ban you, I started listening to the show.
[02:21:21.076 --> 02:21:23.998]  And I have a feeling a lot more people did the same thing.
[02:21:23.998 --> 02:21:42.608]  And I've been sharing the links, and even before that, when I used to listen to the Blaze TV and Glenn Beck used to sell this nasty stuff about Trump, I saw your videos on the documentaries on Hillary, and I shared them with my family, who some of them, you know, a couple of them were like Democrats, but most of them were Republicans.
[02:21:43.197 --> 02:21:48.239]  Anyway, I was just really blown away by the fact that, you know, they used to make fun of Alex.
[02:21:48.239 --> 02:21:51.361]  And then as soon as I start watching him, I thought, he makes perfect sense.
[02:21:51.361 --> 02:21:51.961]  What is this?
[02:21:51.961 --> 02:21:58.924]  And so I start watching him all the time and I buy the products and I send out the links as often as I can.
[02:21:58.924 --> 02:21:59.764]  I'm pretty busy.
[02:21:59.764 --> 02:22:03.646]  You know, I run a farm and I also work full time and kind of getting old, too.
[02:22:03.646 --> 02:22:07.588]  But, you know, I really think you guys are a blessing.
[02:22:07.588 --> 02:22:10.489]  And, you know, I really hope that we can stop the
[02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:15.104]  Monarchy, I think it's really deep down, I think it's the Brits.
[02:22:15.104 --> 02:22:16.986]  I think they've been doing this for centuries.
[02:22:16.986 --> 02:22:18.828]  They busted up India.
[02:22:18.828 --> 02:22:21.250]  They busted up a lot of empires.
[02:22:21.250 --> 02:22:30.059]  And actually, if you read the Vedic literatures, my spiritual master, I follow AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, he actually said that
[02:22:30.812 --> 02:22:48.797]  England and Europe are European stock that Bali Maharaj years ago, many, many years ago, thousands of years ago... Well, Elsa, there's all kinds of different, you know, sects of power that have merged throughout time, and we're dealing with a world power right now we've never seen thanks to technology, but you're a blessing, Elsa.
[02:22:48.797 --> 02:22:49.637]  Thank you for calling in.
[02:22:49.637 --> 02:22:51.638]  Thank you for spreading our videos.
[02:22:51.638 --> 02:22:55.499]  And I think that what she was expressing is so common because it's like
[02:22:56.732 --> 02:23:10.222]  It's like, you can play the video game where you simulate being a football quarterback, or you can play the video game where you simulate being an adventurer on a treasure hunt, but this isn't a game.
[02:23:10.222 --> 02:23:13.684]  Cable news, mostly, like 90% of it, that's just a game.
[02:23:13.684 --> 02:23:14.525]  It's like a simulation.
[02:23:14.525 --> 02:23:15.866]  Like, oh, we're pretending to be news.
[02:23:15.866 --> 02:23:17.087]  Oh, we're pretending to care.
[02:23:17.087 --> 02:23:23.872]  No, we're actually out in the field, looking at the trail that's been blazed, looking at the clues on the treasure map, trying to get there with you.
[02:23:24.492 --> 02:23:26.233]  Uh, so this isn't a game here.
[02:23:26.233 --> 02:23:28.774]  But you know, it's funny, she brought up the lineup.
[02:23:28.774 --> 02:23:32.376]  You know, even in the middle of the censorship, we're still able to expand.
[02:23:32.376 --> 02:23:33.497]  And we're live 10 hours a day.
[02:23:33.497 --> 02:23:34.818]  Most people don't know that.
[02:23:34.818 --> 02:23:37.579]  We are live here at InfoWars, 10 hours a day.
[02:23:37.579 --> 02:23:39.780]  InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:23:39.780 --> 02:23:43.522]  David Knight starts it off every weekday at 8 a.m.
[02:23:43.522 --> 02:23:44.323]  to 11 a.m.
[02:23:44.323 --> 02:23:44.703]  Central.
[02:23:44.703 --> 02:23:46.564]  Then the Alex Jones Show from 11 a.m.
[02:23:46.564 --> 02:23:47.424]  to 3 p.m.
[02:23:47.424 --> 02:23:50.246]  And then I host the War Room weekdays from 3 p.m.
[02:23:50.246 --> 02:23:51.106]  to 6 p.m.
[02:23:51.106 --> 02:23:51.406]  Central.
[02:23:54.690 --> 02:23:59.591]  We're able to do this, thanks to the audience, spreading those links and shopping at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:23:59.591 --> 02:24:04.112]  But if you don't spread the links, if you don't tell friends and family, then nobody will.
[02:24:04.112 --> 02:24:07.633]  Let's go to Stuart in West Virginia.
[02:24:07.633 --> 02:24:09.754]  Go ahead.
[02:24:09.754 --> 02:24:10.734]  Hey, Owen.
[02:24:10.734 --> 02:24:14.855]  Congratulations, first off, on the Zach Voorhees interview.
[02:24:14.855 --> 02:24:16.396]  That was really terrific.
[02:24:16.396 --> 02:24:17.616]  So important to get that out.
[02:24:18.651 --> 02:24:35.234]  The reason I was calling is to draw a comparison between the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi reporter who was murdered inside the embassy, the Saudi Arabian embassy in Istanbul, and the Epstein murder.
[02:24:35.234 --> 02:24:39.675]  In the case of Khashoggi, which was last October, the U.S.
[02:24:39.675 --> 02:24:46.876]  whipped the world into a frenzy, demanding justice, demanding an immediate investigation
[02:24:47.412 --> 02:24:58.702]  Gina Haspel, the head of the CIA, personally gave Trump daily updates on who was involved, who ordered the assassination.
[02:24:58.702 --> 02:25:08.031]  Countries, I mean, Merkel, Macron, every European country was all over the Saudis demanding
[02:25:08.707 --> 02:25:11.408]  answers to this assassination, to this murder.
[02:25:11.408 --> 02:25:16.169]  No, I see where you're going with this, and yet Epstein gets murdered in prison and nobody blinks an eye.
[02:25:16.169 --> 02:25:17.249]  That's exactly it.
[02:25:17.249 --> 02:25:20.109]  It's like it's all being shoved under the rug.
[02:25:20.109 --> 02:25:23.010]  But doesn't that just show you the control of the media?
[02:25:23.010 --> 02:25:24.530]  Absolutely.
[02:25:24.530 --> 02:25:25.250]  That's what I mean.
[02:25:25.250 --> 02:25:32.732]  This is just, this is a case, you know, a perfect postcard example of the hypocrisy
[02:25:33.323 --> 02:25:33.543]  Of course.
[02:25:56.556 --> 02:26:02.062]  With all these phony explanations and everything else, it's exactly what you just said.
[02:26:02.062 --> 02:26:02.442]  No, no, no.
[02:26:02.442 --> 02:26:07.648]  And imagine that too, because it's like, they're all demanding answers from Saudi Arabia.
[02:26:07.648 --> 02:26:09.570]  I'm not even mad.
[02:26:09.570 --> 02:26:12.253]  I wish the media was demanding answers from Trump.
[02:26:12.253 --> 02:26:14.015]  I wish the heat was on Trump and Barr.
[02:26:14.415 --> 02:26:15.215]  I really do!
[02:26:15.215 --> 02:26:16.496]  It's ridiculous!
[02:26:16.496 --> 02:26:24.378]  But exactly, you pointed out perfectly, all this hysteria, all this hype, all, I mean, for weeks, Khashoggi, Khashoggi, Khashoggi, murdered.
[02:26:24.378 --> 02:26:24.998]  Whose fault?
[02:26:24.998 --> 02:26:25.458]  Who did it?
[02:26:25.458 --> 02:26:26.679]  Who done it?
[02:26:26.679 --> 02:26:27.919]  Story of all time.
[02:26:27.919 --> 02:26:28.739]  Khashoggi.
[02:26:28.739 --> 02:26:35.081]  But then the Epstein deal happens, which is much larger in scale, and it's just like, oh, suicide, no questions asked.
[02:26:39.147 --> 02:26:40.408]  Mohammed bin Salman.
[02:26:40.408 --> 02:26:41.949]  They demanded answers.
[02:26:41.949 --> 02:26:49.874]  They demanded that he personally, you know, personally assure them that it was not an assassination and that he was not involved.
[02:26:49.874 --> 02:27:00.942]  You know, I mean, and all of these world leaders with all of this moral righteousness that, you know, justice must be found, justice must be done, the answers must be found.
[02:27:00.942 --> 02:27:03.784]  I mean, you compare that to this.
[02:27:04.592 --> 02:27:07.635]  I mean, it is just night and day.
[02:27:07.635 --> 02:27:14.001]  It really is a great example, as you said, a postcard example of how the media controls the narrative and what people care about.
[02:27:14.001 --> 02:27:15.041]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:15.041 --> 02:27:17.103]  Let's go to Kevin in Virginia.
[02:27:17.103 --> 02:27:19.946]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:27:19.946 --> 02:27:22.088]  Hey, Owen.
[02:27:22.088 --> 02:27:27.492]  That blue dress is not Hillary's.
[02:27:27.492 --> 02:27:30.135]  That's Monica Lewinsky's dress and red shoes.
[02:27:31.579 --> 02:27:34.169]  It's more twisted than it looks at the surface.
[02:27:34.169 --> 02:27:35.875]  That guy is a sick freak!
[02:27:37.026 --> 02:27:38.326]  Oh, totally.
[02:27:38.326 --> 02:27:39.386]  Like, this is what's funny.
[02:27:39.386 --> 02:27:44.987]  This picture and the fact that it even exists just shows the clown world we're living in.
[02:27:44.987 --> 02:27:45.848]  I'm not convinced.
[02:27:45.848 --> 02:27:47.968]  I first thought it was Monica Lewinsky's dress.
[02:27:47.968 --> 02:27:51.469]  Then people showed me the picture of Hillary in the exact dress.
[02:27:51.469 --> 02:27:53.509]  There's some rumors going on about the red heels.
[02:27:53.509 --> 02:28:00.530]  Some people believe it is a symbolism, a call to pedophiles and a pedophilia symbolism thing.
[02:28:00.530 --> 02:28:05.451]  But either way, whatever it is, it just shows how sick and twisted and freaky these people really are.
[02:28:06.418 --> 02:28:07.499]  Hey, you know what?
[02:28:07.499 --> 02:28:08.720]  Judgment's coming, brother.
[02:28:08.720 --> 02:28:11.642]  Hang on.
[02:28:11.642 --> 02:28:30.957]  You know, and I just hope... Oh boy, that's... I mean, you think about how evil and wicked and twisted it's become and how just the average human has just watched it and even just engaged in it to some extent.
[02:28:30.957 --> 02:28:32.037]  Yeah, judgment is coming.
[02:28:32.037 --> 02:28:32.798]  You just hope that
[02:28:34.394 --> 02:28:43.782]  It's not going to be so merciless that everybody has to go down with these people because that's the level of Satanism we're dealing with here.
[02:28:43.782 --> 02:28:48.926]  That's the level of evil that we're dealing with here.
[02:28:48.926 --> 02:28:53.290]  And when redemption comes from God, it's not going to be pretty.
[02:28:55.891 --> 02:29:06.935]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[02:29:56.158 --> 02:30:09.321]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[02:30:09.321 --> 02:30:12.242]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[02:30:12.242 --> 02:30:13.982]  farming goods a week ago.
[02:30:13.982 --> 02:30:17.643]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[02:30:18.283 --> 02:30:22.847]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[02:30:22.847 --> 02:30:23.888]  That's beautiful.
[02:30:23.888 --> 02:30:25.790]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:27.392]  And we aren't going to back down.
[02:30:27.392 --> 02:30:34.999]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[02:30:34.999 --> 02:30:37.321]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[02:30:37.321 --> 02:30:41.485]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:30:41.485 --> 02:30:42.445]  And I'm asking listeners,

[02:30:47.311 --> 02:30:48.173]  We are the resistance.
[02:30:48.173 --> 02:30:49.054]  We are 1776 Worldwide.

[02:31:58.689 --> 02:32:02.172]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[02:32:02.172 --> 02:32:03.694]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[02:32:03.694 --> 02:32:05.015]  I want to take the globalist on.
[02:32:05.015 --> 02:32:06.977]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[02:32:06.977 --> 02:32:11.942]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[02:32:12.122 --> 02:32:15.085]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[02:32:15.085 --> 02:32:23.532]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus, but Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[02:32:23.532 --> 02:32:26.134]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[02:32:26.134 --> 02:32:31.839]  It's totally full of the bottle, and it is the strongest, purest krill oil, and it cost us three times more
[02:32:32.059 --> 02:32:36.742]  Because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[02:32:36.742 --> 02:32:42.546]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[02:32:42.546 --> 02:32:44.808]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[02:32:44.808 --> 02:32:45.748]  This is not real.
[02:32:45.748 --> 02:32:50.351]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:32:50.351 --> 02:32:51.932]  Real krill oil, folks, is red.
[02:32:51.932 --> 02:32:53.533]  It's not yellow, it's not milky.
[02:32:53.533 --> 02:32:58.777]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[02:32:58.777 --> 02:33:01.359]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:12.050 --> 02:33:16.391]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:16.391 --> 02:33:21.052]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:21.052 --> 02:33:23.912]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:23.912 --> 02:33:27.233]  Alright, we're about to be joined by Gerald Salenti.
[02:33:27.233 --> 02:33:31.054]  That means it's boogie time with Gerald Salenti from the Trends Research Journal.
[02:33:31.054 --> 02:33:32.014]  But first, folks!
[02:33:32.734 --> 02:33:37.617]  We've got exclusive breaking images right now.
[02:33:37.617 --> 02:33:39.558]  Literally, we've got the exclusive right now.
[02:33:39.558 --> 02:33:44.562]  They have just found a couple more paintings from Jeffrey Epstein's mansion.
[02:33:44.562 --> 02:33:45.622]  Let's pull the new painting up.
[02:33:45.622 --> 02:33:47.663]  They just pulled this one out of the Epstein mansion.
[02:33:47.663 --> 02:33:49.945]  Look at that portrait of Michelle Obama right there.
[02:33:51.223 --> 02:34:00.007]  You really have to wonder who the artist is that is making these amazing portraits of Bill Clinton in a blue dress, Michelle Obama flexing.
[02:34:00.007 --> 02:34:01.987]  Wasn't there another Michelle one that we found?
[02:34:01.987 --> 02:34:02.448]  Two guys?
[02:34:02.448 --> 02:34:06.709]  I think that they also found a second Michelle Obama.
[02:34:06.709 --> 02:34:07.430]  There it is!
[02:34:07.430 --> 02:34:08.190]  And there it is.
[02:34:10.891 --> 02:34:19.498]  New portraits emerging from Epstein's mansion featuring Michelle Obama as a muscle-bound roid head.
[02:34:19.498 --> 02:34:20.719]  Amazing.
[02:34:20.719 --> 02:34:22.481]  I wonder what other portraits will come out.
[02:34:22.481 --> 02:34:24.142]  Okay, we're having a little fun.
[02:34:24.142 --> 02:34:29.787]  We just found those images on the internet before somebody says, oh, fake news!
[02:34:29.787 --> 02:34:31.909]  We're just trying to have a laugh here, folks.
[02:34:31.909 --> 02:34:33.370]  It's okay to laugh.
[02:34:33.370 --> 02:34:36.352]  Gerald Salenti, Trends Research Journal, is with us.
[02:34:36.352 --> 02:34:36.853]  Now, Gerald,
[02:34:38.837 --> 02:34:50.239]  You came on The War Room with me two days ago saying, look out for a major recession, look out for the market to correct itself, look out for the yields to go low.
[02:34:50.239 --> 02:34:52.460]  Literally less than 24 hours later that happens.
[02:34:52.460 --> 02:34:57.761]  There's been a bit of a bump up back, but I think we're kind of still in yesterday's market more than anything.
[02:34:57.761 --> 02:35:01.022]  So what did yesterday's market represent?
[02:35:01.022 --> 02:35:05.322]  What do these low yields represent?
[02:35:05.322 --> 02:35:07.763]  Yesterday's market, down the Dow, down
[02:35:08.842 --> 02:35:15.929]  800 points represented factual data that no one could deny, that they keep trying to deny.
[02:35:15.929 --> 02:35:19.852]  We saw data coming in from China, very weak.
[02:35:19.852 --> 02:35:22.435]  We saw data coming in from Germany.
[02:35:22.435 --> 02:35:25.638]  I mean, these are the two, you know, power nations of the world.
[02:35:25.638 --> 02:35:26.919]  These are big economies.
[02:35:26.919 --> 02:35:31.623]  You know, what is the second and third biggest economies?
[02:35:31.623 --> 02:35:33.445]  Germany is going into recession.
[02:35:33.445 --> 02:35:35.006]  We had a contraction last quarter.
[02:35:35.967 --> 02:35:39.789]  You're looking at weak data coming in from all over the world.
[02:35:39.789 --> 02:35:45.071]  The UK, the pound is plummeting, and they're moving toward recession.
[02:35:45.071 --> 02:35:48.113]  Look what just happened in Argentina.
[02:35:48.113 --> 02:35:51.835]  Their market's down over 40%.
[02:35:51.835 --> 02:35:55.597]  The peso's down over 25%.
[02:35:55.597 --> 02:35:57.478]  Go around the world.
[02:35:57.478 --> 02:35:59.278]  India.
[02:35:59.278 --> 02:36:00.779]  One after another.
[02:36:00.779 --> 02:36:02.340]  All the economies are going down.
[02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:06.272]  And what they're doing is they're lowering interest rates around the world.
[02:36:06.272 --> 02:36:08.794]  New Zealand has record low interest rates now.
[02:36:08.794 --> 02:36:11.896]  They just lowered them last week, 50 basis points.
[02:36:11.896 --> 02:36:15.018]  Australia's record lows.
[02:36:15.018 --> 02:36:21.162]  India, I just mentioned, they're down four times they lowered interest rates.
[02:36:21.162 --> 02:36:23.063]  So there are real problems going on.
[02:36:25.051 --> 02:36:29.992]  What did the election in Argentina mean for these markets?
[02:36:29.992 --> 02:36:43.356]  Because it was tough for me to get a lot of information out of Argentina on this, but it appears it's kind of not necessarily a Trump-Bolsonaro candidate, but more of that ilk than of the globalist ilk, and it seems to be causing problems in Argentina.
[02:36:43.356 --> 02:36:47.117]  Is that an accurate analysis?
[02:36:47.117 --> 02:36:53.899]  Yes, it is an accurate analysis in that the guy that's in there now, Macri, and they had a primary election.
[02:36:54.486 --> 02:36:56.887]  To see what's going to happen in the coming months.
[02:36:56.887 --> 02:36:59.729]  They have the official election, I believe, in October.
[02:36:59.729 --> 02:37:01.330]  He got slaughtered.
[02:37:01.330 --> 02:37:06.032]  Matt Cree was built up, and we've been writing about this for months.
[02:37:06.032 --> 02:37:09.534]  Matter of fact, we did a big article in the November Trends Journal on it.
[02:37:09.534 --> 02:37:14.656]  And the reality is that he's one of the white shoe boys.
[02:37:14.656 --> 02:37:16.937]  They were so happy they were going to bring a pro in there.
[02:37:16.937 --> 02:37:18.078]  This guy's a businessman.
[02:37:18.078 --> 02:37:18.918]  He knows what to do.
[02:37:18.918 --> 02:37:20.159]  He's going to straighten this deal out.
[02:37:21.676 --> 02:37:40.862]  Yeah, they went to the mob, the International Mafia Federation, that people like to call the International Monetary Fund, and they borrowed $56 billion to pump up the economy.
[02:37:40.862 --> 02:37:45.704]  $56 billion, the most that the IMF ever loaned out.
[02:37:45.704 --> 02:37:48.665]  Hey, we'll loan you the money, but here's what you gotta do.
[02:37:49.827 --> 02:37:52.829]  I don't want the people having any benefits, pensions.
[02:37:52.829 --> 02:37:54.230]  They get nothing.
[02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:56.771]  And you raise the retirement age till after they die.
[02:37:56.771 --> 02:37:58.872]  Well, I'm going to give you the money.
[02:37:58.872 --> 02:38:00.173]  I want it back.
[02:38:00.173 --> 02:38:02.954]  You sell everything that you got over here.
[02:38:02.954 --> 02:38:06.356]  They're in a deep depression.
[02:38:06.356 --> 02:38:10.559]  You got 23 percent unemployment.
[02:38:10.559 --> 02:38:16.722]  You have inflation going up yearly by over 50 percent.
[02:38:16.722 --> 02:38:18.523]  You have the peso plummeting.
[02:38:19.491 --> 02:38:25.416]  The guy was nothing more than one of the front men for the mob.
[02:38:25.416 --> 02:38:26.677]  That's why he's out of there.
[02:38:26.677 --> 02:38:28.339]  Now they're bringing another mob back in.
[02:38:30.339 --> 02:38:32.900]  So one mob's replacing the other.
[02:38:32.900 --> 02:38:37.361]  As we see the stock market yesterday, again, I mean, a little recovery today.
[02:38:37.361 --> 02:38:39.502]  I think the story is still yesterday's market.
[02:38:39.502 --> 02:38:41.663]  It's nothing.
[02:38:41.663 --> 02:38:43.563]  Versus what's happening in China.
[02:38:43.563 --> 02:38:55.647]  I mean, what is the world watching as they see the tensions in China and Hong Kong, the trade wars with China and the United States, and the markets fluctuating so, I mean, sporadically?
[02:38:57.173 --> 02:39:00.396]  Again, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:39:00.396 --> 02:39:03.738]  You mentioned what's going on with China and Hong Kong.
[02:39:03.738 --> 02:39:07.521]  Now let's look what's going on with India and Pakistan.
[02:39:07.521 --> 02:39:10.243]  India's in deep economic trouble.
[02:39:10.243 --> 02:39:17.809]  The guy Modi, they just got re-elected Prime Minister, promise, promise, promise, the market's a way down, they lowered interest rates four times in a row.
[02:39:17.809 --> 02:39:21.071]  Look at the new car sales that just came out in India, they're in the tank.
[02:39:21.071 --> 02:39:24.334]  Have nothing to do with trade wars, the whole economy's going down around the world.
[02:39:25.825 --> 02:39:27.606]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:39:27.606 --> 02:39:28.767]  You know, I want Kashmir.
[02:39:28.767 --> 02:39:31.668]  They're going to rip up that 1947 agreement.
[02:39:31.668 --> 02:39:32.829]  Screw you, Pakistan.
[02:39:32.829 --> 02:39:34.190]  I know we've been fighting about it.
[02:39:34.190 --> 02:39:35.070]  You believe it's yours.
[02:39:35.070 --> 02:39:36.191]  I believe it's mine.
[02:39:36.191 --> 02:39:46.397]  We've killed over 50,000 people there already, but I'm going to get my people's mind off the problems they're having economically, and we're going to take over Kashmir.
[02:39:46.397 --> 02:39:49.779]  Go back to what's going on in Hong Kong.
[02:39:49.779 --> 02:39:54.001]  7 million people in Hong Kong versus 1.4 billion in China.
[02:39:54.001 --> 02:39:55.002]  Who do you think's going to win?
[02:39:55.703 --> 02:39:59.404]  Anyway, what happens when they win?
[02:39:59.404 --> 02:40:06.726]  They wipe out the Western banking system's Asian headquarters in Hong Kong.
[02:40:06.726 --> 02:40:15.989]  This is going to be a bank war between China and its allies and the United States and its allies.
[02:40:15.989 --> 02:40:17.749]  It's already happening.
[02:40:17.749 --> 02:40:20.070]  This thing is going down big.
[02:40:20.070 --> 02:40:22.191]  History is repeating itself.
[02:40:22.191 --> 02:40:22.511]  We're in the 1930s.
[02:40:24.514 --> 02:40:26.295]  Trade wars.
[02:40:26.295 --> 02:40:28.135]  Currency wars.
[02:40:28.135 --> 02:40:29.976]  Great Depression.
[02:40:29.976 --> 02:40:32.237]  World War II.
[02:40:32.237 --> 02:40:34.678]  Here we are in August.
[02:40:34.678 --> 02:40:36.419]  Trade wars.
[02:40:36.419 --> 02:40:39.340]  Currency wars.
[02:40:39.340 --> 02:40:42.601]  The Greatest Depression.
[02:40:42.601 --> 02:40:44.702]  World War III.
[02:40:44.702 --> 02:40:46.603]  If we don't change the course.
[02:40:48.553 --> 02:40:51.654]  So what do you think the course change needs to be?
[02:40:51.654 --> 02:40:58.635]  I mean, the president is begging the Fed to lower interest rates and help him out, but doesn't seem to be getting the response he wants.
[02:40:58.635 --> 02:41:00.956]  What do you think the president needs to do?
[02:41:00.956 --> 02:41:03.276]  It's not going to help that much.
[02:41:03.276 --> 02:41:08.297]  The last time we were in a recession, the Fed lowered interest rates five percentage points.
[02:41:08.297 --> 02:41:09.718]  They got two to go.
[02:41:09.718 --> 02:41:10.558]  That's all they have left.
[02:41:10.558 --> 02:41:12.418]  They're going to come up with a scheme.
[02:41:12.418 --> 02:41:13.679]  All the central banks will.
[02:41:13.679 --> 02:41:15.659]  They'll pump it up artificially for a while.
[02:41:16.215 --> 02:41:20.559]  That's why we don't see the Greatest Depression really becoming hitting the public.
[02:41:20.559 --> 02:41:24.302]  So they really know it until probably about a year from now.
[02:41:24.302 --> 02:41:26.804]  So what can he do?
[02:41:26.804 --> 02:41:32.108]  Redirect the energies of the nation to a more positive future.
[02:41:32.108 --> 02:41:36.592]  Number one, again, it's my Occupy Peace program.
[02:41:37.950 --> 02:41:44.738]  Bring home the troops, close the bases overseas, secure the homeland, put them to work rebuilding our rotted infrastructure.
[02:41:44.738 --> 02:41:52.186]  Happened during the Great Depression, the WPA, Work Progress Administration, Hoover Dam, the highways, bridges, all over the country.
[02:41:52.751 --> 02:41:54.652]  We bring that energy back in.
[02:41:54.652 --> 02:42:08.140]  Number two, what we do is rather than supporting the military-industrial complex to build these deadly weapons, we start developing alternative energies for real, putting trillions in to come out with the newest of the 21st century.
[02:42:08.140 --> 02:42:16.125]  We start building the 21st century and finally shrinking government from city level to federal level.
[02:42:16.125 --> 02:42:18.446]  You talk about Trump, look at the budget they just passed.
[02:42:19.048 --> 02:42:21.170]  Trillion dollar a year loss.
[02:42:21.170 --> 02:42:28.175]  We've got to start shrinking budgets on a national level, personal level, state level.
[02:42:28.175 --> 02:42:29.076]  All of us.
[02:42:29.076 --> 02:42:33.580]  We have to prepare, prevail, to prosper in the coming Greatest Depression.
[02:42:33.580 --> 02:42:41.166]  You know, I kind of want to just in the next segment, I think it'd be fun, maybe me and you should just, you want to just take 10 minutes and just bitch about taxes?
[02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:44.700]  Sure.
[02:42:44.700 --> 02:42:46.562]  I could go all day.
[02:42:46.562 --> 02:42:51.224]  I'm so sick of paying taxes, I can't even drive on a road that doesn't have ten potholes in it.
[02:42:51.224 --> 02:42:52.645]  It's a joke.
[02:42:52.645 --> 02:42:53.406]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:53.406 --> 02:42:55.147]  I'm sick of taxes.
[02:42:55.147 --> 02:42:57.008]  Thomas Jefferson predicted
[02:42:57.768 --> 02:43:08.312]  Over 240 years ago, that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[02:43:08.312 --> 02:43:11.234]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[02:43:11.234 --> 02:43:12.994]  farming goods a week ago.
[02:43:12.994 --> 02:43:16.636]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[02:43:17.276 --> 02:43:21.840]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[02:43:21.840 --> 02:43:22.881]  That's beautiful.
[02:43:22.881 --> 02:43:24.782]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[02:43:24.782 --> 02:43:26.383]  And we aren't going to back down.
[02:43:26.383 --> 02:43:33.990]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[02:43:33.990 --> 02:43:36.311]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[02:43:36.311 --> 02:43:40.475]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:43:40.475 --> 02:43:41.415]  And I'm asking listeners,
[02:43:42.196 --> 02:43:46.326]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[02:43:46.326 --> 02:43:47.429]  We are the resistance.
[02:43:47.429 --> 02:43:48.051]  We are 1776 Worldwide.
[02:43:55.080 --> 02:43:59.263]  The Globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[02:43:59.263 --> 02:44:00.324]  They are technocrats.
[02:44:00.324 --> 02:44:02.606]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[02:44:02.606 --> 02:44:09.972]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:44:09.972 --> 02:44:11.853]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:44:11.853 --> 02:44:14.175]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[02:44:14.175 --> 02:44:16.397]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect
[02:44:16.937 --> 02:44:17.517]  We're good to go.
[02:44:35.962 --> 02:44:41.946]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[02:44:41.946 --> 02:44:42.907]  It is amazing.
[02:44:42.907 --> 02:44:52.914]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the Second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:44:56.707 --> 02:44:59.128]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[02:44:59.128 --> 02:45:02.608]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[02:45:02.608 --> 02:45:04.129]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[02:45:04.129 --> 02:45:05.449]  I want to take the globalist on.
[02:45:05.449 --> 02:45:07.409]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[02:45:07.409 --> 02:45:12.591]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[02:45:12.591 --> 02:45:15.551]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[02:45:15.551 --> 02:45:16.271]  We got coffee.
[02:45:16.271 --> 02:45:17.152]  We got fish oil.
[02:45:17.152 --> 02:45:17.932]  We got turmeric.
[02:45:17.932 --> 02:45:18.912]  We got great toothpaste.
[02:45:18.912 --> 02:45:21.312]  We've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[02:45:21.312 --> 02:45:23.753]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[02:45:23.973 --> 02:45:26.574]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[02:45:26.574 --> 02:45:30.415]  It's totally full of the bottle, and it is the strongest, purest krill oil.
[02:45:30.415 --> 02:45:37.198]  And it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[02:45:37.198 --> 02:45:43.060]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[02:45:43.060 --> 02:45:45.241]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[02:45:45.241 --> 02:45:45.881]  This is not real.
[02:45:46.181 --> 02:45:50.808]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:45:50.808 --> 02:45:52.411]  Real krill oil, folks, is red.
[02:45:52.411 --> 02:45:53.092]  It's not yellow.
[02:45:53.092 --> 02:45:53.993]  It's not milky.
[02:45:53.993 --> 02:45:55.516]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[02:45:57.398 --> 02:46:14.063]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks in to people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[02:46:14.063 --> 02:46:18.165]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll shut us down.
[02:46:18.165 --> 02:46:21.486]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[02:46:21.846 --> 02:46:23.607]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[02:46:23.607 --> 02:46:27.850]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[02:46:27.850 --> 02:46:35.794]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[02:46:35.794 --> 02:46:38.496]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[02:46:38.496 --> 02:46:43.399]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[02:46:43.399 --> 02:46:44.599]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[02:46:44.599 --> 02:46:45.400]  They have side effects.
[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:50.165]  Not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[02:46:50.165 --> 02:46:51.226]  Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:51.226 --> 02:46:53.048]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:12.227 --> 02:47:15.429]  Oh yeah.
[02:47:15.429 --> 02:47:18.072]  That's the government right there.
[02:47:18.072 --> 02:47:19.513]  Taking your money.
[02:47:19.513 --> 02:47:23.436]  It's so ridiculous.
[02:47:23.436 --> 02:47:25.457]  You know, this is long overdue, I think.
[02:47:25.457 --> 02:47:29.280]  Gerald Cilenti and I are just going to sit here and just, because everybody's so sick of paying taxes.
[02:47:29.280 --> 02:47:37.106]  I mean, it's like, you buy something and you pay a tax on it, and then the government comes back a month later and says, hey, you owe us taxes on that.
[02:47:37.106 --> 02:47:39.228]  And you're like, for what?
[02:47:39.228 --> 02:47:40.029]  But before we do that,
[02:47:40.976 --> 02:47:42.076]  Folks, we've got big specials.
[02:47:42.076 --> 02:47:46.038]  Now, Gerald Cilenti has his Super Mill Vitality on his desk right now.
[02:47:46.038 --> 02:47:51.720]  Now, as Gerald Cilenti says it, when it's boogie time, it's Super Mill Vitality time.
[02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:57.563]  You can take that for whatever you want it to mean, on the dance floor, or, you know.
[02:47:57.563 --> 02:48:10.288]  But, there's all kinds of great supplements at Infowarstore.com, and if you are trying to get a little extra boogie time in on the dance floor, or after the dance floor, Super Mill Vitality is great, but Alpha Power,
[02:48:11.064 --> 02:48:11.445]  Thank you.
[02:48:26.837 --> 02:48:30.938]  We've got air filters, water filters, the emergency food supplies.
[02:48:30.938 --> 02:48:33.719]  Hey, you don't want the economy to collapse.
[02:48:33.719 --> 02:48:36.820]  You don't want there to be a larger World War conflict.
[02:48:36.820 --> 02:48:40.241]  But if there is, you're going to want to have an emergency food supply.
[02:48:40.241 --> 02:48:43.201]  So we have emergency food supplies at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:48:43.201 --> 02:48:44.902]  They're on sale right now.
[02:48:44.902 --> 02:48:47.182]  Big savings on emergency food supplies.
[02:48:47.182 --> 02:48:48.563]  It's all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:48:49.483 --> 02:48:58.730]  Your support at InfoWarsStore.com keeps us on air because we don't have big marketing, commercial advertisement packages that people buy.
[02:48:58.730 --> 02:49:01.072]  We don't have big billionaires funding us.
[02:49:01.072 --> 02:49:06.676]  It's you, the audience, true grassroots, true independent media here at InfoWars.
[02:49:06.676 --> 02:49:10.539]  And the formula is you shop at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:49:11.448 --> 02:49:13.789]  Before you go on, before you move forward, you were talking about
[02:49:34.577 --> 02:49:44.439]  You're to be prepared and the meals that you can do, the survival gear and the meals and the filters and all the things you have.
[02:49:44.439 --> 02:49:48.660]  This is time to prepare so you can prevail and prosper.
[02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:51.381]  You know, you prepare for the worst.
[02:49:51.381 --> 02:49:54.601]  If the worst doesn't happen, you've lost nothing.
[02:49:54.601 --> 02:49:58.362]  If the worst happens and you haven't prepared, you could lose everything.
[02:49:59.272 --> 02:50:04.333]  So when you're talking about storing up on food, water filters, everything that you need.
[02:50:04.333 --> 02:50:15.056]  And again, one of my GC's three G's guns, gold and a getaway plan, because when this breaks out, things are going to get very ugly and you may want to get away.
[02:50:15.056 --> 02:50:23.739]  And you better, you know, learn how to read a map and find out back roads to where you want to go to get away, because the whole system will be down.
[02:50:23.739 --> 02:50:28.640]  So when you have all these products that you're talking about, you know, a lot of them really have to do with
[02:50:29.301 --> 02:50:33.463]  You know, survival, in its truest sense.
[02:50:33.463 --> 02:50:42.888]  So, Gerald, I had to recently pay a license renewal fee for my vehicle.
[02:50:44.583 --> 02:50:48.885]  And it's actually not so bad here in Texas, the property taxes, but in other states it's really bad.
[02:50:48.885 --> 02:50:50.626]  But you know, I'm sitting here.
[02:50:50.626 --> 02:50:51.106]  I'm sitting here.
[02:50:51.106 --> 02:50:54.727]  Yeah, probably in New York, you know, they chop off your, they chop off your arm.
[02:50:54.727 --> 02:50:55.768]  Oh, this is what I want.
[02:50:55.768 --> 02:50:58.129]  This is exactly what I wanted right here.
[02:50:58.129 --> 02:51:00.330]  So anyway, so they send me the bill.
[02:51:01.840 --> 02:51:07.884]  You know, it could be worse, but it's just, you know, it's like somebody's coming and like knocking you on the back of the head with a baton or something.
[02:51:07.884 --> 02:51:11.286]  You're like, oh, like, uh, like maybe you don't have a concussion, but you're kind of stirred.
[02:51:11.286 --> 02:51:14.609]  And I'm like, you know, so, so I have to go.
[02:51:14.609 --> 02:51:16.070]  Oh, so Jill, so here's how it goes.
[02:51:17.096 --> 02:51:21.541]  So I have to drive to the government office to pay this bill.
[02:51:21.541 --> 02:51:28.970]  As I'm driving down the roads that I pay for via the government, I hit 10 different potholes, probably ruined my axle.
[02:51:28.970 --> 02:51:31.893]  Then I get to the government building and what?
[02:51:31.893 --> 02:51:35.197]  I'm waiting in line for an hour because there's 30 schlubs ahead of me.
[02:51:35.197 --> 02:51:36.799]  And then finally I pay the bill.
[02:51:37.279 --> 02:51:40.541]  For the roads that don't even work and the lines that take too long to get through.
[02:51:40.541 --> 02:51:42.902]  So it's just, I'm so sick of getting taxes.
[02:51:42.902 --> 02:51:44.423]  I want to cut taxes.
[02:51:44.423 --> 02:51:47.205]  I'd start cutting taxes and never, until I die, if I was president.
[02:51:47.205 --> 02:51:50.786]  I'd literally be like, alright, I'm just cutting every tax until I'm out of office.
[02:51:50.786 --> 02:51:55.689]  Well, we could start when we didn't have a federal income tax.
[02:51:55.689 --> 02:52:04.414]  And I believe that Woodrow, may he rot in hell, Wilson, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Bullets, Bombs, and Banks, who's the Princeton president,
[02:52:05.148 --> 02:52:09.431]  He gave us those when he started World War One as well.
[02:52:09.431 --> 02:52:14.455]  Gave us the Federal Reserve to away with federal taxes.
[02:52:14.455 --> 02:52:17.457]  We don't, we should not be paying them.
[02:52:17.457 --> 02:52:22.501]  Look, all of these jobs, again, I began my career at a graduate school.
[02:52:22.501 --> 02:52:27.084]  I was the number two guy running the mayoral campaign in Yonkers, New York.
[02:52:27.084 --> 02:52:29.626]  And this is a city of like 300,000 people.
[02:52:29.626 --> 02:52:33.108]  I was working on all the West Chester County campaigns.
[02:52:33.108 --> 02:52:34.249]  They sent me up to Albany.
[02:52:34.684 --> 02:52:36.345]  They were grooming me.
[02:52:36.345 --> 02:52:39.886]  I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate.
[02:52:39.886 --> 02:52:43.328]  I've been with presidents, princes, prime ministers.
[02:52:43.328 --> 02:52:50.171]  All these things are is that politicians create jobs for their friends.
[02:52:50.171 --> 02:52:53.193]  Morons and imbeciles call them bureaucrats.
[02:52:54.130 --> 02:52:55.992]  That's all this is.
[02:52:55.992 --> 02:53:02.837]  We should not be building one new government facility, city, state, or federal.
[02:53:02.837 --> 02:53:08.082]  We should be, again, with Trump building the budget, they should have been cutting the budget.
[02:53:08.082 --> 02:53:09.543]  Big time.
[02:53:09.543 --> 02:53:17.950]  I don't want to pay more money to give it to cowards, liars, freaks, and fools that people call bureaucrats.
[02:53:17.950 --> 02:53:20.852]  I'm sick of paying school taxes.
[02:53:20.852 --> 02:53:21.973]  Here's the way I look at it.
[02:53:22.455 --> 02:53:26.019]  The more kids you have, the more you pay.
[02:53:26.019 --> 02:53:27.620]  The less you have, the less you pay.
[02:53:27.620 --> 02:53:28.962]  I don't have any kids.
[02:53:28.962 --> 02:53:30.043]  I don't want to pay for you.
[02:53:30.043 --> 02:53:32.906]  Oh, by you educating our children, they're going to help you.
[02:53:32.906 --> 02:53:33.726]  Save it!
[02:53:33.726 --> 02:53:34.527]  Save it!
[02:53:34.527 --> 02:53:36.790]  Don't want to hear it.
[02:53:36.790 --> 02:53:37.730]  You want to have kids?
[02:53:37.730 --> 02:53:39.192]  You put them to pay for school.
[02:53:39.192 --> 02:53:39.913]  I don't want to pay.
[02:53:41.403 --> 02:53:42.925]  The taxes are ridiculous.
[02:53:42.925 --> 02:53:44.726]  I'm up here in Kingston, New York.
[02:53:44.726 --> 02:53:55.116]  We got this little nothing boy of a mayor, a little gutless little clown that cut down the trees in front of my most historic buildings in America.
[02:53:55.116 --> 02:54:01.743]  The only four corners with pre-Revolutionary War stone buildings where the seeds of democracy was sown.
[02:54:02.984 --> 02:54:08.028]  The whole place looks like garbage, and they keep raising your taxes.
[02:54:08.028 --> 02:54:12.732]  The taxes I pay are enormous, but nothing.
[02:54:13.624 --> 02:54:22.289]  The taxes they're going to raise on us, Owen, they're going to raise taxes on us as the economy goes down.
[02:54:22.289 --> 02:54:29.353]  They'll find new ways to shaft us so these worthless, garbage people can keep their jobs.
[02:54:29.353 --> 02:54:29.553]  No, no, no.
[02:54:29.553 --> 02:54:30.854]  They already figured it out.
[02:54:30.854 --> 02:54:32.155]  I got them figured out, Jill.
[02:54:32.155 --> 02:54:33.516]  This is what their new plan is.
[02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:45.316]  This whole minimum wage thing is such a front for them getting more tax dollars because they're going to raise the minimum wage, say $15, $20 or whatever, and then they're going to raise the percentage of taxes.
[02:54:45.316 --> 02:54:47.477]  So, oh, you know, oh, look at me.
[02:54:47.477 --> 02:54:49.258]  I'm getting paid $20 an hour.
[02:54:49.258 --> 02:54:50.619]  Well, no, you're not.
[02:54:50.619 --> 02:54:53.560]  They're going to take 60% of that now.
[02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:56.162]  And now you're actually only making $9 an hour.
[02:54:56.162 --> 02:54:57.902]  And the government's just getting more money.
[02:54:57.902 --> 02:55:02.265]  To me, the minimum wage hike is just government going deeper into your pockets.
[02:55:03.567 --> 02:55:06.969]  And on to that, I'm telling you what's going to happen.
[02:55:06.969 --> 02:55:10.912]  I was talking about what happened with Argentina.
[02:55:10.912 --> 02:55:12.793]  Same thing in Brazil.
[02:55:12.793 --> 02:55:17.596]  They shaft you on one end and raise the taxes on the other end.
[02:55:17.596 --> 02:55:20.918]  They call it austerity measures.
[02:55:20.918 --> 02:55:22.159]  They're doing it in Japan.
[02:55:22.159 --> 02:55:25.782]  They're going to try to raise the tax there 10%.
[02:55:25.782 --> 02:55:27.663]  They're doing it all over.
[02:55:27.663 --> 02:55:30.545]  They're going to raise our taxes any way they can.
[02:55:31.650 --> 02:55:34.613]  Whatever they charge us for, they'll make up something new.
[02:55:34.613 --> 02:55:37.635]  It's the same thing about the legalization of marijuana.
[02:55:37.635 --> 02:55:39.857]  What do you think they're legalizing it for?
[02:55:39.857 --> 02:55:41.078]  It's already legal!
[02:55:41.078 --> 02:55:42.900]  Mother Nature made it!
[02:55:42.900 --> 02:55:46.963]  No, we're gonna take control of it so we can get more of your money.
[02:55:46.963 --> 02:55:48.705]  The higher you get, the more we make.
[02:55:50.595 --> 02:55:51.495]  No, that's a good point.
[02:55:51.495 --> 02:56:00.297]  And then they even talk about, I think they were just stories out about how Colorado has become the first state with a billion dollar pot industry.
[02:56:00.297 --> 02:56:04.058]  And they're taxing it, you know, pretty high, pretty steep.
[02:56:04.058 --> 02:56:08.940]  So, but it's just like, I mean, so do you think they're making more money?
[02:56:08.940 --> 02:56:14.341]  They're making more money on taxes on pot in Colorado than they are on booze.
[02:56:15.436 --> 02:56:19.777]  And what right do they have to tax us to drink alcohol?
[02:56:19.777 --> 02:56:21.177]  To smoke pot?
[02:56:21.177 --> 02:56:22.637]  To take it as a medicine?
[02:56:22.637 --> 02:56:23.358]  Whatever.
[02:56:23.358 --> 02:56:29.739]  We got liars, cowards, freaks and fools running our world and ruining our nation.
[02:56:29.739 --> 02:56:34.440]  Morons and imbeciles call them Democrats and Republicans.
[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:37.980]  I call them the bloods in the crypts, murderers and thieves.
[02:56:37.980 --> 02:56:40.081]  I've had a change of heart.
[02:56:40.081 --> 02:56:41.381]  I think I want to pay more taxes.
[02:56:45.404 --> 02:56:49.049]  Then you should vote for Mr. Boogie.
[02:56:49.049 --> 02:56:56.238]  One of the taxes Mr. Boogie is going to put on you is a fat tax.
[02:56:56.238 --> 02:56:58.140]  The more you weigh, the more you pay.
[02:56:58.140 --> 02:56:59.221]  That's right.
[02:56:59.221 --> 02:57:00.643]  The more you weigh, the more you pay.
[02:57:00.643 --> 02:57:03.066]  Because look at the obesity rates in this country.
[02:57:03.066 --> 02:57:04.108]  Hey, that might actually help.
[02:57:05.126 --> 02:57:11.750]  Look what we're gonna have to pay for all of these people that are going to become very ill because they won't take care of themselves.
[02:57:11.750 --> 02:57:12.551]  Oh, I hate that!
[02:57:12.551 --> 02:57:13.431]  Like, that's the thing, too.
[02:57:13.431 --> 02:57:16.893]  It's like, if you are a healthy individual, like, I take really good care of my body.
[02:57:16.893 --> 02:57:21.796]  I mean, I'm not perfect, but, like, I have to pay for someone's health care that smokes a pack of cigarettes every day?
[02:57:21.796 --> 02:57:22.056]  You got it!
[02:57:22.056 --> 02:57:23.317]  That doesn't exercise?
[02:57:23.317 --> 02:57:24.218]  That eats unhealthy?
[02:57:25.058 --> 02:57:25.758]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:57:25.758 --> 02:57:26.458]  No, I want to.
[02:57:26.458 --> 02:57:28.499]  I want to pay more taxes.
[02:57:28.499 --> 02:57:29.919]  I'm a Democrat voter.
[02:57:29.919 --> 02:57:31.079]  I hate Trump's tax cut.
[02:57:31.079 --> 02:57:33.520]  Republicans too, repulsive kids.
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:36.160]  Democrats and repulsive kids.
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:41.941]  Trends Research, The Trends Journal, Gerald Cilenti, always fun.
[02:57:41.941 --> 02:57:46.202]  Cut the damn taxes, please.
[02:57:46.202 --> 02:57:52.703]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[02:57:53.598 --> 02:57:57.869]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[02:57:57.869 --> 02:58:01.598]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[02:58:07.250 --> 02:58:08.951]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[02:58:08.951 --> 02:58:10.171]  This is racketeering.
[02:58:10.171 --> 02:58:11.292]  This is cartels.
[02:58:11.292 --> 02:58:13.713]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[02:58:13.713 --> 02:58:15.594]  We need it now.
[02:58:15.594 --> 02:58:17.275]  You can take on Big Tech.
[02:58:17.275 --> 02:58:26.219]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[02:58:26.219 --> 02:58:34.262]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else, like dominoes, would fall.
[02:58:34.262 --> 02:58:35.143]  The way to fight back
[02:58:35.763 --> 02:58:40.609]  ...is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[02:58:40.609 --> 02:58:44.373]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[02:58:47.305 --> 02:58:56.673]  An InfoWarrior fan favorite formula, Survival Shield X2, continues to lead the way into the next generation of super high-quality nascent iodine formulas.
[02:58:56.673 --> 02:59:08.602]  Derived from ancient sea salts found more than 7,000 feet below the Earth's surface, every drop of Survival Shield X2 contains 650 micrograms to keep you in your prime form.
[02:59:08.602 --> 02:59:16.288]  Even today, iodine deficiency remains a serious problem, with the World Health Organization estimating that nearly 50 million people
[02:59:16.628 --> 02:59:21.231]  Still suffer from some kind of mental impairment related to iodine deficiency.
[02:59:21.231 --> 02:59:36.179]  That's why it's so important that you try Survival Shield X2, the only source of 99.999% ultra-pure, deep-earth iodine crystals exclusively available through InfoWars Life at an extremely affordable price.

[02:59:49.264 --> 03:00:01.147]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.147 --> 03:00:16.671]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, into the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show at InfoWars.com slash show, brought to you by InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:00:18.669 --> 03:00:22.733]  Matt Bracken is going to take over after this segment, but I wanted to play this video.
[03:00:22.733 --> 03:00:37.108]  I mean, part of me debates even airing it, but it's just like, just the matter-of-factness that these people speak of Trump supporters being racist with is unbelievable.
[03:00:37.108 --> 03:00:41.113]  And so here's Cortez in a sit-down interview with some soy boy cuck.
[03:00:42.395 --> 03:00:45.617]  On Pod Save America, some cuck cast.
[03:00:45.617 --> 03:00:51.321]  Here's Cortez and the cuck host saying every Trump supporter is racist.
[03:00:51.321 --> 03:00:56.544]  Trump becomes president and there's this debate about, you know, are Trump voters racist?
[03:00:56.544 --> 03:00:58.906]  And clearly, you see the rallies.
[03:00:58.906 --> 03:01:00.827]  I'm sorry, I need to do a proper introduction here.
[03:01:01.796 --> 03:01:04.478]  Uh, hi, this is PodCuck America.
[03:01:04.478 --> 03:01:09.803]  Uh, this is your Cuck host, and we're here with Alexandra Cortez.
[03:01:09.803 --> 03:01:14.347]  Uh, uh, so welcome to PodCuck America, Alexandra.
[03:01:14.347 --> 03:01:14.847]  Please go on.
[03:01:20.029 --> 03:01:27.815]  Like, I don't necessarily want to vilify people who vote for Trump, but at the same time, you also need to call racism out.
[03:01:27.815 --> 03:01:33.479]  And I don't know how, even beyond Trump, I don't know how we ever sort of piece this back together.
[03:01:33.479 --> 03:01:36.342]  Or, where are the spaces for these conversations?
[03:01:36.342 --> 03:01:37.763]  It's not Twitter.
[03:01:37.763 --> 03:01:39.804]  No, it's certainly not.
[03:01:39.804 --> 03:01:44.147]  First of all... You know what?
[03:01:44.147 --> 03:01:45.528]  I almost apologize.
[03:01:45.528 --> 03:01:48.351]  This is such low IQ drivel.
[03:01:48.351 --> 03:01:48.571]  I mean...
[03:01:50.848 --> 03:01:52.389]  But this is what the left is!
[03:01:52.389 --> 03:01:53.150]  That's what I'm saying!
[03:01:53.150 --> 03:01:56.552]  Like, we're not freaking racist!
[03:01:56.552 --> 03:01:59.314]  You guys are just stupid!
[03:01:59.314 --> 03:02:02.016]  That's really what this is!
[03:02:02.016 --> 03:02:09.801]  But they deny their own stupidity, and then they just mask it by saying, oh, everyone's a racist that I politically disagree with.
[03:02:09.801 --> 03:02:13.044]  So let's go back to pod-cuck-soy-America.
[03:02:14.019 --> 03:02:27.392]  I think the biggest mistake that we have, and it's a trap that gets set by the right, whether intentionally or unintentionally, is just the frame of asking, is blank racist?
[03:02:27.392 --> 03:02:31.416]  That's something that we have to pull ourselves out of.
[03:02:31.416 --> 03:02:34.579]  It's not about asking whether Trump voters are racist.
[03:02:34.579 --> 03:02:37.201]  We need to talk about racism, not
[03:02:37.842 --> 03:02:38.162]  Why?
[03:02:38.162 --> 03:02:38.863]  Racists.
[03:02:38.863 --> 03:02:39.844]  What is with these people?
[03:02:39.844 --> 03:02:41.225]  Hold on, hold on, pause it, pause it.
[03:02:41.225 --> 03:02:43.207]  I'm telling you, like, do you hear what they're saying?
[03:02:43.207 --> 03:02:46.510]  I'm wondering, like, do they even hear what they're saying?
[03:02:46.510 --> 03:02:53.637]  It's like that old joke from Arrested Development, uh, with Tobias Fuenke, I just blew myself, like, did you hear what you just said?
[03:02:53.637 --> 03:02:56.360]  It's like, I wonder, do, are they even listening to what they're saying?
[03:02:56.360 --> 03:02:58.862]  Do they understand how dumb they sound?
[03:02:58.862 --> 03:03:00.504]  We need to talk about racism.
[03:03:00.504 --> 03:03:01.645]  Everybody's racist.
[03:03:01.645 --> 03:03:01.825]  Yes,
[03:03:02.085 --> 03:03:06.688]  Trump's report is very racist, but how do we move the conversation beyond Trump's report of being racist?
[03:03:06.688 --> 03:03:10.851]  Well, we need to talk about how everything's racist, and ask what's racist about this.
[03:03:10.851 --> 03:03:13.292]  Oh, I have a toilet seat in my house that's white.
[03:03:13.292 --> 03:03:14.213]  Is that racist?
[03:03:14.213 --> 03:03:14.673]  Yes!
[03:03:14.673 --> 03:03:18.396]  You should have a toilet seat that's white and black, and then you're not racist.
[03:03:18.396 --> 03:03:21.458]  Oh, but you still might be racist, because everything is racist.
[03:03:21.458 --> 03:03:27.342]  Oh, but we have to talk about the racism, and then maybe nothing will be racist, but everything is still racist, so we talk about it.
[03:03:27.342 --> 03:03:27.402]  Oh.
[03:03:28.585 --> 03:03:33.803]  And then everybody that listens to my podcast is a bunch of basket cases because they think everything's racist.
[03:03:37.981 --> 03:03:40.222]  You realize how ridiculous this is?
[03:03:40.222 --> 03:03:40.542]  Stop it!
[03:03:58.530 --> 03:03:58.911]  Stop it!
[03:03:58.911 --> 03:03:59.311]  Stop it!
[03:03:59.311 --> 03:04:00.312]  I can't take it anymore!
[03:04:00.312 --> 03:04:01.073]  I can't take it anymore!
[03:04:01.073 --> 03:04:02.375]  Yes!
[03:04:02.375 --> 03:04:03.577]  Oh!
[03:04:03.577 --> 03:04:03.677]  Oh!
[03:04:03.677 --> 03:04:09.704]  The intellectual genius of Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez on PodCuck America!
[03:04:10.970 --> 03:04:14.933]  Yeah, yeah, because, like, there's no real issues in America like poverty and homelessness.
[03:04:14.933 --> 03:04:18.956]  By the way, I think nine police officers have committed suicide this month.
[03:04:18.956 --> 03:04:21.838]  Hundreds of veterans are committing suicide all the time.
[03:04:21.838 --> 03:04:25.701]  We've got, you know, on the verge of international conflicts that could break out.
[03:04:25.701 --> 03:04:29.865]  I don't think a bomb cares about what color your skin is, but... No, no, no, no!
[03:04:29.865 --> 03:04:33.568]  Racism is the big thing we all need to talk about!
[03:04:33.568 --> 03:04:36.250]  I'm on PodCuck America with Alexander Cortez!
[03:04:37.458 --> 03:04:38.118]  Wow!
[03:04:38.118 --> 03:04:39.779]  Alright, well I got good news.
[03:04:39.779 --> 03:04:46.641]  I'm signing off and Matt Bracken is taking over and in fact, I'm gonna take a little vacation starting right now.
[03:04:46.641 --> 03:04:48.382]  Alex Jones will be back tomorrow.
[03:04:48.382 --> 03:04:51.963]  I'm checking out and I don't know, I'm going into the clown world.
[03:04:51.963 --> 03:04:52.743]  I may never come back.
[03:04:56.155 --> 03:05:00.756]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[03:06:07.362 --> 03:06:09.784]  Wow, what a show today!
[03:06:09.784 --> 03:06:11.765]  The bar is set very high.
[03:06:11.765 --> 03:06:16.709]  Watching Alex from remote and Owen in the studio, it's amazing how good the sound was with Alex on remote.
[03:06:16.709 --> 03:06:20.372]  Really good, video and audio.
[03:06:34.932 --> 03:06:46.261]  I have to salute Owen for the terrific job getting the interview with the Google engineer, Zach Voorhees.
[03:06:46.261 --> 03:06:47.222]  That was really great.
[03:06:47.222 --> 03:06:53.787]  I mean, that just took it from Project Veritas' very good canned stuff and brought him in live.
[03:06:53.787 --> 03:06:55.569]  The guy's very brave.
[03:06:55.569 --> 03:07:00.813]  I just did a quick Google search on the engineer, and guess what?
[03:07:01.311 --> 03:07:02.792]  He's a terrible person.
[03:07:02.792 --> 03:07:07.436]  Just look at, like, the first five links on Google.
[03:07:07.436 --> 03:07:11.900]  If you look up, you know, Google Engineer, he's a terrible person.
[03:07:11.900 --> 03:07:13.181]  You shouldn't listen to him.
[03:07:13.181 --> 03:07:16.364]  I mean, he's a really bad guy.
[03:07:16.364 --> 03:07:18.646]  Isn't it amazing how that works?
[03:07:18.646 --> 03:07:21.749]  But anyway, great job, Owen, with that interview.
[03:07:21.749 --> 03:07:23.010]  Everybody should watch it.
[03:07:23.010 --> 03:07:25.312]  And like it was said,
[03:07:25.854 --> 03:07:51.171]  Download the zip file and get these things out so that they can never be they can never be disappeared the way that the way that Epstein's Testimony has disappeared and his any blackmail documents or videos seem to have disappeared We'll see in the coming days and weeks if there if Epstein had any dead man switches, you know
[03:07:52.099 --> 03:07:55.582]  Thumb drives sent to a hundred media people, things like that?
[03:07:55.582 --> 03:07:56.743]  Probably not.
[03:07:56.743 --> 03:07:59.226]  I tend to think not.
[03:07:59.226 --> 03:08:02.048]  Epstein, I guess he thought he was untouchable.
[03:08:02.048 --> 03:08:06.512]  He was still living in New York and flying freely around the world when he was arrested.
[03:08:06.512 --> 03:08:18.063]  It seems amazing to me that he didn't, years ago, bug out to some place with no extradition treaty where he could buy off the local establishment, maybe even get plastic surgery.
[03:08:19.027 --> 03:08:30.837]  You know, the fact that he was thinking that he was an untouchable, he must have thought that he had very good security from his blackmail videos, but evidently not.
[03:08:30.837 --> 03:08:41.125]  And they put him in a place where whether he committed suicide or was strangled by somebody that they let into the cell, we'll never know for sure.
[03:08:41.125 --> 03:08:44.267]  I would certainly doubt that he committed suicide.
[03:08:45.967 --> 03:08:55.313]  But just the fact that they had him in a place like that, where he was just dead meat, counting down the days until his lips would be sealed forever.
[03:08:55.313 --> 03:09:06.080]  There were a lot of powerful people that probably are on those blackmail videos, and now they're sleeping a little bit better, but maybe there will be some other things.
[03:09:06.080 --> 03:09:13.105]  You know, this Maxwell woman, who is not only one of the procurers, you might say she's a seductress,
[03:09:14.172 --> 03:09:25.898]  Like a break in to break in the new girls very similar in a sense in a way to the way that Harvey Weinstein operated, you know, Harvey Weinstein or the elderly.
[03:09:25.898 --> 03:09:26.839]  Mr. Epstein.
[03:09:26.839 --> 03:09:32.141]  They're not exactly Brad Pitt, you know in terms of the sex appeal.
[03:09:32.141 --> 03:09:39.445]  So what you do is you have female handlers to sort of smooth the path and show them the way shall we say
[03:09:40.111 --> 03:09:42.532]  And these women are still out there.
[03:09:42.532 --> 03:09:48.975]  They might have their own blackmail video files that they can bring in at some point.
[03:09:48.975 --> 03:09:58.480]  Not to mention, going down to Peto Island, Lolita Island, it's really been great seeing the drone video
[03:09:59.383 --> 03:10:09.519]  Paul Joseph Watson has some good stories up on Infowars and Summit News about the changing windows, you know, where the computers are shown and then the computers are gone.
[03:10:09.519 --> 03:10:13.165]  And then weeks later, you know, the FBI shows up.
[03:10:13.604 --> 03:10:18.847]  The famous but incompetent faking bogus investigations, FBI.
[03:10:18.847 --> 03:10:26.771]  The same guys that waited a month after Benghazi to get in there and recover any lost documents.
[03:10:26.771 --> 03:10:32.214]  This was like weeks after independent journalists had gone into the Benghazi consulate.
[03:10:32.214 --> 03:10:38.838]  But no, the FBI gives them weeks to either clean up the place or plant new fake evidence.
[03:10:40.763 --> 03:10:48.190]  One more thing, giving us more and more reasons not to trust our government, not to have confidence or faith in them.
[03:10:48.190 --> 03:10:55.898]  And if anything comes out of Epstein at all, because I don't think his blackmail videos are ever going to probably see the light of day.
[03:10:56.747 --> 03:11:01.088]  It's been a massive red pill for the American normies.
[03:11:01.088 --> 03:11:03.468]  People that just don't want to believe.
[03:11:03.468 --> 03:11:04.429]  Guys like Hannity.
[03:11:04.429 --> 03:11:08.169]  You know, 99% of the FBI, they're just great.
[03:11:08.169 --> 03:11:09.450]  They're really working hard.
[03:11:09.450 --> 03:11:11.230]  They're just great guys.
[03:11:11.230 --> 03:11:20.512]  Well, Hannity, I guess you could say, for all the great work he's done on exposing the Russia collusion hoax, he's still basically at heart a normie.
[03:11:21.161 --> 03:11:33.667]  You know, and he's kind of a member of the establishment in his own way, which we saw where he came to the defense of Frito Cuomo over Cuomo getting jumped very mildly.
[03:11:33.667 --> 03:11:46.914]  You know, compared to conservatives that have had drinks thrown on them, you know, had mobs just screaming at them and chasing them out of restaurants, a couple of goofballs come up in a kind of a friendly way, call him Frito Cuomo.
[03:11:46.914 --> 03:11:48.475]  He totally loses it.
[03:11:49.073 --> 03:11:54.078]  And this is something I wanted to mention this, because I really hadn't seen this aspect.
[03:11:54.078 --> 03:11:55.879]  Of course, I don't watch all media all the time.
[03:11:57.352 --> 03:12:08.060]  The biggest mistake that Frido Cuomo made was in branding himself for the rest of his life as Frido, the weak moron younger brother.
[03:12:08.060 --> 03:12:11.202]  We'll give him a job at the casino, he'll think he's running it.
[03:12:11.202 --> 03:12:14.664]  We'll give him a job on CNN, he'll think he's an anchor.
[03:12:14.664 --> 03:12:18.427]  He's just a conduit for the deep state and for left-wing causes.
[03:12:20.518 --> 03:12:21.858]  And but he'll think he's an anchor.
[03:12:21.858 --> 03:12:27.120]  So he totally owns the Frito label for the rest of his life.
[03:12:27.120 --> 03:12:38.663]  But going back to my youth, I took Taekwondo when I was in high school from an old Korean guy, tall Korean, hardcore.
[03:12:38.663 --> 03:12:43.364]  He told me back in Korea they practiced outside, snow, summer,
[03:12:44.011 --> 03:12:44.631]  I don't know.
[03:13:07.699 --> 03:13:21.170]  Be breathing through our nose, and the way he explained it in his not-so-great English, you don't want to let your enemy, your adversary, ever see that you're struggling, that you're afraid, that you're winded.
[03:13:21.170 --> 03:13:28.396]  You know, you want to show your same game face, your war face, all the time to your adversaries.
[03:13:28.396 --> 03:13:32.560]  And what Frido Cuomo did was expose his weakness.
[03:13:32.560 --> 03:13:35.042]  He flipped out over being called Fredo,
[03:13:35.774 --> 03:13:43.918]  And as a result, for the rest of his life, that's going to be the number one search result for him is going to be Fredo.
[03:13:43.918 --> 03:13:54.064]  So, in terms of our own selves, in terms of your own, you know, self-improvement or how you look at life, never let him see you sweat.
[03:13:54.064 --> 03:13:56.845]  You know, don't show your weakness.
[03:13:56.845 --> 03:14:01.728]  If you're going to have a moment of weakness, do it in private.
[03:14:01.728 --> 03:14:03.549]  You know, if somebody gets up in your face,
[03:14:04.338 --> 03:14:07.660]  The thing that he should have done is just say, hey, look, fellas, I'm here with my family.
[03:14:07.660 --> 03:14:08.601]  Can you guys chill out?
[03:14:08.601 --> 03:14:10.362]  And then even just walk away.
[03:14:10.362 --> 03:14:16.186]  But he actually, he actually empowered his enemies by showing so much of his weakness.
[03:14:16.186 --> 03:14:17.467]  All right.
[03:14:17.467 --> 03:14:21.530]  Today, I've got I've got a whole wide range of things to talk about.
[03:14:21.530 --> 03:14:24.112]  You know, the global elites, the crisis in Hong Kong.
[03:14:24.859 --> 03:14:26.360]  The red flag laws.
[03:14:26.360 --> 03:14:33.606]  Now the Democrats are openly talking about gun confiscation, which they call a buyback, which makes no sense.
[03:14:33.606 --> 03:14:38.130]  It's totally Orwellian newspeak because they never owned my guns.
[03:14:38.130 --> 03:14:39.751]  They can't buy them back.
[03:14:39.751 --> 03:14:42.774]  What they're talking about is confiscation now.
[03:14:42.774 --> 03:14:48.718]  Not only so-called assault weapons, they're talking about all semi-automatics.
[03:14:48.718 --> 03:14:53.242]  You know, up with the Las Vegas kill count,
[03:14:53.601 --> 03:14:56.864]  I think the next biggest was the Pulse Nightclub.
[03:14:56.864 --> 03:14:58.004]  That was pistols.
[03:14:58.004 --> 03:14:59.305]  That was Glocks.
[03:14:59.305 --> 03:15:06.351]  So now the liberals are talking about an assault weapons ban and all semi-automatics.
[03:15:06.351 --> 03:15:08.552]  They don't distinguish rifle or pistol.
[03:15:08.552 --> 03:15:10.214]  We'll see where that goes.
[03:15:10.214 --> 03:15:16.999]  I've got some more on Paddo Island and I'd also like to talk today about this film, The Hunt.
[03:15:17.608 --> 03:15:34.018]  Which I started exploring into this film and uncovered a huge goldmine of information about the producer of The Hunt, who's a guy named Jason Blum, who also produced the Purge series.
[03:15:34.018 --> 03:15:40.962]  And it seems like he's got a consistent theme, which we'll come to when we get back.
[03:15:40.962 --> 03:15:44.364]  And we'll see you on the other side of the break, and you've got me for the whole hour.
[03:15:53.263 --> 03:15:59.008]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[03:15:59.008 --> 03:16:04.112]  Now, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[03:16:04.112 --> 03:16:11.838]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[03:16:11.838 --> 03:16:19.724]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[03:16:19.884 --> 03:16:21.685]  Not a security IPO or note.

[03:17:15.704 --> 03:17:23.949]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:23.949 --> 03:17:27.871]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:27.871 --> 03:17:29.412]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.412 --> 03:17:32.353]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.353 --> 03:17:37.556]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:37.916 --> 03:17:39.118]  I can help you too.
[03:17:39.118 --> 03:17:42.042]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:42.042 --> 03:17:44.266]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:44.266 --> 03:17:48.712]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.

[03:17:55.758 --> 03:17:59.841]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:17:59.841 --> 03:18:06.186]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[03:18:06.186 --> 03:18:18.416]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here, from the bottom of my heart, to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you could say about people, that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[03:18:18.416 --> 03:18:24.801]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart, and I want you to know that love is right back
[03:18:24.881 --> 03:18:33.228]  And I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support, because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[03:18:33.228 --> 03:18:36.851]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed, and it's not going to be fun.
[03:18:36.851 --> 03:18:38.272]  But that's not what's important.
[03:18:38.272 --> 03:18:39.473]  The enemy could win.
[03:18:39.473 --> 03:18:41.615]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[03:18:41.615 --> 03:18:42.836]  We're being used by God.
[03:18:42.836 --> 03:18:44.077]  You're being used by God.
[03:18:44.077 --> 03:18:44.998]  This is Providence.
[03:18:44.998 --> 03:18:49.501]  So I salute you, and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[03:18:49.501 --> 03:18:52.944]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:18:54.192 --> 03:19:07.357]  Thomas Jefferson predicted, over 240 years ago, that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[03:19:07.357 --> 03:19:10.278]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[03:19:10.278 --> 03:19:12.038]  farming goods a week ago.
[03:19:12.038 --> 03:19:15.680]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[03:19:16.340 --> 03:19:20.884]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[03:19:20.884 --> 03:19:21.925]  That's beautiful.
[03:19:21.925 --> 03:19:23.826]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[03:19:23.826 --> 03:19:25.428]  And we aren't going to back down.
[03:19:25.428 --> 03:19:33.034]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[03:19:33.034 --> 03:19:35.356]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[03:19:35.356 --> 03:19:39.420]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:19:39.420 --> 03:19:40.460]  And I'm asking listeners,
[03:19:41.221 --> 03:19:45.366]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[03:19:45.366 --> 03:19:46.467]  We are the resistance.
[03:19:46.467 --> 03:19:57.219]  We are 1776 Worldwide!
[03:19:57.219 --> 03:19:59.842]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:16.455 --> 03:20:18.798]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:18.798 --> 03:20:28.248]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:20:28.248 --> 03:20:36.737]  It's almost impossible to overstate how disruptive Trump has been to the new global world order.
[03:20:37.668 --> 03:20:43.031]  He is he came out of like another another universe that he stepped through another dimension.
[03:20:43.031 --> 03:20:51.075]  They asked the left thought that they had Hillary's election sewn up for sure.
[03:20:51.075 --> 03:20:55.177]  And we don't know if Trump is going to be reelected.
[03:20:55.177 --> 03:21:02.941]  War could break out at any time, you know, with Hong Kong, Kashmir, other places, Iran, Straits of Hormuz.
[03:21:02.941 --> 03:21:05.702]  And as Mr. Solenti said in the last hour,
[03:21:06.351 --> 03:21:12.176]  When the bankers are in a panic, war is always the best reset button.
[03:21:12.176 --> 03:21:24.265]  Because if you burn down the entire global financial system, then all the paper is gone, and that means all the culpability for wrecking the economy in the first place, it's gone.
[03:21:24.265 --> 03:21:32.212]  The people who own real property, the diamonds and the gold, those people, after the ashes cool off,
[03:21:33.024 --> 03:21:39.947]  You know, they think that they can return from Patagonia or wherever they've been hiding out, you know, running generators.
[03:21:39.947 --> 03:21:41.928]  They think that they can return.
[03:21:41.928 --> 03:21:50.631]  And depending on which countries, because they're usually very diversified, they've got properties everywhere, depending on which countries regain stability first,
[03:21:51.383 --> 03:22:01.986]  They'll go back and they'll try to buy off whatever political order is reestablished to get the local establishment to recognize their property deeds.
[03:22:01.986 --> 03:22:06.507]  Now, in some countries, they may have just been, their properties might have just been seized.
[03:22:06.507 --> 03:22:10.208]  They might have been turned into communal collective farms.
[03:22:10.208 --> 03:22:20.250]  But in another country, they might be able to buy off the politicians and get their deeds, their deeds, property, their right to own the land reasserted.
[03:22:20.882 --> 03:22:33.590]  Push out the squatters and just carry on, but this time without the overhanging debt burden, which has been burned up in this coming potential World War III.
[03:22:33.590 --> 03:22:47.858]  Now, something that everybody needs to consider very carefully, and Mr. Cilenti hinted at this when he was talking about guns, gold, and the getaway plan.
[03:22:47.858 --> 03:22:49.459]  If there's a war this time,
[03:22:50.126 --> 03:23:02.336]  It's not going to be like World War II, where it's fought over in some other continent and back here in America all we have is some rationing cards and, you know, a little bit of hardship, but really not much.
[03:23:02.336 --> 03:23:18.850]  The next war that may or may not involve missiles or nukes, but for sure the next war is going to involve everybody doing cyber attacks on everybody else's electrical grid, banking systems, you know, this means water won't flow,
[03:23:19.486 --> 03:23:27.173]  Food won't be distributed and our American cities, and around the world as well, our American cities will go absolutely haywire.
[03:23:27.173 --> 03:23:28.554]  I mean haywire.
[03:23:28.554 --> 03:23:38.664]  And when this happens, it's not going to be like an elevator where you can fall from the 21st floor but hit the button and stop somewhere in the 20th century or the 19th century.
[03:23:40.894 --> 03:23:50.297]  All of the infrastructure that existed to support a 1950s economy, you know, the Sears robot catalog, that kind of thing, it's gone.
[03:23:50.297 --> 03:23:52.098]  That doesn't exist anymore.
[03:23:52.098 --> 03:23:53.939]  You can't stop at the 19th century.
[03:23:53.939 --> 03:24:00.001]  You know, the cast iron plows and cast iron machinery, those factories are gone.
[03:24:00.001 --> 03:24:02.342]  So if we go into an economic freefall,
[03:24:02.902 --> 03:24:08.424]  We can continue falling, and God only knows where we'll end up.
[03:24:08.424 --> 03:24:15.126]  I wrote almost a novella, a short story, you can just Google it and find it on the internet, called Alas!
[03:24:15.126 --> 03:24:21.828]  Brave New Babylon, kind of a worst-case scenario, but for everybody, and we don't want that, obviously.
[03:24:22.308 --> 03:24:27.753]  But I don't think that next war is going to be a matter of a little belt tightening, and we'll get back to normal.
[03:24:27.753 --> 03:24:31.176]  It could go really crazy off the rails.
[03:24:31.176 --> 03:24:41.305]  And to that end, I don't even think that having a water purifier is enough, because I would say more than half of Americans, they're on city water of some kind or another.
[03:24:41.305 --> 03:24:46.390]  If there's no power for days, weeks, or months, there's not going to be city water.
[03:24:46.972 --> 03:24:49.014]  So just fill in your bath tub.
[03:24:49.014 --> 03:24:52.178]  Yeah, that'll get you through the weekend or maybe a week.
[03:24:52.178 --> 03:24:53.459]  But then what?
[03:24:53.459 --> 03:24:56.563]  I mean, it can get extremely ugly, extremely fast.
[03:24:56.563 --> 03:25:02.650]  And that's where you need to think about things to prolong your life where you don't need to go out.
[03:25:03.320 --> 03:25:11.030]  Like a gazelle going to the watering hole that's surrounded by lions and crocodiles, which will be, you know, your looted local supermarket.
[03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:17.759]  If you're the dad and you're trying to go out and find food for your starving kids, and so is everybody else, and so are the bad guys,
[03:25:18.340 --> 03:25:21.543]  You want to be able to stay home for weeks or months.
[03:25:21.543 --> 03:25:28.308]  That means food, water, all kinds of supplies, a lot of which you can find in the InfoWars store, frankly.
[03:25:28.308 --> 03:25:31.271]  Things that can preserve your food, preserve your life.
[03:25:31.271 --> 03:25:36.355]  And if you are drinking ditched water or from the local stream, you are going to want those filters.
[03:25:36.355 --> 03:25:40.178]  You are going to want your long-term survival food because
[03:25:40.868 --> 03:25:47.971]  You know, if you have to go to the supermarket, which is surrounded by looters and shooters, you know, you may not come back to your family.
[03:25:47.971 --> 03:25:51.372]  So, seriously, these are very perilous times.
[03:25:51.372 --> 03:25:57.934]  We all hope that it never happens, but like Gerald Cilenti said, if you buy this stuff, it's like insurance.
[03:25:57.934 --> 03:25:58.975]  You hope you never need it.
[03:25:58.975 --> 03:26:03.116]  You stockpile it, it's good for 20 years, and you hope you never need it.
[03:26:03.116 --> 03:26:10.139]  But, by God, if you need it and you don't have it, and you have to go out scrounging for food with all the other starving people,
[03:26:11.024 --> 03:26:13.846]  It's going to be real ugly, real fast.
[03:26:13.846 --> 03:26:31.558]  And some of the dynamics that are building up that were mentioned in the last hour, when the Chinese are moving all these troops to the border of Hong Kong, there was a similar type of a dynamic, not quite exactly, it's not a perfect parallel, but in 1914, the European armies
[03:26:33.420 --> 03:26:37.243]  Move those armies up to the to the borders of their adversaries.
[03:26:37.243 --> 03:26:39.024]  Well, then you can't just keep them there.
[03:26:39.024 --> 03:26:41.846]  They're not robots that you switch on and switch off.
[03:26:41.846 --> 03:26:44.668]  These are human beings that have to be fed and housed.
[03:26:44.668 --> 03:26:48.090]  They they're, you know, coming from bases all over China.
[03:26:48.090 --> 03:26:53.734]  You get into a posture where if you remove them, it's going to look like a back down.
[03:26:53.734 --> 03:26:57.297]  And if you just keep them there, it's very difficult.
[03:26:57.297 --> 03:27:00.779]  So there's going to be a lot of pressure for the Chinese to move into Hong Kong.
[03:27:01.283 --> 03:27:05.545]  And I don't expect to see all those trucks and armored personnel carriers going in immediately.
[03:27:05.545 --> 03:27:22.914]  I think that even right now, as we're speaking, the Chinese version of the Russian men with green faces, you know, these are these are troops that are like Chinese Spetsnaz that are going to be wearing civilian clothes, easily able to infiltrate into Hong Kong.
[03:27:23.647 --> 03:27:46.612]  And then they can either set up watch positions, be in positions to throw the switches on communication and electronics, commandos with technical training, or kidnap leaders of the resistance, do false flag operations, snipe at Hong Kong police, which will then be blamed on the Chinese freedom resistance.
[03:27:46.612 --> 03:27:48.773]  All of this is happening right now, I promise you.
[03:27:49.443 --> 03:28:05.514]  In this scenario where you see the uniformed troops moving up to the border, you can bet already the Chinese special ops troops, not in uniform, are already fanning out all through Hong Kong.
[03:28:05.514 --> 03:28:17.903]  So it's, you know, God bless these guys that are brave enough to go out day after day waving American flags, which is really poking a stick in the eye of the Chinese dragon, for that to be on world television.
[03:28:18.543 --> 03:28:20.824]  It takes a lot of courage to do that.
[03:28:20.824 --> 03:28:35.088]  And living here off the fat of the land in the United States of America, if things go seriously haywire in this country, say after Trump loses an election and we wind up with gun confiscation under Kamala Harris, will we be as brave?
[03:28:35.088 --> 03:28:38.709]  You know, it's time to do an inside look and a gut check.
[03:28:38.709 --> 03:28:46.751]  And when we come back, I'm going to talk about some gun confiscation scenarios that are going to be unfolding in front of our eyes going forward.
[03:28:53.877 --> 03:29:04.921]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[03:29:54.358 --> 03:30:05.586]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[03:30:05.586 --> 03:30:09.728]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[03:30:09.728 --> 03:30:19.095]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[03:30:19.815 --> 03:30:21.835]  The system is vulnerable.
[03:30:21.835 --> 03:30:24.516]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[03:30:24.516 --> 03:30:28.157]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[03:30:28.157 --> 03:30:35.059]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.

[03:31:20.881 --> 03:31:21.922]  That's beautiful.
[03:31:21.922 --> 03:31:23.822]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[03:31:23.822 --> 03:31:25.423]  And we aren't going to back down.
[03:31:25.423 --> 03:31:33.025]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[03:31:33.025 --> 03:31:35.305]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[03:31:35.305 --> 03:31:39.487]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:31:39.487 --> 03:31:40.447]  And I'm asking listeners,
[03:31:41.247 --> 03:31:45.359]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[03:31:45.359 --> 03:31:46.462]  We are the resistance.
[03:31:46.462 --> 03:31:47.103]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[03:31:54.768 --> 03:32:10.660]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[03:32:10.660 --> 03:32:12.382]  It is completely independent of all that.
[03:32:12.382 --> 03:32:23.250]  It is an old-school, American, 1776-style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[03:32:23.450 --> 03:32:24.431]  We're good to go.
[03:32:43.368 --> 03:32:45.571]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:14.008 --> 03:33:20.857]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:20.857 --> 03:33:24.222]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:33:28.295 --> 03:33:37.919]  It's pretty amusing watching Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking about racism in America.
[03:33:37.919 --> 03:33:49.123]  And what we see from the left constantly is a total lack of self-awareness and just an amazing level of projection.
[03:33:49.123 --> 03:33:52.585]  When she's calling everything racist.
[03:33:52.585 --> 03:33:55.346]  Basically, if you're not a communist, you're a racist.
[03:33:56.478 --> 03:34:05.426]  If you're a black guy who hates communism, you're a self-hating black because you should be automatically with the left.
[03:34:05.426 --> 03:34:08.048]  That was the other squad.
[03:34:08.048 --> 03:34:11.430]  If you're a black, you've got to be speaking like us.
[03:34:11.430 --> 03:34:15.134]  If you're a Hispanic, you've got to be speaking like us.
[03:34:15.134 --> 03:34:21.979]  They have absolutely no self-awareness about the dangerous identity politics road they're taking this country down.
[03:34:23.873 --> 03:34:33.460]  I would say that Cortez, I like to call her Cortez instead of AOC, which is kind of giving her too much cred like LBJ or JFK.
[03:34:33.460 --> 03:34:44.407]  I just like to call her Cortez because Cortez was a pureblood Spanish conquistador who came to the New World and wiped out the Aztecs.
[03:34:44.407 --> 03:34:52.072]  So I like to just remind her of her Spanish white conquistador roots with her name Cortez.
[03:34:52.534 --> 03:34:54.716]  It's all I call her, Cortez.
[03:34:54.716 --> 03:35:03.123]  So, Cortez has been leading the drumbeat, calling ICE facilities concentration camps.
[03:35:03.123 --> 03:35:04.344]  We know what that means.
[03:35:04.344 --> 03:35:10.929]  Concentration camp, in modern vernacular terminology, means a Nazi death camp.
[03:35:10.929 --> 03:35:13.591]  It means Dachau or Auschwitz.
[03:35:13.591 --> 03:35:20.437]  We know what we're supposed to do when we're confronted with the real evil of real Nazis, like the Auschwitz guys.
[03:35:20.817 --> 03:35:22.438]  You're supposed to kill them.
[03:35:22.438 --> 03:35:27.783]  That's where we saw attempted bombing in the northwest against an ice facility.
[03:35:27.783 --> 03:35:34.248]  The guy was trying to set fire to a giant 500 gallon propane tank.
[03:35:34.248 --> 03:35:37.050]  I'm not sure how big it was, but a big propane tank.
[03:35:37.050 --> 03:35:39.412]  His goal was to light that thing off.
[03:35:39.412 --> 03:35:42.715]  And just a day or two ago, we saw in San Antonio,
[03:35:43.621 --> 03:35:51.064]  Somebody firing at the specific floors of ICE in a federal building in San Antonio, which means a rifleman.
[03:35:51.064 --> 03:36:03.208]  Somebody who had, you know, studied the range, knew how to count the floors, which isn't always obvious because sometimes the ground level floor may or may not count as a garage or the first deck.
[03:36:03.208 --> 03:36:06.889]  And so just counting windows is not always going to get you to the right answer.
[03:36:06.889 --> 03:36:08.610]  Somebody did some recon.
[03:36:08.610 --> 03:36:11.811]  They put aimed rifle shots into the ICE offices.
[03:36:12.412 --> 03:36:16.454]  This is really an act of civil war or insurrection.
[03:36:16.454 --> 03:36:18.555]  It's way beyond sedition.
[03:36:18.555 --> 03:36:31.200]  So, I mean, we actually have in the Constitution, sedition is mentioned, I believe, but people like AOC calling ICE, you know, Nazi concentration camp guards is going to get them killed.
[03:36:31.914 --> 03:36:34.016]  And it's already resulted in rifle fire.
[03:36:34.016 --> 03:36:40.541]  The guy who shot at the ICE building in San Antonio, I promise you, that's not as far as he's going to go.
[03:36:40.541 --> 03:36:46.465]  That's the stage that he's at developmentally this week.
[03:36:46.465 --> 03:36:48.527]  But he is not going to stop.
[03:36:48.527 --> 03:36:56.993]  In Portland this weekend, there's going to be another big face-off between Antifa and the Proud Boy types.
[03:36:56.993 --> 03:37:00.656]  And I think that we're going to see an escalation to the next level
[03:37:01.178 --> 03:37:02.280]  We're good to go.
[03:37:13.877 --> 03:37:18.659]  You know, radical Islamists, they believe that the ends justify the means.
[03:37:18.659 --> 03:37:27.142]  So any tactic that results in your cause being furthered is good, no matter what you have to do.
[03:37:27.142 --> 03:37:31.503]  So if you have to lie about whether you're a communist or not, sure, that's fine.
[03:37:31.503 --> 03:37:33.124]  It's perfectly okay.
[03:37:33.124 --> 03:37:41.327]  Likewise, if you have to shoot a couple of your comrades and then leave literature blaming the Proud Boys, they'll do it.
[03:37:42.180 --> 03:37:57.704]  They've already been talking about going in among the Proud Boys side with the Trump hats, wearing the MAGA hats and MAGA gear in order to provoke violence that will be blamed on the Proud Boys.
[03:37:57.704 --> 03:38:00.045]  This is the kind of tactic we're going to be seeing.
[03:38:00.045 --> 03:38:01.285]  And I can't emphasize enough
[03:38:01.704 --> 03:38:06.505]  How important it is, this ICE facility being shot with a rifle from a distance.
[03:38:06.505 --> 03:38:13.266]  It's the first maybe shot of an opening stages of what could be a civil war.
[03:38:13.266 --> 03:38:18.968]  The elites are extremely desperate and they're going to stop at nothing to see that Trump is unelected.
[03:38:18.968 --> 03:38:22.388]  They'll wreck the economy, they'll talk down the economy.
[03:38:22.388 --> 03:38:29.310]  In any way they can, they'll sabotage Trump trying to lead to his being not re-elected.
[03:38:30.848 --> 03:38:47.699]  In that vein, talking about Cortez and the Squad and her constant calls that everybody on our side is a racist, I was studying this film that's now supposedly not going to be released in September called The Hunt.
[03:38:47.699 --> 03:38:59.186]  And I was looking at it from the point of view of, you know, in previous genocides where socialists, you know, mostly international socialists, aka communists, but
[03:38:59.736 --> 03:39:06.898]  Also, National Socialists, before genocide, they always demonize and scapegoat their enemy.
[03:39:06.898 --> 03:39:19.100]  And I looked into this film and I found just a one or two frame shot that has a bulletin board picture of the people that are being hunted.
[03:39:19.100 --> 03:39:21.461]  And it's hard to see because it's kind of dark.
[03:39:22.034 --> 03:39:32.343]  But you can see on this bulletin board that there's a rhino hunter who looks suspiciously like Ted Nugent.
[03:39:32.343 --> 03:39:41.711]  And there's a talk show host who could be Alex Jones or Rush Limbaugh, a guy with a microphone.
[03:39:41.711 --> 03:39:46.916]  And there's a guy with a tiki torch, you know, that's the Charlottesville Nazis.
[03:39:47.887 --> 03:39:54.290]  But then you've just got some guys standing on the Capitol steps, politicians or lobbyists.
[03:39:54.290 --> 03:39:59.572]  You see a lady with a long gun standing in front of an American flag.
[03:39:59.572 --> 03:40:06.395]  You see a campaign worker and it says behind her, Range, which I think in the film context is Trump.
[03:40:06.395 --> 03:40:16.720]  So these are the types of people that the left think it's legitimate to kidnap, drug, take to some manor, and then hunt and murder.
[03:40:17.503 --> 03:40:20.444]  And I was looking at writing something about this.
[03:40:20.444 --> 03:40:23.806]  I'm writing for a website now called American Partisan.
[03:40:23.806 --> 03:40:26.107]  It's been out for a year or two.
[03:40:26.107 --> 03:40:29.808]  They've been inviting me to come over and I'm writing for them now.
[03:40:29.808 --> 03:40:32.209]  But I was going to write something about The Hunt and then it got cancelled.
[03:40:32.209 --> 03:40:41.813]  But in my research, I found this amazing thread where the producer of The Hunt, he's a guy named Jason Bloom, he's about 50 years old.
[03:40:41.813 --> 03:40:47.095]  He came out of Vassar College, extreme left-wing college, SJW University type of place.
[03:40:48.078 --> 03:41:01.889]  He goes to work for Miramax as a mentee under the tutelage of none other than Harvey Weinstein, the rapist and Democrat Party bundler and donor and fundraiser.
[03:41:01.889 --> 03:41:04.571]  Then he goes to work for Universal.
[03:41:04.571 --> 03:41:08.293]  All of his pictures have a common theme.
[03:41:08.293 --> 03:41:12.917]  They all portray America as this evil, horrible place.
[03:41:13.522 --> 03:41:20.846]  Uncle Sam with an AK-47, you know, the white cops tracking down and killing blacks.
[03:41:20.846 --> 03:41:24.248]  These are films primarily he's known for, The Purge.
[03:41:24.248 --> 03:41:28.090]  You can see on that Purge election year picture, it says, Keep America Great.
[03:41:28.090 --> 03:41:29.531]  Like, that's a real hint.
[03:41:29.531 --> 03:41:35.674]  You see on the left, you know, somebody's just blowing away a black chick who's on the ground.
[03:41:35.674 --> 03:41:41.157]  All of his films feature white guys hunting down and murdering minorities.
[03:41:42.249 --> 03:41:53.172]  In the Purge series, a group called the New American Founding Fathers has taken over.
[03:41:53.172 --> 03:41:56.813]  They're white, racist, evil people.
[03:41:56.813 --> 03:42:11.117]  And what Bloom is doing is conflating the Founding Fathers, George Washington, etc., with evil, racist, Nazi-like, slave-owning bastards who all they want to do is go out and murder minorities.
[03:42:11.577 --> 03:42:14.638]  This is a deep level of propaganda.
[03:42:14.638 --> 03:42:24.961]  And people say, Matt, well, there's been movies like Death Wish, and there's been movie slasher films like Halloween, but not like Jason Blum's films.
[03:42:24.961 --> 03:42:38.906]  Because what they do is intermingle the gory slasher stuff with a very anti-American, anti-white, you know, just a message that's designed to stoke racial hatred.
[03:42:39.506 --> 03:42:45.592]  And, you know, it's very lucrative, the guy's rich, but look what it's doing to our country.
[03:42:45.592 --> 03:42:48.975]  And I'm going to get more into this when I come back at the other side of this break.
[03:42:53.166 --> 03:42:58.870]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[03:42:58.870 --> 03:42:59.911]  Alpha Power.

[03:44:53.888 --> 03:45:07.061]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[03:45:07.061 --> 03:45:09.984]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[03:45:09.984 --> 03:45:11.746]  farming goods a week ago.
[03:45:11.746 --> 03:45:15.389]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[03:45:16.030 --> 03:45:19.951]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[03:45:19.951 --> 03:45:21.611]  That's beautiful.
[03:45:21.611 --> 03:45:23.512]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[03:45:23.512 --> 03:45:25.132]  And we aren't going to back down.
[03:45:25.132 --> 03:45:32.714]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[03:45:32.714 --> 03:45:35.055]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[03:45:35.055 --> 03:45:39.216]  And the human spirit lives at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:45:39.216 --> 03:45:40.136]  And I'm asking listeners,
[03:45:40.936 --> 03:45:45.058]  Whatever you do, spread those links, because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[03:45:45.058 --> 03:45:46.159]  We are the resistance.
[03:45:46.159 --> 03:45:54.443]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[03:45:54.443 --> 03:45:56.864]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[03:45:56.864 --> 03:46:00.346]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[03:46:00.346 --> 03:46:01.887]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[03:46:01.887 --> 03:46:03.187]  I want to take the globalist on.
[03:46:03.187 --> 03:46:05.148]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[03:46:05.148 --> 03:46:10.111]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[03:46:10.291 --> 03:46:13.276]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[03:46:13.276 --> 03:46:21.709]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus, but Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[03:46:21.709 --> 03:46:24.333]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[03:46:24.333 --> 03:46:25.395]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[03:46:25.795 --> 03:46:34.921]  And it is the strongest, purest krill oil, and it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[03:46:34.921 --> 03:46:40.705]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[03:46:40.705 --> 03:46:42.986]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[03:46:42.986 --> 03:46:43.907]  This has not been.
[03:46:43.907 --> 03:46:48.550]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:46:48.550 --> 03:46:50.111]  Real krill oil, folks, is red.
[03:46:50.111 --> 03:46:51.712]  It's not yellow, it's not milky.
[03:46:51.712 --> 03:46:53.233]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[03:46:56.681 --> 03:47:16.006]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.006 --> 03:47:25.628]  Okay, I'm going to continue now with this dive into the world of Hollywood twisted psychodrama that
[03:47:27.400 --> 03:47:37.827]  Generations of Americans are just swallowing, but it's really been getting worse in a very distinct way recently.
[03:47:37.827 --> 03:47:43.350]  I've heard people say when I talk about this film, The Hunt, but Matt, you know, what about Death Wish?
[03:47:43.350 --> 03:47:45.671]  It's just another revenge flick.
[03:47:45.671 --> 03:47:54.777]  In Death Wish, Charles Bronson's character, his wife and his daughter are like murdered by home invaders and the police can't find them and don't do anything.
[03:47:55.600 --> 03:48:05.386]  He doesn't, he gets a gun, somebody gives him a revolver, he goes out walking around the streets of New York, and muggers attack him, he shoots back.
[03:48:05.386 --> 03:48:15.673]  This is in no way anything like The Hunt, where deplorable conservative red staters are kidnapped and hunted by liberals.
[03:48:15.673 --> 03:48:20.776]  In fact, it's said that the original title was going to be Red State vs. Blue State.
[03:48:21.528 --> 03:48:26.533]  And other people will say, but Matt, there's always been slasher films.
[03:48:26.533 --> 03:48:32.059]  These aren't just gory slasher films, you know, The Purge, The Hunt.
[03:48:32.059 --> 03:48:35.002]  These are political films with a point.
[03:48:35.769 --> 03:48:41.412]  And as far as the hunt, people say, yeah, but Matt, in the trailer, it looks like the blonde Betty Gilpin.
[03:48:41.412 --> 03:48:42.273]  She kicks ass.
[03:48:42.273 --> 03:48:43.473]  She turns the tables.
[03:48:43.473 --> 03:48:50.137]  You know, she makes the blue state champagne sippers, the caviar guys on the jet.
[03:48:50.137 --> 03:48:51.158]  She takes it to them.
[03:48:51.158 --> 03:48:57.981]  Hey there.
[03:48:57.981 --> 03:48:59.422]  Help you?
[03:48:59.422 --> 03:49:01.443]  What state is this?
[03:49:01.443 --> 03:49:01.723]  Sorry?
[03:49:01.723 --> 03:49:04.365]  You don't understand the question?
[03:49:05.643 --> 03:49:07.364]  Oh, no, I didn't.
[03:49:07.364 --> 03:49:09.967]  Most people know where they are.
[03:49:09.967 --> 03:49:11.168]  Well, I ain't most people.
[03:49:11.168 --> 03:49:21.299]  You're in the glorious state of Arkansas, sweetheart.
[03:49:21.299 --> 03:49:24.963]  How'd you know they was lying?
[03:49:24.963 --> 03:49:27.926]  Well, this ain't Arkansas, so everyone is lying.
[03:49:30.404 --> 03:49:32.505]  Your idea is incredible.
[03:49:32.505 --> 03:49:33.985]  I can't argue with that.
[03:49:33.985 --> 03:49:35.106]  We pay for everything.
[03:49:35.106 --> 03:49:37.287]  So this country belongs to us.
[03:49:37.287 --> 03:49:39.668]  It's just business.
[03:49:39.668 --> 03:49:43.209]  Haunting human beings for sport.
[03:49:43.209 --> 03:49:49.652]  They're not human beings.
[03:49:49.652 --> 03:49:54.494]  Every year, a bunch of elites kidnap normal folk like us.
[03:49:54.494 --> 03:49:55.414]  Where'd they get you from?
[03:49:55.414 --> 03:49:56.015]  Wyoming.
[03:49:56.015 --> 03:49:56.715]  Mississippi.
[03:49:56.715 --> 03:49:58.015]  Orlando.
[03:49:58.015 --> 03:49:59.416]  And hunt us for sport.
[03:50:01.186 --> 03:50:04.567]  Hurry, hurry, hurry up!
[03:50:04.567 --> 03:50:06.227]  So it's true.
[03:50:06.227 --> 03:50:09.628]  We're being hunted.
[03:50:09.628 --> 03:50:10.668]  Hey!
[03:50:10.668 --> 03:50:11.368]  One of them's awake!
[03:50:11.368 --> 03:50:12.688]  What is happening?
[03:50:12.688 --> 03:50:17.069]  Put him in the back with the rest.
[03:50:17.069 --> 03:50:20.730]  Now they can't see us.
[03:50:20.730 --> 03:50:26.511]  You just told them we're here.
[03:50:26.511 --> 03:50:26.971]  What was that?
[03:50:30.725 --> 03:50:31.766]  I think that was a rifle.
[03:50:31.766 --> 03:50:32.746]  Come on!
[03:50:32.746 --> 03:50:35.048]  Everybody get out of here!
[03:50:35.048 --> 03:50:36.829]  Jesus!
[03:50:36.829 --> 03:50:39.771]  Come on!
[03:50:39.771 --> 03:50:40.792]  Who are these people?
[03:50:40.792 --> 03:50:44.194]  How are they getting away with this?
[03:50:44.194 --> 03:50:49.138]  You have no idea what you're up against.
[03:50:49.138 --> 03:50:50.259]  They're playing you!
[03:50:50.259 --> 03:50:52.720]  I'll tear you to pieces.
[03:50:52.720 --> 03:50:54.902]  We'll see.
[03:50:54.902 --> 03:50:57.624]  Of all the people you kidnapped.
[03:50:57.624 --> 03:50:58.945]  Of all the people you killed.
[03:51:00.274 --> 03:51:03.578]  You picked the wrong game.
[03:51:03.578 --> 03:51:16.512]  Lady, you're crazy.
[03:51:16.512 --> 03:51:18.474]  Okay.
[03:51:18.474 --> 03:51:21.638]  A lot of folks, like I was saying, a lot of folks will say, but Matt,
[03:51:22.366 --> 03:51:31.190]  The script flips against the blue crazy people, and the red state guys take them down.
[03:51:31.190 --> 03:51:38.313]  That's true, but as far as I'm concerned, looking at Jason Blum's entire track record, this is purely a fig leaf.
[03:51:38.313 --> 03:51:47.197]  There's no way he could make a film where the blue state killers are shown as the heroes just tracking down and exterminating these Untermenschen.
[03:51:47.197 --> 03:51:48.998]  But they make their points along the way,
[03:51:49.901 --> 03:51:56.344]  Like, where the Ted Nugent rhino hunter is killed with arrows, graphically, up close.
[03:51:56.344 --> 03:52:04.667]  So, all through the movie, what they're doing is desensitizing the viewers, getting them used to the idea of hunting these deplorables.
[03:52:04.667 --> 03:52:09.749]  Sure, the deplorables might, in the end, flip the switch for a while.
[03:52:10.393 --> 03:52:18.498]  But this is all designed to turn up the heat under the latent civil war, the cold civil war.
[03:52:18.498 --> 03:52:26.342]  Jason Blum, his goal here is, in every one of his movies, stoke racial hatred, stoke anti-Americanism.
[03:52:26.342 --> 03:52:31.145]  Any association with guns and firearms, American flag, it's evil.
[03:52:31.704 --> 03:52:34.926]  You know, George Washington, Uncle Sam, they're evil.
[03:52:34.926 --> 03:52:36.988]  And that's his entire shtick.
[03:52:36.988 --> 03:52:40.290]  One of his movies that I saw recently is called Get Out.
[03:52:40.290 --> 03:52:41.731]  It's a really good movie.
[03:52:41.731 --> 03:52:43.913]  I mean, it's well done in that sense.
[03:52:43.913 --> 03:52:46.835]  But what is the plot of Get Out?
[03:52:46.835 --> 03:52:56.402]  Some evil white guys that are very rich, they trick and kidnap young black guys to coming out like, you know, you're my daughter's new boyfriend.
[03:52:56.402 --> 03:52:59.604]  Come out to our estate somewhere in New England, it looks like.
[03:53:00.336 --> 03:53:17.001]  And then we chain you up in the basement and perform some kind of a lobotomy where we're going to put the mind of some old geriatric white person into the young healthy black guy and turn them into like a something like a zombie with the memory of the old white guy.
[03:53:17.001 --> 03:53:25.183]  All of his movies involve hatred for America, hatred for whites, and he's a white guy but he's making
[03:53:25.973 --> 03:53:28.495]  Tons of money, you know, off of these films.
[03:53:28.495 --> 03:53:32.598]  So, there are people out there, they don't care if they're stoking a civil war.
[03:53:32.598 --> 03:53:33.978]  It doesn't matter.
[03:53:33.978 --> 03:53:36.320]  As long as they've got their cash.
[03:53:36.320 --> 03:53:40.663]  I guarantee you, people like that, they don't think this will ever touch them.
[03:53:40.663 --> 03:53:44.345]  And it's getting really sick, and it's not just in the films.
[03:53:44.345 --> 03:53:47.688]  You know, there's this guy named Reza Aslan.
[03:53:47.688 --> 03:53:52.291]  He had a show on CNN, kind of like trying to be a political Anthony Bourdain,
[03:53:53.092 --> 03:53:58.114]  But he got fired when the Hindus didn't appreciate him eating human brains on camera.
[03:53:58.114 --> 03:53:59.234]  It's a long story.
[03:53:59.234 --> 03:54:09.898]  But he's still a college professor in California in good standing, teaching our, you know, students that are paying a fortune or taking loans to go out for a fortune.
[03:54:09.898 --> 03:54:12.920]  Reza Aslan, he has tweets up that are unbelievable.
[03:54:12.920 --> 03:54:19.482]  He is a blue check famous guy with thousands, you know, how many, umpteen thousand followers.
[03:54:19.482 --> 03:54:21.203]  He has a tweet that's still up.
[03:54:21.203 --> 03:54:21.783]  I'm going to read it.
[03:54:22.629 --> 03:54:26.092]  After today, there is no longer any room for nuance.
[03:54:26.092 --> 03:54:29.494]  The president is a white nationalist terror leader.
[03:54:29.494 --> 03:54:35.659]  His supporters, all of them in caps, are by definition white nationalist terror supporters.
[03:54:35.659 --> 03:54:38.561]  The MAGA hat is a KKK hood.
[03:54:38.561 --> 03:54:48.389]  And this evil racist scourge, that's us, Trump voters, this evil racist scourge must be eradicated from society.
[03:54:48.389 --> 03:54:49.510]  Twitter is cool with that.
[03:54:50.168 --> 03:54:56.573]  You know, I got perma-banned from Twitter for posting a burqa meme that didn't even name a religion.
[03:54:56.573 --> 03:55:04.660]  It just showed a succession of a woman and a daughter going from like a very loose hijab to a total blackout burqa.
[03:55:04.660 --> 03:55:07.622]  I got perma-banned as an Islamophobe.
[03:55:07.622 --> 03:55:15.548]  But you can call for the eradication of all Trump supporters, and it's fine with, you know, left-wing social media.
[03:55:15.548 --> 03:55:17.770]  So, when seen through this lens,
[03:55:18.496 --> 03:55:25.281]  The films of Jason Blum, you know, anti-American, anti-white, stoking racial hatred.
[03:55:25.281 --> 03:55:33.887]  And you have AOC, Cortez, she's calling ICE, the people that work for ICE, concentration camp guards.
[03:55:33.887 --> 03:55:36.710]  She's saying, oh, I never thought I would see this in America.
[03:55:36.710 --> 03:55:42.814]  There's nothing you can call them but concentration camps, which means Auschwitz and Dachau.
[03:55:42.814 --> 03:55:45.176]  So no wonder people are taking pot shots
[03:55:45.831 --> 03:55:48.052]  At the ICE facility in San Antonio.
[03:55:48.052 --> 03:55:49.673]  And not even pot shots.
[03:55:49.673 --> 03:55:54.735]  Aimed shots going dead through the window of the ICE offices.
[03:55:54.735 --> 03:55:57.396]  I mean, they were right through the window.
[03:55:57.396 --> 03:55:59.777]  And if somebody had been standing there, they would have died.
[03:55:59.777 --> 03:56:05.620]  And that was somebody that's still out there, still has the rifle, still has the scope.
[03:56:05.620 --> 03:56:07.941]  So we're in very dangerous times.
[03:56:07.941 --> 03:56:10.002]  Now, here's where I'm going to end today.
[03:56:10.751 --> 03:56:18.675]  The left believes that by hook or by crook, they're going to use their old Alinsky and Gramsci and Marx playbooks.
[03:56:18.675 --> 03:56:23.317]  And they're going to trick hoodwink, elect their way into power.
[03:56:23.317 --> 03:56:28.260]  And once they're in power, they'll just be able to ratchet up the taxes, confiscate our guns,
[03:56:28.920 --> 03:56:34.461]  And for our own good, whether we like it or not, shove socialism down our throats.
[03:56:34.461 --> 03:56:43.423]  And make it like California, that we can never ever throw them out of office, because by then they'll own the Supreme Court.
[03:56:43.423 --> 03:56:46.544]  They're talking about packing the Supreme Court.
[03:56:46.544 --> 03:56:49.305]  They'll own every judicial level.
[03:56:49.305 --> 03:56:50.825]  They already own 90% of the media.
[03:56:50.825 --> 03:56:52.265]  They own 99% of colleges and universities that are
[03:56:55.586 --> 03:56:59.834]  You know, turning out little Marxist robots by the millions.
[03:56:59.834 --> 03:57:03.000]  But what they don't factor in, this is their lack of self-awareness.
[03:57:03.795 --> 03:57:16.460]  They are going to meet an iron resistance from half of the country that are Trump owners, and there are 400 million guns out there, and we're not just going to get on the boxcar.
[03:57:16.460 --> 03:57:18.701]  We're not going to drink the Kool-Aid.
[03:57:18.701 --> 03:57:26.424]  They think that they're just going to, one way or the other, turn the entire country into California so it can never be switched back.
[03:57:27.004 --> 03:57:35.371]  But when they come for the guns, when they do this mandatory compensated confiscation, it's going to go back on them.
[03:57:35.371 --> 03:57:41.537]  And the police that, any police that go on confiscation raids, you're not my brother and God help you.
