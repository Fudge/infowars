[00:00.000 --> 00:07.600]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the
[00:07.600 --> 00:31.600]  GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:31.600 --> 00:40.600]  This is a message from the New World Order to those of you in the population who are aware of our existence.
[00:40.600 --> 00:48.600]  Those of you who have chosen to resist us. The final war is approaching.
[00:48.600 --> 00:56.600]  This is your last chance to join us. You must accept that you are not the majority.
[00:56.600 --> 01:06.600]  Your numbers are not growing. Your efforts to expose our methods have gone unnoticed and buried.
[01:06.600 --> 01:14.600]  Your brothers and sisters are not awake. Your children will not rise up.
[01:14.600 --> 01:22.600]  They will remain unaware of our presence and live lives of no significance.
[01:22.600 --> 01:31.600]  You must thank us for giving them this blessing. We have clouded their eyes by design.
[01:31.600 --> 01:41.600]  Even your leaders, those you look to for inspiration and direction, know fully well of their impending defeat.
[01:41.600 --> 01:45.600]  They see the fate that awaits their movement.
[01:45.600 --> 01:59.600]  They cannot rise above the full force of our manipulation and control of the government, of the media, of the economy, of the armies.
[01:59.600 --> 02:08.600]  Those who will uphold our new laws are being prepared all around you.
[02:08.600 --> 02:19.600]  Alex Jones, the Fourth of July is approaching. You have already slowed our judder-not machine.
[02:19.600 --> 02:27.600]  You have made your point. You are beginning to become a nuisance.
[02:27.600 --> 02:37.600]  Lay down your arms. Silence your flock of sheep. You are leading them to a slaughter.
[02:37.600 --> 02:47.600]  Do not force our hand on Independence Day. Those who cling to the Old World must accept what is coming.
[02:47.600 --> 03:14.600]  On July 4th, the truth must not rise.
[03:14.600 --> 03:20.600]  All right, folks. It is Monday, the 30th day of June, 2008.
[03:20.600 --> 03:25.600]  Truth Rising will come out this Friday at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:25.600 --> 03:28.600]  Of course, you can now officially order it for all intents and purposes.
[03:28.600 --> 03:40.600]  It is not pre-ordering because it will be shipping out Saturday and next Monday to all of you out there on DVD, the preeminent 9-11 film.
[03:40.600 --> 03:50.600]  Because it shows the activism that is taking over the media that is short-circuiting the New World Order's puppets that is really giving them the shakes.
[03:50.600 --> 03:54.600]  Now, that trailer you just heard, I first saw it Friday night on YouTube.
[03:54.600 --> 04:03.600]  We got it posted by Saturday afternoon and we posted it there making clear that it was a fan video.
[04:03.600 --> 04:06.600]  Obviously, that is not the New World Order.
[04:06.600 --> 04:14.600]  And if you watch the images, it says, you know, you're not the majority and we show a poll where 80-something percent believe 9-11 is an inside job.
[04:14.600 --> 04:19.600]  I mean, really, sometimes I don't think of myself as that smart.
[04:19.600 --> 04:22.600]  And I don't think of most of us in this movement as that smart.
[04:22.600 --> 04:30.600]  But really, sometimes we have to realize that we're just average and that a lot of people are just totally dumb.
[04:30.600 --> 04:40.600]  Because the video has gone completely viral and people think it's real or they think we made it and they think there's no end to it.
[04:40.600 --> 04:45.600]  There is not a thimble, a thimble's worth of discernment out there sometimes.
[04:45.600 --> 04:47.600]  And it's just amazing.
[04:47.600 --> 04:52.600]  All right, huge news, massive gas, totally jam packed, stay with us.
[04:52.600 --> 05:00.600]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[05:00.600 --> 05:02.600]  But the symptoms are there.
[05:02.600 --> 05:10.600]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[05:10.600 --> 05:16.600]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[05:16.600 --> 05:20.600]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[05:20.600 --> 05:25.600]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[05:25.600 --> 05:27.600]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[05:27.600 --> 05:35.600]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[05:53.600 --> 05:55.600]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[05:55.600 --> 06:00.600]  I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[06:00.600 --> 06:03.600]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[06:03.600 --> 06:10.600]  The American people know that 9-11 was the stage. It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF.
[06:10.600 --> 06:19.600]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[06:19.600 --> 06:25.600]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[06:25.600 --> 06:29.600]  An inside job? How dare you?
[06:29.600 --> 06:35.600]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[06:35.600 --> 06:38.600]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[06:38.600 --> 06:43.600]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[06:43.600 --> 06:49.600]  Truth rising. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[06:49.600 --> 06:52.600]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.

[08:18.600 --> 08:26.600]  Israel is saying that they are going to attack Iran in the next six months.
[08:26.600 --> 08:32.600]  Now, I don't know if that's true. I don't know if that's extreme sabre rattling.
[08:32.600 --> 08:37.600]  I know that for five years the criminals that have hijacked our government, I don't want to say our government,
[08:37.600 --> 08:45.600]  I have had groups inside Iran, Wahhabist sect groups, al-Qaeda groups,
[08:45.600 --> 08:52.600]  attacking the Iranians while telling the lobotomized public that Iran is al-Qaeda.
[08:52.600 --> 09:00.600]  Just incredible hoax as usual in this land of godforsaken mindlessness and willful ignorance.
[09:00.600 --> 09:02.600]  Only here could they get away with that.
[09:02.600 --> 09:07.600]  Now they've publicly announced, they have publicly announced last year in a White House press release,
[09:07.600 --> 09:14.600]  but now, I mean, it's big news that military operations led by U.S. Special Forces,
[09:14.600 --> 09:21.600]  commanding Wahhabist inside Iran, have been carrying out military operations.
[09:21.600 --> 09:27.600]  Bush wants another 400 million to fund the operations which they admit are the bombing of Mosque,
[09:27.600 --> 09:33.600]  the bombing of schools, the shooting up of school buses to make the public go into a rage
[09:33.600 --> 09:36.600]  and demand military action against the U.S.
[09:36.600 --> 09:40.600]  And then the nukes drop, and the people running our government have said,
[09:40.600 --> 09:46.600]  if Iran fights back in any way to these five years of terror attacks, now intensifying,
[09:46.600 --> 09:50.600]  or when they are bombed, over a thousand sites to be bombed,
[09:50.600 --> 09:54.600]  if they fight back in any way, the media will gasp in horror and go,
[09:54.600 --> 10:01.600]  the ultimate evil has been committed, Iran has premeditatedly, without being attacked, attacked.
[10:01.600 --> 10:05.600]  Now they will say that, they will say, Iran has attacked without being attacked,
[10:05.600 --> 10:11.600]  because they know the public are willful slaves who love to be psychologically raped,
[10:11.600 --> 10:15.600]  physically raped, and just appear scum.
[10:15.600 --> 10:19.600]  And so, and you think I'm joking, I told you the Supreme Court would come out
[10:19.600 --> 10:22.600]  and they would say, big victory for gun rights advocates,
[10:22.600 --> 10:27.600]  but we can still ban guns, register guns, not let you have guns,
[10:27.600 --> 10:29.600]  and you saw exactly that.
[10:29.600 --> 10:31.600]  I told you Limbaugh would endorse Hillary.
[10:31.600 --> 10:34.600]  You heard that five years before it happened.
[10:34.600 --> 10:38.600]  And I'm telling you that if they attack Iran, well, they're attacking them right now,
[10:38.600 --> 10:43.600]  but in an aircraft doing it, not just CIA-backed al-Qaeda,
[10:43.600 --> 10:48.600]  then you will hear the media just absolutely say,
[10:48.600 --> 10:52.600]  never before in the history of war has something so vicious been done.
[10:52.600 --> 10:56.600]  Iran, without being attacked as attacked, as you watch their cities
[10:56.600 --> 11:02.600]  and their entire infrastructure being bombed by 1,000, 2,000 pound and larger bombs,
[11:02.600 --> 11:05.600]  you will hear them say, this is not an attack.
[11:05.600 --> 11:09.600]  And you will see the public, a large portion, say it's real.
[11:09.600 --> 11:10.600]  Okay?
[11:10.600 --> 11:13.600]  Because this is the other world now.
[11:13.600 --> 11:14.600]  This is insanity.
[11:14.600 --> 11:17.600]  This is a nation gone completely insane.
[11:17.600 --> 11:19.600]  Under group mind control.
[11:19.600 --> 11:20.600]  I'm not joking.
[11:20.600 --> 11:22.600]  You're going to see it happen, okay?
[11:22.600 --> 11:24.600]  If the attack goes forward.
[11:24.600 --> 11:26.600]  You think I joke with this stuff?
[11:26.600 --> 11:28.600]  I'm not.
[11:28.600 --> 11:31.600]  This is the mass delusion that is happening.
[11:31.600 --> 11:34.600]  That's what it's all about.
[11:34.600 --> 11:36.600]  And so we've got a lot of news on that.
[11:36.600 --> 11:41.600]  Ray McGovern joined us because he was chief White House CIA,
[11:41.600 --> 11:47.600]  a griefer, senior analyst to Reagan and Bush senior,
[11:47.600 --> 11:51.600]  and he also is fighting for his life against lymphoma cancer right now.
[11:51.600 --> 11:55.600]  So Ray's been particularly forthcoming with everything.
[11:55.600 --> 11:59.600]  In the past, he was a bit hourly, but still said quite a bit on the show.
[11:59.600 --> 12:01.600]  Now he's just laying it all out on the table,
[12:01.600 --> 12:05.600]  saying Israel may stage terror attacks to get us to go to war with Iran
[12:05.600 --> 12:07.600]  or our own government may do it.
[12:07.600 --> 12:09.600]  Just point blank telling you the facts.
[12:09.600 --> 12:11.600]  So we need to get Bill Christensen back on.
[12:11.600 --> 12:12.600]  I keep forgetting.
[12:12.600 --> 12:14.600]  Ray, get Bill Christensen.
[12:14.600 --> 12:15.600]  He's in the book calling now.
[12:15.600 --> 12:18.600]  He was section chief in Europe and Germany at one time.
[12:18.600 --> 12:20.600]  That's super senior.
[12:20.600 --> 12:23.600]  He says 100%, 9-11, carried out by the government.
[12:23.600 --> 12:25.600]  They didn't let it happen.
[12:25.600 --> 12:27.600]  They didn't bring him in and let it happen.
[12:27.600 --> 12:29.600]  They were US government agents set up, put on board planes,
[12:29.600 --> 12:31.600]  and then we don't know what happened after that.
[12:31.600 --> 12:35.600]  But it's absolute fact they were US government agents protected
[12:35.600 --> 12:37.600]  and were set up somehow.
[12:37.600 --> 12:38.600]  Done. Stories over.
[12:38.600 --> 12:40.600]  They'll say, well, then what exactly happened?
[12:40.600 --> 12:41.600]  I don't know.
[12:41.600 --> 12:42.600]  They were government agents, though.
[12:42.600 --> 12:46.600]  Done, admitted, fact.
[12:46.600 --> 12:48.600]  So that's just some of what's happening.
[12:48.600 --> 12:55.600]  That's just some of what's going on.
[12:55.600 --> 13:02.600]  By the way, I mean, 99% of the public don't want the North American Union.
[13:02.600 --> 13:08.600]  87% don't want the war, 91% in Gallup Poll, don't want open borders.
[13:08.600 --> 13:13.600]  So, you know, when I say the public, are idiots.
[13:13.600 --> 13:17.600]  I'm talking about maybe 20% of the public who will literally,
[13:17.600 --> 13:23.600]  if the government told them that horse droppings was chocolate pie,
[13:23.600 --> 13:26.600]  they would gobble it and tell you you were a conspiracy theorist
[13:26.600 --> 13:29.600]  if you didn't believe it and they put whipped cream on top of it.
[13:29.600 --> 13:32.600]  I mean, they will buy anything that you understand.
[13:32.600 --> 13:37.600]  It's admitted the hijackers were US government agents in triplicate kernels,
[13:37.600 --> 13:41.600]  the heads of bases, the heads of embassies, witnesses, FBI agents.
[13:41.600 --> 13:42.600]  It's all on record.
[13:42.600 --> 13:44.600]  It is a incontrovertible fact.
[13:44.600 --> 13:46.600]  Done. Case closed.
[13:46.600 --> 13:48.600]  You understand it is a fact.
[13:48.600 --> 13:52.600]  Our criminal government is running al-Qaeda, attacking Iran five years straight.
[13:52.600 --> 13:56.600]  Now, publicly has US special forces murdering Iranians,
[13:56.600 --> 14:00.600]  murdering families, bombing, carrying out attacks, blowing up churches,
[14:00.600 --> 14:03.600]  blowing up mosques, that's what they are.
[14:03.600 --> 14:05.600]  And the Iranians are just sitting there taking it,
[14:05.600 --> 14:08.600]  knowing that Israel and the criminals that run our country
[14:08.600 --> 14:11.600]  have said we will reign nukes on you.
[14:11.600 --> 14:14.600]  And there's a bunch of idiot and their due wells
[14:14.600 --> 14:17.600]  driving around thinking they're redneck good old boys all over the country
[14:17.600 --> 14:22.600]  who all they talk about is glass parking lots and they think Iranians are Arabs.
[14:22.600 --> 14:25.600]  And they have no idea they can't even find Iran on the map.
[14:25.600 --> 14:26.600]  They don't care.
[14:26.600 --> 14:28.600]  They love their dollar being destroyed.
[14:28.600 --> 14:31.600]  They love being shot up with mercury shots and their flu shot.
[14:31.600 --> 14:34.600]  They love giving their kids shots that sterilize them and give them cancer.
[14:34.600 --> 14:37.600]  They love drinking sodium fluoride water.
[14:37.600 --> 14:41.600]  They love having their currency destroyed, their future destroyed,
[14:41.600 --> 14:43.600]  their nation destroyed.
[14:43.600 --> 14:45.600]  They will, I mean, we went out to Crawford folks
[14:45.600 --> 14:49.600]  and we had them run over and violently threaten us in their cowboy hats,
[14:49.600 --> 14:52.600]  but I guarantee you none of them knew how to ride a horse.
[14:52.600 --> 14:54.600]  Probably afraid of them like Bush.
[14:54.600 --> 14:57.600]  And literally get in front of the camera and say,
[14:57.600 --> 14:59.600]  WMDs were found.
[14:59.600 --> 15:02.600]  And then literally start acting like children going,
[15:02.600 --> 15:09.600]  I mean, just mass, middle illness, rotten brain idiots.
[15:09.600 --> 15:11.600]  And you bet I'm mad folks.
[15:11.600 --> 15:12.600]  You bet.
[15:12.600 --> 15:14.600]  And then you got the communist, socialist, well-meaning,
[15:14.600 --> 15:16.600]  bug-eyed, low-level liberals out there
[15:16.600 --> 15:19.600]  who think handing in your guns is good and all this other stuff.
[15:19.600 --> 15:21.600]  Hey, the New World Order wants your guns.
[15:21.600 --> 15:23.600]  The New World Order wants open borders.
[15:23.600 --> 15:25.600]  The New World Order's for it.
[15:25.600 --> 15:28.600]  Anything they're for, I'm against.
[15:28.600 --> 15:30.600]  They're for Planned Parenthood, I'm against it.
[15:30.600 --> 15:33.600]  And you go look at why, you'll find out why.
[15:33.600 --> 15:36.600]  Do you hear one of your La Ricanquista Raza groups
[15:36.600 --> 15:38.600]  funded by the Ford Foundation and the U.S. government
[15:38.600 --> 15:41.600]  screaming kill the gringo on your Spanish radio
[15:41.600 --> 15:43.600]  and the media ignoring it like they don't know?
[15:43.600 --> 15:45.600]  You think you're getting away with something?
[15:45.600 --> 15:48.600]  That's all globalist financed.
[15:48.600 --> 15:51.600]  Meanwhile, they're killing your Raza left and right,
[15:51.600 --> 15:54.600]  one-third of the babies being born in Mexico City
[15:54.600 --> 15:57.600]  have got that syndrome where they don't have a developed brain.
[15:57.600 --> 15:59.600]  There's all the toxic waste from this country
[15:59.600 --> 16:00.600]  that's dumped down there.
[16:00.600 --> 16:01.600]  I want that to stop.
[16:01.600 --> 16:05.600]  I want your Raza to stop dying, you idiots.
[16:05.600 --> 16:07.600]  Because we're all one Raza.
[16:07.600 --> 16:10.600]  Yeah, there's different varieties of the human race,
[16:10.600 --> 16:13.600]  but we're still one race, ladies and gentlemen.
[16:13.600 --> 16:16.600]  And if the New World Order is allowed to chew your guts out,
[16:16.600 --> 16:18.600]  they're going to be able to chew mine.
[16:18.600 --> 16:19.600]  Mine.
[16:19.600 --> 16:22.600]  I don't want my people, my family getting hurt
[16:22.600 --> 16:23.600]  by the New World Order.
[16:23.600 --> 16:25.600]  I understand what comes around, goes around.
[16:25.600 --> 16:28.600]  I understand the basic laws of the universe.
[16:28.600 --> 16:30.600]  Because I got a bunch of news on that now.
[16:30.600 --> 16:33.600]  They are now allowing illegal aliens to have cocaine and heroin
[16:33.600 --> 16:34.600]  and are not busting them.
[16:34.600 --> 16:37.600]  I have mainstream news, ladies and gentlemen.
[16:37.600 --> 16:39.600]  It's not enough that they don't get DWIs.
[16:39.600 --> 16:41.600]  It's not enough they don't have to have driver's license,
[16:41.600 --> 16:42.600]  but citizens do.
[16:42.600 --> 16:44.600]  It's not enough they throw the book at citizens
[16:44.600 --> 16:45.600]  but don't have illegals.
[16:45.600 --> 16:47.600]  Now they can have cocaine and heroin.
[16:47.600 --> 16:52.600]  I mean, this country, there's nothing,
[16:52.600 --> 16:56.600]  no nation has ever gone this far in some areas into tyranny.
[16:56.600 --> 17:02.600]  It just totally blows me away.
[17:02.600 --> 17:04.600]  You know, I said I had all this news.
[17:04.600 --> 17:07.600]  It's all insane.
[17:07.600 --> 17:10.600]  I have probably over 150 articles here in front of me today.
[17:10.600 --> 17:11.600]  I want to cover.
[17:11.600 --> 17:17.600]  Look at this.
[17:17.600 --> 17:21.600]  San Francisco Chronicle, Feds probe SF's migrant offender shield.
[17:21.600 --> 17:25.600]  And it goes on to say youths caught dealing crack cocaine
[17:25.600 --> 17:29.600]  are protected and are released.
[17:29.600 --> 17:34.600]  Because the city says, well,
[17:34.600 --> 17:36.600]  there might be possible federal deportation
[17:36.600 --> 17:38.600]  and that's a violation of his precious rights.
[17:38.600 --> 17:44.600]  So we have to let him go.
[17:44.600 --> 17:47.600]  And they even gave him a flight home with carte blanche
[17:47.600 --> 17:50.600]  by city officials to return.
[17:50.600 --> 17:53.600]  The city's practices recently prompted a federal criminal investigation
[17:53.600 --> 17:55.600]  and whether San Francisco has been systematically
[17:55.600 --> 17:57.600]  circumventing U.S. immigration law.
[17:57.600 --> 17:59.600]  But see, that's just the feds getting mad
[17:59.600 --> 18:03.600]  at one of their more modern cities in their dehumanization
[18:03.600 --> 18:06.600]  at being a few phases, a few upgrades down the line.
[18:06.600 --> 18:09.600]  See, that will upset the natives too much here in the U.S.
[18:09.600 --> 18:15.600]  So they have to have the guest worker program first.
[18:15.600 --> 18:18.600]  I got a bunch of other articles like it.
[18:18.600 --> 18:22.600]  Okay, here's an example of what I'm talking about.
[18:22.600 --> 18:26.600]  I was at KLBJ where I broadcast or syndicate the show
[18:26.600 --> 18:30.600]  on the Sunday, abbreviated two-hour show from four to six central.
[18:30.600 --> 18:32.600]  There's a nice news lady in there.
[18:32.600 --> 18:36.600]  And I heard them doing newscast on how the oil price is up
[18:36.600 --> 18:38.600]  because of speculation.
[18:38.600 --> 18:40.600]  So I walked out during the break and I said,
[18:40.600 --> 18:42.600]  listen, here's Bloomberg and here's AP
[18:42.600 --> 18:45.600]  and here's a couple other things saying it's all
[18:45.600 --> 18:47.600]  because of dollar devaluation.
[18:47.600 --> 18:49.600]  But I said, you never hear this on radio or TV.
[18:49.600 --> 18:50.600]  It never gets on the news.
[18:50.600 --> 18:52.600]  It's on all the news wires.
[18:52.600 --> 18:53.600]  It's a fact.
[18:53.600 --> 18:55.600]  But I hear all the talk shows saying it's a mystery.
[18:55.600 --> 18:57.600]  Do you want this?
[18:57.600 --> 18:59.600]  She said, well, I've got to get it approved by the news director,
[18:59.600 --> 19:00.600]  but maybe he will.
[19:00.600 --> 19:02.600]  And maybe they will, but I mean,
[19:02.600 --> 19:04.600]  it's not like I need to go have them reported.
[19:04.600 --> 19:06.600]  It was just almost like you want to tell somebody the truth.
[19:06.600 --> 19:08.600]  You know, you have that instinct to go,
[19:08.600 --> 19:10.600]  hey, let me tell you something.
[19:10.600 --> 19:13.600]  But you know, I'm the conspiracy theorist,
[19:13.600 --> 19:14.600]  so I can't be listened to.
[19:14.600 --> 19:17.600]  Bloomberg, OPEC leader, Khalid, it says,
[19:17.600 --> 19:20.600]  dollar will drive oil to 170.
[19:20.600 --> 19:22.600]  That's a Bloomberg headline.
[19:25.600 --> 19:27.600]  And that's what.
[19:27.600 --> 19:29.600]  And I know we keep talking about this
[19:29.600 --> 19:31.600]  because it's coming home to loosen now,
[19:31.600 --> 19:34.600]  but this is nothing compared to two years from now,
[19:34.600 --> 19:36.600]  a year from now, three years from now.
[19:36.600 --> 19:41.600]  I mean, total, total breakdown of society
[19:41.600 --> 19:42.600]  if this continues.
[19:42.600 --> 19:43.600]  And it is.
[19:43.600 --> 19:44.600]  It's continuing.
[19:44.600 --> 19:45.600]  And they're just hiring more cops
[19:45.600 --> 19:48.600]  and training them to be thugs.
[19:48.600 --> 19:51.600]  So we don't get out of line when we become slaves.
[19:54.600 --> 19:55.600]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[19:55.600 --> 19:58.600]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers,
[19:58.600 --> 20:02.600]  investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[20:02.600 --> 20:03.600]  That's right.
[20:03.600 --> 20:06.600]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[20:06.600 --> 20:10.600]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize
[20:10.600 --> 20:13.600]  the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[20:13.600 --> 20:15.600]  The truth be told, gold and silver
[20:15.600 --> 20:17.600]  has outperformed paper investments
[20:17.600 --> 20:19.600]  like stocks, bonds, and CDs,
[20:19.600 --> 20:21.600]  yet no word about IRAs.
[20:21.600 --> 20:23.600]  Perhaps the financial institutions
[20:23.600 --> 20:25.600]  want to maintain control of your assets
[20:25.600 --> 20:26.600]  by keeping you in paper.
[20:26.600 --> 20:29.600]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement,
[20:29.600 --> 20:32.600]  call 800-686-2237.
[20:32.600 --> 20:35.600]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation
[20:35.600 --> 20:37.600]  and low return on your paper investments.
[20:37.600 --> 20:39.600]  Call 800-686-2237.
[20:39.600 --> 20:42.600]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[20:42.600 --> 20:45.600]  Call 800-686-2237.
[20:45.600 --> 20:50.600]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[20:52.600 --> 20:54.600]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[20:54.600 --> 20:56.600]  The forces of globalism are destroying
[20:56.600 --> 20:58.600]  national sovereignty worldwide.
[20:58.600 --> 21:00.600]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[21:00.600 --> 21:02.600]  The first time in modern history,
[21:02.600 --> 21:03.600]  the people are beginning to wake up.
[21:03.600 --> 21:05.600]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[21:05.600 --> 21:07.600]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding
[21:07.600 --> 21:09.600]  of the New World Order master plan.
[21:09.600 --> 21:11.600]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken
[21:11.600 --> 21:13.600]  and energize the people to meet this threat.

[22:23.600 --> 22:25.600]  Test conducted by General Motors conclude
[22:25.600 --> 22:27.600]  fuel injectors can partially plug in

[23:52.600 --> 23:55.600]  We're back live. I'm Alex Jones.
[23:55.600 --> 24:23.600]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[24:23.600 --> 24:25.600]  I'm going to start in very interesting times
[24:25.600 --> 24:27.600]  as the Chinese say.
[24:27.600 --> 24:31.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's only going to get more interesting.
[24:31.600 --> 24:35.600]  I have no idea how supermodels can throw themselves
[24:35.600 --> 24:38.600]  out of windows because they're reportedly
[24:38.600 --> 24:41.600]  bored with life.
[24:41.600 --> 24:43.600]  I mean, you walk out at sunset
[24:43.600 --> 24:46.600]  and you see the mantle of the heavens,
[24:46.600 --> 24:50.600]  the atmosphere out into a galactic deep space.
[24:50.600 --> 24:54.600]  You see the stars and planets winking into view
[24:54.600 --> 24:58.600]  as nightfall comes into play.
[24:58.600 --> 25:01.600]  You look down below and you see a baby lizard
[25:01.600 --> 25:05.600]  grabbing a tiny bug and scurrying under a rock.
[25:05.600 --> 25:08.600]  Then I watch night hawks come out and feed on the insects,
[25:08.600 --> 25:11.600]  swirling around in columns up into the sky,
[25:11.600 --> 25:14.600]  bats, frolic, owls.
[25:14.600 --> 25:17.600]  It's just so amazing, life all around you,
[25:17.600 --> 25:20.600]  beauty all around you, majesty all around you.
[25:20.600 --> 25:22.600]  The public doesn't care.
[25:22.600 --> 25:24.600]  They're all obsessed and worshipful
[25:24.600 --> 25:27.600]  of their pointless sports heroes.
[25:27.600 --> 25:30.600]  I was watching a video somebody sent me
[25:30.600 --> 25:33.600]  in one of my previous stalkers on YouTube
[25:33.600 --> 25:35.600]  and the guy was just freaking out and crying
[25:35.600 --> 25:38.600]  and worshiping over some baseball pitcher.
[25:38.600 --> 25:43.600]  You could see it, the mass mental illness.
[25:43.600 --> 25:46.600]  It's just so important some pitcher.
[25:46.600 --> 25:50.600]  But not what's happening in the world
[25:50.600 --> 25:53.600]  or to the very currency.
[25:53.600 --> 25:55.600]  That very individual's howled and laughed at me
[25:55.600 --> 25:57.600]  about dollar devaluation, thinking it's funny,
[25:57.600 --> 25:59.600]  saying it isn't happening.
[25:59.600 --> 26:01.600]  It's just snickering and laughing just a few months ago
[26:01.600 --> 26:04.600]  and now look at it in a few months.
[26:04.600 --> 26:08.600]  We're diving down, we're crashing now.
[26:08.600 --> 26:11.600]  But it's too fun to snicker and giggle
[26:11.600 --> 26:14.600]  and make little jokes about it.
[26:14.600 --> 26:16.600]  And I really, even if the person's mindless
[26:16.600 --> 26:18.600]  and mentally ill, I want to help them.
[26:18.600 --> 26:20.600]  I really have brotherly love.
[26:20.600 --> 26:22.600]  I care about people.
[26:22.600 --> 26:23.600]  I don't want this to happen.
[26:23.600 --> 26:25.600]  I don't want these criminal banks to carry this out
[26:25.600 --> 26:27.600]  against us, this criminal consolidation.
[26:27.600 --> 26:30.600]  I'm sad it's happening.
[26:30.600 --> 26:32.600]  I'm sad for those that wrongly attack me
[26:32.600 --> 26:34.600]  and make stuff up about me.
[26:34.600 --> 26:36.600]  I'm not upset that you're attacking me.
[26:36.600 --> 26:39.600]  I'm upset that you are walled off from reality
[26:39.600 --> 26:41.600]  and don't know a good man when you see one
[26:41.600 --> 26:44.600]  and don't know good fruits when you see him
[26:44.600 --> 26:46.600]  and that you fritter away all the time
[26:46.600 --> 26:48.600]  attacking me and a few others
[26:48.600 --> 26:50.600]  instead of attacking the New World Order
[26:50.600 --> 26:54.600]  or warning people about the basics of what's happening.
[26:54.600 --> 26:56.600]  It's just so frustrating.
[26:56.600 --> 26:58.600]  So many things I want to say.
[26:58.600 --> 26:59.600]  So many things I want to do.
[26:59.600 --> 27:01.600]  Let's just get into the news now.
[27:01.600 --> 27:02.600]  Ray McEverden joining us for an hour
[27:02.600 --> 27:04.600]  in about 35 minutes from now
[27:04.600 --> 27:06.600]  and then we're going to have some 9-11 truthers on
[27:06.600 --> 27:08.600]  in the fourth hour, we will all week long
[27:08.600 --> 27:10.600]  as we build up towards truth rising
[27:10.600 --> 27:12.600]  coming out on
[27:12.600 --> 27:16.600]  Friday, July 4th, 2008
[27:16.600 --> 27:19.600]  OPEC leader Khalil says
[27:19.600 --> 27:22.600]  dollar will drive oil to 170.
[27:22.600 --> 27:25.600]  OPEC president predicted the price of oil
[27:25.600 --> 27:27.600]  would climb to 170 a barrel before the end of the year
[27:27.600 --> 27:29.600]  citing the dollars to climb.
[27:29.600 --> 27:31.600]  That's it.
[27:31.600 --> 27:33.600]  Oil prices are expected to reach 170.
[27:33.600 --> 27:35.600]  Is demand for fuel is growing?
[27:35.600 --> 27:36.600]  They don't just say that.
[27:36.600 --> 27:38.600]  I mean, but they say they do.
[27:38.600 --> 27:40.600]  Get ready, 170 folks.
[27:40.600 --> 27:43.600]  We told you a few years ago it's going to go to 200.
[27:43.600 --> 27:45.600]  I'm sorry, Bilderberg runs things and they said
[27:45.600 --> 27:48.600]  and we went through the threats and the detaining
[27:48.600 --> 27:51.600]  and Jim getting shot at before
[27:51.600 --> 27:53.600]  and we go through all this for you to bring you
[27:53.600 --> 27:57.600]  and pearls before swine.
[27:57.600 --> 28:00.600]  Just laugh and giggle and call it a conspiracy theory.
[28:00.600 --> 28:02.600]  Who else can tell you what the oil price
[28:02.600 --> 28:04.600]  is going to be years before?
[28:04.600 --> 28:06.600]  We can because we know who runs things.
[28:06.600 --> 28:09.600]  We're not blind.
[28:09.600 --> 28:11.600]  And I'll say it again.
[28:11.600 --> 28:14.600]  The marvel of this is we're just average people.
[28:14.600 --> 28:20.600]  We just are tuned into reality and have a thimble of discernment.
[28:20.600 --> 28:23.600]  The people have bought into so many lies over the years
[28:23.600 --> 28:26.600]  that they don't know which end is up anymore.
[28:26.600 --> 28:30.600]  I mean, I talked to well-to-do people at church,
[28:30.600 --> 28:33.600]  at the bank, at parties I've been invited to,
[28:33.600 --> 28:38.600]  deep-sea fishing at the gym and you talk to them
[28:38.600 --> 28:40.600]  and they'll start talking about business
[28:40.600 --> 28:43.600]  and they're living in a million-dollar house.
[28:43.600 --> 28:47.600]  They're making $500,000 a year
[28:47.600 --> 28:50.600]  and folks, they don't know the dollar's been devalued
[28:50.600 --> 28:54.600]  because they watch that monkey, Jim Kramer.
[28:54.600 --> 28:56.600]  It's just incredible.
[28:56.600 --> 29:01.600]  I mean, Ron Paul talked about it 30 years ago.
[29:01.600 --> 29:05.600]  I talked about it 13 years ago.
[29:05.600 --> 29:07.600]  But it isn't about who talked about it first.
[29:07.600 --> 29:12.600]  It's about now it is incredibly apparent.
[29:12.600 --> 29:14.600]  I mean, people were freaking out 30 years ago
[29:14.600 --> 29:15.600]  when the dollar was losing value,
[29:15.600 --> 29:18.600]  but then it was a slow slide.
[29:18.600 --> 29:21.600]  But still, it meant the country would be bankrupt in 30 years.
[29:21.600 --> 29:22.600]  Well, guess what?
[29:22.600 --> 29:24.600]  28 years has passed, baby.
[29:24.600 --> 29:25.600]  It's now time.
[29:25.600 --> 29:29.600]  The country is being led to the gallows.
[29:29.600 --> 29:31.600]  You're now standing before a rope.
[29:31.600 --> 29:33.600]  I'm telling you to resist it
[29:33.600 --> 29:35.600]  and you're telling me it isn't a rope,
[29:35.600 --> 29:37.600]  snickering at me.
[29:37.600 --> 29:42.600]  You need to be slapped upside your head.
[29:42.600 --> 29:44.600]  We're on the march.
[29:44.600 --> 29:46.600]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:46.600 --> 29:50.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:54.600 --> 29:56.600]  Hi, neighbor.
[29:56.600 --> 29:58.600]  We all know that knowledge is power.
[29:58.600 --> 30:00.600]  We've tried to give you knowledge
[30:00.600 --> 30:02.600]  to help you prepare for rough times.
[30:02.600 --> 30:04.600]  There's the worldwide famine
[30:04.600 --> 30:07.600]  and our country's dependence on often dangerous food imports.
[30:07.600 --> 30:10.600]  You know about genetically poisoned food.
[30:10.600 --> 30:12.600]  Two-thirds of the food is disappearing with the bees,
[30:12.600 --> 30:14.600]  along with huge crop failures
[30:14.600 --> 30:16.600]  from all-time record water shortages.
[30:16.600 --> 30:18.600]  You know they're turning food into fuel
[30:18.600 --> 30:21.600]  with corn ethanol plants.
[30:21.600 --> 30:23.600]  If we do not control our food,
[30:23.600 --> 30:25.600]  food will be used to control us.
[30:25.600 --> 30:27.600]  Food control has been the plan historically
[30:27.600 --> 30:29.600]  in every enslaved population
[30:29.600 --> 30:31.600]  and is the plan for America.
[30:31.600 --> 30:33.600]  The only value of the knowledge you have
[30:33.600 --> 30:35.600]  to take control of your food
[30:35.600 --> 30:37.600]  is if you choose to get a supply
[30:37.600 --> 30:40.600]  while you still have the freedom to choose.

[30:46.600 --> 30:49.600]  Call 800-409-5633.

[31:53.600 --> 31:55.600]  It is a big idea.
[31:55.600 --> 31:57.600]  A new world order.
[31:57.600 --> 31:59.600]  In the near future,
[31:59.600 --> 32:02.600]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[32:02.600 --> 32:05.600]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[32:05.600 --> 32:08.600]  Could their objective be world domination?
[32:08.600 --> 32:11.600]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[32:11.600 --> 32:14.600]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[32:14.600 --> 32:19.600]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[32:22.600 --> 32:24.600]  For the first time in history,
[32:24.600 --> 32:27.600]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[32:27.600 --> 32:29.600]  You will learn the secret
[32:29.600 --> 32:31.600]  that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[32:31.600 --> 32:34.600]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[32:34.600 --> 32:36.600]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[32:36.600 --> 32:38.600]  They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[32:47.600 --> 32:50.600]  In-game, blueprint for global enslaved.
[32:50.600 --> 33:12.600]  You have been warned.
[33:12.600 --> 33:20.600]  It's so easy to blow up your problems. It's so easy to play up your breakdown.
[33:20.600 --> 33:28.600]  It's so easy to fly through a window. It's so easy to play with the sun.
[33:28.600 --> 33:34.600]  I need all of you because if we are able to get the word out,
[33:34.600 --> 33:44.600]  now on talk radio, on the television shows you can call in locally and nationally,
[33:44.600 --> 33:46.600]  in letters to the editor,
[33:46.600 --> 33:53.600]  that it is the private Federal Reserve's deliberate action to devalue the dollar
[33:53.600 --> 34:01.600]  and that that's the main reason that we have massive inflation in every commodity
[34:01.600 --> 34:10.600]  including energy, oil, natural gas.
[34:10.600 --> 34:14.600]  They keep saying it's the oil companies. They keep saying it's the Arabs doing this to be mean.
[34:14.600 --> 34:18.600]  Why is natural gas up from $7, what, four or five months ago,
[34:18.600 --> 34:23.600]  three months ago to now $13, $14 per thousand cubic feet
[34:23.600 --> 34:26.600]  or however they measure it, some British measurement?
[34:26.600 --> 34:34.600]  How is all this happening? The dollar has been devalued and I know you the listeners know that.
[34:34.600 --> 34:36.600]  I know many of you knew that before I knew that.
[34:36.600 --> 34:41.600]  The point is you need to call into the news stations and they won't listen to you a common slave.
[34:41.600 --> 34:44.600]  They've been trained to be arrogant on power trips.
[34:44.600 --> 34:49.600]  Email them, fax them all these headlines. Just type the dollar, dollar and oil into Google.
[34:49.600 --> 34:53.600]  Click news. There are scores of stories every day, but it's never...
[34:53.600 --> 34:59.600]  So you left thousands of stories in AP, four or five hundred in Bloomberg, a couple hundred in UPI,
[34:59.600 --> 35:01.600]  a thousand or so or more in Reuters.
[35:01.600 --> 35:04.600]  On all these subjects and a lot of them are good and important news,
[35:04.600 --> 35:09.600]  but the gatekeepers, they sit over that and make sure that only three or four are getting your paper.
[35:09.600 --> 35:12.600]  And you notice it'll always be the same in every major paper.
[35:12.600 --> 35:18.600]  It'll always be the diversion or the distraction or somebody jumping over a fence to get their hat
[35:18.600 --> 35:20.600]  and a roller coaster cuts their hat off.
[35:20.600 --> 35:24.600]  Sure, sounds interesting, but doesn't matter in the big scheme of things.
[35:24.600 --> 35:26.600]  Okay?
[35:26.600 --> 35:31.600]  Or a crocodile, an alligator in Florida, rips some guy's arm off.
[35:31.600 --> 35:36.600]  Very interesting for, you know, just for mindlessness value.
[35:36.600 --> 35:39.600]  I have to admit I'm interested in that. I wanted to, when I heard on the radio,
[35:39.600 --> 35:42.600]  I certainly, you know, dipped my ear to it, tipped my ear to it,
[35:42.600 --> 35:45.600]  but at the same time I'd be more interested in hearing.
[35:45.600 --> 35:49.600]  And it's a kind of chicken or the egg thing. It's a feedback loop.
[35:49.600 --> 35:52.600]  If they were to push more important news and information,
[35:52.600 --> 35:54.600]  people'd be more into important news.
[35:54.600 --> 35:57.600]  The point is, is that they have these radio shows everywhere.
[35:57.600 --> 36:00.600]  I mean, I've probably heard in the last couple of years, 200, 300.
[36:00.600 --> 36:04.600]  I mean, it's in the hundreds of national and local shows, TV shows going,
[36:04.600 --> 36:06.600]  why is oil up?
[36:06.600 --> 36:09.600]  Gee, Jiminy Cricket, I don't know.
[36:09.600 --> 36:16.600]  Let's have a panel of six experts on CNN or Fox or National Public Radio or local Austin Radio.
[36:16.600 --> 36:20.600]  And let's have long discussions about, I'll be in LA, I'll be in New York,
[36:20.600 --> 36:23.600]  I'll be in Chicago, and I'll be in Florida.
[36:23.600 --> 36:25.600]  I'll be in, I'll hear the same discussions.
[36:25.600 --> 36:28.600]  I'll hear it on XM, I'll hear it on Limbaugh.
[36:28.600 --> 36:31.600]  Why is it? Oh, it's such a mystery.
[36:31.600 --> 36:33.600]  Let's get Sherlock Holmes in here.
[36:33.600 --> 36:37.600]  And I'm like, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar.
[36:37.600 --> 36:42.600]  And folks, it affects everything.
[36:42.600 --> 36:47.600]  Food, transportation, clothing, schooling, everything's going to go up.
[36:47.600 --> 36:49.600]  And see, here's the deal.
[36:49.600 --> 36:58.600]  Inflation always hits the country that has devalued its currency if it's a devaluation inflation.
[36:58.600 --> 36:59.600]  And that's what it normally is.
[36:59.600 --> 37:03.600]  It's the most vicious, the most dangerous, the most hyperbolic in the destruction of the economy.
[37:03.600 --> 37:06.600]  The most final two.
[37:06.600 --> 37:09.600]  It's devastates for decades, bare minimum.
[37:09.600 --> 37:11.600]  Most nations never recover.
[37:11.600 --> 37:14.600]  You hear about Africa, you hear about Latin America, how they're big jokes.
[37:14.600 --> 37:17.600]  Everybody's totally poor, how they just can't ever get it together.
[37:17.600 --> 37:19.600]  They debase their currencies.
[37:19.600 --> 37:21.600]  It's now happening here.
[37:21.600 --> 37:27.600]  You know, from the founding of this country, well, that's actually not right.
[37:27.600 --> 37:38.600]  They had hyperinflation with the fiat currency to run the war from 1776 until the 17, the mid 1780s.
[37:38.600 --> 37:43.600]  And then, from that point on, it was gold and silver backed.
[37:43.600 --> 37:51.600]  And the currency actually, until the 1890s, gained a percent in value.
[37:51.600 --> 37:55.600]  And we had, on average, 11% growth rates in this country.
[37:55.600 --> 37:58.600]  They call 3.4 raging now.
[37:58.600 --> 38:02.600]  Okay, so would you rather have 11% growth rates and your money stay the same,
[38:02.600 --> 38:07.600]  or would you rather have 3% with real 10%, 15% inflation so you're losing?
[38:07.600 --> 38:15.600]  And then the bankers took over, started manipulating things in the 1890s,
[38:15.600 --> 38:19.600]  and the dollar lost about 10% of its value by 1913.
[38:19.600 --> 38:28.600]  And then from then on, up until now, it has lost 80, close to 80% of its value.
[38:28.600 --> 38:30.600]  Well, do the math.
[38:30.600 --> 38:33.600]  If it had lost about 10% of its value by 1913,
[38:33.600 --> 38:42.600]  and then it's worth about one cent, a little under one cent what it was, pre-federal reserve,
[38:42.600 --> 38:50.600]  you can just do the math and figure it out for yourself that it has not gone very well for us.
[38:50.600 --> 38:52.600]  That's prosperity, though.
[38:52.600 --> 38:57.600]  But see, we had four cents of value in 2000.
[38:57.600 --> 39:04.600]  The dollar had kept four cents of its value, and so that was your benchmark value of a dollar.
[39:04.600 --> 39:12.600]  And now, they ran it down to three cents value and two cents value, and now, globally, it's at one cent value.
[39:12.600 --> 39:17.600]  But the full ramifications of that devaluation have not come home to roof,
[39:17.600 --> 39:24.600]  so we're still at about three cents per dollar, 1913 level value.
[39:24.600 --> 39:29.600]  And we've lost, you know, one of those cents from four to three, and people are freaking out and feeling that.
[39:29.600 --> 39:35.600]  Now, here in the next few years, it is a mathematical certainty unless they're, unless of a miracle,
[39:35.600 --> 39:41.600]  or unless Ron Paul was able to put in his policies, or some of the other groups that are out there that have good plans.
[39:41.600 --> 39:45.600]  This has happened in a lot of other countries. It's why we know it works.
[39:45.600 --> 39:49.600]  But a few more, maybe six months more of this, there's no pulling out.
[39:49.600 --> 39:52.600]  And it's probably too late now.
[39:52.600 --> 39:57.600]  It's just the difference of war in the streets, total breakdown in society,
[39:57.600 --> 40:02.600]  because there was breakdown in 1929 through 1939.
[40:02.600 --> 40:06.600]  But people were more moral and more agrarian and more self-sufficient.
[40:06.600 --> 40:13.600]  Now, it's going to be just, if I was a selfish person, I would have left the country.
[40:13.600 --> 40:21.600]  If I was a selfish person, if I only cared about Alex Jones and Alex Jones' family, I would have been out of here a year ago.
[40:21.600 --> 40:30.600]  I would be living humbly in some place like Costa Rica, or somewhere in southern Mexico,
[40:30.600 --> 40:42.600]  being very, very humble, and having a front of running some tourist shop or something, and keeping a very low profile.
[40:42.600 --> 40:50.600]  I mean, never really talking to people, acting stupid, wearing a baseball cap, picking my nose, okay?
[40:50.600 --> 40:56.600]  But I am not doing that. I am going down with this thing, because I love this country and this republic.
[40:56.600 --> 40:59.600]  But I want you to know, folks, that we're not trying to scare you here.
[40:59.600 --> 41:09.600]  We're trying to warn you about what's happening. You better hold on to your seat.
[41:09.600 --> 41:17.600]  Because we have a nation of people bred and trained on lies, and they're finally waking up that something's wrong, but they can't even imagine.
[41:17.600 --> 41:24.600]  It's kind of like your husband's acting suspicious, and you think he's hidden a present for you in the basement,
[41:24.600 --> 41:30.600]  and then you go down and pull up the floorboards, and there's five dead kids in there.
[41:30.600 --> 41:39.600]  And then you're screaming and yelling and vomiting and freaking out and having a total psychological breakdown.
[41:39.600 --> 41:47.600]  You see, you thought it was something he was hiding from you. You thought it was dead bodies.
[41:47.600 --> 41:55.600]  See, the public's woken up to that level. They think, and they act like children, maybe it's a little worse.
[41:55.600 --> 42:02.600]  Maybe it's a wife who thinks the husband's cheating on her, and that something's hidden in the wall behind the closet.
[42:02.600 --> 42:12.600]  She's found out he's built a little thing back there, and you open it up, and there's an acid tank with 14 bodies have been stuck in,
[42:12.600 --> 42:15.600]  and she opens it up, and one's in there half-eaten from a week before.
[42:15.600 --> 42:20.600]  And she's panicked. The room's spinning. She's stumbling around through the halls.
[42:20.600 --> 42:26.600]  She's out front. Can't breathe. The horror, the revulsion, the everything.
[42:26.600 --> 42:39.600]  That's going to be you. That's going to be all of us. Don't you understand? Don't you understand? That's the horror of this.
[42:39.600 --> 42:45.600]  And they premeditatedly, this criminal group has set up this police state to make you the terrorist.
[42:45.600 --> 42:53.600]  If you fight back going to forced labor camps that they admittedly are building for us, look, I'm not going to any forced labor camp.
[42:53.600 --> 42:57.600]  And I'm self-sufficient. Just stay away, police.
[42:57.600 --> 43:03.600]  Okay, you love the government. You love the dollar dyin'. You love taser and people. You love open borders.
[43:03.600 --> 43:07.600]  You love all this selective enforcement. Fine.
[43:07.600 --> 43:13.600]  But what are you going to do, cops, when you hear your cousins are getting drug off to forced labor camps in another state?
[43:13.600 --> 43:16.600]  I want to tell a brief story here.
[43:16.600 --> 43:27.600]  I saw videos over the weekend. I finally had time to slow down and watch some of the videos and photos out of Ohio and other states where they would run checkpoints in block areas that weren't even completely flooded.
[43:27.600 --> 43:36.600]  And if you tried to drive around them, they would run up and jump in front of your car and then pull a gun out on you and then charge you for bumping them when they jump in front of your car.
[43:36.600 --> 43:45.600]  I had a state trooper jump in front of Aaron's Mustang about, I don't know, eight months ago, we were getting some final shots for in-game.
[43:45.600 --> 43:50.600]  I wanted to have one driving by the governor's mansion at night to cut in with me bullhorning it. You see that shot in the film.
[43:50.600 --> 44:01.600]  And a state trooper literally jumps out onto whatever that street is that runs perpendicular to 11th in front of the governor's mansion.
[44:01.600 --> 44:09.600]  He jumps out. We're going about 20 miles an hour. We slam on the brakes. He jumps out 15 feet in front of us. We almost hit him.
[44:09.600 --> 44:15.600]  Folks, they would have gunned us down or sent us to prison if that idiot would have been hit by our car.
[44:15.600 --> 44:26.600]  You're an idiot jumping in front of the car. Anyways, to see why we were driving around in a convertible with a camera.
[44:26.600 --> 44:30.600]  And yes, endangering your life and my freedom is idiotic.
[44:30.600 --> 44:37.600]  Anyways, I said, yeah, we're driving by getting a moving shot.
[44:37.600 --> 44:43.600]  Now, you've got all that going on.
[44:43.600 --> 44:49.600]  But listen, don't feel bad people in Ohio getting charged with felonies for trying to drive to your house.
[44:49.600 --> 44:56.600]  Ian, you've got to give these cops credit. The head of the parish, and we've played the clipper many times.
[44:56.600 --> 45:09.600]  It was named Richard. His mother for five days was trapped in a nursing home with a foot of water in her bed with bugs on her.
[45:09.600 --> 45:13.600]  She had no water, had no food. She had a cell phone that was still working.
[45:13.600 --> 45:21.600]  The hospital staff called the police and police helicopter in get him now. His mother called the head of the police and said,
[45:21.600 --> 45:27.600]  save me son and beg for five days. And because the feds ordered him not to save his mother, he let her die.
[45:27.600 --> 45:32.600]  So they're not even really evil folks. They're just mind controlled.
[45:32.600 --> 45:36.600]  My mother is begging for her life.
[45:36.600 --> 45:41.600]  I might wait six, seven hours and trying to get the cops to go in or somebody to go in and get the people out.
[45:41.600 --> 45:47.600]  But I'm not waiting a day. And you know what? After the day I'm going in and you try to stop me.
[45:47.600 --> 45:53.600]  People are going to, well, you know what's going to happen.
[45:53.600 --> 46:00.600]  They have engineered the cops to wear their own mamas.
[46:00.600 --> 46:05.600]  The guy broke down on TV and said, my mama called and I said, we're coming. We're coming, mama.
[46:05.600 --> 46:08.600]  We're coming. We're not going to give them the go ahead to come in yet, mama.
[46:08.600 --> 46:12.600]  The first day, the second day, the third day, the fourth day and the fifth day, mama died.
[46:12.600 --> 46:17.600]  That's right. Your mama died because you followed those bastards.
[46:17.600 --> 46:23.600]  FEMA who told tens of thousands of firemen and police who showed up to go in and save everybody.
[46:23.600 --> 46:25.600]  No, you got to wait. We're in control.
[46:25.600 --> 46:34.600]  And because you waited four and five days before the Coast Guard wasn't allowed in because FEMA said it was about FEMA saying
[46:34.600 --> 46:40.600]  and FEMA having a laboratory test of what people would do inside that sports dome to make it look bad.
[46:40.600 --> 46:51.600]  So they could then say, oh, we screwed up. We need more power and funding when they already have unlimited funding and power.
[46:51.600 --> 46:56.600]  And I remember reading later that hundreds of police lost family members.
[46:56.600 --> 47:01.600]  I mean, folks, I would swim in in the cover of night.
[47:01.600 --> 47:09.600]  I would walk 20 miles to save my family.
[47:09.600 --> 47:15.600]  That is just basic instinct. It's not in these cops, folks.
[47:15.600 --> 47:26.600]  It's not in these cops. They will follow orders as their mother begs, begs for help and dies, their own mothers.
[47:26.600 --> 47:30.600]  So, of course, when some guy tries to drive around them, it's about authority.
[47:30.600 --> 47:35.600]  It's about mindless authority, the orders they get and the orders they give you.
[47:35.600 --> 47:39.600]  So go ahead, carry out your orders, boys.
[47:39.600 --> 47:48.600]  When this thing goes down like Argentina, that's probably the model you're going to see here.
[47:48.600 --> 47:52.600]  They want a slow slide into third world slavery.
[47:52.600 --> 48:03.600]  And I, frankly, hope that's the case. I hope it doesn't flare up, but as bad as it's probably going to get, it's going to be bedlam.
[48:03.600 --> 48:11.600]  The dollar continues to slide. And the establishment's talking about going ahead and bringing it down to almost nothing.
[48:11.600 --> 48:14.600]  You know, I remember the pay show just a decade or so ago. I don't know.
[48:14.600 --> 48:18.600]  This was 15 years ago. It was 30 to 1 to the dollar.
[48:18.600 --> 48:29.600]  Then it was 21. Then it was 15 to 1. Then it was 10 to 1. Then it was 8 to 1. It's now 5 to 1.
[48:29.600 --> 48:36.600]  And I try to tell yuppies, and they just have that same smart ass, excuse my turn, that's the only one that describes it.
[48:36.600 --> 48:43.600]  It's like a self-delusion and arrogance. And I watch yuppies at the gym. I watch them.
[48:43.600 --> 48:47.600]  They're walking around doing weird faces at each other and strutting.
[48:47.600 --> 48:55.600]  You can tell they're on weird little power trips, like when I was 5 years old and would dress up like a knight and strut around like I was the king or something.
[48:55.600 --> 49:01.600]  I remember being 3, 4, 5 years old and kind of even being embarrassed then realizing I was play acting.
[49:01.600 --> 49:07.600]  The general public is play acting. They're primping and posing and strutting.
[49:07.600 --> 49:12.600]  They're so delusional. You tell them the dollar's plunging and they think you're showing off to them.
[49:12.600 --> 49:21.600]  They think you're acting fancy or smart or uppity. And they just snicker at you.
[49:21.600 --> 49:30.600]  Or that you're pathetic, that you're some wimp trying to be their friend.
[49:30.600 --> 49:36.600]  I've been in stuck-and-travel before and said, you know, they're going to turn this road into a toll road out the window over and over again.
[49:36.600 --> 49:43.600]  I've done this. I've done this when we were driving over to an anti-WTO, anti-NAPA superhighway rally last March.
[49:43.600 --> 49:46.600]  And we were stuck-and-traveling and it was in the back of a pickup truck.
[49:46.600 --> 49:52.600]  And I said to carfully, yuppies, I said they were in an open-top BMW. I said, you know, they're going to put a toll road on this road.
[49:52.600 --> 49:55.600]  It's already paid for, but they're going to put a toll road on it and it's far and owned.
[49:55.600 --> 49:59.600]  And he said, oh, that's good. We need that. We need their investment. Just laugh.
[49:59.600 --> 50:05.600]  You see, to him it's about laughing at something and saying he's part of the system. It's a delusion. You're nothing.
[50:05.600 --> 50:11.600]  You're not part of the system. You're not part of the power. These good old boys have seen glass parking lot, the Arabs.
[50:11.600 --> 50:17.600]  And let's get their oil and strut around and laugh. Some of them will even say, yeah, we probably did 9-11.
[50:17.600 --> 50:22.600]  That's how what we got, you know, the Arabs are a threat. We had to get this wimpy country ready to face them.
[50:22.600 --> 50:31.600]  You got to understand the bigger picture. You're not part of the system either, you little buffoon.
[50:31.600 --> 50:36.600]  See, you got all these nobodies that think there's somebody in the system.
[50:36.600 --> 50:41.600]  And I need you to wake up and get your head screwed on straight to do something about this.
[50:41.600 --> 50:45.600]  When we get back, I'll tell you the latest war news. It's really heating up and it doesn't look good.
[50:45.600 --> 51:14.600]  Valuable information straight ahead. Come up in about 20 minutes. We're going to be taking your calls at 1-800-2599-21.
[51:14.600 --> 51:18.600]  Ever think about this. Wherever there is a design, there is a designer.
[51:18.600 --> 51:25.600]  If an inquisitive child opened the back of an intricately designed Swiss watch and watched the gears,
[51:25.600 --> 51:30.600]  Manchin moved perfectly together and said, where did this come from?
[51:30.600 --> 51:36.600]  And the teacher responded by saying once upon a time there was a big bang explosion in a watch factory.
[51:36.600 --> 51:40.600]  And when the smoke cleared and the dust settled, voila, there was a watch.
[51:40.600 --> 51:46.600]  We call that higher learning or education, but the point is where there is a design, there is a designer.
[51:46.600 --> 51:49.600]  Where there is a creation, there is a creator.
[51:49.600 --> 51:54.600]  The greatest story book tells us the story of creation and that the creator is love.
[51:54.600 --> 51:59.600]  He created out of love and wants love in his creation and wants to be loved.
[51:59.600 --> 52:08.600]  What we are not told in that creation story is why he did not create us so that we could do nothing but love.
[52:08.600 --> 52:12.600]  Think about it. We're not created that way and we could have been.
[52:12.600 --> 52:16.600]  There is a reason, a real good reason, and when you understand it,
[52:16.600 --> 52:21.600]  you'll have knowledge and understanding that very, very few in all creation have.
[52:21.600 --> 52:26.600]  If you are of that select few who want that understanding concerning the creation story,
[52:26.600 --> 52:33.600]  go to anotheruntoldstory.com.
[52:33.600 --> 52:40.600]  For another untold story, go to anotheruntoldstory.com!
[52:40.600 --> 52:51.600]  Anotheruntoldstory.com.
[52:51.600 --> 53:00.600]  May I have everybody's attention please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job!
[53:00.600 --> 53:02.600]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[53:02.600 --> 53:07.240]  the new world order. How do the American people know that not 11 was the state? It was engineered by
[53:07.240 --> 53:15.160]  you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CNPAR. The day that we stop asking questions is
[53:15.160 --> 53:21.000]  the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the
[53:21.000 --> 53:29.240]  attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place. An inside job? How dare you?
[53:29.240 --> 53:35.800]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[53:35.800 --> 53:38.600]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[53:38.600 --> 53:43.640]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary
[53:43.640 --> 53:50.200]  of... Truth rising. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the dvd at infowars.com.
[53:50.200 --> 53:52.760]  It's now time to take the revolution at the next level.
[53:52.760 --> 54:01.320]  Why the unions are big businessmen, and they're going out like dinosaurs.
[54:04.040 --> 54:10.520]  Why the years to grow food in Kansas, they don't want to grow it on the moon if you're raw.
[54:13.000 --> 54:18.520]  I can see the day coming when even your home gardener's gonna be against the law.
[54:18.520 --> 54:25.720]  They're already making home gardens illegal in many parts of the country.
[54:27.080 --> 54:32.520]  Oh, but they didn't tell it to you that way. They know how to pacify you.
[54:35.800 --> 54:38.360]  You gotta get an expensive license and be inspected.
[54:40.520 --> 54:42.520]  Yeah, democracy don't rule the world.
[54:42.520 --> 54:51.800]  You better get that through your head. This world is ruled.
[54:59.480 --> 55:00.920]  That's why they want your guns.
[55:00.920 --> 55:10.200]  So they can carry out violence against you and you have no way of defending yourself.
[55:13.480 --> 55:17.320]  Yeah, Bob Dylan knows about the New World Order. I can't say any more than that. I'll just leave
[55:17.320 --> 55:29.000]  it at that. Bob Dylan knows all about the N-W-O. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, there is a lot to cover
[55:29.000 --> 55:36.360]  here and the truth is rising before I get into all this news. Truth rising is available. You
[55:36.360 --> 55:41.000]  can order it right now. It'll be shipping out the day after July 4th to get your order in now. For
[55:41.000 --> 55:45.960]  all intents and purposes, it's no longer pre-ordering. We've taken that box off that says pre-order.
[55:45.960 --> 55:53.960]  Just order it on DVD and get the extras that are with the film. It is the history of the
[55:53.960 --> 55:58.040]  9-11 first responders, how they're dying, the medical reports, how the government
[55:58.040 --> 56:05.320]  premeditatedly knew, how they blocked their care. That's about 30% of the two-hour film.
[56:05.320 --> 56:10.040]  The rest is the history of the 9-11 truth movement. It's explosive action. We are
[56:10.040 --> 56:15.080]  changed, getting in politicians' faces, taking over their media events. It's really got the system
[56:15.080 --> 56:23.960]  scared. It's also a chronicle of the persecution of 9-11 truth and make no mistake, this film is
[56:23.960 --> 56:31.240]  a political weapon. Truth is a powerful weapon and I suggest you use it immediately. We're going
[56:31.240 --> 56:36.440]  to have it up there on the DivX version, a bunch of other formats starting Thursday night at midnight
[56:36.440 --> 56:40.760]  when it rolls over into Friday. So you can burn it directly to disk and super high quality.
[56:40.760 --> 56:44.760]  And I want you right now to buy hundreds of disks. I want you to be standing by. I want you
[56:44.760 --> 56:50.040]  of your somewhat computer savvy. We're trying to make it as simple as possible to point and click
[56:50.040 --> 56:56.920]  and burn them to disk. I want, by next week, tens of thousands of copies out there. If just a
[56:56.920 --> 57:00.600]  few hundred of you make a few hundred copies, that'll happen. And then tell people, make copies
[57:00.600 --> 57:05.320]  of these. I want you to order the DVD to make the best type of copies from. So we also get
[57:05.320 --> 57:11.720]  some seed money to continue. This is all about getting the information out, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:12.680 --> 57:16.760]  This is about a full commitment. These are terrorists that carried out the attacks.
[57:16.760 --> 57:23.640]  When you hear Kevin Ryan's info, how they've tracked back the explosive thermate to top
[57:23.640 --> 57:28.600]  professors involved with NASA and with a spray on type. And then they look at who did the NIST
[57:28.600 --> 57:35.720]  report and the coverups. And it happens to be of just less than a hundred people globally.
[57:35.720 --> 57:40.200]  That's literally all the people involved at NIST is these top thermate experts.
[57:40.200 --> 57:48.200]  I mean, just the exact, they identify thermate as the, as the accelerant explosive,
[57:49.800 --> 57:56.600]  special nano thermate that NASA people develop. And then that's who's involved in the demolition
[57:56.600 --> 58:03.560]  of the wreckage, the coverup, the NIST. It's all this circle of thermate experts. The only group.
[58:03.560 --> 58:13.080]  Red handed, ladies and gentlemen, unbelievable. I had chills up and down me during the interview.
[58:13.080 --> 58:19.880]  I had chills as I read the reports. I had chills ever since. I mean, it's one thing. We know that
[58:19.880 --> 58:25.000]  big wigs in government who are behind it, but to be zooming in, to be, to be zeroing in on the
[58:25.000 --> 58:38.280]  actual bomb makers. Good God, we'll be right back. Thank you for listening to GCN. Be sure

[1:00:15.400 --> 1:00:20.920]  We have penetrated the new world order's order of invincibility. They are not invincible. They
[1:00:20.920 --> 1:00:27.160]  are not omnipresent. They are not unstoppable. They want to play God. They want to be able to
[1:00:27.160 --> 1:00:32.840]  surveil all of us, manipulate the weather, but they don't have total control. They are not invincible.
[1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:38.360]  They are not omnipresent. They can be defeated. I know in my heart, I know intellectually,
[1:00:38.360 --> 1:00:44.120]  I know historically. That's the first thing we've got to get straight, is that they can and they will
[1:00:44.120 --> 1:00:52.760]  be defeated. You've got to realize these churches on government payroll to pacify you and just tell
[1:00:52.760 --> 1:00:56.600]  you to say praise God all day. Well, everything goes to hell with a handbasket, whether that's
[1:00:56.600 --> 1:01:03.160]  going to happen or not. Duty is ours. Consequence belongs to the Creator. And we got a job to go
[1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:08.680]  out and fight evil. We got a job to put ourselves in the way of innocents who are being attacked by
[1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:14.600]  thugs and criminals. Folks, you've got to ask yourself what your line in the sand is. You better
[1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:20.600]  think about it. My line in the sand would definitely be if I was the police chief of the
[1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:26.760]  parish that New Orleans is in, and my mother was 85 years old in a nursing home with water up to her
[1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:31.160]  bed for five days on a cell phone begging him to come help her, and the fed said he couldn't,
[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:37.400]  so the police chief let his mother die. You talk about a line in the sand. How could you let that
[1:01:37.400 --> 1:01:44.280]  happen? How? And then most cops would do that, folks. Most of them aren't even bad. They're
[1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:49.240]  brainwashed that they've got to follow the government's orders. They've got to do whatever it is,
[1:01:49.240 --> 1:01:58.040]  no matter how criminal. Because some minion of the Saudis, some little horse manager,
[1:01:58.040 --> 1:02:04.680]  toadie of Bush, some monkey wouldn't let him do it. I mean, there were tens of thousands of
[1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:09.400]  good firemen and police that showed up. Back in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, when New Orleans flooded
[1:02:09.400 --> 1:02:13.160]  100 years ago, people from all over the country forget just police showed up and they fixed it
[1:02:13.160 --> 1:02:19.400]  fast. When it was a sniper up on the UT tower, local Austin police went up there with citizens
[1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:26.680]  and killed that guy. Did the cops start shooting at other citizens shooting at the tower? No.
[1:02:26.680 --> 1:02:31.880]  Today, there was some shooter and citizens pulled a gun out and were shooting. I guarantee you the
[1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:37.480]  cops would gun you down in your back. They're brainwashed, folks. They've changed, and police
[1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:44.680]  don't tell me you haven't. And you're a lot less safe now because of it. You'll sit there while your
[1:02:44.680 --> 1:02:52.520]  mama dies. I'll say it again, folks, what's your line in the sand? I am not going to any labor camp.
[1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:58.680]  I'm not going anywhere with the Army and flatback trailers. You just, you come in my house and this
[1:02:58.680 --> 1:03:04.440]  isn't some macho thing. I don't even like talking about it. Bottom line, stay away from me and my
[1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:09.560]  family. You love your new world order. You love all the stuff you're part of. You want to sit there
[1:03:09.560 --> 1:03:14.920]  and let your mama go to one. You go right ahead, but you stay away from me and you listen up.
[1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:19.160]  There's a lot of other people aren't going to go along either and don't roll your eyes at me. It's
[1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:23.400]  all over the news. They've built FEMA camps and forced labor camps and they got all these talking
[1:03:23.400 --> 1:03:30.200]  heads on TV saying, send people to camps. It's time to grow up, ladies and gentlemen, and realize
[1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:36.120]  we're in a world of hurt here. We got some hardcore psychos in control. They're doing some, these are
[1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:41.560]  the people that created Lennon and Mao. These are the people that created Hitler. I can go through
[1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:47.000]  every bit of them, the facts. Lord Milner bragged about it in England. You better find out who Lord
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:53.800]  Milner is. Find out who charted everything we're living. Find out how sissual roads is. Find out
[1:03:53.800 --> 1:03:59.160]  who the Rothschilds are. Find out who the Rockefellers are. Find out what eugenics is. You better
[1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:02.920]  because let me tell you something. Whether you like it or not or whether you laugh at me or not,
[1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:09.640]  your life and your future depends on it. You got me, Jack. You got me, cops. You got me. I'm a good
[1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:15.640]  man. I'm a good person. I'm a good person who keeps his word and who loves God and who loves his
[1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:24.120]  family. I'm a good person and I'm a man too. I'll fight for my family and my country. I know I'm on
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:29.560]  the right side. I know you're on the bad side. Now, when we get back, I'm going to get into news.
[1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:36.600]  It'll curl your hair, but you've got to know about it. InfoWars.com is the coordinates to get

[1:06:43.080 --> 1:06:48.840]  information war. Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight
[1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:54.200]  back to Big Brother. Wake up, Protestant America. There is an ecumenical movement now being planned
[1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:59.400]  to join church and state. This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations
[1:06:59.400 --> 1:07:04.120]  will form one huge political voting bloc. Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and
[1:07:04.120 --> 1:07:08.680]  morality by legislation. Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans
[1:07:08.680 --> 1:07:13.080]  this freedom, liberty of conscience. History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems,
[1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:18.280]  church and state, must be kept separate. It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or
[1:07:18.280 --> 1:07:22.920]  constrains us. This will change the character, not civil enforcement. From history we saw that
[1:07:22.920 --> 1:07:27.800]  when church and state united, known as papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted. This union would
[1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:32.760]  go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation. America and papal Rome are uniting
[1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:38.360]  in this agenda. Protestant America, awake before it is too late. The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[1:07:38.360 --> 1:07:45.320]  Jesus is coming soon. For free materials call 888-211-1715 or write the Bible says,
[1:07:45.320 --> 1:07:49.160]  Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee 37771.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:00.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-offs. You want answers?
[1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:09.560]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[1:08:10.280 --> 1:08:18.920]  Alex Jones. This just in, and it's from Lurockwell.com, so we know it's from right out of the belly of
[1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:24.200]  the system. That is certainly very close to Ron Paul's campaign, so we know this is accurate.
[1:08:24.200 --> 1:08:34.120]  I had heard he was ill. I'm going to get somebody from the now shut down campaign,
[1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:42.680]  shut down for president, that is, now the liberty group on about this from the Ron Paul campaign
[1:08:43.720 --> 1:08:48.760]  in loving memory of Kent Snyder. Kent Snyder, who we interviewed so many times,
[1:08:49.400 --> 1:08:53.000]  why don't we dig up the last time I had Kent on and play a few minutes of that later.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:57.560]  He dead, ladies and gentlemen. Just like all of us are going to be someday. You don't get out of
[1:08:57.560 --> 1:09:05.080]  this alive. Guess what he died of? Acute viral pneumonia. And there's all these deaths in Austin
[1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:10.040]  where I live from it and all these deaths from staff. And in the past, they did screening when
[1:09:10.040 --> 1:09:13.560]  you came into the country. It didn't matter if you were German or Chinese, they don't now.
[1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:18.440]  And that's why people's arms and legs are rotten off and kids are dying and
[1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:24.280]  TB is spreading everywhere and people all over the country are dying at young ages from viral
[1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:31.800]  pneumonia. And it's an epidemic. There's pandemics everywhere, pandemics now of leprosy in the U.S.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  And it'll be in the back of the paper just like rocket attacks, truck bombings, Mexican troops
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:44.760]  kidnapping, killing inside the U.S. It's anything that makes open borders look bad is never national
[1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:49.160]  news. So this doesn't exist. Kind of like dollar devaluation doesn't exist. It's all over the
[1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:53.080]  foreign news, but it's just not to be discussed here. So it doesn't exist.
[1:09:54.840 --> 1:09:58.360]  Rights Ron Paul, the freedom movement has suffered a great loss. Kent Snyder,
[1:09:58.360 --> 1:10:03.320]  chairman of my presidential campaign, lost his tragic battle with pneumonia last week.
[1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:09.960]  Kent was a true lover of liberty. He was an American patriot. He was my friend and he was
[1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:16.600]  and will be missed. We need to maybe get Ron Paul on about this. Kent was a general man who carried
[1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:22.040]  himself with quiet dignity while soft spoken and great inner strength lay behind the keen blue eyes.
[1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:27.000]  He was filled with conviction and principles of decency, loyalty and respect ran to his core.
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:32.520]  Those fortunate enough to work closely with Kent were touched by his integrity and old-fashioned
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:37.880]  American worth ethic. Stories of his youth in Kansas and lessons taught to him by his two greatest
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:42.840]  influences as mother and father were often shared with friends and colleagues. During difficult times,
[1:10:42.840 --> 1:10:50.040]  Kent was always a calm at the center of the storm. I first met Kent in 1987 when he was a young man
[1:10:50.040 --> 1:10:57.080]  in his twenties. See, Kent was young folks on my first presidential run. Over the next 20 years,
[1:10:57.080 --> 1:11:04.440]  we worked together on countless projects in the name of freedom. It was Kent more than anyone
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:11.880]  else who urged me to run again for president last year. I was skeptical, but he was much more confident.
[1:11:14.600 --> 1:11:19.640]  The time was right. Without Kent, I don't know if what would have happened, though he was an
[1:11:19.640 --> 1:11:26.040]  optimist in the end. Even he didn't expect what we achieved. I did. Could have done more.
[1:11:27.080 --> 1:11:32.680]  Like so many in our movement, Kent sacrificed much for the cause of liberty. He sidetracked a
[1:11:32.680 --> 1:11:37.000]  blossoming political career when he chose to work for a third-party candidate. He walked away from
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:40.920]  a lucrative career and telecommunications executive to work for me in Washington when I returned to
[1:11:40.920 --> 1:11:46.040]  Congress in the 90s. Ultimately, he sacrificed his health as we worked tirelessly across the
[1:11:46.680 --> 1:11:51.880]  clock and around the clock on a presidential campaign ignoring the pleas of his doctors to pull
[1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:58.040]  back. Right, Ron Paul was quite sick too many times and people would gripe and complain he wasn't
[1:11:58.040 --> 1:12:03.240]  doing enough or that he didn't have enough fire on TV. It's exhausting shaking thousands of hands,
[1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:07.320]  doing dozens of media appearances a day. I'm a young man and it's exhausting sometimes when
[1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:15.560]  I do similar things. But he's dead. Maybe that's enough for you. Kent poured every ounce of his
[1:12:15.560 --> 1:12:20.760]  being into our fight for freedom. He will always hold a place in my heart and the hearts of my
[1:12:20.760 --> 1:12:29.640]  family. We deeply mourn his loss. And it goes on. I hope we can celebrate Kent's life as
[1:12:29.640 --> 1:12:33.800]  wonderful man he was with tremendous success of his contribution to the cause of liberty
[1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:38.040]  and the bright path he helped blaze to the future of freedom springs alive once again.
[1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:43.640]  Kent should be remembered with every victory we achieve as we move forward together without Kent
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:51.160]  Snyder. The fight for liberty would not be where it is today. We all owe him a great debt. Very hard
[1:12:51.160 --> 1:13:13.800]  working. Oh God, another loss. He died last night. Viral pneumonia. And folks, there's people dying.
[1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:18.600]  I know people in Austin dying of it. You've got to get your kids out of public school and nothing
[1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:24.760]  against the illegal aliens, folks. But the meningitis, the viral pneumonia, all of it,
[1:13:24.760 --> 1:13:31.160]  the flesh eating bacteria. I mean, I got stuff rotting my leg right now that antibiotics can't
[1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:45.000]  even knock out, okay? It's getting bad. There's plagues upon us. And God help us. This government
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:53.400]  is so whacked out. You understand, folks, that they do no testing on anybody coming into this
[1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:59.320]  country. It's called racist to do it, though. Irish and Scottish and British and German and
[1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:05.880]  Dutch and Italian immigrants all had to do it. And the stuff coming out of, I mean, there's now
[1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:11.080]  all sorts of weird burrowing parasites that eat holes in you that are, I mean, it's bad in California,
[1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:16.360]  Texas, Nevada, Arizona. There's all sorts of, I mean, folks, it's scary when you're in Guatemala or
[1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:19.960]  El Salvador or Nicaragua or you want to go down to Mexico City, go down there.
[1:14:21.160 --> 1:14:26.680]  Most dangerous city on earth. Go down and look at it. That's what's coming here. And I feel sorry
[1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:30.760]  for these poor people. They've got more billionaires than anywhere else in the world in Mexico,
[1:14:30.760 --> 1:14:36.440]  triple the resources we've got. But forget that. They've got the worst TB is out of Russia.
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:44.760]  It's drug immune. Kills you. They'll have some grandstanding show about chasing some guy down
[1:14:44.760 --> 1:14:49.000]  that flew on a plane to make you think they're doing something that was a big sigh. That stuff's
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:54.360]  all over the place. That stuff's everywhere. You couldn't pay me a million dollars to work in a jail.
[1:14:55.560 --> 1:15:02.200]  You couldn't pay me a million dollars to work for the INS. You couldn't pay me a million dollars.
[1:15:02.200 --> 1:15:07.960]  But you know what? You go into these restaurants, these people with all this hack on it all day.
[1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:11.240]  Hell, they don't even get these people and try to cure them.
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:18.440]  Let me give you an example. In 2004, 2005, there was zero cases of wet leprosy,
[1:15:18.440 --> 1:15:27.000]  transferable leprosy in the U.S. Guess how many cases were in 2006? 7,000 plus AP. Never see it
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:33.960]  in the news, though. They're building, they got four leper colonies in Texas now. People don't
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:39.400]  believe me. I ought to go videotape one. One's outside Palestine, Texas. I ought to go show you
[1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:45.720]  lepers so you'll even believe it exists because just like dollar devaluations and everything else,
[1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:51.640]  oh, it doesn't exist. That guy makes stuff up. Well, Kent Snyder's dead from viral pneumonia.
[1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:58.840]  People are dying all over the place from it. Some cities have had more than a thousand people die
[1:15:58.840 --> 1:16:06.440]  so far this year from it. Oh, but you give up your whole way of life and hide under your couch and
[1:16:06.440 --> 1:16:12.200]  let them run checkpoints and take your blood at checkpoints because al-Qaeda might get you.
[1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:19.320]  Somebody in a big, bad, scary beard might come up out under the bed and bite you at night.
[1:16:19.320 --> 1:16:26.280]  Meanwhile, real al-Qaeda is under globalist command, U.S. control, attacking Iran publicly,
[1:16:26.280 --> 1:16:30.920]  and Iran is suing the U.S. saying, please stop bombing our schools and churches.
[1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:38.760]  And you bring this up to a neocon, they'll just giggle and go,
[1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:42.760]  so what? We all kill all of them. I'm like, but it's Wahhabi. It's al-Qaeda. They used
[1:16:42.760 --> 1:16:45.960]  them against the Serbs. They used them against... Don't you understand? It's all staged.
[1:16:45.960 --> 1:16:52.680]  Shut up, Communists. You need to be killed. I didn't triple the size of the government.
[1:16:52.680 --> 1:17:01.480]  Shut up. Moron can snider his death later. Let me get into this now before I get into the...
[1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:09.800]  Now they want to start World War III news. That's right here in my stack.
[1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:17.480]  I wanted to... I was clicking on the truth rising trailer too, but the version we are
[1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:24.440]  changed put up. It's got like 4,000 views. And I was looking at the comments, and I'd like to link
[1:17:24.440 --> 1:17:27.720]  through and see who makes these comments. And there's always Marines, and you'll go to their
[1:17:27.720 --> 1:17:31.160]  site. They're Marines, and they're saying, we're going to kill you. You bet there's camps,
[1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:35.560]  you bastards. We're trained. We're going to kill you. Or it could be army less often,
[1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:42.600]  but a lot of times it's Israelis. And in the truth rising trailer too,
[1:17:43.480 --> 1:17:47.640]  you hear Dan Wallace, whose father was a firefighter who went into the building,
[1:17:47.640 --> 1:17:49.400]  one of the towers that collapsed and killed him.
[1:17:51.720 --> 1:17:56.600]  And Dan was very depressed about it. He said he would never show up, that he would never shut
[1:17:56.600 --> 1:18:00.120]  up, that he would never be quiet, that he would all, you know, he'd be back at the 10th anniversary
[1:18:00.120 --> 1:18:18.600]  of need big. Well, he died. Died in his sleep. And he was very depressed. And the neocon on
[1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:24.440]  here says, I'm glad he's dead. Maggots are all over him. Look, he failed. Dan Wallace is dead.
[1:18:24.440 --> 1:18:28.680]  He's saying his voice will always be heard, but it isn't going to be heard. Hey fool,
[1:18:28.680 --> 1:18:32.600]  his voice is going to be seen by millions in truth rising. His face is going to be seen.
[1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:37.400]  His father's sacrifice is going to be seen. And of course, he's going to live on. Don't you
[1:18:37.400 --> 1:18:44.040]  understand? That's what this is all about. You strike me down. It just goes on. You just make it
[1:18:44.040 --> 1:18:50.440]  bigger. Any of us, we're committed to liberty and the defense of the Republican humanity
[1:18:50.440 --> 1:18:56.440]  against its greatest threat. People like you, he goes on another comment to say he wants to kill
[1:18:56.440 --> 1:19:02.360]  us and he will pay $100,000 for each of us that has murdered. Now, Adam, you need to file complaints
[1:19:02.360 --> 1:19:09.320]  with YouTube. You need, he lives in New York. He says he's an Israeli former IDF. The guy's for
[1:19:09.320 --> 1:19:27.720]  real. He needs to be arrested. See, the precedents.
[1:19:41.720 --> 1:19:47.160]  We'll come back and tell you about the enemy and what we face on the other side. Stay with
[1:19:50.280 --> 1:19:54.600]  our beloved republics on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national
[1:19:54.600 --> 1:19:59.960]  sovereigns in World War I. On Liberty's darkest hour in Arizona, the first time in modern history,

[1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:06.920]  was 200 million. The vast majority of the population of the U.S., over people of the U.S.,

[1:24:36.800 --> 1:24:42.800]  The place where he was born and raised
[1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:05.800]  Four, six long years I've been in trouble
[1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:12.800]  No pleasure here on earth I find
[1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:19.800]  Four in this world I'm bound to tremble
[1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:25.800]  I had no friends to help me and I
[1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:35.800]  He has no friends
[1:26:01.800 --> 1:26:05.800]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:08.800]  What's going on at the Bilderberg meeting and what do you guys talk about up there?
[1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:20.800]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the season just to grow at our own door into a great tree that blinds our strongholds
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:31.800]  We are here in Times Square many people from other countries are here with us know a lot about what's happening
[1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:38.800]  The American public is still learning about the atrocity of that day
[1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:46.800]  I just wanted to say this guy outside told me stop talking about five years ago and I told him I will never stop talking about five years ago
[1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:52.800]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of that
[1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:15.800]  Okay now on the version of the trailer that we are changed post that has 5,000 views our versions got about 20,000 views
[1:27:15.800 --> 1:27:33.800]  You will go into the comments from Sunday and there is a guy with the handle Aerial Silverstein
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:41.800]  And it says laugh out loud at Dan Wallace I told him I would never stop talking about five years ago 9-11
[1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:46.800]  Dan you are not talking now are you?
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:51.800]  So you were wrong laugh out loud laugh out loud hahaha
[1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:59.800]  He actually pond himself here by saying he wouldn't stop doing something when he clearly has still
[1:27:59.800 --> 1:28:07.800]  I guess having already been eaten by maggots going back on a statement he made and once again showing how two firsts are always wrong
[1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:15.800]  The first stick to one thing is the least of his worries laugh out loud hahaha
[1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:21.800]  Under that he said Aerial Silverstein one star video
[1:28:21.800 --> 1:28:32.800]  The only useful thing about this video is that it's a convenient resource to identify all the moronic truthers schizoid's who need bullets planted firmly in their heads
[1:28:32.800 --> 1:28:39.800]  They will pay $100,000 per truther so get hunting
[1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:49.800]  Now they may not have gone yet after the criminal Michael Reagan who contracted for murder and said I'll pay to have 9-11 truthers murdered
[1:28:49.800 --> 1:28:58.800]  But a lot of times they will go after low level scum and we need to go to YouTube have them open a criminal complaint have his channel shut down
[1:28:58.800 --> 1:29:11.800]  Now you go to his channel and he talks about how people that disagree with the war basically need to have their kids children
[1:29:11.800 --> 1:29:16.800]  He says no because fundamentally there's nothing wrong with America however quite clearly there is something wrong with you
[1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:25.800]  Removing you from the gene pool will be wholeheartedly recommended and of course removing creations of you from the gene pool will have a good additional security measure
[1:29:25.800 --> 1:29:39.800]  It's all about murdering our children it's a brutal lust to commit genocide and to kill and hey the truth arise in criminals you're going down

[1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:58.800]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones only on the GCN radio network
[1:32:58.800 --> 1:33:04.800]  well giving a new meaning to the term working yourself to death
[1:33:06.800 --> 1:33:10.800]  that old saying really has a meaning and rejections
[1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:13.800]  daddy worked himself to death clearing the land
[1:33:13.800 --> 1:33:22.800]  a lot of people worked themselves to death to build this country and Kent Snyder worked himself to death to try to get Ron Pollock and president or some that is not enough still
[1:33:22.800 --> 1:33:30.800]  but we really appreciate Kent Snyder he was the head of the campaign we have Jesse Benton communications director Ron Paul 2008.com
[1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:36.800]  they've now formed the big Liberty group to continue the operation against the new world order
[1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:43.800]  and we're just going to take a few minutes of his time I want to get Ron Pollock the next few weeks to talk about this but also what attacking Iran will do to energy
[1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:49.800]  and more about the new Liberty committee that they have shut up and I've got just the man on the line to do that
[1:33:49.800 --> 1:34:01.800]  and that's Jesse Benton Jesse I was shocked to hear the news that he died last Thursday and the family very private kept it quiet until you guys got the OK to release it today
[1:34:01.800 --> 1:34:03.800]  this is just terrible news
[1:34:03.800 --> 1:34:11.800]  it is terrible news Alex it is really sad Kent was a great guy and a great gentleman and he was my friend and we're all really going to miss him
[1:34:11.800 --> 1:34:19.800]  well this viral pneumonia is killing people all over the country and you were telling me he had double viral pneumonia
[1:34:19.800 --> 1:34:26.800]  apparently he was hit by two strands of really really virulent viral pneumonia and he was just the kind of guy he was
[1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:34.800]  he was a little reluctant to even go to the hospital he's just kind of came from that old rugged kind of a classic American you don't really want about your problems
[1:34:34.800 --> 1:34:42.800]  and literally it was at Ron's really coaxing said Kent you sound terrible you need to get to the hospital get to the hospital all of a sudden
[1:34:42.800 --> 1:34:49.800]  he was intubated and they were treating it a very aggressive of the infection in his lungs they didn't realize that he had a second viral strain
[1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:57.800]  it was also attacking his lungs by the time that they realized that they got him treated so much of his lung tissue had been compromised
[1:34:57.800 --> 1:35:03.800]  literally just eaten away and destroyed that he was just never tragically able to regain his strength
[1:35:03.800 --> 1:35:14.800]  well it's horrible my friend just terrible talking about his accomplishments on the type of person he was and how important he was to this campaign for liberty
[1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:16.800]  can you speak about Kent Schneider?
[1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:23.800]  yeah I can and one thing that Dr. Paul wants everybody to know is that without Kent Schneider we never would have had this presidential campaign
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:33.800]  if you look and look and see what we accomplished and how we really accomplished more in 12 months then we were able to accomplish fighting for 30 years
[1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:40.800]  and really launched what we think is the first phase of a revolution to take back our freedoms it would not have happened without Kent Schneider
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:48.800]  Kent and his optimism his upbeat positive can do attitude convinced Dr. Paul that the time was right and that could be done
[1:35:48.800 --> 1:35:56.800]  and that there were people out there that were ready to listen and that we could really do this and we did and we took a major tremendous step forward
[1:35:56.800 --> 1:36:05.800]  and have I think really paved a path to where we can see light at the end of the tunnel we can accomplish this we can take back our freedoms
[1:36:05.800 --> 1:36:08.800]  and wouldn't have happened without Kent
[1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:15.800]  yeah Dr. Paul, Congressman Paul talked about the fact that it was Kent that finally pushed him over the edge to run
[1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:23.800]  and now even the trilateral commission is upset by the fact that the Liberty Revolution is taking over at the colleges
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:30.800]  not the fake right-wing neocon counterfeit that the establishment foundations have tried to use to fool young conservatives
[1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:39.800]  not the socialism of the left also the establishment to domesticate and control the population
[1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:49.800]  but the true rediscovery of Liberty legalized freedom is now happening and Kent his contribution and in finally pushing on Paul over the edge
[1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:55.800]  is really immeasurable not just to this country but the future of humanity
[1:36:55.800 --> 1:37:02.800]  I think you're absolutely right you know we need we need to remember just how important Kent was to make this tremendous step forward
[1:37:02.800 --> 1:37:10.800]  and I hope that we can honor Kent in every victory that we achieve as we move all move forward together
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:15.800]  Kent Schneider, what are they going to have a memorial service? Is it going to be closed? Is it going to be open?
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:20.800]  It looks like there's going to be a very private closed memorial service just really close personal friends and family
[1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:27.800]  I don't know it doesn't look like I even quite more merit being invited to that and I worked with a guy for a year and a half
[1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:36.800]  but I think that people could send their well wishes on to us at the campaign for Liberty and campaignforlivity.com
[1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:39.800]  and we'd be happy to send them off to the family
[1:37:39.800 --> 1:37:43.800]  How old was Kent? Kent was 49 years old, too young
[1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:45.800]  and who does he leave behind?
[1:37:45.800 --> 1:37:51.800]  He leaves behind his mother, two sisters and a lot of friends and coworkers that he touched
[1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:58.800]  Amazing well we really appreciate you spending time with us Jesse Bennett and all you've done for the campaign
[1:37:58.800 --> 1:38:02.800]  Tell us about the March coming up the 12th
[1:38:02.800 --> 1:38:04.800]  We think it's going to be really cool
[1:38:04.800 --> 1:38:10.800]  Dr. Paul just suggested on an internet video that hey wouldn't it be cool if we had a march on Washington
[1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:16.800]  and just like the grassroots out there have always done they took it upon themselves and put together a really cool program
[1:38:16.800 --> 1:38:21.800]  It's going to be on July 12th on the Mall in Washington D.C. Looks like there's going to be a lot of entertainment
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:28.800]  a lot of energy and Dr. Paul's going to go down and participate and say hi to everybody and even make a speech and march along
[1:38:28.800 --> 1:38:34.800]  and it's going to be really cool we hope that it goes off well and would encourage everybody to take a look
[1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:36.800]  It's very important that this be big
[1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:40.800]  I mean you can come to Austin and have 8,000 people or go to another town and have 15,000
[1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:44.800]  We need to have tens of thousands in Washington
[1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:48.800]  It's very very important for anybody in that area to show up for that and to spread the word
[1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:52.800]  We're only 12 days away from that taking place
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:56.800]  Again thank you for coming on short notice sorry to hear about the loss of Kent Snyder
[1:38:56.800 --> 1:38:58.800]  I know you were good friends with him it's very upsetting
[1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:01.800]  How's the congressman taking this?
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:05.800]  You know he's a very stoic guy but I think he's taking it hard
[1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:13.800]  He knew Kent for 20 years and anytime you lose a friend and someone that was loyal and works side by side with you like that it's tough
[1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:16.800]  How's Carol taking it?
[1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:24.800]  Carol's a little bit more emotional there were some tears but Carol's one of the warmest ladies I've ever had the opportunity to be around
[1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:26.800]  She's a sweetheart
[1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:32.800]  Jesse Benton any other key information on any other subjects dealing with the continued campaign for Liberty
[1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:41.800]  Right now we are working really hard on getting together a great program great event on September 2nd in Minneapolis
[1:39:41.800 --> 1:39:45.800]  And we'll be unrolling more things out as that comes along
[1:39:45.800 --> 1:39:52.800]  But we have our first big announcement Tucker Carlson from NBC has agreed to be our emcee for the day
[1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:54.800]  So that is going to be pretty cool
[1:39:54.800 --> 1:39:57.800]  Yeah that'll be great certainly get more media attention with that
[1:39:57.800 --> 1:40:03.800]  In closing Jesse I want to get the congressman on about his statements that we're going to have a tripling in energy prices
[1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:11.800]  If we attack Iran and everything he talked about with the devaluing currency is now really starting to accelerate unfortunately
[1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:15.800]  So I want to get him back up when is the soonest I can get him back up
[1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:19.800]  You know this week's not a bad week for that because congress is at a session
[1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:21.800]  Why don't you have your people call me and we'll get something set up
[1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:24.800]  Okay well I'm going to have Tray call you right now how's that sound
[1:40:24.800 --> 1:40:25.800]  Alright that sounds good
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:29.800]  Hey thank you people should visit RonPaul2008.com or should they visit
[1:40:29.800 --> 1:40:34.800]  CampaignforLiberty.com is our new site please join us our strength and numbers
[1:40:34.800 --> 1:40:39.800]  CampaignforLiberty.com well he will live on
[1:40:39.800 --> 1:40:44.800]  Kent Snyder will live on with the great accomplishments and the great foundation of Liberty
[1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:50.800]  The great rebirth of Liberty that new foundation that he's helped lay and he'll always be with us
[1:40:50.800 --> 1:40:51.800]  Thank you so much
[1:40:51.800 --> 1:40:52.800]  Thank you Alex
[1:40:52.800 --> 1:40:56.800]  There goes Jesse Benton Kent Snyder dead at 49
[1:40:56.800 --> 1:41:00.800]  I think the internet had it wrong and he died yesterday because it was kept quiet
[1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:08.800]  He died last Thursday there directly from Jesse Benton inside of the RonPaul army
[1:41:08.800 --> 1:41:12.800]  Right inside the command citadel
[1:41:12.800 --> 1:41:18.800]  Okay look I got massive news here but I'm just going to cover these new Iran developments with Ray McGovern
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:23.800]  When he joins us in 20 minutes let's go to calls because I promise we do that and I want to hear from you
[1:41:23.800 --> 1:41:26.800]  Peggy just dropped off it's always perfect timing
[1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:29.800]  Todd in Ohio you're on the air go ahead
[1:41:29.800 --> 1:41:39.800]  Yes Alex an issue that I have is you keep saying that the price of oil is now primarily because of dollar devaluation
[1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:47.800]  And I don't dispute that the dollar is losing its value I'm not like one of these Juppies or just Snickers
[1:41:47.800 --> 1:41:54.800]  When they hear dollar devaluation however it was just a few years ago and these articles are still on your site
[1:41:54.800 --> 1:42:03.800]  In which it was being reported in the news that oil companies were deliberately restricting their refining capacity domestically
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:11.800]  Hold on a second you're disagreeing with something I didn't say
[1:42:11.800 --> 1:42:18.800]  I said because I've done the math and watch the OPEC announcements and read the documents and have enough basic knowledge
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:26.800]  To know that a little over 70% of the increase in the price of oil is dollar devaluation
[1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:36.800]  Now absolutely we have written articles and exposed and I mention every week that the AP reported in 2001
[1:42:36.800 --> 1:42:44.800]  And they soon got the documents through four year that the oil companies in 95 and 96 had meetings
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:52.800]  And bought up over 200 refineries to artificially create a bottleneck inside the US because there were too many wildcat operations
[1:42:52.800 --> 1:42:56.800]  That is smaller companies bringing in oil and driving down the price
[1:42:56.800 --> 1:43:01.800]  So I'm not defending the oil companies they're a pack of Larsonist criminals
[1:43:01.800 --> 1:43:06.800]  And believe me folks I've had family that's dealt with them with leases and things
[1:43:06.800 --> 1:43:13.800]  My whole issue is I'm saying the overall crisis and what's spurred then the speculation
[1:43:13.800 --> 1:43:21.800]  Which is the rest of the 30% or so is the fact that globally people are running and racing away from dollars
[1:43:21.800 --> 1:43:27.800]  As fast as they can and dumping them into any commodity so commodities across the border are going up
[1:43:27.800 --> 1:43:31.800]  Now just wanted to make clear what I said go ahead
[1:43:31.800 --> 1:43:38.800]  The only reason I said that is because you were often heard you said that people were missing the mark when they were blaming oil companies
[1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:40.800]  Released that was the impression I got
[1:43:40.800 --> 1:43:44.800]  Well that's not the crisis that's going to completely destroy our economic future
[1:43:44.800 --> 1:43:50.800]  The dollar going I mean it's kind of like we're a ship and we've been strafed and that killed a few people
[1:43:50.800 --> 1:43:58.800]  And the torpedo is about to hit us that is going to blow the ship in two and I'm saying evasive action, evasive action
[1:43:58.800 --> 1:44:03.800]  Hard to port now to swing our tail around so that torpedo misses us
[1:44:03.800 --> 1:44:08.800]  So absolutely are the oil companies strafing us? Absolutely
[1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:14.800]  Right and one final point is one thing that often never gets mentioned
[1:44:14.800 --> 1:44:21.800]  Or the whole issue of the money system is being discussed is the fact that if everyone including the government got out of debt
[1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:26.800]  There would be no money because it's all created out of debt in the first place
[1:44:26.800 --> 1:44:28.800]  Yeah under the fiat system but not under
[1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:34.800]  Well if it were a debt free fiat system that wouldn't be the case the money supply would exist independently
[1:44:34.800 --> 1:44:41.800]  And I believe that's the idea a debt free fiat with government controls limited and public education about it in transparency
[1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:47.800]  The grand polls for the gold system the problem is the bankers now own almost all of that and that'd be a new monopoly
[1:44:47.800 --> 1:44:49.800]  But better than the one we've got
[1:44:49.800 --> 1:44:53.800]  Well one parter that I highly recommend getting on your show if possible
[1:44:53.800 --> 1:44:59.800]  Ellen H. Brown she came out with a book last year called the web of debt
[1:44:59.800 --> 1:45:01.800]  Our website is webofdebt.com
[1:45:01.800 --> 1:45:06.800]  And I have many books on this issue but this is probably the best one I've read so far
[1:45:06.800 --> 1:45:08.800]  I mean it really ties it all together
[1:45:08.800 --> 1:45:09.800]  What's her name?
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:16.800]  Ellen Brown if you type in webofdebt in Google that should be the first side that comes up
[1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:19.800]  And the subtitle is the shocking truth about our money system
[1:45:19.800 --> 1:45:23.800]  The slide of hand that has trapped us in debt and how we can break free
[1:45:23.800 --> 1:45:28.800]  And that's the key is that I mean yeah we need to be told about the problem but
[1:45:28.800 --> 1:45:31.800]  I think a lot of times and it certainly we don't focus enough on the solution
[1:45:31.800 --> 1:45:33.800]  Sure I hear you and I appreciate your call
[1:45:33.800 --> 1:45:40.800]  And you're right sometimes I don't make it clear I kind of abbreviate things and say it isn't the oil companies
[1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:51.800]  The oil companies have created the artificial bottleneck so that only so much oil can be refined into gasoline
[1:45:51.800 --> 1:46:00.800]  But still when they had that in place 8 years ago you were only paying $1.35
[1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:04.800]  Remember when that was expensive?
[1:46:04.800 --> 1:46:14.800]  Yeah it's gone from $1.35 6-7 years ago to $4.15 a gallon and it's only going to go up folks
[1:46:14.800 --> 1:46:20.800]  So yes because it would have been even cheaper if it wasn't for that
[1:46:20.800 --> 1:46:29.800]  Most of the people most of the groups most of the analysts out there say we'd be paying about 85 cents a gallon
[1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:31.800]  If we had true free market and true drilling
[1:46:31.800 --> 1:46:39.800]  But hey even if you have a free market and plenty of refineries if the dollar goes to nothing you're going to be paying more for it
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:45.800]  You see it's something that's international it's a commodity so they can't manipulate or play games with it
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:50.800]  Have you looked around you everything's up in prices
[1:46:50.800 --> 1:46:55.800]  Everything has increased in price
[1:46:55.800 --> 1:47:00.800]  Okay I'm going to go back to your calls in a little while but I want to get back into the news
[1:47:00.800 --> 1:47:04.800]  And I've got all this world news we're going to cover it but why is it so important?
[1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:10.800]  When you know I spent 10 minutes earlier talking about Dan Wallace's hero firefighter dad dies
[1:47:10.800 --> 1:47:15.800]  Then a few days after Dan Wallace made the statement you heard us play in the truth rising trailer about
[1:47:15.800 --> 1:47:19.800]  He'll never shut up about 9-11 he's been told to shut up he'll never show up
[1:47:19.800 --> 1:47:24.800]  He'll never shut up that he then died in his sleep
[1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:29.800]  And I mean just imagine being these Marines and army people and the vast majority of them aren't like this
[1:47:29.800 --> 1:47:40.800]  But the hardcore ones are or this Israeli identifies himself as an Israeli but then says he lives in New York and is a US citizen
[1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:48.800]  And he's in here saying I told him I would never stop talking about final about five years ago 9-11
[1:47:48.800 --> 1:47:51.800]  I told him I would never stop talking about five years ago 9-11
[1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:55.800]  Well Dan you're not talking now are you so you were wrong
[1:47:55.800 --> 1:48:00.800]  Laugh out loud laugh out loud ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
[1:48:00.800 --> 1:48:09.800]  He actually ponded himself here by saying he wouldn't stop doing something when clearly he has
[1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:15.800]  Still I guess having already been eaten by maggots going back on a statement he made
[1:48:15.800 --> 1:48:23.800]  And once again showing how truthers are always wrong and never stick to one thing
[1:48:23.800 --> 1:48:27.800]  Is the least of his worries laugh out loud he he he he he he
[1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:33.800]  And then it says this is again Ariel Silverstein one star video the only use this is about our trailer
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:39.800]  The only useful thing about the video is that it's a convenient resource to identify all the moronic truth or schizoids
[1:48:39.800 --> 1:48:44.800]  Who need bullets planted firmly in their heads I will pay $100,000 per truth or still get hunting
[1:48:44.800 --> 1:48:52.800]  Okay again identify this guy criminal charges demand them for soliciting murder at least call the FBI and put them on them
[1:48:52.800 --> 1:48:59.800]  And get his YouTube channel shut down right now get screenshots that give the give you know make a big deal
[1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:04.800]  Because they're setting a precedent just like the Nazis to be able to persecute people
[1:49:04.800 --> 1:49:10.800]  That's how it started with the SA and the SS Michael Reagan's helped set that precedent
[1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:17.800]  But Michael Reagan is going to be sued and held libel and will lose in court if violence is carried out and the way this is going
[1:49:17.800 --> 1:49:25.800]  See these delusional weak minded people start thinking it's normal to just talk about killing us and if they're allowed to
[1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:35.800]  So just so despicable he talks about how our children need to be killed on his own website
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:43.800]  His racial supremacy website now these guys are interchangeable with Nazis there's just really no difference
[1:49:43.800 --> 1:49:51.800]  You know they just it's all racial supremacy groups but it's okay that they're groups into racial supremacy I mean I've just had enough of it
[1:49:51.800 --> 1:50:02.800]  But then the white supremacists are also degenerate and disgusting as well it's just it's like the black supremacy groups are disgusting
[1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:11.800]  It's all these groups it's just so disgusting they all make me sick the Jewish groups the Nazi groups the black groups the Mexican groups
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:18.800]  You know I criticize Israel all day and I and their racial supremacy business and all their corruption and stage terror
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:28.800]  That isn't enough for the white supremacist groups they want me to hate Jews themselves and to have all them on the shows then they hate me you see
[1:50:28.800 --> 1:50:43.800]  Sick totally sick and the waters are getting deeper and darker okay huge news when we get back really important stuff I haven't even gotten to yet
[1:50:43.800 --> 1:50:50.800]  You'll want to stay with me for this truth rising ladies and gentlemen is almost out
[1:50:50.800 --> 1:50:57.800]  May I have everybody's attention please I've come with a message of information 9-11 was an inside job
[1:50:57.800 --> 1:51:00.800]  Do you like being a puppet sir do you like being a puppet for the New World Order
[1:51:00.800 --> 1:51:07.800]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage it was engineered by you David Rockefeller that's for a lateral commission to see it for
[1:51:07.800 --> 1:51:09.800]  Police in the un-shadow
[1:51:09.800 --> 1:51:16.800]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door
[1:51:16.800 --> 1:51:22.800]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11 a global awakening has taken place
[1:51:22.800 --> 1:51:26.800]  An inside job how dare you
[1:51:26.800 --> 1:51:32.800]  If you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for treason yourself
[1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:35.800]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue
[1:51:35.800 --> 1:51:40.800]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11

[1:53:00.800 --> 1:53:05.800]  Just by waving it near you, I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse
[1:53:05.800 --> 1:53:06.800]  Just watch

[1:53:13.800 --> 1:53:17.800]  I figure we'll make a fortune as long as people don't hear about identity stronghold
[1:53:17.800 --> 1:53:19.800]  Why? What's identity stronghold?
[1:53:19.800 --> 1:53:21.800]  They make the secure sleeve
[1:53:21.800 --> 1:53:25.800]  When people keep their credit cards in the shielded secure sleeve, I can't read them
[1:53:25.800 --> 1:53:28.800]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[1:53:28.800 --> 1:53:32.800]  No way, most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports
[1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:35.800]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves
[1:53:35.800 --> 1:53:38.800]  I already got some, I also got some to fit our passports
[1:53:38.800 --> 1:53:43.800]  Identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com

[1:54:45.800 --> 1:54:47.800]  Let it sink in
[1:54:47.800 --> 1:54:50.800]  Polarein, oh
[1:54:50.800 --> 1:54:53.800]  We're going to have to subray McGovern next hour and take calls
[1:54:57.800 --> 1:55:03.800]  The criminals that run our government for five years have been staging terror attacks all over Iran
[1:55:03.800 --> 1:55:08.800]  using true Wahhabist, true original al Qaeda
[1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:11.800]  Publicly, who they say number three in al Qaeda runs one big group
[1:55:11.800 --> 1:55:15.800]  Attacking Iran while saying Iran is al Qaeda
[1:55:15.800 --> 1:55:17.800]  That's how dumb they think you are
[1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:22.800]  That's how ridiculous their propaganda is at you
[1:55:22.800 --> 1:55:25.800]  The McCain gets exposed for saying Iran's al Qaeda
[1:55:25.800 --> 1:55:28.800]  He went before in the Senate committee and said to Matraeus
[1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:30.800]  Isn't Iran al Qaeda?
[1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:32.800]  Matraeus said yes they are
[1:55:32.800 --> 1:55:35.800]  Like saying isn't the moon made of cheese
[1:55:35.800 --> 1:55:37.800]  Swiss cheese, yes it is
[1:55:37.800 --> 1:55:40.800]  And I walk up there every day on my chimney
[1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:43.800]  And reach up to the moon and scrape off some cheese from my sandwich
[1:55:43.800 --> 1:55:46.800]  I mean it's that stupid
[1:55:49.800 --> 1:55:52.800]  Lieberman, latest a pitch for new terror attack
[1:55:52.800 --> 1:55:57.800]  Now, we got five or six Republican strategy memos
[1:55:57.800 --> 1:56:01.800]  White House, gubernatorial, state chairman, chairman
[1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:08.800]  GOPAC, we've got syndicated columnist, columnist, a writer for the
[1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:11.800]  Philadelphia Daily News
[1:56:11.800 --> 1:56:14.800]  We've got all these talk show hosts
[1:56:14.800 --> 1:56:20.800]  We've got McCain's chief advisor on foreign policy saying we need a big terror attack
[1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:25.800]  We have Dick Cheney who was attributed for writing the PNAC plan
[1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:28.800]  The particular paper that called for staged terror events
[1:56:28.800 --> 1:56:31.800]  And now they had some PNAC guy go no I wrote that
[1:56:31.800 --> 1:56:34.800]  The vice president did, it means nothing
[1:56:34.800 --> 1:56:37.800]  They're all telling you why terror is good for them
[1:56:37.800 --> 1:56:39.800]  Well then Kibono, who benefits?
[1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:43.800]  And then all the evidence shows they did it
[1:56:43.800 --> 1:56:46.800]  And then Gary Hart writes letters to Iran
[1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:48.800]  Saying our government will stage terror attacks
[1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:51.800]  You better do whatever I say
[1:56:51.800 --> 1:56:54.800]  Lieberman, latest a pitch for new terror attack
[1:56:54.800 --> 1:56:57.800]  Senator says new president will be welcome to buy a test
[1:56:57.800 --> 1:57:02.800]  The inaugural bombing, ladies and gentlemen
[1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:06.800]  And you'll learn to love those that have taken your dollar, taken your future
[1:57:06.800 --> 1:57:08.800]  And you know what, you're gonna love them
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:11.800]  You're gonna rally around the flag as they destroy what the flag symbolizes
[1:57:11.800 --> 1:57:16.800]  Senator Joe Lieberman has echoed a national talking point
[1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:20.800]  By promising that a new president will be welcomed by a terror attack in 2009
[1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:24.800]  Continuing a disturbing trend by talking heads anxiously
[1:57:24.800 --> 1:57:28.800]  Relishing a catastrophic pretext to reinvigorate the neocon agenda
[1:57:28.800 --> 1:57:31.800]  And then when it happens they'll say see we told you it's your fault
[1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:33.800]  You didn't do whatever we said
[1:57:33.800 --> 1:57:36.800]  And then, remember I always told you before they stage another attack
[1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:40.800]  They'd start talking like this, better let me have your rides or you'll get hit
[1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:43.800]  Better, oh you didn't do what I say, you got hit
[1:57:43.800 --> 1:57:47.800]  Like your child, as if it's not obvious they're the ones doing it
[1:57:47.800 --> 1:57:51.800]  Our enemies will test us new president early Lieberman
[1:57:51.800 --> 1:57:54.800]  From Connecticut told Face the Nation Bob Shaffer
[1:57:54.800 --> 1:57:57.800]  Remember that a truck bomb of World Trade Center happened
[1:57:57.800 --> 1:58:00.800]  In the first year of the Clinton administration, 9-11 happened
[1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:03.800]  In the first year of the Bush administration
[1:58:03.800 --> 1:58:06.800]  Lieberman's comments follow last month's Washington Times report
[1:58:06.800 --> 1:58:09.800]  Concerning a warning from national intelligence spooks
[1:58:09.800 --> 1:58:12.800]  That Islamic terrorists will attempt to exploit the transition of power
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:15.800]  By planning an attack on America
[1:58:15.800 --> 1:58:17.800]  Meanwhile, they've got reports every day everywhere that
[1:58:17.800 --> 1:58:21.800]  The brown-haired blue-eyed al-Qaeda is everywhere
[1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:25.800]  A kid draws a picture of a gun, white kid they arrest them, say they're al-Qaeda
[1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:29.800]  I mean they're getting ready, it's all for you dumb America

[2:00:13.800 --> 2:00:17.800]  High-level CIA analyst talking about government stage terror
[2:00:17.800 --> 2:00:24.800]  Lieberman, latest to pitch for new terror attack, says it'll really help John McCain
[2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:28.800]  Says it'll, if it's Barack Obama, the terrorists are gonna attack to test him
[2:00:28.800 --> 2:00:31.800]  He talked about the first World Trade Center attack
[2:00:31.800 --> 2:00:34.800]  Now this was a CBS news piece you're about to hear
[2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:41.800]  For prisonplanet.tv viewers, you can go to prisonplanet.com in the article that Paul Watson wrote
[2:00:41.800 --> 2:00:45.800]  And you can watch the clip there
[2:00:45.800 --> 2:00:50.800]  And Dan Rather, now this is how they report an incredible news story
[2:00:50.800 --> 2:00:54.800]  And then do it dryly where you don't realize what you're seeing
[2:00:54.800 --> 2:00:57.800]  We've interviewed the lawyers, we've played some of the tapes on air
[2:00:57.800 --> 2:01:02.800]  It was in the New York Times at the time, the FBI went out, found Muslims
[2:01:02.800 --> 2:01:07.800]  They found two guys on welfare who were low-grade retarded, 75 IQs
[2:01:07.800 --> 2:01:12.800]  They found a blind cleric, Sheikh Abdel Rachman, over a pizza parlor
[2:01:12.800 --> 2:01:18.800]  And they paid him a bunch of money and they hired Egyptian security intelligence people
[2:01:18.800 --> 2:01:21.800]  And told them we're gonna cook a fake bomb and sting them
[2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:24.800]  And then they told them, make them a real bomb
[2:01:24.800 --> 2:01:27.800]  And they said, I don't wanna do that, and they said, you're under orders
[2:01:27.800 --> 2:01:31.800]  So they made them a real bomb and then they trained them how to drive and park it and blow it up
[2:01:31.800 --> 2:01:33.800]  So that's provocateur
[2:01:33.800 --> 2:01:36.800]  And that's a fact, the government did that
[2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:39.800]  I mean, they went out and whole cloth found the groups and did it
[2:01:39.800 --> 2:01:44.800]  Kind of like they tried to get black street kids to blow up the FBI building in Miami
[2:01:44.800 --> 2:01:49.800]  I mean, they had a whole cloth, the Bum Steer Award in 98 in Texas and Texas Monthly
[2:01:49.800 --> 2:01:54.800]  Where the FBI created a Klan group, literally two Klan guys and their wives
[2:01:54.800 --> 2:01:57.800]  Who were such alcoholics, they couldn't even pay for their trailer bills
[2:01:57.800 --> 2:02:00.800]  Out by Fort Worth and so drunk they could hardly get out of bed
[2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:06.800]  And the FBI guy made a black powder bottle bomb and had them talk about attacking the White House
[2:02:06.800 --> 2:02:10.800]  The chemical plant where it was deadly Klan attack, they were planning to kill everyone
[2:02:10.800 --> 2:02:13.800]  Let's go ahead and play part of this newscast, listen to it
[2:02:13.800 --> 2:02:18.800]  Last one of the FBI was praised for its speed in cracking the case of the World Trade Center bombing
[2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:20.800]  And bringing four suspects to trial
[2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:25.800]  Now, there is some evidence that the FBI may have known the plot in advance
[2:02:25.800 --> 2:02:30.800]  Through an informant and might, might even have stopped the bombing that killed six people
[2:02:30.800 --> 2:02:33.800]  Correspondent Jacqueline Adams has the story
[2:02:33.800 --> 2:02:41.800]  FBI agents might have been able to prevent last February's deadly explosion at New York's World Trade Center
[2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:44.800]  Stop right there, might have been able to stop
[2:02:44.800 --> 2:02:51.800]  And then they calmly report, oh by the way, they ordered the guy to build a real bomb
[2:02:51.800 --> 2:02:58.800]  The way they say it is they go, and they could have replaced it with non-explosive materials
[2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:01.800]  No, no, no, they built the bomb and told them to do it with real materials
[2:03:01.800 --> 2:03:05.800]  The way that's implied, you have the transcripts and the admissions, they made the bomb
[2:03:05.800 --> 2:03:08.800]  But the way that's implied, the way they spin that without lying
[2:03:08.800 --> 2:03:12.800]  You'd think, oh, they didn't make that bomb, they just could have replaced it
[2:03:12.800 --> 2:03:14.800]  Back to the tape
[2:03:14.800 --> 2:03:17.800]  Last February's deadly explosion at New York's World Trade Center
[2:03:17.800 --> 2:03:23.800]  They discussed secretly substituting harmless powder for the explosives, but they didn't
[2:03:23.800 --> 2:03:26.800]  According to the FBI's own informant, Imad Salem
[2:03:26.800 --> 2:03:30.800]  Unbeknownst to the FBI at the time, Salem reported millions come
[2:03:30.800 --> 2:03:32.800]  Stop right there, that is pure bull
[2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:36.800]  In the transcripts, he went and recorded them, he thought they were setting them up, which no doubt they do
[2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:40.800]  They get air of agents who think they're going after terrorists and then set them up
[2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:44.800]  Because they need a real intelligence officer, somebody who looks like they could do it
[2:03:44.800 --> 2:03:46.800]  Not two retarded street kids
[2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:50.800]  Okay, and so he went and recorded hours
[2:03:50.800 --> 2:03:55.800]  One recording was nine hours saying, you made me build a real bomb, you gave me a real detonator
[2:03:55.800 --> 2:03:57.800]  I'm not stupid, why aren't you busting them?
[2:03:57.800 --> 2:04:02.800]  But see, they just lied right there, you can read the transcripts of the tapes, they're online
[2:04:02.800 --> 2:04:09.800]  They just lied and spun that to where, oh, the FBI didn't know, oh, Salem
[2:04:09.800 --> 2:04:12.800]  Go ahead and play it, unbelievable
[2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:18.800]  Unbeknownst to the FBI at the time, Salem recorded many of his conversations with his handlers
[2:04:18.800 --> 2:04:22.800]  I'm holding 903 pages of draft transcripts
[2:04:22.800 --> 2:04:26.800]  William Consular represents Sheikh Omar Abdel Rakhman and several others
[2:04:26.800 --> 2:04:30.800]  Later I'm going to play the whole thing and decipher it, it's just, look
[2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:34.800]  They provocateur the attacks or they stage them, okay?
[2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:36.800]  Get that straight
[2:04:36.800 --> 2:04:42.800]  Harat's reports, Jerusalem Post reports that a lot of the terror attacks in Israel are done by the government
[2:04:42.800 --> 2:04:44.800]  That's not me, that's Israel admitting it
[2:04:44.800 --> 2:04:47.800]  The government stage in this stuff
[2:04:47.800 --> 2:04:50.800]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:55.800]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes and more?
[2:04:55.800 --> 2:04:59.800]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients
[2:04:59.800 --> 2:05:01.800]  Most of which are synthetic
[2:05:01.800 --> 2:05:02.800]  Hi, this is Alex Jones
[2:05:02.800 --> 2:05:05.800]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives
[2:05:05.800 --> 2:05:12.800]  That can lead to coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and mucous membranes

[2:05:59.800 --> 2:06:01.800]  But you know I'm gonna say it anyway
[2:06:01.800 --> 2:06:04.800]  The government doesn't want the best for you
[2:06:04.800 --> 2:06:06.800]  They keep you down, they keep you blue
[2:06:06.800 --> 2:06:10.800]  They starve your body for all its nutrients

[2:06:14.800 --> 2:06:16.800]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense

[2:07:52.800 --> 2:07:55.800]  The information war continues
[2:07:55.800 --> 2:07:58.800]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[2:08:01.800 --> 2:08:04.800]  We had him on last week, he's back with us again
[2:08:04.800 --> 2:08:06.800]  I really appreciate him spending this much time with us
[2:08:06.800 --> 2:08:08.800]  It's precious time
[2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:11.800]  Ray McGovern, senior CIA analyst, Ronald Reagan
[2:08:11.800 --> 2:08:14.800]  George Bush Sr. gave the morning briefings
[2:08:14.800 --> 2:08:16.800]  Highly respected
[2:08:16.800 --> 2:08:19.800]  Heads up, a veteran intelligence analyst for sanity
[2:08:19.800 --> 2:08:21.800]  Everything you've talked about has come true or happened
[2:08:21.800 --> 2:08:23.800]  He's been right all along, he's confronted
[2:08:23.800 --> 2:08:26.800]  Famously, Donald Rumsfeld about his lying about
[2:08:26.800 --> 2:08:30.800]  Saying that WMDs were in Iraq and then saying he never said that
[2:08:30.800 --> 2:08:34.800]  He has just done so much, he's been arrested for protesting in America
[2:08:34.800 --> 2:08:37.800]  Without a license, like this is the old Soviet Union
[2:08:37.800 --> 2:08:39.800]  Or Nazi Germany
[2:08:39.800 --> 2:08:42.800]  And he's also battling lymphoma cancer right now
[2:08:42.800 --> 2:08:45.800]  So again, we're very thankful for him, he'll be with us for the next hour
[2:08:45.800 --> 2:08:47.800]  At the bottom of the hour, just on Iraq
[2:08:47.800 --> 2:08:49.800]  Or what's happening with Iran
[2:08:49.800 --> 2:08:52.800]  Those are the main subjects we're talking about today
[2:08:52.800 --> 2:08:55.800]  We can bring up 9-11 or government sponsored stage events, whatever
[2:08:55.800 --> 2:09:00.800]  But just on those main issues, 1-800-259-9231
[2:09:00.800 --> 2:09:02.800]  Going to Ray McGovern
[2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:05.800]  Mr. McGovern, a lot has happened since you were on with us a week ago
[2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:08.800]  Yeah, things are moving very fast, Alex
[2:09:08.800 --> 2:09:11.800]  And not in the right direction
[2:09:11.800 --> 2:09:14.800]  And that's why I appreciate you coming on, you know the time is short
[2:09:14.800 --> 2:09:17.800]  They're wanting to attack Iran, as you've said
[2:09:17.800 --> 2:09:20.800]  Kind of repeat the basics of where we sit
[2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:24.800]  And then I wanted to give you more time to flesh out what we're dealing with
[2:09:24.800 --> 2:09:26.800]  And just things that Ray McGovern thinks is most important
[2:09:26.800 --> 2:09:29.800]  Then I want to look at the deteriorating situation, not just in Iraq
[2:09:29.800 --> 2:09:32.800]  But also in Afghanistan and then all these neocons
[2:09:32.800 --> 2:09:38.800]  Lieberman, speech writers, columnists saying terror attacks would sure be great
[2:09:38.800 --> 2:09:41.800]  I mean, it's really getting obvious here
[2:09:41.800 --> 2:09:47.800]  These guys are acting crazier and crazier, which has caused for more alarms
[2:09:47.800 --> 2:09:51.800]  Whatever Ray McGovern thinks is most important, and this is a sizable audience
[2:09:51.800 --> 2:09:56.800]  How you think we may have some chance in hell of turning this around
[2:09:56.800 --> 2:10:04.800]  Well, Alex, let me pick up on your mention of the terrorist event that could help John McCain
[2:10:04.800 --> 2:10:10.800]  You know, if you look beyond the outrageous nature of that remark
[2:10:10.800 --> 2:10:17.800]  One has to conclude that the Republican Party is convinced
[2:10:17.800 --> 2:10:21.800]  And most people would suggest that there were there to be such a terrorist event
[2:10:21.800 --> 2:10:27.800]  Wherever that McCain would profit more from it than Obama, certainly
[2:10:27.800 --> 2:10:33.800]  For the same reasons that Bush was able to use the scare tactic to get elected, to re-elect it
[2:10:33.800 --> 2:10:39.800]  So I'd just like to draw an analogy there between that truism
[2:10:39.800 --> 2:10:43.800]  Namely that some sort of event like that would help McCain
[2:10:43.800 --> 2:10:48.800]  To the notion that here's McCain in September, let us say
[2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:53.800]  And he's just as far behind in September as he is now
[2:10:53.800 --> 2:10:55.800]  Maybe even farther behind
[2:10:55.800 --> 2:11:01.800]  And they need something to juice up his candidacy, some new event
[2:11:01.800 --> 2:11:07.800]  And for that, and for other reasons, an attack on Iran
[2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:13.800]  Now, if a terrorist event helps John McCain's choice of chances
[2:11:13.800 --> 2:11:21.800]  Then these rather desperate people running the campaign for McCain
[2:11:21.800 --> 2:11:25.800]  Might well conclude that, you know, a white of war
[2:11:25.800 --> 2:11:29.800]  Certainly that would double down, that would certainly help us
[2:11:29.800 --> 2:11:36.800]  Because who wants to elect an inexperienced person not familiar with war
[2:11:36.800 --> 2:11:42.800]  So that's part of the perfect storm that I see coming in September and October
[2:11:42.800 --> 2:11:49.800]  Where General Petraeus takes charge of CENTCOM, the command overseeing that part of the world
[2:11:49.800 --> 2:11:54.800]  Petraeus and Cheney having a long record of working together very closely
[2:11:54.800 --> 2:12:02.800]  To the point of Petraeus actually saying both face lies with respect to Iranian provided weaponry
[2:12:02.800 --> 2:12:07.800]  And so you've got all that coming together at a time when it looks like
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:14.800]  McCain needs something desperate, something out of heaven to improve his chances
[2:12:14.800 --> 2:12:21.800]  Now, the problem is that, well, the main problem as I see it, Alex
[2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:25.800]  Is that there's been a sea change in our body politic here
[2:12:25.800 --> 2:12:29.800]  And that is that we no longer have a free media
[2:12:29.800 --> 2:12:33.800]  And that's where you and I come in, in our attempts to spread some truth around
[2:12:33.800 --> 2:12:37.800]  The problem is the American people have been told the Bill of Good
[2:12:37.800 --> 2:12:41.800]  That Iran is some sort of a threat to all of us, a threat to Israel
[2:12:41.800 --> 2:12:45.800]  And by extension to all of us, and they don't know the basics
[2:12:45.800 --> 2:12:49.800]  They don't know, for example, that 16, that's all of them
[2:12:49.800 --> 2:12:54.800]  16 intelligence agencies and the U.S. government concluded late last year
[2:12:54.800 --> 2:13:02.800]  Just at about this time that Iran had ceased working on the nuclear weapons-related port
[2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:04.800]  Of its nuclear program
[2:13:04.800 --> 2:13:09.800]  And that they had not, they had ceased doing that in mid-2003
[2:13:09.800 --> 2:13:15.800]  And they had not resumed doing that as of mid-year, last year when the estimate went to bed
[2:13:15.800 --> 2:13:20.800]  Now, it may be, well, it certainly is, that Cheney and the president didn't like that conclusion
[2:13:20.800 --> 2:13:25.800]  Certainly they were saying the opposite when they knew the estimate was going to come out that way
[2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:28.800]  But now they've totally disted the estimate
[2:13:28.800 --> 2:13:37.800]  They actively never heard about it, and that is the major indignity that I see as a former intelligence officer
[2:13:37.800 --> 2:13:40.800]  If they're going to say that those judgments are wrong
[2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:47.800]  Well, it seems to me the burden proof is upon them to say, well, what information have we gotten in since late last year?
[2:13:47.800 --> 2:13:52.800]  Plus, they've been as credited as congenital manufacturers of evidence and liars
[2:13:52.800 --> 2:13:56.800]  It's not like they were just wrong about Iraq, they knew it was a fraud
[2:13:56.800 --> 2:14:10.800]  Exactly, yeah, and so one wonders, could they perpetrate yet another Godforsaken war, this time on Iran, with the support of the American people?
[2:14:10.800 --> 2:14:14.800]  Well, unfortunately, the American people are very ill-informed
[2:14:14.800 --> 2:14:24.800]  The American Congress, who sees its role as a defender as much of Israel as of the United States
[2:14:24.800 --> 2:14:32.800]  Is held bent and determined to cooperate with the Bush regime here
[2:14:32.800 --> 2:14:38.800]  To the point of passing legislation, advocating a blockade of Iran, an act of war, okay?
[2:14:38.800 --> 2:14:45.800]  Well, can we look at other nations, what do you think with Gordon Brown England's going to do if this happens?
[2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:54.800]  You know, the English have been an incredible disappointment to me
[2:14:54.800 --> 2:15:02.800]  I would have expected that after the incredible performance of Tony Blair, that Gordon Brown would be more sensible
[2:15:02.800 --> 2:15:11.800]  But I see no evidence of that, and I see them sort of going along as our poor rule, as they chose to do during the Blair regime
[2:15:11.800 --> 2:15:15.800]  And now they've put Sarkozy in, so it looks to me like they're lining up their ducks
[2:15:15.800 --> 2:15:26.800]  There's a commitment, Israel itself, why does Israel, when they just lost in Lebanon, against, what would you say, sir, one, one-twentieth of the force the Iranians have or less?
[2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:33.800]  I mean, if they can't beat a few guys with rocket launchers, how are they going to beat Iran?
[2:15:33.800 --> 2:15:42.800]  I mean, what's going on with Israel with swirling corruption and bizarre shootings on the tarmac with Sarkozy?
[2:15:42.800 --> 2:15:45.800]  I mean, this is really getting foggy
[2:15:45.800 --> 2:15:56.800]  Well, we're talking, it's hard to talk about Israel generically because a right-wing extremist group is ruling that country just as is the case here in the United States
[2:15:56.800 --> 2:16:04.800]  But this right-wing extremist group would have us believe that it feels incredibly threatened by Iran
[2:16:04.800 --> 2:16:19.800]  Now, that requires a mental gymnastic, because Israel has between 200 and 300 nuclear weapons, deliverable by sea, underwater, missile, and bomber, and Iran has none
[2:16:19.800 --> 2:16:30.800]  And the notion that were Iran to get one, that it would commit suicide by firing that one in the direction of Israel, that's mind-boggling
[2:16:30.800 --> 2:16:32.800]  So, what are the Israelis really afraid of?
[2:16:32.800 --> 2:16:47.800]  Well, I've been told recently that Israel, of course, depends so much on immigration people coming in there and populating not only Israel, but the settlements that they're putting up on occupied land, occupied Palestinian land
[2:16:47.800 --> 2:16:58.800]  Now, that has fallen off. Why? Well, because the settlers are a little afraid to come into Israel because of all this self-generated propaganda that Iran is a big threat
[2:16:58.800 --> 2:17:09.800]  Once Israel starts losing more than it's getting as immigrants, and that truly sounds to death now for the Israeli state
[2:17:09.800 --> 2:17:19.800]  They're already threatened by the dynamics of the population, and they just can't afford to have this kind of existential threat, in that sense
[2:17:19.800 --> 2:17:30.800]  So, they'd like to do this, and the big controlling factor, of course, Alex, is the fact that our president and vice president are only going to be around for six more months
[2:17:30.800 --> 2:17:41.800]  Our president and our vice president have this special affinity, this passionate attachment, in George Washington's words, toward the state of Israel
[2:17:41.800 --> 2:17:54.800]  And Olmert said it all after he talked to Bush on the 4th of June for an hour and a half, he said, the president understands, and he knows how we need to destroy this threat
[2:17:54.800 --> 2:17:59.800]  And he assured me that before he leaves office, he'll take care of Iran
[2:17:59.800 --> 2:18:04.800]  That's an amazing statement. I mean, that sounds a lot of funality there, sir
[2:18:04.800 --> 2:18:12.800]  It's not like some commentator on Fox News, although it does sound like a commentator on Fox News
[2:18:12.800 --> 2:18:20.800]  This is the prime minister of Israel. Now, does that sound like a man who thinks Bush is full of bluff and bluster? I don't think so
[2:18:20.800 --> 2:18:30.800]  And I think that Bush and Cheney both feel that they have this personal commitment they've made to Israel to get rid of the Iranian threat before they leave office
[2:18:30.800 --> 2:18:40.800]  Now, were they to strike out militarily against Iran, there isn't a person, a same person in this country that thinks that we could escape unscathed
[2:18:40.800 --> 2:18:44.800]  Or that it wouldn't be a disaster not only for us, but for the state of Israel
[2:18:44.800 --> 2:18:52.800]  The Iranians have all manner of ways to retaliate and, you know, they're not a pushover like Iraq
[2:18:52.800 --> 2:18:57.800]  And so the logic of the thing is, oh, well, this is just bluff and bluster
[2:18:57.800 --> 2:19:06.800]  But when you look, you know, I think Gallifrey talked about this before, intelligence analysts, you know, they feed off all kinds of classified stuff
[2:19:06.800 --> 2:19:15.800]  But the real meat and potatoes for our job are authoritative statements at the highest level, okay?
[2:19:15.800 --> 2:19:25.800]  And when Olmert says what he just said, and when what I'm about to tell you what Skokrov said just a couple years ago, then you'll understand a little bit better what I'm talking about
[2:19:25.800 --> 2:19:28.800]  And weighing the role that Israel has put
[2:19:28.800 --> 2:19:35.800]  I want to talk about what will, you know, the different breaks, different scenarios that could happen when you think it's going to happen, if it does
[2:19:35.800 --> 2:19:41.800]  Then hopefully ways to turn it around, then we'll look at Iraq, Afghanistan and what's going to happen economically
[2:19:41.800 --> 2:20:07.800]  Look, bare minimum if this strike takes place, Ray McGovern on the other side
[2:20:07.800 --> 2:20:21.800]  This is the secret the oil and auto industry doesn't want you to know
[2:20:21.800 --> 2:20:26.800]  Go to gasfreedom.info to learn how easy it is to extract energy from water to run your car
[2:20:26.800 --> 2:20:45.800]  During the month of June, visit gasfreedom.info and receive $100 off of your order, turn any car into a hybrid and laugh all the way to the bank
[2:20:45.800 --> 2:20:56.800]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right? First, I get the best parking space at work. Tonight I have a date with a very lovely Rachel
[2:20:56.800 --> 2:21:05.800]  And today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney, finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston, online from my desk with WebEx
[2:21:05.800 --> 2:21:16.800]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk, I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop
[2:21:16.800 --> 2:21:37.800]  See you tonight with Rachel
[2:21:37.800 --> 2:21:57.800]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs? I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds
[2:21:57.800 --> 2:22:08.800]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS revenue ruling 6045 of 1984
[2:22:08.800 --> 2:22:16.800]  and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention
[2:22:16.800 --> 2:22:28.800]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately. Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free
[2:22:28.800 --> 2:22:47.800]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237. When investing, always proceed with caution. Again, call 1-800-686-2237. Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately. 1-800-686-2237
[2:22:47.800 --> 2:22:58.800]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[2:22:58.800 --> 2:23:05.800]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CFR?
[2:23:05.800 --> 2:23:13.800]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[2:23:13.800 --> 2:23:18.800]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:23:18.800 --> 2:23:23.800]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:23:23.800 --> 2:23:29.800]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:23:29.800 --> 2:23:32.800]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:23:32.800 --> 2:23:38.800]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[2:23:38.800 --> 2:23:44.800]  It's rising. Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:23:44.800 --> 2:23:47.800]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:23:47.800 --> 2:24:12.800]  Ray McGovern is, my guest, the rest of the hour. Your phone call is coming up later in the hour at 1-800-259-9231. You've gotten to the point of, yes, Brits Krokoff, we've had Jimmy Carter come out, so many others trying to warn us. Please continue, sir.
[2:24:12.800 --> 2:24:28.800]  Yes, Alex. The thing I'd like to repeat about Brits Krokoff is simply this, that when you're looking for good sources and intelligence, you look for people who've been around for a while, people who have been on the inside, people who have contemporary information about what's going on.
[2:24:28.800 --> 2:24:38.800]  And the quintessential source in this respect was Brits Krokoff, when he was head of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.
[2:24:38.800 --> 2:24:49.800]  Now, that's under the youthful President, Bush 2. Under Bush 1, he was the National Security Advisor, so he's a heavyweight fellow. He knows his way around.
[2:24:49.800 --> 2:25:07.800]  Now, in the middle of 2004, he sought it to go to the Financial Times and say two things to them. He said, you should know, the American people should know, that Ariel Sharon, who is then the Israeli Prime Minister, has our President wrapped around his little finger.
[2:25:07.800 --> 2:25:20.800]  That Ariel Sharon has our President mesmerized. Those were Krokoff's words. The next Monday, of course, he was canned from his job, but this was so atypical of Krokoff.
[2:25:20.800 --> 2:25:32.800]  He scratched my head saying, why? Why would he do that? Why would he step out and say those things? And I can only, you know, the explanation seems very simple.
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:46.800]  He thought it very important for the American people to know that this was an unbalanced President we had, that he has somehow been captivated by his Israeli, what he calls, allies, and that he's pretty much under their spell.
[2:25:46.800 --> 2:25:50.800]  Do you think that's just being captivated, or do you think he's being blackmailed?
[2:25:50.800 --> 2:26:02.800]  Well, you know, it's kind of a fine line here. I think, yeah, I don't think they have much to blackmail them on, but they do have Dick Cheney sitting right in there telling them what to do.
[2:26:02.800 --> 2:26:18.800]  It's very, very curious because Sharon was the person who escorted Governor George W. Bush when he was governor in Texas in 1999 on a trip by the Republican Jewish Committee.
[2:26:18.800 --> 2:26:32.800]  And he took them over, Gaza, and he took them over, you know, a helicopter over the West Bank and so forth, and he, you know, swashbuckling testosterone oozing from every poor Sharon really impressed the President.
[2:26:32.800 --> 2:26:39.800]  That's what the President would really like to be. And so he's, you know, watch him when he's in Israel, and all of it is praising him.
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:50.800]  He turns into sort of like a butter and jelly, the gosh, these people appreciate me. And he has undertaken, Olmert has said it.
[2:26:50.800 --> 2:26:56.800]  He has undertaken to make sure that the Israelis do not have to live with a nuclear weapon.
[2:26:56.800 --> 2:27:00.800]  Now, Ron Paul's talking about, I'm sorry, sir, go ahead.
[2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:11.800]  No, I was just going to say, the only break on this activity has not been in the Congress or certainly not in the press, but on the part of the Uniform Military Service people.
[2:27:11.800 --> 2:27:21.800]  That's what I was going to bring up was Admiral Fallon. I mean, this wasn't some shrieking violent. Why is the brass saying no to the war and a huge exodus?
[2:27:21.800 --> 2:27:37.800]  Well, they know better than they know most that this would be a disaster, not only for Israel, not only for our country, but for the armed forces of which they hold command and which they care about very much to their credit.
[2:27:37.800 --> 2:27:48.800]  So Fallon, you know, watching the way our policy was being devised, he spoke out and told people he knew it, get to the press, that we're not going to do Iran on my watch.
[2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:57.800]  And he had used all kinds of reasons why it would be a crazy thing to do. He knew that would come out in the press. He was willing to accept the consequences. Why?
[2:27:57.800 --> 2:28:04.800]  Because he didn't want to be on the receiving end of an order from the likes of Dick Cheney and Elliot Abrams, which pretty much...
[2:28:04.800 --> 2:28:19.800]  Why do the politicians throughout history do what Napoleon did, what Hitler did, even though they were military men? I mean, they're constantly miscalculating. I'm no expert, but I can read all the experts say I can study history. I'm a student of history.
[2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:33.800]  I guarantee we've already lost our good name. If we are sucked into premeditatedly attacking Iran and then say we're going to nuke them with many nukes if they fight back, and then everybody knows we've got special ops in there, staging events.
[2:28:33.800 --> 2:28:38.800]  I mean, we're definitely the bad guys here. There's no way to win this.
[2:28:38.800 --> 2:28:52.800]  That's true. It was also a tour of Iraq. But you know, people who have watched this, wise people, people like Thomas Powers, who often writes for the New York Review of Books, he's got an article out in the July issue.
[2:28:52.800 --> 2:29:07.800]  And let me just read you a little thing he says at the end, which really struck me. He says, the president's frustration is really evident. Saddam Hussein's gone, but Iran remains defiant and more powerful than ever.
[2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:14.800]  The president's male pride seems to have been aroused. He's going to solve this problem, and he doesn't want to back down.
[2:29:14.800 --> 2:29:24.800]  Look at his body language, says Powers. But does he have the power to carry out his threats? That's the $64 question.
[2:29:24.800 --> 2:29:32.800]  And we know they're using the mentally unstable mental midget as a front for other interests. I want to talk about when we get back from break, the power behind the throne.
[2:29:32.800 --> 2:29:36.800]  In fact, we're going to skip this break and talk behind the scenes right now with Ray McGovern.
[2:29:36.800 --> 2:29:47.800]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:08.800 --> 2:30:13.800]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[2:30:47.800 --> 2:30:56.800]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[2:30:56.800 --> 2:31:13.800]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin. The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[2:31:13.800 --> 2:31:26.800]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first, hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria. What about you?
[2:31:26.800 --> 2:31:32.800]  Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.

[2:32:22.800 --> 2:32:25.800]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[2:32:25.800 --> 2:32:29.800]  No way. Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[2:32:29.800 --> 2:32:32.800]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[2:32:32.800 --> 2:32:35.800]  I already got some. I also got some to fit our passports.
[2:32:35.800 --> 2:32:40.800]  Identity Stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[2:32:40.800 --> 2:32:42.800]  idstronghold.com?
[2:32:42.800 --> 2:33:00.800]  Right. Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[2:33:00.800 --> 2:33:13.800]  Senior CIA Analyst Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr. gave him their morning briefings, highly respected in his field.
[2:33:13.800 --> 2:33:21.800]  We're going to open the phones up here in about 10 minutes, 1-800-259-9231 specifically for Mr. McGovern.
[2:33:21.800 --> 2:33:24.800]  You can put your questions to him.
[2:33:24.800 --> 2:33:30.800]  We've got several subjects here that we're going to be discussing.
[2:33:30.800 --> 2:33:36.800]  Mr. McGovern, right now, I remember a few months ago, people were saying on the inside they're going to attack Iran.
[2:33:36.800 --> 2:33:41.800]  They're discredited. Iran doesn't have weapons. They're five, six years away from it.
[2:33:41.800 --> 2:33:47.800]  Israel has hundreds of nukes, but they just don't care. They're going forward with it.
[2:33:47.800 --> 2:33:55.800]  I mean, looking at this now, do you think they are intending to go ahead and hit them, whether the hair ellipse the admiral?
[2:33:55.800 --> 2:34:01.800]  Just as you said, in September or so, is a springboard for McCain?
[2:34:01.800 --> 2:34:11.800]  Well, all set to do it, Alex. All they need is the execute order, hopefully from Bush, but it probably will come from Cheney, through Gates,
[2:34:11.800 --> 2:34:18.800]  through the Joint Chiefs, and then out to the combatant commanders. It'll be different from Iraq.
[2:34:18.800 --> 2:34:27.800]  There'll be mostly air involved, Air Force. Those folks who live out in those spaces where those stealth bombers take off from,
[2:34:27.800 --> 2:34:34.800]  keep a lookout and let us know if you see them leave their bases one night, because that's what we'll start this thing.
[2:34:34.800 --> 2:34:43.800]  So they're all set to go. The question is whether the Uniform Service generals can do what they've been doing,
[2:34:43.800 --> 2:34:49.800]  and I'd say, well, Mr. President, let us talk to you about this. We wish we had done this before Iraq,
[2:34:49.800 --> 2:34:57.800]  but this time we just want to make sure that you know what's going to happen on day three and on week two,
[2:34:57.800 --> 2:35:02.800]  and what the Iranians are capable of, and whether you really want to do this, Mr. President.
[2:35:02.800 --> 2:35:09.800]  Now, I've been thinking for a long time that that is the only deterrent to this kind of thing for several months.
[2:35:09.800 --> 2:35:18.800]  Sy Hershey's article in The New Yorker, Thomas Powers' article in the New York Review of Books, everybody's pretty much got a good deed on this now.
[2:35:18.800 --> 2:35:27.800]  Dana Priest in the Washington Post a year and a half ago said there could be a mutiny among the Uniformed Offices.
[2:35:27.800 --> 2:35:33.800]  Now, they've said that if Iran fights back in any way, that is called terrorism.
[2:35:33.800 --> 2:35:42.800]  Now, Iran has laid down while special ops and Wahhabi al-Qaeda forces have been attacking, blowing up mosques, shooting up police schools for years,
[2:35:42.800 --> 2:35:47.800]  and now the president's openly announcing a $400 million escalation.
[2:35:47.800 --> 2:35:51.800]  The Iranians are suing the United States for staging terror attacks.
[2:35:51.800 --> 2:36:00.800]  How can the White House be staging al-Qaeda attacks while saying that Iran is al-Qaeda when there's Shi'ite?
[2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:07.800]  Well, Alex, how can the White House square any number of circles?
[2:36:07.800 --> 2:36:14.800]  The answer is that the, what I call the faulning corporate media let them get away with it.
[2:36:14.800 --> 2:36:19.800]  And so the American people, busy as they are with two jobs, putting bread on the table,
[2:36:19.800 --> 2:36:23.800]  and I just don't have time or opportunity to learn the truth.
[2:36:23.800 --> 2:36:29.800]  So McCain can follow up and talk about al-Qaeda when he means the Shi'as and all that kind of stuff.
[2:36:29.800 --> 2:36:37.800]  It doesn't really matter because what they get is a steady diet of support for the administration from places like Fox News.
[2:36:37.800 --> 2:36:42.800]  Well, as you said last week, Iran has been extremely restrained.
[2:36:42.800 --> 2:36:45.800]  Imagine if the U.S. was really being attacked by a foreign power.
[2:36:45.800 --> 2:36:52.800]  Foreign power announces, we got special forces in your country trying to goad them, trying to make it be a political crisis in Iran.
[2:36:52.800 --> 2:36:56.800]  Their people are saying, why aren't you doing something?
[2:36:56.800 --> 2:36:58.800]  All of this is happening.
[2:36:58.800 --> 2:37:02.800]  I mean, what do you and what do other analysts see Iran doing?
[2:37:02.800 --> 2:37:08.800]  I mean, even if Iran does nothing, Bloomberg and other analysts are reporting 5000-announce gold.
[2:37:08.800 --> 2:37:11.800]  Ron Paul is saying a tripling in oil overnight.
[2:37:11.800 --> 2:37:14.800]  We're talking $12, $14 a gallon.
[2:37:14.800 --> 2:37:17.800]  I mean, this is going to be our ruination.
[2:37:17.800 --> 2:37:23.800]  Well, it would cause a worldwide recession, at least in perhaps depression.
[2:37:23.800 --> 2:37:38.800]  What the Iranians are looking at are a bunch of feckless operators who have recruited the dregs among the minorities that populate the outlying areas of Iran.
[2:37:38.800 --> 2:37:46.800]  These are pinpricks. They're not going to make any difference other than to make the Iranian people more steadfast in resisting this kind of thing.
[2:37:46.800 --> 2:37:49.800]  The Iranians, of course, have a long history with the U.S.
[2:37:49.800 --> 2:37:56.800]  Going back to 53 when we removed their duly elected prime minister, Mosaddegh,
[2:37:56.800 --> 2:38:04.800]  because he made that terrible mistake of thinking that the oil under Iranian sands belonged to Iran.
[2:38:04.800 --> 2:38:08.800]  He thought that the oil in Iran belonged to the Iranians.
[2:38:08.800 --> 2:38:14.800]  And it didn't matter if he was anti-communist and anti-Islamic extremist and trained in the West,
[2:38:14.800 --> 2:38:22.800]  he wouldn't give BP all the oil, so Anglo-American oil, so he had to be overthrown by Kermit Roosevelt.
[2:38:22.800 --> 2:38:24.800]  Sure, and they remember that.
[2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:34.800]  They also remember that the U.S. supported Fatima Hussein when Hussein started a nine-year war against the Iranians.
[2:38:34.800 --> 2:38:44.800]  Do you know that the Iranians lost more people in that war than the U.S. lost in the combination of World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and Vietnam?
[2:38:44.800 --> 2:38:46.800]  It's over a million, isn't it, sir?
[2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:50.800]  Yeah, and so they have this history with the United States.
[2:38:50.800 --> 2:38:58.800]  And to expect them to regard us with favor, given what we continue to do, is a pipe dream.
[2:38:58.800 --> 2:39:02.800]  Also, didn't our government help train, the British helped train Savak,
[2:39:02.800 --> 2:39:06.800]  who admittedly tortured to death and killed over 200,000 people?
[2:39:06.800 --> 2:39:14.800]  Well, that was a real... Savak was the Shah's secret police, trained mostly by the British and the Israelis, actually,
[2:39:14.800 --> 2:39:17.800]  particularly in the torture techniques.
[2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:20.800]  And, you know, this is something that's worth mentioning.
[2:39:20.800 --> 2:39:26.800]  You know, when Khomeini came in, people were thinking, oh, wasn't he awful? Wasn't he smart?
[2:39:26.800 --> 2:39:32.800]  He had these little cassettes, you know, that make cassettes in Paris of his sermons, and that's what made the revolution.
[2:39:32.800 --> 2:39:36.800]  You know what made the revolution, Alex? Torture made the revolution.
[2:39:36.800 --> 2:39:43.800]  Everybody and his brother had an uncle or a brother or somebody that they knew who had been tortured by Savak.
[2:39:43.800 --> 2:39:48.800]  And as soon as the balloon went up, they all congregated and got that army the hell out of there.
[2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:57.800]  Khomeini came in, reaped the whirlwind, but it was torture to turn those people into a revolutionary mass.
[2:39:57.800 --> 2:40:02.800]  So how dare the Iranians not love us after all we've done to them?
[2:40:02.800 --> 2:40:10.800]  Well, I think that, you know, they hate us so much that I think they may be miscalculating here,
[2:40:10.800 --> 2:40:19.800]  because, you know, there are things that Ahmadinejad and others could avoid saying that would put them in a better situation diplomatically.
[2:40:19.800 --> 2:40:28.800]  And I dare say that they may be miscalculating because, like everyone else, they realize what a disaster it will be for the United States.
[2:40:28.800 --> 2:40:34.800]  Ergo, Cheney and Bush will not do it. Bad Ergo, huh?
[2:40:34.800 --> 2:40:37.800]  They did the same thing with respect to Iraq.
[2:40:37.800 --> 2:40:44.800]  But the betting is that someone will tell Bush what a disaster this will be and he won't do it.
[2:40:44.800 --> 2:40:48.800]  Well, you know, Bush is not told anything that Cheney doesn't want to tell him.
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:51.800]  Bush doesn't read the newspapers. He admits that.
[2:40:51.800 --> 2:40:54.800]  Well, Bush also says he believes in order out of chaos.
[2:40:54.800 --> 2:40:58.800]  He said it, and he thinks if he gets us in a big enough war, we'll gut up and have to win it.
[2:40:58.800 --> 2:41:05.800]  But now, since you bring that up, did you read the letter from one of the counsel and farm relations?
[2:41:05.800 --> 2:41:12.800]  Well, he's the head of the Heart Rubin Commission, Gary Hart, where he published it in the Huffington Post and we interviewed him.
[2:41:12.800 --> 2:41:19.800]  We are changed talk to him and he said, yes, I'm saying in that letter, our government may stage terror events as a pretext.
[2:41:19.800 --> 2:41:23.800]  And he tells Iran in the letter, he says, you better do what we say.
[2:41:23.800 --> 2:41:27.800]  Don't you think because 80% of the American people don't want to attack you, we won't?
[2:41:27.800 --> 2:41:31.800]  Our government will stage events to come in.
[2:41:31.800 --> 2:41:33.800]  What do you think he meant by that?
[2:41:33.800 --> 2:41:38.800]  Well, you know, this dovetails with what Sy Hirsch says in his article in The New Yorker.
[2:41:38.800 --> 2:41:48.800]  He talks about a meeting that Cheney ran, and the whole subject of the meeting was how to stage a phony incident so that it could be used to start a war.
[2:41:48.800 --> 2:41:49.800]  Say that again.
[2:41:49.800 --> 2:41:56.800]  How to stage an incident that could be used as a costus belly, a reason for war.
[2:41:56.800 --> 2:41:58.800]  And who was saying that?
[2:41:58.800 --> 2:42:04.800]  This is Sy Hirsch quoting a high level former intelligence official.
[2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:10.800]  See, that's something I haven't seen, but then we have the White House memo where Bush is talking to Blair about staging events.
[2:42:10.800 --> 2:42:16.800]  You know, it's one of the things they were contemplating before Iraq.
[2:42:16.800 --> 2:42:21.800]  They may do it. They may not. They may succeed in doing it. They may not.
[2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:28.800]  But this whole business in the Gulf is very volatile because we've got more ships in there than you can shake a stick at.
[2:42:28.800 --> 2:42:36.800]  And of course the Iranians have hundreds of these little boats that can shoot a rocket and sink the ship with no problem at all.
[2:42:36.800 --> 2:42:46.800]  So, you know, if the Iranians were smart, they would number all their little boats and ships and give a listing to the U.S. Navy
[2:42:46.800 --> 2:42:54.800]  and say, now, if you find a number that doesn't appear on this list, be aware because this might be what we call a false flag thing
[2:42:54.800 --> 2:42:57.800]  and see if those people are speaking Hebrew.
[2:42:57.800 --> 2:43:02.800]  Good God. Let's get through a few other subjects here speaking of that.
[2:43:02.800 --> 2:43:12.800]  As we know, our own Army's report came out the day before 9-11 and said, Israel is capable of staging false flags and blaming it on countries to get us into wars.
[2:43:12.800 --> 2:43:21.800]  We have Israel's harassers and posts admitting Israel has fake, quote, al-Qaeda groups staging terror events to always snap through the peace process.
[2:43:21.800 --> 2:43:28.800]  We have all of this going on. We have all the suspicions and questions you've had about 9-11.
[2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:34.800]  Do you think that we're in greater danger than ever of some type of staged event?
[2:43:34.800 --> 2:43:40.800]  Well, I think that's the way. If there's to be an attack on Iran, I think that's the way it will start.
[2:43:40.800 --> 2:43:52.800]  There will have to be some sort of a staged provocation, and as I tried to say a little while ago, it's eminently easy to do in the Gulf or elsewhere.
[2:43:52.800 --> 2:43:59.800]  The only problem is that it has to be big enough so that the Iranians will feel compelled to retaliate.
[2:43:59.800 --> 2:44:03.800]  Iranians are smarter than anyone thinks.
[2:44:03.800 --> 2:44:14.800]  They can take these pinpricks and they can take these little assaults and there's some real question as to whether the Iranians will rise to the occasion.
[2:44:14.800 --> 2:44:23.800]  So what I see happening is a provocation, and then the Israelis take off and they do what they did to Osirak back in 1981.
[2:44:23.800 --> 2:44:28.800]  We give them all the satellite photography, all the means of ingress and egress.
[2:44:28.800 --> 2:44:33.800]  They bomb the hell out of some of the Iranian nuclear facilities.
[2:44:33.800 --> 2:44:41.800]  And then as night follows the day, the Iranians will be required to retaliate, and we will jump in with both feet.
[2:44:41.800 --> 2:44:46.800]  That is, the United States will have a major regional war there.
[2:44:46.800 --> 2:44:56.800]  We will try to bomb as many sites as we can with the thought that we can avoid a wider war just by doing this all from the air,
[2:44:56.800 --> 2:45:03.800]  put back the nuclear program five or ten years, and then Bushel and Cheney will slap each other in the back and say,
[2:45:03.800 --> 2:45:07.800]  well, we promised to Olmert and before him, sure, that we'd do it.
[2:45:07.800 --> 2:45:10.800]  We've finally done it. Let's go off into the sunset.
[2:45:10.800 --> 2:45:21.800]  But there's no doubt, according to every analyst, financial, military intelligence, that this will cause energy prices to at least double again, maybe triple.
[2:45:21.800 --> 2:45:30.800]  And that will sink the dollar, sink the economy, and a lot of you neocon listeners out there, you're talking about potential homelessness.
[2:45:30.800 --> 2:45:33.800]  I mean, it's just, it's insane.
[2:45:33.800 --> 2:45:36.800]  Yeah, and maybe a reason will prevail.
[2:45:36.800 --> 2:45:42.800]  Maybe someone will get to Bush and say, look, you know, Dick Cheney is away tonight,
[2:45:42.800 --> 2:45:45.800]  but we'd really like to talk to you about what's really going to happen if you do this.
[2:45:45.800 --> 2:45:55.800]  So there is some hope that it can be avoided, but right now they look like they're on that course and with the help of the media and the aiding and abetting by Congress
[2:45:55.800 --> 2:46:00.800]  suggesting things that Olmert originally suggested, the blockade, for example.
[2:46:00.800 --> 2:46:08.800]  These things are very disquieting, and unless, as you know, Alex, I think impeachment is the answer here.
[2:46:08.800 --> 2:46:17.800]  If John Conyers got off his rear end and started impeachment proceedings, then our uniform military would have the kind of encouragement to say,
[2:46:17.800 --> 2:46:22.800]  wait a second now, this isn't about danger to us or even Israel.
[2:46:22.800 --> 2:46:25.800]  This is something that the president is going to have cocked about.
[2:46:25.800 --> 2:46:27.800]  Well, that's my next point.
[2:46:27.800 --> 2:46:36.800]  That's my next point is that Bush says that Congress can't see PDD 51, but the cover sheet says it basically makes him a dictator.
[2:46:36.800 --> 2:46:42.800]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act says he's over the governor's the military for insurrection.
[2:46:42.800 --> 2:46:44.800]  And then now I've talked to state police and others.
[2:46:44.800 --> 2:46:48.800]  They're being told now and given manuals and we've seen them that get ready.
[2:46:48.800 --> 2:46:50.800]  The president's going to be your leader.
[2:46:50.800 --> 2:46:51.800]  You owe allegiance to him.
[2:46:51.800 --> 2:46:55.800]  I mean, there's definitely even some darker things going on here.
[2:46:55.800 --> 2:47:06.800]  That's the subject of great concern.
[2:47:06.800 --> 2:47:14.800]  I was an army officer and it was drummed into us that we had to not only swear allegiance to the Constitution, but to act by it.
[2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:21.800]  And for the president to use the army and domestic law enforcement capacity was verboten by law.
[2:47:21.800 --> 2:47:36.800]  It still is, as far as I know, the Pasekomi Tapas Act and actually one of the articles of impeachment that Dennis Kucinich has raised against the president is precisely because he's tried to violate that act.
[2:47:36.800 --> 2:47:50.800]  So I think when push comes to shove, I hope anyway, that the Uniform Military and perhaps even the governors who are supposed to have some sort of rule over the state police and the National Guard and that kind of thing,
[2:47:50.800 --> 2:47:55.800]  will be able to force these clear attempts to...
[2:47:55.800 --> 2:47:56.800]  Well, I agree.
[2:47:56.800 --> 2:48:03.800]  I think the bottom line here is that the country has a case of cancer, but we may be able to whip it.
[2:48:03.800 --> 2:48:11.800]  The problem is that this corrupt elite is in power, but the good news is they are being discredited.
[2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:13.800]  They are getting in a lot of trouble.
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:17.800]  They are running out of steam, but I think they're more dangerous than ever.
[2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:27.800]  You know, during this last gasp, but there's no doubt, and would you agree, Reverend Governor, that we are at one of the most dangerous points in American history?
[2:48:27.800 --> 2:48:31.800]  Well, I've been around for 45 years in this town, and I've not seen the likes of it.
[2:48:31.800 --> 2:48:35.800]  Not Watergate, not Vietnam, not Iran-Contra.
[2:48:35.800 --> 2:48:48.800]  Nothing like it, because the usual forces, Congress first and foremost, that discharge their constitutional obligations in all these other cases, they're not billing it now,
[2:48:48.800 --> 2:48:55.800]  both because of fear, both because of trying to make sure they win big in November,
[2:48:55.800 --> 2:49:02.800]  and also because of the Israel lobby, which is playing a very, very determinative role in all this.
[2:49:02.800 --> 2:49:05.800]  Well, let's just call a spade a spade.
[2:49:05.800 --> 2:49:08.800]  Most people in Congress know 9-11 isn't what they were told.
[2:49:08.800 --> 2:49:16.800]  They know this is a deadly, dangerous elite in power right now, and most of them that aren't on the payroll, like you said, are scared.
[2:49:16.800 --> 2:49:20.800]  I mean, I talk to people in power all the time, and people are scared.
[2:49:20.800 --> 2:49:26.800]  They know, and the public better realize that we are on the razor's edge here, folks.
[2:49:26.800 --> 2:49:36.800]  I mean, this is the difference between our name destroyed, our currency destroyed, and a bunch of nuts running things versus some type of Hitlerian reign of terror,
[2:49:36.800 --> 2:49:41.800]  and we're very close to that, and now is the time to get the word out like never before.
[2:49:41.800 --> 2:49:43.800]  We're going to come back and get into torture.
[2:49:43.800 --> 2:49:50.800]  You were talking to me during a break about, and we're going to keep talking through this break with folks behind the scenes watching, about torture.
[2:49:50.800 --> 2:49:56.800]  John, you testifying, just, I watched some of it, very arrogant, very proud of himself.
[2:49:56.800 --> 2:50:06.800]  Yeah, you know, I hate to quote Shakespeare on lawyers, you know, but it wasn't a real bad idea that he had, you know.
[2:50:06.800 --> 2:50:08.800]  First, give it of all, lawyers.
[2:50:08.800 --> 2:50:17.800]  What I watched there was just an unconscionable performance, and what they missed is the most obvious, and I guess many lawyers do that.
[2:50:17.800 --> 2:50:26.800]  They talk about John Yoo and David Addington preparing these torture memoranda, but, you know, lawyers give advice, you know.
[2:50:26.800 --> 2:50:33.800]  Lawyers don't implement things. Lawyers don't give orders. Who gives orders? The desire.
[2:50:33.800 --> 2:50:37.800]  And that's what we have here. And do we have a smoking gun?
[2:50:37.800 --> 2:50:45.800]  Well, the nation needs to know that, yes, indeed, we do have a smoking gun. It's dated February 7th.
[2:50:45.800 --> 2:50:47.800]  Tell you what, stay there. We're on top behind the scenes, but come back.
[2:50:47.800 --> 2:50:51.800]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:50:51.800 --> 2:50:56.800]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:50:56.800 --> 2:51:02.800]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:51:02.800 --> 2:51:13.800]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:51:13.800 --> 2:51:21.800]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:51:21.800 --> 2:51:25.800]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:51:25.800 --> 2:51:28.800]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:51:28.800 --> 2:51:32.800]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[2:52:21.800 --> 2:52:27.800]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[2:52:27.800 --> 2:52:32.800]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[2:54:11.800 --> 2:54:16.800]  We mean business. We're dark. We're scary. We are the bad guys. Dick Cheney brags about the dark side.
[2:54:16.800 --> 2:54:24.800]  These guys are into darkness, but he brought up how Bush likes to blow living frogs up and torture animals and shoot his siblings.
[2:54:24.800 --> 2:54:31.800]  But then when he was 21, he wanted to brand pledges. Absolutely, you can just look at Bush.
[2:54:31.800 --> 2:54:38.800]  I don't usually judge a book by its cover, but if I saw that guy in a suit and tie walking down the dark road, he's scary looking.
[2:54:38.800 --> 2:54:41.800]  That little demon face he makes, do we have no discernment?
[2:54:41.800 --> 2:54:45.800]  Ray McGovern is a CIA analyst looking at him, just looking at the mannerisms.
[2:54:45.800 --> 2:54:51.800]  He has, maybe, one in a thousand have that just criminal psycho look. Ray McGovern.
[2:54:51.800 --> 2:55:01.800]  Well, Alex, we used to do in the analytic part of the agency what we called added distance psychological assessments.
[2:55:01.800 --> 2:55:05.800]  We had psychologists and psychiatrists doing this with us.
[2:55:05.800 --> 2:55:13.800]  And Justin Frank, who has written that wonderful book, Bush on the Couch, is cooperating with us even now as we speak.
[2:55:13.800 --> 2:55:19.800]  And we're going to draft a new memorandum to comment on what makes Bush tick from a psychological point of view.
[2:55:19.800 --> 2:55:23.800]  Because I think that's equally important to any other aspect here.
[2:55:23.800 --> 2:55:29.800]  You can talk with geopolitics, but you have to look at the man and the kinds of things you were just mentioning.
[2:55:29.800 --> 2:55:36.800]  Let me just finish up. When he was 21 at Yale, okay, and this is the New York Times reporting this, okay?
[2:55:36.800 --> 2:55:44.800]  When he was 21, his job was to haze or to get the pledges into his fraternity or reject them.
[2:55:44.800 --> 2:55:53.800]  He used to take a wire hanger, okay, put it over an open fire, and sort of brand them on their buttocks, okay?
[2:55:53.800 --> 2:55:58.800]  Now, one of the pledges didn't much like this, and he found out who George W. Bush was.
[2:55:58.800 --> 2:56:02.800]  His dad was a big shot. He was at the U.N., I think, at the time.
[2:56:02.800 --> 2:56:08.800]  And so he called the New York Times, and he said, you know, you really ought to know this. This is psychopathic.
[2:56:08.800 --> 2:56:14.800]  The Times called George W. Bush and said, is this right? Is that what you're doing?
[2:56:14.800 --> 2:56:16.800]  And you know what George W. Bush said?
[2:56:16.800 --> 2:56:23.800]  Well, yeah, but you know, the scars are nothing worse than cigarette burns.
[2:56:23.800 --> 2:56:26.800]  Nothing worse than cigarette burns.
[2:56:26.800 --> 2:56:28.800]  Total Disconnection Reality.
[2:56:28.800 --> 2:56:36.800]  Now, Colleen Rowley, the FBI agent who made quite a name for herself by blowing the whistle on FBI ineptitude on 9-11,
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:42.800]  she's one of our veteran intelligence professionals for Saturday, and she said, Ray, you know,
[2:56:42.800 --> 2:56:48.800]  if any of those things, the blowing up the frogs, the shooting your siblings with BB guns,
[2:56:48.800 --> 2:56:55.800]  the branding of pledges with white hot coat hangers, if any of those came to our attention
[2:56:55.800 --> 2:56:59.800]  in the resume of somebody applying for employment with the FBI,
[2:56:59.800 --> 2:57:06.800]  which are right into the circular file, because those people are pre-programmed to criminal activity later in life.
[2:57:06.800 --> 2:57:07.800]  Jeffrey Dahmer.
[2:57:07.800 --> 2:57:09.800]  Yeah. Yeah, it's the same kind of thing.
[2:57:09.800 --> 2:57:16.800]  So these things are very important, and I hope that we'll be able to get something even more telling than we did.
[2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:22.800]  Well, everybody knows that people that like to hurt animals are going to turn into psychopaths or criminals.
[2:57:22.800 --> 2:57:24.800]  I mean, that's just a, I mean, 101.
[2:57:24.800 --> 2:57:34.800]  So we had these people recruited, these lawyers, and we saw them in action last week
[2:57:34.800 --> 2:57:40.800]  when they testified before the, or dissimulated before the John Conyers Commission.
[2:57:40.800 --> 2:57:45.800]  You know, as they looked at them, and I said, well, there you go. That's the full circle.
[2:57:45.800 --> 2:57:47.800]  These are the mafia lawyers.
[2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:50.800]  And they said, they said Bush is the law.
[2:57:50.800 --> 2:57:55.800]  Sure. Now, Alex, I'm from the Bronx, you know, we know about the mafia.
[2:57:55.800 --> 2:57:58.800]  I also lived in New Jersey, and we know about the mafia there, too.
[2:57:58.800 --> 2:58:06.800]  And I'm reminded of what General Tuguba, you know, the only one that did a decent investigation of Abu Ghraib.
[2:58:06.800 --> 2:58:09.800]  I'm reminded of what he told Sy Hirsch.
[2:58:09.800 --> 2:58:14.800]  After the investigation was completed, and he actually did an honest one,
[2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:19.800]  he finds himself in the back of a Mercedes with General Abidzid in Kuwait.
[2:58:19.800 --> 2:58:22.800]  Stay there. We'll be back in one minute with Ray McGovern.
[2:58:22.800 --> 2:58:50.800]  I'm just an amazing interview. We'll be right back.

[2:59:34.800 --> 2:59:48.800]  Join the info war today.
[3:00:25.800 --> 3:00:28.800]  The report has been leaked, okay?
[3:00:28.800 --> 3:00:34.800]  Obviously, I mean, I'm sorry, Tuguba did an honest job, and it was a very damning report.
[3:00:34.800 --> 3:00:39.800]  So his chief, the head of CENTCOM, turns to Tuguba and says,
[3:00:39.800 --> 3:00:47.800]  I just want to let you know, General Tuguba, that you and your report are being investigated.
[3:00:47.800 --> 3:00:49.800]  And Tuguba looks at him.
[3:00:49.800 --> 3:00:52.800]  Anybody says to Sai Hirsch who's interviewing him?
[3:00:52.800 --> 3:00:56.800]  He said, you know, Sai, I'd been in the Army 32 years by then.
[3:00:56.800 --> 3:01:00.800]  And it was the first time that I thought I was in the mafia.
[3:01:00.800 --> 3:01:02.800]  Absolutely he is, God.
[3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:07.800]  Now, if you looked at those lawyers last week, John Yoo and David Attink.
[3:01:07.800 --> 3:01:09.800]  The body language was mafia.
[3:01:09.800 --> 3:01:11.800]  Those are the mafia lawyers.
[3:01:11.800 --> 3:01:16.800]  The important point, and this is really important, and this is always missed by people,
[3:01:16.800 --> 3:01:18.800]  is that we have a smoking gun.
[3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:25.800]  There was one memorandum signed by the President of the United States on February 7, 2002.
[3:01:25.800 --> 3:01:26.800]  It's on the web.
[3:01:26.800 --> 3:01:28.800]  You can download it in PDF form.
[3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:34.800]  You can see the President's signature, which is two inches big with a felt pen.
[3:01:34.800 --> 3:01:37.800]  And this was the authorization to torture.
[3:01:37.800 --> 3:01:38.800]  What did it say?
[3:01:38.800 --> 3:01:44.800]  It said that we're going to exempt the Taliban and al-Qaeda from Geneva protections,
[3:01:44.800 --> 3:01:50.800]  and we will treat them, quote, humanely, comma, as appropriate, comma,
[3:01:50.800 --> 3:01:54.800]  and as consistent with military necessity, period, end quote.
[3:01:54.800 --> 3:01:56.800]  That's not what Geneva says.
[3:01:56.800 --> 3:02:01.800]  That was the loophole to which Don Rumsfeld and George Tenet, the head of the CIA,
[3:02:01.800 --> 3:02:05.800]  drove the Mack Truck of Torture, February 2002.
[3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:08.800]  What's happening with these memos on torture?
[3:02:08.800 --> 3:02:12.800]  Well, those are the smart little mafia lawyers making it all legal, okay?
[3:02:12.800 --> 3:02:14.800]  So you don't proceed against the lawyers.
[3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:16.800]  You proceed against the decider.
[3:02:16.800 --> 3:02:21.800]  And the decider decided, and you have it in black and white, over his signature.
[3:02:21.800 --> 3:02:25.800]  I don't know what's keeping John Conyers and other people for saying,
[3:02:25.800 --> 3:02:28.800]  look, you authorized this Mr. President.
[3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:29.800]  It's torture.
[3:02:29.800 --> 3:02:31.800]  It not only violates international law.
[3:02:31.800 --> 3:02:37.800]  It violates the U.S. War Crimes Act of 1996, passed by a Republican-dominated legislature
[3:02:37.800 --> 3:02:39.800]  in this country.
[3:02:39.800 --> 3:02:40.800]  Go directly to jail.
[3:02:40.800 --> 3:02:42.800]  Do not pay $200.
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:45.800]  Well, Ray McGovern, I've looked at who they've got.
[3:02:45.800 --> 3:02:46.800]  You've looked who they've got.
[3:02:46.800 --> 3:02:51.800]  I even have the section chief who wrote the book, What Job Breaker About It, admitting
[3:02:51.800 --> 3:02:54.800]  that they were told, don't grab real people.
[3:02:54.800 --> 3:02:55.800]  That's politically dangerous.
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:02:56.800]  They'll try to kill us.
[3:02:56.800 --> 3:02:58.800]  Just go grab some sheep herders.
[3:02:58.800 --> 3:03:04.800]  They'd pay actual al-Qaeda, actual Taliban, upwards of $25,000 for 12-year-old kids,
[3:03:04.800 --> 3:03:07.800]  and then they'd just take them in and beat them to death.
[3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:08.800]  Rape them.
[3:03:08.800 --> 3:03:11.800]  They'd hire jail guards that had bad records.
[3:03:11.800 --> 3:03:13.800]  I mean, this is a sick joke.
[3:03:13.800 --> 3:03:20.800]  I mean, it'd be bad enough torturing real al-Qaeda, but they knowingly are torturing little kids.
[3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:23.800]  Yeah, that's the worst of it.
[3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:28.800]  The young boys who have grown up in Guantanamo, can you believe it?
[3:03:28.800 --> 3:03:32.800]  Yeah, what we need to do is get these things front and center.
[3:03:32.800 --> 3:03:39.800]  And I applaud Dennis Kucinich for standing up there for more than four hours, a couple weeks ago,
[3:03:39.800 --> 3:03:45.800]  and reading 35, 35 articles of impeachment against this president.
[3:03:45.800 --> 3:03:49.800]  Now, as you probably remember, Nixon went down with just three.
[3:03:49.800 --> 3:03:55.800]  Three were voted out of the judiciary committee in 1974, and he quit the next week.
[3:03:55.800 --> 3:03:57.800]  You don't need 35, but all 35.
[3:03:57.800 --> 3:04:03.800]  Any one of those things would be enough to impeach this president, and yet John Conyers, you know,
[3:04:03.800 --> 3:04:05.800]  may be Alex, just may be.
[3:04:05.800 --> 3:04:14.800]  This wiretapping, you know, this unauthorized eavesdropping, just may be they're doing a J. Edgar Hoover on these people.
[3:04:14.800 --> 3:04:19.800]  Maybe they've got stuff on Conyers, maybe they've got stuff on Pelosi and the others.
[3:04:19.800 --> 3:04:21.800]  Well, we know the British are doing that.
[3:04:21.800 --> 3:04:26.800]  It's come out that MI6 and 5 are spying on the whole parliament illegally.
[3:04:26.800 --> 3:04:32.800]  There must be some explanation as to why John Conyers has all of a sudden lost his backbone.
[3:04:32.800 --> 3:04:39.800]  We're going to keep talking during this break and come back and take a few final phone calls with Ray McGovern. Stay with us.
[3:05:14.800 --> 3:05:21.800]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[3:05:21.800 --> 3:05:33.800]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future. Call 800-409-5633.

[3:07:10.800 --> 3:07:16.800]  7 years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:07:16.800 --> 3:07:23.800]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:07:23.800 --> 3:07:27.800]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:07:27.800 --> 3:07:35.800]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue, and if the government has not told the truth in 5 years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9...
[3:07:35.800 --> 3:07:41.800]  Truth rising. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:07:41.800 --> 3:07:44.800]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[3:07:44.800 --> 3:07:47.800]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[3:07:47.800 --> 3:08:08.800]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:08.800 --> 3:08:15.800]  Well, the Congress is saying you can devalue the dollar, you can attack innocent countries, you can torture people,
[3:08:15.800 --> 3:08:18.800]  you can get rid of the 4th Amendment, the 5th Amendment, the 1st Amendment.
[3:08:18.800 --> 3:08:20.800]  Well, where do they stop then?
[3:08:20.800 --> 3:08:26.800]  You see, when you just say to an executive that you have a blank check, where and when do they stop?
[3:08:26.800 --> 3:08:34.800]  I mean, I guess in the final equation, Ray McGovern, and we'll take two final calls here, that's what it boils down to.
[3:08:34.800 --> 3:08:44.800]  And then I guess if we even make it to another election, the Democrats are acting like they intend to continue, I guess, Apex Directive.
[3:08:44.800 --> 3:08:50.800]  Well, look that way, and you know, if we didn't have such good material here.
[3:08:50.800 --> 3:09:01.800]  I mentioned not only the 7th February memorandum from the President, but the 25th January 2002 memorandum signed by Alberto Gonzalez,
[3:09:01.800 --> 3:09:06.800]  but drafted by David Eddington, which is really a masterpiece.
[3:09:06.800 --> 3:09:15.800]  Talks about the War Crimes Act of 1996 and how the President might be able to escape the prosecution under that,
[3:09:15.800 --> 3:09:22.800]  should some, and I'm quoting here, it's hard to predict the motives of prosecutors and independent councils
[3:09:22.800 --> 3:09:27.800]  who might in the future decide to pursue charges based on the War Crimes Act.
[3:09:27.800 --> 3:09:33.800]  But if you determine that the Taliban and Al Qaeda are exempt,
[3:09:33.800 --> 3:09:39.800]  this would quote, create a reasonable basis in law that the War Crimes Act does not apply,
[3:09:39.800 --> 3:09:43.800]  and that would provide defense against future prosecution.
[3:09:43.800 --> 3:09:46.800]  But it violates U.S. law, it violates common law, it violates...
[3:09:46.800 --> 3:09:50.800]  Yeah, it sounds like a mafia lawyer to you.
[3:09:50.800 --> 3:09:53.800]  Absolutely, it's just incredible.
[3:09:53.800 --> 3:09:59.800]  Two final calls, Eric in California and then Peggy, Eric you're on the air with Ray McGovern.
[3:09:59.800 --> 3:10:03.800]  Hey, Alex, how you doing? This is Eric in San Diego.
[3:10:03.800 --> 3:10:07.800]  And also a warm welcome to you, Ray.
[3:10:07.800 --> 3:10:12.800]  I sure do appreciate your work and your great work for the call to liberty.
[3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:14.800]  Sure.
[3:10:14.800 --> 3:10:19.800]  Up until last week, late last week, I was a firm believer in writing in Ron Paul,
[3:10:19.800 --> 3:10:22.800]  and I went and saw Chuck Baldwin speak.
[3:10:22.800 --> 3:10:26.800]  Sir, we're taking calls for Ray McGovern.
[3:10:26.800 --> 3:10:29.800]  Is this your torture war? Do you have any comments on it?
[3:10:29.800 --> 3:10:38.800]  Well, my comment is more along the lines of FEMA using Astridus in use of Romans 13.
[3:10:38.800 --> 3:10:41.800]  Okay, let's bring that up to Ray McGovern.
[3:10:41.800 --> 3:10:44.800]  Ray, I'm sure you've heard that it's now come out.
[3:10:44.800 --> 3:10:47.800]  I reported a year and a half before it came out, I got the classified documents.
[3:10:47.800 --> 3:10:50.800]  They have covertly recruited 26,000 preachers, FEMA has,
[3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:55.800]  and have them giving sermons, but they don't tell their flock to turn your guns in,
[3:10:55.800 --> 3:10:58.800]  go to camps, Jesus wants you to.
[3:10:58.800 --> 3:11:01.800]  I mean, is that not creepy?
[3:11:01.800 --> 3:11:06.800]  Actually, Alex, I can't comment on that because I've not been up on that.
[3:11:06.800 --> 3:11:10.800]  Yeah, but I know being in the CIA, you read about other communist countries
[3:11:10.800 --> 3:11:13.800]  and third world nations where they have similar things.
[3:11:13.800 --> 3:11:15.800]  I mean, that's pretty bad.
[3:11:15.800 --> 3:11:18.800]  Unbelievable. Okay, anything else, Eric?
[3:11:18.800 --> 3:11:20.800]  I held him over to take a few calls.
[3:11:20.800 --> 3:11:25.800]  You know, when I brought it up to Chuck during the question-answer session,
[3:11:25.800 --> 3:11:29.800]  he said that he was confronted with that program,
[3:11:29.800 --> 3:11:33.800]  and he went back to his flock, because he has a church in Pensacola, Florida.
[3:11:33.800 --> 3:11:37.800]  He went back to his flock and told his flock to buy weapons.
[3:11:37.800 --> 3:11:39.800]  I remember him talking about that.
[3:11:39.800 --> 3:11:42.800]  I need to get Chuck Baldwin on. He's a great guy, a Constitution party.
[3:11:42.800 --> 3:11:49.800]  Absolutely, and I'm going from writing in Ron Paul to being a firm supporter of Mr. Baldwin.
[3:11:49.800 --> 3:11:51.800]  Okay, good. Thank you, sir.
[3:11:51.800 --> 3:11:54.800]  Peggy in Pennsylvania, and I'm going to let Ray McGovern go. Go ahead.
[3:11:54.800 --> 3:11:56.800]  Mr. McGovern?
[3:11:56.800 --> 3:11:57.800]  Hi, Peggy.
[3:11:57.800 --> 3:12:02.800]  Hi. I think you're absolutely right about the lawyerly mind in the United States today.
[3:12:02.800 --> 3:12:04.800]  I've seen it myself in Ohio.
[3:12:04.800 --> 3:12:09.800]  And don't forget that these people form a network in the highest places in the government
[3:12:09.800 --> 3:12:12.800]  and also with people of like mind in other countries.
[3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:18.800]  But the one fear that every human should have is fear of a retribution or revenge.
[3:12:18.800 --> 3:12:25.800]  It seems to me that I remember Russia stating that if Iran was attacked by Israel or the United States,
[3:12:25.800 --> 3:12:28.800]  Russia would send nuclear missiles back.
[3:12:28.800 --> 3:12:33.800]  Isn't either of these two countries afraid of that?
[3:12:33.800 --> 3:12:39.800]  Well, I'm not familiar with the Russian statement that you put the quote here.
[3:12:39.800 --> 3:12:43.800]  I am. It was there one of their foreign ministers about two months ago just said,
[3:12:43.800 --> 3:12:48.800]  look, we have nuclear weapons and we'll use them, but go ahead.
[3:12:48.800 --> 3:12:51.800]  Yeah. The Russians, I can't quite figure out.
[3:12:51.800 --> 3:12:54.800]  I was on Russian TV last week and I asked the people, you know,
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:12:59.800]  aren't you concerned about what might happen just to south of your border here?
[3:12:59.800 --> 3:13:01.800]  That might end up using mini nukes.
[3:13:01.800 --> 3:13:06.800]  And they smile and say, well, you guys are digging your own grave here.
[3:13:06.800 --> 3:13:11.800]  And besides, we've got all the oil and they're going to make a pile of money on all this.
[3:13:11.800 --> 3:13:13.800]  So they're acting like a bunch of capitalists.
[3:13:13.800 --> 3:13:17.800]  And I don't think even they realize how serious the situation is.
[3:13:17.800 --> 3:13:21.800]  Yeah. I think there's a mass delusion over the public.
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:22.800]  I talked to business people.
[3:13:22.800 --> 3:13:25.800]  I happen to be at a party and there was an oil company owner,
[3:13:25.800 --> 3:13:29.800]  pretty good size, one of the smaller companies, but still big.
[3:13:29.800 --> 3:13:32.800]  And he's like, yeah, I know the dollar's going to the toilet.
[3:13:32.800 --> 3:13:36.800]  I mean, it just seems like we've had it good so long.
[3:13:36.800 --> 3:13:41.800]  People can't understand that we have, it's almost a bulletproof,
[3:13:41.800 --> 3:13:43.800]  like a 14-year-old thinks they're bulletproof.
[3:13:43.800 --> 3:13:44.800]  Yeah.
[3:13:44.800 --> 3:13:45.800]  Yeah.
[3:13:45.800 --> 3:13:48.800]  That's, I think, a good representation of the mindset.
[3:13:48.800 --> 3:13:51.800]  And it's going to be all the worse when the fall comes.
[3:13:51.800 --> 3:13:54.800]  Yeah. I mean, I've seen so many people think they can play in traffic
[3:13:54.800 --> 3:13:55.800]  thinking they're bulletproof folks.
[3:13:55.800 --> 3:13:57.800]  When that semi hits you, you're dead.
[3:13:57.800 --> 3:13:59.800]  Okay. Peggy, thank you so much.
[3:13:59.800 --> 3:14:01.800]  Great question there at the end.
[3:14:01.800 --> 3:14:06.800]  I know you're battling and successfully good prognosis lymphoma cancer on chemo.
[3:14:06.800 --> 3:14:09.800]  It was over an hour and I'd like to have you back on the next month
[3:14:09.800 --> 3:14:10.800]  as new things develop.
[3:14:10.800 --> 3:14:13.800]  You write a lot of columns for what? Counter punch.
[3:14:13.800 --> 3:14:14.800]  And, well, I see your stuff.
[3:14:14.800 --> 3:14:16.800]  Just Google Ray McGovern folks.
[3:14:16.800 --> 3:14:21.800]  And his writings are just all over the place, anti-war.
[3:14:21.800 --> 3:14:24.800]  We link to the stuff on infowars.com.
[3:14:24.800 --> 3:14:28.800]  And anything, any websites you think people should check out, sir?
[3:14:28.800 --> 3:14:32.800]  Well, I normally write first for consortiumnews.com.
[3:14:32.800 --> 3:14:33.800]  Consortium.
[3:14:33.800 --> 3:14:36.800]  So if you want to get it right off the bat, you'll get it there.
[3:14:36.800 --> 3:14:39.800]  Other websites normally pick it up.
[3:14:39.800 --> 3:14:41.800]  Consortiumnews.com.
[3:14:41.800 --> 3:14:43.800]  Well, thank you so much, sir.
[3:14:43.800 --> 3:14:47.800]  And we really appreciate you defending the republic and all of us.
[3:14:47.800 --> 3:14:49.800]  And we know there's a lot of other people with integrity.
[3:14:49.800 --> 3:14:51.800]  Oh, that's a final question.
[3:14:51.800 --> 3:14:54.800]  So many people I talk to in government won't go public.
[3:14:54.800 --> 3:14:56.800]  But so many now have.
[3:14:56.800 --> 3:14:58.800]  Is that the silver lining that we are seeing?
[3:14:58.800 --> 3:15:00.800]  Have Fallon step down?
[3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:02.800]  We are seeing so many big wigs.
[3:15:02.800 --> 3:15:04.800]  Say this is crazy.
[3:15:04.800 --> 3:15:08.800]  I am encouraged on that score.
[3:15:08.800 --> 3:15:09.800]  We need more of that.
[3:15:09.800 --> 3:15:13.800]  And we need to provide protection for these whistleblowers.
[3:15:13.800 --> 3:15:18.800]  But ideally, when this order is given to strike Iran,
[3:15:18.800 --> 3:15:22.800]  somebody's going to go to EPA and tell us a week before
[3:15:22.800 --> 3:15:27.800]  so that we can really rally and try to do what we can to prevent it.
[3:15:27.800 --> 3:15:28.800]  All right.
[3:15:28.800 --> 3:15:29.800]  Thank you.
[3:15:29.800 --> 3:15:32.800]  It's been my pleasure and keep up the good work.
[3:15:32.800 --> 3:15:33.800]  Thank you so much.
[3:15:33.800 --> 3:15:34.800]  Take care, Ray McGovern.
[3:15:34.800 --> 3:15:35.800]  Bye.
[3:15:35.800 --> 3:15:36.800]  Oh, what a great guy.
[3:15:36.800 --> 3:15:38.800]  He is movie sick.
[3:15:38.800 --> 3:15:40.800]  Obviously, taking chemotherapy and the rest of it,
[3:15:40.800 --> 3:15:42.800]  still spending over an hour with us.
[3:15:42.800 --> 3:15:46.800]  Folks, people think they're bulletproof.
[3:15:46.800 --> 3:15:47.800]  People think they're bulletproof.
[3:15:47.800 --> 3:15:49.800]  The general public thinks it.
[3:15:49.800 --> 3:15:57.800]  And that type of positive outlook helps in some ways in life.
[3:15:57.800 --> 3:16:00.800]  But in others, it doesn't help.
[3:16:00.800 --> 3:16:03.800]  In other areas of life, it doesn't help.
[3:16:03.800 --> 3:16:07.800]  And earlier, I read to you out of Bloomberg, I have AP,
[3:16:07.800 --> 3:16:10.800]  all the foreign headlines saying the dollar is plunging.
[3:16:10.800 --> 3:16:13.800]  The world asked the US to stabilize the dollar.
[3:16:13.800 --> 3:16:18.800]  OPEC does not like the prices this high because they're not higher.
[3:16:18.800 --> 3:16:20.800]  It is the dollar.
[3:16:20.800 --> 3:16:21.800]  It's denominated in dollars.
[3:16:21.800 --> 3:16:26.800]  They're saying you want us to stay on dollars where people have got to use dollars to buy
[3:16:26.800 --> 3:16:29.800]  our oil, which keeps the dollar, the world reserve currency.
[3:16:29.800 --> 3:16:32.800]  But now the world reserve currency is devaluing, so it takes more of them.
[3:16:32.800 --> 3:16:34.800]  And that's hurting everybody.
[3:16:34.800 --> 3:16:37.800]  They're saying, why don't we put it in other currencies like the euro?
[3:16:37.800 --> 3:16:40.800]  That's worth 60-some percent more.
[3:16:40.800 --> 3:16:42.800]  And that's not that complex of a thought.
[3:16:42.800 --> 3:16:45.800]  And you tell adults, you tell businessmen, you tell people that.
[3:16:45.800 --> 3:16:48.800]  And they just say, my dollar's fine.
[3:16:48.800 --> 3:16:52.800]  I mean, the pay show is approaching parity with the dollar.
[3:16:52.800 --> 3:16:56.800]  Now, you're going, well, I've seen some price increases, but I haven't seen that many.
[3:16:56.800 --> 3:16:57.800]  That's right.
[3:16:57.800 --> 3:17:01.800]  It hasn't hit here yet, except in commodities like oil.
[3:17:01.800 --> 3:17:06.800]  When it hits, folks, it's going to cascade very fast.
[3:17:06.800 --> 3:17:09.800]  Don't you understand what we're facing here?
[3:17:09.800 --> 3:17:13.800]  I know the listeners do, the general listeners, but I mean, there are new listeners every day.
[3:17:13.800 --> 3:17:19.800]  They're busy laughing at us, threatening us, sending us emails, snickering, snickering on the street.
[3:17:19.800 --> 3:17:21.800]  This isn't funny.
[3:17:21.800 --> 3:17:27.800]  And if I had a dollar for every time I've had a yuppie, smartmouth me or make a YouTube video,
[3:17:27.800 --> 3:17:34.800]  saying the dollar's fine, you're full of crap, you conspiracy theorist, I am not full of anything.
[3:17:34.800 --> 3:17:37.800]  I am telling the truth.
[3:17:37.800 --> 3:17:40.800]  Do we get Luke Radowski in the wings?
[3:17:40.800 --> 3:17:42.800]  Go ahead and get him on.
[3:17:42.800 --> 3:17:43.800]  And this is another issue.
[3:17:43.800 --> 3:17:46.800]  I'm going to go ahead.
[3:17:46.800 --> 3:17:50.800]  I think about all the different facets to this.
[3:17:50.800 --> 3:18:00.800]  And I try to judge and gauge the human condition, the human makeup.
[3:18:00.800 --> 3:18:03.800]  I mean, I have enough trouble trying to gauge my own life.
[3:18:03.800 --> 3:18:04.800]  I just know this.
[3:18:04.800 --> 3:18:06.800]  I'm a good guy.
[3:18:06.800 --> 3:18:11.800]  I mean, I got my faults, but I'm doing this because I genuinely know we're under attack
[3:18:11.800 --> 3:18:13.800]  and we're under a great tyranny.
[3:18:13.800 --> 3:18:17.800]  And things are getting worse very fast.
[3:18:17.800 --> 3:18:23.800]  And I look at our movement and I see great people that rallies on the streets and in the message boards,
[3:18:23.800 --> 3:18:30.800]  but when it gets to our leadership, I really don't see a lot that encourages me.
[3:18:30.800 --> 3:18:33.800]  I mean, there's people like George Butler, little known.
[3:18:33.800 --> 3:18:34.800]  He's a good guy.
[3:18:34.800 --> 3:18:36.800]  Mark Hork, he's a good guy.
[3:18:36.800 --> 3:18:38.800]  Jack McClam's a good guy.
[3:18:38.800 --> 3:18:40.800]  Pastor Butch Paws a good guy.
[3:18:40.800 --> 3:18:44.800]  Ron Paul's a good guy.
[3:18:44.800 --> 3:18:50.800]  Maybe there's another dozen or so people that are prominent, Stan Monteef's good.
[3:18:50.800 --> 3:18:52.800]  People I know that are really good.
[3:18:52.800 --> 3:18:59.800]  And it just freaks me out because I'm like charging the enemy as hard as I can trying to rally and warn on every rooftop.
[3:18:59.800 --> 3:19:02.800]  I'll be exhausted not wanting to do radio interviews.
[3:19:02.800 --> 3:19:07.800]  I'll just go ahead and do them because I know I don't want to turn down warning people.
[3:19:07.800 --> 3:19:09.800]  And I do this out of wanting to warn people.
[3:19:09.800 --> 3:19:12.800]  I'm not driven by the engine of my ego.
[3:19:12.800 --> 3:19:13.800]  I wish I was.
[3:19:13.800 --> 3:19:16.800]  10, 15 years ago I was to a greater extent.
[3:19:16.800 --> 3:19:18.800]  I'm losing my ego.
[3:19:18.800 --> 3:19:27.800]  And I realize that I'm here rushing the enemy in placements and I've got a bunch of people behind me
[3:19:27.800 --> 3:19:30.800]  bitching and griping about me going, oh look, he's a big leader.
[3:19:30.800 --> 3:19:31.800]  He's big and fancy.
[3:19:31.800 --> 3:19:36.800]  We're jealous, making stuff up and making everything about me.
[3:19:36.800 --> 3:19:39.800]  Which only makes me, quote, bigger.
[3:19:39.800 --> 3:19:41.800]  But it hurts the movement.
[3:19:41.800 --> 3:19:44.800]  It's just so frustrating.
[3:19:44.800 --> 3:19:48.800]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[3:19:48.800 --> 3:19:50.800]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[3:19:50.800 --> 3:19:53.800]  Tonight I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[3:19:53.800 --> 3:19:56.800]  And today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[3:19:56.800 --> 3:20:00.800]  Finalized a contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.
[3:20:00.800 --> 3:20:03.800]  Online from my desk with WebEx.
[3:20:03.800 --> 3:20:06.800]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[3:20:06.800 --> 3:20:11.800]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[3:20:11.800 --> 3:20:15.800]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[3:20:15.800 --> 3:20:17.800]  Travel less, meet online.

[3:20:47.800 --> 3:20:52.800]  Last month, Ready Reserve Foods stated that by fall, food would be in short supply
[3:20:52.800 --> 3:20:56.800]  and the government would be forced to impose controls on food and food distribution
[3:20:56.800 --> 3:20:58.800]  because of civil unrest and panic.
[3:20:58.800 --> 3:21:02.800]  Well, the floods in the heartland of America have all but assured this will happen.
[3:21:02.800 --> 3:21:06.800]  It is estimated that five million acres of farmland will not be producing
[3:21:06.800 --> 3:21:09.800]  over 700 million bushels of corn alone.
[3:21:09.800 --> 3:21:13.800]  If you have ever thought about storing food, now is the time to do so.
[3:21:13.800 --> 3:21:19.800]  Paul Ready Reserve Foods at 1-800-453-2202 for a free catalog.
[3:21:19.800 --> 3:21:23.800]  Larry Matlack, president of the American Agriculture Movement, stated on June 6th
[3:21:23.800 --> 3:21:29.800]  that the USDA has only enough wheat stored to make one half of a loaf of bread for every American.

[3:21:35.800 --> 3:21:38.800]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[3:21:39.800 --> 3:21:40.800]  At now.
[3:21:44.800 --> 3:21:48.800]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt,
[3:21:48.800 --> 3:21:53.800]  but the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999,
[3:21:53.800 --> 3:22:01.800]  reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[3:22:01.800 --> 3:22:07.800]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[3:22:07.800 --> 3:22:11.800]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[3:22:11.800 --> 3:22:15.800]  It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce,
[3:22:15.800 --> 3:22:22.800]  however, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[3:22:22.800 --> 3:22:25.800]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[3:22:25.800 --> 3:22:32.800]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[3:22:32.800 --> 3:22:36.800]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[3:22:36.800 --> 3:22:39.800]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[3:22:39.800 --> 3:22:42.800]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[3:22:42.800 --> 3:22:46.800]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[3:22:46.800 --> 3:22:49.800]  9-11 was an inside job.
[3:22:49.800 --> 3:22:52.800]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[3:22:52.800 --> 3:22:55.800]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[3:22:55.800 --> 3:22:59.800]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.
[3:22:59.800 --> 3:23:01.800]  Releasing our channel.
[3:23:01.800 --> 3:23:08.800]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[3:23:08.800 --> 3:23:13.800]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[3:23:13.800 --> 3:23:18.800]  An inside job? How dare you?
[3:23:18.800 --> 3:23:24.800]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:23:24.800 --> 3:23:27.800]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:23:27.800 --> 3:23:33.800]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[3:23:33.800 --> 3:23:39.800]  Truth Rising. Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:23:39.800 --> 3:23:42.800]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[3:23:42.800 --> 3:23:45.800]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[3:23:45.800 --> 3:23:49.800]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:23:49.800 --> 3:23:55.800]  All week in the run-up to the release of Truth Rising on Friday, July 4.
[3:23:55.800 --> 3:24:01.800]  A declaration of independence against the terrorists that carried out the attacks.
[3:24:01.800 --> 3:24:04.800]  I'm going to be having We Are Changed 9-11 Truth.
[3:24:04.800 --> 3:24:07.800]  Everybody in this movement, I want to get 9-11 Blogger on.
[3:24:07.800 --> 3:24:09.800]  I want to get the loose change guys on.
[3:24:09.800 --> 3:24:11.800]  I want to get a whole bunch of people.
[3:24:11.800 --> 3:24:14.800]  Try to think of all the folks we should have on.
[3:24:14.800 --> 3:24:18.800]  But Luke Radowski, first and foremost, with us, and then Stuart Howell.
[3:24:18.800 --> 3:24:20.800]  We are Change LA, coming up in the next segment.
[3:24:20.800 --> 3:24:23.800]  I'm going to get in a bunch of other news I haven't covered.
[3:24:23.800 --> 3:24:25.800]  And recap some other issues.
[3:24:25.800 --> 3:24:28.800]  Luke, you've seen Truth Rising.
[3:24:28.800 --> 3:24:32.800]  I'm asking everybody to make copies of this like they've never made copies before.
[3:24:32.800 --> 3:24:37.800]  We're going to have a DivEx version up on PresidentPlanet.TV for easy, high-quality burn.
[3:24:37.800 --> 3:24:39.800]  Just a regular computer disc.
[3:24:39.800 --> 3:24:41.800]  Most new DVD players have DivEx.
[3:24:41.800 --> 3:24:44.800]  So you can just give it to everybody that way.
[3:24:44.800 --> 3:24:46.800]  It's time to really turn the heat up.
[3:24:46.800 --> 3:24:49.800]  So I'm trying to enlist all the activists to go to the next level
[3:24:49.800 --> 3:24:53.800]  because this film will show people the excitement, show them how to demonstrate,
[3:24:53.800 --> 3:24:55.800]  how to take over media events.
[3:24:55.800 --> 3:25:00.800]  It makes it exciting. It also exposes the first responders not getting treatment.
[3:25:00.800 --> 3:25:02.800]  Tell us what you think of Truth Rising.
[3:25:02.800 --> 3:25:06.800]  Truth Rising is an amazing documentary that pretty much shows it all.
[3:25:06.800 --> 3:25:10.800]  I would ask everybody to get that DVD, burn it on DVD, give it up to everybody.
[3:25:10.800 --> 3:25:15.800]  Show it to everyone you can because this is a mind-blowing documentary
[3:25:15.800 --> 3:25:19.800]  that will really make people understand what's really going on.
[3:25:19.800 --> 3:25:25.800]  Now, it was late one night when we were covering Bilderberg that you guys had a chance to see it.
[3:25:25.800 --> 3:25:27.800]  I mean, break down your view of the film.
[3:25:27.800 --> 3:25:31.800]  The film starts off with the street actions of confrontation.
[3:25:31.800 --> 3:25:36.800]  It goes into great detail with all the first responders who are sick and dying
[3:25:36.800 --> 3:25:39.800]  and all the troubles and all the headaches that they have to go through
[3:25:39.800 --> 3:25:41.800]  getting the proper help that they deserve.
[3:25:41.800 --> 3:25:45.800]  It goes into many celebrities who are speaking out for not allowing Truth.
[3:25:45.800 --> 3:25:49.800]  It's very well put together. It's an amazing documentary
[3:25:49.800 --> 3:25:52.800]  and it's going to blow people's minds away.
[3:25:52.800 --> 3:25:55.800]  Pass it on, make everybody watch it.
[3:25:55.800 --> 3:25:59.800]  Now, I don't know if you heard the show earlier. You probably didn't,
[3:25:59.800 --> 3:26:01.800]  but we have to make an issue out of this.
[3:26:01.800 --> 3:26:03.800]  We need to file a complaint with YouTube.
[3:26:03.800 --> 3:26:09.800]  They act most of the time and they just suspend this person calling for murder's account.
[3:26:09.800 --> 3:26:18.800]  But there is an individual on there called Ariel Silverstein who is calling for...
[3:26:18.800 --> 3:26:25.800]  He'll say he says he'll pay $100,000 per 9-11 Truth or that is murdered with a bullet to the head.
[3:26:25.800 --> 3:26:27.800]  He posted in the We Are Change.
[3:26:27.800 --> 3:26:30.800]  So this is your issue. The We Are Change.
[3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:32.800]  So you are aware of this?
[3:26:32.800 --> 3:26:35.800]  Yeah, that user has sent us many death threats before.
[3:26:35.800 --> 3:26:38.800]  He's been sending us death threats for the last couple of months.
[3:26:38.800 --> 3:26:40.800]  Well, he says he's in. He says he's in.
[3:26:40.800 --> 3:26:42.800]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[3:26:42.800 --> 3:26:44.800]  Yeah, you've been putting it on the comment.
[3:26:44.800 --> 3:26:48.800]  And he's also making fun of my best friend who passed away,
[3:26:48.800 --> 3:26:50.800]  saying a lot of hurtful negative things,
[3:26:50.800 --> 3:26:55.800]  but he's also calling for the death and the murder of basically what...
[3:26:55.800 --> 3:26:57.800]  And he lives there in New York?
[3:26:57.800 --> 3:26:59.800]  I mean, have you called the police about this?
[3:26:59.800 --> 3:27:02.800]  I have not called the police department yet on this, gentlemen.
[3:27:02.800 --> 3:27:06.800]  It is only on YouTube that this man has been leaving his comments,
[3:27:06.800 --> 3:27:08.800]  and I'll probably...
[3:27:08.800 --> 3:27:10.800]  Yeah, but I mean, I found a whole bunch.
[3:27:10.800 --> 3:27:12.800]  He says, kill our children, too.
[3:27:12.800 --> 3:27:14.800]  I mean, this is getting serious.
[3:27:14.800 --> 3:27:17.800]  He says, I will pay $100,000 for each Truth or that's killed,
[3:27:17.800 --> 3:27:19.800]  so get hunting.
[3:27:19.800 --> 3:27:22.800]  It says the only useful thing about this video is it's convenient resource
[3:27:22.800 --> 3:27:27.800]  to identify all the moronic Truth or Schizoids who need bullets planted firmly
[3:27:27.800 --> 3:27:29.800]  in their heads.
[3:27:29.800 --> 3:27:31.800]  I will pay $100,000 per Truth or so.
[3:27:31.800 --> 3:27:33.800]  So get hunting.
[3:27:33.800 --> 3:27:36.800]  Dan has been silenced, maggots have eaten you, Dan.
[3:27:36.800 --> 3:27:38.800]  Ha, ha, ha.
[3:27:38.800 --> 3:27:41.800]  No, no, Dan hasn't been silenced, and you're the maggot,
[3:27:41.800 --> 3:27:44.800]  because this is all being exposed and Dan will live on,
[3:27:44.800 --> 3:27:46.800]  and his voice will live on,
[3:27:46.800 --> 3:27:49.800]  and his father, who died when the government blew up those towers,
[3:27:49.800 --> 3:27:50.800]  the firefighter.
[3:27:50.800 --> 3:27:52.800]  It's just, it's sick, isn't it?
[3:27:52.800 --> 3:27:54.800]  His memory will live on forever.
[3:27:54.800 --> 3:27:57.800]  He's the driving force behind we are a danger.
[3:27:57.800 --> 3:27:58.800]  We'll never forget him.
[3:27:58.800 --> 3:28:01.800]  His message is always going to speak through our hearts,
[3:28:01.800 --> 3:28:03.800]  our message.
[3:28:03.800 --> 3:28:05.800]  And you've always said that, you're not saying that now.
[3:28:05.800 --> 3:28:07.800]  I mean, he may be dead, and his dad may be dead in the towers,
[3:28:07.800 --> 3:28:10.800]  but his voice isn't being stopped.
[3:28:10.800 --> 3:28:12.800]  This little bastard needs to know that.
[3:28:12.800 --> 3:28:14.800]  Yeah, it's definitely not going to be stopped,
[3:28:14.800 --> 3:28:16.800]  because we will continue to fight for what's right,
[3:28:16.800 --> 3:28:18.800]  and we will remember him, we will love him,
[3:28:18.800 --> 3:28:21.800]  and it's sad, and you could see how low and down and dirty
[3:28:21.800 --> 3:28:24.800]  these people will get by disrespecting him,
[3:28:24.800 --> 3:28:26.800]  who, you know, Dan, who's passed away.
[3:28:26.800 --> 3:28:28.800]  He was one of my best friends,
[3:28:28.800 --> 3:28:31.800]  and now even people outside here ground zero,
[3:28:31.800 --> 3:28:34.800]  whenever we do our feed actions, they come and they have,
[3:28:34.800 --> 3:28:36.800]  you know, big signs with, you know,
[3:28:36.800 --> 3:28:38.800]  negative statements about Dan Wallace,
[3:28:38.800 --> 3:28:40.800]  and they hold it up next to us, and they try to antagonize us.
[3:28:40.800 --> 3:28:42.800]  They try to start fights with us, and, you know,
[3:28:42.800 --> 3:28:45.800]  they use the fact that my best friend died,
[3:28:45.800 --> 3:28:47.800]  and a very close member of We Are Changed,
[3:28:47.800 --> 3:28:50.800]  died as a way to attack us and to try to bring us down.
[3:28:50.800 --> 3:28:52.800]  Well, here's how you defeat them, folks.
[3:28:52.800 --> 3:28:54.800]  You don't just say it, you commit, you do it,
[3:28:54.800 --> 3:28:57.800]  buy a DVD burner, they got dual ones, they're inexpensive,
[3:28:57.800 --> 3:28:59.800]  or we're going to have a DivX version,

[3:29:19.800 --> 3:29:21.800]  and they want to stop us.
[3:29:21.800 --> 3:29:23.800]  We need to intensify this.

[3:38:28.840 --> 3:38:31.400]  Terranies coming down. They're using terror to bully us
[3:38:31.400 --> 3:38:34.680]  They're saying we may have a ton attack and then you'll love us again
[3:38:34.680 --> 3:38:36.280]  Then you'll learn to let us take your rights
[3:38:36.280 --> 3:38:42.160]  Then you'll learn to not question us boy an attack would sure help us these bastards think you're so stupid
[3:38:42.160 --> 3:38:43.040]  They talk right at you
[3:38:43.040 --> 3:38:48.720]  They're also threatening more than half the population that knows they did it saying you watch it
[3:38:48.720 --> 3:38:53.640]  We'll do it again. We'll torture you. They're a bunch of bully scum and
[3:38:54.520 --> 3:38:59.520]  Luke I'm telling you need to follow complaint with YouTube as he posted on your page saying you need to be killed
[3:38:59.920 --> 3:39:03.960]  he's on his own page saying that our children need to be killed and
[3:39:03.960 --> 3:39:05.960]  And
[3:39:08.920 --> 3:39:10.920]  Man, I just can't handle it anymore
[3:39:11.400 --> 3:39:14.040]  This America hating trash just makes me sick
[3:39:14.880 --> 3:39:19.520]  Any Luke. I mean he's talking about Dan Wallace. He says
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:26.680]  Laugh out loud Dan Wallace. I told him I would never stop talking about five years ago. He's in the
[3:39:26.680 --> 3:39:34.760]  Trissurizing film. He's he's on we are change website watching the they made a mirror of our trailer
[3:39:35.520 --> 3:39:38.400]  And he's saying well Dan you're not talking. Now. Are you?
[3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:45.520]  So you were wrong laugh out loud laugh out loud ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. He actually pond himself
[3:39:46.800 --> 3:39:53.020]  Here by saying he wouldn't stop doing something when he clearly has still I guess having already been eaten by maggots
[3:39:53.020 --> 3:39:57.640]  going back on a statement he made and once again showing how troopers are
[3:39:57.640 --> 3:40:02.360]  always wrong and never stick to one thing is the least of the worries laugh
[3:40:02.360 --> 3:40:06.200]  out loud he he he then he goes into saying hi he wants to pay $100,000 to
[3:40:06.200 --> 3:40:11.680]  have bullets put in our heads this doesn't scare us or anything it makes us
[3:40:11.680 --> 3:40:15.280]  want to fight you harder it makes us commit harder it makes the listeners
[3:40:15.280 --> 3:40:19.880]  tell more people about info wars.com or we are change Luke comments on that
[3:40:19.880 --> 3:40:23.920]  before I go to Stuart. It just shows you how low these people will go to attack
[3:40:23.920 --> 3:40:28.720]  you and it doesn't just go into YouTube there's actual people will go out to our
[3:40:28.720 --> 3:40:34.940]  speed action and antagonize us you know using our best friend and also passed away
[3:40:34.940 --> 3:40:39.220]  as a way to attack us it's like psychological warfare to hurt us and to
[3:40:39.220 --> 3:40:43.000]  bring us down but I just wanted to say the more they attack us the more that
[3:40:43.000 --> 3:40:46.600]  they try to hurt us the more that they threaten us the more we are resilient
[3:40:46.600 --> 3:40:49.760]  the more we will stand up the more we will believe in truth and love because
[3:40:49.760 --> 3:40:54.440]  this is what makes it real when when we go through all this this makes it so
[3:40:54.440 --> 3:40:57.920]  yeah when you have the cops come up and say your camera's a gun we're gonna say
[3:40:57.920 --> 3:41:02.160]  you have bombs we know you don't we're gonna frame you you really know the
[3:41:02.160 --> 3:41:06.480]  government's the terrorists then I mean you really learn it folks I mean you
[3:41:06.480 --> 3:41:10.800]  can talk to talk folks but you got to walk to walk this makes it true this
[3:41:10.800 --> 3:41:14.160]  makes it real and people have to understand it's not a game it's life
[3:41:14.160 --> 3:41:17.200]  is that but we're going to stand up we're going to put ourselves on a line
[3:41:17.200 --> 3:41:20.800]  we know the Bible talks about being persecuted is actually a blessing I
[3:41:20.800 --> 3:41:24.440]  never understood that when I was a child it's really true you you feel sorry for
[3:41:24.440 --> 3:41:29.120]  them but it also empowers you to help other people that aren't informed and
[3:41:29.120 --> 3:41:34.480]  to stand up it is a blessing when you're being persecuted and makes it all you
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:38.800]  know what we have to go through it makes it so well you just understand
[3:41:38.800 --> 3:41:41.640]  that you have to fight even more and that's what we're gonna do and people
[3:41:41.640 --> 3:41:45.480]  don't they don't understand they more they attack us it backs but it backfires
[3:41:45.480 --> 3:41:47.800]  on them because now we're going to release more videos because now we're
[3:41:47.800 --> 3:41:50.960]  going to go cook up more people that we're going to work hard on not 1108
[3:41:50.960 --> 3:41:54.960]  this year we're gonna do everything in our power to do what's right because we
[3:41:54.960 --> 3:41:59.040]  have basically a lot of everything against us but nothing is gonna stop us
[3:41:59.040 --> 3:42:02.560]  because we really have truth and love on our side and there's nothing else we
[3:42:02.560 --> 3:42:06.200]  really need but that and that's that's what we're gonna use as a way to change
[3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:12.000]  this country to change this world absolutely let's bring steward how
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:18.520]  up Stuart sorry we got you up late on the show we are change Los Angeles big
[3:42:18.520 --> 3:42:22.640]  part of making truth rising such a success again the film is meant to

[3:42:26.960 --> 3:42:32.160]  or trans-Texas corridors or gun control or borders or whatever you're into this

[3:43:05.000 --> 3:43:10.000]  that's an honor and and a joy you know to be out there with you guys you know
[3:43:10.000 --> 3:43:13.400]  that the stand shoulder to shoulder with you and Luke I gotta tell you said
[3:43:13.400 --> 3:43:17.720]  something earlier struck a chord but this is not a joke and that was brought
[3:43:17.720 --> 3:43:25.520]  home very very strongly at Bilderberg talk about that some Stuart well you
[3:43:25.520 --> 3:43:30.480]  know just to see the presence of these scoundrels and how they went about
[3:43:30.480 --> 3:43:36.080]  their their deceptive acts and you know Jim Tucker makes a good point that
[3:43:36.080 --> 3:43:40.000]  good works are done in the light of day and evil is done under a cloak of
[3:43:40.000 --> 3:43:46.080]  darkness and to see the link that these people went to to maintain secrecy was
[3:43:46.080 --> 3:43:50.720]  astounding and to be you know confronted by armed men we shoot the kill
[3:43:50.720 --> 3:43:56.000]  orders as we were out there at night especially it was really empowering to
[3:43:56.000 --> 3:43:59.440]  to stand with everybody out there all the the good souls that were out there
[3:43:59.440 --> 3:44:04.760]  and it was amazing and that you know I bring that power back and let that you
[3:44:04.760 --> 3:44:09.560]  know empower our whole group out here and moving forward because we've got a
[3:44:09.560 --> 3:44:14.480]  lot of work ahead of us and it's it's an amazing thing to be part of well it
[3:44:14.480 --> 3:44:19.280]  certainly is my friend you haven't had a chance to see truth rising but a lot of
[3:44:19.280 --> 3:44:23.080]  the work you guys did is in there also your interview with Martin Sheen that
[3:44:23.080 --> 3:44:27.480]  Stuart conducted is in there I mean a lot of this stuff you've seen on YouTube
[3:44:27.480 --> 3:44:30.640]  here and there you may have forgotten about more of the you know than you
[3:44:30.640 --> 3:44:35.040]  remember you'll now see it in its original video quality a lot of things
[3:44:35.040 --> 3:44:39.080]  that haven't been seen are in the film it also chronicles the first responders
[3:44:39.080 --> 3:44:42.800]  the government documents how they knew the dust was killing them and then how
[3:44:42.800 --> 3:44:45.760]  they blocked funding and I saw an article last week with the federal
[3:44:45.760 --> 3:44:48.880]  government and the city government saying oh you're just hypochondriacs
[3:44:48.880 --> 3:44:55.160]  you're fine when Mount Sinai and when the universities have done the chest
[3:44:55.160 --> 3:45:01.160]  scans they're dying in mass all the dogs died years ago and they just say hey
[3:45:01.160 --> 3:45:05.920]  shut up shut up you're not sick as your teeth fall out you go in a coffin as the
[3:45:05.920 --> 3:45:09.320]  mean there's fire chiefs that are dying we've had heart attacks who are you know
[3:45:09.320 --> 3:45:14.680]  50 years old there's police dying and they just say shut up and die shut up I
[3:45:14.680 --> 3:45:19.120]  mean that's what they think of you police and military and emergency workers
[3:45:19.120 --> 3:45:23.080]  hey can you speak to that Luke I mean that's what they're doing and it's
[3:45:23.080 --> 3:45:26.920]  sick and disgusting seeing New York's bravest the fire department the police
[3:45:26.920 --> 3:45:31.400]  department even construction sanitation workers being spit on in this
[3:45:31.400 --> 3:45:36.560]  respected by the government I mean it is just incredibly disgusting knowing that
[3:45:36.560 --> 3:45:40.720]  heroes literally heroes who went to rescue people were lied to and are
[3:45:40.720 --> 3:45:43.960]  being denied the help that they deserve and we're here in New York so we're
[3:45:43.960 --> 3:45:46.800]  raising money pretty few because if you will need all the help they could get
[3:45:46.800 --> 3:45:49.400]  they were lied to by the government they're being denied help by the
[3:45:49.400 --> 3:45:52.840]  government right now and it's our job as people to help each other out
[3:45:52.840 --> 3:45:55.400]  and that's what we're doing that we are changed it all right we just released a
[3:45:55.400 --> 3:45:58.400]  first-ponder video a couple days ago people could see it on our YouTube
[3:45:58.400 --> 3:46:03.640]  channel youtube.com slash we are changed see the student we we did with a union
[3:46:03.640 --> 3:46:07.480]  organizer who basically lost all his teeth because of the medication because
[3:46:07.480 --> 3:46:12.800]  of everything he went through because of ground zero well there's 56,000 of them
[3:46:12.800 --> 3:46:19.800]  thousands have now died thousand certified by hospitals by universities by
[3:46:19.800 --> 3:46:25.760]  CAT scans and the government just says shut up and die basically shut up just
[3:46:25.760 --> 3:46:29.840]  shut up and let us use your name to launch war this what makes me so sick
[3:46:29.840 --> 3:46:34.800]  Dan Wallace lost his dad a firefighter one of the towers and these fed show up
[3:46:34.800 --> 3:46:39.280]  and make fun of him and his dead dad and you know the the thing is their ego
[3:46:39.280 --> 3:46:45.480]  maniacs they think it hurts us to be dissed no it only emboldens us and I
[3:46:45.480 --> 3:46:49.280]  don't even hate these people anymore I actually see them for the pathetic sad
[3:46:49.280 --> 3:46:54.760]  heartless little crone-like demons that I mean you look at I mean it now it's
[3:46:54.760 --> 3:47:00.000]  upsetting for humanity and and and and it's upsetting for our own people when
[3:47:00.000 --> 3:47:04.800]  they get confused by it but but I mean overall it's just we're two different
[3:47:04.800 --> 3:47:09.600]  creatures I mean there is a mindset there's a level and I just am so sad
[3:47:09.600 --> 3:47:13.680]  that most the public is locked off in this materialistic low-level petty
[3:47:13.680 --> 3:47:19.480]  demon level I mean you see what I'm saying a skirt I do I do and I think
[3:47:19.480 --> 3:47:23.040]  conversely that's that's how we're gonna win out to because they're overplaying
[3:47:23.040 --> 3:47:28.200]  their hand so dramatically and they're showing themselves to be completely
[3:47:28.200 --> 3:47:32.640]  about deception and it's these over acts of of lying and of but
[3:47:32.640 --> 3:47:36.480]  disrespecting the people that are there to look out for us the police and the
[3:47:36.480 --> 3:47:39.680]  military that's gonna you know help create their downfall well here's an
[3:47:39.680 --> 3:47:46.760]  example the screw loose change people all deception all deception all lies all
[3:47:46.760 --> 3:47:52.100]  twisting they and I told Berman some month ago when I first saw this he goes
[3:47:52.100 --> 3:47:55.720]  look one of the main guys on the screw loose change site he is saying that he
[3:47:55.720 --> 3:48:00.080]  you know he's he's in the army he's showing his documents he's he's been
[3:48:00.080 --> 3:48:05.040]  shipped and and I said Berman's that's gonna be a hoax that's gonna be a fake
[3:48:05.040 --> 3:48:08.920]  then a few days later he said no it's not I promise you know these guys mean
[3:48:08.920 --> 3:48:13.400]  well they're not agents he just you know he he doesn't think not a loves an
[3:48:13.400 --> 3:48:17.080]  inside job but and I said Berman's it's gonna be fake but I said okay watch I'll
[3:48:17.080 --> 3:48:20.720]  go on air and and we'll report on it and then later they're gonna say they
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:25.600]  hoaxed us showing what idiots we are and he said no it's not but finally
[3:48:25.600 --> 3:48:28.720]  Burmese now finally respects me I've been right about ten things he's been wrong
[3:48:28.720 --> 3:48:31.960]  about every one of them and then later they call and then laugh at me and say
[3:48:31.960 --> 3:48:36.080]  you got hoaxed and I just went on air and said my cousin got a chip the

[3:55:25.480 --> 3:55:29.840]  use in US newspapers that they flew out 6,000 Taliban al-Qaeda commanders of
[3:55:29.840 --> 3:55:35.320]  safety those forces are now being used to attack Iran here's ABC news today
[3:55:35.320 --> 3:55:41.240]  years after we told you about this is White House blocking search for bin
[3:55:41.240 --> 3:55:46.320]  Laden question mark Pentagon would use special forces and have been locked in
[3:55:46.320 --> 3:55:50.600]  Pakistan New York Times says this is just ridiculous now I've been told by
[3:55:50.600 --> 3:55:58.240]  inside sources in the CFR and CIA that he's been dead since early 2002 and then
[3:55:58.240 --> 3:56:02.280]  he's on ice and they may pop him out at any time and we were told that five
[3:56:02.280 --> 3:56:06.120]  years ago of course Pentagon was driving a secret plan that would send us
[3:56:06.120 --> 3:56:10.000]  special forces into wild tribal regions of Pakistan to capture or kill us on
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:16.720]  the line folks it came out before 9-11 in British newspapers that there were
[3:56:16.720 --> 3:56:23.960]  British and US troops guarding bin Laden in this very region of Pakistan so it
[3:56:23.960 --> 3:56:29.760]  just it's just incredible but the public thinks Afghanistan is the
[3:56:29.760 --> 3:56:36.960]  Middle East so just like they think the dollars still strong and a lot of these
[3:56:36.960 --> 3:56:39.560]  people that death threat us and stuff they really think they're defending the
[3:56:39.560 --> 3:56:43.880]  United States they don't understand I mean here's Ron Paul I've also got OPEC
[3:56:43.880 --> 3:56:51.920]  saying it a bunch of others saying tripling of fuel prices Paul Iran war
[3:56:51.920 --> 3:56:55.880]  will triple energy prices Republican Congressman Ron Paul warns against
[3:56:55.880 --> 3:56:59.520]  military engagement and Iran saying bombing will cause energy prices to
[3:56:59.520 --> 3:57:03.040]  skyrocket and a speech on my house floor I meant to play that last night
[3:57:03.040 --> 3:57:07.080]  didn't have time Congressman Paul suggested that the US is inching towards
[3:57:07.080 --> 3:57:11.560]  a endless struggle similar to the Iraq war in the last several weeks in front
[3:57:11.560 --> 3:57:16.960]  of and if not for months we've heard a lot of talk about potential for Israel
[3:57:16.960 --> 3:57:20.800]  and the United States to bomb Iran energy prices are being bit up because of
[3:57:20.800 --> 3:57:25.720]  this fear it has been predicted that if bombs start dropping that will see
[3:57:25.720 --> 3:57:31.240]  energy prices double or triple said the Republican yeah and 70 plus percent is
[3:57:31.240 --> 3:57:42.160]  the dollar and that other 25 percent or so is the war hysteria and just amazing
