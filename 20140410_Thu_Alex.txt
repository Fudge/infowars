[01:05.600 --> 01:09.520]  public land to where they've got the 300 cows they've stolen from him the BLM
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.080]  and take them back and of course the feds have snipers armored vehicles

[02:10.040 --> 02:13.840]  the right to land even if some government later declares that it's a I
[02:13.840 --> 02:20.280]  mean 90% of Nevada I kept saying 87 it's not 90% is federal other five six
[02:20.280 --> 02:25.400]  percent of state less than five percent total is private and can you imagine

[02:59.160 --> 03:10.880]  on the side of the road on a sidewalk being yelled at being yelled at by the
[03:10.880 --> 03:17.040]  police for daring to set up cameras on a sidewalk not on the highway but on a
[03:17.040 --> 03:21.640]  front of truck you don't do that when the emperor comes around and such a joke
[03:21.640 --> 03:26.920]  for this criminal nobody for any president helicopters and shutting down
[03:26.920 --> 03:30.880]  major highways and shutting down the entrance ramps and cops bugging their

[08:56.280 --> 09:05.280]  block major highways hours ahead of the great furor and leader like us now has
[09:05.280 --> 09:12.240]  arrived our Lord and Savior according to Jamie Foxx Barack Obama Barack Obama
[09:12.240 --> 09:17.960]  ladies and gentlemen whose attorney general is acting as a dictator and
[09:17.960 --> 09:23.160]  ignoring Congress on their subpoenas on fast and furious Benghazi the list goes
[09:23.160 --> 09:29.960]  on and on but the dam is beginning to break yesterday we aired the clips of
[09:29.960 --> 09:40.400]  two different congressmen from Texas basically saying that Eric Holder
[09:40.400 --> 09:47.200]  should be arrested for ignoring their federal subpoena and he threatened back
[09:47.200 --> 09:51.400]  to Gohmert Louie Gohmert of Texas you don't want to go there buddy was
[09:51.400 --> 09:55.800]  pointing his finger at him very menacingly so this is a criminal
[09:55.800 --> 10:03.200]  takeover that's going on the good news is that real libertarian-style Tea Party
[10:03.200 --> 10:08.320]  Republicans are now understanding there's a total takeover taking place if
[10:08.320 --> 10:11.200]  they don't stand up against this criminal action I mean Obama has
[10:11.200 --> 10:16.720]  served at least done let's not exaggerate I don't know 30 40 times what Nixon did
[10:16.720 --> 10:25.040]  unconstitutional and it's all naked I mean they've already basically stolen the
[10:25.040 --> 10:28.960]  farm that they've already done everything and now they don't get in trouble
[10:28.960 --> 10:33.840]  Katie bar the door here's the Hill newspaper GOP calls for learners
[10:33.840 --> 10:39.880]  prosecution House Wainson means committee yesterday accused former IRS
[10:39.880 --> 10:45.000]  official not servant lowest learner of targeting the prominent GOP group
[10:45.000 --> 10:52.240]  crossroads GPS and urged the Justice Department to take a fresh look at
[10:52.240 --> 10:55.800]  whether she should be prosecuted and I guess they're only going after that
[10:55.800 --> 10:59.360]  because it's got Carl Roeb involved in it so see it's the real Republican
[10:59.360 --> 11:02.280]  establishment is also getting upset they've actually been messed with now
[11:02.280 --> 11:06.920]  they're like hey we're supposed to just share power here and bring in NAFTA and
[11:06.920 --> 11:10.440]  get in the New World Order and the police state and Obamacare and act like
[11:10.440 --> 11:12.960]  well you know we're fighting what are you doing you're trying to get rid of
[11:12.960 --> 11:16.960]  us completely that's what the founders put the separation of powers in knowing
[11:16.960 --> 11:21.360]  you'd have different criminal groups dividing the legislative dividing the
[11:21.360 --> 11:25.360]  judicial you know that divided up with the states the people dividing it up
[11:25.360 --> 11:28.600]  with juries and grand juries and the executive they were always worried about
[11:28.600 --> 11:32.920]  becoming a dictatorship so that was bound down by the Constitution and the
[11:32.920 --> 11:37.320]  fact that was given its orders by Congress than the president executes now
[11:37.320 --> 11:41.120]  the president is operating and the bureaucracy is operating teamed up as
[11:41.120 --> 11:44.680]  if they're king they've kind of bought off the Congress who's now figuring out
[11:44.680 --> 11:49.560]  they become ceremonial and won't matter soon if they don't wake up and new
[11:49.560 --> 11:54.640]  libertarian tea party types have gotten in as a moral compass they're not perfect
[11:54.640 --> 11:59.760]  but they're not absolute you know authoritarian status that want to
[11:59.760 --> 12:05.880]  extinct all freedom and I know a lot of these Congress people on and off air and
[12:05.880 --> 12:08.880]  I mean a lot of them are more hardcore than I am they just won't say it on air
[12:08.880 --> 12:13.160]  a lot of them are listening right now they know what I'm saying is true and
[12:13.160 --> 12:16.800]  I'm not taking credit for info wars it's just that we've decompartmentalized a
[12:16.800 --> 12:21.280]  lot of stuff where people that are in Congress go wow it's true this has been
[12:21.280 --> 12:25.520]  going on all along and they see how real all this is and they give us intel as
[12:25.520 --> 12:31.160]  well that really scares the system so GOP calls for learners prosecution
[12:31.160 --> 12:35.120]  House Republicans won't rule out arresting lowest learner if Justice
[12:35.120 --> 12:39.120]  Department doesn't that's absolutely beautiful House wanes and means
[12:39.120 --> 12:42.920]  committee Republicans are aren't ruling out the use of chambers inherent
[12:42.920 --> 12:46.960]  contempt authority if Attorney General Eric Holder refuses to act on the
[12:46.960 --> 12:51.520]  people's accusations against former IRS official lowest learner the committee
[12:51.520 --> 12:55.000]  voted Wednesday to seek an investigation whether to learn or violated federal law
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.560]  by using her power to ensure right-leaning groups were targeted for
[12:58.560 --> 13:02.440]  extra scrutiny by the agency the Democrats admit they did that not one
[13:02.440 --> 13:08.320]  Democrat or communist or socialist group was targeted George Soros could
[13:08.320 --> 13:10.880]  inside or trade all day he doesn't get in trouble with the SEC
[13:10.880 --> 13:13.800]  choking the Democratic you know former governor in New Jersey
[13:13.800 --> 13:18.520]  core side I mean these people are above the law folks and remember Cummings
[13:18.520 --> 13:21.840]  acting like he was all mad at the committees when she took the fifth a few
[13:21.840 --> 13:25.280]  weeks ago and saying how dare him not be able to ask questions she took the fifth
[13:25.280 --> 13:30.640]  that means you can't talk then once you take it but she says I take the fifth so
[13:30.640 --> 13:35.880]  and then she puts out lies she's done that before Cummings using the public's
[13:35.880 --> 13:41.920]  ignorance acted like Issa was censoring him well of course it turns out now it's
[13:41.920 --> 13:45.480]  being reported the Washington Free Beacon IRS gave House oversight Democrats
[13:45.480 --> 13:50.520]  info on targeted conservative group Cummings previously denied IRS contact
[13:50.520 --> 13:57.920]  they're all in on it Elijah Cummings all of them this is a mafia group ladies and
[13:57.920 --> 14:03.360]  gentlemen they're going after everyone at a level never before seen arresting
[14:03.360 --> 14:11.080]  filmmakers the next to Susa arresting governors literally for taking donations
[14:11.080 --> 14:16.680]  from a supplement company I mean I looked at it something illegal but it was a
[14:16.680 --> 14:23.120]  little untoward so the governor of Virginia would whisper it you know with
[14:23.120 --> 14:26.880]  with his friends at dinner about how when he got out of office he was going to
[14:26.880 --> 14:33.160]  work for a supplement company and how he was an exercise aficionado and you know
[14:33.160 --> 14:37.080]  how much he loved the supplements and so because he acted like it was something
[14:37.080 --> 14:41.480]  he was trying to hide they acted like that was illegal again they use the
[14:41.480 --> 14:45.600]  ignorance like they tell you it's a law to take vaccines it's not or they tell
[14:45.600 --> 14:50.400]  you that this rancher is out there stealing land when the governor's now
[14:50.400 --> 14:58.400]  come out and said no it's state law and the feds are just and the feds are

[17:20.680 --> 17:25.040]  Glenn Beck you know 20 million a week all these shows coast to coast a year
[17:25.040 --> 17:29.600]  with 16 million a week covering it and but then oh MSNBC and seeing in with
[17:29.600 --> 17:33.120]  half million viewers on their top shows oh they set the reality and are
[17:33.120 --> 17:37.680]  demonizing him so we're gonna we're gonna go to David Knight and find out
[17:37.680 --> 17:41.000]  what he's got coming up on this but more people are getting there and the
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.920]  answer is I believe the Gandhi approach is to just walk through and show it's
[17:45.920 --> 17:49.720]  the people's land now remember this isn't even a national park this is nine
[17:49.720 --> 17:54.160]  percent of the state his family's been there since 1877 they have the quote
[17:54.160 --> 17:59.240]  surface rights and forage rights the water rights and the forage rights
[17:59.240 --> 18:05.000]  unequivocal folks I my family are big landowners since 1829 we still hold land
[18:05.000 --> 18:09.320]  1829 Mexican land grants so I know all about this and the governor's come out
[18:09.320 --> 18:12.640]  and said this is intimidation this is wrong he's following state law now we're
[18:12.640 --> 18:16.440]  gonna go to break and come back with David Knight in the Skype link there
[18:16.440 --> 18:23.840]  but first I want to play a clip of Cliven Bundy speaking at the Moopa Valley
[18:23.840 --> 18:29.240]  town hall meaning and even the town hall has big banners up about the defense of
[18:29.240 --> 18:33.320]  private property and he get in he says his sheriff needs to arrest the feds
[18:33.320 --> 18:37.560]  and folks all it's gonna take is a sheriff this isn't like you know the
[18:37.560 --> 18:39.920]  civil rights movement where some of the states were out of line and Eisenhower
[18:39.920 --> 18:45.280]  shin in you know federal marshals in the army to open up schools where the moral
[18:45.280 --> 18:49.040]  high ground was on the side of the feds the balance of power this is this is the
[18:49.040 --> 18:54.320]  people having their land rights taken and now if the feds push and try to say
[18:54.320 --> 18:57.920]  folks are terrorists in this they're gonna lose the moral high ground so this
[18:57.920 --> 19:01.920]  is the time to push I don't want violence but this could be the shot her
[19:01.920 --> 19:06.520]  around the world if the feds the sniper shoot somebody and and I'm worried you
[19:06.520 --> 19:08.960]  know there are real unstable people out there too they're sick of being pushed
[19:08.960 --> 19:12.160]  around you know if there could be somebody really go after the feds out

[24:23.120 --> 24:30.160]  culturally system we have a bankrupt federal government run by foreign
[24:30.160 --> 24:34.360]  banks that want people off the public land the federal government's got more
[24:34.360 --> 24:38.960]  than half the land in this country upwards of 80% of the land out west 90%
[24:38.960 --> 24:46.480]  of Nevada and they don't want people using the open range that predates
[24:46.480 --> 24:53.000]  fences coming in in the 1870s and 1880s in Mexico and all the national parks
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.720]  I've been to a couple big ones that have big rolling hills and grass and
[24:58.720 --> 25:03.080]  desert there's sheep and cows folks and the people aren't paying to be on it
[25:03.080 --> 25:07.000]  because they've always been there and they have the grazing rights to it one
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.400]  reason Mexico City's gotten so huge is that in southern Mexico the only area
[25:11.400 --> 25:15.000]  that was able to stop it was the Chiapas area but all the other areas they
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.040]  forced everybody off their land because they didn't have deeds to it they've
[25:18.040 --> 25:24.000]  been there for thousands of years the same thing all over the world the
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.800]  globalist the UN under agenda 21 is forcing the rural populations off land
[25:28.800 --> 25:32.720]  and if you own the land they're going to come take it from you with regulations
[25:32.720 --> 25:38.320]  and taxes now I take you now live to Nevada right there on the border with
[25:38.320 --> 25:50.160]  Arizona with the sixth-generation family and we have Ammon Bundy the son of the
[25:50.160 --> 25:56.600]  rancher who's been standing up Cliven Bundy but first is David Knight giving
[25:56.600 --> 26:01.520]  us a report on what he's seen since he got there David Knight reporting David
[26:01.520 --> 26:05.440]  thanks for coming on and thanks for going out there thank you Alex we're
[26:05.440 --> 26:08.800]  here at the protest area and I've got him and Bundy standing right next to me
[26:08.800 --> 26:12.560]  now you were talking about people being tasered last night and there was some
[26:12.560 --> 26:16.680]  real brutal things that happened there but I want to let him tell you why they
[26:16.680 --> 26:19.560]  were there as you mentioned before this is about rights if they can take their
[26:19.560 --> 26:23.080]  grazing rights if they can take their water rights they can take your rights
[26:23.080 --> 26:26.920]  your property rights at your home so if you're not a rancher you don't know any
[26:26.920 --> 26:29.840]  ranchers because they're going out of business left and right and this is a
[26:29.840 --> 26:34.960]  small family business that's been here for over about 140 years and let me let
[26:34.960 --> 26:37.880]  you hear from Ammon what happened last night he was one of the people that got
[26:37.880 --> 26:43.120]  tasered last night and then tell us what happened last night um well just to set
[26:43.120 --> 26:48.320]  the area they've got this this land around 600,000 acres completely locked
[26:48.320 --> 26:52.960]  down if you step off the road they arrest you and they don't just be nice
[26:52.960 --> 26:57.000]  about it they knock you on the ground rub your face in the ground handcuff you
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.040]  and take you off that's how they're doing it so they literally by force have
[27:03.040 --> 27:08.440]  closed this land off and have occupied it and one more thing to set the setting
[27:08.440 --> 27:14.440]  here if almost every wash and every canyon if you will here and every road
[27:14.440 --> 27:19.480]  has either an agent on it or has a camera in it to make sure that people are
[27:19.480 --> 27:25.720]  obedient to what they say and anyway and and I'm not exaggerating that one bit
[27:25.720 --> 27:34.040]  okay so yesterday we we've been we've we've already had citizens run to the
[27:34.040 --> 27:38.840]  ground and arrested we had so the other day and I'll just tell you two
[27:38.840 --> 27:43.760]  incidences the other day we had a citizen a 16-year-old boy that pulled off
[27:43.760 --> 27:49.600]  here where he's been his whole life went down to the river here and we saw
[27:49.600 --> 27:54.880]  about five or six of their agents or vehicles go down there and so we rushed
[27:54.880 --> 27:59.400]  over there to protect him because of what happened before and they were on their
[27:59.400 --> 28:04.800]  way to doing the exact same thing to him and we we had to you know basically
[28:04.800 --> 28:09.920]  push them off this 16-year-old boy to get him to and protect him and they we
[28:09.920 --> 28:15.720]  did back him down there was about 40 of us then yesterday where most of the
[28:15.720 --> 28:20.560]  activity that's I got a lot of news here the way it started is they came down off
[28:20.560 --> 28:28.120]  this mountain and there was 16 or excuse me 14 units and one of them was a dump
[28:28.120 --> 28:34.400]  truck with a backhoe on a trailer behind it and the other 13 units were
[28:34.400 --> 28:40.280]  protection units heavily armed for this dump truck and this backhoe and we saw
[28:40.280 --> 28:44.440]  him come off this hill so we took the opportunity to protest them but we also
[28:44.440 --> 28:47.720]  felt that it was crucial that we understood what in the world was in the
[28:47.720 --> 28:52.800]  back of that dump truck they've been chasing these cattle all over this
[28:52.800 --> 28:57.040]  country and it's been a hot hot year so far it was over over 90 degrees already
[28:57.040 --> 29:01.220]  and not these cattle can't run very long before they overheat and it'll kill them
[29:01.220 --> 29:06.080]  also we know that they've been separating these these mothers from their
[29:06.080 --> 29:09.720]  calves this is calving seating for us right now so they're separating these
[29:09.720 --> 29:14.360]  young calves from their mothers and we are seeing cattle that have tight bags
[29:14.360 --> 29:18.480]  meaning where are their calves their calves are separated you know lying under
[29:18.480 --> 29:26.520]  a bush getting ready to die or dying so so anyway we wanted to know what was in
[29:26.520 --> 29:29.800]  the back of the day there possibly we're going to break hang on stay there
[29:29.800 --> 29:33.840]  we're gonna go to break he's gonna come back and finish the story and there's
[29:33.840 --> 29:37.880]  video at info wars.com where they taser even blood and everything and slamming
[29:37.880 --> 29:41.760]  women's heads in the ground and imagine 600,000 acres everybody's always gone
[29:41.760 --> 29:45.480]  on it locals don't even know what's going on you step on it here come federal

[33:40.320 --> 33:45.800]  truck is worth $18,000 and he said no it's listed at about 3,000 in the Kelly
[33:45.800 --> 33:49.160]  Blue Book and that's what I paid for it I need something to haul stuff around it's
[33:49.160 --> 33:53.600]  a junkie to old truck but you know runs okay and they said no you owe us you know
[33:53.600 --> 33:57.840]  $6,000 we've got all the documentation we're gonna show that he's at five or
[33:57.840 --> 34:05.920]  6,000 so he just went to a DPS office in Houston and they said yeah this
[34:05.920 --> 34:11.840]  were $3,000 and you owe us 400 bucks but still he didn't really own his truck
[34:11.840 --> 34:15.280]  license registration all this stuff that didn't used to happen on your
[34:15.280 --> 34:20.520]  transportation on your horse and buggy travel is not a privilege it's a right
[34:20.520 --> 34:23.600]  but they've lied to you now people think it's a privilege because the cops say
[34:23.600 --> 34:29.440]  so it's a privilege to engage in commerce on publicly paid for roads and to
[34:29.440 --> 34:33.160]  have an 18-wheeler that's how it all started in the 20s was they had heavier
[34:33.160 --> 34:37.320]  trucks traveling and they argued to the public oh they're tearing up the roads
[34:37.320 --> 34:42.480]  you're having to pay for it let's make them get license and registration because
[34:42.480 --> 34:46.880]  they're in commerce and the states were able to constitutionally do that now
[34:46.880 --> 34:52.280]  you're in commerce see the governor of Nevada's now come out and said this is
[34:52.280 --> 34:55.680]  intimidation the fed should back off and that he does have the grazing rights
[34:55.680 --> 35:02.400]  and the water rights folks let me explain how big this is when you have the
[35:02.400 --> 35:07.720]  surface rights and the feds come along when they're there 140 years ago and the
[35:07.720 --> 35:12.320]  feds come along 140 years later and say well we just say this is all federal
[35:12.320 --> 35:15.400]  land out here because nobody ever officially got it because nobody wanted
[35:15.400 --> 35:21.920]  it you have the grazing rights in 1877 we're just not gonna let you do it or
[35:21.920 --> 35:28.880]  you can pay us a bunch of money and this is all about agenda 21 on record get
[35:28.880 --> 35:33.880]  the book we sell it behind the green mask or my film in game an info or
[35:33.880 --> 35:38.040]  store.com give it to people so and then it supports the broadcast we can have a
[35:38.040 --> 35:41.120]  reporters go out and cover things like this it's very expensive to do this and
[35:41.120 --> 35:44.480]  give it to all your county commissioners your city council so they
[35:44.480 --> 35:48.360]  understand most of them are not criminals they just are ignorant and they
[35:48.360 --> 35:52.000]  think wow the feds have arrived we've all got to kiss their butt just 10 years
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.080]  ago the feds still got permission when they came into a town or city now they
[35:56.080 --> 36:00.640]  don't even do that now they're ordering everyone around I've covered
[36:00.640 --> 36:05.640]  Bilderberg sitting there with a microphone peacefully sitting there and
[36:05.640 --> 36:09.680]  Hillary and Obama come into the deal before they was even elected and they
[36:09.680 --> 36:17.520]  got points an MP5 heckler machine gun at me because he had an earpiece and a tie
[36:17.520 --> 36:21.560]  and he thinks it's a secret agent and a movie star is a narcissistic mental
[36:21.560 --> 36:25.680]  patient secret service agent wanting to intimidate a bunch of reporters standing
[36:25.680 --> 36:31.280]  there showing where Obama was it when the media was saying where's Obama no one
[36:31.280 --> 36:34.920]  knows we knew we were there they were making the deal that she would step down
[36:34.920 --> 36:41.960]  he would be president we're the real media folks we went out and covered this
[36:41.960 --> 36:46.200]  we covered this over a week and a half ago drudge covered it in the in the big
[36:46.200 --> 36:50.560]  powerful alternative media and now it's everywhere and I'm not saying oh look we
[36:50.560 --> 36:55.200]  covered and broke this story because locals broke it the point is is that
[36:55.200 --> 36:59.680]  it's all happening to us and we need to show we're the real media we're the
[36:59.680 --> 37:05.400]  people's media mainstream media is saying you know Bundy claims he crazily
[37:05.400 --> 37:10.760]  owns this land that's federal didn't he nuts knowing people who aren't ranchers
[37:10.760 --> 37:14.320]  don't know about this don't know that eighty some percent of the West is
[37:14.320 --> 37:18.920]  federal don't know 90% of Nevada's federal don't know they just power grabbed
[37:18.920 --> 37:22.760]  it and said well we administer it now but you could still have your grazing
[37:22.760 --> 37:31.640]  rights so I want to go back to his son to give him the floor I'm in Bundy who
[37:31.640 --> 37:34.960]  was tasered and he's going to show us the wounds from that and I've seen the
[37:34.960 --> 37:38.040]  video on the local news the blood pouring out but when they tasered him
[37:38.040 --> 37:42.480]  folks ripped the taser out he was just telling the story of one of the young
[37:42.480 --> 37:46.320]  locals has gone down to the river when you're out in the desert that's where
[37:46.320 --> 37:52.880]  everybody hangs out on the BLM quote land 90% of the state they're outside
[37:52.880 --> 37:57.680]  the town 600,000 acres and here came the feds racing down to attacking and they
[37:57.680 --> 38:00.560]  almost had a confrontation and that's what's going to happen folks they're
[38:00.560 --> 38:03.040]  going to beat up a kid they're going to beat up a woman they're going to shoot
[38:03.040 --> 38:07.400]  a kid in the back and I'm telling you all hell's going to break loose and I
[38:07.400 --> 38:11.120]  don't want that to happen we're beating the globalist right now politically we
[38:11.120 --> 38:14.160]  are hurting them on every front they want to get a physical confrontation going
[38:14.160 --> 38:17.040]  they've got the billions of rounds of ammo the armored vehicles all of it
[38:17.040 --> 38:22.600]  they're going to lose that civil war in the first wave but then they're going
[38:22.600 --> 38:26.360]  to bring in the UN troops after and by the way folks I'm not kidding this is
[38:26.360 --> 38:33.560]  official State Department plan 7277 this is NLE09 and NLE 14 we got that was
[38:33.560 --> 38:36.720]  secret where it talks about using foreign troops against Americans this is
[38:36.720 --> 38:43.240]  all real now I want to go back to David Knight to finish talking to one of the
[38:43.240 --> 38:46.680]  ranchers who's been physically attacked and I guess it was his other brother
[38:46.680 --> 38:49.880]  what was it that got arrested for no reason and his head slamming the ground
[38:49.880 --> 38:54.760]  and taking to Las Vegas break down sir finish up your story about obviously
[38:54.760 --> 38:59.280]  Cal's dying or what was in the back of the dump truck and the over 250 armed
[38:59.280 --> 39:02.400]  people I mean getting to go over all of it David Knight and then I want you David
[39:02.400 --> 39:07.400]  to break down your take on all this David Knight Alex we're here with
[39:07.400 --> 39:13.280]  Amon Bundy and he's the son of Clive and Bundy and he was just telling us before
[39:13.280 --> 39:19.560]  the break that they were concerned about this convoy I saw because they had seen
[39:19.560 --> 39:23.200]  a lot of cows that were obviously had been separated from their calves this is
[39:23.200 --> 39:26.200]  calving season concerned that they're running these calves hard they're running
[39:26.200 --> 39:29.400]  the cows hard they're afraid that they're dying so they wanted to see what was
[39:29.400 --> 39:32.880]  inside this truck and that was a group of demonstrators let me show you first
[39:32.880 --> 39:36.000]  his where he was tasered right here on his neck and he were also tasered
[39:36.000 --> 39:42.480]  elsewhere right I was tasered on my arm and then they hit my chest and my
[39:42.480 --> 39:48.000]  stomach and you tore it out yeah either I tore it out or the some other people
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.960]  that were with me tore them out as they were shooting them that they tear them
[39:51.960 --> 39:56.520]  out well tell us what led up to this and we want to talk about because this is a
[39:56.520 --> 40:00.320]  real key thing this is the key point about this is about their water rights
[40:00.320 --> 40:03.760]  and that was what this ultimately turned out to be about but tell us about the
[40:03.760 --> 40:10.960]  incident leading up to that all right so they're coming down there was 14 units
[40:10.960 --> 40:16.720]  and what they were protecting this backhoe and this dump truck and we stopped
[40:16.720 --> 40:21.520]  the the convoy and in the intent to see what was in the back of that that dump
[40:21.520 --> 40:30.960]  truck and they they immediately came out armed and 13 units with two men and
[40:30.960 --> 40:38.520]  dogs each at least two men and dogs fully armed came out and began to resist us
[40:38.520 --> 40:43.240]  from being able to see what was in the back of that truck and it got quite
[40:43.240 --> 40:47.160]  heated it was you know pretty much just verbal for a while and then one of the
[40:47.160 --> 40:52.720]  Rangers came up behind a 59-year-old woman and body slammed her and after
[40:52.720 --> 41:00.060]  that it literally exploded into you know escalated tremendously slammed her
[41:00.060 --> 41:02.880]  into the ground yeah from behind there's you watch the video it's from
[41:02.880 --> 41:08.880]  behind yeah and then there was a you know continued a confrontation forward and
[41:08.880 --> 41:14.480]  then they they they started to tase me they hit me and we I ripped the first
[41:14.480 --> 41:17.960]  ones off or actually it was a combination there were several people we
[41:17.960 --> 41:23.480]  ripped them off and then they tased tased me again and ripped them off again
[41:23.480 --> 41:31.720]  then they tased me again and we ripped them off again and anyway it got it got
[41:31.720 --> 41:35.960]  to the point where we pretty much were backing them down they were trying to
[41:35.960 --> 41:39.280]  stick their dogs on us and we were about how many people did you have we had
[41:39.280 --> 41:44.000]  about 50 people and there was about probably 30 around 30 of them well
[41:44.000 --> 41:50.000]  armed yeah fully armed and basically kept pressing that they needed to get in
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.640]  their truck they needed to get out of here and we were able to push them far
[41:53.640 --> 41:59.000]  enough that we did get a look in the back of the truck and finally pushed them
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.600]  out of there and and made them leave what did you learn when you look on the
[42:02.600 --> 42:06.440]  truck well we thought the pops will be gonna be a rendering truck we're gonna
[42:06.440 --> 42:10.320]  have animals in there but we did not find that what we found was that there
[42:10.320 --> 42:15.480]  was there destroying all the water pipes and all the water tanks that are
[42:15.480 --> 42:18.960]  throughout this land that have been here over a hundred years destroying the
[42:18.960 --> 42:22.880]  infrastructure right sorry sorry Alex they're destroying the infrastructure just
[42:22.880 --> 42:27.640]  like Stalin did in Poland and Ukraine this is classic classic war against our
[42:27.640 --> 42:34.200]  infrastructure NAFTA GATT all of it is to shut us down it was reported yesterday
[42:34.200 --> 42:39.000]  by the LA Times ranchers are shutting down nationwide B prices of the highest
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.640]  ever recorded almost all the ranchers I know are a bit shut down even though B
[42:43.640 --> 42:47.960]  prices of the highest ever because of big agra having a bottleneck on the
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.400]  production of the meatpacking and so I want people to understand this is the
[42:52.400 --> 42:56.960]  shutdown of America this is clowered in Piven to bankrupt us we're seeing right
[42:56.960 --> 43:00.760]  now if you want welfare you want to come here and have your babies for free
[43:00.760 --> 43:05.680]  taxpayers will pay for it if you want to come here and vote to take our guns
[43:05.680 --> 43:09.640]  you can come into the country but if you if you've got the land and the water
[43:09.640 --> 43:14.080]  tanks and the water pipes for a hundred years where the windmills and you know
[43:14.080 --> 43:17.960]  where where this gentleman's great great granddaddy set it up you're not allowed
[43:17.960 --> 43:25.480]  to do that it will be destroyed by the criminals go ahead back to David
[43:25.480 --> 43:29.240]  talk a little bit about those water rights because those water rights yes I
[43:29.240 --> 43:31.640]  want to talk a little bit about those water rights because those water rights
[43:31.640 --> 43:35.120]  are very much like your property rights you register your property rights at the
[43:35.120 --> 43:38.320]  county state level it's not at the federal level and they can come in if
[43:38.320 --> 43:41.440]  we're gonna allow this to happen to these ranchers they're going to do that to
[43:41.440 --> 43:44.360]  us individually talk a little bit about the water rights and what what they
[43:44.360 --> 43:47.160]  try to do there because they are destroying infrastructure not only for
[43:47.160 --> 43:51.120]  you but for the wildlife that's out here right that's correct so those water
[43:51.120 --> 43:57.120]  rights were either purchased or or inherited from and originally came from
[43:57.120 --> 44:02.000]  homesteading okay and they're throughout this land here and we have done
[44:02.000 --> 44:06.360]  improvements over the last hundred years and pipe those lines down all through
[44:06.360 --> 44:11.480]  this country with with the tanks and pipes and and the wildlife and the cattle
[44:11.480 --> 44:16.520]  have used that water for a hundred hundred plus years they're tearing those
[44:16.520 --> 44:22.400]  out now the reason they're doing that is because that is the one thing that ties
[44:22.400 --> 44:25.880]  those rights to this land see the grazing rights are also tied to the
[44:25.880 --> 44:33.800]  water okay so if they have any if we have any legal right besides just state
[44:33.800 --> 44:38.080]  taking over its sovereignty which obviously we want to happen but it's
[44:38.080 --> 44:41.120]  tied to those waters and they know that and that's why when they're tearing
[44:41.120 --> 44:45.600]  these out and they're coming down that's why one dump truck in a backhoe has 13
[44:45.600 --> 44:48.720]  armed vehicles on it because they did not want us to see what was in the back
[44:48.720 --> 44:51.720]  of that because they are destroying those waters now they know where the
[44:51.720 --> 44:55.920]  critical points are to take our rights to take our property absolutely must be
[44:55.920 --> 45:01.480]  why in the world would they have 13 armed vehicles over 30 men with military
[45:01.480 --> 45:07.040]  rifles and and dogs to protect one backhoe in a dump truck let me let me
[45:07.040 --> 45:12.320]  add this point there's the famous cases look down this hill there's cases out
[45:12.320 --> 45:15.560]  in California you know where the guy had the hundred acres right between the two
[45:15.560 --> 45:19.560]  mountains he was a doctor no criminal record and they just came to his house
[45:19.560 --> 45:23.200]  and killed him in a marijuana raid there was no marijuana and then the police
[45:23.200 --> 45:26.640]  actually sold and moved into the property and actually the cops that killed
[45:26.640 --> 45:31.800]  him got the money and that's all this is his asset for which are seizure we have
[45:31.800 --> 45:36.120]  a predatory government and they state they want to quote rewilding half the
[45:36.120 --> 45:39.320]  country completely awful limits to humans they're tearing up the roads
[45:39.320 --> 45:43.240]  everywhere this is why America is shutting down and they know people are
[45:43.240 --> 45:48.800]  fleeing out west away from the tyranny of the cities and this is the war folks
[45:48.800 --> 45:52.560]  this is why in Florida there are resting women that for ten years you know that
[45:52.560 --> 45:57.680]  lady you had her own electric power out in the country and they saw her on the
[45:57.680 --> 46:01.920]  news and so they sent the code enforcers to try to take her house I mean this is
[46:01.920 --> 46:06.400]  happening everywhere your report David where there are resting people for
[46:06.400 --> 46:10.880]  collecting rainwater in Oregon this is the takeover now I want to talk about
[46:10.880 --> 46:15.280]  his father said he was concerned about confrontations yesterday those indeed
[46:15.280 --> 46:19.160]  happened we've seen him taser we've seen women assaulted by these little
[46:19.160 --> 46:23.960]  coward goons in their in their costumes in their little police dogs and I mean
[46:23.960 --> 46:30.000]  just just total cowards and we've seen their activities what are what are the
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.040]  actions planned today what do they think the next flash points could be what's
[46:34.040 --> 46:38.360]  the game plan going forward and we'd like to know what's planned for today
[46:38.360 --> 46:42.080]  what are the flash points going forward how do you do you see anything how do
[46:42.080 --> 46:45.600]  you say developing today well actually we've accomplished quite a bit today
[46:45.600 --> 46:54.400]  already at dawn we had around 20 cowboys go out on on the public land and we
[46:54.400 --> 46:59.000]  gathered about 30 head we did have a small confrontation with them but they
[46:59.000 --> 47:02.960]  didn't have enough forces to really do a whole lot they couldn't mobilize fast
[47:02.960 --> 47:06.040]  enough we were able to gather those cattle and get them to the ranch and
[47:06.040 --> 47:11.920]  they're branding the calves and stuff right now so we've already done some we
[47:11.920 --> 47:16.280]  have a lot of people here that it will be here protesting we also have our
[47:16.280 --> 47:21.520]  we're starting to get so the state to start realizing their responsibility so
[47:21.520 --> 47:25.360]  we have five state representatives that will be here addressing the people at
[47:25.360 --> 47:29.640]  five o'clock and so that's what's going on today let me ask you about the auction
[47:29.640 --> 47:33.200]  because there was news that they were going to try to auction off the cattle I
[47:33.200 --> 47:37.360]  saw something as we're playing out here I read that they had they were going to
[47:37.360 --> 47:41.320]  originally auction them off in Utah Utah said no what's the status of the auction
[47:41.320 --> 47:45.680]  the capital cattle that they wrestled so far well the they had paid the auction
[47:45.680 --> 47:48.880]  300,000 to take the cattle because obviously they must have known that
[47:48.880 --> 47:53.720]  there would be some commitment that the cattle they were not able to do that one
[47:53.720 --> 47:58.680]  is Utah's not allowing them to be transferred to to the to the auction
[47:58.680 --> 48:03.240]  yard and then they were opposed so heavily that if they continued it the
[48:03.240 --> 48:08.160]  auction yard would have gone out of business so we imagine and we don't know
[48:08.160 --> 48:11.280]  this for sure but we imagine that they're looking for other ways to set
[48:11.280 --> 48:16.320]  these cattle we don't know that the cattle have left the compound over here
[48:16.320 --> 48:21.960]  or not but we have we've actually have airplanes in the air finally we've been
[48:21.960 --> 48:25.760]  able to get airplanes in the air to confirm that and I haven't got that
[48:25.760 --> 48:33.240]  report our goal is to keep those cattle from leaving this area by the people's
[48:33.240 --> 48:37.320]  voice and then take them back let me ask you one last question if we got time
[48:37.320 --> 48:41.800]  Alex I was talking to your mother earlier and she said at the point there
[48:41.800 --> 48:45.680]  used to be 53 ranches right around here you're the last ranch in the area at the
[48:45.680 --> 48:49.880]  point where the 52 other ranches went out she said that they had reduced the
[48:49.880 --> 48:53.800]  herd allowable to something like 150 head and they were going to keep them off
[48:53.800 --> 48:57.920]  during the spring which is a prime time the calving time which is right now but
[48:57.920 --> 49:02.840]  also I thought it was very curious that these other 52 ranches were bought off by
[49:02.840 --> 49:07.360]  the state of Nevada not by the federal government is that correct by the county
[49:07.360 --> 49:12.440]  and yet you'll have to there's a lot to that but one is that proves that there
[49:12.440 --> 49:17.000]  was rights because the way it was the the federal government manipulated
[49:17.000 --> 49:21.280]  the the state and the county to buy those but then they recognized that there
[49:21.280 --> 49:25.440]  was rights and that they need to be purchased my dad did not sell which is
[49:25.440 --> 49:30.680]  an argument of they at one time they did recognize those rights now just to make
[49:30.680 --> 49:35.920]  it clear 53 ranchers did not sell many of them were pushed out regulated to the
[49:35.920 --> 49:41.320]  point that they could not survive others died and I mean by not not violent
[49:41.320 --> 49:49.040]  death but these are you know older men and they died young because they were the
[49:49.040 --> 49:54.000]  pressure and the anyway I just talked about a couple ranchers that actually
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.440]  died of heart attacks I mean this is a serious bill it's extremely stressful on
[49:57.440 --> 50:03.160]  a rancher the livelihood is very rough and to get them to to just survive in
[50:03.160 --> 50:11.080]  this without the the federal regulations is tough and then try to regulate be
[50:11.080 --> 50:14.520]  regulated out of business is makes it even rough we're going to break I want
[50:14.520 --> 50:17.640]  to come back to you ourselves that's reason to regulate we're going to break
[50:17.640 --> 50:21.320]  we'll be right back I want to come back and you're taking this having finished
[50:21.320 --> 50:24.400]  up we come back I know he's got to go but I want to get some final comments
[50:24.400 --> 50:28.480]  from him and also get what David Knight has to say but if he's got other
[50:28.480 --> 50:32.800]  interview let him go to that folks this is the extinction of a way of life this
[50:32.800 --> 50:36.760]  is the hunting down the harassment you really learn how predatory the government
[50:36.760 --> 50:41.360]  is when they've gotten 3% more of Nevada in just the last six seven years it's
[50:41.360 --> 50:47.720]  up to 90% now was 87 they want everything and if you got hearty people out in the
[50:47.720 --> 50:52.080]  desert that have been there for 140 years they want them gone they want you in
[50:52.080 --> 50:57.320]  the city drinking fluoride eating GMO this is off the charts evil

[54:33.120 --> 54:36.040]  the tea party people we're all the so-called land rights people well
[54:36.040 --> 54:39.400]  they're out there it's the middle of nowhere rifle and a four-wheel drive
[54:39.400 --> 54:47.120]  they want you to not be able to survive because you can't starve a sound and you
[54:47.120 --> 54:56.280]  can't make us run I can fly a field all day long I can catch catfish from dust
[54:56.280 --> 55:01.360]  no you can't the feds say they own it all and they're coming with men with guns
[55:01.600 --> 55:07.600]  make our own whiskey and our own smoke too ain't too many things these old boys
[55:07.600 --> 55:13.000]  can't do it's a country boy can survive
[55:13.000 --> 55:18.280]  we're grown good old maters and homemade wine and country boy can survive
[55:18.280 --> 55:23.400]  Worldwide people that are living on the land are being driven off because you can't
[55:23.400 --> 55:29.400]  starve them out and you can't make them run because you can't starve us out and
[55:29.400 --> 55:33.000]  you can't make them run those woods and mower boys raise them down
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.000]  You've got to go back to the land you've got to get more sufficient
[55:37.000 --> 55:42.000]  We say we say ma'am if you ain't into that we don't give a damn
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.000]  That's right if you're not into that look just go be a slave
[55:45.000 --> 55:52.000]  We came from the West Virginia coal mines and the rocky mountains and the western skies
[55:52.000 --> 55:58.000]  All right going back to David Knight out there with the ranchers and we're facing crazed goons
[55:58.000 --> 56:05.000]  David Knight I want to get final comments from Mr. Bundy and then I want to get your take on what you're seeing
[56:05.000 --> 56:11.000]  Well Alex Alex as you mentioned this is about rights and it's very sad to see this happening
[56:11.000 --> 56:17.000]  these people I'm reminded of the old days in old England you know when the Robin Hood stories with the sheriff
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.000]  and the king said that you couldn't go into the forest to get any food that's essentially what they're trying to do
[56:22.000 --> 56:27.000]  If they can run these people off of their land shut down the family business they've had for 140 years
[56:27.000 --> 56:34.000]  they can take your property as well whether you just have a suburban house they've probably got a much stronger title than you do
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  if you've been involved in some of these MERS situations
[56:37.000 --> 56:44.000]  Last comment here and where would you like to see this happen? What would be a good way for this to be resolved?
[56:44.000 --> 56:51.000]  Well it must be resolved by the state taking its sovereignty the state leadership the governor and the county leadership
[56:51.000 --> 56:57.000]  such as the county sheriff have to step in here and say no this is not correct this is not constitutional
[56:57.000 --> 57:06.000]  this land is Nevada state land and the laws of Nevada apply here this is not the territory the US territory
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.000]  Now so far the governor Republican Sandoval has been standing on the sideline ringing his hands
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.000]  but you do have some state reps that are going to show up this afternoon you think?
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.000]  We do and of course they're trying to influence the governor to get a backbone in this thing
[57:20.000 --> 57:27.000]  He's made a couple comments but he's going to have to answer these people and I hope he does
[57:27.000 --> 57:39.000]  we respect him we need him and we know that he can be a leader and we want him to lead and recognize his sovereignty here
[57:39.000 --> 57:43.000]  Well thank you very much and thank you for standing for our rights as well sorry this is happening to your family
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  Thank you, you appreciate it
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.000]  Alright and then later do a high def interview with him I want to ask him where his gut thinks he's going
[57:49.000 --> 57:55.000]  You're going to be interviewing his daddy I know we're going to have a guest on for an hour and a half Steve Quayle
[57:55.000 --> 58:01.000]  to cover the waterfront and then Steve will probably still be on with us when you're interviewing his dad
[58:01.000 --> 58:07.000]  they're live in the last 30 minutes today but I want to bring that up to him because these confrontations continue
[58:07.000 --> 58:15.000]  and this keeps going on I mean that's a big deal David that Tony Cowboys wrote out there and got some of the stolen cows back
[58:15.000 --> 58:18.000]  that's a big deal big defiance of the scum
[58:18.000 --> 58:25.000]  he is going to be whether people are going to stand together on this or whether they're going to let these people be taken down one at a time by a pack of federal wolves
[58:25.000 --> 58:28.000]  well that's it the wolves have already driven out the other 53 families
[58:28.000 --> 58:35.000]  they're already I mean all over America like a cancer they're shutting everything down every mine every field everything privately owned
[58:35.000 --> 58:50.000]  they are slitting this country's throat ear to ear right now
[58:50.000 --> 58:55.000]  why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare
[58:55.000 --> 59:01.000]  why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes autism
[59:01.000 --> 59:07.000]  and every other major disease it all comes down to one thing we are what we eat
[59:07.000 --> 59:12.000]  our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives
[59:12.000 --> 59:16.000]  our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff

[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  I come to you live from Austin Texas with helicopters and SWAT teams crawling all over the place
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  and highways shut down everywhere our crew went out and they're all laughing in there
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  so it must be powerful coming up if you're a TV viewer not just a radio listener
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  you're going to want to go to infowars.com for a slash show to see the free feed the nightly news and subscription
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  presentplanet.tv but they're saying we have incredible footage of Emperor Obama arriving
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  and they're all in there laughing and rubbing their bellies so this must be good I haven't seen this yet
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  they're loading it into the computer right now off the digital card so we're going to go to this video raw
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  just shot minutes ago as the imperial leader arrived in all of his pomp and circumstance
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  David Knight you're going to be back home with us in an hour and a half with Steve Quail
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  who's coming up but you're going to be interviewing Mr. Bundy, Clive and Bundy
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  other points you'd like to add about what we're seeing I mean this is history these ranchers are hard folks
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  it's a really hard life out there and they're serious people and they're really a relic
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  of what America used to be and you know they're just really showing restraint compared to what just
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  the World War II generation would do when you see the swagger and the attack dogs
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  and the hatred in the eyes of the BLM people these people I don't even hate them they are just
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  literally little boys working for evil who think they have the authority because they work for the
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  delegitimized occupied federal government. Alex it's all boils down to what
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  Ammon was just telling us about that 59 year old woman they came up on her from behind
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  they hip-checked her threw it to the ground and then jumped on her that's the kind of thuggery
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  that we're seeing here you're talking about a way of life dying these are the ranchers and farmers
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  from the 18th and 19th century. Notice the attack they thought was weakest first that is the essence
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  of cowardice and of being a low-life predator I mean I can't even get excited unless I'm outnumbered
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  in a fight with men and then it's pretty exciting you know and then I can really become a man
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  and I couldn't imagine assaulting a woman. You know as we were driving in Alex we went across
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  a cattle crossing a cattle guard that they put in the streets to keep the cattle out of the area
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  we're standing right across from a sign that has a warning about cows and said that says
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  that this is an open range this has been here a long time this family is not the interloper
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  everything though is changing this is 21st century America as Obama is coming in with his imperial
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  trappings you've got his gangs of thugs out here attacking people when they can get them separated
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  off as individuals we saw this happen at the open carry rally in San Antonio they were very respectable
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  when it was just about when it was about a thousand people there with guns slung over their shoulder
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  but as soon as the crowd started dispersing they started hassling individuals again.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  An instinctive hatred of their food an instinctive hatred of their food
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  not being sheep but actually becoming men again and again I don't want to indict the entire bureaucracy
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  it's been more honorable in the past it is now it's rotten it's like a rotten milk I mean
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  it's the apples are all going rotten listen I've got Steve Quill on who's always riveting and informative
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  and would say stuff ten years ago that I would just roll my eyes at that unfortunately has all come true
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  it's so great so wild he's gonna be almost like an hour and a half at least but I'm sure he's gonna want to get updates as well
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  so what about 40 after this hour unless you I know you're gonna do that interview after that
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  feel free to take us up to the line where the feds are at feel free to you know survey stuff feel free to be getting shots
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  we'll be having live feeds just a video only while right now we haven't seen any Alex we they were saying that
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  just right here if you look at how close these these butes are right here they said they had a bunch of snipers
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  just a few days ago but they were just trying to intimidate people they laughed about and they said
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  if that's as good a shot as the snipers are well they don't have anything to worry about but they're now
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  I haven't seen any yet we're going to drive around and see if we can find where the marking line is

[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:27.000]  well he is one of the biggest non-terrestrial radio hosts in the country in the world
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  Steve quail wrote about chemtrails 20 years ago he wrote about the genetic manipulation the plan to create genocide and transhumanism
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  15 16 17 years ago his new book I can't wait to read it gets into their master plan
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:51.000]  and really I look back over the years and I always thought he had a good heart and I knew a lot of what he was saying was documented
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  some of it was so far out I thought man you know this guy just just goes too far and unfortunately so much of what Steve quail continues to cover keeps turning out to be true
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  including military targeting of everyone's home in databases with GPS to your front door for drone attack
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:15.000]  he reported that five years before they admitted it mainstream news
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:25.000]  I mean it's just so crazy how criminal this system is by the way it's official just came across the news wires
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  we just saw it on Fox News scrolling house oversight committee officially holds lowest learner in contempt
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  there it is Republicans vote to hold former IRS official lowest learner in contempt of Congress
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  and let's scroll down a little bit more there is that a report they were going to vote or did they focus Fox said they did do it
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  Republicans on the house oversight and government reform committee voted on party lines today just minutes ago to hold in contempt of Congress
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  the former internal revenue service official at the heart of the agencies inappropriate inappropriate as pure Soviet style persecution
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  commissar garbage scrutiny of political non-profits that weren't anti-American basically this is the first congressional lawmaker
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  have acted to hold someone in contempt for asserting his or hers fifth amendment rights they're holding her in contempt because she goes out and makes statements publicly make statements after taking the fifth has been caught being a liar
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:29.000]  and they held holder in contempt in 2012 now they're looking at some type of congressional criminal charges which Congress can do
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  this is a real crisis for it and there are good people in Congress that's why you have the Republican Democratic leadership every time an inside leak comes out in the news mainstream news
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  they're worried about what the Tea Party they're worried about the military they're worried about Christians they're worried about rural communities
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  they're worried about libertarians they're worried about constitutionalist that just means people that are common sense and aren't for secret police and kids being taken from their parents for no reason
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:05.000]  and GMO and fluoride in the water and endless wars and funding al-Qaeda member when that was cookie when I talked about it 12 years ago now it's mainstream news
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  this is not our government this is criminal groups showing chaos against every nation to play us off against each other all the multinationals are above the law with diplomatic immunity now getting carbon taxes
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  Obamacare taxes are international tax to foreign banks is what Obamacare is IMF World Bank money I mean we are literally just like a third world country being sucked dry
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  and I want to get Steve quills take on the standoff in Nevada we saw 20 cowboys right across today and get 30 of the cows back at the feds are breaking the water pipes from the wells built 100 years ago
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  the family's been there for 144 years this is all unfolding right now ladies and gentlemen and the cowboys our guys have high death footage are going to be uploading tonight working really long hours
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  some of the incredible images that they've gotten from out there already were showing on screen but this is the last family of 53 ranches they've run out or bankrupted
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  and then you see all the signs about cattle crossings they have the surface and grazing rights and for folks that don't understand that I want to get Steve quills take on this first
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  then I want to get into the geopolitical war brewing next hour we're going to get into his new book that gets into what they cover in the movie Noah it's all in Genesis it's all in Leviticus
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  and it's what the elite what the elite are doing now is what the Bible says was done before and they're trying to play God ladies and gentlemen
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  and so we're going to cover it all with Steve quails Steve quail dot com Steve I'm very excited you also have a new Spanish site
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  I know you're really big in Latin America and we need to do this as well but tell us about your new Spanish site
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  well and for the record I'm learning Spanish very slowly Alex and I'm not you know I won't murder the name in Spanish but they can go on my website Steve quail dot com
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  and Timothy Alborino is a man who's lived in Peru for the majority of his life brilliant knows what's going on around the world
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  and especially in the area of the scientific finds that have to do with giants ancient civilizations he's so connected down there
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  and as you know that they found the giant skulls from Paracas and Timothy is updating it and we have a lady from Argentina who's probably one of the finest translators
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  so jennison6giant.com it's on my website about third of the way down the right hand side of the page it's in totally Spanish
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  and what I found Alex is the Latino and South American news beats have so many and Hispanic news beats have so much more truth and multiple
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  I'm talking thousands of eyewitnesses it's like once you hit the electronic frontier of the United States of America
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  it seems like everything is done to control people from understanding the truth so it's jennison6giant I guess I can't even try and pronounce it
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  but the bottom line is it's wonderful the editor is an amazing man and my translator Monica is an amazing translator
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  and these people have connections throughout the entire Hispanic and Latin communities and you know again we're going to translate back into English for good stuff
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  but thank you for mentioning that Alex because again there's so many people that need to know what we're talking about and quite candidly
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  you would be well advised to do the same thing because as they clamp down on us here they can't clamp down on us everywhere
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  absolutely and even mainstream news said those skulls which you've been obsessing on for 20 years in a good way are not really even human DNA
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  and this just gets weirder and weirder and I don't even know what to say anymore it's gotten so strange
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  we'll cover some of that in the next hour but Steve Quayle obviously we're not getting the whole history that the elite are actually aware of
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  we know the Alexandria library was not really destroyed we'll cover all that with you coming up
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  but Steve first off you have been one of the first survivalists ever even before you got into the Liberty Movement 20 years ago
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  I really one of the proto-leaders of the modern Liberty Movement today I'm not kissing your butt it's just true
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  and you've been there you've lived in the rural areas you've been off the grid I know you've seen the BLM siege
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  just running everybody off the land the general greenhorns out there let the mainstream media deceive them
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  and go this whole crazy man in Nevada says he owns land the federal government owns
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  in 1877 before it was even a territory his family went out there and they've got the water the surface and the grazing rights
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  at the state and it's on record and they tried to buy it from them 10 years ago the state did and the feds did
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  it's all on record so now they've just showed up with machine guns and are taking it and this assaults everybody
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  and that's why beef prices are exploding all of it because they're literally running people out of business everywhere even on their own land
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  my family cannot even break even in the cattle business now
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  so one of my good friends is one of the biggest producers in Texas they just sold one of their biggest herds and ranches
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  I mean because this country is being shut down under agenda 21 mafia tactics and then only big agribusiness is allowed to operate
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  Steve Quill what is this really all about and what do you think about what's happening in Nevada on the Bundy Ranch and the federal standoff
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  well first of all I sent to you Alex a story about 29 gas and oil leases that are going on in that part of the country
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  so you know when this sort of thing takes place somebody wants what's on the BLM land for their own use
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  and I think the Illuminati is in full rape, privilege and plunder mode
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  one of the hardest things for Americans to even get with remember when you and I were screaming about NAFTA
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  North American Free Trade Agreement, GAD, General Agreement of Trades and Terrorism and then Ross Perot says
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  a giant sucking sound of American jobs leaving the country and with it you know the middle class
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  what this is all about is resources and it's about being able to control everyone and everything
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  and it's also a test I believe this is a test to see how much the American people will stand up
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  when you lose your property rights you use everything and the Agenda 21 is in full play
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  and you know I curse the United Nations Agenda 21
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  if people don't understand that you have rights to land that for instance go back as far as all property rights
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  but see under the United Nations Agenda 21 you know this it is the board
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  if they don't want individuals having property rights and the last thing they want is anybody being able to sustain
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:48.000]  that's why they're shutting down farmers markets, lemonade stands, the ultimate sin is having a garden
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000]  the ultimate sin is not watching television all day
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  the ultimate sin is not breaking your family up
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  the ultimate sin is not just giving yourself over to the New World Order
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  it is absolutely the case and now what we're seeing Alex in full pledge
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  look I got so pissed let me use the word I'm sorry if it offends people
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  but they better be offended over watching dogs being pulled in and used to basically intimidate and terrorize
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000]  snipers placed against a man his wife and his kids
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  those snipers were in place before all the people started showing up
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  so I believe this is a test case to test the will of the American people to see what they'll stand up for
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:33.000]  now I placed a call I won't tell you to who but someone's very well connected in the political field down there
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  very very well connected with the governor himself
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  and I said do you have to tell these people to take a stand
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  I said if you don't at this point I'm talking to governor I'm talking to senators
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  obviously we don't expect Harry Reid and the Democrats to do anything
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  but the bottom line is that this is about life and death Alex that's what I think you've tried to do
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  you've done all your producing of all your videos all the thousands tens of thousands of hours you've been on the radio
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  it's now coming home to people the price of beef is as you know you've got cattle farming in your family
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.000]  cattle raising the point is we're at all time highs it hasn't been this high ever
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  and what four bucks a pound per ground beef around the country
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  but more than that we've got a pig virus now introduced
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  just for the record I believe it's a biological weapon against the people that raise pork raise pigs
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  and the point is that we've got all these things going on simultaneously
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  so we are seeing right now in Nevada I believe the actual outplay of what will be across the entire country
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  unless people hold their politicians to their feet to the fire and say we will not stand
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  for American citizens having guard dogs and tasers
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  I think the tasers are defrauding
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  oh they're attacking women stay there Steve Cuell we're going to come right back I'm Alex Jones
