[00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.773]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.773 --> 00:00:11.355]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:12.896]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:17.100]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.163]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.685]  It is Thursday, the 10th day of April 2014.
[00:00:38.685 --> 00:00:40.828]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.828 --> 00:00:44.071]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:48.796]  Always informative, Steve Quayle is going to be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:54.462]  And coming up in the last 30 minutes of the transmission, we have Mr. Bundy out in
[00:00:55.777 --> 00:01:10.838]  Nevada, who is saying that as soon as they get enough people, they're going to mass together and peacefully walk across the public land to where they've got the 300 cows they've stolen from them, the BLM, and take them back.
[00:01:11.818 --> 00:01:16.420]  And of course the Feds have snipers, armored vehicles, helicopters out there.
[00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.002]  The best place to see the full reportage is at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:23.483]  And DrudgeReport.com has a link at the top.
[00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:27.885]  Our latest story, standoff at Nevada Ranch.
[00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:36.729]  Now we have Mr. Bundy calling for the Sheriff to arrest the BLM Feds.
[00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.510]  And we've got the Governor going public.
[00:01:39.508 --> 00:01:43.349]  Saying it's intimidation and that Bundy's following state law.
[00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:44.109]  And we've got U.S.
[00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:50.071]  Senators, multiple Senators now, one in Nevada and another coming out saying this is wrong.
[00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:52.211]  But see, these are lawyers.
[00:01:52.211 --> 00:02:00.233]  So they know what grazing rights are, what forage rights are, what squatters' rights are from 1877.
[00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:04.174]  That his particular family has.
[00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:19.619]  All over the world, indigenous groups, or groups that have been there for hundreds of years, have the right to land, even if some government later declares that it's a... I mean, 90% of Nevada, I kept saying 87, it's down 90%, is federal.
[00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:21.899]  Another 5-6% is state.
[00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:24.540]  Less than 5% total is private.
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.420]  And can you imagine living in a state like that?
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.901]  And your family was there before it was even a territory?
[00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:33.602]  And they won't eat and suddenly let you have your cattle on the property?
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.840]  And this is the imperious nature of government.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.421]  By the way, as I speak, there are helicopters swarming overhead.
[00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:42.622]  We'll have this later in the show.
[00:02:42.622 --> 00:02:48.183]  On I-35 and other roads, there's police everywhere.
[00:02:48.183 --> 00:02:55.464]  My reporters were down the street because Obama's set to go by on his motorcade at the Civil Rights Conference here in Austin today.
[00:02:55.464 --> 00:03:02.146]  And I was coming into work and saw my reporters on the side of the road, on a sidewalk.
[00:03:04.414 --> 00:03:06.295]  Being yelled at.
[00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:10.757]  Being yelled at.
[00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:15.318]  By the police for daring to set up cameras on a sidewalk.
[00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:18.420]  Not on the highway, but on the front of a truck.
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.941]  You don't do that when the emperor comes around.
[00:03:20.941 --> 00:03:23.742]  It's such a joke for this criminal nobody for any president.
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:34.022]  Helicopters and shutting down major highways and shutting down the entrance ramps and cops bugging their eyes out like the second coming of Christ has happened.
[00:03:34.022 --> 00:03:38.303]  It's all about red carpets and Air Force One and this is the king.
[00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:40.444]  It's the opposite of what a free society would have.
[00:03:40.444 --> 00:03:43.664]  You see this pompous circumstance in every authoritarian regime.
[00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:45.865]  The old Soviet regimes, North Korea,
[00:03:47.284 --> 00:03:50.246]  I mean, this is not the hallmark of a free society.
[00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:52.828]  So we've got that backdrop going on.
[00:03:52.828 --> 00:03:55.870]  Obama to give keynote at Summit today.
[00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.491]  The Civil Rights Summit.
[00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:05.116]  They mean the race-baiting, racial division summit at the LBJ Library Presidential Center.
[00:04:05.116 --> 00:04:11.460]  And Nancy Pelosi says Republicans are stalling on immigration reform because of racial issues, likens it
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.922]  The Japanese being put in internment camps in World War II.
[00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:24.586]  If we don't let unlimited illegals in to then be given free welfare and citizenship to then vote to make us the slave of the criminal Nancy Pelosi, we're racist.
[00:04:24.586 --> 00:04:30.770]  And if you don't like Obamacare, you heard the big baseball player come out yesterday and say you're a racist.
[00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.750]  You're KKK, actually.
[00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.731]  And if you like guns, you're KKK.
[00:04:34.144 --> 00:04:35.204]  That's the talking point.
[00:04:35.204 --> 00:04:37.325]  And of course they all know that's not true.
[00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:41.967]  It's about political dominance using guilt on people that have done nothing.
[00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:42.888]  So that's all coming up.
[00:04:42.888 --> 00:04:56.693]  Speaking of doing something to the guilty, Congress is now doing their job calling for the arrest of Lois Lerner for her criminal persecution of anyone right of Satan.
[00:04:56.693 --> 00:04:57.234]  This is big.
[00:04:57.234 --> 00:04:57.914]  That's coming up as well.
[00:05:00.109 --> 00:05:04.151]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:08.513]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:05:08.513 --> 00:05:12.174]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:05:12.174 --> 00:05:15.176]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:05:15.176 --> 00:05:22.779]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:26.421]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:31.106]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:05:31.106 --> 00:05:37.093]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:05:37.093 --> 00:05:41.137]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:05:41.137 --> 00:05:43.760]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.102]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:05:45.242 --> 00:05:46.623]  It's time to take action.
[00:05:46.623 --> 00:05:48.444]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:07.732]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[00:06:07.732 --> 00:06:10.095]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[00:06:10.095 --> 00:06:15.440]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.546]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[00:06:20.666 --> 00:06:24.067]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:28.188]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:32.589]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:42.932]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[00:06:42.932 --> 00:06:47.413]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA.
[00:06:47.413 --> 00:06:49.834]  The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here.
[00:06:49.994 --> 00:06:58.677]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[00:07:10.822 --> 00:07:17.908]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:07:17.908 --> 00:07:22.792]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:29.578]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:29.578 --> 00:07:36.644]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:07:36.744 --> 00:07:43.769]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:07:43.769 --> 00:07:48.252]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:07:48.252 --> 00:07:57.959]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:07:57.959 --> 00:07:59.620]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:18.055 --> 00:08:24.566]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:26.069]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:08:36.334 --> 00:08:41.238]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this April 10th, Thursday, worldwide transmission.
[00:08:41.238 --> 00:09:02.153]  I come to you from Austin, Texas, where the sky is filled with federal helicopters, army helicopters, green helicopters, black helicopters, and green and white Marine One circling around, while they also block major highways hours ahead of the great Führer.
[00:09:03.273 --> 00:09:11.340]  And leader, who I guess now has arrived, our Lord and Savior, according to Jamie Foxx, Barack Obama.
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:24.790]  Barack Obama, ladies and gentlemen, whose Attorney General is acting as a dictator and ignoring Congress on their subpoenas on Fast and Furious, Benghazi, the list goes on and on.
[00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.613]  But, the dam is beginning to break.
[00:09:27.613 --> 00:09:31.696]  Yesterday, we aired the clips of two different congressmen,
[00:09:33.049 --> 00:09:46.419]  From Texas, basically saying that Eric Holder should be arrested for ignoring their federal subpoena.
[00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:54.905]  And he threatened back to Gohmert, Louie Gohmert of Texas, you don't want to go there buddy, was pointing his finger at him very menacingly.
[00:09:54.905 --> 00:09:58.448]  So this is a criminal takeover that's going on.
[00:09:58.448 --> 00:09:59.629]  The good news is that
[00:10:01.016 --> 00:10:10.380]  Real libertarian-style Tea Party Republicans are now understanding there's a total takeover taking place if they don't stand up against this criminal action.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:20.303]  I mean, Obama conservatively has done, let's not exaggerate, I don't know, 30, 40 times what Nixon did unconstitutional?
[00:10:20.303 --> 00:10:21.164]  And it's all naked.
[00:10:21.164 --> 00:10:25.825]  I mean, they've already basically stolen the farm.
[00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:27.026]  They've already done everything.
[00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:29.451]  And now they don't get in trouble.
[00:10:29.451 --> 00:10:30.833]  Katie barred the door.
[00:10:30.833 --> 00:10:32.434]  Here's the Hill newspaper.
[00:10:32.434 --> 00:10:35.637]  GOP calls for Lerner's prosecution.
[00:10:35.637 --> 00:10:53.593]  House Ways and Means Committee yesterday accused former IRS official, not servant, Lois Lerner, of targeting the prominent GOP group, Crossroads, GPS, and urged the Justice Department to take a fresh look at whether she should be prosecuted.
[00:10:54.585 --> 00:10:58.108]  And I guess they're only going after that because it's got Karl Rove involved in it.
[00:10:58.108 --> 00:11:02.972]  So see, it's the real Republican establishment is also getting upset because they've actually been messed with now.
[00:11:02.972 --> 00:11:11.720]  They're like, hey, we're supposed to just share power here and bring in NAFTA and GATT and the New World Order and the police state and Obamacare and act like, well, you know, we're fighting.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.320]  What are you doing?
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.462]  You're trying to get rid of us completely.
[00:11:14.462 --> 00:11:19.787]  That's what the founders put the separation of powers in, knowing you'd have different criminal groups dividing the legislative.
[00:11:20.782 --> 00:11:37.250]  Dividing the judicial, you know, that divided up with the states, the people dividing it up with juries and grand juries, and then the executive they were always worried about becoming a dictatorship, so that was bound down by the Constitution and the fact that it was given its orders by Congress, then the President executes.
[00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:45.834]  Now the President is operating and the bureaucracy is operating, teamed up as if they're king, they've kind of bought off the Congress, who's now figuring out they've become ceremonial
[00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:53.865]  And won't matter soon if they don't wake up, and new Libertarian Tea Party types have gotten in as a moral compass.
[00:11:53.865 --> 00:12:02.213]  They're not perfect, but they're not absolute, you know, authoritarian status that want to extinct all freedom.
[00:12:02.213 --> 00:12:08.879]  And I know a lot of these Congress people on and off air, and a lot of them are more hardcore than I am, they just won't say it on air.
[00:12:09.676 --> 00:12:11.217]  A lot of them are listening right now.
[00:12:11.217 --> 00:12:13.077]  They know what I'm saying is true.
[00:12:13.077 --> 00:12:25.801]  And I'm not taking credit for InfoWars, it's just that we've decompartmentalized a lot of stuff, where people that are in Congress go, wow, it's true, this has been going on all along, and they see how real all this is, and they give us intel as well.
[00:12:25.801 --> 00:12:28.562]  And that really scares the system.
[00:12:28.562 --> 00:12:31.103]  So GOP calls for learners, prosecution.
[00:12:32.122 --> 00:12:36.025]  House Republicans won't rule out arresting Lois Lerner if Justice Department doesn't.
[00:12:36.025 --> 00:12:38.306]  That's absolutely beautiful.
[00:12:38.306 --> 00:12:50.395]  House Ways and Means Committee Republicans aren't ruling out the use of Chamber's inherent contempt authority if Attorney General Eric Holder refuses to act on the people's accusations against former IRS official Lois Lerner.
[00:12:51.115 --> 00:13:00.344]  The committee voted Wednesday to seek an investigation into whether Lerner violated federal law by using her power to ensure right-leaning groups were targeted for extra scrutiny by the agency.
[00:13:00.344 --> 00:13:01.965]  The Democrats admit they did that.
[00:13:01.965 --> 00:13:07.550]  Not one Democrat or Communist or Socialist group was targeted.
[00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.572]  George Soros can insider trade all day.
[00:13:09.572 --> 00:13:11.394]  He doesn't get in trouble with the SEC.
[00:13:11.394 --> 00:13:14.817]  So can the Democratic, you know, former governor of New Jersey, Corzine.
[00:13:14.817 --> 00:13:16.699]  I mean, these people are above the law, folks.
[00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:24.641]  And remember Cummings acting like he was all mad at the committees when she took the 5th a few weeks ago and saying how dare him not be able to ask questions?
[00:13:24.641 --> 00:13:25.362]  She took the 5th.
[00:13:25.362 --> 00:13:28.284]  That means you can't talk then once you take it.
[00:13:28.284 --> 00:13:32.587]  But she says, I take the 5th, so, and then she puts out lies.
[00:13:32.587 --> 00:13:34.769]  She's done that before.
[00:13:34.769 --> 00:13:37.271]  Cummings, using the public's ignorance, acted like ism.
[00:13:39.737 --> 00:13:41.858]  Well, of course it turns out now.
[00:13:41.858 --> 00:13:50.804]  It's being reported on the Washington Free Beacon.
[00:13:50.804 --> 00:13:53.166]  They're all in on it.
[00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.607]  Elijah Cummings.
[00:13:54.607 --> 00:13:56.368]  All of them.
[00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:58.289]  This is a mafia group, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:58.289 --> 00:14:02.172]  They're going after everyone at a level never before seen.
[00:14:02.172 --> 00:14:04.994]  Arresting filmmakers.
[00:14:04.994 --> 00:14:06.115]  Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:14:06.115 --> 00:14:06.975]  Arresting governors.
[00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:13.272]  For taking donations from a supplement company.
[00:14:13.272 --> 00:14:14.252]  I mean, I looked at it.
[00:14:14.252 --> 00:14:15.913]  It's not even legal.
[00:14:15.913 --> 00:14:18.954]  But it was a little untoward.
[00:14:18.954 --> 00:14:29.238]  So the governor of Virginia would whisper it, you know, with his friends at dinner about how when he got out of office, he was going to go work for a supplement company.
[00:14:29.238 --> 00:14:32.760]  And how he was an exercise aficionado.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.120]  And, you know, how much he loved the supplements.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.002]  And so because he acted like it was something he was trying to hide,
[00:14:39.195 --> 00:14:40.796]  They acted like that was illegal.
[00:14:40.796 --> 00:14:45.180]  Again, they use the ignorance, like they tell you it's the law to take vaccines, it's not.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:55.269]  Or they tell you that this rancher is out there stealing land when the governor's now come out and said, no, it's state law.
[00:14:55.269 --> 00:15:01.995]  And the feds are just, and the feds are arresting people who collect rainwater in
[00:15:03.592 --> 00:15:07.714]  Places like Michigan and Oregon.
[00:15:07.714 --> 00:15:09.055]  I have the articles here in front of me.
[00:15:09.055 --> 00:15:10.895]  I'm going to play a report later about that.
[00:15:10.895 --> 00:15:13.897]  They're coming after everyone.
[00:15:13.897 --> 00:15:15.238]  It's the Green Police.
[00:15:15.238 --> 00:15:16.738]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:15:16.738 --> 00:15:17.559]  It's feudalism.
[00:15:17.559 --> 00:15:19.780]  Control of everything.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.280]  90% of Nevada.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.381]  I was incorrect.
[00:15:21.381 --> 00:15:22.361]  I was saying 97.
[00:15:22.361 --> 00:15:25.643]  Since that 6, 7, 8 year old number, it's now 90%.
[00:15:25.643 --> 00:15:26.983]  They've gotten that much more.
[00:15:26.983 --> 00:15:30.265]  They're just grabbing it or buying it or forcing people off of it.
[00:15:31.308 --> 00:15:35.270]  The state has 5%, that's 95% is government.
[00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.251]  Can the people have 5%?
[00:15:37.251 --> 00:15:38.371]  The answer is no.
[00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:47.436]  And we've got David Knight and Josh Owens on the ground with a video Skype feed from
[00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:56.765]  The state of Nevada, they're in Mopa Valley, in the town, and they're going to be at the town hall meetings, all of it.
[00:15:56.765 --> 00:16:00.547]  We've got clips of Cliven Bundy, who's on the last 30 minutes of the show today.
[00:16:00.547 --> 00:16:04.890]  We're going to do a live Skype interview with him.
[00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:18.397]  Yesterday, the feds came out, and this is all on video at InfoWars.com, it's linked up at DrudgeReport.com, top link, and began tasering and beating and bloodying and beating people.
[00:16:19.226 --> 00:16:21.547]  Who did nothing, and it's a classic Fed move.
[00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:32.370]  They go, somebody around here earlier bumped one of our cars, so we're going to just taser and attack everybody as a brutal criminal assault to intimidate more people showing up.
[00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.411]  The answer to this is for people to show up, more media to show up.
[00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:37.932]  We reported this over a week ago.
[00:16:37.932 --> 00:16:39.252]  Drudge picked it up.
[00:16:39.252 --> 00:16:41.313]  Now it's all over Fox News.
[00:16:41.313 --> 00:16:42.733]  It's all over Glenn Beck.
[00:16:42.733 --> 00:16:44.394]  It's all over Sean Hannity.
[00:16:44.394 --> 00:16:48.395]  Now it's being covered by the largest media outlets in the United States.
[00:16:50.362 --> 00:16:58.914]  And, you know, MSNBC and others want to act like they're the dominant media with a half million views, top, with Glenn Beck with, you know, six, seven, eight million listeners a day.
[00:17:01.132 --> 00:17:06.737]  Michael Savage with 6, 7, 8 million listeners and viewers a day.
[00:17:06.737 --> 00:17:10.360]  Rush Limbaugh with 10, 12 million listeners a day.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.442]  This show with 3 million terrestrial listeners a day.
[00:17:13.442 --> 00:17:16.344]  Millions on the internet, in the aggregate, conservatively.
[00:17:16.344 --> 00:17:18.326]  15 million a week total.
[00:17:18.326 --> 00:17:20.988]  Limbaugh 25 million a week, 22 million a week.
[00:17:20.988 --> 00:17:23.490]  Lindbeck, you know, 20 million a week.
[00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:24.391]  All these shows.
[00:17:24.391 --> 00:17:26.573]  Coast to Coast again with 16 million a week covering it.
[00:17:28.374 --> 00:17:35.358]  MSNBC and CNN with half a million viewers on their top shows, oh, they set the reality and are demonizing it.
[00:17:35.358 --> 00:17:46.983]  So we're going to go to David Knight and find out what he's got coming up on this, but more people are getting there, and the answer is, I believe the Gandhi approach is to just walk through and show it's the people's land.
[00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:49.184]  Now remember, this isn't even a national park.
[00:17:49.184 --> 00:17:50.945]  This is 9% of the state.
[00:17:50.945 --> 00:17:52.766]  His family's been there since 1877.
[00:17:52.766 --> 00:17:55.708]  They have the, quote, surface rights and forage rights.
[00:17:56.676 --> 00:17:59.838]  The water rights and the forage rights.
[00:17:59.838 --> 00:18:01.499]  Unequivocal, folks.
[00:18:01.499 --> 00:18:03.860]  My family are big landowners since 1829.
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.503]  We still hold land, 1829 Mexican land grants, so I know all about this.
[00:18:08.503 --> 00:18:12.465]  And the governor's come out and said this is intimidation, this is wrong, he's following state law.
[00:18:12.465 --> 00:18:25.232]  Now we're going to go to break and come back with David Knight in the Skype link there, but first I want to play a clip of Cliven Bundy speaking at the Moapa Valley Town Hall meeting.
[00:18:26.502 --> 00:18:30.684]  And even the town hall has big banners up about the defense of private property.
[00:18:30.684 --> 00:18:33.825]  And he says the sheriff needs to arrest the feds.
[00:18:33.825 --> 00:18:36.326]  And folks, all it's going to take is a sheriff.
[00:18:36.326 --> 00:18:48.651]  This isn't like, you know, the civil rights movement where some of the states were out of line and Eisenhower sent in, you know, federal marshals and the army to open up schools where the moral high ground was on the side of the feds, the balance of power.
[00:18:48.651 --> 00:18:50.752]  This is the people having their land rights taken.
[00:18:52.367 --> 00:18:57.651]  And now if the Feds push and try to save folks from terrorists in this, they're going to lose the moral high ground.
[00:18:57.651 --> 00:18:59.072]  So this is the time to push.
[00:18:59.072 --> 00:19:00.773]  I don't want violence.
[00:19:00.773 --> 00:19:05.636]  But this could be the shot heard around the world if the Feds, the snipers, shoot somebody.
[00:19:05.636 --> 00:19:08.258]  And I'm worried, you know, there are real unstable people out there, too.
[00:19:08.258 --> 00:19:09.339]  They're sick of being pushed around.
[00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:12.381]  You know, there could be somebody really go after the Feds out there.
[00:19:13.072 --> 00:19:15.994]  And I mean, I don't want anything to happen to a bunch of idiot BLM people.
[00:19:15.994 --> 00:19:16.654]  They're morons.
[00:19:16.654 --> 00:19:22.957]  They're dishonorable idiots who think that their authority is the authorization to be involuntary.
[00:19:22.957 --> 00:19:25.279]  Let's go out to break with Mr. Bundy.
[00:19:26.021 --> 00:19:29.602]  Now remember what I told you about who owns this land?
[00:19:29.602 --> 00:19:30.903]  Who owns this land?
[00:19:30.903 --> 00:19:31.983]  We do!
[00:19:31.983 --> 00:19:33.223]  Who are you?
[00:19:33.223 --> 00:19:36.124]  Clark County!
[00:19:36.124 --> 00:19:39.045]  Okay, you're the citizens of Clark County, Nevada.
[00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:40.406]  You own this land.
[00:19:40.406 --> 00:19:42.607]  This is your public land.
[00:19:42.607 --> 00:19:48.969]  And so I ask the question here tonight, is United States government trespassing on your land?
[00:19:50.979 --> 00:19:53.021]  Okay, let's ask the question again.
[00:19:53.021 --> 00:19:56.304]  Is Clive and Bundy trespassing on your land?
[00:19:56.304 --> 00:19:56.944]  No!
[00:19:56.944 --> 00:19:58.445]  Alright, we're on a break.
[00:19:58.445 --> 00:19:58.926]  Stay with us.
[00:20:00.919 --> 00:20:04.520]  How can you save a ton of money and prepare for emergencies?
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.741]  By having your own in-home freeze dryer from Harvest Rite.
[00:20:07.741 --> 00:20:11.722]  Now you can cut down on wasted food by freeze drying your leftovers.
[00:20:11.722 --> 00:20:12.463]  That's right!
[00:20:12.463 --> 00:20:20.905]  Create your own long-term food storage by freeze drying your own fruits, meats, vegetables, even complete meals with the Harvest Rite in-home freeze dryer.
[00:20:20.905 --> 00:20:23.686]  Imagine the savings and the peace of mind!
[00:20:23.686 --> 00:20:28.248]  See how the amazing Harvest Rite freeze dryer works at HarvestRite.com
[00:20:29.775 --> 00:20:39.082]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.082 --> 00:20:39.883]  This capitalism?
[00:20:39.883 --> 00:20:46.047]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.047 --> 00:20:49.750]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.670]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:52.412]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:52.412 --> 00:20:52.672]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.063 --> 00:21:01.064]  Hi there.
[00:21:01.064 --> 00:21:02.605]  My name is Frank Bates.
[00:21:02.605 --> 00:21:06.428]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[00:21:06.428 --> 00:21:15.575]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[00:21:15.575 --> 00:21:22.300]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.462]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[00:21:24.462 --> 00:21:29.566]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[00:21:30.286 --> 00:21:38.231]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[00:21:38.231 --> 00:21:43.794]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[00:21:43.794 --> 00:21:50.298]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[00:21:50.298 --> 00:21:56.021]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:57.162]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[00:21:58.971 --> 00:22:02.334]  Do you want to feel awesome all day long?
[00:22:02.334 --> 00:22:09.380]  Do you want to sleep so good you wake up feeling awesome, the way you did when you were a kid?
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:14.264]  Feel awesome with no caffeine, just awesome tasting nutrition.

[00:22:28.654 --> 00:22:30.035]  Attention gun owners.
[00:22:30.035 --> 00:22:34.638]  It's reasonable to assume that at some point you may need to defend your family from an armed attack.
[00:22:34.838 --> 00:22:38.541]  But is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong offense?
[00:22:38.541 --> 00:22:40.903]  Infidel Body Armor goes on in seconds.
[00:22:40.903 --> 00:22:43.326]  Is civilian legal in all 50 states.

[00:22:49.491 --> 00:22:52.153]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.

[00:22:55.116 --> 00:22:56.818]  Infidel Body Armor.
[00:22:56.818 --> 00:22:58.019]  Just won't quit.
[00:22:58.447 --> 00:23:01.288]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:23:01.288 --> 00:23:06.390]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:14.512]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:23:14.512 --> 00:23:19.034]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:23:19.034 --> 00:23:22.835]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:23:23.015 --> 00:23:28.958]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:23:28.958 --> 00:23:32.120]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:37.503]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:23:37.503 --> 00:23:45.667]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:23:45.667 --> 00:23:45.867]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:54.832]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[00:23:54.832 --> 00:24:11.866]  BuyPatriotsupply.com slash Alex.
[00:24:11.866 --> 00:24:16.730]  Is it getting better?
[00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.613]  Or do you feel the same?
[00:24:19.613 --> 00:24:20.854]  We have a bankrupt
[00:24:22.262 --> 00:24:27.925]  Financially and culturally system.
[00:24:27.925 --> 00:24:32.987]  We have a bankrupt federal government run by foreign banks that want people off the public land.
[00:24:32.987 --> 00:24:48.034]  The federal government's got more than half the land in this country, upwards of 80% of the land out west, 90% of Nevada, and they don't want people using the open range that predates fences coming in in the 1870s and 1880s.
[00:24:51.181 --> 00:24:54.722]  In Mexico, in all the national parks.
[00:24:54.722 --> 00:24:59.523]  I've been to a couple big ones that have big rolling hills and grass and desert.
[00:24:59.523 --> 00:25:06.945]  There's sheep and cows, folks, and the people aren't paying to be on it because they've always been there and they have the grazing rights to it.
[00:25:06.945 --> 00:25:14.147]  One reason Mexico City's gotten so huge is that in southern Mexico, the only area that was able to stop it was the Chiapas area.
[00:25:14.147 --> 00:25:17.888]  But all the other areas, they force everybody off their land because they didn't have deeds to it.
[00:25:17.888 --> 00:25:19.729]  They've been there for thousands of years.
[00:25:22.295 --> 00:25:23.136]  It's the same thing.
[00:25:23.136 --> 00:25:29.541]  All over the world, the globalists, the UN, under Agenda 21, is forcing rural populations off land.
[00:25:29.541 --> 00:25:32.044]  And if you own the land, they're going to come take it from you.
[00:25:32.044 --> 00:25:33.605]  With regulations and taxes.
[00:25:33.605 --> 00:25:47.177]  Now, I take you now live to Nevada, right there on the border with Arizona, with the sixth-generation family, and we have Ammon Bundy, the son
[00:25:49.854 --> 00:25:53.498]  of the rancher who's been standing up, Cliven Bundy.
[00:25:53.498 --> 00:25:59.504]  But first is David Knight giving us a report on what he's seen since he got there.
[00:25:59.504 --> 00:26:01.286]  David Knight reporting.
[00:26:01.286 --> 00:26:04.710]  David, thanks for coming on and thanks for going out there.
[00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:05.331]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:06.532]  We're here at the protest area.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:07.820]  And I've got M.M.
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:08.841]  Bundy standing right next to me.
[00:26:08.841 --> 00:26:17.085]  You know, you were talking about people being tasered last night, and there was some real brutal things that happened there, but I want to let him tell you why they were there.
[00:26:17.085 --> 00:26:18.746]  As you mentioned before, this is about rights.
[00:26:18.746 --> 00:26:24.609]  If they can take their grazing rights, if they can take their water rights, they can take your rights, your property rights, at your home.
[00:26:25.129 --> 00:26:29.151]  So, if you're not a rancher, you don't know any ranchers because they're going out of business left and right.
[00:26:29.151 --> 00:26:34.213]  And this is a small family business that's been here for over about 140 years.
[00:26:34.213 --> 00:26:37.074]  And let me let you hear from Em and what happened last night.
[00:26:37.074 --> 00:26:39.275]  He was one of the people that got tasered last night.
[00:26:39.275 --> 00:26:40.596]  Em, tell us what happened last night.
[00:26:42.355 --> 00:26:49.239]  Well, just to set the area, they've got this land, around 600,000 acres, completely locked down.
[00:26:49.239 --> 00:26:51.400]  If you step off the road, they arrest you.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:58.304]  And they don't just be nice about it, they knock you on the ground, rub your face in the ground, handcuff you, and take you off.
[00:26:58.304 --> 00:26:59.285]  That's how they're doing it.
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:06.603]  Um, so they literally by force have, uh, closed this land off and have occupied it.
[00:27:06.603 --> 00:27:09.224]  And one more thing to set the setting here.
[00:27:09.224 --> 00:27:22.329]  If almost every wash and every Canyon, if you will, here and every road has either an agent on it or has a camera in it to make sure that people are obedient to what they say.
[00:27:22.329 --> 00:27:25.831]  And, uh, anyway, and, and I'm not exaggerating that one bit.
[00:27:25.831 --> 00:27:27.231]  Okay.
[00:27:27.231 --> 00:27:29.012]  So yesterday we, we've been.
[00:27:30.173 --> 00:27:36.439]  We've already had citizens run to the ground and arrested.
[00:27:36.439 --> 00:27:47.630]  So the other day, and I'll just tell you two incidences, the other day we had a citizen, a 16-year-old boy that pulled off here where he's been his whole life, went down to the river here.
[00:27:49.049 --> 00:27:53.974]  And we saw about five or six of their agents or vehicles go down there.
[00:27:53.974 --> 00:27:58.558]  And so we rushed over there to protect him because of what happened before.
[00:27:58.558 --> 00:28:01.621]  And they were on their way to doing the exact same thing to him.
[00:28:01.621 --> 00:28:09.469]  And we, we had to, you know, basically push them off this 16 year old boy to get him to and protect him.
[00:28:09.469 --> 00:28:10.750]  And they, we did back them down.
[00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.692]  There was about 40 of us then.
[00:28:13.944 --> 00:28:18.469]  Uh, yesterday where most of the activity that's got a lot of news here.
[00:28:18.469 --> 00:28:24.876]  The way it started is they came down off this mountain and there was 16 or excuse me, 14 units.
[00:28:24.876 --> 00:28:31.123]  And, uh, one of them was a, uh, a dump truck with a backhoe on a trailer behind it.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:39.727]  And the other 13 units were protection units, heavily armed for this dump truck and this backhoe.
[00:28:39.727 --> 00:28:43.951]  And we saw them come off this hill, so we took the opportunity to protest them.
[00:28:43.951 --> 00:28:48.856]  But we also felt that it was crucial that we understood what in the world was in the back of that dump truck.
[00:28:50.158 --> 00:28:55.280]  Uh, they've been chasing these cattle all over this country and it's been a hot, hot year so far.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.641]  It was over 90 degrees already.
[00:28:57.641 --> 00:29:01.843]  And these cattle can't run very long before they overheat and it'll kill them.
[00:29:01.843 --> 00:29:06.505]  Also, we know that they've been separating these, these mothers from their calves.
[00:29:06.505 --> 00:29:08.706]  This is calving season for us right now.
[00:29:08.706 --> 00:29:11.667]  So they're separating these young calves from their mothers.
[00:29:11.667 --> 00:29:16.209]  And we are seeing cattle, uh, that have tight bags, meaning where are their calves?
[00:29:16.209 --> 00:29:18.890]  Their calves are separated, you know, lying under a bush.
[00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:23.233]  Getting ready to die or dying.
[00:29:23.233 --> 00:29:27.055]  So anyway, we wanted to know what was in the bag.
[00:29:27.055 --> 00:29:28.316]  Tell him to stay there!
[00:29:28.316 --> 00:29:29.297]  Stay there, we're going to break.
[00:29:29.297 --> 00:29:30.898]  Hang on, stay there, we're going to go to break.
[00:29:30.898 --> 00:29:33.099]  He's going to come back and finish the story.
[00:29:33.099 --> 00:29:39.483]  And there's video at InfoWars.com where they taser him and blood and everything and slamming women's heads in the ground.
[00:29:39.483 --> 00:29:42.405]  And imagine, 600,000 acres, everybody's always gone on it.
[00:29:42.405 --> 00:29:44.086]  Locals don't even know what's going on.
[00:29:44.086 --> 00:29:46.028]  You step on it, here come federal killers.
[00:29:49.076 --> 00:29:52.079]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.079 --> 00:29:55.682]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.623 --> 00:30:11.307]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:30:11.307 --> 00:30:13.388]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:30:13.388 --> 00:30:14.268]  Fluoride!
[00:30:14.268 --> 00:30:16.189]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:16.189 --> 00:30:22.491]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:30:22.751 --> 00:30:27.677]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:30:27.677 --> 00:30:34.003]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:30:34.003 --> 00:30:36.426]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:30:36.426 --> 00:30:39.349]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:30:39.349 --> 00:30:42.733]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[00:31:00.735 --> 00:31:08.838]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[00:31:08.838 --> 00:31:11.079]  All the major networks are state-run.
[00:31:11.079 --> 00:31:13.780]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.122]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[00:31:18.122 --> 00:31:21.203]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[00:31:21.303 --> 00:31:28.833]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:31:28.833 --> 00:31:33.159]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[00:31:33.159 --> 00:31:34.961]  We are the true media.
[00:31:34.961 --> 00:31:37.565]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[00:31:37.625 --> 00:31:41.387]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[00:32:00.615 --> 00:32:04.678]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:32:04.678 --> 00:32:09.041]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:32:09.041 --> 00:32:12.703]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:32:12.703 --> 00:32:15.725]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:32:15.725 --> 00:32:23.310]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:26.953]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:32:27.213 --> 00:32:31.636]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[00:32:31.636 --> 00:32:37.620]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:41.542]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[00:32:41.542 --> 00:32:44.284]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[00:32:44.284 --> 00:32:45.645]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[00:32:45.785 --> 00:32:47.147]  It's time to take action.
[00:32:47.147 --> 00:32:48.989]  It's time to filter our water.

[00:33:15.839 --> 00:33:21.823]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:21.823 --> 00:33:24.846]  We're gonna do a video report on this sometime next week.
[00:33:24.846 --> 00:33:27.748]  My friend has all the documentation.
[00:33:27.748 --> 00:33:29.149]  He bought a $3,000 used 1993 Chevy pickup truck.
[00:33:36.923 --> 00:33:41.685]  And he went in to get the license and registration, and they said, uh, your truck is worth $18,000.
[00:33:41.685 --> 00:33:47.207]  And he said, no, it's listed at about $3,000 in the Kelley Blue Book, and that's what I paid for it.
[00:33:47.207 --> 00:33:49.088]  I need something to haul stuff around.
[00:33:49.088 --> 00:33:51.829]  It's a junkie old truck, but, you know, runs okay.
[00:33:51.829 --> 00:33:55.370]  And they said, no, you owe us, you know, $6,000.
[00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:56.490]  We've got all the documentation.
[00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:59.812]  We're going to show that he's at five or six thousand.
[00:33:59.812 --> 00:34:03.193]  So he just went to a DPS office, uh, in Houston.
[00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:09.917]  And they said, yeah, this is worth $3,000 and you owe us $400.
[00:34:09.917 --> 00:34:12.601]  But still, he didn't even really own his truck.
[00:34:12.601 --> 00:34:16.746]  License, registration, all this stuff, that didn't used to happen on your transportation, on your horse and buggy.
[00:34:17.915 --> 00:34:20.976]  Travel is not a privilege, it's a right.
[00:34:20.976 --> 00:34:24.557]  But they've lied to you now and people think it's a privilege because the cops say so.
[00:34:24.557 --> 00:34:38.960]  It's a privilege to engage in commerce on publicly paid-for roads and to have an 18-wheeler, that's how it all started in the 20s, was they had heavier trucks traveling and they argued to the public, oh they're tearing up the roads, you're having to pay for it.
[00:34:40.188 --> 00:34:43.732]  Let's make them get license and registration because they're in commerce.
[00:34:43.732 --> 00:34:46.816]  And the states were able to constitutionally do that.
[00:34:46.816 --> 00:34:49.519]  Now you're in commerce.
[00:34:49.519 --> 00:34:56.788]  See, the governor of Nevada has now come out and said this is intimidation, the Fed should back off, and that he does have the grazing rights and the water rights.
[00:34:56.788 --> 00:34:58.090]  Folks, let me explain how big this is.
[00:35:01.653 --> 00:35:16.260]  When you have the surface rights, and the Feds come along when they're there 140 years ago, and the Feds come along 140 years later and say, well, we just say this is all federal land out here because nobody ever officially got it because nobody wanted it.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.841]  You have the grazing rights since 1877.
[00:35:17.841 --> 00:35:22.883]  We're just not going to let you do it or you can pay us a bunch of money.
[00:35:25.035 --> 00:35:28.736]  And this is all about Agenda 21 on record.
[00:35:28.736 --> 00:35:29.356]  Get the book.
[00:35:29.356 --> 00:35:30.157]  We sell it.
[00:35:30.157 --> 00:35:31.917]  Behind the Green Mask.
[00:35:31.917 --> 00:35:33.378]  Or my film, Endgame.
[00:35:33.378 --> 00:35:34.978]  At Infowarsstore.com.
[00:35:34.978 --> 00:35:35.819]  Give it to people.
[00:35:35.819 --> 00:35:37.739]  And then it supports the broadcast.
[00:35:37.739 --> 00:35:39.660]  We can have our reporters go out and cover things like this.
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.440]  It's very expensive to do this.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.141]  And give it to all your county commissioners, your city council.
[00:35:44.141 --> 00:35:44.961]  So they understand.
[00:35:44.961 --> 00:35:46.602]  Most of them are not criminals.
[00:35:46.602 --> 00:35:48.142]  They just are ignorant.
[00:35:48.142 --> 00:35:49.843]  And they think, wow, the feds have arrived.
[00:35:49.843 --> 00:35:51.364]  We've all got to kiss their butt.
[00:35:51.364 --> 00:35:52.324]  Just 10 years ago.
[00:35:53.186 --> 00:35:55.828]  The Feds still got permission when they came into a town or city.
[00:35:55.828 --> 00:35:57.290]  Now they don't even do that.
[00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.232]  Now they're ordering everyone around.
[00:36:00.232 --> 00:36:15.065]  I've covered Bilderberg, sitting there with a microphone, peacefully sitting there, and Hillary and Obama come into the deal before they was even elected, and a guy points an MP5 Heckler machine gun at me.
[00:36:16.391 --> 00:36:20.492]  Because he had an earpiece and a tie, and he thinks he's a secret agent and a movie star.
[00:36:20.492 --> 00:36:29.474]  He's a narcissistic mental patient, secret service agent, wanting to intimidate a bunch of reporters standing there, showing where Obama was at.
[00:36:29.474 --> 00:36:33.455]  When the media was saying, where's Obama, no one knows, we knew we were there.
[00:36:33.455 --> 00:36:35.616]  They were making the deal that she would step down, he would be president.
[00:36:39.605 --> 00:36:40.805]  We're the real media, folks.
[00:36:40.805 --> 00:36:42.086]  We went out and covered this.
[00:36:42.086 --> 00:36:44.567]  We covered this over a week and a half ago.
[00:36:44.567 --> 00:36:49.408]  Drudge covered it in the big, powerful alternative media, and now it's everywhere.
[00:36:49.408 --> 00:36:53.430]  And I'm not saying, oh, look, we covered and broke this story, because locals broke it.
[00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:59.412]  The point is, is that it's all happening to us, and we need to show we're the real media.
[00:36:59.412 --> 00:37:01.833]  We're the people's media.
[00:37:01.833 --> 00:37:06.775]  Mainstream media is saying, you know, Bundy claims he crazily owns this land that's federal.
[00:37:06.775 --> 00:37:07.475]  Isn't he nuts?
[00:37:08.863 --> 00:37:12.187]  Knowing people who aren't ranchers don't know about this.
[00:37:12.187 --> 00:37:15.030]  Don't know that 87% of the West is federal.
[00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.172]  Don't know 90% of Nevada is federal.
[00:37:17.172 --> 00:37:23.059]  Don't know they just power grabbed it and said well we administer it now but you can still have your grazing rights.
[00:37:26.058 --> 00:37:28.219]  So I want to go back to his son to give him the floor.
[00:37:28.219 --> 00:37:34.443]  Ahman Bundy, who was tasered, and he's going to show us the wounds from that.
[00:37:34.443 --> 00:37:37.105]  And I've seen the video on the local news, the blood pouring out.
[00:37:37.105 --> 00:37:40.687]  But when they tasered him, folks ripped the taser out.
[00:37:40.687 --> 00:37:43.749]  He was just telling the story of one of the young locals that's gone down to the river.
[00:37:43.749 --> 00:37:47.952]  When you're out in the desert, that's where everybody hangs out.
[00:37:47.952 --> 00:37:50.753]  On the BLM, quote, land, 90% of the state.
[00:37:52.369 --> 00:37:57.453]  They're outside the town, 600,000 acres, and here came the feds racing down to attack him.
[00:37:57.453 --> 00:38:00.435]  And they almost had a confrontation, and that's what's going to happen, folks.
[00:38:00.435 --> 00:38:08.460]  They're going to beat up a kid, they're going to beat up a woman, they're going to shoot a kid in the back, and I'm telling you, all hell's going to break loose, and I don't want that to happen.
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.002]  We're beating the globalists right now politically.
[00:38:11.002 --> 00:38:12.463]  We are hurting them on every front.
[00:38:12.463 --> 00:38:14.464]  They want to get a physical confrontation going.
[00:38:14.464 --> 00:38:17.246]  They've got the billions of rounds of ammo, the armored vehicles, all of it.
[00:38:17.246 --> 00:38:20.749]  They're going to lose that civil war in the first wave.
[00:38:21.929 --> 00:38:23.991]  But then they're going to bring in the UN troops after.
[00:38:23.991 --> 00:38:26.113]  And by the way, folks, I'm not kidding.
[00:38:26.113 --> 00:38:29.056]  This is official State Department plan 7277.
[00:38:29.056 --> 00:38:30.137]  This is NLE09.
[00:38:30.137 --> 00:38:36.444]  And NLE14 that we got that was secret, where it talks about using foreign troops against Americans.
[00:38:36.444 --> 00:38:37.285]  This is all real.
[00:38:38.288 --> 00:38:45.752]  Now I want to go back to David Knight to finish talking to one of the ranchers who's been physically attacked.
[00:38:45.752 --> 00:38:51.174]  And I guess it was his other brother, what was it, that got arrested for no reason and his head slammed in the ground and taken to Las Vegas.
[00:38:51.174 --> 00:38:59.878]  Break down, sir, finish up your story about obviously cows dying or what was in the back of the dump truck and the over 250 armed people.
[00:38:59.878 --> 00:39:04.661]  I mean, get him to go over all of it, David Knight, and then I want you, David, to break down your take on all this.
[00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:05.081]  David Knight.
[00:39:06.451 --> 00:39:16.265]  Alex, we're here with Ammon Bundy and he's the son of Clive and Bundy and he was just telling us before the break that they were concerned about
[00:39:18.063 --> 00:39:18.864]  I was tasered on my arm.
[00:39:40.785 --> 00:39:43.187]  And then they hit my chest and my stomach.
[00:39:43.187 --> 00:39:44.407]  And you tore it out?
[00:39:44.407 --> 00:39:50.111]  Yeah, either I tore it out or some other people that were with me tore them out.
[00:39:50.111 --> 00:39:52.532]  As they were shooting them, they'd tear them out.
[00:39:52.532 --> 00:39:57.455]  Well, tell us what led up to this, and we want to talk about, because this is a real key thing.
[00:39:57.455 --> 00:40:02.939]  The key point about this is about their water rights, and that was what this ultimately turned out to be about.
[00:40:02.939 --> 00:40:05.040]  But tell us about the incident leading up to that.
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:07.061]  All right, so they're coming down.
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:15.821]  Fourteen units, they were protecting this backhoe and this dump truck.
[00:40:15.821 --> 00:40:22.463]  And we stopped the convoy in the intent to see what was in the back of that dump truck.
[00:40:22.463 --> 00:40:35.366]  And they immediately came out armed, and thirteen units with two men and dogs each, at least two men and dogs, fully armed, came out.
[00:40:37.128 --> 00:40:37.508]  We're good.
[00:40:54.933 --> 00:41:00.578]  Um, exploded into, you know, escalated tremendously slammed her into the ground.
[00:41:00.578 --> 00:41:00.798]  Yeah.
[00:41:00.798 --> 00:41:02.620]  From behind there's you watch the video.
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:03.320]  It's from behind.
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:03.861]  Yeah.
[00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:08.805]  And, uh, then there was, uh, um, you know, continued to confrontation forward.
[00:41:08.805 --> 00:41:12.088]  And then they, they, uh, they started to tase me.
[00:41:12.088 --> 00:41:17.212]  They hit me and we, I ripped the first ones off or actually it was a combination.
[00:41:17.212 --> 00:41:21.976]  There were several people who ripped them off and then they, uh, taste taste me again.
[00:41:22.503 --> 00:41:23.023]  We're good to go.
[00:41:46.443 --> 00:42:01.342]  And basically kept pressing that they needed to get in their truck, they needed to get out of here, and we were able to push them far enough that we did get a look in the back of the truck and finally pushed them out of there and made them leave.
[00:42:01.342 --> 00:42:02.824]  What did you learn when you looked in the truck?
[00:42:03.467 --> 00:42:08.570]  Well, we thought that Pops was going to be a rendering truck because they're going to have animals in there, but we did not find that.
[00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:18.636]  What we found was that they're destroying all the water pipes and all the water tanks that are throughout this land that have been here over a hundred years.
[00:42:18.636 --> 00:42:19.637]  They're destroying the infrastructure.
[00:42:21.474 --> 00:42:25.216]  They're destroying the infrastructure just like Stalin did in Poland and Ukraine.
[00:42:25.216 --> 00:42:28.657]  This is classic war against our infrastructure.
[00:42:28.657 --> 00:42:33.379]  NAFTA, GATT, all of it is to shut us down.
[00:42:33.379 --> 00:42:36.921]  It was reported yesterday by the LA Times ranchers are shutting down nationwide.
[00:42:37.961 --> 00:42:40.203]  Bee prices are the highest ever recorded.
[00:42:40.203 --> 00:42:50.792]  Almost all the ranchers I know have been shut down, even though bee prices are the highest ever because of Big Agra having a bottleneck on the production of the meat packing.
[00:42:50.792 --> 00:42:54.155]  And so, I want people to understand, this is the shutdown of America.
[00:42:54.155 --> 00:42:57.278]  This is Cloward and Piven to bankrupt us we're seeing right now.
[00:42:57.278 --> 00:42:59.941]  If you want welfare, you want to come here and have your babies for free?
[00:43:01.411 --> 00:43:03.573]  Taxpayers will pay for it.
[00:43:03.573 --> 00:43:07.255]  If you want to come here and vote to take our guns, you can come into the country.
[00:43:07.255 --> 00:43:18.483]  But if you've got the land and the water tanks and the water pipes for a hundred years, where the windmills, you know, where this gentleman's great-great-granddaddy set it up, you're not allowed to do that.
[00:43:18.483 --> 00:43:20.285]  It will be destroyed by the criminals.
[00:43:20.285 --> 00:43:20.605]  Go ahead.
[00:43:24.778 --> 00:43:28.981]  Back to David Knight.
[00:43:28.981 --> 00:43:33.343]  Yes, I want to talk a little bit about those water rights because those water rights are very much like your property rights.
[00:43:33.343 --> 00:43:36.405]  You register your property rights at the county, state level.
[00:43:36.405 --> 00:43:37.546]  It's not at the federal level.
[00:43:37.546 --> 00:43:42.169]  And they can come in, if we're going to allow this to happen to these ranchers, they're going to do that to us individually.
[00:43:42.169 --> 00:43:49.734]  Talk a little bit about the water rights and what they try to do there because they are destroying infrastructure, not only for you, but for the wildlife that's out here, right?
[00:43:49.734 --> 00:43:50.534]  That's correct.
[00:43:50.534 --> 00:43:51.595]  So those water rights,
[00:43:52.538 --> 00:43:58.942]  We're either purchased or inherited from and originally came from homesteading, okay?
[00:43:58.942 --> 00:44:12.892]  And they're throughout this land here and we have done improvements over the last 100 years and piped those lines down all through this country with tanks and pipes and the wildlife and the cattle have used that water for 100 plus years.
[00:44:15.875 --> 00:44:18.236]  They're tearing those out now.
[00:44:18.236 --> 00:44:24.101]  The reason they're doing that is because that is the one thing that ties those rights to this land.
[00:44:24.101 --> 00:44:27.203]  See, the grazing rights are also tied to the water.
[00:44:27.203 --> 00:44:29.305]  So if they have any
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:39.206]  Uh, if we have any legal right besides just state taking over its sovereignty, which obviously we want to happen, but it's tied to those waters.
[00:44:39.206 --> 00:44:39.966]  And they know that.
[00:44:39.966 --> 00:44:46.790]  And that's why when they're tearing these out and they're coming down, that's why one dump truck and a backhoe has 13 armed vehicles on it.
[00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:51.253]  Because they did not want us to see what was in the back of that because they are destroying those waters.
[00:44:51.253 --> 00:44:55.115]  They know where the critical points are to take our rights, to take our property.
[00:44:55.115 --> 00:44:55.635]  Absolutely.
[00:44:55.635 --> 00:44:56.236]  Must be.
[00:44:56.236 --> 00:44:58.957]  Why in the world would they have 13 armed vehicles, over 30 men,
[00:45:00.178 --> 00:45:06.840]  With military rifles and dogs to protect one backhoe and a dump truck.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.660]  Let me add this point.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:16.462]  There's famous cases out in California, you know, where the guy had the hundred acres right between the two mountains.
[00:45:16.462 --> 00:45:18.643]  He was a doctor, no criminal record.
[00:45:18.643 --> 00:45:21.083]  And they just came to his house and killed him in a marijuana raid.
[00:45:21.083 --> 00:45:22.403]  There was no marijuana.
[00:45:22.403 --> 00:45:25.484]  And then the police actually sold and moved into the property.
[00:45:25.484 --> 00:45:27.345]  And actually the cops that killed him got the money.
[00:45:28.985 --> 00:45:31.528]  That's all this is is asset forfeiture seizure.
[00:45:31.528 --> 00:45:38.397]  We have a predatory government and they state they want to quote rewilding half the country completely off limits to humans.
[00:45:38.397 --> 00:45:40.339]  They're tearing up the roads everywhere.
[00:45:40.339 --> 00:45:46.567]  This is why America is shutting down and they know people are fleeing out west away from the tyranny of the cities and
[00:45:47.634 --> 00:45:48.896]  This is the war, folks.
[00:45:48.896 --> 00:46:01.490]  This is why in Florida, they're arresting women that for 10 years, you know, that lady, you know, had her own electric power out in the country, and they saw her on the news, and so they sent the code enforcers to try to take her house.
[00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:07.917]  I mean, this is happening everywhere, your report, David, where they're arresting people for collecting rainwater in Oregon.
[00:46:08.928 --> 00:46:10.228]  This is the takeover.
[00:46:10.228 --> 00:46:14.790]  Now I want to talk about, his father said he was concerned about confrontations yesterday.
[00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.030]  Those indeed happened.
[00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:22.932]  We've seen him taser, we've seen women assaulted by these little coward goons in their costumes, in their little police dogs.
[00:46:22.932 --> 00:46:26.313]  I mean, just total cowards.
[00:46:26.313 --> 00:46:29.233]  And we've seen their activities.
[00:46:29.233 --> 00:46:31.674]  What are the actions planned today?
[00:46:31.674 --> 00:46:33.895]  What do they think the next flashpoints could be?
[00:46:33.895 --> 00:46:35.295]  What's the game plan going forward?
[00:46:36.499 --> 00:46:38.621]  Well, actually, we've accomplished quite a bit today already.
[00:46:38.621 --> 00:46:42.044]  At dawn, we had around 20 cowboys go out on the public land, and we gathered about 30 head.
[00:46:56.741 --> 00:46:57.061]  I'm good.
[00:47:17.839 --> 00:47:26.424]  So the state to start realizing their responsibilities so we have five state representatives that will be here addressing the people at five o'clock and so
[00:47:27.122 --> 00:47:28.523]  That's what's going on today.
[00:47:28.523 --> 00:47:33.207]  Let me ask you about the auction because there was news that they were going to try to auction off the cattle.
[00:47:33.207 --> 00:47:34.848]  I saw something as we're flying out here.
[00:47:34.848 --> 00:47:39.132]  I read that they were going to originally auction them off in Utah.
[00:47:39.132 --> 00:47:40.052]  Utah said no.
[00:47:40.052 --> 00:47:43.455]  What's the status of the auction of the cattle that they've rustled so far?
[00:47:43.455 --> 00:47:50.921]  Well, they had paid the auction $300,000 to take the cattle because obviously they must have known that there would be some commitment that the cattle
[00:47:51.848 --> 00:47:59.555]  They were not able to do that one is Utah's not allowing them to be transferred to to the to the auction yard and then they were
[00:48:00.325 --> 00:48:06.430]  Opposed so heavily that if they continued it, the auction yard would have gone out of business.
[00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:13.014]  So we imagine, and we don't know this for sure, but we imagine that they're looking for other ways to sell these cattle.
[00:48:13.014 --> 00:48:21.320]  We don't know that the cattle have left the compound over here or not, but we actually have airplanes in the air.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:26.244]  Finally, we've been able to get airplanes in the air to confirm that, and I haven't got that report.
[00:48:28.358 --> 00:48:35.702]  Our goal is to keep those cattle from leaving this area by the people's voice, and then take them back.
[00:48:35.702 --> 00:48:38.604]  Let me ask you one last question, if we've got time, Alex.
[00:48:38.604 --> 00:48:43.687]  I was talking to your mother earlier, and she said, at the point, there used to be 53 ranches right around here.
[00:48:43.687 --> 00:48:45.528]  You're the last ranch in the area.
[00:48:45.528 --> 00:48:57.174]  At the point where the 52 other ranches went out, she said that they had reduced the herd allowable to something like 150 head, and they were going to keep them off during the spring, which is the prime time, the calving time, which is right now.
[00:48:57.814 --> 00:49:06.797]  But also, I thought it was very curious that these other 52 ranches were bought off by the state of Nevada, not by the federal government, is that correct?
[00:49:06.797 --> 00:49:23.182]  By the county, and you have to, there's a lot to that, but one is that proves that there was rights, because the way it was, the federal government manipulated the state and the county to buy those, but then they recognized that there was rights and that they needed to be purchased.
[00:49:23.182 --> 00:49:24.282]  My dad did not sell.
[00:49:25.103 --> 00:49:29.684]  Which is an argument of, at one time they did recognize those rights.
[00:49:29.684 --> 00:49:33.925]  Now, just to make it clear, 53 ranchers did not sell.
[00:49:33.925 --> 00:49:38.226]  Many of them were pushed out, regulated to the point that they could not survive.
[00:49:38.226 --> 00:49:50.048]  Others died, and I mean by that, not violent deaths, but these are, you know, older men and they died young because they were, the pressure and the
[00:49:51.167 --> 00:49:54.812]  Anyway, I just talked about a couple ranchers that actually died of heart attacks.
[00:49:54.812 --> 00:49:56.434]  I mean, this is a serious deal.
[00:49:56.434 --> 00:49:58.256]  It's extremely stressful on a rancher.
[00:49:58.256 --> 00:50:09.391]  The livelihood is very rough, and to get them to just survive in this without the federal regulations is tough, and then try to regulate
[00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:13.391]  uh... deregulated out of business is makes it even rougher.
[00:50:13.391 --> 00:50:14.311]  Tell him we're going to break.
[00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:15.871]  I want to come back to him.
[00:50:15.871 --> 00:50:17.131]  That's the reason to regulate.
[00:50:17.131 --> 00:50:17.671]  We're going to break.
[00:50:17.671 --> 00:50:18.392]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:18.392 --> 00:50:20.852]  I want to come back and get your take on this.
[00:50:20.852 --> 00:50:21.972]  Have him finish up and we'll come back.
[00:50:21.972 --> 00:50:28.013]  I know he's got to go, but I want to get some final comments from him and also get what David Knight has to say.
[00:50:28.013 --> 00:50:29.854]  But if he's got another interview, let him go to that.
[00:50:29.854 --> 00:50:32.694]  Folks, this is the extinction of a way of life.
[00:50:32.694 --> 00:50:35.035]  This is the hunting down, the harassment.
[00:50:35.035 --> 00:50:36.875]  You really learn how predatory the government is.
[00:50:37.793 --> 00:50:41.256]  When they've gotten 3% more of Nevada in just the last 6-7 years.
[00:50:41.256 --> 00:50:42.016]  It's up to 90% now.
[00:50:42.016 --> 00:50:43.337]  It was 87.
[00:50:43.337 --> 00:50:46.239]  They want everything.
[00:50:46.239 --> 00:50:51.503]  And if you got hardy people out in the desert that have been there for 140 years, they want them gone.
[00:50:51.503 --> 00:50:54.906]  They want you in the cities drinking fluoride, eating GMO.
[00:50:54.906 --> 00:50:57.467]  This is off the charts evil.
[00:50:57.467 --> 00:50:57.988]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:00.518 --> 00:51:03.859]  The response has been overwhelming, and for that, we say thank you.

[00:51:59.908 --> 00:52:03.889]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[00:52:03.889 --> 00:52:08.150]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:11.791]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[00:52:11.791 --> 00:52:14.751]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[00:52:14.751 --> 00:52:21.973]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[00:52:22.213 --> 00:52:25.896]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[00:52:25.896 --> 00:52:28.958]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.

[00:54:03.004 --> 00:54:11.532]  You know, we didn't plan to roll this.
[00:54:11.532 --> 00:54:12.733]  This is pre-programmed.
[00:54:12.733 --> 00:54:19.680]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're gonna get mugged if you go downtown.
[00:54:21.854 --> 00:54:23.995]  Notice he can skin a buck, he can run a trot line.
[00:54:23.995 --> 00:54:30.277]  A country boy can survive.
[00:54:30.277 --> 00:54:34.098]  Where are all the Tea Party people?
[00:54:34.098 --> 00:54:35.919]  Where are all the so-called land rights people?
[00:54:35.919 --> 00:54:39.400]  Well, they're out there in the middle of nowhere.
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:41.921]  And they want you to not be able to survive.
[00:54:43.623 --> 00:54:48.247]  Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run.
[00:54:48.247 --> 00:54:51.449]  No you can't.
[00:54:51.449 --> 00:54:55.152]  The feds say they own it all and they're coming with men with guns.
[00:54:55.152 --> 00:54:57.614]  Because a country boy can survive.
[00:55:13.754 --> 00:55:23.260]  Worldwide, people that are living on the land are being driven off because you can't starve them out and you can't make them run!
[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:25.221]  We've got to go back to the land.
[00:55:25.221 --> 00:55:27.342]  We've got to get more sufficient.
[00:55:41.886 --> 00:55:46.427]  That's right, if you're not into that, look, just go be a slave.
[00:55:46.427 --> 00:55:58.731]  Alright, going back to David Knight, out there with the ranchers, facing crazed goons.
[00:55:58.731 --> 00:56:04.153]  David Knight, I want to get final comments from Mr. Bundy, and then I want to get your take on what you're seeing.
[00:56:07.774 --> 00:56:12.716]  Alex, as you mentioned, this is about rights, and it's very sad to see this happening to these people.
[00:56:12.716 --> 00:56:21.039]  I'm reminded of the old days in Old England, you know, when the Robin Hood stories where the sheriff and the king said that you couldn't go into the forest to get any food.
[00:56:21.039 --> 00:56:22.119]  That's essentially what they're trying to do.
[00:56:22.119 --> 00:56:30.202]  If they can run these people off of their land, shut down the family business they've had for 140 years, they can take your property as well.
[00:56:30.202 --> 00:56:36.964]  Whether you just have a suburban house, they've probably got a much stronger title than you do if you've been involved in some of these MERS situations.
[00:56:37.584 --> 00:56:39.245]  Last comment here, Eamon.
[00:56:39.245 --> 00:56:40.526]  Where would you like to see this happen?
[00:56:40.526 --> 00:56:44.129]  What would be a good way for this to be resolved?
[00:56:44.129 --> 00:56:47.131]  Well, it must be resolved by the state taking its sovereignty.
[00:56:47.131 --> 00:56:55.897]  The state leadership, the governor, and the county leadership, such as the county sheriff, have to step in here and say, no, this is not correct.
[00:56:55.897 --> 00:56:57.718]  This is not constitutional.
[00:56:57.718 --> 00:57:02.902]  This land is Nevada state land, and the laws of Nevada apply here.
[00:57:02.902 --> 00:57:05.243]  This is not the territory, the U.S.
[00:57:05.243 --> 00:57:05.764]  territory.
[00:57:06.306 --> 00:57:13.990]  Now, so far, the Governor Republican, Sandoval, has been standing on the sideline wringing his hands, but you do have some state reps that are going to show up this afternoon, you think?
[00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:20.574]  We do, and of course they're trying to influence the Governor to get a backbone in this thing.
[00:57:20.574 --> 00:57:27.217]  He's made a couple comments, but he's going to have to answer these people, and I hope he does.
[00:57:27.217 --> 00:57:33.941]  We respect him, we need him, and we know that he can be a leader, and we want him to lead.
[00:57:36.745 --> 00:57:38.446]  And recognize his sovereignty here.
[00:57:53.137 --> 00:58:02.186]  A guest on for an hour and a half, Steve Quayle, to cover the waterfront, and then Steele will probably still be on with us when you're interviewing his dad.
[00:58:02.186 --> 00:58:08.692]  They're live in the last 30 minutes today, but I want to bring that up to him, because these confrontations continue, and this keeps going on.
[00:58:08.692 --> 00:58:15.218]  I mean, that's a big deal, David, that 20 cowboys rode out there and got some of the stolen cows back.
[00:58:15.218 --> 00:58:16.299]  That's a big deal.
[00:58:16.299 --> 00:58:17.380]  Big defiance of the scum.
[00:58:18.226 --> 00:58:24.972]  The key is going to be whether people are going to stand together on this or whether they're going to let these people be taken down one at a time by a pack of federal wolves.
[00:58:24.972 --> 00:58:25.392]  Well, that's it.
[00:58:25.392 --> 00:58:28.194]  The wolves have already driven out the other 53 families.
[00:58:28.194 --> 00:58:28.675]  That's right.
[00:58:28.675 --> 00:58:31.697]  I mean, all over America, like a cancer, they're shutting everything down.
[00:58:31.697 --> 00:58:35.440]  Every mine, every field, everything privately owned.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:41.005]  They are slitting this country's throat ear to ear right now.
[00:58:41.005 --> 00:58:44.408]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.276 --> 00:58:55.002]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[00:58:55.002 --> 00:58:58.126]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[00:58:58.126 --> 00:59:03.693]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[00:59:03.693 --> 00:59:05.295]  It all comes down to one thing.
[00:59:05.615 --> 00:59:07.236]  We are what we eat.
[00:59:07.236 --> 00:59:11.919]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[00:59:11.919 --> 00:59:16.142]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and Big Pharma runoff.
[00:59:16.142 --> 00:59:18.704]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[00:59:18.704 --> 00:59:24.928]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[00:59:55.704 --> 00:59:58.465]  Alex Jones, on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:10.028]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.028 --> 01:00:11.630]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:13.172]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.172 --> 01:00:17.357]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.357 --> 01:00:21.422]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:30.207]  I come to you live from Austin, Texas with helicopters and SWAT teams crawling all over the place and highways shut down everywhere.
[01:00:30.207 --> 01:00:34.552]  Our crew went out and they're all laughing in there, so it must be powerful.
[01:00:34.552 --> 01:00:41.259]  Coming up, if you're a TV viewer, not just a radio listener, you're going to want to go to InfoWars.com forward slash show to see the free feed.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:52.542]  The Nightly News is a subscription, PrisonPlanet.tv, but they're saying we have incredible footage of Emperor Obama arriving, and they're all in there laughing and rubbing their bellies, so this must be good.
[01:00:52.542 --> 01:00:53.722]  I haven't seen this yet.
[01:00:53.722 --> 01:01:06.545]  They're loading it into the computer right now off the digital card, so we're going to go to this video raw, just shot minutes ago as the imperial leader arrived in all of his pomp and circumstance.
[01:01:06.545 --> 01:01:07.085]  David Knight!
[01:01:07.847 --> 01:01:12.390]  You're going to be back home with us in an hour and a half with Steve Quayle, who's coming up.
[01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:15.213]  But you're going to be interviewing Mr. Bundy, Cliven Bundy.
[01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:17.134]  Other points you'd like to add about what we're seeing?
[01:01:17.134 --> 01:01:18.735]  I mean, this is history.
[01:01:18.735 --> 01:01:20.196]  These ranchers are hard folks.
[01:01:20.196 --> 01:01:21.637]  It's a really hard life out there.
[01:01:21.637 --> 01:01:24.419]  And they're serious people.
[01:01:24.419 --> 01:01:26.061]  And they're really a relic.
[01:01:26.701 --> 01:01:35.104]  Of what America used to be, and they're just really showing restraint compared to what just the World War II generation would do.
[01:01:35.104 --> 01:01:43.708]  When you see the swagger and the attack dogs and the hatred in the eyes of the BLM people, these people, I don't even hate them.
[01:01:43.708 --> 01:01:53.952]  They are just literally little boys working for evil who think they have the authority because they work for the delegitimized, occupied federal government.
[01:01:55.402 --> 01:02:00.913]  Alex, it all boils down to what Eamon was just telling us about that 59 year old woman.
[01:02:00.913 --> 01:02:06.384]  They came up on her from behind, they hip checked her, threw her to the ground, and then jumped on her.
[01:02:07.051 --> 01:02:08.913]  That's the kind of thuggery that we're seeing here.
[01:02:08.913 --> 01:02:10.895]  You're talking about a way of life dying.
[01:02:10.895 --> 01:02:14.598]  These are the ranchers and farmers from the 18th and 19th.
[01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:17.140]  Notice they attacked who they thought was weakest first.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:20.843]  That is the essence of cowardice and of being a low-life predator.
[01:02:20.843 --> 01:02:26.268]  I mean, I can't even get excited unless I'm outnumbered in a fight with men.
[01:02:26.268 --> 01:02:28.250]  And then it's pretty exciting.
[01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:32.314]  And then I can really become... I couldn't imagine assaulting a woman.
[01:02:33.544 --> 01:02:40.226]  You know, as we were driving in, Alex, we went across a cattle crossing, a cattle guard that they put in the streets to keep the cattle out of the area.
[01:02:40.226 --> 01:02:47.048]  We're standing right across from a sign that has a warning about cows and says that this is an open range.
[01:02:47.048 --> 01:02:48.889]  This has been here a long time.
[01:02:48.889 --> 01:02:51.229]  This family is not the interloper.
[01:02:51.229 --> 01:02:52.450]  Everything, though, is changing.
[01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:54.651]  Uninstinctive hatred of their food.
[01:03:18.892 --> 01:03:24.037]  An instinctive hatred of their food not being sheep but actually becoming men again.
[01:03:24.037 --> 01:03:27.121]  And again, I don't want to indict the entire bureaucracy.
[01:03:27.121 --> 01:03:28.983]  It's been more honorable in the past.
[01:03:28.983 --> 01:03:29.503]  It is now...
[01:03:30.703 --> 01:03:31.483]  It's rotten.
[01:03:31.483 --> 01:03:32.784]  It's like rotten milk.
[01:03:32.784 --> 01:03:35.385]  I mean, the apples are all going rotten.
[01:03:35.385 --> 01:03:45.069]  Listen, I've got Steve Quill on who's always riveting and informative and would say stuff ten years ago that I would just roll my eyes at that unfortunately has all come true.
[01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:46.550]  It's so wild.
[01:03:46.550 --> 01:03:48.271]  He's going to be on this for like an hour and a half at least.
[01:03:49.071 --> 01:03:51.852]  But I'm sure he's going to want to get updates as well.
[01:03:51.852 --> 01:03:58.875]  So at about 40 after this hour, I know you're going to do that interview after that, feel free to take us up to the line where the feds are at.
[01:03:58.875 --> 01:04:00.455]  Feel free to survey stuff.
[01:04:00.455 --> 01:04:01.536]  Feel free to be getting shots.
[01:04:01.536 --> 01:04:02.816]  We'll be having live feeds.
[01:04:02.816 --> 01:04:03.837]  Just a video only.
[01:04:05.803 --> 01:04:07.244]  We haven't seen any, Alex.
[01:04:07.244 --> 01:04:16.909]  They were saying that just right here, if you look at how close these buttes are right here, they said they had a bunch of snipers out here just a few days ago, but they were just trying to intimidate people.
[01:04:16.909 --> 01:04:21.352]  So they laughed about it and they said if that's as good a shot as the snipers are, well they don't have anything to worry about.
[01:04:21.352 --> 01:04:24.013]  But they're now, I haven't seen any yet.
[01:04:24.013 --> 01:04:26.995]  We're going to drive around and see if we can find where the marking line is.
[01:04:28.118 --> 01:04:33.262]  Alright, well great job, but about 40 after or so, unless it gets in the way of something more important, that's at your discretion.
[01:04:33.262 --> 01:04:44.570]  Just be wherever you want at 40 after for a quick 3 minute update, or go down and talk to some of that crowd, get their take on it, get a shot of that sign, the cattle crossing, because we're going to put this in Obama Deception too.
[01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:47.252]  We're going to be right back.
[01:04:47.252 --> 01:04:49.074]  Thank you so much David Knight for going out there.
[01:04:50.421 --> 01:04:52.522]  They've been assaulting reporters as well.
[01:04:52.522 --> 01:04:54.342]  It's just unprecedented.
[01:04:54.342 --> 01:04:58.043]  And saying that most of the county is a free speech non-zone.
[01:04:58.043 --> 01:05:00.464]  Just welcome to North Korea.
[01:05:00.464 --> 01:05:03.284]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:05:03.284 --> 01:05:08.406]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at My Patriot Supply.
[01:05:08.406 --> 01:05:16.228]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:05:16.508 --> 01:05:21.049]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:05:21.049 --> 01:05:25.010]  My Patriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:30.972]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:05:30.972 --> 01:05:34.133]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.

[01:06:59.285 --> 01:07:03.588]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:07:03.588 --> 01:07:06.030]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:14.618]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:07:14.618 --> 01:07:24.826]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO, organic, super male vitality formula.

[01:07:58.207 --> 01:08:09.894]  Infowarslife.com From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.894 --> 01:08:20.080]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.001]  Well, he is one of the biggest
[01:08:23.379 --> 01:08:27.403]  non-terrestrial radio host in the country and the world.
[01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:30.706]  Steve Quayle wrote about chemtrails 20 years ago.
[01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:37.453]  He wrote about the genetic manipulation and the plan to create genocide and transhumanism 15, 16, 17 years ago.
[01:08:37.453 --> 01:08:44.620]  His new book, I can't wait to read it, gets into their master plan.
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.481]  Really, I look back over the years
[01:08:47.322 --> 01:08:51.284]  And I always thought he had a good heart, and I knew a lot of what he was saying was documented.
[01:08:51.284 --> 01:08:55.647]  Some of it was so far out, I thought, man, you know, this guy just goes too far.
[01:08:55.647 --> 01:09:02.271]  And unfortunately, so much of what Steve Quill continues to cover keeps turning out to be true.
[01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:09.395]  Including military targeting of everyone's home in databases with GPS to your front door for drone attack.
[01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:12.817]  He reported that five years before they admitted it mainstream news.
[01:09:16.107 --> 01:09:21.169]  I mean, it's just so crazy how criminal this system is.
[01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:22.990]  By the way, it's official.
[01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:25.291]  Just came across the news wires.
[01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:27.392]  We just saw it on Fox News scrolling.
[01:09:27.392 --> 01:09:31.434]  House Oversight Committee officially holds Lois Lerner in contempt.
[01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:31.774]  There it is.
[01:09:31.774 --> 01:09:36.796]  Republicans vote to hold former IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress.
[01:09:36.796 --> 01:09:38.097]  Let's scroll down a little bit more there.
[01:09:38.757 --> 01:09:40.578]  Is that a report they were going to vote or did they vote?
[01:09:40.578 --> 01:09:42.538]  Because Fox said they did do it.
[01:09:42.538 --> 01:10:01.645]  Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted on party lines today, just minutes ago, to hold in contempt of Congress the former Internal Revenue Service official at the heart of the agency's inappropriate, inappropriate as pure Soviet-style persecution, commissar garbage, scrutiny of political non-profits that weren't
[01:10:02.245 --> 01:10:03.345]  Anti-American, basically.
[01:10:03.345 --> 01:10:11.808]  This is the first congressional lawmaker to have acted to hold someone in contempt for asserting his or hers Fifth Amendment rights.
[01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:21.012]  They're holding her in contempt because she goes out and makes statements publicly, makes statements after taking the Fifth, has been caught being a liar.
[01:10:21.012 --> 01:10:22.932]  And they held her in contempt in 2012.
[01:10:22.932 --> 01:10:29.274]  Now they're looking at some type of congressional criminal charges, which Congress can do.
[01:10:29.274 --> 01:10:30.715]  This is a real crisis we're in.
[01:10:32.213 --> 01:10:34.036]  And there are good people in Congress.
[01:10:34.036 --> 01:10:40.465]  That's why you have the Republican and Democratic leadership every time an inside leak comes out in the news, mainstream news, they're worried about what?
[01:10:40.465 --> 01:10:41.046]  The Tea Party.
[01:10:41.701 --> 01:10:43.182]  They're worried about the military.
[01:10:43.182 --> 01:10:44.203]  They're worried about Christians.
[01:10:44.203 --> 01:10:45.664]  They're worried about rural communities.
[01:10:45.664 --> 01:10:47.205]  They're worried about libertarians.
[01:10:47.205 --> 01:10:49.607]  They're worried about constitutionalists.
[01:10:49.607 --> 01:11:01.977]  That just means people that are common sense and aren't for secret police and kids being taken from their parents for no reason and GMO and fluoride in the water and endless wars and funding Al Qaeda.
[01:11:01.977 --> 01:11:04.239]  Remember when that was kooky when I talked about it 12 years ago?
[01:11:04.239 --> 01:11:04.979]  Now it's mainstream news?
[01:11:05.916 --> 01:11:06.956]  This is not our government.
[01:11:06.956 --> 01:11:20.821]  This is criminal groups showing chaos against every nation to play us off against each other, while the multinationals are above the law, with diplomatic immunity, now getting carbon taxes, Obamacare taxes, or international tax to foreign banks.
[01:11:20.821 --> 01:11:23.062]  That's what Obamacare is.
[01:11:23.062 --> 01:11:24.182]  IMF World Bank money.
[01:11:24.182 --> 01:11:28.064]  I mean, we are literally, just like a third world country, being sucked dry.
[01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:35.173]  And I want to get Steve Quayle's take on the standoff in Nevada.
[01:11:35.173 --> 01:11:45.179]  We saw 20 cowboys ride across today and get 30 of the cows back that the feds are breaking the water pipes from the wells built 100 years ago.
[01:11:45.179 --> 01:11:49.101]  The family's been there for 144 years.
[01:11:49.101 --> 01:11:54.905]  This is all unfolding right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:59.991]  And the Cowboys, our guys have high def footage they're going to be uploading tonight.
[01:11:59.991 --> 01:12:01.252]  They're working really long hours.
[01:12:01.252 --> 01:12:05.953]  Some of the incredible images that they've gotten from out there already we're showing on screen.
[01:12:05.953 --> 01:12:09.155]  But this is the last family of 53 ranches they've run out.
[01:12:11.181 --> 01:12:12.502]  Bankrupted.
[01:12:12.502 --> 01:12:14.444]  And you see all the signs about cattle crossings.
[01:12:14.444 --> 01:12:16.566]  They have the surface and grazing rights.
[01:12:16.566 --> 01:12:20.569]  And for folks that don't understand that, I want to get Steve Quell's take on this first.
[01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:23.152]  Then I want to get into the geopolitical war brewing.
[01:12:23.152 --> 01:12:27.395]  Next hour, we're going to get into his new book that gets into what they cover in the movie Noah.
[01:12:27.395 --> 01:12:28.937]  I mean, it's all in Genesis.
[01:12:28.937 --> 01:12:30.838]  It's all in Leviticus.
[01:12:30.838 --> 01:12:35.002]  And it's what the elite, what the elite are doing now is what the Bible says was done before.
[01:12:35.002 --> 01:12:37.965]  And they're trying to play God, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:38.573 --> 01:12:41.396]  And so we're going to cover it all with Steve Quayle, SteveQuayle.com.
[01:12:41.396 --> 01:12:50.926]  Steve, I'm very excited you also have a new Spanish site, because I know you're really big in Latin America, and we need to do this as well, but tell us about your new Spanish site.
[01:12:51.527 --> 01:13:05.896]  Well, and for the record, I'm learning Spanish very slowly, Alex, and I'm not, you know, I won't murder the name in Spanish, but they can go on my website, stevequayle.com, and Timothy Alvarino is a man who's lived in Peru for the majority of his life.
[01:13:05.896 --> 01:13:06.436]  Brilliant.
[01:13:06.436 --> 01:13:14.321]  Knows what's going on around the world, and especially in the area of the scientific finds that have to do with giants, ancient civilizations.
[01:13:14.321 --> 01:13:15.702]  He's so connected down there.
[01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:25.968]  And as you know that they found the giant skulls from Paracas, and Timothy is updating it, and we have a lady from Argentina who's probably one of the finest translators.
[01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:31.912]  So Genesis6Giants.com, it's on my website about a third of the way down the right-hand side of the page.
[01:13:31.912 --> 01:13:42.738]  It's in totally Spanish, and what I found, Alex, is the Latino and South American news feeds have so many, and Hispanic news feeds have so much more truth.
[01:13:42.858 --> 01:13:45.979]  I'm talking thousands of eyewitnesses.
[01:13:45.979 --> 01:13:54.643]  It's like once you hit the electronic frontier of the United States of America, it seems like everything is done to control people from understanding the truth.
[01:13:54.643 --> 01:13:59.865]  So it's Genesis 6 Gigantes, I guess it's pronounced, I can't even try and pronounce it.
[01:13:59.865 --> 01:14:01.926]  But the bottom line is it's wonderful.
[01:14:01.926 --> 01:14:05.028]  The editor is an amazing man.
[01:14:05.028 --> 01:14:08.349]  My translator, Monica, is an amazing translator.
[01:14:08.349 --> 01:14:12.091]  And these people have connections throughout the entire Hispanic and Latin communities.
[01:14:12.871 --> 01:14:16.733]  Uh, you know, again, we're gonna translate back into English the good stuff.
[01:14:16.733 --> 01:14:29.541]  But, uh, thank you for mentioning that, Alex, because, again, there's so many people that need to know what we're talking about, and quite candidly, you would be well advised to do the same thing, because as they clamp down on us here, they can't clamp down on us everywhere.
[01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:39.995]  Absolutely, and even mainstream news said those skulls, which you've been obsessing on for 20 years, in a good way, are not really even human DNA.
[01:14:39.995 --> 01:14:43.758]  And this just gets weirder and weirder, and I don't even know what to say anymore, it's gotten so strange.
[01:14:43.758 --> 01:14:50.322]  We'll cover some of that in the next hour, but Steve Quayle, obviously we're not getting the whole history that the elite are actually aware of.
[01:14:50.322 --> 01:14:51.383]  We know the Alexandria
[01:14:53.068 --> 01:14:55.971]  Uh, library was not really destroyed.
[01:14:55.971 --> 01:14:57.893]  We'll cover all that with you coming up.
[01:14:57.893 --> 01:15:05.782]  But Steve, first off, you have been one of the first survivalists ever, even before you got into the liberty movement 20 years ago.
[01:15:05.782 --> 01:15:08.304]  Really one of the proto-leaders of the modern liberty movement today.
[01:15:08.304 --> 01:15:09.546]  I'm not kissing your butt, it's just true.
[01:15:10.286 --> 01:15:14.088]  And you've been there, you've lived in the rural areas, you've been off the grid.
[01:15:14.088 --> 01:15:19.691]  I know you've seen the BLM siege, just running everybody off the land.
[01:15:19.691 --> 01:15:29.537]  The general greenhorns out there let the mainstream media deceive them and go, this old crazy man in Nevada says he owns land the federal government owns.
[01:15:29.537 --> 01:15:31.638]  In 1877, before it was even a territory,
[01:15:32.418 --> 01:15:44.546]  His family went out there, and they've got the water, the surface, and the grazing rights at the state, and it's on record, and they tried to buy it from them 10 years ago.
[01:15:44.546 --> 01:15:46.247]  The state didn't, and the feds did.
[01:15:46.247 --> 01:15:47.448]  It's all on record.
[01:15:47.448 --> 01:15:52.431]  So now they've just showed up with machine guns and are taking it, and this assaults everybody.
[01:15:52.431 --> 01:15:58.856]  And that's why beef prices are exploding, all of it, because they're literally running people out of business everywhere, even on their own land.
[01:15:58.856 --> 01:16:01.918]  My family cannot even break even in the cattle business now.
[01:16:02.898 --> 01:16:07.300]  So, one of my good friends is one of the biggest producers in Texas.
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:10.501]  They just sold one of their biggest herds and ranches.
[01:16:10.501 --> 01:16:15.924]  I mean, because this country is being shut down under agenda 21 mafia tactics.
[01:16:15.924 --> 01:16:18.105]  And then only big agribusiness is allowed to operate.
[01:16:18.105 --> 01:16:19.685]  Steve Quill, what is this really all about?
[01:16:19.685 --> 01:16:23.267]  And what do you think about what's happening in Nevada on the Bundy Ranch and the federal standoff?
[01:16:27.392 --> 01:16:32.535]  I mean, I've heard this story about 29 gas and oil leases that are going on in that part of the country.
[01:16:32.535 --> 01:16:38.818]  So, you know, when this sort of thing takes place, somebody wants what's on the BLM land for their own use.
[01:16:38.818 --> 01:16:43.861]  And I think the Illuminati is in full rape, pillage, and plunder mode.
[01:16:43.861 --> 01:16:52.526]  One of the hardest things for Americans to even get with, remember when you and I were screaming about NAFTA, North American Free Trade Agreement, GAD, General Agreement on Trades and Territories,
[01:16:53.166 --> 01:16:53.586]  I don't know.
[01:17:09.582 --> 01:17:10.783]  We're good to go.
[01:17:26.116 --> 01:17:26.717]  We're good.
[01:17:42.472 --> 01:17:45.796]  That's why they're shutting down farmers markets, lemonade stands.
[01:17:45.796 --> 01:17:48.179]  The ultimate sin is having a garden.
[01:17:48.179 --> 01:17:51.063]  The ultimate sin is not watching television all day.
[01:17:51.063 --> 01:17:53.405]  The ultimate sin is not breaking your family up.
[01:17:53.405 --> 01:17:56.830]  The ultimate sin is not just giving yourself over to the New World Order.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:13.400]  Absolutely the case, and now what we're seeing, Alex, in full fledge, look, I got so pissed, let me use the word, I'm sorry if it offends people, but they better be offended over watching dogs being pulled in and used to basically intimidate and terrorize.
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:17.762]  Snipers placed against a man, his wife, and his kids?
[01:18:17.762 --> 01:18:21.404]  Those snipers were in place before all the people started showing up.
[01:18:21.404 --> 01:18:27.767]  So I believe this is a test case to test the will of the American people to see what they'll stand up for.
[01:18:27.767 --> 01:18:36.012]  Now I placed a call, I won't tell you to who, but someone's very well connected in the political field down there, very, very well connected with the governor himself.
[01:18:36.012 --> 01:18:39.814]  And I said, do you have to tell these people to take a stand?
[01:18:40.334 --> 01:18:47.924]  I said, if you don't, at this point, I'm talking to Governor, I'm talking to Senators, obviously we don't expect Harry Reid and the Democrats to do anything.
[01:18:47.924 --> 01:18:51.389]  But the bottom line is that this is about life and death, Alex.
[01:18:51.389 --> 01:18:56.876]  That's what I think you've tried to do, and you've done all your producing of all your videos, all the...
[01:18:57.356 --> 01:19:00.360]  Thousands, tens of thousands of hours you've been on the radio.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.023]  It's now coming home to people.
[01:19:03.023 --> 01:19:09.069]  The price of beef is, as you know, you've got cattle farming in your family, cattle raising.
[01:19:09.069 --> 01:19:10.972]  The point is, we're at all-time highs.
[01:19:10.972 --> 01:19:11.953]  It hasn't been this high
[01:19:12.393 --> 01:19:12.933]  Ever!
[01:19:12.933 --> 01:19:16.835]  And what, four bucks a pound for ground beef around the country?
[01:19:16.835 --> 01:19:33.381]  But more than that, we've got a pig virus now introduced in which, just for the record, I believe it's a biological weapon against the people that raise pork, raise pigs, and the point is that we've got all these things going on simultaneously.
[01:19:33.381 --> 01:19:38.563]  So we are seeing right now in Nevada, I believe, the actual outbreak
[01:19:38.763 --> 01:19:39.784]  They're attacking women.
[01:19:39.784 --> 01:19:40.805]  Stay there, Steve Quayle.

[01:19:42.266 --> 01:19:43.267]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:22:03.624 --> 01:22:07.447]  Are you concerned about GMO foods making you sick and affecting your mind?
[01:22:07.447 --> 01:22:10.829]  Many people suffer from lack of energy, insomnia, loss of stamina.
[01:22:11.049 --> 01:22:13.612]  The weight gain and the inability to think clearly.
[01:22:13.612 --> 01:22:23.824]  Genetically modified crops, processed foods, and toxic chemicals can compromise your health and are silently destroying your digestive system, which accounts for 80% of your immune system.

[01:22:56.523 --> 01:22:59.705]  T-E-R-A-G-A-N-I-X dot com.
[01:22:59.705 --> 01:23:00.726]  The facts are in.
[01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:02.127]  The studies are legion.
[01:23:02.127 --> 01:23:09.612]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:23:09.612 --> 01:23:13.014]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:23:13.394 --> 01:23:13.974]  Simple.
[01:23:13.974 --> 01:23:18.657]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:23:18.657 --> 01:23:24.340]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:40.568]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Live Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.

[01:23:52.753 --> 01:23:57.135]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[01:23:57.135 --> 01:23:58.535]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:23:58.535 --> 01:24:09.700]  You hear the concern in Steve Quayle's voice, you hear it in mine.
[01:24:11.044 --> 01:24:23.789]  And as all this evil takes place, our government publicly funds Al Qaeda, starts wars in Ukraine, the school lunch program under Michelle Obama is worse than death row food, that's been confirmed.
[01:24:23.789 --> 01:24:32.373]  Because we put up with anything, we're being trained to put up with anything while the ruling class flies around in jet airplanes and has red carpets.
[01:24:32.373 --> 01:24:38.855]  We do have the footage of Emperor Obama arriving in Austin, I'll get to that briefly in the next segment, should I get to that earlier.
[01:24:38.855 --> 01:24:40.276]  But Steve Quayle is with us.
[01:24:41.337 --> 01:24:43.862]  And Steve, here's a headline.
[01:24:43.862 --> 01:24:48.531]  Feds move in on Nevada ranchers herd over illegal grazing.
[01:24:48.531 --> 01:24:49.152]  Fox News.
[01:24:49.152 --> 01:24:49.833]  Can't even get it right.
[01:24:51.735 --> 01:24:53.376]  It's not illegal grazing.
[01:24:53.376 --> 01:24:54.436]  They built the water pipes.
[01:24:54.436 --> 01:24:56.638]  They put it in 140-something years ago.
[01:24:56.638 --> 01:24:58.139]  The water pipes, 100 years ago.
[01:24:58.139 --> 01:25:01.480]  They tried to buy the water rights and land rights from them.
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:09.165]  And that's right, Steve Quayle did send me an article, sent it to your email, you guys print it, where they're moving in with oil and gas exploration with multinationals.
[01:25:09.165 --> 01:25:19.010]  And again, if they want to come buy those rights from people, obviously you could say that he probably didn't have the mineral rights.
[01:25:19.010 --> 01:25:20.531]  You would argue then the state would have that.
[01:25:22.469 --> 01:25:25.511]  The state would have the mineral rights, not the feds.
[01:25:25.511 --> 01:25:27.032]  And again, I know the laws, folks.
[01:25:27.032 --> 01:25:29.674]  It's the Texas Railroad Commission that's over that.
[01:25:29.674 --> 01:25:32.577]  And it's the land commissioner that's over that in my state.
[01:25:32.577 --> 01:25:36.379]  And I know the laws in Nevada.
[01:25:36.379 --> 01:25:37.981]  I know the laws all over the place.
[01:25:37.981 --> 01:25:39.382]  I've studied it.
[01:25:39.382 --> 01:25:42.444]  And it's so frustrating when you don't know.
[01:25:42.444 --> 01:25:46.267]  The general public's like, what's this guy doing on a national park with his cows?
[01:25:46.267 --> 01:25:47.168]  Crazy old man!
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:51.101]  Ninety percent of the state's been grabbed by the feds.
[01:25:51.101 --> 01:25:54.162]  They go, we administer it now, where you had the grazing rights.
[01:25:54.162 --> 01:25:55.222]  You keep doing what you're doing.
[01:25:55.222 --> 01:25:56.343]  By the way, sell that to us.
[01:25:56.343 --> 01:25:58.183]  No, I'm not going to.
[01:25:58.183 --> 01:25:59.303]  Meet my SWAT team.
[01:25:59.303 --> 01:26:03.605]  You don't get... I mean, this just shows the criminality.
[01:26:03.605 --> 01:26:05.385]  And they've already done this as Unit 21.
[01:26:05.385 --> 01:26:06.806]  Take Mexico, as you know.
[01:26:07.526 --> 01:26:11.388]  We were down there 30 years ago, and my dad said, they're selling land in Mexico?
[01:26:11.388 --> 01:26:13.589]  Foreigners couldn't buy land in Mexico until they did that.
[01:26:13.589 --> 01:26:15.510]  It was, oh, under the UN.
[01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:19.852]  Then my dad learned they'd stolen it from Mexican farmers, and he said, I'm not gonna buy any.
[01:26:19.852 --> 01:26:24.435]  My dad went and looked at buying it when I was like 10 years old.
[01:26:24.435 --> 01:26:27.136]  I was in Mexico, driving around, looking at land.
[01:26:27.136 --> 01:26:29.077]  Because my dad was like, man, this is incredibly cheap.
[01:26:29.077 --> 01:26:31.058]  It was Mexicans' land they took.
[01:26:31.058 --> 01:26:32.339]  Steve Coyle, go ahead, I'm ranting.
[01:26:33.052 --> 01:26:38.814]  Well, Alex, I think what everyone needs to understand is this is part of the whole global upheaval.
[01:26:38.814 --> 01:26:41.415]  This is what we're seeing, and we're seeing it in a way now.
[01:26:41.415 --> 01:26:44.355]  I want to bring something up to you that really is important.
[01:26:44.355 --> 01:26:52.638]  Just as they're grabbing our freedoms, our livelihoods, our lives, robbing our children and grandchildren of any future,
[01:26:53.558 --> 01:26:59.562]  The 200 million social security numbers have now been stolen.
[01:26:59.562 --> 01:27:06.246]  They've gone into that realm of cyber threat and cyber attack along with all the other databases.
[01:27:06.246 --> 01:27:13.010]  I want to propose to you that the ultimate manipulative process that I believe is going to come into play, don't know when,
[01:27:13.992 --> 01:27:17.154]  Is going to be to rob everybody of their identity.
[01:27:17.154 --> 01:27:21.417]  Change Alex Jones and Steve Quayle's social security number by one digit.
[01:27:21.417 --> 01:27:24.139]  Change our credit card information by one digit.
[01:27:24.139 --> 01:27:26.320]  Change our bank accounts by one digit.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.741]  I'm making it really simple.
[01:27:27.741 --> 01:27:31.944]  But can you imagine waking up and someone says, prove you're Alex Jones?
[01:27:31.944 --> 01:27:33.605]  And you can say, I talk like him.
[01:27:33.605 --> 01:27:35.926]  And they say, well, let's see your DNA.
[01:27:35.926 --> 01:27:37.107]  Here's what I'm trying to say.
[01:27:37.107 --> 01:27:37.968]  No, no, that's the plan.
[01:27:37.968 --> 01:27:41.350]  Forces on the DNA identification a level above biometric.
[01:27:41.980 --> 01:27:53.568]  Absolutely, and can you imagine on a Friday hearing, and now this is critical to what's going on, remember destabilization mentally, physically, and financially.
[01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:55.750]  They want everybody in limbo.
[01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:59.873]  They want everybody in a realm of disequilibrium.
[01:27:59.873 --> 01:28:07.278]  So, well, you know, we're looking at Ukraine, Crimea, Eastern Europe, NATO.
[01:28:07.278 --> 01:28:11.561]  We're looking at all of these, if you would, I call those three ring circuses.
[01:28:12.671 --> 01:28:18.249]  It's a global destabilization by the offshore banks, who are above the law, against the entire planet, against everyone!
[01:28:19.141 --> 01:28:19.501]  Absolutely.
[01:28:19.501 --> 01:28:24.683]  And you know the famous statement, give me control of a nation's currency and I care not who writes its laws.
[01:28:24.683 --> 01:28:27.243]  Just bring that up a step and you'll understand.
[01:28:27.243 --> 01:28:30.044]  Now 70% of the world is saying we don't want the American dollar.
[01:28:30.044 --> 01:28:31.724]  And you remember the Kyle Bass interview?
[01:28:31.724 --> 01:28:37.306]  He reported on it where one of the Obama administration guys said that their plan is to kill the dollar.
[01:28:37.306 --> 01:28:41.967]  Well what, you know, I wish Kyle Bass would have said no, your plan is to kill the country.
[01:28:41.967 --> 01:28:47.769]  We are absolutely watching the, I've got a word, horrification.
[01:28:48.664 --> 01:28:56.234]  Of everything that America used to stand for, taken out from under us, and why people don't get it is simply this.
[01:28:56.234 --> 01:29:03.264]  The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, all of those things that we all hold dear, they don't.
[01:29:03.784 --> 01:29:10.729]  So the enemies of freedom, the enemies of life, and the enemies of the living God are in a full-court press.
[01:29:10.729 --> 01:29:20.295]  And what we've got now, Alex, is literally a future that is going to make Blade Runner and Judge Dredd look simple.
[01:29:20.295 --> 01:29:22.397]  Soylent Green is on the horizon.
[01:29:22.857 --> 01:29:31.167]  And look, all of this because somebody says, well, I think this whole thing, I even got an email this morning, didn't answer it because I was too mad to answer politely.
[01:29:31.167 --> 01:29:33.730]  But well, you know, the BLM's got to do their job.
[01:29:33.730 --> 01:29:36.273]  That's what the stormtroopers under Hitler said.
[01:29:36.273 --> 01:29:37.714]  That's not what the SS said.
[01:29:37.714 --> 01:29:39.176]  And it's not even there.
[01:29:39.176 --> 01:29:40.698]  And ladies and gentlemen, let me say this.
[01:29:41.999 --> 01:29:46.966]  262 million people lost their lives directly related to gun control.
[01:29:46.966 --> 01:29:47.367]  That's right.
[01:29:47.367 --> 01:29:47.747]  Stay there.
[01:29:47.747 --> 01:29:48.628]  We're coming right back to you.
[01:29:48.628 --> 01:29:49.690]  Long segment, Steve.
[01:29:49.690 --> 01:29:51.092]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.092 --> 01:29:52.374]  The Empire's on the march.
[01:29:52.374 --> 01:29:53.275]  Powerful information.
[01:29:53.275 --> 01:29:53.856]  Steve, come on out.
[01:29:53.856 --> 01:29:56.039]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:56.039 --> 01:29:56.359]  Steve Quayle.com.
[01:29:56.359 --> 01:29:57.080]  We're InfoWars.com.
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:57.481]  Stay with us.
[01:30:00.692 --> 01:30:04.733]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:09.095]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[01:30:09.095 --> 01:30:12.756]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:30:12.756 --> 01:30:15.757]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[01:30:15.757 --> 01:30:23.060]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins of heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:27.261]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[01:30:27.261 --> 01:30:31.682]  You filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:30:31.682 --> 01:30:37.683]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:30:37.683 --> 01:30:41.704]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[01:30:41.704 --> 01:30:44.345]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:30:44.345 --> 01:30:45.685]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[01:30:45.845 --> 01:30:47.206]  It's time to take action.
[01:30:47.206 --> 01:30:49.026]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:31:00.792 --> 01:31:07.895]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[01:31:08.035 --> 01:31:10.396]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[01:31:10.396 --> 01:31:15.758]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[01:31:15.758 --> 01:31:21.000]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.081]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[01:31:24.381 --> 01:31:28.524]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[01:31:28.524 --> 01:31:32.908]  And don't forget the fact that six million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[01:31:32.908 --> 01:31:43.276]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape, but that we can fight back against.
[01:31:43.276 --> 01:31:54.184]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[01:31:54.344 --> 01:32:00.229]  Now available exclusively at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.

[01:32:03.932 --> 01:32:06.074]  The latest in preparedness is now here.

[01:32:12.239 --> 01:32:17.325]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the survival silver solution.
[01:32:17.325 --> 01:32:22.210]  The new Infowars live silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer for you and your family.

[01:32:27.176 --> 01:32:35.622]  InfoWarsLife Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[01:32:35.622 --> 01:32:37.763]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[01:32:37.763 --> 01:32:48.951]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes within a base of deionized water.

[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:17.504]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[01:33:17.504 --> 01:33:23.771]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[01:33:23.771 --> 01:33:28.636]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[01:33:28.636 --> 01:33:33.321]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[01:33:33.761 --> 01:33:36.283]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[01:33:36.283 --> 01:33:38.926]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[01:33:38.926 --> 01:33:43.770]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[01:33:43.770 --> 01:33:46.772]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[01:33:46.772 --> 01:33:50.355]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[01:33:50.355 --> 01:33:52.016]  You must evacuate the area.
[01:33:54.636 --> 01:34:07.148]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[01:34:07.148 --> 01:34:09.129]  So enjoy the flavor!
[01:34:09.129 --> 01:34:13.774]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[01:34:13.774 --> 01:34:15.755]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[01:34:15.755 --> 01:34:17.617]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[01:34:17.617 --> 01:34:18.938]  I'm for regular suicide.
[01:34:18.938 --> 01:34:20.540]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:32.166]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those ten teachers and to make that credit for medical costs?
[01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:36.549]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[01:34:36.549 --> 01:34:42.913]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[01:34:51.047 --> 01:34:53.650]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[01:34:53.650 --> 01:34:58.555]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[01:34:58.555 --> 01:35:01.077]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[01:35:01.077 --> 01:35:10.447]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[01:35:10.447 --> 01:35:12.910]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[01:35:13.630 --> 01:35:15.751]  The scoops are on their way.
[01:35:15.751 --> 01:35:18.333]  The scoops are on their way.
[01:35:18.333 --> 01:35:21.455]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[01:35:21.455 --> 01:35:24.756]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[01:35:24.756 --> 01:35:28.198]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[01:35:28.198 --> 01:35:29.959]  We've got to stop them!
[01:35:29.959 --> 01:35:30.540]  Come on!
[01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:34.942]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[01:35:34.942 --> 01:35:36.763]  Soylent Green is people!
[01:35:48.334 --> 01:35:53.518]  All right, that is real newscast mixed with a 1970s, early 1970s film, Soylent Green.
[01:35:53.518 --> 01:35:56.340]  It came out in 69, I forget.
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:09.210]  The point is that there were mathematical equations put out in the 60s when they were claiming global cooling, and the analogy at the major universities, it was put in the population bomb by
[01:36:11.519 --> 01:36:15.802]  The current White House science czar's boss, was it Paul Ehrlich?
[01:36:15.802 --> 01:36:17.223]  Yeah.
[01:36:17.223 --> 01:36:18.824]  And the point is that...
[01:36:19.881 --> 01:36:24.685]  And I was taught this in basically every class I had at community college before I got out.
[01:36:24.685 --> 01:36:25.426]  It was all propaganda.
[01:36:25.426 --> 01:36:27.467]  I was about to go to UT and I said, what's the point?
[01:36:27.467 --> 01:36:30.130]  That there's too many people who are going to kill the Earth, blah, blah, blah.
[01:36:30.130 --> 01:36:39.197]  Even if you think that's true, it's about the elite having control, dehumanizing us, and getting rid of an egalitarian free society and creating an authoritarian society.
[01:36:39.197 --> 01:36:41.039]  We're going back to Steve Quill to give him the floor right now.
[01:36:41.039 --> 01:36:43.761]  He's with us for the full two hours.
[01:36:43.761 --> 01:36:46.724]  You know, just going back and forth with banter and commentary and analysis.
[01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:49.850]  This is their program.
[01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:50.991]  And it's not my opinion.
[01:36:50.991 --> 01:36:53.092]  It's not Steve's opinion.
[01:36:53.092 --> 01:36:54.714]  They have to get us off the land.
[01:36:54.714 --> 01:36:58.797]  They have to pack us into the cities for social control.
[01:36:58.797 --> 01:37:01.719]  They don't want, quote, wild humans anywhere in the world.
[01:37:01.719 --> 01:37:03.160]  They want you in their system.
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:06.883]  They want you in the system now.
[01:37:06.883 --> 01:37:12.547]  And the system is not meant to create some wonderful egalitarian system.
[01:37:12.547 --> 01:37:16.370]  It is meant to end humanity as we know it.
[01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:17.451]  The elite are playing God.
[01:37:20.253 --> 01:37:25.016]  And you'll just read their writings and see the films I've made where I show their quotes.
[01:37:25.016 --> 01:37:28.298]  I mean, you see it in all the movies, you see it in the culture now where they push it.
[01:37:28.298 --> 01:37:30.860]  This is really happening!
[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:35.443]  And I have an article right here out of the New York Post.
[01:37:35.443 --> 01:37:40.446]  Mute stroke victim barred from LAX flight.
[01:37:40.446 --> 01:37:46.670]  The woman's face was paralyzed, couldn't talk, and
[01:37:48.962 --> 01:37:54.645]  Sherry Wright, who was taking her family member through, explained that she's had a stroke.
[01:37:54.645 --> 01:37:58.187]  And they said, we don't care, lady, you're not going through if she doesn't answer our questions.
[01:37:58.187 --> 01:38:04.189]  TSA makes people in wheelchairs who can't get up, they don't let them fly.
[01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:10.252]  And you see cops more and more tasering autistic kids walking down the street naked, or throwing people out of wheelchairs.
[01:38:10.252 --> 01:38:11.913]  They say, I know somebody in Austin.
[01:38:11.913 --> 01:38:12.954]  They said, get out of your car.
[01:38:12.954 --> 01:38:14.634]  And they said, well, my wheelchair's in the back.
[01:38:14.634 --> 01:38:15.135]  What are these?
[01:38:15.135 --> 01:38:16.075]  These are hand controls.
[01:38:16.075 --> 01:38:17.256]  They look like nunchucks to me.
[01:38:18.302 --> 01:38:23.023]  And it's like, you know, wood coming out of the steering wheel, and he said, look, I'm paralyzed, chest down.
[01:38:23.023 --> 01:38:27.044]  And the cop, huge cop, beat him up.
[01:38:27.044 --> 01:38:29.285]  My friend sued him and then nothing happened.
[01:38:29.285 --> 01:38:32.606]  They promoted the guy to commander.
[01:38:32.606 --> 01:38:34.926]  And that was before the current police chief.
[01:38:34.926 --> 01:38:36.547]  I just don't even know what to say anymore.
[01:38:36.547 --> 01:38:39.667]  It's just, it shows the mindlessness.
[01:38:39.667 --> 01:38:43.668]  And when you see these BLM people, I've run into them, they just shake with hate.
[01:38:43.668 --> 01:38:45.789]  I mean, they're trained, you are the enemy.
[01:38:47.469 --> 01:38:51.972]  I mean, I don't even think soldiers in most wars I've read about or heard about hated the enemy this much.
[01:38:51.972 --> 01:38:53.473]  They just killed them because they were trying to kill them.
[01:38:53.473 --> 01:39:06.083]  In fact, reading a lot of the history of war, a lot of times people kind of liked the enemy at a weird level and studied them and would even adopt some of their stuff and the other enemy would adopt some of their stuff and there was more honorable stuff involved.
[01:39:07.059 --> 01:39:08.460]  I'm not romanticizing war.
[01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:10.220]  I mean, the globalists, it's ideological.
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:11.141]  They are socialists.
[01:39:11.141 --> 01:39:12.221]  They are parasites.
[01:39:12.221 --> 01:39:12.861]  They hate us.
[01:39:12.861 --> 01:39:21.185]  And they do psychological testing in big departments now, and the feds to hire mentally ill people who want to just dominate and control.
[01:39:21.185 --> 01:39:23.026]  Or who are so stupid they'll follow any order.
[01:39:23.891 --> 01:39:25.452]  Those tests have come out in national news.
[01:39:25.452 --> 01:39:28.513]  They went under 100 IQ now, the last 15 years or so.
[01:39:28.513 --> 01:39:30.053]  Not all departments do this.
[01:39:30.053 --> 01:39:33.914]  They went under 100 IQ and very autocratic authoritarian.
[01:39:33.914 --> 01:39:37.616]  Remember the TSA Abbott said we want imperious people.
[01:39:37.616 --> 01:39:41.057]  Imperious means acting imperial, lordly, like you're a slave.
[01:39:41.057 --> 01:39:45.338]  Now, this hour is brought to you by MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[01:39:45.338 --> 01:39:47.399]  Great organic, high quality, storable foods.
[01:39:47.399 --> 01:39:50.060]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[01:39:51.747 --> 01:39:55.290]  And you can also give them a call at 866-229-0927.
[01:39:55.290 --> 01:39:57.431]  Great customer service, high quality.
[01:39:57.431 --> 01:39:59.353]  MyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex.
[01:39:59.353 --> 01:40:02.895]  And also, I've done an hour and 40 minutes and haven't really plugged anything.
[01:40:02.895 --> 01:40:09.860]  We're funded and have these reporters to send them to the Boston Marathon event, anniversary coming up here next week.
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:17.746]  And that whole police state rollout, to send people out to Nevada, to have the reporters, the riders, the nightly news, the whole infrastructure takes a lot of money.
[01:40:19.130 --> 01:40:21.253]  Even though we do it on the cheaps here in Austin, Texas.
[01:40:21.253 --> 01:40:27.340]  We couldn't do one-tenth of this in some place like New York, with all its bureaucracy and cost.
[01:40:27.340 --> 01:40:33.528]  We need you to go to m4warstore.com and buy the Molon Lombe Spartan shirts for men and women.
[01:40:34.588 --> 01:40:45.215]  We need you to go to Infowarslife.com and get the Survival Shield, to get the Fluoride Shield, the Super Mel Vitality, the high-quality organic coffee from Southern Mexico with the Chiapas folks.
[01:40:45.215 --> 01:40:54.642]  We need you to get these high-quality products, and I know when you use them, you've heard the rave reviews from listeners calling in, that you will continue to order them and support our operation.
[01:40:54.642 --> 01:40:55.783]  And I know times are tough.
[01:40:56.621 --> 01:41:00.204]  But your continued support of our operation is essential.
[01:41:00.204 --> 01:41:01.565]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:41:01.565 --> 01:41:07.109]  Infowarslife.com to find the supplements that are the very best.
[01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:10.692]  Infowarsstore.com for the books, the films, the t-shirts.
[01:41:10.692 --> 01:41:14.716]  All of it that's about getting the word out while supporting the tip of the spear in the info war.
[01:41:15.706 --> 01:41:22.830]  And we're a platform for Steve Quayle and Rosa Corey on Gen21 and Ron Paul and all these other incredible people you hear.
[01:41:22.830 --> 01:41:24.511]  They have their own platforms as well.
[01:41:24.511 --> 01:41:26.332]  We support those platforms.
[01:41:26.332 --> 01:41:27.873]  Because we're all in this together.
[01:41:27.873 --> 01:41:29.714]  This is not about being the big radio host.
[01:41:29.714 --> 01:41:35.177]  This is not about, you know, who's the best or so many other talk show hosts that infight and all this garbage.
[01:41:35.177 --> 01:41:37.458]  Folks, this is real.
[01:41:37.458 --> 01:41:37.959]  Okay?
[01:41:37.959 --> 01:41:40.600]  We're now seeing acceleration that we've predicted.
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.021]  We're not happy to be proven right.
[01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:45.749]  And so it is essential now more than ever.
[01:41:46.693 --> 01:41:52.014]  That people understand that as the evil comes in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[01:41:52.014 --> 01:42:00.957]  I'm going to shut up and literally turn my mic off and give you the floor to get into your sources, your analysis on the geopolitical power structure with the globalists running the U.S.
[01:42:00.957 --> 01:42:07.019]  and Europe, the Russians with their own crime syndicate, the communist Chinese, the Middle East, the funding of Al-Qaeda.
[01:42:07.019 --> 01:42:08.019]  Where is it all going?
[01:42:08.019 --> 01:42:11.580]  The global destabilization, because I went and saw Captain America.
[01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:14.120]  Everybody said, Alex, it's like they listen to your show.
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.261]  It is literally
[01:42:16.221 --> 01:42:24.616]  Everything they're planning, everything they've been doing, a criminal global group above the governments, playing them off against each other, Hail Hydra.
[01:42:24.616 --> 01:42:27.120]  Why is Hollywood suddenly telling the truth?
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:28.383]  Steve Quill, you've got the floor.
[01:42:29.326 --> 01:42:30.107]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:42:30.107 --> 01:42:47.630]  I think the reason that people are disconnected is, let's use neuro-linguistic programming and the mind control that you brought up, that all of the feds, when you broke the news on the Mayak report and all the other statements that were coming out of DHS, and all of them making patriots, gun owners, Christians,
[01:42:48.150 --> 01:42:55.436]  Homeschoolers, retired military, retired military officers, which by the way, just in a couple weeks you broke that story.
[01:42:55.436 --> 01:43:07.185]  Now, military, high-ranking military officers who have left over, you know, matters of conscience or have been purged by the administration are now considered the top of the ladder.
[01:43:07.185 --> 01:43:12.670]  And I would warn all of them, and like, people didn't take me serious, Alex, when I said they're coming after the vets.
[01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:26.295]  You and I did a show years ago where I said they're gonna try and come after the vets, they'll deny them healthcare treatment, they'll assassinate, and I'm on record, and I want to say it on your show, 22 people aren't, 22 vets a day aren't just killing themselves.
[01:43:26.295 --> 01:43:35.699]  I believe that whole story, don't get me wrong, there are suicides, but I believe it's a cover for the intentional assassinations of veterans who are considered
[01:43:36.681 --> 01:43:42.053]  Well, you know, we know that they've been killing a lot of investigators and fraud and things and always saying it's suicide.
[01:43:42.053 --> 01:43:45.461]  They killed a bunch of admirals and people, remember, that were gonna go after Clinton.
[01:43:45.987 --> 01:43:53.551]  Yep, Admiral Borda, Jeremy Borda, he basically, when he was off, okay, I mean, he was literally assassinated.
[01:43:53.551 --> 01:43:58.694]  I remember getting a postcard and seeing it, basically saying it was a CFR hit, okay?
[01:43:58.694 --> 01:44:04.757]  So people better wake up and rise up because we're all in the sights, and I appreciate what you say.
[01:44:04.757 --> 01:44:09.680]  You know, people, in listening land, it's time to get active and get off your, uh,
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:15.903]  Uh, you know, basically rear ends and start to realize that this is you we're fighting for.
[01:44:15.903 --> 01:44:22.645]  By the way, during the break, Alex, I got an email from a former DHS official who I know personally.
[01:44:22.645 --> 01:44:26.367]  Okay, this is an anomalous or a nameless entity.
[01:44:26.367 --> 01:44:33.090]  And he's saying the swine virus is to eliminate invasive regular pigs to introduce the enviro pig.
[01:44:33.090 --> 01:44:35.671]  The enviro pig is basically a genetically
[01:44:36.752 --> 01:44:43.570]  That's why they're now saying the cows for the earth are going to genetically engineer and outlaw all the others so they don't create methane in their flatulence.
[01:44:44.892 --> 01:45:12.207]  So here's the deal, and I also got an email from somebody, I don't know, I asked her to send me the information that the tortoise, I'm sorry, the desert tortoise, there's a new word, tortoise, the desert tortoise thrives in areas where the cattle are because that's how, because of the way they eat, they eat the cow dung, and also the way they get their water, and this person said that, that may be the case, but look, this is not about endangered species, and isn't it amazing, they'll draw down on men, women, and children, they'll zap every
[01:45:12.307 --> 01:45:13.429]  We're good to go.
[01:45:29.209 --> 01:45:31.810]  So here's what's going on.
[01:45:31.810 --> 01:45:42.633]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, the federal law enforcement as well as the military is being trained that the enemy is no longer foreign, it's domestic.
[01:45:42.633 --> 01:45:46.094]  The enemy is no longer one with guns, but ideas.
[01:45:46.094 --> 01:45:50.555]  This is the most dangerous time in our country's history.
[01:45:50.555 --> 01:45:54.816]  And Solomon in Proverbs said, if the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
[01:45:55.416 --> 01:46:03.581]  Jesus said, hey, if it weren't for him acting on behalf of his love for his people, the believers, that there'd be no flesh left alive.
[01:46:03.581 --> 01:46:16.750]  So what we're seeing, Alex, is a global setup, the global, literally, the showdown and the rundown, the showdown between the powers of good and evil and the powers of the elite over the average person.
[01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:19.432]  You and I have quoted, you've written books, you basically have
[01:46:19.872 --> 01:46:20.312]  We're good to go.
[01:46:42.844 --> 01:46:43.565]  I think so.
[01:47:01.619 --> 01:47:08.544]  What you're seeing, ladies and gentlemen, is the blueprint in the face of anybody who believes that word, freedom.
[01:47:08.544 --> 01:47:10.946]  And what's going to happen, it's going to escalate.
[01:47:10.946 --> 01:47:20.613]  They'll bring someone in, outside of a miracle, Alex, and I believe in miracles, but they'll bring someone in to stir the pot, a gun will get fired, somebody will get shot, and then it's going to escalate.
[01:47:20.613 --> 01:47:21.474]  They want it.
[01:47:21.474 --> 01:47:23.636]  All those billions of rounds of ammunition,
[01:47:24.276 --> 01:47:25.998]  All those armored vehicles.
[01:47:25.998 --> 01:47:33.844]  You probably saw the story carried, I think, on a town of 7,000 being given a half a million dollar armored fighting vehicle.
[01:47:33.844 --> 01:47:36.005]  So, ladies and gentlemen, where's the disconnect?
[01:47:36.005 --> 01:47:37.827]  Now, Alex, I'm going to give it right back to you.
[01:47:37.827 --> 01:47:45.012]  Where is the disconnect between what's going on and people not understanding that they are the target?
[01:47:45.012 --> 01:47:46.433]  The military has been taken apart.
[01:47:46.433 --> 01:47:47.794]  I live in Montana.
[01:47:47.794 --> 01:47:50.396]  Our missile wings have been decimated.
[01:47:50.396 --> 01:47:51.297]  People don't know this.
[01:47:51.297 --> 01:47:53.619]  The nuclear command structure has been restructured.
[01:47:54.199 --> 01:47:59.104]  All the atomic weapons are pretty much under the President's direct control.
[01:47:59.104 --> 01:48:08.133]  And the point is now, is that, seeing that we've made the announcement, or the announcement was made yesterday, or the day before, that 15 more warheads are going to be taken offline.
[01:48:08.133 --> 01:48:09.294]  Here's the thing, Alex.
[01:48:09.294 --> 01:48:09.975]  I maintain,
[01:48:10.575 --> 01:48:24.061]  That what we're currently seeing in Washington is a surrendered government, de facto, giving away all that we once were, and obviously all the lies, all the schemes, fast and furious.
[01:48:24.061 --> 01:48:25.122]  You want to know what I'm saying?
[01:48:25.122 --> 01:48:27.223]  Go look at the Grudge Report right now.
[01:48:27.223 --> 01:48:29.404]  Maybe you can bring it up, or have your guys bring it up.
[01:48:29.404 --> 01:48:30.504]  Look at the eyes.
[01:48:30.504 --> 01:48:33.086]  You know, the Bible says the eyes are the windows to the soul.
[01:48:33.086 --> 01:48:36.187]  I think the title is, uh, Holder Loses It.
[01:48:36.187 --> 01:48:37.888]  But what happened, what's happening,
[01:48:38.428 --> 01:48:46.594]  Because people don't understand that the word freedom, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, all of our founding fathers, what do we hear?
[01:48:46.594 --> 01:48:48.055]  That they're terrorists?
[01:48:48.055 --> 01:48:50.917]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what's going on.
[01:48:50.917 --> 01:48:57.501]  This is the plan to destroy every man, woman, and child in the United States of America.
[01:48:57.501 --> 01:48:59.603]  For that, Alex, I'm called an extremist.
[01:48:59.603 --> 01:49:03.886]  But I'll tell you what, I don't have to apologize anymore because it's playing out.
[01:49:03.886 --> 01:49:05.587]  And if I'm fighting for their lives,
[01:49:07.449 --> 01:49:07.809]  I think so.
[01:49:25.285 --> 01:49:25.705]  That's right.
[01:49:25.705 --> 01:49:29.029]  And a lot of fools say, oh well, all this stuff didn't come true.
[01:49:29.029 --> 01:49:30.090]  A lot of it has.
[01:49:30.090 --> 01:49:32.873]  That's because a lot of people have been holding it back.
[01:49:32.873 --> 01:49:34.094]  We've been holding it back.
[01:49:34.094 --> 01:49:37.318]  But now, now they've already gotten it in pieces.
[01:49:37.318 --> 01:49:40.061]  Now they're trying to get everything in a rush at once.
[01:49:40.061 --> 01:49:42.223]  Is that because they're behind schedule, Steve Coyle?
[01:49:42.463 --> 01:49:45.548]  Is that because they know Loris Lerner just was held in contempt?
[01:49:45.548 --> 01:49:52.998]  Is that why Eric Holder, as you just mentioned, just snapped and called Congress unprecedented, unwarranted, and ugly and divisive?
[01:49:52.998 --> 01:49:55.942]  Is that why they're calling it racist if we don't turn our guns in?
[01:49:55.942 --> 01:49:58.286]  Because the criminals realize we're awake to them?
[01:49:59.599 --> 01:50:03.721]  Absolutely, and here's the thing, and this is the number one point.
[01:50:03.721 --> 01:50:06.722]  Look at everything that centers around guns.
[01:50:06.722 --> 01:50:15.806]  You've cataloged, you've absolutely gone into detail on 9-11, on the false flies of Sandy Hook, on all of these events, everybody that snaps.
[01:50:15.806 --> 01:50:23.290]  And you notice they even came out and said, hey, the guy, the last shooter was on Prozac, you know, and some mind-altering drug.
[01:50:23.290 --> 01:50:25.831]  And the thing is, they never take on the pharmaceutical companies.
[01:50:25.831 --> 01:50:28.592]  And one of the signs, Alex, of the end of the age
[01:50:28.732 --> 01:50:29.212]  We're good to go.
[01:50:56.441 --> 01:50:56.882]  Stay there.
[01:50:56.882 --> 01:50:57.162]  Stay there.
[01:50:57.162 --> 01:50:58.023]  I'm gonna come right back to you.
[01:50:58.023 --> 01:50:58.604]  Gotta break again.
[01:50:58.604 --> 01:51:00.946]  I want to hear where you think it's all going.
[01:51:00.946 --> 01:51:02.128]  Clean water at home.

[01:51:31.611 --> 01:51:36.094]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:51:36.094 --> 01:51:41.818]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.

[01:52:59.469 --> 01:53:10.092]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:53:10.092 --> 01:53:11.913]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:53:12.113 --> 01:53:13.014]  Fluoride.
[01:53:13.014 --> 01:53:14.915]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:53:14.915 --> 01:53:21.461]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:26.365]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:53:26.365 --> 01:53:32.650]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:53:32.650 --> 01:53:35.052]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:53:35.052 --> 01:53:37.954]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:53:37.954 --> 01:53:41.317]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:53:41.437 --> 01:53:46.840]  You'll find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:54:26.070 --> 01:54:28.651]  Folks, it's cognitive dissonance.
[01:54:28.651 --> 01:54:33.033]  There's a lot of psychological terms we could go through here, but I don't want to spend that much time on it.
[01:54:33.033 --> 01:54:36.795]  People understand we've been incrementally taught to be slaves.
[01:54:36.795 --> 01:54:42.577]  And now they're just pulling the rug out from under us, and the bureaucrats all think they're in the right.
[01:54:42.577 --> 01:54:49.680]  They all literally think the public's a bunch of troublemakers, and they're there protecting us, and darn it, what's wrong with these people?
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:50.461]  And we're in danger.
[01:54:51.454 --> 01:55:06.024]  The government's so scared, they're spending $189 million per major social security administration building on actual triple canopy groups and other major global mercenary groups.
[01:55:06.024 --> 01:55:10.067]  24 hours a day with snipers on the roof and commandos in cars.
[01:55:10.067 --> 01:55:11.708]  They're getting ready for total collapse.
[01:55:11.708 --> 01:55:16.852]  Now, if we expose them, they may back off, but we're sitting on a time bomb.
[01:55:16.852 --> 01:55:19.194]  Now Obama says look for major cities to get nuked.
[01:55:20.205 --> 01:55:23.428]  I mean, you think I was happy to get the call about missing nukes?
[01:55:23.428 --> 01:55:28.973]  That dais, just like they had missing nukes in 2007, that we first reported on, that later got confirmed?
[01:55:28.973 --> 01:55:30.474]  Alternative media broke that?
[01:55:30.474 --> 01:55:31.435]  We weren't even the ones that broke it.
[01:55:31.435 --> 01:55:34.558]  We first reported it big time.
[01:55:34.558 --> 01:55:37.861]  I mean, this is above my pay grade.
[01:55:37.861 --> 01:55:41.284]  There's nobody who's qualified to deal with this pure evil except God.
[01:55:42.321 --> 01:55:54.377]  Steve Quayle, you were trying to get into the Silent Green clip we played earlier and then the break interrupted you, but I want you to get into the Ukraine, Russia, Obama's statement about his main fear is a nuke going off.
[01:55:54.377 --> 01:55:56.380]  That's how they'll bring in martial law.
[01:55:56.380 --> 01:55:58.182]  My gut always has said that.
[01:55:59.163 --> 01:56:00.143]  Or a bio-release.
[01:56:00.143 --> 01:56:04.824]  I've had a bunch of family and friends get sick, some of them die, from the mystery airborne stuff.
[01:56:04.824 --> 01:56:15.747]  And then I just think, Steve Quayle, Steve Quayle, kept saying a year ago, they're gonna release a super, and the Northeast Intelligence Network said, get ready for an airborne thing that's gonna kill people in their lungs.
[01:56:15.747 --> 01:56:20.588]  And you guys I know have real sources, and then people say, oh, no, they don't have sources, that's all made up.
[01:56:20.588 --> 01:56:25.389]  Well, hell, your made-up sources must have crystal balls then, because it just keeps happening.
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:32.202]  I think the reason it keeps happening is because there are some amazing people out there that want to tell the truth.
[01:56:32.202 --> 01:56:32.902]  We tell the truth.
[01:56:32.902 --> 01:56:34.403]  And let me share this.
[01:56:34.403 --> 01:56:35.864]  You know the heartbreak.
[01:56:35.864 --> 01:56:38.405]  You know watching family members die.
[01:56:38.405 --> 01:56:43.787]  We just heard that they're going to spray rabies vaccine in certain parts of the country.
[01:56:43.787 --> 01:56:53.911]  Then you've always heard that the rabies vaccine, rabies, forgive me, the pathogen rabies will ultimately be used in some form of zombie virus.
[01:56:53.911 --> 01:56:56.812]  And Alex, right now, one of the stories that people should just be
[01:56:57.312 --> 01:56:58.073]  Absolutely.
[01:56:58.073 --> 01:57:17.062]  This is the clearest neon sign that the regular military plans to make war against the United States citizens is that the Army has told the National Guard that they've got to return their Apache attack helicopters, you know, to the, and those supposedly given Blackhawks.
[01:57:17.062 --> 01:57:23.985]  And as one of the guys said, I'd agree with you Sally, said, for budget reasons, my ass, I'm quoting someone else, it's too
[01:57:23.985 --> 01:57:24.645]  We're good to go.
[01:57:48.012 --> 01:57:53.314]  That's why I compete with supercomputers, and he said, they can't compete me.
[01:57:53.314 --> 01:57:56.095]  That's why I press, and you know, I got a lot of flack.
[01:57:56.095 --> 01:57:58.116]  People say, quit talking about Jesus.
[01:57:58.116 --> 01:58:08.279]  I said, if I quit talking about Jesus, all the information that I've gotten through prayer and through my relationship with him and the people that love him wouldn't be out there.
[01:58:08.279 --> 01:58:11.020]  So look, I don't make any apologies for it.
[01:58:11.020 --> 01:58:15.822]  And the thing is, is that we're the group of people now, as Christians,
[01:58:16.342 --> 01:58:19.963]  And now the baby parts are in the cosmetics.
[01:58:19.963 --> 01:58:21.643]  It's in the Pepsi.
[01:58:21.643 --> 01:58:22.584]  Stay there.
[01:58:22.584 --> 01:58:23.724]  Incredible.
[01:58:23.724 --> 01:58:24.504]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:24.504 --> 01:58:25.224]  Steve Coyle.
[01:58:43.391 --> 01:58:50.773]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.773 --> 01:58:58.876]  The globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time, but now they're expanding, making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive.
[01:58:58.876 --> 01:59:01.117]  All the major networks are state-run.
[01:59:01.117 --> 01:59:03.818]  We are partnering this year with the NFL.
[01:59:03.818 --> 01:59:08.159]  The NFL has become a political weapon against the Second Amendment and pushes Obamacare.
[01:59:08.159 --> 01:59:11.220]  MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state.
[01:59:11.220 --> 01:59:18.869]  We have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:59:18.869 --> 01:59:23.194]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[01:59:23.194 --> 01:59:24.996]  We are the true media.
[01:59:24.996 --> 01:59:27.599]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[01:59:27.659 --> 01:59:31.421]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.

[01:59:53.610 --> 01:59:55.992]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.992 --> 02:00:05.479]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.479 --> 02:00:06.800]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:08.562]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.562 --> 02:00:10.323]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.323 --> 02:00:11.904]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.904 --> 02:00:13.465]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.465 --> 02:00:17.648]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.648 --> 02:00:21.712]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.673 --> 02:00:41.081]  Steve Quayle, we're seeing over 150,000, mainly Christians, exterminated by Al Qaeda forces out of Saudi Arabia, openly being armed by Obama.
[02:00:41.081 --> 02:00:41.982]  That comes out.
[02:00:41.982 --> 02:00:44.703]  So we did see a victory in the real media.
[02:00:44.703 --> 02:00:48.946]  I'm not saying Putin's a great guy, but the globalists are trying to start a war with him.
[02:00:48.946 --> 02:00:50.707]  Again, it's not America, it's the globalists.
[02:00:50.707 --> 02:00:52.348]  Where do you see all that going, Steve Quayle?
[02:00:53.029 --> 02:00:57.131]  Well, first of all, Alex, I coined a term a number of years ago that I think is really important.
[02:00:57.131 --> 02:01:02.574]  We're always used to the term double-cross, but we're going to see triple-crosses and quadruple-crosses.
[02:01:02.574 --> 02:01:07.876]  What Vladimir Putin has is basically, obviously, he's a pretty smart guy.
[02:01:07.876 --> 02:01:08.757]  He's determined.
[02:01:08.757 --> 02:01:10.257]  He has the memory.
[02:01:10.257 --> 02:01:14.840]  We destroyed the Russian ruble, and now he is turning our own
[02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:16.000]  I don't
[02:01:35.597 --> 02:02:02.968]  Factions and warring factions in Syria, beheading Christians, when you've got people eviscerating Christians, and I'm making it a point, when you've got little girls with their hearts torn out, literally, when you've got people with their heads and tails being eaten, and by the way, KURU, K-U-R-U, is broken out in Syria, that's the Creutzfeldt-Jakob or Jacob disease, that's the same thing that pretty much wiped out the headhunters in New Guinea,
[02:02:03.528 --> 02:02:09.812]  I gotta tell you, Alex, someone said, and I think it was George Norrie the other night, he said, well, how do you feel to be proven right?
[02:02:09.812 --> 02:02:13.595]  And I said, it's bittersweet, because I know where it goes from here.
[02:02:13.595 --> 02:02:16.557]  And let's get into the situation with Russia.
[02:02:16.557 --> 02:02:19.879]  It's not lost on the Illuminati and the globalists.
[02:02:19.879 --> 02:02:23.121]  They try and back all sides in any war.
[02:02:23.121 --> 02:02:27.304]  Remember the famous statement, we make more in one day of war than a year of peace?
[02:02:27.304 --> 02:02:28.045]  We're seeing that.
[02:02:28.485 --> 02:02:38.110]  But here's, I think, a trump card that's being played now that should show everyone where the United States stands in relationship to what's really going on in the Middle East.
[02:02:38.110 --> 02:02:45.353]  We gave our TOW anti-tank missiles to the group of Assyrian rebels.
[02:02:45.353 --> 02:02:47.634]  Those things will not stay in Syria.
[02:02:47.634 --> 02:02:51.336]  Those things are ultimately designed to be used against the Israeli army, armor.
[02:02:51.916 --> 02:02:54.618]  The whole peace talk has been amazing.
[02:02:54.618 --> 02:03:04.183]  That somehow Crimea is not an important aspect right now, and Ukraine has kind of been put on the back burner with what I call Mickey Mouse sanctions.
[02:03:04.183 --> 02:03:09.786]  By the way, I think the stupidest thing that Western Europe can do is try and enforce or even
[02:03:10.350 --> 02:03:11.991]  That's for sanctions against the Soviet Union.
[02:03:11.991 --> 02:03:17.893]  These people don't even know where their bread is buttered, but they don't have any clue of where their energy comes from.
[02:03:17.893 --> 02:03:32.839]  So it's about resources, and as we have encircled in the times past, trying to move in anti-ballistic missile shields into Eastern Europe, or former Eastern Europe, etc., the bottom line is that now we've got overflights.
[02:03:32.839 --> 02:03:34.860]  This thing is World War III.
[02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:37.021]  Now here's what people don't understand, Alex.
[02:03:37.021 --> 02:03:38.782]  This is not a stage play.
[02:03:39.142 --> 02:03:42.043]  The globalists will initiate World War III.
[02:03:42.043 --> 02:03:48.545]  All the bunkers, underground preparations, all the things we've been talking about for the past decade or two, they're in place.
[02:03:48.545 --> 02:04:06.071]  They believe that in order for their world leader, Lucifer, Satan, to come on the scene, and I submit that the same person, even the Illuminists, that all their videos are across the internet, and all the big Oscar ceremonies, and everybody talking about the devil.
[02:04:06.071 --> 02:04:08.172]  They're doing this publicly trying to bring it in.
[02:04:08.996 --> 02:04:10.237]  Oh, absolutely!
[02:04:10.237 --> 02:04:12.078]  So, they're getting ready.
[02:04:12.078 --> 02:04:14.660]  They need a blood sacrifice.
[02:04:14.660 --> 02:04:19.042]  Just like your commercial where you're talking about the dead babies, the aborted babies.
[02:04:19.042 --> 02:04:21.384]  What a sick, bloody society.
[02:04:22.324 --> 02:04:34.134]  A general who lives in Austin, Texas, active duty special ops that, Steve, they want to change the genetic makeup of human beings to revert them to cannibalism.
[02:04:34.134 --> 02:04:40.119]  Alex, when that comes from a four-star general who's active in spec ops and special operations, I pay attention.
[02:04:41.417 --> 02:04:45.300]  Well, the Al-Qaeda rebels are engaging in cannibalism and videotaping it.
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:46.982]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:04:46.982 --> 02:04:48.363]  And Putin's talked about that.
[02:04:48.363 --> 02:04:49.684]  It just gets more and more insane.
[02:04:49.684 --> 02:04:58.732]  I want to hear where you think this whole thing with Russia's going, what you think's going to end up happening with Obama, the supposed nuke he's worried about hitting Manhattan, and so much more.
[02:04:58.732 --> 02:04:59.233]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.686 --> 02:05:09.772]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:05:09.772 --> 02:05:17.878]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:05:18.178 --> 02:05:23.043]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:05:23.043 --> 02:05:29.850]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:29.850 --> 02:05:36.917]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:05:36.997 --> 02:05:44.042]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:05:44.042 --> 02:05:48.525]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:05:48.525 --> 02:05:58.212]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend, you will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:05:58.212 --> 02:05:59.893]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:01.215 --> 02:06:05.257]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:06:05.257 --> 02:06:09.600]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:13.282]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:06:13.282 --> 02:06:16.304]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:06:16.304 --> 02:06:23.889]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:06:23.889 --> 02:06:27.531]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:06:27.731 --> 02:06:32.216]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:06:32.216 --> 02:06:38.182]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:06:38.182 --> 02:06:42.247]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:06:42.247 --> 02:06:44.869]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:06:44.869 --> 02:06:46.211]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:06:46.351 --> 02:06:47.712]  It's time to take action.
[02:06:47.712 --> 02:06:49.553]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:07:01.282 --> 02:07:08.407]  From the water table, to our soils, to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day.
[02:07:08.527 --> 02:07:10.908]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[02:07:10.908 --> 02:07:16.250]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[02:07:16.250 --> 02:07:21.493]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[02:07:21.493 --> 02:07:24.894]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[02:07:24.894 --> 02:07:28.776]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew link to numerous conditions.
[02:07:29.016 --> 02:07:33.399]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[02:07:33.399 --> 02:07:43.767]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[02:07:43.767 --> 02:07:54.695]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA, the new InfoWars Live Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[02:07:54.835 --> 02:07:58.829]  Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:08:11.502 --> 02:08:17.509]  If you let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[02:08:17.509 --> 02:08:22.495]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[02:08:22.495 --> 02:08:27.360]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:29.343]  It's not about food.
[02:08:29.343 --> 02:08:31.986]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[02:08:38.598 --> 02:08:40.720]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:46.564]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:08:46.564 --> 02:08:53.008]  The name of the game is artificial scarcity that the globalists exempt themselves from.
[02:08:53.008 --> 02:08:55.550]  Regulations that shut down their competition.
[02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:57.912]  McDonald's gets a waiver to not have to get Obamacare.
[02:08:57.912 --> 02:09:01.575]  It can keep their employees at 40 hours a week.
[02:09:01.575 --> 02:09:05.838]  Everybody else has to go to 29.
[02:09:05.838 --> 02:09:07.219]  Federal parks get waivers.
[02:09:08.783 --> 02:09:17.747]  But then the local park that has a swimming pool, they have to cut all their lifeguards back to 20 hours a week, like has happened at Barton Springs.
[02:09:17.747 --> 02:09:19.188]  They cut them to 20.
[02:09:19.188 --> 02:09:21.969]  Just to quote, be safe and not get too many hours.
[02:09:21.969 --> 02:09:29.152]  Under Obamacare, and I literally, when this hit last year, I was still swimming even in the fall over there, laps, a few times a week.
[02:09:29.152 --> 02:09:34.694]  I probably had six, seven of the lifeguards, including managers, come over and go, I like your show, but I thought you were lying.
[02:09:34.694 --> 02:09:35.515]  You know, I'm a Democrat.
[02:09:36.519 --> 02:09:40.040]  I really thought that I wouldn't get my hours cut, but it's true.
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:42.541]  I said, we're going to take your banker gown too.
[02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:45.821]  They're not going to let you sign up for it.
[02:09:45.821 --> 02:09:47.862]  They're going to increase the price of the insurance.
[02:09:47.862 --> 02:09:51.423]  It's meant to wreck the country.
[02:09:51.423 --> 02:09:55.304]  I mean, this is a criminal takeover.
[02:09:55.304 --> 02:09:56.044]  That's not rhetoric.
[02:09:57.031 --> 02:09:59.312]  I want to get into your new book dealing with the GMO.
[02:09:59.312 --> 02:10:02.673]  I mean, you wrote about this 15, 16, 17, I guess in the mid-90s, 96.
[02:10:02.673 --> 02:10:06.834]  I want to talk about the old books you wrote, because those are evergreen.
[02:10:06.834 --> 02:10:09.614]  And I would read and go, oh, really, I want to destroy the genetic makeup.
[02:10:09.614 --> 02:10:15.256]  Well, now Ray Kurzweil and all of them say, we're just going to change your makeup whether you like it or not, and then you'll have to have the system to live.
[02:10:16.116 --> 02:10:21.661]  They're artificially making it worldly impossible to have kids without them going in and having designer babies.
[02:10:21.661 --> 02:10:22.822]  This is how they play God.
[02:10:22.822 --> 02:10:26.125]  This is how they destroy the old system to make you accept the new.
[02:10:26.125 --> 02:10:30.528]  This is how they infect all the pension funds with fraudulent derivatives so you want to stay in the system.
[02:10:30.528 --> 02:10:35.492]  I mean, it really is a multi-dimensional, fourth, fifth dimensional level of chess.
[02:10:35.492 --> 02:10:37.034]  It's an evil, wicked logic.
[02:10:37.873 --> 02:10:43.137]  And once you really study how the enemy operates and read their own writings, you go, this is demonically inspired.
[02:10:43.137 --> 02:10:45.780]  I mean, even if you don't believe in a physical devil, which I do.
[02:10:47.091 --> 02:10:48.992]  All the ancients knew this stuff was going on.
[02:10:48.992 --> 02:10:55.175]  The point is, an evil force, a good force, they literally just want to kill and hurt people.
[02:10:55.175 --> 02:10:57.516]  They literally just want to ruin nice things.
[02:10:57.516 --> 02:10:59.237]  They literally want us unhealthy.
[02:10:59.237 --> 02:11:00.997]  Look at the wages of the New World Order.
[02:11:00.997 --> 02:11:01.798]  It's death.
[02:11:01.798 --> 02:11:03.098]  Highest cancer rates.
[02:11:03.098 --> 02:11:04.499]  Highest breakup rates.
[02:11:04.499 --> 02:11:05.960]  Highest depression rates.
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:07.400]  Highest obesity rates.
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:08.981]  Highest diabetes rates.
[02:11:08.981 --> 02:11:10.922]  They're destroying us, Steve Quayle.
[02:11:10.922 --> 02:11:12.343]  And Alex Jones here, he just joined us.
[02:11:13.223 --> 02:11:24.549]  And so Steve, the Obamacare, all of it, the regulations to shut down all the coal power plants, none of them by General Electric, they're totally clean.
[02:11:24.549 --> 02:11:26.210]  But China can build three dirty ones a week.
[02:11:27.603 --> 02:11:30.045]  And Mexico is building them everywhere because they're shutting down the Texas plants.
[02:11:30.045 --> 02:11:33.507]  I mean, they are shutting us off right now.
[02:11:33.507 --> 02:11:36.009]  The power prices have doubled in six years.
[02:11:36.009 --> 02:11:39.711]  They are annihilating America right now!
[02:11:39.711 --> 02:11:46.756]  And I got a deal with a bunch of BLM guys strutting around in their uniforms like they're God while their whole future is being destroyed?
[02:11:46.756 --> 02:11:48.877]  While their kids are being shot up with deadly vaccines?
[02:11:48.877 --> 02:11:52.900]  I bet a third of those BLM guys have got kids that are ill.
[02:11:54.364 --> 02:12:06.573]  Because I run into people all the time that finally wake up because their FBI agent I was talking to about a year ago said, yeah, I thought you were full of it until our 18-month-old daughter got the third round of shots and now she doesn't talk.
[02:12:06.573 --> 02:12:09.936]  Yeah, you're going to find out, folks, they're going to kill you!
[02:12:09.936 --> 02:12:12.297]  And nobody's going to be there to help you.
[02:12:12.297 --> 02:12:13.338]  I'm ranting, Steve.
[02:12:13.338 --> 02:12:14.899]  It's just, it's all real.
[02:12:14.899 --> 02:12:16.120]  It's happening.
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:17.461]  It's happening.
[02:12:17.461 --> 02:12:19.723]  Obamacare, Russia, all of it.
[02:12:19.723 --> 02:12:20.784]  Let's get into your new book.
[02:12:22.370 --> 02:12:27.476]  My new book, Xenogenesis, is probably the culmination of everything I've written.
[02:12:27.476 --> 02:12:43.414]  When you've said it all, and I'm not saying I've said it all, but when you've put it all out there that I've been able to research and interview and everybody I know, etc., you've got to understand that they're using the three laws by a guy named Charles Pellegrino, and the three laws of alien behavior.
[02:12:43.914 --> 02:12:54.521]  Now, I want people to understand that when we're using the word alien, we're also using the word supernatural evil behavior or government behavior.
[02:12:54.521 --> 02:12:56.342]  Here's this law number one.
[02:12:56.342 --> 02:13:01.085]  Their survival will be more important than our survival, okay?
[02:13:01.085 --> 02:13:05.308]  Law number two, wimps don't become top dogs.
[02:13:05.308 --> 02:13:10.691]  No species makes it to the top, and I'm quoting now being passive, the species in charge of
[02:13:10.711 --> 02:13:11.971]  We're good to go.
[02:13:26.316 --> 02:13:30.017]  Something happened in New Mexico a couple days ago, and I read the Post Destroyer.
[02:13:30.017 --> 02:13:38.420]  I don't know if you saw it, but people said they got hit with a wave where they lost all track of time.
[02:13:38.420 --> 02:13:43.462]  And it was something they could find, it was something they could articulate, and it was something they experienced.
[02:13:43.462 --> 02:13:51.185]  DARPA admits in the Baltimore paper 14 years ago that they were, quote, testing mind control towers.
[02:13:51.185 --> 02:13:52.345]  That was in the newspaper.
[02:13:52.990 --> 02:13:54.051]  Absolutely.
[02:13:54.051 --> 02:14:17.753]  So I suggest to everyone, when you're carrying around your iPhone or whatever, Samsung, all the different phones, and you notice that the cell towers, those are what have absolutely been utilized, and I believe there's a, if you will, they broadcast frequencies on what are called sub-harmonic carriers, and they can basically put a person to sleep at a certain frequency
[02:14:18.033 --> 02:14:21.354]  Absolutely.
[02:14:21.354 --> 02:14:22.454]  So, here's this.
[02:14:22.454 --> 02:14:29.996]  Xenogenesis is, I gotta say this, it is the most important thing I've ever written.
[02:14:29.996 --> 02:14:32.697]  I've sold a lot of books over the years.
[02:14:32.697 --> 02:14:35.017]  This is about educating people.
[02:14:35.017 --> 02:14:37.618]  The point that they've got to understand is we are at
[02:14:38.633 --> 02:14:39.154]  We're good to go.
[02:14:53.905 --> 02:14:55.046]  We're good to go.
[02:15:22.346 --> 02:15:24.207]  Where did all the giant skeletons go, Alex?
[02:15:24.207 --> 02:15:31.873]  You saw the story about the FBI going to the 91-year-old artifacts collector's home with 200 vehicles.
[02:15:31.873 --> 02:15:36.156]  Did you see that story?
[02:15:36.156 --> 02:15:36.576]  Are you there?
[02:15:36.576 --> 02:15:37.717]  We lost your audio for a moment.
[02:15:40.380 --> 02:15:40.661]  Yes.
[02:15:40.661 --> 02:15:49.208]  Well that's, I mean they tell us that at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark, where the Ark goes into a whole warehouse of stuff.
[02:16:00.934 --> 02:16:19.081]  In Xenogenesis, one of the most amazing parts of it, and I gotta share this with everyone, chapter 13 was given to me by a dear friend, first name Will, and he had the opportunity to basically get a deathbed confession by one of the highest ranking members of the intelligence community ever to spill the beans.
[02:16:19.081 --> 02:16:25.423]  And the basis of it, the 32nd version is, is that the chemtrails are genetically modifying us.
[02:16:25.843 --> 02:16:26.603]  We're good to go.
[02:16:54.932 --> 02:16:57.815]  Bill Gates runs the program, but it's classified.
[02:16:57.815 --> 02:17:01.318]  It's in the news that they run a $5 billion a year, one program.
[02:17:01.318 --> 02:17:04.241]  They call it geoengineering.
[02:17:04.241 --> 02:17:06.443]  And then we talk about it, and they go, oh, that doesn't exist.
[02:17:06.443 --> 02:17:08.905]  There's just all sorts of crazy... Let me ask you this.
[02:17:08.905 --> 02:17:18.274]  Why in the 60s did they detonate over 100 high-power hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere, as the William Shatner Discovery Channel documentary shows, Trinity?
[02:17:19.034 --> 02:17:24.161]  Uh, Trinity and beyond to try to blow up the Van Allen radiation belt or detonate the atmosphere.
[02:17:24.161 --> 02:17:28.587]  There's London Guardian, Bill Gates backs climate scientists lobbying for large scale geoengineering.
[02:17:28.587 --> 02:17:30.029]  They're already doing it.
[02:17:30.029 --> 02:17:30.410]  Why?
[02:17:30.410 --> 02:17:31.492]  What were they trying then?
[02:17:32.705 --> 02:17:33.286]  We're good to go.
[02:17:51.483 --> 02:18:00.667]  When we're talking about the rainbow, and this is in my book Xenogenesis, and ladies and gentlemen, Alex, seriously, it's the most important thing that I've ever written.
[02:18:00.667 --> 02:18:01.848]  I don't even know where to go.
[02:18:01.848 --> 02:18:19.996]  There's nothing more I can say, but in it, just the very fact that they're trying to electromagnetically destroy the very boundaries and barriers that the Living God created to keep all this stuff out of our realm of existence because He loves us, now the Luciferians and the Globals are one in the same.
[02:18:20.436 --> 02:18:35.494]  ...are breaking every boundary, whether it's genetic, whether it's moral, whether it's philosophical, whether it's historical... Well, NASA even admits that they've never recorded this, the Earth's magnetic field is getting weaker, and the pole isn't just shifting, it's dying!
[02:18:36.448 --> 02:18:37.209]  Absolutely.
[02:18:37.209 --> 02:18:39.291]  And see, this is something people don't understand.
[02:18:39.291 --> 02:18:42.074]  It was explained to me by one of the brightest guys I've ever met.
[02:18:42.074 --> 02:18:43.816]  He's probably listening to the show or will.
[02:18:43.816 --> 02:18:47.139]  But gravity is not a wave and it's not going to get super scientific.
[02:18:47.139 --> 02:18:48.561]  It's a pressure.
[02:18:48.561 --> 02:18:51.504]  And that pressure, if you put pressure, how do you stop bleeding?
[02:18:52.424 --> 02:18:59.249]  You put your fingers or a bandage or some form of tourniquet, you try and put pressure on that to clot.
[02:18:59.249 --> 02:19:06.073]  Understand, these guys are releasing all of the darkest, evil, most wicked entities in the spirit realm.
[02:19:06.073 --> 02:19:09.435]  People can say they don't believe it, but look at where science is going.
[02:19:09.435 --> 02:19:12.457]  Look at the new movie, Transcendence, okay?
[02:19:12.457 --> 02:19:18.961]  It's not out yet, but with Johnny Depp, I promise you, when you go and see that, I've never seen it, I didn't even know it was out.
[02:19:19.461 --> 02:19:23.504]  You would swear that basically some of my chapters were integrated.
[02:19:23.504 --> 02:19:25.966]  Now, I'm not saying they stole my stuff or anything like that.
[02:19:25.966 --> 02:19:29.689]  What I'm telling you... The point is, is it's just like Superman with the Phantom Zone.
[02:19:29.689 --> 02:19:38.195]  Again, I never get into this stuff, Steve, but what I know is, whether this is real or not, the elite at Bohemian Grove Skull & Bones believe they're in contact with entities.
[02:19:38.195 --> 02:19:41.998]  They believe they're channeling them for the knowledge.
[02:19:41.998 --> 02:19:47.362]  So, regardless, the elite are sacrificing children, are running pedophile rings,
[02:19:48.344 --> 02:19:52.111]  ...are doing all of this, believing it gives them satanic power.
[02:19:52.111 --> 02:19:58.242]  So regardless, archetypally, in a Carl Jung way, this is something that needs to be looked at.
[02:19:58.242 --> 02:19:58.864]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:01.112 --> 02:20:05.054]  A lot of people's lives and bodies are out of balance.
[02:20:05.054 --> 02:20:10.536]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops optimize pH level and get rid of harmful waste and acid.

[02:20:30.683 --> 02:20:39.989]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:20:39.989 --> 02:20:40.769]  This capitalism?
[02:20:40.769 --> 02:20:46.953]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:20:46.953 --> 02:20:50.635]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:22:59.531 --> 02:23:02.374]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:23:02.374 --> 02:23:07.498]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:23:07.498 --> 02:23:15.625]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:23:15.625 --> 02:23:20.150]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:23.973]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:23:24.113 --> 02:23:30.055]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:23:30.055 --> 02:23:33.217]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:23:33.217 --> 02:23:38.599]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[02:23:38.599 --> 02:23:46.622]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.

[02:24:08.087 --> 02:24:12.411]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:24:12.411 --> 02:24:18.416]  You know, I've had Steve Quayle on probably 30 times, 40 times, I don't know, in the last 18, 19 years.
[02:24:18.416 --> 02:24:23.601]  He was one of the first guests I would get on Talk Radio back in 1996.
[02:24:25.703 --> 02:24:29.124]  I got on AXS TV in 95, and I mean, I gotta be honest.
[02:24:29.124 --> 02:24:33.945]  I knew politically he really knew what he was talking about, but I just didn't buy into all this stuff.
[02:24:33.945 --> 02:24:40.186]  I've been criticized a lot because I won't get into the esoteric stuff, the exoteric, just because I can't prove it.
[02:24:40.186 --> 02:24:42.587]  But you see the elite's obsession with it.
[02:24:42.587 --> 02:24:43.247]  They believe it.
[02:24:43.247 --> 02:24:46.508]  So whether it's true or not, they're operating like their god.
[02:24:46.508 --> 02:24:47.748]  They're going to merge with machines.
[02:24:47.748 --> 02:24:48.868]  It's all over the news.
[02:24:48.868 --> 02:24:51.829]  Bill Clinton says he wouldn't be surprised if aliens don't arrive soon.
[02:24:51.829 --> 02:24:53.630]  The Vatican's saying get ready for them to, I mean,
[02:24:55.390 --> 02:24:57.771]  Who was it that came out this week?
[02:24:57.771 --> 02:24:58.632]  Because I meant to cover it.
[02:24:58.632 --> 02:24:59.832]  Was it Henry Kissinger again?
[02:24:59.832 --> 02:25:00.953]  Who was it?
[02:25:00.953 --> 02:25:03.874]  And it said if... No, it was Clinton said in the interview, too.
[02:25:03.874 --> 02:25:05.855]  In fact, find that clip, guys.
[02:25:05.855 --> 02:25:09.377]  That if aliens attacked, it would unify us in a planetary government.
[02:25:09.377 --> 02:25:11.398]  They might have fake ones.
[02:25:11.398 --> 02:25:12.318]  I mean, who knows?
[02:25:12.318 --> 02:25:14.639]  We know Project Bluebeam was fake aliens.
[02:25:14.639 --> 02:25:19.161]  You know, what about that scenario?
[02:25:19.161 --> 02:25:21.302]  Steve Quayle of the Project Bluebeam.
[02:25:21.302 --> 02:25:22.723]  You've talked a lot about that as well.
[02:25:24.995 --> 02:25:44.970]  I think it's more sophisticated than that now, Alex, and the point being is, you know, the Bible talks about giving life to a beast or the image of a beast, but I think what's critical for people to understand is that the truth is a very, very endangered pattern of thought.
[02:25:45.530 --> 02:25:56.346]  And with all the information coming out from DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and all of the plans to read our minds, control our minds, assimilate us into the Borg.
[02:25:56.346 --> 02:25:57.868]  Look, here's the deal.
[02:25:57.868 --> 02:26:01.553]  Agenda 21 is to move people into the cities where they cannot...
[02:26:01.733 --> 02:26:05.557]  It's easier for them to kill people or control people.
[02:26:05.557 --> 02:26:15.566]  The technology exists now to read minds, to basically put thoughts in our minds, and the time is coming where all, and I want to get to Hollywood really quick.
[02:26:15.566 --> 02:26:20.750]  Ladies and gentlemen, Hollywood is the mouthpiece of the Illuminati.
[02:26:20.750 --> 02:26:22.512]  You are being conditioned.
[02:26:22.512 --> 02:26:26.115]  You are being brain, not washed, you're being brain dunged.
[02:26:29.039 --> 02:26:43.864]  Why would the new Captain America basically admit that there's a criminal Hydra group in control of a global government playing countries off against each other that has Google NSA systems to predict the future of the 20 million people they want to exterminate to bring in world government?
[02:26:45.815 --> 02:26:51.617]  It's almost like, and I believe this is true, and I would encourage people who are praying, people to pray about it.
[02:26:51.617 --> 02:27:05.563]  If they get a great sense of mockery, and a great sense, almost, so one guy told me, who was a Lumis, he said it's like a sexual charge out of telling people... Well in magic, in lesser magic, you have to announce it first.
[02:27:07.355 --> 02:27:15.059]  These people and entities are absolutely giving themselves high fives over how dumb the people are.
[02:27:15.059 --> 02:27:16.239]  Here's how it goes.
[02:27:16.239 --> 02:27:17.820]  We're going to tell them what we're going to do.
[02:27:17.820 --> 02:27:19.661]  We're going to reinforce them what they're going to do.
[02:27:25.709 --> 02:27:42.997]  That's why I've been told we're still alive, even though they've done a lot of harassment and attack me before, is that they get a sick satisfaction out of it, but really that's on the surface that there's a spiritual rule that they have to let us sit there and tell what they're doing from also the good perspective.
[02:27:44.770 --> 02:27:47.991]  Again, I've asked, I've tried to get off talk radio.
[02:27:47.991 --> 02:27:57.936]  I left a couple times, you probably heard, and then, you know, basically, the Lord said, nope, go back on, because I believe I've been a watchman in the classic sense of telling people what's going to happen.
[02:27:57.936 --> 02:28:02.578]  And, you know, you don't, I don't know how you handle it, Alex, but I really do get tired sometimes of,
[02:28:03.158 --> 02:28:03.918]  Yeah, when was that?
[02:28:03.918 --> 02:28:05.279]  You wrote that like in 98, right?
[02:28:28.513 --> 02:28:30.074]  I mean, how long ago was that?
[02:28:30.074 --> 02:28:34.018]  Now we see what we're seeing and people are still shaking their heads and don't believe it.
[02:28:34.018 --> 02:28:43.205]  You know, when I could quote 468-6605 and all the other patents, you know, that's our patent and just... There's more than 10,000 patents on weather control.
[02:28:43.205 --> 02:28:46.088]  The Eastman patents, I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:28:48.779 --> 02:28:51.721]  Well, you ask yourself, and I came to this conclusion.
[02:28:51.721 --> 02:28:53.742]  Number one, I want to be obedient to the living God.
[02:28:53.742 --> 02:28:56.943]  Number two, I really do like people.
[02:28:56.943 --> 02:28:57.723]  I love people.
[02:28:57.723 --> 02:28:59.244]  I don't want them to die.
[02:28:59.244 --> 02:29:01.105]  I hate the enemy.
[02:29:01.105 --> 02:29:02.926]  I hate the works of darkness.
[02:29:02.926 --> 02:29:09.089]  And by the way, you and I are still alive by the intercessors out there that are praying for us night and day.
[02:29:09.549 --> 02:29:23.698]  There are times I pray, and you know this, and I'm not saying whoopee, I'm just saying, there are times when I've asked the radio audience that I've got, and sometimes, you know, it's in the millions on Doug Hagman, to pray for you, because I know what their plans are.
[02:29:23.698 --> 02:29:25.219]  But guess what, Alex?
[02:29:25.219 --> 02:29:26.840]  God always has a remnant.
[02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:32.323]  A little Hispanic lady, I'll give this to you, bless you for the rest of your life, her name was Mary Juarez.
[02:29:32.483 --> 02:29:33.904]  Stay there, stay there, we gotta go to break.
[02:29:33.904 --> 02:29:36.247]  Tell us what Mary Warris said on the other side.
[02:29:36.247 --> 02:29:37.688]  We've got a V for Vendetta intro.
[02:29:37.688 --> 02:29:46.717]  And then we're gonna go directly, and you'll be with us, Steve, for any comments you've got to the rancher, the patriarch out there, the 53 families that have been run out.
[02:29:46.717 --> 02:29:48.078]  He's the last standing.
[02:29:48.078 --> 02:29:50.240]  We're gonna be talking to him.
[02:29:50.240 --> 02:29:51.622]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.622 --> 02:29:54.164]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.164 --> 02:29:56.847]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.448 --> 02:30:04.769]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[02:30:04.769 --> 02:30:07.189]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[02:30:07.189 --> 02:30:15.791]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[02:30:15.791 --> 02:30:31.094]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum
[02:30:31.354 --> 02:30:31.874]  I'm good.
[02:31:01.414 --> 02:31:06.138]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[02:31:06.138 --> 02:31:09.240]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[02:31:09.240 --> 02:31:14.805]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:31:14.805 --> 02:31:16.746]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:31:16.746 --> 02:31:18.387]  We are what we eat.
[02:31:18.387 --> 02:31:23.051]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:31:23.051 --> 02:31:27.294]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:31:27.294 --> 02:31:29.556]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:31:29.816 --> 02:31:36.058]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:32:01.412 --> 02:32:04.494]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:04.494 --> 02:32:06.636]  The latest in preparedness is now here.
[02:32:06.636 --> 02:32:12.582]  An electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home cabinet and preparedness pack alike.
[02:32:12.802 --> 02:32:17.866]  Concentrated to 30 parts per million in what has been dubbed the Survival Silver Solution.
[02:32:17.866 --> 02:32:22.769]  The new InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver is the answer for you and your family.
[02:32:22.769 --> 02:32:27.592]  And it's entirely free of toxic artificial additives that are loaded into many products.
[02:32:27.592 --> 02:32:36.198]  The InfoWars Life Silver Bullet Silver is so powerful that it is concentrated into a 2-ounce bottle and is not recommended for extended continual use.
[02:32:36.198 --> 02:32:38.340]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[02:32:38.340 --> 02:32:41.262]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers
[02:32:41.462 --> 02:32:42.022]  We're good to go.
[02:33:15.282 --> 02:33:27.157]  And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment.
[02:33:27.157 --> 02:33:31.442]  You now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity.
[02:33:31.442 --> 02:33:33.705]  Nobody is listening to your telephones.
[02:33:38.424 --> 02:33:40.664]  What difference, at this point, does it make?
[02:33:40.664 --> 02:33:45.205]  But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.
[02:33:45.205 --> 02:33:49.866]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[02:33:49.866 --> 02:33:51.967]  You've got a business, and you didn't build that.
[02:33:51.967 --> 02:33:53.587]  Somebody else made that happen.
[02:33:53.587 --> 02:33:55.027]  How did this happen?
[02:33:55.027 --> 02:33:56.328]  Who's to blame?
[02:33:56.328 --> 02:34:01.129]  Remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words.
[02:34:01.129 --> 02:34:02.269]  They are perspectives.
[02:34:06.698 --> 02:34:12.162]  That extremism in the defense of liberty is no bias.
[02:34:12.162 --> 02:34:18.947]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:34:18.947 --> 02:34:20.068]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:34:40.734 --> 02:34:45.217]  Our Knoxville affiliate, WKVL, made this for us.
[02:34:45.217 --> 02:34:48.139]  Great job for those guys over at Knox Talk.
[02:34:48.139 --> 02:34:53.263]  They carry our show there at night and also live on the weekend for the Sunday transmission.
[02:34:53.263 --> 02:34:57.947]  We are joined by the patriarch of the Bundy family.
[02:34:59.456 --> 02:35:17.248]  And we had his son on the broadcast earlier, Ayman Bundy, but Cliven Bundy joins us now, riding shotgun with us, is Steve Quayle, just covering the really deep stuff inside this whole new rule or takeover and what makes them tick and why they're doing this.
[02:35:17.248 --> 02:35:26.795]  I'm sure he'll have some questions riding shotgun with us as well, but we take you now to Nevada, right on the border there with Arizona, where now over 300 armed feds are.
[02:35:26.795 --> 02:35:28.876]  Yesterday they attacked men and women
[02:35:29.757 --> 02:35:41.887]  With tasers and the videos up on Infowars.com and with attack dogs for being on the side of the state highway on the property where they have the grazing rights.
[02:35:41.887 --> 02:35:47.111]  They have cattle crossing signs up right there put up by the state.
[02:35:47.111 --> 02:35:49.393]  The governor has said clearly this is grazing rights.
[02:35:49.393 --> 02:35:51.434]  They've been there since 1877.
[02:35:51.434 --> 02:35:53.156]  They have the foraging rights.
[02:35:53.156 --> 02:35:55.117]  Explain that to people out there.
[02:35:55.117 --> 02:35:56.679]  The government just declared it was theirs.
[02:35:57.914 --> 02:36:06.978]  And then they taser his son over and over again, but he just pulls them out of him.
[02:36:06.978 --> 02:36:09.319]  That's the difference between a real cowboy family...
[02:36:10.822 --> 02:36:11.863]  Out there and rugged.
[02:36:11.863 --> 02:36:14.265]  I mean, it's hard to make a living.
[02:36:14.265 --> 02:36:23.914]  People in Texas that have got East Texas, nice grass, you know, we can't even pay the bills with cattle anymore because of what they've set up.
[02:36:23.914 --> 02:36:31.660]  And I've talked about that a lot, how they've rigged it with the big meat packers, putting the little meat packers out of business with the government regulators.
[02:36:31.660 --> 02:36:35.584]  No matter how dirty the big ones are, if you have one problem with your small outfit, you're shut down.
[02:36:35.584 --> 02:36:37.686]  Or even if it's a big outfit, if it's privately owned.
[02:36:39.036 --> 02:36:41.777]  And then they cornered the market.
[02:36:41.777 --> 02:36:44.718]  And so it's at a record high price.
[02:36:44.718 --> 02:36:46.579]  People are going out of the business.
[02:36:46.579 --> 02:36:48.300]  System doesn't care.
[02:36:48.300 --> 02:36:51.121]  They'll charge you $10,000 for a steak.
[02:36:51.121 --> 02:36:53.502]  A good steak used to be 20 bucks three or four years ago.
[02:36:53.502 --> 02:36:56.723]  Now it's 50 bucks.
[02:36:56.723 --> 02:37:01.244]  I remember 20 years ago a good steak was 15 bucks, 10 bucks.
[02:37:01.244 --> 02:37:02.205]  This is what's happening.
[02:37:03.243 --> 02:37:04.985]  As they shut down the resources.
[02:37:04.985 --> 02:37:06.967]  53 ranching families out there.
[02:37:06.967 --> 02:37:07.848]  All run out of business.
[02:37:07.848 --> 02:37:09.369]  This is the last family.
[02:37:09.369 --> 02:37:14.254]  And David Knight, tell us what's happened since we talked to you two hours ago.
[02:37:14.254 --> 02:37:19.099]  And then I want to get Mr. Bunny to give us his take on the brutal assaults yesterday.
[02:37:19.099 --> 02:37:22.663]  But even after that, the feds had to back off because their tasers weren't working.
[02:37:22.663 --> 02:37:25.806]  So one of them ran over and body slammed basically a woman from behind.
[02:37:26.787 --> 02:37:29.348]  I've seen that where it's like they'll be a guy in a wheelchair and they'll just attack him.
[02:37:29.348 --> 02:37:31.969]  It's like some instinct of evil to attack the weak.
[02:37:31.969 --> 02:37:33.710]  I don't understand it.
[02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:35.770]  So give us any updates of what's unfolded.
[02:37:35.770 --> 02:37:41.992]  You're there at the Bundy Ranch house that I know there's snipers across the street and surveillance cameras.
[02:37:41.992 --> 02:37:44.893]  David Knight reporting from Nevada.
[02:37:44.893 --> 02:37:45.494]  That's right, Alex.
[02:37:45.494 --> 02:37:48.955]  We're here at the Bundy Ranch and I have Mr. Cliven Bundy next to me.
[02:37:49.631 --> 02:37:50.611]  He is the man right now.
[02:37:50.611 --> 02:37:57.493]  The federal government is set out to destroy, but they will come for you next if you don't stand for your rights.
[02:37:57.493 --> 02:38:03.294]  And he and a lot of other people have gathered here to support him in his struggle with the federal government.
[02:38:03.294 --> 02:38:09.055]  I want to ask him what he's heard, if anything, anything positive from any state or congressional figures.
[02:38:09.055 --> 02:38:12.036]  Have you heard anything positive from anybody that supports you?
[02:38:12.036 --> 02:38:14.736]  Yes, I did hear from the governor of Nevada.
[02:38:14.736 --> 02:38:18.597]  He made a stand a couple of days ago now.
[02:38:19.110 --> 02:38:28.013]  But he did say that he asked the federal government to take down the First Amendment area signs.
[02:38:28.013 --> 02:38:40.658]  Now these First Amendment signs are like 50 by 50 foot pig pens that the United States has allowed us to get inside of these pig pens and exercise our First Amendment rights.
[02:38:40.658 --> 02:38:43.259]  Now our governor did do that much for us.
[02:38:44.542 --> 02:38:56.629]  Well, I still saw one of them as we were coming in, and as we were driving down Interstate 15, there was one area, it was so small, and they had like a electronic sign that said media only here, and it was in the middle of nowhere.
[02:38:56.629 --> 02:39:00.452]  There was absolutely nothing that you could see anywhere about anything there.
[02:39:00.452 --> 02:39:04.494]  Yeah, you know, the media, I mean, what about the rest of our First Amendment rights?
[02:39:04.494 --> 02:39:10.778]  You know, we've got to go down the road and get in this pig pen before we can exercise it, but I'm thankful we can at least exercise our rights.
[02:39:11.651 --> 02:39:23.938]  Uh, now there are going to be some politicians that are going to show up at about 5 o'clock this afternoon, our time here in Pacific Time, and we don't really know what they're going to say, whether they're going to be in support of you, or they're just going to try to calm the crowd down.
[02:39:23.938 --> 02:39:25.179]  What do you think?
[02:39:25.179 --> 02:39:30.482]  Well, I'm sure they're going to be supportive of me, and then when they go to the other side, they'll bring support over there also.
[02:39:30.482 --> 02:39:31.863]  That's what a politician is!
[02:39:31.863 --> 02:39:32.984]  That's right.
[02:39:33.567 --> 02:39:34.407]  That's right.
[02:39:34.407 --> 02:39:44.449]  Uh, give us some idea of, uh, have you heard anything from the lady who was attacked from behind by the people when your son got tasered three times and some other people got tasered last night?
[02:39:44.449 --> 02:39:45.610]  Have you heard anything about her?
[02:39:45.610 --> 02:39:46.890]  Is she okay?
[02:39:46.890 --> 02:39:53.872]  Well, I know that, you know, she was a little, the smallest person there, probably maybe the oldest also, and definitely the weakest.
[02:39:53.872 --> 02:39:54.972]  She just got through with, uh,
[02:39:56.008 --> 02:39:59.151]  Uh, uh, throat cancer for three years now.
[02:39:59.151 --> 02:40:02.393]  And here they come up behind her and pick her up and throw her on the ground.
[02:40:02.393 --> 02:40:07.917]  Uh, they could have picked on some of these bigger ones, but you know, that's kind of predator instinct, isn't it?
[02:40:07.917 --> 02:40:11.780]  As a pack of wolves, they usually single out the weakest and smallest of the, yes.
[02:40:11.780 --> 02:40:13.641]  And you know, they, they don't start from the head.
[02:40:13.641 --> 02:40:16.003]  They start from the back end when they start eating.
[02:40:16.003 --> 02:40:18.185]  And that's, that's exactly what these people have done.
[02:40:19.614 --> 02:40:27.961]  Give us an idea, because we've had a lot of people that have criticized you and said, well, he's grazing on government land.
[02:40:27.961 --> 02:40:35.588]  Talk about the grazing rights and the water rights and the fact that we have property rights that we register in counties for our homes.
[02:40:36.839 --> 02:40:41.921]  The first thing we need to make clear is who owns this land, and that's really not clear.
[02:40:41.921 --> 02:40:50.864]  We have a federal judge that says the United States owns this land, and we have the United States Constitution that says Nevada owns this land.
[02:40:50.864 --> 02:40:53.304]  So this is where I'm at.
[02:40:53.304 --> 02:40:54.685]  Let's talk about my grazing fee.
[02:40:54.685 --> 02:40:56.646]  Who am I supposed to pay my grazing fee to?
[02:40:58.513 --> 02:41:02.497]  Constitutional sovereignty of Nevada that owns this land?
[02:41:02.497 --> 02:41:08.943]  That's who I'd pay my grazing fee to, but no, the one I get the grazing fee bill from is the United States government.
[02:41:08.943 --> 02:41:17.030]  I don't recognize them having any jurisdiction or authority over this land, and I do not have a contract with the United States government.
[02:41:17.679 --> 02:41:24.665]  We were just speaking to a county commissioner from Utah, and he was talking about the fact that they're seeing the same things there.
[02:41:24.665 --> 02:41:27.868]  And the confusion is, is that you're not even working with one federal agency.
[02:41:27.868 --> 02:41:33.813]  You've got the BLM that says one thing, then you've got Fish and Wildlife that says something else, so they don't even give you the same story from the feds.
[02:41:34.415 --> 02:41:37.796]  Oh, they got so many bureaus in this United States.
[02:41:37.796 --> 02:41:40.297]  Everything's bureau, bureau, bureau.
[02:41:40.297 --> 02:41:44.119]  They think they have jurisdiction and authority in many different places.
[02:41:44.119 --> 02:41:47.000]  I urge you, read the Constitution.
[02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:52.522]  Those founding fathers laid out how we're supposed to act and they have all the answers already laid out for us.
[02:41:52.522 --> 02:41:56.344]  Why don't we live that Constitution and be happy in America?
[02:41:56.764 --> 02:41:57.185]  That's right.
[02:41:57.185 --> 02:42:02.209]  We have the 10th Amendment that says if they don't specifically have these powers, they don't enumerate it in the Constitution.
[02:42:02.209 --> 02:42:04.350]  It's not there, so we haven't seen anything about that.
[02:42:04.350 --> 02:42:05.731]  But this is not just your fight.
[02:42:05.731 --> 02:42:07.153]  This is something that has happened.
[02:42:07.153 --> 02:42:16.300]  Talk about when they first initiated this attack against the local ranchers here, shutting them down, because there used to be 52 other ranchers in this area.
[02:42:16.300 --> 02:42:18.322]  Talk about what they did to them at that time.
[02:42:18.322 --> 02:42:23.526]  Well, what they did is they administrated, regulated until they couldn't ranch anymore.
[02:42:24.102 --> 02:42:25.723]  In other words, they broke them.
[02:42:25.723 --> 02:42:30.126]  They put those producers that used to produce meat for you out of business.
[02:42:30.126 --> 02:42:33.108]  You wonder why beef costs so much?
[02:42:33.108 --> 02:42:35.430]  You know, you go to the hamburger cost of it.
[02:42:35.430 --> 02:42:40.233]  Well, we used to produce that, and now these producers have gone all across the United States.
[02:42:40.233 --> 02:42:45.017]  They've administrated, regulated, until we give up.
[02:42:45.017 --> 02:42:46.858]  And I'm not giving up.
[02:42:46.858 --> 02:42:48.439]  I've seen some information.
[02:42:48.439 --> 02:42:50.681]  Of course, there's a lot of developers that are allowed to
[02:42:51.698 --> 02:42:56.482]  Well, solar power is just a rumor, but what they're wanting to do here on my ranch is create a federal conservation area.
[02:43:18.052 --> 02:43:19.373]  And so that's part of the deal.
[02:43:19.373 --> 02:43:25.239]  In other words, they forgot about the tortoise, they're down there killing the tortoise, and now they've got a new project.
[02:43:25.239 --> 02:43:29.123]  And so the tortoise is old, the conservation area is new.
[02:43:29.123 --> 02:43:41.194]  Well, because the long-range plan here is an Agenda 21 plan, where they make most of the United States off-limit to all humans, the rest of it highly regulated in a few concentrated urban areas.
[02:43:41.644 --> 02:43:42.665]  You know, that's true.
[02:43:42.665 --> 02:43:46.509]  You can see the Agenda 21 blueprint here.
[02:43:46.509 --> 02:43:49.892]  For example, what they want to do is close off this area.
[02:43:49.892 --> 02:43:52.434]  And in order to close it off, I've got an invested interest.
[02:43:52.434 --> 02:43:58.920]  They want to get rid of my cattle and get rid of my range improvement, get rid of my access rights, and then they'll close it off.
[02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:00.521]  But they won't close it off 100%.
[02:44:00.521 --> 02:44:02.243]  Remember about the First Amendment area?
[02:44:02.910 --> 02:44:17.581]  They'll give you a First Preliminary, and now what they're going to do is give you a trail, a sidewalk, down through this desert, back country by way, 51 miles, and they're going to say, public, you have access to your public land, and here it is.
[02:44:18.263 --> 02:44:21.745]  Stay on the sidewalk and don't get off on the grass or we'll give you a $500.
[02:44:21.745 --> 02:44:25.087]  And that way they can harass the daylight.
[02:44:25.087 --> 02:44:26.928]  It ruins the picnic.
[02:44:26.928 --> 02:44:27.368]  That's right.
[02:44:27.368 --> 02:44:27.949]  That's right.
[02:44:27.949 --> 02:44:28.769]  Absolutely.
[02:44:28.769 --> 02:44:30.270]  And they treat you like total crud everywhere.
[02:44:30.270 --> 02:44:35.273]  They don't want the scum in even the national parks and other areas anymore.
[02:44:35.273 --> 02:44:37.454]  I mean, it is just total slave training.
[02:44:37.454 --> 02:44:43.197]  I want to get Steve Quayle in here with one of his questions because he's out west as well and has dealt with this BLM garbage.
[02:44:43.197 --> 02:44:47.400]  I want him to be able to ask a question that you can relay there to Mr. Bundy.
[02:44:48.356 --> 02:44:52.563]  But what does he make of these state reps that are showing up?
[02:44:52.563 --> 02:44:55.969]  They need to go over and get in the face of these feds like the Swiss.
[02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:59.410]  Federal Reps did when we were covering Bilderberg.
[02:44:59.410 --> 02:45:01.671]  They actually went and demanded people be arrested.
[02:45:01.671 --> 02:45:03.511]  And they went in and got beaten up.
[02:45:03.511 --> 02:45:12.133]  And then when that happened, then the state police came in, and then they had to back off, and a bunch of helicopters took off, and the globalists actually left.
[02:45:12.133 --> 02:45:12.973]  So it was a big deal.
[02:45:12.973 --> 02:45:15.234]  And then the Swiss suddenly said, get out, Bilderberg.
[02:45:15.234 --> 02:45:16.754]  We don't want you.
[02:45:16.754 --> 02:45:18.374]  You know, the Swiss, of course, are famous for doing that.
[02:45:18.374 --> 02:45:20.715]  Their country started that way.
[02:45:20.715 --> 02:45:23.135]  For people that don't know, William Tell and the rest of it.
[02:45:23.135 --> 02:45:25.556]  But we need to get back to understanding that.
[02:45:26.756 --> 02:45:28.437]  Bottom line, ask him about this.
[02:45:28.437 --> 02:45:32.100]  He said when enough people get there, he's going to try to march in and get the cattle.
[02:45:32.100 --> 02:45:36.723]  The 300 they're holding, I know 30 were gotten out today by cowboys that went through the blockade.
[02:45:36.723 --> 02:45:39.725]  DrudgeReport.com is linked to that story right now.
[02:45:39.725 --> 02:45:43.008]  20 cowboys break fed blockade in Nevada, retrieved cattle.
[02:45:43.008 --> 02:45:49.272]  That's up on DrudgeReport.com if you want to see that and the video of screen stills and screenshots and the rest of it.
[02:45:49.272 --> 02:45:54.456]  A Don Salazar article is up there right now.
[02:45:54.456 --> 02:45:55.857]  So bring that up to him.
[02:45:56.457 --> 02:46:07.924]  And bring up what the flashpoint could be here, because he's saying he'll do whatever he has to, to not be, you know, have his grazing rights stolen by these pirates.
[02:46:07.924 --> 02:46:11.946]  Okay, Alex wanted to get an update as to what the disposition of the cattle are.
[02:46:11.946 --> 02:46:16.869]  We've got a story up on Drudge right now about the cattle that were rescued this morning.
[02:46:16.869 --> 02:46:21.612]  Are there any plans to try to, I know you're trying to locate the cattle that have already been taken, is that correct?
[02:46:22.077 --> 02:46:26.420]  Yes, the 300 head of cattle have been taken off my ranch.
[02:46:26.420 --> 02:46:28.182]  We're not totally sure where they're at.
[02:46:28.182 --> 02:46:32.365]  They could be in the compound, but they could also be in Colorado.
[02:46:32.365 --> 02:46:43.213]  It would seem strange that we could lose 300 head of cattle, but we have right now lost 300 head of cattle, and we got airplanes in the air, we got people out looking, sheriffs across the country.
[02:46:44.015 --> 02:46:47.878]  We will find these cattle and we'll hunt every one of them down if they're gone.
[02:46:47.878 --> 02:46:54.583]  And that's something new that you've got somebody helping you with an airplane spotting to try to find where they've stored the cattle in this area if they're here.
[02:46:54.583 --> 02:46:56.164]  Yes, that's new this morning.
[02:46:56.164 --> 02:46:57.225]  Okay.
[02:46:57.225 --> 02:47:01.989]  And Alex wanted to ask, what do you think is going to happen?
[02:47:01.989 --> 02:47:03.070]  What would be a flashpoint?
[02:47:03.070 --> 02:47:04.631]  What are you willing to do with this?
[02:47:04.631 --> 02:47:05.752]  Or where does it go from here?
[02:47:05.752 --> 02:47:07.653]  How do you see this resolved?
[02:47:07.653 --> 02:47:10.155]  Well, I think we're... Well, I know what I'm going to do.
[02:47:10.155 --> 02:47:11.396]  I'm going to do whatever it takes.
[02:47:12.319 --> 02:47:17.542]  And the public and the protesters here, I think they're ready to do whatever it takes too.
[02:47:17.542 --> 02:47:20.143]  So in other words, this thing's not going to get over tomorrow.
[02:47:20.143 --> 02:47:30.808]  We're going to fight until we win this, get our public lands back, and my cattle back, and we're going to ranch in and produce good red meat for you.
[02:47:30.808 --> 02:47:32.308]  You know how good a steak tastes?
[02:47:32.308 --> 02:47:33.689]  That's what I produce.
[02:47:33.689 --> 02:47:34.770]  That's great.
[02:47:34.770 --> 02:47:35.510]  More power to you.
[02:47:35.510 --> 02:47:35.810]  Thank you.
[02:47:35.810 --> 02:47:36.691]  Any other questions, Alex?
[02:47:41.343 --> 02:47:47.651]  He's got to, yeah, he's got to go to another, I know that Steve Quill had a quick question for you, but Mr. Bundy's got to go with another interview.
[02:47:47.651 --> 02:47:48.833]  Thank you so much for your time.
[02:47:48.833 --> 02:47:49.834]  Thank you very much.
[02:47:49.834 --> 02:47:51.717]  Best of luck to you, and thank you for standing up for our rights.
[02:47:53.007 --> 02:47:54.228]  Well, we're going to be following this story.
[02:47:54.228 --> 02:47:58.110]  We're going to head back to the protesting area, see what's happening there.
[02:47:58.110 --> 02:48:00.431]  I know that some politicians are going to be making speeches.
[02:48:00.431 --> 02:48:05.214]  As Alex said, they need to be making the speeches to the Bureau of Land Management.
[02:48:05.214 --> 02:48:09.196]  They need to be making the speeches to these unelected regulators.
[02:48:09.196 --> 02:48:14.919]  Nobody out here, as the county commissioner that we talked to from Utah, he made a very good point.
[02:48:14.919 --> 02:48:18.301]  He said that nobody is electing these people.
[02:48:18.301 --> 02:48:19.462]  Their names are not on the ballot.
[02:48:20.074 --> 02:48:22.815]  The names of the people who are confiscating this cattle is not on the ballot.
[02:48:22.815 --> 02:48:26.036]  The names of the people who are directing them are not on the ballot.
[02:48:26.036 --> 02:48:29.337]  We have no control over these policies.
[02:48:29.337 --> 02:48:32.598]  Our congressional representatives are doing nothing.
[02:48:32.598 --> 02:48:37.980]  And these people are doing whatever they wish, without any oversight, totally out of control.
[02:48:37.980 --> 02:48:48.543]  These bureaucracies have become regulating agencies that write their own laws, have their own police force, have their own judges and juries in most cases, and you are not presumed to be innocent.
[02:48:49.065 --> 02:48:51.467]  You're presumed to be guilty and you have to prove your innocence.
[02:48:51.467 --> 02:48:53.868]  If you've ever dealt with the IRS, you know this.
[02:48:53.868 --> 02:49:08.718]  If you've ever dealt with any of these agencies, the EPA, look at the fellow in Wyoming who's facing $75,000 a day fines because he put a pond, built a pond that's not interrupting any waterway, on his own property and the EPA demanded that he remove that.
[02:49:08.718 --> 02:49:16.884]  Sure, they have a name, it's called serfdom, arresting people for gardens, arresting people for their own off-the-grid power when it's even legal, giant fines.
[02:49:16.884 --> 02:49:18.605]  I mean, it is just predatory.
[02:49:19.485 --> 02:49:24.068]  I was videotaping when I was over at my parents some zoning people across the street.
[02:49:24.068 --> 02:49:25.928]  They now wear uniforms.
[02:49:25.928 --> 02:49:28.930]  And the guy literally bugged his eyes out and said, what are you filming me for?
[02:49:28.930 --> 02:49:30.151]  I said, I said, it's America.
[02:49:30.151 --> 02:49:31.931]  And he kind of got mad and walked off.
[02:49:31.931 --> 02:49:34.573]  It's just like everyone bows down to them.
[02:49:35.353 --> 02:49:37.615]  And a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves.
[02:49:37.615 --> 02:49:39.457]  I mean, these are our servants.
[02:49:39.457 --> 02:49:42.040]  By the way, I plugged our affiliate wrong.
[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:43.822]  One of our affiliates in Knoxville.
[02:49:43.822 --> 02:49:45.684]  We have WBCR, of course.
[02:49:45.684 --> 02:49:49.948]  They're outside Knoxville for about 15, 16 years, but we also have 94.3 FM, and that's WNFZ.
[02:49:55.133 --> 02:50:10.639]  He's our great affiliate that carries us six days a week there, and they're the ones that made just that fantastic Viva Vendetta promo that you heard earlier that we were playing here on air.
[02:50:10.639 --> 02:50:14.101]  They have some great talk show hosts over there that I intend to get on as guest hosts sometime.
[02:50:14.101 --> 02:50:15.841]  I really enjoy doing their morning show.
[02:50:15.841 --> 02:50:21.804]  We're on a break, and I appreciate... We're going to skip this network break because we've got Steve Quell with us, and I've had him on hold.
[02:50:22.404 --> 02:50:27.194]  Steve, I meant for you to be able to talk to Bundy, but he's gone now.
[02:50:27.194 --> 02:50:30.321]  But I mean, what is your statement on what you're sitting there listening to?
[02:50:32.572 --> 02:50:33.513]  I don't know this.
[02:50:33.513 --> 02:50:34.454]  Maybe you do, Alex.
[02:50:34.454 --> 02:50:37.296]  Is the sheriff subject to recall?
[02:50:37.296 --> 02:50:42.380]  Because if he's not subject to recall, then the city commissioners may either hire or appoint him.
[02:50:42.380 --> 02:50:54.210]  I would make sure that everybody in that county or that area does something immediately legal and obviously non-violent is put a recall position out if it's legal or basically how
[02:50:54.730 --> 02:50:59.835]  However the process is, I would assume that the commissioners are voted in, that they recall those.
[02:50:59.835 --> 02:51:01.516]  That's where the commissioners come in.
[02:51:01.516 --> 02:51:05.720]  The sheriff has all the power over the federal government.
[02:51:05.720 --> 02:51:07.401]  Thank God for Sheriff Mack and others.
[02:51:07.401 --> 02:51:12.245]  But I'm told this sheriff, whatever his name is, you probably know it, is doing nothing.
[02:51:12.245 --> 02:51:13.687]  And basically, here's the thing.
[02:51:14.347 --> 02:51:15.387]  They want this.
[02:51:15.387 --> 02:51:21.050]  I just got an email, Alex, from someone in the know who said, make sure Alex knows that this thing is being run by the highest levels.
[02:51:21.050 --> 02:51:25.251]  Of course we know that and the DHS, but here's the deal.
[02:51:25.251 --> 02:51:32.214]  They are testing and testing and testing the resolve of the American people.
[02:51:32.214 --> 02:51:33.854]  And I want to finish one statement.
[02:51:33.854 --> 02:51:38.336]  This is what I said will bless you, Alex, because you're in the position you need this statement.
[02:51:38.928 --> 02:51:53.455]  Mary Juarez, wonderful woman, she could cast out demons when grown men couldn't hold the demon possessed down, said, remember Steve, and I share this, remember Alex, remember all you out there fighting the good fight, God always has a ram in the bush.
[02:51:53.455 --> 02:51:58.918]  That means no matter what you're called to do, he will give you the ability and the power to do it.
[02:51:59.398 --> 02:52:13.347]  So, Alex, as you and I are out there doing what we're doing, and others are doing what we're doing, everybody that works for you, everybody that works for me, everybody that works for everybody that's sick and tired of us being nothing more than pregnant women targets, children with gun targets.
[02:52:13.347 --> 02:52:19.671]  When that happened, they displayed their total contempt for humanity, and I'm talking about the target.
[02:52:19.671 --> 02:52:20.952]  You broke the story.
[02:52:20.952 --> 02:52:26.015]  I picked it up after you broke it up, or after you put it up, and then I broke it with, you know, after you did.
[02:52:26.015 --> 02:52:26.876]  But the point is,
[02:52:27.416 --> 02:52:33.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is not just to take away your rights.
[02:52:33.340 --> 02:52:36.162]  It's to ultimately take away your life.
[02:52:36.162 --> 02:52:37.783]  They have nothing but contempt.
[02:52:37.783 --> 02:52:39.444]  I'm talking about the Luciferians.
[02:52:39.444 --> 02:52:44.567]  And my prayer is for the law enforcement, for the people that get it, who understand it,
[02:52:44.927 --> 02:52:56.451]  For any Christians that still may be left in the BLM or whatever, Montana State Patrol, excuse me, Nevada State Patrol, Highway Patrol, Police Departments, to get it, to get it, to get it.
[02:52:56.451 --> 02:53:02.414]  Your children have no future if they win in Nevada.
[02:53:02.414 --> 02:53:08.776]  This is a big deal, Alex, and the fact that they would put in snipers, that tells me this is a tactical
[02:53:09.682 --> 02:53:09.982]  I don't
[02:53:32.133 --> 02:53:33.074]  Absolutely.
[02:53:33.074 --> 02:53:34.615]  People, you have got to stand.
[02:53:34.615 --> 02:53:37.597]  I put up an article on my website with all the phone numbers.
[02:53:37.597 --> 02:53:38.558]  Do you have it too, Alex?
[02:53:38.558 --> 02:53:42.661]  The commissioners on that part, the sheriff, the BLM head and everything.
[02:53:42.661 --> 02:53:44.963]  Flood those phone calls.
[02:53:44.963 --> 02:53:45.443]  Do that.
[02:53:45.443 --> 02:53:46.584]  If you can do nothing else.
[02:53:46.584 --> 02:53:47.345]  Absolutely.
[02:53:47.345 --> 02:53:48.586]  Guys, print that off for me.
[02:53:48.586 --> 02:53:52.929]  Get them to post the phone numbers and stuff up at InfoWars.com.
[02:53:52.929 --> 02:53:54.971]  Where do you have that posted on your site?
[02:53:54.971 --> 02:53:58.153]  It's under Susan Duclose's article.
[02:53:58.153 --> 02:53:59.634]  Quote the Hispanic lady.
[02:53:59.634 --> 02:54:01.236]  We never got back to you that gave you the advice.
[02:54:02.023 --> 02:54:02.904]  Well, I did.
[02:54:02.904 --> 02:54:03.344]  I'm sorry.
[02:54:03.344 --> 02:54:07.526]  I was quoting her, you know, and she was an amazing powerhouse.
[02:54:07.526 --> 02:54:09.927]  Her name was, again, Mary Juarez, but she said this.
[02:54:09.927 --> 02:54:16.371]  She said, remember, God never calls you to do anything that He won't provide His solution.
[02:54:16.371 --> 02:54:19.132]  You may think it's in your strength and power,
[02:54:19.592 --> 02:54:20.013]  I don't know.
[02:54:40.434 --> 02:54:43.995]  The power of prayer, the power of the living God, and Alex, here's the deal.
[02:54:43.995 --> 02:54:52.539]  You've come, and I've come now, to the point of evil is no longer definable by a political movement or even a mindset.
[02:54:52.539 --> 02:55:01.902]  It now has literal entities that hate human life so much, and with such contempt, that they will do anything to destroy men, women, and children.
[02:55:02.168 --> 02:55:05.490]  Well, kill, kill, I mean, kill, steal, and destroy is the devil's mission.
[02:55:05.490 --> 02:55:07.572]  And if it isn't a devil, what is it?
[02:55:07.572 --> 02:55:09.653]  Look at the fruits of the New World Order.
[02:55:09.653 --> 02:55:11.634]  It's death, disease, pain.
[02:55:11.634 --> 02:55:12.915]  It's disgusting.
[02:55:12.915 --> 02:55:14.136]  Going back to David Knight.
[02:55:14.136 --> 02:55:15.377]  David, what's coming next?
[02:55:15.377 --> 02:55:22.341]  I know you're going to have more live feeds today, more YouTube uploads, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:55:22.341 --> 02:55:30.807]  As this breaks, we saw the dramatic footage in the articles that Watson put up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that Drudge has been carrying the last three days.
[02:55:30.807 --> 02:55:32.008]  If it wasn't for Drudge,
[02:55:32.108 --> 02:55:32.190]  Yeah.
[02:55:32.938 --> 02:55:38.261]  This story wouldn't even be a nationwide story right now that Dinosaur Media is having to report on.
[02:55:38.261 --> 02:55:49.308]  But Dinosaur Media still keeps going, well, this old man claims he's got grazing rights, but the feds, everybody knows they're God, just playing on the public's ignorance about grazing rights.
[02:55:49.308 --> 02:55:52.671]  The public just is so ignorant on this.
[02:55:52.671 --> 02:55:53.931]  You know, we need to see Rand Paul.
[02:55:53.931 --> 02:55:54.932]  We need to see Ted Cruz.
[02:55:54.932 --> 02:55:57.454]  We do see the Nevada senator going public.
[02:55:57.454 --> 02:56:00.736]  Another senator making comments that this is wrong, that it's intimidation.
[02:56:00.736 --> 02:56:02.017]  But when you see the videos,
[02:56:02.717 --> 02:56:14.720]  That are up on Infowars.com of those BLM guys in their paramilitary outfits and their whole attitude of just wanting to attack people.
[02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:16.180]  I mean, these people are idiots.
[02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:20.101]  They don't understand the globalists want to play us off against each other.
[02:56:20.101 --> 02:56:22.462]  They don't understand they want to start a civil war.
[02:56:22.462 --> 02:56:26.243]  They don't understand we're all just expendable in this fight and that
[02:56:26.923 --> 02:56:28.925]  What more does this criminal government have to do?
[02:56:28.925 --> 02:56:29.785]  Fund Al Qaeda?
[02:56:29.785 --> 02:56:30.746]  Spy on us?
[02:56:30.746 --> 02:56:32.647]  Put fluoride in the water?
[02:56:32.647 --> 02:56:36.170]  Sign us on to over a thousand trillion in fake derivatives?
[02:56:36.170 --> 02:56:38.752]  I mean, the government is run by criminals at the top.
[02:56:38.752 --> 02:56:41.034]  They want a bunch of goons that'll follow orders.
[02:56:41.034 --> 02:56:47.578]  These guys really think they're gonna have a civil war and kick our butts, and what they're gonna get is absolutely blown to pieces.
[02:56:48.479 --> 02:56:54.444]  And now globalists want that to get rid of this entire group of brown shirts to bring in their UNSS.
[02:56:54.444 --> 02:56:58.067]  I mean, they are so stupid!
[02:56:58.067 --> 02:56:58.588]  That's right, Alex.
[02:56:59.349 --> 02:57:02.410]  Mr. Bundy and the Bundy family has the resolve.
[02:57:02.410 --> 02:57:03.370]  They have the backbone.
[02:57:03.370 --> 02:57:06.751]  The question is, do the politicians have any backbones?
[02:57:06.751 --> 02:57:10.612]  Are the law enforcement officers going to stand behind their oath?
[02:57:10.612 --> 02:57:14.914]  Are the American people going to quietly go into slavery and do nothing?
[02:57:14.914 --> 02:57:16.934]  These people that are here understand the issue.
[02:57:16.934 --> 02:57:21.635]  The people that we met with out here at the protest area, they understand the issue.
[02:57:21.635 --> 02:57:23.176]  They're going to stand with resolve.
[02:57:23.696 --> 02:57:25.698]  And the question is, what are the rest of the people going to do?
[02:57:25.698 --> 02:57:26.820]  This is a test for everybody.
[02:57:26.820 --> 02:57:32.085]  And describe where the town is, where the county is, for folks that want to drive there.
[02:57:32.085 --> 02:57:42.417]  This is a little south of Mesquite, and if you go south of Mesquite on Interstate 15, and if you go, what is it Josh, it's about, it's exit 212?
[02:57:44.222 --> 02:57:44.342]  112.
[02:57:44.342 --> 02:57:46.243]  Exit 112.
[02:57:46.243 --> 02:58:00.310]  If you get off and you head toward Mesquite, once you get off of 112, there's a sign that says to Mesquite or to Vegas, I think, and if you head towards Mesquite, you'll see the First Amendment area that they've marked off and somebody put their own sign on it and said the First Amendment is not an area.
[02:58:00.310 --> 02:58:06.874]  So you'll see that, you'll know you're on the right track, and then if you just keep driving down that road... Imagine, they're just announcing the county has no free speech.
[02:58:06.874 --> 02:58:07.414]  Yeah.
[02:58:07.414 --> 02:58:08.815]  These people are just despicable.
[02:58:09.431 --> 02:58:14.092]  Well, we've seen this happen at the political conventions, and of course, our politicians had nothing to say about that.
[02:58:14.092 --> 02:58:28.155]  Democrat or Republican, this has been happening at the last several political conventions for both parties, where they take all protesters exercising their specifically protected First Amendment rights to petition their leaders and to speak out and peacefully assemble.
[02:58:28.155 --> 02:58:32.616]  They stick them way out in the middle of nowhere, and that's where these designated areas are.
[02:58:32.616 --> 02:58:35.477]  There is absolutely not a soul or even a desert tortoise.
[02:58:35.657 --> 02:58:36.418]  Well, you're a slave.
[02:58:36.418 --> 02:58:43.204]  I mean, in America, you don't walk down the side of a state highway instead of federal royalty, federal gods.
[02:58:43.204 --> 02:58:46.227]  Michelle Obama tells her kids what to eat in school.
[02:58:46.227 --> 02:58:47.709]  And the 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[02:58:47.709 --> 02:58:48.469]  Overdrive coming up.
[02:58:48.469 --> 02:58:49.450]  Five more minutes with these guys.
[02:58:49.450 --> 02:58:49.791]  Stay with us.
[02:58:51.072 --> 02:58:55.115]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[02:58:55.115 --> 02:58:59.479]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[02:58:59.479 --> 02:59:03.162]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[02:59:03.162 --> 02:59:06.185]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[02:59:06.185 --> 02:59:13.771]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[02:59:13.771 --> 02:59:17.394]  On average, the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[02:59:17.594 --> 02:59:22.078]  A few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[02:59:22.078 --> 02:59:28.064]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[02:59:28.064 --> 02:59:32.128]  Fluoride is in tea, it's in coffee, it's in water, it's in bread, it's in toothpaste.
[02:59:32.128 --> 02:59:34.751]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[02:59:34.751 --> 02:59:36.072]  The establishment's not going to do it.
[02:59:36.232 --> 02:59:37.593]  It's time to take action.
[02:59:37.593 --> 02:59:39.435]  It's time to filter our water.

[02:59:51.866 --> 02:59:53.387]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:53.387 --> 02:59:55.449]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.449 --> 02:59:58.672]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.816 --> 03:00:10.662]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.662 --> 03:00:12.244]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.244 --> 03:00:13.805]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.805 --> 03:00:17.990]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.990 --> 03:00:22.055]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.782]  David Knight is out there.
[03:00:32.782 --> 03:00:34.583]  David Knight, final comments here.
[03:00:34.583 --> 03:00:36.284]  What are you planning to do?
[03:00:36.284 --> 03:00:37.985]  I know there's a lot of actions planned.
[03:00:37.985 --> 03:00:46.851]  If I was you, I would go out there to the site now and just stay there and see if they decide to beat up any more women or taser people.
[03:00:46.851 --> 03:00:48.492]  Just looking to kill some enemy forces.
[03:00:49.492 --> 03:00:51.295]  That's what we are to the occupiers.
[03:00:51.295 --> 03:00:56.281]  We literally do have a government that's fully surrendered to every criminal interest out there.
[03:00:56.281 --> 03:00:59.385]  We are the land of the chump, the home of the coward.
[03:00:59.385 --> 03:01:00.707]  But a lot of folks are showing up.
[03:01:00.707 --> 03:01:01.989]  How many people do you see out there?
[03:01:03.424 --> 03:01:13.870]  Well, when we were there earlier, we got there, I guess, about an hour after sunrise, and we didn't see very many people, but as we were driving to the Bundy Ranch, there was probably maybe a half dozen there.
[03:01:13.870 --> 03:01:16.392]  Now there's probably, I would say, what would you say, Josh?
[03:01:16.392 --> 03:01:21.115]  Maybe about 150 people or so that have showed up just before we came over here, which was about an hour ago.
[03:01:21.115 --> 03:01:22.836]  Alright, I'm gonna get over there right now.
[03:01:22.836 --> 03:01:25.758]  Who knows what circuses are unfolding, and then what else are you planning?
[03:01:26.676 --> 03:01:33.381]  Well, I was going to say, as we were coming to the Bundy Ranch, we saw all the cowboys that went out and got back some of those cattle.
[03:01:33.381 --> 03:01:40.087]  And then later at 5 o'clock Pacific Time is when the politicians are going to show up and start speechifying.
[03:01:40.087 --> 03:01:43.329]  So we're going to cover them and the crowd's reaction to that.
[03:01:43.329 --> 03:01:50.094]  No, I think the quote, politicians should become statesmen and should march onto the people's land in front of the gods.
[03:01:50.094 --> 03:01:54.198]  Because this is supposedly public land you're supposed to be able to hike on, but the gods will assault you.
[03:01:55.317 --> 03:01:57.300]  Uh, because they're gone.
[03:01:57.300 --> 03:02:00.984]  They're going to tell us that they're on our side, but I don't know that we're going to see any action from them.
[03:02:00.984 --> 03:02:13.940]  Well, I would go, I would go say, hey, Alex Jones thinks you guys, you know, should tell the politicians, hey, you're the state, you know, our representatives, you need to march up and say to these feds, hey, we're state reps.
[03:02:14.761 --> 03:02:19.124]  You know, stand aside off this, you know, state land and state right-of-way.
[03:02:19.124 --> 03:02:21.126]  We don't care if you claim you have it on the state.
[03:02:21.126 --> 03:02:22.787]  There's grazing rights here.
[03:02:22.787 --> 03:02:32.194]  And then say, and I dare those little snot-nosed punks, those little cowards with their dogs like that scares people, you know, to set their dogs on the state reps.
[03:02:32.194 --> 03:02:34.096]  I mean, we need some leadership here.
[03:02:34.096 --> 03:02:34.616]  That's right.
[03:02:34.616 --> 03:02:36.318]  Talk is very cheap.
[03:02:36.318 --> 03:02:38.059]  And hopefully we'll confront them.
[03:02:38.059 --> 03:02:39.040]  We'll ask them that question.
[03:02:39.040 --> 03:02:41.381]  All right, David Knight, and I know you'll be doing live feeds.
[03:02:41.381 --> 03:02:44.044]  I know you're going to be doing YouTube feeds as they unfold.
[03:02:45.174 --> 03:02:47.776]  Just great job and Godspeed, my friend.
[03:02:47.776 --> 03:02:49.297]  And we'll be doing a Ustream as well.
[03:02:49.297 --> 03:02:51.158]  We'll be doing a live Ustream as well.
[03:02:51.158 --> 03:02:59.123]  And we're going to have that, I'm going to have Kurt and him post that, maybe in the one that's on Drudge at the bottom of the article about the cattle, the folks taking the cattle back.
[03:02:59.123 --> 03:03:04.127]  Maybe at the bottom of that we can post, and some of the other articles, we can post some of the Ustreams and links.
[03:03:04.127 --> 03:03:05.948]  It'll all be up on InfoWars.com.
[03:03:05.948 --> 03:03:09.210]  And we'll have more tonight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:03:09.210 --> 03:03:11.912]  And I appreciate your courage going out there and doing this, David.
[03:03:11.912 --> 03:03:12.532]  God bless you.
[03:03:12.532 --> 03:03:13.073]  You and Josh.
[03:03:13.936 --> 03:03:14.718]  Thank you.
[03:03:14.718 --> 03:03:16.222]  We would rather not be anywhere else.
[03:03:16.222 --> 03:03:17.505]  This is where it's happening right now.
[03:03:17.505 --> 03:03:20.694]  And I'm about to send you guys, who am I sending to the Boston Marathon?
[03:03:20.694 --> 03:03:21.235]  That's next week.
[03:03:22.345 --> 03:03:25.166]  Yeah, that's going to be powerful.
[03:03:25.166 --> 03:03:31.088]  And again, folks, I go on the ground some as well, you know, Bilderberg and other events, snuck into Bohemian Grove and hundreds of actions.
[03:03:31.088 --> 03:03:36.429]  It's just that administratively, there's so much here that if I leave, it would disintegrate.
[03:03:36.429 --> 03:03:37.630]  We've got a great crew.
[03:03:37.630 --> 03:03:38.930]  I have to be here constantly.
[03:03:38.930 --> 03:03:39.570]  It's killing me.
[03:03:39.570 --> 03:03:43.992]  I'm trying to get great managers in place so I'll be out doing things more because I would love to be there as well.
[03:03:46.041 --> 03:03:47.182]  In a way, I don't want to be there, though.
[03:03:47.182 --> 03:03:51.066]  It would make me so angry being around those thugs, but it's just getting more and more insane.
[03:03:51.066 --> 03:03:54.529]  But, you know, I'm kind of the general in the rear with the gear, but I just salute our guys.
[03:03:54.529 --> 03:03:56.931]  Okay, Steve Quayle, 60 seconds, final comment.
[03:03:56.931 --> 03:03:58.653]  Thanks for riding a shotgun with us for two hours.
[03:04:00.703 --> 03:04:02.544]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a fight for your life.
[03:04:02.544 --> 03:04:05.626]  These people are dead serious about wanting you dead.
[03:04:05.626 --> 03:04:10.028]  And let me take the argument over gun control into a really important point.
[03:04:10.028 --> 03:04:11.229]  Simply, Alex, it's this.
[03:04:11.229 --> 03:04:12.950]  It's not about taking the guns away.
[03:04:12.950 --> 03:04:14.951]  It's about killing the gun owners.
[03:04:14.951 --> 03:04:19.294]  I broke this story almost 15 years ago about the Red Lists, the Blue Lists, and the Green Lists.
[03:04:19.294 --> 03:04:26.278]  And what we're dealing with right now is they're using all federal agents and local police as the Blue Lists.
[03:04:26.658 --> 03:04:29.019]  The red list are the people that get killed in the first 30 days.
[03:04:29.019 --> 03:04:32.081]  The blue list are the ones that follow 30 to 60 days after that.
[03:04:32.081 --> 03:04:36.463]  They want law enforcement turned on the people and people turned on them.
[03:04:36.463 --> 03:04:37.824]  I pray that they're smart enough.
[03:04:37.824 --> 03:04:41.065]  Those people out there, the thugs, will have a real revelation.
[03:04:41.065 --> 03:04:41.926]  God bless everyone.
[03:04:41.926 --> 03:04:44.147]  God bless you, Alex, and keep you safe.
[03:04:44.147 --> 03:04:45.108]  Thank you so much, Steve.
[03:04:45.108 --> 03:04:47.029]  Let me say bye to you when this ends in a moment.
[03:04:47.029 --> 03:04:49.210]  Folks, remember what we broke two weeks ago.
[03:04:50.464 --> 03:04:58.919]  The documents that NLE 14 was trying to take on conservative libertarians who were against socialism calling us terrorists during martial law.
