[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.440 --> 00:18.960]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.960 --> 00:38.520]  Texas Alex Jones welcome it is Monday the 25th day of July 2011 we're gonna be
[00:38.520 --> 00:43.320]  live here for at least the next three hours obviously we're going to break down
[00:43.320 --> 00:49.560]  all the different angles that are very very suspicious in the Norway bombing
[00:49.560 --> 00:55.920]  and shooting spree now being used to quote crackdown on conservatives
[00:55.920 --> 01:00.880]  worldwide surveil conservatives put conservatives on no-fly no-gun
[01:00.880 --> 01:06.720]  by last now this is being called for just all over the mainstream corporate
[01:06.720 --> 01:14.360]  globalist media the Financial Times of London is running the headline today
[01:14.360 --> 01:22.680]  killer personifies the rise of the new right and remember that show earlier in
[01:22.680 --> 01:28.320]  the year from MSNBC demonizing yours truly and Ron Paul claiming that we are
[01:28.320 --> 01:33.840]  calling for violence and editing clips of Ron Paul and myself any regular
[01:33.840 --> 01:38.080]  listener knows we're calling for no violence if it's offensive we are for
[01:38.080 --> 01:41.720]  defending ourselves but this whole thing is about how we're going to cause
[01:41.720 --> 01:46.280]  violence and we're calling for it and it was called rise of the new right and
[01:46.280 --> 01:53.240]  then here's the Financial Times of London killer personifies rise of the new
[01:53.240 --> 02:03.080]  right so we're going to be going over this today also we have Robert Jepa
[02:03.080 --> 02:07.880]  Stuel who was on with a Friday Sunday and will be on with today from Norway to
[02:07.880 --> 02:13.520]  get his take on all the latest developments it turns out that the
[02:13.520 --> 02:20.520]  shooter Bravik won't serve even 30 years in jail he'll serve less than a hundred
[02:20.520 --> 02:27.080]  days per person that he's reportedly killed and now it turns out this is on
[02:27.080 --> 02:30.480]  channel four in England their reporter talked to the police and other
[02:30.480 --> 02:39.600]  witnesses that they knew Anders Bravik's name before they had arrested him and
[02:39.600 --> 02:43.000]  then as he's shooting people they gave him a chance to put the gun down and
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.000]  turn himself in very very bizarre and it is confirmed now he is a high-level
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.040]  Mason he is part of the real Knights template organization that still meets
[02:53.040 --> 02:59.560]  in England and so he will go to basically a five-star Norway and Austria
[02:59.560 --> 03:07.360]  known for having literal country club prisons and that he will live a lavish
[03:07.360 --> 03:14.680]  lifestyle for less than 30 years we pull up the exact number here for you
[03:14.680 --> 03:24.160]  think I think it's a 25 so he will serve less than three decades in jail
[03:24.160 --> 03:35.680]  hmm yes 21 years excuse me see my mind has trouble dealing with this so I was
[03:35.680 --> 03:44.520]  imagining more years for him it's 21 years or 80 can't hear you how many
[03:44.520 --> 03:54.120]  days 80 days per death so 82 days per death and 21 years total in a lavish
[03:54.120 --> 04:00.840]  facility so we're gonna be going over all of this Anders bearing Bravik
[04:00.840 --> 04:06.960]  manufactured Patsy key article by Paul Joseph Watson where it's confirmed that
[04:06.960 --> 04:12.560]  his Facebook after he was arrested was altered and the fact that he's pro-gay
[04:12.560 --> 04:20.120]  liberal quote nationalist and a bunch of other things that wouldn't that you
[04:20.120 --> 04:29.800]  wouldn't define him as a conservative or libertarian that is all been removed all
[04:29.800 --> 04:35.280]  of the liberal stuff has been removed and the conservative stuff added so the
[04:35.280 --> 04:40.200]  question is who did this to his Facebook massive evidence of this being
[04:40.200 --> 04:45.560]  completely and totally staged and of course the police arriving on the island
[04:45.560 --> 04:55.720]  and saying hey Bravik put your hands up the question is how did they know that
[04:55.720 --> 05:01.920]  got a lot of other news as well coming up stay with us a very wealthy US citizen
[05:01.920 --> 05:06.200]  is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in
[05:06.200 --> 05:10.560]  America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything about our lives

[07:09.200 --> 07:13.520]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[07:13.520 --> 07:17.920]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[07:17.920 --> 07:22.360]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[07:22.360 --> 07:27.120]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[07:27.120 --> 07:30.920]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[07:30.920 --> 07:34.560]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[07:34.560 --> 07:38.920]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[07:38.920 --> 07:42.200]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar powered

[08:04.520 --> 08:10.000]  Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:10.360 --> 08:18.280]  okay my friends we are live it is the 25th day of July 2011 on this Monday
[08:18.280 --> 08:23.280]  edition popping back in with us coming up at about 30 minutes is one of the
[08:23.280 --> 08:30.800]  survivors of the bombing attack in Oslo Norway Robert Jeff Astool then we have
[08:30.800 --> 08:35.840]  Dr. Steve Pachennick joining us for about 45 minutes in the second hour who he
[08:35.840 --> 08:39.920]  himself was involved overthrowing governments running black ops dirty
[08:39.920 --> 08:44.480]  tricks things like that I haven't yet even asked him his view on this you know
[08:44.480 --> 08:49.520]  he says the bin Laden killing was fake and 9-11's an inside job but I want to
[08:49.520 --> 08:53.560]  get his take on what's happening in Europe and we will find out together
[08:53.560 --> 08:57.880]  his view on this and then of course in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast
[08:57.880 --> 09:03.200]  today doctor of history Webster Tarpley who is saying that clearly this is a
[09:03.200 --> 09:09.400]  false flag event we'll look at how they find mentally ill patsies and basically
[09:09.400 --> 09:15.400]  deploy them help them protect them other shooters reportedly involved and then
[09:15.400 --> 09:19.360]  basically put the mental patient on trial and just like the guy that shot
[09:19.360 --> 09:25.320]  Reagan you know moving towards release from prison the guy that shot John
[09:25.320 --> 09:30.120]  Lennon moving towards release and for years allowed we can release if you
[09:30.120 --> 09:33.840]  talk about the guy that shot Reagan meeting with the bushes the night before
[09:33.840 --> 09:37.600]  for dinner I mean and then the government connections that were there
[09:37.600 --> 09:43.360]  this MK ultra mind control issue is very real and if you go to the front page of
[09:43.360 --> 09:48.960]  info wars comm will pull that up for prison planet TV viewers but for radio
[09:48.960 --> 09:56.560]  listeners if you simply go to info wars comm you can see Bravik the reported
[09:56.560 --> 10:03.360]  shooter with the classic completely insane smile of real satisfaction and
[10:03.360 --> 10:08.040]  getting attention very very proud of what he supposedly done he was not allowed
[10:08.040 --> 10:14.000]  to give a speech today at his arraignment but they read a statement
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.640]  saying he did this because of cultural Marxism now that's a term I hear Michael
[10:18.640 --> 10:28.000]  Savage use that is a term that I hear at nauseam being used of course by other
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.240]  big radio talk show host and conservatives the manifesto we put out
[10:33.240 --> 10:45.760]  worships neocondom it promotes homosexuality on his Facebook he said
[10:45.760 --> 10:51.240]  that he was reportedly liberal on some issues conservative on others that's
[10:51.240 --> 10:59.000]  all been removed off of his Facebook and in its stead it's been added that he's
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.880]  a Christian conservative and this was done after he was arrested so it needs to
[11:02.880 --> 11:07.280]  be a major investigation they're looking for the other two cells this is all
[11:07.280 --> 11:13.160]  right out of central casting that he said in his little statement today the
[11:13.160 --> 11:18.800]  other two cells that he has in Europe and he alluded in his supposed manifesto
[11:18.800 --> 11:27.200]  1500 pages most of it plagiarized on record from the unabomber and others he
[11:27.200 --> 11:35.160]  said that that he's working with people in England and so now if you don't want
[11:35.160 --> 11:40.320]  England to be absorbed into the EU if you don't want the European Union to take
[11:40.320 --> 11:44.400]  over your country if you don't want banker bailouts if your pro-gun as he
[11:44.400 --> 11:49.640]  reportedly was well you're a murderer of children and we have the financial
[11:49.640 --> 11:54.400]  times of London and others saying this killer this reported killer because he's
[11:54.400 --> 11:58.400]  not allowed to really speak for himself it's being done by the courts so who
[11:58.400 --> 12:02.160]  knows what's really true the government's have such a history of lying but
[12:02.160 --> 12:07.680]  now they're saying he's confessing to it and they're saying that he personifies
[12:07.680 --> 12:15.760]  he personifies conservatism worldwide killer personifies the rise of the new
[12:15.760 --> 12:20.640]  right and remember earlier in the year we had that MSNBC special they've aired
[12:20.640 --> 12:24.800]  over and over again Chris Matthews the rise of the new rights special will
[12:24.800 --> 12:29.160]  scare the heck out of liberals that's the Huffington Post and in it they edit
[12:29.160 --> 12:33.600]  what Ron Paul and I say to imply that we're calling for a violent revolution
[12:33.600 --> 12:37.320]  and say that we're going to cause violence and that we're dangerous that's
[12:37.320 --> 12:42.800]  what you come away from the hour special with is that Ron Paul is this deadly
[12:42.800 --> 12:47.240]  dangerous devil and that Alex Jones is even more wicked and horrible and then
[12:47.240 --> 12:51.480]  we're going to cause violence and that's their complete angle Reuters is
[12:51.480 --> 12:56.240]  reporting as well as raw story Ron Paul within a hailing distance of Obama in a
[12:56.240 --> 13:01.520]  new national poll scientifically conducted Ron Paul's only four points
[13:01.520 --> 13:06.720]  behind Obama nationally at 37% at the president's 41 doing better than the
[13:06.720 --> 13:11.240]  majority of other Republican contenders Ron Paul also over the weekend in a
[13:11.240 --> 13:18.280]  scientific poll was it Gallup beat Obama massively by close to 10 points in a
[13:18.280 --> 13:22.960]  New Hampshire poll he's also beating Obama in Iowa polls he is number one
[13:22.960 --> 13:27.680]  number two or number three depending on which of the weekly national polls come
[13:27.680 --> 13:31.800]  out and that's why if you watch Fox News they have him on as a guest
[13:31.800 --> 13:35.880]  occasionally but other than that when they're doing nightly news coverage or
[13:35.880 --> 13:41.800]  morning news coverage they mention all the other candidates Mitt Romney Al Gore's
[13:41.800 --> 13:50.080]  former employee you know that is Rick Perry all these other people but they
[13:50.080 --> 13:55.800]  do not mention Ron Paul and when I hear the news Fox News on the radio they
[13:55.800 --> 14:02.040]  don't mention Ron Paul ever in the polls even when he wins the straw polls or
[14:02.040 --> 14:07.240]  when he wins scientific polls and even the talk radio news that Genesis
[14:07.240 --> 14:11.280]  carries because there's only a few choices out there when I listen to it
[14:11.280 --> 14:15.640]  it they never mentioned Ron Paul even when he wins straw polls when when he
[14:15.640 --> 14:22.120]  won the coveted CPAC straw poll two years in a row this year earlier in the
[14:22.120 --> 14:25.480]  year I was listening and they they reported on second and third place it
[14:25.480 --> 14:31.400]  even saying about Ron Paul I mean this is this is this is dastardly I mean he
[14:31.400 --> 14:36.000]  is the real front runner and if they weren't propping up Mitt Romney he would
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.160]  be the clear front runner but I mean they're their neck and neck their nose
[14:40.160 --> 14:44.640]  and nose it's it's a horse race right now where Ron Paul and Mitt Romney are
[14:44.640 --> 14:49.720]  right up there and of course pointy boots will be coming in from behind the
[14:49.720 --> 14:56.760]  establishments do sacks or ringer to pose as Ron Paul Rick Perry and so look
[14:56.760 --> 15:03.680]  for look for him to come swooping in very soon but Ron Paul is is is a real
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.840]  contender and a lot of dirty tricks going on I want to open the phones up
[15:08.840 --> 15:13.920]  later in the hour after our first guest pops in with a quick perspective on
[15:13.920 --> 15:20.960]  what a Norwegian survivor is thinking and what other people are saying let me
[15:20.960 --> 15:24.000]  give you the toll-free number to join us on any of the issues we've raised but I
[15:24.000 --> 15:30.960]  would obviously like to hear from you on what you think about the Anders Bravick
[15:30.960 --> 15:35.600]  situation obviously we'll also be getting into financial news today the
[15:35.600 --> 15:40.600]  dollar has stumbled and tumbled today because of the Federal Reserve signaling
[15:40.600 --> 15:44.320]  they will continue to devalue the dollar when you hear that there's a strong
[15:44.320 --> 15:48.400]  dollar policy really what that means is they want to make sure all other
[15:48.400 --> 15:52.560]  currencies drop with it and that's the G20 policy for at least three years
[15:52.560 --> 16:01.280]  publicly is coordinated devaluation of the euro of the dollar of the yen of the
[16:01.280 --> 16:06.720]  yawn the West is always telling China raise the price of your currency but
[16:06.720 --> 16:10.320]  behind the scenes they want them to keep it the same or lower it so that's
[16:10.320 --> 16:16.200]  continuing gold is an all-time record explosive high when I checked 20 minutes
[16:16.200 --> 16:24.640]  ago it was at 1600 and 2249 and I'm told it's still rising in the middle of the
[16:24.640 --> 16:32.480]  summer normally the doldrums for the time when gold goes down in price so we'll
[16:32.480 --> 16:38.200]  also be going over all of that but what is the motive if this is a staged event
[16:38.200 --> 16:41.360]  in Norway and again when you have governments that have been caught doing
[16:41.360 --> 16:44.520]  things like this over and over again and you have Pentagon manuals on how to
[16:44.520 --> 16:50.480]  train terrorists that you then set up and burn as patsies you have to
[16:50.480 --> 16:55.960]  immediately look at who stands to gain from this Norway not going along and
[16:55.960 --> 16:58.800]  contributing money to the bank or bailout even though they're outside of the
[16:58.800 --> 17:03.920]  euro Norway one of the least restrictive gun control states very
[17:03.920 --> 17:11.840]  restrictive and restrictive compared to the United States now calls to restrict
[17:11.840 --> 17:19.520]  gun ownership there even more calls to have the EU and US anti-terror forces
[17:19.520 --> 17:25.120]  come in and basically take over the internal security apparatus of Norway
[17:25.120 --> 17:29.040]  killing their sovereignty further just like they're trying to do in Switzerland
[17:29.040 --> 17:33.200]  only a few sovereign countries left Norway is one of them Switzerland is one
[17:33.200 --> 17:39.080]  of them and of course they had the prime minister of Norway at Bilderberg this
[17:39.080 --> 17:46.720]  year very important point to note you had it's now emerge emerged yesterday in
[17:46.720 --> 17:53.280]  the last year CIA secretly infiltrating along with NATO the police
[17:53.280 --> 17:59.240]  departments and the national police department in Norway and quote recruiting
[17:59.240 --> 18:05.320]  senior police and retired police to fight terror secretly because the West was
[18:05.320 --> 18:10.800]  so worried about terror attacks in Norway yes the Muslims are going to attack
[18:10.800 --> 18:14.480]  Norway because Norway is for recognizing the Palestinians this is
[18:14.480 --> 18:18.440]  asinine so they didn't go with that because no one would buy it instead they
[18:18.440 --> 18:22.000]  went with the right wing card a guy who's a high-level mason admitted a
[18:22.000 --> 18:26.800]  member of the current real knights Templars who wears Illuminati symbols
[18:26.800 --> 18:33.280]  all over his little uniforms with glamour shots and a 1500 page treatise and a
[18:33.280 --> 18:39.000]  professional video and the police knew who he was when they arrived on the

[18:43.680 --> 18:48.760]  Bravik Anders Bravik and he said yes and walked over to them and now seems
[18:48.760 --> 18:52.840]  quite pleased and their own government is reporting he will serve no more than

[24:06.160 --> 24:13.840]  okay so the biggest piece of evidence that this is staged is that in Europe in
[24:13.840 --> 24:18.440]  the United States in Canada in Australia in New Zealand globalist controlled
[24:18.440 --> 24:22.800]  countries are globalist command-based countries they control almost the entire
[24:22.800 --> 24:28.920]  planet but the nations I just mentioned are the original wealthy powerful
[24:28.920 --> 24:34.800]  engines that were taken over by them and now used to dominate the world in all
[24:34.800 --> 24:40.400]  those countries the controllers have been demonizing Christian right wingers
[24:40.400 --> 24:44.560]  who don't want open borders who don't want banker bailouts who don't want to
[24:44.560 --> 24:50.080]  give up their cultures and they've been saying they're going to strike they're
[24:50.080 --> 24:54.680]  going to attack it's going to happen so we saw the prescripting running up to
[24:54.680 --> 24:59.680]  this and a huge rollout last week ahead of this in Europe and the United States
[24:59.680 --> 25:05.400]  that right wing blonde-haired blue-eyed Al Qaeda right wing Al Qaeda is going to
[25:05.400 --> 25:10.240]  strike forget the Arabs now the West has taken all those countries over except
[25:10.240 --> 25:15.280]  for Iran they're overthrowing all the old allies Mubarak and others they've got
[25:15.280 --> 25:20.720]  the Al Qaeda forces attacking in Libya you're not supposed to talk about about
[25:20.720 --> 25:24.360]  Al Qaeda now folks are tired of hearing about Al Qaeda they're not scared of it
[25:24.360 --> 25:28.320]  anymore so enters the blonde-haired blue-eyed Al Qaeda and I said Thursday I
[25:28.320 --> 25:32.280]  played this clip on the Sunday show last night I said they're going to launch the
[25:32.280 --> 25:36.800]  blonde-haired blue-eyed Al Qaeda very soon I'm telling you it's imminent the
[25:36.800 --> 25:41.800]  next day it happened less than 24 hours later so I could see the preconditioning
[25:41.800 --> 25:46.120]  that's why I was running around like a chicken with my head cut off and now
[25:46.120 --> 25:50.000]  you've got all these White House memos saying we need a new Oklahoma City or
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.880]  9-11 these are public even Glenn Beck talked about this earlier in the year
[25:53.880 --> 25:59.120]  I've played the clip and in the memos they say will blame Glenn Beck and Alex
[25:59.120 --> 26:04.400]  Jones media matters all the rest of them are saying oh yeah there's gonna be a
[26:04.400 --> 26:09.040]  new Oklahoma City and when it happens it's Glenn Beck and Alex Jones's fault
[26:09.040 --> 26:14.240]  and then Michael Sabbage is added on like a little side or derv sometimes but
[26:14.240 --> 26:18.200]  not always but it's always Glenn Beck Alex Jones in the MSNBC special it's
[26:18.200 --> 26:22.880]  Ron Paul Alex Jones you know rise of the new right we're going to cause the
[26:22.880 --> 26:27.720]  terror attack that's how the show ends we're violent we want violence they
[26:27.720 --> 26:33.120]  edit this clip out of Ron Paul talking about the founding fathers fighting
[26:33.120 --> 26:36.440]  tyranny in a clip of myself saying the second amendment is to defend us from
[26:36.440 --> 26:41.480]  tyranny and they say see they want to kill liberals and that's always their
[26:41.480 --> 26:45.440]  talking point and then separately you have White House advisors like Shapiro
[26:45.440 --> 26:50.360]  and others saying in the Financial Times of London in fact well you guys
[26:50.360 --> 26:53.280]  search that so we can show it to prison planet dot TV viewers are gonna have the
[26:53.280 --> 26:58.680]  actual headline it's something like just just search the term why Robert
[26:58.680 --> 27:03.160]  Shapiro tells Obama he needs a new Oklahoma City or 9-11 that'll pull up
[27:03.160 --> 27:06.360]  our article and they'll have a link to the Financial Times of London story I
[27:06.360 --> 27:10.560]  think it's from January I want to show people that and he says president you
[27:10.560 --> 27:14.400]  need the terror attacks it's the only thing that will save our globalist
[27:14.400 --> 27:18.320]  agenda now in the same Financial Times of London which is the most elite
[27:18.320 --> 27:21.480]  publication in the world this is where the globalists communicate with each
[27:21.480 --> 27:29.160]  other with very veiled in you window I mean it's it's it's it's it's it's
[27:29.160 --> 27:35.840]  thinly thinly thinly thinly veiled I mean you have Gary Hart writing articles
[27:35.840 --> 27:39.360]  from the composer he says we do stage terror attacks Iran you better do what
[27:39.360 --> 27:42.800]  we say or we'll stage one on you he didn't even veil that and we've
[27:42.800 --> 27:45.360]  interviewed him and asked him what he thought about he said yeah no our
[27:45.360 --> 27:49.000]  government stages attacks and I told Iran that but that's a message for them
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.720]  not for the American public see globalists think region by region the
[27:53.720 --> 27:59.480]  big CFR terrorism preparation master on the Heart Rubin Commission Gary Hart
[27:59.480 --> 28:05.320]  writes a letter openly to Iran saying we'll stage terror attacks there it is
[28:05.320 --> 28:14.480]  it's Financial Times of London and that came out actually came out last year
[28:14.480 --> 28:19.720]  July 13th last year while time flies Obama facing growing credibility crisis
[28:19.720 --> 28:24.040]  Financial Times of London and you read into it he says barring a giant terror
[28:24.040 --> 28:29.920]  attack like Oklahoma City or 9-11 the president's agenda is dead now what did
[28:29.920 --> 28:35.160]  the same Financial Times of London say today killer personifies rise of new
[28:35.160 --> 28:40.720]  far right they're following a script what was the name of last year's MSNBC
[28:40.720 --> 28:44.600]  special that they've reared this year rise of the new right what do they say
[28:44.600 --> 28:48.120]  is going to happen we're going to kill people let's go to break with Michael
[28:48.120 --> 28:52.840]  Savage breaking down that Obama was going to stage a Reichstag event and
[28:52.840 --> 28:57.000]  believe me this Norway things a test it's coming here this is how they're
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.080]  going to shut the web off come after tea partyers and conservatives I told you
[29:01.080 --> 29:04.800]  it was coming they've been beta testing it now it's starting here's the clip
[29:04.800 --> 29:10.760]  now I'll make another prediction and I predict that very soon Obama will create
[29:10.760 --> 29:15.400]  a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag for a Reichstag fire I don't
[29:15.400 --> 29:18.920]  know what form it will take but I believe that once the minions are seen
[29:18.920 --> 29:23.680]  for what they are Raman Manuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in
[29:23.680 --> 29:27.680]  this country of some kind and they will recall the military dictatorship of
[29:27.680 --> 29:31.800]  Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil War when civil civilian suspects were
[29:31.800 --> 29:36.040]  arrested without warrant I will tell you as I sit here I fear that every night as
[29:36.040 --> 29:40.400]  I go to sleep I put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seized
[29:40.400 --> 29:44.920]  control of the most powerful economy and the most powerful military on our right

[33:25.800 --> 33:30.440]  finishing up what I was getting to in the last break Obama faces growing
[33:30.440 --> 33:35.640]  credibility crisis and this is a article out of the financial times of
[33:35.640 --> 33:39.920]  London and when you go down to the bottom of the article that says the
[33:39.920 --> 33:44.400]  bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President Obama's
[33:44.400 --> 33:49.120]  leadership says Rob Shapiro another former Clinton official there's like
[33:49.120 --> 33:51.880]  eight of them now that have said the same thing including people in the White
[33:51.880 --> 33:55.080]  House the bottom line here is that Americans don't believe in President
[33:55.080 --> 33:59.200]  Obama's leadership says Rob Shapiro another former Clinton official and a
[33:59.200 --> 34:04.200]  supporter of Mr. Obama he has to find some way between now and November of
[34:04.200 --> 34:08.880]  demonstrating that he is a leader who can command confidence and short of a new
[34:08.880 --> 34:14.640]  9-11 event or an Oklahoma City bombing I can't think of how he could do that
[34:14.640 --> 34:21.360]  okay now skip ahead to what's happening now and I've seen similar statements out
[34:21.360 --> 34:25.040]  of politicians in Europe people are like why would government stage terror why
[34:25.040 --> 34:29.400]  would Hitler fire bomb his own capital blame it on his enemies why would he
[34:29.400 --> 34:32.880]  attack his own military base start World War two and say that Poland did it I
[34:32.880 --> 34:37.640]  mean folks who send me emails and call and go I don't know why they'd want to
[34:37.640 --> 34:42.880]  do it well I don't know why the guy's saying he did it really the guy's
[34:42.880 --> 34:47.840]  obviously completely insane they find in profile an insane person they use the
[34:47.840 --> 34:51.920]  Masonic Lodge to program and he's part of the Knights Templar which still
[34:51.920 --> 34:57.040]  operates out of England connected all the right-wing groups it's the same
[34:57.040 --> 35:05.200]  story with the shooter of Reagan and of of course John Lennon I mean if you go
[35:05.200 --> 35:09.920]  study both those cases it is confirmed they both work for World Vision and
[35:09.920 --> 35:15.000]  we're involved in weird CIA training camps in Africa and Lebanon you cannot
[35:15.000 --> 35:20.000]  make this stuff up and the family the Lennon family was on record at the time
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.360]  saying that the shooter of John Lennon was telling police that he was in a
[35:23.360 --> 35:26.840]  room bright lights men ordering him to do it they said oh he's just mentally
[35:26.840 --> 35:30.920]  ill ignore that it turned out again he worked for World Vision they use these
[35:30.920 --> 35:34.120]  missionary facilities for the brainwashing in third-world countries
[35:34.120 --> 35:40.080]  it was the same thing the head of World Vision's son then goes and shoots
[35:40.080 --> 35:46.480]  Ronald Reagan and the night before his meeting with the Bush family that that's
[35:46.480 --> 35:52.960]  Denver Post that's LA Times that's Washington Times you cannot make this
[35:52.960 --> 35:57.480]  stuff up Reagan was like I'm the president Bush sit down shut up I'm
[35:57.480 --> 36:02.480]  running things and then he gets shot goes and has some medical procedures done
[36:02.480 --> 36:07.360]  and suddenly for the rest of Reagan's term they had to drug him with with
[36:07.360 --> 36:12.200]  speed to get him out of bed and give him cue cards to march him out Ronald
[36:12.200 --> 36:15.360]  Reagan was under mind control after that shooting after they got him in that
[36:15.360 --> 36:20.080]  military base for his treatment and again this is all declassified MK
[36:20.080 --> 36:27.280]  Ultra in MK Naomi by the 50s they could create a totally programmed mind
[36:27.280 --> 36:35.760]  control assassin it would take a year of LSD PCP other drugs pumped in sensory
[36:35.760 --> 36:41.200]  deprivation tanks headphones pumping programs in to where when someone is
[36:41.200 --> 36:47.360]  given the the code word order they have a absolute total obsessive compulsive
[36:47.360 --> 36:54.840]  need to kill their target and they slip into a hypnotized sub personality to do
[36:54.840 --> 36:58.760]  it that's just one system they got history channel shows about Dr. Ewing
[36:58.760 --> 37:03.040]  Cameron and Jolly and West and facilities in Maryland and Toronto where
[37:03.040 --> 37:09.640]  they did this a hundred percent by the 50s and 60s of course Jolly and West is
[37:09.640 --> 37:14.280]  in those shows he just died two years ago guess who was McVeigh's doctor from
[37:14.280 --> 37:21.400]  the time he was arrested in 95 until he was executed at Terre Hood Indiana guess
[37:21.400 --> 37:29.120]  go look up the news articles Dr. Jolly and West the number two head of all US
[37:29.120 --> 37:35.200]  government mind control programs was publicly McVeigh's doctor and I've
[37:35.200 --> 37:39.000]  talked to prisoners and others here on air who knew McVeigh and of course signed
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.240]  affidavits have been made by Nichols and others and FBI documents have been
[37:42.240 --> 37:47.160]  leaked and it's been confirmed what they've said that McVeigh's family was
[37:47.160 --> 37:50.960]  threatened with murder if he didn't go along with it he was US special forces
[37:50.960 --> 37:56.880]  set up sheep dipped he was videotaped at a US military base in demolition section
[37:56.880 --> 38:02.080]  before he was released I'm going to our guests this is just so important yeah
[38:02.080 --> 38:04.920]  David Hammer was the president we had on one of the prisoners we had on about it
[38:04.920 --> 38:09.200]  that McVeigh when he wasn't drugged up and when West wasn't there because
[38:09.200 --> 38:12.640]  Jolly and West wasn't there every week that McVeigh would say yes they set me
[38:12.640 --> 38:16.040]  up but doesn't matter they're going to kill me and he also told newspapers that
[38:16.040 --> 38:20.840]  a few times well I tell you more but I don't want my family to get hurt and it
[38:20.840 --> 38:24.400]  goes on and on and on so they can threaten to kill your family or they
[38:24.400 --> 38:28.160]  can just grab you as a patch to keep you drugged up or they could find a mentally
[38:28.160 --> 38:31.800]  ill person who was handled and manipulated and protected to carry it out
[38:31.800 --> 38:37.760]  or they've got flat-out MK ultramind control ladies and gentlemen the North
[38:37.760 --> 38:42.200]  Koreans who were able to capture some of our airmen later released them and the
[38:42.200 --> 38:45.280]  guys had to end up being locked up for the rest their lives same thing with the
[38:45.280 --> 38:48.800]  North Vietnamese because they were programmed to come back here and kill
[38:48.800 --> 38:53.680]  people okay I mean look the chai comes know how to do it the North Koreans do
[38:53.680 --> 38:58.800]  this stuff is real you need to realize what's going on okay I'm gonna stop
[38:58.800 --> 39:03.840]  there you want to talk we may get to calls later in the hour certainly when
[39:03.840 --> 39:07.760]  dr. Pachennik song with us if you want to get lined up now to come on air the
[39:07.760 --> 39:15.280]  toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 but but
[39:15.280 --> 39:19.120]  finishing up police new government's name before the arrest they show up on
[39:19.120 --> 39:24.280]  the island calling out his name that's mainline British Channel 4 and also
[39:24.280 --> 39:32.360]  Norwegian TV Anders Brevik manufactured Patsy article by Paul Watson goes
[39:32.360 --> 39:35.920]  through the fact that they removed all the liberal stuff off his Facebook and
[39:35.920 --> 39:39.080]  posted that he was a Christian conservative they removed the Mason stuff
[39:39.080 --> 39:42.840]  it's confirmed he's high-level Mason which again I'm not saying all the
[39:42.840 --> 39:46.040]  masons are New World Order most of them are compartmentalized they use the
[39:46.040 --> 39:50.840]  secrecy of the lodge for intelligence operations and mind control that's come
[39:50.840 --> 39:56.360]  out of England in his mainstream news so we've got the frame up going on we've
[39:56.360 --> 40:02.480]  got him saying more cells are about to strike going now for a quick pop in I
[40:02.480 --> 40:10.080]  take you to Robert Jepstold Jepstold and he joins us from the Netherlands in
[40:10.080 --> 40:16.320]  Oslo he 29 year old barely survived the blast it blew him back but he wasn't
[40:16.320 --> 40:21.080]  injured he was marching right towards it 200 feet away and we've already covered
[40:21.080 --> 40:25.880]  most the waterfront on this though they're now calling to track conservatives
[40:25.880 --> 40:29.360]  track conservatives that give money to charities we can now be arrested just
[40:29.360 --> 40:32.720]  like the Muslims can for no reason the shutdown of conservative websites
[40:32.720 --> 40:37.160]  YouTube's added the link the week before to report things that quote promote
[40:37.160 --> 40:42.000]  terror MSNBC sing Ron Paul and I promote terror and are violent in their
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.120]  rise of the right special that's out in the news today killer personifies rise
[40:46.120 --> 40:50.040]  of the new right of course the same financial times talks about how helpful
[40:50.040 --> 40:54.840]  terror attacks would be for the government going now to Robert Robert
[40:54.840 --> 41:00.120]  good to have you with us sir break down the latest developments in your take on
[41:00.120 --> 41:08.280]  it thank you sir it's good to be back well first of all I'm not yet told the
[41:08.280 --> 41:13.360]  listeners how sorry I feel for the families and their friends of the
[41:13.360 --> 41:20.200]  victims my deepest condolences are extended to you who have lost loved
[41:20.200 --> 41:30.560]  ones today's news picture in Norway has been mostly that the pre-trial or the
[41:30.560 --> 41:38.440]  jail hearing where well I for one certainly hope that they would have an
[41:38.440 --> 41:47.520]  open hearing and I didn't well that's a big issue isn't it that they read what
[41:47.520 --> 41:54.400]  he supposedly said and used a term used by the neocons and mainline
[41:54.400 --> 42:00.760]  conservatives cultural Marxism and that is what it is that is going on so now
[42:00.760 --> 42:04.760]  if you talk about cultural Marxism why you must be a killer and the fact that
[42:04.760 --> 42:10.240]  they wouldn't let him speak himself does that not up the suspicion level here
[42:10.240 --> 42:21.760]  sure it's just getting stranger and I also saw a report from from a small town
[42:21.760 --> 42:27.240]  in France there to lose where his father lived and they were vague about
[42:27.240 --> 42:31.840]  connections that they didn't have any they didn't talk or see each other for
[42:31.840 --> 42:47.560]  several years I mean yeah let's talk about the Israel connection there was
[42:47.560 --> 42:53.160]  a Palestinian youth group the government of Norway was obviously calling
[42:53.160 --> 42:57.000]  for Palestine to be recognized they were about to pull their planes out of
[42:57.000 --> 43:00.800]  Libya reportedly there were all these Palestinian people at a rally at this
[43:00.800 --> 43:05.280]  island the day before he was trying to kill the former Prime Minister who's a
[43:05.280 --> 43:10.440]  big Palestinian supporter that's now in the news today this is the anniversary
[43:10.440 --> 43:14.120]  of the King David Hotel bombing that was admittedly a bombing carried out by
[43:14.120 --> 43:19.320]  Israel against the British in Palestine pre-Israel and it first tried to be
[43:19.320 --> 43:25.440]  blamed on the Arabs but then that didn't work so all of this going on and it's
[43:25.440 --> 43:28.600]  funny I didn't play the whole Michael Savage clip but Michael Savage points
[43:28.600 --> 43:32.760]  out in that clip and others that we just played you can just search Michael
[43:32.760 --> 43:37.960]  Savage Obama Reichstag he talks about why does he say Rama manual will be
[43:37.960 --> 43:42.720]  involved in stage terror Reichstag events of stage bombings or fires he says
[43:42.720 --> 43:46.640]  because he's the son of the head of airgun who staged terror attacks and
[43:46.640 --> 43:52.160]  her leftist leftist terrorist so I mean that's Michael Savage by the way is
[43:52.160 --> 43:58.560]  Jewish himself saying this what's your view on the situation since you bring up
[43:58.560 --> 44:07.280]  Israel well the I think Webster top it may be correct when he says there's a
[44:07.280 --> 44:14.400]  connection with the Palestine issue but you know the in the aftermath of this
[44:14.400 --> 44:22.000]  happening I guess people are just gathering around the workers party and
[44:22.000 --> 44:29.280]  the AUF the youths were you know training for becoming a participant in
[44:29.280 --> 44:35.440]  the workers party which is by far the biggest party and I guess they will only
[44:35.440 --> 44:41.720]  get more power and have more numbers to to vote the way the globalist want them
[44:41.720 --> 44:49.880]  to as a result of this so I guess the Palestine issue is a side issue it may
[44:49.880 --> 44:59.160]  be your trigger but you know not the whole should I now in a way though why
[44:59.160 --> 45:02.240]  would Israel and we're certainly looking at that we just went over the
[45:02.240 --> 45:07.480]  evidence so the it's good let me be clear there's evidence pointing towards
[45:07.480 --> 45:11.520]  this being a false flag provocateur event and we've gone over that
[45:11.520 --> 45:18.720]  constellation of evidence I right now cannot single out specifically what
[45:18.720 --> 45:23.600]  group would stand to gain other than just big government itself by invoking a
[45:23.600 --> 45:30.120]  clash between Islam and Christianity which this guy's manifesto is calling
[45:30.120 --> 45:35.520]  for that will undoubtedly trigger some real copycats to engage in their own
[45:35.520 --> 45:40.880]  attacks so the government won't have to even manufacture them in some cases this
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.800]  will also probably stimulate Muslims or it's an attempt to stimulate Muslims in
[45:45.800 --> 45:51.800]  Europe to strike back to invoke that clash of civilizations that the neocons
[45:51.800 --> 45:56.920]  of the council on farm relations talk about and then the social engineers the
[45:56.920 --> 46:00.320]  globalist can sit back and play the two groups off against each other while
[46:00.320 --> 46:06.760]  taking everyone's rights in the name of refereeing the clash of the crusade and
[46:06.760 --> 46:12.280]  the jihad that is going on so clearly that's the overall motive restrict guns
[46:12.280 --> 46:16.240]  in Norway restrict guns in other areas of Europe England the United States the
[46:16.240 --> 46:20.840]  calls are being made track conservatives rebrand mainline political
[46:20.840 --> 46:27.000]  nationalism is connected to terrorism but specifically with Israel staging an
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.880]  attack against Norway because they're pro-Palestinian that would actually then
[46:31.880 --> 46:36.400]  when it comes out this guy was a big Israel supporter and is and and and very
[46:36.400 --> 46:43.880]  scared of Muslims that in a way would actually discredit and demonize the
[46:43.880 --> 46:49.400]  pro-Israel people show it's very sophisticated but it but Tarpley says
[46:49.400 --> 46:53.120]  that doesn't matter and I tend to agree with him at an operation gladio level
[46:53.120 --> 46:56.760]  it's a message to governments I mean the prime minister and the former prime
[46:56.760 --> 47:03.680]  minister almost got killed at the island this is a major message to them hey you
[47:03.680 --> 47:07.440]  better do what we're telling you or your dad but again who would want to send
[47:07.440 --> 47:17.280]  that message go ahead there's a lot of things I think from here domestically
[47:17.280 --> 47:26.120]  domestically talking again that point to Stoltenberg the prime minister now he
[47:26.120 --> 47:33.920]  says I guess he has some Jewish ancestors he's the name is Stoltenberg from
[47:33.920 --> 47:40.680]  from I guess a pre not predominant Jewish family from Poland a long time ago
[47:40.680 --> 47:50.560]  his sister also Stoltenberg works for the people's help
[47:50.560 --> 47:57.200]  as started by the Rockefeller Foundation they oh he knows he's at
[47:57.200 --> 48:01.640]  Bilderberg so you're saying the coalition parliament was about to be
[48:01.640 --> 48:05.320]  removed from power in the next election polls showed so you're saying it points
[48:05.320 --> 48:10.960]  towards he is a Bilderberg group member them staging this against themselves to
[48:10.960 --> 48:17.560]  discredit the rise of nationalists in Norway yeah I would guess I mean he
[48:17.560 --> 48:24.400]  works so closely with the Bill and Gates Bill and Melinda Gates fund you know
[48:24.400 --> 48:31.360]  taking trips pictures with them subsidizing vaccines in Africa I mean
[48:31.360 --> 48:35.960]  it all seems so closely integrated so you disagree with Tarbley then that this
[48:35.960 --> 48:42.120]  was aimed as a threat towards the government well maybe the government
[48:42.120 --> 48:48.840]  in general but not the the I didn't reach an establishment oh I mean also with
[48:48.840 --> 48:55.560]  the former World Health Organization general secretary I mean she
[48:55.560 --> 49:00.840]  just left the island it all you know it seems to exactly much of a setup
[49:00.840 --> 49:04.680]  except well there's no doubt that they're attacking and demonizing
[49:04.680 --> 49:08.640]  nationalist conservatives folks that don't want wide open borders welfare
[49:08.640 --> 49:12.960]  states I mean that's definitely going on they're definitely using it it's got
[49:12.960 --> 49:16.920]  all the signs of a staged event what do you make of his Facebook being altered
[49:16.920 --> 49:21.720]  and the masonic stuff being removed and the gay stuff being removed and being
[49:21.720 --> 49:25.640]  added Christian conservative when even his friends are saying he wasn't really
[49:25.640 --> 49:30.560]  a Christian conservative what do you make of the fact that there's not a bigger
[49:30.560 --> 49:35.800]  hubbub over the fact that his Facebook was altered to frame conservatives and
[49:35.800 --> 49:44.160]  Christians the first I heard of this was I am so much respect for mr. Paul
[49:44.160 --> 49:48.880]  Joseph Watson and his article and the first time I saw it was was in his
[49:48.880 --> 49:55.000]  article I thought I had just removed it but but they're throwing labels there
[49:55.000 --> 50:01.240]  just sending this information it's just a confusion about where he stands where
[50:01.240 --> 50:07.120]  it comes also so actually said they're building a character they're making this
[50:07.120 --> 50:16.400]  you know fictional demon it seems like obviously he's distorted but there's
[50:16.400 --> 50:24.360]  something more and they're making what that is well it's just like 9-11 the
[50:24.360 --> 50:28.560]  fact that you had not one but two passports going out of their clothes
[50:28.560 --> 50:32.240]  out of the fireballs out of the building down to the ground and then found
[50:32.240 --> 50:37.760]  undamaged later in the day and given to the FBI I mean if you'll buy that folks
[50:37.760 --> 50:42.600]  you'll buy that one-eyed one horn flying purple people eaters are real or
[50:42.600 --> 50:48.200]  that you know Kibler elves are real it is completely asinine and evidence of the
[50:48.200 --> 50:52.320]  frame-up is evidence that it's an inside job and the fact that his Facebook and a
[50:52.320 --> 50:56.000]  bunch of other stuff was doctored right after he was arrested that the cops knew
[50:56.000 --> 51:01.480]  his name before the arrest and yelled it out at him you add all this together my
[51:01.480 --> 51:07.600]  friend this is very very suspicious and the fact that they you know the the the
[51:07.600 --> 51:11.440]  the cherry on top the coup de grace coup de grace what do they call it in French
[51:11.440 --> 51:16.760]  you know the the last straw is that they won't let him be seen on camera and
[51:16.760 --> 51:20.680]  speak for himself and they read statements I was in that none you're
[51:20.680 --> 51:24.800]  Norwegian correct me if I'm wrong but you have incredible rights over there I
[51:24.800 --> 51:28.880]  truly a democratic society at many levels and that prisoners have
[51:28.880 --> 51:34.400]  incredible rights and that they never bar prisoners from speaking at their
[51:34.400 --> 51:39.640]  arraignment is that correct now it's not entirely correct because there's a
[51:39.640 --> 51:48.680]  paragraph that if the investigation would be compromised then they can isolate
[51:48.680 --> 51:56.000]  them or bar the press or people from coming into the jail hearing they can
[51:56.000 --> 52:04.080]  also I guess his eyes let it for four weeks without letters and visit and they
[52:04.080 --> 52:12.680]  cannot they can well you have as a sort of how to get rid of people I gather in
[52:12.680 --> 52:19.960]  America assassinations is the preferred way of getting rid of unwanted
[52:19.960 --> 52:25.080]  elements but in Norway we have and the author I talked about yesterday has
[52:25.080 --> 52:32.200]  written this extensively about this we have a very efficient system to to take
[52:32.200 --> 52:38.560]  them into mental hospitals and they disappear and I'm it won't be long I
[52:38.560 --> 52:42.640]  think you're saying it's more of the Soviet model and he'll probably now
[52:42.640 --> 52:47.200]  disappear often to the mental institution and that way we never find out who
[52:47.200 --> 52:50.440]  really did this well we're going to check back in with you in the days to come
[52:50.440 --> 52:55.720]  we're also going to open the phones up in the days to come for Norwegians in
[52:55.720 --> 52:59.320]  fact I should do that today after we go through these calls to be able to get on
[52:59.320 --> 53:04.640]  air with us and also give us their perspective and their view but not
[53:04.640 --> 53:09.600]  letting him speak keeping him sequestered very very suspicious and only adds to
[53:09.600 --> 53:13.560]  the quandary I want to thank you Robert for joining us and we'll talk to you
[53:13.560 --> 53:20.200]  again soon thank you sir thank you now look I know we've got Tommy Dean Brenda
[53:20.200 --> 53:24.400]  Tanner Aaron and others and I want to take a bunch of calls today also got
[53:24.400 --> 53:27.680]  Dr. Steve Pachennick coming up and you know he'll want to roll with info but
[53:27.680 --> 53:30.720]  I'm going to be jamming your calls in quickly as soon as he gets on with us
[53:30.720 --> 53:34.080]  I'm going to get his take on this and then take your calls and get his
[53:34.080 --> 53:37.560]  comments and then we got dr. Tarpley joining us last 30 minutes today
[53:37.560 --> 53:42.360]  Tarpley brings up one of the most important issues that forgotten about
[53:42.360 --> 53:46.640]  over a year ago and then more came out over the weekend that the CIA was
[53:46.640 --> 53:51.680]  infiltrating Norwegian police and that NATO was doing it and then now we learn
[53:51.680 --> 53:55.760]  recruiting retired police to quote counter the terror because the government
[53:55.760 --> 54:01.200]  wouldn't and then you're the counter terrorism forces in Spain in England the
[54:01.200 --> 54:05.600]  Russians the Nazis it's always the anti-terror forces that are the masters
[54:05.600 --> 54:10.360]  of staging false flags for political gain so you've got a major attack on
[54:10.360 --> 54:15.400]  Norwegian sovereignty and that is at the heart of this Switzerland and Norway
[54:15.400 --> 54:20.640]  both have had now suspicious shootings at government buildings had a lot of one
[54:20.640 --> 54:24.120]  of their state governments killed a few years ago in Switzerland right as a vote
[54:24.120 --> 54:28.640]  was coming up to restrict guns but the Swiss voted it down the Swiss and the
[54:28.640 --> 54:32.640]  Norwegians are under globalist attack now I'm not saying the Norwegians are
[54:32.640 --> 54:37.200]  are not New World Order central they are but they're one of those zones that is
[54:37.200 --> 54:41.080]  completely under its control though their leadership is pro-New World Order the
[54:41.080 --> 54:45.760]  globalists like to have their own select backwaters to operate out of I've got
[54:45.760 --> 54:51.640]  Ron Paul news economic news police state news human animal hybrid news it that's
[54:51.640 --> 54:58.920]  in BBC AP Australian news yes they got part human part animal clones folks we're
[54:58.920 --> 55:01.920]  not in Kansas anymore every time I talk about the stuff I get emails saying I'm
[55:01.920 --> 55:07.480]  lying I read about human animal clones in the BBC 15 years ago there are giant
[55:07.480 --> 55:11.400]  laboratories everywhere doing whatever they want the dehumanization is off the
[55:11.400 --> 55:16.560]  charts you're eating GMO food designed to sterilize you now I want to briefly get
[55:16.560 --> 55:20.280]  into financial news before we get into it more after Dr. Pachennick leaves us
[55:20.280 --> 55:27.120]  gold hits new high as debt talks stall we've got the dollar plunging right now
[55:27.120 --> 55:31.240]  and why because they have announced they're going ahead with QE3 that means
[55:31.240 --> 55:37.280]  further global currency devaluations so oil food all commodities pork bellies
[55:37.280 --> 55:43.080]  corn grain gold silver it's all going to go up people on fixed I got articles
[55:43.080 --> 55:47.760]  where they're ordering major police departments around the country and fire
[55:47.760 --> 55:51.760]  departments to give half their pensions to the government now it's already
[55:51.760 --> 55:55.200]  started in Europe the feds changed the law is five years ago to do this I've
[55:55.200 --> 55:59.160]  been how many times you heard me say this they're now saying give us half your
[55:59.160 --> 56:02.840]  pension that's an AP today this is being announced all over the country give us
[56:02.840 --> 56:06.000]  half your pension or you'll get nothing and then you're going to give them half
[56:06.000 --> 56:09.480]  and then five years later they'll take the other half and you'll end up being
[56:09.480 --> 56:13.120]  played like a sucker it's like give me half your cake or I'll throw it off the
[56:13.120 --> 56:15.880]  table you have map the cake give me the other half or I'll throw it off the
[56:15.880 --> 56:19.360]  table and then when it gets down to the last crumb they throw it off the table
[56:19.360 --> 56:24.680]  and laugh at you how do you protect yourself gold and silver who's got the
[56:24.680 --> 56:28.520]  best deals Ted Anderson he has the best deals he bought it when it was low a
[56:28.520 --> 56:31.280]  few months ago he's almost out of the gold and silver he bought when it was
[56:31.280 --> 56:36.840]  lower and it's gonna go up Ted Anderson quickly give folks today's gold and

[56:43.640 --> 56:49.520]  insane if they stay in these pension funds in my opinion I have zero in the

[56:55.560 --> 57:00.400]  tiny bit of real estate so I can cash it in and keep running the operation if I

[57:18.000 --> 57:21.960]  goodness sakes the way that Bloomberg is reporting it no matter what happens
[57:21.960 --> 57:25.440]  whether if they've reached this debt limit and they increase it or they are
[57:25.440 --> 57:31.320]  they default on it gold and silver is going to rise it's a win-win either way
[57:31.320 --> 57:37.280]  right now British sovereigns are currently at 444 Franks are at $354

[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.760]  away from the dollar the dollar turns 150 years old you know we didn't have
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:50.040]  dollar with golden silver before that showdown market spooked dollar stumbles
[01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:55.640]  gold at record highs I want to go to Ted Anderson but I've got a report here at
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:02.640]  info wars dot com by the Alexander Higgins blog and he's got a link to the
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:06.920]  CNN report and sure enough and I'm seeing more and more calls for this in
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:13.160]  Ireland in Spain Portugal Italy Greece city to firefighters and police
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:20.000]  retirees give up 50% of your pension or risk losing it all and this is in a
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  central Falls Rhode Island but I'm seeing reports of this all over the
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.920]  country including Texas and Michigan California and this is what they've done
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:31.600]  in other countries so they infect your pension funds by investing them in
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.240]  derivatives and then they say let us cut your pension fund you'll never get
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:40.680]  anything this is how the trap is set I've told folks they should look at silver
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:44.600]  and gold Ted we're going into hyperinflation people people think
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.120]  silver and gold's high now folks thought silver was high at ten bucks an ounce
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:53.000]  and gold at 500 and they said oh it's gonna it's gonna plunge not as long as
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.720]  they're devaluing Ted yeah you're right about that I mean people that are
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.840]  sitting here with their money in the pensions and so on and so forth I mean
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.840]  they're gonna be the ones that are gonna be hurt in the most anybody with a
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.760]  fixed income because what they're gonna see is a lot of inflation they're gonna
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:10.720]  see the markets tipsy turvy it's gonna be very difficult for anybody that's
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.720]  worked all their lives figuring that they can live off of their savings unless
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.360]  if they have gold and silver because like the way that Matthew Zimmerman said
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.560]  it is a strategist with Kingsview Financial in Chicago and this is
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:29.160]  Bloomberg's report it says gold is a can't lose situation with the debt
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.240]  negotiations because regardless of the outcome the dollar is going to suffer
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:38.480]  because the bottom line is if Congress decides to raise the debt limit they're
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.200]  gonna print a whole bunch of more money if they don't raise the debt limit we're
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:45.720]  gonna lose our credit rating internationally doesn't matter either
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.800]  way people that have their money in paper investments are gonna get destroyed
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.960]  and it's just absolutely crazy that this is how things are turning up because
[01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:59.640]  we stuck with constitutional money there's no way that this could have ever
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.840]  happened but you can do it by yourself you can go to gold and silver that's
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:09.000]  why I think this silver offer with the videos is so important because people
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.920]  are gonna actually be able to see how money comes into existence that
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:18.280]  American dream video puts it into an entertaining and very simple way of
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.480]  seeing it you can just see who's behind you're getting silver dollars at a price
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.840]  you can't find them anywhere else and you're getting a free book and great
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.640]  film about the banksters on top of it that deals incredible but folks will be
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:34.000]  getting in to the other radio specials gold and silver coins when you call ask
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:43.360]  for a list of radio specials 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 look at the track
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.800]  record we told you by silver when it was $5 an ounce gold when it was 300 now
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:55.160]  look at it folks now is the time to get involved 800 686 2237 don't get caught
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:05:00.640]  with your pants down thank you Ted Anderson Steve Pachena coming up this
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.160]  is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:08.120]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:12.360]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:16.640]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:21.000]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.080]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:29.640]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.760]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:41.560]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:44.280]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:50.280]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:09.120]  he's the T-Rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:24.200]  okay folks Dr. Webster Tarpley says this is a false flag staged event with a
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.520]  mentally ill pat scene we've got him joining us the last 30 minutes today I
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:31.680]  know we've got callers holding we're going to get to you after Dr. Steve
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:35.920]  Pachennick as his say when I told my producer to set up Dr. Pachennick
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:40.520]  yesterday I didn't know what his view would be on this and I just talked to
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:45.880]  him during the break and his view out of the gates differs from my preliminary
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:52.160]  view but I'm gonna listen and I respect what he has to say now of course if you
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:55.840]  go over Dr. Steve Pachennick's bio he's probably been on the show 10-12 times
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:02.960]  over the years he is the co-author of Tom Clancy's books he's the case that
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:07.880]  he's the person that the Jack Ryan characters based on he's the advisor
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:14.960]  technically the books are accurate and of course he worked in psychiatry at
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:20.280]  Harvard I mean if you go over his whole bio it's very lengthy he wrote the book
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:27.760]  on psychological warfare for the State Department used by the CIA and the
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.560]  question I've raised to him before that he's never really gotten into when I
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:36.840]  bring it up is the death of the Italian president which the London Telegraph says
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:41.400]  reportedly was manipulated by Dr. Pachennick he manipulated the
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:44.720]  Communist into killing him perhaps today we'll get him to talk about that if I
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:48.720]  mean this is somebody whose bio would take hours to go over Steve Pachennick
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:54.960]  dot com and he joins us and and talking to the doctor in the break he said no
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:00.800]  this is the real deal this is bonafide terror he's creating a narrative to
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:05.160]  launch a whole movement but isn't and that's what I've been saying but from
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:09.360]  another perspective the globalist want a class of civilization the neocons talked
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:14.160]  about that playing Christendom off against Islam while then the globalist
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:18.760]  basically play the part of the arbiter or the referee and and and have a police
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:23.920]  state crackdown on the entire general public in the name of creating safety
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:29.280]  this way no one can be trusted not whites not Arabs not Muslims not Christians
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:35.120]  nobody can be trusted but Big Brother State and the telescreens of course
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.160]  now going in 9,000 locations big TV screen saying spy on your neighbor I
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:44.360]  saw the preparation to this saying white al-qaeda is about to head give up your
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:47.960]  rights when white al-qaeda the right-wingers are about to hit the
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:53.960]  rise of the right on MSNBC saying Ron Paul and I want violence we don't want
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:58.400]  open borders we don't want globalism we don't want a banker takeover we're the
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:04.040]  terrorist so I've seen this narrative being prepared people's minds being
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.760]  prepared so I called the day before I said white al-qaeda is about to strike I
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:12.640]  said it'll be right-wing they'll say it's in Europe and the United States
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:15.720]  they'll claim it's militias that are against open borders and against the
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:20.360]  banker takeover well wallah this guy comes out and says it his Facebook has
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:24.400]  been changed from saying he's a night's Templar Mason does that he's a Christian
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:28.960]  conservative this was done after he was captured the police knew his name when
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:34.840]  they raided the facility but if you're gonna stage terror I normally terror a
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:38.520]  stage that actually backfires on those that carry it out that's why you can
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:42.960]  see that it staged in this case he is trying to launch a giant movement they
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.720]  wouldn't let him be seen by reporters when he confessed today he may be whisk
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:51.920]  away into their famous mental institution Soviet style but enough for me
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.040]  I've set the table with that we've talked about it but I really respect
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:59.480]  dr. Pachennick's view you know he said the bin Laden thing is totally fake the
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:04.040]  killing and that the situation room video and photos were fake came out days
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:08.360]  later they were the throwing him in the ocean totally fake the whole story not
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:12.560]  true now we've never seen the wives turns out Pakistan doesn't have them so
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:17.440]  he's right there he says 9-11 inside job completely how it was carried out you
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.200]  know where it was planned all of that information so I really respecting but
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:25.840]  why is he saying this is real dr. Pachennick you've got the floor but then
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:31.520]  I want to ask you why then did I see this build up to white al-Qaeda or white
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:36.160]  right-wing extremism were the intelligence agencies aware of this and
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:40.440]  did they allow it happen did they allow it to happen or did they have their
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:50.640]  Google actuaries tracking chatter how was this known yeah doc your phone is
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:56.880]  your phone is breaking up a little bit dr. Pachennick specifically what is
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:01.840]  going on with this event this is this is an event that I wrote about and was
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:06.200]  worried about 20 years ago and in a novel that I wrote under the name of
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:10.320]  Alexander courts here you are people active measures and it started in
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:15.240]  Sweden and in Norway this is unlike any other event we've ever seen this is not
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:21.680]  just some right-wing screwballs first of all this man is exceedingly saying
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:26.120]  whatever else anybody's gonna tell you he is very sane he's extremely
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:32.040]  calculated he's very well read this is not a crazy man who suddenly decided to
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:35.960]  do something he made it very clear what his motives were and the reason he made
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:40.840]  it very clear this is a pristine case of terrorism that I've been waiting for and
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:46.360]  I've seen before but this is not a false flag this is not a stand-down this is
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:51.440]  not somewhere where suddenly any administration knew about an intending
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:56.360]  with or wish for an intending right-wing movement and I'll tell you why number
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:02.040]  one his understanding of terror was absolutely perfect he understood that
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:06.480]  terror is not the destruction of a building it's not the destruction of
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:13.080]  any institution but it is literally the creation of the emotion of terror and he
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:17.480]  did it brilliantly I don't think he did it alone I think he had helped not a
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:21.760]  particular scene but he did have help from other countries and I will talk
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:27.400]  about it he blew up a building which created enough terror because he did it
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:32.800]  at the right time when everybody was gone and he did it under the building
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.880]  where the Prime Minister was which means he was targeting the fact that they were
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.920]  extremely vulnerable that the Prime Minister in the Labor Party is vulnerable
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:47.040]  he could get them anytime he wanted and he took one hour to an hour and a half
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:52.520]  and went to an island and killed 80 white Aryan children who were the
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:58.800]  successor to political throne now let me explain this this sounds Machiavelli
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:05.520]  what it is in the words of terrorism no one no one has told this type of
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:11.280]  exercise of distraction distortion and at the same time kill the very people you
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:16.680]  would not expect him to kill because if this were a plane or a false flag unlike
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:22.080]  the other situations he would turn it around and did exactly what in terrorism
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:27.680]  one would do which is to kill the very people he wanted to have associate with
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:31.920]  him let me stop you dog because let me stop you Alex listen to me the analog
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:37.800]  to this is not me today it is not al-qaeda you have to go back to 1922 and
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:43.280]  1923 he's literally following the steps of the very people he's accusing and
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:49.720]  that is Hitler Hitler in 1922 23 where he was arrested was arrested to make sure
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:54.920]  that he was not executed he did not want to be executed there hold much listen
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:16:00.080]  and then he what he did in that later on in the 1930s he took all of the people
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:06.240]  around him or Aryans and homosexuals and executed 300 of them in order to make a
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:12.240]  political deal this man has understood the study terrorism has understood the
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:17.360]  integration of the icons of terrorism the icons of Christianity some of which
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:22.880]  are wrong he understood Marxism he understood exactly what multiculturalism
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:28.520]  he understood that France refused to have multiculturalism and he uses a target
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:33.360]  audience the problem of multiculturalism but he didn't go out and kill any
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:38.800]  Muslims a multicultural element he killed his own people to explain that he is
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:44.080]  able to take down any political system then he very calmly sat down explain
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:48.400]  his motivations so that would be no confusion as to the fact that he was
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:54.360]  nuts I wrote about this 20 years ago in a novel saying that the banality of evil
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:59.040]  it's not the anything that's egregious it is the banality of evil is the ability
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:04.880]  to affect this type of terror so that you can terrorize a system or country and
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:10.920]  eventually a world now what makes them very lethal is that he will polarize and
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:18.040]  have around him all the white discontent men and women who are now looking to the
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:22.760]  right in Europe in particular and in Norway in particular now what makes it
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:26.360]  very unusual is you have to understand what Norway is nobody's talked about
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:31.400]  Norway I've worked in Norway I know Norway Norway is a country that had a
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:35.760]  history of collaborating with the Nazis with Quisling remember the term
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:40.280]  Quisling Alex yes that explained to the audience he was the Prime Minister and
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:45.860]  Foreign Minister of Norway during World War two and affiliated himself with the
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:51.480]  Nazis so within Norway you had a system where you had an understrain of the
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:57.360]  notion of being a monolithic Aryan people who affiliated with the Nazis now
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:02.120]  in the older respect to the Norwegians they also in the few words where I was
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:07.560]  they fought the Nazis subsequently and held down 400,000 troops so what I'm
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:12.240]  saying to you is this is not only an individual this is a cultural confluence
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:18.120]  of Norwegian national character where it's only 4.5 million of the historical
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:22.360]  elements that they had in Norway not in Christianity Norway is not a very
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:27.000]  Christian country it's a Lutheran-Guster country which is subjugated to the
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.720]  state so his pronouncements of Lutheran Christianity is really the
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:36.560]  defecation of the Catholicism which is in France totally different it's an
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:41.280]  understanding of Christianity is mistaken because the Knights of Templar
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:45.440]  did not come from any Aryan country they came from the areas that I grew up in
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:49.480]  France and the south of France and Toulouse and they were basically way
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:55.080]  weird individuals who had no work and were then empowered by the Pope to go
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:00.080]  forth into Jerusalem and eventually became exceedingly corrupt now having
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:06.360]  said that my point is this is a perfect execution of a terrorist act without
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.440]  destroying a building that I mean he created a destruction of building but
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:14.880]  he created terror throughout the system in order to mobilize a political party
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:20.120]  now can the CFR and other governments have the repression subsequent to that
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:25.520]  yeah but do they intend to do that no and I'll tell you why no system including
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:30.480]  our own system is that smart or that clever or capable the stand-down in the
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:34.960]  false flag that occurred in 9-11 was done in the Bush Jr. administration with
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:41.560]  neocons and ones who understood in a in a backward almost a reverse way they were
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:46.320]  so clear and so awkward in their stand-in false flag that it was easy for me
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:50.480]  and others who do the intelligence community to say this is false flag all
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:54.280]  right it's not a predictable element all right we've got a break we're gonna come
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:57.640]  right back I've got my points to make and then your phone calls are coming up

[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:27.960]  known as fMRI functional magnetic resonance imaging and there is proof

[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:15.000]  well dr. Steve Pachennick is an expert in terrorism on terrorism that's why he's
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:20.600]  the advisor to some of the most best-selling authors out there like
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:24.680]  tom clancy and co-author of many of those books and major films
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:29.800]  but i look at this and i see the neocons saying we want to invoke a class of
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:34.040]  civilizations between christendom and the muslims
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:36.600]  and so the way this is launched undoubtedly they're going to be real
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:41.000]  copycats that take up this entire military manual on
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.160]  how to do it who to attack what their views are
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:50.280]  that it's meant to generate kind of like Carter setting up al-qaeda in 79
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:53.880]  sure the command systems run by the west but
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:58.440]  it's an idea that then gets picked up and actually organically carried out
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:03.000]  so that's how you have staged al-qaeda synthetic al-qaeda versus real al-qaeda
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.360]  and so i see this launching the clash of civilizations
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:09.640]  but then the governments that have been hyping that this is coming
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:14.120]  they can then come in and say now we've got to take everybody's rights no one
[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:17.160]  can be trusted because see the the right-wingers that don't
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:20.360]  like the banker bailouts that don't like open borders
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:24.520]  who don't like cultural Marxism they're bad guys i mean i see this
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:29.080]  really helping the corrupt ruling establishment dr pacinic i'm not saying
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:32.600]  i disagree with you and and and i do see the point that
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:36.920]  staged terror always hits a target that hurts civilians
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:40.280]  it's never really striking the ruling class i mean real terrorist
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:43.400]  would go after david Rockefeller they'd go after lord Rothschild they'd go
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:47.560]  after the queen of england they would go after uh you know real people at their
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:49.480]  houses i mean it's easy to kill people
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:53.240]  why do they usually hit some public place well that's to scare the public
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:56.360]  because the state or elements of it are attacking the people
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:59.960]  they want you to run into their arms so they attack you i mean i get what you're
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:03.320]  saying and that's why this whole case has given me a headache
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.920]  but we also have his facebook being altered from this nice temple literally
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:13.160]  alex yeah times when we don't agree but we do agree let's just i want to do a
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.760]  little footnote up in june you and i talked about the
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:21.160]  british collusion with the media and the press
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:24.920]  and the game and i told you they were corrupt the intelligence community was
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:28.760]  corrupt the press was corrupt six weeks later
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:32.040]  the whole murdoch issue comes out and you and i were right
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:35.800]  all right and the bbc who were sitting there you forgot to mention that so we
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:40.200]  were right now but you said all their major media is government intelligence
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:44.120]  and the police department was involved scotland yard was involved so you and i
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:47.880]  are correct we were often very aligned in what we say
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:51.240]  and there are really collusions and there are corruptions
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:56.520]  this is not the same case my friend and the reason i argue that is this man
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:01.080]  did target the prime individual he wanted and that was the prime minister
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:04.760]  but more sinisterly and this is where you have to understand
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:08.920]  and i'll go into the neocon there's no neocon who's smart enough calculating
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:12.120]  enough most of them are chicken hawks they're cowards where they wolf or
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:16.360]  wisp richard pearl hadley all of them were just sick
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:19.560]  defense and panderas this is not a sick defender
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.480]  you're talking about a man who defies being alone
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:27.240]  and the ability to be alone and let me go into that so you have to understand a
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:29.960]  little bit about norway and i want your listeners to understand
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:34.440]  yeah the power of one is wait a minute norway is a monolithic country it's
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.840]  4.5 million people they have no debt unlike the united
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:43.080]  states they have a cash flow that's constant because of the north
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:48.520]  see oils they have constant oil they are a socialist country for the most part
[01:27:48.520 --> 01:27:53.080]  they have a king and queen that's very little but they have a history of the
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:59.080]  individual being a very strong person now i don't want to get too cultural on you
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:01.960]  but many people in the audience have to understand there's no
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:05.400]  region of great people that takes command by the name of
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:09.560]  henry gibson a famous playwright who we still do the
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:13.320]  dollhouse have a more importantly we he wrote the master builder which is
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:16.520]  exactly what this individual is saying when he quotes
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:21.160]  jonathan mill milk and then he says the individual is more powerful than a
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:25.880]  society this is an even same effect with no neocon
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.720]  no government no other institution has been
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:34.440]  able to argue or suppress that the individual is without need
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:38.200]  and the individual of belief can create more disaster
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:42.680]  than the individual who has some interest this is also written by hypsin
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:45.800]  they then have another famous writer by the name of tenu
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:50.600]  can you tell some who won a Nobel prize in literature who reaffirmed
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:55.400]  i didn't know each cultural element that talks about the misery of the
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:59.000]  state and the society and the importance of the individual
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.240]  so you have to alex with all due respect you are your scholar in your own way
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:07.720]  to understand what makes norway different from the united states and the
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.160]  neocons here the neocons aren't relevant we're not
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:16.280]  going to suppress you or any no listen to me
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:20.440]  i know what our capabilities are we don't have a military that will come
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:25.080]  down and take us away we don't have a system that's able or
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:29.320]  willing or capable to take us all away that's why it's all a big
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:32.920]  sigh up we've got it we've got to go to break listen if you see nothing
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:35.880]  and if you see nothing in hollywood i.e.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:40.600]  washington dc you've seen the follies and incompetence of a dysfunctional
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:43.880]  government both on the right and the extreme right
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:47.640]  with your run polls and all the other guys who talked about

[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:55.960]  shovel at us and of course we're also adding starting

[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:08.600]  news show that comes on at seven o'clock central
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:11.880]  every evening stream live out to everybody

[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:24.680]  at prisonplanet.tv today okay let me stop right there
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:30.920]  my issue is that governments have been caught staging terror attacks over
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:34.200]  and over and over again private corporations do it
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:38.200]  kettler did it with the Reichstag and gliwitz to start world war two
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:41.640]  at gliwitz he used Reichstag to seize more power
[01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:47.960]  in february of 1933 we've seen army manuals on how to stage false flags
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:53.720]  we've seen countless examples of this so that's why out of the gates i always
[01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:57.800]  look at things and ask who benefits and i saw this huge
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:02.280]  buildup that okay we're not going to brand
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:06.120]  terrorism as muslim anymore we're going to move it over to
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:09.800]  conservatives who don't want a new world order now
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:14.760]  this guy reportedly attacks reportedly confesses today but we're not allowed to
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:18.920]  see that on camera as facebook gets altered the police knew who he was when
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:23.880]  they got there to the island but then on the other side he picks an island
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:28.200]  for the idea of psychological isolation and the fear of being
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:31.640]  shot while you're swimming on vacation and the children
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:35.480]  of the socialist elite and the multiculturalist
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:39.480]  you know sellouts as he calls them being killed
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:43.080]  if he would have targeted the muslims it would have made them
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:46.920]  the victims instead he went after the true ruling class that he saw is
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:50.280]  perpetrating it i see the precision i see
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:55.320]  the clear-eyed way he did this i understand that the
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:37:00.360]  people in scandinavia are are normally the folks that you know climb mount
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:06.200]  everest and are into all of this you know extreme long distance
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:11.240]  sports i understand the psychology and he wanted to sell the idea that the
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:15.000]  individual lone wolf can bring you down anytime we want
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  that's why 90 of warfare is psychological the system creates the idea
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.880]  you're powerless they build giant capital buildings
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:25.800]  to make you feel like you're little because it's the opposite and i agree
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:30.040]  his message of you are the individual you are unstoppable
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:35.960]  is the polar opposite of what neocons and liberals and collectivists push
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:40.520]  the only way they would trigger this is to create and they did this with al-qaeda
[01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:44.120]  the idea of the individual the army of one
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:48.520]  that the u.s. military talks about to to sell the idea
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:54.280]  of a clash in europe with the muslims and some would say that points towards
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:56.840]  israel so dr patrick you've got the floor and
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.800]  then i want to go to calls will keep you some of the next hour to get more into
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:03.400]  the info but i promise to go to calls during this hour but i understand
[01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:06.440]  where you're going with all of this and i know you've read over his material
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:11.640]  show of eyes so so break down uh exactly where you're going with this and
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:16.360]  then the 64 million dollar question clearly he's saying he didn't work alone
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:20.760]  other cells are about to strike and boy what a favor he's giving the
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:23.880]  establishment because they're not going to be able to stop these cells
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.840]  whether they're behind them or not they're sure going to be able to demonize
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:31.400]  alex jones and ron paul i don't think they're going to demonize alex
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:35.240]  jones and ron paul or even me or anybody else but this is a bad it's not even
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:38.600]  relevant about you and me or anybody who said
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:43.000]  they state that they're the extreme right the state at this point is totally
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.840]  imputed it has nothing to do with this act of terror this act of terror is
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:50.520]  bred as i said to you and you said out of their own
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:55.560]  influence of the culture and a man who has been systematically working out on
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:39:01.160]  the philosophy methodology not alone but as it was said in 2002
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:04.760]  he met with a group of others in england i suspect that british
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:08.520]  intelligence knows a lot about this and will assist
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:12.280]  the norwegians but more importantly what this is about
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.200]  is to literally say what he said which is to polarize the system
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:22.360]  in short let me call this a virtual push a ptsch which is what hitler did in
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:27.480]  the 1923s by creating a situation where he could
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:31.640]  create agitation kill his own people eventually the long knife
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:35.480]  and this is a virtual push he says very clearly this gentleman
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:40.360]  this man here he said berwick says their situation which cruelty is necessary
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:44.360]  and refusing to apply necessary cruelty is a portrayal of the people
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:48.760]  whom he wished to protect no government will go out and allow an
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:54.680]  individual to kill 80 children that is counterproductive to terrorism
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:58.680]  and aligning sympathy in order to have a group
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:03.720]  other than the fact that you have an individual who's saying look i'm above
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:08.200]  all the laws above all government systems and above all ideology these
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:12.040]  spells it out there's no newton there's no individual in our
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:15.080]  government who can sophisticatedly put this all
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:19.080]  together you overestimate and many of the people who listen to you
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:22.440]  overestimate the effectiveness of the government
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:27.400]  any government to effect effectuate any counter terrorist movement or even a
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:31.640]  terrorist movement the full flag and stand at a 9 11 was done in
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:36.440]  preparation over a period of time by two guys who were very clear about it
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:40.200]  that was bush jr rumsfeld and the needle puns i knew
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:43.400]  about that a long while before and i was against it
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:47.160]  this is very different this has been in preparation for a long while
[01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:52.120]  and my suspicion goes to sweden because in sweden where i wrote about this book
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:56.440]  20 years ago in active measures under the name alexander court
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:01.720]  i pinpointed the rise of the neo-nazis and the arian supremacy which by the way
[01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:07.240]  the swedes are not arian and the use against the christian religion which
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:10.520]  they're not fortunate by the way it's Lutheranism subsumed
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:15.480]  underneath the nation state to attack muslims so they could stop the immigration
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:18.600]  of muslims going through this was not an attempt to
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:22.680]  polarize the system into allowing the state to suppress
[01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:26.360]  the individuals that's the act of terrorism this is not what he's saying
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:31.000]  he doesn't want the state to suppress the individual he wants to say that he
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.440]  and other individuals will suppress the state
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:38.120]  and that in this world of the 21st century technology
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:41.640]  where he can use a semi-automatic weapon and kill
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:47.240]  80 kids in 90 minutes and be able to blow up a building with a hempho
[01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:52.120]  he can be more effective than a hundred thousand people and he's absolutely
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:56.680]  right he proved it i think it's a big mistake to compare this to al-Qaeda
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:41:59.960]  mcvay or anything else this is what we say in the business
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:03.320]  sui generis i've been waiting for this type of pristine
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:08.440]  terrorism and it sounds cynical to work with it and say how do we stop it
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:14.440]  because his attempt is to basically create an army of virtual army of
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:19.560]  individual terrorists under the rubric of christian which he mistakenly calls
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:24.120]  catholic because a nice template with catholic and they were also of many
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:28.920]  other uh uh disreputable elements and he's
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:34.600]  saying to those others i want you to arise as individuals not in the group
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:39.400]  this is a very different message this is what i call the 21st century
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:44.200]  neo-nazi movement but it really mirrors much more hitler's rise to power
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:47.720]  let me ask you you say you've gone over you say you've gone over his material
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:53.400]  are you seeing neo-nazi stuff because uh there's a lot of uh islamophobia
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:56.840]  and he he quotes a lot of neocon jewish writers
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:01.640]  are there are you saying he's a neo-nazi well i'm saying for one of any term
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:06.680]  he's it for me he's a 21st century virtual terrorist he knows exactly how
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:10.840]  to use the icons the music and he knows how to uh put it all
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:15.480]  together he knows how to quote france kafka i mean he says he's inspired by
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:19.240]  france kafka the trial france kafka was a jew
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:23.240]  he he doesn't care all that much about religion as much as he cares to
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:27.240]  mobilize all the elements of a mixed ideology
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:31.640]  including communism which he's against although he doesn't realize that he's
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:34.360]  acting very much like Stalin and trotsky
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:38.280]  he's a trotskyite like many of the neocons he's a trotskyite
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:41.560]  which means in effect he didn't understand the full understanding of what he
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:44.440]  was writing about a trotskyite believes in revolution
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:47.960]  irrespective of what your religion you know that's their big label they believe
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:51.400]  in blood now now blood flowing is there is there is
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:54.840]  their little secret chant now let's go back here
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:58.680]  though because i got an email about this and i looked it up i hadn't heard you
[01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:04.200]  on coast to coast but you just mentioned it and i went and found the quote
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:09.160]  but you said you knew about the 9-11 plan or you just alluded to that before
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:12.200]  it happened so let's digress into that you're saying
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:16.120]  you know who was specifically involved planning
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:21.320]  9-11 and the report was it's i don't want to get into that now you know you
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:26.120]  and i've talked about that but not on this show you said 1991
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:28.840]  jury no but did you want to get into that no but did you say
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:31.880]  i've been on your show i predicted correctly that Osama
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:36.040]  ben laden would be put out i i didn't stop it i didn't know exactly what the
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:40.120]  plan was but it's not a very difficult plan to figure out if you've got poor
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:44.920]  wolf who was university chicago trained under wolf steter who writes a book on
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:47.960]  stand down and false flag of pro-harbority you don't have to be a
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:51.880]  psychiatrist if you know who uh elliott abram's
[01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:55.400]  and he's a counsel in foreign relations and he's been involved in all kinds of
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:59.400]  chicane or he's for 20 years under different administrations it's not
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:02.360]  difficult why do criminals as a psychiatrist
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:07.080]  talking about i said it 10 11 years ago i fought my battle i worked with those
[01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:10.920]  in the system who i won't identify to get rid of rumsfeld to get rid of the
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:14.280]  neocons and then what happens your governor
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:18.040]  terry goes and who does he go to talk to don't fight
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:22.760]  the worst of the neocons the stupidest of the neocons and don rumsfeld
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:27.560]  so you tell me about stupidity my friend how does it perpetuate itself in the
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:30.840]  republican party when you have a mit romney
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:34.200]  who claims he's american yet his father was born in mexico
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:38.600]  and he doesn't want to tell the truth so why don't we talk about the disinformation
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:41.720]  of the people who are continuously there and stop talking about
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:46.600]  this national conspiracy what we have is sociopathy in this country
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.360]  we have two more men's running both of whom are incompetent
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:54.680]  both of whom are lying to the public and the republicans are saying to you you
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:58.680]  know we're going to put a idiot like michelle bachmann who talks
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:02.920]  about abortion and stupidity and it's a was a prosecutor
[01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:06.520]  for the irs and telling you about k-party no notions
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:11.560]  now i know stupidity doc i want to show you this is a government of the system
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:14.600]  isn't working my friend it's not that effective
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:18.040]  what we have here is a very effective pristine
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:22.680]  act of terror that has far greater significance than any government
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:26.600]  it means that there's virtual terrorism that's why i wrote the series of books
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:32.360]  called cyberterrorism cyber nation and active measures those of us who
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:36.600]  understood it i could predict it but i had a use of fiction but we have to
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:39.480]  talk about a system that's dysfunctional my friend and your
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:43.400]  audience has to understand that they're presented with a president who can't
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:47.640]  make a decision we've talked about that who's in a factual who owns the whole
[01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:51.640]  country hostage to a debt limit where we could lose our credit
[01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:55.560]  rating now if that's not terrorism you tell me what is
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:59.640]  now i hear you you're absolutely right it's not just you hear me this is really
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:02.360]  dangerous because the markets are already saying
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:05.400]  if we keep playing this kicking game it's very dangerous
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:08.200]  and on the other side you've got a more online partner
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:13.320]  and cancer both of whom are totally dysfunctional represent their own interests
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:16.280]  so now doc listen they said to ask your audience
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:20.520]  who in fact represents this country the united states of america
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:24.200]  and our soldiers and the ones who come back and our jobs that we need
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:27.800]  nobody's addressing it yeah doc you got one more on michelle bachman
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:31.720]  you got this guy carna was a pizza king and you got two more men who are
[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:36.040]  disasters husband was my ambassador to singapore he
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:39.960]  can't run his own campaign he put in two million dollars and he doesn't even
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:43.960]  know how to run a simple sure dr bachanin he's a business
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:47.080]  dr bachanin i've promised to go to phone calls but i want to put
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:50.200]  bookends on the terrorists right now if i can ask you and then later we'll get
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:53.160]  into we'll we'll get into politics here in just a minute
[01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:57.000]  no but it's relevant to this because we have a dysfunctional system and you're
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.320]  telling me that this system can create an attire
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:05.320]  a suppression of the us people it's not possible my friend
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:08.520]  well we're going to get in we'll we'll get into your
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:12.600]  research into the political rot and the level it's
[01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:16.040]  reach and i agree to you to a certain extent just have the bureaucracy and
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:19.480]  others and when they do carry out staged events like the bin Laden killing it
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:23.960]  is shoddy it is very obvious versus what's happened
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:29.000]  with this killer this reported killer over in Norway but but but finishing up
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.520]  with that when he talks about other cells at least two other
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:36.040]  cells and more attacks and and you talk about the
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:39.720]  fact that he didn't write all this and he didn't put all this together
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:45.320]  who who do you think's behind this well i think the Swedes are very much involved
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:48.200]  with this there's no question in my mind that part of this
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:52.600]  organization has Swedish inputs because the Swedes were very much involved in
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:55.880]  the 1990s when i wrote that book 20 years ago
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:00.040]  in terms of creating the rise of neo-nazi and the so-called quote
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:04.520]  Aryan supremacy when in fact Sweden has a very dangerous history
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:07.880]  and that's what i want to get into so people understand this is not against
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:13.240]  all Swedes the Swedes proclaim neutrality in the meantime the famous
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:16.360]  Wallenberg family who was supposedly saving
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:19.640]  jews that was a a full flag issue because they were
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:23.160]  they were he was he was they were ordered by the OSS the kind of
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:27.560]  he was more the famous physicist that one of their sons had to
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:32.760]  either rectify the name and instead you had Nazi elements in Sweden that
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:36.520]  hasn't ever changed so first of all the Swedish came during World War II
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:42.280]  was a Nazi was a German pro-german yet Mark Wallenberg who was developing
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:45.800]  armaments then you had Jacob Wallenberg who supported
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:51.320]  the Nazi party Sweden allowed 440,000 Nazis to go into
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:55.320]  Norma into Norway and broke the neutrality
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:58.760]  and allowed the Norwegians to fight them so on one hand of
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:03.320]  Norway you had quisling on the other hand in the few words you had all the men
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:07.240]  and women of Norway fighting the Germans and holding down
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:12.120]  440,000 people so the roots of Naziism comes through Sweden
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:16.040]  not Norway even though you had a quisling and you look at Sweden underneath
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:18.920]  that false flag and underneath the dissection
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:23.160]  propaganda of neutrality you will find the roots of the rise of the
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:28.440]  neo-nazi in the 21st century and that's what I would look at
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:32.360]  well it is it is something that we need to continue to
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:36.760]  research I just see a Freemason
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.720]  in the Scotland shooting being used to ban guns in the UK
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:45.400]  I see the Freemason with the Tasmanian situation
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:50.360]  in Australia being used and now this guy was meeting at
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:53.800]  some type of Knights Templar meeting in England
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:58.760]  the whole thing reeks of British intelligence but
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:01.320]  you're saying it doesn't we'll be right back
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:04.600]  we don't need to convince you that the threat of forced entry is on the rise

[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:08.600]  discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants flowers and herbs
[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:11.640]  it's called protogrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:14.760]  growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:18.040]  practically any soil and light conditions now here's the best part for
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:19.960]  our listeners who garden for self-reliance
[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:23.560]  protogrow's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:27.320]  dramatically increases bloom set creating maximum plant growth in minimum
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:30.440]  time protogrow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:33.400]  to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:36.280]  protogrow's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:39.160]  extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:42.760]  and if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass you can
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:45.880]  if you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids it's now
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:49.080]  easy GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the

[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:21.880]  studies using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:26.200]  severity and duration of common colds our powerful alicee contains 300
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:31.000]  milligrams of stabilized allicin just one tablet of alicee is equivalent to
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.960]  40 garlic cloves it's effective against asthma

[01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:01.000]  fight back with alicee
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:12.360]  okay i'm going to get dr. machinic to repeat what he said once we went to break
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:15.160]  he's on cell phones he doesn't hear the music when we're going out to break and
[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:18.280]  kept talking i wanted to be able to finish his
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:22.040]  statement when i talked about the british intelligence connection
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:27.400]  and then i asked dr. machinic former top counterterrorism specialist wrote the
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:30.120]  book the state department on it carried out many of his own
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:35.640]  operations himself will this guy be successful
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:38.760]  and you know what group does he think is behind him and then i promise we're
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:41.240]  going to your phone calls for those that have been patiently holding i'm going
[01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:44.840]  to get to you dr. machinic uh go ahead and repeat what you were
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:48.920]  saying well i said that he had a meeting in 2002 in
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:52.520]  london with the night's templar but when the group was founded i have no
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:57.080]  doubt in my mind the british intelligence mi5 had monitored if in fact
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:55:02.120]  there is any affiliation to mi5 or mi6 this will be very very serious for
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:05.160]  england especially after you and i predicted
[01:55:05.160 --> 01:55:08.520]  correctly that murdoch was involved with scotland yard
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:12.920]  and british intelligence but if this is the case england is in very serious
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:16.840]  trouble i hope it's not the case but i can't rule it out
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:20.600]  the other members of the group as i said had swedish influence there's no
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:23.400]  question in my mind that he has been influenced
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:26.600]  throughout his thinking and preparation by the swedes
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:31.320]  other members around east and uh northern europe possibly germans
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:35.720]  and others who know propaganda and theory there's there's a very clear
[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:38.600]  understanding in his presentation that i called it
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:42.520]  a cyberterrorism presentation because he's using the internet
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:46.840]  to brilliantly present propaganda through icons music
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:52.280]  and weapon systems and creating an ideology and fear through that internet
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:56.040]  without necessarily attacking any other institution
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:00.600]  other than the fact that he wants to promulgate his ideology and make himself
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:05.320]  the virtual head of the virtual entity called the 21st century neonazi
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:08.920]  movement this is nothing to do with christians and american or the
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:13.720]  patriots in america are citizen patriots but he will appeal to many people who
[01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:16.840]  are disaffected in europe and around the world
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:21.320]  with unemployment with lack of jobs and with immigration
[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:25.240]  and this is where we have to be very careful because our own intelligence
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:29.080]  system that he better be on top of this they have to get a group that thinks
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:32.760]  out of the box not in the box and they better start
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:36.600]  understanding what this is about this is a form of terrorism that's
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:40.360]  on steroids i have waited for this for 20 years this is
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:43.880]  unlike anything we've seen before he will stay alive
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:48.840]  and quite frankly in the world of terrorism by definition he is already
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:51.800]  successful he has created the terror that he needed
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:55.800]  whether we approve of it or not is not relevant but he will continue to be
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:01.080]  excess success success successful because he
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:04.520]  has been able to promulgate his theory explain it
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:10.200]  and appears normal he is not abnormal and he is not crazy it is a big mistake
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:15.400]  to categorize this individual as anything other than a very calculating
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:20.520]  cold killer and you can say whatever you want neonazi christian i don't believe
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:25.800]  he's any one of those other than a power grabber and a virtual push
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:30.280]  which means he's going to be the virtual leader of a 21st century cyber group
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:36.040]  that will in fact confront the issues that the white person feels in a time
[01:57:36.040 --> 01:57:40.440]  of dysfunction well he had to know he had to know
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:44.120]  that he's only going to serve a maximum of 21 years
[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:50.680]  under norwegian law that's 81 days per person killed but thank god now they've
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:56.200]  lowered the number of dead to 76 so that is certainly some good
[01:57:56.200 --> 01:58:01.080]  news that that number has been been lowered now i promise to go to calls
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:05.000]  utter poaching and i'm sure they'll be all over the map but you can
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:09.560]  spar with them back and forth you know quite frankly
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:12.840]  i don't know if i hope you're right or i hope you're wrong because
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:15.880]  it's frightening to think that government intelligence agencies
[01:58:15.880 --> 01:58:19.080]  would do something like this to go after the general public
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:22.840]  you know to rebrand the war on terror to everybody that's frightening
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:27.080]  but to think that there is somebody who pulled a hitler where he marched on you
[01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:29.960]  know from the beer hall to the government building to take over and
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:33.640]  a bunch of people got shot in that street battle and then hitler was put in
[01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:36.120]  jail for a couple years and wrote mind conf
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:39.480]  my struggle that was certainly all scripted we'll be right back to the

[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:43.000]  hour sorry tommy i wouldn't look at it where you called from i would have
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.640]  gone to you earlier tommy thanks for holding
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:48.920]  oh well that's fine alex it's my first time calling you never
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:52.680]  i've been uh listening to your radio show for some time now and uh
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:56.440]  well i'm kind of kind of nervous but i have a couple of questions actually i
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:02:00.840]  started just off with one uh dld in norway the data
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:05.640]  storage directory directly translated is uh law which is
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:09.800]  which uh the labor party actually last minute switched on and actually got
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:13.000]  forced through i think where they are going to store
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.880]  all the data on every individual citizen that they do online for six months
[02:02:17.880 --> 02:02:21.080]  prior to deleting it and that's going to be the law here in norway
[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:24.440]  oh yeah they're going to go after your guns everything and you see the build
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:27.880]  up to white al-qaeda is going to get you you know i don't want to disagree with
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:32.520]  dr pacanic but uh and i understand his view on this
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:36.440]  uh he doesn't think british intelligence is competent enough but
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:39.560]  you know western intelligence created al-qaeda and a narrative
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:42.520]  that got muslims to pick up on it even though they weren't part
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:46.200]  of the controlled arm i mean i mean or is it not
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:51.160]  unwise dr pacanic to underestimate uh the the intelligence agencies i mean i
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:54.680]  know you worked in in and around them so i'm not
[02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:58.360]  i'm not poo pooing what you've said i just i just see too many
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:02.760]  signs of chicanery i mean they may have found and profiled somebody
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:06.680]  who was intelligent you and and and would fit and would do
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:10.600]  what he was nudged to do uh but you yourself said he couldn't have
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:15.320]  have acted alone yeah but the you know when we talk about the
[02:03:15.320 --> 02:03:19.080]  intelligence agencies oh with older universities my condolences
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:23.080]  tom i have great respect for top for norway and i've enjoyed my
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:26.920]  visits there you you and assume i want the public to understand the
[02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:31.960]  intelligence agencies are really multiple and very diversified in the
[02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:35.880]  united states we have over 16 different intelligence agents and there's
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:39.480]  factions within each one i'm sorry and there's factions within each
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:43.080]  yeah and there are factions within them and you're not talking about one
[02:03:43.080 --> 02:03:46.280]  individual that has this incredible super brain
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:49.800]  that thinks out everything they're intelligence agencies that deal with
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:53.080]  sd and our intelligence agencies that deal with satellites i mean i don't have to
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:56.040]  go into specific specificity then you have the national
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:59.960]  intelligent estimate boards all of these particularly in our country have
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:04.280]  diversified opinions and believe me the last thing in the world
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:08.760]  you want to do is to sit there and claim that there's this monolithic entity
[02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:13.640]  that has a monolithic idea about what it is we should or should not do
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:17.400]  it all gets felt but usually in the briefing to the president of the united
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:20.920]  states and even he is not often aware i you know
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:25.320]  eisenhower our brilliant president in general often said
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:28.600]  you need a certain kind of genius to run
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:31.880]  our intelligence service and what he meant by that is
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:36.440]  no one not even he as a great president as he was during the wartime
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:41.400]  really understood how the cia work on their own they're highly individualistic
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:45.960]  nor did he have a full understanding of appreciation of all the intelligence
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:51.160]  stay there doc gotta break um tommy do you want to add anything else when we
[02:04:51.160 --> 02:04:55.000]  come back from norway yeah actually stay there stay there

[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.320]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:29.320]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem

[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:39.480]  all right we're into hour number three dr webster tarfley joining us to give us
[02:08:39.480 --> 02:08:44.760]  his perspective on the kickoff of uh the new branding of terror
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:47.720]  and regardless of whether it's real or staged they're certainly going to use
[02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:50.920]  it to take our basic liberties and freedoms they're calling for massive
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:54.600]  gun control after a guy went in and shot and killed five people
[02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:58.120]  and the dfw area of north texas yesterday
[02:08:58.120 --> 02:09:02.200]  and the issue is no matter how much gun control you bring in just like mexico
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:06.520]  total gunman there for the citizens uh people are still going to get guns and
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:11.640]  then that only makes disarmed people victims but dr steve pacenek is our
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:15.240]  guest tommy in norway had more comments and we'll get
[02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:18.360]  dr pacenek's take on it tommy calling from norway
[02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:23.080]  what was your other point my other point was that most of the youth parties in
[02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:26.120]  norway uh was against the ld and the one that was
[02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:30.840]  leading that resistance was actually the labor youth party which then was the
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:35.240]  people that were mostly on this island that was shot
[02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:40.680]  uh dr pacenek your statement on that
[02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:46.600]  most of the uh tom would you repeat that again
[02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:52.520]  what was that yeah uh most of the youth parties in norway was against the
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:56.680]  the dld the the data storage directive to monitor all
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:10:00.200]  injured traffic of every citizen but and and the youth party that was actually
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:05.800]  leading this was the uh the labor party youth party as i understand it
[02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:10.200]  going going against the grown-up party in a sense
[02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:14.280]  well i think it's it's an excellent point but i think what have what i
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:20.760]  what what i see in this man's ideology is is way beyond the particular ideology
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:25.800]  of restriction of data it really leads into the notion of why
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:29.560]  uh he should be the leader of really what would be a new
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:34.120]  type of people who would be forward expressing what i said to you before you
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:39.080]  know the notion of the individual being superior to any ideology or state
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:45.240]  and uh you know it echoes in the it's in play the master builder and canute
[02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:50.120]  hamson uh if you see it in in uh in many of the
[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:54.360]  cultural elements in your own history you see that notion not of a
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:57.960]  superiority of the individual but the superior of the strength of the
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:11:02.840]  individual and the willpower of that individual i don't think he was as much
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:07.160]  concerned about what that ideology stood for as much as it was an
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:11.320]  ideology that he could counteract and impose his own will
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:17.000]  on it that's why he liked cunt and why he reinforced he's very clear about his
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.480]  philosophers many of whom reify and defy the notion of the
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:24.840]  strength of the willpower and the will to die
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:30.360]  and actually he very he very closely mirrors the theories of trotsky
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:35.080]  and of stalin and of hitler interestingly enough as a side point uh
[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:39.000]  stalin and trotsky when they were revolutionaries and lennon
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.920]  were brought into british intelligence in the early 1900s
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:47.240]  and you know contrary to what the brits have said uh they were there and they
[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:51.480]  were had a discussion with them so i don't know what influence britain had
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:55.160]  on it but with all my respect to me i think this has more to do with the
[02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:58.520]  confluence of the history and cultural elements
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:03.400]  of norway as it's personified in an individual rather than the specific
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:07.320]  ideology as to whether he was last wing or not last
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:12.440]  wing he just wanted to reimpose the notion uh multiculturalism didn't work
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:16.360]  the white man is suppressed and and displaced
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:21.000]  and basically the white man has to reaffirm its position in the world
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:26.120]  by force and that uh uh being politically correct
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:31.880]  being uh peaceful and at a un is no longer a successor but all right
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:35.480]  while expanding uh i don't understand holding on for just a moment expanding
[02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:39.320]  norway killing prompts crackdown on brits opposed to immigration
[02:12:39.320 --> 02:12:43.240]  that's info wars dot com here's another info wars dot com
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:47.080]  headline steve wantson norway killer warns of two more cells
[02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:51.960]  repairing attacks so we're going to see what comes out of this but at the end
[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:54.840]  of the day this violence is only going to be used to take
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:58.920]  more of the general public's liberties uh charming thank you for the call
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:02.600]  from norway please call again dean in new york you're on the air any questions
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:06.040]  or comments uh yeah hi alex uh thanks for taking the
[02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:09.320]  call um seems that uh the investigative
[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:13.160]  journalist side of view is really trying to you know fit this
[02:13:13.160 --> 02:13:17.400]  single data point into the overall trend of demonizing
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:21.960]  uh the white terrorist but um again to mr bachanik's point
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:25.560]  which is that this person if i took time
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:29.560]  i read his manifesto not all of it of course but i did spend a lot of time
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:36.120]  reading it and he is calculated methodical he knew exactly what he was
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:39.960]  doing whether he received any kind of
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:44.280]  i whether he received any response any uh any support
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:48.680]  from outside is almost irregardless well he says he had the support
[02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:51.880]  and my issue is look at this giant police state we've built
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:55.080]  but doesn't keep us safe from terrorists the answer is more guns
[02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:59.160]  to protect ourselves keep your hands off my liberties uh dr pachanik
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:03.080]  comments on what the color alex alex dean is correct this gentleman hit it
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:07.480]  right on the head he is so calculating he is so purposeful he is so
[02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:10.840]  knowledgeable isn't that correct i mean this man has
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:15.320]  been able to assimilate what what i studied in propaganda theory
[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:18.760]  every ish month propaganda unlike any other person
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:22.440]  without getting sloppy about it and furthermore
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:26.760]  he is very clear as to his intention his cold-bloodedness
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:31.880]  and the fact that force will be supreme it's an old revolutionary concept but i
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:35.240]  agree with your your your listener he's right on the mark
[02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:40.120]  absolutely there's evidence here do you agree that this man is insane or crazy
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:46.040]  dean insane or crazy he spent nine years in approximately 310 000 euros
[02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:50.040]  in a calculated effort to pull this off he knew exactly what he's doing
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:55.720]  he even says in his manifesto that cruelty is important it's an element of
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:15:00.680]  the attack of the individual to show the the cultural Marxist
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:04.920]  more or less of who he's fighting against he's attacking his own people in
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:08.920]  order to wake them up okay and again it's a logical
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:13.240]  fallow dean it sounds like you you support him or you like it
[02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:17.560]  no i do not know absolutely it's as boring it's like pacenic said he is the
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:21.800]  most dangerous type of terrorist he operates on his own he's cold
[02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:26.600]  calculated and if he was unable to create a
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:30.520]  virtual terrorist network that would make this
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:34.520]  phony uh unit bomber all you know all these phony guys
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:38.280]  like the fbi they they take these idiots right and they put bombs in their
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:41.400]  pants they put them on planes yeah no drug down idiots that can't even tie
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:45.480]  their shoelaces no no i hear you dean thank you so much let's let's really hit
[02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:48.920]  it on the head and i think your audience is getting it very much dean you're
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:52.280]  right on the mark this is far more dangerous than anything i've ever seen
[02:15:52.280 --> 02:15:55.400]  and believe me i have worked in many many hundreds of
[02:15:55.400 --> 02:16:00.440]  terrorist groups and interrogated a lot of terrorists this man is an individual i
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:04.360]  would like to question and interrogate and spend time with because i don't think
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:07.400]  our intelligence community at this point quite frankly
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:11.320]  is really that capable or is neither is the norwegian or the british
[02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:15.160]  intelligence to really understand what he's about i think dean
[02:16:15.160 --> 02:16:19.080]  had a much better understanding that what's been coming out thank you dean i
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:21.480]  i agree with you not because it happens to
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:25.400]  but you understand it i think your audience really gets it this man is far
[02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:28.600]  more dangerous than anything you've ever seen before yeah well people better
[02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:32.360]  keep their hands off my guns and my liberty and my freedom and and you know
[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:35.640]  the bottom line they're coming after folks that are against the new world order
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:38.680]  right now using this guy and it stinks to high heaven
[02:16:38.680 --> 02:16:43.480]  and again i saw the crescendo building up to imminent whitey attacks
[02:16:43.480 --> 02:16:47.960]  on thursday and i'm telling you i see scripting written all over this
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:51.320]  now they may have known about him let him do it protected him
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:55.080]  the other cells may be you know double agents we don't know
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:59.240]  but this has got a lot of earmarks that make me very suspicious but
[02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:02.520]  it's good to have a debate and look into it and i do see the points that
[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:07.800]  dr pacenic is making brenda in illinois you're on the air go ahead
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:14.440]  hello hi go ahead hi how are you i wanted to ask dr pacenic just what you
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:17.960]  were bringing up just now your point about gun grabbing i live in gun grabbing
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:20.440]  illinois where you can't believe how hard it is but
[02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:24.360]  anyway i was wondering if he had seen the
[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:30.520]  latest propaganda piece from dhs on thursday which you were going over and
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:34.360]  if he you know sees any of the the ties to this coming back
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:38.360]  to the states anywhere maybe not necessarily with this yeah the dhs rolling
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:42.600]  out wide al qaeda videos and showing the minorities reporting on the white
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:46.120]  devils this was released about a week before
[02:17:46.120 --> 02:17:49.720]  these new events and i've gotten the internal training manuals
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:53.080]  where they're telling every police department the veterans will
[02:17:53.080 --> 02:17:58.040]  ied you the veterans are the terrorist we've got to prepare mass arrest
[02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:01.880]  of the evil pro america people i mean that's my point is this is going on
[02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:05.720]  behind the scenes you say governments incompetent they've either
[02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:11.320]  competently predicted the real threat or they're staging it which is it
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:15.400]  well i don't get it i think brenda's hit something that's very important this
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:19.400]  this man will resonate with a lot of disaffected
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:23.400]  veterans who will come back there is a real issue now that unfortunately the
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:27.400]  veterans are not being treated at the da they have no jobs
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:31.480]  they've been displaced from their homes we've talked about this repeatedly
[02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:35.560]  our government is not addressing this issue instead of worrying about there
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:38.760]  being targeted terrorists the real issue is going to be we have
[02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:43.000]  veterans with btsd organic brain damage and we're doing
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:46.920]  nothing about it the da and unfortunately general shinseki
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:50.840]  has not been competent i i'm i'm unfortunate because i was an admirer
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:55.080]  of his but he is not good at running the da i have heard too much from other
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:59.160]  doctors that their veterans were being short changed particularly on these
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:02.440]  issues okay but what do you make of them
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:06.440]  let's go let's go ahead precautions here but not a systematic repercussion but
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:09.880]  he will resonate with groups of white people
[02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:15.080]  and others that feel uh disaffected that feel unappreciated and have no jobs
[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:19.400]  and the reality is by the way there are no jobs and we are disaffected and the
[02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:23.560]  system isn't working so there is a basis of reality for which
[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:28.920]  he taps in he this terrorist taps into the reality of what's happening in
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:33.000]  europe and the united states because brilliant propaganda is not
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:36.280]  distorted propaganda and that's unfortunately alex where you and i
[02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:39.240]  different american propaganda with a stand-down
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:42.440]  on a false flag is distorted propaganda in a way it's very
[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:47.080]  amateurish is his brilliant and that it taps into the very emotional core
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:50.600]  of the disaffection that you're saying you've got to tell the truth
[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:53.400]  and connect that to your terrorism if you're going to do it
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:57.080]  all right uh brenda will try to cram in a few more for dr pacinic
[02:19:57.080 --> 02:20:02.280]  we'll have him back soon on politics

[02:24:24.200 --> 02:24:27.960]  decision the rest of congress doesn't vote on this
[02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:31.160]  obama is talking about using the 14th amendment

[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:46.360]  and that's a quote out of a singin n article of the president

[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:07.080]  path our collision course with collapse

[02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:41.880]  cyberterrorism or what i believe to be cyberterrorism is that okay
[02:25:41.880 --> 02:25:46.760]  yeah go ahead sir you're on air okay um well there was a report that came on
[02:25:46.760 --> 02:25:52.360]  bloomberg in december on the uh the 3.3 trillion in
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:57.080]  backdoor bailouts are you familiar with that yeah now it's up to 16 trillion
[02:25:57.080 --> 02:26:01.400]  okay yeah well that was set private by somebody
[02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:04.520]  and i'm not saying i know who it was but i took a video of it
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:07.960]  it's up on my youtube channel let's talk politics with an x
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:11.480]  there's no set private by who on bloomberg
[02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:18.840]  yeah very interesting very interesting yes it was i i didn't upload
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:22.760]  a version that was legible uh until um
[02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:28.040]  the 16th oh this uh okay tanner tanner uh let me
[02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:32.440]  is there a specific point here yes go ahead okay
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:36.280]  on the 16th on the 17th the view counts were really low
[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:39.960]  so i went in and i started spamming the second most few video i said
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:42.840]  i said reason the view counts are so low is because
[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:45.800]  this video is no want to go viral that i want you to see that they're
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:50.120]  they're censoring backdoor bailouts because that's pretty bad you know
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:53.960]  okay within an hour and uh 15 minutes it went from
[02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:59.400]  60 000 views to 125 000 views so fast that they didn't even catch up the
[02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:03.160]  first most few and i proved that it was because of what i did because
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:07.080]  somebody left a comment on my video i gotta let you go at that point
[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:11.160]  uh there's all sorts of stuff going on with youtube and it's well known
[02:27:11.160 --> 02:27:14.280]  that there have been a lot of backdoor bailouts now 16 trillion
[02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:18.200]  the foreign banks and domestic companies like msnbc and it's a
[02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:22.040]  very serious uh problem again of corruption
[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:28.120]  that dr pacinic brings up and you know the fact that they don't care now that
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:32.040]  you know that the federal government's funding a lot of national media
[02:27:32.040 --> 02:27:35.480]  and that no one gets in trouble for it or nobody gets in trouble for all the
[02:27:35.480 --> 02:27:38.840]  other corruption it just shows how systemic all this is
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:42.440]  dr pacinic no it's absolutely true i mean
[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:46.040]  the issue that you and i brought out in june about the corruption that we predict
[02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:49.400]  the corruption of the british government with murdoch and murdoch
[02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:53.320]  has been absolutely uh abysmal i've tracked and since i was a deputy
[02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:55.960]  assistant secretary of state under bush senior
[02:27:55.960 --> 02:27:59.480]  1991 and i already had questions about his involvement
[02:27:59.480 --> 02:28:03.800]  and his corruptions in asia and then he moved to the united states and got an
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:07.400]  american citizenship pretty quickly and started up buying papers there's no
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:11.000]  question in my mind that if anything if there's any
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.720]  bravery among our congressmen or senators they should have an
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:16.920]  investigation and the FBI should open up an investigation
[02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:20.280]  there's no question in my mind you will find the same kind of corruption the
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:23.960]  same kind of collusion used on britain here in the united states and
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:27.800]  particularly his assistants of illy clinton our secretary of state
[02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:31.480]  when she was running for the senate she had depended very heavily on him for
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:34.520]  advice and money so i think you have all kinds of
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:37.880]  corruption going on both in the democratic republican party
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:41.400]  from my point of view it's no longer legitimate government i think we're so
[02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:45.240]  dysfunctional the president dysfunctional the whole system's dysfunctional
[02:28:45.240 --> 02:28:49.640]  we need a third option and that's where you alice comes in
[02:28:49.640 --> 02:28:53.320]  where we have to discuss about a third option and your formidable audience
[02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:56.520]  understands what the problem's in it doesn't have to get into social
[02:28:56.520 --> 02:28:59.880]  conservatism it has to get into a party which has to deal with
[02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:04.280]  pragmatism and how do we get the united states to maintain its republic
[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:07.720]  while in the meantime we're in imperial power all over the world and our
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:12.520]  military's displayed all over the world but we have no jobs we have no strategy
[02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:16.600]  no tactics and no leadership on both sides you have men who are basically
[02:29:16.600 --> 02:29:19.560]  panders you have people who are sociopaths you have
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:24.120]  women who are streaming about absolutely nothing and everybody is just
[02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:28.600]  talking about nonsense and we have to get back and get rid of all this
[02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:32.440]  corruption and basically restart the government on a pragmatic point of view
[02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:36.440]  building jobs which we can do very easily bringing back our foreign
[02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:39.480]  companies from overseas particularly china
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:43.400]  and indian if they don't want to come back then we'll tax them and let them go
[02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:46.680]  dr pacinic thank you so much for spending time with us we'll talk to you again

[02:33:18.680 --> 02:33:23.320]  it has the word jews three hundred and twenty four times in it
[02:33:23.320 --> 02:33:27.320]  in a positive light so some folks are saying
[02:33:27.320 --> 02:33:30.600]  neo-nazi i don't really agree with that perspective
[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:35.080]  because it's not there uh in fact here's the jerusalem post let me just read
[02:33:35.080 --> 02:33:39.800]  this to you norway attack suspect had anti muslim pro-israel
[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:45.000]  views in the 1500 page manifesto credited to
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:50.920]  bravic accused of killing spree lays out a worldview including extreme
[02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:55.640]  screed of islamophobia and far right zionism
[02:33:55.640 --> 02:34:02.200]  anders bravic the norwegian who killed nearly 100 people in a combined terror
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:05.720]  attack friday that included car bombings in oslo
[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:09.240]  and a shooting rampage at a island summer camp
[02:34:09.240 --> 02:34:12.520]  held fiercely anti islamic and pro-israel views
[02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:17.640]  according to a 1500 page manifesto he uploaded before his killing spree
[02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:25.240]  friday continuing in the 1500 page tome which mentions israel 359 times
[02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:31.240]  and jews three and 24 times bravic lays out his worldview which includes an
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:36.760]  extremely bizarre and rambling screed of islamophobic far right zionism
[02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:39.720]  well yeah when you hear the term cultural marxism i mean that's right out of
[02:34:39.720 --> 02:34:45.160]  the neocons and venomous attacks on marxism and multiculturalism
[02:34:45.160 --> 02:34:49.320]  in one passage he lashes out at western media which he accuses of unfairly
[02:34:49.320 --> 02:34:54.120]  focusing on the wrongdoing of jews western journalists again and again
[02:34:54.120 --> 02:34:57.960]  systematically ignore serious muslim attacks and rather focus on the jews he
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:02.920]  wrote bravic also took a jab at left-wing jews jews that
[02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:07.560]  support multiculturalism today are much of a threat to israel and zionism as
[02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:11.480]  they are to us he continued so let us fight together with israel
[02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:16.680]  with our zionist brothers against all anti zionist against all cultural
[02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:23.480]  um marxist and multiculturalist you know i remember
[02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:27.320]  covering friday and then sunday jaren pointed it out
[02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:31.480]  that this was the anniversary or no it was erin that it was just doesn't matter
[02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:34.760]  the point is that it was the anniversary of the bombing of the king david
[02:35:34.760 --> 02:35:39.640]  hotel by zionist left-wing zionist or i was rama manual's dad wasn't
[02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:43.240]  yeah um of the king david hotel that's why savage
[02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:46.840]  who's jewish came out and said michael savages said look
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:50.440]  let me tell you this guy's the son of eargun look for him to stage attacks
[02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:53.560]  and blame it on the right wing and now you've got this guy claiming he's
[02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:57.080]  working with friends uh and this is very
[02:35:57.080 --> 02:36:02.040]  sophisticatedly done israeli's put out sophisticated stuff folks
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:05.400]  and you know uh pacenic's telling us how unbelievably inept
[02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:09.320]  intelligence agencies are and i respect him on the bin laden thing being fake
[02:36:09.320 --> 02:36:12.600]  at 9 11 and i've really found it you know historically he knows what he's
[02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:16.200]  talking about he's a smart guy uh i've done a lot of research as well and i'm
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:20.280]  not trying to get in a fight with pacenic uh it's just that and we've
[02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:24.360]  got tarply in the wings right good and we may have to go into overdrive
[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:27.000]  today obviously we're going to go into overdrive
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:30.040]  the problem is i'm never going to get this tv show launched but hey i'm pulling
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:33.720]  the trigger september 1st or thereabouts i'm launching the nightly tv show
[02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:37.960]  and that's the end of it okay that's the end of it
[02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:43.800]  uh but you know i i did four hours for years i did three hours for
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:48.920]  14 years i did four hours for two and a half years or so and now i've been back
[02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:52.680]  to three because i've got to i've got to focus on this tv show it'll be just as
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:57.320]  power packed as the radio show but condensed out of 30 minutes
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:00.120]  i guess i've just got to really say goodbye to my family that's the answer
[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:03.720]  to all my problems i love being with my family it's the best part of my day best
[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:06.840]  part of my life but i cannot complete this mission if i continue to go home

[02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:39.240]  bottles under the sink on top of the counter whole house filters all made in
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:41.640]  the usa you want to completely remove fluoride and
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:45.400]  other toxins they've got it you want on the go systems that reduced it all
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:48.280]  and they have those as well purewaterfreedom.com take control of
[02:40:48.280 --> 02:40:52.600]  your water supply today and again all of their systems are made in the usa
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:55.800]  and that's hard to do nowadays it's hard to find stuff made in the usa
[02:40:55.800 --> 02:41:01.000]  purewaterfreedom.com take control of your water supply purewaterfreedom.com
[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  and we also couldn't do this show without the support of our sponsors
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:08.600]  uh okay if you just joined us the jerusalem post says
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:15.240]  he was a rabid right wing zionist and he used the terms that right wing neocons
[02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:18.920]  uh and zionists use on radio in the us it's just a fact
[02:41:18.920 --> 02:41:23.000]  i don't know if he wrote this manifesto the easter bunny could have done it
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:26.440]  it's admitted that his facebook was manipulated
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:29.960]  it was in the google wayback machine saved
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:33.640]  and we were able to track that other big news reports are confirming that someone
[02:41:33.640 --> 02:41:35.960]  went in and changed it from knight's temple or
[02:41:35.960 --> 02:41:40.040]  illuminati member mason uh to christian conservative
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:44.280]  this is a rebranding clearly regardless of whether it's real or not
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:47.560]  from the muslim threat we're taking your rights away because of it to
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:50.840]  everybody's a terrorist and i told you this was coming last week
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:54.840]  we had drills the days before blowing up things less than a kilometer away
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:58.680]  we had the police showing up knowing the government's name and saying hands up
[02:41:58.680 --> 02:42:01.880]  they show up 90 minutes later and then they don't take him out
[02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:06.040]  they just say hey uh you know lay your gun down uh bravery
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:11.080]  and uh uh anders uh bravek and he he he comes out and does that he's going to
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:15.640]  serve 21 years maximum and he's going to be this big hitlarian hero when he gets
[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:18.520]  out i guess i can pair it to that because hitler did
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:22.280]  the same thing with his beer hall attack on the parliament and then he got put in
[02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:26.840]  jail for a year and a half and wrote my comp uh that was all stage so this is
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:30.840]  definitely nasty they want to have a new class of civilizations
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:35.400]  and this has got that written all over it
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:39.080]  and the fact that he's fawning around uh with
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:42.520]  the kill all the muslims oh i love israel stuff
[02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:45.800]  uh or that could be a complex frame up of that i mean again
[02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:48.680]  you can't believe the facebook you can't believe the web stuff we don't know
[02:42:48.680 --> 02:42:51.560]  any of this and they wouldn't let him be seen in court
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:54.840]  they wouldn't let him be seen in court they wouldn't let him speak in front of
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:42:58.680]  the camera so we don't know if he's even saying these things he said
[02:42:58.680 --> 02:43:02.440]  to me he looks highly intelligent but he also with that little smirk
[02:43:02.440 --> 02:43:05.160]  looks like he's flown over the cuckoo's nest
[02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:09.720]  uh obsessive compulsive basically webster tarpley doctor of history frequent
[02:43:09.720 --> 02:43:12.440]  guest here and contributor tarpley dot net
[02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:16.520]  um my friend what do you think's really going on here we just had
[02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:21.480]  dr steve pacenek on his illustrious career in black ops himself
[02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:26.040]  um you know the jack ryan character in the tom clancy patrick games novels
[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:29.880]  co-author with him he's saying this is the pristine real
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:33.160]  terrorism the equivalent of the gilded unicorn
[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:36.520]  never known before he admits most terrorists sponsored
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:40.760]  he says this is not synthetic what says uh webster griffin tarpley
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:44.600]  well i have to say in regards to your previous guest when uh one moral was
[02:43:44.600 --> 02:43:48.840]  being held by the red brigades i was part of the effort to try to find moral
[02:43:48.840 --> 02:43:52.840]  and to uh to save his life and i guess your previous guest was on the other
[02:43:52.840 --> 02:43:56.120]  side of that so i have to disagree with him again
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:44:00.280]  what we've got here with bribeck is a patsy on steroids
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:05.320]  this is either a psychotic or a fanatic or a double agent or a mercenary
[02:44:05.320 --> 02:44:08.280]  or something like this he is entirely a creature
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:12.040]  of nato intelligence and this entire event is inconceivable
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:17.880]  without sponsorship by nato intelligence first of all uh concerning the
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:21.400]  ideological profile of the patsy i mean one of the main rules
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:24.840]  in an analysis as you've shown over the years
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:27.880]  is that we don't want to focus too much on the patsy
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:30.680]  that is being projected through the world media
[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:33.960]  we want to look for the technicians and the moles
[02:44:33.960 --> 02:44:37.000]  that they don't want you to see because the whole thing is designed to get you
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:40.840]  to fix it yeah he's all flashy and the and the photo
[02:44:40.840 --> 02:44:45.080]  shot glamour shots the videos the treatises it's all
[02:44:45.080 --> 02:44:50.120]  a big fat ball of bacon on the end of a hook trying to catch a crowd it's
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:54.600]  like a public relations firm has gone to work for him he's got publicity photos
[02:44:54.600 --> 02:44:57.800]  it's like a press kit that people have been given for this character
[02:44:57.800 --> 02:45:02.040]  now just interesting in this 1500 page
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:06.120]  screen of his and maybe you can you can also comment on this as i understand
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:10.280]  it from the london daily telegraph a lot of that is simply plagiarized
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:14.200]  lifted word for word from the unabomber manifesto and that
[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:18.680]  already is a contradiction because no they admit about 95 percent of it is
[02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:22.600]  plagiarized and unattributed which is what intelligence agency just
[02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:25.880]  recently constantly get caught recycling garbage
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:29.640]  i guess they the cia or nato intelligence budget didn't allow them to
[02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:32.680]  go out and hire some new the new hack writers but
[02:45:32.680 --> 02:45:37.480]  again enough of him let's look for the moles and let's look for the technicians
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:41.160]  maybe we start with the technicians according to this interesting oslo
[02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:44.440]  newspaper vg and i've been getting some reports on
[02:45:44.440 --> 02:45:49.000]  from some very fine people in norway the vg reports
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:52.600]  eyewitnesses there are these two eyewitnesses that they name
[02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:56.760]  and other eyewitnesses unnamed at this youth camp on the island
[02:45:56.760 --> 02:46:00.440]  whose state emphatically categorically there is a second
[02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:04.280]  shooter and they even give you a description he's one meter eighty
[02:46:04.280 --> 02:46:08.360]  centimeters tall dark hair Nordic features whatever that means
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:12.040]  i guess it means something in their parlor lantern job
[02:46:12.040 --> 02:46:15.880]  just just just keep going here yeah the so
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:19.800]  this is this looks like the person who actually carried out the shooting because
[02:46:19.800 --> 02:46:23.800]  we've we've seen this again and again right with with major hassan at fort
[02:46:23.800 --> 02:46:29.320]  hood they were one to drill other shooters columbine
[02:46:29.320 --> 02:46:34.680]  seven seven sirhan with show virginia tech there was a second
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:38.920]  shooter there now the police response to this as i
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:43.480]  understand it just to say there may be somebody else this is an ongoing
[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:46.360]  investigation but if you talk about a second
[02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:50.120]  shooter then you're spreading fear that's obviously they want us to press
[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:54.360]  this i think this is important don't let them write this out of the media
[02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:59.640]  narrative because it did get into cnn and cbs radio news and friends 24
[02:46:59.640 --> 02:47:02.840]  and the world media have somehow registered that there was no just like
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:06.360]  john doe number two did and then the fbi agent came out and told the la times
[02:47:06.360 --> 02:47:09.160]  i've seen the tapes that we've confiscated international security
[02:47:09.160 --> 02:47:12.600]  it shows mcvay with a whole bunch of people including
[02:47:12.600 --> 02:47:16.440]  john doe number two and it's and we had eyewitnesses from
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:19.320]  inside the building that saw mcvay a day before
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:23.000]  with the very same men inside doing telephone company work with
[02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:26.840]  gray sticks of butter i mean it's always the same of course this guy didn't
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:30.520]  act alone and they know the public's going to wake up to that so now he says
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:34.920]  there's other cells they're about to strike any minute webster go ahead
[02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:38.200]  but before we get to this one of the techniques is then if the police
[02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:41.400]  realized that there are these persistent reports of a second shooter with
[02:47:41.400 --> 02:47:44.600]  plenty of eyewitnesses and even a description in this case which is
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:47.560]  remarkable they go out and arrest somebody and
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:51.080]  then say oh no that was the guy but it turns out that he's not involved at
[02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:55.400]  1 p.m on friday a man with a knife was arrested
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:59.720]  and then released uh there had been as i understand it raids
[02:47:59.720 --> 02:48:03.160]  in a number of countries there's even a guy in poland
[02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:07.320]  according to my reports there's a guy in poland who is still being held
[02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:10.280]  under suspicion he at least has been arrested
[02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:13.720]  in poland as a possible accomplice so
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:16.520]  this is the thing to look at because we have to assume
[02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:20.520]  that this other figure is the second shooter
[02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:23.560]  the technician in other words the person who really has
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:26.920]  the weaponry he's described as somebody with an automatic rifle and the
[02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:31.240]  revolver or handgun and we have to assume that
[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:34.920]  it's going to be very difficult to kill 75 or 80 people
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:38.200]  on an island if you're just one person that poses
[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:42.920]  just intrinsic uh problems uh barriers that it's going to be very hard for
[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:46.360]  anybody to go through so this is i think the first thing
[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:50.520]  the second thing is the presence of moles now the moles would be
[02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:54.280]  people inside the state apparatus inside the police the justice ministry
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:59.640]  whatever it is who protect the patsy and we know this came out a year ago that
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:03.880]  the cia had penetrated their state police national police
[02:49:03.880 --> 02:49:07.080]  and the oslo police and we're recruiting them to fight
[02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:11.400]  terror including retired police that's the perfect network for this
[02:49:11.400 --> 02:49:15.240]  right this is of course as you say the c mass uh security
[02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:21.960]  incident management analysis system s i m a s that's the network that's the u.s
[02:49:21.960 --> 02:49:25.720]  government and the what the the cells that they set up they set up cells
[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:29.400]  too these are called surveillance detection units
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:36.120]  s d us so an oslo television station in november of 2010 reports
[02:49:36.120 --> 02:49:39.560]  the u.s government is avidly recruiting
[02:49:39.560 --> 02:49:44.280]  former policemen retired policemen including the former head of the oslo
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:48.760]  anti-terror police to take part in these surveillance
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:52.920]  detection units of the security incident webster this couldn't be any
[02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:56.200]  clearer i mean norway's not toe in the line for the new
[02:49:56.200 --> 02:50:00.520]  world order police state and so they get a right wing attack in
[02:50:00.520 --> 02:50:02.760]  there and now they get to use it all over the world
[02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:07.080]  you've got the financial times of london saying that this attack personifies
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:10.680]  the rise of the new right let me read the exact headline
[02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:16.600]  uh and then meanwhile that's the uh name of the rise of the new right
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:20.760]  show on msnbc implying that i'm calling for violence
[02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:24.520]  by editing my words out of context i mean they
[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:28.520]  this is really a setup webster it is all completely absurd because everybody
[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:32.360]  should realize every word out of this guy's mouth every word on his
[02:50:32.360 --> 02:50:36.840]  idiotic manifesto this is coming from nato headquarters Brussels look at it
[02:50:36.840 --> 02:50:42.520]  that way or langby virginia or wilton uh and whereas nato was staging
[02:50:42.520 --> 02:50:46.680]  operation latino stuff against leftist and people in the 70s and 80s
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:50.440]  now it's against the populist who aren't going to go along with the new world
[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:52.680]  order takeover webster tart let's stay there

[02:54:11.480 --> 02:54:17.480]  into a burning ring of fire i want to continue looking at this
[02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:21.160]  bombing and shooting and people like hey it's norway why do we care
[02:54:21.160 --> 02:54:25.080]  ladies and gentlemen they are all over the news every major tv station every
[02:54:25.080 --> 02:54:28.040]  major network in europe the united states england
[02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:31.640]  saying they are going to start putting conservatives on no fly list
[02:54:31.640 --> 02:54:35.480]  with no judge no jury they're going to start tracking everybody they're going
[02:54:35.480 --> 02:54:38.200]  to start demonizing they're going to start tracking gun
[02:54:38.200 --> 02:54:41.640]  purchases outside of law the atf already started that
[02:54:41.640 --> 02:54:47.720]  i saw all the prescripting to change the war on terror away from only
[02:54:47.720 --> 02:54:50.920]  hyperventilating about muslims underneath the table
[02:54:50.920 --> 02:54:56.920]  trying to bite you to the white people the conservatives the libertarians
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:55:02.040]  uh you know they are the devil if somebody's hispanic and a libertarian
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:06.040]  look out or black and into freedom look out
[02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:09.320]  this is basically about the system going after everybody
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:13.320]  the left are terrorists the muslims are terrorists the right-winger terrorists
[02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:16.280]  everybody's a terrorist but the ruling class and
[02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:19.880]  you look at all of these things as facebook being changed and christian
[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:24.440]  and conservative being added i mean i i i disagree with dr pechenek i mean i
[02:55:24.440 --> 02:55:28.600]  i could see from his perspective that you know he thinks this is real
[02:55:28.600 --> 02:55:32.920]  uh but uh i mean i don't see evidence of that and i wish
[02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:37.320]  that was the truth because that's not as scary as knowing the system did this
[02:55:37.320 --> 02:55:42.040]  now webster we have their own media saying look for some reason nato in the
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:45.000]  u.s. are infiltrating us we have a history of over 200
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:48.840]  bombings in gladio for those that don't know tell folks what gladio is
[02:55:48.840 --> 02:55:53.400]  and nato stay behind networks um this group's trying to pull out of nato
[02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:57.240]  operations i mean this this is really pretty obvious
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:00.680]  here i think it's quite obvious let me just say concerning the police
[02:56:00.680 --> 02:56:03.400]  moles in the police before we move on to your question
[02:56:03.400 --> 02:56:07.800]  the moles in the police i think are indicated by the fact that it takes
[02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:11.080]  90 minutes 60 minutes 90 minutes an hour and a half
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:14.760]  for the police to get to the island why were there no helicopters
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:19.720]  available in oslo to transport a swat team the delta force or whatever they
[02:56:19.720 --> 02:56:23.480]  have from downtown oslo or wherever their base is
[02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:27.240]  to this island with the youth camp why did they have to go by
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:31.560]  by car essentially why no helicopters and why when they get there
[02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:35.160]  did they load all their equipment into a boat and then have the boat begin to
[02:56:35.160 --> 02:56:38.280]  sink uh you can say this this is the keystone cops
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:42.680]  this is a comedy of errors but i don't think so it reminds me again of
[02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:46.200]  the paris police leaving princess diana in this car
[02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:49.880]  for the best part of an hour after that accident it's a level of incompetence
[02:56:49.880 --> 02:56:53.800]  that simply cannot be believed so it takes them an hour and a half to get to
[02:56:53.800 --> 02:56:57.640]  the island and then when they get there they know the guy's name and they call
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:01.400]  them by name now this indicates a profound
[02:57:01.400 --> 02:57:05.000]  subversion of the norwegian police i would point out
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:11.480]  this is a monarchy and in monarchies it's easier in many many cases to subvert
[02:57:11.480 --> 02:57:16.440]  the government institutions than it is in in uh something that's not a monarchy
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:21.000]  so i think that that also uh plays into it so i think we've got
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:25.320]  we've got a patsy he's being built up he's be he's a media star
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:29.000]  we've got a technician at least one technician in the background
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:33.080]  that would be the second shooter and we've got pretty obvious moles in the
[02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:36.440]  police we even have a name for their network that would be this
[02:57:36.440 --> 02:57:41.000]  s i m a s now you say gladio i would the the question for me is
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:45.000]  is this security incident management analysis system
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:49.560]  the new gladio the old gladio was that when general liman lemnitzer
[02:57:49.560 --> 02:57:53.480]  after having made it made that operation northwood's proposal
[02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:57.720]  to uh to kennedy and getting turned down lemnitzer then went on to become the
[02:57:57.720 --> 02:58:02.280]  commander of nato in brussels and he began to set up what were called stay
[02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:06.600]  behind operations they already existed but he put them on a new
[02:58:06.600 --> 02:58:10.520]  active footing now these existed in all countries the italian case
[02:58:10.520 --> 02:58:13.800]  is best documented but there are pretty good
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:18.280]  indications in other countries so the gladio is a series of arms caches
[02:58:18.280 --> 02:58:21.720]  with guerrilla fighters organized around them the idea is that they'll wage
[02:58:21.720 --> 02:58:25.720]  guerrilla warfare against the soviet red army if the soviets rolled over but
[02:58:25.720 --> 02:58:29.160]  instead they go stage terror attacks and blame it on their political
[02:58:29.160 --> 02:58:33.880]  enemies in false flags what i'm sure we got to go to break
[02:58:33.880 --> 02:58:37.640]  main radio shows over going into expanded overdrive
[02:58:37.640 --> 02:58:43.640]  at prisonplanet.tv right now stay with us
[02:58:43.640 --> 02:58:51.000]  thank you for listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[02:58:52.360 --> 02:58:56.360]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:58:56.360 --> 02:59:00.600]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[02:59:00.600 --> 02:59:04.840]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the americans at home
[02:59:04.840 --> 02:59:08.920]  i've turned memories influence on our president in congress
[02:59:08.920 --> 02:59:13.560]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:13.560 --> 02:59:18.040]  as american citizens to pay attention fall of the republic identifies the
[02:59:18.040 --> 02:59:21.480]  enemies of our nation the criminal off-short cartel
[02:59:21.480 --> 02:59:25.640]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[02:59:25.640 --> 02:59:28.440]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[02:59:28.440 --> 02:59:31.800]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the
[02:59:31.800 --> 02:59:34.600]  checkout to? today seems like nobody does care
[02:59:34.600 --> 02:59:38.040]  and right now in washington dc we have seen
[02:59:38.040 --> 02:59:41.880]  a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic
[02:59:41.880 --> 02:59:46.520]  on dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now

[02:59:57.640 --> 03:00:13.560]  broadcasting network network
[03:00:27.800 --> 03:00:35.720]  okay we are now into hour number four overdrive at
[03:00:35.720 --> 03:00:39.160]  prisonplanet.tv and the free audio internet streams only
[03:00:39.160 --> 03:00:43.320]  at info wars dot com this will of course be archived at prisonplanet.tv and
[03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:47.160]  then uh repost it up to the alex jones channel on youtube while that channel
[03:00:47.160 --> 03:00:50.360]  still exists youtube is openly trying to shut it down
[03:00:50.360 --> 03:00:54.520]  uh as we speak uh and claim that criticizing obama in any way
[03:00:54.520 --> 03:00:58.440]  is now considered racism and tried to shut the channel down last month until we
[03:00:58.440 --> 03:01:02.040]  filed and challenged that so we're more and more being forced to move completely
[03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:07.400]  to prisonplanet.tv okay um in other news we've got
[03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:10.840]  paul watson joining us in a few minutes with webster tarpoli i want to jam in a
[03:01:10.840 --> 03:01:14.680]  few of your calls they're using this whole fracas
[03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:18.680]  over the debt limit because if we don't raise the debt limit it's catastrophe
[03:01:18.680 --> 03:01:21.720]  if we do raise it it's rack and ruin as ron paul has said
[03:01:21.720 --> 03:01:24.120]  because they're not going to put in the reforms that fix things
[03:01:24.120 --> 03:01:26.920]  they're going to continue to give everything to the foreign banks
[03:01:26.920 --> 03:01:29.880]  continue to strip social security and everything else
[03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:33.800]  while they raise taxes it all goes the foreign banks
[03:01:33.800 --> 03:01:37.240]  and so we'll go bankrupt completely that way and then if they don't do the debt
[03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:40.680]  ceiling then there'll be a huge default the treasuries will be killed and it's
[03:01:40.680 --> 03:01:44.760]  another disaster uh so it's just absolutely
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:48.200]  horrible but there's an article out of the hofigan post super congress debt
[03:01:48.200 --> 03:01:52.520]  ceiling negotiations aimed to create new legislative body
[03:01:52.520 --> 03:01:56.200]  and they go on to say it's not in the constitution but that the group will be
[03:01:56.200 --> 03:02:00.840]  given extraordinary powers by the president and by
[03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:07.080]  speaker bainer uh mcconnell uh and of course read the super congress
[03:02:07.080 --> 03:02:10.360]  composed of members of the both chambers and parties isn't mentioned
[03:02:10.360 --> 03:02:13.560]  anywhere in the constitution that will be granted extraordinary new powers under
[03:02:13.560 --> 03:02:18.600]  a plan put forth by senate minority leader mitch mcconnell
[03:02:18.600 --> 03:02:22.200]  and his counterpart majority leader harry reid uh surprise surprise they want
[03:02:22.200 --> 03:02:25.480]  a power grab and i got to say tirefully we're going to come back after the break
[03:02:25.480 --> 03:02:30.520]  with watson and in yourself and recap this this this false flag in europe
[03:02:30.520 --> 03:02:34.280]  and why it's important and and and your evidence that you know of what gladio
[03:02:34.280 --> 03:02:37.800]  was and this is a continuation of that because i want you to define it i want
[03:02:37.800 --> 03:02:41.960]  to get to fight with you but i heard your show saturday or part of it
[03:02:41.960 --> 03:02:45.720]  when i was in the car listening to local radio and uh you know i heard you saying
[03:02:45.720 --> 03:02:50.840]  let's use the 14th amendment well that was an interpretation by ulysses s grant
[03:02:50.840 --> 03:02:55.000]  during reconstruction uh and is the president saying
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:58.840]  that this isn't even against the states this is the president with the congress
[03:02:58.840 --> 03:03:01.400]  and you're saying well if they won't raise the debt ceiling well they're
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:05.560]  they're calling for cuts so regardless if you agree with those cuts or not
[03:03:05.560 --> 03:03:10.680]  under the constitution it is the congress's right uh to you know to
[03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:14.040]  control the issuance of currency credit and monetary policy
[03:03:14.040 --> 03:03:17.400]  and so i don't i i disagree with you that the president can engage in
[03:03:17.400 --> 03:03:21.800]  dictatorial activity well i think you have to realize that they
[03:03:21.800 --> 03:03:26.600]  a default by the united states is a catastrophic event it is a worldwide
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:30.280]  economic and financial cataclysm and that part is not
[03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:34.280]  made up it is real we are in a real world economic depression
[03:03:34.280 --> 03:03:37.800]  uh with the real uh dangers of the most
[03:03:37.800 --> 03:03:43.800]  serious kind you can see that once if the united states were to default on
[03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:48.600]  payment on these treasury bonds this is simply the bedrock of the entire
[03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:52.040]  world's financial system every place in the world depends on these
[03:03:52.040 --> 03:03:56.280]  whether directly no i know they're maneuvering us towards that by design
[03:03:56.280 --> 03:04:00.200]  they're just getting us deeper in debt before they do it we're dead already
[03:04:00.200 --> 03:04:05.800]  well we know it's possible but i think that's a it's a stretch to
[03:04:05.800 --> 03:04:10.120]  analyze these these conflicts these are real conflicts about real
[03:04:10.120 --> 03:04:14.120]  economic uh survival and i think it first of all it's
[03:04:14.120 --> 03:04:18.040]  it's wrong to say that the that the default is not a cataclysm event
[03:04:18.040 --> 03:04:23.160]  it will simply devalue all the existing central bank reserves of the world that
[03:04:23.160 --> 03:04:27.320]  are held in dollars which still remains the the overwhelming majority
[03:04:27.320 --> 03:04:30.040]  that will cause a worldwide panic it'll bring down
[03:04:30.040 --> 03:04:33.160]  all of these central banks now you could say well we don't like central banks
[03:04:33.160 --> 03:04:37.320]  anyway the problem is nobody's ready to with an
[03:04:37.320 --> 03:04:40.360]  alternative i have an alternative a five point program
[03:04:40.360 --> 03:04:44.360]  at the top of my website no no i know about your plan
[03:04:44.360 --> 03:04:47.000]  moving around those points and we don't have it
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:51.560]  so therefore we're left with total chaos i would say let's avoid the chaos
[03:04:51.560 --> 03:04:55.400]  we need more time to organize i wish they were listening
[03:04:55.400 --> 03:04:58.440]  we gotta go to break i wish they were listening to you but the point is
[03:04:58.440 --> 03:05:02.600]  they're not so there's a man named dr wallach
[03:05:02.600 --> 03:05:06.360]  who is anything but your typical doctor both a veterinary and a naturopathic
[03:05:06.360 --> 03:05:09.480]  physician doc asks why does the united states
[03:05:09.480 --> 03:05:13.800]  spend more money on health care by far and still rank 50th in health and
[03:05:13.800 --> 03:05:16.520]  longevity worldwide he believes that people should
[03:05:16.520 --> 03:05:19.960]  empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition
[03:05:19.960 --> 03:05:23.800]  taking charge of their life and attain optimal health and longevity
[03:05:23.800 --> 03:05:26.840]  through nutrition not by toxic prescription drugs
[03:05:26.840 --> 03:05:30.120]  leading to side effects this is clearly a deadly recipe
[03:05:30.120 --> 03:05:33.880]  the good news is doc wallach's message is resonating with an increasing number
[03:05:33.880 --> 03:05:37.320]  of americans who are waking up to all the big government and big pharma
[03:05:37.320 --> 03:05:41.320]  manipulation of our health care system i like what doc wallach is saying and
[03:05:41.320 --> 03:05:45.240]  doing to enlighten people about health care and have joined forces to help this

[03:08:25.240 --> 03:08:30.600]  well that's been what the whole six year staged wars been about according to
[03:08:30.600 --> 03:08:35.320]  our sources like selling castile so we're going to be
[03:08:35.320 --> 03:08:38.920]  going over that obviously a lot more tomorrow but i've spent a lot of time
[03:08:38.920 --> 03:08:41.720]  on this shooter we're going to go to a few your calls coming up here in a few
[03:08:41.720 --> 03:08:46.440]  minutes i spent a lot of time on this because i saw the branding i saw the
[03:08:46.440 --> 03:08:50.360]  pre-hype just like i saw it before 9 11
[03:08:50.360 --> 03:08:54.440]  you'd have to be blind they get you ready for this they prep it it's all done
[03:08:54.440 --> 03:08:59.080]  in a fifth grade level and they are trying to
[03:08:59.080 --> 03:09:03.800]  foment a clash of western and eastern civilization
[03:09:03.800 --> 03:09:08.520]  islam and christened them regardless of what you think about those two sides
[03:09:08.520 --> 03:09:12.600]  this is what's going on this is the stated peanut
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:16.120]  and israeli plan and even the jerusalem post
[03:09:16.120 --> 03:09:19.560]  admits that there is a major connection here
[03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:25.560]  this guy was a very pro-zionist guy and so some of our media is trying to claim
[03:09:25.560 --> 03:09:28.760]  nazi and things like this and calling him a neo-nazi
[03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:32.360]  there's zero evidence of that also there's not a lot of evidence that he was
[03:09:32.360 --> 03:09:36.120]  a quote right winger you know they're calling him a right wing zionist but
[03:09:36.120 --> 03:09:40.200]  he was you know for gays and things like that
[03:09:40.200 --> 03:09:44.440]  it just sounds like a cutout where they can put whatever label they want on
[03:09:44.440 --> 03:09:47.000]  anybody i had of all these new wars and things
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:50.040]  they're trying to do who does this serve webster i'm going to paul
[03:09:50.040 --> 03:09:53.160]  watson with you i've won't join us via video skype
[03:09:53.160 --> 03:09:56.440]  i mean we know that the cia was infiltrating their police a year ago
[03:09:56.440 --> 03:09:59.400]  that's confirmed we know there were drills we know there was a second
[03:09:59.400 --> 03:10:01.960]  shooter with multiple witnesses saying dark air
[03:10:01.960 --> 03:10:05.720]  nordic features uh shooting people the cops don't want to talk about that
[03:10:05.720 --> 03:10:10.440]  though it's even on cnn uh we've got this ledger that he did obviously didn't
[03:10:10.440 --> 03:10:14.120]  write uh we've got his facebook being changed after he was arrested to say
[03:10:14.120 --> 03:10:18.200]  conservative in christian i mean this this really looks like a way
[03:10:18.200 --> 03:10:22.920]  to get the left behind the war on terror the left behind the police state
[03:10:22.920 --> 03:10:25.480]  because people aren't going along with the muslim
[03:10:25.480 --> 03:10:29.160]  fear mongering anymore webster well i think again
[03:10:29.160 --> 03:10:33.800]  we have to realize that his entire ideological profile is a complete fake in
[03:10:33.800 --> 03:10:39.320]  other words it's it's a crazy quilt of contradictory elements thrown together
[03:10:39.320 --> 03:10:43.080]  and probably changing like changing from from day to day
[03:10:43.080 --> 03:10:47.400]  according to the needs of demagogy manipulation and so forth all of these
[03:10:47.400 --> 03:10:50.360]  things are designed to play on people's psychological
[03:10:50.360 --> 03:10:55.000]  weaknesses hatreds resentment envies class
[03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:59.240]  fear religious fear sexual fear god knows what else
[03:10:59.240 --> 03:11:02.200]  goes into this get us fighting with each other
[03:11:02.200 --> 03:11:05.800]  um so we don't fight with the establishment what about the pro palestinian
[03:11:05.800 --> 03:11:10.920]  rally there the day before what about the fact that in this manifesto
[03:11:10.920 --> 03:11:13.960]  he loves what israel's doing but again we don't even know if he really
[03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:17.640]  wrote this again i would assume that he didn't write that some of this is lifted
[03:11:17.640 --> 03:11:20.600]  from the unabomber and some of this is some little gray
[03:11:20.600 --> 03:11:24.600]  bureaucrat there in nato in brussels and more
[03:11:24.600 --> 03:11:28.120]  right m o a no but why would the establishment then
[03:11:28.120 --> 03:11:32.360]  well why first finger israel precisely because this this is an issue with
[03:11:32.360 --> 03:11:35.880]  norway norway is traditionally a pro arab
[03:11:35.880 --> 03:11:39.960]  country in nato it's it's a it's a it's an exception to the rule
[03:11:39.960 --> 03:11:44.120]  nate it was norway after all that sponsored the the oslo peace talks right
[03:11:44.120 --> 03:11:49.480]  between rabbin of the of the israelis and arafat of the palestinians that was in
[03:11:49.480 --> 03:11:53.800]  1994 that led to the signing of the oslo accords on the white house lawn
[03:11:53.800 --> 03:11:56.920]  with with uh with clinton and and arafat and
[03:11:56.920 --> 03:12:00.760]  and rabbin now that caused of course a backlash in the
[03:12:00.760 --> 03:12:04.280]  reactionary israeli circles leading to the killing of rabbin
[03:12:04.280 --> 03:12:08.120]  but this is the traditional policy that they have now
[03:12:08.120 --> 03:12:11.400]  as we're heading towards the united nations general assembly
[03:12:11.400 --> 03:12:14.760]  in september there's going to be a resolution to actually create
[03:12:14.760 --> 03:12:18.600]  a palestinian state through the u n general assembly in the same way that
[03:12:18.600 --> 03:12:22.760]  israel was created by the general assembly not by the security council
[03:12:22.760 --> 03:12:27.000]  back in 1948 and the norwegians have announced that they will vote for that
[03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:31.240]  and they will also recognize that government when it exists so this
[03:12:31.240 --> 03:12:35.480]  obviously opens up a conflict not just with the israelis but also with
[03:12:35.480 --> 03:12:39.800]  illyria clinton the state department and and uh and the u.s in general but also
[03:12:39.800 --> 03:12:43.800]  maybe with the uh the nato people and the and the brussels
[03:12:43.800 --> 03:12:48.120]  commission however i think the big thing the thing that's new because this what
[03:12:48.120 --> 03:12:52.920]  we've seen so far is traditional and although it's important the thing that's
[03:12:52.920 --> 03:12:57.720]  new that is very concrete is that norway had been providing 10 percent of the
[03:12:57.720 --> 03:13:02.600]  bombing effort over libya with six planes and now as we move towards
[03:13:02.600 --> 03:13:06.440]  august 1st those six planes will be pulled out they're already down to four
[03:13:06.440 --> 03:13:09.320]  you talked about this last night it's a political message
[03:13:09.320 --> 03:13:12.600]  to the ruling class we can kill you whenever we want
[03:13:12.600 --> 03:13:16.280]  with patsies that'll then take the fall webster i want to bring in the message
[03:13:16.280 --> 03:13:19.160]  let me just add it's a message to the netherlands to italy to
[03:13:19.160 --> 03:13:23.080]  canada to germany to to all sorts of people watch out
[03:13:23.080 --> 03:13:27.800]  we this creek in in the cia and nato and mi6
[03:13:27.800 --> 03:13:31.880]  we're we want to continue bombing libya don't you dare
[03:13:31.880 --> 03:13:36.680]  uh sabotage our effort absolutely now now i want to go to paul watson and then
[03:13:36.680 --> 03:13:40.200]  decals uh with you writing shotgun webster but finishing up at the end of
[03:13:40.200 --> 03:13:42.360]  the last hour you got caught off by the break
[03:13:42.360 --> 03:13:46.200]  you were saying that l l m and sir the northwood's mastermind
[03:13:46.200 --> 03:13:50.840]  gets basically you know kicked out by kennedy he goes after kennedy's killed
[03:13:50.840 --> 03:13:54.680]  to be the head of nato and it's on record in what german and italian
[03:13:54.680 --> 03:13:58.120]  investigations their parliament has had their former intelligence chief and
[03:13:58.120 --> 03:14:01.800]  former president come out and admit it that that they set up they stay behind
[03:14:01.800 --> 03:14:05.320]  armed networks of the soviets or to ever overrun europe that
[03:14:05.320 --> 03:14:11.880]  they're already secret cells with weapons uh to to to to uh wage a
[03:14:11.880 --> 03:14:16.520]  wolverine red dawn uh counter and you know uh well
[03:14:16.520 --> 03:14:20.680]  insurgency operation against the invasion now
[03:14:20.680 --> 03:14:24.200]  what they then did was every time a political party got a little uppity
[03:14:24.200 --> 03:14:27.720]  left-wing right-wing didn't matter communist whatever got too uppity and
[03:14:27.720 --> 03:14:30.760]  the system didn't like them they would just blow up a school bus blow up a
[03:14:30.760 --> 03:14:34.280]  train and blame on their political enemies that's been confirmed
[03:14:34.280 --> 03:14:38.440]  so any final comments on on the parallels here to gladio
[03:14:38.440 --> 03:14:42.360]  well the gladio of course you can look this up in that daniele ganzer's book
[03:14:42.360 --> 03:14:45.720]  nato's secret armies i mean there are lots of sort of mainstream
[03:14:45.720 --> 03:14:49.640]  academic um works that that go into this at least to some extent
[03:14:49.640 --> 03:14:53.640]  what happened was that the people who were recruited as the staff the the
[03:14:53.640 --> 03:14:58.120]  guerrilla fighters that were organized around these large deposits of weapons
[03:14:58.120 --> 03:15:03.080]  explosives and other such tools these were largely fascists a lot of them
[03:15:03.080 --> 03:15:07.960]  were old nazis old fascists and so forth and they then uh with
[03:15:07.960 --> 03:15:13.000]  nato intelligence backing them up began to carry out terrorism
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:17.320]  by about the middle of the 1960s and then increasingly in the years after
[03:15:17.320 --> 03:15:20.600]  that and this then became a kind of infrastructure
[03:15:20.600 --> 03:15:23.720]  of nato sponsored terrorism and there's never been
[03:15:23.720 --> 03:15:29.480]  an accounting for this so if you look at this guy private with his crazy
[03:15:29.480 --> 03:15:35.480]  synthetic etiology this could be somebody in that that tradition well
[03:15:35.480 --> 03:15:39.640]  he fits it on a percent he got nato infiltrating the police the year before
[03:15:39.640 --> 03:15:43.880]  and the media freaking out and i mean if you go back here webster
[03:15:43.880 --> 03:15:49.080]  this fits in just absolutely uh you know precisely even curtain demo the week
[03:15:49.080 --> 03:15:51.880]  before last wrote an article saying
[03:15:51.880 --> 03:15:56.440]  you know will nato uh i forgot the exact headline let's pull it up for
[03:15:56.440 --> 03:15:59.320]  prison planet dot tv viewers i think it was uh
[03:15:59.320 --> 03:16:05.960]  will nato play the uh gladio card uh that was the headline curtain demo even
[03:16:05.960 --> 03:16:10.760]  saw it coming and in effect they did remember uh the 22nd or 23rd of
[03:16:10.760 --> 03:16:15.720]  june at the opening of those women the women's uh
[03:16:15.720 --> 03:16:19.320]  the women's world soccer championship hello
[03:16:19.320 --> 03:16:23.320]  yes well i'm sorry we just had a uh a thunder clap here
[03:16:23.320 --> 03:16:26.760]  uh the women's world soccer championship there was a german attorney
[03:16:26.760 --> 03:16:30.120]  by the name of g e as she was worried about a stage
[03:16:30.120 --> 03:16:33.160]  terror that was the month before the ability of nuclear terrorism so it
[03:16:33.160 --> 03:16:36.280]  didn't happen in germany then it happened just about exactly one month
[03:16:36.280 --> 03:16:39.720]  later in the nozzle so we were all on high alert for this
[03:16:39.720 --> 03:16:43.880]  and now it comes along and to say this is the unicorn or this is authentic i
[03:16:43.880 --> 03:16:47.320]  think that's just absurd all right let's bring paul watson up with
[03:16:47.320 --> 03:16:51.240]  webster uh briefly uh and then with any new research
[03:16:51.240 --> 03:16:55.960]  points or data he has he'll spring paul watson up via video connection uh
[03:16:55.960 --> 03:16:59.960]  from uh the united kingdom and then go to a few phone calls paul
[03:16:59.960 --> 03:17:03.720]  i think uh where webster is going with this report last november
[03:17:03.720 --> 03:17:07.640]  about nato and cia infiltrating the police department in oslo
[03:17:07.640 --> 03:17:12.600]  and recruiting former police the drills i mean clearly this is an operation
[03:17:12.600 --> 03:17:16.120]  gladio uh kickstart uh they've
[03:17:16.120 --> 03:17:20.440]  reignited this it's it's very clear and you've got the whole israeli
[03:17:20.440 --> 03:17:24.680]  connection into this attacking this palestinian youth camp
[03:17:24.680 --> 03:17:28.840]  similar to the zionist that went to the dome of the rock what a decade ago and
[03:17:28.840 --> 03:17:33.560]  shot you know close to a hundred people uh we've got a look in that area but
[03:17:33.560 --> 03:17:36.120]  then at the same time and there's curtain
[03:17:36.120 --> 03:17:39.320]  this article from week and a half ago will nato a resurrect operation gladio
[03:17:39.320 --> 03:17:43.160]  to frame qaddafi well know it's to frame the right wing paul what's your
[03:17:43.160 --> 03:17:46.840]  view on all this from your research
[03:17:46.840 --> 03:17:49.880]  well it seems that at the bare minimum alex
[03:17:49.880 --> 03:17:52.680]  they knew about this guy they'd tracked him before
[03:17:52.680 --> 03:17:58.280]  norwegian mi5 had massacre suspect on list and it turns out that back in
[03:17:58.280 --> 03:18:01.320]  march he had been uh included in a
[03:18:01.320 --> 03:18:04.920]  intelligence database because he bought an amount of
[03:18:04.920 --> 03:18:09.000]  chemicals off a uh polish individual on the internet and so
[03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:12.360]  straight after that they put him in the database as a potential
[03:18:12.360 --> 03:18:16.840]  terrorist and then of course we had the report from channel four news which
[03:18:16.840 --> 03:18:20.760]  came out on friday where before the police
[03:18:20.760 --> 03:18:24.680]  even confronted him they knew his name they shouted his name out as soon as
[03:18:24.680 --> 03:18:28.440]  they got to the island even though it took them 90 minutes to get there
[03:18:28.440 --> 03:18:31.880]  and as soon as they shouted his name out he dropped his weapons
[03:18:31.880 --> 03:18:37.080]  and came quietly so all this stuff about the incompetence of the norwegian
[03:18:37.080 --> 03:18:41.880]  police doesn't quite jive with the fact that they knew his identity beforehand
[03:18:41.880 --> 03:18:45.800]  they had him in this database for the past seven months
[03:18:45.800 --> 03:18:51.240]  and some new research which is just now coming to the fore is the fact that
[03:18:51.240 --> 03:18:55.720]  in 2006 obviously according to his manifesto you know he's been planning
[03:18:55.720 --> 03:18:59.640]  this for years and his financial records actually
[03:18:59.640 --> 03:19:04.440]  appear on the internet um as norwegian citizens do for the
[03:19:04.440 --> 03:19:08.200]  past well the the most recent year is 2009
[03:19:08.200 --> 03:19:11.880]  and in 2006 he goes from basically having a
[03:19:11.880 --> 03:19:16.200]  not even a hundred dollars in his bank account to 2007
[03:19:16.200 --> 03:19:23.320]  where he's got 631,000 krona which amounts to about 116,000
[03:19:23.320 --> 03:19:28.360]  dollars in his bank account so you know how how did he get that
[03:19:28.360 --> 03:19:31.960]  money who gave him that money where did he get it from
[03:19:31.960 --> 03:19:36.200]  and from then on he starts to spend the money he starts to plan this operation
[03:19:36.200 --> 03:19:39.480]  and we know that they had him in the database since at least march
[03:19:39.480 --> 03:19:45.320]  well he may just be a person who believes he's doing a good thing and
[03:19:45.320 --> 03:19:48.600]  is unstable but but a high-level functioning
[03:19:48.600 --> 03:19:53.080]  psychopath uh i guess what you call a moral psychopath of such a thing exist
[03:19:53.080 --> 03:19:57.080]  the point is uh is that then they handle him they
[03:19:57.080 --> 03:20:00.840]  provocateur him like mcvey to play a limited role
[03:20:00.840 --> 03:20:05.000]  and then all their people are pulled out and protected following the classic
[03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:08.360]  paradigm that they've perfected with these uh false flag
[03:20:08.360 --> 03:20:13.480]  patsy setups and then now he's more than happy as an ego maniac
[03:20:13.480 --> 03:20:18.040]  to uh to take all the credit and to say don't worry my other cells
[03:20:18.040 --> 03:20:22.520]  are about to attack and indeed they are because it's nato running the
[03:20:22.520 --> 03:20:25.720]  norwegian police with british intelligence
[03:20:25.720 --> 03:20:29.000]  clearly involved he's in england getting his walking orders
[03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:32.120]  with a group people that call themselves the knights template i know
[03:20:32.120 --> 03:20:35.640]  there's a group that does indeed meet and promote this we even saw that in
[03:20:35.640 --> 03:20:41.000]  that sky television show that demonize yours truly paul watson
[03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:45.480]  well yeah of course we know somebody else who started obsessing and talking
[03:20:45.480 --> 03:20:49.400]  about the knights template and the freemasons and that was of course
[03:20:49.400 --> 03:20:53.320]  mr shaylor the former mi5 agent who suddenly started
[03:20:53.320 --> 03:20:57.720]  dressing like a woman and calling himself jesus and then you also have
[03:20:57.720 --> 03:21:03.240]  um this this individual in norway bravik who was tied into the
[03:21:03.240 --> 03:21:07.320]  english defense league he went and visited them in 2002
[03:21:07.320 --> 03:21:11.800]  and that the english defense league basically has played off against
[03:21:11.800 --> 03:21:17.160]  militant muslims in britain routinely to foster this clash of civilizations and
[03:21:17.160 --> 03:21:21.800]  it's it's a pathetic group made up of former drunk football hooligans
[03:21:21.800 --> 03:21:25.400]  completely infiltrated by mi5 just as the
[03:21:25.400 --> 03:21:30.040]  neo-nazis are also infiltrated by mi5 not infiltrated it's come out in
[03:21:30.040 --> 03:21:33.960]  germany and england that the nazi groups are founded and run by the
[03:21:33.960 --> 03:21:38.920]  government but i mean this edl is so pathetic that
[03:21:38.920 --> 03:21:42.360]  they splash it all over the newspapers every time they want to get
[03:21:42.360 --> 03:21:47.880]  get as each other's throat so here's bravik going to visit them in 2002
[03:21:47.880 --> 03:21:52.680]  in 2007 he suddenly finds a hundred and sixteen thousand dollars in his account
[03:21:52.680 --> 03:21:56.920]  he's later put on a terrorism database and the police know his name before they
[03:21:56.920 --> 03:22:00.280]  even get to the island and now we're hearing that domestic groups all over
[03:22:00.280 --> 03:22:03.880]  the world from england to the u.s to the continent of europe have to be watched
[03:22:03.880 --> 03:22:06.760]  if you're talking about about globalism or open borders
[03:22:06.760 --> 03:22:11.560]  you're bad now i mean this is perfect branding and paul did we not call it
[03:22:11.560 --> 03:22:15.640]  with the crescendo of white al qaeda leading up to this i mean
[03:22:15.640 --> 03:22:18.440]  what do you think about what pat shenick was saying earlier that he thinks this
[03:22:18.440 --> 03:22:22.680]  is real well it's it's really it could be real in
[03:22:22.680 --> 03:22:25.240]  the sense that this individual thought he was doing
[03:22:25.240 --> 03:22:28.360]  what he was doing for his own cause which is outlined but i mean that's
[03:22:28.360 --> 03:22:32.280]  exactly what timothy mcveigh thought but it turned out that he was a complete
[03:22:32.280 --> 03:22:36.440]  patsy you know uh there were there were more individuals involved in the plot
[03:22:36.440 --> 03:22:39.880]  than uh nickles came out later and said yeah we were we were
[03:22:39.880 --> 03:22:44.360]  provocative by the government so we've got exactly the same indicators in this
[03:22:44.360 --> 03:22:48.840]  and like you just said this is a christian science monitor
[03:22:48.840 --> 03:22:52.520]  norway massacre likely to ramp up monitoring of right
[03:22:52.520 --> 03:22:57.240]  wing groups and it says the sudden appearance of a murderous and crusading
[03:22:57.240 --> 03:23:02.200]  figure who sees himself as a martyr for judeo christian european civilization
[03:23:02.200 --> 03:23:06.280]  is expected to ramp up surveillance by intelligence agencies
[03:23:06.280 --> 03:23:09.480]  of a far right culture that has grown and flourished
[03:23:09.480 --> 03:23:12.760]  in the greenhouse of the internet well here's another one
[03:23:12.760 --> 03:23:16.600]  oh yeah it's all the internet allowed this him to be radicalized so we've got
[03:23:16.600 --> 03:23:20.760]  to censor the web right as youtube adds its report
[03:23:20.760 --> 03:23:24.920]  uh you know this this promotes terrorism link uh here it is
[03:23:24.920 --> 03:23:30.280]  killer personifies rise of the new right financial times of london uh christ
[03:23:30.280 --> 03:23:34.120]  matthew's tv show demonizing myself and ron paul rise of the new right
[03:23:34.120 --> 03:23:37.640]  we can so so the left the muslims they're all terrorist
[03:23:37.640 --> 03:23:41.320]  uh speak of the devil there's christ matthew's race baiting uh right there
[03:23:41.320 --> 03:23:44.280]  behind me you don't like government health care you're a racist
[03:23:44.280 --> 03:23:47.640]  i mean you can really see that this is engineered
[03:23:47.640 --> 03:23:51.880]  uh and continuing here uh webster tarpley this is scary
[03:23:51.880 --> 03:23:55.480]  i don't know if you're aware of it but we completely predicted thursday that
[03:23:55.480 --> 03:23:58.760]  a staged terror attack to be blamed on the right was imminent
[03:23:58.760 --> 03:24:02.360]  again why would the social engineers want to do this
[03:24:02.360 --> 03:24:06.600]  well again i would just say this this character bribing this is from central
[03:24:06.600 --> 03:24:10.280]  casting in other words this is some kind of a Nordic
[03:24:10.280 --> 03:24:14.680]  uh the hero for for people who want to take this stuff seriously
[03:24:14.680 --> 03:24:19.960]  it is it is artificial fake hoaxed up uh from beginning to end i don't see
[03:24:19.960 --> 03:24:24.120]  anything authentic in this person you know this this could be an example of
[03:24:24.120 --> 03:24:27.800]  clockwork orange brainwashing we just don't know what these what these
[03:24:27.800 --> 03:24:31.560]  capabilities are the part of it is at the at the level of the
[03:24:31.560 --> 03:24:35.880]  elites it basically says when the orders come down from the u.s and the
[03:24:35.880 --> 03:24:40.520]  british from nato intelligence you obey otherwise
[03:24:40.520 --> 03:24:44.920]  you're going to have your office bombed and you're going to have this uh camp
[03:24:44.920 --> 03:24:48.600]  we have to figure that some of the children of high officials in the
[03:24:48.600 --> 03:24:52.040]  government were attending that camp in other words this could not be more
[03:24:52.040 --> 03:24:57.000]  political focused on the policy it's a message you do what we say or your
[03:24:57.000 --> 03:24:59.880]  kids are dead absolutely may we we know what you
[03:24:59.880 --> 03:25:02.600]  we know your schedule we know where your children are
[03:25:02.600 --> 03:25:07.320]  so it's it's completely political in other words it's got everything to do
[03:25:07.320 --> 03:25:11.240]  and that's so i don't think much at all to do with this internal stuff about
[03:25:11.240 --> 03:25:14.760]  is the assimilation of moslems and the end these issues it's got to do with the
[03:25:14.760 --> 03:25:18.280]  foreign policy a pro-arabic foreign policy in general
[03:25:18.280 --> 03:25:21.880]  friendly to the palestinians but most immediately
[03:25:21.880 --> 03:25:26.280]  that the example of norway is leading to the collapse of the nato attack
[03:25:26.280 --> 03:25:30.120]  coalition on libya and that would be a debacle
[03:25:30.120 --> 03:25:33.320]  uh you can see but it has the double goody though
[03:25:33.320 --> 03:25:36.840]  because the systems that run this country and in europe
[03:25:36.840 --> 03:25:40.520]  also do want to go after nationalist and that's a built-in thing and when
[03:25:40.520 --> 03:25:44.840]  when for example we find that this patsy the psychotic patsy writes about
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:48.600]  uh should i use weapons of mass destruction references like that can be
[03:25:48.600 --> 03:25:52.200]  used then by lobby and he dresses up in wd
[03:25:52.200 --> 03:25:58.840]  wmd outfits to help further the fear all of it 100 percent scripted for maximum
[03:25:58.840 --> 03:26:02.760]  effect and and he admits i'm not acting alone i'm part of a
[03:26:02.760 --> 03:26:06.600]  knighthood they just got this easily controlled person
[03:26:06.600 --> 03:26:11.240]  in there who thinks he's doing a great job i'm sure like mcvey they told him
[03:26:11.240 --> 03:26:14.360]  this is us army we're going to do this to you know
[03:26:14.360 --> 03:26:17.240]  fight the corruption in government they'll carry out the attack and then
[03:26:17.240 --> 03:26:20.440]  later he found he was set up they said we'll kill your family if you don't go
[03:26:20.440 --> 03:26:24.280]  along with this that's come out even in government documents so
[03:26:24.280 --> 03:26:28.600]  yeah i mean i don't know how well i'm gonna have him back up maybe the two of
[03:26:28.600 --> 03:26:31.400]  you together i mean you know you know pacenic
[03:26:31.400 --> 03:26:34.440]  comes out and says the bin laden thing's fake clearly it is
[03:26:34.440 --> 03:26:39.320]  nine eleven's fake uh you know he he he does a lot of things like that
[03:26:39.320 --> 03:26:42.200]  and then you all and pacenic i need to get him back on because he never wants
[03:26:42.200 --> 03:26:45.080]  to talk about it the london telegraph and reportedly
[03:26:45.080 --> 03:26:48.600]  uh the event with the red brigades grabbing the italian president and
[03:26:48.600 --> 03:26:51.720]  pacenic says he put out the report according to the telegraph that
[03:26:51.720 --> 03:26:55.640]  that uh that they'd already killed him so then they did kill him
[03:26:55.640 --> 03:26:58.840]  uh i mean i've got to get his his views on this
[03:26:58.840 --> 03:27:01.880]  we just had one other thing based on what i've heard from his appearances on
[03:27:01.880 --> 03:27:06.120]  your program he seems to be saying civilians are bad
[03:27:06.120 --> 03:27:11.800]  military is good and in the world of the military general patreus is really
[03:27:11.800 --> 03:27:16.760]  really good patreus obviously a favorite presidential
[03:27:16.760 --> 03:27:20.760]  candidate of the neocons uh in the wings right a stealth
[03:27:20.760 --> 03:27:25.000]  candidate uniting the pentagon now and the cia
[03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:29.400]  that would be bonapartism with a vengeance in other words a couple a man on
[03:27:29.400 --> 03:27:33.320]  horseback not mucking around in the primaries and not caring about the
[03:27:33.320 --> 03:27:37.160]  iowa straw pole but riding in on a horse in an atmosphere of
[03:27:37.160 --> 03:27:41.160]  breakdown and chaos as we now seem to have it i think that's
[03:27:41.160 --> 03:27:45.480]  that is probably the most dangerous alternative for the united states i
[03:27:45.480 --> 03:27:47.800]  don't want to hear people talking about patreus
[03:27:47.800 --> 03:27:52.200]  for president or patreus is the man we can trust uh that i don't want to get
[03:27:52.200 --> 03:27:57.080]  into a a pacinic bashing festival what we'll do is
[03:27:57.080 --> 03:28:01.000]  how about i invite him to come on and give his political views and in the
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:05.400]  second half come in and have you ask questions if he'll do it
[03:28:05.400 --> 03:28:09.480]  well i guess if you if you want to try it sure why not i i think it'd be a nice
[03:28:09.480 --> 03:28:12.600]  debate yeah but why would you have a neocon come out
[03:28:12.600 --> 03:28:16.680]  i don't think he's a neocon far from it and and and talk about 911 being an
[03:28:16.680 --> 03:28:19.800]  inside job nine and a half years ago it's not like
[03:28:19.800 --> 03:28:24.040]  uh you know he just did this no i'm simply saying that patreus
[03:28:24.040 --> 03:28:26.760]  but people haven't maybe noticed it but patreus
[03:28:26.760 --> 03:28:31.240]  is the gathering point of most neocons although some of them are looking
[03:28:31.240 --> 03:28:33.720]  looking elsewhere all right let me do this webster
[03:28:33.720 --> 03:28:38.520]  i promise but i got to go on a rt at three so we got to get out of here
[03:28:38.520 --> 03:28:42.360]  soon as we can set up the video skype i promise to go to caller so
[03:28:42.360 --> 03:28:45.080]  we're just going to do part of the next segment and and finish with these
[03:28:45.080 --> 03:28:48.280]  callers uh watch them we got a minute before we go to break we're gonna come
[03:28:48.280 --> 03:28:52.040]  back and take four or five calls with tarpley and you here just very quick
[03:28:52.040 --> 03:28:54.200]  questions or comments but any other little
[03:28:54.200 --> 03:28:57.640]  caveats or tidbits as we go out to break
[03:28:57.640 --> 03:29:02.440]  wise the the fact that he went and targeted men predominantly
[03:29:02.440 --> 03:29:06.520]  young white norwegians i don't think that's something that can explain with
[03:29:06.520 --> 03:29:10.760]  these convoluted mental gymnastics why didn't he just go and blow up a mask
[03:29:10.760 --> 03:29:15.720]  there's one in the center of oslo if he's an anti-muslim extremist why
[03:29:15.720 --> 03:29:20.600]  kill young white people just doesn't make sense to me
[03:29:20.600 --> 03:29:25.400]  if i may also add he's a composite figure as i understand
[03:29:25.400 --> 03:29:30.600]  he's private but he's also he's got a blog apparently under the name
[03:29:30.600 --> 03:29:35.320]  fjord fan some people think that's him and he's known as andrew burwick when
[03:29:35.320 --> 03:29:39.800]  he puts his puts his uh screen up on the internet so
[03:29:39.800 --> 03:29:44.440]  a composite figure well he fits every one of the mos
[03:29:44.440 --> 03:29:48.840]  it's my gut tells me it's never wrong this is as phony as a three dollar bill
[03:29:48.840 --> 03:29:55.320]  we'll be right back stay with us on the march the empires on the run

[03:33:59.320 --> 03:34:02.600]  police state they've set up and sold the public it was just going to be for
[03:34:02.600 --> 03:34:07.800]  muslims it's going to be shifted on to the general public

[03:34:43.000 --> 03:34:46.920]  honor and a privilege it is to speak with both of you thank you for taking my
[03:34:46.920 --> 03:34:50.920]  call um webster kind of stole my thunder i was
[03:34:50.920 --> 03:34:54.760]  wondering myself you know what makes people think
[03:34:54.760 --> 03:34:59.560]  that this guy even wrote this manifesto that's what was on my mind
[03:34:59.560 --> 03:35:02.520]  well i mean they made all the fake wmd documents they just
[03:35:02.520 --> 03:35:06.600]  i mean all the time the associated press says al qaeda says they did this or did
[03:35:06.600 --> 03:35:09.560]  that and they'll say at the bottom of the article from a
[03:35:09.560 --> 03:35:15.880]  unconfirmed uh forum well you can go on forums and read that i am an 18 trillion
[03:35:15.880 --> 03:35:20.040]  year old reptoid lizard from pop tart who drinks blood
[03:35:20.040 --> 03:35:23.400]  and actually they're on to me it's true but you know the point is is that you
[03:35:23.400 --> 03:35:27.240]  know how do you prove that uh webster are you a reptoid
[03:35:27.240 --> 03:35:31.240]  we have some reports that tev kichinsky the unabomber is going to go after
[03:35:31.240 --> 03:35:34.200]  broadvick with a civil suit for plagiarism
[03:35:34.200 --> 03:35:39.320]  for violating his copyright on the unabomber manifesto
[03:35:39.320 --> 03:35:43.320]  webster you are you on to me that i'm a reptoid vatican assassin
[03:35:43.320 --> 03:35:47.640]  the word is out no it's like alex jones cia there's the proof
[03:35:47.640 --> 03:35:53.640]  no no but seriously i mean they can't even confirm this is his manifesto
[03:35:53.640 --> 03:35:58.120]  so it's not that i'm defending israel here you know that this guy you know isn't
[03:35:58.120 --> 03:36:01.720]  a zionist the point is how do we know any of it's true
[03:36:01.720 --> 03:36:05.240]  i mean most of it is not true in other words most of it is
[03:36:05.240 --> 03:36:09.480]  invented out of whole cloth or as close to that as it's physically
[03:36:09.480 --> 03:36:13.640]  possible to get uh and it will change and um
[03:36:13.640 --> 03:36:16.840]  what i'm waiting for is we always have these cases right
[03:36:16.840 --> 03:36:21.160]  oswald of course was a devoted communist except he was working for
[03:36:21.160 --> 03:36:25.800]  the cia operations directorate and the u.s customs and god knows what
[03:36:25.800 --> 03:36:29.880]  and when they sent him to the soviets uh and then to they tried to get him into
[03:36:29.880 --> 03:36:33.800]  cuba they wanted to sheep dip him to try to be able to pin me what he would
[03:36:33.800 --> 03:36:37.800]  later do on the soviets and that's a process that took quite a while right
[03:36:37.800 --> 03:36:41.240]  that took some years to get that ready uh atah
[03:36:41.240 --> 03:36:46.120]  was of course a pious muslim uh but in fact he was getting to his uh he would
[03:36:46.120 --> 03:36:48.920]  go to the discotheque he would drink all kinds of
[03:36:48.920 --> 03:36:53.240]  that's not that he had a hooker girlfriend so but that's not the
[03:36:53.240 --> 03:36:57.480]  the proof is atta was allowed into the us under his visa that he was really
[03:36:57.480 --> 03:37:01.400]  working for the cia he was working at us military bases
[03:37:01.400 --> 03:37:04.840]  their houses were going home he thought he was going to be an actor in a drill
[03:37:04.840 --> 03:37:08.520]  and then he'd be back in the discotheque in the evening
[03:37:08.520 --> 03:37:12.520]  but he found out that wasn't the case uh rene thank you so much for the comments
[03:37:12.520 --> 03:37:18.440]  erin in uh nevada you're on the year with uh watson and tarpley

[03:37:49.800 --> 03:37:53.640]  and it must happen now said the foreign minister to cheers
[03:37:53.640 --> 03:37:57.000]  from the audience the foreign minister uh Jonas
[03:37:57.000 --> 03:38:01.480]  gahar store so that's what this is all really about this is zionism and that
[03:38:01.480 --> 03:38:05.640]  pashenek discredited himself that was the biggest piece of cia
[03:38:05.640 --> 03:38:11.400]  this info one cia always cia and if he was really anti cia
[03:38:11.400 --> 03:38:15.400]  he would have had an accident by now all right that's all i have to say on that
[03:38:15.400 --> 03:38:19.800]  and i like to say overall though alex i agree with you on the knock-on effect
[03:38:19.800 --> 03:38:23.640]  taking the rights way and everything just to find it by this but please know
[03:38:23.640 --> 03:38:28.680]  this is all about uh zionism jewish supremacy
[03:38:28.680 --> 03:38:31.960]  Rothschild banking cartel that's the nexus of this thing
[03:38:31.960 --> 03:38:35.320]  in my opinion all right erin i appreciate your call we've got to move on to the
[03:38:35.320 --> 03:38:39.000]  other callers let me just say that is relevant up to a point but you the
[03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:43.640]  question is why now in other words the pro palestinian pro-arab
[03:38:43.640 --> 03:38:48.040]  orientation of the norwegian government goes back to 93 94
[03:38:48.040 --> 03:38:51.240]  now we are approaching this vote right there is a certain
[03:38:51.240 --> 03:38:55.480]  you know point of inflection coming up it seems to me though the big issue
[03:38:55.480 --> 03:38:58.840]  is the libyan bombing coalition uh because this is
[03:38:58.840 --> 03:39:03.480]  this is why would israel though carry this out and then cattle on themselves
[03:39:03.480 --> 03:39:09.320]  in the manifesto well i because i i think it's nato intelligence in the
[03:39:09.320 --> 03:39:13.480]  word i think that the israeli concerns are subsumed into into the policies of
[03:39:13.480 --> 03:39:17.400]  what what nato intelligence is doing and i think we've pretty well identified a
[03:39:17.400 --> 03:39:21.560]  network in the norwegian police which is basically set up by
[03:39:21.560 --> 03:39:25.800]  by the u.s and again if it's 10 percent of the bombing and it's leading to the
[03:39:25.800 --> 03:39:28.920]  collapse of the coalition this is this is an emergency
[03:39:28.920 --> 03:39:33.880]  no no you're right so it's not not based on ideology it's based on power
[03:39:33.880 --> 03:39:38.120]  and control and i think the the libya is the immediate focus it is a coup
[03:39:38.120 --> 03:39:41.720]  threat it is a coup demonstration it's like
[03:39:41.720 --> 03:39:46.520]  uh governor tarkin blowing up alderaan to scare the other space systems let me
[03:39:46.520 --> 03:39:49.240]  add that the other thing is wiki leaks right there with the ground had been
[03:39:49.240 --> 03:39:52.920]  prepared by wiki leaks in the sense that wiki leaks had put out a whole bunch
[03:39:52.920 --> 03:39:56.920]  of u.s diplomatic cables saying the norwegian government is incompetent
[03:39:56.920 --> 03:40:00.520]  they're in way over their heads they can't take terrorism seriously
[03:40:00.520 --> 03:40:04.440]  they don't understand what's going on well that's that's that's gates uh at
[03:40:04.440 --> 03:40:07.960]  at the uh well well well now he's left so we've got a
[03:40:07.960 --> 03:40:11.880]  a prefabricated ready made to order off the shelf reason
[03:40:11.880 --> 03:40:15.560]  just for you norwegian government you're incompetent you must fall
[03:40:15.560 --> 03:40:19.160]  because you were allowed in the wiki leaks there's even bomb making equipment
[03:40:19.160 --> 03:40:23.320]  was lost by the norwegian police under this government
[03:40:23.320 --> 03:40:27.080]  so they have a perfect way to say this government must fall
[03:40:27.080 --> 03:40:30.280]  because they have created the conditions they've infiltrated the police
[03:40:30.280 --> 03:40:34.120]  they've got the network set up a year ago they launched the attacks i have to
[03:40:34.120 --> 03:40:37.800]  totally agree with you paul watson any comments on this
[03:40:37.800 --> 03:40:41.800]  well i mean just study the behavior of this guy according to eyewitnesses he's
[03:40:41.800 --> 03:40:45.800]  walking around with this serene look on his face as he's massacring scores of
[03:40:45.800 --> 03:40:48.360]  young people the people who worked with him who
[03:40:48.360 --> 03:40:51.560]  knew him personally said they thought he was brainwashed
[03:40:51.560 --> 03:40:55.240]  and then you've got the fight that he lives on this farm which is right next
[03:40:55.240 --> 03:40:59.000]  to the elite military special forces complex in
[03:40:59.000 --> 03:41:02.520]  norway his father was in norwegian special forces
[03:41:02.520 --> 03:41:07.000]  and then you have the eyewitness reports which the media is largely ignored
[03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:10.760]  of gunshots being heard from two different parts of the island
[03:41:10.760 --> 03:41:15.480]  and quote a man with dark hair dark hair in civilian clothes
[03:41:15.480 --> 03:41:20.360]  being seen firing another weapon so classic serhan serhan style patsy
[03:41:20.360 --> 03:41:24.440]  with the brainwashing with the serene look on his face the calm demeanor
[03:41:24.440 --> 03:41:29.800]  i mean it all has a familiar echo to it watson good job we need a report going
[03:41:29.800 --> 03:41:33.160]  over that because people probably don't know that the la detectives
[03:41:33.160 --> 03:41:37.480]  said at the time serhan serhan had his hand pinned to the
[03:41:37.480 --> 03:41:41.320]  to the table none of the bullets hit kennedy kennedy was shot from behind
[03:41:41.320 --> 03:41:45.160]  repeatedly with the caliber we even know now who pulled the trigger
[03:41:45.160 --> 03:41:48.840]  three cia agents in the speech beforehand photographed
[03:41:48.840 --> 03:41:53.000]  this is all in the news people forget serhan serhan is now confirmed yes the
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:56.520]  woman in the dress i'd already been under mind control she gave me a drink
[03:41:56.520 --> 03:41:59.960]  of the halcyon chemicals put him in the trance
[03:41:59.960 --> 03:42:04.600]  i mean this is ridiculous and uh we now see the building of this
[03:42:04.600 --> 03:42:07.720]  guy up to this superman hoping that he will
[03:42:07.720 --> 03:42:14.920]  encourage real uh dislocated whites uh to now become violent
[03:42:14.920 --> 03:42:17.720]  instead of becoming political i mean this whole thing
[03:42:17.720 --> 03:42:20.600]  clash of civilizations then the government plays the part
[03:42:20.600 --> 03:42:25.240]  of the referee uh what's your take on that uh watson
[03:42:25.240 --> 03:42:29.480]  well certainly i mean i've read comments i've read numerous comments in
[03:42:29.480 --> 03:42:33.560]  support of his actions there are facebook fan pages that have already been
[03:42:33.560 --> 03:42:37.480]  set up in support of what he did so undoubtedly they're looking for copy
[03:42:37.480 --> 03:42:41.240]  cats uh and if they get them then it's going to destroy the whole
[03:42:41.240 --> 03:42:45.240]  wave of european conservatism that's been peeling back this
[03:42:45.240 --> 03:42:50.520]  e u s s r agenda um because the the conservators have been very successful
[03:42:50.520 --> 03:42:56.040]  in recent years i mean the true fin party and that again this is a psychic
[03:42:56.040 --> 03:42:59.640]  warhead i want you to finish your point this is a psychic
[03:42:59.640 --> 03:43:04.840]  warhead a poison dart fired in to nationalists who understand the global
[03:43:04.840 --> 03:43:08.840]  banking cartel the biggest the left is not opposing the new world order
[03:43:08.840 --> 03:43:11.640]  they're not opposing the anglo-american elite they're not opposing the roth
[03:43:11.640 --> 03:43:14.760]  childs and rocker fellers they're not talking about eugenics they love it
[03:43:14.760 --> 03:43:18.040]  it's only what you'll call populist right wing
[03:43:18.040 --> 03:43:21.480]  that is getting hispanics blacks Arabs everybody
[03:43:21.480 --> 03:43:25.640]  together that this show what we do
[03:43:25.640 --> 03:43:29.880]  common sense populism opposing the banksters is
[03:43:29.880 --> 03:43:34.120]  is is is the end of the new world order is cyanide to them
[03:43:34.120 --> 03:43:37.640]  and so they are going to infect our movements
[03:43:37.640 --> 03:43:41.480]  with racism and and and illuminati garbage
[03:43:41.480 --> 03:43:46.680]  and bombs and and killing so they can hammer the daylights out of us with the
[03:43:46.680 --> 03:43:50.280]  security services that are behind the terrorism there is no
[03:43:50.280 --> 03:43:53.880]  doubt about that paul finisher fin party article
[03:43:53.880 --> 03:43:58.520]  well i mean it's in cnn right now europe's resurgent far right focuses on
[03:43:58.520 --> 03:44:02.440]  immigration multiculturalism and the the lumping it all on the true
[03:44:02.440 --> 03:44:06.120]  fins they're lumping it on uh girt wilders the dutch
[03:44:06.120 --> 03:44:10.200]  politician who's been very successful he's party for freedom recently
[03:44:10.200 --> 03:44:13.960]  so yeah the the conservators in europe are having a lot of success and now
[03:44:13.960 --> 03:44:17.560]  they're all on the back foot because of the actions of this individual and the
[03:44:17.560 --> 03:44:20.200]  establishment in europe is going to push it just like
