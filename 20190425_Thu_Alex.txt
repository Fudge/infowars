[00:00.000 --> 00:26.040]  I think he's going to win in the last line, you know, to tell you the truth, because you
[00:26.040 --> 00:33.040]  know why here's what I predict, well, Alex Jones, you did the mind-melt, you were destroyed,
[00:33.040 --> 00:39.420]  you're still standing, there's only one Alex Jones, there's only one true twister
[00:39.420 --> 00:41.800]  from Texas, nobody can come close.
[00:41.800 --> 00:45.400]  So if I'd have taken that for free, how much would I have had to, $10,000?
[00:45.400 --> 00:46.400]  $50 million.
[00:46.400 --> 00:48.160]  Alex Jones was a $30 million, I said no.
[00:48.160 --> 00:52.480]  He took the risk, he became president, and now we should be applauding that, and the
[00:52.480 --> 00:57.480]  fact that he wasn't implicated in the Russian Github should be a point of admiration.
[00:57.480 --> 01:01.080]  What more can I do, Alex, what more can I do?
[01:01.080 --> 01:05.600]  Oh, Joe Biden, I think Joe Biden's in the house, oh, I feel him creeping up my spine.
[01:05.600 --> 01:09.560]  We've got Trump, too, he's right around the corner, we're ready to go, here in D.C.,
[01:09.560 --> 01:26.080]  Trump International, let's do it.
[01:26.080 --> 01:31.080]  It feels really good to be back in studio, the rest of the crew is on their way, but
[01:31.080 --> 01:36.000]  I wanted to let them sleep in, I got up at 3.30 a.m. and that's the airport, I'm here
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.520]  locked, cocked, and ready to rock.
[01:39.520 --> 01:45.080]  And I had so many incredible experiences in D.C. that even though it is a big evil swamp-like
[01:45.080 --> 01:49.880]  cesspit, there's still a lot of great people, there's a lot of great energy, and I just
[01:49.880 --> 01:54.640]  had nothing but an amazing, almost magical time while I was there.
[01:54.640 --> 02:00.440]  The planets aligned, a lot of synchronicity, serendipity took place, I'll be telling you
[02:00.440 --> 02:06.040]  about some here on the broadcast today, obviously, and we have the Big Mac's Kaiser interview
[02:06.040 --> 02:11.160]  I did with him, I ran into him at Trump Hotel, and it was the best interview I've ever done
[02:11.160 --> 02:12.160]  with him.
[02:12.160 --> 02:18.680]  It is jam-packed, super powerful, that's coming up in the third hour.
[02:18.680 --> 02:25.600]  We have large excerpts of it that are up on infowars.com and newswars.com right now,
[02:25.600 --> 02:30.360]  but the full interview on a whole host of issues will be airing.
[02:30.360 --> 02:34.640]  By the way, he wasn't the Soros connected guy, even though he knows Soros' son and did
[02:34.640 --> 02:40.920]  some trading with him on Wall Street that offered me the Bitcoin to join the dark side,
[02:40.920 --> 02:46.600]  but he got the heat for it while I mentioned that, but that's a separate time he offered
[02:46.600 --> 02:51.840]  me $150 million in Bitcoin back when it was worth a dollar apiece when it first came out.
[02:51.840 --> 02:56.000]  And quite frankly, I was just busy covering Bilderberg and didn't get it downloaded right
[02:56.000 --> 03:05.480]  on the laptop we had because I was too busy covering Bilderberg, but it's quite an exclusive
[03:05.480 --> 03:07.840]  story you're going to hear coming up in the third hour.
[03:07.840 --> 03:10.240]  Mellie Weaver is going to join us as well.
[03:10.240 --> 03:17.040]  She was in Charlottesville, and she saw the left with the police collide, the reporters
[03:17.040 --> 03:23.200]  and the white nationalist and the Democrats posing as white nationalists into each other
[03:23.200 --> 03:26.600]  to cause the conflagration that got the woman killed.
[03:26.600 --> 03:30.520]  And then when I said Soros funded it, the police stood down and got the woman killed,
[03:30.520 --> 03:38.840]  I was sued by the Georgetown Law Clinic and others saying that I said specifically that
[03:38.840 --> 03:44.480]  they physically, that some guy, I don't think I've ever even said his name, specifically,
[03:44.480 --> 03:46.440]  so they said their lawsuit killed this woman.
[03:46.440 --> 03:51.840]  No, I said Soros and the whole conflagration that happened and then the leftist professors
[03:51.840 --> 03:57.720]  and operatives there seized on the crisis and tried to brand Trump as a white supremacist
[03:57.720 --> 04:01.000]  by misquoting Trump saying the white supremacists were good people.
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.560]  No, he said there were good people on both sides, bad people on both sides.
[04:04.560 --> 04:08.320]  That means there was a left wing and right wing clash.
[04:08.320 --> 04:11.960]  There were all sorts of bystanders there and a lot of innocent people got attacked and
[04:11.960 --> 04:17.120]  Antifa started the whole thing and Antifa is a criminal organization.
[04:17.120 --> 04:25.920]  And of course, since then it's been federally listed as one, so it is all coming up today.
[04:25.920 --> 04:30.720]  First off though, man, I've talked a lot about this, I probably talked about this a thousand
[04:30.720 --> 04:36.640]  times here on air, but I'm going to talk about it again when we return, memories, having
[04:36.640 --> 04:42.280]  memories, remembering things because they're back at it again, done, done on national polls,
[04:42.280 --> 04:43.280]  Biden announces.
[04:43.280 --> 04:48.560]  But then one day he's eight points ahead of Trump and all of the contenders.
[04:48.560 --> 04:51.360]  You can rig these polls however you want.
[04:51.360 --> 05:00.560]  Remember how fake they were back in 2016, yep, new lies for old same old garbage.
[05:00.560 --> 05:05.080]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative,
[05:05.080 --> 05:08.160]  in Full Wars Life has the formula for you.
[05:08.160 --> 05:13.320]  Ultimate Crill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA and Omega
[05:13.320 --> 05:17.200]  3 is found in our high quality, ultra pure Crill Oil concentrate.
[05:17.200 --> 05:22.400]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as Azazanthin and Omega 3, ultimate Crill Oil can help you
[05:22.400 --> 05:27.240]  experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[05:27.240 --> 05:31.160]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart
[05:31.160 --> 05:35.880]  health, joint health and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping
[05:35.880 --> 05:38.640]  to maintain cognitive function and more.
[05:38.640 --> 05:42.960]  And while other Crill Oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the
[05:42.960 --> 05:48.200]  benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified high quality Crill Oil concentrate,
[05:48.200 --> 05:51.000]  paired with our ultimate fish oil or used separately.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.200]  It's time to see what Crill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Crill Oil, now available
[05:55.200 --> 06:07.040]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[06:07.040 --> 06:13.040]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[06:13.040 --> 06:17.960]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial commonwealth.
[06:17.960 --> 06:23.800]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[06:23.800 --> 06:29.800]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[06:29.800 --> 06:33.800]  It is a big idea, a new order.
[06:33.800 --> 06:43.800]  It was almost as if it were planned in both, it's just pancake.
[06:43.800 --> 06:48.800]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[06:48.800 --> 07:04.800]  I also believe a lot of God always would agree that the AK-47 along with the hands of soldiers
[07:04.800 --> 07:08.800]  not in the hands of criminals.
[07:08.800 --> 07:14.800]  The guns will be taken and no one will be able to be armed.
[07:14.800 --> 07:18.800]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in America.
[07:18.800 --> 07:20.800]  The city's global governance at last.
[07:20.800 --> 07:23.800]  Is it one world, the central bank is in charge?
[07:23.800 --> 07:27.800]  Aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[07:27.800 --> 07:29.800]  1776 will commence again.
[07:29.800 --> 07:33.800]  If you're proud to take our firearms, do you understand?
[07:33.800 --> 07:38.800]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[07:38.800 --> 07:42.800]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[07:42.800 --> 07:47.800]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[07:47.800 --> 07:50.800]  It's Thursday, April 25th, 2019.
[07:50.800 --> 07:56.800]  I have just landed the last hour and a half back in Austin, Texas, and I am loading for bear.
[07:56.800 --> 08:02.800]  What amazing event took place in DC, both publicly and behind the scenes.
[08:02.800 --> 08:08.800]  I talked to three separate people that know the president personally
[08:08.800 --> 08:12.800]  and who had met with him in the days that I was there.
[08:12.800 --> 08:16.800]  And two of them said I could go ahead and tell the story,
[08:16.800 --> 08:20.800]  but because the media that will attack them or make a big issue out of it,
[08:20.800 --> 08:23.800]  I've decided not to tell you their names.
[08:23.800 --> 08:26.800]  Though I may get one of them on the show today, I'm working on that.
[08:26.800 --> 08:31.800]  Three separate people met with the president this week
[08:31.800 --> 08:40.800]  and he said that he is going to criminally go after Hillary and Obama and Clapper and Brennan and all of them
[08:40.800 --> 08:43.800]  because he knows that they're never going to stop trying to destroy the country.
[08:43.800 --> 08:46.800]  Now we played the clip yesterday when Owen Schreuer did a great job hosting the show,
[08:46.800 --> 08:49.800]  but we're going to play it when we come back in the next segment.
[08:49.800 --> 08:54.800]  Limbaugh responded to it specifically, so I'm going to play it with his comments,
[08:54.800 --> 08:59.800]  where she said Trump needs to be indicted and Trump needs to be imprisoned.
[08:59.800 --> 09:03.800]  What a joke, no evidence of obstruction, no evidence of a crime to be obstructing,
[09:03.800 --> 09:09.800]  evidence of their whole fake investigation to cover up their crimes and to overthrow the election.
[09:09.800 --> 09:12.800]  You heard all of that here first.
[09:12.800 --> 09:21.800]  Imagine how fearful Brennan and Clapper and Hillary and Obama were two and a half years ago,
[09:21.800 --> 09:26.800]  even before Trump was in office, laying out exactly what happened.
[09:26.800 --> 09:33.800]  Well, we have sources like William Binney, the former technical head of the NSA, the real head of it.
[09:33.800 --> 09:38.800]  We have a lot of other sources, you see, and we also have our own research,
[09:38.800 --> 09:40.800]  and so that's why they wanted to software.
[09:40.800 --> 09:43.800]  That's why they've been so horrified because we have their number.
[09:43.800 --> 09:53.800]  Now, two and a half years later, Limbaugh says what I say, word for word, that's great.
[09:53.800 --> 10:00.800]  But it's because we've been doing our own research, we have our own facts,
[10:00.800 --> 10:06.800]  and we understand how to take the globalists down.
[10:06.800 --> 10:11.800]  That's why this broadcast is so critical.
[10:11.800 --> 10:14.800]  That's why this broadcast is so important.
[10:14.800 --> 10:18.800]  That's why we absolutely have to keep this broadcast on air,
[10:18.800 --> 10:21.800]  and it's why the enemy sees it as a symbol of their defeat
[10:21.800 --> 10:26.800]  and why around the clock they work to take us off air.
[10:26.800 --> 10:29.800]  Now, let me tell you some of the other things that are coming up in today's broadcast,
[10:29.800 --> 10:33.800]  and then I'll get into our first big story.
[10:33.800 --> 10:39.800]  Obviously, Biden has announced, and he's announcing on the whole Charlotteville lie,
[10:39.800 --> 10:45.800]  that Trump endorsed white supremacists, which is totally made up.
[10:45.800 --> 10:48.800]  Just like they say that Trump says all Mexicans are criminals.
[10:48.800 --> 10:49.800]  Where's the video?
[10:49.800 --> 10:50.800]  It doesn't exist.
[10:50.800 --> 10:57.800]  He's a lying scumbag, and of course the polls are lying as well.
[10:57.800 --> 11:00.800]  That's the big story I'll cover at the bottom of the hour.
[11:00.800 --> 11:03.800]  2016 lies all over again.
[11:03.800 --> 11:11.800]  Biden launches campaign with fake polls showing him eight points ahead against Trump.
[11:11.800 --> 11:14.800]  That's the live feed article posted at infowars.com.
[11:14.800 --> 11:18.800]  And look, I don't blame Drudge at report.com for having the headline.
[11:18.800 --> 11:19.800]  That gets people's attention.
[11:19.800 --> 11:21.800]  We shouldn't sit on our laurels either.
[11:21.800 --> 11:27.800]  But shock poll, Biden opens up eight-point lead on Trump.
[11:27.800 --> 11:33.800]  Eight-point lead on Trump, the very first day he announces.
[11:33.800 --> 11:40.800]  I'll do this at the bottom of the hour, but just in the interest of whoever's tuned in right now.
[11:40.800 --> 11:44.800]  Joe Biden is the front-runner, says some little out-of-the-way poll that nobody believes.
[11:44.800 --> 11:50.800]  But even Gallup and all these other big polls famously would put Hillary 15 points ahead on election day.
[11:50.800 --> 11:54.800]  CNN said that Hillary had a 98% chance of winning.
[11:54.800 --> 11:56.800]  The New York Times said a 97%.
[11:56.800 --> 12:04.800]  They would have polls where she was ahead 35 points to create the perception that she's invincible.
[12:04.800 --> 12:07.800]  So all we got to do is remind people that these polls aren't accurate.
[12:07.800 --> 12:14.800]  And I said a month ago, they had Gallup polls and things showing Trump five points ahead of Obama at this time as presidency.
[12:14.800 --> 12:19.800]  And I said, you know, it's probably 65 points with the eligible voters they're talking to.
[12:19.800 --> 12:25.800]  But they're only giving you a more reasonable, more fair poll, more accurate poll right now.
[12:25.800 --> 12:30.800]  Because when they start giving you the fake polls later, they want you to think that they're real.
[12:30.800 --> 12:31.800]  They're not.
[12:31.800 --> 12:34.800]  None of these polls are worth anything.
[12:34.800 --> 12:45.800]  It's in the WikiLeaks that a year before Hillary even ran, by 2013, John Podesta was reaching out to all the polling companies,
[12:45.800 --> 12:51.800]  making relationships with them saying, we're going to spend so much money on you, we want unity of polls,
[12:51.800 --> 12:55.800]  and we want to have the perception that she's way ahead from the beginning.
[12:55.800 --> 12:59.800]  And then they spent massive amounts of money to give you the fake polls.
[12:59.800 --> 13:00.800]  Remember?
[13:00.800 --> 13:02.800]  Remember all those headlines?
[13:02.800 --> 13:04.800]  How did everyone get it wrong?
[13:04.800 --> 13:06.800]  Politico.
[13:06.800 --> 13:10.800]  2016.
[13:10.800 --> 13:12.800]  How did everybody get it?
[13:12.800 --> 13:15.800]  So wrong because they did it on purpose.
[13:15.800 --> 13:20.800]  The polling crisis, how to tell what people really think.
[13:20.800 --> 13:22.800]  It wasn't the polls that missed.
[13:22.800 --> 13:23.800]  It was the pundits.
[13:23.800 --> 13:24.800]  No, it was all of them.
[13:24.800 --> 13:25.800]  The polls missed Trump.
[13:25.800 --> 13:28.800]  We asked pollsters why.
[13:28.800 --> 13:38.800]  A group of major pollsters just released an autopsy report to explain why the polls were such a disaster in 2016.
[13:38.800 --> 13:42.800]  Because the establishment knew Hillary was unpopular.
[13:42.800 --> 13:47.800]  And they thought they could create a bandwagon effect by putting out fake polls for her so people would say, well,
[13:47.800 --> 13:52.800]  I don't want to bet on a loser, so I just won't vote, or I'll go vote for Hillary.
[13:52.800 --> 14:01.800]  Anybody will tell you that once a football team goes to the playoffs, they sell more T-shirts during those playoff games
[14:01.800 --> 14:04.800]  than they sold during all the regular season.
[14:04.800 --> 14:07.800]  Because people jump on bandwagons.
[14:07.800 --> 14:09.800]  It's what they do, but it didn't work this time.
[14:09.800 --> 14:12.800]  So I'll cover that more at the bottom of the hour.
[14:12.800 --> 14:16.800]  Please also don't forget, oh, the World Health Organization is telling the truth.
[14:16.800 --> 14:17.800]  That's the UN.
[14:17.800 --> 14:19.800]  It says babies should not look at screens.
[14:19.800 --> 14:20.800]  It brain damages them.
[14:20.800 --> 14:21.800]  It lowers their IQs.
[14:21.800 --> 14:23.800]  It makes them not communicate with other humans.
[14:23.800 --> 14:25.800]  It's programming them.
[14:25.800 --> 14:27.800]  That's all coming up.
[14:27.800 --> 14:34.800]  Also continuing here, we're going to get into the Mexican soldiers involved with the drug cartels
[14:34.800 --> 14:36.800]  helping disarm US troops.
[14:36.800 --> 14:39.800]  And now Trump is vowing to not put up with that again.
[14:39.800 --> 14:46.800]  Oh, and of course, now we hear that thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of Boy Scouts
[14:46.800 --> 14:48.800]  have been sexually abused.
[14:48.800 --> 14:55.800]  And that's just the whitewash numbers of 3,000 or more names of sexual abuse cases
[14:55.800 --> 14:57.800]  and how it was basically covered up.
[14:57.800 --> 14:59.800]  But that's nothing.
[14:59.800 --> 15:00.800]  That's absolutely nothing.
[15:00.800 --> 15:04.800]  They now hand out condoms at the Boy Scout Jamboree
[15:04.800 --> 15:08.800]  and basically encourage everybody to have sex with each other.
[15:08.800 --> 15:10.800]  And now girls are involved as well.
[15:10.800 --> 15:18.800]  So the Boy Scouts of America in many blue state areas has turned into the happy hunting ground of the pedophiles.
[15:18.800 --> 15:22.800]  They don't need to go to drag queen story time to bounce your child on their knee.
[15:22.800 --> 15:23.800]  They just go there.
[15:23.800 --> 15:25.800]  They get a tent with your child at night and they have sex with them.
[15:25.800 --> 15:28.800]  So that's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:28.800 --> 15:31.800]  That's being done out in the open, sexualizing your children.
[15:31.800 --> 15:33.800]  But as long as it's liberal, it's OK.
[15:33.800 --> 15:37.800]  Yeah, Boy Scouts to provide condoms in upcoming World Jamboree.
[15:37.800 --> 15:39.800]  Tens of thousands of condoms are being handed out.
[15:39.800 --> 15:41.800]  That was from three years ago.
[15:41.800 --> 15:43.800]  What does that tell you?
[15:43.800 --> 15:45.800]  What does that tell you?
[15:45.800 --> 15:46.800]  They're just encouraging you.
[15:46.800 --> 15:50.800]  It's like saying, hey, here's all the beer and here's the heroin.
[15:50.800 --> 15:52.800]  I mean, they're just saying, do it.
[15:52.800 --> 15:53.800]  Wow.
[15:53.800 --> 16:22.800]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[16:23.800 --> 16:46.800]  We'll be right back.
[16:46.800 --> 16:56.800]  We'll be right back.
[17:16.800 --> 17:31.800]  We'll be right back.
[17:31.800 --> 17:58.800]  We'll be right back.
[17:58.800 --> 18:23.800]  We'll be right back.
[18:23.800 --> 18:49.800]  We'll be right back.
[18:49.800 --> 18:59.800]  We'll be right back.
[19:19.800 --> 19:48.800]  We'll be right back.
[19:48.800 --> 19:58.800]  We'll be right back.
[20:18.800 --> 20:30.800]  We'll be right back.
[20:30.800 --> 20:36.800]  Looking live there at the White House lawn, Alex Jones, the controversial host,
[20:36.800 --> 20:41.800]  Trump supporter out there with a bullhorn, and that's what you heard earlier,
[20:41.800 --> 20:44.800]  some people out there as well, saying they support President Trump,
[20:44.800 --> 20:48.800]  but they don't support Twitter, President Trump meeting with the CEO of Twitter,
[20:48.800 --> 20:51.800]  Jack Dorsey, here at the White House today.
[20:51.800 --> 20:53.800]  You kind of hear the bullhorn in the background,
[20:53.800 --> 20:58.800]  thought we'd show you what was happening.
[20:58.800 --> 21:02.800]  By the way, that was total providence, synchronicity, serendipity,
[21:02.800 --> 21:09.800]  whatever the proper term is, that I land in DC on Tuesday.
[21:09.800 --> 21:14.800]  I go directly from the airport to the White House.
[21:14.800 --> 21:19.800]  It was a private meeting, it wasn't announced until it was ongoing
[21:19.800 --> 21:26.800]  that the head of Twitter would be in there in a meeting being chastised for censorship,
[21:26.800 --> 21:28.800]  and then sure enough, right while I'm bullhorring,
[21:28.800 --> 21:31.800]  there's a whole bunch of news out there that actually picked up what I was saying.
[21:31.800 --> 21:35.800]  That's how the Fox host was able to repeat what I had just said,
[21:35.800 --> 21:37.800]  and there's more audio of that.
[21:37.800 --> 21:41.800]  The poor leftists out there had their own bullhorns,
[21:41.800 --> 21:43.800]  two of them screaming at me trying to drown me out,
[21:43.800 --> 21:45.800]  but they don't know how to use them.
[21:45.800 --> 21:47.800]  They don't know how to use them.
[21:47.800 --> 21:48.800]  They always aim them.
[21:48.800 --> 21:51.800]  Maybe I shouldn't tell them how to use a bullhorn properly.
[21:51.800 --> 21:56.800]  They always aim them at the crowd as if they're little commies and they want to convince them
[21:56.800 --> 22:02.800]  instead of really yelling through one at full power and then bouncing it off buildings.
[22:02.800 --> 22:05.800]  But that's what we were doing, and it was extremely successful,
[22:05.800 --> 22:08.800]  and I'm told that the president even remarked on it later,
[22:08.800 --> 22:13.800]  because despite the bulletproof clash, I was going right into the room
[22:13.800 --> 22:15.800]  where the meeting was actually taking place.
[22:15.800 --> 22:18.800]  Now, that's Providence for you.
[22:18.800 --> 22:24.800]  Some other stuff happened on the trip that deals with what we're about to hit right now.
[22:24.800 --> 22:29.800]  Rush Limbaugh responding to Hillary saying Trump should be indicted and locked up,
[22:29.800 --> 22:35.800]  and then Limbaugh laying it all out with 100% accuracy what's happened and what we're facing.
[22:35.800 --> 22:38.800]  Now, Limbaugh was saying a lot of this year and a half ago,
[22:38.800 --> 22:40.800]  and he was a trailblazer just like Sean Hannity,
[22:40.800 --> 22:44.800]  but I was saying it two and a half years ago with total precision,
[22:44.800 --> 22:46.800]  and I'm saying that to explain,
[22:46.800 --> 22:49.800]  info wars is an important ordinance in the fight for this country.
[22:49.800 --> 22:51.800]  We are the damn tip of the spear.
[22:51.800 --> 22:52.800]  The enemy knows that.
[22:52.800 --> 22:54.800]  So thank you for the support, but we need your prayers,
[22:54.800 --> 22:58.800]  and we need you to buy products that are infowarsore.com on a regular basis.
[22:58.800 --> 23:01.800]  It takes a lot of money to run this and to fight their tips to shut us down.
[23:01.800 --> 23:04.800]  We will be successful. We are being successful,
[23:04.800 --> 23:06.800]  despite the lies they put out in the news,
[23:06.800 --> 23:09.800]  but we need your support because big things are happening.
[23:09.800 --> 23:10.800]  When we come back in the next segment,
[23:10.800 --> 23:13.800]  I'm going to get into the fake polls just like two years ago,
[23:13.800 --> 23:14.800]  just like three years ago,
[23:14.800 --> 23:18.800]  but even bigger, the amazing sources,
[23:18.800 --> 23:21.800]  what happened, what I discovered when I was in DC
[23:21.800 --> 23:26.800]  from three separate people that met with the president.
[23:26.800 --> 23:29.800]  This is directly from folks that met with the president
[23:29.800 --> 23:33.800]  and what he said about his plan to move against the deep state.
[23:33.800 --> 23:34.800]  It's happening.
[23:34.800 --> 23:36.800]  That's the current course the president's on.
[23:36.800 --> 23:39.800]  This is history, but expect big fireworks.
[23:39.800 --> 23:41.800]  Here's Rush Limbaugh.
[23:41.800 --> 23:49.800]  There's enough there that any other person who had engaged in those acts
[23:49.800 --> 23:53.800]  would certainly have been indicted.
[23:53.800 --> 24:00.800]  The whole matter of obstruction was very directly sent to the Congress.
[24:00.800 --> 24:06.800]  If you read that part of the report, it could not be clearer.
[24:06.800 --> 24:10.800]  What's going through your mind as you're listening to that, Rush?
[24:10.800 --> 24:12.800]  I was trying not to listen to that.
[24:12.800 --> 24:18.800]  Hillary Clinton is who tried to rig a presidential election at Martha.
[24:18.800 --> 24:22.800]  Hillary Clinton and her pals in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI,
[24:22.800 --> 24:25.800]  they are the ones who colluded with the Russians.
[24:25.800 --> 24:32.800]  They are the ones that gave us this entirely, totally bogus, steel dossier.
[24:32.800 --> 24:37.800]  For Hillary Clinton to be talking about impeaching Donald Trump,
[24:37.800 --> 24:41.800]  Hillary Clinton needs to be investigated, she needs to be indicted,
[24:41.800 --> 24:43.800]  and she needs to be in jail.
[24:43.800 --> 24:47.800]  And many of her co-conspirators in this whole sorted affair,
[24:47.800 --> 24:53.800]  which amounted to nothing more than a silent coup to overturn the election results of 2016.
[24:53.800 --> 24:55.800]  Hillary Clinton demanding a Trump...
[24:55.800 --> 24:57.800]  You talk about sour grapes.
[24:57.800 --> 25:00.800]  This is a woman's been rejected by the American people twice,
[25:00.800 --> 25:03.800]  rejected by her party in 2008.
[25:03.800 --> 25:08.800]  She had to rig the primaries against Crazy Bernie in 2016 to get the nomination.
[25:08.800 --> 25:15.800]  She is the last person who ought to be listened to about what ought to happen to Donald Trump.
[25:15.800 --> 25:20.800]  She hasn't accomplished anything anywhere near what Donald Trump has accomplished.
[25:20.800 --> 25:24.800]  She is in no position here to sit here and say what she saw in the mullery.
[25:24.800 --> 25:26.800]  Well, she can say it, she's an American.
[25:26.800 --> 25:28.800]  But she doesn't have any credibility on any of this.
[25:28.800 --> 25:29.800]  That's right.
[25:29.800 --> 25:31.800]  I am concerned, and I'm not alone there.
[25:31.800 --> 25:35.800]  Let's go to another clip from that powerful interview.
[25:35.800 --> 25:37.800]  He did, like, almost the whole hour with her.
[25:37.800 --> 25:39.800]  The video is up on infowars.com.
[25:39.800 --> 25:42.800]  It's good to see Limbaugh on board with reality here, because that's what's happening.
[25:42.800 --> 25:47.800]  Now he gets into that the whole Mueller investigation was a cover-up of the crimes of the Clintons.
[25:47.800 --> 25:58.800]  And to back that up, when we come back, I've got a video where Democrats admit that they were secretly spying on Trump,
[25:58.800 --> 26:00.800]  and that that's how they knew he was a Russian agent.
[26:00.800 --> 26:01.800]  I had remembered this.
[26:01.800 --> 26:04.800]  I had talked about this from two years ago.
[26:04.800 --> 26:11.800]  One American news network found some of the clips that we all remember them on the news.
[26:11.800 --> 26:15.800]  Obama official saying, Obama ordered us to spy on Trump.
[26:15.800 --> 26:16.800]  We found out he's a Russian.
[26:16.800 --> 26:17.800]  That's why we know.
[26:17.800 --> 26:19.800]  That's how I knew they were spying.
[26:19.800 --> 26:20.800]  They said it.
[26:20.800 --> 26:21.800]  This is almost three years ago.
[26:21.800 --> 26:24.800]  This is during the campaign they were saying this.
[26:24.800 --> 26:26.800]  It's crazy.
[26:26.800 --> 26:28.800]  Remember, I was making a big deal about it.
[26:28.800 --> 26:29.800]  You were making a big deal about it.
[26:29.800 --> 26:33.800]  And so they spun it and said, well, Trump got this from Jones.
[26:33.800 --> 26:35.800]  He just made this up.
[26:35.800 --> 26:37.800]  That's coming up at the start of the next segment.
[26:37.800 --> 26:39.800]  But let's go to the second clip of Rush Limbaugh.
[26:39.800 --> 26:45.800]  There was never any evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia.
[26:45.800 --> 26:50.800]  The collusion, as I said, was Hillary, the DNC, and the Russians via steel.
[26:50.800 --> 26:55.800]  But when Mueller announced the indictments of the Russian troll farm,
[26:55.800 --> 26:58.800]  actually it was Rosenstein who went out and announced them,
[26:58.800 --> 27:01.800]  and nobody paid the attention to this, but he said at the end of the announcement,
[27:01.800 --> 27:05.800]  nothing in these indictments suggests a single vote was changed.
[27:05.800 --> 27:09.800]  Nothing suggests the outcome of any election was changed.
[27:09.800 --> 27:12.800]  No American is named in the indictment having to do with it.
[27:12.800 --> 27:14.800]  There was never any evidence for this.
[27:14.800 --> 27:16.800]  There was never Mueller.
[27:16.800 --> 27:20.800]  When he got the file from Comey, it was empty.
[27:20.800 --> 27:24.800]  All they had was the dossier, and we all know that it was made up.
[27:24.800 --> 27:26.800]  It was opposition research.
[27:26.800 --> 27:29.800]  This was not even an investigation of Trump.
[27:29.800 --> 27:33.800]  What it was was an attempt to overthrow the 2016 elections.
[27:33.800 --> 27:37.800]  And the Mueller investigation, I believe, was actually many things,
[27:37.800 --> 27:42.800]  including a cover-up and a distraction to keep people from understanding what really happened.
[27:42.800 --> 27:47.800]  Donald Trump accomplished one of the greatest achievements of his life
[27:47.800 --> 27:49.800]  against all odds with no assistance.
[27:49.800 --> 27:53.800]  His own party wasn't even that much behind him.
[27:53.800 --> 27:56.800]  He's done something that few Americans will ever do,
[27:56.800 --> 27:58.800]  and they're trying to take it away from him,
[27:58.800 --> 28:02.800]  and they're trying to sully his reputation simply because they don't like him.
[28:02.800 --> 28:05.800]  This is a sordid situation.
[28:05.800 --> 28:09.800]  I think our country was at great risk during this whole thing,
[28:09.800 --> 28:11.800]  and there needs to be an investigation.
[28:11.800 --> 28:15.800]  I hope the Attorney General's serious because these people need to be investigated.
[28:15.800 --> 28:20.800]  We need to be told who they are, what they did, even though we already know.
[28:20.800 --> 28:22.800]  That's the key.
[28:22.800 --> 28:26.800]  Again, the full clips are up on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[28:26.800 --> 28:31.800]  Get that out to people because, remember, this is the first place it was all covered.
[28:31.800 --> 28:33.800]  Our audience, you got the word out.
[28:33.800 --> 28:35.800]  That's why the globalists fear you.
[28:35.800 --> 28:40.800]  They know I'm going to stay on the air one way or another after broadcast out of my house,
[28:40.800 --> 28:44.800]  but they don't want you being able to have access to information.
[28:44.800 --> 28:46.800]  You're looking for it so you can't spread it.
[28:46.800 --> 28:48.800]  So don't let them win.

[33:55.800 --> 33:57.800]  What's up, the deep state caught.
[33:57.800 --> 34:00.800]  But all their criminal activities trying to overthrow the election.
[34:00.800 --> 34:07.800]  It's the fact that Sam Powers and other high-level Obama administration officials
[34:07.800 --> 34:11.800]  went on television when President Trump was president-elect
[34:11.800 --> 34:17.800]  and said, we know he's a Russian agent because we were spying on him.
[34:17.800 --> 34:19.800]  The New York Times said it. Others said it.
[34:19.800 --> 34:21.800]  That's how I knew.
[34:21.800 --> 34:25.800]  And then Judge Napolitano came out.
[34:25.800 --> 34:29.800]  Six months after we broke it and said I've talked to high-level British sources,
[34:29.800 --> 34:33.800]  they were asked to spy on Trump by Obama.
[34:33.800 --> 34:38.800]  And the intelligence agencies run by the left know the public's ignorant about intelligence agencies.
[34:38.800 --> 34:42.800]  Since the beginning of the Five Eyes more than 50 years ago,
[34:42.800 --> 34:46.800]  England, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the U.S.
[34:46.800 --> 34:49.800]  and a lot of it's the EU now and Interpol,
[34:49.800 --> 34:53.800]  they'll have one foreign government spy on you
[34:53.800 --> 34:59.800]  and then you'll spy on them because the government's always making it illegal to spy on your own people.
[34:59.800 --> 35:01.800]  Because you'd obviously have a police state
[35:01.800 --> 35:04.800]  and you'd have one political group use it against the other political group.
[35:04.800 --> 35:09.800]  The political group in power would always use spying technology to defeat their political enemies.
[35:09.800 --> 35:12.800]  Game over. It's called cheating. It's called tyranny.
[35:12.800 --> 35:17.800]  So they got around it spying on their political opposition using foreign governments.
[35:17.800 --> 35:21.800]  That is the default. It's like saying two plus two equals four.
[35:21.800 --> 35:24.800]  So we first broke all this and said,
[35:24.800 --> 35:27.800]  England's normally the go-to to spy on the U.S.
[35:27.800 --> 35:30.800]  I said look at England doing it.
[35:30.800 --> 35:37.800]  When I saw them on the news saying we have the intelligence that he's a Russian agent, i.e. Trump.
[35:37.800 --> 35:42.800]  And so I've talked about trying to find these videos.
[35:42.800 --> 35:48.800]  I found some of the articles trying to find the videos from late 2016, early 2017.
[35:48.800 --> 35:51.800]  Well, one American news network did find it.
[35:51.800 --> 35:59.800]  So I'm in their studios yesterday while they've got live programming coming in from San Diego where they're based
[35:59.800 --> 36:02.800]  and they've got live feeds coming in, doing a great job,
[36:02.800 --> 36:05.800]  what Fox News should be doing from the Capitol.
[36:05.800 --> 36:10.800]  And then I saw them go to a taped piece that was this one while I'm waiting to go home with Jack Posoby.
[36:10.800 --> 36:12.800]  And I was like, what? That's one of the clips.
[36:12.800 --> 36:19.800]  I'm like, I remember seeing her on TV basically bragging how they were spying on Trump.
[36:19.800 --> 36:23.800]  Then they go to Congress later and say, we weren't involved spying on Trump.
[36:23.800 --> 36:28.800]  Clapper, Brennan, Comey, McCabe, all of them say, oh, we never spied on Trump.
[36:28.800 --> 36:33.800]  Now Clapper and Brennan go on TV three weeks ago and go, we were actually ordered by Obama to do it.
[36:33.800 --> 36:35.800]  So we didn't do anything illegal.
[36:35.800 --> 36:41.800]  The point is you have lied and the president orders you to spy on somebody for political purposes.
[36:41.800 --> 36:44.800]  It's illegal too, just like when Nixon did it.
[36:44.800 --> 36:46.800]  So they are caught.
[36:46.800 --> 36:52.800]  And this is what I've obsessed on is these key facts right now.
[36:52.800 --> 36:53.800]  Here it is.
[36:53.800 --> 37:02.800]  In the wake of the Mueller probe, details continue to emerge about how the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign ahead of the 2016 elections.
[37:02.800 --> 37:07.800]  One America's Neil W. McCabe spoke to a former CIA analyst.
[37:07.800 --> 37:11.800]  Larry Johnson was an analyst for both the CIA and the State Department.
[37:11.800 --> 37:14.800]  He told One America News that now that the Mueller probe is closed,
[37:14.800 --> 37:25.800]  it's time for the American people to learn the truth about how the British government helped the Obama administration dodge the Fourth Amendment by spying on the 2016 Trump campaign for them.
[37:25.800 --> 37:38.800]  One of the strengths and weaknesses or dangers of this Five Eyes Cooperative is that it provides a channel for sharing intelligence information.
[37:38.800 --> 37:46.800]  Johnson said there is a cooperation agreement between the intelligence services of the U.S., U.K., Canada, New Zealand and Australia,
[37:46.800 --> 37:54.800]  the so-called Five Eyes Club, that allowed the Obama administration to access surveillance of U.S. citizens as foreign gathered intelligence.
[37:54.800 --> 37:59.800]  On this side of the ocean, who are the highest levels in the U.S. intelligence community,
[37:59.800 --> 38:07.800]  it's sort of an agreement to collect and share information and do it in a way that would not necessarily attract undue attention,
[38:07.800 --> 38:14.800]  but would provide a documentary record that could be being used to justify targeting Donald Trump.
[38:14.800 --> 38:21.800]  Just as the Trump administration took office, a senior official in the Obama Pentagon had an unguarded moment on MSNBC.
[38:21.800 --> 38:26.800]  I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people who left,
[38:26.800 --> 38:39.800]  so it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy that the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about the Trump staff dealing with Russians,
[38:39.800 --> 38:42.800]  that they would try to compromise those sources and methods.
[38:42.800 --> 38:49.800]  We know that specifically from a former Department of Defense official under Obama named Evelyn Farkas. She admitted to it.
[38:49.800 --> 38:55.800]  Johnson said in the beginning the British were simply curious about Donald Trump as he became a serious candidate for president.
[38:55.800 --> 39:01.800]  The British did this in part, I'm given to understand by people who were familiar with what was up,
[39:01.800 --> 39:10.800]  is that they were concerned about Trump's policies on NATO and Syria, and they wanted to make sure that they could start understanding what he was up to.
[39:10.800 --> 39:17.800]  One clear example of the U.K. surveillance was the monitoring of Trump campaign volunteer, George Papadopoulos, he said.
[39:17.800 --> 39:23.800]  How did George Papadopoulos come to the attention of both law enforcement and intelligence sources?
[39:23.800 --> 39:32.800]  And when you look at his story, you begin to realize his first communications from U.K. to the United States, they were emails.
[39:32.800 --> 39:36.800]  So maybe in one or two phone calls I would probably call collecting.
[39:36.800 --> 39:38.800]  Well, those were intercepted.
[39:38.800 --> 39:42.800]  I absolutely, they were intercepted by the United Kingdom.
[39:42.800 --> 39:48.800]  He was general communications headquarters, and then information was passed back through the United States through intel channels.
[39:48.800 --> 39:56.800]  In fact, Papadopoulos, living in London, was told in early March 2016 that he could focus on American relations with Russia.
[39:56.800 --> 40:02.800]  One week later, an American intel asset, Professor Joseph Mifsud, approached him in Italy.
[40:02.800 --> 40:10.800]  Later on in March, Mifsud met with Papadopoulos in London and told him that he could introduce him to Russian president, Vladimir Putin.
[40:10.800 --> 40:13.800]  And the Russian collusion hoax was born.
[40:13.800 --> 40:26.800]  Fifteen minutes after President Donald Trump took office, Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice used her White House account to send an email to herself about the surveillance of the Trump campaign that read in part that
[40:26.800 --> 40:37.800]  President Barack Obama stressed, quote, his commitment to ensuring every aspect of this issue handled by the intelligence and law enforcement communities was by the book, unquote.
[40:37.800 --> 40:41.800]  Neil W. McCabe, One American News, Washington.
[40:41.800 --> 40:49.800]  So, we're going to play that Samantha Powers clip one more time, but there she is heading up National Security for Obama.
[40:49.800 --> 40:57.800]  And she's openly on TV admitting that they were illegally surveilling the president, and then later saying that they didn't do that.
[40:57.800 --> 41:03.800]  They can't even cover their butts anymore.
[41:03.800 --> 41:06.800]  They're unable to do it.
[41:06.800 --> 41:10.800]  And then she sends herself an email once Trump actually gets in.
[41:10.800 --> 41:21.800]  She can't believe they were unable to stop him, saying, oh, we better follow all the laws on surveillance when she'd been quarterbacking it along with others the whole time.
[41:21.800 --> 41:23.800]  And that's what our sources told us at the time.
[41:23.800 --> 41:25.800]  It's all turned out to be true.
[41:25.800 --> 41:36.800]  That's why the globalists want us shut off the air. That's why they lie about us. That's why they demonize us. That's why they sue us.
[41:36.800 --> 41:43.800]  That's why they do all this because they understand that we will first break the news and make it safe for others to cover it.
[41:43.800 --> 41:50.800]  But this is such a big deal that they've been caught doing this and caught lying about this and Trump must take action.
[41:50.800 --> 41:55.800]  When we come back, I'll get into the polls, but I'm going to do that at the start of the next hour. The new fake polls.
[41:55.800 --> 42:01.800]  It's like 2016 against Trump for Biden and this whole perception management, the bandwagon effect.
[42:01.800 --> 42:13.800]  But I want to hit first because it dovetails into all this three different people I talked to with direct knowledge of the president and what he plans to do to the deep state.
[42:13.800 --> 42:22.800]  So this is going to be really, really big and really, really important. But here is powers on CNN or MSNBC one more time for you admitting it all.
[42:22.800 --> 42:28.800]  I had a fear that somehow that information would disappear with the senior people who left.
[42:28.800 --> 42:40.800]  So it would be hidden away in the bureaucracy that the Trump folks, if they found out how we knew what we knew about the Trump staffs dealing with Russians,
[42:40.800 --> 42:43.800]  that they would try to compromise those sources and methods.
[42:43.800 --> 42:45.800]  We know that specifically from...
[42:45.800 --> 42:50.800]  And again, to be clear, that's Evelyn Farkas talking about Samantha Powers.
[42:50.800 --> 43:17.800]  But specifically, we have a Samantha Powers statement coming up as well. I'm Alex Jones, M4Wars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[43:21.800 --> 43:29.800]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2. That's been incredible.
[43:29.800 --> 43:37.800]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[43:37.800 --> 43:45.800]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[43:45.800 --> 43:50.800]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[43:50.800 --> 43:54.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[43:54.800 --> 44:23.800]  X3, now available at m4warslife.com.

[47:22.800 --> 47:48.800]  All right, I want to just pull back for a moment here.
[47:48.800 --> 47:54.800]  And I want to just almost have a moment of silence for listeners and myself
[47:54.800 --> 47:59.800]  so we can really contemplate where this country is, where this nation's going,
[47:59.800 --> 48:01.800]  and where this world's going.
[48:01.800 --> 48:05.800]  Because whether you love Donald Trump or whether you hate Donald Trump
[48:05.800 --> 48:10.800]  or whether you're somewhere in between, there's no doubt he's shaken up the power structure
[48:10.800 --> 48:14.800]  and there's no doubt that the original corrupt deep state
[48:14.800 --> 48:18.800]  that's been in control of our nation really for 50 years
[48:18.800 --> 48:25.800]  overreached massively and has been caught with their tentacles in the cookie jar.
[48:25.800 --> 48:27.800]  And they're going to strike back.
[48:27.800 --> 48:32.800]  And so President Trump cannot just sit there and try to make the economy successful
[48:32.800 --> 48:38.800]  and share power with the establishment and hope that they just think straight.
[48:38.800 --> 48:40.800]  No, they are full of bravada.
[48:40.800 --> 48:42.800]  They are full of hoodspot.
[48:42.800 --> 48:44.800]  They are full of arrogance.
[48:44.800 --> 48:46.800]  They are full of hubris.
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.800]  They are filled with psychotic swamp energy.
[48:51.800 --> 48:53.800]  And they're not going to stop.
[48:53.800 --> 48:55.800]  Well, here's the good news.
[48:55.800 --> 49:01.800]  Two of these people I talked to said, go ahead, talk about it on record.
[49:01.800 --> 49:06.800]  And then a third one said, well, you can go ahead.
[49:06.800 --> 49:08.800]  But then said, maybe not.
[49:08.800 --> 49:10.800]  Just don't say my name.
[49:10.800 --> 49:12.800]  So I'm not going to say anybody's name.
[49:12.800 --> 49:18.800]  But I sat there eyeball to eyeball with three people
[49:18.800 --> 49:22.800]  that directly communicate with the president on a daily basis
[49:22.800 --> 49:26.800]  that write briefings for him that are in the meetings.
[49:26.800 --> 49:31.800]  And last week, please queue up the first Rush Limbaugh clip,
[49:31.800 --> 49:34.800]  just the part with Hillary that we played earlier.
[49:34.800 --> 49:43.800]  Just this week, on Monday and Tuesday, this was going on.
[49:43.800 --> 49:50.800]  And Trump already was intending to have the Justice Department be pushed
[49:50.800 --> 49:53.800]  to do the right thing and to follow up and to have Congress do it.
[49:53.800 --> 49:56.800]  And boy, do they have them dead to rights, dead in their sights.
[49:56.800 --> 49:58.800]  I mean, we've got them open and shut.
[49:58.800 --> 50:03.800]  But when Hillary and others went on TV and said that the president is a criminal
[50:03.800 --> 50:07.800]  that needs to be indicted for obstruction, smoke came out of his ears.
[50:07.800 --> 50:10.800]  Because you've got a bunch of Democrats going, oh, we're not going to impeach you.
[50:10.800 --> 50:11.800]  Back off.
[50:11.800 --> 50:12.800]  Let's be friendly.
[50:12.800 --> 50:13.800]  Let's just fight over politics.
[50:13.800 --> 50:15.800]  You know, we're sorry we got caught.
[50:15.800 --> 50:17.800]  But Nadler's not quitting.
[50:17.800 --> 50:19.800]  Chucky Schumer's not quitting.
[50:19.800 --> 50:21.800]  A lot of folks aren't quitting.
[50:21.800 --> 50:23.800]  Schiff isn't quitting.
[50:23.800 --> 50:26.800]  And so why would you let a bunch of crooks that covered up Russia connections
[50:26.800 --> 50:32.800]  to Hillary and China and Obama sit there and claim that Trump's the criminal?
[50:32.800 --> 50:36.800]  Why would he sit there and let them after years of illegally spying on him
[50:36.800 --> 50:40.800]  and lying about him and harassing him and his family and his supporters,
[50:40.800 --> 50:43.800]  like yours truly, that's been hell.
[50:43.800 --> 50:46.800]  I'm willing to take it, but I'm not willing to roll over to it.
[50:46.800 --> 50:49.800]  I'll take the pain to beat them.
[50:49.800 --> 50:52.800]  In fact, I like the pain in that process.
[50:52.800 --> 50:53.800]  But it's like magic.
[50:53.800 --> 50:56.800]  If we go through all this pain and lose, then it's for naught.
[50:56.800 --> 50:58.800]  We take the pain and win.
[50:58.800 --> 50:59.800]  It's Valhalla.
[50:59.800 --> 51:04.800]  So I talked to three different people.
[51:04.800 --> 51:07.800]  One person is a close friend of the president and talked to him routinely.
[51:07.800 --> 51:09.800]  I'll leave it at that.
[51:09.800 --> 51:19.800]  Others write briefings for him and advise him specifically on the memo that he had dealing with.
[51:19.800 --> 51:22.800]  And I was authorized to say this because they don't care if the president knows who it is
[51:22.800 --> 51:24.800]  because the president doesn't want to be a secret.
[51:24.800 --> 51:29.800]  The memo that the president Trump had when he was the briefing he got
[51:29.800 --> 51:31.800]  before he interviewed Jack Dorsey of Twitter.
[51:31.800 --> 51:39.800]  And then the other person was one of the falsely accused Russiagate individuals
[51:39.800 --> 51:44.800]  who was not involved, but had worked in Eastern Europe for the CIA.
[51:44.800 --> 51:48.800]  And the Clintons knew that he'd worked for them and he was brought back in.
[51:48.800 --> 51:52.800]  He's been on the show before and he met with the president on Tuesday in the Oval Office.
[51:52.800 --> 51:55.800]  And the president said, I'm going after him.
[51:55.800 --> 51:56.800]  Damn the torpedoes.
[51:56.800 --> 51:58.800]  Have you seen what Hillary Clinton is saying?
[51:58.800 --> 51:59.800]  I'm sick of these crooks.
[51:59.800 --> 52:00.800]  Trump's got all the intel now.
[52:00.800 --> 52:02.800]  He actually knows how they've sold us out.
[52:02.800 --> 52:07.800]  And he's just got like total proof that they're globalist criminals that hate the country.
[52:07.800 --> 52:13.800]  And I'm giving some specifics here for the deep state that's corrupt to realize how defeated you are,
[52:13.800 --> 52:17.800]  how routed you are, how we have you.
[52:17.800 --> 52:23.800]  Because I was told by two of the three, I can go ahead and tell you all this.
[52:23.800 --> 52:26.800]  But I decided not to just to leave it out of it.
[52:26.800 --> 52:32.800]  But just to give the little breadcrumbs to the establishment that's still hanging on.
[52:32.800 --> 52:36.800]  Because remember, we got the text messages a year and a half ago of Strock and Page going,
[52:36.800 --> 52:37.800]  there's no Russia evidence.
[52:37.800 --> 52:38.800]  Trump's done nothing wrong.
[52:38.800 --> 52:40.800]  What we're doing is illegal.
[52:40.800 --> 52:41.800]  We're going to go to jail.
[52:41.800 --> 52:43.800]  He's like, no, baby, hold on.
[52:43.800 --> 52:44.800]  He'll be out soon.
[52:44.800 --> 52:45.800]  He's not out.
[52:45.800 --> 52:46.800]  The investigation was a fraud.
[52:46.800 --> 52:52.800]  Your bosses, Obama and Hillary and Clapper and Brennan, they're the ones, Samantha Powers,
[52:52.800 --> 52:54.800]  and the mainstream media that covered it up.
[52:54.800 --> 53:03.800]  They're the ones on the hook now, unless we let them grab victory from the jaws of defeat.
[53:03.800 --> 53:06.800]  It's coming and others that are in the jaws of this.
[53:06.800 --> 53:10.800]  Why do you think Mueller, even though he hates Trump and was paid to put this lie out?
[53:10.800 --> 53:14.800]  And as a deep state man of the Bushes and the Clintons, why do you think he had to back off?
[53:14.800 --> 53:20.800]  Because there was no evidence A and B, the evidence is to the contrary, it's to their criminal activity.
[53:20.800 --> 53:27.800]  So I'm going to tell you again, Trump has told confidant friends that he is going to go after them in the media.
[53:27.800 --> 53:29.800]  He's going to go after them with lawsuits.
[53:29.800 --> 53:31.800]  He's going to push the Justice Department to go after them.
[53:31.800 --> 53:32.800]  He's not going to stop.
[53:32.800 --> 53:36.800]  He's looking into all the funding of these stay-behind leftist groups.
[53:36.800 --> 53:37.800]  That's been brought up.
[53:37.800 --> 53:43.800]  We've been beating that drum of all this defense department funding to special leftist stay-behind criminal groups,
[53:43.800 --> 53:45.800]  in beds, as the president calls them.
[53:45.800 --> 53:48.800]  And they've got the Justice Department warmed up to prosecute.
[53:48.800 --> 53:49.800]  And you know why?
[53:49.800 --> 53:54.800]  Because so many people in the Justice Department really weren't cheerleaders for this.
[53:54.800 --> 54:00.800]  But they thought Trump would be brought down so to cover their butts, they went along with it.
[54:00.800 --> 54:07.800]  And now all those people have to take action or they could be rolled up in the wider investigation.
[54:07.800 --> 54:16.800]  So Trump is flipping and Barr is now flipping all these people against the Clintons and the Obamas and the rest of these crooks.
[54:16.800 --> 54:20.800]  That's why Brennan and Clapper two, three weeks ago went on CNN and said,
[54:20.800 --> 54:27.800]  OK, we spied on them, but it was all ordered by the president.
[54:27.800 --> 54:29.800]  And as listeners, you already know all these facts.
[54:29.800 --> 54:31.800]  You already know this is researchers.
[54:31.800 --> 54:36.800]  But now it's coming to a head and I'm telling you, Trump changes his mind sometimes.
[54:36.800 --> 54:41.800]  But right now he fully intends to damn the torpedoes, go straight at him.
[54:41.800 --> 54:49.800]  And the fact that Hillary shot her mouth off and other things just means that he's probably not going to turn back now.
[54:49.800 --> 54:51.800]  So that means we need to pray for the president.
[54:51.800 --> 54:56.800]  And we need to also understand they're going to really try to assassinate him now or they're going to try some type of big false flag.
[54:56.800 --> 54:59.800]  I mean, they're not going to take this lying down.
[54:59.800 --> 55:04.800]  So this country is in a prime zone of conflict and danger.
[55:04.800 --> 55:07.800]  We've reached an event horizon. This is it.
[55:07.800 --> 55:13.800]  All because behind the scenes, Hillary and others were given a chance to stop, but they can't stop.
[55:13.800 --> 55:15.800]  And so we can't stop now.
[55:15.800 --> 55:18.800]  It'd be better for the country if they just backed off and quit.
[55:18.800 --> 55:22.800]  They're not going to because Hillary is saying stuff like this.
[55:22.800 --> 55:34.800]  There's enough there that any other person who had engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted.
[55:34.800 --> 55:41.800]  The whole matter of obstruction was very directly sent to the Congress.
[55:41.800 --> 55:45.800]  I mean, if you read that part of the report, it could not be clearer.
[55:45.800 --> 55:48.800]  This is from the queen of treason.
[55:48.800 --> 55:54.800]  This is from the queen of obstruction. You've got Loretto Lynch on tarmac with Clinton.
[55:54.800 --> 56:00.800]  She's criminally investigating, making deals to not prosecute, promising her the next attorney general ship.
[56:00.800 --> 56:03.800]  I mean, these people are a joke.
[56:03.800 --> 56:05.800]  Everybody's asking who'll be indicted first.
[56:05.800 --> 56:08.800]  It's going to be Strach and others.
[56:08.800 --> 56:12.800]  Page came in and spilled her guts over here and a half ago.
[56:12.800 --> 56:18.800]  It'll be Strach, it'll be or, and then it's just going to go up to McCabe and then ride with the top.
[56:18.800 --> 56:22.800]  I mean, hell, the Democrats got Richard Nixon for stuff one, one millionth as bad.
[56:22.800 --> 56:24.800]  We're going to get you.
[56:24.800 --> 56:27.800]  We're kicking your butt, Hillary.
[56:27.800 --> 56:29.800]  You think you're kicking my butt?
[56:29.800 --> 56:30.800]  No, lady.
[56:30.800 --> 56:32.800]  No, you're being defeated.
[56:32.800 --> 56:34.800]  We're winning and that's not taught.
[56:34.800 --> 56:36.800]  That's the real world.
[56:36.800 --> 56:40.800]  We're going to come back with a second hour and their fake polls, a special guest and so much more,
[56:40.800 --> 56:42.800]  but I've not even plugged the shower.
[56:42.800 --> 56:47.800]  I need to plug now without you buying our products on a daily basis and funding our operation.
[56:47.800 --> 56:48.800]  We won't be here.
[56:48.800 --> 56:54.800]  It takes a lot of t-shirts and a lot of books and a lot of supplements and a lot of films to fund this operation here because we sell them at good prices.
[56:54.800 --> 57:02.800]  And right now we've got to get a free bottle of our amazing sleep aid knockout that's got thousands and thousands of five star ratings on power reviews.
[57:02.800 --> 57:12.800]  When you get a bottle of that free, when you get a bottle of Brain Force Plus, the great new tropic for focus and clarity and energy itself 25% off.
[57:12.800 --> 57:17.800]  So we're only running this special through to the middle of next week or so because we're going to get low on Brain Force.
[57:17.800 --> 57:18.800]  We have plenty of knockout.
[57:18.800 --> 57:20.800]  It's our total best seller.
[57:20.800 --> 57:22.800]  We sell the most bottles of knockout of anything.
[57:22.800 --> 57:28.800]  Brain Force is like number two, but they're not as profitable as some of the other products because there's almost no markup in them and we discount them.
[57:28.800 --> 57:30.800]  It's just an incredibly good deal.
[57:30.800 --> 57:32.800]  We sell a lot of it.
[57:32.800 --> 57:42.800]  Brain Force Plus, infowarstore.com, 4.6 stars, 8000 plus reviews, infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.

[57:44.800 --> 57:46.800]  Please take action.
[57:46.800 --> 57:48.800]  Please fund the Second American Revolution.
[57:48.800 --> 58:06.800]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[58:06.800 --> 58:16.800]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[58:16.800 --> 58:25.800]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[58:25.800 --> 58:27.800]  There's nothing else like it.

[58:35.800 --> 58:37.800]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[58:37.800 --> 58:38.800]  It lasts 10 hours.
[58:38.800 --> 58:45.800]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[58:45.800 --> 58:47.800]  Turbo Force at M4sLive.com.

[59:49.800 --> 01:00:10.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:14.800]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:25.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, the White House confirms President Trump is planning to annihilate the deep state.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.800]  He's planning to go nuclear.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:34.800]  He's planning to use all the evidence and all the intel he has to roll up their criminal operations.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:40.800]  This is going to be a day long remember, but the president and this republic are now entering the prime zone of danger.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.800]  They're going to try to assassinate the president.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:47.800]  That's why it's vital that this information, this report, get out to everyone right now.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:50.800]  Our futures depend on it.
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:01:00.800]  Now, in the days of MasterCurve where 40 plus people died at the hands of a lunatic who said he wanted to cause a global race war.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.800]  He said he was creating a false flag to make people kill each other.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:11.800]  And I said, but you watch when the week of Easter comes, all over Europe, all over Asia, all over the Middle East, all over Africa.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:17.800]  Christian churches will be burned and bombed starting on Palm Sunday.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:21.800]  And they will be shot up and they will be brought to the ground.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.800]  And you can actually pull it up.
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.800]  Just type in Alex Jones, conspiracies after Christchurch.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:27.800]  Media matters.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.800]  You name it, CNN.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:38.800]  Jones claims that the media is overreporting on Christchurch, but will ignore supposed made up bombings that Muslims are going to be carrying out.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:47.800]  And then of course, like clockwork, 800 plus churches have been burned in France or blown up this year alone.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.800]  Thousands across Europe, hundreds across the Middle East.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.800]  And there have been stabbings and bombings and shootings at churches all over the world.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:58.800]  But you've got to go read deep into the local regional news to find it.
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:09.800]  Except in Sri Lanka, the most religious country arguably in the world after Tibet, 99% of the people living there believe in God.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.800]  And they've only got a 9% Muslim population.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.800]  Oh, but guess what?
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.800]  It doesn't matter.
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:26.800]  Because even the BBC and Al Jazeera, the articles are up on enforce.com says it's Islamophobic, something made up by the Muslim Brotherhood.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.800]  You damn right, I'm Islamophobic.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.800]  Muslims have invaded the whole world.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:35.800]  They always hit 10% and start bombing.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.800]  It's their orders from Muhammad.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:45.800]  Burning, bombings, stabbing, raping, kidnapping, when they hit the magic number, 10%.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:51.800]  And Sri Lanka is now, according to the latest census, a year ago at 9.6.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:56.800]  And Muslims breed faster than anybody else on earth, their religion does, an average of over five kids.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.800]  So you know the new census when it comes out will show about 10.5%.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.800]  And right when they pass the 10%, bombings them soon.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.800]  And then they push you out of the enclaves.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.800]  They always target a smaller minority than them.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:11.800]  They bomb that group.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.800]  The Christians are only 7%.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:18.800]  So they'll drive them out of the country, out of their neighborhoods, and then they'll move on to the next group.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.800]  So that's how the operation works.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.800]  It's a program.
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:27.800]  Like you go to a play and you open it up and it's got three acts.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.800]  You're like, oh, they're, they're hitting 10%, oh no.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.800]  The bombings will start just like India.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.800]  Got invaded 1200 years ago by Islam.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.800]  It was all Buddhist or Hindu.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:42.800]  And now the second largest religion is Islam.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:47.800]  And the areas on the map, no non Muslims.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:48.800]  All out.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.800]  But it's okay because it's a liberal.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:58.800]  And so there's been some reportage that four hotels got attacked in churches and people dining.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:04.800]  But remember what I said over and over again when they were having calls to prayer,
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:11.800]  not just here, but all over the world after the tragic New Zealand attack that killed 49 people.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.800]  And we were hearing that Christianity and white people are inherently evil and the greatest terrorist.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:22.800]  Did it live stream part of it, which we're obviously not showing because of who these people were.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:28.800]  He did it because of the God they worshiped and because of the threat he seemed to think they posed to the white race.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.800]  Islam is peaceful.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:35.800]  And I'm like, thousands of churches blown up a year, hundreds blown up a year in the Middle East,
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.800]  fire bombed 800 plus bombed or burned down in France.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.800]  And there's almost no coverage of it.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:48.800]  And I said, you watch you come Palm Sunday right through Easter.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:52.800]  There's going to be bombings and shootings and killings all over the world.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:05:21.800]  And there were.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.800]  Again, we've got four or five places we want to build a lot of new secret projects going on.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:33.800]  The point is if you want to build freedom in this country and promote free speech and you want to help info wars,
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.800]  go to the next level.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.800]  We want to hire you.

[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.800]  The start of episode four.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.800]  That's what you're going to be doing.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.800]  This is the real ticket to a venture.

[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:07.800]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:11.800]  Well, Mayor de Blasio.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:14.800]  Looking live there at the White House lawn.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:20.800]  And Alex Jones, the controversial host, Trump's supporter out there with a bullhorn.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:22.800]  And that's what you heard earlier.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.800]  Some people out there as well saying they support President Trump, but they don't support Twitter.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:32.800]  President Trump meeting with the CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey here at the White House today.
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.800]  Kind of hear the bullhorn in the background.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:39.800]  Thought we'd show you what was happening.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:43.800]  Coming up, Mayor de Blasio has a plan to ban meat.
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.800]  Beef.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.800]  That's right.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:46.800]  Put a big tax on it.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.800]  Restrict it.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.800]  Cut its consumption by half.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.800]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.800]  It never ends.
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:56.800]  And this big green takeover movement of AOC couldn't get it done nationwide.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.800]  She successfully ran off amazon.com.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.800]  Well, they'll definitely run the rest of their population off.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:11.800]  I've got more big articles out today about how there's record exoduses out of all the blue states and blue cities.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:17.800]  And that's just doesn't care because they'll get to buy up all the property cheap once that collapse happens.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.800]  That's exactly what we're dealing with here.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:27.800]  But really some of the biggest news is the fact that people don't have a memory.
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:39.800]  And that I searched engine today on Google news and I didn't see anybody saying these are fake polls because they were faking 2016.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.800]  In 2018, every major polling agency got it wrong.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.800]  On average, they gave Hillary a 10 point lead over Trump.
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.800]  The New York Times gave her a 98% lead.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.800]  So did CNN.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.800]  They rigged it all.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:59.800]  CNN would have polls where they would add 40% more sampling rate of Democrats than Republicans.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:08.800]  Well, of course, if you interview 40% more Democrats than Republicans, you're going to have Hillary getting 60 something percent against Trump.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:13.800]  It's insane how dumb they think we are.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.800]  Even real clear politics reported.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:22.800]  WikiLeaks shows how Clinton campaign rigged the polls by over sampling Democrats.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:23.800]  We're going to review all that.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.800]  But why not just hear from creepy Joe Biden?
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:34.800]  Joe Biden launches his campaign on the lie that Trump said neo-Nazis were very fine people.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:47.800]  You know, I wondered why when Charlottesville happened almost two years ago now, right after Trump got into office, I got sued.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:09:03.800]  And the suit against myself, Leigh Ann McAdoo, Lee Stranahan, former congressman and others said that we said that the Democrats killed the woman who had a heart attack.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.800]  Had a heart attack or got bumped by a car.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:21.800]  No, we said that the police stood down, herded the white supremacist and journalist and just bystanders, it's called Keddling, into Antifa and allowed them to attack creating a hysterical melee.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.800]  Like if you yelled fire to theater.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:33.800]  They said George Soros was guilty by funding this and the police by standing down, which they admitted they did, were guilty of letting this riot take place.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.800]  And so the Democrats were guilty.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.800]  Oh, I got sued.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:47.800]  And they said that I said that an individual who worked for Hillary in the State Department, that he had killed her.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.800]  That's not what I said.
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.800]  It's not what Leigh Stranahan said.
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.800]  It's not what anybody said.
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.800]  But it just doesn't matter.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.800]  The suit goes forward, but it'll all come out.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:00.800]  They're just going to make us pay to go through court and have the cases and do the depositions.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.800]  And that's when all this stuff disintegrates.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:05.800]  Because what they put in these filings isn't true.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:14.800]  And the University of Georgetown, the Vatican, their free speech clinic is financing the suit.
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:22.800]  Now, half the suit got cut out, the claim of intentional emotional distress.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:28.800]  And so it's, that's the process as the judges let it go four or five steps is what my lawyers told me.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:39.800]  But there's nothing there, unless with the Sandy Hook lawsuits and the Virginia lawsuit, Charlottesville, they want to completely get rid of the First Amendment.
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:45.800]  And what's scary is, Clarence Thomas of all people came out a month ago in the New York Times,
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.800]  op-ed and said, it's time to get rid of New York Times versus Sullivan.
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:11:00.800]  And I'd just gotten a visit by some high-powered folks hooked into the Blue Blood Republican Party and a former president telling me that this was about to happen.
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:16.800]  And that I should just step out of the way and let them, let the Democrats stick their head in this and that basically I'd be taking care of.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.800]  Wow, like I'm that scared of these lawsuits.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.800]  I came from Access TV.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.800]  I'm not worried about money.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:23.800]  I'm not worried about any of this.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.800]  I want to stay on air and expose all these lies and I will.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:36.800]  That's why they're trying all this procedural stuff in these lawsuits, claiming we haven't given them documents, claiming we haven't given them the Sandy Hook marketing material.
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:40.800]  That's like saying, give us the puff the magic dragon marketing material.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.800]  Everyone knows my marketing material.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:50.800]  I or Tim Fruget writes a memo about the quality of a product and we talked to scientists and doctors about the claims we can make.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:56.800]  Or I tell you about a t-shirt or I tell you about a water filter or some heirloom seeds or a book or a video.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:02.800]  I go, we're selling this book or this video.
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:03.800]  It's really good.
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:04.800]  I saw it.
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.800]  Buy it at infowarstore.com.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.800]  That's how we fund ourselves.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:16.800]  We went out one of the top manufacturers in the country and private labeled the best fish oil and ours is lower than what you'll find in major stores.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.800]  Please buy it.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.800]  That's the marketing.
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:21.800]  The news isn't marketing.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:22.800]  We don't go in a meeting.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.800]  How are we going to market the covering Joe Biden?
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:31.800]  I read news articles, we get clips together and then I talk about creepy Joe and what a fraud he is.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.800]  That's it.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:39.800]  But again, they want to brand it that we're like them because CNN had a marketing plan for Russiagate.
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.800]  The Democrats have a marketing plan to sue me and then put out their talking points.
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:48.800]  They think we're like them, a bunch of robots that just follow orders.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.800]  No, that's not who we are.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.800]  But enough of that.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.800]  Let's go ahead and go to creepy.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:57.800]  Trump's calling him sleepy.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.800]  I think he's creepy.
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:08.800]  But here's creepy Joe Biden saying that Trump said that the white supremacists were good.
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.800]  Where's the clip?
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:12.800]  You don't have it.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.800]  Trump said there were good people on both sides and bad people, which is what Homeland Security told him.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:21.800]  There was a lot of right-wingers, some white supremacists, some midst, a bunch of leftists, some of them nice, some of them bad, Antifa.
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.800]  Antifa started the fight, the police made them collide together.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.800]  That's what Trump said.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.800]  That turns into Trump's white supremacists.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:31.800]  So they think this lie got exposed a year and a half ago.
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:32.800]  We exposed it.
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:33.800]  So they got pissed.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:38.800]  We got the middle of their talking points that we were going to point out that the Democrats did orchestrate this.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:44.800]  And we got documents showing that Democrats had orchestrated other riots in Maryland, which would be very powerful in court.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.800]  And specifically Soros and his son Alexander.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:54.800]  And so their response is to sue me building a straw man saying something I didn't say.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:00.800]  Because they were planning to run in 2020 on Charlottesville and on Sandy Hook.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:01.800]  And they now admit it.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.800]  Here it is.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:10.800]  Charlottesville, Virginia is home to the author of one of the great documents in human history.
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:12.800]  We know it by heart.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.800]  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.800]  That all men are created equal.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.800]  Endowed by their creator with certain inhaling.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.800]  Did pause.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:24.800]  I'm going to come back from break and play all this because this is going to take too long to go through it.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.800]  And then Millie Weaver, who was at Charlottesville and was physically attacked by the leftist,
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:33.800]  just trying to cover it and call the white supremacist, she's going to be on with us.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.800]  We've got some other shocking footage of new leftist attacks that haven't even aired yet we're going to get to.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.800]  Notice he's talking about Thomas Jefferson.
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.800]  Thomas Jefferson inherited slaves.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.800]  He tried to end slavery.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.800]  And then he had a girlfriend that was black.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.800]  The leftists say he's a rapist.
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.800]  But the point is he tried to end that system and he did help do it.
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:56.800]  His idea is it did down the road.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:02.800]  But here is Biden quoting Thomas Jefferson, the founder of the Democratic Party,
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.800]  when the rest of the party says tear down his statues and get rid of him.
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:11.800]  He's going to go to the right while all the other leftists promise you free tuition, free health care,
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:18.800]  free reparations, free college, free living wage, everything.
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.800]  He's going to run an old fashioned blue collar Democrat.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:26.800]  We're going to take care of it because he knows that's the people in the swing states getting drunk elected.
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:27.800]  But it's a fraud.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.800]  He presided over the sellout of the country and the deindustrialization of this nation.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.800]  Trump is fought to reverse that.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:40.800]  Joe Biden, creepy Joe Biden, sleepy Joe Biden is globalist Joe Biden and he is the problem.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.800]  When we come back, Charlottesville, that's all they're hanging their hat on,
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.800]  is some event where they had a bunch of leftist attack,
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:52.800]  a bunch of right wingers and white supremacists that had a big melee.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:16:00.800]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.800]  Hey guys, it's Scott Bauer here, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy.

[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:00.800]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure,
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.800]  and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you,
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:05.800]  but the symptoms are there.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:08.800]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops,
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.800]  poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.800]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:17.800]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.800]  in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.800]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.800]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.800]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.800]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.800]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.800]  should be using this product as a preventative
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:58.800]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:02.800]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman and child
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.800]  that has supported this broadcast over the years
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.800]  and that has stood with us.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:09.800]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates,
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.800]  but I'll tell you like it is.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:13.800]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.800]  You're our only sponsors.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:19.800]  And when you don't buy the products, they're absolutely the best out there.
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:21.800]  We aren't able to continue on.
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.800]  So remember, you are the info war.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.800]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.800]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.800]  We've got giant specials running right now
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.800]  at infowarstore.com that are unprecedented.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.800]  You go there and buy great products that you already need.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.800]  From across the board, it funds the Second American Revolution worldwide.
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:42.800]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.800]  I want to encourage you again.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:48.800]  Go to infowarstore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.800]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.800]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:19:04.800]  God bless you.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:36.800]  InfoWars Life's cutting edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:40.800]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon,
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:51.800]  but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:57.800]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:32.800]  InfoWars Life's cutting edge formula only brings you the highest quality organic and clinically studied ingredients.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:52.800]  I want to thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:21:02.800]  He took the risk. He became president and now we should be applauding that and the fact that he wasn't implicated in the Russiagate hoax should be a point of admiration.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:05.800]  What more can I do, Alex? What more can I do?
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:08.800]  Oh, it's Joe Biden. I think Joe Biden's in the house.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.800]  Oh, I feel him creeping up my spine.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:15.800]  Trump 2 is right around the corner. We're ready to go here in D.C. Trump International. Let's do it.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:26.800]  I ran into Max Kaiser, who I haven't seen over here.
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:33.800]  I walk in to the Trump International Hotel and I'm checking in.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:38.800]  I go, that looks like Max Kaiser, but I'm sitting there drinking a beer where they're bowling.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:48.800]  I walk in, bowling holds court right there when you first walk in and he's drinking a Stella, or at least something a Stella glass, and I get one.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:51.800]  And I'm like, that's Max Kaiser over there.
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.800]  I'm going to go talk to him, but then I forget. That's how my brain works.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:01.800]  So I'm busy and I'm getting my bags, but to go in 20 minutes later, Max runs over and then I ran into a bunch of other people.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:12.800]  And again, I ran into, well, I didn't run into edits of interviews and some of the things, but I talked to three people that are on record to be very close to the president,
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:24.800]  that work in the White House, that do braveings for the White House, that talked to President routinely, who wrote the briefing for the president on Internet censorship project,
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:31.800]  and they said, no, he's going after him and he's not going to stop.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:36.800]  And it looks like Barr and everybody understand that this is so egregious, they tend to overthrow the election.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.800]  Remember what Barr said a few weeks ago, he testified.
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:48.800]  He said, you know, it's really dangerous when a political party's in power and it tries to spy on the other party and candidates and then tries to overthrow elections.
[01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.800]  That's what ends countries.
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:56.800]  And he goes, and it did go on because they have all the intel.
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:00.800]  The Justice Department has all the NSA stuff.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:03.800]  They know Trump has it all.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:06.800]  And he's sitting back basically like a hundred card decks.
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:16.800]  And the globalists have a couple of wands, a couple of fours, a couple of queens, maybe a joker.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:22.800]  In fact, all they've got is a handful of jokers to bluff.
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.800]  And Trump's got hundreds of card decks.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.800]  He can just pull out nothing but eights of spades if he wants.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:30.800]  He can have all the royal flushes he wants.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.800]  Royal flush, royal flush, royal flush, royal flush.
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.800]  But he's got to play the royal flush.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:41.800]  He has them dead in the sights.
[01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:48.800]  All he has to do politically, metaphysically is squeeze the trigger and not hesitate.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:56.800]  So all you got to do to be a good shot, stay on target and then squeeze just lovingly.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:01.800]  And we're going to beat these people.
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:10.800]  It doesn't mean we still won't have immorality or smartphones brain damaging our kids or STD spreading and homeless pooping everywhere.
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.800]  It's like the pooping's gone up a hundred percent since last year in San Francisco.
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:18.800]  I saw a report and there's just feces everywhere.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.800]  I mean, we've got some problems.
[01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:30.800]  But at least we don't have to have cackling Hillary that when countries try to work with us and turn all their money and all their everything over to us,
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:36.800]  we then betray them and blow their country up and put al-Qaeda in charge like Libya.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:39.800]  No one will ever work with us after that with somebody like Hillary.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.800]  They won't trust us.
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:42.800]  That's stupid.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.800]  That gives all our soft power away.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.800]  But that's what the globalists want.
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:51.800]  They want to undermine the United States while they suck us dry and Trump doesn't want that.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:25:01.800]  But here comes Joe Biden, their savior, with his disgusting announcement speech where he invoked Charlottesville,
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:15.800]  where four of the five white supremacist leaders all have parents through Democrats and within a year to two years before we're working for Obama or Hillary.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:20.800]  And then now they just dress up in white supremacist outfits and they go and say we're having a big rally.
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.800]  So everybody shows up to cover it.
[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:27.800]  And then my own Millie Weaver gets called a white supremacist and gets pepper sprayed.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:35.800]  And the police kettle them and herd them in to the antifa or a bunch of professors in black outfits to attack them.
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:36.800]  And then a woman gets scared.
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:37.800]  A guy gets scared.
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:38.800]  She gets run over.
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.800]  She tragically dies.
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:43.800]  And then they say Trump says white supremacist are good people.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:49.800]  No, he said some good people on the one side, some good people on the other, some bad on the other, some bad on the other.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:50.800]  That's what he said.
[01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:51.800]  We all know what he said.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.800]  He said this was a political clash.
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.800]  And they said, no, no, you are to blame.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:01.800]  Because Trump pragmatically said what it was, except he should have gone further.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:03.800]  The Democrats staged it.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:06.800]  They go, oh, we're suing you for saying we killed the woman.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:12.800]  George Soros and the police standing down created the atmosphere, the climate that was inducing for that.
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:19.800]  And yes, you were negligent consciously to try to get the political explosion you were counting on.
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.800]  Yes, the death is on your hands.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:32.800]  Obama, Hillary, Soros, Alexander Soros, not a Democrat cameraman whose work for Hillary, who we just said, look how it's perfect.
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.800]  They got a bunch of leftists there.
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.800]  The leftists knew the conflagration was coming.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.800]  They knew the collapse was coming.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:40.800]  They knew the explosion was coming.
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.800]  Doesn't mean they, the individuals killed the woman.
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:44.800]  But then they twist.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:50.800]  And then in my name, say that I say some guy killed the woman and then he sues me.
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.800]  You see how it works?
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.800]  You see how it works?
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:57.800]  We keep the baby alive in Virginia.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.800]  Then we get them little juicy organs.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:09.800]  He's not the villain, the governor talking like this, the sweet southern voice, little blood ball, little flesh ball.
[01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:10.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:12.800]  He's the bad one everywhere.
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.800]  He questions things.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.800]  Like why was the governor in blackface?
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.800]  It raises the question that...
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.800]  Let's get started with Biden. Here it is.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:30.800]  Charlottesville, Virginia is home to the author of one of the great documents in human history.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.800]  We know it by heart.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.800]  We hold these truths to be self-evident.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:35.800]  We know it by heart.
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.800]  That all men are created equal.
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:38.800]  Endowed by their creation.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.800]  He passed laws to get black people three times the time in prison.
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.800]  We've heard it so often.
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:43.800]  It's almost a cliche.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.800]  But it's who we are.
[01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.800]  We haven't always lived up to these ideals.
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.800]  Jefferson himself didn't.
[01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:52.800]  But we have never before walked away from them.
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:58.800]  Charlottesville is also home to a defining moment for this nation in the last few years.
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:04.800]  Bunch of Democrats dressed up like Nazis.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:10.800]  In August of 2017, we saw Klansmen and white supremacists and neo-Nazis come out in the open.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:12.800]  Hit pause.
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:13.800]  I mean, I'm gonna call it.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:16.800]  I say half those people are Jesse Smallitz.
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:17.800]  Remember Rand Paul?
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.800]  He was gonna win in the Senate?
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:24.800]  And I said, look into who that Democrat is dressed like a Nazi, saying he hates Mexicans and all this stuff.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.800]  It turned out he worked on the staff of the campaign.
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:28.800]  We know who you are.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.800]  We know what you do.
[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:32.800]  Were there some real Klans people there?
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:33.800]  Yeah.
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:34.800]  I'm sure.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:42.800]  But the leadership are a bunch of dirty, filthy art department, theater department people who joined evil.
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:43.800]  Period.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:47.800]  And waiting was the police and Antifa for the show.
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:48.800]  Disgusting.
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.800]  It'll all come out.
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:52.800]  You'll be hoisted on your own petard.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:56.800]  You'll fall on the pit you dug for me in the name of Jesus.
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:58.800]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:02.800]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.800]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:06.800]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:11.800]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:12.800]  I can help you too.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.800]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:18.800]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.800]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:26.800]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.800]  Forget bunkers.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:35.800]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:37.800]  You need survivalist camps.
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:45.800]  The ultimate fully functional off-the-grid mobile survival bug outhouse that's well equipped and custom built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.800]  Bold statement, you bit.

[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.800]  You're our only sponsors.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:18.800]  And when you don't buy the products, they're absolutely the best out there.
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:20.800]  We aren't able to continue on.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:23.800]  So remember, you are the Info War.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:24.800]  I'm not the leader.
[01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:25.800]  You are the leader.

[01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:18.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:23.800]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:34.800]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:43.800]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.
[01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:47.800]  We've heard it so often, it's almost a cliche, but it's who we are.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:54.800]  We haven't always lived up to these ideals. Jefferson himself didn't, but we have never before walked away from them.
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:05.800]  Charlottesville is also home to a defining moment for this nation in the last few years.
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:14.800]  It was there on August of 2017 we saw clansmen and white supremacists and neo-nazis come out in the open.
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:21.800]  They're crazed faces, illuminated by tortures, veins bulging and burying the fangs of racism.
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:26.800]  Chanting the same anti-semitic bile heard across Europe in the past.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:32.800]  Alex hit pause. If you actually look at all these men and look at their behavior and look at how they're acting.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:43.800]  This is the acting club and this is the drama club from surrounding universities and, I mean, it's basically a giant gay dress-up party
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:49.800]  with a bunch of gay men dressed up as Nazis in their giant Jesse Smollett event.
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:56.800]  Nothing against gay men, but a lot of them are into theater, they're into flamboyancy and this is how you strike back against Trump if you're Jesse Smollett or them.
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:03.800]  You dress up and you go out and you get your little white supremacist outfit and they all tell each other how to dress
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:12.800]  and they get their little tiki torches, just like the State Department funded Nazi grips with tiki torches over in Ukraine.
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:17.800]  And you do this. This is political theater. And I've had the leaders of it on.
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:23.800]  Like, yes, I wasn't a big Obama supporter until a year ago or yes, I was for Hillary until now.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:33.800]  But my, Alex, you're so handsome today. And again, look, I understand the gay guys are thinking they got to go fight Trump or whatever and they've got to fight the racism.
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:40.800]  But this is really bad. I mean, this is really out of control. And that's what it is.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:45.800]  Now, there's some real white supremacists that joined the group. I see some real Klan guys out there like Hillbilly.
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:51.800]  We're going to do something. Black people. Yeah, there was a few of those.
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:36:00.800]  The vast majority go to the local colleges and they dressed up as Nazis to go out and do this.
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:06.800]  I mean, just look at the footage. It's ridiculous. And I've been sued for saying that.
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:11.800]  Not saying that they're staging it. Saying that some guy who worked for Hillary,
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:15.800]  that we just pointed out, look at all these Hillary operatives there, that he killed the woman.
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:22.800]  Never said that. Just made up crap. We're not going to sit by for the Jesse Smollett crap anymore. It's over.
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:29.800]  Oh, but don't worry. The directors and folks at Empire saying they're bringing Jesse Smollett back. Of course they are.
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:38.800]  I was in the airport at 4.30 a.m. this morning, getting ready to board an aircraft and fly back to Austin.
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:44.800]  I'd let the rest of Chris stay behind and get some shut eye. And only my security guy went with me.
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:53.800]  And I sat there and I watched Brian Williams on the television set for 30 minutes before we boarded.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:37:02.800]  Talk about Trump and obstruction and still being a Russian agent. Brian Williams said he got shot down by a rocket propelled grenade and the helicopter blew up.
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:09.800]  And it was all a lie. He wasn't even shot at. Hillary did it too. They staged stuff. They lie.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:16.800]  And even if, even if all those little nilly waddling, I mean, you know, there were types of gay guys.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:25.800]  You got the big tough guy guys. You got the little sissy ones. And you go see all the little sissy flamer guys going, uh, Hitler, we love him.
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:34.800]  Uh, uh, uh, Trump, we love Trump. Uh, uh, uh, uh. I mean, give me a break, man.
[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:40.800]  It's like the cops with Jesse Smollett. Yeah, roll some of the video in the background with that audio. Just show them these people.
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:52.800]  Jesse Smollett, two 30 in the morning goes out to a subway. It's freezing 25 below zero and men in red hats with a noose and bleach are waiting to put it around his neck and beat him up.
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:38:00.800]  And then say, this is my country. Get out of here, boy. And all this racist crap. And the police get to his house an hour later.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:08.800]  He's got a noose still hanging around his neck, fake cuts on his face. And they're just like, but he's telling him he kicked their ass.
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:13.800]  Two dudes, they're going to attack you in the middle of the night. Just you're going to kick their ass. No problem when they attack you.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:25.800]  It's the police. No BS when they hear it. Well, anybody can look at the footage of a bunch of unless all the Nazis are Nellie effeminate gay guys.
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:29.800]  I mean, maybe, maybe not suddenly Nazis are all gay. A lot of them are actually gay in Nazi Germany.
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:35.800]  Ernst Rome and most brown shirts are actually a gay cult. The pink swastika look into it.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:39.800]  So maybe it's true. Maybe they all converted from being Obama supporters a year before.
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:44.800]  They should all happen to be in the theater department and they all happen to wear the same outfits and the same Tiki torches.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:52.800]  And they all just run around like, I mean, you look at the bottom. Look at how the guys are running. Oh, yeah, we're going to find.
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:59.800]  Oh, we're Nazis. Oh, look, Nazis are marching everywhere.
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:05.800]  I can't wait to depose all these people. But that's why we need award chest, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:08.800]  I am looking forward to the Charlottesville thing to expose what really happened.
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:13.800]  I'm looking forward more and more to the Sandy Hook thing and the depositions and all the rest of it.
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:16.800]  I see you to get dialed in on who was who, who was running what.
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:18.800]  We know what law firms are running and who's funding it.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:22.800]  We have all the intel we're now hooked in and we've got intel on them.
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:27.800]  And so I've been advised by high level forces that we need to just go ahead and get into this.
[01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:31.800]  They've really miscalculated, but it's going to take funds, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:36.800]  We've gotten 17 of their lawsuits thrown out. We've got about like three lawsuits.
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:39.800]  They followed three more, but they know we're fighting them all now.
[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:45.800]  I need everybody listening. All these awesome folks I run into say, oh, I used to listen to the whole time.
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:52.800]  I can't find you now. Yeah, because I'm off all the platforms except infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and newswars.com
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:58.800]  where you can go and buy the best toothpaste, the best fish oil, the best new tropics,
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:02.800]  the best t-shirts, the best books, the best films, the best seeds, the best water filtration.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:10.800]  It's all right there. Get stuff you need and then just war chest us because politically we're winning.
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:14.800]  But this operation funding wise is not in the best place.
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:17.800]  It's it's not election year. A lot of things are going on.
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:22.800]  I want to expand, but I need people to belly up to the information warfare bar.
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:26.800]  I need you to take advantage. They have not gotten rid of 50% off all apparel,
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:29.800]  even though that was posted in a day or so ago because we're so out of most of it.
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:33.800]  That's go up for whatever reason. I didn't get to indicate that properly, but that's fine.
[01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.800]  Take action on that where your color is loud and proud.
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:39.800]  A lot of amazing new shirts. Just go tourism infowars.com.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:42.800]  But the big new sale is we never done this before.

[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:16.800]  Even Democrats put in fake reviews. It's 90% on other sites.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:21.800]  It's a top new tropic reformulated. It's basically a copy of a top brand out there,
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:25.800]  but they're even stronger at half the price. When we discount it, it's even better.
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:27.800]  It's 25% off in the combo.
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:33.800]  So you get 25% off on brain force plus and you get a bottle of knock out to try it out.

[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:28.800]  $50 off the Alexa pure breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology.
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:31.800]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:35.800]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:39.800]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five star reviews for yourself.
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:44.800]  I've got two in my home. You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:47.800]  with the Alexa pure breeze in your house.
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:53.800]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home. Have clean air.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:45:18.800]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:28.800]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:30.800]  and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:34.800]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter.
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:37.800]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:41.800]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:46.800]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:52.800]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:57.800]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:00.800]  Our grandparents, our great grandparents, know that they can food.
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:03.800]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:06.800]  And that's what I'm talking about at infowarstore.com.
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:11.800]  With infowar select, it's the full spectrum of my patriot supply

[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:28.800]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.800]  Millie Weaver is about to join us.
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:34.800]  She's a great reporter for infowarstore.com.
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:38.800]  And she was there with her husband and crew in Charlottesville.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.800]  And she was attacked by Antifa.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:43.800]  And then she was pepper sprayed by the police.
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.800]  And then she got called a white supremacist like Laura Loomer is Jewish
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:53.800]  and hates Nazis has been, or Avi and Emanie or so many other people.
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:57.800]  It's just getting crazier and crazier and crazier.
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:02.800]  But here's a report she filed back at the time about what really happened in Charlottesville
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:09.800]  that Biden's now running on and saying that Trump endorsed the few white supremacists
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:10.800]  that were there.
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:14.800]  And I think I saw a few real Klan types, real hilly billy types.
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:16.800]  You can't fake those types.
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:17.800]  I've scanned all the footage.
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:19.800]  I probably, 20% were probably real.
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:24.800]  The others were, again, local college acting clubs.
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:27.800]  Oh, by the way, I'm not saying Sandy Hook was crisis actors.
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:31.800]  And I'm not saying Florida was because we didn't find evidence of that.
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:36.800]  There were ads put out by national crisis actor groups where the left actually
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:38.800]  hires people for their demonstrations.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.800]  That's a big business.
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:42.800]  That's been around these 20 years.
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:46.800]  You can go online and find more than 50 groups nationally and regionally
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:48.800]  where you can hire a group of protesters.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:52.800]  It's not, again, they don't want this looked into.
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:54.800]  It doesn't mean a woman didn't really die.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:57.800]  We're not saying that any of the participants actively killed the woman.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:01.800]  We're saying they created a climate with Soros' funding and the police
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:05.800]  heading down that did it to demonize Trump and to demonize any opposition to
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:07.800]  Trump as Nazi, which we know they're doing.
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:13.800]  What really happened in Charlottesville, here's Millie Weaver's report and we'll go to her.
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:15.800]  Hi, I'm Millie Weaver.
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:20.800]  I'm a reporter for InfoWars and the reason I brought this microphone up here
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:25.800]  to show you guys is there have been so many times that I've been accosted,
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:32.800]  spit at, had urine thrown on me by rogue people, especially Antifa groups,
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:37.800]  radical communist leftist groups, because of the lies and propaganda that the
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:42.800]  mainstream media spews about InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:46.800]  So I get attacked because of these lies, physically attacked.
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:52.800]  Now, a lot of this lawsuit that's been put against Alex Jones in InfoWars
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:54.800]  surrounds Charlottesville.
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:56.800]  I was there in Charlottesville.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:50:01.800]  I was the InfoWars reporter on the ground reporting to you guys what happened.
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:06.800]  We all know that the mainstream media afterward decided to spin a
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:14.800]  biased, one-sided storyline that you had a bunch of rogue, KKK extremists
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:17.800]  come and attack a bunch of peaceful protesters out there.
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:23.800]  What I can tell you is that because I had the ability to livestream and to broadcast
[01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:28.800]  on social media, which those broadcasts went viral, I was able to show what
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:32.800]  exactly actually happened out there in Charlottesville.
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:37.800]  There was violence on both sides, but I will say the overwhelming majority
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:44.800]  of the violence was coming from the Antifa leftist anti-protestors,
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.800]  the ones protesting people who were out there trying to stand up for
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:49.800]  protecting a statue.
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:54.800]  And yes, there were rogue elements on both sides, but one side came with
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:51:00.800]  pepper spray, tear gas canisters, ice chest full of water balloons with
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:06.800]  chemicals and urine and feces in them to throw, and that was depicted and caught
[01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:11.800]  through my ability to livestream, broadcast on Facebook, on YouTube,
[01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:15.800]  on these social media sites that they want to remove us from.
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:19.800]  I got the truth out there with Charlottesville, while at the same time
[01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:24.800]  myself and my cameraman especially were pepper spray in the face for being
[01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:25.800]  InfoWars.
[01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:30.800]  I made it clear to both the Antifa and some of the radical elements on
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:35.800]  the alternative right side that we did not agree with any of their
[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:39.800]  positions, but what I told them was, I do agree with your right to free
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:40.800]  speech.
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:44.800]  Both of you guys have a right to be out here and peacefully protest.
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:48.800]  That didn't stop us from being pepper spray and attacked because of the
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:51.800]  lies and the propaganda that the mainstream media spreads about us
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:52.800]  and InfoWars.
[01:51:52.800 --> 01:51:58.800]  That's why it's so important that we protect, repress, guerrilla journalists.
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:02.800]  All of us out here today who are in this room should understand and know
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:06.800]  the importance of our ability to go out there and tell the truth when
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:11.800]  sometimes the moral integrity of mainstream media is last.
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:13.800]  So bravo, Millie Weaver.
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:17.800]  That's such an important report from like a year and a half ago, and
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:22.800]  Leon McAdoo covered the same report she got sued by Georgetown University
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:27.800]  to silence us because the Democrat plan is to have leftists posing as
[01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:33.800]  Nazis, announce events, get real Nazis to come to it, all in blue cities.
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:36.800]  Then reporters will come to cover it.
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:38.800]  They'll all be called Nazis.
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:40.800]  They'll have Antifa attack.
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:43.800]  It'll create a melee and they'll claim a race for started.
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:44.800]  That's the MO.
[01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:50.800]  We got the secret documents in January of 2018 from the Soros group,
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:53.800]  from family members that got inside the Antifa.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:54.800]  Those documents are real.
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:55.800]  They've not contested them.
[01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:56.800]  How this is their plan.
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:53:00.800]  And that's why they don't want us on air or you on air when they try this
[01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:01.800]  in the next 18 months.
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:02.800]  But we will be there.
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:03.800]  They will not stop us.
[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:06.800]  Just like Jesse Smollett, you will be exposed.
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:08.800]  You will be exposed.
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:12.800]  And you hopefully won't be able in the crisis that Soros creates,
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:15.800]  because poor woman killed again or somebody else, my God.
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:17.800]  Millie, we were great to have you here with us.
[01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:21.800]  You saw Biden invoking this and attacking Trump to run on this.
[01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:24.800]  And I'm glad that you have the instincts to say, hey, I should come on
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:26.800]  and talk about this because you're absolutely right.
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:30.800]  You can see race war is what they're going to move from the whole
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:33.800]  Trump's a Russian agent to Trump is KKK now.
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:34.800]  Yeah.
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:38.800]  The Democrats are going to try to run based on that they have a better
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:43.800]  than Trump because they can't beat his policies and the fact that he has
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:48.800]  had real accomplishments on our economics and our job industries.
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:50.800]  So they're not even going to try to go there with him.
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:53.800]  They're going to be attacking his morality and his character.
[01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:56.800]  And one of the ways they're going to do that is continue to push that
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:00.800]  the Charlottesville thing was all these horrible radical racist,
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:03.800]  which yes, there were some racist groups there.
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:04.800]  Okay.
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:07.800]  But when Trump said there were good people on either side,
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:12.800]  that was actually true because there were regular onlookers and
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:16.800]  normal people who came there just to see what was happening or that
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:20.800]  wanted to just stand for the right for that statue to exist.
[01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:22.800]  And they weren't part of those groups.
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:25.800]  There were people on the left and the right that were decent people.
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:31.800]  They got hurt because of these adjut prop type groups that came there
[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:35.800]  ready to enact violence and essentially create this narrative that
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:38.800]  Trump was allowing civil unrest in the streets.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:40.800]  And I'll tell you what, I saw so many people.
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:44.800]  I mean, this looked like a deep state operation from the get go.
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:45.800]  I called it out from the get go.
[01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:49.800]  And then we started having people come out saying that they saw these
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:53.800]  groups getting off of buses like they were being bused in.
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:57.800]  And what I will say is this, the mainstream media doesn't even touch
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:02.800]  or cover the fact that these Antifa communist groups came there with
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:07.800]  tear gas canisters and water balloons full of feces and urine and
[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:08.800]  chemicals.
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:13.800]  They came ready to fight, ready to quote punch a Nazi in the face.
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:18.800]  So when Trump said there was violence happening from the left and the
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:19.800]  right, it's true.
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:20.800]  When he said that-
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:22.800]  Sure, they wanted Trump to say-
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:23.800]  It's true.
[01:55:23.800 --> 01:55:26.800]  They wanted Trump to say all conservatives are Nazis and they
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:30.800]  would have won the lie that way or then have them say that's not true.
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:32.800]  And they say he's a Nazi.
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:34.800]  But Millie, clearly they're planning this.
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:38.800]  All Trump's got to do is run TV ads showing Hillary Clinton saying
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:42.800]  that black people are dogs that we brought to heal and Joe Biden saying
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:45.800]  that we've got to put people in jail for three times the Senate's for
[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:48.800]  marijuana and then show Trump reversing those laws and just say,
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:51.800]  they claim I'm this racist, but they're the ones that passed the laws,
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:54.800]  the Democratic Party of the KKK, to give black people triple the
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:55.800]  Senate's.
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:56.800]  I got rid of those laws.
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:55:57.800]  I'm Donald Trump.
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:59.800]  That's what Trump needs.
[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:00.800]  Exactly.
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:03.800]  I mean, he needs more people like, for example, Candace Owens,
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:07.800]  who's been out there advocating for Trump as an African American.
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:10.800]  And they call her a white supremacist and play an edited tape in
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:12.800]  Congress that she likes Hitler.
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:14.800]  What I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:15.800]  It's crazy.
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:19.800]  These leftists have went and attacked her and threw water on her at
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:21.800]  restaurants, calling her a white supremacist.
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:25.800]  What more proof do we need than that these leftists just label anyone
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:29.800]  that disagrees with them as white supremacists because they can't
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:32.800]  handle that their policies can have a million holes poked through
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:33.800]  them.
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:35.800]  And that's what we're seeing with these Democrat candidates.
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:39.800]  Have you ever wondered why we're seeing now 20 Democrats running
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:41.800]  on the presidential ticket?
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:44.800]  It's because they're nervous because Trump is a very strong candidate.
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:47.800]  So they're going to have some kind of game of thrones amongst
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:50.800]  themselves to figure out who's the strongest contender.
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:55.800]  And they're all pushing virtually the same policies, give or take.
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:58.800]  And it's the same thing, but different, different wrapping paper.
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:03.800]  And Democrats think that Biden has the best wrapping paper.
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:06.800]  The establishment Democrats like him, they think that he's going to
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:10.800]  bring back a sense of order like they felt when they had Obama.
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:14.800]  They think that he seems more experienced because he was the
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:15.800]  vice president.
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:19.800]  The leftists are promising people goodies for 10 years from now when
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:20.800]  they're coming.
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:23.800]  But he's supposed to be the safe thing where everybody gets scared.
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:24.800]  Oh, don't go with Trump.
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:25.800]  Don't go with the commies go with me.
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:27.800]  But he's the one that's been laying this all out.
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:29.800]  I want to talk more about that with you, Millie Weaver, about where
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:32.800]  you think this is all going and the type of future Charlotte
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:33.800]  Vills.
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:35.800]  They're going to try to stage that we're going to be there covering.
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:40.800]  Oh, I'll have 20 reporters at these events because I know this is
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.800]  their plan, race war.
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:44.800]  And we're going to stop it together.
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:45.800]  Stay with us.
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:47.800]  Hour number three straight ahead.
[01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:53.800]  Force plus is a top tier new tropic focus, clarity, energy.
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:57.800]  But instead of having a seven times markup, we have a hundred and
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:00.800]  a 50% markup right now.
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:02.800]  It's massively discounted.

[01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:14.800]  I appreciate that.
[01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:15.800]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force?
[01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:16.800]  Tell us about it.
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:17.800]  Well, it's really great.
[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:18.800]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:19.800]  I take it.
[01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:20.800]  It tastes good.
[01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:21.800]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:23.800]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[01:59:23.800 --> 01:59:26.800]  And you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:27.800]  So I really like it.
[01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:29.800]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[01:59:29.800 --> 01:59:31.800]  They're known to turbo charge women.
[01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:33.800]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:36.800]  So yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:39.800]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:41.800]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[01:59:41.800 --> 02:00:10.800]  M4warsstore.com or AAA-2533139.
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:14.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:15.800]  Okay.
[02:00:15.800 --> 02:00:19.800]  We are back broadcasting on a bunch of radio stations and TV stations and m4wars.com and
[02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:20.800]  newswars.com.
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:22.800]  Weaver is in Flago as usual.
[02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:25.800]  And why are we obsessing over this?
[02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:30.800]  We knew that they're going to run in 2020 on Sandy Hook and on Charlottesville.
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:35.800]  They plan to have lawsuits going that they think they'll be winning during the last few
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:39.800]  months of the campaign and then putting that on Trump.
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:40.800]  We've been proven correct.
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:42.800]  That's the battle plan.
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:46.800]  And obviously the White House and others understand that battle plan.
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:53.800]  It's unbelievable because don't they know that when you try to hire a couple hundred theater
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:57.800]  students to go out and pose as Nazis, that that's not going to come out.
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:01.800]  They'd have the first Nazi event that's staged to then bring in the real Nazis.
[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:03.800]  There were real Nazis there.
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:07.800]  But all the main leaders of it were Democrats a year before they converted.
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:11.800]  And just like Jesse Smollett, they're going to be exposed.
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:14.800]  But that's why the Democrats had to protect Jesse Smollett and not charge him.
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:17.800]  He's been sued by the brothers that he paid.
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:20.800]  And they had the magazines that they cut out to send the threatening racist letters.
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:22.800]  And they have them going to all the shops.
[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:23.800]  They have him.
[02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:29.800]  But they can't charge him because this is their plan in 2020 starting now is to do this.
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:32.800]  That's why they didn't want me to say that Parkland was crisis actors, which I didn't
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:33.800]  think it was.
[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:38.800]  It's because they want everybody scared to say crisis actors because they're planning
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:40.800]  massive crisis actor operations.
[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:44.800]  And there were crisis actor companies that did hire and bring people to the demonstration.
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:46.800]  That was in the news, Millie.
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:50.800]  They don't mention that in the fake lawsuit against us where they make up stuff we didn't
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:51.800]  say.
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:52.800]  But that's the real reason.
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:53.800]  Well, guess what?
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:54.800]  We're not going to be shut down during that.
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:56.800]  Everyone knows what to look for, Millie.
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:01:57.800]  Exactly.
[02:01:57.800 --> 02:02:01.800]  And what many people don't even know about these Nazi groups is that many of these
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:04.800]  neo-Nazi groups have strong gang affiliations and gang ties.
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:09.800]  Many of them have been busted for selling methamphetamines and other drugs, which makes
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:12.800]  them very compromisable by the FBI.
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:16.800]  So it could be very likely that they have leaders in these organizations who have been
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:18.800]  compromised by the FBI.
[02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:19.800]  And that's why you have them.
[02:02:19.800 --> 02:02:20.800]  Millie, it's not probable.
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:25.800]  It's super famous that if you go to a Klan rally, half the people are federal agents
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:26.800]  trying to lead it.
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:29.800]  Even Texas Monthly did a report where there was no real Klan group in Texas.
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:33.800]  And the feds were out creating them, trying to get them to stage attacks so they could
[02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:35.800]  demonize right-wingers.
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:36.800]  Exactly.
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:40.800]  So, you know, we have tons of deep state operas there in Charlottesville.
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:45.800]  You've got these groups who we know are likely, you know, being compromised by the FBI for
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:46.800]  selling drugs.
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:51.800]  And then, of course, you have the alt-left groups, which at the time were probably George
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:53.800]  Soros funded.
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:57.800]  And these leftist groups are the ones antagonizing, creating the violence, stirring it up so
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:01.800]  that you would get the people on the right to react so that they could be demonized.
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:07.800]  And then, thus, they continue on with this legacy of nonstop attacking President Trump
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:08.800]  for Charlottesville.
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:12.800]  And I do believe that there is another one of these events that's likely to be happening
[02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:15.800]  in the future, because we've already heard talks about something happening in Dayton,
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:16.800]  Ohio.
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:19.800]  I'm not going to give too much details over the air about it.
[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:21.800]  But, I mean, we have to be on these things.
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:26.800]  We have to be able to have people there watching and taking note as real journalists.
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:31.800]  As to what happens to try to stop the narrative that the mainstream media is trying to create
[02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:35.800]  that Trump is creating divisiveness and racism in this country.
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:39.800]  That is the main thing that these Democrats are going to run on, because they know they
[02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:43.800]  cannot defeat him on policy.
[02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:47.800]  Millie, we just, we're trying to get the crew hired.
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:50.800]  You've done a great job with Caitlin Bennett and others.
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:54.800]  But I just, I feel like we're going to have to cover this.
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:57.800]  And next time we have these events, I'm going to be there with you and I'm going to bring
[02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:02.800]  at least 10 security people so we can kind of form a cordon or a phalanx so that they
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:04.800]  can't stage events and try to provocateur us.
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:08.800]  But I just feel like we've got to infiltrate these groups too.
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:13.800]  People at colleges, people in organizations, you can go and infiltrate these leftist groups
[02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:15.800]  that are posing as Nazis.
[02:04:15.800 --> 02:04:18.800]  They've been caught before and you could destroy them.
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:22.800]  And so please, we're counting on viewers and listeners to take action legally and lawfully.
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:24.800]  We can't do it all.
[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:25.800]  Exactly.
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:30.800]  I mean, we need people out there going and doing like what James O'Keefe did, starting
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:35.800]  up organizations where you go and out the corruption that's happening and the hoaxes that are being
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:41.800]  perpetuated mostly against Trump supporters.
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:45.800]  Millie, when we come back, I want to get into something you've been exposing.
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:48.800]  And that's drag queen story time.
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:52.800]  And all these men that are convicted of pedophiles being busted, being part of it.
[02:04:52.800 --> 02:05:21.800]  We'll talk about that straight ahead.
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:24.800]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:27.800]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:32.800]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in for us now.
[02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:39.800]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:41.800]  This country is in a war.
[02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:46.800]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos
[02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:51.800]  and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us in the 360 wind, we're dead in the water.
[02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:56.800]  I'm in your hands. You're in my hands. Infowarsstore.com. Thank you.
[02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:28.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:35.800]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:42.800]  So Millie is a mother of two. I'm a father of four.
[02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:46.800]  It took me a few years to figure this out and figure out what club kids were.
[02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:51.800]  I've had an affiliate movement out of New York City in the 80s and 90s, and that convicted murderer runs it.
[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:58.800]  And it took me time to figure out why are these drag queens on their own Facebooks at parties dressed like women
[02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:03.800]  and trying to look glamorous, but dressed in weird clown outfits and scary vampire outfits with kids?
[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:07.800]  Well, they like terrorizing the kids, but B, they want to cover up their identity.
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:12.800]  I mean, they're not all convicted child abusers, but a lot of them have been busted.
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:16.800]  A lot of them, we can put up some of the people that have been busted, just at one event down in Houston.
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:23.800]  Two of them separately rate six-year-old boys, and then they come under fake names.
[02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:29.800]  None have been arrested yet or had their parole withdrawn, though, but we've had some investigators look at other areas,
[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:36.800]  and that's going to be forthcoming soon in New York and other areas, but here it is out of Cleveland.com.
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:42.800]  A child drag show would be outlawed in a new Ohio bill, and they just say you're not going to take kids
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:46.800]  and have them stick money in the G-strings of men or women or anybody else.
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:52.800]  You're not going to have children perform, which they're doing all over at adult clubs where a kid couldn't go drink a beer,
[02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:54.800]  but they still do this.
[02:07:54.800 --> 02:08:01.800]  So this is beyond the creepiness of how pedophiles obviously get into the whole child actor movement
[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:06.800]  or the child fashion shows. I mean, everybody knows those horrors.
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:08.800]  This is the next level.
[02:08:08.800 --> 02:08:14.800]  House Bill 180 introduced earlier this month by Representative Tim Schaefer comes after online outrage over a video
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:21.800]  of Jacob Measley of suburban Toledo accepting money from onlookers while performing a drag charity event
[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:24.800]  held at a Fairfield County bar last month.
[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:29.800]  And, of course, we're talking about children that are dancing at the bars and being exploited.
[02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:36.800]  Given our heightened focus on human trafficking and the role money plays in trafficking, children, we had to take action.
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:40.800]  So Ohio trafficking investigation soared in the last few years.
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:46.800]  Ohio Bill introduced a band drag shows for involving sexualization of children.
[02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:48.800]  I mean, this is beyond creepy.
[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:53.800]  Look how horrified the children are in the photos when they're first being introduced by their parents
[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:59.800]  that have mass Stockholm syndrome or really have become demon-possessed in my view.
[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:01.800]  Poor little things. We just zoom in on this child.
[02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:06.800]  Even local news in Houston is like, the children try to run, but the parents teach them,
[02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:10.800]  you can run but you can't hide, get them while they're young.
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:12.800]  Poor little baby, look at that.
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:19.800]  So erotic dancer defense photo of child stuffing money in G-string.
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:24.800]  We'll play some of the video here because it's a family show, but after all this is happening to children.
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:25.800]  This is the new thing.
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:27.800]  Doubles down after deleting social media posts.
[02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:29.800]  We don't know what's a man, a woman.
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:31.800]  We don't know what it is.
[02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:37.800]  But the new article is up on infowars.com by Adon Salazar.
[02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:39.800]  And this is now what's happening.
[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:44.800]  So don't be surprised if you go to a strip club and three-year-olds are there.
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:52.800]  This is the new thing is children giving money to strangers who are naked or half-dressed.
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:58.800]  All part of blowing through social norms and preparing you for the final level of the new world order.
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:00.800]  After all, we're already killing babies after born.
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:07.800]  Millie Weber, as a mother, as a researcher, as an investigator, what do you and your husband think about this?
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:13.800]  It's shocking that it's even having to come to this, that we're actually having to have legislation put through
[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:18.800]  to protect these children from these crazy deranged liberal parents
[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:22.800]  that want to bring their kids to drag queen adult shows.
[02:10:22.800 --> 02:10:27.800]  Let alone let them participate in full makeup with scantily clothing on,
[02:10:27.800 --> 02:10:35.800]  dancing around in a seductive manner to a bunch of grown men or who knows trans men who are gawking at them.
[02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:42.800]  That's what I've seen and experienced when I went undercover and saw a drag festival in Austin, Texas.
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:49.800]  You saw all of these guys who literally looked like Johns and this was in a hotel conference center.
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:56.800]  And it's a bunch of kids as young as three, a little kid shaking their ass in front of men.
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:05.800]  Yes, and the Johns were, there was footage, which I don't think we ever published because we were so creeped out by the whole thing,
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:10.800]  but there was footage where it looked like some guy came up and groped the little boy who had performed.
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:13.800]  I saw that and I said, don't put it out, but I want you to go ahead and give that to me.
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:14.800]  I'm going to play it tomorrow.
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:18.800]  I mean, it's just, it's creepy what's going on here with these kids.
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:21.800]  The kids do not need to be put in that type of situation.
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:27.800]  And I know that liberals are going to go, oh, well, it's just, you know, you guys are homophobic or transphobic because you guys don't.
[02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:30.800]  No, we're pedophobic. We're pedophobic.
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:39.800]  Right, because they're going to say, oh, you don't speak out against those little child contestant, beauty contestant pageants or whatever.
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:43.800]  Well, actually, a lot of us do speak out and think these girls are being overly sexualized,
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:52.800]  but there's a difference between competing in a beauty pageant with other little girls on stage versus being a child in a bar dancing up.
[02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:57.800]  Absolutely. There are pageants for all sorts of stuff that are legitimate.
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:11:59.800]  I'm saying there's a seedy underbelly.
[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:02.800]  Like if you put your kids into theater, theater is great.
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:03.800]  There's a seedy underbelly.
[02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:06.800]  This is like 10 times worse, 10 times more dangerous.
[02:12:06.800 --> 02:12:09.800]  It'd be like now letting your daughters go dance at a strip bar.
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:13.800]  But she's got her clothes on and she's dancing next to other clothes strippers.
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:17.800]  But hey, you know, it's her dream to be a stripper.
[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:18.800]  That's what we're seeing now.
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:22.800]  It's these little boys' dreams to be drag queen artists.
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:23.800]  So we're going to let them.
[02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:25.800]  We're not going to be an engineer or a scientist.
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:31.800]  You're going to be a gay man who dresses like a woman and the main profession is prostitution.
[02:12:31.800 --> 02:12:40.800]  Oh, yeah. I mean, and of course, this is all heavily linked to that club kid scene that came out of New York City and is rampant in Hollywood.
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:44.800]  And many of the people in the club kid scene are Satanists.
[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:56.800]  I mean, there are satanic cults in Hollywood that I knew of, okay, that we're pushing this indoctrination, this pro gay LGBT line, you know,
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:13:03.800]  since the 2000s or earlier than that, and they've only now started to push this into the main stream.
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:05.800]  So yes, this has a cult ties to it.
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:15.800]  You know, it's speaking of the occult, I just recently heard that Jay-Z and Beyonce were going to be giving out free concert tickets to anyone in New York
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:20.800]  that participates in this Meatless Monday thing because they're trying to push banning meat in New York.
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:21.800]  Did you hear about that, Alex?
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:29.800]  Oh, yeah. DeBlasio says that they're going to begin banning meat. They're going to start with banning 50% of it with a giant 50% tax.
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:31.800]  That's insane. Isn't that crazy?
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:39.800]  They're going to start making it so that there's 50% less meat in schools, correctional facilities and hospitals and anything government.
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:42.800]  And they're trying to push for Meatless Mondays.
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:44.800]  They're never going to stop. They're never going to stop.
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:46.800]  They want total control of all of society.
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:49.800]  They want our children. They want our land. They want our money.
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:51.800]  They want our reproductive systems.
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:53.800]  But here's the thing. What are they planning?
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:14:00.800]  Because I have all these articles where everyone's leaving New Jersey, New York, everyone's leaving California, and then they're replacing it with low IQ.
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:04.800]  People with no skills. What are they planning?
[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:07.800]  They're pushing for Agenda 21, Alex.
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:11.800]  We know that they want to ban cars. That's actually in this new field.
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:14.800]  They want to break down society to make it not work.
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:17.800]  Yeah, they want to get rid of vehicles, only have electric vehicles.
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:27.800]  And if you notice, how is someone like me who has two kids going to get around in public transit with kids and trying to go to the grocery store?
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:29.800]  I mean, it's very anti-family.
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:33.800]  A lot of the policies that the left are pushing are anti-family.
[02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:36.800]  Well, they admit that. And, Momila, you're really doing a great job.
[02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:38.800]  I hope you'll come back on the war room.
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:43.800]  I mean, I can't wait until you launch your own show, but I don't want to take it from your family and your baby that's only a few months old.
[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:45.800]  But this is just a crazy time to be alive.
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:51.800]  I'm so glad you had the courage, you and Gavin, to go cover Charlottesville and we're in this together.
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:55.800]  So we'll continue to track all this as it unfolds. Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:01.800]  Well, I just hope that more people get out there and start doing the work, protesting these type of things.
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:09.800]  I recently heard that there's a protest against one of these drag queen story times that, you know, discouraged the city from having another one in there.
[02:15:09.800 --> 02:15:12.800]  But more people need to get active. That's the bottom line.
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:16.800]  We've got convicted pedophiles dressing up like clowns to get access to your children.
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:20.800]  And the cities aren't even doing background checks because it is a cult.
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:24.800]  And there's major power and money behind giving these people access.
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:28.800]  The pervs they send in clown outfits are always convicted child molesters.
[02:15:28.800 --> 02:15:37.800]  They're just the front line, Gollum creature, or Renfield, but they're operating for the Dracools behind the scene.
[02:15:37.800 --> 02:15:42.800]  No mistake. And every one of these little creatures is a real devil.
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:46.800]  Millie Weaver, great job. All your work at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[02:15:46.800 --> 02:16:15.800]  We salute you when we come back. Max Kaiser is just exploding. This is such a powerful interview. Stay with us.

[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:34.800]  I buy some. I use some. I store some. Awesome.
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:39.800]  No refrigeration needed with a 10 year shelf life. NASA pack technology. Bacon.

[02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:59.800]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of Black Rifle Real Estate.com.
[02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:05.800]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state until one day I chose to lead my family to freedom.
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:13.800]  Today we live on a sustainable 20 acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking ogres.
[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:18.800]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.
[02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:44.800]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com. That's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:53.800]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn, available at Amazon Books.
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:25.800]  Again, we've got four or five places we want to fill and a lot of news, secret projects going on.
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:33.800]  The point is if you want to build freedom in this country and promote free speech and you want to help InfoWars go to the next level, we want to hire you.
[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:37.800]  Send your resumes to techjobs.infowars.com today.
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:44.800]  I look forward to meeting some of you and shaking your hand and having you jump on Millennium Falcon to start Episode 4, because that's what you're going to be doing.
[02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:47.800]  This is the real ticket to adventure.
[02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:55.800]  Techjobs.infowars.com.
[02:18:55.800 --> 02:19:06.800]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:19.800]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:21.800]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:19:21.800 --> 02:19:25.800]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:40.800]  Now, we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be,
[02:19:40.800 --> 02:19:47.800]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:51.800]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:53.800]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield.
[02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:55.800]  InfoWarsLive.com
[02:19:55.800 --> 02:20:21.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:27.800]  He's a woman. The guy says he's a woman. He is. The guy says he's a little kid. He wants to have sex with your kids. I guess that's what happens.
[02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:31.800]  If he wants to beat you up, he can. He's part of the protected class now.
[02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:36.800]  So they hand those kids over right now.
[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:42.800]  I don't know why the drag queens, though, the big fat ones always do like these moray ill faces.
[02:20:42.800 --> 02:20:52.800]  They're like, give me the kid. A lot of times they're a convicted pedo. Big surprise. I don't think that guy is. I don't know who he is.
[02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:54.800]  There's a clown out there that you can't tell.
[02:20:54.800 --> 02:20:56.800]  But we showed some of the ones earlier.
[02:20:56.800 --> 02:20:59.800]  Okay, let's get into the meat and potatoes here.
[02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:01.800]  I ran into Max Kaiser.
[02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:07.800]  I had a lot of other really amazing providential things happen while I was in DC.
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:12.800]  He just joined us. We talked to three people that are the president very closely.
[02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:17.800]  Folks that briefing people that are really good friends with him that interviewing other folks.
[02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:20.800]  They said, no, he's going after the deep state. It's on.
[02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:22.800]  And we've already covered that.
[02:21:22.800 --> 02:21:24.800]  And those those articles are up on infowars.com.
[02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:28.800]  But the people need to know this is happening. And this is a big deal.
[02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:32.800]  They don't want to magnify him for words. That's why only you can do it.
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:34.800]  So when I say that, I really mean it.
[02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:39.800]  I ran into. I probably shook 400 hands or more while I was out there.
[02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:43.800]  And I had probably 30 people say F you Russian agent or the regular stuff they do.
[02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:46.800]  Some of it on tape saw that in live streams.
[02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:50.800]  But so many people shook my hands said, oh, I used to listen to your show.
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:54.800]  I loved it on iTunes or I loved it on YouTube or I loved it here.
[02:21:54.800 --> 02:22:01.800]  I heart radio. They took us off all that you go to info wars.com or news wars.com.
[02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:06.800]  And obviously people listening right now know they can listen on that local radio station
[02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:08.800]  or watch on that local TV station.
[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:16.800]  But the entire establishment is fighting that people won't be able to see this show or hear it.
[02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:18.800]  That's why you are the ambassadors to tell people.
[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:25.800]  Remember Alex Jones, you know him, the verboten guy, the guy that the zeitgeist with all of us to help defeat the globalist.
[02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:29.800]  Well, we're into the next round of the fight and we need to get him out of carbon freeze.
[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:33.800]  Yeah, we're reaching a lot of folks still, but I want to go at the enemy even harder.
[02:22:33.800 --> 02:22:40.800]  So tell everyone you know about info wars.com, port slash show to find the forbidden audio and video feeds.
[02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:43.800]  Share it on your email, your Facebook, your Twitter, your YouTube.
[02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:45.800]  News wars is easy to share. Whatever you do, please share it.
[02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:51.800]  Before we go to this Max Kaiser interview, that's really funny and really powerful in closing.
[02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:59.800]  Please remember that we're listening supported and where your color is proud. They're still running the 50% off apparel sale.
[02:22:59.800 --> 02:23:03.800]  It's supposed to end a day ago. It didn't. It's still there. Take advantage of it.
[02:23:03.800 --> 02:23:10.800]  Also, Brain Force Plus, the great new tropic, 25% off, get a free bottle of knockout, the amazing sleep aid.
[02:23:10.800 --> 02:23:14.800]  So we got awake and we got sleepy. We got chill and we got raging.
[02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:21.800]  We've got it both right now. A great deal. Get brain force 25% off and get a free bottle of knockout.
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:29.800]  And in force.com and 50% off alpha power and super male vitality, two different formulas, both very strong.
[02:23:29.800 --> 02:23:33.800]  Get them both at 50% off and then decide which one you like.

[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:27.800]  Will Johnson's coming up, but here is Max Kaiser. Stay with us.
[02:24:27.800 --> 02:24:32.800]  I think he's going to win in the last line to tell you the truth because you know what, here's what I predict.
[02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:38.800]  Well, Alex Jones, you did the mind meld. You'll be destroyed.
[02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:41.800]  We're still standing. There's only one Alex Jones.
[02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:46.800]  There's only one true twister from Texas. Nobody can come close.
[02:24:46.800 --> 02:24:49.800]  So if I'd have taken that for free, how much would I have had that $10,000?
[02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:53.800]  $50 million. Alex Jones was a $70 million. I said no.
[02:24:53.800 --> 02:24:57.800]  He took the risk. He became president and now we should be applauding that.
[02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:03.800]  And the fact that he wasn't implicated in the Russiagate hoax should be a point of admiration.
[02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:06.800]  What more can I do, Alex? What more can I do?
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:11.800]  Oh, it's Joe Biden. I think Joe Biden's in the house. Oh, I feel him creeping up my spine.
[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:16.800]  Trump 2 is right around the corner. We're ready to go here in DC, Trump International. Let's do it.
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:17.800]  What?
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:31.800]  Well, we just arrived a few minutes ago here in Washington, DC for our secret mission
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:36.800]  over the next few days that we'll cover live at m4wars.com during the weekday show that Owen's hosting.
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:44.800]  And guess who I ran into right as I walked into the hotel right here at the Trump Hotel in DC?
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:46.800]  What? Come on in.
[02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:49.800]  The elusive Maxwell Kaiser.
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:54.800]  Alex, fantastic. Things are heating up again. I can feel the electricity in the air.
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:59.800]  You are the changemaker. Trump 1. Now we're heading into Trump 2.
[02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:03.800]  Russiagate hoax has been discredited. The mainstream media is collapsing.
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:11.800]  MSNBC is a joke. The ratings are collapsing. You've maintained your presence in media going down alternative routes.
[02:26:11.800 --> 02:26:15.800]  Nothing can stop Alex Jones. Nothing can stop Trump 2.
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:21.800]  Well, as long as the folks stand behind us, that's the truth. But, Max, you brought up a meeting with Matt Taiibi.
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:26.800]  Look, I know this is true. I'm not even trying to get the credit. But the left thinks that I really got Trump elected.
[02:26:26.800 --> 02:26:31.800]  Trump got elected. Populism got elected. Hillary, being a horrible candidate, got Trump elected.
[02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:34.800]  Now, he's delivered a lot of what he said he would do. That's going to get him re-elected.
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:39.800]  But they write books where supposedly I told him everything to do. None of that is true.
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:42.800]  I think to talk to the left, I know you were at a meeting on election night in New York.
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:46.800]  You can't get into the details. But what happened when he lost and then who they blamed?
[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:50.800]  I'm happy to get into the details. I mean, I was on election night with Alec Baldwin.
[02:26:50.800 --> 02:27:00.800]  And I was at Marcy Cohen's flat in Soho in New York. She is the daughter of the founder, of course, of the famous underwear brand.
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:02.800]  Calvin Klein.
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:10.800]  So it's Marcy Klein. Thank you, Alex, as Marcy Klein at her flat in Soho. And as Hillary was losing, the tears started falling.
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:17.800]  And at that moment, my friend Alec Baldwin, 30 years, he started within a couple of weeks saying he's going to turn me into the FBI.
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:22.800]  I'm an FBI informant. I'm somehow working with the Russians like he had flipped out.
[02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:28.800]  So their mind melt had occurred. And these folks have now gone down a rabbit hole of denial.
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:32.800]  And they simply don't understand that Hillary lost because people don't like Hillary.
[02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:42.800]  Matt Taibbi, I think, was correct when he started talking about how you were able to capture the zeitgeist, how you were able to galvanize that base of folks that wanted a change.
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:49.800]  They wanted a wholesale change. They wanted a scorched earth approach to just take the whole thing down and start from scratch.
[02:27:49.800 --> 02:27:57.800]  And this is what Trump has done. And I think the Russiagate hoax is really remarkable because instead of coming to terms with the fact that they were dead wrong,
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:03.800]  they're going to tumble down now. They're trying to say, well, we're going to keep pursuing this to the ends of the earth, even though it's a losing strategy.
[02:28:03.800 --> 02:28:11.800]  And Trump is saying, I think, in my view, he's going to come out. I don't know why the meetings are that you have planned here in Washington, D.C.
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:17.800]  What's happening there. I know why we're in D.C. Maybe there's a parallel connection that we don't even know about.
[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:22.800]  I don't know. But there's a lot going on right now to get 2020 off the ground.
[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:28.800]  And part of that is Trump moving into the counter-punching position. He's been playing a rope-a-dope.
[02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:35.800]  He's allowed these liberals to just slap him around a little bit because he knows that there was leaking, that Schumer wasn't involved in leaking.
[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:40.800]  And this is going to become a problem. And there will be people going to jail on the left.
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:43.800]  And that's what we're setting up for now as we head into 2020.
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:51.800]  People going to jail for trying to stage a coup, trying to stage a coup in America domestically.
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:54.800]  You know, I was asked on the TV a couple of days ago.
[02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:24.800]  Haven't you ever wanted to wake up from this nightmare?

[02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:23.800]  You know, I was asked on the TV a couple of days ago, what do I think about the CIA and the FBI
[02:33:23.800 --> 02:33:28.800]  and what's happening in Saudi Arabia and all these foreign policies.
[02:33:28.800 --> 02:33:31.800]  I'm like, they couldn't even stage a coup in their own backyard.
[02:33:31.800 --> 02:33:34.800]  The CIA. Do you think anyone's afraid of the CIA around the world?
[02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:36.800]  They can't even do their own coup.
[02:33:36.800 --> 02:33:40.800]  And that's because there's globalist, minion factions within, not the whole CIA.
[02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:42.800]  You're absolutely right.
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:45.800]  I feel a lot more confidence around the country and vindication.
[02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:47.800]  A lot of people actually believe that I was a Russian agent or that you were.
[02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:49.800]  All of a sudden, crazy crap.
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:53.800]  And the only reason I brought me up is, yeah, Trump's winning, but I'm getting pounded and attacked
[02:33:53.800 --> 02:33:56.800]  because the left, again, think that we got elected.
[02:33:56.800 --> 02:34:01.800]  I think it was populism that did it, but specifically, I was talking to you and Stacey in there earlier
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:06.800]  about what happened in 2016, what they witnessed, who they think got Trump elected.
[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:10.800]  Because that segues into why I'm going to the White House to bullhorn at the moment.
[02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:15.800]  When Trump doesn't stand up against the censorship, the Democrats could steal the election.
[02:34:15.800 --> 02:34:18.800]  So it's bigger than me, but they've picked me as the symbol of that.
[02:34:18.800 --> 02:34:22.800]  And can you speak to what journalists have told you about what really won the election
[02:34:22.800 --> 02:34:24.800]  versus what they think won the election?
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:27.800]  Because I don't deserve the credit. I don't want the credit, but it's made me the target.
[02:34:27.800 --> 02:34:34.800]  Well, we know that Hillary arrogantly ignored key states, key battleground states,
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:37.800]  and therefore lost the electoral college and lost the election.
[02:34:37.800 --> 02:34:42.800]  And their need to scapegoat, and this is a very unfortunate thing in American politics now,
[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:47.800]  is you've got the mainstream media looking for scapegoats in much the same way you've seen
[02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:52.800]  and failed European elections from years gone by back in the 1930s.
[02:34:52.800 --> 02:34:55.800]  They're looking for scapegoats to try to pin the blame.
[02:34:55.800 --> 02:35:02.800]  And the fact is that all you did was broker a relationship between plain speaking Trump
[02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:04.800]  and plain speaking America.
[02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:06.800]  That's what Alex Jones did.
[02:35:06.800 --> 02:35:12.800]  There is a brokering that conversation away from the spin, away from the techno babble,
[02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:14.800]  away from the political nonsense.
[02:35:14.800 --> 02:35:20.800]  And they've kept him handcuffed for two years with this bogus Russia gate hoax, this nonsense,
[02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:25.800]  this story that never happened. It's never going to happen. It never will happen.
[02:35:25.800 --> 02:35:29.800]  Now he's taking the gloves off. I believe the fact that we're here at this hotel
[02:35:29.800 --> 02:35:33.800]  the same day happened to bump into each other in the same way.
[02:35:33.800 --> 02:35:39.800]  I mean, things are moving under, you know, the pieces of the chessboard are moving.
[02:35:39.800 --> 02:35:44.800]  A lot of planets are lining. So Maxwell, tell me, pulling back from this,
[02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:49.800]  you do see people like Bob Woodward that wrote a book claiming Russia gate was all real.
[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:52.800]  Now he's backing up saying the CIA made it up. They need to all go to jail.
[02:35:52.800 --> 02:35:54.800]  I see a lot of rats leaving the sinking ship.
[02:35:54.800 --> 02:35:59.800]  I see panic here because some Democrats want to try to push impeachment, which we know will fail.
[02:35:59.800 --> 02:36:03.800]  But Trump's got to move against them regardless because of the illegal spying.
[02:36:03.800 --> 02:36:07.800]  Everything that's come out, we have the proof of a deep state coup against the president.
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:10.800]  So really, it's a dereliction of duty if the president doesn't act.
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:13.800]  But I wonder why the Democrats are still so arrogant, many of them,
[02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:19.800]  and wanting impeachment, which will just push Trump to force his hand to move against the crimes that they committed,
[02:36:19.800 --> 02:36:23.800]  where we have the text messages, we have the emails, we have the documents of Obama and Hillary
[02:36:23.800 --> 02:36:26.800]  running the illegal operation against the American electorate.
[02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:32.800]  Well, you know, Trump in his own way is a media genius and he appreciates the aesthetics of good media.
[02:36:32.800 --> 02:36:38.800]  Remember Ali Norton in that fight in the eighth when Ali won against Norton for heavyweight champion.
[02:36:38.800 --> 02:36:43.800]  In the eighth round, Norton was going down and Ali, he could have given him another punch and knocked him out.
[02:36:43.800 --> 02:36:52.800]  But after the fight, he said, I love the beauty of watching him go down the way it was, the aesthetics of that knockout.
[02:36:52.800 --> 02:36:58.800]  And I think Trump loves, as a media veteran and a media pro, the aesthetics of watching the Democrats implode.
[02:36:58.800 --> 02:37:04.800]  And he just watched them twist in the wind and hoisted by their own part and then flat on their back.
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:08.800]  And he's basically ready, if necessary, to throw that counter punch.
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:15.800]  But they're so mired in their own lies and their own backstabbing and their own need for Rachel Maddow
[02:37:15.800 --> 02:37:20.800]  to somehow be vindicated for her obvious nonsense for two and a half years.
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:25.800]  Imagine her audience, Glenn Beck stole Alex Jones's act.
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:29.800]  He then was relegated to the far broad reaches of Nowheresville.
[02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:35.800]  Then Rachel Maddow said, oh, Alex Jones, that was part of the 2016 election.
[02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:38.800]  You know, let's do Alex Jones in a skirt.
[02:37:38.800 --> 02:37:41.800]  I'll be Rachel Maddow, Alex Jones in a skirt.
[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:43.800]  Now she couldn't do it either.
[02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:45.800]  There's only one Alex Jones.
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:50.800]  And there's only one true twister from Texas, the Austin Menace.
[02:37:50.800 --> 02:37:52.800]  Nobody can come close.
[02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:57.800]  The only reason I'm bringing up is they get more and more obsessed and they are scared of the populism
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:37:59.800]  and scared of what you do and what everybody does.
[02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:04.800]  But I wanted to specifically get into why I've run into the New York Times reporters and watched the Post reporters
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:07.800]  and national teams and actually shaken fear.
[02:38:07.800 --> 02:38:10.800]  And it's like you said on election night, people have known you for decades.
[02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:15.800]  You're good friends with, you know, they even got paranoid about you. It's like a psychosis where they literally believe
[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:19.800]  that like there's this big conspiracy against them and we're just regular people.
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:27.800]  Right, because nobody wants to admit the fact, especially in the elite regions of the American New York Times
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:33.800]  reading New Yorker magazine reading that Trump is actually representing the average American.
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:34.800]  Trump is American.
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:37.800]  Trump is a nation of hucksters.
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:46.800]  I mean, not to put too fine a point on it, but a nation of, you know, hard graft, hustling, you know, fake it to you, make it.
[02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:48.800]  And yeah, he's a billionaire.
[02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:52.800]  Yeah, he started off, you know, with a big fat gift from his dad.
[02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:56.800]  But he's still been out there competing in a very competitive New York City property market.
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:38:58.800]  He competed as the president of the United States.
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:01.800]  None of these celebrities could have said I was going to run for president.
[02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:02.800]  None of them did.
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:06.800]  This guy took, he said, you know what, I can actually make a difference and I'm going to run.
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:07.800]  He took the risk.
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:10.800]  He became president and now we should be applauding that.
[02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:17.800]  And the fact that he wasn't implicated in the Russiagate hoax should be a point of admiration, should be a point of elevation,
[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:23.800]  not a point to double down on nonsensical constipation, political constipation.
[02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:24.800]  We don't want that.
[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:29.800]  No, I agree, but that's what's crazy is Trump is Americana and they see him beaten up and lied about so long
[02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:36.800]  and other conservatives, and I agree with you, it's finally really starting to backfire in an ultra-massive way.
[02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:41.800]  But I don't want, as the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, us to start, you know, what are you each other next?
[02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:42.800]  You're a smart guy, Max Keiser.
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:44.800]  We're going to Bitcoin here and feel the things with you and the time you have.
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:46.800]  I appreciate your time.
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:51.800]  MaxKeiser.com, what are their left hooks or what are their secret plays?
[02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:58.800]  If they kind of come out of their delusion, their pity party, the fits they're throwing,
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:01.800]  how could Trump step in and how could we step in?
[02:40:01.800 --> 02:40:05.800]  Right, so to kind of figure out what their playbook is going forward,
[02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:17.800]  clearly they're going to try to whip out some kind of bogus CIA connection to a...
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:22.800]  You know, it's interesting that's a great concept because it's like they've exhausted themselves.
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:25.800]  Remember, they tried to pull the amendment where he's gone insane,
[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:29.800]  that he had a 25th amendment, that he was unsuitable for office, that didn't work.
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:33.800]  They've tried to implicate him in this bogus Russia gate, that didn't work.
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:34.800]  Trump's a master.
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:35.800]  I mean, how...
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:37.800]  They've got 20 candidates now running in the Democrats.
[02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:43.800]  Bernie Sanders, he already got emasculated, if you will, by Hillary.
[02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:44.800]  I mean, he's a spent force.
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:45.800]  Hillary's out.
[02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:47.800]  He already let her steal the election from him.
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:50.800]  Right, so he was having her steal the election.
[02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:51.800]  So who do they have in their camp?
[02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:55.800]  Joe Biden is creepy Joe, you know, Hansy Biden.
[02:40:55.800 --> 02:40:57.800]  He's already old news.
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:40:58.800]  He's nobody.
[02:40:58.800 --> 02:40:59.800]  Who's out there?
[02:40:59.800 --> 02:41:01.800]  Who's going to be possibly running?
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:02.800]  Yeah, there he is.
[02:41:02.800 --> 02:41:03.800]  Oh, it's Joe Biden.
[02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:05.800]  I think Joe Biden's in the house.
[02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:07.800]  Oh, I feel him creeping up my spine.
[02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:09.800]  Right, so who do they have on their bench?
[02:41:09.800 --> 02:41:11.800]  He's going to come out there and hit a home run.
[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:13.800]  Nobody, as far as I can tell.
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:15.800]  AOC, I mean, she's too young.
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:17.800]  She won't be available to be...
[02:41:17.800 --> 02:41:20.800]  Oh, Joe, Joe, I love your politics, Joe.
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:25.800]  It makes me feel like I need to take a shower real quick.
[02:41:25.800 --> 02:41:26.800]  Right?
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:27.800]  So they've got nobody on the bench.
[02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:28.800]  I don't know what...
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:29.800]  That's a good question.
[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:30.800]  I don't...
[02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:33.800]  I think he's going to win in the landslide, you know, to tell you the truth.
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:34.800]  Because you know what?
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:35.800]  Here's what I predict.
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:44.800]  Two weeks before the election, Trump drops some of the most powerful and vicious attack
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:47.800]  ads that we've ever seen in American politics.
[02:41:47.800 --> 02:41:48.800]  I mean, think about it.
[02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:53.800]  We've already seen a couple of his ads run, and they're genius political ads.
[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:57.800]  As we get two weeks, you know, the whole election has decided in the last two weeks.
[02:41:57.800 --> 02:41:59.800]  So he's holding back his real audience.
[02:41:59.800 --> 02:42:00.800]  Right.
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:03.800]  When he comes in the last two or three weeks of this election, the ads they're going to
[02:42:03.800 --> 02:42:06.800]  drop are going to absolutely blow people away.
[02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:07.800]  They're going to make the...
[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:09.800]  First of all, every one of the Democrats are going to look...
[02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:10.800]  They're going to be...
[02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:14.800]  Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are going to be crawled up in a fetal position crying under
[02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:15.800]  their desk.
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:21.800]  They're going to be so blown away by the imagery, the sheer poetry of these attack ads.
[02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:23.800]  So, because he's got the bully pulpit now.
[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:24.800]  He's got the White House.
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:25.800]  He's a little...
[02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:26.800]  What about the total reserves, though?
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:28.800]  It could try to really check the economy.
[02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:31.800]  No, they've already telegraphed that they're going to keep rates low.
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:33.800]  They're going to keep lowering rates.
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:37.800]  Powell, who runs the central fed now, he's a total wimp.
[02:42:37.800 --> 02:42:38.800]  He's never going to raise rates.
[02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:40.800]  They're totally in the pocket of big business.
[02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:41.800]  So rates are going to continue to be low.
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:42.800]  Sock market will be...
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:45.800]  I want to get an economy in last with you here in Bitcoin that you're buying there.
[02:42:45.800 --> 02:42:46.800]  And we're...
[02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:48.800]  I mean, predicted it's met a fork rise.
[02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:51.800]  But let's talk about this.
[02:42:51.800 --> 02:42:54.800]  Trump did run for president.
[02:42:54.800 --> 02:42:56.800]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:42:56.800 --> 02:42:57.800]  Go ahead.
[02:42:57.800 --> 02:42:59.800]  Yeah, I just have to say something, man.
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:03.800]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:03.800 --> 02:43:04.800]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:06.800]  I'm going to shut you down right now.
[02:43:06.800 --> 02:43:07.800]  Okay?
[02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:09.800]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:13.800]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:16.800]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:19.800]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:21.800]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[02:43:21.800 --> 02:43:23.800]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:24.800]  You know what?
[02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:25.800]  I'll put it on pause again.
[02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:30.800]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear?
[02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:31.800]  We're under attack.
[02:43:31.800 --> 02:43:32.800]  We need your help.
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:36.800]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:36.800 --> 02:43:39.800]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:39.800 --> 02:43:41.800]  Do you understand I need your help, Frank?
[02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:43.800]  I need your help, Frank?

[02:46:37.800 --> 02:46:45.800]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[02:46:45.800 --> 02:46:52.800]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:46:52.800 --> 02:47:15.800]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:22.800]  Trump did run for president out of nowhere and win. They tried to act like he was a silver spoon and was not a self-made man.
[02:47:22.800 --> 02:47:31.800]  That guy has incredible charisma, incredible energy and it's not like a worship fest but compared to all 18 Democrat candidates, he has more sports and more energy than all of those teleprompter reading boobs.
[02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:36.800]  So I just think the Democrats should just give up and capitulate and let America be great again but they're not going to do it.
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:43.800]  So as the depression intensifies, and I agree they're worn out for now but they're going to come back, I think they're just going to get more zany, more wacky.
[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:51.800]  They will but for this campaign to be derailed, obviously a lot is tied up in the stock market.
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:59.800]  So the stock market has to stay high and there's no reason for it not to continue to stay high because rates are going to continue to be low and they're going to continue to keep pressure on rates to be low.
[02:47:59.800 --> 02:48:05.800]  The deal with China is coming at some point that you've got some global trade there.
[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:13.800]  So again, there's no arrows in their quiver, they've got nothing to fight.
[02:48:13.800 --> 02:48:18.800]  I mean I'd love to be able to say that they've got some threat, that there's somebody, that dark horse is going to appear.
[02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:21.800]  I'll tell you one guy in the Democratic camp that I like is Andrew Yang.
[02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:33.800]  He's kind of a dark horse at this point but I think the millennials, he'll get a lot of support from millennials because he's very good in just spelling out numerically on the data points,
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:39.800]  you know, you can re-archestrate and rebuild the economy in a way that would emphasize...
[02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:45.800]  Sure, what about a third party populist like Trump at the Siphon Votes?
[02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:52.800]  Sure, but I mean again, you'd have to find somebody that has a unique combination of being in a reality TV show in the casino industry.
[02:48:52.800 --> 02:48:57.800]  He's the once in a thousand year candidate who has incredible...
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:49:00.800]  His Twitter mastery is not...
[02:49:00.800 --> 02:49:10.800]  He's a concerned American, you know, he's an American like you, I'm an American and you're an American.
[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:19.800]  And Trump said, our forefathers made the sacrifice of, you know what, I'm going to step away from the farm, I'm going to step away from my business,
[02:49:19.800 --> 02:49:21.800]  and I'm going to do public service.
[02:49:21.800 --> 02:49:24.800]  I'm going to be a congressman, a senator, maybe the president.
[02:49:24.800 --> 02:49:30.800]  And that's what Trump did, he stepped away from his active life to serve his country.
[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:32.800]  Now, let's clear something up here.
[02:49:32.800 --> 02:49:42.800]  I did not say that you were the Soros contact, I had a brokerage firm out of New York City, another one out of Boston and another one out of Southern City.
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:48.800]  Contact me early on and go, oh, George Soros, look at that matter of a guy, you know, he's in Bitcoin, we know that was true, we know it probably was Soros.
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:55.800]  I just pointed out that they offered me a bunch of free Bitcoin years ago. You were the one that was being nice in London six, seven years ago offering me a bunch.
[02:49:55.800 --> 02:50:03.800]  And I believe the idea of open free currencies, I think it's revolutionary, I was just concerned that it would go up into a tulip bubble and then go down.
[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:06.800]  But regardless, I think cryptocurrencies are obviously a real science.
[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:14.800]  You were one of the first people that told me about Bitcoin and so give us your kind of history of it briefly and then where you think it's going and other cryptocurrencies.
[02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:24.800]  Well, you know, think about Bitcoin is that it's censorship resistant and it gives you individual sovereignty and with your shows really challenging the status quo in a big way.
[02:50:24.800 --> 02:50:38.800]  When I said to you when Bitcoin was a dollar, I said, if you looted up on Bitcoin, you would be in a position to be independent to a degree where you could tell whoever it might be, Facebook or YouTube to go, you know, pound sand,
[02:50:38.800 --> 02:50:47.800]  because you're sitting on 50, 60, 70 million dollars or a hundred million dollars, which is for a $10,000 or $20,000 buy of Bitcoin at a dollar.
[02:50:47.800 --> 02:50:54.800]  You're talking about a hundred million, $150 million. Okay, that was my point. And I said, here's 10,000 Bitcoin, give away to your audience.
[02:50:54.800 --> 02:51:00.800]  You know, let's build this new self sovereign country. Let's be media independent.
[02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:13.800]  I wasn't excited because I'd eaten a big steak. Right. And you're like, because you know, because you know, and the fact is that the part of the history of the Bitcoin algorithm and its history was really goes through the NSA, right?
[02:51:13.800 --> 02:51:25.800]  The NSA was part of the encryption technology of the Shaw 256 hashing algorithm of Bitcoin. Okay. But that, so what, you know, I mean, every single component in your iPhone was built by the US government, essentially.
[02:51:25.800 --> 02:51:31.800]  And then I knew I could make money on the way up. I was just worried. I'm not calling the time up that it would correct or whatever go down.
[02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:36.800]  And my audience would think I'd burned them. That was the only reason. Yeah, fair enough. Okay. You're being, you're being prudent. Okay.
[02:51:36.800 --> 02:51:43.800]  But you know, let me tell you some Bitcoin at 30 at 5,000 is like the same thing as Bitcoin at 50. Okay.
[02:51:43.800 --> 02:51:49.800]  Because when it's going to 100,000 500,000 a million, that's just like gold. It's just like gold.
[02:51:49.800 --> 02:51:54.800]  Because definitely you sit on gold because of inflation. It's going to go way back higher than ever was in the future. Just a fact.
[02:51:54.800 --> 02:52:03.800]  Or so it's a fact, dude. So it's a fact. Well, gold has a problem as we've talked about on your show that you can sell futures contracts that don't exist.
[02:52:03.800 --> 02:52:11.800]  And you can keep gold, you know, kind of down, you know, Salentes, but on your show talked about this many times with Bitcoin that doesn't make it shorting right to drive down in gold.
[02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:16.800]  But they can't do that with Bitcoin because we own what are called the private keys. We own essentially the stock of coins.
[02:52:16.800 --> 02:52:23.800]  If the banks try to mess with it like that, we simply take the keys off the exchanges and they get screwed. It's our money.
[02:52:23.800 --> 02:52:26.800]  Sure. Secrets. How much of it did you dump? Did you dump before the crash?
[02:52:26.800 --> 02:52:32.800]  Well, look, I mean, did I get rich with Bitcoin? Well, you know, I got rich on Wall Street. I got rich at the dot com here.
[02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:36.800]  I got, you know, I've been rich several times. I mean, you're like you said, a Scottish Lord.
[02:52:36.800 --> 02:52:41.800]  Being rich is not all it's cooked up. You know, you got problems being rich just like you have problems being poor.
[02:52:41.800 --> 02:52:43.800]  You know, problems don't go away just because you have money.
[02:52:43.800 --> 02:52:44.800]  No, I understand. I understand.
[02:52:44.800 --> 02:52:45.800]  Yeah. What I'm saying out.
[02:52:45.800 --> 02:52:46.800]  Well, I wish I would.
[02:52:46.800 --> 02:53:01.800]  Like you, the media baron of Austin, you had your laptop controls, independent media, the man who turned Rachel Maddow from a transgender, you know, Dick sporting wonder whiz, you know, destroyed Glenn Beck's mind.
[02:53:01.800 --> 02:53:04.800]  You know, you verbally mesmerized these people.
[02:53:04.800 --> 02:53:09.800]  They trip themselves over their own tongue. And then they're on the floor and they're gasping for the air.
[02:53:09.800 --> 02:53:13.800]  Well, Alex Jones, you did the mind meld.
[02:53:13.800 --> 02:53:14.800]  No, I wish I would.
[02:53:14.800 --> 02:53:16.800]  You destroyed. We're still standing.
[02:53:16.800 --> 02:53:17.800]  We'll just be closed.
[02:53:17.800 --> 02:53:18.800]  You're still here.
[02:53:18.800 --> 02:53:22.800]  Max Kaiser dot com, the big, big RT show, Al Jazeera shows, BBC shows, everything.
[02:53:22.800 --> 02:53:25.800]  How, how do you think the censorship issue ends, though?
[02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:30.800]  Because it's really getting bad with big tech going to the EU, going to the UK saying, yeah, go ahead and censor us.
[02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:35.800]  So they have others in section 230, these big excuses to censor everybody now becoming these huge oligopolies.
[02:53:35.800 --> 02:53:45.800]  Jack Dorsey is becoming a big Bitcoin maximalist. And that's, Jack Dorsey has, has, he's predisposed to being, to fighting censorship.
[02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:47.800]  Bitcoin is censorship resistant.
[02:53:47.800 --> 02:53:50.800]  Well, then why did he ban me? Because of the, because it was a boycott to crash.
[02:53:50.800 --> 02:53:54.800]  I think, I think inside, inside he's crying.
[02:53:54.800 --> 02:53:55.800]  There was a rebellion there.
[02:53:55.800 --> 02:53:59.800]  There should be. I think you have served enough penance.
[02:53:59.800 --> 02:54:03.800]  You know, you've been in the penalty box now, time for you to come back out under the ice.
[02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:09.800]  You know, we're watching the Stanley Cup sound, America, you know, Alex, you know, he's in the penalty box for five minutes or fighting.
[02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:13.800]  They put Alex Jones in the penalty box for sticking or high sticking, whatever you did.
[02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:19.800]  They come out of the penalty box, get back on the ice, and let's get back into the game because 2020 is right around the corner.
[02:54:19.800 --> 02:54:21.800]  You got Trump too, he's right around the corner.
[02:54:21.800 --> 02:54:25.800]  So we're ready to go here in DC, Trump International. Let's do it.
[02:54:25.800 --> 02:54:30.800]  Hey, I do want out of the penalty box, but let me tell you, the longer they leave me, it's kind of like Clash the Titans, the Kraken.
[02:54:30.800 --> 02:54:31.800]  You're getting lazy.
[02:54:31.800 --> 02:54:34.800]  Okay, you need to get back on the ice.
[02:54:34.800 --> 02:54:35.800]  I am getting fat.
[02:54:35.800 --> 02:54:36.800]  You're getting lazy, Alex.
[02:54:36.800 --> 02:54:39.800]  Okay, you know, you can't get used to this life of leisure.
[02:54:39.800 --> 02:54:44.800]  Okay, we need you back in the mix because there's a revolution out there ready to go.
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:45.800]  In closing.
[02:54:45.800 --> 02:54:46.800]  Bitcoin is part of it, man.
[02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:49.800]  I'm wondering, are you going to embrace it this time when it's 100,000?
[02:54:49.800 --> 02:54:50.800]  Why are you ready to say?
[02:54:50.800 --> 02:54:52.800]  Or are you going to be like, I don't know, maybe.
[02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:53.800]  I'll take it.
[02:54:53.800 --> 02:54:54.800]  I'm going to Michael down.
[02:54:54.800 --> 02:54:55.800]  Give me 10,000.
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:54:58.800]  And then like three of my viewers will be like unhappy with me.
[02:54:58.800 --> 02:55:01.800]  Not like another 50 million are trying to already sue me.
[02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:02.800]  Here's the problem.
[02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:03.800]  But there's three of them might lose money.
[02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:04.800]  No, that's not what I am.
[02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:05.800]  So I'm so unhappy.
[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:07.800]  The reason I didn't do that is I just couldn't understand it all.
[02:55:07.800 --> 02:55:09.800]  So I can walk around.
[02:55:09.800 --> 02:55:11.800]  I'm going to come to Austin.
[02:55:11.800 --> 02:55:13.800]  We'll go through it on the whiteboard again.
[02:55:13.800 --> 02:55:14.800]  I will take 10,000.
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:15.800]  I will take 10,000.
[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:18.800]  10,000 and 5,000 is a lot different than 10,000 and a dollar.
[02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:19.800]  I know.
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:20.800]  What is it now?
[02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:21.800]  That's a lot.
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:22.800]  That's a big difference.
[02:55:22.800 --> 02:55:23.800]  I'll take it now.
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:24.800]  That's $50 million versus $10,000.
[02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:27.800]  So if I'd have taken that for free, how much would I have had that 10,000?
[02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:28.800]  $10,000.
[02:55:28.800 --> 02:55:29.800]  $10,000 versus $10,000.
[02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:30.800]  It wasn't Soros.
[02:55:30.800 --> 02:55:35.800]  Soros would never have hooked you up with Bitcoin in a dollar.
[02:55:35.800 --> 02:55:38.800]  I had other weird coins.
[02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:40.800]  I always just call all the crypto stuff Bitcoin.
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:41.800]  What do you think the best thing is?
[02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:45.800]  Because your mind was warped by Roger Ver, who's the Antichrist.
[02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:47.800]  Roger Ver is the Antichrist with Bitcoin Cash.
[02:55:47.800 --> 02:55:49.800]  Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin.
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:51.800]  It's an imposter.
[02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:53.800]  Roger Ver is the devil.
[02:55:53.800 --> 02:55:55.800]  Craig Wright is the devil.
[02:55:55.800 --> 02:55:57.800]  I'm trying to tell you, I spell it all out for you.
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:00.800]  I put the bread crumbs on the path.
[02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:01.800]  I'm not Maxwell Kaiser.
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:04.800]  Take a few steps into the house made of pure gold.
[02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:06.800]  Tell people how you relate to the Queen of England.
[02:56:06.800 --> 02:56:09.800]  All you've got to do is go down the little bread crumbs I laid for you.
[02:56:09.800 --> 02:56:11.800]  What more can I do, Alex?
[02:56:11.800 --> 02:56:13.800]  What more can I do?
[02:56:13.800 --> 02:56:14.800]  Tell us about your royalty.
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:15.800]  I'm done.
[02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:16.800]  I am Lord Maxwell.
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:21.800]  I come from Cabralot Castle in Ireland and I have royal blood.
[02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:26.800]  But I am a benevolent royal and that's why I hate England so much,
[02:56:26.800 --> 02:56:28.800]  is that I consider that entire country to be mine.
[02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:29.800]  That's my country.
[02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:31.800]  Those English are upstarts.
[02:56:31.800 --> 02:56:32.800]  That's right, early on.
[02:56:32.800 --> 02:56:33.800]  Yeah, we've been fighting them forever.
[02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:36.800]  We're going to march from Scotland down to Westminster.
[02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:37.800]  But you know the British royals are really German.
[02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:38.800]  The British royals are really German.
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:39.800]  Yeah, they're fake.
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:40.800]  They're nonsense.
[02:56:40.800 --> 02:56:41.800]  We're going to march.
[02:56:41.800 --> 02:56:44.800]  We're going to do a march from Scotland into Westminster
[02:56:44.800 --> 02:56:46.800]  and take back what's mine.
[02:56:46.800 --> 02:56:50.800]  Everything from Cabralot Castle to No. 10 Downing Street is mine.
[02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:51.800]  It's mine.
[02:56:51.800 --> 02:56:54.800]  And you'll be there as well.
[02:56:54.800 --> 02:56:55.800]  All right.
[02:56:55.800 --> 02:56:57.800]  Why is Trump going to London?
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:56:58.800]  Oh, that's the last thing.
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:00.800]  Oh, is it a secretly brokered deal for Julian Assange?
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:01.800]  It is.
[02:57:01.800 --> 02:57:02.800]  I hope so.
[02:57:02.800 --> 02:57:03.800]  I hope so.
[02:57:03.800 --> 02:57:04.800]  Trump said I love what he at least released at all and now you don't know who he is.
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:05.800]  He's Assange.
[02:57:05.800 --> 02:57:06.800]  That's a fly on the ointment.
[02:57:06.800 --> 02:57:07.800]  Trump should release.
[02:57:07.800 --> 02:57:08.800]  He should.
[02:57:08.800 --> 02:57:09.800]  Be loyal on him, go.
[02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:10.800]  He should release.
[02:57:10.800 --> 02:57:14.800]  Assange is about free media and free speech.
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:16.800]  Trump should free Assange.
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:19.800]  That would be an instant gift to the world.
[02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:23.800]  You would be embraced as a living hero by hundreds of millions of people.
[02:57:23.800 --> 02:57:25.800]  I'm going to go bullhorn the White House.
[02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:26.800]  All right.
[02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:27.800]  What message you want me to give Trump?
[02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:28.800]  Tell him to free Assange.
[02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:29.800]  I will.
[02:57:29.800 --> 02:57:30.800]  I'll be over there.
[02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:31.800]  I'll be right behind you.
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:32.800]  How long are you here?
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:33.800]  Like about, you know, half a mile away.
[02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:34.800]  All right.
[02:57:34.800 --> 02:57:36.800]  I'm going to walk in and say, come after you.
[02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:38.800]  I want to make sure I'm right behind you.
[02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:39.800]  All right.
[02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:44.800]  If you're with a bear in the woods, you can only have to do is run faster than the bear.

[03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:23.800]  Okay, Matt Bracken here with you for the next hour, and in a bit we'll be taking some calls at 877-789-ALAX-789-2539.
[03:00:23.800 --> 03:00:26.800]  Yeah, there's a lot to talk about as usual.
[03:00:26.800 --> 03:00:33.800]  The Deep State Coup seems to finally be coming to a head with a Mueller report in.
[03:00:33.800 --> 03:00:44.800]  I've always been comparing it to a poker game or another card game where you want to see what the other guys' cards are before you make your final bids, your final bets.
[03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:46.800]  And that seems to be where we are now.
[03:00:46.800 --> 03:00:50.800]  With the Mueller report, basically a done deal.
[03:00:50.800 --> 03:01:02.800]  You know, Schiff and Nadler in Congress, they can make a lot of noise, but they actually have more to fear from congressional hearings than they are going to take any scalps out of Donald Trump.
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:18.800]  For the Trump administration, they actually, you know, if Mueller or anybody like that goes up before Congress, it's going to be a slaughter when people like, you know, Jim Jordan and Lindsey Graham start to question them.
[03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:22.800]  So I'm not so sure how far that bluff is going to go.
[03:01:22.800 --> 03:01:28.800]  I think that the Democrats have played their entire, you know, they've fired their salvo.
[03:01:28.800 --> 03:01:35.800]  And there's sort of what you would consider in World War II terms.
[03:01:35.800 --> 03:01:38.800]  One side can look like they're just sweeping over the globe.
[03:01:38.800 --> 03:01:41.800]  You know, the Japanese conquered a lot of the Pacific in Asia.
[03:01:41.800 --> 03:01:43.800]  They attacked Pearl Harbor.
[03:01:43.800 --> 03:01:48.800]  Hitler got as far as Stalingrad and the suburbs of Moscow.
[03:01:48.800 --> 03:01:53.800]  But when that momentum is gone, it's like the tide turning.
[03:01:53.800 --> 03:01:56.800]  And then it's just a rollback the entire way.
[03:01:56.800 --> 03:02:00.800]  Now all the big guns are on Trump's side.
[03:02:00.800 --> 03:02:08.800]  So I expect to see whenever Trump is in trouble, there'll probably be some declassification.
[03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:12.800]  Maybe they will save it for the end before the 2020 election.
[03:02:12.800 --> 03:02:15.800]  But I'm not really so sure about that.
[03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:26.800]  You know, the bigger, the other big issue going on right now, this open borders invasion seems to be also coming to a head.
[03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:31.800]  You know, supposedly the Mexicans are taking some measures in southern Mexico,
[03:02:31.800 --> 03:02:35.800]  but it really doesn't matter because there's just a flood going on.
[03:02:35.800 --> 03:02:44.800]  They're saying now that 1400 or 1500 illegals are being released by DHS.
[03:02:44.800 --> 03:02:51.800]  So it's really meaningless when the government says we're apprehending thousands a day.
[03:02:51.800 --> 03:02:56.800]  Yeah, they're apprehending them, holding them for a few weeks and then letting them go.
[03:02:56.800 --> 03:02:59.800]  Or just if they have kids, they're just letting them go.
[03:02:59.800 --> 03:03:07.800]  And mostly I think that they're heading into red states to try to flip them electorally.
[03:03:07.800 --> 03:03:10.800]  Because as we know, eventually these people vote.
[03:03:10.800 --> 03:03:15.800]  And in some of the states, they're given voter ID cards with their driver's licenses.
[03:03:15.800 --> 03:03:17.800]  It's ridiculous.
[03:03:17.800 --> 03:03:21.800]  But that's what they do in California and some other states, New York, etc.
[03:03:21.800 --> 03:03:29.800]  And, you know, in terms of the electoral college, it won't help if they send these illegals to Democrat states
[03:03:29.800 --> 03:03:35.800]  because they're only going to max out their electoral votes no matter how many more illegals they have.
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:42.800]  That's why they want to put as many as possible into Florida and Texas and other states
[03:03:42.800 --> 03:03:47.800]  that are purple bordering on flipping to Democrat.
[03:03:47.800 --> 03:03:51.800]  But yeah, this is a very serious time.
[03:03:51.800 --> 03:03:57.800]  And with the American troops that were disarmed on our side of the border, the south side of the fence,
[03:03:57.800 --> 03:04:02.800]  but our side of the border, I think it's becoming obvious, even to President Trump,
[03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:06.800]  that the cartels are just running the entire border zone.
[03:04:06.800 --> 03:04:11.800]  And that includes Mexican police and supposedly Mexican military.
[03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:16.800]  So there's a huge amount of room for big misunderstandings.
[03:04:16.800 --> 03:04:21.800]  The militia group that was down there, the leader got arrested for a weapons charge.
[03:04:21.800 --> 03:04:27.800]  So you can see when it's really serious to DHS, that's when civilians start getting into the mix.
[03:04:27.800 --> 03:04:35.800]  That's when there's really going to be room for a huge mistake that could send this entire formula
[03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:42.800]  out of its just regular linear progression and into some kind of unpredictable catastrophe.
[03:04:42.800 --> 03:04:45.800]  We'll be back on the other side of the break with more.
[03:04:53.800 --> 03:04:56.800]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[03:04:56.800 --> 03:05:00.800]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the deep earth crystals anymore
[03:05:00.800 --> 03:05:04.800]  in a year and a half site, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source,
[03:05:04.800 --> 03:05:08.800]  the best atomic iodide in the world, X2 is back.
[03:05:08.800 --> 03:05:10.800]  We got it. This deal just happened about a month ago.
[03:05:10.800 --> 03:05:12.800]  We rushed it into production. It's been bottled.
[03:05:12.800 --> 03:05:14.800]  The labels are being put on today.
[03:05:14.800 --> 03:05:19.800]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the plant in the Rockies.
[03:05:19.800 --> 03:05:21.800]  And it's going to be shipped out to you.
[03:05:21.800 --> 03:05:26.800]  Be sure to sign up for auto-ship, get an additional 10% off, the 25% off,
[03:05:26.800 --> 03:05:29.800]  celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[03:05:29.800 --> 03:05:31.800]  Research the iodide conspiracy.
[03:05:31.800 --> 03:05:33.800]  Find out why it's so important.
[03:05:33.800 --> 03:05:36.800]  Find out why the globalists don't want you to have the good halogens,
[03:05:36.800 --> 03:05:39.800]  you have the bad halogens at infowarstore.com.
[03:05:39.800 --> 03:05:42.800]  That's the umbrella site, infowarslife.com.
[03:05:42.800 --> 03:05:44.800]  They should write the supplements.
[03:05:44.800 --> 03:05:47.800]  And this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:05:47.800 --> 03:05:52.800]  It is X2 original now back at infowarstore.com.
[03:06:18.800 --> 03:06:29.800]  Yep, I'm back and we'll be taking calls in a little while at 877-789-2539-789-ALIX.
[03:06:29.800 --> 03:06:37.800]  Now, if there's a silver lining to this immigration invasion that's going on,
[03:06:37.800 --> 03:06:44.800]  it's that the Democrats and the mainstream media, but I repeat myself,
[03:06:44.800 --> 03:06:47.800]  they can't say that this is a manufactured crisis.
[03:06:47.800 --> 03:06:52.800]  It's obvious to the entire world that what's going on is a land invasion
[03:06:52.800 --> 03:06:59.800]  on the level of the book Camp of the Saints by Jean-Ross Bell,
[03:06:59.800 --> 03:07:04.800]  which is also kind of playing out across the Mediterranean now from Africa to Europe.
[03:07:04.800 --> 03:07:11.800]  And Americans are waking up to the fact that the way that California has turned into
[03:07:11.800 --> 03:07:19.800]  a third world s-hole, that's the formula that the Democrats hope to import to all 50 states.
[03:07:19.800 --> 03:07:25.800]  And it's not just, you know, the sad plight of the Guatemalans and Hondurans, I get it.
[03:07:25.800 --> 03:07:32.800]  It's sad down there, even though the countries are beautiful and have great climates.
[03:07:32.800 --> 03:07:39.800]  It's not just that the cartels are collecting $5,000 or $6,000 ahead from these desperate people.
[03:07:39.800 --> 03:07:41.800]  So it's big money.
[03:07:41.800 --> 03:07:49.800]  And the cartels are using the human wave attacks as a diversion for bringing in the drug shipments.
[03:07:49.800 --> 03:07:56.800]  But on our side of the border, there's another part of this equation which is probably even more disturbing,
[03:07:56.800 --> 03:08:04.800]  which is, and this all happened or mainly began under Obama with these partnerships with the so-called charities.
[03:08:04.800 --> 03:08:08.800]  So the Catholic and Lutheran charities and others, those are two of the biggest.
[03:08:08.800 --> 03:08:16.800]  They're working, essentially, they're working hand in glove, like cog teeth, with the cartels,
[03:08:16.800 --> 03:08:24.800]  and with the, for now, sadly, with the Department of Homeland Security, to facilitate this invasion.
[03:08:24.800 --> 03:08:29.800]  So there's sort of like a push and a pull part of this with the sieve at the border being handled
[03:08:29.800 --> 03:08:33.800]  by the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Patrol.
[03:08:33.800 --> 03:08:39.800]  So the cartels escort these human waves to the border.
[03:08:39.800 --> 03:08:47.800]  They then seek out the Border Patrol who quote-unquote apprehend them, but only temporarily because they're going to be released.
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:54.800]  Then the Department of Homeland Security puts them in vans and buses and drops them off at pickup points
[03:08:54.800 --> 03:09:03.800]  where Catholic and Lutheran charity organizers then pick them up to drive them to your city to release them.
[03:09:03.800 --> 03:09:10.800]  And the real money, and this is unbelievable, but American tax money is being spent to the tune for children
[03:09:10.800 --> 03:09:21.800]  of more than $50,000 a head for placement services to distribute these kids throughout America.
[03:09:21.800 --> 03:09:28.800]  These future dreamers, future Democrat voters, so that the cartels make money off of it.
[03:09:28.800 --> 03:09:35.800]  Department of Homeland Security, they can't do anything because these communist trader-quizzling judges, essentially,
[03:09:35.800 --> 03:09:39.800]  say it's illegal to hold them for more than 20 days.
[03:09:39.800 --> 03:09:45.800]  So the 20 days is just a waiting period, essentially, and on they go into America,
[03:09:45.800 --> 03:09:53.800]  where Catholic and Lutheran charities are then earning millions and millions of dollars to distribute these refugees,
[03:09:53.800 --> 03:09:56.800]  so-called refugees, throughout America.
[03:09:56.800 --> 03:10:03.800]  And one state at a time, it's going to flip our demography and then our electoral process.
[03:10:03.800 --> 03:10:08.800]  And as I've said before, I call California, Calazuela.
[03:10:08.800 --> 03:10:13.800]  If you want to see the future of America, it's California.
[03:10:13.800 --> 03:10:21.800]  California times 50 is how the Democrats are going to have permanent political power.
[03:10:21.800 --> 03:10:26.800]  So when we get back to the discussion of, for example, the deep state coup,
[03:10:26.800 --> 03:10:31.800]  is Trump going to win or is Biden going to win? Which of the Democrats will win?
[03:10:31.800 --> 03:10:38.800]  All of this is just a speed bump on the way to turning America into a permanent one-party state,
[03:10:38.800 --> 03:10:43.800]  like Venezuela or the state of California that I call Calazuela.
[03:10:43.800 --> 03:10:52.800]  Because once Florida or Texas flips to Democrat, they're going to have a lock on the electoral college.
[03:10:52.800 --> 03:10:57.800]  They are going to be able to run anybody and win the presidency.
[03:10:57.800 --> 03:11:08.800]  So in that sense, Trump at best is just a reprieve or a speed bump on the way to this progressive takeover of our country.
[03:11:08.800 --> 03:11:13.800]  It's happening, and that's why this border crisis is so important.
[03:11:13.800 --> 03:11:23.800]  And even today, even pretty good conservatives on talk radio and on television, they're still dancing around it.
[03:11:23.800 --> 03:11:31.800]  They're still saying, well, do these refugees cost more than they're going to provide in taxes as if?
[03:11:31.800 --> 03:11:36.800]  Or are they bringing in diseases? Are they bringing in crime?
[03:11:36.800 --> 03:11:42.800]  Are they bringing in a culture of corruption and violence, which is endemic to where they grew up?
[03:11:42.800 --> 03:11:48.800]  Sure, those are all valid points, but to the Democrats, none of that matters.
[03:11:48.800 --> 03:12:00.800]  The only thing that matters is stuffing the ballot boxes with new Democrat, beholden, progressive, because that's where they come from.
[03:12:00.800 --> 03:12:02.800]  Socialism is like a beautiful thing.
[03:12:02.800 --> 03:12:09.800]  If you're an impoverished third-worlder, you vote for the guys that are going to promise to give you all the benefits.
[03:12:09.800 --> 03:12:12.800]  That's as simple as it can be put.
[03:12:12.800 --> 03:12:18.800]  The Democrats are going to run this country into the ground, California times 50.
[03:12:18.800 --> 03:12:25.800]  The Venezuela will be our future if we can't get ahold of this border situation and do it fast.
[03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:31.800]  Now, there's no guarantee, for instance, even that Trump is going to win in 2020.
[03:12:31.800 --> 03:12:38.800]  And just imagine, you know, President Bernie Sanders, the border will be absolutely dismantled.
[03:12:38.800 --> 03:12:46.800]  And I don't think that, you know, that we're going to be a very happy country as a republic will be destroyed.
[03:12:46.800 --> 03:12:52.800]  And there's going to be millions of Americans that are going to say, you know, the hell with it, I'm just not going to participate.
[03:12:52.800 --> 03:12:56.800]  I won't work. I won't pay taxes. I'll become a real resistor.
[03:12:56.800 --> 03:13:05.800]  You'll see what happens when the productive element of society puts down their tools, or even worse, throws their tools into the gearbox.
[03:13:05.800 --> 03:13:15.800]  So we're going to be starting to take calls on maybe the next segment, call in at 877-789-ALIX, 789-2539.
[03:13:15.800 --> 03:13:22.800]  And another subject that I'm going to be getting to, I'd like to switch to now.
[03:13:22.800 --> 03:13:34.800]  We all know that it's important to support InfoWars, the InfoWars store, because our alternative and independent voices are so important, so critical.
[03:13:34.800 --> 03:13:48.800]  If anybody's been paying attention, it's obvious that big media and big social media has been working to completely tilt the scale against conservatives and libertarians towards the progressive slash communists.
[03:13:48.800 --> 03:13:52.800]  No matter what they say, that's what's happening.
[03:13:52.800 --> 03:13:56.800]  And as they do, they're choking off one voice after another.
[03:13:56.800 --> 03:14:06.800]  I'm off of Twitter permanently for an anti-berka meme. I'm off of Facebook virtually. They let me on for a few days and they banned me again, so I don't post there anymore.
[03:14:06.800 --> 03:14:15.800]  But it's not just me and InfoWars. All across the media, people are getting basically unpersoned.
[03:14:15.800 --> 03:14:18.800]  They're having their microphones shut down.
[03:14:18.800 --> 03:14:28.800]  And while the other side, the progressive side, any little group, any group of malcontents of progressive cat ladies,
[03:14:28.800 --> 03:14:36.800]  all they've got to do is put out the call and they're going to get a check for millions and millions from George Soros and his band.
[03:14:36.800 --> 03:14:46.800]  On our side, these important small independent voices, they get crushed, they get taken out, and they can't support themselves.
[03:14:46.800 --> 03:14:57.800]  There are people on our side that are working for nothing, that are practically doing lawn jobs and washing dishes to keep their blog running.
[03:14:57.800 --> 03:15:00.800]  There's no George Soros on our side.
[03:15:00.800 --> 03:15:08.800]  So when I get back, I'm going to mention some of these folks and websites that it's very important that our side supports.
[03:15:08.800 --> 03:15:17.800]  Otherwise, we're just giving the battlefield to George Soros because he can fund every anti-gun group, every open border group,
[03:15:17.800 --> 03:15:25.800]  every child molesting, transsexual, pedarast group. They get millions and millions.
[03:15:25.800 --> 03:15:30.800]  The conservatives, we get nothing. We have to do it ourselves.
[03:15:30.800 --> 03:15:51.800]  We'll be back on the other side and we're going to talk about some of these groups.
[03:16:00.800 --> 03:16:29.800]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon. I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[03:16:29.800 --> 03:16:32.800]  I buy some, I use some, I store some. Awesome.
[03:16:32.800 --> 03:16:37.800]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life, NASA pack technology. Bacon.
[03:16:37.800 --> 03:16:43.800]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon or warm and serve.
[03:16:43.800 --> 03:16:47.800]  Life saving, ready to eat bacon. 10-year shelf life bacon.
[03:16:47.800 --> 03:16:52.800]  Ships free at fullycookedbacon.com. Fullycookedbacon.com.
[03:16:52.800 --> 03:16:57.800]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:57.800 --> 03:17:01.800]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:01.800 --> 03:17:07.800]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[03:20:13.800 --> 03:20:20.800]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:20.800 --> 03:20:27.800]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:20:27.800 --> 03:20:36.800]  Okay, we're back and before we left, I was talking about some individuals that are just basically being turned into unpersons.
[03:20:36.800 --> 03:20:40.800]  They're just being disappeared, essentially.
[03:20:40.800 --> 03:20:45.800]  There's no gulag yet. They're not hauling us off and putting us behind barbed wire.
[03:20:45.800 --> 03:20:58.800]  But if you're trying to communicate a message to the world and your wires are just progressively cut, it's not that much different, especially if your livelihood is at stake.
[03:20:58.800 --> 03:21:04.800]  In Canada, it's even worse than here by far.
[03:21:04.800 --> 03:21:17.800]  In Canada, parents are having their children taken away because these children in these state schools are brainwashed into believing that they're transsexual, even as small children.
[03:21:17.800 --> 03:21:32.800]  Some of these kids are autistic or have other problems, and the last thing they need is Marxist perverted teachers brainwashing them that they're not their God-given biological sex as small children.
[03:21:32.800 --> 03:21:39.800]  And if the parents complain, this is something like maybe in some ways worse than what they did in the Soviet Union.
[03:21:39.800 --> 03:21:44.800]  At least they weren't going after the human sexuality like this.
[03:21:44.800 --> 03:21:49.800]  If the parents are objecting, the children are taken away from the parents.
[03:21:49.800 --> 03:21:51.800]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:21:51.800 --> 03:22:07.800]  This is in a country where they're now making up and apologizing for decades of taking Aboriginal kids away from their parents, putting them into state-run orphanages where they would be hammered into Canadian citizens.
[03:22:07.800 --> 03:22:12.800]  Now they're doing something to me that's very evil.
[03:22:12.800 --> 03:22:21.800]  In Canada, if you become an unperson, they pass your word around and you're not going to get a job.
[03:22:21.800 --> 03:22:27.800]  You're going to not only lose your ability to communicate your message, you're not going to be able to work.
[03:22:27.800 --> 03:22:31.800]  That's where I was talking about being a dishwasher.
[03:22:31.800 --> 03:22:49.800]  So this puts a real chilling effect on anybody who would like to be a conservative beacon, but they just feel like they can't because if they take that chance, they'll not only have their website destroyed, they won't be able to have a job
[03:22:49.800 --> 03:22:56.800]  because the employers are all going to know that you're on the bad comrade list and the employers don't want trouble with the state.
[03:22:56.800 --> 03:23:05.800]  The same state that takes children away who have been brainwashed into thinking that they're transsexual at the age of five or six.
[03:23:05.800 --> 03:23:07.800]  It's just purely evil.
[03:23:07.800 --> 03:23:19.800]  Now, one of the main Canadian counter-jihad websites is having financial problems and they've had to let go a lot of their staff downsizing.
[03:23:19.800 --> 03:23:26.800]  And one of these people, and I've mentioned before, one of these websites is called VladTepes.com.
[03:23:26.800 --> 03:23:37.800]  It's not famous. It's not really huge, big important website that you've heard of, but it really is important because of the translation work.
[03:23:37.800 --> 03:23:52.800]  When you see a video on YouTube from Italy or Hungary or Finland, and the same day it's out, it has English subtitles, that's probably from VladTepes.com.
[03:23:52.800 --> 03:24:03.800]  And some of the video work that he was doing for a pretty important counter-jihad website, well, they've got no money.
[03:24:03.800 --> 03:24:09.800]  They've had to cut staffing, so now it's down to the bare bones time.
[03:24:09.800 --> 03:24:19.800]  If he was a progressive, if any of these guys were on the left, they would just put out a call up the chain of command, and here would be $100,000 from George Soros.
[03:24:19.800 --> 03:24:21.800]  We don't do that.
[03:24:21.800 --> 03:24:24.800]  Our little foundlings just starve.
[03:24:24.800 --> 03:24:28.800]  Our little orphans, they just starve out in the cold, forgotten.
[03:24:28.800 --> 03:24:43.800]  So if you can go to VladTepes, try to keep the place running because without VladTepes blog, this rapid translation, which really ties the world together, the populist movement around the world,
[03:24:43.800 --> 03:24:45.800]  so that we know we're not just alone.
[03:24:45.800 --> 03:24:49.800]  It's in Brazil, it's in Italy, it's across Europe.
[03:24:49.800 --> 03:25:00.800]  And the globalists would like us to think that nobody is on our side, that we're the oddballs, that we're isolated, that we're just a few nuts.
[03:25:00.800 --> 03:25:01.800]  We're not.
[03:25:01.800 --> 03:25:04.800]  And websites like VladTepes are extremely important.
[03:25:04.800 --> 03:25:08.800]  That's in fact where I got this, the Cross of St. James.
[03:25:08.800 --> 03:25:16.800]  It's a way to help out other than just converting to being a communist and asking George Soros and then the money will rain down.
[03:25:16.800 --> 03:25:25.800]  But it's pathetic that our side has to basically put out the begging bowl, whereas the communists, money is no object.
[03:25:25.800 --> 03:25:30.800]  That's how you can see any left-wing cause in the states or elsewhere.
[03:25:30.800 --> 03:25:45.800]  Where do they get all of these giant white academy buses that hold 80 people, convoys of them, to take basically drifters and bums and mass convoy them to Washington?
[03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:48.800]  Or mass convoy them to any state capital?
[03:25:48.800 --> 03:25:50.800]  It's because they don't worry about money.
[03:25:50.800 --> 03:25:52.800]  They've got all the money in the world.
[03:25:52.800 --> 03:25:54.800]  It just comes raining down.
[03:25:54.800 --> 03:25:56.800]  But our side needs to fight for every dollar.
[03:25:56.800 --> 03:26:00.800]  That's why we support the InfoWars store.
[03:26:00.800 --> 03:26:07.800]  And that's why you're watching me on InfoWars right now, because we have to support our own selves.
[03:26:07.800 --> 03:26:12.800]  In fact, right now, the InfoWars store is always open.
[03:26:12.800 --> 03:26:17.800]  There's DNA force. Everything is on sale.
[03:26:17.800 --> 03:26:19.800]  50% off.
[03:26:19.800 --> 03:26:21.800]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[03:26:21.800 --> 03:26:23.800]  Keep this program alive.
[03:26:23.800 --> 03:26:26.800]  There is no George Soros on our side.
[03:26:26.800 --> 03:26:30.800]  The Republican Party doesn't support us, obviously.
[03:26:30.800 --> 03:26:33.800]  The Chamber of Commerce hates our guts.
[03:26:33.800 --> 03:26:35.800]  They're allied with the globalists.
[03:26:35.800 --> 03:26:39.800]  If we're going to keep this running, we have to do it on our own.
[03:26:39.800 --> 03:26:49.800]  All right, next break, after the break, we're going to be taking calls 877-789-ALIX-789-2539.
[03:26:49.800 --> 03:26:52.800]  And now I'm very sincere about this.
[03:26:52.800 --> 03:26:58.800]  In fact, today I put one of my books into a Kindle free run for today and tomorrow.
[03:26:58.800 --> 03:27:04.800]  It's my novel, Domestic Enemies, about the Reconquista of the Southwest.
[03:27:04.800 --> 03:27:10.800]  I wrote it 10 years ago, 12 years ago, and people thought it was hyperbolic.
[03:27:10.800 --> 03:27:13.800]  But it's all happening. We have no border.
[03:27:13.800 --> 03:27:15.800]  We are being invaded.
[03:27:15.800 --> 03:27:23.800]  And as this invasion, as this suffusion of the illegal immigrant invasion takes place,
[03:27:23.800 --> 03:27:27.800]  border counties are going the other way.
[03:27:27.800 --> 03:27:31.800]  There are more and more law enforcement, local law enforcement.
[03:27:31.800 --> 03:27:33.800]  They're paid off by the cartels.
[03:27:33.800 --> 03:27:37.800]  How did you stop it when it becomes corrupt?
[03:27:37.800 --> 03:27:42.800]  There's a band of corruption, just like Northern Mexico, obviously, is run by the cartels
[03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:44.800]  and is extremely corrupt.
[03:27:44.800 --> 03:27:50.800]  Well, there's now growing a band of counties across our southern border that are also corrupt.
[03:27:50.800 --> 03:27:59.800]  They want to keep this turnstile just cranking as long as the people wind up in conservative states
[03:27:59.800 --> 03:28:01.800]  where they can flip it.
[03:28:01.800 --> 03:28:10.800]  If we don't stop it, we are going to be Calazuela times 50 before maybe even the next election.
[03:28:10.800 --> 03:28:15.800]  If Trump wins, it may be the last Republican that is ever elected.
[03:28:15.800 --> 03:28:18.800]  If we don't get this thing stopped and turned around.
[03:28:18.800 --> 03:28:20.800]  I mean, it is that serious.
[03:28:20.800 --> 03:28:29.800]  And to do that, we need to support all of our allies who really don't have any support.
[03:28:29.800 --> 03:28:35.800]  I mean, it doesn't cost much to run a website, but it sure does cost something to get it distributed,
[03:28:35.800 --> 03:28:39.800]  to get it edited, to get all these people working together.
[03:28:39.800 --> 03:28:41.800]  It does cost money.
[03:28:41.800 --> 03:28:43.800]  And that's why I'm on Infowars.
[03:28:43.800 --> 03:28:47.800]  That's why you come here for this independent message.
[03:28:47.800 --> 03:28:52.800]  And after the break, when we come back, I'll be going right to calls.
[03:28:52.800 --> 03:28:56.800]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.800 --> 03:29:00.800]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.

[03:32:35.800 --> 03:32:39.800]  there is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.

[03:33:16.800 --> 03:33:23.800]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:33:23.800 --> 03:33:26.800]  I knew it man!
[03:33:26.800 --> 03:33:31.800]  Okay, we're back and like I said we're going to go right to the phones.
[03:33:31.800 --> 03:33:37.800]  We have a full board so let's go to Dennis who's been waiting in Virginia.
[03:33:37.800 --> 03:33:43.800]  He wants to talk about the deep state murders. Who would that be?
[03:33:43.800 --> 03:33:48.800]  You know with all the obstruction investigations against President Trump.
[03:33:48.800 --> 03:33:54.800]  I hope they take a look back in the summer of 2016 and all these people and several people were murdered.
[03:33:54.800 --> 03:33:59.800]  You know, ones that were associated with the DNC and the Hillary campaign and so forth.
[03:33:59.800 --> 03:34:01.800]  And I hope these people are not forgotten.
[03:34:01.800 --> 03:34:05.800]  I mean you want to talk about some obstruction to anybody that could testify.
[03:34:05.800 --> 03:34:08.800]  I mean it's laying right there before you. You've got a pile of bodies.
[03:34:08.800 --> 03:34:12.800]  And why isn't the mainstream news covering that?
[03:34:12.800 --> 03:34:16.800]  Are you referring to Seth Rich or other people as well?
[03:34:16.800 --> 03:34:23.800]  Yeah, other people. Seth Rich, Joe Montana, Victor Thorn, John Ash, Sean Lucas and there could be others.
[03:34:23.800 --> 03:34:30.800]  I mean these are all people that were going to blow the whistle on the DNC or testify and they're dead.
[03:34:30.800 --> 03:34:38.800]  Yeah, I would focus on Seth Rich. I think that the Mueller report was really a deep state cover-up report.
[03:34:38.800 --> 03:34:44.800]  You know, it stops short of talking about the origins of Crossfire Hurricane.
[03:34:44.800 --> 03:34:53.800]  You know, it begins with the completely bogus immaculate conception theory that George Papadopoulos was a Russian agent
[03:34:53.800 --> 03:34:59.800]  who just happened to be talking to the Australian diplomat Alexander Downer.
[03:34:59.800 --> 03:35:06.800]  And as we know that the deep state coup began probably a year before that at least.
[03:35:06.800 --> 03:35:14.800]  So in the Mueller report he begins with a supposition that the Russians did hack the DNC server.
[03:35:14.800 --> 03:35:22.800]  But computer experts say that's impossible. It had to have been downloaded to a hard drive or a thumb drive, some kind of an external drive.
[03:35:22.800 --> 03:35:27.800]  So I think that all remains to be exposed.
[03:35:27.800 --> 03:35:32.800]  Certainly that one is the most glaring to me.
[03:35:32.800 --> 03:35:37.800]  What do you think is going to happen going forward? Do you think that this is all going to be coming out?
[03:35:37.800 --> 03:35:42.800]  Or do you think that the cover-up is going to be successful as far as these murders?
[03:35:42.800 --> 03:35:47.800]  I think, you know, as I was telling Alex a few weeks ago, I think, you know, President Trump was laying low
[03:35:47.800 --> 03:35:51.800]  and he didn't want to cause any problems with the investigation.
[03:35:51.800 --> 03:35:54.800]  And once it was over with, he was going to let loose the dogs of war.
[03:35:54.800 --> 03:35:57.800]  And I hope that he tears up some masses because they deserve it.
[03:35:57.800 --> 03:36:02.800]  People for over two years have been at it. You know, it's sickening. It's disgraceful. It's disgraceful.
[03:36:02.800 --> 03:36:08.800]  These people are like a natter. You know, you should paint him green and put him under some, you know, put some troll shoes on his feet
[03:36:08.800 --> 03:36:13.800]  and set him up and make some giant mushrooms. He's a guardant, so he's a patron. That's what he's a Schumer.
[03:36:13.800 --> 03:36:18.800]  Well, you know, Schumer actually warned Trump.
[03:36:18.800 --> 03:36:23.800]  He said that, you know, the intelligence agencies have, what do you say, six ways from Sunday of getting back at you.
[03:36:23.800 --> 03:36:32.800]  It seems like laughing about how we're not really a free republic anymore, that the deep state under the intelligence services
[03:36:32.800 --> 03:36:37.800]  are really running the show and have been. I mean, how many of these congressmen are under blackmail?
[03:36:37.800 --> 03:36:43.800]  We know that the NSA is listening to everybody, so they find these little blackmailable nuggets.
[03:36:43.800 --> 03:36:49.800]  I think it's very easy for them to put Congress under their control and no problem at all.
[03:36:49.800 --> 03:36:56.800]  Let's go to Mike in Texas. You want to talk about disarming America. Mike, are you there?
[03:36:56.800 --> 03:37:07.800]  Yeah, I am at the, toward the end of the Obama administration, the second term, he cashiered a lot of line officers
[03:37:07.800 --> 03:37:14.800]  asking the question, would you be willing to pass on in order to fire on Americans to disarm them?
[03:37:14.800 --> 03:37:27.800]  Has anyone sought out those officers who had their careers cut short to see if they can be brought back?
[03:37:27.800 --> 03:37:34.800]  I'm not really familiar with this, the specifics of this. I've seen over the years some surveys and things like that,
[03:37:34.800 --> 03:37:44.800]  but my worry isn't specifically that would or would not American officers fire on other Americans.
[03:37:44.800 --> 03:37:55.800]  It's that for the last 20 years, essentially, college and university output is federal government including the military input.
[03:37:55.800 --> 03:38:08.800]  So if colleges are churning out little Marxists, then that's what has been filling the ranks of the FBI, the CIA, and our military, unfortunately.
[03:38:08.800 --> 03:38:13.800]  And once you get to the general officer rank, you have to be approved by the Senate.
[03:38:13.800 --> 03:38:20.800]  So when the Senate is under Democrat control, you know that the only generals that they're approving are little Marxists.
[03:38:20.800 --> 03:38:31.800]  So to me, it's very doubtful whether we've got fully stocked, the military is fully stocked with patriots,
[03:38:31.800 --> 03:38:39.800]  or whether they're really just more and more becoming, they wear the American uniform, but in their mindset is globalist.
[03:38:39.800 --> 03:38:45.800]  You can even see the commercials that the military has been putting out for the last 10 or so years.
[03:38:45.800 --> 03:38:53.800]  You'd think that they were the peace corps with guns, they're just going around the world to help the third world out.
[03:38:53.800 --> 03:39:00.800]  Pastor Sam in Texas wants to talk about the border. Go ahead, Pastor.
[03:39:00.800 --> 03:39:02.800]  Hey, how are you doing, Matt?
[03:39:02.800 --> 03:39:05.800]  Good, thanks. Good hearing from you.
[03:39:05.800 --> 03:39:17.800]  You know, I work a lot out at the end of the spear in Central America and South America and also on the border, but I'm in Texas now, and I'd like to discuss the next wave of the border invasion.
[03:39:17.800 --> 03:39:28.800]  I speak Spanish, and as I go around to the Hispanic communities, I see things like mobile embassies of Latin countries coming in and setting up in a globalist church
[03:39:28.800 --> 03:39:35.800]  and issuing documents, identity documents, passports, things like that to members of the Hispanic community.
[03:39:35.800 --> 03:39:43.800]  But just this week, I observed a whole other level, and I want to make the infall warriors aware of it.
[03:39:43.800 --> 03:39:51.800]  There is an initiative. It's called the Libre Institute. Libre, of course, the Spanish word for freedom.
[03:39:51.800 --> 03:39:59.800]  Libre Tad, liberty. Libre is freedom, and that's the name of it, the Libre Institute. You can check it out at thelibreinstitute.org.
[03:39:59.800 --> 03:40:13.800]  This is funded by the Koch brothers who gave $10 million, they read in the news, to start this initiative, which would be great if they were training Hispanic Americans and Latinos here in the USA how to be patriots.
[03:40:13.800 --> 03:40:31.800]  But they're doing the opposite, Matt. They are encouraging them to instruct themselves, to revolution themselves, to revolt and to install a dictatorship and a state church here in the United States of America.
[03:40:31.800 --> 03:40:34.800]  And I'm really ticked off about it.
[03:40:34.800 --> 03:40:41.800]  What church is this? Do you mean like a denomination?
[03:40:41.800 --> 03:40:53.800]  It's a certain sociopolitical world, global entity, headed by Pope Francis. It is the mother of it all. They're encouraging. They're encouraging.
[03:40:53.800 --> 03:41:02.800]  See, there was a war in Mexico, Matt, called the Cristero War. In the US, Vietnam, there were 57,000 American soldiers killed.
[03:41:02.800 --> 03:41:14.800]  In the Cristero's War, there were 50,000 Mexicans killed on each side. It was very bloody. And this was a counter-revolution to their last revolution under Pancho Villa and Francisco Madero.
[03:41:14.800 --> 03:41:26.800]  It went on for 20 or 30 years. There were assassinations. There were bombings. It was very much like the Irish Republican Army. Only it was in Mexico. And it was a few years back.
[03:41:26.800 --> 03:41:35.800]  It was from 1920, really, to 1950. It was so bloody, though, that it was a national scourge.
[03:41:35.800 --> 03:41:46.800]  This is the event that the Libre Institute is teaching about. They're teaching about that the Cristeros, the Vatican-backed violent terrorists, were the good guys.
[03:41:46.800 --> 03:41:55.800]  And that they had to revolt in order to restore freedom of speech as defined in our First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
[03:41:55.800 --> 03:41:58.800]  It's a twisted and it's very dangerous.
[03:41:58.800 --> 03:42:07.800]  Well, I would just say that there is absolutely a kind of a civil war going on within many of our churches and denominations.
[03:42:07.800 --> 03:42:20.800]  I wouldn't say that all Catholics are open borders traders, but as Dennis Prager often says, the most effective evangelical church of the last century has been Marxism.
[03:42:20.800 --> 03:42:39.800]  And they have really taken over a lot of main denominations. I consider the current Pope to be primarily a Marxist and only, incidentally, a Catholic, which I think he just uses as a cover for spreading his version of Marxism.
[03:42:39.800 --> 03:42:51.800]  We'll be taking some more calls on the other side of the break now, and we've got a full board, so we'll get back to the next call, which will be Richard in California.

[03:47:14.800 --> 03:47:27.800]  Okay, before we get back to the calls, I was just scanning info wars. And this is interesting.
[03:47:27.800 --> 03:47:34.800]  The headline is, Feds and Dyke judge for obstruction after illegal avoids ICE arrest.
[03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:44.800]  The voice deported illegal was banned from entry into the US. So you have a Massachusetts trial judge who's working with the drug dealers,
[03:47:44.800 --> 03:47:53.800]  the illegal alien drug dealers attorney to hide this guy from the ICE agents and in fact to sneak him out the back door of the courthouse.
[03:47:53.800 --> 03:48:04.800]  And what's interesting is that a US attorney in Massachusetts is now indicting this judge and the attorney. And that's what it's probably going to take is indictments of judges.
[03:48:04.800 --> 03:48:16.800]  They're not beyond law. Judges can be corrupt also. Now, this is just a Massachusetts trial judge, but I'm sure that judges around the country will be watching to see what happens.
[03:48:16.800 --> 03:48:23.800]  Because the judges really, they believe they're above the law. I mean, they absolutely do and they're making law.
[03:48:23.800 --> 03:48:38.800]  And they're picking and choosing and just even shielding illegal alien drug dealers. This is really pretty disgusting, but I guess it's a good sign that even in Massachusetts, a judge isn't above the law.
[03:48:38.800 --> 03:48:43.800]  Richard in California wants to talk about the border. Go ahead, Richard.
[03:48:43.800 --> 03:48:54.800]  Hey, how's it going? Good. Thanks for holding. No problem. Yeah, I just I had a question and then I kind of wanted to make a point about maybe your answer or something.
[03:48:54.800 --> 03:49:08.800]  When somebody is over here trying to get citizenship in California, they have to go through certain processes and let's say someone breaks the law in during that process.
[03:49:08.800 --> 03:49:20.800]  Usually what ends up happening is they'll serve their time for whatever crime it is here and then whether however the board feels, they'll send them back to wherever, obviously, across the border.
[03:49:20.800 --> 03:49:33.800]  So my question is, what's going to happen to the ones who basically have been detained and deported? And if they come back, usually that's about five to 10 years federal prison time.
[03:49:33.800 --> 03:49:41.800]  How is that going to work if they're not apprehending or if they're apprehending illegals and then releasing them?
[03:49:41.800 --> 03:49:50.800]  Well, for one thing, they can just use a different name every time they come in, unless they're in the system already and fingerprinted and so forth.
[03:49:50.800 --> 03:50:01.800]  But I really don't understand how that's going to work, but it just seems to me that if they don't inform ICE at these sanctuary cities and states, if the people reach the end of their crime,
[03:50:01.800 --> 03:50:10.800]  they treat them like an American citizen and just open the gate and say goodbye and good luck. You're back into California.
[03:50:10.800 --> 03:50:13.800]  Go ahead and get a driver's license and a voter card.
[03:50:13.800 --> 03:50:26.800]  Yep, and I've actually worked. I do a lot of construction and home restoration, so I work with a lot of these people and pretty much, for the most part, they're nice, but obviously they're still breaking the law.
[03:50:26.800 --> 03:50:49.800]  And I think I would feel more comfortable if more people would go through the process, at least legally, because that message over here in Los Angeles, the new sheriff that was elected, said on TV that he was not going to be enforcing any immigration laws in Los Angeles, California.
[03:50:49.800 --> 03:51:00.800]  In this case, I think that Trump is right. He should just send the busloads straight to Los Angeles then and drop them off right in front of that government building.
[03:51:00.800 --> 03:51:02.800]  So you want them, you got them.
[03:51:02.800 --> 03:51:19.800]  Another thing that can be done is going after the remittances. Billions and billions of dollars go out of the American economy back to the south of the border via these remittances and there's no law that says that has to be unrestricted.
[03:51:19.800 --> 03:51:31.800]  They could be any kind of a bite could be put on those remittances. That could be shut down. Jim and Georgia, more on the border. The border is really hot today. Go ahead, Jim.
[03:51:31.800 --> 03:51:33.800]  I love your work.
[03:51:33.800 --> 03:51:35.800]  Thank you.
[03:51:35.800 --> 03:52:01.800]  Yes, sir. I'm very pissed off, American. I'm wondering if, honestly, as much as Trump has done, this positive, I'm looking at, I mean, he's aiding and abetting these people coming across the border.
[03:52:01.800 --> 03:52:27.800]  I don't care. I mean, tell me, how is this not treason allowing all these people come across the southern border? You got people who, you got our armed forces that are being detained by a Mexican army or whatever in our border.
[03:52:27.800 --> 03:52:45.800]  You got people who are, I don't care if the guy is a felon or not. He's helping to tame some of these people that are coming across the border illegally. I don't care about whether he's felon and has a gun or not.
[03:52:45.800 --> 03:53:03.800]  I think that, first, you can't compare something to perfection only to reality. If Hillary had been the president, just imagine, everything that's happening would be 10 times worse in terms of the numbers coming across the border.
[03:53:03.800 --> 03:53:24.800]  I do believe that the president, it would be within his right, his constitutional authority, to completely seal the border, to put the military on the border. Even without building a wall, you could unroll a five-layer pyramid of concertina wire everywhere that there's no fence and put soldiers every 100 feet.
[03:53:24.800 --> 03:53:41.800]  And anybody gets near the barbed wire, tear gas, pepper spray. It could be done. I think that the bad press, the really scorching media attention that Trump got for the so-called children in cages, which of course were actually pictures from the Obama era,
[03:53:41.800 --> 03:53:56.800]  I think that's got his advisors very concerned about how that will be spun in the media. But I think it's getting so bad that the president could be much more hardline. And after this incident with the army soldiers being detained and disarmed,
[03:53:56.800 --> 03:54:13.800]  I think that he is pissed. And I think that we are sending more armed troops to the border. What comes of it, I don't know, but what's unsustainable is 1,500 being released by DHS every day. But what's the alternative?
[03:54:13.800 --> 03:54:28.800]  You can't put them in 10 cities indefinitely. Federal judges have said 20 days, that's it. On the other hand, if you just put the concertina wire, you know, five-layer pyramid all the way across the border, back it up with soldiers and pepper spray,
[03:54:28.800 --> 03:54:43.800]  I'd say keep them out of the United States. There's no rational country in the world which just allows itself to be invaded. That's not a country anymore. If it's our country, then we can control our border.
[03:54:43.800 --> 03:55:02.800]  And if hordes and hordes of Guatemalans are virtually escorted by the Mexicans across 1,000 miles of Mexico to flood into our country, I say put it on to Mexico. Keep them in Mexico, let those refugee camps in 10 cities arise on the Mexican side of the border.
[03:55:02.800 --> 03:55:14.800]  That's the only time that Mexico is going to take this issue by the horns and really deal with it is when they're not just a turnstile operation, cartels collecting money to take them to the border.
[03:55:14.800 --> 03:55:26.800]  DHS takes them to the phony charities who then get paid per head to distribute them. I'd say put them in northern Mexico on the other side of concertina wire.
[03:55:26.800 --> 03:55:38.800]  Anybody gets within 100 feet of the concertina wire, pepper spray, loudspeakers, leaflets, pepper spray. It's our national right to do this. I mean, that's what we have a country for.
[03:55:38.800 --> 03:55:47.800]  Mark in Oregon, I see, wants to talk about one of my favorite people, Stuart Rhodes. Go ahead, Mark. Are you there?
[03:55:47.800 --> 03:55:50.800]  Yeah, pleasure, honor to speak with you, Matt. How are you doing, sir?
[03:55:50.800 --> 03:55:52.800]  Thanks, good.
[03:55:52.800 --> 03:56:05.800]  Good, Matt. You know, it's a lot to squeeze in here. It looks like we've got a minute or so, but basically I've become very disillusioned with Trump and especially the last several months as the border is really hemorrhaging now.
[03:56:05.800 --> 03:56:23.800]  Now, I want to say concerning that, Matt, that Obama, by executive order, created the cash and release policy, which is allowing this mass invasion, which is designed and intended to destroy any vestige of the America that was.
[03:56:23.800 --> 03:56:35.800]  Trump could issue an executive order, which could remove the cash and release policy immediately. He's not doing that. Neither is he doing anything about Internet censorship.
[03:56:35.800 --> 03:56:46.800]  He basically didn't follow through with Bobby Kennedy Jr. on setting up a vaccination commission, which would clean up the vaccinations to get rid of him immediately.
[03:56:46.800 --> 03:56:54.800]  It's just basically, Matt, I'm at this point completely disillusioned. It looks like the economy, everybody's done well enough.
[03:56:54.800 --> 03:57:11.800]  Rising tide raises all ships at the same time. The corporate world, which is the Illuminati in any country and in this country, of course, has gained records in their stock values and in their profits.
[03:57:11.800 --> 03:57:23.800]  I see that being aside from policy-wise from watching out for the life and limb of the American people.
[03:57:23.800 --> 03:57:33.800]  Yeah, well, I mean, we have to compare what we have to reality, not to what we wish. There's no man on a white horse coming to save us.
[03:57:33.800 --> 03:57:42.800]  The country is in dire straits, and I guess Trump is the best that we've got. We'll have to see where it goes from there.
[03:58:03.800 --> 03:58:20.800]  We have developed, hands down, from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[03:58:20.800 --> 03:58:29.800]  There's nothing else like it. You must experience it. It is a total game changer, and it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:58:29.800 --> 03:58:39.800]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong. It lasts 10 hours, so take a half pack at the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:58:39.800 --> 03:59:03.800]  TurboForce at InfoWarsLive.com. I've got a big announcement to make. We've got four or five positions in IT and a bunch of very exciting projects we want to launch. If you see things going on at InfoWars that you want to make better, and if you want to really be involved in the heart of the fight against the globalists, send your resumes,
[03:59:03.800 --> 03:59:13.800]  quickly, confidential and private, to techjobsatinfowars.com. Again, we've got four or five places we want to fill and a lot of news, secret projects going on.
[03:59:13.800 --> 03:59:21.800]  The point is, if you want to build freedom in this country and promote free speech, and you want to help InfoWars go to the next level, we want to hire you.
[03:59:21.800 --> 03:59:31.800]  Send your resumes to techjobsatinfowars.com today. I look forward to meeting some of you and shaking your hand and having you jump on Millennium Falcon to start Episode 4.
[03:59:31.800 --> 03:59:34.800]  Because that's what you're going to be doing. This is the real ticket to adventure.
