[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:36.200]  Texas Alex Jones welcome my friends we are live thank you so much for joining
[00:36.200 --> 00:42.520]  us it is the 26th day of August 2011 on this Friday edition we're gonna have
[00:42.520 --> 00:46.400]  wide-open phones throughout the entire three hours of the transmission today and
[00:46.400 --> 00:50.080]  of course we have our weekly visit on the economy and the geopolitical
[00:50.080 --> 00:54.480]  developments with Bob Chapman our regular Friday guest in the third hour
[00:54.480 --> 01:00.560]  today Ben Bernanke came out and said we're not gonna do QE3 but as Dr. Paul
[01:00.560 --> 01:04.880]  Craig Roberts said yesterday they're already engaging in different types of
[01:04.880 --> 01:12.640]  stealth QE3 with the private Federal Reserve buying with fiat made up digital
[01:12.640 --> 01:22.120]  numbers 70 plus percent and growing of US Treasury bonds now Bernanke's also
[01:22.120 --> 01:27.120]  called on Congress for another stimulus so that's something that will also
[01:27.120 --> 01:33.560]  increase obviously the debt and pump more dollars into the economy not
[01:33.560 --> 01:39.040]  actually growing the real economy just devaluing currency further it will slow
[01:39.040 --> 01:45.280]  the slide into abject depression in the short term but in the end only make it
[01:45.280 --> 01:49.520]  worse when it finally completely melts down and that's what we've been telling
[01:49.520 --> 01:53.120]  you for over three years with the last two stimuluses and all the different
[01:53.120 --> 01:56.440]  banker bailouts and the things that we've seen and when there is a bailout of
[01:56.440 --> 02:00.080]  General Motors they move to China they move to Brazil they move to Eastern
[02:00.080 --> 02:04.360]  Europe it's the same thing with these big megabanks they're given trillions and
[02:04.360 --> 02:08.720]  trillions of dollars and then they basically just take that money hoard it
[02:08.720 --> 02:13.360]  and don't learn out to the public so we're gonna be going over that financial
[02:13.360 --> 02:18.640]  news stocks declined when Fed offers no new measures so they're officially
[02:18.640 --> 02:28.320]  announcing the end of the QE2 you know we ought to get Max Kaiser I just to pop
[02:28.320 --> 02:32.320]  in for 10 minutes sometime today because I want to get his view on that we
[02:32.320 --> 02:37.080]  ought to give him a ring and see if he could join us on the phone or via via
[02:37.080 --> 02:42.760]  Skype from his home if if not we'll probably get him to pop in Sunday with
[02:42.760 --> 02:46.560]  us obviously we'll get Bob Chapman's take on that but I like to get multiple
[02:46.560 --> 02:55.440]  views on the situation now I saw two articles out NYPD confirms CIA officer
[02:55.440 --> 02:59.760]  works at department this is out of the Associated Press this is completely
[02:59.760 --> 03:04.840]  illegal and actually Homeland Security has admitted since before it existed
[03:04.840 --> 03:11.560]  officially before it was given cabinet power in 2002 the fledgling organization
[03:11.560 --> 03:17.520]  in late 2001 admitted that they had CIA agents in every major city and even many
[03:17.520 --> 03:22.800]  small towns this is a organization caught trafficking narcotics weapons
[03:22.800 --> 03:28.320]  worldwide engaged in every form of just absolute evil you can imagine that is the
[03:28.320 --> 03:33.400]  actual field operatives the analyst are a different different group all together
[03:33.400 --> 03:42.240]  more diverse but NYPD confirms CIA officer works at department of course
[03:42.240 --> 03:47.320]  there's several federal laws barring that but federal laws aren't to be followed
[03:47.320 --> 03:50.560]  there's a lot of laws against warrantless wiretapping of citizens but
[03:50.560 --> 03:57.440]  they they do it here's another one CIA demands cuts in book about 9-1-1 and
[03:57.440 --> 04:02.840]  terror fight they're demanding a whole bunch of stuff be cut out of memoirs of
[04:02.840 --> 04:07.960]  an FBI agent well what is that their business here domestically we all know
[04:07.960 --> 04:14.680]  that the CIA obviously knows the truth about 9-11 low-grade moron who's looked
[04:14.680 --> 04:18.480]  at the facts we know the truth about 9-11 and the CIA knows that they are up
[04:18.480 --> 04:24.320]  to their eyeballs in it and with Al Qaeda all over the world speaking of Al
[04:24.320 --> 04:28.440]  Qaeda all over the world I want to pull up the articles because I just saw this
[04:28.440 --> 04:31.800]  before I went live they came and plopped a new article down in front of me but
[04:31.800 --> 04:36.640]  remember our military sources in full wars comm military sources ground
[04:36.640 --> 04:43.320]  invasion in late September or early October here's the quote Gaddafi feared
[04:43.320 --> 04:50.920]  the US full-scale ground invasion in late September or October so showing that
[04:50.920 --> 04:53.880]  we're getting the same information we were getting from military sources
[04:53.880 --> 04:58.240]  all right we'll be right back big transmission line of the day oh and

[07:13.840 --> 07:17.040]  take care of your health and your own family now this man has made some
[07:17.040 --> 07:21.280]  outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you
[07:21.280 --> 07:25.240]  see he predicted the collapse of GM Danny May, Freddie Mac and America's
[07:25.240 --> 07:29.120]  biggest small-owner general-growth properties in fact Barron's called his

[08:00.600 --> 08:11.920]  ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network it is
[08:11.920 --> 08:20.360]  Friday my friends the 26th day of August 2011 we are of course moving
[08:20.360 --> 08:27.000]  quickly towards the 10th anniversary of the tragic events of 9-11 and we're
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.520]  going to go through a special report dealing with the fact a little bit later
[08:30.520 --> 08:36.720]  in the broadcast that the 9-11 first responders have been barred from the
[08:36.720 --> 08:40.800]  ceremony I know I've been talking a lot about this because it is just so
[08:40.800 --> 08:45.640]  incredibly outrageous that they're not gonna have any of them there they said
[08:45.640 --> 08:49.840]  they will recognize them perhaps having a fire chief or police chief there who
[08:49.840 --> 08:55.600]  will thank them the big question this tells you so much is why aren't they
[08:55.600 --> 08:59.600]  allowed to be there when I open the phones up I'd like to get your your view
[08:59.600 --> 09:05.600]  on that and then obviously any other subjects you want to raise also there's
[09:05.600 --> 09:11.880]  another report that's up at info wars.com from here in Austin Texas and
[09:11.880 --> 09:16.600]  I've got Paul Watson writing a blurb and and the reason the phones aren't open
[09:16.600 --> 09:21.000]  yet is that I know he's a daily listener and calls in when he can get
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.520]  through routinely you've heard him announce himself as Ronnie Reeferseed
[09:25.520 --> 09:32.320]  and he he does that to brand himself as a hemp activist who talks about you know
[09:32.320 --> 09:37.440]  how it's a better cash crop than even cotton and can produce wonderful bio
[09:37.440 --> 09:44.040]  fuels well man banned from Austin City Council by mayor for stating his name
[09:44.040 --> 09:48.600]  and Drudge obviously earlier in the week thought it was pretty newsworthy that
[09:48.600 --> 09:52.800]  we did an article about an Ohio congressman at a public town hall telling
[09:52.800 --> 09:58.440]  people no video cameras allowed quote to protect his constituents and not
[09:58.440 --> 10:02.080]  embarrass anyone because he knew there were some people there that disagreed
[10:02.080 --> 10:05.640]  with him and were sitting there peacefully mainly old ladies in their
[10:05.640 --> 10:09.280]  seats from the activist group that wanted to ask him questions so the cops
[10:09.280 --> 10:12.480]  went over and manhandled people and took their cameras and you've seen court
[10:12.480 --> 10:16.080]  site where citizens communication you try to get up and say I don't want my
[10:16.080 --> 10:21.520]  taxes raised and they say sorry I don't like you saying that you're arrested and
[10:21.520 --> 10:25.560]  the mayor's like but it's the rules it's state law she's being polite she's
[10:25.560 --> 10:29.040]  trying to speak and they just said you're fired to mayor but you can't fire
[10:29.040 --> 10:34.640]  the mayor yeah we got the police police take them out of here I mean I'm seeing
[10:34.640 --> 10:40.560]  these type of events every couple days now and so the phones are not open yet
[10:40.560 --> 10:46.120]  except for Ronnie reforcede if he wants to call in now he's called before and
[10:46.120 --> 10:49.280]  said Alex in fact he came down to the Capitol at one of our demonstrations
[10:49.280 --> 10:53.160]  against the TSA one of our stormings of the capitals he said why am I banned
[10:53.160 --> 10:58.360]  from your show and you're not banned you get on sometimes it's just that if I'm
[10:58.360 --> 11:01.560]  seeing first-time callers and then I go to somebody and clearly it's you
[11:01.560 --> 11:05.640]  disguising your voice I'm saying first-time callers that's their time to
[11:05.640 --> 11:10.680]  call in but we'd love to hear from you now Ronnie reforcede and we'll play that
[11:10.680 --> 11:17.760]  clip if and when you call in 800-259-9231 John Harmon knows his voice
[11:17.760 --> 11:23.440]  well so no one try to impersonate Ronnie reforcede he's a nice fellow I'm quite
[11:23.440 --> 11:27.840]  eloquent when he actually covers issues but he's been thrown out of the county
[11:27.840 --> 11:31.840]  commissioners for trying to talk he's polite he's been thrown out of the city
[11:31.840 --> 11:35.080]  council you know the city council in Austin's done what many councils have
[11:35.080 --> 11:41.080]  done around the country you could speak on any agenda item but now they
[11:41.080 --> 11:45.760]  published it a week before and make you go down in person and sign up to speak
[11:45.760 --> 11:49.800]  for your three minutes and then they'll get up and walk away when you're
[11:49.800 --> 11:55.720]  speaking we've had doctors flying in like Dr. Conant to just to say counsel I've
[11:55.720 --> 12:04.000]  brought another scientist with me your own FDA scientist have gone public as
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.880]  well as EPA scientist and have said it's deadly and causing massive bone cancer
[12:08.880 --> 12:12.040]  increases I'd like to give you these documents and the mayor just gets up
[12:12.040 --> 12:16.960]  and walks off or ignores them and this is part of their arrogance I remember
[12:16.960 --> 12:20.520]  when I went down to the city council I don't know five six years ago it's in my
[12:20.520 --> 12:24.800]  film Matrix of Evil and we had a hundreds and hundreds of people down there to
[12:24.800 --> 12:28.640]  try to get the city council to pass a resolution saying they'll follow the
[12:28.640 --> 12:33.280]  Bill of Rights and Constitution and nullify the Patriot Act at at the
[12:33.280 --> 12:39.040]  county and city level and hundreds of cities by now it's over 804 states had
[12:39.040 --> 12:44.440]  had done similar things and I got up to speak and I've been given the time
[12:44.440 --> 12:47.720]  they've since I've been told gotten rid of that where people can basically try to
[12:47.720 --> 12:50.800]  give you their time sometimes they'll allow it sometimes they don't and I've
[12:50.800 --> 12:56.320]  been given people's times where like 15 minutes and the mayor just said I've
[12:56.320 --> 13:01.040]  got to go but I'll I'll be listening you know in the back room and they all
[13:01.040 --> 13:05.600]  laughed it was very very funny but I got up and I think gave one of my best ever
[13:05.600 --> 13:09.600]  heartfelt speeches to them and I said this is not a laughing matter this is
[13:09.600 --> 13:13.080]  not a game you get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution none of us are
[13:13.080 --> 13:21.080]  safe this is what makes America America please do the right thing and pass this
[13:21.080 --> 13:28.880]  resolution and they did narrowly pass it Max Kaiser is going to be popping in at
[13:28.880 --> 13:34.080]  11 30 for just about 10 minutes and then at 12 30 we're gonna have Lou Rockwell
[13:34.080 --> 13:40.680]  on it is taped but it's premiering on the radio here for everyone what we're
[13:40.680 --> 13:44.600]  gonna be doing with the nightly TV show that officially kicks off next
[13:44.600 --> 13:54.680]  Thursday September 1st 7 p.m. Central every night is we're going to basically
[13:54.680 --> 14:01.400]  take clips say of Ron Paul's on or of Lou Rockwell's on or Max Kaiser or any of
[14:01.400 --> 14:05.720]  the regular guests we have but many many other guests were lining up just just
[14:05.720 --> 14:09.480]  dozens and dozens of really informative people to be on the show every night
[14:09.480 --> 14:14.560]  sometimes we'll have several interviews news packages if you want to see
[14:14.560 --> 14:18.520]  something close to what you're going to be seeing next week it's the special
[14:18.520 --> 14:27.520]  report we did last night that is now posted for members at prisonplanet.tv
[14:27.520 --> 14:32.440]  like let me just go to prisonplanet.tv I don't even know what we called the
[14:32.440 --> 14:41.760]  special report last night it aired from like 7 to 8 o'clock last night but
[14:41.760 --> 14:51.440]  again if you go to prisonplanet.tv it's not it's it's not not posted up there
[14:51.440 --> 14:56.760]  yet I mean I know it's posted in the live show area because you have you have
[14:56.760 --> 15:04.560]  this radio show that's three hours long every day posted as a second show right
[15:04.560 --> 15:08.560]  now these special reports are going as like a second show so it's in the daily
[15:08.560 --> 15:12.040]  show archive area you'll just see two shows for the day that normally Paul
[15:12.040 --> 15:16.920]  makes a banner and then posted up there so people can find that specifically
[15:16.920 --> 15:21.880]  we're reworking the site it's going to launch early next week where it's a lot
[15:21.880 --> 15:25.680]  easier to navigate for people that are new users who would have already happened
[15:25.680 --> 15:30.560]  but one of our programmers was out the family issue so we're very very close
[15:30.560 --> 15:34.080]  to that but I talked to Watson earlier because I'm getting a lot of emails and
[15:34.080 --> 15:38.240]  a lot of calls and a lot of comments and like every article it's like where is it
[15:38.240 --> 15:42.680]  you know it needs to be in a special report area it needs to be in a live
[15:42.680 --> 15:49.520]  area it needs to be somewhere where we can get to it easier and I know you can
[15:49.520 --> 15:59.760]  go right up the top of prisonplanet.tv and you can click on the Alex Jones live
[15:59.760 --> 16:04.520]  area and then there's the archive of it I understand that but it it again we're
[16:04.520 --> 16:07.400]  having a new system where the nightly news is in one spot clearly on its own
[16:07.400 --> 16:12.080]  page the special reports are on another page the daily radio TV show Alex Jones
[16:12.080 --> 16:16.240]  live we're calling it that's going to be in its own area because we're so busy
[16:16.240 --> 16:21.720]  producing all this media and then like burying I'm gonna call Watson right now
[16:21.720 --> 16:27.160]  I know in between his hundreds of duties he is he told me not far I went live
[16:27.160 --> 16:31.720]  that it was there so I could so I could direct people to that the point is is
[16:31.720 --> 16:37.760]  that we're gonna take clips we're gonna take clips and and hold on one second
[16:37.760 --> 16:41.200]  Paul we're gonna take clips and and really powerful pieces of the nightly
[16:41.200 --> 16:44.800]  news and then air it on the radio every day so even if you're not a prison
[16:44.800 --> 16:48.960]  planet TV member you'll get some of the key news and highlights here hey Paul

[25:10.600 --> 25:15.000]  watching and listening to is a local Austin activist who goes by Ronnie
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  Reeferseed and he's branded himself as that it it actually does get him
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.960]  attention and he's a hemp activist and a lot of you've heard him as a caller into
[25:22.960 --> 25:28.240]  this show and he was listening and he did call in because on all three Austin
[25:28.240 --> 25:33.040]  News channels this morning this was on on television it was on radio on every
[25:33.040 --> 25:40.440]  channel I tuned into 590 a.m. 93.7 KLBJ I tuned into another station driving in
[25:40.440 --> 25:45.200]  this is all they're talking about in Austin is why did the mayor have this
[25:45.200 --> 25:51.520]  guy drug out by police and banned for one year from coming into the Austin
[25:51.520 --> 25:55.280]  City Council and then I'm told some of the other activists that were there who
[25:55.280 --> 25:59.920]  just said hey that's not right they were thrown out and banned for a period and to
[25:59.920 --> 26:04.160]  tell us exactly what happened is the man himself Ronnie Reeferseed this is what
[26:04.160 --> 26:08.640]  we see in Ohio at a public meeting and them and the congressman saying police
[26:08.640 --> 26:12.560]  take these old ladies cameras who are peaceably sitting there taping but
[26:12.560 --> 26:17.320]  letting the news continue to film is what we see in court side Arizona all
[26:17.320 --> 26:21.240]  over the country government saying you can't sell tomatoes on a street corner
[26:21.240 --> 26:26.320]  there's been more arrest and fines today with people selling lemonade across the
[26:26.320 --> 26:30.960]  country from California to Massachusetts this is going on everywhere you can't
[26:30.960 --> 26:34.520]  have a garden in your front yard now you can't have it in your backyard even if
[26:34.520 --> 26:37.440]  you live in a rural area they're saying you can't have chickens now I saw that
[26:37.440 --> 26:43.400]  report yesterday government thinks that it owns us and Lee Liffingwell is an
[26:43.400 --> 26:50.400]  absolute joke he's one of these Terry town little globalist minions busy
[26:50.400 --> 26:53.880]  handing our infrastructure over to the New World Order trying to take over our
[26:53.880 --> 26:59.200]  roads for toll companies what a joke of a city council we have what a sickening
[26:59.200 --> 27:04.560]  display of petty tyrants but Austin deserves it because you let these scum
[27:04.560 --> 27:11.240]  do it in fact let's play a clip of Liffingwell being a tyrant then we'll
[27:11.240 --> 27:19.400]  go back to Ronnie Reeferseed look let's play that clip here it is you'll need to
[27:19.400 --> 27:24.440]  turn it up Mona Gonzalez said they'll be ordering the chamber or we'll clear the
[27:24.440 --> 27:41.400]  chamber let's just go to Ronnie Reeferseed Ronnie exactly what happened
[27:41.400 --> 27:48.640]  well thank you sir yes it was as you were saying I was as usual trying to
[27:48.640 --> 27:56.280]  introduce myself as I usually do and that is of course Ronnie and that's
[27:56.280 --> 28:01.120]  relatively mild now what I'd recently done was I had I put a raspberry on the
[28:01.120 --> 28:04.160]  end of it with fingers coming out of my ears wiggling my finger you know the
[28:04.160 --> 28:09.760]  thumbs of my ears wiggling my fingers that one little added extra level step
[28:09.760 --> 28:14.400]  to it took the mayor out of his chair and just he just blew up like a spoiled
[28:14.400 --> 28:19.040]  child and said no no no we can't do you can't do that that offends me that's
[28:19.040 --> 28:24.680]  right you can't defile his supreme parasiticness and so you're meant to
[28:24.680 --> 28:29.400]  grovel you don't you don't go before an imperial ruler and you know our
[28:29.400 --> 28:33.840]  president isn't called your excellency or your supremeness in other countries
[28:33.840 --> 28:40.640]  they are and our American system is about pulling down disgusting leaders and
[28:40.640 --> 28:44.360]  not treating them with respect when they don't treat us with respect so you
[28:44.360 --> 28:49.520]  you've done your sacrament your your your thing you enjoy so much that's your
[28:49.520 --> 28:55.040]  free speech what else happened there at the event well actually I didn't even
[28:55.040 --> 28:59.240]  do it I you know they were planned in other words the it was packed with
[28:59.240 --> 29:03.320]  police for some reason unlike any of the time it was packed with police so they
[29:03.320 --> 29:07.120]  were ready to do something I think to me and they were expecting me to do the
[29:07.120 --> 29:10.920]  full thing including the raspberry at the end of it yes you told us about that
[29:10.920 --> 29:15.360]  yeah but I did not do that I just did the mild version that I just recently
[29:15.360 --> 29:20.640]  did for you and that still he he pretended it's if I'd done the raspberry
[29:20.640 --> 29:24.960]  and he blew up and he called the police over so it was just his overreaction
[29:24.960 --> 29:29.160]  you know I mean he's obviously out of control and what about this issue of
[29:29.160 --> 29:35.160]  you being banned from the imperial court for one year that's what the security
[29:35.160 --> 29:38.800]  guard came up to me afterwards and said they've got a rule that if you cross
[29:38.800 --> 29:43.120]  this one very the mayor made a point that I I forget what the letter thing was
[29:43.120 --> 29:47.920]  but they made some technical thing where they said I was disturbing things I was
[29:47.920 --> 29:52.160]  disrupting the media on your public communication we're on the March the

[34:19.080 --> 34:23.960]  crew the new folks we've hired and I'm very very excited and blessed and
[34:23.960 --> 34:27.960]  thankful to be here now we're going to Max Kaiser to break down the big
[34:27.960 --> 34:34.320]  developments in the economy he's calling it countdown to meltdown as we see
[34:34.320 --> 34:38.400]  bank failures and collapses going on all over the world and Warren Buffett and
[34:38.400 --> 34:43.200]  the globalist trying to block prop up Bank of America Bernanke declaring
[34:43.200 --> 34:48.960]  there's not going to be QE3 while he goes ahead with QE3 type programs we're
[34:48.960 --> 34:53.200]  going to be talking to Max here in just a moment but finishing up with Austin
[34:53.200 --> 34:57.520]  activist and I'm going to be honest I've met Ronnie Reeferseed a couple times
[34:57.520 --> 35:04.640]  nice guy but he is annoying and I'm annoying to some as well okay and it is
[35:04.640 --> 35:08.480]  obnoxious people that get things done and he's branding that term and some
[35:08.480 --> 35:13.040]  people listen to him and he's trying to become an Austin type character
[35:13.040 --> 35:19.920]  like Leslie but in a better way and I think that's fine my only issue is that
[35:19.920 --> 35:23.800]  I just was trying to get him to talk about what happened that we didn't see
[35:23.800 --> 35:27.720]  on the camera and reportedly the mayor throwing other people out I'm told John
[35:27.720 --> 35:33.960]  Bush was you can confirm that if not one of the guys with tag what Texans or
[35:33.960 --> 35:37.600]  accountable government and just the incredible arrogance because they've
[35:37.600 --> 35:41.760]  already basically made it next to impossible to try to speak at council
[35:41.760 --> 35:45.200]  gonna sign up a week before or if you do get signed up for an agenda they'll try
[35:45.200 --> 35:50.400]  to restrict you they're very arrogant and haughty and a very nasty globalist
[35:50.400 --> 35:56.160]  carbon taxing a city council that that Austinites should get politically
[35:56.160 --> 36:01.000]  involved and defeat these scum we need patriots here not mainline liberals or
[36:01.000 --> 36:04.720]  mainline conservatives but Ronnie what else happened because this is part of a
[36:04.720 --> 36:09.360]  larger dangerous trend of shutting down lemonade stands banning cameras at
[36:09.360 --> 36:14.480]  town halls arresting people that speak in court site I mean who cares of what
[36:14.480 --> 36:19.800]  you say is a perserveration and beginning to enter the realm of a
[36:19.800 --> 36:23.920]  Tourette's Ian event I'm the same way so I'm not knocking you here we're both
[36:23.920 --> 36:27.360]  annoying creatures and I'm sure you're about to repeat the word over and over
[36:27.360 --> 36:31.760]  again the term but tell us what else happened there no I'm gonna hit you
[36:31.760 --> 36:35.160]  over the head with it I'm I really try not to be obnoxious I try to be
[36:35.160 --> 36:39.200]  articulate and one thing I have to say though that you're leaving out of my
[36:39.200 --> 36:44.000]  whole story is that I'm trying to help save our troops literally I survived a
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.440]  traumatic brain injury similar to what our troops are coming home with better
[36:48.440 --> 36:54.680]  than some worse than others and my main chemical that put me over the edge and
[36:54.680 --> 36:59.320]  back into the real world ironically was tetrahydrocannabinole somehow I can
[36:59.320 --> 37:04.160]  then somebody to bring a joint to the hospital I smoked it and the next day my
[37:04.160 --> 37:08.760]  memory came back I'm a new person I've been trying to spread the news about this
[37:08.760 --> 37:14.240]  medicinal actual miraculous giving medicinal marijuana it gave me my life
[37:14.240 --> 37:19.560]  back and that's why I'm so devoted that I never even knew that I never even knew
[37:19.560 --> 37:22.880]  that I knew that you were a hemp activist and I support that I support
[37:22.880 --> 37:27.240]  freedom across the board and I support stage right so that is wonderful news
[37:27.240 --> 37:30.680]  Ronnie we're about to go to Max Kaiser who's kind enough to join us on short
[37:30.680 --> 37:35.200]  notice here for a segment or so via Skype from Paris with some very important
[37:35.200 --> 37:41.200]  news so so finish up with any other information that happened at the City
[37:41.200 --> 37:45.880]  Council and where you're going from here because I hear legal actions are
[37:45.880 --> 37:51.360]  being prepared that's right I've got some great friends and we're moving
[37:51.360 --> 37:59.200]  forward but I it was just they shut down basically I was I was thrown out of
[37:59.200 --> 38:02.320]  there I was literally escort out of the building and the cops watched me get my
[38:02.320 --> 38:06.000]  car to leave but the people who were there stayed there they were still
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.480]  harassed they weren't allowed to speak and that's a completely new rule that
[38:10.480 --> 38:15.640]  the mayor dreamed up that the citizens can only like the the agenda was a
[38:15.640 --> 38:21.240]  hundred and fifteen items we were only allowed to speak on three three of a
[38:21.240 --> 38:26.120]  hundred and fifteen items some wacky rule he decided to come up with in those
[38:26.120 --> 38:33.800]  lockstep committee that's even if the issue was you know dealing with demo
[38:33.800 --> 38:38.320]  demolishing your house if you didn't sign up a week before you can't speak and
[38:38.320 --> 38:43.040]  if they're talking about three items that concern you or four items sorry you
[38:43.040 --> 38:46.720]  can't talk about the fourth item this is a council out of control they're out of
[38:46.720 --> 38:51.160]  control all over the country and as this develops and unfolds Ronnie Reefers he
[38:51.160 --> 38:54.960]  will continue to check in with you okay thank you so much if I'm gonna put you
[38:54.960 --> 39:01.000]  on hold and try to give you an email or something so you can stay in contact I
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.120]  know jaren asked me to give you his email I'm joking you're awesome jaren
[39:06.120 --> 39:10.320]  gets all these thousands email he's like how do I keep track of these but Ronnie
[39:10.320 --> 39:13.720]  we love you you're a great guy and I was saying that as a compliment you've got
[39:13.720 --> 39:18.080]  to be the squeaky wheel to get the grace and you certainly have gotten under
[39:18.080 --> 39:22.000]  their skin a very articulate smart guy when he's not repeating the Ronnie
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.920]  Reefers seed thing over and over again but hey that's how you brand something to
[39:24.920 --> 39:28.400]  get people to pay attention to you so I think he's a great guy and we appreciate
[39:28.400 --> 39:36.640]  you okay shifting gears Max Kaiser of the Kaiser report on RT and of course the
[39:36.640 --> 39:43.000]  on the edge on press TV and radio host you name it joins us via video Skype
[39:43.000 --> 39:48.120]  from Paris and I wanted to get him on because we've got these reports here
[39:48.120 --> 39:54.240]  Bernanke promises no new steps to boost economy Bernanke proposes no new steps
[39:54.240 --> 39:58.560]  to boost economy but hence Congress should help with a new stimulus I guess
[39:58.560 --> 40:02.080]  given a special special interest but according to Dr. Roberts and others
[40:02.080 --> 40:07.600]  we've talked to they're still really engaged in QE3 by stealth still having
[40:07.600 --> 40:12.480]  the private Federal Reserve by the Treasury bonds Max Kaiser what's really
[40:12.480 --> 40:17.120]  happening here well first of all can you hear me I have my headphones in yes
[40:17.120 --> 40:22.160]  I can I can hear you very nice headphones okay the well one of the
[40:22.160 --> 40:27.280]  interesting points that he made was that he was going to extend next month's
[40:27.280 --> 40:31.800]  federal open market committee for two days and they're going to introduce and
[40:31.800 --> 40:40.080]  talk about special tools or new tools to keep quantitative easing going and the
[40:40.080 --> 40:44.680]  fact that he's not introducing quantitative easing 3 as you point out
[40:44.680 --> 40:49.760]  the market is still not suffering in terms of where the bond prices are bond
[40:49.760 --> 40:53.440]  prices are still being held up so clearly somebody's doing the buying and
[40:53.440 --> 40:58.880]  that somebody is the federal government and so I think what they're doing is
[40:58.880 --> 41:06.080]  they're waiting to back end some big surprises in next month's meeting which
[41:06.080 --> 41:09.880]  would be the September federal open market committee meeting but this is the
[41:09.880 --> 41:13.720]  some of the tools that they could be used I think we're seeing what's happening
[41:13.720 --> 41:19.240]  in countries like Switzerland which is now charging people to keep money in
[41:19.240 --> 41:23.680]  banks in Switzerland that's a negative interest rate and I think this is part
[41:23.680 --> 41:26.760]  of the toolbox that they're going to introduce so when you have a hundred
[41:26.760 --> 41:30.120]  thousand dollars at the bank or even ten thousand dollars or one thousand dollars
[41:30.120 --> 41:35.320]  at the bank they'll charge you one or two percent as a cost remember only a
[41:35.320 --> 41:39.040]  couple of years ago you might get one or two percent an interest now they'll
[41:39.040 --> 41:43.240]  charge you one or two percent to store your money the theory being that this
[41:43.240 --> 41:47.760]  will encourage people to take their money out of the bank and spend it on
[41:47.760 --> 41:52.720]  stocks or spend it on consumer items to get the economy going and that's one
[41:52.720 --> 41:59.360]  of the so-called special tools that I think we're gonna see next month now in
[41:59.360 --> 42:02.680]  your email this morning when we contacted you and asked you to come on you
[42:02.680 --> 42:07.560]  fired back with basically saying banks are getting ready to melt down all over
[42:07.560 --> 42:12.800]  the world and you listed some countries mainly in Europe and then you said one
[42:12.800 --> 42:17.920]  two three meltdown so I guess this little segment could be called one two
[42:17.920 --> 42:24.280]  three meltdown max what does one two three meltdown mean okay well starting
[42:24.280 --> 42:28.480]  in two and then of course 2008 we had the collapse of Lehman Brothers and Bear
[42:28.480 --> 42:32.480]  Stearns and everyone became aware of this global financial crisis we've been
[42:32.480 --> 42:37.960]  playing a global game of past the grenade and the grenade is fifty
[42:37.960 --> 42:43.320]  trillion dollars in debt and various countries are playing this game of past
[42:43.320 --> 42:46.520]  the grenade and if you look at the Financial Times you'll see this being
[42:46.520 --> 42:52.840]  played out every single day so in Greece they've announced that Finland is not
[42:52.840 --> 42:56.800]  happy with the collateral that they're getting in exchange for debt forgiveness
[42:56.800 --> 43:01.760]  in that country so now the ECB is coming in to guarantee more backstop on the
[43:01.760 --> 43:06.080]  Greek economy collapsing so they're trying to pass the grenade in France as I
[43:06.080 --> 43:10.080]  spoke to you on the last time I was on your show society general major bank here
[43:10.080 --> 43:13.640]  in France technically insolvent the biggest player and the biggest bailout
[43:13.640 --> 43:19.960]  recipient there for the AIG collapsed in 2008 they're on a tinder box they are in
[43:19.960 --> 43:23.760]  the process of needing some major bailout they're about to go belly up and of
[43:23.760 --> 43:28.280]  course Bank of America here in the United States a week ago they said we
[43:28.280 --> 43:31.560]  don't need capital but then Warren Buffett said well I know you don't need
[43:31.560 --> 43:36.320]  capital but here's five billion dollars anyway and by the way I'm gonna charge
[43:36.320 --> 43:39.800]  you seven percent on that money even though you could get it same deal from
[43:39.800 --> 43:44.280]  the Fed it's for a quarter of one percent and you also they're selling their
[43:44.280 --> 43:49.120]  big stake in China construction bank today to raise capital as desperately as
[43:49.120 --> 43:51.880]  they possibly can because Bank of America the second biggest bank in
[43:51.880 --> 43:57.040]  America is insolvent so is society general so are the banks in Greece so
[43:57.040 --> 44:02.400]  this game of global past the financial grenade is speeding up the stakes are
[44:02.400 --> 44:07.280]  getting higher and we see it happening in in live now in real time with news
[44:07.280 --> 44:11.200]  coming out and as a result Alex the markets themselves you see these
[44:11.200 --> 44:15.560]  enormous swings and volatility the stock market up and down four or five hundred
[44:15.560 --> 44:19.320]  points price of gold up and down two or three percentage points in a day because
[44:19.320 --> 44:24.960]  the markets themselves are reflecting this unfolding chaos this unfolding
[44:24.960 --> 44:30.760]  meltdown banking meltdown and Bernanke of course without being able to offer any
[44:30.760 --> 44:34.440]  leadership whatsoever he's simply keeping the can down the road and saying well
[44:34.440 --> 44:39.080]  next month we'll get to it with special tools that will will pull out of our
[44:39.080 --> 44:43.240]  magic bag of tricks next month in the meantime we're just gonna continue to
[44:43.240 --> 44:48.080]  buy these debts and the shadow banking system we're gonna encourage you're
[44:48.080 --> 44:52.240]  gonna increase the debts in the US which is only making the situation much much
[44:52.240 --> 44:56.680]  worse that's right so when the chickens do fully come home to roost it'll be
[44:56.680 --> 45:00.960]  much much worse as Ron Paul and many other people have broken down and now
[45:00.960 --> 45:05.560]  you call it past the grenade or musical chairs and the person that gets
[45:05.560 --> 45:10.880]  left standing when the music stops basically and burst into flame you can
[45:10.880 --> 45:21.560]  also liken it to a revolver with say 15 chambers in it and there's a round in
[45:21.560 --> 45:25.360]  one of them and so they spin the cylinder and they hand it to Europe then
[45:25.360 --> 45:29.120]  back to the US and then to England and then they hand it to Asia then they
[45:29.120 --> 45:32.960]  handed to Latin America so they're trying to trying to pass the grenade
[45:32.960 --> 45:38.000]  around but even as they're passing it around max we we see the blood running
[45:38.000 --> 45:43.160]  out of the economy worldwide so I go back to this as we get closer and closer
[45:43.160 --> 45:47.880]  to this event horizon that dr. Roberts was talking about yesterday where there
[45:47.880 --> 45:52.360]  is no point of return he believes there is a point of return if they reverse
[45:52.360 --> 45:56.400]  these policies but they're not reversing them because it's command destruction
[45:56.400 --> 46:00.240]  they are wrecking the global economy massing all the assets in their hands
[46:00.240 --> 46:04.640]  then they'll blow out the dummy banks later the elites will be left holding
[46:04.640 --> 46:09.600]  all the quote resources and then we'll be there their their debt slaves so so
[46:09.600 --> 46:14.520]  so what's the time frame here max on how you see all of this basically playing
[46:14.520 --> 46:19.800]  out well what's being sacrificed in the interim what's being sacrificed today
[46:19.800 --> 46:24.080]  are various countries sovereignty so in the case of Greece they've lost their
[46:24.080 --> 46:28.040]  sovereignty in the case of Ireland they've lost their sovereignty Iceland
[46:28.040 --> 46:31.880]  maintain their sovereignty only by kicking the bankers out and prosecuting
[46:31.880 --> 46:36.240]  them and chasing them into London where they're hiding out and by letting their
[46:36.240 --> 46:39.920]  economy collapse but they're the exception so but very these countries are
[46:39.920 --> 46:44.480]  in turn losing their sovereignty and the way that it happens is that because
[46:44.480 --> 46:49.840]  there's no leadership from a Bernanke or an Obama they keep deferring to the Bank
[46:49.840 --> 46:53.320]  of International Settlements or the World Bank or the International Monetary
[46:53.320 --> 46:57.600]  Fund which of course are global institutions so the so Bernanke and
[46:57.600 --> 47:03.560]  Obama are swapping America's sovereignty to avoid having to deal with this
[47:03.560 --> 47:08.360]  problem today and that's happening right now so the timeline is today America is
[47:08.360 --> 47:12.680]  in the process of losing its sovereignty today because the financial
[47:12.680 --> 47:18.040]  decisions that will affect America's future are being being discussed in the
[47:18.040 --> 47:23.000]  hallways in the conference rooms in Brussels in Switzerland in Europe and
[47:23.000 --> 47:27.240]  around the world they're not being discussed by Obama Obama has essentially
[47:27.240 --> 47:30.400]  abdicated his role as president of the United States he's now just a
[47:30.400 --> 47:36.080]  functionary waiting for instructions from these global bankers who have taken on
[47:36.080 --> 47:40.080]  the responsibility to sort out this debt problem and they're the way that they
[47:40.080 --> 47:43.720]  sort out the debt problem is to increase the debt and that's the only thing
[47:43.720 --> 47:47.560]  they know how to do and as a result it's only making the situation much worse
[47:47.560 --> 47:51.920]  now just as a way to illustrate this Alex I thought this might be interesting
[47:51.920 --> 47:56.640]  as I was waiting to get on the show here I posted on my website two charts the
[47:56.640 --> 48:02.280]  US government tenure bond chart both the price and the yield to just give you a
[48:02.280 --> 48:06.240]  graphic illustration of the history of America's demise because if you go back
[48:06.240 --> 48:13.080]  to 1980 when the 10-year interest rate was 15 and a half percent that was the
[48:13.080 --> 48:17.600]  beginning of the Reagan revolution and the neoliberal revolution and the
[48:17.600 --> 48:22.360]  Wall Street ascent to take over the economy since that 1980 period when
[48:22.360 --> 48:26.880]  interest rates in the tenure bond were 16 and a half percent they are now at 2%
[48:26.880 --> 48:34.720]  and that is the history of America going into the debt market to finance its
[48:34.720 --> 48:39.240]  growth at some point during the past 40 years somebody should have stepped in
[48:39.240 --> 48:45.360]  and stopped that 10-year interest rate from going to 2% because 2% is like if
[48:45.360 --> 48:48.640]  you have to think of it like an EKG machine at the hospital you know when
[48:48.640 --> 48:53.040]  it gets down to the point where it's not moving anymore the patient is dead max
[48:53.040 --> 48:56.960]  let me stop you we're gonna for prison planet TV viewers radio listeners can
[48:56.960 --> 49:00.360]  go to maxkeiser.com and see these graphs but for live viewers right now
[49:00.360 --> 49:04.680]  they're watching us on TV we're gonna put the graphs up on screen so describe
[49:04.680 --> 49:09.880]  what you're talking about here right this is just a very simple graph of the
[49:09.880 --> 49:16.440]  price of a US government 10-year treasury bond going back to 1980 when the
[49:16.440 --> 49:20.040]  yield or the amount of money you get on that bond if you were a saver and you
[49:20.040 --> 49:24.800]  bought a 10-year treasury bond you'd be getting 15 and a half percent on your
[49:24.800 --> 49:28.240]  money if you're a saver if you had a pension account that's what you got on
[49:28.240 --> 49:35.000]  your money and as you see the history up until today is the slide down to 2%
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.920]  and last week it got down to below 2% underneath that chart you see the price
[49:39.920 --> 49:45.120]  of the bond markets that have gone up and up and up now the reason why it's
[49:45.120 --> 49:50.000]  important to understand this is when people talk about extend and pretend and
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.880]  dealing with the debt problems what they mean is that as long as interest rates
[49:53.880 --> 49:58.400]  are going down as you see in the top chart they can keep adding to the debt
[49:58.400 --> 50:03.680]  load and making it the debt load bigger and bigger because the interest cost on
[50:03.680 --> 50:08.840]  that debt as you see that in chart number one they keeps getting cheaper and
[50:08.840 --> 50:12.520]  cheaper and at the bottom you see the price of the bonds getting higher and
[50:12.520 --> 50:16.880]  higher and that's the dynamic that is the essential underlying dynamic driving
[50:16.880 --> 50:20.400]  40 years of financial history in America and how America went from having a half
[50:20.400 --> 50:25.160]  a trillion dollars of debt under Reagan to having 14 to 15 to 16 trillion in debt
[50:25.160 --> 50:30.160]  with stated with another 50 trillion off the books that's how they did it they
[50:30.160 --> 50:35.240]  used artificially cheap interest rates and that's a quantitative easing is
[50:35.240 --> 50:39.280]  Alex it's about the government keeping interest rates artificially cheap to
[50:39.280 --> 50:44.440]  support this bond market and that's the dynamic absolutely when we come back I
[50:44.440 --> 50:49.360]  want to get to the central issue it's horrible for us but it's good for the
[50:49.360 --> 50:54.840]  central banks they institute the crisis they pose as the saviour they take the
[50:54.840 --> 50:58.920]  system completely over and then rape us that much harder how do we get out of
[50:58.920 --> 51:04.320]  it what you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40 who
[51:04.320 --> 51:08.200]  finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again I lost 20
[51:08.200 --> 51:15.080]  pounds I lost 40 pounds I lost 55 pounds I went from a size 14 to a size 8
[51:15.080 --> 51:19.840]  their secret is amber in the revolutionary formula for women over 40
[51:19.840 --> 51:24.640]  that balances hormones naturally the leading cause of weight gain over 40 is
[51:24.640 --> 51:28.520]  hormonal imbalance until you balance your hormones losing weight can be
[51:28.520 --> 51:33.360]  practically impossible but amber in restores hormonal balance naturally so
[51:33.360 --> 51:37.960]  the weight can just fall right off even that stubborn belly fat plus amber in
[51:37.960 --> 51:42.560]  eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging like hot flashes night sweats low
[51:42.560 --> 51:47.000]  libido difficulty concentrating and more be one of the first 50 callers right

[54:29.880 --> 54:36.440]  relations and other corporate groups to influence pedal and set up vertically
[54:36.440 --> 54:41.040]  integrated pyramidal power structures in every western country they lobbied and
[54:41.040 --> 54:48.080]  over time took control of our militaries and now totally ruthless mega banks six
[54:48.080 --> 54:53.440]  of them and the private families that own and control them are establishing
[54:53.440 --> 54:59.560]  absolute domination over this country and the rest of the world they are
[54:59.560 --> 55:03.400]  funding Al Qaeda rebels openly now admitting that the West started the
[55:03.400 --> 55:08.520]  whole thing in Libya it was all staged an overthrow unbelievable humanitarian
[55:08.520 --> 55:14.240]  disaster they are now openly announcing in the last two years the solution of
[55:14.240 --> 55:17.640]  the economic crisis they created that they're admittedly the authors of it
[55:17.640 --> 55:25.760]  the derivatives fraud wrecking a once powerful sovereign nation state the
[55:25.760 --> 55:29.200]  United States and many other sovereign states taking us from the greatest
[55:29.200 --> 55:32.880]  creditor to the greatest debtor they are now openly announcing new private banks
[55:32.880 --> 55:36.560]  of the world look what max has talked about the EU they call it rise of the
[55:36.560 --> 55:41.200]  fourth right a financial dictatorship now we have the super congress in
[55:41.200 --> 55:46.880]  control of our financial system not the rest of Congress max is our weakness
[55:46.880 --> 55:52.200]  that with that some of us have a blind spot that when real tyranny actually
[55:52.200 --> 55:56.960]  takes over because it's done in a bureaucratic way and you know not some
[55:56.960 --> 56:01.920]  guy in a military outfit strutting around with a beret on that people can't
[56:01.920 --> 56:04.960]  recognize it because because they're gonna give us no quarter they are gonna
[56:04.960 --> 56:09.400]  throttle us back into the Stone Age and wreck everything I don't think people
[56:09.400 --> 56:13.280]  understand that they're not playing games they're going to totally wreck
[56:13.280 --> 56:19.440]  everything because that's their that's their financial terrorist operation well
[56:19.440 --> 56:24.640]  I think you can learn a lot from just focusing on prices and how prices
[56:24.640 --> 56:28.520]  represent themselves in the economy and how prices are trending in the economy
[56:28.520 --> 56:34.240]  so when you ask why are people acquiescent to this soft stealth coup of
[56:34.240 --> 56:39.500]  the economy it's because for those same 40 years we just talked about the
[56:39.500 --> 56:45.120]  prices of stuff like food and energy have been going down and America was
[56:45.120 --> 56:48.880]  able to outsource its labor to China which meant that you could buy clothes
[56:48.880 --> 56:55.520]  for prices that were cheaper the prices of electronics keeps going down so it's
[56:55.520 --> 57:00.080]  been an accomplished by delivering to Americans cheaper prices they go to
[57:00.080 --> 57:05.720]  Walmart they buy stuff and they get a lot you know for a dollar because it's so
[57:05.720 --> 57:11.960]  cheap because of all this really geopolitical domination that goes on in
[57:11.960 --> 57:16.640]  countries in the early phase where the crack dealer goes and gives the 10 and
[57:16.640 --> 57:21.320]  11 year old some free crack now we're we're basically zombie crack whores
[57:21.320 --> 57:25.400]  wandering around with pus coming out of our eyes right now prices are starting
[57:25.400 --> 57:31.720]  to go up so and this is what's causing the the crisis and you know that 10-year
[57:31.720 --> 57:36.820]  government bond chart that now shows getting 2% on a 10-year bond well we
[57:36.820 --> 57:40.440]  know that inflation is running four or five six percent so that means that
[57:40.440 --> 57:47.600]  you're losing money now every single year so the magic of the the post Reagan
[57:47.600 --> 57:52.480]  revolution is finished and it's running in reverse and people's purchasing power
[57:52.480 --> 57:57.880]  is collapsing and once the price of food there's a magic formula once the price
[57:57.880 --> 58:04.920]  of food gets to be 40% of your weekly budget you start to see revolutions it
[58:04.920 --> 58:08.720]  got to that point in Tunis and we saw a revolution it got to that point in
[58:08.720 --> 58:14.120]  Egypt and we saw a revolution once it gets to 40% of your budget the price of
[58:14.120 --> 58:19.960]  food and gets to 40% it tends to create a revolutionary type of situations and in
[58:19.960 --> 58:24.320]  America the price of food is now creeping up to being a major part of
[58:24.320 --> 58:28.680]  people's weekly spend their wages are going down but the price of food and
[58:28.680 --> 58:33.400]  energies are going up and this is what's causing this dynamic so now let's do five
[58:33.400 --> 58:37.220]  more minutes with us because I want to see where this dynamics leading us then
[58:37.220 --> 58:41.880]  your calls Lou Rockwell Bob Chapman and more
[58:43.400 --> 58:51.480]  this is GCN the Genesis Communications Radio Network this is Alex Jones with
[58:51.480 --> 58:55.240]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.240 --> 58:59.000]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.000 --> 59:03.520]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:03.520 --> 59:07.080]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[59:07.080 --> 59:11.400]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[59:11.400 --> 59:15.800]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[59:15.800 --> 59:19.560]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.560 --> 59:23.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.640 --> 59:27.400]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[59:27.400 --> 59:31.440]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.440 --> 59:34.160]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[59:34.160 --> 59:40.200]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[59:40.200 --> 59:44.680]  that's my solar back up dot com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go

[59:52.840 --> 01:00:00.680]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:12.160]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:19.680]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.320]  alex jones
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:28.360]  all right your phone calls are coming up in the next two segments and I've got an
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:32.480]  interview with Lerocwell coming up former campaign manager Ron Paul head of
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:36.960]  the Bonn Meese Institute of Lerocwell.com obviously that's coming up
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.400]  then Bob Chapman and phones will continue to be open with him a bunch of other
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.680]  news we haven't gotten to that's coming up as well more on that hurricane we're
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.320]  gonna break that down if it turns out like New Orleans and some city gets
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:52.480]  destroyed you know they're coming for the guns they're not bringing they're not
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.280]  bringing hot blankets they're coming to your house to take your guns so let's go
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.400]  back to Max Kaiser so Max the system knew this was coming as soon as they got
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:06.200]  rid of Glass-Steagall with similar laws in Europe the last 15 years they began
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.960]  to set up domestic police state grids and then five years ago again three years
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.520]  ago the British Ministry of Defense said we know there's a collapse of society
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.480]  coming well yeah because the banks that run things engineered this so so clearly
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:22.640]  they're creating it instead of getting in trouble for the Ponzi scheme they've
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.560]  become world rulers so so they we just stay tied to them like a bowling ball
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:31.560]  taking us to the bottom of the ocean and 10,000 pound bowling ball so we were
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:36.680]  getting to this food ratio situation so so where do you see this going how do
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:42.440]  you see this ending well they were in the end game now because I mentioned
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.080]  Glass-Steagall and I would also add the Commodity Features Modernization Act to
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.360]  that there were ways to increase the debt load that that's what made it
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.000]  possible to increase the debt load to these astronomical levels but now we
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.120]  fit debt saturation and as you point out it is a Ponzi scheme and the Ponzi
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:01.880]  scheme only works to the extent that you have new Ponzi's coming in to feed the
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:07.240]  base of the scheme but those Ponzi's aren't there anymore because people now
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:13.560]  are taking food stamps 50 million I think are on food stamps in the US and this
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:19.280]  is not a Ponzi scheme this is draining the pool of liquidity in ways that make
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:23.360]  the Ponzi scheme collapse so it's collapsing in real time it's just the
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:27.960]  way I described earlier is that it's collapsing in all over the world in
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.760]  countries at different speeds and as it falls you know when you fall off a
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:36.640]  cliff if you hit a branch on the way down it momentarily blocks you and then
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:40.880]  you then you hit the branch and then you hit and they continue to fall so as
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.280]  these countries are all falling right now they're falling at different rates
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.640]  of speed and they're encountering different problems as they're falling
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:52.840]  but they're all falling now the US dollar through World Reserve currency it's
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:57.000]  still holding up relatively to some of these other currencies however not
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.200]  against the Swiss franc or not against gold and silver. Gold and silver
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.920]  obviously are becoming the de facto global currency the only currency people
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:09.000]  around the world can trust now is gold and silver and so they're getting rid
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.640]  of all their paper money and they're going into gold and silver even though
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:18.280]  the people who manage those exchanges are raising margin rates continuously
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:22.120]  trying to stop people from buying gold and silver but here's the funny thing
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:26.120]  about that is that at some point all they're doing is they're forcing all
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:30.840]  the non leveraged players out of the gold and silver market which means that
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:35.080]  the only people left are the people who have 100% paid for the gold and silver
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:39.840]  and you have therefore created a de facto global gold standard. So short term
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.960]  they're trying to block the general public from getting into gold and silver
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.760]  by raising the margins hoping it drives it down but over time that begins to
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:55.200]  block their naked shorting that they've also been using to block it and and so
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.680]  it's it's it's kicking a lot of speculation out and turning it into a
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:02.560]  stable currency. Correct that's exactly right they're squeezing out the
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:08.520]  speculation which has a momentary sell-offs as the result but the price is
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:12.280]  still in an uptrend and the result is that you've got all cash owners it
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:17.200]  becomes a de facto global gold standard. Incredible and and then they play these
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.920]  games will they'll drive it down a hundred bucks in a day and then it shoots
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:24.760]  back up 150 the next and we see that happening today and people look at one
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:28.120]  month graphs and say well it was up and then it was down look at a year graph
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:32.680]  folks look at a ten year graph it is scary how much gold's going up because
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:37.560]  that signifies they are butchering these currencies worldwide and all these
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:42.920]  institutions grabbing their gold that was my last question Max and then I
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:46.360]  promise we'll let you go but I want to get your view because I didn't ask you
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:51.240]  this on Hugo Chavez seizing his gold back from England and other reserves
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:55.200]  around the world why is that happening and where do you see gold going two more
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.500]  minutes with Max Kaiser and Max Kaiser.com on the other side I'm Alex
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:07.760]  Joe. When you're out on the road the last place you want to be is on the road but
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:12.280]  if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.

[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:33.320]  ron paul campaign manager and chief staff gonna be joining us to talk about the incredible
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:40.040]  time magazine five page spread to convince america ron paul can't win
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:44.640]  rider states paul isn't really running for president at least not entirely i
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.480]  mean the so they're still running that hoax it blew up in their face a week and
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:53.120]  a half ago but they're back with it again and they're starting the ran paul
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:59.080]  attack stuff that they worship buddhas and you know maybe reptoids i mean it's
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:07.200]  it's it's so ridiculous and they're scared folks he is in every pole the
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:10.520]  closest to beating obama in some polls he beats him in other polls he's one
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:14.640]  point behind him perry is three points behind him met romney's five to six
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.960]  points that was in gallup yesterday in some polls ron paul is number one in
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:22.320]  scientific polls and others he's number two or number three if they gave him
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:25.680]  proper attention as the pure research admitted he gets the least amount of
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:32.160]  coverage of any republican candidate and it's almost all negative by the so-called
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:36.480]  mainstream media that only reports on itself they they play this game like we
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:41.680]  don't exist when info wars.com is roughly three times the size of msnbc's
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:46.880]  website i mean these people are legends in their own mind fox to a great extent
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:50.480]  is dwarfs these guys but they're legends in their own mind the alternative
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:58.480]  media individual personalities are towering but but in the aggregate we
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.040]  dwarf them i mean it it's like the earth saying it's bigger than jupiter when
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:06.400]  jupiter's hundreds of times the size of the earth or or pluto saying it's
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:10.720]  bigger than the sun and i think that's great though max because
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.960]  i i briefly want to get into the question i brought up of hugo shavez
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.880]  running off of this gold university of texas buying billions in gold all these
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.760]  other institutions going in and grabbing it and finishing up there but
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:26.320]  what do you make of just the hysterical demonization
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:31.600]  and attacks on ron paul while at the same time saying he doesn't exist
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:37.920]  well he represents the antidote to having banks run and destroy your country
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:42.160]  because clearly he has a grounding in a school of economics
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.320]  that is the complete opposite of the school of economics that has destroyed
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.360]  the u.s economy and lou rockwell can talk all about that
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:54.640]  where the austrian school of economics is favors a return to hard money
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:58.560]  and real accountability and so clearly if you're in the banking business
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.520]  or in the mainstream media business whether your business is the mainstream
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.920]  media which is counterfeiting lies all day
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.520]  or a big bank that counterfeits federal reserve notes all day
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:10.480]  you're not going to want ron paul in office because he's going to shut you
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.880]  down so they're going to use their power of their
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:17.280]  counterfeiting of lies to flood the propaganda out so they're going to use
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.880]  the power of propaganda of counterfeiting federal
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:25.120]  reserve notes to debase the currency to fund the propaganda
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:30.240]  and the wars and everything else so he is the anecdote you know he's the guy you
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:33.200]  got to go to now to clean up this mess and
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:36.800]  that doesn't surprise me that the mainstream media is scared to death of
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:39.520]  them don't they run the danger though and there's a
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:44.080]  lot of evidence showing that the hoax is failing a daily show i put it
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.920]  more succinctly i think than we even have illustrating that they're following a
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.720]  talking point all the mainline media liberal
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:56.080]  conservative you name it uh they even the so-called abc news type
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.000]  straight faced stuff they try to act like they're impartial
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.960]  they act like he is von helzing and they are count Dracula i mean they are
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.240]  kissing at him and this is just another reminder
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:12.960]  of just how duplicitous and treacherous and traitorous these people are but
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:17.920]  then another angle they got rick perry coming out and going up in gallup
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:24.800]  ten points in one week after saying i'm like Ron Paul i say
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.840]  the fellow reserve might be treasonous or treacherous
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:31.600]  and so just the fact that he did that he turbo surged
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.280]  into the lead in most the polls ahead of Ron Paul
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:39.360]  by acting like Ron Paul i mean this really shows that
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:43.440]  liberty is rising and people are starting to really get it max
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:47.200]  well that's the risk you take if you are so paranoid
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:54.000]  about having a legitimate economist in in the president of the united states
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.360]  office that you are going to risk putting up a
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:02.000]  straw man a front man like rick perry who's clearly a psychopath
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.720]  you are endangering the country in ways that you have to go to
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:10.800]  and study that film the manchurian candidate remember that film and that
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:13.600]  novel which was it was bad the manchurian
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.680]  candidate was bad in america for years the star frank sanatra
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:21.840]  and angela landsberry and they talk about this candidate that was made
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.240]  president of the united states by through brainwashing
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:27.760]  and this is what a rick perry is he's the manchurian candidate
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:32.400]  from the banking you know bankistan who's there to represent the interest of
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.160]  the counterfeiters and that's a real risk when you have somebody
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:42.480]  who's as mentally depraved and brainwashed as that in the
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:45.440]  white house they mentioned venezuela and hugo
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:49.120]  chavez he wants his 200 tons of gold back i look
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.480]  historically back to a very similar incident in the mid-60s when
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:56.000]  charles de gallo france demanded france's gold
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  because for the same reason that the u.s was debasing the global currency and
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.040]  using it the world reserve currency and abusing it
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.040]  and shortly after de gallo took his gold back from the new york federal reserve
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.400]  bank and put it back into france gold went from 35
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:14.720]  dollars an ounce to 800 dollars an ounce so if this is the beginning of a
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:18.400]  similar type move you're talking about gold making a move from 1800
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.520]  dollars an ounce to over 40 000 dollars an ounce
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:26.160]  which some are talking about as a possibility if the system gets so
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:30.000]  cracked and so abused that a monetization of gold
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.320]  by the u.s or in the eurozone is necessary to sort this all out
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.080]  they would have to do so against the basket of hundred trillion dollars
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:42.720]  worth of fiat money and square the circle you come up with a 35 40 000
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.440]  dollar an ounce price for gold which is the possibility and by the way
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:50.320]  they would probably i want your view on this in conclusion max we appreciate
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:56.240]  your time today max of of course the max keiser report on rt max
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.400]  they can ban gold for private ownership again like they did people say well then
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.200]  why have it well just don't turn it in these are a bunch of crooks
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:06.080]  i mean if the government told you to go throw your kid off a cliff
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.320]  like the aztecs would do or to report to a nazi gas chamber
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:13.680]  i mean it's time to say no but even if they try to
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:17.440]  restrict it here domestically the whole world's getting into gold now
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:21.680]  it's not going to work it's like the record companies
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:25.520]  trying to stop p2p file swapping when napster came around
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.880]  they didn't work eventually they had to totally change
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:32.320]  they changed their business model to adapt to the new reality
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:36.000]  the fact that the globe gold is now owned around the world it's owned
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.880]  electronically it's it's owned in ways that were
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:42.080]  never imagined up until a few years ago means that there's
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:45.600]  going to be virtually impossible to have a confiscation scheme as i did back in
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:48.880]  the 1930s so it's they're going to have to adapt to the new
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:53.040]  reality not the other way around max keiser thank you for
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.320]  spending so much time with us we'll talk to you again soon
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:59.440]  look forward to hearing the little rockwell interview that guy rocks
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:04.000]  oh he's awesome that's coming up and and again that's going to be from last
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.600]  night's tv show that we did a special report

[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:16.400]  audience in the entire interview and more is up at prisonplanet.tv
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.600]  by the way i'm really proud of the reports we did last night we had field
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.040]  reporters out talking to texans about the power
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:26.800]  prices going up because of carbon taxes and reporting
[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.240]  on the scene at the capital and at a power plant the globalists shut down here
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:34.000]  in austin part of their squeezing the slaves program
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.240]  we had another report filed on libya news package with a lu rockwell interview
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.360]  and i cover a whole spectrum of news and have commentary
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.320]  on steve jobs and this is just the start we're gonna get better and better and
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:50.720]  better at presenting this information and it's very exciting because we're
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.880]  reaching hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:57.600]  people every year conservatively just on the internet alone right now
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:01.840]  just on youtube imagine all the other sites i mean it is
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:05.200]  it is huge what we've been able to do together
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:09.600]  and all the glory goes to god i wouldn't even be alive here
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:13.200]  if it wasn't for that okay there goes max keiser

[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.080]  then they would vote then and then they'd have some town officers that would

[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:29.920]  and it turns out he'd been given information through his congressional
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:33.760]  sources and others that they were looking at a us nato
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:39.920]  backed invasion this is from kadoffy's camp either in september or october
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:44.080]  that was the exact info i got from fort hood fort benning georgia
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:49.120]  and other sources in fact i've asked watson to uh do a flashback to that to
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:52.240]  point that out to listeners another thing that we
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:58.240]  accurately broke down and now they're admitting that six months ago

[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:21.360]  on all things ron paul and how america can get behind this true
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:25.920]  constitutionalist is the editor-in-chief of lou rockwell dot com
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.440]  none other than lou rockwell who also of course served
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:34.240]  as ron paul's chief of staff so it doesn't get any better than ron paul but
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:37.280]  if there has to be a second brightest spot in the universe
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:40.480]  it's lou rockwell lou thank you for joining us tonight
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:45.520]  alex great to be with you so much is happening uh out of the gates
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:49.360]  uh can ron paul win yeah ron paul can win
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:52.480]  and in fact the fear that the media is exhibiting
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:56.880]  by first trying to um put the blackout on him
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:59.680]  then of course demonizing him when they're not blacking him out
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:03.040]  shows that they are very afraid he's talking about issues that are
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:06.240]  resonating with the american people as never before
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:10.160]  issues that threaten the establishment everything from the pentagon to the cia
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:13.920]  to the federal reserve to the bankocracy and all the rest of the
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:17.040]  power elite in washington uh they're being threatened
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:20.000]  they're worried and they wouldn't be paying you know they wouldn't be saying
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.920]  anything about ron paul rush limbaugh hannity bill riley all the rest of
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:27.920]  these people would not be denouncing him if he didn't threaten
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:31.840]  the apparatus that they're part of so he can win
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.600]  and as you say he's moving up in the polls he's moving up slowly but he's
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:39.520]  moving up organically he's getting more and more people young people especially
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:42.560]  but people of all ages in all different states
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:45.280]  not only in this country might have but around the world
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:48.320]  people are are uh ron paulians in every country
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:53.360]  so this is an international movement uh it bodes so well for the american future
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:56.800]  as we face of course terrible economic and other kinds of troubles
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:00.880]  but this is this is the bright spot in america today is the ron paul movement
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.040]  and of course i was being somewhat sarcastic and devil's advocate when i
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:08.800]  said can he win i mean in every poll he's in the top
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.240]  three candidates new gallup poll out today
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:16.160]  shows him in third place some have shown him in second place others
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:21.120]  in first place and it's this mantra of telling the public he can't win i i'm
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:26.080]  sure you saw that pure research piece that pew put out last week
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:30.320]  showing that indeed ron paul has gotten less coverage than any
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:33.360]  other candidate and most of the coverage
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:36.240]  has been negative well that right there is an endorsement
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:39.600]  if limbaugh is saying he'll destroy the republican party i saw what you wrote
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:43.440]  well uh you know good of it destroys the official you know republican party
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:46.720]  yeah that's good news yeah yeah so that's the proof right there
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:50.240]  that the whole establishment is coming after him
[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:53.280]  i mean that's the proof right there that he's the man for the job not just his
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.440]  long record of being a constitutionalist well as we know george hw bush
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:01.440]  refers to rush limbaugh as our boy and indeed he is you know that's
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:06.560]  he is part of that the bush uh establishment country club republican
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:10.880]  apparatus uh but the more that people get to know ron
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:14.320]  i believe by the way the media stuff is backfiring on them
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:18.160]  because people who are paying attention realize just how unfair this is
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:21.760]  and they want to know well why is he being targeted so once they look at ron
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:24.960]  once they see his youtube course with they saw him in person
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:28.880]  when they read his articles read his books this is this is
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:31.600]  the most learned guy running for president
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:34.800]  in a very very long time maybe we have to go back to jefferson
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.480]  i mean he's so well ready understands economics he understands history
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.680]  he understands everything about what's going on in this country he's so much
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:45.760]  smarter the rick perry the bachman romney the rest
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:48.960]  of these guys he just is intellectually head and shoulders above them
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:52.240]  of course in character too and as people get to know him
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:56.480]  they flock to him so it's it's quite an extraordinary moment in american
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:00.800]  history and uh i think it's why we have to be fundamentally optimistic
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:04.640]  because so many young people uh have just had it with the system
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:08.560]  they know there's a problem uh i just saw a wonderful youtube put together by
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:12.720]  some kids the last night where it's uh people all over the country
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:15.920]  saying you know we know there's a problem we don't believe what the
[01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:18.720]  government is saying we don't believe what the media is saying
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:22.080]  only ron paul is telling us the truth and so
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:25.840]  you know we need to change we need some hope not not like obama
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:29.600]  not we don't need any more bankocracy the two-party bankocracy of the
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:32.480]  democrats of the republicans we need something different
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:37.760]  so ron paul is again he's he's uh he's scaring the pants off the
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:42.640]  establishment and that's a very good news well i agree with you and just about
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:46.080]  a week ago the daily show came out and
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:53.120]  really pointed out that there was a uh open a campaign to ignore ron paul or
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:56.560]  if they were forced to cover him say well he can't win
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:01.120]  and since the dam is broken uh on the attempt to cover up ron paul and since
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:04.560]  it backfired i now see them shifting gears
[01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:09.120]  and uh i fear that we're going to see aquabuda attempts
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:13.120]  we're going to hear that ron paul uh assassinated lincoln
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:16.480]  we're going to hear that he blew up the uh lucetania that he started
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:21.120]  well well that he crucified christ uh but but i saw that again backfire when
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:26.480]  they tried it on rand what's your political instinct lou uh on the next
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:30.480]  way they're going to try to go after ron paul and will it will it be effective
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:34.080]  uh i don't think it'll be effective of course it's the old the old gondy line
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.920]  about you know first they ignore you then they attack you then you win
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.000]  so it's it's a uh this is just going along with what they usually do but as
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:46.720]  we know from polls as we know from everybody that we talk to ourselves
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:49.280]  and you're especially in touch with so many people
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:53.440]  nobody trusts the mainstream media nobody believes them
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:57.840]  um the new media like the alex joneshow people have trust in but nobody
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:01.680]  trusts nbc cbs a bc fox and the rest of these at least
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:05.440]  not most americans don't so when they see these people going after
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:08.640]  somebody it makes them ask what's right about him
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:13.440]  so again all you have to do is direct people to ron to his youtube's writings
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:20.000]  is uh his website and uh websites about him and uh people love him
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.760]  and they and they have hope and they no longer feel
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.520]  uh they not that ron is giving us any soft soap
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:31.840]  we know we've got serious economic troubles very serious economic troubles
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:35.200]  and other sorts of troubles ahead but as ron explains to us
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:38.720]  we can have a way out of it there is a way out of it
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:41.440]  we don't have to have this forever there is a path
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:45.040]  to uh economic growth to prosperity
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:48.800]  to human flourishing against all the people of course they're against human
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:52.480]  flourishing the war mongers the money counterfeiters
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:55.440]  the bankers and all the all the rest of the power elite
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:59.120]  so uh they're going to they're going to course going to smear him
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:02.160]  they're going to libel him they're going to toss mud at him
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:06.080]  but you know they talked about reagan being the teflon uh candidate
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:09.600]  actually ron paul's the teflon candidate not because
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:13.760]  um the stuff just doesn't stick to him and it's because when people look at him
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:16.640]  i i remember in a previous congressional election where his
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:20.240]  opponent said he's against the drug war he wants heroin
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:24.160]  dispensaries at the public schools at the elementary school so the kids can
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:28.480]  take heroin well of course now nobody nobody believes that stuff
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:32.560]  they look at ron paul they listen to him they get a sense of the kind of man he
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:35.360]  is now you don't get that from any kind of politician
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.040]  uh regular politician maybe it is to think he's a slippery guy
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:42.160]  people listen to ron paul and i think well you know this is a wise
[01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:45.920]  man this is a man who knows this is a man who's brilliant
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:51.280]  and who's actually got hope for the future um so i think i don't i think the
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:55.200]  campaign is not going to work again it's going to backfire just like the blackout
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:59.600]  backfire more and more americans uh you know the
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:03.360]  more they examine bachman or perry or romney
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:06.720]  or chris christy or palin or any of those other people they're talking
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:10.160]  along jeb bush i mean the other people they're talking about maybe getting in
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:13.520]  the race they're all pygmies they're moral pygmies
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:17.200]  they're intellectual pygmies against a very great man ron
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:20.720]  paul so they're undoubtedly political hacks
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:24.320]  i mean they're just complete political fake creatures who constantly flip-flop
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:26.720]  and i don't want to dwell too long on this but
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:30.240]  rick perry who pledged not to run of course broke the pledge was all about
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:33.680]  peaking interest in the uh reluctant hero
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:37.360]  he's a guy for forced inoculations nafta super highways
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:41.120]  al gore's former chief of staff uh in texas
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:44.400]  and this now the media is saying is the front runner
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.360]  and i just say shame on america if you go for another
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:51.440]  obama type another rick perry another packaged plastic
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:54.640]  kindle if they don't choose ron paul but briefly
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:58.480]  uh your take on rick perry and and then the fact that
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:02.640]  ron paul is really the man of the hour he predicted with precision along with
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:06.320]  you and others exactly what would happen with the inflation tax
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:11.760]  and so much more and uh your view on the upcoming death of the dollar
[01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:14.320]  well i think first of all is to rick perry there are many things to say about
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:17.440]  him to me the key thing that stands out in my mind
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:20.480]  is the fact that in texas he's known as gardisle rick
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:24.400]  that's because he took money from the murk drug company as did the republican
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:27.920]  party of texas and all the republican politicians down there
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:33.760]  to force on very dangerous and untested hpv vaccine on every sixth grade girl in
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.200]  public school in texas the fact that this man of you know
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:41.040]  talks about the obama mandate the fact that this guy would have used government
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:46.160]  force and of course a huge ripoff for murk i mean hundreds of dollars per shot
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:49.600]  of these girls have to have multiple shots causing
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:53.840]  so many illnesses happened in england too the fact that this guy would have used
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:56.880]  the power of the governorship in return for bribes
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:59.600]  maybe they're legal bribes or they're still bribes
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:03.120]  uh to uh force this dangerous vaccine on little girls
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:07.360]  what a criminal what a monster i mean rick rick perry
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:10.480]  i mean all these politicians of course are criminals and monsters
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:14.640]  uh the regular politicians but perry really stands out as it seems to me a
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:18.160]  first-class creep a totalitarian as you say the
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:22.320]  trans texas highwayman all the various things he's done this guy is just uh
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:25.760]  so i i i don't i'm not worried at all about perry
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.640]  because as the word gets out about who he really is
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:31.760]  uh he's going to go nowhere i don't think americans are ready for another
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:36.320]  george w bush and uh he's just he's another clown like bush
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:40.880]  but he's trying to become ron paul saying that the federal reserve is almost
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:44.560]  treasonous we'll know it's a private offshore corporation it's looking out
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:47.680]  for itself how is how is that treasonous isn't really
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:51.840]  treasonous that congress and others have let them do this to our country and
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:55.200]  he's trying to become ron paul and i think it shows how powerful the
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:58.800]  message of liberty is that you and others and ron paul have been real
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:02.320]  standard-bearers for that now rick perry is openly
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:06.960]  trying to shapeshift into ron paul and if we simply get out the truth about his
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:11.360]  record and say no ron paul is the real ron paul
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:15.040]  he's the real mccoy not rick perry i mean that is
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:18.640]  job number one i think is to expose the rick perry hoax
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:22.000]  well i think that's right but you know what you said is a tribute to ron
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.840]  that he feels correctly so that by denouncing the federal reserve and
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:30.720]  denouncing ben bernanke it's good politics so this is because ron you know
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:33.680]  when i i've been interested in the fed for a very long time
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:37.280]  and i can tell you people's eyes would glaze over when you tried to discuss it
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:41.280]  ron paul made the fed interesting he made americans aware that we're being
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:44.480]  ripped off by the federal reserve and its associated banks
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:50.000]  and so that the establishment said well rick perry really damaged himself when
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.520]  he said that about bernanke and the fed actually didn't of course he helped
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:56.000]  himself but he is a fake
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.600]  he's a phony he's trying to steal ron paul's thunder but i think it's it's not
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:03.440]  going to work ron paul is the real deal and as i can
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:08.400]  testify myself for having worked for him and having known him for so many years
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:12.160]  what you see on the television screen is actually the real guy
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:16.880]  i mean he actually unlike other people i've known in politics who are not
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:20.640]  the same as on the tv screen ron paul's the real deal
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:24.320]  and he actually studied the federal reserve he's read vastly and he knows
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:26.080]  everything about the history of the fed
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:29.120]  everything they're doing to them to the uh... to the dollar
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:32.160]  and uh... they are bringing about of course as you pointed out
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:35.680]  the death of the dollar uh... we face
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:38.960]  uh... it's a horror we we don't know the timing
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:42.480]  uh... and the dollar is going to be strengthened probably by all the
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:46.160]  continuing troubles that they're the banks are giving the uh... european
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:50.400]  countries and destroying the uh... the euro
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:53.280]  but we're going to see much higher inflation here
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:56.800]  uh... it's going to be horrific probably going to be worse than nineteen
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:00.800]  seventies but again we don't have to have that permanently
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:05.360]  we don't have to have a a uh... counterfeiting board in washington dc
[01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:09.120]  ripping off regular people for the benefit of wall street in the big banks
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:13.040]  and the government itself so we don't have to have all these wars
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:16.720]  what are they fighting six or seven wars and cross-secret wars and
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:21.760]  uh... just while waiting uh... in need deep in blood all over the world
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:25.440]  uh... other countries resented americans ought to resend it
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:29.280]  around paul's talking about that really the most important issue even more
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.480]  important than the money issue and it's hard to think of anything that is
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:36.960]  except the one issue of war and peace so uh... no more wars
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:41.360]  bring the troops home stop the counterfeiting cut government spending
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:44.640]  it can be done and i know that people of question well
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:47.920]  from paul were elected the congress would never go along with them
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:51.120]  but all it can say that run paul world is to be elected
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:54.800]  and the kind of mandate he would have all those congressman who
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:58.240]  care about being elected more than anything else and being reelected
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:01.120]  would be asking doctor paul what do we do
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:04.240]  absolutely by the whole country would be in the mood for
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:05.480]  big changes
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:09.440]  a uh... i hate to use a roosevelt's phrase but an actual new deal a new deal
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:10.800]  for the american people
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:12.160]  a new deal of freedom
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:15.880]  a new deal of prosperity around paul new deal
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:19.840]  absolutely and uh... i'm just fifteen twenty years ago he couldn't get one
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:22.720]  co-sponsor dot the fed it passed the house
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:24.120]  as you know last year
[01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:27.440]  with ron paul's president they would have a lot of trouble
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:32.280]  uh... no army can stop an idea whose time has come as the french philosopher
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:34.080]  picture hugo said
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:37.880]  and after decades of laboring out there in the wilderness lou
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:40.800]  uh... you and others that's uh... deserve so much credit
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:43.920]  uh... our time is coming the liberty
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:45.440]  is approaching
[01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:49.080]  and even if ron paul doesn't win this round he certainly wins
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:51.040]  by injecting real issues
[01:49:51.040 --> 01:49:54.120]  and uh... freedom is popular and we need to legalize
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:55.320]  legalize freedom
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:57.800]  uh... as ron paul and as you have said

[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:05.000]  yeah they launched a new commission that's going to give regular enlisted a
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.520]  little bit of money to sell them on it and then basically take this is even
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:13.320]  the associated press half of the pension money of 20 year people and more i'm
[01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:18.280]  sorry uh tell me what you learned okay so i actually have
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:22.920]  the slideshow it was forwarded around i had the emails
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:27.240]  and i can forge the emails and i just kind of wanted to give you a heads up
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:30.440]  i can send that stuff to you i don't really know how it works but
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:35.000]  but i have the email the chain of emails and the actual slideshow from this
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:38.120]  presentation i don't know if it's official it looks
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:41.800]  official to me and it went through the actual chain of command in one of the
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:45.400]  units so i it's the defense business board it's
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:50.040]  modernizing the military retirement system and it shows all these different
[01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:52.760]  think tanks and the rand corporations on there and
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:55.800]  my friends are really starting to wake up now because i would talk about the rand
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:58.920]  corporation and they see that now in that slideshow so
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:01.960]  they're like hey you know he knows what he's talking about the rand corporation
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:04.840]  came up with all the major scams almost all of them
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:09.160]  like they said if we tell people to do a deductible
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:13.400]  uh that will train them to start paying
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:17.880]  for insurance even though they've paid for it that you've got to pay later
[01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:22.120]  and then we can phase in and then they wrote the handbook on this 50 years ago
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:25.400]  then we can phase in things we don't cover before it was just they covered
[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:28.840]  everything got insurance they covered it i mean every scam you can imagine
[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:32.440]  every word game and i actually saw a rand corporation mentioned

[02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:50.920]  information would you say i am a plethora
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:54.200]  i got to watch the three amigos again i was listening to charlie hodge
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:00:57.480]  locally earlier in the week he was playing clubs on it it's so funny
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:02.360]  let's go ahead and talk to mike in denver thanks for holding your on the
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:06.040]  ear hey alex thanks for having me um i know our
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:10.440]  time is growing short as a republic and i think i've got three solutions quick
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:13.320]  solutions i just like your comments on
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:16.440]  first one would be we physically take this place back like
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:19.800]  our forefathers did which is the least desirable way
[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:24.360]  the second one is to hold the federal reserve act up against article
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:27.720]  one section eight paragraph five of the constitution in the supreme court and
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:32.760]  see if we can get it overturned third solution is to support ron paul
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:36.440]  all the way to office and then support him every day by
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:40.360]  emailing and calling legislators and telling them to stay on board
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:45.400]  well those are all things that that are
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:48.920]  are avenues that could be gone down i'm not i'm not saying i want
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:52.520]  offensive physical action i'm saying obviously the cartridge box is always
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:56.440]  an option but i think more important is just
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:02:02.120]  get the spirit of liberty out there create a culture of liberty rediscover
[02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:06.360]  that hey folks watching football and acting cool that's not what's valuable
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:10.280]  all you men going around the barbecues stand around going look at my muscles

[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:16.760]  you should be running for office you should be standing up and going to
[02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:20.520]  your neighborhood meetings you should be involved in the machinery of the world
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:25.320]  but i mean a man doesn't just go i got stuff to do i'm not involved in that

[02:07:24.120 --> 02:07:27.080]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:31.000]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:34.120]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:38.040]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:41.880]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in
[02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:45.160]  the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my old
[02:07:45.160 --> 02:07:47.480]  sponsors you can get more information at

[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:49.480]  virginia and then right up into new jersey new york and all the way up into
[02:08:49.480 --> 02:08:53.800]  main before continuing up into canada
[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:58.440]  and i guess winding up way up there by is that newfoundland up there
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:03.640]  is my geography right you can follow it all at infowars.com and
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:07.240]  prismpana.com and drudge of course has it front and center he's got the
[02:09:07.240 --> 02:09:11.480]  satellite the cone the stats will follow it over the weekend
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:14.040]  you know i'd love to think that the government would help people if
[02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:18.280]  everything collapses but what they'll do is lock everything down and
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:21.880]  show up at people's houses that are fine and say you got a gun safe we're going
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:24.280]  to blow it open unless you open and give us your guns
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:28.280]  but why this is america get on the ground get on the ground
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:32.200]  then they do that all over the country now any excuse to confiscate guns they
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:35.720]  want to see the military will do it that's their big goal their big
[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:40.520]  their big apple in the sky that they're constantly reaching for
[02:09:40.520 --> 02:09:43.640]  now we're going to bob Chapman here in a moment we'll continue
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:47.000]  with your phone calls but here's some of the other crazy news
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:51.080]  china expanding its nuclear stockpile and
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:55.560]  of course they're they've got hundreds and hundreds of icbms now they're
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:59.240]  adding another 75 long-range nuclear missiles because you
[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:02.440]  like to buy toasters from their slave camps
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:06.280]  i guess so do i i mean i try to stay away from it but
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:10.760]  also death toll rises to 53 an attack on
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:15.320]  mexican casino the drug gang terrorist i guess who hadn't been paid their
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:18.520]  protection money poured gasoline on all the
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:22.280]  major entrances shut the hotel casino on fire and
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:25.320]  killed at least 53 gamblers and employees
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:31.800]  mexico is a nightmare state and it's because the public's disarmed
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:34.520]  the government is a narco terrorist state openly
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:38.760]  controlling the drugs and it got their society got so criminal
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:42.200]  that all these other drug gangs rose up and said we got guns too
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:45.480]  so they have whole sectors they've controlled every day i read about whole
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:48.920]  police departments resigning mayors being killed
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:52.920]  and and this is where this law of the gun ends up going when only the
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:56.440]  government has the gun then the government engages in a kleptocoric
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:00.520]  type of activity things just degenerate into a
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:04.440]  road warrior situation and you notice that's happening with the
[02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:08.120]  globalist here the police that are left that they're
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:11.160]  in a layoff are just going to be there to raise money off of you
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:15.400]  so that's a crazy article japan's prime minister to design successor
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:19.480]  race hard to call and many of the top scientists have resigned and said indeed
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:22.680]  there were total meltdowns at the reactor that are still ongoing
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:26.600]  and massive radiation poisoning and the government ordered it all covered up
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:30.280]  as we said from the beginning proven around again we recall conspiracy
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:33.480]  theorist and when the radiation levels went up in the us
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:37.000]  the epa just raised the level of what they said was safe
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.520]  oh you caught us putting radioactive isotopes in your fluoride mix
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:44.200]  we'll just raise the level on that too local news listened to us went out and
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:46.120]  stuck tiger counters up against the pipes and
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:51.080]  whoa that's high radiation where's it coming from it must be in the aquifers
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:54.680]  now move along children nothing to see here no it's in the fluoride they're
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:58.120]  adding i think that's a big piece of news
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:02.120]  they spike 70 plus percent of the country's water with uranium but
[02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:08.520]  again i'm an extremist a russian spacecraft of course falls from the
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:12.680]  sky is the international space station
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:15.240]  in trouble
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:20.680]  very interesting report there moscow an unnamed russian space
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:24.040]  freighter which was launched on a supply mission to the international space
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:26.440]  station greened out of control and blew up in a
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:30.520]  thunderous fireball over Siberia Wednesday
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:33.880]  Greece has been forced to tap emergency fund you notice the deeper they get into
[02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:37.240]  the banker bailout of the worst things get
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:41.480]  Greece has been forced to activate an obscure emergency fund for its banks
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:44.440]  because they are running short and collateral that is acceptable
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:48.120]  to the european central bank and joining us to talk about this and member
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:52.680]  nakies latest announcement as well on qe3
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:55.400]  supposedly isn't going to happen but dr robert said they're
[02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:58.920]  still doing it via the monetization of the t-bells
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:02.200]  is is bob chat and we'll also talk about libya
[02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:07.000]  and a lot more but bob you know you've been fighting the globalists for 50 years
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:12.040]  and uh their documents were public then and then the dod commission came out
[02:13:12.040 --> 02:13:15.560]  norman dod and others where they plan to set up a world government get everybody
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:19.080]  in debt implode the nation states and have a new bank of the world
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:23.000]  and now we see it being announced in europe's told there's a new financial
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:27.320]  dictatorship run by private banks and they will dictate everything
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:31.480]  not your parliaments not your governments and we have a super congress now
[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:35.640]  that originates the spending and tax bills not the regular congress for the
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:39.480]  first time in 200 plus years we are seeing
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:43.960]  just incredible things bob and it's almost like we make it passé in a way
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:48.760]  we actually help the establishment if we just sit here and talk about this and
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:52.120]  then don't remind people of how incredible it is
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:55.480]  i mean i'm almost conditioned it's like if this stuff was happening 10 years
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:59.000]  ago people be freaking out but they incrementally got us so trained to
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.960]  accept it that now we're seeing articles every day
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:06.360]  get rid of the constitution and yeah the government brings in narcotics what's
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:09.000]  you're gonna do about it i mean there's just this
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:13.480]  just this arrogance and uh the former head of the fed
[02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:17.400]  green span saying we're above the law on lair news hour no one can investigate us
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:20.760]  no one can look at us and we'll just print money and
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:24.200]  i mean it's what's that italian mafia thing where you flick your
[02:14:24.200 --> 02:14:29.240]  flick your hand under your uh uh chin you know basically saying go to hades bob
[02:14:29.240 --> 02:14:35.000]  what are we facing here i'm going to hades just as you
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:41.160]  pointed out um they have had had to expedite their
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:48.760]  program uh that's why what you're seeing is becoming
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:51.800]  something that the major media is starting to handle
[02:14:51.800 --> 02:14:56.200]  and yes they they want to break everybody there's no question about that
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:15:00.280]  financially and they want to reduce population
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:04.360]  depending upon who within the cfr and the trilateral commission
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:09.480]  you want to listen to anywhere between 60 and 90 percent
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:14.040]  so that means there's not going to be many of us left
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:21.160]  as far as the uh situation in europe is concerned what the european central
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:29.560]  bank just did violates their rules in purchasing the bonds of
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:37.640]  spain and italy among others and it also violates the german constitution
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:44.280]  and i think we're coming up to the first week in september
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:47.720]  and all of these people who have taken their vacations
[02:15:47.720 --> 02:15:52.680]  well you might say europe burned which is incredible
[02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:55.480]  uh like it was going to go away it's probably
[02:15:55.480 --> 02:16:01.400]  the worst financial crisis in peacetime uh that europe has seen in
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:04.680]  a hundred or more years and they're on vacation
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:09.160]  but anyway uh they're going to come back and face reality very shortly
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:13.560]  and uh i don't think anything's going to get done because
[02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:20.440]  the germans have said look to the ecv what you're doing is illegal and wrong
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:24.200]  they spent about a hundred billion dollars buying these bonds
[02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:28.680]  and they expect that these individual countries
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:33.320]  within the european union particularly the eurozone
[02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:37.480]  the european union's 27 countries eurozone 17
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:42.520]  of those 27 and they expect them to come to the rescue
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:45.640]  and come up with the money to buy this
[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:49.400]  or pay for these bonds that have been purchased
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:54.120]  and the ecv has no authority to do what they've done
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:56.840]  so the germans are saying look we're not going to do that
[02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:00.040]  and i don't know who's going to pay for them but it's not going to be us
[02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:04.520]  and so they're going to stand still there is no solution
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:10.280]  now because the germans have said no the finish haven't said no but they want
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:15.240]  collateralization on the loans and they want the greeks to put up their gold
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:21.080]  so bob here's the issue everybody has seen example after example
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:25.480]  in third world countries and in the west bailing out the banks which means
[02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:28.920]  staying in their Ponzi scheme because they hold you hostage
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:33.080]  never fixes anything it only makes it worse but
[02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:36.840]  if you're a bankster you actually do win so
[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:41.000]  this is all by design as we've broken it down for years
[02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:44.280]  now it's all happening just like we said it would
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:48.360]  and it's accelerating and we saw gold shoot up to 1900 and something they
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:50.600]  pushed it down and it's shot back up to day
[02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:54.280]  what's going on in the gold and silver markets right now
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:59.000]  well first of all you can look back uh at
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:04.600]  uh may and you saw the attack on silver took it from 50 dollars out of 32
[02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:09.080]  dollars and 50 cents and then it rallied back up to
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:12.520]  $44 and then they attacked it again and what they
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:18.200]  forgot was it works both ways on the way down with the high margins in a
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:24.200]  very thin market they raised them from $4,500 to $21,600
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:28.360]  and then the commodity houses that did gold and silver
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:32.360]  they raised them to 42,000 they since rescinded that
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:36.440]  as far as I know and but what they didn't figure
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:39.480]  was that when they brought it down they wiped out
[02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:43.240]  all the small and medium-sized investors so that when
[02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:47.080]  silver started to go back up again there was no resistance there was nobody
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:50.440]  to sell and so it was getting stronger and stronger and that's why they
[02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:53.400]  attacked it again but it's not lasting as we can see
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:58.120]  today uh I do a lot of programs as you well know
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:02.680]  and on Wednesday and on Thursday and again today
[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:07.000]  I'm telling people that we've hit the bottom and both gold and silver
[02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:12.840]  they're going to head right back up again what was done in gold they increased
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:17.640]  the margin requirements for $4,500 to
[02:19:17.640 --> 02:19:21.320]  eight or nine thousand dollars I don't know the exact figure at the moment
[02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:26.600]  it's in tomorrow's issue incidentally and what they are finding
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:32.440]  is they set this group of insiders the big firms in
[02:19:32.440 --> 02:19:38.120]  wall street the banks brokerage firms
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:42.760]  hedge funds what they did was gave them the information or was given the
[02:19:42.760 --> 02:19:46.040]  information prior and they all acted together and they
[02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:50.200]  not go down $200 and I came out on Wednesday and said
[02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:53.320]  tomorrow's the bottom between seven and seven twenty five
[02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:58.280]  going in by with both hands I was a buyer stay there let's talk about it on the
[02:19:58.280 --> 02:20:02.280]  other side because it's shooting back up right now
[02:20:02.280 --> 02:20:05.960]  hey bill pick up line three it's brian hey brian what's up
[02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:10.120]  thanks hey bill I just received my shipment of the safety net our full

[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:50.200]  everything and consolidate it that's what a
[02:24:50.200 --> 02:24:56.120]  cancer does now here's some breaking news from Reuters
[02:24:56.120 --> 02:25:00.040]  russian central bank who offer gold back loans
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:04.040]  russia central bank will offer gold back loans for up to 90 days
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:08.360]  at an interest rate of seven percent wow so we're starting to see
[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:11.880]  that gold is becoming the real currency that is a pretty high
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:17.720]  um interest rate for 90 days it said in a statement on friday expanding its
[02:25:17.720 --> 02:25:21.480]  lending facilities for dealing with any future liquidity crunch
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:25.240]  in the banking system uh bob i want you to finish up with what they did in the
[02:25:25.240 --> 02:25:29.160]  market driving it down artificially and now it's up i don't know 40 something
[02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:31.960]  bucks today so this is the standard deal where they
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:36.280]  create the perception that gold drops and people are like man you're an idiot
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:40.520]  gold went down 200 bucks and i'm like yeah but it's up 500 in the last few months
[02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:43.960]  look at the overall graph and they're like still you're dumb you bought it
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:47.320]  300 it's 18 plus i'm like well no i'm not they're like
[02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:50.920]  yeah your failure watch me jump off a cliff now
[02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:54.840]  government loves me they really killed bin laden the easter bunny's real
[02:25:54.840 --> 02:25:58.040]  uh finish up bob and i want to get into this russia situation and some other
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:03.000]  news and phone calls well and wednesday's issue we told
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:08.200]  people tomorrow morning uh we'll head 17 to 17 25
[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:12.760]  it'll be the turn uh the professionals are licking their chops
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:16.920]  you get in there with them and you buy all gold and silver how did you call the
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:20.440]  plunge because i know it's on record if we should
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:23.560]  we should take your horn a little bit better you did call it before it happened
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:30.200]  how did you do that well the market uh is the market and it gets overextended
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:35.320]  we saw a lot of short covering going on and i felt that it was normal to have
[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:40.920]  a correction usually 50 to 100 dollars uh
[02:26:40.920 --> 02:26:45.160]  when you have an event like that well it didn't do that the government got a
[02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:49.000]  whole event with their uh with their uh minions and they
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.360]  attacked drove it down 200 well they've got the
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:55.560]  same problem now they had with silver they wiped out
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:26:59.000]  although the small and medium-sized investors on the way down
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:03.640]  and there's no resistance and of course china and musher and
[02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:08.360]  and the venezuela and brazil and argentina and iran and
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:12.600]  and india and and everybody who's a buyer of gold is
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:16.520]  you know they were ringing their hands and saying you know how does that you
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:20.200]  know the united states government understand
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:24.360]  they're just giving us gulgobs and gulgobs of money
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:28.520]  and so as you said gold is up 47 dollars right now
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:32.520]  and silver's up 44 cents and it's going to continue it's going to go right back
[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:36.040]  up again because it's a phony baloney deal with
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:40.760]  the underlying fundamentals so there what are they gold's the only real money
[02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:44.760]  you know bob it seemed like the bankers a few years ago thought they could really
[02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:51.320]  still uh buy their own bonds monetize debt but not cause inflation on the
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:54.360]  street now they seem to be abandoning it and
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:57.560]  hiding it and playing view and going well yeah we're just going to print money
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:03.080]  oh a little inflation's not bad i mean are they in control i mean i know they
[02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:06.440]  they they set this in motion they think they're in control
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:11.160]  but are things going well for them well let me give you an example one of the
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:17.800]  things that you didn't point out in in uh news for today uh the russians have
[02:28:17.800 --> 02:28:21.480]  had to make a very large investment in society
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:25.000]  general which is one of the major banks in
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.160]  in paris in france and they had to do that because
[02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:35.080]  society in general is broke and so they answer your question if roshile has to
[02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:38.040]  go in and bail out a bank you know they're in
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:41.400]  serious trouble well same things are going on in the united states
[02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:44.120]  and all the banks in europe and the united states are carrying two sets of
[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:46.760]  books now let me ask you a question if a
[02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:49.800]  buffett puts in five billion the rothschilds put in however many
[02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:53.880]  billions they put in i did see that and then and then you're talking about
[02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:58.440]  hundreds of trillions conservatively that that's the real hangover
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:03.160]  how can five billion prop up you know a hundred trillion as max kaiser was
[02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:05.800]  saying in bank of america are they leveraging
[02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:10.200]  into derivatives again with fractional reserve to the power of a thousand
[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:13.800]  with that five billion i mean how does buffett quote save bank of america with
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:17.080]  five billion well first of all it's the drop in
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:20.440]  the bucket and the leverage that you're talking about yes it's there
[02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:24.600]  and they are using it it's a last gas free resort
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:30.360]  is the same as so gen is in paris and uh it's not going to work how long will it
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:35.480]  last i don't know three six nine months and it's over
[02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:39.160]  and you know buffett has made his money on
[02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:42.360]  inside information knowing what the government is going to do
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:46.280]  and the illuminati every time they need a favor
[02:29:46.280 --> 02:29:51.240]  because he and seros and people like them stay there stay there stay there

[02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:16.360]  or it's back to monday i mean life just speeds up i remember growing up when it took
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:20.200]  what fell like a hundred years to get to christmas
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:23.400]  and the christmas tree lights and the presents and but what i really like was
[02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:30.200]  the family dinners and the food and the cold weather and the family time
[02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:33.480]  and it would just take forever to get to christmas now christmas is like bam
[02:34:33.480 --> 02:34:38.200]  bam bam bam bam life is just speeding past us
[02:34:38.200 --> 02:34:42.840]  and think of all of our ancestors all of your ancestors going way back in time
[02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:46.760]  they had hopes they had dreams they sacrificed so that their children could
[02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:50.520]  have a better life many people died so we have the basic
[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:54.360]  liberties we have today and i see these grown men and women
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:35:00.760]  who think it's a trendy affectation to laugh at people
[02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:04.120]  that are worried about tyranny to laugh at people that are worried about
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:08.840]  corruption to giggle and smirk at someone that talks about their rights
[02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:13.240]  it's kooky it's weird oh these weirdos are talking about the federal reserve
[02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:16.280]  being private i remember being called a conspiracy
[02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:20.840]  there as 16 years ago and people calling the radio station and going
[02:35:20.840 --> 02:35:24.680]  is this guy racist i heard that's code for racism
[02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:27.800]  and you saw that last year you don't like government around health care you're
[02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:32.200]  a racist i mean just desperate tactics but the good news is it doesn't work
[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:35.320]  anymore a large portion of the population nearing a
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:39.000]  majority well congress has the lowest approval rating ever
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  what only nine percent of americans think that the congress serves them
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:48.600]  people are awake they're just not you ever woke up in a hotel room
[02:35:48.600 --> 02:35:51.480]  and you don't know where you are for a minute you're like this doesn't look
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:54.760]  like my bedroom in the dark you go oh yeah i'm in a hotel room
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:57.640]  you wake up and there's like an ambulance going by and you you're in
[02:35:57.640 --> 02:36:04.120]  new york sitting you're like uh you know oh yeah i'm in new york
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:08.440]  people need to just wake up out of the trance
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:13.640]  we're not in kansas anymore and everything that the global bankers have
[02:36:13.640 --> 02:36:15.800]  done in other countries everything they write about
[02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:19.240]  they're very arrogant you know bob Chapman i think that's one of their biggest
[02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:23.000]  weak spots in the social engineering system
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:27.560]  is that they do love to brag they do in their own publications that
[02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:30.760]  they don't think the general public reads they do
[02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:33.880]  admit a lot of what they were planning and that's how you and others
[02:36:33.880 --> 02:36:37.960]  were able to lay out their program long before it happened
[02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:43.160]  well that's why i have been a subscriber to foreign affairs the house organ of
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:47.320]  the council of foreign relations since 1960
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:50.440]  you know we were talking about europe a few minutes ago
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:53.720]  and one of the things that they're trying to keep
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:57.000]  from the people in the world the Germans are well aware of it but the
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:01.880]  federal constitutional court in uh Kyle's room
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:09.320]  is going to on september the 15th vote upon or say whether
[02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:12.440]  the german government spending of citizens money
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:16.440]  to bail out foreign relations foreign nations
[02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:20.600]  uh is legal and they're not talking about it
[02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:24.840]  and i think they're going to say no you can't do that
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:29.000]  and then where is the ECB going to be and they're not going to be able to lend
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:32.040]  anybody any money and that's going to bring the whole
[02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:36.280]  thing down and and down it should this was originally
[02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:40.760]  created uh there was the european gold uh colon
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:44.440]  steel community followed by the european common market
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:50.200]  and now we've got the european union and what they wanted to make out of this
[02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:53.800]  was this would be the model for one world government
[02:37:53.800 --> 02:37:57.720]  the euro would be the model for the one world currency
[02:37:57.720 --> 02:38:01.720]  and they screwed it up and they openly have written countless books saying
[02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:06.760]  that we covered my seminal film in game i mean they admit this is the model
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:10.600]  uh and and you're seeing bob they've screwed it up i mean i see that
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:15.400]  countries are balking germany chief amongst them and then and then france
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:17.960]  and others because the public doesn't want to quote
[02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:22.120]  bail out banks uh you know they you know that they sell it as a loan to
[02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:25.960]  portugal or italy or or ireland or greece when you
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:29.960]  read the fine print it's just money directly to the central banks
[02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:34.360]  but uh i mean isn't that their in game to implode
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:39.320]  these countries and so um perhaps all along they plan to implode the euro
[02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:42.920]  and move directly to just a bank of the world i mean they were just talking
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:46.840]  about that three years ago and and perhaps the world will bow
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:50.440]  because they'll tell trendies it's cool and a lot of trendies will probably put
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:53.880]  stickers on their cars to the new global government bank
[02:38:53.880 --> 02:38:56.840]  and actually teach their children that it's good to be a slave i mean i'm not
[02:38:56.840 --> 02:38:59.160]  getting if you tell the average trendy
[02:38:59.160 --> 02:39:02.360]  especially some you know business graduate that throwing their kids in a
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:06.120]  meat grinder school they'll do it and so people will probably just be like
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:10.760]  bowing down uh to the Rothschilds and in in in
[02:39:10.760 --> 02:39:13.880]  pulling their teeth out if they have gold in their teeth with pliers and saying
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:17.800]  here lord Rothschild take it Rothschild's like no but i will tax you for
[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:20.680]  breathing i mean i mean that that's how far this is
[02:39:20.680 --> 02:39:25.320]  gone bob you're right and uh the situation in
[02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:29.480]  europe uh has gone to the point where it's now
[02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:33.080]  irretrievable and can you believe that they took all of
[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:37.880]  august off and didn't even deal with it it shows you how the bureaucrats in
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:44.840]  europe through social socialism had just become dead ends and and so
[02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:49.160]  you know you asked you asked whether this was planned
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:53.800]  i don't think so i think they really made a mess out of this
[02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:57.080]  and they know what they'd like to do now but it's going to be too
[02:39:57.080 --> 02:40:01.400]  hard to pull off i mean when you see russia going into sojen
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:04.680]  and putting up the money then you see the buffets of the world
[02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:08.520]  popping in with five billion here and there just to extend things for another
[02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:11.320]  three or six months you know they're in serious
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:16.440]  trouble it's going down how long will it take i don't know
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:20.200]  what other tricks can they pull i don't know they're very good at it
[02:40:20.200 --> 02:40:24.520]  incidentally and they're not stupid but they've made some fierce mistakes
[02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:27.640]  and they got to pay for it but this is not going to go away
[02:40:27.640 --> 02:40:31.480]  things are going to continue to deteriorate and that's why
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:36.520]  we have to protect ourselves by having dehydrated and freeze dried foods and
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:41.080]  a filter and weapons to defend our family and gold and silver to put
[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:46.440]  our valuable wealth that we've already accumulated into
[02:40:46.440 --> 02:40:50.520]  well you're certainly right bob i want to take some phone calls
[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:55.240]  but first i wanted to raise a couple other issues with you
[02:40:55.240 --> 02:40:59.080]  uh i i was going to premiere it here on the show today but we just ran out of
[02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:03.800]  time so i want to ask all the radio listeners
[02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:09.640]  and and tv viewers uh to please go get this video that's now posted
[02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:13.560]  at info wars dot com and a lot of times i read a headline
[02:41:13.560 --> 02:41:16.600]  even though i wrote it and it's not strong enough
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:22.760]  911 heroes not welcome at ground zero and that's actually kind of a white
[02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:29.000]  wash it's it's 911 heroes uh barred or banned at ground zero
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:32.760]  fox again and they all admit it and they just say well uh
[02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:36.920]  we just don't want you here we're not going to say why well i know why i i know
[02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:41.160]  why uh they don't want them there but but this just shows
[02:41:41.160 --> 02:41:45.720]  how crazy it is and how they set up the whole police state
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:49.320]  in the name of protecting us because of what happened on 911 and then the
[02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:52.760]  government wraps themselves in the heroics of the
[02:41:52.760 --> 02:41:56.600]  police officers and firefighters and medical people and doctors and
[02:41:56.600 --> 02:42:01.240]  folks and then they're they're barred from being there but
[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:04.120]  tens of thousands of others aren't they're still going to have you know the
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:06.840]  police chief and fire chief up there and they say they'll have a token event for
[02:42:06.840 --> 02:42:13.160]  them but but but why would they be barred from the uh big
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:16.760]  police state extravaganza because either way you cut it
[02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:22.040]  bob they are heroes sure it's an inside job but they didn't know that
[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:25.720]  always the establishment tries to say oh you're saying the firemen were involved
[02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:31.320]  blowing it up no no again that's a game they play
[02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:34.840]  but but now here are the pro official story people
[02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:40.040]  barring first responders why do you think that is bob
[02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:43.800]  i think they wanted to go away they don't want
[02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:48.760]  these good people to be seen as good people they just want to
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:53.800]  make it a non-event from here on out because too many people professionals
[02:42:53.800 --> 02:42:57.320]  have discovered that the whole thing was a scam
[02:42:57.320 --> 02:43:01.800]  and they don't want to talk about they wanted all to die and go away
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:09.240]  and you know 9-11's coming up and um they want to be as quiet about it as
[02:43:09.240 --> 02:43:14.040]  possible and so there can't be any heroes
[02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:17.720]  well that's right the only heroes can be obama and george w
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:22.280]  bush up there but the info i have bob and i covered this in the video
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:26.280]  is i i would go there six years ago and about half the firemen and police were
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:30.040]  were mad at us the others were shaking our
[02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:35.720]  hands and telling us you know they appreciated us when i was there a
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:38.920]  couple years ago and i really got to go this year
[02:43:38.920 --> 02:43:42.840]  uh just just so i can document this even more
[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:46.280]  now it was firemen running over police running over like three different
[02:43:46.280 --> 02:43:50.120]  restaurants firemen that were there would would buy our dinner
[02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:53.080]  even though they were you know across the the room from us
[02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:58.040]  and i would see like firemen in their commander outfits because they were all
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:44:02.840]  you know veterans of 9-11 they were there in their dress uniforms
[02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:06.600]  would would say alex we appreciate you we know the truth thank you and cops
[02:44:06.600 --> 02:44:09.160]  was doing it now now again these were people all in their
[02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:12.840]  dress uniforms because they'd been there that's why they won't let them in the
[02:44:12.840 --> 02:44:15.160]  pit that's why they won't let them in with the new
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:18.200]  memorial and all that because they know they're a bunch of 9-11
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:21.160]  truthers bob i've got to say it's like 80 percent of them
[02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:24.840]  and i've had some of the heads of the biggest victim 9-11 families on and
[02:44:24.840 --> 02:44:29.640]  they said years ago that the majority were 9-11 truthers
[02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:35.000]  and i believe that but i think it's high i think you're 80 percent figures
[02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:39.560]  there uh because we've had this uh 10 years to
[02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:43.000]  look the whole thing over and watch the government lie
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:46.280]  and you know people in law enforcement aren't stupid i mean
[02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:50.360]  they'd be set with all kinds of problems every day that
[02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:56.680]  will never run into and so they think outside the box very often
[02:44:56.680 --> 02:44:59.480]  absolutely um
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:03.800]  now i use that word absolutely a lot because it's absolutely true
[02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:08.600]  you just heard saying affirmative bob you're absolutely right affirmative
[02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:11.960]  huh i just used to use that in the military but
[02:45:11.960 --> 02:45:17.080]  that's been over 50 years for me we pull up a thesaurus for
[02:45:17.080 --> 02:45:21.720]  you're correct or hundred percent or on target
[02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:25.000]  nail on the head bob there we go i read you
[02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:30.360]  i read you over okay i want to go to these calls we got some really bad news
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:34.840]  uh we had had the earthquake obviously hit
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:38.760]  and they said that was a once in a century event
[02:45:38.760 --> 02:45:44.120]  very weird and now Irene's coming in and in an unprecedented
[02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:50.600]  decision an unprecedented decision nearly 300 000 people
[02:45:50.600 --> 02:45:54.040]  who live in the flood prone areas of new york city
[02:45:54.040 --> 02:45:57.480]  were ordered to evacuate today this just happened
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:00.840]  as hurricane Irene set its sights on the nation's
[02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:05.960]  largest city new yorkers can you imagine the hellhole that's going to be what
[02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:09.400]  people trying to get out of there new yorkers many of them without cars don't
[02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:12.840]  have much time to get out of the way before the city shudders its
[02:46:12.840 --> 02:46:17.080]  subways buses and trains on saturday
[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:21.000]  and i had my numbers here of when Irene is supposed to hit let me look this up
[02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:25.480]  here um this is kind of like Katrina where
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:28.920]  it's snuck up on people you know i took my first
[02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:33.160]  cruise during uh hurricane Katrina because i didn't know
[02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:36.440]  i knew the tickets were cheaper in hurricane season like an idiot
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:41.000]  we leave on the carnival cruise line to the
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.720]  western caribbean cozy mill in all those places
[02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:47.800]  bob and then on our way back they're not tell everybody to be scared on the
[02:46:47.800 --> 02:46:51.800]  two-day cruise back all of the bar people though are around
[02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:55.320]  the tv's looking completely scared so i started talking to them
[02:46:55.320 --> 02:46:58.600]  and the waves were only about 10 feet then the ship was moving a bit
[02:46:58.600 --> 02:47:03.560]  30 plus foot swells once we got up close to Galveston because it came in on
[02:47:03.560 --> 02:47:06.360]  sunday afternoon they were thinking about
[02:47:06.360 --> 02:47:09.080]  parking in mexico but they made the decision because
[02:47:09.080 --> 02:47:12.280]  Katrina kind of sat there off florida strangely
[02:47:12.280 --> 02:47:15.800]  spinning for a day so they started racing and of course the azapod
[02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:19.000]  stabilizers weren't working they were they closed most of the decks water was
[02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:23.400]  coming in alarms were going off i mean i but in a way it was my
[02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:27.800]  i've been like five cruises now it was it's my favorite trip now that we
[02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:30.520]  survived it because i remember those waves and the sun
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:34.120]  setting and rising with like 35 foot waves and how crazy it was you've ever
[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:36.840]  been in high seas like that bob i bet you have
[02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:40.840]  i certainly have and uh i gotta tell you this uh
[02:47:40.840 --> 02:47:46.520]  very briefly uh when i went over and back to europe i was on a liberty ship
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:52.760]  and when you have a north atlantic storm say in in the winter time uh 35 feet
[02:47:52.760 --> 02:47:56.280]  is nothing and i've seen everything on the
[02:47:56.280 --> 02:48:01.240]  tables for breakfast leave the tables we spend the next three hours cleaning the
[02:48:01.240 --> 02:48:04.600]  floors but uh yes i've been in them and they are
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:08.440]  terrifying i've seen water come right through the portals
[02:48:08.440 --> 02:48:12.040]  well see the liberty ship was a lot smaller and of course those were welded
[02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:15.240]  together and all the time in big storms for those that don't know would break in
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:20.600]  two i was in a giant cruise ship and still i mean it was
[02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:24.680]  it was going and tables were falling over and
[02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:28.280]  water was coming in and let me tell you folks were scared but um
[02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:32.280]  it's weird how though after the fact it was do you kind of having a
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:37.000]  fond memory of your liberty ship experience i do because it that taught
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:42.200]  me how powerful the sea was and uh i was fortunate that it didn't get me
[02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:45.240]  worse than it did well that hurricane literally
[02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:49.800]  chased us and remember it hit sunday night monday morning
[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:53.800]  and and so we got into port and and for three days i was stumbling around
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:57.320]  and then the next day that sucker just came right in i mean here's our ship and
[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:01.160]  here's that hurricane just chasing us and it was amazing so we got a
[02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:04.920]  praper folks in new york mayor michael bloomberg
[02:49:04.920 --> 02:49:09.800]  ordered an evacuation by five p.m saturday for low lying areas of about
[02:49:09.800 --> 02:49:13.480]  270 000 people meanwhile subway buses and commuter
[02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:17.240]  trains in the city of long island and in the northern suburbs will begin their
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:21.400]  final runs around noon saturday what about all the old people and folks that
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:23.320]  aren't going to be able to get out and then they're going to shut everything
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:26.760]  down bob i don't know what they're going to do
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:31.720]  uh i would think that uh the public service would take
[02:49:31.720 --> 02:49:34.840]  care of that the fire department in particular
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:38.760]  and any other organization they have and get them
[02:49:38.760 --> 02:49:41.720]  someplace else
[02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:48.280]  well i sure hope of course if any cops or firemen actually save anybody they'll
[02:49:48.280 --> 02:49:50.520]  probably be barred from any type of memorial services
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:55.320]  how do you bar the heroes of 9 11 from the memorial service what a
[02:49:55.320 --> 02:50:00.200]  blatant it's so bizarre i can't even believe that bob
[02:50:00.200 --> 02:50:04.360]  you're arrogance and it's just as you explained before
[02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:07.640]  the arrogance is going to be their downfall
[02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:11.720]  and i contend you're absolutely perfectly correct
[02:50:11.720 --> 02:50:15.320]  and uh it it's something that's been with these
[02:50:15.320 --> 02:50:21.240]  kind of people for centuries uh they think they can do anything and and in
[02:50:21.240 --> 02:50:25.080]  the masters of the universe if you may and it doesn't work out that way
[02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:29.000]  there's millions of people in the world all over the world
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:33.080]  who are far smarter than they are who just want to see people
[02:50:33.080 --> 02:50:37.720]  live and have a life and die and that's not good enough for these bad people
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:43.240]  they want everybody to die so they can have 20 or 30 percent of the population
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:48.440]  to run around as slaves it's like ancient egypt or whatever
[02:50:48.440 --> 02:50:52.040]  and if you look at the globalist plan it's crazy
[02:50:52.040 --> 02:50:55.400]  i mean by the time they actually start getting into the final phases of it
[02:50:55.400 --> 02:51:01.720]  it turns the planet into some type of dante's inferno

[02:59:57.560 --> 03:00:15.400]  broadcasting network network
[03:00:15.400 --> 03:00:19.080]  by the way in the lead-up to 9-11 they've got all these tv shows and programs
[03:00:19.080 --> 03:00:22.680]  trying to prop up the official story
[03:00:22.680 --> 03:00:26.360]  and they're trying to run this hoax bob bob Chapman joining us
[03:00:26.360 --> 03:00:30.120]  of saying well 9-11 truth's been discredited kind of like
[03:00:30.120 --> 03:00:33.640]  yeah mark twain's dead years before he was actually dead and he said
[03:00:33.640 --> 03:00:36.760]  rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated
[03:00:36.760 --> 03:00:43.320]  uh their little psychological tactics of like ron poll can't win more and more
[03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:47.880]  it's backfiring bob it certainly is and i think
[03:00:47.880 --> 03:00:51.800]  again and again it's talk radio the alternative media
[03:00:51.800 --> 03:00:56.440]  and at the internet and again president ski has it all laid out for the last three
[03:00:56.440 --> 03:00:59.400]  years telling his fellow one world is
[03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:02.520]  look at these guys are breathing down your collar
[03:01:02.520 --> 03:01:07.560]  you better do something about it or the consequences are going to be dreadful
[03:01:07.560 --> 03:01:11.880]  and uh we've heightened it and we're pushing them
[03:01:11.880 --> 03:01:17.560]  and uh i know that then the shows i'm on i'm always in the top three and very
[03:01:17.560 --> 03:01:22.840]  often number one and uh so the people are listening they want to hear
[03:01:22.840 --> 03:01:28.920]  what's going on out there and so we are making great headway
[03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:32.440]  we certainly are let's take another call shonan australia thanks for holding
[03:01:32.440 --> 03:01:36.680]  her on the air with bob Chapman yeah hi bob and elix how are you guys
[03:01:36.680 --> 03:01:40.040]  tonight good thank you good thank you yeah good um well
[03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:45.320]  i'm ringing up to actually provide uh i guess the ron poll campaign and
[03:01:45.320 --> 03:01:49.320]  unwary texans and unwary people in the world some information about
[03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:53.560]  the biotech engineer who developed the gartersill vaccine
[03:01:53.560 --> 03:02:00.760]  um now that was back in 2006 a guy by the name of Ian Fraser who's a uh
[03:02:00.760 --> 03:02:03.960]  who works at the queensland universe in australia
[03:02:03.960 --> 03:02:08.120]  is also the president of the cancer council in australia
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:12.520]  he advises the world health organization and the blender
[03:02:12.520 --> 03:02:17.640]  and bill gates foundation um he's recently and i was aware of that there
[03:02:17.640 --> 03:02:21.320]  that there's something special about that live virus vaccine
[03:02:21.320 --> 03:02:24.920]  uh very special that bill millen the gates want you to take it and
[03:02:24.920 --> 03:02:29.560]  so important that rick perry would try to basically murder every girl in texas
[03:02:29.560 --> 03:02:34.120]  you and hurtlew rockwell call him a brutal murder and criminal earlier
[03:02:34.120 --> 03:02:37.640]  well yeah i mean you've got to look at the people behind these
[03:02:37.640 --> 03:02:41.560]  just faces in the public you know they're nothing more than a face
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:47.640]  but um he's actually developing a skin cancer vaccine
[03:02:47.640 --> 03:02:51.400]  now this is obviously very easy to push on the australians because you know we
[03:02:51.400 --> 03:02:54.520]  love the sun and it was seen in the sunday times
[03:02:54.520 --> 03:02:57.800]  now while we get in perth western australia
[03:02:57.800 --> 03:03:01.080]  i was on the front page of the sunday times about four weeks ago and it was
[03:03:01.080 --> 03:03:04.920]  saying it was basically been hailed as a
[03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:08.600]  break through it before it actually is almost so incredible my friend about
[03:03:08.600 --> 03:03:11.960]  this fraud is that on the drug zone insert it says it
[03:03:11.960 --> 03:03:15.880]  doesn't even it isn't even proven to stop cervical cancer
[03:03:15.880 --> 03:03:19.400]  and it only covers a few of the viruses there's thousands of variants it's a
[03:03:19.400 --> 03:03:24.920]  total hoax and and i was aware i saw that like a week i needed to
[03:03:24.920 --> 03:03:28.040]  cover that now they're going to try to push a skin cancer
[03:03:28.040 --> 03:03:32.920]  vaccine and see what they do is they put cancer viruses in you through vaccines
[03:03:32.920 --> 03:03:35.960]  then they come out as cancer becomes like the common cold
[03:03:35.960 --> 03:03:39.720]  with vaccines that'll cure you but then do something else to you
[03:03:39.720 --> 03:03:43.880]  bob chavin what do you think about this well i think it's terrible and it's
[03:03:43.880 --> 03:03:47.640]  been going on for years and years i mean during the war
[03:03:47.640 --> 03:03:52.600]  the second great war we saw uh german scientists doing all sorts of horrible
[03:03:52.600 --> 03:03:56.040]  things and they didn't seem to have any trouble doing it
[03:03:56.040 --> 03:04:01.000]  and now we have a universal attitude by scientists that
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:04.680]  well it's okay to do that stuff and of course it's not okay
[03:04:04.680 --> 03:04:08.360]  i mean who in their right mind would do a horrible thing like that
[03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:13.400]  rick perry perhaps and the scientists who gave the instrument to
[03:04:13.400 --> 03:04:17.160]  in this case garter cell to do such a thing
[03:04:17.160 --> 03:04:22.040]  in fact i mentioned that in tomorrow's international forecaster
[03:04:22.040 --> 03:04:25.880]  and some of the things we spoke about last friday

[03:05:06.440 --> 03:05:09.480]  could it be that our doctors don't know how because there's a nutrition
[03:05:09.480 --> 03:05:13.880]  solution and they only know about drugs over 68 diseases are known to be
[03:05:13.880 --> 03:05:17.400]  connected to a deficiency of glutathione the missing ingredient to
[03:05:17.400 --> 03:05:20.200]  increasing your body's production of glutathione is
[03:05:20.200 --> 03:05:24.360]  cysteine raising your glutathione production protects you from cancer
[03:05:24.360 --> 03:05:27.720]  heart disease parkinson's macular degeneration

[03:05:31.160 --> 03:05:36.360]  alas rheumatoid arthritis and lupus nature's richest source of cysteine is
[03:05:36.360 --> 03:05:39.880]  unheated whey heating can damage much of the cysteine
[03:05:39.880 --> 03:05:43.720]  one world way is the first undamaged whey protein powder on the market

[03:09:38.040 --> 03:09:44.520]  and i'm not somebody full of courage i'm not somebody who needs to even be
[03:09:44.520 --> 03:09:51.480]  thanked it is a pleasure to spend my time and energy and to pour out
[03:09:51.480 --> 03:09:56.040]  my my will my essence my energy on a worthy cause
[03:09:56.040 --> 03:10:01.320]  i am incredibly honored to be so prominent in the fight for human
[03:10:01.320 --> 03:10:05.240]  liberty in fact i don't feel worthy if you really want to know that's why
[03:10:05.240 --> 03:10:08.840]  people say how great i am or how good i am
[03:10:08.840 --> 03:10:12.360]  it's actually almost like hot coals being dumped on me
[03:10:12.360 --> 03:10:17.080]  because i appreciate them saying that but i think man i got to do a better
[03:10:17.080 --> 03:10:20.840]  job man i've got to work harder i got to
[03:10:20.840 --> 03:10:23.560]  sleep more i've got to work out more you know to be
[03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:26.520]  healthier i've got to i've got to do more research i've
[03:10:26.520 --> 03:10:30.360]  got to get more focused but then i do more work and then i get exhausted and
[03:10:30.360 --> 03:10:36.120]  then uh i'm not as honed i mean it's it's it's a total
[03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:38.920]  commitment we're gonna go back to bob and your calls
[03:10:38.920 --> 03:10:42.120]  right now but i want to get bob's taken what i'm saying and see if he's
[03:10:42.120 --> 03:10:46.120]  experienced this in life as well i would imagine he has
[03:10:46.120 --> 03:10:49.720]  it's just that you realize how short life is and you just want your children
[03:10:49.720 --> 03:10:54.200]  to have a good future and
[03:10:54.280 --> 03:11:00.200]  as as angry as i get at my shelf for not doing enough do you know what it's
[03:11:00.200 --> 03:11:04.120]  like to look at people who have no idea what's coming down
[03:11:04.120 --> 03:11:07.480]  and to see them totally focused on things that don't even matter
[03:11:07.480 --> 03:11:11.560]  and that they laugh at those of us that are informed
[03:11:11.560 --> 03:11:14.600]  but it's strange i've also experienced things in life
[03:11:14.600 --> 03:11:18.600]  that very few people get to experience a lot of people
[03:11:18.600 --> 03:11:22.040]  want to do something they've never done they it gets hyped up
[03:11:22.040 --> 03:11:25.240]  they think it's going to be magical it's going to be incredible and then you
[03:11:25.240 --> 03:11:31.080]  get it and it's not and for me the simple things become
[03:11:31.080 --> 03:11:35.320]  more and more important every day just sitting and reading a book
[03:11:35.320 --> 03:11:39.800]  watercoloring with my children going fishing just sitting on the back porch
[03:11:39.800 --> 03:11:44.760]  stillness quiet and then i think about the general public
[03:11:44.760 --> 03:11:48.040]  totally sold out to madison avenue feeling inadequate
[03:11:48.040 --> 03:11:52.600]  because the television told them so they've never met big top rock stars
[03:11:52.600 --> 03:11:56.520]  or are the biggest hollywood stars there are they've never been invited to the
[03:11:56.520 --> 03:12:00.200]  most elite parties i mean i turn these things down
[03:12:00.200 --> 03:12:04.040]  nine times out of ten because i'd rather just be home i'd rather be here
[03:12:04.040 --> 03:12:07.560]  researching i'd rather be here fighting and i'm not saying oh look at me i'm a
[03:12:07.560 --> 03:12:12.120]  big man i i've broken through the other side i'm
[03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:14.440]  telling people don't feel inadequate because you're
[03:12:14.440 --> 03:12:17.720]  living in a little apartment don't feel inadequate because your hair is falling
[03:12:17.720 --> 03:12:20.040]  out don't feel inadequate because you don't have
[03:12:20.040 --> 03:12:23.560]  the latest trendy clothes don't feel inadequate because you can't take that
[03:12:23.560 --> 03:12:28.440]  hawaii vacation the world is all around you mystery beauty the
[03:12:28.440 --> 03:12:31.560]  secrets of the universe and i'm wanting to talk about this all
[03:12:31.560 --> 03:12:34.440]  week and just got busy with the news and then get into it
[03:12:34.440 --> 03:12:38.200]  i have had
[03:12:38.200 --> 03:12:41.640]  a taste of things that most people never had i've had people
[03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:44.600]  land and pick me up in private wide body jets
[03:12:44.600 --> 03:12:48.440]  i've known the biggest rock stars on the planet i've known some of the biggest
[03:12:48.440 --> 03:12:51.720]  film directors on the planet some of the biggest movie stars on the planet most
[03:12:51.720 --> 03:12:54.040]  of which you never even hear me say their names
[03:12:54.040 --> 03:12:57.480]  and sure it's interesting it's kind of cool
[03:12:57.480 --> 03:13:00.200]  to be sitting across the table for somebody you've seen in the movies
[03:13:00.200 --> 03:13:03.400]  and uh you know get to know them and find out they're real people but then you
[03:13:03.400 --> 03:13:06.920]  find out they're just like you and they're interested in what you're doing
[03:13:06.920 --> 03:13:11.400]  because you're their hero it's really weird
[03:13:11.400 --> 03:13:15.800]  and then you realize there's nothing more the system always sells you in that
[03:13:15.800 --> 03:13:21.240]  there's got to be something more the system always sells you on that you
[03:13:21.240 --> 03:13:24.600]  are worthless the truth is you're powerful you're interesting
[03:13:24.600 --> 03:13:29.160]  and and and i see so many people who just marvel at someone that
[03:13:29.160 --> 03:13:33.000]  is famous and and what and i know bob you've known a lot of famous people been
[03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:36.840]  one of the biggest silver and gold brokers wealthy man you know malibu all
[03:13:36.840 --> 03:13:40.280]  that stuff do you agree with what i just said
[03:13:40.280 --> 03:13:44.040]  i couldn't have said it better and some of the things
[03:13:44.040 --> 03:13:47.880]  even though i've been involved in this for over 50 years
[03:13:47.880 --> 03:13:51.560]  some of the things that you've discovered already it took me
[03:13:51.560 --> 03:13:58.600]  probably 10 or 15 years longer to discover them than than you have
[03:13:58.600 --> 03:14:05.800]  and but that's not surprising because the of the alacrity of news and things
[03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:11.160]  that are going on things are sped up now it's already been trailblazed
[03:14:11.160 --> 03:14:15.160]  you're right and and so i think the bottom line is
[03:14:15.160 --> 03:14:19.720]  don't expect too much out of life i just get the most out of it you can
[03:14:19.720 --> 03:14:22.760]  for yourself and your family and your friends
[03:14:22.760 --> 03:14:28.280]  and uh try to do things that are going to help other people
[03:14:28.280 --> 03:14:33.160]  who don't understand what you do and that's what alex and i do
[03:14:33.160 --> 03:14:36.920]  i mean you know who knows anybody else who spends as long
[03:14:36.920 --> 03:14:40.360]  on radio every week at 76 years old than i do
[03:14:40.360 --> 03:14:44.680]  i mean i love it well exactly i mean that's the issue
[03:14:44.680 --> 03:14:49.160]  is that but it's it's it's not even an obsession it is a total giving over to
[03:14:49.160 --> 03:14:53.640]  something i only enjoy now fighting corruption
[03:14:53.640 --> 03:14:57.240]  exposing liars and spending time with my family
[03:14:57.240 --> 03:15:00.840]  to the point of now it's not even good for the show
[03:15:00.840 --> 03:15:03.960]  that i don't want to call up famous people and get them on even though it
[03:15:03.960 --> 03:15:08.200]  would help the show i just don't even care it's like more and more
[03:15:08.200 --> 03:15:11.240]  this whole world and what we're told is important
[03:15:11.240 --> 03:15:15.480]  isn't important to me anymore and it's almost
[03:15:15.480 --> 03:15:19.720]  it's empowering but it's also kind of crippling in a way
[03:15:19.720 --> 03:15:23.880]  because you start to leave the world but but i'm actually joining the real
[03:15:23.880 --> 03:15:29.000]  world i'm getting away from this fake projection do you see what i'm saying
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:32.680]  absolutely and then you know what you'll find
[03:15:32.680 --> 03:15:39.000]  which i did when i was in my 50s is that the accumulation of
[03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:45.320]  things stops and you become a dis accumulator
[03:15:45.320 --> 03:15:50.440]  and your whole life changes and i think most people go through that
[03:15:50.440 --> 03:15:54.600]  and as you get older if you continue in your field
[03:15:54.600 --> 03:15:58.520]  you get better and better and i think the apex
[03:15:58.520 --> 03:16:05.000]  of the average person's life is from 50 onward because you've had a chance to
[03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:08.360]  learn the things that you need to know whether it's in your profession or the
[03:16:08.360 --> 03:16:11.960]  way of life and yes a lot of people get passed by
[03:16:11.960 --> 03:16:16.360]  but they don't open the door you you've got to be
[03:16:16.360 --> 03:16:21.880]  on a quest to find out new things i love being with young people
[03:16:21.880 --> 03:16:25.560]  i've lived a long time with older people
[03:16:25.560 --> 03:16:30.840]  and i prefer to be with young people because it keeps you young
[03:16:30.840 --> 03:16:35.880]  you couldn't be more right and again i i i went into this
[03:16:35.880 --> 03:16:40.360]  short little piece we're going to nick and uh
[03:16:40.360 --> 03:16:44.520]  jack and uh james and a few others here in just a moment jeff and freddy
[03:16:44.520 --> 03:16:48.200]  it's just that i see people so captured by television
[03:16:48.200 --> 03:16:52.760]  so captured by sitcoms so captured by this fat culture
[03:16:52.760 --> 03:16:58.760]  and they've never attained most of them real success and so that's why they're
[03:16:58.760 --> 03:17:02.680]  feeling lacking and i'm just trying to explain to them success is going down
[03:17:02.680 --> 03:17:07.160]  to the salvation army and feeding homeless people on on christmas eve
[03:17:07.160 --> 03:17:11.480]  success is painting and oil painting success is gardening and growing
[03:17:11.480 --> 03:17:15.880]  good carrots success is enjoying the beauty of the stars at night
[03:17:15.880 --> 03:17:19.800]  success is just loving life and being appreciative
[03:17:19.800 --> 03:17:24.120]  and i i just see so many people who are so empty and bob i'm the opposite i can
[03:17:24.120 --> 03:17:28.680]  tell you're you know like me i am almost exploding and burning
[03:17:28.680 --> 03:17:33.720]  with fulfillment and satisfaction and and then it's torture to see how other
[03:17:33.720 --> 03:17:38.920]  people are not and it's a mind game and i was
[03:17:38.920 --> 03:17:42.520]  already fulfilled to a great extent but i was really fulfilled once i had a lot
[03:17:42.520 --> 03:17:44.840]  of success and met a lot of high-powered people
[03:17:44.840 --> 03:17:48.440]  and found out that it was nothing special that i wasn't missing anything
[03:17:48.440 --> 03:17:52.280]  that i had the holy grail all along do you see what i'm saying
[03:17:52.280 --> 03:17:55.560]  and you didn't know it but now you discovered it and you're right
[03:17:55.560 --> 03:17:59.880]  and of course living among famous people which i did in many places
[03:17:59.880 --> 03:18:04.920]  never mind malibu um you you very quickly find out that they're not
[03:18:04.920 --> 03:18:09.400]  much different than you are it's just that they've reached the apex in their
[03:18:09.400 --> 03:18:13.640]  field and maroc star or whatever or our great
[03:18:13.640 --> 03:18:19.400]  attorney or someone and so forth and and so
[03:18:19.400 --> 03:18:23.640]  you you have to take what you can get from life
[03:18:23.640 --> 03:18:28.520]  and then what you learn transfer to younger people
[03:18:28.520 --> 03:18:33.800]  so that they can know what to expect yeah i think that's the essential
[03:18:33.800 --> 03:18:37.240]  so sorry go ahead that's right now
[03:18:37.240 --> 03:18:41.240]  no what were you saying bob because i missed it
[03:18:41.240 --> 03:18:44.920]  i said gold just crossed over it's up over 50 dollars
[03:18:44.920 --> 03:18:50.360]  wow yeah as you predicted uh let's go to nick who's been holding on k o m

[03:19:30.200 --> 03:19:33.400]  the thought of uh power of controlling lies
[03:19:33.400 --> 03:19:37.240]  uh counterfeiting lies and i have to uh you got bob there um
[03:19:37.240 --> 03:19:41.480]  a lot of the gold is being bought up by um wall street so that makes that
[03:19:41.480 --> 03:19:45.560]  and um that that that will raise the price um
[03:19:45.560 --> 03:19:49.880]  i had some uh thoughts i wanted to give you about weather modification
[03:19:49.880 --> 03:19:53.720]  it went like this is wildfires ignite category five
[03:19:53.720 --> 03:19:57.640]  over alabama you know that can be proved that was a time when you saying that
[03:19:57.640 --> 03:20:01.320]  the russians can uh kill with weather modification
[03:20:01.320 --> 03:20:04.360]  well i was reading out on even the wall street journal in new york times
[03:20:04.360 --> 03:20:09.240]  admitting that uh that uh earthquakes can be man-made they
[03:20:09.240 --> 03:20:12.440]  can be triggered and that's been known for decades but the general public
[03:20:12.440 --> 03:20:17.640]  isn't aware of it well well still uh dispensed dispersed
[03:20:17.640 --> 03:20:21.800]  suppresses uh hurricane you know there was a hurricane back then and it's
[03:20:21.800 --> 03:20:25.800]  simple that before it got anywhere and then and that and that's no
[03:20:25.800 --> 03:20:31.000]  technology was known back in the 60s uh just coat the coat the ocean with a
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:35.720]  well all i want to say is i wish i was with you
[03:20:35.720 --> 03:20:39.560]  out there off the coast of santa cruz because i've been there and it is
[03:20:39.560 --> 03:20:43.800]  ultra beautiful and i am envious of you to no
[03:20:43.800 --> 03:20:48.680]  uh length i mean i mean it's just they talk about that is the beauty
[03:20:48.680 --> 03:20:53.000]  of santa cruz and that blue water god bless you i appreciate your call very
[03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:57.000]  interesting points there uh let's talk to jack listing on 8 10 am
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:21:01.000]  in orlando uh go ahead you're on the air thanks for holding
[03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:04.600]  hello alex thanks for what you do thank you what's on your mind
[03:21:04.600 --> 03:21:08.840]  i got two issues one i believe it would help the ron paul's
[03:21:08.840 --> 03:21:14.680]  uh campaign last time we had the election for president when ron paul
[03:21:14.680 --> 03:21:22.360]  run then he had blue dobs he was on his program uh
[03:21:22.360 --> 03:21:27.640]  promoting everybody go register independent and that broke ron paul out
[03:21:27.640 --> 03:21:31.960]  of the election in the primary hopefully you can get back in touch
[03:21:31.960 --> 03:21:36.600]  with him and talk talk to him and and maybe get him not to do that again
[03:21:36.600 --> 03:21:41.400]  because that really hurt ron paul he's running republicans in the primary in
[03:21:41.400 --> 03:21:45.640]  a lot of states you have to be registered as a republican
[03:21:45.640 --> 03:21:49.080]  just to be able to vote for him you know it seems i remember that
[03:21:49.080 --> 03:21:52.920]  and uh well we can get lou on in fact i was just telling jaren i want to get
[03:21:52.920 --> 03:21:57.080]  lou dobs back on but uh i don't want to really criticize him on air but i can
[03:21:57.080 --> 03:21:59.880]  ask him about that the main reason i want to get him on is get his view on the
[03:21:59.880 --> 03:22:04.840]  economy and obama trying to legalize the illegals by fiat i mean folks the
[03:22:04.840 --> 03:22:08.280]  country's going bankrupt we're going to take 10 million 20 million more and
[03:22:08.280 --> 03:22:13.160]  and then uh even let the felons stay here uh but we'll get lou dobs on about
[03:22:13.160 --> 03:22:18.360]  that but you're absolutely right people need to register as republicans
[03:22:18.360 --> 03:22:21.640]  especially that 50 of the public that never votes
[03:22:21.640 --> 03:22:25.800]  go register and vote for ron paul you can still vote a split ticket
[03:22:25.800 --> 03:22:28.760]  once you get into the general election and vote for whoever you want
[03:22:28.760 --> 03:22:32.920]  it's just now you need to register as republicans that's a very important
[03:22:32.920 --> 03:22:36.360]  point anything else you'd like to add about ron paul
[03:22:36.360 --> 03:22:42.360]  well at least get lou dobs not to promote everybody go out and register as
[03:22:42.360 --> 03:22:46.120]  an independent to just make a statement that's why he was doing
[03:22:46.120 --> 03:22:50.760]  just to make a statement at showing that you're not a democrat or republican
[03:22:50.760 --> 03:22:54.520]  go register and make a statement and register as independent
[03:22:54.520 --> 03:22:57.400]  when people done that then they couldn't vote for ron paul
[03:22:57.400 --> 03:23:01.400]  in the primary i blowed him out bad no i think that probably didn't help but i
[03:23:01.400 --> 03:23:04.840]  think dobs view was then paul was not trending as
[03:23:04.840 --> 03:23:10.280]  well as he is now and so dobs just saying they're all bad boycott it basically
[03:23:10.280 --> 03:23:13.960]  and and you know get out of this two-party system so i could see his
[03:23:13.960 --> 03:23:17.240]  his idea there but certainly not this time ron paul
[03:23:17.240 --> 03:23:23.000]  is a top tier candidate if ron paul don't win the republican primary he'll go
[03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:25.480]  independent and everybody vote for him then
[03:23:25.480 --> 03:23:29.560]  anyhow the other other issues want to bring up real quick
[03:23:29.560 --> 03:23:34.520]  you got a representative a republican representative down there in texas is
[03:23:34.520 --> 03:23:39.160]  named as lamar smith he is the chairman
[03:23:39.160 --> 03:23:44.760]  of the house judiciary committee back about a year ago i think it was july
[03:23:44.760 --> 03:23:49.640]  last year 2010 he was interviewed by lou dobs
[03:23:49.640 --> 03:23:55.400]  and uh... actually you was indicated hinted around about actually following
[03:23:55.400 --> 03:23:59.560]  impeachment papers on the obama on obama because of his
[03:23:59.560 --> 03:24:03.000]  stance on immigration where he sued arizona
[03:24:03.000 --> 03:24:06.600]  you know uh... lamar smith is my congressman since i moved out of austin
[03:24:06.600 --> 03:24:09.640]  i live outside austin so his district comes right up to austin
[03:24:09.640 --> 03:24:12.600]  and he does some good things he's kind of a neocon but
[03:24:12.600 --> 03:24:17.480]  absolutely why haven't we impeached obama i mean the super congress deal
[03:24:17.480 --> 03:24:22.840]  the libya war without congressional approval atf fast and furious garbage
[03:24:22.840 --> 03:24:27.080]  uh... bob there's a bunch of other stuff the banker bailout part two
[03:24:27.080 --> 03:24:30.360]  i mean obama the health care bill well i guess congress passed that they're not
[03:24:30.360 --> 03:24:34.440]  gonna impeach him for that uh... shouldn't obama be impeached
[03:24:34.440 --> 03:24:38.280]  bob well i think there's uh... many things that you've
[03:24:38.280 --> 03:24:43.400]  mentioned but this last one the obama and enabling act
[03:24:43.400 --> 03:24:49.480]  as i call it uh... crafted after the 1933 national socialist
[03:24:49.480 --> 03:24:53.080]  adolf hitler act uh... we call it the budget control
[03:24:53.080 --> 03:24:58.680]  act of two oh one one and the the committee that they have
[03:24:58.680 --> 03:25:03.320]  there is totally unconstitutional set up to bypass congress
[03:25:03.320 --> 03:25:08.840]  and allow the president of the united states to become dictator
[03:25:08.840 --> 03:25:13.320]  that's enough it's amazing i can't believe we've gotten this point
[03:25:13.320 --> 03:25:17.080]  thank you so much jack god bless really good points great call
[03:25:17.080 --> 03:25:20.600]  glad you held uh... james in california you're on the air with bob Chapman go
[03:25:20.600 --> 03:25:24.680]  ahead it's uh... captain caveman from the planet
[03:25:24.680 --> 03:25:31.000]  pop-start school check in good so you're my you're my you're my boss
[03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:34.440]  exactly so anyway quickly uh...
[03:25:34.440 --> 03:25:37.480]  so you had a caller calling uh... i think it was yesterday from maryland
[03:25:37.480 --> 03:25:41.400]  saying he was talking about fall flag and based around some race and a bunch
[03:25:41.400 --> 03:25:43.640]  of stuff that they had going on out there
[03:25:43.640 --> 03:25:47.640]  um... so it's been alleged on various websites obviously
[03:25:47.640 --> 03:25:51.400]  i don't think i could prove it or i'm not sure who could but uh... at the same
[03:25:51.400 --> 03:25:55.080]  time as the virginia earthquake colorado had their earthquake
[03:25:55.080 --> 03:25:59.960]  no that's true no no that's true the five point nine over virginia
[03:25:59.960 --> 03:26:03.720]  and it's been alleged that uh... apparently
[03:26:03.720 --> 03:26:07.560]  those uh... two events one was right there by denver
[03:26:07.560 --> 03:26:11.000]  both were about two point five miles underneath the surface
[03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:14.520]  and it's been alleged that those the tunnels that go from denver all the way
[03:26:14.520 --> 03:26:18.520]  to virginia that these were nukes that were captured
[03:26:18.520 --> 03:26:21.960]  and set off underground and whether or not they were going to be brought
[03:26:21.960 --> 03:26:26.920]  above ground to be moved or to be set off i don't know i can't prove it
[03:26:26.920 --> 03:26:30.040]  um but i was wondering well look we know there's underground bases
[03:26:30.040 --> 03:26:33.640]  under colorado and under dc and they reportedly do connect
[03:26:33.640 --> 03:26:37.560]  um but if you if they detonated a big nuke you'd have more than an earthquake
[03:26:37.560 --> 03:26:40.440]  you'd have radioactive isotopes spilling out
[03:26:40.440 --> 03:26:44.280]  and it would have been identified by university so if you see that
[03:26:44.280 --> 03:26:47.320]  know what you're looking for but scientists did say in the washington
[03:26:47.320 --> 03:26:52.280]  post it was a very rare earthquake maybe a hundred year maybe a 200 year event
[03:26:52.280 --> 03:26:55.480]  and then it wasn't where two plates come together
[03:26:55.480 --> 03:27:01.720]  and so if you start seeing more of this look governments have these systems
[03:27:01.720 --> 03:27:05.960]  they have it where you can do a a a oil rig drilling operation
[03:27:05.960 --> 03:27:09.320]  inside a warehouse where people can't even see it
[03:27:09.320 --> 03:27:13.400]  you can drill down as little as even 3000 feet from the maps i've seen
[03:27:13.400 --> 03:27:18.760]  and pump plastic explosive in detonated at it and again they have
[03:27:18.760 --> 03:27:23.880]  they have maps of uh basically it's like a ground penetrating sonar they have
[03:27:23.880 --> 03:27:28.600]  so they can like actuate key areas of where to trigger
[03:27:28.600 --> 03:27:32.280]  um even with the drilling process and and and again as long as you've got a
[03:27:32.280 --> 03:27:36.120]  two or three story building you could set up one of these rigs drill it pump it
[03:27:36.120 --> 03:27:39.640]  and then nobody knows so that's something governments admittedly have
[03:27:39.640 --> 03:27:42.520]  then you get into nukes you get into harp and stuff
[03:27:42.520 --> 03:27:47.160]  all i'm saying is it's proven that they can do it with the
[03:27:47.160 --> 03:27:54.120]  uh the oil well technologies pumping explosives in bob Chapman any comments
[03:27:54.120 --> 03:27:59.160]  no that's kind of out of my field um i'll pass
[03:27:59.160 --> 03:28:03.000]  we did cover that again yesterday caller uh we
[03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:06.520]  had a boil down article from torus washington blog showing main street
[03:28:06.520 --> 03:28:09.720]  well the us geological survey admitted that just regular oil
[03:28:09.720 --> 03:28:14.600]  field and gas field exploration has been proven to trigger earthquakes
[03:28:14.600 --> 03:28:19.320]  but uh you know i i really think people that say nukes did this
[03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:22.600]  if you speculate that's one thing but to say in the affirmative
[03:28:22.600 --> 03:28:26.440]  that's like saying this common ellenon is going to kill us
[03:28:26.440 --> 03:28:29.880]  and then i've seen the tracks people put out and they've got the comment coming
[03:28:29.880 --> 03:28:34.200]  by and it's tail hitting us that isn't how it works the comment
[03:28:34.200 --> 03:28:38.040]  is coming between us and the sun okay and so
[03:28:38.040 --> 03:28:43.800]  a tail of a comet aims back at the sun okay as it goes around
[03:28:43.800 --> 03:28:47.240]  and and it's a tiny little comment and it was in like
[03:28:47.240 --> 03:28:51.000]  july people were calling saying some other planet or something was going to
[03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:53.480]  hit us and i was going to be in a bunker and we wouldn't be here
[03:28:53.480 --> 03:28:56.920]  and then a month later it's a new one and then a new one and a new one and
[03:28:56.920 --> 03:29:00.200]  it'll be this that uh i appreciate your call
[03:29:00.200 --> 03:29:03.880]  bob what do you call this phenomenon where people
[03:29:03.880 --> 03:29:06.840]  are always obsessed with a new comet or planet that's going to kill us next
[03:29:06.840 --> 03:29:09.160]  month
[03:29:09.160 --> 03:29:12.920]  i don't know but uh you know there's so many
[03:29:12.920 --> 03:29:17.960]  things i've seen in my life that people say well this is coming and that's
[03:29:17.960 --> 03:29:23.160]  going to happen and they haven't and so i certainly take it all with a grain
[03:29:23.160 --> 03:29:26.120]  of salt absolutely i don't know how they come
[03:29:26.120 --> 03:29:29.640]  up with these decisions sometimes
[03:29:30.840 --> 03:29:34.600]  i think a lot of it's a disinformation campaign because the same groups every
[03:29:34.600 --> 03:29:37.320]  month that say it's a new planet or a new comet
[03:29:37.320 --> 03:29:41.320]  then they're right back to next month and and they're either con artists
[03:29:41.320 --> 03:29:44.680]  mentally ill or their government operatives and they're scaring a lot of
[03:29:44.680 --> 03:29:47.400]  well-meaning people bob Chapman god bless you we'll see you
[03:29:47.400 --> 03:30:05.160]  back next week friday lord willing and i'll see you folks sunday four to six
