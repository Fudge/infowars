[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:34.320]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.320 --> 00:42.160]  we are live it is Tuesday the 23rd day of August 2011 we're gonna be
[00:42.160 --> 00:47.640]  live here for the next three hours Paul Joseph Watson has detailed reports on
[00:47.640 --> 00:54.400]  the latest Libya hoax that all of Gaddafi's sons have been captured and
[00:54.400 --> 00:59.320]  that Gaddafi would be captured within hours they were seeing that last night
[00:59.320 --> 01:07.840]  the truth is a bunch of al Qaeda forces led by US and NATO commanders landed now
[01:07.840 --> 01:12.680]  two and a half days ago off the coast in a nighttime landing and engage in a
[01:12.680 --> 01:19.900]  special forces disop destabilization disinformation operation basically
[01:19.900 --> 01:26.520]  blowing up buildings setting fires a classic operation you see it fictionalized
[01:26.520 --> 01:33.160]  and something like red dawn where disguised jumbo jets come in and the
[01:33.160 --> 01:39.120]  nose cones pop off and special forces troops come out and seize control the
[01:39.120 --> 01:45.560]  police stations and take control of the surrounding area that only works in
[01:45.560 --> 01:50.320]  places where the populations disarmed or psychologically as weak and will lay
[01:50.320 --> 01:57.480]  down and the fact that the American people aren't more upset over the fact
[01:57.480 --> 02:01.120]  that we're quote teamed up with al Qaeda who knows they could have our guess
[02:01.120 --> 02:04.720]  al Qaeda come here and the American people will probably bow down to them if
[02:04.720 --> 02:11.080]  the government told them that they should that's pretty amazing we got Paul
[02:11.080 --> 02:16.560]  Watson joining us we got Webster Tarpley popping back in Tarpley was saying hey
[02:16.560 --> 02:21.760]  this looks like a disinformation operation yesterday and I was partially
[02:21.760 --> 02:27.640]  rolling my eyes I mean I know there was a battle still going on for Tripoli but
[02:27.640 --> 02:32.600]  now we've really got a clear image of what's going on here and I'll be
[02:32.600 --> 02:36.600]  covering that after the break but the long and short of it is they need a
[02:36.600 --> 02:43.360]  beachhead inside Tripoli as a pretext to now recognize it as the official
[02:43.360 --> 02:48.440]  government of Libya and then have the official government the al Qaeda
[02:48.440 --> 02:55.920]  operatives put out the SOS and request foreign troops to occupy that way they
[02:55.920 --> 03:00.720]  play this psychological game of oh the foreign troops aren't occupying we're
[03:00.720 --> 03:06.880]  asking you to come in oh the United States was gonna leave in 2004 and 2005
[03:06.880 --> 03:11.160]  and six and seven and eight nine and ten and eleven but every year the Iraqi
[03:11.160 --> 03:17.280]  puppet government says no stay longer so see we're not occupying the puppet
[03:17.280 --> 03:25.160]  government says oh please stay and so the al Qaeda government sniping men
[03:25.160 --> 03:29.880]  women and children blowing up buildings can now be given the government of
[03:29.880 --> 03:34.160]  Libya seized assets and are calling for British Special Forces troops and other
[03:34.160 --> 03:38.760]  NATO troops along with US troops to openly come into the city and finish
[03:38.760 --> 03:44.080]  off Qaddafi and so that's where this is headed now if the rebels can get it done
[03:44.080 --> 03:48.680]  the establishment wants that because they know there's a good chance that once
[03:48.680 --> 03:52.160]  the Western troops are openly running around which has already been
[03:52.160 --> 03:57.000]  happening that it's going to have a lot of Libyans go ahead and decide to stand
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.080]  up for their country even if they're not fans of a person that looks like a
[04:03.080 --> 04:08.640]  microwaved wax figurine but looks aren't really what matters at the end of the
[04:08.640 --> 04:14.040]  day Muammar Qaddafi so we're gonna be going over all of that but I heard John
[04:14.040 --> 04:19.600]  McCain this morning on the radio saying look it's over it's done this is a
[04:19.600 --> 04:24.440]  public relations to say that there's a counterattack happening well the
[04:24.440 --> 04:28.440]  counterattack is admitted it's admitted that the rebels are being routed in many
[04:28.440 --> 04:34.540]  areas of the city but there's special forces Western special forces led attack
[04:34.540 --> 04:40.640]  teams trying to take over the Qaddafi compound because that's where the gold
[04:40.640 --> 04:44.400]  set I mean they at least want to get their hands on those goodies wherever
[04:44.400 --> 04:50.240]  Qaddafi may be so it is it is off the charts crazy we've got the economic news
[04:50.240 --> 04:54.080]  coming up as well you want to stay with us we'll be right back after this quick

[06:12.560 --> 06:16.840]  the Americans at home. I've turned the members influence on our president in
[06:16.840 --> 06:21.680]  Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[06:21.680 --> 06:26.680]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies
[06:26.680 --> 06:31.280]  the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on

[08:12.400 --> 08:30.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:30.800 --> 08:39.520]  It is Tuesday the 23rd day of August 2011. Paul Joseph Watson's joining us via
[08:39.520 --> 08:44.480]  video Skype from England. Webster Griffin Tarpley who's recently been to
[08:44.480 --> 08:48.520]  Tripoli and been under bombardment is going to be popping in to give us his
[08:48.520 --> 08:54.160]  latest analysis on what's happening in Libya and we have a maiden voyage here
[08:54.160 --> 08:58.000]  of a political researcher who I've listened to and read over the years.
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.240]  Harley Schlinger will be joining us coming up in the second hour to talk
[09:03.240 --> 09:08.880]  about world events and the economy and of course we'll have open phones
[09:08.880 --> 09:15.680]  throughout the entire third hour today. Coming up I'm going to get into the big
[09:15.680 --> 09:20.360]  economic developments also news that Strauss-Cons New York sexual assault
[09:20.360 --> 09:30.680]  case has been dismissed. All a setup. All a sigh up. Also new home sales fall 2011
[09:30.680 --> 09:36.000]  could be worse year yet. I thought we were in a great recovery. By the way I
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.800]  keep getting emails going Alex it was 17 trillion given to the foreign banks
[09:40.800 --> 09:43.800]  along with the new one and a half trillion we're learning that was
[09:43.800 --> 09:48.600]  secretly given to offshore banks. I know this is an additional trillion plus we
[09:48.600 --> 09:53.160]  just discovered that Bloomberg reported on yesterday. If you put all the numbers
[09:53.160 --> 09:56.280]  together the number I got as of a year ago and they haven't released new
[09:56.280 --> 10:03.480]  numbers is 28 trillion dollars given to offshore banks and domestic media. It's
[10:03.480 --> 10:10.320]  a total buy-off. A total payoff. Some of them direct cash payments others zero or
[10:10.320 --> 10:14.640]  less percent loans to banking institutions that then turn around and
[10:14.640 --> 10:18.840]  loan the money out. Ten to one for every dollar they have they can loan out ten
[10:18.840 --> 10:24.040]  and get interest on that. It's literally making money out of nothing. So we're
[10:24.040 --> 10:32.200]  going to be going over all of that as well today. Now that said I want to just
[10:32.200 --> 10:36.400]  briefly break down what happened in Libya and give you the latest big
[10:36.400 --> 10:45.200]  developments the latest hoax that's been exposed. Muammar Gaddafi 40 years ago
[10:45.200 --> 10:51.040]  staged a coup against the British government backed puppet dictator that
[10:51.040 --> 11:01.920]  operated as a royal house. A monarchy. Before that the fascist had been in
[11:01.920 --> 11:07.040]  there under Mussolini they the first use of nerve gas against populations. The
[11:07.040 --> 11:11.280]  Libyans are just constantly being overrun and taken over and they fought
[11:11.280 --> 11:17.000]  back each time and they're sick of it. And so Gaddafi kicks out the British
[11:17.000 --> 11:24.280]  installed puppet monarchy 40 years ago. He is a dictator but he's a popular
[11:24.280 --> 11:28.960]  dictator overall and actually does give mostly oil wealth to the population. The
[11:28.960 --> 11:38.120]  population explodes. Cities rise out of the desert. Gaddafi gets framed a lot
[11:38.120 --> 11:45.640]  for terrorism that Iran carries out. Gaddafi clearly not a good guy at the end
[11:45.640 --> 11:50.560]  of the day but compared to the globalist he is not in line with their
[11:50.560 --> 11:57.760]  overall world program. Seven years ago he signs deals with Europe in the US to
[11:57.760 --> 12:02.440]  let the big banks and big insurance companies and oil companies come in
[12:02.440 --> 12:07.800]  again and privatize things. He starts handing the economy over to the
[12:07.800 --> 12:12.840]  bankers because he knew that they were ready to militarily come in and take
[12:12.840 --> 12:17.000]  him out. They tried to assassinate him a bunch using al-Qaeda that came out in
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.080]  the BBC. So he said okay I'll just give you most the country just let us keep
[12:22.080 --> 12:26.320]  some of the oil revenue for the population and they said no. Now first
[12:26.320 --> 12:32.520]  they let him think that he'd made a deal and seven years later they launched
[12:32.520 --> 12:38.800]  al-Qaeda operations out of the east admitted al-Qaeda. I have the LA Times
[12:38.800 --> 12:45.240]  here admitting it. The rebel leader admittedly brags that he helped kill
[12:45.240 --> 12:49.680]  Americans in Iraq and says I still hate Americans and so you've got to decide
[12:49.680 --> 12:55.880]  are you for national sovereignty and Qaddafi or are you for al-Qaeda and NATO?
[12:55.880 --> 13:01.120]  And the big mega banks the same mega banks looting America the same mega
[13:01.120 --> 13:05.680]  banks that threatened Congress three years ago with martial law if they
[13:05.680 --> 13:09.840]  wouldn't give them untold trillions. The same mega banks that threatened just a
[13:09.840 --> 13:16.680]  month ago. Ireland and of course Greece with quote martial law tanks in the
[13:16.680 --> 13:21.840]  streets. I mean they told the parliament in Greece they said you will do this or
[13:21.840 --> 13:26.360]  the president is just gonna do it there's gonna be tanks in the streets. I
[13:26.360 --> 13:33.720]  mean that was in Reuters. The bankers say they'll be tanks in the streets and how
[13:33.720 --> 13:36.880]  would they do that they'll just blow up a government building say protesters did
[13:36.880 --> 13:42.040]  it roll tanks out and start arresting people real simple. Bankers come in blow
[13:42.040 --> 13:46.320]  something up run around posing as the saviors the media they own will go with
[13:46.320 --> 13:50.920]  the official story with a straight face hoax the public that's how they do this.
[13:50.920 --> 13:55.520]  I mean how do you think offshore corporations are gonna take America
[13:55.520 --> 14:00.640]  over they're gonna play dirty tricks it's very elementary they're gonna pose
[14:00.640 --> 14:03.840]  as your savior they're gonna tell you they're protecting you from terrorism
[14:03.840 --> 14:07.920]  they are the ones financing the terrorist they are staging the terror
[14:07.920 --> 14:12.040]  attacks they ran al-Qaeda in Serbia they ran them against the Russians they're
[14:12.040 --> 14:18.280]  running them against Qaddafi they're running them against Assad of Syria this
[14:18.280 --> 14:27.720]  is just a miscreant Muslim brigade of mercenaries that's all they are after
[14:27.720 --> 14:33.000]  the US and NATO took over Afghanistan in 2001 2002 they flew 8,000 Taliban
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.760]  al-Qaeda commanders out to safety into Pakistan to start the next phase of
[14:38.760 --> 14:45.360]  destabilization they just move them around they want to take over your
[14:45.360 --> 14:50.080]  backyard take over your town they take their al-Qaeda chess piece and they put
[14:50.080 --> 14:56.640]  it in your yard they want to take your house the cops plant cocaine at it they
[14:56.640 --> 15:01.600]  want to take your country they plant al-Qaeda now it's very simple so what's
[15:01.600 --> 15:07.160]  the new breaking information here Paul Joseph Watson has links to the one in
[15:07.160 --> 15:12.760]  Telegraph and other mainline reports in his boil-down article MI6 directed
[15:12.760 --> 15:21.120]  rebel terrorist in Tripoli siege and all that happened here is they voted in at
[15:21.120 --> 15:28.920]  night several thousand al-Qaeda with MI6 commanders and they started blowing up
[15:28.920 --> 15:33.360]  high-rise buildings rocket attacking police stations attacking apartment
[15:33.360 --> 15:37.800]  buildings to create fear in the general public now this is a special forces
[15:37.800 --> 15:41.640]  tactic the Russians admittedly had a plan for this the United States had a
[15:41.640 --> 15:47.600]  plan with the NATO stay-behind networks known as Gladio and what you do is you
[15:47.600 --> 15:52.000]  have special forces that are either inserted or or deep cover operatives
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.640]  and one person a real terrorist can go dump chlorine gas into the air
[15:56.640 --> 16:01.320]  conditioning system of a high-rise building kill 10,000 people and I'm not
[16:01.320 --> 16:05.560]  letting secrets out here this is all well-known one or two operatives can
[16:05.560 --> 16:10.400]  burn down five or six skyscrapers with timers all you do is truck gasoline up
[16:10.400 --> 16:17.880]  into them a 20-person team could have Austin looking like World War three in
[16:17.880 --> 16:24.880]  one hour okay the Russians have these systems the Chinese admittedly have more
[16:24.880 --> 16:28.080]  than 20,000 that's come out congressional reports stay behind
[16:28.080 --> 16:34.280]  operatives they're running grocery stores they're working at factories I mean
[16:34.280 --> 16:37.600]  they've got saboteurs everywhere and the United States and private
[16:37.600 --> 16:42.240]  corporations they have saboteurs everywhere now the US has saboteurs
[16:42.240 --> 16:47.240]  inside the US they've got 5,000 Iraqis they brought in and sheep dipped that
[16:47.240 --> 16:56.040]  came out in the LA Times in 2003 they've also got the other system in
[16:56.040 --> 17:01.640]  regard which are over a hundred thousand executives who have shoot to kill
[17:01.640 --> 17:05.960]  orders of their employees if they don't follow orders during martial law and you
[17:05.960 --> 17:09.040]  got all these guys on power trips with their gun in their desks and a little
[17:09.040 --> 17:15.280]  FBI security card and and if a lot of these idiots if they're told blow up
[17:15.280 --> 17:19.560]  the chemical plant they'll do it I mean I mean folks we are so riddle with
[17:19.560 --> 17:26.160]  saboteurs it'll make your head spin and it's not but but side issue the point is
[17:26.160 --> 17:29.440]  they put in reportedly a couple thousand operatives and they just started
[17:29.440 --> 17:34.200]  randomly blowing things up killing thousands of civilians total bedlam a
[17:34.200 --> 17:39.560]  special forces destabilization operation so that Gaddafi's forces started
[17:39.560 --> 17:42.560]  running in every direction trying to fight them then they made their way
[17:42.560 --> 17:48.160]  towards government buildings and towards the Gold Horde under the Gaddafi
[17:48.160 --> 17:56.560]  ministerial buildings they want that 144 tons of gold to give it to the rebels so
[17:56.560 --> 17:59.440]  they can then later set up a new al-Qaeda base and then the public will
[17:59.440 --> 18:03.360]  remember in two to five years that that it was all staged and we'll have to go
[18:03.360 --> 18:07.760]  into Tripoli again again they don't want an industrialized first-world nation
[18:07.760 --> 18:12.560]  that's this is all about so they want to get the civil war going and then have
[18:12.560 --> 18:17.760]  NATO sit back just controlling Tripoli and some of the key ports and oil
[18:17.760 --> 18:23.400]  production facilities so all of that's going on now we've heard in the last six
[18:23.400 --> 18:27.360]  months eight different times I went and looked up the State Department numbers
[18:27.360 --> 18:31.560]  eight different times even before four and a half months ago when NATO
[18:31.560 --> 18:36.120]  officially got involved we've heard at least eight times that Gaddafi's been
[18:36.120 --> 18:40.880]  killed or captured or his sons have or that he fled the country and Obama said
[18:40.880 --> 18:46.680]  this will last days not weeks so now four and a half months is days not weeks
[18:46.680 --> 18:52.920]  okay and again it's not a war it's a kinetic action they talk to you like
[18:52.920 --> 18:58.360]  your complete and utter morons they come out and tell you the Constitution is
[18:58.360 --> 19:05.040]  over and a bad thing CNN last night was saying there's no such thing as a war
[19:05.040 --> 19:08.360]  powers anymore Congress can't get that power back it now resides with the
[19:08.360 --> 19:12.000]  president I mean they're just stating high trees and everywhere this isn't a
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.640]  war we don't need Congress we don't need Congress for war taxes I mean they're
[19:17.640 --> 19:21.280]  just in your face and then they said all the sons are captured and killed
[19:21.280 --> 19:29.120]  100% and then now it's come out today here's time magazine as Saif al-Islam
[19:29.120 --> 19:35.400]  Gaddafi turns up free confusion reigns in Libya and it comes out that there's
[19:35.400 --> 19:41.320]  battles all over Tripoli with the dug in special forces now when I come back I'm

[24:01.240 --> 24:21.760]  well we're seeing the humanitarian bloodletting much of Tripoli is on fire
[24:21.760 --> 24:26.800]  day and night citizens are being slaughtered and indiscriminately killed
[24:26.800 --> 24:34.600]  by terror squads and death squads of course coming up when Paul Joseph Watson
[24:34.600 --> 24:41.400]  joins us we have a reported audio but who knows if it's been staged of one of
[24:41.400 --> 24:49.560]  Gaddafi's sons Mohammed Gaddafi being captured by rebels but we've seen so much
[24:49.560 --> 24:54.680]  fake reportage we don't know what's true just like we've been told that all of the
[24:54.680 --> 24:58.960]  sons were captured but now we know that that's not the case Libyan rebels
[24:58.960 --> 25:04.440]  capture Gaddafi's Tripoli compound AFP is reporting right now and it is
[25:04.440 --> 25:10.760]  confirmed that US British and other NATO forces are in there commanding the
[25:10.760 --> 25:15.800]  rebels and basically leading assaults so the next few months you'll hear about
[25:15.800 --> 25:21.280]  lots of troop transport planes that crash in the US in Europe and they'll
[25:21.280 --> 25:24.960]  just tack the numbers of dead onto that even though their bodies will already
[25:24.960 --> 25:29.800]  be sitting on ice in morgues at military bases and we've confirmed that a lot of
[25:29.800 --> 25:34.840]  US troops have already died over there it's now more than 50 in the last four
[25:34.840 --> 25:39.840]  and a half months of the non-war but again you'll just be told later that
[25:39.840 --> 25:44.480]  they died in automobile accidents and plane crashes I've talked directly to
[25:44.480 --> 25:51.280]  the people at the military bases now continuing here what's the big issue
[25:51.280 --> 25:55.760]  why did they do this because even if they can't fully take Tripoli NATO and
[25:55.760 --> 26:02.960]  their al-Qaeda forces these are admitted al-Qaeda here's the LA Times on it Libyan
[26:02.960 --> 26:10.520]  rebels story shows links to Taliban al-Qaeda NATO oh really wow I mean it's
[26:10.520 --> 26:15.080]  admitted that all the leaders of the rebel groups are al-Qaeda and being
[26:15.080 --> 26:19.560]  shipped in by the way it's official I've got an article Sharia law is to be put
[26:19.560 --> 26:26.240]  into place there women you're gonna start wearing the the burqas same thing
[26:26.240 --> 26:31.960]  in Egypt same thing in Iraq they put the Muslim extremists in everywhere that's
[26:31.960 --> 26:36.480]  who the West wants in power that's why they created al-Qaeda then they can also
[26:36.480 --> 26:41.120]  then use that threat to take our liberties it works like a charm see the
[26:41.120 --> 26:45.920]  globalist are attacking America and the Muslims but we're thinking oh America's
[26:45.920 --> 26:49.760]  fighting Muslims you've got to get into the globalist mindset of total war
[26:49.760 --> 26:54.400]  against all institutions and civilization and the nation state they
[26:54.400 --> 26:58.120]  want to wreck societies so here's what's gonna happen
[26:58.120 --> 27:04.280]  Gaddafi will either be captured or killed soon or they are going to send in
[27:04.280 --> 27:11.560]  US British and other troops under the umbrella of NATO and the UN and the
[27:11.560 --> 27:16.040]  further scorched earth terror operations and slaughter meant to scare the
[27:16.040 --> 27:19.720]  population into submission NATO admittedly dropping these giant sonic
[27:19.720 --> 27:25.160]  bombs that shake the ground and and and and and just cause you know ear
[27:25.160 --> 27:28.840]  splitting noises just like at Waco playing the sounds of dead and dying
[27:28.840 --> 27:33.840]  rabbits with monks chanting it's psychological just so everybody's
[27:33.840 --> 27:36.680]  being attacked from every side they don't know what's going on then they
[27:36.680 --> 27:41.840]  announced yes we've got Gaddafi we've got his sons we've won they've announced
[27:41.840 --> 27:48.160]  that over and over again then the rebels call for the foreign occupiers they're
[27:48.160 --> 27:53.160]  the official government we're told and this can happen anywhere they can have
[27:53.160 --> 27:57.840]  uprisings and then the UN and the globalist recognize it you're gonna end up
[27:57.840 --> 28:01.680]  in the future having uprisings in the southwest of illegals that have been
[28:01.680 --> 28:05.560]  taught this is Mexico and you're gonna see our government recognize them and
[28:05.560 --> 28:10.320]  break off part of the southwest to be part of an autonomous UN run enclave
[28:10.320 --> 28:15.560]  that's that's on the board in the North American Union SPP plans they
[28:15.560 --> 28:19.960]  merge the three countries Canada the US and Mexico but then break up separate
[28:19.960 --> 28:24.280]  ethnic enclave just like in Canada the globalists have tried to break it up
[28:24.280 --> 28:31.640]  with the French in the east and I'm not getting in the middle of French separatists
[28:31.640 --> 28:34.800]  at the end of the day I could care less the point is is that that's what the
[28:34.800 --> 28:43.320]  globalists are up to now continuing here you're going to see now what we talked
[28:43.320 --> 28:48.680]  about in September October the US forces going in if Gaddafi would have
[28:48.680 --> 28:53.640]  fully repelled this attack they would have still gone in but now because it
[28:53.640 --> 28:59.280]  looks like from what I've seen that it's a fluid situation Gaddafi has not had a
[28:59.280 --> 29:03.560]  very strong response to this the hoax is running that he's already been defeated
[29:03.560 --> 29:06.640]  that hasn't happened but the fact that they've been able to insert these
[29:06.640 --> 29:10.360]  special forces they've got apaches in there attacking any of his troops that
[29:10.360 --> 29:16.560]  try to repulse the al-Qaeda heroes according to our media that they're just
[29:16.560 --> 29:21.120]  going to continue burning the city until everything's destroyed and then that
[29:21.120 --> 29:23.720]  will make the banks even happier because then they can come in and
[29:23.720 --> 29:31.040]  obviously loan them more fiat currency and make them debt slaves so that's
[29:31.040 --> 29:36.360]  what's happening there but you are seeing the Nobel Peace Laureate bring
[29:36.360 --> 29:42.160]  absolute death and destruction and put al-Qaeda in and then of course they're
[29:42.160 --> 29:46.560]  going to then use Libya as a base to start attacking Europe in the United
[29:46.560 --> 29:52.320]  States and then that'll be used to take our freedoms we're on the march the
[29:52.320 --> 30:01.440]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with
[30:01.440 --> 30:05.200]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number

[36:03.600 --> 36:09.960]  mohammed kadafi son she's been more of our kadafi son turned up free to thwart
[36:09.960 --> 36:14.240]  libyan rebels claims he had been captured a move that seems to have
[36:14.240 --> 36:21.680]  energized forces still loyal to the embattled regime and kadafi has put out
[36:21.680 --> 36:25.200]  new messages saying he's never going to give up that he's gonna go down with the
[36:25.200 --> 36:30.280]  ship and he says this is foreign occupation libyans resist let's go and
[36:30.280 --> 36:34.200]  go to this club here it is however i can tell you the absence of wisdom and
[36:34.200 --> 36:38.400]  foresight is what brought us here today our differences could have been sold
[36:38.400 --> 36:41.400]  very easily
[36:47.120 --> 36:52.680]  i'm being attacked right now this is gunfire inside my house they're inside
[36:52.680 --> 36:55.160]  my house
[36:55.160 --> 37:17.000]  there's no god but Allah there you go there is the liberation of the 144
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.920]  tons of gold the liberation of thousands of people's lives the carpet
[37:21.920 --> 37:26.520]  bombing of Tripoli and other cities their entire infrastructure being
[37:26.520 --> 37:33.400]  decimated huge areas going up in flame u.s. british other european troops
[37:33.400 --> 37:40.200]  literally commanding brigades of people who were in iraq as a short of time as
[37:40.200 --> 37:46.960]  just a year ago people who brag in the news you can just pull up al qaeda libyan
[37:46.960 --> 37:51.320]  rebels brag of killing americans and they're like yes we hate americans but
[37:51.320 --> 37:58.840]  we hate qaddafi more i will go back to killing americans later but now i kill
[37:58.840 --> 38:04.440]  qaddafi i mean this is how sick the bankers are well of course they created
[38:04.440 --> 38:08.640]  al qaeda so what do you expect joining us via video skype for prison planet dot
[38:08.640 --> 38:13.000]  tv viewers obviously for radio listeners you're tuning in but if you're a radio
[38:13.000 --> 38:16.200]  listener would like to be able to watch become a prison planet dot tv member and
[38:16.200 --> 38:19.520]  then also supports the broadcast paul watson reporting to us from england
[38:19.520 --> 38:23.440]  you've been tracking this look yesterday even though the media was
[38:23.440 --> 38:27.280]  announcing that tripoli had totally fallen all the sons were captured qaddafi
[38:27.280 --> 38:32.280]  would be captured within hours even though they were saying it was a hundred
[38:32.280 --> 38:36.560]  percent i said it may not be the truth because eight separate times they've
[38:36.560 --> 38:41.360]  claimed to have killed him or captured him or that he's fled the country and
[38:41.360 --> 38:46.160]  again i'm no fan of qaddafi but compared to al qaeda you know you've got to sit
[38:46.160 --> 38:49.400]  here and watch these people being slaughtered and killed and watch the
[38:49.400 --> 38:53.640]  bankers using al qaeda it's just absolutely disgusting and at a certain
[38:53.640 --> 38:58.640]  level you've got to see qaddafi as the underdog and realize how he's held on
[38:58.640 --> 39:03.800]  to power for 40 years he could have high-tailed it to south africa or scores
[39:03.800 --> 39:08.000]  of other countries that would have had him but he didn't he has chosen to stay
[39:08.000 --> 39:12.960]  behind with his sons and his entire family and undoubtedly die i will say at
[39:12.960 --> 39:16.840]  this point nothing is going to stop nato they will send in u.s. troops they will
[39:16.840 --> 39:23.400]  send in the first cav they will send in three core they will level every
[39:23.400 --> 39:27.200]  building kill every man woman and child and rub the blood all over their faces
[39:27.200 --> 39:31.400]  with al qaeda in a celebration of death they will be praised as our al qaeda
[39:31.400 --> 39:38.760]  saviors this is incredible poem all the latest alex is that this assault on the
[39:38.760 --> 39:46.040]  qaddafi compound is being led by directed by non rebels basically a non rebel
[39:46.040 --> 39:50.640]  force is now directing the rebels with this assault on his compound now they're
[39:50.640 --> 39:54.680]  saying according to Reuters that qaddafi may have escaped via underground
[39:54.680 --> 40:00.120]  tunnels so again yesterday they said he'd left triply then he qaddafi get
[40:00.120 --> 40:04.800]  told the one of the big chess champions who gave an interview that he was still
[40:04.800 --> 40:10.280]  in triply so there's an element of bagdad bob on both sides of the equation
[40:10.280 --> 40:16.840]  but what we know for sure is that this assault is being directed by primarily
[40:16.840 --> 40:23.400]  british intelligence we had the article earlier today m i said i'm only six
[40:23.400 --> 40:28.840]  directed rebel terrorists in triply siege and basically this was in the
[40:28.840 --> 40:34.840]  pipeline 10 weeks ago you had the massive raf fighter jet strafing triply
[40:34.840 --> 40:40.800]  over the weekend and then mi6 and nato shipped in their al qaeda terrorists and
[40:40.800 --> 40:46.040]  the the bloodbath began but now it's admitted the london telegraph report
[40:46.040 --> 40:53.960]  that mi6 is directing this entire operation debka file literally half an
[40:53.960 --> 40:58.560]  hour ago is reporting that this attack on qaddafi's compound is being led by
[40:58.560 --> 41:06.200]  british french jordanian and qatari special forces now debka file were the
[41:06.200 --> 41:10.800]  ones who reported back in early july that nato wanted qaddafi toppled by the
[41:10.800 --> 41:14.920]  start of september so they've been accurate in the past and then you have
[41:14.920 --> 41:19.520]  other reports that the rebels being directed by a quote non rebel presence
[41:19.520 --> 41:24.320]  so while we have the establishment media again engaging in this mass hoax that
[41:24.320 --> 41:30.640]  this is some organic uprising it's all being led by globalist forces they want
[41:30.640 --> 41:35.000]  the oil they want the gold they want libya as a springboard to attack other
[41:35.000 --> 41:41.120]  countries and as we predicted the beginning of july the window is now
[41:41.120 --> 41:46.760]  they need to get it done before that libya is got great air bases to menace
[41:46.760 --> 41:51.640]  egypt that's another big part of this plus libya was financing the development
[41:51.640 --> 41:56.560]  of africa and had the highest standard of living in africa now eclipsing south
[41:56.560 --> 42:01.600]  africa that could not be allowed just like serbia nothing like a good d u
[42:01.600 --> 42:07.000]  bombing to triple birth defect slaughter some people and will obama get a second
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.640]  peace prize i'm not joking mainstream media just a few weeks ago said he
[42:11.640 --> 42:16.840]  should be given a second peace prize paul perhaps we should give hitler one
[42:16.840 --> 42:25.040]  posthumously well i mean precisely and the it's it's gonna be go beyond just
[42:25.040 --> 42:30.040]  you know supporting these rebels by the looks of it because once it collapses
[42:30.040 --> 42:34.360]  into anarchy and tribal warfare which is what everybody expects it to do
[42:34.360 --> 42:39.600]  especially with these 10 to 15 thousand united arab Emirates troops that they're
[42:39.600 --> 42:44.080]  planning on sending in after the the british government today admitted that
[42:44.080 --> 42:49.200]  they have troops on the standby for basically an occupation they're not
[42:49.200 --> 42:52.920]  going to call it an occupation they're going to call it a peacekeeping force
[42:52.920 --> 42:58.400]  got 12 thousand exactly a peacekeeping kinetic loving action they've got at
[42:58.400 --> 43:02.680]  least 12,000 us marines off the coast right now they've got british troops
[43:02.680 --> 43:07.600]  off the coast i'm sure they're just there to sightsee though paul well
[43:07.600 --> 43:13.680]  precisely even though the the original e you intervention plan said that you know
[43:13.680 --> 43:17.720]  that their mission was to quote secure sea and land corridors inside the
[43:17.720 --> 43:22.080]  country that doesn't sound like a humanitarian objective to me it sounds
[43:22.080 --> 43:26.320]  like a military objective what are you going to tell me that we've been lied
[43:26.320 --> 43:30.720]  to that the four and a half month bombing campaign is not humanitarian that
[43:30.720 --> 43:35.960]  obama said weeks i mean days not weeks clearly he's been truthful there i mean
[43:35.960 --> 43:40.520]  next year are you against al-qaeda because they admit the main force is
[43:40.520 --> 43:46.440]  al-qaeda and brags of killing us troops i mean why don't what's wrong with you
[43:46.440 --> 43:52.920]  paul i mean what's wrong with al-qaeda well i mean certainly nothing if you if
[43:52.920 --> 43:59.520]  you're mi6 i mean the same group the libyan al-qaeda sell the mi6 paid a
[43:59.520 --> 44:05.360]  hundred thousand dollars in 1996 to assassinate gadafi after gadafi himself
[44:05.360 --> 44:09.560]  have put out an interpol arrest warrant against bin laden oh we can't allow that
[44:09.560 --> 44:14.360]  so they paid a they paid this islamic fighting group which is going to become
[44:14.360 --> 44:18.920]  one of the main power players in the polls gadafi regime a hundred thousand
[44:18.920 --> 44:25.760]  dollars to assassinate gadafi that's mi6 so i mean the fight that we've got
[44:25.760 --> 44:30.200]  troops in afghanistan in iraq fighting this multi-generational war on terror
[44:30.200 --> 44:35.640]  while simultaneously training arming and funding this al-qaeda group that
[44:35.640 --> 44:41.080]  admittedly has killed us troops to take power in libya post gadafi just
[44:41.080 --> 44:46.600]  illustrates how the whole war on terror is a monumental fraud well once the
[44:46.600 --> 44:49.800]  al-qaeda forces and they admit that's the dominant group of the new government
[44:49.800 --> 44:53.480]  have that country they're undoubtedly going to use it as a base just like
[44:53.480 --> 44:57.960]  after afghanistan was turned over to al-ciyeda they were then used to be the
[44:57.960 --> 45:03.640]  scapegoats for 9-11 as a new pretext and they just move al-qaeda around anywhere
[45:03.640 --> 45:07.320]  they want to invade they either have al-qaeda attack you and then the west
[45:07.320 --> 45:13.080]  comes into their aid serbia now libya afghanistan or they claim al-qaeda has
[45:13.080 --> 45:17.080]  carried out attacks that they didn't really carry out as a pretext to have
[45:17.080 --> 45:21.400]  the security services set up a police state domestically this is incredibly
[45:21.400 --> 45:25.880]  transparent but the fact that british special forces and others are running
[45:25.880 --> 45:31.880]  the attack in tribo lee is true evidence of how we've been lied to all along
[45:31.880 --> 45:38.120]  here and the fact that his son saif al islam has been proven to be alive and
[45:38.120 --> 45:43.080]  not captured really illustrates that this is a fluid situation thank you so
[45:43.080 --> 45:47.160]  much paul joseph watson from prisonplanet.com thanks elix all right
[45:47.160 --> 45:51.800]  there goes paul watson now for the next segment or two we're joined by webster
[45:51.800 --> 45:57.320]  griffin tarpley who spent several weeks going back about four weeks ago inside
[45:57.320 --> 46:02.360]  tripley under bombardment and he knows the journalists harima saun and others
[46:02.360 --> 46:05.880]  that are there some of them have been actually wounded and he's been in
[46:05.880 --> 46:12.040]  contact with those folks as much as he can be but webster tarpley yesterday you
[46:12.040 --> 46:16.600]  said there was reports of counter attacks in journalists you were talking to said
[46:16.600 --> 46:22.680]  what they saw on the streets was libyan forces clashing and crushing the
[46:22.680 --> 46:27.080]  rebels but that there were what appeared to be special forces sniping
[46:27.080 --> 46:31.640]  western reporters and others so this looks like a classic special forces op
[46:31.640 --> 46:34.680]  where they're just showing total bedlam within the city
[46:34.680 --> 46:39.560]  announcing they've taken it as a pretext to recognize it as the government
[46:39.560 --> 46:45.640]  who then will then call in the official flotilla uh the landing craft that are
[46:45.640 --> 46:50.520]  waiting offshore with nato mercenaries that's that's a very plausible scenario
[46:50.520 --> 46:55.080]  alex let me just point out the the shock of the appearance of saif el
[46:55.080 --> 47:00.760]  uh el islam qaddafi that means saif means shield so he's the shield of islam
[47:00.760 --> 47:04.600]  this is uh qaddafi's principal son he's probably the
[47:04.600 --> 47:08.600]  the likely uh political successor to qaddafi you remember that all day
[47:08.600 --> 47:12.680]  yesterday we had been told that first one then two then three of qaddafi's sons
[47:12.680 --> 47:17.720]  had been captured by these al-qaeda terrorists and that already the
[47:17.720 --> 47:22.280]  international criminal court with the scoundrel ocampo were demanding their
[47:22.280 --> 47:25.160]  expedition and all this stuff this was all complete
[47:25.160 --> 47:29.880]  psychological warfare so last night uh in the middle of the night at this rick
[47:29.880 --> 47:33.160]  sose hotel which is the base of the international press
[47:33.160 --> 47:37.480]  saif el islam qaddafi shows up he says i was never captured
[47:37.480 --> 47:42.600]  i'm here i'm on a tour of our uh fighting fronts here we're going to go all
[47:42.600 --> 47:46.280]  around triply he took some journalists with him i don't know
[47:46.280 --> 47:50.840]  what the reports are after that this was an absolute shock you could you could
[47:50.840 --> 47:54.440]  tune to al jazeera and see these people gasping
[47:54.440 --> 47:58.520]  they had egg all over their faces and what it exposes
[47:58.520 --> 48:03.000]  is the big lie and we're also what saif el islam qaddafi said
[48:03.000 --> 48:07.080]  that this is a uh an information war this is
[48:07.080 --> 48:12.120]  electronic information warfare it's info wars as you have known for all these
[48:12.120 --> 48:15.720]  years uh it's an information war and it's done through
[48:15.720 --> 48:18.600]  manipulation and you said nato cut off our own
[48:18.600 --> 48:23.160]  libyan television they were sending these text messages to people all over
[48:23.160 --> 48:27.720]  libya saying that qaddafi was finished and the rebels were now on the march
[48:27.720 --> 48:31.400]  and then you see what they had it's a basically a rabble
[48:31.400 --> 48:36.120]  a screening force of terrorists and and young dupes right young
[48:36.120 --> 48:39.240]  romantics camp followers who come along with them
[48:39.240 --> 48:43.400]  they got that into the city through these nato landing craft
[48:43.400 --> 48:47.800]  and they've created mayhem but everything you see from here
[48:47.800 --> 48:51.160]  is a big lie and people have got to bear this in mind
[48:51.160 --> 48:55.080]  it's all fake you don't know what's going on
[48:55.080 --> 48:58.280]  uh first they said they had 90 percent of the city
[48:58.280 --> 49:01.320]  now they say they had 80 percent of the city yesterday
[49:01.320 --> 49:04.680]  and now they say within 72 hours they'll have the city
[49:04.680 --> 49:08.200]  and now they're saying they've taken qaddafi's compound now they're saying
[49:08.200 --> 49:11.800]  that might not be true and it's confirmed that they've got a whole
[49:11.800 --> 49:15.720]  bunch of different western and arab special forces in there
[49:15.720 --> 49:19.880]  just running around trying to kill whoever they can
[49:19.880 --> 49:24.360]  i mean this is a serious war crime webster yeah i guess you can call it
[49:24.360 --> 49:28.040]  swarming i mean we became familiar with this term swarming
[49:28.040 --> 49:33.160]  uh thanks to the work of uh of the of the albert einstein institute there in
[49:33.160 --> 49:37.960]  uh in boston right swarming adolescents can be used as a
[49:37.960 --> 49:41.720]  as a tactic and that's what you're saying these are swarming adolescents
[49:41.720 --> 49:46.120]  except they all they also have uh machine guns uh remember
[49:46.120 --> 49:51.720]  it's impossible for the qaddafi forces to hold any fixed position because of the
[49:51.720 --> 49:55.560]  nato bombing the nato carpet bombing has been extremely intense
[49:55.560 --> 49:58.840]  there are these apache helicopters they're shooting up everything
[49:58.840 --> 50:02.520]  so you don't it's a shell game they've got to continue to move around
[50:02.520 --> 50:09.000]  and then fight uh the al qaeda uh western forces in hit and runs but in
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.920]  webster i'm going to go back to this they are only days now
[50:12.920 --> 50:16.200]  from quote having the official government al qaeda
[50:16.200 --> 50:20.920]  call for the larger nato landing force to come in
[50:20.920 --> 50:25.400]  and that's when you're going to really see the casualties mount because there
[50:25.400 --> 50:28.680]  are going to be a lot of citizens with those millions of firearms that are
[50:28.680 --> 50:31.640]  really going to fight when they see an open foreign occupation
[50:31.640 --> 50:35.160]  and the bloodbath is going to be intense do you agree with that analysis
[50:35.160 --> 50:39.160]  i think that's that's a definite danger we were also told that there's this
[50:39.160 --> 50:43.320]  village there's a fake libyan town that's been built in
[50:43.320 --> 50:47.800]  katar and they can use they can stage a hollywood style massacre
[50:47.800 --> 50:51.800]  in such a place and then say now it's it's enough where qaddafi has
[50:51.800 --> 50:55.960]  has gone too far but i think stay there stay there yeah so so
[50:55.960 --> 50:59.480]  stay there increasing yeah babies and incubators coming up
[50:59.480 --> 51:03.480]  we'll be right back we all know that berkey water purification systems are

[53:55.160 --> 53:59.960]  that's rising prices empty shelves dot com
[54:25.960 --> 54:29.800]  okay webster you've got the floor for this short five minutes segment
[54:29.800 --> 54:33.640]  what about the issue of the west being fully committed
[54:33.640 --> 54:37.320]  uh obama is announcing that we've had a victory in libya even though it's
[54:37.320 --> 54:40.440]  clearly not a victory either way you slice it
[54:40.440 --> 54:44.440]  and things are still ongoing mccain says it's all over even though it's not
[54:44.440 --> 54:49.160]  clearly a giant psi op and now there's going to be a civil
[54:49.160 --> 54:52.360]  war there it's going to take massive occupation as you
[54:52.360 --> 54:56.520]  know historically libya they do not like being occupied
[54:56.520 --> 55:03.560]  and so break down where you see this going well the um
[55:03.560 --> 55:08.600]  the first thing to say is this is a an exercise in mass brainwashing this is
[55:08.600 --> 55:13.720]  an attempt to brainwash world public opinion on the basis of fake dispatches
[55:13.720 --> 55:19.320]  from the bbc algezera and cnn and uh they have
[55:19.320 --> 55:24.120]  essentially manufactured these stories about the three sons of gitafi being
[55:24.120 --> 55:28.280]  captured as a means to try to convince the gitafi supporters that their world
[55:28.280 --> 55:31.000]  is coming to an end i mean if you go back to the obama
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.800]  campaign you can find similar psi war uh operations that have that have
[55:35.800 --> 55:39.160]  been uh been done so the the first and most important thing is
[55:39.160 --> 55:42.280]  don't fall into the trap of believing their story
[55:42.280 --> 55:45.720]  uh their story is largely manufactured they've sent this
[55:45.720 --> 55:49.560]  uh gang of rabble these armed terrorists
[55:49.560 --> 55:54.120]  the death squads into triply they've supplemented that by landing some of
[55:54.120 --> 55:57.640]  them some of them in from the sea they're creating mayhem
[55:57.640 --> 56:02.440]  but the this is a kind of it's the military term i guess is a kudama
[56:02.440 --> 56:08.360]  it's a uh a quick action that's designed to stun and shock and to paralyze
[56:08.360 --> 56:12.280]  resistance but the problem is if that doesn't work 100 percent
[56:12.280 --> 56:16.680]  in the first moments then a counterattack can be organized and i think
[56:16.680 --> 56:21.240]  that's what we're seeing uh i would for students of the american civil war
[56:21.240 --> 56:25.720]  if you remember the battle of cedar creek in october 1864 out here in the
[56:25.720 --> 56:30.920]  shanendoa valley earliest confederates were successful with a surprise
[56:30.920 --> 56:34.760]  attack on charitans union forces and they
[56:34.760 --> 56:39.000]  drove the union guys from the field there was a route of the union
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.720]  uh except then earliest confederates were so hungry that they stopped and
[56:43.720 --> 56:46.840]  started to loot the camp and i think you're seeing that here
[56:46.840 --> 56:51.000]  these al-qaeda characters coming into to triply they say this is richer
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.040]  than anything we've ever seen we're going to stop here and lose
[56:54.040 --> 56:57.720]  and i think that's the sociological thing that's going on then however
[56:57.720 --> 57:01.560]  sherman comes sherryton comes riding back on his horse
[57:01.560 --> 57:05.880]  and he rallies everybody and they counterattack and i think you can compare
[57:05.880 --> 57:09.880]  saith elislam get off he appearing at the rickshaw's hotel last night
[57:09.880 --> 57:14.360]  that's the defiant rallying figure that you need to get your forces going again
[57:14.360 --> 57:18.120]  and i think that's what you're seeing that's now about what 10 or 12 hours in
[57:18.120 --> 57:21.880]  the past um don't expect to get off the forces
[57:21.880 --> 57:25.720]  to to hold any fixed positions because they can't because of the nato
[57:25.720 --> 57:30.360]  bombing i would like to know how many rebels have been killed i think in the
[57:30.360 --> 57:34.280]  course of the advance on triply the rebels had
[57:34.280 --> 57:38.280]  very heavy casualties and they are not uh... you know without
[57:38.280 --> 57:42.680]  uh... problems of manpower so i think that's something you don't hear about
[57:42.680 --> 57:46.680]  how many rebels have have paid uh... with their lives for all of this
[57:46.680 --> 57:50.360]  television stuff think about other examples in history of
[57:50.360 --> 57:54.360]  of we're taking the capital of the of the supposed enemy
[57:54.360 --> 57:58.280]  turned out not to be what you wanted to do i guess the most famous napoleon
[57:58.280 --> 58:02.680]  was allowed to take moscow and then he found that moscow was a trap
[58:02.680 --> 58:07.320]  maybe these terrorists have taken triply to some extent and now they're finding
[58:07.320 --> 58:11.480]  that what they took was uh was a trap there's also the whole question of
[58:11.480 --> 58:14.360]  libya's huge country it goes you know several
[58:14.360 --> 58:18.760]  thousand kilometers south and uh this whole province of tezan
[58:18.760 --> 58:22.920]  where the population is largely black they are not going to accept the yoke
[58:22.920 --> 58:27.480]  of uh of of ben gazi and and those races well that's because that particular
[58:27.480 --> 58:30.360]  arab group literally kills blacks on site
[58:30.360 --> 58:34.280]  and so now this is obama's little gift to africa is going to be an attempted
[58:34.280 --> 58:37.960]  black genocide left her group entirely thank you thank you so much
[58:37.960 --> 58:44.120]  i'm alex jones stay with us

[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:24.680]  austin texas alex jones all right historian and of course
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:28.440]  economist wefster tarpley who was just in libya
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.960]  i don't know almost two weeks or longer he was just there a little over a month
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.880]  ago during bombing campaigns he was just telling me during the break
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:40.440]  natra was taken triply like napoleon took moscow
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:46.760]  or hitler took uh lennon grip and uh that's exactly what's going on here
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:51.000]  and regardless we've now entered a new vietnam
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.640]  and i guess they're not going to care because we're going to try to use mainly
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:57.080]  arab trips in there uh but we know we're not getting the official
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.840]  story so so how do you see this ending uh because
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:05.160]  you know the media is saying what's next in libya key to us politics
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.400]  ap is still going with the fact that the war is over
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:14.920]  others are saying look out this is a civil war uh what who was behind this we
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.560]  know the bankers want the 144 tons of gold and they
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.240]  want the infrastructure webster but but i mean how do this is going to be a
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.920]  nightmare situation well remember there's a secret
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.840]  treaty signed between the british and the french on november
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:34.760]  second of last year and that set up the overall attack on libya operation
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.600]  south mistral which is also known as operation
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:43.960]  harmaton and harmaton is uh another word for that same wind right that
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:48.760]  Mediterranean wind called the mistral so uh this was cynically planned well in
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.040]  advance they were doing bombing drills and and and everything else for what
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.800]  we're seeing right now they launched the al-qaeda forces
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.320]  they're called protesters and the rest is history
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:04.040]  correct and and remember that there are there are vast areas of southern libya
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.680]  where the writ of nato will not run especially that pezzan province the
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:13.720]  whole southwestern part of libya is this uh pezzan
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.320]  where most everybody is black they're libyans they're arabs
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.680]  but they're black so they're not going to listen to the yoke they're not going
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:24.120]  to subject themselves to the yoke of this Benghazi racist
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:28.440]  lynch council that we've that we've seen the other question is you've got
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:33.880]  these these countries chad and uh as southern algeria but
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:38.200]  especially chad and a couple of others south africa won't turn its back on
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.360]  qaddafi because he's been helping the region
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:44.600]  well the loyalties of some of these people are are not what you'd like it
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:48.120]  to be but but still there there is a large area there
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:53.480]  a government in exile or something like that could go on for a very long time
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:57.400]  and again it's it's going to come down now to a series of
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:01.160]  tribal vendettas but on the other hand i don't i don't think we should get that
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.200]  far ahead right now qaddafi is in the field
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:09.000]  he's defiant he's fighting his son saif is leading attacks
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.280]  his other son kamis was leading a tank attack on
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:15.800]  on the green square yesterday which seems to have succeeded at least for a
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:20.120]  while so i think you got to get used to a period of prolonged
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:27.080]  continuous warfare with constant false news reports constant let's not
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:31.480]  forget that the rebels took a bunch of cities and qaddafi took them back
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:35.800]  but here's the deal they've committed western special forces that's confirmed
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:39.720]  one in telegraph you name it they've committed them into triply now
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.560]  webster i think you're going to see within
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.120]  two or three days i think you're going to see more
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.640]  more western forces going in and they can't now
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.080]  be defeated by qaddafi with all their bluster i think you're going to see a
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:57.240]  full-on invasion and they're just committing to an absolute full-on
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:01.080]  civil war shooting gallery and a lot of dead
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.600]  western and other arab troops this is this is a humanitarian
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:09.640]  disaster of giant proportions it's a definite it's a definite
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:13.160]  possibility but of course that then leads to prolonged
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.480]  guerrilla warfare extravagant casualties rivers of blood
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:21.320]  right now it would be good for russia and china or somebody
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.160]  with some with some conscience to go into the u n security council
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.520]  and immediately demand a ceasefire to put an end to this
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:34.200]  all foreign forces out of libya only got 20 seconds what why isn't russia
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:39.400]  saying something about this well russia is now in the in the throwers of a
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.760]  i guess you could call it a succession or the political
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:46.200]  struggle i think between these medvedev people
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.560]  and the putin people and uh they're also the russians are not not they've
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:54.600]  drawn the line i think for syria they haven't done so for libya
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.240]  all right webster thank you we're out of time we're going to come back with another

[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.480]  mercenary population that rules over the rest of us

[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:21.080]  via video skype from what houston texas and harley
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:24.840]  thank you for coming on with us uh so much of what i saw you writing about
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:28.440]  15 years ago 16 years ago when i first became aware of your
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.800]  research uh was a bit skeptical at the time but
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:36.920]  most of it has now come to pass uh and so i'd like you to give us your world
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.840]  view in a historical perspective and where the world is
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:45.000]  at this point thank you for joining us it's my pleasure alex good to be with
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.520]  you you bet i think the the place to start is that the
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:51.640]  the system is melting down it's it's disappearing
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:56.600]  the attempt to bail it out is at best going to lead to a hyperinflationary
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:01.240]  implosion but if they don't bail it out there's going to be a full-scale
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:05.880]  bankruptcy uh starting with one big bank or another
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:09.560]  the banks have frozen up again we're a little bit like
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:13.160]  what jim liman laroush saw in july 2007
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:17.240]  when he said the banking system is frozen up and is it just finished
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:20.200]  it took about a year before that was generally
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.360]  realized and then in the september 2008 period with the fall of liman and
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:28.440]  others it became clear that the banks had completely frozen
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.560]  which meant they couldn't loan to each other because they knew they were
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:37.400]  loaning based on worthless assets at that point in september 2008
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.120]  we had what was called tarp and it was really
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:43.400]  hammered through the congress under threat that the whole system was going
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.000]  to collapse if we didn't do it now in effect they bought a little
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.160]  time but we've created anywhere from 16 trillion
[01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.240]  to 25 trillion dollars in worthless paper
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:01.560]  which is backing up worthless assets and as you know there's probably
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:06.200]  three percent more trillion
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:11.240]  dollar okay uh harley uh you're you're
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:15.240]  harley your video skype is breaking up if it doesn't clear up in a moment we're
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:19.480]  going to call your right back on the phone uh backup uh
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:23.000]  hasn't skype cleared back up yet
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.480]  okay harley uh the last 30 seconds of what you said was uh breaking up
[01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:33.000]  please repeat it sure we we we had created by bernanke
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.400]  geithner and first hank paulson and then under obama
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:42.600]  uh trillions of dollars to back up worthless financial assets
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:45.880]  those assets should have been cleared out of the banks we should have had a
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:49.720]  bankruptcy reorganization in september 2008
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.600]  and a return to glass stevell regulations instead the decision was made
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:59.800]  to bail out the bankrupt banking system and we see this happening now in europe
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:03.480]  where all of the banks are getting money from the u.s federal reserve
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:08.200]  which is i'm sure an impeachable offense by president obama
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:12.360]  the system itself is melting down the attempt to bail it out is not going to
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:15.720]  work and the only remedy we have is to go back to
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:19.080]  constitutional credit policies starting with
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.920]  glass stevell but the the real the other point alexis
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:27.000]  we've got to get rid of obama we can't wait till january 2013
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.680]  he's committed so many violations and offenses and
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:35.480]  and impeachable offenses that the question is
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:40.680]  will there be anybody with the guts in the us to stand up in the congress or in
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:44.920]  the administration and remove it well harley that was my next question
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:49.640]  it's clear that the ruling class is is in a crisis that they're consolidating
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.760]  power through this implosion that they've engineered
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:56.520]  but at the same time the the black hole they've created
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:00.360]  is threatening to swallow them up as well
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:05.160]  and we see things really getting scary i mean
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:10.360]  basically obama has become a dictator the the office is being used
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:14.760]  by the bureaucracy and the special interest it's being empowered for the
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:17.080]  dictatorship i'm not saying he's a dictator
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:20.600]  himself he's obviously an empty suit teleprompter reader
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:24.520]  but launching wars without congressional approval gun control laws without
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.400]  congressional approval carbon taxes without congressional
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:30.600]  approval amnesty without congressional approval i mean
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:34.600]  they're uh they're openly saying they now have the super congress
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:39.080]  do you agree that there's a move towards an end of the constitutional form of
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:41.960]  government i think it's going to happen very quickly
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:45.400]  they they use the debt ceiling debate to create
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:49.800]  enabling legislation for a financial dictatorship
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:54.520]  in a sense what bernanke is doing is an example of a dictatorship
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:59.000]  no elected official has any say over what the fed is doing
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.400]  and it's rumored that bernanke on friday is going to come up with a qe3
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.760]  quantitative ease in three in effect he's already doing that through the
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:09.880]  back door with these dollar swap arrangements
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.960]  where i mean alex i i think this is important trillions of dollars
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.200]  is going from the federal reserve to bail out bnp padiba
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:22.360]  societe generale of france royal bank of stock when they got
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:27.240]  85 uh billion dollars in just one bailout fund
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:33.080]  so this is is already going on and the enabling legislation larouche has
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:37.560]  compared this to what hitler did in early 1933
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:42.120]  when they used the right shdog fire as an excuse for dictatorship
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:46.280]  now we're seeing something like that another terrorist act
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:51.400]  more war anything of that sort or perhaps riots in the united states over
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:56.040]  the hopelessness around unemployment and the fascist austerity measures
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:59.800]  that will be rammed through by a super congress dictatorship
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:04.280]  you could see an excuse for that kind of police state crackdown
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:08.600]  with a lot of the measures already in place for it and by the way you're not
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:12.840]  just saying that this council of 13 with the president
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:17.160]  heading up to super congress is a financial dictatorship they admit
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:20.360]  that the bills will now originate out of this group
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:24.440]  and if the full house or senate doesn't vote it up or down a simple
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:28.520]  51 vote then whatever the council has already put in place
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:32.920]  becomes law this is so authoritarian it is beyond
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:39.400]  textbook it is so naked and brazen and it it's happening on every front
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:43.880]  but our republics not dying with a bang it's happening
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:46.600]  with a whimper and if they're getting away with this
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:50.280]  what do you expect looking into your historical crystal ball
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:54.440]  that they're going to try next i mean if they're getting away with this
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:59.240]  well i i think the the the thing you have to realize is this is super unconstitutional
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:03.000]  the so-called super congress and the real question
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:07.240]  is the challenge to the american people are there enough people out there with
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:10.040]  guts who will stand up and fight this
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:13.800]  and we're seeing elements of this starting to emerge we're seeing it
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:18.440]  in the african-american population with the famous video of maxine waters
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:22.120]  although i don't know why you have to ask permission to negotiate with nero
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.280]  you've got to get rid of them you see it in the hispanic population you see it
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.920]  with progressives you see it with conservatives
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:33.640]  there are very few people who are giving their consent to this government
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:38.280]  but the problem is that the elected officials in the u.s congress and the
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:41.560]  house and the senate in state legislatures all over the
[01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:46.680]  country have been willing to cut and kill for the sake
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:49.720]  of the bailout and the real issue i think we've
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:54.040]  got to face is either we stop the bailout with blast eagle
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.640]  and get over on the harley stay there let's let's look at where the economy
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:02.760]  is going on its current course versus some of the solutions

[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:46.920]  harley schlanger historian researcher uh is our guest via video connection
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.520]  all right harley continuing where are we going
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:55.160]  if they don't bring back last eagle if they don't write off the trillions
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:58.600]  and trillions and fraudulent international derivatives that we've
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.720]  been signed on to i mean they admit that most of our debt is not
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.960]  our debt we've been signed on to the bankers
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:08.040]  ponzi scheme instead they're saying cut all the entitlements but i've seen the
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:11.320]  numbers even if you cut all the entitlements took all the
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:14.520]  quote wealthy people's money who are in the us
[01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:18.200]  it it it wouldn't pay off a fraction of the fraudulent debt
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:22.920]  so it's a lie to say cut cut cut and that that will get us back solvent
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.880]  just like it's a lie saying giving trillions to banks
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:29.640]  three years ago and now again well we'll get us going
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:34.440]  well let me give you an example the greek government has followed an austerity regime
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:39.880]  and its gdp continues to shrink when you cut into the real economy the only way
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:44.600]  to get out of this crisis is you have to separate the illegitimate debt which is
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:49.160]  the vast majority of the debt from the real obligations of banks that's what
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:52.840]  glass steagle does the real obligations being deposits checking
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:56.280]  accounts business accounts and so on you have to protect those
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:02.360]  but you don't protect the worthless financial instruments that were created
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:06.200]  beginning with mortgage-backed securities collateralized debt obligations credit
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:10.200]  default swaps and so on now just to give you an example of the actual
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:14.040]  corruption which is playing into this there was a story in the new york
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:17.160]  times which which was like a bad mafia movie
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:20.440]  two administration officials sean donovan of hud
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:23.240]  and catherine wild of the new york federal reserve
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:26.360]  went up at a funeral of former governor hugh carry
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.560]  to eric schneiderman who's a new york state attorney general
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:34.120]  schneiderman said he's not going to give bank of america a sweetheart deal
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:37.800]  to get out of the corruption of all the mortgage-backed securities which they
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:41.960]  sold which they knew were fraudulent they went to him and told him
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:45.560]  he's got a layoff wall street the administration
[01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:48.440]  obama acting through these two surrogates
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:51.800]  tried to deliver a message to the attorney general of new york
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:56.440]  that you will not go after the bank of america and wild actually said
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:01.800]  wall street is our main street now that's how the people who are running this
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:06.040]  country running obama actually think about it forget main street
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:11.400]  they're going to defend wall street now part of the if there is a strategy and
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:15.400]  larouche says look these guys are crazy they their main strategies
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:19.320]  genocide destroy the nation state and kill the population
[01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:24.600]  but if there is a strategy they actually think that if they hyper inflate
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:27.960]  the banks can pay off some of this debt with cheap money
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:31.640]  but what that will mean is that will wipe out what's left of
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:36.600]  anybody's savings and pensions in a weimar style hyperinflation
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:41.080]  which is what bernanke and geithner and obama are going towards
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:44.760]  once that done is done the dollar is worthless
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:48.680]  and so if we don't get glass steel and if we don't get back to the protection
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:52.360]  of our constitution we have nothing the people in this
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:56.680]  country will have lost everything including our ability to fight
[01:27:56.680 --> 01:28:01.400]  now harley harley i want you to continue along that line but when you say
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.160]  they want a debt economy they want to reduce population
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:09.560]  i want to get into the globalist mindset from your research when we come back
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:13.160]  you're not just saying that they have created a cosmology
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:21.720]  a post-industrial one-shot policy to to basically rationalize
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:29.160]  their command and control demolition economy this is a corporate takeover of
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.640]  anything standing this is like a corporate
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:36.600]  borg where everything independent must be destroyed to them it is a domination
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:40.600]  of everything this is the paper economy waging war
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:47.400]  against reality it's the empire killing off the nation state
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:51.240]  absolutely so start getting into their their mindset
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:54.760]  all right well and and they say it we're not making this up i mean prince
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:58.520]  philip who many people think is a doddering old fool which he is
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:03.480]  but he's an old noxie the bush family the harrowman family some of these
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:06.520]  leading families of great britain who run these
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:10.840]  international banking cartels they help put hitler in power
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:14.600]  this is not something that's made up this is historical fact
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.880]  they believe that there are too many people on the planet
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:21.320]  they promote these fraudulent scientists who come out and talk about the
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:24.600]  carrying capacity uh they talk about the second law of
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:28.360]  thermodynamics that we cannot expand production to
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:32.680]  take care of a growing population and meanwhile they impose policies
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:36.760]  that are leading to starvation unnecessary starvation harley slanger stay
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:40.120]  there let's finish up with that when we come back get more into where
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:44.040]  the economy is going uh in your trend forecasting

[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:30.600]  one-child policy in china they believe in a economy that destroys
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:36.040]  that feeds that for somebody to win somebody's got to lose
[01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:39.560]  and this is the economy they're selling with the death panels
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.160]  which they now admit are real and bill gates says kill granny

[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:28.120]  researcher author harley schlinger joining us
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:32.280]  via video connection from houston harley
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:35.880]  i was asking you to get into the social Darwinistic
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:41.880]  malthusians that run things and where their program is going to lead us and
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:46.760]  what you are forecasting is going to happen not just in the u.s but worldwide
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:52.040]  in the next year to two years uh if things are not reversed
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:56.760]  well linden larouche has a five decade record of forecasting and
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:00.280]  many many years ago with the launching of the
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.600]  uh environmentalist movement on college campuses during the vietnam war
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:08.200]  it became clear that there was an attempt to
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:12.840]  limit and destroy populations let me just cite two examples of this that are
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:16.040]  official government policy one was a national security
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:20.120]  study memo 200 which was adopted by henry kissinger
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:24.360]  which said that population threat in the developing sector is the greatest
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.200]  threat to u.s security and the u.s should use any means at its
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:33.880]  disposal including food as a weapon to reduce populations in developing
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:37.800]  sector then under carter we had global 2000
[01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:41.800]  which essentially said u.s overproduction u.s technology
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:45.640]  u.s science is a problem because it engenders
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:49.880]  cultural optimism and cultural optimism will lead to more people
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:53.400]  it will lead to new scientific discoveries and will use up the resources
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:56.600]  the planet and therefore we have to stop development
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:00.200]  now that's what's behind the deindustrialization policy
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:06.520]  we see on economics they've created a global economic policy of a
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:11.320]  a rule by cartels the empire is really a series of interlocking cartels in
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:16.200]  finance insurance pharmaceuticals oil raw materials and so on
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:20.360]  who are there to prey upon populations to wipe out
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.200]  whole sectors of the human race some of these people are on record like you
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:27.000]  mentioned morris strong i've heard you mentioned in before
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.760]  they're on record of saying we the world is overpopulated when there's more than
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:34.440]  one billion people so what do you do with six billion
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.600]  well we're about to see with the hyperinflation and with the weather
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:42.440]  problems around the world we're going to see food shortages
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:46.680]  that will take millions hundreds of millions of lives
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:50.760]  in populations that are weakened for lack of food and medication
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:55.160]  basically bodies become petri dishes for the spawning of new diseases
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:58.760]  and this is why larusia saying we face a dark age
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:02.280]  which if we don't get rid of obama and if we don't get back to our
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:06.920]  constitutional economic principles we will be in a dark age and i'm not
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:11.160]  talking 50 hundred years from now i'm talking months from now because we
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:15.560]  could have an implosion of the entire global financial system
[01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:19.080]  even before september well that's what can turn our situation is in
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:22.440]  is i mean to interrupt just to back you up
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:26.120]  that's what ted turner that's what the you know that's fine uh uh
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:30.280]  that's what all of them say that it's good to be post industrial they're
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:34.120]  selling this is a good thing you got a whole foods
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:38.840]  but many of the magazines for the trendies are how great austerity is
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:43.240]  how great it is for things to fall apart how wonderful
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:46.840]  uh all of this is i mean this is such a sickening plan to
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:49.800]  to boil it down and then i want you to continue with the collapse they're
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:54.120]  designing these are ponzi scheme operators that have
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:57.720]  created over a thousand trillion in fake derivatives
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:01.240]  they have bought the world up through fraud
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:05.480]  they're artificially depressing the economy to bankrupt people
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:08.760]  so that uh folks will not be upwardly mobile
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:13.320]  i mean this is this is a corporate genocide if you go back
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:17.240]  to ancient cultures they would go in and wipe out the nearby tribe
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:21.400]  the corporatists have said yeah we've stolen the world through fraud
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:25.400]  and through insider crony capitalism the opposite of free market
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:31.320]  we are now going to sell a religion of self loathing and hating
[01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:37.240]  to turn people's own uh survival instinct against itself
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:40.920]  i mean this is so diabolical and it's the british
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:45.080]  malthusian eugenics system adopted by the us
[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:48.680]  adopted by hitler being implemented by stealth
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:54.360]  it is so monstrous uh so so so please continue
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:58.760]  well what you said is absolutely right this is the hitler policy
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:04.760]  only now it's global and this is a 1930 style depression except global
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:09.800]  and they've already used up all their bullets they have created so much
[01:41:09.800 --> 01:41:13.960]  uh funny money in the last three years and of course
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:17.640]  it hasn't worked to create jobs it hasn't worked to
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:22.200]  deal with the housing crisis the the new home sales are continuing to fall
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:26.200]  more and more people are not just out of work but we're losing skills we're
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:30.680]  losing whole sections of the human race but the people who believe this
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:35.000]  hate human beings they they think they're entitled
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:41.560]  as an imperial class is entitled to the wealth the sweat of the brow of the
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:45.720]  entire human race and if they're too many humans they've
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:49.320]  got to get rid of them call the herd is the term they use
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:53.320]  so this malthusian policy is exactly what was brought in
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:57.960]  with the breakdown of the breton wood system in 1971 and it's exactly
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:01.720]  what linden larouche was saying in december of 1970
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:06.200]  early 71 now it took a step forward with bush
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:10.120]  following uh 9 11 which larouche had forecast
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:16.440]  was coming as a Reichstag fire excuse it continued with the housing bubble
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:20.600]  it's now at a point where they can't sustain it but we're also seeing an
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:26.120]  explosion of wars of starvation of uh refugee camps where people are
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:29.480]  being hurted to die and we're also seeing in the united
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:33.320]  states alex and this is important this is why obama is is
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:37.240]  such a criminal ask to go it's not that he's responsible for this
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:41.960]  he's the president and he's carrying it out but his policy
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.280]  is going to turn america cities into war zones
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.320]  they're going to be there's already 40 percent 50 percent
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:53.240]  african-american unemployment in major urban centers
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:56.360]  this is just going to get worse if it weren't for the drug economy and the
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:59.800]  black economy that underlies it the underground economy
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:04.520]  you would already have riots and chaos so what we've seen happen in the arab
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:07.080]  spring which actually started i'm not talking
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:10.440]  about the funny business in libya but in tunisia and egypt
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:14.040]  it started because people with college degrees couldn't get jobs
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:17.480]  they couldn't afford to eat it's spread into europe
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:20.760]  in europe they're they're creating a hyperinflationary bubble to put to
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:24.200]  defend the euro which was originally set up precisely
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:27.720]  for this bankers dictatorship and in this country
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:32.280]  we're sitting here as americans angry we're losing hope
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:36.040]  but the only hope that remains is that the american people will take the
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:39.400]  constitutional remedy which is called a credit policy
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:43.480]  which is the american constitutional system which means we have to get rid of
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:46.840]  the federal reserve we have to write down this bad debt
[01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:50.920]  write it off let it sit there instead of having the people
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:54.600]  being saddled with the debt give it back to the bankers
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:58.120]  that's why larouche is saying glass needles not just legislation
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:02.360]  it's a principle of economy and just one other point on this
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:05.560]  but this debt ceiling debate was a complete fraud
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:09.240]  the way you deal with the debt problem is you start producing
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:13.080]  you put people to work you differentiate between credit
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:17.160]  which is for innovative technological development for the future
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:20.600]  versus payment on worthless pieces of paper
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:25.800]  accumulated through a casino gambling process and so we have a very clear
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:30.520]  picture ahead of us and i think the the only question is
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:37.160]  will the american people find the guts to throw obama out
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:41.880]  to cause their congressmen to storm town meetings to
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:45.800]  express their discontent and their anger and not just their anger
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:49.880]  but become thoughtful and actually express their love of humanity
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:54.120]  by saying we're not going to put up with this anymore well harley
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:58.120]  that that obviously is an imperative the the problem is
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:02.840]  get rid of obama uh they're just going to end up putting in a rick perry
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:08.360]  who's bought and paid for by the same interest or somebody like a
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:12.200]  mit romney and if you look at these people
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:16.840]  they know people are starting to wake up to the private federal reserve being
[01:45:16.840 --> 01:45:20.200]  the author of our misery that's why rick perry is now saying hey the
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:24.600]  federal reserves treacherous why almost treasonous
[01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:29.560]  uh and we see congress is approval rating at nine percent we see
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:33.240]  11 percent of the country thinking the government's doing the people's will
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:37.080]  so certainly the public is awake that we're being
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:41.000]  basically robbed and cheated but they're not fully awake
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.560]  to the details so why would i mean obviously i'm for impeaching obama
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:48.440]  right now for the unconstitutional power grabs
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:53.080]  but what about baner what about reed what about this political class
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:58.360]  that has put homeland security in place uh not to fight muslim extremists but
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:01.560]  from day one to suppress the american people
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:05.720]  if we ever tried to get control of our government again
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:08.920]  well alex let me give you an example of something that happened within our
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:12.040]  lifetime 20 21 years ago in europe where the
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:16.440]  dictatorships in eastern europe were overthrown by a popular uprising
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:21.000]  out of leipzig in germany out of the czech republic out of solidarity in
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:25.320]  poland yeah the problem at that time was that we
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:27.960]  had george herbert walker bush in the white house
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:31.320]  and thatcher and miterrand roped bush into a scheme
[01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:36.200]  to suppress the potential of a german reunification
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:40.360]  with the euro policy in the european union now today
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:44.840]  we're actually seeing the whole western world the transatlantic system
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:49.480]  in a breakdown even worse than what happened in the soviet sector
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:53.640]  the american people have been bought off with bread and circuses with topless
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:57.240]  bars and sports and things of that sort for a long time
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:01.480]  but we're beginning to see an awakening now one of the things that larouche is
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:04.280]  doing and i know he's discussed this with you on the program
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:08.440]  is he's working on bringing into the leadership of this country a new
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:12.200]  generation people who don't have a stake in the system
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:15.960]  you know the biggest problem we have is that even many of your listeners
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:20.040]  who agree with you completely they still have a stake in the system
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:22.920]  it's like they're lying in a rotting corpse and they're saying well i still
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:27.080]  have something going on here or someone on the sinking titanic was afraid to
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:30.280]  get on that's how they hold you hostage just to interject
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:33.480]  that's how they hold you hostage they devalue your pensions
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:37.080]  with currency devaluation they start cutting the pensions
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:40.600]  but you still take it because oh you're still getting 25 percent
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:44.200]  it's like well i better stay in the game even though they're stealing most of it
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:46.760]  from me even though down the road they'll steal that
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:52.760]  final little piece absolutely and hyperinflation will wipe it all out
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:56.200]  but what we're looking at now is there a lot of young people
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:59.800]  who don't have that same delusion they don't believe in the system
[01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:03.240]  they don't believe in the baby boomer generation they know the boomers
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:07.480]  where our have this system as their only option
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:10.840]  and so what la ruche has done is put together a slate of six candidates and
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:13.480]  i've been privileged to work with the candidates
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:18.840]  to put forward an alternative the going back to the american system
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:22.440]  not accepting the corruption and the fraud and the lying
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:27.720]  and the killing and actually putting forward a series of proposals
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:31.720]  which are available people can go to la ruche pack.com and see the videos done
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:34.440]  by the young people and i'd also like to give a
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.880]  a toll-free number if people want to call and find out what they can do
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:41.720]  to join us with people who are out to get rid of obama for example
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:46.360]  state senator perry clark of kentucky put out a very strong statement he's a
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:49.720]  democrat calling for the removal of obama tisha
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:54.920]  rogers who i work with in houston won the democratic primary in 2010
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:49:00.440]  in the 22nd district by calling for impeaching obama to save nasa so we've
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:03.880]  got a movement going people can get in touch with us by calling

[01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:15.560]  all right final segment with harley schlinger
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:20.520]  and i've read many of his articles over the years their analysis is excellent
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:23.880]  of the problems i don't know in every case if i totally agree with their
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:28.280]  solutions but in a general capacity it's certainly a lot better than
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:32.040]  the austerity and controlled implosion we're facing
[01:54:32.040 --> 01:54:36.200]  i've seen your writings dealing with the adl i have found the adl who's been
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:40.440]  convicted of course breaking into police departments and stealing files
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:44.440]  no need to do that now they actually run many of the police departments now
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:50.360]  uh from your research uh why have you uh decided to focus in on the adl in the
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:55.160]  past well the adl has been an arm of the empire
[01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:58.600]  and in fact the original the origins of the anti-definition
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:02.520]  league were to defend jewish drug pushers in new york city when the new york
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:06.120]  city police department started going after them and they said oh this is
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:09.480]  anti-semitism in the case of mr larouche
[01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:13.160]  as he started honing in on the international monetary fund
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:16.680]  the whole carter administration commitment to global 2000
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:21.240]  deindustrialization and so on instead of taking his arguments
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:25.960]  and trying to refute them what they said is oh he's running a jewish banker
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:30.200]  theory no banks don't have a religion and in fact
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:33.720]  most of the people who are so-called jewish bankers i think sensible
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:37.720]  judyism to quote yitzhak rabid would spit them out would reject them because
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:41.240]  they have nothing to do with the the teachings of of uh
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:46.440]  moses and judyism but it's used to try and stop the debate
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:50.280]  just as today people won't address the issues
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.800]  on the banking crisis no one will talk about
[01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:58.360]  the trillions of dollars that's been handed to these wall street crooks and
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:01.480]  swindlers well take the adl
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:05.800]  it's the person i mean take the adl they'll defend swartzenegger who
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:08.840]  admittedly is a nazi and tells everybody how much he loves
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:13.560]  hitler and tells rolling stone that and then i never get into racial issues or
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:17.240]  religious issues and they're always trying to imply i'm racist
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:20.680]  i mean i mean it's really a despicable organization
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:24.920]  and i mean take your group i mean it's the opposite of getting into racial
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:29.320]  issues and i know they've attacked you guys i mean it really is a joke
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:34.040]  uh that anybody who stands up for sovereignty is attacked by the adl
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:37.000]  we're gonna have to have you back soon there's been an
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:40.120]  it says headline fox news we'll put it back on screen
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:47.240]  unconfirmed earthquake it's dc uh capital uh being evacuated uh right now
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:50.680]  you can't make this stuff up uh man is is this
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:55.480]  harp at work what's your what's your take on that uh harley
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:59.240]  well i think if you go to our website you'll see that we have a lot of
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:03.080]  material about where the solar system is in the galaxy
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:07.960]  the solar system goes through cycles and changes and every 62 million years or
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:12.040]  so we come into an area of the galaxy where we begin to see very significant
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:18.040]  changes in the earth's electromagnetic uh core in the uh ionosphere
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:21.960]  and what we're seeing with solar flares and things of that sort when a very
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:26.040]  dangerous moment uh for the earth and and mr larush has been
[01:57:26.040 --> 01:57:30.520]  warning about this uh meanwhile obama is cutting the funding
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:34.520]  of scientific research into precisely these kinds of yeah they cut a satellite
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:39.960]  to watch as the sun they cut a satellite to watch as you know
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:43.960]  yeah a number of them and this is the the only way we can develop a capability
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:49.240]  of looking for precursors to protect people so i think again on on this case
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:52.520]  and by the way notice how often obama says well we can't do anything about
[01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:55.000]  earthquakes well maybe we could if we didn't have a

[01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:11.000]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.680]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:17.640]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:21.480]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:24.680]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:28.600]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:40.120]  webscher tarpley's one of them we just called him he did feel and see the
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:42.920]  earthquake so he'll be popping in briefly in
[02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:46.520]  the next segment quote unconfirmed earthquake but
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:49.800]  we've confirmed that buildings were shaking and things were going on
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:54.040]  it made tarpley run to the window and he's in mariland right on the dc border
[02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:58.360]  uh so they're evacuating the capital this just stuff gets weirder by the
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:02.200]  minute uh let's go to wendy in hawaii
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:07.000]  wendy you're on the air go ahead hi alex thank you for taking my call
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:12.120]  um i i hope you didn't talk about this yet because i just tuned in but
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:16.360]  following um rt.com to get the news about libya
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:20.040]  um i was wondering if you were aware of the statement that
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:27.400]  they said that the uh rio rix os hotel was split into
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:33.480]  between the independent journalists and um supposedly cnn journalists who were
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:37.640]  known cia agents well cnn admits that there there's a washington
[02:01:37.640 --> 02:01:40.280]  post article that it's completely pentagon run
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:45.400]  anderson cooper's admittedly cia uh out of college and the i mean pretty much
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:49.240]  the entire crew both blitzers and israeli agent
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:53.960]  um and publicly worked for uh the israeli government and apac
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:59.320]  i mean the whole thing's a joke uh most of our tax money goes to openly fund
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:03.240]  cnn msnbc their government slash foreign
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:06.600]  banking system run these are collaborator media
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:10.360]  uh and uh they give you a fake choice with fox news
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:13.560]  and it's riddled and filled with government operatives that's come out in
[02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:17.800]  england so yes of course uh they've had uh cnn
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:20.760]  reporters and others come right up independent journalists and say
[02:02:20.760 --> 02:02:24.520]  you know what you're dead buddy and then they go outside and you know somebody
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:27.960]  snipers them uh probably hotel journalists going
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:30.520]  over and getting their commando outfit across the street
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:34.920]  most these people are special ops killers and they run america for the banks
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:38.840]  they're hardcore that's why they rule us people aren't playing games
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:42.120]  and they want to start assassinations in america against the media that's why
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:45.560]  they've announced that they'll kill u.s citizens now for national security
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:49.160]  outside of uh courts or jurisdiction or anything else
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:52.920]  ron paul warned about that in the debate two weeks ago i mean this country is
[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:58.120]  run by hardcore foreign bankers so that makes sense that the journalists
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:01.960]  were calling in and telling uh nato where the check
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:05.400]  points were and that's how they made the siege they uh
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:09.000]  called in and had nato bomb the checkpoints and that's how the rebels
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:12.680]  sure sure sure i mean that's the oldest trick in the book
[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:17.400]  to have journalists uh and human rights workers
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:21.640]  i mean it's well known that you go join um the peace corps
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:26.120]  and that it's really just a cia operation and that's the whole deal
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:29.960]  people think it's special to be in the cia it's like being a trash man or
[02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:33.720]  something uh most my family that's been in the army
[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:38.120]  has been approached by the cia to join them and it's not like ooh we got
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:41.080]  approached by the cia it's like you know you're being
[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:45.080]  approached to sell crack on the street corner uh i mean i've had family who
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:49.800]  were army officers who actually took the offer up and
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:52.760]  got into the quote cia training and it was
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:57.160]  dealing drugs and you know orders to kill people in chicago and they said no
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:01.560]  i mean that's who runs america's foreign banks 100 percent
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:05.640]  and they do whatever they want and of course seeing in and then
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:09.800]  msnbc are most of those a lot of those people you see on the news
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:13.160]  you know the ugly anchors those people aren't just spies
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:16.520]  there are a lot more than that i mean these are hardcore people
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:19.800]  who've made their bones in different continents all over the world they're
[02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:23.560]  here to make sure america goes down they're here to make sure that the
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:26.920]  republic and all of the bill of rights is overthrown
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:31.160]  and they are enemies of the republic the cia was set up by
[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:36.200]  uh the private banking families in 1947 and they control the narcotics they
[02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:40.040]  control it all and bringing this country down is their number one goal
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:43.160]  while wrapping themselves in the american flag all day
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:48.200]  all right we'll be right back stay with us on the other side

[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:21.000]  okay the us geological survey we were able to get on their website a few
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.280]  minutes ago it's basically down right now from traffic
[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:29.720]  is confirming a 5.8 earthquake that's a very substantial
[02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:35.560]  hit virginia and shook buildings in dc and
[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:39.560]  webster tarply lives right on the maryland dc border
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:42.680]  uh and so he was able to see it out the window
[02:08:42.680 --> 02:08:46.920]  a frequent info wars contributor he was obviously on for about 15 minutes with
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:52.680]  us in the first hour on the libya globalist induced civil war
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:56.600]  webster can you tell us what you witnessed there in dc
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:01.560]  well again this is uh but this is the the uh rockville to gaithersburg area of
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:05.240]  of maryland so a little bit north of the of the district line
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:09.320]  i would say what 10 or 15 minutes ago i became aware that the windows were
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:12.040]  rattling the windows were shaking and rattling
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:17.240]  and um i first thought i thought that it was something that we have these
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:20.840]  airplanes that sometimes fly very low over the house and sometimes that
[02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:24.600]  manages to shake the windows but then i realized it was rather more serious than
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:27.960]  that my wife was upstairs and apparently the shaking on the
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:32.120]  on the upper floor was much more severe than it was down here
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:36.360]  uh and then this was over i would say in about a minute
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:40.600]  um there is a seismic zone here north of washington uh
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:48.440]  last year actually on uh august 16th we had a 3.6 on the rictor scale
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:52.920]  earthquake here with the epicenter being in gaithersburg and that was also
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:56.040]  about three miles deep well just to be clear though
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:10:00.040]  buildings buildings were were shaken uh in maryland
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:05.160]  so um there's no reports of injuries or anything right now thank god
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:09.400]  but we're all tracking it right now uh but but what do you make
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:13.960]  of people that are saying that the orientation of the sun the sun's
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:18.440]  activity uh is is driving this increased seismic
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:22.120]  activity and the question is if we pay algor money can he
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:27.160]  can he stop it i i don't know whether this can be politicized again we had
[02:10:27.160 --> 02:10:30.760]  a earthquake last year here but the rictor scale is logarithmic so if you
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:35.160]  go from 3.6 to 5.8 that's that's a hundred times
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:39.560]  uh bigger this one seems to have been in central virginia i would say it looks
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:43.480]  like about 30 miles west of richmond so right in the center of
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:47.640]  virginia that means it's 150 miles away from here the local television here
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:51.400]  says that the pentagon was evacuated for a while and maybe
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:56.840]  also other other government offices um earthquakes occur uh and
[02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:00.040]  naturally in a time like this of crisis they're going to be
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:04.040]  politicized and there may be some uh some truth to that
[02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:07.960]  uh naturally it can we can forget about algor
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:11.160]  uh the the recent case that i think we can point to is
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:15.160]  concerning that tsunami in japan there was a widespread
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:18.920]  awareness or there was a wide a widespread belief let me put it this
[02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:23.080]  way that uh this this according to some sources
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:27.080]  that u.s intelligence using this harp system h a
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:31.160]  a r p had somehow manufactured an earthquake
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:35.000]  in the pacific ocean and that this has hit japan and that the political
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.400]  focus of that was to prevent japan from breaking all ties with the u.s and
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:42.840]  entering into a close strategic alliance with china now
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:46.120]  whether this is true or not i simply cannot say i would stay away from that
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:49.560]  question however there was a widespread belief and i i think it's
[02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:52.760]  interesting that uh linda larouche that you've had on there once or
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:56.200]  twice comes on and it says oh no it wasn't the cia
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:59.480]  it was the crab nebula so this is this is going to be
[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:04.200]  it's going to be uh politicized in one direction or another
[02:12:04.200 --> 02:12:08.200]  all right webster well we know that secretary of defense william coan
[02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:12.760]  in the april 27th issue of the army times they reported on a press conference
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:16.200]  and pull the quote up and he said governments are working on have developed
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:19.640]  we know there's treaties with the un blood in the 77
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:23.400]  to not have atmospheric manipulation and tectonic weapons
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:26.760]  so reportedly just like you can hit the side of a metal barn
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:31.080]  with a certain harmonics and it can make the barn shake apart
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:35.800]  uh or just like a a a certain note can be hit by an opera
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:40.200]  singer and it can shatter crystal i've actually seen it done
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:43.560]  one time there was an opera singer at a dinner party in college and they got a
[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:45.960]  glass out and shattered it was it's powerful
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:49.160]  that basically using this atmospheric manipulation
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:52.680]  and that's what the patents from eastman and others say in the 50s
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:57.640]  that they can cause earthquakes on fault lines also found her ritz articles
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:01.400]  where the israelis in the last five years are testing
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:07.560]  uh high explosive charges uh basically they drill and then they pump plastic
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:11.400]  explosive down several thousand feet liquid plastic explosive
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:14.840]  it hardens and they detonate it and they've been causing little earthquakes
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:18.440]  they've been testing so we know seismic weaponry is being tested
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:23.320]  certainly uh but uh we know but along before this stuff existed
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:26.840]  we know that well just 150 years ago or so the mississippi
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:32.360]  changed its course when a very powerful earthquake that knocked down buildings
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:36.760]  uh hit and so we know this happens naturally
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:41.320]  there's three extinct volcanoes in austin uh they built a nuclear
[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:46.920]  plant that no one seems to know about uh up off of uh in in in north austin at
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:51.400]  the jj pickle center it's built directly on the fault line
[02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:55.080]  on the hillside from the uh balcony's fault
[02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:58.360]  it seems like they only build nuclear power plants on fault lines or in tsunami
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:02.200]  zones or both is even better for them uh so i really think it is a
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:06.680]  conspiracy theory to to to say oh well this is the russian saying
[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:10.520]  we've got these toys too because we know there's always been earthquakes
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:15.400]  uh in in the virginia area but if the stuff exists and we do see a massive
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:19.560]  increase in it who knows but uh webster i know you'll keep track of these
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:24.120]  things sometimes a 5.8 is a prelude though to
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:29.160]  something even bigger webster so i i hope you don't get hit by uh you know
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:33.480]  how big was the one that hit uh japan this was in the
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:39.000]  this is the upper eights to the nines i think and they said 9.0 or even 9.1 so
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.240]  you know it's logarithmic so let's hope you don't get hit by that
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:46.600]  um because i mean let's hope godzilla doesn't come out of the sea and attack
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:49.480]  the capital well you know i think what you're saying
[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:53.000]  about the the earthquake the seismic warfare is much more
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.280]  realistic than the crab nebula i'm not that worried about the crab
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:00.680]  nebula but on the other hand this this kind of an event does occur
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:04.440]  from time to time although this this intensity is rare
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:07.640]  by the way i don't want to get a fracas going here because i just have different
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:10.280]  groups on with different perspectives you know i don't agree with all of your
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:13.000]  political views and i certainly don't with larouge
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.080]  but we have had those guys on from time to time you know you are a chip off the
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:19.880]  old block i mean you headed up their whole european division
[02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:23.080]  for a long time but since you bring up linda larouge
[02:15:23.080 --> 02:15:27.080]  and then say we're going through this uh galactic whatever
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:31.640]  i get probably 500 emails a day saying why aren't i talking about
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:36.040]  comet bebel bob or whatever it is supposedly coming near us in october
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:39.800]  there's always every six months some new planet some new
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:42.920]  thing that's going to kill us and i'm always a government agent because i
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:47.080]  don't cover it uh but i mean you know and i'll be
[02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:50.680]  discredited in october when the comet doesn't kill us
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:54.680]  uh and i don't understand how that works there'll be a new asteroid
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:59.960]  or new comet or new kuiper belt body uh after this and i just i'm getting
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:02.120]  really tired of it i'm not saying that there aren't
[02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:06.120]  dangers of asteroids hitting us it's just that to sit there and predict
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:09.960]  because a comet's going between us and the sun that we're all dead or that this
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:12.840]  is what's causing earthquakes i mean it's the sun that's really
[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:15.960]  driving most of this tectonic activity not
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:20.440]  not the uh easter bunny comet i think that's correct i would say the
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:24.040]  following when you see these natural disasters what you
[02:16:24.040 --> 02:16:28.040]  realize is that just in time inventory does not work
[02:16:28.040 --> 02:16:32.360]  a society has got to have reserves it has to have stocks it has to have
[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:35.320]  emergency equipment generally speaking the private
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:39.000]  sector cannot do these things the free market will never do it
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:42.360]  because they don't make profits they're a losing proposition
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:45.480]  on the other hand when the natural disaster occurs
[02:16:45.480 --> 02:16:48.520]  you must have your stocks you must have your reserves
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:52.040]  the one of the one of the things you see with the collapse of civilizations in
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:57.000]  the past is if the society cannot generate a sufficient social surplus
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.840]  to be able to deal with these inevitable things when they happen because they
[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:04.920]  always do that's just the nature of the physical universe the way we see it
[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:07.960]  if you don't have a sufficient social surplus
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:13.000]  to be able to deal with it then the society can collapse and this is
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:16.760]  why this just in time inventory you know everything
[02:17:16.760 --> 02:17:20.440]  calculated down to the last second doesn't work concerning
[02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:24.680]  concerning the globalists admit they want us on this economy
[02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:30.600]  so they control us they're busy putting back giant stocks of weapons medicines
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:33.320]  foods even the big corporations do for themselves
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:37.160]  they teach us it's weird it's bad maybe you should be
[02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:41.960]  SWAT teamed for having reserves while they're hoarding the reserves
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:47.000]  themselves because they want you absolutely dependent on the system
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.440]  yes and i i'm in favor of you know decentralized
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:55.640]  but the government controlled dumps of all kinds of stuff that would be
[02:17:55.640 --> 02:18:00.440]  available in in emergencies but not not for purposes of
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:03.640]  well if you don't have that and there's an emergency then the looting gets out
[02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:07.000]  of hand which is exactly what FEMA likes that's why they ordered the police to
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.120]  stand down in Katrina and didn't bring food for six days and
[02:18:10.120 --> 02:18:13.720]  shot families trying to get out while the cops were looting everything and
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:17.720]  and came and confiscated the firearms well Webster will continue to track the
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:20.840]  latest news there with the earthquake so your house
[02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:23.480]  moved a bit the windows were moving and you say
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:27.160]  i checked the house now i went i went from from top to bottom and there are
[02:18:27.160 --> 02:18:30.440]  no significant cracks in the plaster or anything it was not not anything of that
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:33.320]  intensity because you're far away from but i'm saying you did have movement
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:36.920]  yeah yeah the the the ground where you could feel the ground shaking i said
[02:18:36.920 --> 02:18:41.320]  what kind of an airplane is this this must be a 747 right flying right over
[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:44.920]  the house we're a little little bit away from something called Montgomery Air
[02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:47.720]  Park which i was given the opportunity to say
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:50.200]  things about LaRouche if you want to i mean you can say whatever you want
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:54.840]  Webster again uh the the the general the tendency of
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:58.680]  world public opinion or at least of certain parts of it that sort of the
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:02.520]  anti-establishment currents after that japanese tsunami
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:06.040]  was to begin to examine the question is there this h a
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:12.360]  h a a r p the harp system based in alaska is there seismic warfare
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:16.200]  is the u.s doing this is this something that uh
[02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:21.000]  that was used against japan to to stop them from making a geopolitical move
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.040]  of the first magnitude and you have to take that part seriously
[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:26.520]  because this is exactly what's going on in the world
[02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:30.360]  and at this point when world public opinion is beginning to entertain the
[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:34.680]  possibility that this might have been a some kind of a deliberate operation
[02:19:34.680 --> 02:19:38.040]  again i can't comment on the merits of that on on the
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:40.840]  world public opinion though yeah that was for real
[02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:43.720]  here we have old LaRouche coming forward and saying no
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:48.520]  not the cia not the cia the crab nebula and the 62 million year
[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:52.360]  cycle is responsible stop talking about about the crab nebula now

[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:23.960]  and the intelligence services grandstand and lecture me about patriotism

[02:24:38.440 --> 02:24:42.120]  but it turns out there have been earthquakes all over the country today
[02:24:42.120 --> 02:24:47.400]  and there was one today and another one yesterday in colorado
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:55.480]  of 5.3 now near colorado of course is the biggest volcano in the world
[02:24:55.480 --> 02:24:59.720]  and it's active the entire of yellowstone the entire park
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:05.720]  is its caldera or the the the opening of the volcano and they report that the
[02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:09.320]  last time that exploded they're not sure exactly when it exploded but they've
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:14.040]  done the isotope checking that it blew chunks of rock as far
[02:25:14.040 --> 02:25:18.920]  away as alaska and texas and reportedly it blew more towards the
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:23.000]  the northwest just like mount st helens you know blew another
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.720]  direction the point is they usually explode out one direction
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:30.120]  can you imagine and scientists believe it probably cooled the temperature of the
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:33.400]  earth down many degrees for many years and probably
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:36.760]  created a many ice age we're on a planet spinning through
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:39.640]  space with giant asteroid belts around us
[02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:44.600]  there's all sorts of earth changes going on we've seen comets smash into
[02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:48.680]  gas giants and blow holes in the side of them bigger than the earth
[02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:53.240]  so i know that we get hit by asteroids and comets
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:57.240]  i know it happens a lot more frequently than scientists previously believed
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:26:01.960]  they now admit that and i would be for an international effort
[02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:07.320]  with nations working together to put a weapon system orbiting in a deep orbit
[02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:11.160]  uh if it was all public and not secretive
[02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:14.600]  to defend us from these type of asteroids but that's not going to happen
[02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:17.960]  because you know you can't trust the governments and they'd weaponize it and
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:22.840]  aim it back at the earth um it's just so sad we can't work together
[02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:26.600]  because the globalists are such cutthroats you'd know if they were good
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:29.400]  they wouldn't have one-child policies they wouldn't be trying to destroy the
[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:32.840]  family they wouldn't be spiking the water in the food with poison
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:36.600]  these are bad people and we've got the worst elements
[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:39.880]  running the globe right now and it's disgusting
[02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:44.680]  got a bunch of parasites in control i mean i'll tell you right now ladies and
[02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:47.240]  gentlemen if i was worth hundreds of billions of dollars or trillions like
[02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:50.440]  the Rothschilds i would not be out on giant yachts every
[02:26:50.440 --> 02:26:53.640]  week and huge jets and private trains and 25
[02:26:53.640 --> 02:26:57.000]  palaces i would be trying to help humanity and build
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:00.440]  something because i like seeing other people do well
[02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:04.600]  i like seeing technological development i believe in true progress
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:09.080]  and that's what america was always into until the last 50 years
[02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:12.120]  that's what the renaissance you know 500 years old is about
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:16.520]  that's normal human behavior we've got these sickos in control
[02:27:16.520 --> 02:27:20.760]  who are trying to go back with technology and only dole out specific
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:24.520]  stuff that's used to control us i don't like it
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:28.280]  i know my life's transitory i know my life is very very short
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:33.720]  and i i i am a fan of humanity i want my children to have a future i want
[02:27:33.720 --> 02:27:37.080]  their children to have a future i don't like
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:41.240]  seeing cancer and diabetes explode and iqs drop
[02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:45.960]  and and and people losing their fertility
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:50.920]  and the the system using television to completely dumb people down and then
[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:53.720]  say look there are a bunch of dumb animals let's kill them
[02:27:53.720 --> 02:27:58.760]  i mean that is sick do you globalist engineers think this instinct
[02:27:58.760 --> 02:28:02.040]  to dominate and kill is going to go away once you've gotten rid of most of us
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:05.640]  you're going to keep killing each other if there were two globalists in some
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:09.800]  mountain fortress with all the high tech systems you try to kill each other
[02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:13.880]  i mean it's it's your nature and i've had and i understand the
[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:16.920]  argument well if we're not super evil other people will be and they'll
[02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:19.320]  dominate you know we're being wicked because the
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:23.800]  end justifies the means because we actually are altruistic bull
[02:28:23.800 --> 02:28:28.840]  baloney baloney
[02:28:29.640 --> 02:28:32.920]  you guys go after every country that tries to industrialize
[02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:36.440]  every country that's truly progressive no matter where it is
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:40.120]  every country that tries to build a better world you bring it down and
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:43.320]  you're doing it to my country and i don't like you
[02:28:43.320 --> 02:28:46.920]  and i'm sick of your garbage and i'm sick of you wrapping yourself in the
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:50.120]  american flag and shipping your narcotics in here
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:53.240]  then have it hollywood have all the fancy dandies

[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:02.040]  young people never take drugs it's not cool
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:05.000]  all you're doing is paying money to the banks
[02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:11.800]  do not use drugs ever and decriminalize them it's what losers do

[02:29:29.080 --> 02:29:32.520]  northwest corridor both of these quakes were ultimately determined to have been
[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:36.520]  caused by human activity from explosives and drilling
[02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:40.440]  that's the new york times oh you can't have man-made earthquakes
[02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:44.120]  here they are admitting yeah they're building big underground cities blowing

[02:33:30.040 --> 02:33:34.920]  common ellenin is supposed to come here uh in october
[02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:40.280]  and when nothing happens i will be the discredited one for saying nothing is
[02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:43.560]  going to happen in fact let's put that article on screen
[02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:49.880]  or prisonplanet.tv viewers uh when i see nasa saying that common ellenin
[02:33:49.880 --> 02:33:54.760]  uh poses no october 16th threat to earth
[02:33:54.760 --> 02:33:57.720]  then i start saying well maybe it does pose a threat
[02:33:57.720 --> 02:34:01.720]  but they do say it's going to pass between the earth and the sun
[02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:05.560]  um in fact print me that article because there's different
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:09.320]  there's different reports on how many millions of miles it's going to be
[02:34:09.320 --> 02:34:14.600]  away from the earth but but really folks i found that there's a fascination
[02:34:14.600 --> 02:34:17.720]  with things coming close to the earth and i understand why
[02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:21.800]  we're a spaceship earth out here and there's all sorts of comments and
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:26.280]  asteroids and things out there and i know we do get hit by these things
[02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:30.600]  but come on i mean every couple months there's a new
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:35.640]  asteroid a new comment i'm covering up i'm going to my bunker
[02:34:35.640 --> 02:34:41.480]  i know it's real and i'm i'm lying because i work for the pope or whatever
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:45.000]  or the reptoids and then when it doesn't kill us
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:50.520]  see see it didn't kill us because jones is a liar
[02:34:50.520 --> 02:34:53.720]  listen i don't know if ellenon's going to kill us
[02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:57.720]  but i have a lot of people calling me you know saying hey you think this is a
[02:34:57.720 --> 02:35:00.920]  real threat and i say well
[02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:04.200]  if it was a threat the government's not going to tell us but
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:09.480]  no i i think the biggest threat is that we
[02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:13.240]  get hit by an asteroid sometime when we're not looking for it
[02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:16.440]  and it's got the equivalent even if it's a medium-sized one of say
[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:21.080]  100 high-powered hydrogen bombs and and
[02:35:21.080 --> 02:35:25.480]  throws the whole world into an ice age because it kicks up so much dust
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:30.120]  i mean i'm not saying that can't happen i'm just saying this
[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:36.840]  into the world apocalyptic business is a psychological
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:40.200]  phenomenon where people are worried about their bills
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:43.640]  worried about their kids worried about life and
[02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:48.120]  well jesus is going to rapture us next month you know the such and such seal
[02:35:48.120 --> 02:35:51.720]  gets opened by preacher said uh or jesus is going to
[02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:56.600]  rapture us this this this july uh or the the i mean i remember in
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:35:59.640]  99 next year planet x is coming to kill us
[02:35:59.640 --> 02:36:03.560]  and i said i don't believe that and i said there's amateur astronomers you
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:06.440]  know that they couldn't cover this up and i was an evil government operative
[02:36:06.440 --> 02:36:09.320]  and then they and then i even predicted they would say
[02:36:09.320 --> 02:36:15.560]  well actually they got the gregorian calendar wrong in 2001 it's coming now
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:19.080]  they got the calendar wrong you know the priests that study this thousands of
[02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:22.120]  years ago and then it didn't come in 2001 well
[02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:27.560]  they got the calendar wrong again it's 2003 and then it was the buru and then
[02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:31.800]  it was gweagle black hole and then it was this kuiper belt thing and
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:35.560]  this comment and that comment and i remember back in the late 90s i didn't
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:40.600]  believe that there was a spaceship behind hail bop and i was the bad guy and
[02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:44.600]  and you know what it is people have to invent things that i'm bad about
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:48.600]  i'm just here covering the new world order the poisons and the vaccines
[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:53.400]  the government ship and the drugs in it isn't about who alex jones is
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:58.200]  it but instead the whole debate becomes alex jones and i'm just bombarded with
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:01.560]  it you know answer the question of why you're
[02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:06.520]  covering up for the comment and i'll be the bad one when we're
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:09.560]  still airing october
[02:37:10.520 --> 02:37:13.800]  i mean how do i respond to that
[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:20.600]  or the other garbage that's made up so again i understand i'm visible i'm out
[02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:23.960]  here talking and the government looks like it's
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:28.520]  invincible so it's fun to attack alex jones great
[02:37:28.520 --> 02:37:32.760]  people attacking me over this comment does not upset me because i'm being
[02:37:32.760 --> 02:37:36.360]  attacked i could care less what people think about me i think people
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:40.040]  probably notice that in fact in a sick way actually enjoy being attacked
[02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:42.920]  the stupider the better it's a sick form of entertainment
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:46.040]  but when i'm more intellectual and more spiritual about it i think man that's
[02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:49.720]  really sad that folks are so deceived that they
[02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:53.080]  constantly think a common or planet is about to kill the earth
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:57.240]  and the same people that think this never
[02:37:57.240 --> 02:38:01.960]  get discredited when it doesn't happen i mean there's always new books out
[02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:05.880]  the same people publish books every year how another
[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:09.800]  planetoid is going to kill us next year and they sell a bunch of books and then
[02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:13.240]  it doesn't kill us and they sell books again and it doesn't kill us
[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:18.600]  and they sell books again and they i mean i'm just like whoa
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:21.800]  i mean all right now i'm ranting and i said i go to your calls i just can't
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:24.520]  i mean it it just really worries me for people
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:29.800]  it really really worries me looking for the phone system here
[02:38:29.800 --> 02:38:35.800]  there it is uh let's talk to uh andrew in south dakota then we'll talk to rich

[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:11.240]  but they denied me for this handgun when i called the fbi
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:16.360]  they wouldn't tell me because it was a privacy issue why i got denied
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:20.120]  no no that's right so so you don't have a criminal record you're not a felon
[02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:23.560]  you should be able to buy it but they go for your privacy you're on a secret
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:27.400]  list they're already putting in the no fly no buy
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:32.120]  they put you on the no fly for no reason no judge no jury no appeal
[02:39:32.120 --> 02:39:36.600]  just magically you can't fly well now it's a no buy and the president's been
[02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:40.680]  talking about officially signing an executive order
[02:39:40.680 --> 02:39:44.280]  where he says you can't have a gun and next the police come
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:51.240]  and take your guns because well somebody said so uh and so so tell us
[02:39:51.240 --> 02:39:54.680]  about yourself i mean do you have a record
[02:39:54.680 --> 02:40:00.120]  no i can in 2001 i got a dui and and that was the only thing other than a
[02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:06.040]  speeding ticket whatever i asked that lady at the fbi that too and she said
[02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:11.080]  well i've never heard of this before but um we'll we'll send you this appeal
[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:15.320]  packet which takes 147 days approximately you've got to go to the
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:19.000]  media you want to file a lawsuit your constitutional rights are being
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.400]  violated uh you ought to go in and keep trying to
[02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:24.520]  buy firearms i mean you know don't want to stop you
[02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:27.960]  i mean you know you you've got to write to own guns you can go buy them at
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:31.800]  private sales i mean this is just outrageous and i can't
[02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:35.640]  tell you how many veterans i know i know a famous football player no criminal
[02:40:35.640 --> 02:40:39.320]  record he's a grandpa now and he hadn't bought a gun in
[02:40:39.320 --> 02:40:44.120]  years he went to buy one yeah but he's a veteran as well and they said sorry he
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:48.520]  went through all the appeals process and now they're saying that in vietnam
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:53.160]  now they've gone back and changed his file to say that one time when he had
[02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:57.320]  heat exhaustion uh that uh that was post-traumatic
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:02.200]  stress and so this is how they treat the veterans
[02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:05.560]  yeah yeah and my brother's special force is two and
[02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:10.680]  i i just well he's not gonna be able to own a gun once he gets out you watch
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:15.800]  so it's he's he's the one who inspired me to go get guns because he's got
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:19.720]  probably 10 different rifles and hand guns and
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:24.120]  i thought well you know i'd like to teach my kids if i ever have them how to
[02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:28.440]  shoot oh that's so evil that is so evil
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:33.000]  yeah listen i appreciate your call you know that's happening to a lot of people
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:36.760]  in fact the last month the bill clinton's
[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:43.400]  term 87 000 veterans were told you can no longer buy guns and they went into
[02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:46.760]  their files and changed it to post-traumatic stress
[02:41:46.760 --> 02:41:50.040]  there's no law they just said well we're sorry
[02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:54.040]  see once they get an instant check now you're talking to an operator
[02:41:54.040 --> 02:42:01.080]  and they're like well i'm sorry andrew no gun for you
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:04.920]  you show up at the airport sorry mr johnson you're not getting on the plane

[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:54.040]  disreputable to be struck down by a by a bottom feeder

[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:34.520]  nature of the world is uh upon us and needs to be
[02:46:34.520 --> 02:46:38.680]  spread further and further and further exactly i mean if we don't scream bloody
[02:46:38.680 --> 02:46:41.800]  murder when a classical dictatorship is being established

[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:24.280]  of information was available i said yeah prisonplayers.com and
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:27.080]  forwards i said check it out three hours a day you can't
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:30.280]  catch it during the day they run the broadcast all night but you know rich
[02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:33.800]  years ago people probably wouldn't have been as receptive that's what i found
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:37.800]  most people aren't laughing even two years ago folks would laugh
[02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:41.880]  if i randomly somewhere was just talking to folks you know uh on vacation in a
[02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:45.000]  hot tub or whatever they'd laugh now they go yes tell me more
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:49.240]  i mean see how reality setting in is getting them to put their thinking caps
[02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:52.760]  on you have the people in the in the intel and
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:56.520]  intelligence the impact on the educational wing of the world
[02:48:56.520 --> 02:49:00.040]  and they're seeing that their businesses be affected by the destruction of the
[02:49:00.040 --> 02:49:02.520]  middle class you know the kids aren't going to be able to get
[02:49:02.520 --> 02:49:05.640]  the college they can't pay the tuition you know and not that they're going to
[02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:09.160]  lose their money because they're all that tons of money set aside but what i'm
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:11.720]  saying is it when it begins to affect them
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:14.600]  then they start to see some of the handwriting on the wall let me be clear
[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:19.000]  the direction they're going they could devalue a million dollars you know
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:22.680]  ten years ago a millionaire was a big deal and now there's you know record
[02:49:22.680 --> 02:49:25.160]  numbers of millionaires because it's the equivalent of having like two hundred
[02:49:25.160 --> 02:49:29.080]  thousand dollars in the bank you know 15 20 years ago
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:32.440]  folks they could go into hyperinflation so bad
[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:35.880]  that a million dollars won't even buy a new car
[02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:39.800]  okay so a lot of these people that think well the economy's going down but i'll
[02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:43.560]  be okay uh uh folks that i'm telling you there are
[02:49:43.560 --> 02:49:47.560]  people the way this is going who've got five million dollars in the bank
[02:49:47.560 --> 02:49:50.520]  who down the road aren't going to be able to live on that
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:55.400]  that's what hyperinflation means what do you think of that
[02:49:55.400 --> 02:49:58.760]  unbelievable and alex you should let you know that man i'd pray for you every
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:02.600]  morning your protection your wife your kids the lord just keep your hand on you
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:05.400]  guys and keep you safe well god bless you you know
[02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:09.080]  mike adams wrote an article a few days ago called is alex jones for real and
[02:50:09.080 --> 02:50:11.960]  then he goes through how great i am and how he's been around our operation and
[02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:15.960]  who it really is real the information's real the facts are
[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:19.240]  real it isn't about alex jones it's about you
[02:50:19.240 --> 02:50:24.120]  standing up you know you're for real imagine how creepy it is to know i'm a
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:27.080]  hundred percent real to know i've always been real
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:30.840]  to know that i really do face everything that i'm going up against
[02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:34.760]  and i know i'm in god's hands and then to see people always questioning and
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:39.480]  making stuff up and criticizing it doesn't hurt me that they're attacking
[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:44.040]  me it hurts me that they don't have confidence in themselves
[02:50:44.040 --> 02:50:48.760]  they don't believe that somebody could actually resist tyranny
[02:50:48.760 --> 02:50:52.760]  they could do everything i've done and more that's what's so sad
[02:50:52.760 --> 02:50:57.320]  we could defeat these globalists but we have to free our minds first
[02:50:57.320 --> 02:51:01.400]  key information straight ahead stay with us
[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:04.760]  what you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40
[02:51:04.760 --> 02:51:08.120]  who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again
[02:51:08.120 --> 02:51:14.760]  i lost 20 pounds i lost 40 pounds i lost 55 pounds i went from a size 14
[02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:19.800]  to a size eight their secret is amber in the revolutionary formula for women
[02:51:19.800 --> 02:51:23.000]  over 40 that balances hormones naturally
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:26.680]  the leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance
[02:51:26.680 --> 02:51:30.760]  until you balance your hormones losing weight can be practically impossible
[02:51:30.760 --> 02:51:35.160]  but amberin restores hormonal balance naturally so the weight can just fall
[02:51:35.160 --> 02:51:38.680]  right off even that stubborn belly fat plus amberin

[02:55:01.240 --> 02:55:06.040]  a long time sorry to the other callers but we'll try to get to everybody
[02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:10.040]  um you know what i can't really do justice to this so i may shoot a special
[02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:13.080]  video report on it
[02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:18.280]  i may even do a special prison planet dot tv entire special report on this and
[02:55:18.280 --> 02:55:22.840]  just do it live so that it can be extensive
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:27.400]  but this illustrates for me everything the spirit of the hypocrisy the fact
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:30.760]  that the system isn't scared about being caught anymore
[02:55:30.760 --> 02:55:34.280]  because they're going for broke and the psychological warfare chiefs have
[02:55:34.280 --> 02:55:38.120]  basically decided to just blatantly do all this out in the open
[02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:41.640]  because they've got such even more horrible things planned
[02:55:41.640 --> 02:55:45.640]  that they've got to get us conditioned now that's why they've announced they're
[02:55:45.640 --> 02:55:49.000]  stealing the death benefits of the troops they get ready to cut in at least
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:54.120]  half their retirement uh they are getting ready to just
[02:55:54.120 --> 02:55:59.720]  absolutely devalue the dollar i mean this is some hardcore stuff and if you
[02:55:59.720 --> 02:56:03.240]  don't want your farm taken and you resist they're going to call you a terrorist
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:05.880]  and they don't care if the swat team gets killed doing it
[02:56:05.880 --> 02:56:10.440]  this is what they want they love libya in flames they love
[02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:14.040]  uh putting the extremist in in egypt they love
[02:56:14.040 --> 02:56:17.320]  all this destabilization and the globalist hate you
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:21.960]  as americans probably a hundred times more than they hate the muslims
[02:56:21.960 --> 02:56:26.120]  they hate anybody they don't control and they want to fully break this country
[02:56:26.120 --> 02:56:30.360]  forever they hate our police they hate our military
[02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:33.960]  they've got files on cops they've got files on the military
[02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:39.800]  they know who the good cops are and they hate you because they're criminals
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:43.560]  and if they can't sell you on criminality they're going to come after you
[02:56:43.560 --> 02:56:48.600]  study history you know i saw this article over the weekend
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:51.160]  and couldn't believe it but now it's in fox ap
[02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:56.760]  Reuters and the media goes along with it like it's a pretty good thing
[02:56:56.760 --> 02:57:01.480]  first responders to cry exclusion from 9 11 ceremony
[02:57:01.480 --> 02:57:04.520]  and because they've been critical over the poison dust and
[02:57:04.520 --> 02:57:11.000]  having their health care blocked the first responders are told you and your
[02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:14.040]  families are not welcome
[02:57:14.040 --> 02:57:17.720]  former president bush obama they're all going to grandstand and talk about how
[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:21.640]  they're heroes and play video with the firefighters up there with bush
[02:57:21.640 --> 02:57:27.720]  and the stupid bullhorn and they just don't care
[02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:34.280]  here's another one heroes terror scrutiny and we pushed for eight years i
[02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:36.600]  went to events lobbied raised the money
[02:57:36.600 --> 02:57:41.400]  you the listeners gave to try to get health care for the police
[02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:45.400]  the military the fire fighters who were denied health care they told them
[02:57:45.400 --> 02:57:48.440]  there's nothing wrong with your lungs well the the major university says it's
[02:57:48.440 --> 02:57:52.280]  full of asbestos in the CAT scan we'll just go home and die
[02:57:52.280 --> 02:57:57.400]  and most of them have had serious health problems or died
[02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:02.360]  in fact i've interviewed people that are now dead young men who are dead now
[02:58:02.360 --> 02:58:06.520]  and they don't get the health care and when they finally got it the government
[02:58:06.520 --> 02:58:09.720]  said okay it's through homeland security you got to go through a terror
[02:58:09.720 --> 02:58:13.720]  database before you get any health care every time
[02:58:13.720 --> 02:58:16.680]  before sick nine one recovery workers can get aid
[02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:20.120]  they have to prove they're not terrorist a little notice provision
[02:58:20.120 --> 02:58:24.280]  of the health compensation law and this is going to actually expand nationwide
[02:58:24.280 --> 02:58:28.360]  now to get quote jobs and infrastructure you've got to get government approval
[02:58:28.360 --> 02:58:31.960]  and then here's another one so remember the first responders they're terrorist
[02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:35.400]  they're scum they're not welcome at ground zero
[02:58:35.400 --> 02:58:39.160]  but the libyan rebels la time are admittedly al-qaeda
[02:58:39.160 --> 02:58:43.720]  so al-qaeda is good though

[03:01:36.760 --> 03:01:39.560]  look number one those people those to kind of talk show host and i know who
[03:01:39.560 --> 03:01:43.560]  you're talking about they're not idiots they cold-bloodily look at the scene
[03:01:43.560 --> 03:01:47.240]  they know it's a bunch of bull they're reporting and they decide to join
[03:01:47.240 --> 03:01:53.400]  with the dark side and so that's they've they've they've sold out to the system
[03:01:53.400 --> 03:01:57.160]  but see they think the sellout only goes as far as they've gone
[03:01:57.160 --> 03:02:01.240]  they don't know there are others who sell out a thousand times deeper
[03:02:01.240 --> 03:02:04.440]  and so they think they're part of the winning team they're not
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:08.120]  that's the big scam i appreciate your call
[03:02:08.120 --> 03:02:12.520]  it is important to call talk radio and work a little info wars dot com into the
[03:02:12.520 --> 03:02:16.280]  discussion what to do it is say oh by the way what do you think of info wars
[03:02:16.280 --> 03:02:21.400]  dot com leo you're on the air welcome
[03:02:21.400 --> 03:02:25.720]  hey thanks for taking my call my sources here in missouri have revealed to me
[03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:29.560]  that this earthquake was led by al qaeda and we must bomb
[03:02:29.560 --> 03:02:33.800]  the fault fault lines immediately in the name of peace
[03:02:33.800 --> 03:02:37.800]  well absolutely uh like we earlier a caller
[03:02:37.800 --> 03:02:41.880]  has confirmed it it was on a message board that that cabler elves working
[03:02:41.880 --> 03:02:45.080]  with the sum of bin laden are digging tunnels under the
[03:02:45.080 --> 03:02:47.800]  capital to do because they hate our freedom
[03:02:47.800 --> 03:02:51.320]  and the bad thing is you know i could probably see them coming out and saying
[03:02:51.320 --> 03:02:54.840]  that or saying it was mo mark adafi that he escaped and
[03:02:54.840 --> 03:02:59.000]  crawled up underneath virginia and created that earthquake well he probably
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.880]  did but don't worry al qaeda is going to show him
[03:03:01.880 --> 03:03:04.920]  you're not going to talk bad about al qaeda are you i mean they're
[03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:09.000]  there there are valiant forces but the first responders aren't allowed at
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:12.200]  ground zero can you believe how evil this government
[03:03:12.200 --> 03:03:15.720]  is well actually since i've been listening to you over the last eight
[03:03:15.720 --> 03:03:18.760]  years yeah more and more i can see it and i believe it
[03:03:18.760 --> 03:03:21.880]  yeah but i can't even believe they're telling the first responders they're
[03:03:21.880 --> 03:03:24.520]  not welcome but you know why i've talked to them
[03:03:24.520 --> 03:03:28.200]  i mean literally the most of the first responders know it's an inside job now
[03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:32.520]  they can't have them there exactly they don't want that message getting out you
[03:03:32.520 --> 03:03:36.440]  know to from people that were there two people that
[03:03:36.440 --> 03:03:41.320]  haven't believed it all this time they don't want that getting out to anybody
[03:03:41.320 --> 03:03:45.080]  absolutely good to hear from you my friend i mean let's jam in another one
[03:03:45.080 --> 03:03:50.040]  here uh let's talk to uh linda new york last
[03:03:50.040 --> 03:03:54.440]  caller thank you for holding thank you i really know jamming the fact that
[03:03:54.440 --> 03:03:58.280]  people don't even realize right now even now that the market
[03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:01.960]  is the one that's um the problem people still think
[03:04:01.960 --> 03:04:05.480]  ah the the money market i should buy gold because
[03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:09.240]  then i'm safe because money the value of the money is going down
[03:04:09.240 --> 03:04:13.320]  but the um the gold is not um they don't really get the
[03:04:13.320 --> 03:04:16.840]  fact that it is the money that's the problem that the past 40 years of the
[03:04:16.840 --> 03:04:19.720]  monetary system has been fucking the real value out of them
[03:04:19.720 --> 03:04:22.760]  yeah i don't know they think gold's bag is at cost more now
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:26.040]  they don't understand it's because the dollar's getting killed but you're not
[03:04:26.040 --> 03:04:29.480]  going to be able to help those folks that call up sometimes and go why do i want
[03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:32.760]  to buy gold again you try to explain it and they go
[03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:37.320]  i mean those folks probably can't even tie their shoelaces and i'm sorry for
[03:04:37.320 --> 03:04:44.200]  you know resolution 1489 in then you call the congress
[03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:47.560]  they do you're absolutely right i i am just out of time
