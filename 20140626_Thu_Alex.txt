[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.520 --> 00:19.080]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.080 --> 00:23.080]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.080 --> 00:30.160]  welcome to the Alex Jones show on this Thursday June 26 2014 I'm David Knight
[00:30.160 --> 00:35.160]  I'll be your host today we have a jam-packed show we're gonna have Paul
[00:35.160 --> 00:39.160]  Joseph Watson joining us at the bottom of the hour we have some very interesting
[00:39.160 --> 00:43.000]  articles that he's put up and we're gonna talk about that main one I'm
[00:43.000 --> 00:48.440]  interested in is this ex CIA officer who claims that open source revolution is
[00:48.440 --> 00:54.200]  about to overthrow a global oligarchy and the reason I like this is because
[00:54.200 --> 00:59.640]  it is so optimistic this guy sees us winning this thing you know a revolution
[00:59.640 --> 01:04.680]  is coming the question is is it going to be a peaceful revolution or is it going
[01:04.680 --> 01:08.440]  to be a violent revolution is it going to be a revolution that results in
[01:08.440 --> 01:13.640]  individual liberty or is it going to result in a security state and so it's
[01:13.640 --> 01:17.080]  I'm very anxious to talk to Paul about this article I think you'll enjoy
[01:17.080 --> 01:21.480]  hearing about it we also have updates on what's going on with SWAT teams all
[01:21.480 --> 01:24.920]  around the country we've got 10 facts that you need to know about SWAT teams
[01:24.920 --> 01:30.720]  and we also see that from an article from Mikhail Phelan we see that SWAT
[01:30.720 --> 01:36.440]  team association in Massachusetts regional SWAT teams say that they don't
[01:36.440 --> 01:41.000]  have to respond to freedom of information requests because they're private
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.960]  organizations and the ACLU says well you know either you're a government
[01:45.960 --> 01:49.640]  organization because you're getting this equipment this money this funding this
[01:49.640 --> 01:55.280]  training and doing government jobs or you're breaking the law what is it so
[01:55.280 --> 02:00.600]  that's an interesting take on this to see the arrogance of our government as
[02:00.600 --> 02:06.520]  it continually goes further and further into a secret police state where we're
[02:06.520 --> 02:10.760]  not allowed to know anything about the operation of anyone who works in a
[02:10.760 --> 02:13.680]  government it's not just the police it's not just the military it certainly is
[02:13.680 --> 02:17.920]  that the CIA or the NSA everybody is acting as if they work for the CIA now
[02:17.920 --> 02:23.720]  they all aren't going to tell you anything and it's all a top secret so
[02:23.720 --> 02:26.800]  we're going to be talking to Paul Joseph Watson about that at the bottom of the
[02:26.800 --> 02:30.240]  hour we've got Alex Jones is going to be joining us with a special report and
[02:30.240 --> 02:33.680]  we're going to be talking to Gerald Salenty now of course there's a lot of
[02:33.680 --> 02:38.400]  news about economics yesterday we talked about how they have revised the gross
[02:38.400 --> 02:46.720]  domestic product up from 1% decline to a 3% decline 2.9% that is huge and so
[02:46.720 --> 02:49.520]  we're going to be talking about what's really behind that data we want to get
[02:49.520 --> 02:54.360]  Gerald Salenty's forecast of that he has a lot to tell us as well about Iraq
[02:54.360 --> 02:58.560]  that's a favorite topic of his how the military industrial complex is always
[02:58.560 --> 03:02.640]  pushing us into war so Gerald has a lot to say about that as well as the
[03:02.640 --> 03:06.320]  economic data and of course when we look at this right after the break when we
[03:06.320 --> 03:09.760]  come back and start going over news we're going to look at the different
[03:09.760 --> 03:14.480]  excuses that are being offered for this massive decline in the economy so we're
[03:14.480 --> 03:17.080]  going to look at what's really behind it we're going to look at the excuses that
[03:17.080 --> 03:20.400]  are going to be put out there there's also a lot of breaking news about the
[03:20.400 --> 03:23.800]  Supreme Court they're releasing a lot of decisions here this week they're
[03:23.800 --> 03:29.240]  coming multiple ones a day we had a couple of decisions yesterday one of the
[03:29.240 --> 03:33.960]  ones that I thought was most important was the unanimous decision from the
[03:33.960 --> 03:39.560]  Supreme Court saying that police need a search warrant to look at data on your
[03:39.560 --> 03:45.600]  phone really do you think that's great they unanimously appell the fourth
[03:45.600 --> 03:51.160]  amendment so that's good that's real good news and today we have another
[03:51.160 --> 03:55.840]  decision from them where they essentially strike down some free speech
[03:55.840 --> 04:00.120]  zones in Massachusetts that were put up around abortion clinics so we're going to
[04:00.120 --> 04:05.400]  talk about that as well as another decision that affected Obama's recess
[04:05.400 --> 04:09.240]  appointments I think Kurt Nemo has the right take on this a lot of people have
[04:09.240 --> 04:14.080]  missed and that is the background behind this that this is really about trying to
[04:14.080 --> 04:18.160]  establish a balance between different branches and the federal government and
[04:18.160 --> 04:23.200]  of course the way the Constitution was set up it wasn't just a division and a
[04:23.200 --> 04:26.080]  check and balance within the federal government as we're told in our
[04:26.080 --> 04:30.480]  government schools really that was there certainly is there that's a part of it
[04:30.480 --> 04:35.280]  but it's also key that we understand and that we recover not only the
[04:35.280 --> 04:38.720]  understanding but the actual practice that there's a division between the
[04:38.720 --> 04:43.080]  central authority between the state authorities and between the people and
[04:43.080 --> 04:46.360]  the key way you're going to get that is with jury notification we're not going
[04:46.360 --> 04:48.760]  to talk about that we're going to talk about these Supreme Court decisions and
[04:48.760 --> 04:54.240]  about scoff law federal employees and bureaucracies and congressmen so stay
[04:54.240 --> 04:57.000]  with us we'll be right back

[08:28.560 --> 08:32.800]  by special report by Alex Jones as well as an interview with Gerald Salenty
[08:32.800 --> 08:37.520]  coming up in the third hour a lot of breaking economic news so we want to get
[08:37.520 --> 08:42.960]  Gerald Salenty's takes on that on the forecast we've had a huge downturn a
[08:42.960 --> 08:47.480]  huge revision and that's a downturn in the gross domestic product they
[08:47.480 --> 08:51.320]  estimated that it was just a 1% downturn which would be bad enough but
[08:51.320 --> 08:54.040]  then they tripled that yesterday so we're gonna talk a little bit more about
[08:54.040 --> 08:57.240]  that in detail in just a few minutes and we're gonna talk to Gerald Salenty
[08:57.240 --> 09:01.160]  about that and I know that a topic that Gerald loves to talk about is the
[09:01.160 --> 09:06.000]  military industrials complex driving us into war he's got a lot to say about
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.080]  that so he's gonna be joining us in the third hour Alex will be with us in the
[09:10.080 --> 09:13.840]  second hour Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us at the bottom of the
[09:13.840 --> 09:18.000]  hour so we got a very busy show here before we get to our guests I wanted to
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.960]  go over some news there's a story up on info wars dot com from a Don Salazar
[09:23.960 --> 09:27.640]  talking about the growing chorus that is charging Obama with facilitating
[09:27.640 --> 09:34.600]  immigration and flux you know I'm reminded of the the latest Captain America
[09:34.600 --> 09:40.840]  movie where the Robert Redford character says you have to destroy the world to
[09:40.840 --> 09:44.880]  rebuild it you know what they're doing is they're creating a new world disorder
[09:44.880 --> 09:48.640]  before they establish their new world order they're doing this not only in
[09:48.640 --> 09:52.880]  America but they're also doing it in Europe that's what we're seeing going
[09:52.880 --> 09:55.640]  on with uncontrolled immigration there because they're using essentially the
[09:55.640 --> 10:00.320]  same tactics they're trying to consolidate the different areas of the globe
[10:00.320 --> 10:05.680]  regionally into a European Union and to NAFTA then they are going to take those
[10:05.680 --> 10:09.920]  areas down and one of the ways that they do it is with a massive uncontrolled
[10:09.920 --> 10:15.120]  demographic surge and we've heard yesterday we've played excerpts from
[10:15.120 --> 10:19.200]  Petraeus talking in London talking about what comes after America he says
[10:19.200 --> 10:25.640]  well that's simple North America we're 20 years into NAFTA and so we're going to
[10:25.640 --> 10:30.680]  see that North America the unified North America is going to replace America
[10:30.680 --> 10:33.440]  they're very upfront about it now they've come out they've taken the mask off
[10:33.440 --> 10:37.960]  they're no longer pretending that NAFTA is just a trade deal and it isn't a trade
[10:37.960 --> 10:42.240]  deal neither was the European Union a trade deal they are both intermediate
[10:42.240 --> 10:47.760]  steps to a global control and we're seeing that now and as a Don points out
[10:47.760 --> 10:52.880]  many people are joining the course and saying that this is not a that the surge
[10:52.880 --> 10:57.160]  and you know when I talk about a surge it reminds me exactly of Petraeus that
[10:57.160 --> 11:01.080]  this is really a demographic surge this is boots on the ground we've been
[11:01.080 --> 11:07.800]  attacked from the above by the banksters with massive debt with the mortgage
[11:07.800 --> 11:13.640]  collapse of the economy five years ago six years ago actually now we're getting
[11:13.640 --> 11:17.240]  boots on the ground that are going to put that in and of course it's not just
[11:17.240 --> 11:22.240]  and spontaneous humanitarian crisis but it's carefully concocted premeditated
[11:22.240 --> 11:26.440]  plan that is purposely set in motion by as he points out the Obama
[11:26.440 --> 11:31.600]  administration of course that plan is coming from NAFTA and the people that
[11:31.600 --> 11:35.360]  is a lengthy article you need to take a look at this but it's Jeff sessions we
[11:35.360 --> 11:39.680]  got Jan Brewer we got the Speaker of the House we've got Arizona representatives
[11:39.680 --> 11:43.520]  saying what occurs when the Obama administration chooses not to enforce our
[11:43.520 --> 11:48.080]  laws we have the Texas judge we've got the National Border Patrol counsel
[11:48.080 --> 11:52.400]  these are people the former Association of Border Patrol officers they're the
[11:52.400 --> 11:57.280]  boots on the ground it they're the ones seeing that the that the borders are
[11:57.280 --> 12:00.920]  collapsing and they're very upset about the fact that they're no longer doing
[12:00.920 --> 12:06.080]  law enforcement they're just changing diapers and running a taxi service in the
[12:06.080 --> 12:09.920]  United States and of course this is being done by Homeland Security the same
[12:09.920 --> 12:15.520]  organization that controls our collapsed borders is also harassing and still
[12:15.520 --> 12:21.080]  harassing people in the airport and of course we showed from the mistakenly
[12:21.080 --> 12:26.520]  published unredacted lawsuit that John Corbett had against the TSA we showed
[12:26.520 --> 12:30.040]  that back in 2011 they admitted in their own internal documents that there was no
[12:30.040 --> 12:34.520]  threat against airports or airplanes in 2011 at the same time they were
[12:34.520 --> 12:39.520]  threatening a no-fly zone in Texas because we had Texas representatives that
[12:39.520 --> 12:45.880]  already passed unanimously essentially in the House to rein in the TSA and its
[12:45.880 --> 12:50.720]  sexual abuse against children going into their pants looking harassing everyone
[12:50.720 --> 12:54.720]  at the border when they come in via plane but opening up the border completely
[12:54.720 --> 12:59.040]  for anyone to come in now there's a story that's up on the drudge report from
[12:59.040 --> 13:03.840]  Paul Joseph Watson and this is a professor from University of California
[13:03.840 --> 13:09.480]  Davis and he also says that this is a deliberate plot now this is what he
[13:09.480 --> 13:15.600]  his take on it he says this is a plot to exclude the American middle class from a
[13:15.600 --> 13:20.520]  University California education and to create a new demographic of largely
[13:20.520 --> 13:24.840]  immigrant or foreign national undergraduate population that can be
[13:24.840 --> 13:31.040]  reeducated from the ground up and controlled more readily exactly this is
[13:31.040 --> 13:36.280]  about excluding the middle class this is about this is what the colleges have
[13:36.280 --> 13:40.040]  been doing for a long time but this is why they're bringing in the massive
[13:40.040 --> 13:45.720]  influx of immigration they want people who are indebted with gratitude to the
[13:45.720 --> 13:49.640]  state for their education for everything that the state is lavishing on them and
[13:49.640 --> 13:54.640]  they are lavishing expenses on them far greater than they are for example our
[13:54.640 --> 13:58.320]  veterans of the VA hospitals they're getting nothing whereas these people
[13:58.320 --> 14:02.280]  who are coming in illegally are being given everything transportation food
[14:02.280 --> 14:07.680]  clothing shelter they are trying to indebt them with gratitude and if you
[14:07.680 --> 14:11.560]  want to go to college however you're not going to get in-state tuition rates
[14:11.560 --> 14:16.120]  you're not going to get a full ride commission as he talks about a tuition
[14:16.120 --> 14:19.800]  you're not going to get that illegals will get it the children of the
[14:19.800 --> 14:23.320]  illegals will get it but you aren't they can go to any state that they want and
[14:23.320 --> 14:28.600]  get in-state tuition if I were to go from Texas to California I wouldn't get
[14:28.600 --> 14:33.120]  in-state tuition in California but illegal aliens will and so what they're
[14:33.120 --> 14:36.800]  trying to do is they're either going to indebt these people with gratitude to
[14:36.800 --> 14:41.040]  the state that takes care of them in all respects or if you choose to go to
[14:41.040 --> 14:46.000]  college you will be so indebted to the banks that you will never get out of
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.360]  debt you will be an indentured servant to the banks for the rest of your life
[14:49.360 --> 14:54.680]  you can't dismiss your college loans that's one thing you can't dismiss with
[14:54.680 --> 14:57.520]  a bankruptcy so you're going to be a debt slave for the rest of your life you
[14:57.520 --> 15:01.960]  know if you're the middle class you don't need that brainwashing if you take a
[15:01.960 --> 15:05.360]  business class on return and investment you know you can club out of college
[15:05.360 --> 15:09.680]  completely just forget the whole thing but this is a great article you should
[15:09.680 --> 15:12.920]  take a look at it and he even has a publicity stat that he's working on
[15:12.920 --> 15:18.640]  which basically will with parody try to make the point demanding racial
[15:18.640 --> 15:23.120]  equality for 30 million Asians of different nationalities that they be
[15:23.120 --> 15:27.280]  brought into the US and integrated into the national security welfare state and
[15:27.280 --> 15:30.920]  that's exactly what it is it's a national security welfare state it's the
[15:30.920 --> 15:36.360]  warfare welfare state but of course now the warfare aspect of it is turning
[15:36.360 --> 15:39.680]  inward just looking at some of these other headlines hundreds of immigrants
[15:39.680 --> 15:44.400]  to be sheltered at Border Patrol training Academy the immigration reform
[15:44.400 --> 15:49.400]  prospects are dead says Luis Gutierrez Pelosi scoffs at the House GOP lawsuit
[15:49.400 --> 15:54.000]  ICE removal operations director confirms years before illegals will have their
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.840]  cases heard they've got a backlog of so many hundreds of thousands of cases that
[15:57.840 --> 16:00.960]  of course they're looking at this is essentially their paperwork that allows
[16:00.960 --> 16:05.640]  them to stay in the United States and then we look at this this last one here
[16:05.640 --> 16:12.080]  Europe's migrant influx they say we need help and we don't know where from see
[16:12.080 --> 16:17.640]  it's not just America this is a global plan it is about regional disorder
[16:17.640 --> 16:21.720]  regional consolidation we see them moving ahead with these plans with the
[16:21.720 --> 16:25.240]  trans-pacific partnership with the transatlantic partnership where they're
[16:25.240 --> 16:30.600]  replacing democratically elected governments with these kind of NAFTA
[16:30.600 --> 16:36.240]  style tribunals where multinational corporations not corporations not like
[16:36.240 --> 16:40.080]  somebody who has it has incorporated down the street for a small business this
[16:40.080 --> 16:44.200]  is only multinational corporations that are going to get this kind of
[16:44.200 --> 16:49.760]  protection now there's also some nanny state news and today which is a little
[16:49.760 --> 16:55.880]  bit lighter they actually suffered a blow in the New York court courts are
[16:55.880 --> 17:00.080]  actually had a pretty good week this week for Liberty this is just a New York
[17:00.080 --> 17:04.800]  Court of Appeals but it is the highest court in the state this is an article up
[17:04.800 --> 17:09.360]  on info wars.com from Kurt Nemo nanny state suffers a blow in New York the
[17:09.360 --> 17:15.480]  court overturns a soda ban from Michael Bloomberg they say he exceeded his
[17:15.480 --> 17:20.600]  authority do you think I mean the ban as he points out didn't apply to drinks that
[17:20.600 --> 17:24.480]  were sold in grocery stores it didn't apply to diet sodas it didn't apply to
[17:24.480 --> 17:30.480]  drinks with more than 70% fruit juice or drinks that contained alcohol so he's
[17:30.480 --> 17:33.520]  just got his little list I guess you know when you're going into a restaurant
[17:33.520 --> 17:36.520]  he doesn't want you to get too big a glass of soda or get refills with it
[17:36.520 --> 17:40.400]  whatever I mean if you're dictator you can make any kind of arbitrary rules you
[17:40.400 --> 17:45.760]  want but look at where this is going ironically this is a follow-up story
[17:45.760 --> 17:49.760]  that also came out today from Bloomberg looking at another aspect of the nanny
[17:49.760 --> 17:55.000]  state and this is a Bloomberg news service here's the headline hospitals
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.640]  soon to see doughnuts to cigarette charges for health in other words you
[18:00.640 --> 18:04.000]  eat doughnuts you smoke cigarettes you're going to get surcharges on your
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.080]  insurance this is something we told people 20 years ago when Hilary Clinton
[18:09.080 --> 18:14.560]  as first lady decided that she was going to take over the health care of the
[18:14.560 --> 18:18.800]  entire country and federalize it with Hilary care and we were telling people
[18:18.800 --> 18:24.560]  if you allow the state to become the single insurer in the name of efficiency
[18:24.560 --> 18:27.080]  and of course that's not going to make anything efficient when you've got a
[18:27.080 --> 18:30.280]  monopoly everybody knows that but that was what Hilary Clinton was trying to
[18:30.280 --> 18:35.360]  sell at the time we said if you allow them to take over health care completely
[18:35.360 --> 18:39.120]  they're going to be coming into your kitchen and telling you what you can
[18:39.120 --> 18:43.240]  eat you got too much fat here you got too much sugar there why because they
[18:43.240 --> 18:48.520]  own you you are a liability on their balance sheet and that's what's
[18:48.520 --> 18:52.760]  happening now this whole thing with Obamacare is really more of a fascist
[18:52.760 --> 18:57.240]  span on it than Hilary's which was full-out socialism one of the reasons
[18:57.240 --> 19:01.040]  that he got it through it's one of the reasons that it started with Mitt Romney
[19:01.040 --> 19:07.000]  in Massachusetts it's a fascist plan to make money for the insurance companies
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.720]  and of course the insurance companies want to keep their profits so what are
[19:09.720 --> 19:14.080]  they going to do they're going to get the hospitals looking at your life what
[19:14.080 --> 19:18.880]  they say in here is the idea is to use big data and predictive models to think
[19:18.880 --> 19:24.560]  about population health and then to drill down to the individual levels to find
[19:24.560 --> 19:29.880]  someone is running into trouble we can reach out and try to help him remember
[19:29.880 --> 19:34.240]  that song from Simon and Garfunkel Mrs. Robinson we'd like to know a little bit

[24:32.040 --> 24:37.560]  definitely sets the right mood here guys there's an article up on Info Wars Day
[24:37.560 --> 24:43.280]  from Mikhail Thelen SWAT team refuses public records request and says we are
[24:43.280 --> 24:48.160]  not a government agency through which the ACLU says either it's a public
[24:48.160 --> 24:54.680]  entity subject to public records laws or what it's doing is illegal now this is
[24:54.680 --> 24:58.440]  a regional SWAT team in Massachusetts refusing to release information on raid
[24:58.440 --> 25:02.400]  statistics saying that's a private organization it's the northeastern
[25:02.400 --> 25:08.040]  Massachusetts law enforcement council NIMLEC and NIMLEC can't have it both
[25:08.040 --> 25:13.720]  ways says the ACLU of Massachusetts either it's a public entity subject to
[25:13.720 --> 25:17.440]  public record laws or it's what it's doing is illegal they say if police
[25:17.440 --> 25:23.440]  agencies hide behind a wall of secrecy the public can't judge for itself whether
[25:23.440 --> 25:27.320]  the officials are acting appropriately or whether policy changes are needed see
[25:27.320 --> 25:32.280]  that's the problem with everything that the government is doing everything that
[25:32.280 --> 25:35.960]  the government is doing no matter what agency we talked to they don't want to
[25:35.960 --> 25:40.200]  talk to us they tell us go talk to our public information officer go send them
[25:40.200 --> 25:43.760]  a give them a phone call send them an email whatever they never get back to us
[25:43.760 --> 25:47.000]  if we show up to talk to them they get angry with us because we're practicing
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.760]  quote-unquote ambush journalism well you know what we're going to expose it
[25:50.760 --> 25:53.800]  because we're not going to have a government that thinks that it's above
[25:53.800 --> 25:57.560]  the law that thinks that it can operate in secrecy whether you're talking about
[25:57.560 --> 26:01.040]  an airport or any kind of municipal organization or whether you're talking
[26:01.040 --> 26:04.600]  about the CIA there needs to be transparency there needs to be oversight
[26:04.600 --> 26:08.840]  there needs to be information to the public well we have another article up
[26:08.840 --> 26:13.080]  on info wars 10 facts about the swatification of America that everybody
[26:13.080 --> 26:18.400]  should know and here are those 10 facts here's the top 10 facts about swat
[26:18.400 --> 26:23.720]  teams number one in 1980 there are approximately 3,000 swat raids in the
[26:23.720 --> 26:31.000]  United States now there are 80,000 swat raids per year in this country about 30
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.480]  times number two 79% of the time SWAT teams are deployed to private homes
[26:36.480 --> 26:42.600]  number three 50% of the victims of SWAT raids are either black or Latino number
[26:42.600 --> 26:48.880]  four and 65% of SWAT deployments a battering ram a boot or some sort of
[26:48.880 --> 26:54.960]  explosive devices used to gain forced entry into a home number five 62% of
[26:54.960 --> 26:59.440]  all SWAT raids involve a search for drugs say this is all started with the
[26:59.440 --> 27:05.280]  war on drugs now they're going to expand this into the war on terror six and at
[27:05.280 --> 27:10.080]  least 36% of all SWAT raids no contraband of any kind is found by the
[27:10.080 --> 27:14.280]  police number seven in cases where suspected there's a weapon in the home
[27:14.280 --> 27:20.280]  police only find a weapon 35% of the time number eight more than 100 American
[27:20.280 --> 27:26.160]  families have their homes raided by SWAT teams every single day this is an
[27:26.160 --> 27:28.960]  important point that was made yesterday when I talked to Cheryl Chumley in the
[27:28.960 --> 27:34.120]  book police state USA we sell it here at infowarstore.com she was saying there's
[27:34.120 --> 27:38.480]  a perception of a lot of people that these things are few and far between she
[27:38.480 --> 27:41.600]  knows better we know better when we're looking at this on info wars there's
[27:41.600 --> 27:45.400]  so much of this out there that we can't cover it all so you only hear about the
[27:45.400 --> 27:50.320]  most egregious cases where they come in and they throw a flashbang grenade into
[27:50.320 --> 27:57.360]  the crib of an 18 month year old 18 month old baby it's severely severely
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.400]  damaging that child blowing up his face blowing up his rib cage to the extent
[28:01.400 --> 28:07.760]  that his ribs are exposed number nine only 7% of all SWAT deployments are for
[28:07.760 --> 28:12.560]  hostage barricade or active shooter scenarios see that only 7% and that's
[28:12.560 --> 28:17.160]  the article we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson about we see a tweet that
[28:17.160 --> 28:22.040]  was put out that her guy says well when ISIS comes a calling in America they're
[28:22.040 --> 28:27.600]  going to forget about all these babies that have flashbangs grenades thrown into
[28:27.600 --> 28:33.080]  their cribs well only 7% of SWAT deployments are for hostage barricade or
[28:33.080 --> 28:38.120]  active shooter scenarios and the last one number 10 even small towns are
[28:38.120 --> 28:42.080]  getting SWAT teams now 30 years ago only 25 percent of communities with
[28:42.080 --> 28:48.320]  populations between 25 and 50,000 people had a SWAT team now 80% of the small
[28:48.320 --> 28:52.320]  teams do and so we're gonna have Paul Joseph Watson joining us in the next
[28:52.320 --> 28:57.080]  segment about this article that he put up today law enforcement firms as nobody
[28:57.080 --> 29:01.880]  will complain about the militarized police when ISIS attack and I asked the
[29:01.880 --> 29:05.960]  question how are we going to tell the difference between the SWAT teams and
[29:05.960 --> 29:10.840]  the terrorists how we know the difference they both wear masks they're both
[29:10.840 --> 29:14.360]  throwing grenades at people they both kill innocent people they both brag
[29:14.360 --> 29:20.080]  about it they both use violence to achieve political ends and they both say
[29:20.080 --> 29:24.080]  they aren't government agents when actually we know they both are the
[29:24.080 --> 29:27.520]  terrorist including the SWAT team so we're gonna talk to Paul Joseph Watson
[29:27.520 --> 29:32.440]  right after the break we're gonna find out what's behind this arrogance and we
[29:32.440 --> 29:37.440]  have a very optimistic take on the future so we're gonna talk about that as
[29:37.440 --> 29:40.800]  well we can't roll this thing back we can do it peacefully we can have a
[29:40.800 --> 29:45.720]  revolution that results in more individual liberty not in a police state
[29:45.720 --> 29:53.520]  stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[32:11.680 --> 32:15.320]  pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90 percent of their
[32:15.320 --> 32:19.600]  time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42
[32:19.600 --> 32:23.680]  million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold and
[32:23.680 --> 32:27.640]  mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million
[32:27.640 --> 32:30.840]  Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to
[32:30.840 --> 32:34.880]  research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my
[32:34.880 --> 32:39.080]  lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but
[32:39.080 --> 32:43.200]  we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and
[32:43.200 --> 32:47.520]  manufactured in the USA the new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a
[32:47.520 --> 32:50.720]  convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic
[32:50.720 --> 32:54.960]  environment now available exclusively an info wars life comm are by calling toll
[32:54.960 --> 33:13.960]  3888 to 533139 defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's
[33:13.960 --> 33:22.240]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex show I'm David Knight in Austin and I'm
[33:22.240 --> 33:26.120]  joined now by Paul Joseph Watson in the UK want to talk about some of the
[33:26.120 --> 33:30.920]  articles that he put up today just before the break I was I gave you the
[33:30.920 --> 33:36.320]  headline law enforcement firm nobody will complain about militarized police when
[33:36.320 --> 33:40.760]  ISIS attacks that's a tweet they put out in other words instead of instead of
[33:40.760 --> 33:45.320]  saying you know maybe we went too far maybe we need to examine what we do when
[33:45.320 --> 33:49.360]  we are killing innocent people when we're throwing grenades into babies
[33:49.360 --> 33:53.200]  cribs instead he says hey you're gonna want us when the terrorists come in and
[33:53.200 --> 33:58.600]  Paul I asked when it's the government's policy to terrorize us and intimidate us
[33:58.600 --> 34:02.960]  with things like SWAT raids and militarized vehicles how do we tell
[34:02.960 --> 34:06.000]  these guys from the terrorists I mean they both wear masks they seem to operate
[34:06.000 --> 34:09.840]  in the same way it's becoming increasingly difficult isn't it
[34:09.840 --> 34:15.120]  David I mean this arrives in the context of this big ACLU report investigation
[34:15.120 --> 34:18.840]  which you mentioned before the break which basically describes the United
[34:18.840 --> 34:23.600]  States as a war zone with the increase in these SWAT team raids injuries and
[34:23.600 --> 34:29.680]  deaths since 2010 I threw the roof you mentioned before the break 80,000 SWAT
[34:29.680 --> 34:35.960]  raids per year now that's actually up from 45,000 in 2005 so in just the
[34:35.960 --> 34:40.400]  course of the last eight years that figure has almost doubled so now you've
[34:40.400 --> 34:46.200]  got this story today which is out of a company that provides video training
[34:46.200 --> 34:49.920]  programs for law enforcement I believe it's run by X law enforcement officials
[34:49.920 --> 34:56.480]  and basically they reference infants like Boo Boo who was the 18 month toddler
[34:56.480 --> 35:02.360]  critically injured brain damage still in intensive care after a SWAT team member
[35:02.360 --> 35:07.480]  threw a flash bang grenade into his crib during a raid near Atlanta recently
[35:07.480 --> 35:12.120]  of course they also mentioned ISIS which is the insurgent group in Iraq that's
[35:12.120 --> 35:16.040]  taken over key towns in Iraq which of course members of which were trained by
[35:16.040 --> 35:20.480]  the US government in Jordan that's seldom mentioned exactly in this in this
[35:20.480 --> 35:25.640]  Facebook post they say when this militarization of LEAs law enforcement
[35:25.640 --> 35:29.880]  agencies affects infants like Boo Boo the public's going to be righteously
[35:29.880 --> 35:34.840]  outraged but someday when ISIS comes a calling who will be complaining then so
[35:34.840 --> 35:39.000]  as you said they're basically saying that when the terrorists attack this
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.320]  militarization of police will be necessary will be needed and in fact will be
[35:43.320 --> 35:48.120]  called for by the American people so it's a completely outrageous common in
[35:48.120 --> 35:52.480]  light of the fact that this poor toddler remained in intensive care could
[35:52.480 --> 35:56.840]  die from his injuries after this disgraceful SWAT team attack and they
[35:56.840 --> 36:01.560]  link to the Guardian article about this big ACLU report about how the SWAT
[36:01.560 --> 36:05.000]  teams the police are becoming increasingly militarized and they
[36:05.000 --> 36:11.000]  basically just dismiss it as necessary in light of ISIS which is a group that the
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.880]  US government the Obama administration was partly responsible for creating
[36:14.880 --> 36:19.360]  through their support of jihadists in Syria yeah exactly and like this other
[36:19.360 --> 36:23.040]  article that we have from my Mikhail Phelan you've got a regional SWAT team
[36:23.040 --> 36:26.960]  says we're not a we're not a public agency we don't need to respond to a
[36:26.960 --> 36:31.880]  request for information from the ACLU I mean you know both the SWAT team there
[36:31.880 --> 36:36.800]  as well as ISIS you know they're both trained by the government equipped by
[36:36.800 --> 36:39.800]  our government and they both claim that they don't work for our government and
[36:39.800 --> 36:43.040]  yet they're using these kind of terrorist tactics you know you mentioned
[36:43.040 --> 36:47.600]  Paul that this is an organization that tweeted this in the line of duty that
[36:47.600 --> 36:51.760]  trains people and that's really where the problem is coming from it's coming
[36:51.760 --> 36:55.920]  from the people who train them and they're being trained by homeland security
[36:55.920 --> 37:01.840]  to have these kinds of rules of engagement to look at America as a war
[37:01.840 --> 37:06.600]  zone you know out in New Mexico when everybody saw that homeless man shot for
[37:06.600 --> 37:11.600]  illegal camping and was outraged they don't really care about that the police
[37:11.600 --> 37:17.280]  in New Mexico they have a curriculum in New Mexico and the State Academy for the
[37:17.280 --> 37:22.160]  police a shoot first curriculum they had instructor who resigned because he
[37:22.160 --> 37:26.160]  refused to teach that kind of curriculum and so they look at this as a war zone
[37:26.160 --> 37:30.200]  and that should make us all the more afraid of the fact that they justify
[37:30.200 --> 37:36.200]  these assassinations abroad with drones as saying that well it's a war zone we
[37:36.200 --> 37:40.200]  need to understand that they see the entire world as a war zone so when they
[37:40.200 --> 37:44.200]  put things like the NDAA where they say the military can indefinitely detain
[37:44.200 --> 37:48.640]  people they can transport them for torture whatever when they put that in
[37:48.640 --> 37:51.480]  and say well that's that's when it's a war zone we need to understand that they
[37:51.480 --> 37:59.920]  recognize America now as a war zone precisely because this flashbang tactic
[37:59.920 --> 38:05.040]  that is a military tactic that was used against insurgents in Afghanistan and
[38:05.040 --> 38:08.600]  Iraq it's just like the armored vehicles have been brought home to be used
[38:08.600 --> 38:12.440]  against the American people that military tactic is now being used against the
[38:12.440 --> 38:15.680]  American people and in the Guardian article there are several other examples
[38:15.680 --> 38:20.320]  where children have been injured and even killed by these flashbang grenade
[38:20.320 --> 38:24.280]  attacks as it were so they're using military tactics that were used against
[38:24.280 --> 38:29.440]  terrorists previously there are even for example a mayor in Illinois called out
[38:29.440 --> 38:33.720]  a SWAT team to search the house of someone who had poked fun at him on a
[38:33.720 --> 38:38.040]  Twitter account so they're using SWAT teams as their little private armies to
[38:38.040 --> 38:42.360]  go after people who merely express dissent and as he said they're concerned
[38:42.360 --> 38:45.800]  about transparency that's why they don't want to release any more details
[38:45.800 --> 38:50.800]  because there's growing outrage about this and another new factor is now we've
[38:50.800 --> 38:57.320]  got pro police state Facebook pages which solely exists to scoff at real cases of
[38:57.320 --> 39:02.600]  police brutality in an attempt to get these anti-police brutality Facebook
[39:02.600 --> 39:06.240]  pages shut down so just like you know government's hire people to troll
[39:06.240 --> 39:11.320]  websites to troll comment sections now there are entire Facebook cliques groups
[39:11.320 --> 39:15.760]  that go after people who are complaining about police brutality so again it's
[39:15.760 --> 39:19.720]  shows that the desperate attempt to cover up this police brutality as its
[39:19.720 --> 39:24.080]  endemic spread begins to dominate social media as more people are becoming
[39:24.080 --> 39:29.520]  aware of it it's an information war isn't it and we have to we have to
[39:29.520 --> 39:32.800]  educate that it's we have to educate the public as to what's going on it's why
[39:32.800 --> 39:37.440]  I talked to Cheryl Trumley yesterday about her book police state USA people
[39:37.440 --> 39:41.360]  don't understand what's going on and so that's what you're talking about there's
[39:41.360 --> 39:44.920]  a war and they're pushing back with the as you point out pro police state
[39:44.920 --> 39:49.600]  Facebook pages and social media and we know that they hire government trolls
[39:49.600 --> 39:54.000]  to troll our website to troll other places to push back on comments against
[39:54.000 --> 39:57.960]  that but one of the things that I think we we really need to stress to people is
[39:57.960 --> 40:01.640]  how this is really being done by the military industrial complex the same
[40:01.640 --> 40:05.760]  people that have given us unending wars since the end of World War two for
[40:05.760 --> 40:10.240]  profit are now bringing those wars home they've made a lot of money out of the
[40:10.240 --> 40:14.560]  war on drugs they want a war on terrorism here domestically they sell a lot of
[40:14.560 --> 40:18.840]  equipment to these police departments to the federal government which then
[40:18.840 --> 40:22.920]  donates them to the police departments because it's the Homeland Security that
[40:22.920 --> 40:27.600]  is driving all this change and the police that's militarizing the police and
[40:27.600 --> 40:31.080]  centralizing control but we really need to look at all of these quote-unquote
[40:31.080 --> 40:34.960]  non-lethal techniques that they're using against everybody as you pointed out
[40:34.960 --> 40:39.640]  you know the flashbang grenades the beanbag shotguns that they just killed
[40:39.640 --> 40:43.960]  a World War two vet that was in his 90s with tasers where they're tasering
[40:43.960 --> 40:47.080]  people and people are getting permanently brain damage when they hit the
[40:47.080 --> 40:52.480]  ground or die from that many cases from a heart attack or from the fall that
[40:52.480 --> 40:56.880]  they have these non-lethal things that are being sold by the military industrial
[40:56.880 --> 41:00.760]  complex to police departments are not non-lethal and they've got a
[41:00.760 --> 41:05.560]  lot more in the pipeline as you pointed out in recent weeks I think it was you
[41:05.560 --> 41:11.000]  that had the article about the pepper spraying drone yeah that was my brother
[41:11.000 --> 41:16.160]  yeah yeah they're building an arsenal I mean yeah you know the guy who trained
[41:16.160 --> 41:20.160]  Fallujah forces Iraqi soldiers said that Homeland Security is building a
[41:20.160 --> 41:25.480]  domestic army that was during his testimony against New Hampshire's
[41:25.480 --> 41:29.200]  purchase of one of these bear cat armored vehicles and in fact the police
[41:29.200 --> 41:33.320]  chief in justifying the purchase of that vehicle wrote in his application that
[41:33.320 --> 41:39.320]  it was needed to deal with the threat posed by libertarians and occupy
[41:39.320 --> 41:44.080]  activists yeah so the police in that state brazenly admitted that this was to
[41:44.080 --> 41:49.160]  deal with political dissidents so isn't it as it said seven percent used against
[41:49.160 --> 41:54.080]  barricaded potentially violent criminals in the home that's a minority the real
[41:54.080 --> 41:57.960]  purpose is to terrify people to intimidate them yes and in fact there's
[41:57.960 --> 42:02.320]  another story which is coming out after the show ends which centers around
[42:02.320 --> 42:06.640]  Walton County Sheriff's Office and like hundreds of other local police
[42:06.640 --> 42:10.880]  departments they've got their hands on one of these m-wrap armored vehicles for
[42:10.880 --> 42:14.120]  basically next to nothing the cost to go and pick it up from the Department of
[42:14.120 --> 42:20.280]  Defense and what's so ludicrous about this example is this county Walton
[42:20.280 --> 42:25.840]  County is considered so idyllic that it was used as the setting for the 1998
[42:25.840 --> 42:30.840]  movie the Truman show to illustrate an area so perfect and quaint that it
[42:30.840 --> 42:36.200]  appeared to be fake so this is an area so perfect virtually crime-free it's
[42:36.200 --> 42:41.120]  described as and yet the police have just purchased a an armored vehicle that
[42:41.120 --> 42:45.200]  was used to hunt down insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan and basically that the
[42:45.200 --> 42:49.040]  residents are completely freaking out that complaining on the Facebook pages
[42:49.040 --> 42:54.260]  but again it shows you that they will purchase the the most thing is in high
[42:54.260 --> 42:58.680]  tech brutal technology and use it against towns and counties that are
[42:58.680 --> 43:04.280]  virtually crime-free perfect quaint areas which shows you exactly the purpose
[43:04.280 --> 43:07.760]  it's not to fight on dangerous criminals it's to intimidate the American
[43:07.760 --> 43:12.680]  people and you know the very definition of terrorism is when you use violence or
[43:12.680 --> 43:17.560]  the threat of violence to achieve political means and that's what they're
[43:17.560 --> 43:20.960]  doing with these they are deliberately terrorizing the public and at the same
[43:20.960 --> 43:24.080]  time you got Hillary Clinton talking about how anybody that believes that the
[43:24.080 --> 43:27.560]  Second Amendment is an absolute right is terrorizing the public know they're
[43:27.560 --> 43:30.920]  terrorizing the public with their militarized police state and they're
[43:30.920 --> 43:35.200]  intimidating people with that kind of rhetoric calling them terrorists we need
[43:35.200 --> 43:39.160]  to come up with a system where we can review the police the police are really
[43:39.160 --> 43:43.760]  out of control and in most cases you know you don't you can vote for a sheriff
[43:43.760 --> 43:48.560]  and you can get a sheriff out of office but the police chiefs are not elected so
[43:48.560 --> 43:52.640]  it's it's very difficult for us to get a foot in the door to try to get some
[43:52.640 --> 43:56.560]  oversight that's why I think the federal government has focused on the police
[43:56.560 --> 44:01.280]  departments to really militarize things before we run out of time because I've
[44:01.280 --> 44:04.320]  just got you here for this half hour I want to talk about this other article
[44:04.320 --> 44:10.000]  that went up today about this ex CIA officer who says that open source
[44:10.000 --> 44:15.480]  revolution is about to overthrow the global oligarchy yeah this is basically
[44:15.480 --> 44:18.640]  a continuation of the theme we were talking about yesterday it's an
[44:18.640 --> 44:24.440]  interview by the Guardian conducted with ex CIA spy Robert David Steele and it's
[44:24.440 --> 44:28.080]  a complex issue so people need to read the article but basically he's saying
[44:28.080 --> 44:33.320]  that we're gonna see a bottom-up grassroots voluntaryist network style
[44:33.320 --> 44:37.880]  revolution an open-source revolution which will be enough to defeat the
[44:37.880 --> 44:42.200]  hierarchical top-down imposed control that we're currently laboring on it so
[44:42.200 --> 44:46.120]  you know the tools of revolution are already in our hands and are going to
[44:46.120 --> 44:50.720]  become more potent in terms of self-empowerment and escape in the
[44:50.720 --> 44:55.360]  system so you know just as the internet has given us information freedom for
[44:55.360 --> 44:59.920]  example crypto currencies are going to provide us with financial freedom 3d
[44:59.920 --> 45:04.800]  printing is going to provide us with consumer freedom and all the made he
[45:04.800 --> 45:09.720]  basically makes the point that all the major preconditions for revolution and
[45:09.720 --> 45:13.800]  we talked about this yesterday with the food rights and so forth now exist in
[45:13.800 --> 45:17.840]  the United States Britain and other developed Western countries because the
[45:17.840 --> 45:23.160]  elites are rapidly losing control over the power of information itself and
[45:23.160 --> 45:27.520]  therefore finding it harder to maintain this centralized control over human
[45:27.520 --> 45:31.280]  beings so this technology this open-source revolution that he talks
[45:31.280 --> 45:36.040]  about is allowing us to become less dependent on the system we're seeing
[45:36.040 --> 45:40.520]  more grassroots voluntaryist networks of people working together with
[45:40.520 --> 45:45.160]  technology with crypto currencies and it's having the effects of making us
[45:45.160 --> 45:49.800]  less dependent on their rigged system so when you've got you know millions and
[45:49.800 --> 45:53.280]  millions of people working on this technology really smart people that's
[45:53.280 --> 45:57.240]  going to turn the tide and it doesn't matter how many armored vehicles they
[45:57.240 --> 46:02.600]  buy when the fundamental foundation of society is shifted and empowerment comes
[46:02.600 --> 46:07.000]  back to the people to the grassroots it's game over for anybody who wants this
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.160]  this global oligarchy yeah you know that that's I think the key thing is that
[46:11.160 --> 46:16.400]  can we out innovate them can we get the people who are top scientists who are
[46:16.400 --> 46:22.400]  top developers can we get them to work in their own interests instead of for
[46:22.400 --> 46:27.040]  the in the interest of a small elite who want to control everybody that's really
[46:27.040 --> 46:30.440]  I think the question and of course the high ground is going to be the internet
[46:30.440 --> 46:34.620]  it's going to be free speech and whether or not we can keep that out of the hands
[46:34.620 --> 46:37.720]  of the government the government is doing everything they can to attack it
[46:37.720 --> 46:40.840]  from every different angle I mean you've even got a key component of these
[46:40.840 --> 46:45.360]  trade agreements is essentially bringing an internet censorship in the name of
[46:45.360 --> 46:49.600]  copyright enforcement they couldn't get that passed in any of the legislatures
[46:49.600 --> 46:53.440]  in America or in Europe and so they're trying to bring that in in the back door
[46:53.440 --> 46:57.560]  in these trade agreements but then we also see a major realignment going on
[46:57.560 --> 47:01.920]  the United States within the with the FCC coming in and now asserting that it
[47:01.920 --> 47:05.800]  has control regulatory control over the internet and then trying to shut down
[47:05.800 --> 47:09.560]  net neutrality at the same time it appears that they're going to prove a
[47:09.560 --> 47:15.280]  merger of Comcast and so they're going to make this gigantic central centralized
[47:15.280 --> 47:20.600]  control from a corporate standpoint to try to control not only content but
[47:20.600 --> 47:23.800]  especially the pipelines of the internet so there's this is a battle that's
[47:23.800 --> 47:27.920]  going back and forth I think we need to get people to look at this we've had a
[47:27.920 --> 47:33.520]  lot of stories a lot of movies about soldiers who went to war for the highest
[47:33.520 --> 47:36.920]  motivations and then realize that they were being used that they had been
[47:36.920 --> 47:41.240]  betrayed that they'd been deceived and then doing the right thing I've not
[47:41.240 --> 47:45.160]  seen that so much about engineers and scientists the only time I can remember
[47:45.160 --> 47:48.240]  seeing that recently was in the latest born movie where you've got this
[47:48.240 --> 47:53.080]  scientist who starts talking about what she did to born and the other people and
[47:53.080 --> 47:56.440]  she gets this gleam in her eye she's very excited about the technological
[47:56.440 --> 48:00.480]  breakthrough that she came up with and and just the idea of what she's doing
[48:00.480 --> 48:05.160]  and then he kind of stares at her and she kind of pauses a moment and says oh
[48:05.160 --> 48:10.960]  yeah you know and kind of realizes has an aha moment about the consequences of
[48:10.960 --> 48:14.280]  her technology I think that's what we need to really drive home to scientists
[48:14.280 --> 48:19.280]  and engineers is to think about the consequences well precisely because
[48:19.280 --> 48:23.040]  technology is neutral it depends on who's in control yes but as you said
[48:23.040 --> 48:26.960]  it's it's regulation versus decentralization isn't it that's the
[48:26.960 --> 48:30.480]  battle and I think it's a battle that we can win and we are winning a quote
[48:30.480 --> 48:35.320]  really good quote out of the article is from steel is former CIA agent is top
[48:35.320 --> 48:39.040]  down power has failed in a most spectacular manner and bottom up
[48:39.040 --> 48:43.800]  consensus power is emergent not in my neighborhood is beginning to trump
[48:43.800 --> 48:48.120]  because I say so the one unlimited resource we have on this planet is the
[48:48.120 --> 48:52.680]  human brain so again he's talking about people rejecting the dictates of the
[48:52.680 --> 48:57.000]  organized oligarchy from above which is losing its power because it's losing the
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.800]  power to centralize control and that's causing the emergence of these
[49:00.800 --> 49:05.400]  decentralized networks that are using technology to help people free themselves
[49:05.400 --> 49:10.560]  and become less dependent on the state in terms of consumerism information and
[49:10.560 --> 49:14.680]  financial freedom so with all that coming together with technology improving
[49:14.680 --> 49:18.720]  that's the positive that's a really optimistic take that we can draw from
[49:18.720 --> 49:23.160]  this article and really encourage people to go and read it at the Guardian it's
[49:23.160 --> 49:27.000]  also linked on info wars and featured stories today yeah there's another quote
[49:27.000 --> 49:32.240]  in there he says open source everything makes truth rather than violence the
[49:32.240 --> 49:37.760]  currency of power and contrasting that to the you know because I say so at the
[49:37.760 --> 49:42.640]  point of a gun that's a key thing truth rather than violence as the currency of
[49:42.640 --> 49:45.840]  power boy I certainly hope that is what's going to happen because you know
[49:45.840 --> 49:50.760]  Paul I've spoken many times about the book the fourth turning by Strauss and
[49:50.760 --> 49:54.920]  how I think that that's very important research that they've they've gone back
[49:54.920 --> 49:59.520]  back to the middle 1400s through American and English history looking at a
[49:59.520 --> 50:04.040]  cycle that about every 80 years there's a massive generational is driven by
[50:04.040 --> 50:08.960]  generations and there's a massive change in society about every 80 years or so
[50:08.960 --> 50:14.160]  and we're coming up to that and that just so happens to coincide with the
[50:14.160 --> 50:18.960]  timeframe that so many of these central planners and futurist thinkers have been
[50:18.960 --> 50:24.080]  talking about with everything the 2020 to 2025 timeframe and they pretty much
[50:24.080 --> 50:29.320]  called what was going to happen in 2008 about 18 years before it happened they
[50:29.320 --> 50:31.440]  said they didn't know what was going to happen but it was going to be something
[50:31.440 --> 50:35.680]  big so yeah I want to get your take on that I want to cover that other article
[50:35.680 --> 50:40.360]  that went up today about the veteran who's getting harassed by his homeowners
[50:40.360 --> 50:43.960]  association when we come back from the break that's just pretty that's pretty
[50:43.960 --> 50:48.400]  amazing one of the reasons why I won't own a home where there's a homeowners
[50:48.400 --> 50:53.600]  association sometimes democracy gets out of control and it happens even at the
[50:53.600 --> 50:57.280]  lowest levels when you don't have protection for individual rights will be
[50:57.280 --> 51:02.280]  right back every business owner knows how tough it is to get financing for
[51:02.280 --> 51:05.680]  their business whether the cash is needed for expansion repairs or growth

[52:02.480 --> 52:06.640]  you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at my Patriots supply
[52:06.640 --> 52:10.680]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment frustrated with
[52:10.680 --> 52:14.160]  the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out
[52:14.160 --> 52:18.480]  for a quick buck deciding to take action a company run by Patriots for

[54:11.720 --> 54:18.120]  it's not a flag on a pole in fact it is barely noticeable it's a flag in a
[54:18.120 --> 54:23.760]  flower pot sitting right here at the front door and the HOA in this community
[54:23.760 --> 54:29.360]  is still in the homeowner the flag has got to go the homeowner is Larry Murphrey
[54:29.360 --> 54:35.400]  and he's drawn a line in the sand they're trying to it got a foreclosure on
[54:35.400 --> 54:40.000]  my house so the house could go so that's why the flags upside down
[54:40.000 --> 54:45.520]  Murphrey lives in the tides condominium at sweetwater the HOA allows flags to
[54:45.520 --> 54:50.880]  be flown in certain locations during daylight hours Murphrey fought the HOA
[54:50.880 --> 54:55.880]  several years ago and that case was settled they settled and I thought that
[54:55.880 --> 55:00.040]  would be the end of it but amazing story and I've got Paul Joseph Watson on the
[55:00.040 --> 55:04.560]  line he's got that story up on info wars.com a 73-year-old veteran threatened
[55:04.560 --> 55:08.440]  with foreclosure for displaying an American flag and of course this is his
[55:08.440 --> 55:12.240]  homeowners association that's coming after him Paul that's that's a pretty
[55:12.240 --> 55:15.400]  amazing story I've seen homeowners associations do some pretty outrageous
[55:15.400 --> 55:20.800]  thing they're trying to foreclose on him with an $8,000 lean that they put on
[55:20.800 --> 55:27.840]  him are fine. Yeah all for displaying a tiny American flag in a plant pot what's
[55:27.840 --> 55:32.240]  even more ludicrous about this story is this 70-year-old veteran Larry Murphrey
[55:32.240 --> 55:36.720]  actually settled out of court with them from a previous dispute about the same
[55:36.720 --> 55:41.320]  issue then they came back made another rule that specifically targeted him
[55:41.320 --> 55:46.680]  saying that homeowners couldn't have any unauthorized objects in their plant pots
[55:46.680 --> 55:52.120]  or foliage so of course then he violated that law even though it's his
[55:52.120 --> 55:56.160]  right to do so legal experts have said that the Florida statute says he can
[55:56.160 --> 56:01.920]  display the flag so they slapped him with an $8,000 fine he's been fined $100 a
[56:01.920 --> 56:06.280]  day for every day he displays this tiny flag which is barely noticeable and
[56:06.280 --> 56:10.840]  now they've as he said filed for foreclosure on his house so as he said
[56:10.840 --> 56:14.120]  before the break you know democracy doesn't always work out for the best
[56:14.120 --> 56:18.240]  this is why America's a republic why it has the Constitution to protect
[56:18.240 --> 56:23.600]  individual rights because you know that they're just go ahead I wonder if these
[56:23.600 --> 56:27.120]  are some people who've moved down to New York from Bloomberg's New York where
[56:27.120 --> 56:31.520]  they have just learned that you can just arbitrarily ban anything you don't like
[56:31.520 --> 56:35.960]  it's the size of the soda that you drink you don't like this guy's American
[56:35.960 --> 56:39.880]  flag you just ban it and they've got to get prior approval from you before they
[56:39.880 --> 56:45.160]  put it up I think that they're taking their mandate from the state from the
[56:45.160 --> 56:48.560]  government because of course we've had numerous stories over the past few years
[56:48.560 --> 56:52.960]  about cities harassing residents for having vegetable gardens in their
[56:52.960 --> 56:56.880]  front yard so whereas this isn't government this is homeowners association
[56:56.880 --> 57:00.960]  they're kind of taking their cue from that that oppressive tyranny that we've
[57:00.960 --> 57:04.640]  seen disallowing people from doing what they want to do having vegetable
[57:04.640 --> 57:07.920]  gardens and again it you know it represents this kind of clash between
[57:07.920 --> 57:12.040]  the mindsets of rugged individualism which is what most Americans used to
[57:12.040 --> 57:17.680]  embrace and this new kind of tattletail power trip collectivism the example for
[57:17.680 --> 57:22.320]  which is being set by the state so it's no surprise that this homeowners
[57:22.320 --> 57:26.760]  association is harassing this man for having this barely noticeable flag in
[57:26.760 --> 57:31.280]  his front yard and you know there might be more to it than just a little power
[57:31.280 --> 57:35.760]  trip by these people who may have a personal dispute with this guy as you
[57:35.760 --> 57:39.600]  pointed out in the article it was just last week that we had that happen in
[57:39.600 --> 57:44.320]  Texas in an apartment they said that this guy hanging an American flag from
[57:44.320 --> 57:49.720]  his balcony was an affront to the Muslim community you know American flags were
[57:49.720 --> 57:55.480]  told or an affront to Muslims to people who come here from Mexico and we just
[57:55.480 --> 58:00.720]  need to ban those things and hide that now and I've seen the same thing in
[58:00.720 --> 58:04.840]  Britain where it's it's now frowned upon to fly st. George's flag because it
[58:04.840 --> 58:09.080]  might offend some minorities and again in in Texas and other areas on Cinco de
[58:09.080 --> 58:12.480]  Mayo we've had students kicked out school for wearing American flag t-shirt so
[58:12.480 --> 58:16.280]  across the board they're frowning on the display of any kind of patriotism
[58:16.280 --> 58:20.920]  whatsoever that's right we've got to ban those symbols and that really touches on
[58:20.920 --> 58:24.240]  that article that you had yesterday which I encourage people to read that's up
[58:24.240 --> 58:28.840]  on a drudge today where he's talking about how they're bringing in the massive
[58:28.840 --> 58:33.160]  demographic surge because they want to educate these people from the bottom up
[58:33.160 --> 58:36.280]  and that's really what I think it's all about thank you so much Paul Joseph
[58:36.280 --> 58:43.560]  Watson from the UK we'll be right back thank you for listening to GCN visit
[58:43.560 --> 58:47.280]  GCNLive.com today
[58:48.720 --> 58:53.320]  what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday
[58:53.320 --> 58:57.680]  about a potential for hood situation the police are shoving people shoving Alex
[58:57.680 --> 59:02.800]  shoving the crowd whether it's the radio show the news websites
[59:02.800 --> 59:07.040]  documentary films of the nightly news and for wars is the tip of the spear is
[59:07.040 --> 59:10.240]  this another false-flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote
[59:10.240 --> 59:13.320]  homeland security by sticking the hands down on the fence on the streets it's up
[59:13.320 --> 59:17.440]  to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere and that's what

[59:22.760 --> 59:28.040]  blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels

[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:27.440]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones radio show I'm David Knight we're
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.520]  gonna be joined at the bottom of the hour by Alex Jones in the form of a
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.120]  special report America destroyed by design you want to stick around and
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:37.800]  hear that we also have Gerald Salenty joining us in the third hour we're gonna
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:42.720]  talk to him about breaking economic news of course Gerald Salenty of trends
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.240]  research is a great forecaster of economics and all kinds of trends he
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:53.000]  has a lot to say about the Iraq war I guess it's what now 11 years into it and
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.640]  we see what's happened with that so it's gonna be interesting to hear Gerald
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.480]  Salenty's comments on that now we've just had some breaking news has come out
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.200]  we've got a White House press secretary now this is the new guy you know they
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:09.480]  got rid of the Carney now they've got an earnest guy this guy is Josh Ernest and
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:13.320]  he's on it straight he says we're not going to wait and just said we're not
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.880]  going to just sit around and wait for Congress to write the laws that's right
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.960]  nobody's ever accused Obama of sitting around and waiting for the laws to be
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.480]  written they're just going to do whatever they wish and you know we've got a
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.480]  lot of examples of congressional scoff laws here I've got a whole little clip
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.480]  here of a bunch of these things we've got Nancy Pelosi scoffing at the idea
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:39.560]  that the House GOP would file a lawsuit she says not only have we not passed an
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:43.400]  immigration bill they have used the president's action to protect some
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:48.520]  vulnerable parties as a basis to sue the president well the question is you know
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:54.240]  would Obama really obey a new law on immigration I mean would Homeland
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:59.520]  Security obey the laws would the illegal aliens obey the laws I mean do we really
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:03.040]  need to worry about immigration reform I think we're just beyond that right we
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:08.160]  just do whatever the president wishes to do or whatever Homeland Security wants
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.120]  to see our country become they're going to make it happen that way whether it's
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:17.760]  legal or not and as Boehner said he said this isn't about impeachment it's about
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:22.120]  faithfully executing the laws of our country well you know I'd like to see
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:25.560]  Boehner faithfully execute the laws of this country and impeach this guy how
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:30.320]  many times does he have to break the law blatantly in our face declare that he's
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.600]  not going to wait for laws be passed he's just going to do whatever he wants
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.360]  how long does that have to go on you know we've got some more information
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:43.560]  coming out about the IRS we've got IRS officials we now learn we're thinking
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:49.160]  about doing an audit of a GOP senator that would be Chuck Grassley and what
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:55.240]  happened was these emails supposedly she claims the lady who lost all of her
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:03.760]  emails according to her she claims that somehow she got Chuck Grassley emails how
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:07.640]  do you figure that it's somehow they just got rerouted to her and she just
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.480]  happened to notice that he was doing something that she thought she could
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:17.320]  audit him for you know come on we've talked about this many times even if I
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.720]  did a special report talking about what are the probabilities of her
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.920]  disk drive going out you know even if you say that it's a normal disk drive we
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:29.200]  got a meantime between failure of five years what are the probabilities of her
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:34.760]  disk drive going out and six other people's going out at the same time that
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:40.680]  all have emails that people need for fraud investigation for criminal action
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:44.160]  what's the chances of that happening and then of course there were people who
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.720]  said that their disk drives were actually raid arrays that have a meantime
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:53.720]  between failure 500 years you know there's not a chance and not only that
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.840]  but we know that's giving them the benefit of the doubt saying that they're
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.200]  telling us the truth that it's stored only on their disk drives they're not
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.120]  stored on their disk drives we've got tweets now from the company that says
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:10.120]  that it did the IRS backups and of course they were required by law to back
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.840]  their data up they weren't just keeping it on their hard drives even if they were
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:18.080]  there's not a chance even if you take the chances of seven of these things
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:24.360]  going out at once is like 1 in 78,000 it's not a chance that's the truth but
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:27.440]  that's not what's happening they were being backed up by another company and
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.640]  so what we need to do is we need to hold them to the same standards that they
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.840]  hold other people you know you when you go to the IRS you're not presumed to be
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:39.600]  innocent you're presumed to be guilty if they have reason to believe if they
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.760]  bring charges against you you have to prove your innocence if you can't prove
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:48.280]  it they convict you that's what the house needs to do apply those same terms to
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:52.760]  them make them self-incriminate like they do taxpayers make them produce the
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:56.120]  records and if they get rid of their records and don't hold them they go to
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:01.440]  jail send them to jail John Boehner I've always believed in nutrition and herbs

[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:16.680]  need to know where we are and you need to know what the foundation of our
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:21.240]  liberty of our government of our country was based upon and that is that our
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:27.000]  rights come from God they're inalienable you can't take them it was laid out in
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.120]  the Declaration of Independence we create the government to protect those
[01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:37.720]  rights not to give us security if you give up your liberty for security you
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:43.040]  will be a slave slaves don't have any freedom and when you have maximum
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.440]  security that's what they call a prison and we're also going to be joined in the

[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:57.520]  we see a massive readjustment of decline in the gross domestic product from
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:03.040]  1% to 3% a lot of people are saying we're in a collapse and of course they're
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:07.120]  it's being spun in a lot of different ways by Obama and other people they're
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:13.120]  even talking about how we're going to save money with responses to global
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.960]  warming but if they're blaming it on everything except what the government is
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:20.680]  doing so we're going to be talking to Gerald Salenty about that also about
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:26.160]  his take on Iraq 11 years after this whole thing began as we see it folding

[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.840]  that things are coming together and there's so many the collapsing borders a
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.360]  collapsing economy the collapsing legal structure that we have in this country
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:54.240]  where people in the highest offices no longer even make a pretense of obeying
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:58.360]  the law and of course in the last new segment I just mentioned the latest
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.480]  press release where Obama's press secretary said we have no intention of
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.160]  waiting for laws to be passed we're going to pursue our own immigration policy
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.400]  it's like really I thought you were already I thought you and Homeland
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:12.680]  Security were doing your own thing independent of the laws independent of
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:16.480]  the Constitution but one of the ways that things are breaking down as we see
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.600]  also increased persecution and this is going on with the Communist Chinese of
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:26.960]  churches we have a story up on info wars.com from New American Alex Newman
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:32.160]  and he says the Chinese Communist regime is stepping up its war on churches
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:36.520]  hundreds of church buildings are torn down this year and leaders are arrested
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:44.680]  this is what happens to churches to people who will compromise and try to
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:49.480]  play along with government censorship and government control understand that in
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:54.660]  China there is a massive home church movement that is very vibrant that it's
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:58.600]  growing and those people are being persecuted that's the reason why it's
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.920]  vibrant and growing there's also a church movement in China that has
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:07.080]  essentially tried to play along with the government thinking that if they can
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:11.800]  collaborate with them if they can go along if they can you know cooperate
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:16.880]  they're going to be favored and they let them go along for a while they told
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:20.320]  them what they could and could not have in their Bible they didn't like the idea
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:25.160]  of Jesus being referred to as king they didn't like the idea of the Trinity they
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.960]  tried to get rid of the book of revelations a lot of different things
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:32.000]  I'm not an expert on it but I know that they have gotten these churches to
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.360]  compromise on this so they could get official recognition very similar to
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:41.480]  what happens here with churches who apply to the government for their 501
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:48.560]  c status and are told shut up don't talk about injustice don't talk about
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:53.920]  anything politically even if it has to do with life and death issues even if
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:59.400]  we're imprisoning a large portion of the population just tell your your people
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:04.120]  that it's it's good that we need the government to do things like have a war
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:09.560]  on drugs because we can't rely on the church to change people's hearts it's
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:16.560]  not really a soul issue or medical issue or psychological issue it's a law
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.960]  enforcement issue so you know when you when you go along with the government
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:24.920]  when you do what they tell you to do then eventually things come around like
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:29.040]  they have in China and they're saying of course the most shocking example was in
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:33.280]  late April where communist authorities demanded the destruction of a church in
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:39.200]  Seng Jing that was an officially sanctioned church a building they go in
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:44.680]  and they tear down this building over 1,000 people assembled there to try to
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:49.040]  protect it they tried to appeal it but they say the local branch of the regime
[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:54.320]  responded with 100 heavily armed SWAT officers there you go there's a SWAT
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:58.720]  teams again and paramilitary units before sending in machinery to tear down
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:04.360]  the five million dollar church building to the ground there's a lesson in that
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:08.560]  there's less than that for all of us in terms of compromise now I want to go
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.160]  over some of the Supreme Court decisions because they're coming out as fast and
[01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:16.280]  furious in these last few days the Supreme Court has released a couple of
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:21.880]  decisions yesterday one of them was a key decision about not being allowed to
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:28.800]  seize people's telephones without a search warrant and that leaves I think the NSA
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:33.280]  the CIA these fusion centers Homeland Security all these police departments
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.920]  that leaves them in a kind of weird position doesn't it because they're
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:44.040]  doing dragnet surveillance of everybody without a search warrant so where's this
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.880]  gonna go that's a very interesting court decision and I think that's going to put
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:52.840]  a foot in the door for a lot of people who want to try to get back our privacy
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:57.480]  and I expect to see that happen that was a unanimous decision they had another
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:02.720]  unanimous decision today but this is one that wasn't unanimous this is where
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:06.440]  the US Supreme Court strikes down Massachusetts abortion buffer zone law
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:11.200]  they had put up a law that put a buffer zone around abortion clinics where
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:17.320]  protesters could not go you know free speech zones free speech areas we saw
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:22.640]  that at the Bundy Ranch in Bunkerville you know where they put up a little
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:28.600]  plastic fence around an area out in the middle of nowhere I mean it literally
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:33.560]  was in the middle of nowhere and then put a print it up an official sign and
[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:38.280]  said free speech area somebody put up a handwritten sign next to that said the
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:44.680]  first amendment is not an area and we've seen that happen not just at Bunkerville
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:49.960]  we've seen that happen at the last couple of presidential conventions both
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:54.200]  Republican and Democrat and we've covered that how they put protesters far
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:58.200]  away from the convention center literally put them in cages there's a
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:03.880]  picture of that that plastic fence and first amendment area yeah the first
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:07.640]  amendment is not an area and so it's good that the Supreme Court said that as
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:11.640]  well we need to fight for our rights and you know the people who want to take
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.200]  away your first amendment rights want to take away your second amendment your
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:17.600]  fourth amendment your due process rights they want to take everything they're
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:21.600]  not going to be satisfied with any of this stuff and free speech is where we
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:27.640]  really wake people up now they also came back with a unanimous decision saying
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:30.920]  that Obama violated the Constitution with his recess appointments the curtain
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:35.120]  memo has an article up that I think has got the best background and analysis of
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:40.000]  this of anybody else we've got that on info wars.com he points out curtain
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.840]  memo points out that Obama made 32 recess appointments and in comparison
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:50.360]  Ronald Reagan did 232 and Bill Clinton and George Bush did more than a hundred
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:56.120]  each so it really is about attempting to restore a constitutional balance to the
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:01.840]  executive branch what Republicans had done to try to stop Obama from just
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:06.240]  appointing whatever judges he wanted to without any Senate oversight which is the
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:10.560]  way the Constitution is set up what they had done was to set up pro forma
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:14.880]  sessions according to Kurtz article to prevent Obama from making recess
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.920]  appointments and circumventing the Congress and in response then of course
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:22.240]  Harry Reid and the Democrats changed the rules they're all about changing the
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:28.000]  rules getting rid of the rules in the Senate to have filibusters which was a
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.120]  good thing it's a good thing to take your time to think about this and to have
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:37.160]  some control over the discussion but they want to just rush everything through
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:41.520]  without a discussion they want Obama to appoint make all these appointments to
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:47.840]  the in this case it was a national labor board and this was a nine to nothing
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:53.440]  decision again today and what they said was the Congress the Senate is in
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:57.520]  session when the Senate says that it's in session so they basically struck that
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:02.400]  down and curtain emos analysis is exactly right this is one area where
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:06.880]  Obama hadn't been able to do quite as many in the past I think it's not
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:12.600]  because he didn't want to or didn't have the desire to go around the
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.360]  Constitution but I think it's just because of that tactic that the
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:19.440]  Republicans had come up with to stop that but now that tactic has been shut
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:24.720]  down but the Supreme Court has said no you have to we're gonna balance that
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:30.160]  power a little bit now there's some other things happening that I think really
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:37.120]  shine where the real risk is coming to us from these technological advances
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:42.600]  there's a DC cab drivers are choking the streets in protest of uber and I want

[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:19.920]  gonna have Alex joining us with a special report at the bottom of the hour
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:25.960]  digital slave currency and he's gonna go back to his very first film America
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:30.240]  destroyed by design and he's going to show you how what he was talking about
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:36.320]  way back then is happening now and of course it focused around the driving
[01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:41.600]  license biometric identification the government is all about control nodes
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:47.520]  and transportation is a major control node and we should keep that in mind when
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:51.680]  we're looking at this dispute that's going on all over the world now between
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:56.440]  taxicab companies and uber you know a lot of people who are free market who are
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:02.760]  libertarian reflexively kind of take the side of somebody who is trying to
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:06.840]  break into the business of being a taxi driver mainly because for the longest
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.280]  time we've seen Jitney cab services that were servicing minority areas going into
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:16.640]  areas where regular taxicab companies would not go we see them struggling with
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:21.800]  the local governments who are trying to enforce a monopoly by the cab company so
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:24.880]  there was this established businesses trying to work with the government to
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:27.920]  keep competition out of the way and we see that happening whether it's
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:31.580]  restaurants we see that happening in many many different industries and so a
[01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:35.720]  lot of libertarians and free market people would instinctively side with
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:39.440]  the up-and-comer the guy who's trying to get in who's trying to make things
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:43.840]  better but we're seeing protests all over the world throughout Europe they had a
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.920]  massive protest in London I think it's 12,000 cabs at one point protested uber
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:52.800]  we see now this happened just yesterday in the district of Columbia in
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:58.040]  Washington says cab drivers choke the streets to protest ride share companies
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:02.200]  I guess the question since I've been to Washington many times is how do you know
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:06.040]  when they're choking the streets as a protest and when it's just typical
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:11.160]  Washington DC traffic I mean that place is impossible to get through but what's
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:15.960]  going on with this is that you've got these companies like Lyft and like uber
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:21.800]  who are essentially setting up ride share operations doing it through high
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:27.280]  tech apps that you can use on your phone to bring in taxi cab companies and some
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:31.920]  people are making some pretty good money as uber drivers but they ought to look
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:37.640]  at what the long-term plan is here as the uber CEO puts it out there's an
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:41.360]  article from the Boston Herald where they talked about uber and they talked
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:46.920]  about Google steering big changes is what they said and here's a quote from
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:52.800]  the uber CEO Travis Kalanick and he said the reason uber could be expensive is
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:56.320]  because you're not just paying for the car you're paying for the other dude in
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:27:00.960]  the car now when there's no other dude in the car the cost of taking an uber
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:05.000]  anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle so the magic there is you
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.960]  basically bring the cost below the cost of ownership for everybody and then car
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:17.680]  ownership goes away you know that car ownership goes away now in other quotes
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:22.000]  this guy has also kind of channeled Melissa Harris Perry when he says we've
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.280]  got to get over the notion that cars are privately owned hardware they should
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:32.080]  be community owned transportation vehicles where this guy is going this is
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:36.680]  they've got the unions fighting the taxi drivers fighting against the uber
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:41.680]  drivers they love to do this divide and conquer but uber has an overreaching
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:47.160]  strategy uber and Google they want not self-driving cars let's get rid of that
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:51.200]  terminology you're not you're driving yourself right now you're probably
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:54.800]  driving down the road listening to me and you're driving your car you've got
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:58.120]  truck drivers out there who are making a living you got taxi drivers out there
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:02.520]  who make a living in the transportation business that's going to go away
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:08.200]  according to their version what uber wants is what all of these large
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:14.000]  multinational corporations want and that is to own everything see there's a
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.560]  level of fascism at the top and then they're at the bottom for us we get
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:23.400]  communism so you've got companies like uber and they just had a massive
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:28.960]  fundraising where they they they raised $1.2 billion they now have
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:33.920]  evaluation of $17 billion they plan on raising 200 million more that's
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:38.160]  according to venture beat calm and of course they're being fought with all
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:41.120]  these different lawsuits and all these different jurisdictions and state
[01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:45.560]  agencies but here's where he sees it going he sees it going to a situation
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:52.520]  where he owns all the transportation and the cars are not self-driven cars they
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:58.760]  are computer driven cars and they are government controlled cars see when the
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:02.840]  computers are driving the cars the government is going to control when and
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:05.560]  where you can go certain areas are going to be off limits to you just like
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.920]  they're going to be off limits to your cell phone or to your laptop they're
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:12.600]  going to know where you are and shut down those cell phones shut down those
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:17.080]  laptops maybe they'll do it to you individually you know they have that
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:21.480]  capability going back to the 2008 patent from Apple and now we see Samsung and
[01:29:21.480 --> 01:29:24.960]  other companies putting that on the Android platform they want to be able
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:30.600]  to selectively shut you down see transportation is a control node for the

[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:12.320]  have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:16.560]  even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using

[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:31.400]  with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to research these
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:35.640]  statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in

[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:09.240]  of my predictions unfortunately are coming true and it's not because I had a
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:13.680]  crystal ball it's because the social engineers the control this planet to a
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:21.560]  great extent have been open about the social engineering that they are
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:30.400]  engaged in. They have been extremely honest about their plans to create a
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:34.920]  totally controlled society where humans basically operate and act like
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:41.840]  biological androids. Synthetic reality to bring synthetic consciousness that is
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:46.680]  no form of consciousness at all. Now I'm not against technology. Technology has
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:51.720]  been neutral for thousands of years whether it was the wheel or before that
[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:58.080]  fire a sword can be used for good it can be used for bad a butcher knife can be
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:02.880]  used for good or bad so I'm not anti-technology but in the last hundred
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:08.880]  years most Western technology has been developed and deployed for social
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:14.880]  engineering purposes. Everything we now use today from cell phones to smart
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:20.480]  meters to quote smart appliances is being used to track everything you do to
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:25.520]  manipulate prices to gouge you to surveil you and to take that data and to
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:31.400]  put it into big aggregate systems to literally be able to predict the future
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:36.240]  and fix markets. This is the dream of the monopoly capitalist who are the
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:41.320]  opposite of free market capitalist that all free peoples continually wage war
[01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:45.400]  against. It was the globalist Carol Quigley at Georgetown that famously said
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:49.540]  they'll work with fascist socialist communists or just dictators as long as
[01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:55.280]  it's centralized they don't like freedom they want to have controlled markets
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:59.960]  so they can dominate the future of the species and you've seen how they've been
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:06.560]  the prime drivers and authors of most of our woes. Now I wanted to start doing a
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:11.400]  feature here on the show once a week every two weeks or so sometimes maybe
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:17.880]  once a month it'll vary where we go back into the archive and pull up some of the
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:23.920]  things that I said a year ago or two years ago or five years ago or 15 16 17
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:34.800]  years ago and that's the case from 1997 almost 17 years ago I wanted to
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:39.960]  illustrate that biometrics were being put in at drivers license facilities to
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:45.200]  bring in a unified federal national ID card to set up domestic checkpoints on
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:51.920]  highways and at airports to bring in an internal police system that is now being
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:56.160]  deployed at airports part of trusted traveler where you opt into it soon it
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:00.240]  will be mandatory it's used to track everywhere you go if you're not a good
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:04.520]  globalist they turn your thumbprint off and you can not buy or sell anymore
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:08.080]  that's why they're trying to get rid of farmers markets kids selling lemonade
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:12.000]  they want you only go into big box stores that are going to be part of this
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:20.520]  control grip and so now 17 years later we see states like Virginia and the
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:24.800]  District of Columbia by Virginia saying we want to make you do a drug test and
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:29.040]  give urine or blood to get a driver's license guilty into preventive
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:35.840]  exactly what Bill Clinton put down in an executive order back in 1996 now they
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:39.880]  never fully realized all that but it shows us where they wanted to go and
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:45.880]  most of what they wanted to do back then has now actually happened so I wanted to
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:52.840]  play from my first film America destroyed by design something that is quite
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:56.600]  famous on the internet but still a lot of people don't know about it my arrest
[01:36:56.600 --> 01:37:02.920]  for illustrating that biometrics was coming as a dehumanizing control system
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:06.720]  the police officer the state police officer that arrested me later
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:11.440]  apologized to me years later and said he knows that I'm right this is a system
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:15.480]  of total control I ran into him down at the Capitol years later at a
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:20.080]  demonstration there face scanning technology is going to be used to totally
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:24.600]  control every aspect of our life it's rolling out they want web IDs where
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:28.400]  you'll get on the internet with a face scan or a thumb print Microsoft admits
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:32.520]  that Facebook admits that and then three strikes you're out no judge no jury no
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:36.560]  indictment if big companies say you've done something wrong only on the
[01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:41.680]  internet three times like the YouTube model you are then banned off of the
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:45.760]  internet that's what Google's doing trying to get that database making you
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:50.800]  give them your cell phone your home phone your IDs with your Google ID tied
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:55.480]  to your email and your YouTube and and and to your Google wallet so when
[01:37:55.480 --> 01:38:00.200]  you're not a good globalist you can just be turned off this is the type of
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:05.440]  system that would make Adolf Hitler Joseph Stalin or Mao Zedong have a
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:12.320]  literal wet dream this is the Trojan horse tools that are completely
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:15.800]  enslaving our society just look at some of these headlines Obama
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:21.920]  administration launches plan to make internet ID a reality to tax you to
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:27.160]  track you to turn you off if they don't want to with all a very legal spying
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:33.320]  which they denied for decades which they now admit Facebook Walmart set sites on
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:38.400]  face scanning to buy and to sell South China Morning Post Facebook Apple to
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:44.360]  help draft face scanning rules amid privacy fears nightclub goes for face
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:48.240]  scanning security this is happening in Texas it's happening in Melbourne
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:54.000]  Australia it's a global grid oh you had five beers today the police know they're
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.760]  hooked in to the face scanner at the bar they're trying to force locals to wire
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:03.560]  their security cameras in by law in New York and other states to this it's a
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:08.480]  global technocracy grid run by the globalist or bad people this could be
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:13.000]  human empowering the problem is it's being designed and deployed and rolled
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.240]  out from the beginning from an authoritarian bent ladies and gentlemen
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:21.760]  another article White House wants shiny style ID system for internet users
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:25.920]  again off face scanning and thumb printing to control and track everything
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:30.800]  you do vehicle miles traveling tax proposed guess what's already in all
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:35.600]  the cars universally worldwide from Japan to the US the satellite tracker box
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:41.440]  hooked into a cell phone in the belly of your car to tax you by the mile see how
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:45.400]  everything I predicted set coming because I didn't predict it the globalist at
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:50.520]  MIT admitted all this when I was warning people back in the mid-1990s
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:56.000]  biometric security being promoted as if the public wants it oh biometric
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:02.560]  security can't come soon enough for some people is the headline it goes on and
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:07.640]  on and on the idea that won't die out taxing cars with a mile is back on the
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:12.160]  agenda and they have the boxes in the cars take a peek biometric security
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:17.080]  offers relief from passwords that's right oh the government releases the
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:22.600]  passwords the government releases the worms and the viruses that break in and
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:26.720]  steal your password and give it to hackers that's been in the news show
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:32.280]  that they discredit passwords and force you to go to a thumb print an iris scan
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:37.560]  which that imprint can just as easily be stolen all it is is a list of digital
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:43.040]  numbers or a digital algorithm it's even easier to defraud the thumb print or the
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:47.960]  eye scan because you can't ever change that password and that's all been proven
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:52.800]  to be a fraud as well here's another one DHS to test face scanning cameras at
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:57.840]  Tri-City hockey game again with checkpoints and people searching you
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:04.000]  at the checkpoints supposedly because of al-qaeda and other groups that they
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:10.600]  publicly arm fund and run in Syria Libya Iraq and other areas again a criminal
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:16.720]  technocracy creating crises or exacerbating crises like Rahm Emanuel
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:21.280]  White House chief of staff famously said now the Chicago mob boss and Don they
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:27.560]  don't want to let a good crisis go to waste you never want a serious crisis to
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:31.720]  go to waste and what I mean by that it's an opportunity to do things that you
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:37.760]  think you could not do before again it's not the technologies bad our
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:41.680]  technology has been developed and deployed for a hundred years to carry
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:46.360]  out dehumanization to carry out eugenics look at who founded IBM top
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:51.080]  Nazi Thomas Watson look at who runs all these systems find out who Bill and
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:54.920]  Melinda Gates are find out about their own statements Warren Buffett then you'll
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:59.360]  understand why the technology is driving in this direction because these people
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:02.720]  believe they're gonna merge with the machines and become God as Ray Kurzweil
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:09.320]  the head of Google technology has said let's go ahead and now go back to 1997
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:15.360]  where I got arrested to draw attention you know some fools out there say Alex
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:19.760]  you got fingerprinted you got arrested ah ha ha you were trying to get around
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:23.480]  fingerprinting no I wasn't trying to get around fingerprinting I wasn't putting
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:28.400]  superglue on my thumb to fool the biometrics I was trying to stop the
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:34.520]  collection of biometrics and the national ID card to begin with I was
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:39.800]  warning about things they wouldn't even admit existed at the time and we did
[01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:44.240]  succeed in raising public awareness to where we now have a good shot of
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:50.920]  changing all of this today all right enough from Alex Jones in 2014 let's go
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:58.440]  back to 1997 and then we'll come back to the future and David Knight after this
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:03.200]  time capsule all right they're ready for me let's go come over and get the
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:08.000]  pretty little red light come on pretty and they'll put a nice little clinic in
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.160]  here in the next few years for urine and blood testing like Clinton wants what
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:14.720]  do I have to hide I'm a criminal there we have it nice little pretty red light
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:20.600]  get that money here we have it your photograph they capture your
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:24.640]  signature they capture your thumb print and now Clinton wants urine and blood
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:28.600]  and I've given that to the media the actual federal register that he wants
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:32.600]  the states to implement and I guess it tells them how to put clinics in and it
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:37.280]  tells them how to urine and blood test law-abiding citizens not under 18 like the
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:43.840]  media says how you doing I am here with eight forms of identification I have my
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:47.400]  passport here is that my name and the form you asked me to fill out I have no
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:52.600]  criminal record my name is Alexander emrick jones here is my passport here
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:58.880]  is my insurance here is another form of ID here is my old driver's license here
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:03.960]  is my birth certificate and here is my w2 form and here is two more insurance
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:06.720]  cards all the ones just so you can double check it since the health club card
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:10.960]  ID okay to go we're gonna get you right now need you to answer these first three
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:13.760]  questions look at these questions there and go good things so I don't have to
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:17.400]  thumb scan well we're gonna get to that you are eventually going to have to yes

[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:27.720]  process why required it's required by Bill Clinton in 1992 and it was
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:31.280]  instituted here in Texas in 1993 I know the code sir are you gonna institute
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:34.400]  his urine and blood testing when he commands you are you gonna stick a

[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:53.320]  travel if I do not submit to this digital thumb scanning what I will tell
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:57.200]  you that you will not receive it if you get driver's license if you do not say it
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:01.320]  to a thumb plan okay look I feel like I'm being raped here well I would sit down
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:05.120]  you for hours try to do what I could then just give me my license without
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:09.320]  digitally thumb scanning I am not going to violate because is there a religious
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:17.200]  exception is the religious exception everyone must take the mark a digitally

[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:34.720]  Bill Clinton's law isn't it it's an executive order it's a decree by Bill
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:40.920]  Clinton NCIC yeah and I drive without a license what's what's the penalties for
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:43.840]  driving without a license you know I don't even want to go there that's right
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:47.040]  you know why I'm asking you doesn't pertain to it you're an officer I'm
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:50.680]  asking you the law I would be glad to say so you're saying I'll be committing a
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:56.840]  crime by driving if I don't take your mark I would be glad to do anything we'll
[01:45:56.840 --> 01:46:01.680]  see you're saying not against you the officer of art yours you're sitting here
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:05.480]  sergeant and telling me that you're all friendly and you're all nice but I'll be
[01:46:05.480 --> 01:46:08.880]  pulled over and given tickets if I don't pay those I will go to jail because I
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:14.520]  because of my morals and and my beliefs I will not take this and I'm here to tell
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:17.160]  you already took this a 93 and many people will say well you've already
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:20.560]  taken it what's your problem with it because now I figured out what this is
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:24.160]  and I'm opposing all those others that are being heard in here like cattle to
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:28.840]  be thumb scanned like criminals yes we don't even need to start there if I know
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:32.080]  that you're not going to submit to a thumb fan why waste your time see right
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:36.080]  up front they will drop and people are being turned away all day here so you're
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:40.840]  saying I pay my taxes I'm raped by the IRS which is criminal you know it's
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:47.240]  well known submit you just said I must submit I'm telling you I've never been

[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:57.080]  license I am not a criminal I may become one today but that's fine you're saying
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:03.560]  you're saying you won't take me to jail at five if I'm still here oh yeah this is
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:08.720]  against the grain of the Constitution look if I don't take the mark my right
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:12.560]  to travel is taken you're taking my rights and telling me that it's no big
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:16.720]  deal and now you want a urine and blood test bring me the the the the document
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:20.600]  who has the urine and blood testing document I need it I'm gonna pass these
[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:25.800]  out to people that ladies and gentlemen the federal register Bill Clinton
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:30.080]  urine and blood testing plan for you tell your friends about it we have got
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:34.640]  to stand against this the steps are preparing to implement this plan this is
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:38.280]  not a joke this is not the entire document it gets worse ladies and
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:45.960]  gentlemen ladies and gentlemen it's a joke to them only coach penders matters
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:51.960]  only diversions like Rome the gladiators if I don't take this if I don't take
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:56.400]  this will I not be penalized for not having a driver's license by not being
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:59.120]  able to cash a check by being given tickets that if I don't pay those
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:02.520]  tickets I'll be taken to jail I can't travel out of state I can't get on board
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:06.320]  an airplane and the media is talking about thumb scanning to travel you're
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:09.480]  working with the foreign banks and the military industrial complex this is all
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:14.920]  their idea read the military war college from 1968 they plan this just because
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:19.320]  you lay around doesn't mean it's not true this is not a publicity stunt I was a
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:23.320]  lot happier years ago before I got into all this garbage I'm sick of sheep
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:30.000]  laying down I wish you'd get up and do something our forefathers went to World
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.680]  War two and World War one and fought the Civil War in slavery and it means
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:38.840]  nothing to y'all we're a bunch of yellow belly weaklings I'm sick of it I'm
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:43.560]  sick of people laying down like a bunch of jellyfish and rationalizing what's
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:52.000]  going on people ought to be ashamed of themselves yes exactly now look very
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:57.680]  carefully at Mike Cox he is head public information officer for all of Texas for
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:02.560]  the DPS they weren't gonna arrest me but about 15 minutes into the protest he
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:07.280]  showed up and things changed dramatically he walked up stared at me
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:10.800]  turned walked back to the back they had a little meeting together and then they
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:15.920]  came and arrested me yeah right now I will be forced to arrest her I'm here
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:18.960]  to get a driver's license I have never had a criminal record it's time to go
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:44.240]  here I go get my stuff for me
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:31.840]  the DPS was very professional but they did the classic bait and switch they
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:35.080]  got all the troopers on one side of the building and made us think that I was
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:47.840]  coming out there I hope we painted you a picture of what's really happening here
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:51.960]  in the nation I got out of jail at night of the Class C misdemeanor and I'm

[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:21.440]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight and that was Alex's
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:25.400]  report which is now up digital slave currency that's on the Alex Jones
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:29.360]  channel on YouTube you can see that pass that around to people and as Alex
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:33.400]  pointed out in that report we're talking about how they're setting up
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:37.720]  checkpoints now as he had predicted years and years ago in that very first
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:41.840]  documentary setting up checkpoints at airports on highways getting people's
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:47.360]  identity it's a point of control that's what transportation is it's a very
[01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:52.000]  important control node for the government they always seek to control the
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:57.280]  transportation and of course there there are parallels to see said being in a
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:02.160]  house arrest and being taken out of the internet with a three strikes in your
[01:55:02.160 --> 01:55:07.000]  out type of policy but you could be under house arrest literally if they shut
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.240]  down your ability to move around and that was what I was talking about just
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:16.160]  before his report and that is the coming of the computer driven government
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:21.000]  controlled cars they like to call them self-driving cars no we have self-driving
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:24.080]  cars now they're going to be driven by computers and if you think they're going
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:28.800]  to be safer then you've never experienced the blue screen of death or you've never
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:33.840]  used Google map apps or Apple map apps to know that they don't always get you
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:38.040]  where you want to go but of course even Obama Obama was to cut down even that
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:43.320]  access if you use that as a human you're dangerous so one of the ways that they're
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:47.080]  going to control they're going to push us into this transportation control is
[01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:51.200]  they're going to ban humans from being able to drive cars by high insurance
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:54.320]  rates by saying that you can't use navigation you can only have navigation
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:58.080]  there if the computer is doing it they'll constantly monitor where you are
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:02.680]  they'll be able to restrict where you go when you go maybe restrict your travel
[01:56:02.680 --> 01:56:06.920]  completely if you're somebody that they want to put under house arrest a very
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:11.240]  dangerous thing and it is much much closer than you think the beginning of
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:14.160]  this year there were a lot of articles saying that well the technology is here
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:17.640]  we've got all the major car companies with self-driving cars but they have to
[01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:21.800]  have somebody setting in the seat to take control of the steering wheel they
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:27.760]  said the real hurdles the real obstacles are legal obstacles and so what we saw
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:32.800]  was in April very quickly the European Union as well as of course California
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:37.080]  removed these legal restrictions saying they're going to allow starting next
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:41.200]  year it's a race between the European car companies and the American car
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:45.560]  companies in Google as to who can produce the first quote-unquote self-driving
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:49.600]  cars now Google has put out a little clown car that doesn't have a brake
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:52.400]  pedal doesn't have a gas pedal doesn't have a steering wheel you just get in it
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:55.920]  and I guess it's got a control panel where you tell it where you want to go
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:59.800]  they've put that out as a demo that's their vision of the future and of course
[01:56:59.800 --> 01:57:03.480]  the other part of their vision of the future is to completely remake the
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:08.200]  economy with just a few people controlling everything a kind of neo
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:13.600]  feudalism that's what I believe is behind this it's neo feudalism for the
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:16.600]  corporations that are in bed with the government and of course the government
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:21.680]  gets to exercise complete control I think it's kind of betrayed in the name
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:26.800]  and the quotes of the CEO from uber when he says we're going to get beyond the
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:31.480]  idea of individual car ownership we're going to stop viewing cars as some
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:35.200]  hardware that is individually owned and it's going to be community controlled
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:38.680]  vehicles it's a very dangerous thing they're going to sell it to you with
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:42.160]  safety they always sell you safety and security but you know what when you give
[01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:46.440]  up your freedom when you give up your liberty when you live in a controlled
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:51.560]  state you're not free they're going to make humans more dependent more helpless
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:55.400]  and more controlled with this transportation method and coming in three
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:58.560]  to five years what you're going to see is these people who are now fighting uber
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:01.720]  because they want to have taxicab companies or they want to have jitney
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:06.000]  companies or they're in the transportation industry they're going to lose their
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.240]  jobs it's going to be massive displacement when they start self-driving the
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:15.600]  trucks that's something to think about is something to push back against it's
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:19.280]  fine if you want to get into a limousine and have it take you around by
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:24.520]  computer but you should not be compelled to do that you should not be forced to
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:28.120]  do that that's what they're going to do well stay tuned because up in the next
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:32.040]  hour we're going to have gerald salinity and we're going to talk about economic
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:36.040]  trends we're going to talk about the world hegemony trends and what's happened

[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:25.120]  Alex Jones welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'm going to
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:28.440]  join in the next segment with Gerald Salenty and one of the things I want
[02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:32.200]  to talk to him about is of course economic trends he covers trends in a
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:37.200]  wide variety of areas before I get to that though there's some breaking news
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:41.640]  that's up on info wars dot com from Jonathan Oosting NRA celebrates new
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:46.560]  Michigan laws exempting gun records from public disclosure now the interesting
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:50.040]  thing about this is that when you compare it to the other article that's
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:54.760]  another article up on info wars dot com from Mikhail Thalin where the SWAT team
[02:00:54.760 --> 02:01:00.840]  in Massachusetts is refusing a freedom of information request from the ACLU
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:04.720]  saying we're a private organization we're not going to give you any
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:10.800]  statistics about what we do or how often we do it and totally closing them
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:16.680]  off and to which the ACLU said well if you are truly a private organization
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:20.360]  then you're breaking the law but contrast that to what was going on in
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:26.160]  Michigan you had people in Michigan this this law in Michigan as well as is
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:30.600]  response to what was going on in New York as well where people were using
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:35.440]  freedom of information request to get information about individual gun owners
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:40.560]  that's not what FOIA was about FOIA was there to give us transparency and
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:45.440]  insight into what our government is doing not to let us spy on our neighbors
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:50.000]  so they're celebrating the fact that they now have a new Michigan law that will
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:54.080]  protect gun records these are private records they should not be subject to
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:58.240]  FOIA requests there's no reason for the public to have that information if you
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:01.200]  look at that article there's a great picture on there of a gun done by
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:05.840]  somebody named Travis Knight my son I think it's a great picture now Gerald is
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:09.040]  going to be joining us and just a little bit Gerald Salenty and of course
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:13.880]  yesterday we had some economic revision you know they love to revise these
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:18.120]  economic numbers as they go along they give us one number and then the next
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:20.640]  quarter they say well you know it was actually worse than we thought but now
[02:02:20.640 --> 02:02:25.560]  it's improving well this was a major revision a article that's up on info
[02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:30.920]  worst.com says the US economy has collapsed this is a monstrous negative
[02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:34.320]  revision we're not talking about a recession we're talking about a collapse
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:39.880]  and that's by Max Slavo now other people have reported on this we've got market
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:44.160]  watch saying the economy stumbles on a first quarter historic fall they say
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:50.520]  the 2.9% drop in GDP is the biggest during economic expansion since World
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:54.320]  War two that kind of puts it in perspective we see another one here
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:58.680]  from Bloomberg they say well it's the most in five years you know you can pick
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:03.320]  your points to try to make to make it read any way you want to but then of
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:07.160]  course Obama wants it to look as though it's anybody's fault but his own and
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:11.480]  this is an article from the federalist.com they say the economy tanked
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:15.640]  last quarter and it's everybody's fault but Obama and they point out how the
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:20.320]  liberal organizations like think progress and of course Huffington Post will
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:24.320]  come in and say hey it was good that things didn't fall as much as we thought
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:27.800]  because and one of the reasons is because healthcare spending is on the rise
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:31.840]  that's a good thing and as he points out in this article he said hey I thought
[02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:36.720]  Obamacare was supposed to reduce our healthcare costs of course it wasn't
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:40.600]  it was there to make profits for the insurance companies that wrote it and
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:44.560]  then of course this tweet from Huffington Post Obamacare just saved the
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:49.840]  economy from contraction but then they find out that it's not 1% decline but
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:56.200]  it's now a 3% decline so now they got to find a cause well guess what the cause
[02:03:56.200 --> 02:04:01.800]  was the weather it was the winter you know it was very cold winter and of
[02:04:01.800 --> 02:04:05.640]  course marketwatch.com picks up on that they said the cold weather costs the
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:11.560]  US economy about $15 billion maybe and they're a little bit skeptical because
[02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:17.240]  this is a yet another revision and of course there are many other factors but
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:20.240]  of course Obama jumps in with the weather but he has a completely different
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:26.480]  take on it okay he's going to save the economy and save us with global warming
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:30.800]  measures okay he says his initiatives are going to combat global warming and
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:34.920]  save consumers more than $60 billion in energy costs this is the Washington
[02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:38.480]  Post's take on that well of course you're going to then pay twice that amount of
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:42.080]  money if you really do save it on energy costs you're going to pay twice that
[02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:47.360]  amount of money and carbon taxes to people who are private organizations it's
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:50.880]  going to be a kind of indulgence that will pay them for all the energy that
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:54.520]  we use but of course the energy prices are not going to go down because they're
[02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:58.280]  shutting down power plants everywhere but you've got the Washington Post the
[02:04:58.280 --> 02:05:02.560]  New York Times LA Times pushing that there to stay with us super male

[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:56.240]  looming heavy because that's a major factor that is driving the people the
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:59.760]  people who are making the decisions who are pushing us into war and he has a lot
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:06.320]  to say about that but Gerald welcome thanks for joining us I wanted to first
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:10.760]  before we get into the articles that you've got here you've got one article
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:14.960]  Washington is driving the world to the final war I want to get your comments
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:18.320]  on that have you fleshed that out for the audience but before we get to that I
[02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:22.720]  want to get your take on this major revision in the economy yesterday from
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:28.440]  a GDP decline of 1% to all of a sudden tripling it to 3% and one of the
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:31.880]  publications point out that's the largest decline during expansion since
[02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:37.360]  World War two yeah it's also the greatest revision that's ever been done
[02:10:37.360 --> 02:10:45.720]  yeah 1976 yeah and so you know by the way the winter up here in the east was
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:49.480]  terrible it was one of the worst I ever remember in my life so there's no
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:55.720]  question that it hit the markets mm-hmm however the story is bigger than that
[02:10:55.720 --> 02:11:00.960]  because you keep looking at the numbers so let's say we even cut off you know we
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:07.080]  cut it in half it was still down by let's say 1.5 percent now this is after
[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:12.560]  dumping trillions and trillions and countless trillions into the economy to
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:17.800]  prop it up it's not working there's other numbers that came out today that
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:25.520]  verify it and here are some of them you start looking at consumer spending well
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:33.880]  it was down they expected it to increase it didn't now I'm also hearing from one
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:39.480]  of the Fed chair with the Fed presidents say that interest rates may go up as
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:46.120]  early as the first quarter of 2015 this day that has been an interest rate
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:51.200]  recovery period paragraph not only here what do they have over there in the
[02:11:51.200 --> 02:11:57.400]  European Union negative interest rates you can't make this stuff up really I
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:00.840]  mean I mean if somebody I'm going over negative interest it would be out of your
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:06.960]  mind only people this is enriching and the only reason the equity markets are
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:13.320]  at where they are is because of interest rates so cheap even all the cheap
[02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:17.600]  money so let's do the numbers you're looking at merging merger and
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:24.960]  acquisition for the first two quarters of this year that are almost at the height
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:33.440]  of just before the crash in 2007 we're looking at ten billion dollars a day
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:40.040]  worth of merger and acquisition activity now this is out of time when you're
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:44.040]  looking again at those numbers that you were talking about there's no GDP growth
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:51.560]  it's negative growth so what do we have it's screwing the little people because
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:56.600]  when I was a young man these dad is quite little thing they were called
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:01.960]  savings accounts so people worked hard put money away and the money that they
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:10.840]  put away was way above the inflation rate right now you have you put in the
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:17.080]  bank this when you get back you get nothing back so the only it's hurting
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:23.000]  everybody across the board it's setting up a crisis the retirements and it's
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:30.280]  also pumping up the housing markets and the equity markets again you look at the
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:37.720]  numbers they're all down spending it's down housing isn't that strong even
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:43.200]  though we have all this cheap money in there because first-time home buyers
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:52.360]  which usually account for over 40% of home sales that's now down to around 25
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:14:00.600]  percent because young people get lousy jobs oh and by the way it's going to
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:05.800]  get worse because of all the consolidation so you don't have a housing
[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:10.240]  it's the housing market recovery is minimal when you put it into the
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:15.320]  grander context and again comparing what housing sales are now compared to what
[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:21.240]  they were back you know when the bubble was being inflated you also by the way
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:28.440]  you have the housing bubble in China has deflated the only people that don't
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:34.600]  know it are the people that don't watch it or that believe the guys that get
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:40.120]  paid a lot of money to go on CNBC and Bloomberg and report the big lines
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:45.680]  because I can tell you firsthand and what it was a trend that took one of the
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:54.000]  top trends we had in the trends journal for 2014 China town boom they're
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:58.600]  flooding the area they're buying up properties that they don't even know
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:05.120]  what they're going to do with I know this firsthand and I'm talking about I'm
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:11.200]  talking about companies coming out of Hong Kong with assets in real estate
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:18.760]  that are in the 2030 and 40 billion dollar range because they're not buying up
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:23.960]  in the cities anymore because the prices are too high so they're going out to the
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:32.360]  outskirts because the bubble has hit already in China we're going up for a
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:39.320]  crash that's far worse than the panic of away everything is in place you look
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:44.400]  again as you well reported with these phony numbers that came out and again
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:48.000]  this is coming out from the government so you know they're even underestimating
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.760]  it matter of fact there's an article today by dr. Paul Craig Roberts I think
[02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:58.440]  is on your site having some of the facts there about how the Clinton
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:02.720]  administration put in these phony numbers so we're not really look at the
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:09.000]  right inflation rate so you add all this together the inflate the GDP numbers are
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.920]  much worse than what they're putting out well you know as you pointed out they
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:16.080]  we don't have these things called savings accounts anymore because they
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:21.400]  really don't want Americans to own anything they want to elite few to own
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:25.720]  everything whether it's our cars our transportation our homes our real estate
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:30.360]  and as you as you point out there's been a panic from the Chinese trying to move
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:35.480]  their their fiat currency into some real hard assets but that's that's coming to
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:41.120]  an end now isn't it yes but they're buying up in the states because they
[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:45.400]  have to put their money someplace you have the bubble over there and again all
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:52.000]  things are connected that's right because when all else fails they
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:57.960]  take you to war yes then that's the key thing very interesting today that's what
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:00.960]  I want to talk to you about in the long segment but of course you know there's
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:04.240]  also the economic one of these articles that we've got up today about the
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:08.920]  economy on info wars commas from max labor and he's quoting from some
[02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:13.920]  economists who said that the inventory drawdowns took down 1.7% from GDP
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:18.520]  number because companies don't build inventories if they don't have anybody
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:22.040]  to buy it and people aren't buying it because they're losing their jobs
[02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:26.080]  because they're too expensive especially at the low end because of health care
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:29.560]  mandates but it's going to get much worse Gerald isn't it because we're
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:34.520]  going to see a lot of people losing their jobs to automation I was talking
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:37.880]  about the transportation industry how they're looking at three to five years
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:42.720]  out having self-driving cars well there go the taxi drivers there go the UPS
[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:46.200]  drivers there go the long-term truck drivers are going to be replaced by
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:51.440]  metal cans it's not the Mexicans it's the metal cans isn't it well yeah and
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:56.040]  even worse than that because your life so I mean really they can't fix it you
[02:17:56.040 --> 02:18:01.960]  can't get the ignition switch right you know exactly how many you know how many
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:06.600]  tens of thousands of millions millions and millions of automobiles that they
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:12.800]  or they recalling oh yeah now we're gonna have a perfect one that could drive itself
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:19.080]  you know the cars have been designed by geeks and video game freaks that's all
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:23.040]  they are but what's gonna happen Gerald is what's gonna happen is when these
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:28.000]  things fail it's gonna be quietly ignored by the media and then of course the
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.080]  corporations will pay massive amounts to the families in order to cover up the
[02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:36.560]  fact that their car drove them into a wall or drove them off of a bridge or
[02:18:36.560 --> 02:18:40.920]  whatever whatever the mode of failure I mean we've seen that with the rapid
[02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:44.120]  acceleration of cars from multiple automobile manufacturers that's pretty
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:48.440]  much been kept quiet not a lot has been said about that and we know that as they
[02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:52.200]  take over there's going to be failures because of course these cars and these
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:55.760]  computer programs these map apps they're all being done by humans so you're not
[02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:58.720]  going to eliminate human error you're just going to transfer it to another
[02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:04.160]  place exactly look again the ignition problem look how they covered up with
[02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:08.240]  general mode is the company that we bailed out yeah again urgent state
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:14.600]  corporate powers fascism look at they can't get the airbag problem fixed and
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:19.040]  they're gonna have a self-driving car I mean a lot of people with a real bad
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:25.280]  attitude and it's this whole silicon valley silicon man the con is perfect
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:30.520]  that's all it is it's one big con hey look how smart smartphones have made
[02:19:30.520 --> 02:19:37.480]  everybody this is another lie a big technological boost for the people that
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:42.640]  are making the dough and all it's going to do is to make a bad situation much
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:47.520]  worse again look at the recall numbers that's right we're gonna come back right
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:51.440]  after the break I want to talk to you briefly about this book and possible

[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:20.400]  short segment Gerald I want to talk to you about this book and film that you've
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:25.680]  got what ZZ gave Honey Boy I just saw Jersey Boys over the weekend with my
[02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:30.240]  wife and I thought it was interesting in the story where at one point Frankie
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:33.320]  Valley in the Four Seasons realized that one of the group members is
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:38.160]  essentially sold the group out to the mob that they're massively in debt to
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:42.320]  the mob I thought that's kind of an analogy for America isn't it but I'd
[02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:46.480]  like to hear your take because your take is as you subtitle it here a true
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:51.640]  story about love wisdom and the soul of America I'd like to see that film well

[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:05.720]  months I wrote this book and I used to call every time I wrote a couple of
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:12.000]  pages and it was what this country used to be how her and her husband they had
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:16.840]  a they had a butcher shop in the Bronx and how they were able to buy a lovely
[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:22.480]  home in the nice section of Yonkers how the family used to be there how there
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:27.360]  was up when this was truly the land of opportunity and she used to tell me my
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:31.200]  grandfather may so rest in peace so you know your grandfather when he came from
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:38.080]  Italy he was so proud to be an American he was the first online on the in the

[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:20.680]  justify killing suspected terrorists with drones where they could take us to war
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:27.520]  for lies outright lies and then put up that little guy that little guy with a
[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:33.040]  bad attitude the vice president of the United States Cheney and keep spewing

[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:29.080]  my wife is part Italian and from New York and so I know a lot of people that
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:33.720]  came over as immigrants they came over because they loved America and in many
[02:28:33.720 --> 02:28:38.720]  cases unlike people I go first time I met my wife she she said you know what
[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:42.440]  nationality are you I said I'm an American and she's yeah funny now where
[02:28:42.440 --> 02:28:45.600]  you people from it's like well America I mean they've been here for hundreds of
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:49.400]  years so I don't have any recollection of that but you know in many cases of
[02:28:49.400 --> 02:28:54.240]  people who came over and and realized what they were leaving saw what tyranny
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:58.600]  was about whether they were in East Germany or some other place and they
[02:28:58.600 --> 02:29:02.200]  realized the control that government had over their lives when they tasted
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:06.080]  freedom they appreciated it and they loved it more in America than they did
[02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:10.360]  elsewhere but I'm very concerned about the demographic search that we see with
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:13.720]  illegal aliens just opening up the border and collapsing them and bringing
[02:29:13.720 --> 02:29:18.440]  them in at such young ages and in such numbers that it's not a melting pot
[02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:23.080]  anymore now it's not that the whole country's been destroyed yeah by the by
[02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:27.440]  the bruns and the crypts yeah yeah and that's what's coming across the border

[02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:07.960]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:12.000]  outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:16.200]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90
[02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:19.960]  percent of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there
[02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:24.360]  are more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types

[02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:05.920]  nine West Virginia counties. This year alone over 300,000 people in West
[02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:08.920]  Virginia had their drinking water contaminated. What are the health
[02:32:08.920 --> 02:32:12.640]  effects of having these drugs in our drinking water? It's forced medical
[02:32:12.640 --> 02:32:16.480]  treatment without the consent of residents. My friends water filtration is one
[02:32:16.480 --> 02:32:19.880]  of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family from the
[02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:23.720]  harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water. On average the county says it
[02:32:23.720 --> 02:32:28.240]  sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week. Few filters cut out the glyphosates
[02:32:28.240 --> 02:32:32.280]  that is found in water supplies worldwide. Remove pesticides, herbicides,
[02:32:32.280 --> 02:32:37.760]  chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate, fluoride it is in
[02:32:37.760 --> 02:32:41.120]  teats and coffees and waters and breads and toothpaste. It is our
[02:32:41.120 --> 02:32:44.760]  responsibility to protect our families. The establishment's not going to do it.

[02:33:00.160 --> 02:33:19.840]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones. Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm
[02:33:19.840 --> 02:33:24.520]  David Knight and I have Gerald Sonate from Trends Journal with me on the line.
[02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:30.880]  I was just given this article from Kit Daniels. Just went up on the infowars.com
[02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:37.000]  website. TSA to raise groping fees that are being charged to passengers. That's
[02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:40.440]  right they're going to raise fees and of course these are going to be fees that
[02:33:40.440 --> 02:33:44.000]  are hidden in your airline ticket prices. The new fees are going to be
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:51.640]  $5.60 for a non-stop flight and an extra $5.60 for each leg of the trip.
[02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:57.060]  This kind of reminds me of that movie Brazil that Terry Gilliam did kind of a
[02:33:57.060 --> 02:34:01.360]  Monty Python take on 1984 where they they've got the wrong guy but they come
[02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:04.840]  in with a SWAT team raid. They break into his apartment. They put the black bag
[02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:09.280]  over his head and then while he's tied up and while they've got they let one
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:13.360]  hand loose while he's in the bag they have him sign a sheet of paper agreeing
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:17.600]  to pay for his interrogation. You know that's that's what this has come to. It's
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:23.480]  not a joke anymore. It's a you look at night at you look at Brazil and instead
[02:34:23.480 --> 02:34:26.920]  of laughing at it you're saying yeah that's that's happening now you know
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:31.240]  that was something as decades old but now we see that happening and before we
[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:34.240]  get back to Gerald I just want to tell you that we just finally got back in

[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:07.920]  back in stock. So Gerald what do you think about the TSA charging us adding
[02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:14.240]  these fees to our airline tickets? Well you know before I get into that I was
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:17.840]  mentioning about the Bloods in the Crips. They're the Democrats and the
[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:22.680]  Republicans. They're murderers in their thieves. You know when I get emotional
[02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:26.840]  I was talking about the Zizi what this country used to be like and what it's
[02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:32.000]  turned into. I mean I've been around I know what it was and it breaks my heart
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:36.200]  and so when I say the Bloods in the Crips I'm not saying that's
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:41.480]  artistically. Look what they've done to Iraq. Look what they've done to Afghanistan.
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:46.040]  Look at the murder on their blood on their hands. Look how they steal our
[02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:51.560]  money. You're talking about the TSA now. Oh yeah that's gonna stop it. Oh yeah. Hey
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:55.720]  hey David how about these millions of people that are coming over the border.
[02:35:55.720 --> 02:36:01.520]  Not concerned about that. Press up like Al Qaeda or Al Nusra. I mean if anybody
[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:07.080]  wants to come in hey you know get online man it's a long line they keep
[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:12.800]  flowing over. Who they'd be s-ing with this crap that by listening to us by
[02:36:12.800 --> 02:36:18.840]  feeling us up by stealing our money and by sending our people to go kill other
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:23.400]  people that they're protecting us and the imbeciles believe this garbage.
[02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:29.640]  I mean I can't stop kids from coming over the border. Well it's the same agency it's
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:34.160]  the same agency that is groping people at the airports and now adding fees to our
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:39.600]  tickets that has essentially opened our borders to literal gangs that are
[02:36:39.600 --> 02:36:43.040]  coming across with it part of this drug war that more people are dying in
[02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:48.040]  Mexico than have died in Afghanistan and in Iraq and that's the drug war that
[02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:52.160]  our government is supplying as well as saying that they're fighting it at the
[02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:56.560]  same time and now they're bringing that violence into our country opening the
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:00.480]  borders while they increase the harassment of people who come in via
[02:37:00.480 --> 02:37:07.800]  airplanes who come in legally. And again it's not only here just what the Nobel
[02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:14.400]  Peace Prize when it did when he and Samantha Powers and Susan Rice and
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:19.120]  Hillary Clinton did with the destabilizing Libya overthrowing a
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:24.160]  sovereign government and destabilizing the entire region with it with the with
[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:30.680]  the covert war in in Syria with the destabilization with the Iraq war
[02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:37.920]  Afghan war they're flooding into Europe they can't stop them last week two weeks
[02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:43.120]  ago it was like 8,000 people just coming into Italy that's right so it's a
[02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:52.480]  destabilization worldwide being caused by people who are mentally ill does
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:59.400]  anybody have to see a sicker SOB than Cheney or Kerry that guy's always shooting
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:06.200]  his mouth off man one loser after another one vicious war and people are
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:12.200]  wondering why it's not working so when I say bloods and crypts I mean it oh yeah
[02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:17.160]  absolutely now I'm looking at the the spring edition of Trends Journal people
[02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:22.920]  can get that at trendsjournal.com the cover says war or peace we the people
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:27.520]  should decide you have a lot to say about the Iraq war how we got into that
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:32.000]  11 years on and and look at what's happening now we see this all folding up
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:44.600]  don't we David a trend alert February 18th 2003 weeks before the war
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:50.200]  Gannett News had asked me to do a op-ed piece and then we expanded it for the
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:56.200]  subscribers to the Trends Journal here's what we said while the victory on the
[02:38:56.200 --> 02:39:00.680]  battlefield may be swift considering the massive military power the United
[02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:06.920]  States the war against Iraq will be eventually lost and we said it would
[02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:13.240]  evolve into a civil war unrelenting suicide attacks against coalition forces
[02:39:13.240 --> 02:39:18.160]  against and people are vowing to fight down to the last man to repel
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:28.080]  invaders it keeps going on trend alert March 28th 2005 Iraq trend update real
[02:39:28.080 --> 02:39:37.080]  war fake democracy what's next top trend trends 2005 doing the Iraq drag
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:43.860]  Washington's promise and the Pentagon's prophecy that this year's
[02:39:43.860 --> 02:39:48.800]  eruptions will establish democracy and fill and facilitate US troop reductions
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:57.600]  are as inaccurate as claims made last year by Vice President Dick Cheney that
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:04.040]  the Iraq war is behind us and Major General Raymond or the air nose
[02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:10.560]  predictions that quote we have six to twelve months left of this insurgency
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:16.440]  yeah on and on and on we've been documenting it from before the war
[02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:21.640]  happened saying exactly what would happen and what does the prostitute media
[02:40:21.640 --> 02:40:27.520]  do they keep bringing back all of the losers as this thing is going down the
[02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:33.920]  toilet to ask them what they should do next and what they see ahead well you
[02:40:33.920 --> 02:40:37.960]  know I think the public looks at this and says look at this it was a failed
[02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:42.480]  invasion it was a failed counterinsurgency the whole point is to
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:46.360]  keep war continually going isn't it they knew they weren't going to win this
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:53.640]  counterinsurgency again yes and it goes back to 9-11 yes you know with the new
[02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:58.520]  trends journals coming out in a couple of weeks and we really broke this
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:06.800]  down and you look go back just a few weeks before the 9 9 11 Bush's
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:12.280]  popularity in the polls was down to 51 percent this is a newly elected
[02:41:12.280 --> 02:41:17.160]  president he's only in office several months there was slashing the defense
[02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:23.400]  budget then you go listen to his speech to the nation at the house at the house
[02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:30.000]  of the house of representatives and how everyone stood up and applauded when
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:35.240]  they announced they were going to increase the military budget by $40
[02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:41.520]  billion overnight and this by the way is on the heels of the dot-com crash that
[02:41:41.520 --> 02:41:48.800]  happened in March of 2000 and the United States is going into the toilet in a
[02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:54.480]  recession so when you start putting the pieces together it all goes back to
[02:41:54.480 --> 02:42:01.040]  Eisenhower that's right the military industrial complex taking over the
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:08.480]  nation and now very interesting very interesting today's papers financial
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:15.960]  times Wall Street Journal New York Times big big articles and you know
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:22.040]  that by brought to you by the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S.
[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:29.000]  Chamber of Commerce America's interests are at stake in Russia and Ukraine
[02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:35.520]  there we go we've got to have a war yeah no they're calling for peace they're
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:42.160]  calling for a prosperity they're calling for no sanctions they can see the hand
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:47.400]  writing on the wall oh really they don't that the United States is in no
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:52.960]  position for more war and that's what we're writing about this is again the
[02:42:52.960 --> 02:42:58.640]  Chamber of Commerce yeah I'm surprised I had the manufacturers that is news
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:02.480]  that's like a complete 180 to turn around because you know we look at you
[02:43:02.480 --> 02:43:06.520]  should point it out 9-11 defense budget is going down they say we don't have any
[02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:10.560]  anybody to fight so they've got to create a new enemy and they create a new
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:15.880]  bureaucracy homeland security where they expand the military industrial complex
[02:43:15.880 --> 02:43:20.800]  not just to fight wars abroad but to bring it home and to create a police
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:24.400]  state industrial complex you know it was Madison who said that if tyranny ever
[02:43:24.400 --> 02:43:28.160]  comes to these lands it'll be in the name of fighting a foreign enemy well
[02:43:28.160 --> 02:43:31.880]  we've got that now that same organization Homeland Security we're just
[02:43:31.880 --> 02:43:36.120]  talking about collapsing the borders and then harassing people and charging them
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:40.840]  as to grope them to take away their freedom and their dignity at the
[02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:45.160]  airport so I'm really surprised to see the Chamber of Commerce and
[02:43:45.160 --> 02:43:49.560]  manufacturers saying we don't want to have a nuclear war I thought these guys
[02:43:49.560 --> 02:43:55.840]  be all for it that's good they know there's and the numbers are that they
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:59.520]  can't again you look at you look at the markets as we're talking you know they
[02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:02.920]  down why oh the other thing that you would the first quarter which was
[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:07.720]  terrible now they're downgrading the second quarter everybody that's real
[02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:11.400]  knows what's going on here we're wasting over a trillion dollars in total
[02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:16.280]  expenses on the so-called military industrial and cyber complex and then
[02:44:16.280 --> 02:44:21.400]  you're looking again back at the back at the real numbers here the economy is
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:27.120]  going down the people in the know know that we cannot afford more war and
[02:44:27.120 --> 02:44:33.720]  that's what this trend journal is again bring on peace bring on prosperity and
[02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:38.120]  what I'm launching and we're going to be doing it in the following months is an
[02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:43.520]  Occupy peace movement and anybody that wants to sign up they could go to
[02:44:43.520 --> 02:44:47.880]  Occupy peace dot US this is only for America you want to do it in your
[02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:54.680]  country you do it and I'm up here in colonial Kingston New York the 1777
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:59.480]  Senate building the oldest public building in the United States is
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:05.520]  literally a stone's throw away from me every one of the founding fathers no
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:12.280]  foreign entanglements and that's what Occupy peace is based on no foreign
[02:45:12.280 --> 02:45:17.840]  entanglements I see these guys on television Cheney and Graham and this
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:24.240]  one and that one what we have to do here what we have to do there you want to go
[02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:30.320]  on a foreign country send yourself send your wife send your kids keep me out of
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:36.640]  your psycho trip all you do is create one disaster after another so Occupy
[02:45:36.640 --> 02:45:42.880]  peace dot US is no foreign entanglements bring home all the troops all the money
[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:49.280]  and rebuild America see all the board is tight bring
[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:55.400]  home our no more coming over we can't take care of our own after the Great
[02:45:55.400 --> 02:46:01.480]  Depression when it hit immigration no immigration until we can rebuild the
[02:46:01.480 --> 02:46:08.120]  country and help feed our own people and put them back to work when we do that
[02:46:08.120 --> 02:46:14.480]  I'm all in favor of opening the borders now seal them tight and by the way I've
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:21.560]  been writing about this go back to trend tracking 1989 go back to trends 2000
[02:46:21.560 --> 02:46:30.280]  water books 1997 what a big shit was with the H1B visas with the immigration
[02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:36.240]  policy they're destroying the nation they're bringing in cheap labor undercut
[02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:41.560]  our labor and oh we don't have any smart people in this country we got to bring
[02:46:41.560 --> 02:46:46.560]  them from India and China we're just a bunch of imbeciles yeah that's right
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:52.160]  even the imbeciles you can't get a lousy job you're talking about automation of
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:58.440]  automobiles drive them on their own you don't need the driver check this out the
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:03.880]  news thing is when you go order some crappy corporate food all you have to
[02:47:03.880 --> 02:47:09.160]  do you don't need a waiter or wait waitress all you need to do is just put
[02:47:09.160 --> 02:47:14.560]  it into your smart phone and it'll get delivered to you so all those lousy
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:20.840]  jobs when you look at the job numbers in quote the hospitality sector they're
[02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:25.280]  even going to do away with them oh yeah it's not just manufacturing it's going
[02:47:25.280 --> 02:47:28.160]  to be service it's going to be transportation it's going to be
[02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:32.640]  automation everywhere and that's going to accelerate the concentration of wealth
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:36.400]  into the hands of the few it's going to increase the unemployment and yet we're
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:41.040]  told by again it's US Chamber of Commerce and others are pushing for this
[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:44.960]  uncontrolled immigration because they're telling us that we need a workforce it
[02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:48.280]  was just last week that I was I've been talking about this last couple of days
[02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:52.920]  David Petraeus was at the Thatcher conference on Liberty and he's he
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:56.520]  answered the question after America what's next he said that's easy North
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:00.200]  America he starts talking about NAFTA he talks about how right now we've got
[02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:05.040]  we're going to go from a situation we've got a hundred people on a assembly line
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:08.680]  down to where we've got a hundred robots and two people looking at them so how do
[02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:14.680]  we deal with that but he's excited about this demographic surge so you know why
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:18.840]  would anybody listen to him yeah let's read his words we have it in the
[02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:25.080]  trends journal everything that he ever said came to nothing yo you remember
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:29.480]  that you remember the troops surge in Afghanistan right oh brilliant man oh
[02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:36.440]  yeah great job in Mosul hey how about Fallujah yeah Fallujah you they're all
[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:43.440]  losers and all they do the prostitute media they keep recycling the same
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:49.280]  guys and women over and over again that have done nothing done nothing to destroy
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:54.120]  this country oh and then you look at little David you know David David married
[02:48:54.120 --> 02:49:02.400]  David married the girl whose father was running West Point that's right another
[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:09.320]  guy that got his ticket punched punched in his way up and brown nose in his way
[02:49:09.320 --> 02:49:14.240]  up the line that's how these guys get there I began my career I was the
[02:49:14.240 --> 02:49:19.840]  assistant to the secretary of the New York State Senate at 23 the worst job
[02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:24.880]  ever had well I'd be talking to my buddy leave me to follow the senator pull his
[02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:28.920]  chair and help him sit down and come back I say amen what's the matter cat
[02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:35.600]  can't sit down by himself needs some help all they are a suck ups their brown
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:40.680]  noses they don't have any courage they don't have any dignity you know what
[02:49:40.680 --> 02:49:46.560]  they have they have a bad attitude and a lot of arrogance to tell us how we should
[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:52.680]  live our lives how could anybody allow what's going on in this country to keep
[02:49:52.680 --> 02:49:57.120]  going on that's why I become emotional when I talk about what this nation used
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:50:02.280]  to be and how a bunch of little boys and girls had destroyed it and there's no
[02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:06.480]  courage out there among the people to say I had enough and that's why we're
[02:50:06.480 --> 02:50:11.720]  launching occupied peace you want to go to war you're a traitor against
[02:50:11.720 --> 02:50:16.880]  Washington you're a traitor against the founding fathers and I don't need some

[02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:32.400]  other industry groups have taken out an ad calling for peace we see that the
[02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:35.760]  Supreme Court yesterday is telling the police if they want to look at our phones

[02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:50.160]  or what I mean with this is some good news I never thought I would hear I think
[02:54:50.160 --> 02:54:55.200]  I'm dreaming or what's going on here well you know there's some extent and you
[02:54:55.200 --> 02:54:59.640]  know the soda ban thing it is all this stupidity yeah you know no bullying zone
[02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:06.480]  I love that one too yeah no put and a zero tolerance it's the nanny state yeah
[02:55:06.480 --> 02:55:09.680]  oh yeah you know we're coming out with the new trends journal and one of the
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:15.320]  stories is going to be don't blame Obamacare it goes back to the suit with
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:20.640]  the soda ban blame I don't care oh that's good but the nation has become and
[02:55:20.640 --> 02:55:25.000]  they try to you know it's we have an obesity problem the numbers are much
[02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:29.080]  higher there was a story out just yesterday about much worse than it is
[02:55:29.080 --> 02:55:33.920]  the numbers are being reported so we can't have all these drugs they're trying
[02:55:33.920 --> 02:55:39.920]  to put soda bans school things we have a product that we believe can be FDA
[02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:44.840]  approved it's called tape is zine and it works like this you cut off a piece of
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:48.440]  tape
[02:55:48.440 --> 02:55:55.560]  you can't get a spoon in there you can't get a knife in there you just duct tape
[02:55:55.560 --> 02:56:00.120]  solution well that's right you know cuz duct tape for the side effects of the
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:04.640]  rip it off hurts a little bit but what I'm trying to say is how about self
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:10.880]  responsibility yeah oh yeah not about enough of this crap for any jerk to tell
[02:56:10.880 --> 02:56:17.920]  us how we should live our lives that's right a paper zine you know said 2995 you
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:22.240]  know I mean how could anybody make this crap up you see the drugs they're trying
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:26.760]  to push through a new one was just about to get approved you take this thing
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:35.160]  it's perfect your stomach swells up so you can't I'm not making it up and so
[02:56:35.160 --> 02:56:40.920]  then you have the side effects David in this next transjournal we're showing how
[02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:47.000]  the greatest cost to the American public in healthcare is going to be having to
[02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:53.840]  do with food and diet the poison foods that we're eating and the enormous
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:59.240]  amounts that people are consuming so when you go back to the story about the
[02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:05.480]  soda ban you know yeah how about it how about a mind ban you know oh yeah it's
[02:57:05.480 --> 02:57:10.720]  all about and again it's all tied again when people start showing dignity
[02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:18.160]  courage and self-respect about themselves they don't take baloney from a bunch
[02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:23.680]  of jerks that call themselves commandants and chief secretaries of this
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:28.680]  to that senator this the congressman that well of course the people of course
[02:57:28.680 --> 02:57:32.000]  the people who have woken up to the health effects who do want to take
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:35.400]  control of their lives what they do is they hide that information from them on
[02:57:35.400 --> 02:57:39.840]  the labels they don't want people to know if they've got GMO products in there
[02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:42.440]  they want to keep that information away from people just like they don't want
[02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:45.280]  them to know what's in the vaccines or whatever they don't want people to be
[02:57:45.280 --> 02:57:49.560]  informed and yet at the same time they say well you're you're doing things
[02:57:49.560 --> 02:57:52.640]  unhealthy because they put a lot of unhealthy stuff like high fructose
[02:57:52.640 --> 02:57:57.440]  corn syrup into so many different things that we eat and a whole litany of
[02:57:57.440 --> 02:58:00.840]  things and they they say well you're not taking responsibility of life so we're
[02:58:00.840 --> 02:58:04.560]  going to create this and this is an article on Bloomberg hospitals will see
[02:58:04.560 --> 02:58:09.440]  donuts to cigarette charges for health so they're going to start nanny stating
[02:58:09.440 --> 02:58:13.760]  everybody using the computer techno state thank you so much for joining us
