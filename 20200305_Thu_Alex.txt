[00:54.200 --> 00:59.320]  know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions I don't care
[00:59.320 --> 01:03.400]  about your weird very narrow definition of what a baby is and when life occurs
[01:03.400 --> 01:07.920]  weren't you a baby once what does that have to do with anything I don't know
[01:07.920 --> 01:11.120]  you're gonna have baby Sunday I'm not gonna have children I don't want to have
[01:11.120 --> 01:14.240]  children I know that's something that very confuses y'all but there are some
[01:14.240 --> 01:18.240]  people that truly do not decide to have children in this world at three
[01:18.240 --> 01:21.920]  abortions because I don't want to have children well thank you for talking to
[01:21.920 --> 01:25.960]  us yeah please I can't wait to see your heavily edited and bullshit of you when

[02:00.720 --> 02:04.240]  you believe in but nobody's gonna talk to us because you're doing as I said
[02:04.240 --> 02:09.000]  earlier you're doing a biased and course of interview you're asking leading
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.040]  questions that's not journalism I'm here to defend abortion rights because I've
[02:14.040 --> 02:19.600]  had abortions and abortion is cool yes absolutely I'm giving you some good
[02:19.600 --> 02:25.600]  stuff for your YouTube channel or whatever it is yeah because liberation is
[02:25.600 --> 02:32.080]  fantastic and abortion allowed me to be the liberated woman that I am yeah well
[02:32.080 --> 02:35.160]  you know and I'm asking you this straight so you tell me your straight answers
[02:35.160 --> 02:38.840]  we're not messing around here a lot of people here saying I don't care what a
[02:38.840 --> 02:42.040]  lot of people are saying okay I won't engage in that conversation okay yeah
[02:42.040 --> 02:44.440]  that's not what I'm here about I'm not here about what they're saying I'm here
[02:44.440 --> 02:47.840]  about what I'm saying which is abortion is a human right abortion should remain
[02:47.840 --> 02:55.760]  legal abortion should have extra protections because I'm here to witness
[02:55.760 --> 03:01.040]  what's happening the Supreme Court and to stand with other supporters I do care
[03:01.040 --> 03:03.400]  about what's going on in Louisiana see this is why I didn't want to talk to you
[03:03.400 --> 03:07.560]  I'm saying very clear very succinct things and you're being butch you're
[03:07.560 --> 03:10.880]  saying and it's not what I'm saying quit trying to know no we're not gonna do
[03:10.880 --> 03:13.760]  this you're not gonna manipulate my words I care about what's happening in
[03:13.760 --> 03:16.960]  Louisiana I care about what's happening in other states too I'm from North
[03:16.960 --> 03:20.240]  Carolina I live in the south I know what abortion like it accesses like in
[03:20.240 --> 03:25.400]  the south you want to I'm I'm I want to talk about what I want to talk about I
[03:25.400 --> 03:29.160]  don't want to talk about what you want to talk about okay so do you want to
[03:29.160 --> 03:32.360]  talk about Louisiana what do you want to know what do you want to talk about do
[03:32.360 --> 03:35.800]  you think that abortion clinics should be held to the same medical standards as
[03:35.800 --> 03:39.800]  hospitals they already are so yes absolutely oh that's incorrect they're
[03:39.800 --> 03:42.680]  not the same standards hospitals because they're not hospitals they are not
[03:42.680 --> 03:46.520]  providing all-inclusive care for a variety of illnesses and diseases nor are
[03:46.520 --> 03:50.840]  they providing a variety of surgeries they are providing an invasive but not
[03:50.840 --> 03:55.720]  dangerous quick quality health care abortion procedures are safe they are
[03:55.720 --> 03:59.160]  not a surgical procedure in the sense you were being cut open and you need a
[03:59.160 --> 04:03.560]  sterile surgical environment you need a certain sterile environment just like
[04:03.560 --> 04:06.480]  any other health care provider and abortion clinics are hate to help to the
[04:06.480 --> 04:10.440]  same standards as ambulatory health care centers as any other health care
[04:10.440 --> 04:14.360]  provider that is doing a pap smear as anything like that so you're asking for
[04:14.360 --> 04:19.000]  extra regulations that will shut down clinics there's no biological medical
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.920]  factual reason that a doctor needs admitting privileges if they're
[04:21.920 --> 04:25.240]  providing abortion care if anything we should be fighting for emergency room
[04:25.240 --> 04:29.680]  doctors to be trained in full spectrum OBGYN care so they know how to treat the
[04:29.680 --> 04:33.960]  rare but they do occur complications from abortion just like any health care
[04:33.960 --> 04:37.840]  procedure there's complications some reason an ER doctor knows how to treat a
[04:37.840 --> 04:42.040]  health care complication with any other routine ladies and gentlemen a
[04:42.040 --> 04:45.720]  Chuckie Schumer was at this rally saying we're going to basically attack the
[04:45.720 --> 04:49.120]  Supreme Court that shows who these bullies and people are and women at the
[04:49.120 --> 04:52.800]  rally had signs of babies being chopped up and alligators eating babies and
[04:52.800 --> 04:59.360]  celebrated the murder of babies this is a culture of Satanist rich and
[04:59.360 --> 05:03.760]  Alabama rich thanks for calling mr. Jones appreciate it first thing I love
[05:03.760 --> 05:09.600]  the turbo force I drive truck for a living and it's amazing coffee kind of
[05:09.600 --> 05:13.840]  gives you a little crash there then but that purple force is amazing how is
[05:13.840 --> 05:18.320]  turbo force different than coffee I'll tell you what it's sustainable
[05:18.320 --> 05:24.520]  anywhere from 18 hours I don't feel the jitters like I do drink and coffee and
[05:24.520 --> 05:28.520]  it's just you know at the end of the day I don't need anything to go to bed off
[05:28.520 --> 05:33.760]  you know knock out them I'm out cold well that's what we went out to a top
[05:33.760 --> 05:37.160]  developer who didn't want his name on it and I said what would the ultimate long
[05:37.160 --> 05:42.720]  say 10 hour energy be is that possible that's good and clean and strong and has
[05:42.720 --> 05:45.520]  a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and natural that are
[05:45.520 --> 05:49.280]  time-released and there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their
[05:49.280 --> 05:53.640]  product so that's why turbo force has such a great effect and so I really
[05:53.640 --> 06:22.880]  appreciate you and I'm glad that you like turbo force
[06:22.880 --> 06:30.400]  we are live on this March 5th Thursday broadcast the year is 2020 with 242 days
[06:30.400 --> 06:37.560]  left until the historic election and things are not
[06:38.200 --> 06:47.120]  normal things are not in a state of just regular globalist activity the world
[06:47.120 --> 06:55.120]  is at a major crossroads right now and things are not the same and things are
[06:55.120 --> 07:00.720]  not going to be stable they're going to be extremely explosive now I've been
[07:00.720 --> 07:05.720]  predicting that about 2020 wasn't hard to predict but now it's very very very
[07:05.720 --> 07:12.560]  clear that we are going to see turmoil and revolution and economic crises and
[07:12.560 --> 07:18.760]  biological crises and cultural crises and spiritual crises on a level never
[07:18.760 --> 07:29.000]  before seen as we go through these trying times well global tourism has
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.520]  crashed due to coronavirus Italy has cancelled sporting events at other
[07:34.520 --> 07:38.480]  nations are following suit over 120 people have died in Italy and that's
[07:38.480 --> 07:43.240]  what we're learning about now there's videos of rooms and hospitals just full
[07:43.240 --> 07:50.520]  of body bags with dead people inside of them something big is going on and it's
[07:50.520 --> 07:54.720]  because the virus is killing a lot more people than the flu does maybe one
[07:54.720 --> 07:57.800]  tenth of one percent with the flu the CDC estimates that's probably an accurate
[07:57.800 --> 08:00.680]  estimate and most those people are run down they're old they've got
[08:00.680 --> 08:06.280]  pre-existing conditions still it's it's serious a corona virus looks like it
[08:06.280 --> 08:10.440]  kills two percent of people as if you average Asians and Anglos and everybody
[08:10.440 --> 08:17.760]  else in together and so you're seeing governments use this as a crackdown and
[08:17.760 --> 08:23.720]  use this as a police state and obviously they're hyping up the fear in China and
[08:23.720 --> 08:27.560]  other areas for control trumps tried to tap down the fear but while quietly
[08:27.560 --> 08:31.880]  blocking airline flights from China three weeks ago getting criticized for it
[08:31.880 --> 08:37.160]  meanwhile Israel and so many other countries are totally blocking flights
[08:37.160 --> 08:43.800]  not just out of China but now out of Europe and how long till they block
[08:43.800 --> 08:48.480]  flights out of the US I'm gonna say this again coronavirus is a giant global
[08:48.480 --> 08:56.760]  disaster it is a historic event of massive implications and proportions on
[08:56.760 --> 09:03.480]  the supply chain destabilization front alone it's the equivalent of Godzilla
[09:03.480 --> 09:10.360]  destroying Tokyo and you've got our own government saying don't get masks you
[09:10.360 --> 09:14.400]  don't need them when you damn well many of these masks do massively restrict the
[09:14.400 --> 09:17.880]  amount of virus you would get they're on a hundred percent but nine nine point
[09:17.880 --> 09:22.480]  nine nine nine nine is better than nothing like a water filter oh your
[09:22.480 --> 09:26.320]  water filter only gets out nine nine point nine nine percent of lead mercury yeah
[09:26.320 --> 09:33.000]  that's a lot better than all of it going through so this is a big deal now
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.960]  Macron is seizing the mask nationwide because obviously the hospitals need
[09:36.960 --> 09:41.840]  them and that's why Trump had CDC come out and say hey you don't really need
[09:41.840 --> 09:44.800]  those masks well that's because they want you grabbing them all so they can
[09:44.800 --> 09:47.880]  have them at the hospitals and the emergency centers getting ready for
[09:47.880 --> 09:53.600]  what's coming and China covered up what was happening but then use it as a
[09:53.600 --> 09:58.240]  power grab once it was apparent that it caused a panic and killed it's probably
[09:58.240 --> 10:01.920]  hundreds of thousands I mean the footage out of the cities is just body bags and
[10:01.920 --> 10:05.960]  exhausted doctors and piles of dead people and I mean you said folks dropping
[10:05.960 --> 10:09.200]  down the street most the footage is real there's fake footage where folks are
[10:09.200 --> 10:13.400]  just jumping on or two people fall down the street side by side either it's fake
[10:13.400 --> 10:16.360]  or they got sprayed with something else and we know the stuff that the
[10:16.360 --> 10:20.000]  government of China has been driving around spraying on everybody is toxic
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.800]  and it's killing animals and probably killing people so who knows what they're
[10:23.800 --> 10:28.720]  piggybacking on this who knows what the binary weapons are that are being added
[10:28.720 --> 10:33.360]  to this which is blue dr. Francis Boyle who's the author of the US biological
[10:33.360 --> 10:36.800]  weapons treaty that became world law has been proven absolutely on target he's
[10:36.800 --> 10:41.560]  with us in the third hour today but I intend to open the phones up in the
[10:41.560 --> 10:47.720]  first two hours here for you to give us your take on the coronavirus but even
[10:47.720 --> 10:50.680]  prominent folks that I know and I'm not gonna name names because they're friends
[10:50.680 --> 10:53.640]  of mine that think the coronavirus was a hoax I talked to one of them this
[10:53.640 --> 11:06.000]  morning and they now believe that people are dying but that maybe it's being
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.760]  sprayed in the atmosphere or there's another weapon and that could be but
[11:10.760 --> 11:14.960]  the point is even the biggest skeptics now everyone okay I know somebody
[11:14.960 --> 11:17.440]  deathly ill or I know somebody that died and they're trying to cover up the
[11:17.440 --> 11:20.880]  deaths and the government is on record trying to block the kits going out and
[11:20.880 --> 11:24.680]  Obama put out bad kids and Obama's won the transfer to China five years ago
[11:24.680 --> 11:29.400]  that's just a fact that's in science the Journal of Science five years ago what
[11:29.400 --> 11:32.920]  are you doing transferring this to him so you had all this together it is a
[11:32.920 --> 11:42.000]  perfect storm of insanity so I want to give first-time callers a chance and
[11:42.000 --> 11:48.000]  also first responders a chance and people in China or in Italy or in the
[11:48.000 --> 11:51.080]  hardest-hit areas like Hong Kong we'd like to hear from you from the lines
[11:51.080 --> 11:54.920]  you tell us that you're calling from an area hard hitter you have any intel
[11:54.920 --> 11:58.680]  you'll go to the headlines please tell us so we'll know to put you to the head
[11:58.680 --> 12:07.920]  of the line 877-789-2539-877-789 Alex 877-789-2539 and again I am your host
[12:07.920 --> 12:13.960]  Alex Jones very honored to be here with you but we are not in normal times and I
[12:13.960 --> 12:19.760]  just wanted to signify that today anyway I can to just visually let folks know
[12:19.760 --> 12:24.000]  that this isn't a drill this is 2020 and if you think the coronavirus is the end
[12:24.000 --> 12:27.640]  of all the craziness the Islamic invasion launched by Turkey into Europe
[12:27.640 --> 12:31.040]  the Greeks fighting back and turning back the hordes that the government was
[12:31.040 --> 12:36.480]  trying to back against them just insane stock market gyrations the Dow Jones
[12:36.480 --> 12:43.000]  industrial average down 700 points left trying to trigger a race war the left
[12:43.000 --> 12:49.160]  nominating that basically done it now warrants dropped out Joe Biden who
[12:49.160 --> 12:56.200]  obviously has mid-stage dementia this is an incredible time to be alive right
[12:56.200 --> 13:01.800]  now and nobody is a spectator on planet Earth you are in the middle of the fight
[13:01.800 --> 13:05.200]  to determine the rest of human future and let me then make two points before
[13:05.200 --> 13:16.200]  we go to break come back with your calls at 877-789 Alex 877-789-2539 877-789-2539
[13:16.200 --> 13:28.520]  it's more important than ever to be focused on God and focused on your
[13:28.520 --> 13:31.520]  center and not worrying about the establishment and not worry about the
[13:31.520 --> 13:35.480]  left does not worrying about their their legal terrorism or just anything they
[13:35.480 --> 13:38.120]  do to attack you and just get right with God that's my advice that's what I'm
[13:38.120 --> 13:41.520]  doing and then separately when you get right with God you then focus and you
[13:41.520 --> 13:46.680]  say I need clean water I need plenty of sleep I need to spend time praying that
[13:46.680 --> 13:49.280]  booster immune system on record even we don't believe in God it does look at the

[14:01.640 --> 14:05.160]  going to make a bunch of moves this year and everybody's secretly scared so they
[14:05.160 --> 14:08.800]  see the virus which is obviously it's really serious but then they go oh that's
[14:08.800 --> 14:13.000]  why I'm feeling so much trepidation no open world government and he cries to
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.400]  market the beast anti-family pedophilia out in the open Hollywood demons
[14:17.400 --> 14:23.320]  attacking it's now all clear that the Bible's right and there's there is a
[14:23.320 --> 14:27.000]  devil and there is a God and we're on this planet being tested and so it's
[14:27.000 --> 14:30.080]  okay you have that fear that's your spirit getting concerned run up

[19:12.440 --> 19:15.640]  months ago I came with a plan that I haven't launched yet we have a warehouse

[19:31.480 --> 19:34.440]  disrupting things people say why are you doing this what's happening when you
[19:34.440 --> 19:38.000]  go well we're being censored you know Trump won't do anything about it and
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.680]  dr. Pachinic I'm let me just ask you what you think because I've not launched
[19:40.680 --> 19:46.000]  this yet. It's brilliant you've taken the very element that they try to repress
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.880]  you with that silence and made it into a weapon you have the loudest sound of all
[19:50.880 --> 19:57.960]  silence and you know what's most disturbing to people silence silence silence
[19:57.960 --> 20:21.960]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones
[20:21.960 --> 20:28.960]  coming to you live. From the front lines of the info war.
[20:44.960 --> 20:51.080]  We are back live on this live Thursday March 5th 2020 transmission and we're
[20:51.080 --> 20:55.920]  going to be going to your phone calls Barbara and Hannah Mann and many others
[20:55.920 --> 21:02.400]  on the coronavirus. This morning I got up at about 5 a.m. read a bunch of news
[21:02.400 --> 21:08.360]  talked to some of my sources in the last few days reflected on what what their
[21:08.360 --> 21:15.160]  perspective is and it just hit me it's true coronavirus is absolutely horrible
[21:15.160 --> 21:19.880]  and it is killing a lot more people than the flu statistically for those that
[21:19.880 --> 21:24.040]  get it not overall to the flu is already distributed and governments have
[21:24.040 --> 21:28.160]  covered it up so far but have you watched the government ministers and stuff
[21:28.160 --> 21:32.760]  even when they don't know they're on camera refusing to shake each other's
[21:32.760 --> 21:39.200]  hands and things in Europe and in China they are scared of this because it's
[21:39.200 --> 21:43.440]  killing a lot of people and yeah mainly folks that are older over 70 people that
[21:43.440 --> 21:45.720]  have diabetes people that have pre-existing conditions people that
[21:45.720 --> 21:51.360]  just had surgery but it's killing healthy people as well hundreds are now
[21:51.360 --> 21:55.120]  admitted dead in Italy and you know that number is going to get much higher and
[21:55.120 --> 22:02.840]  it just showed up there two weeks ago so it's barely spread any it's not hit
[22:02.840 --> 22:07.440]  large populations yet and it's already killing a lot of people now clearly
[22:07.440 --> 22:11.760]  governments are using it to crack down on populations but the attack on the
[22:11.760 --> 22:20.520]  infrastructure and the attack on the the just-on-time delivery systems is going
[22:20.520 --> 22:24.600]  and well it's not going to it already has really hurt the economy in the
[22:24.600 --> 22:28.160]  stock markets town 700 points today Trump is propping it up which is fine with
[22:28.160 --> 22:33.280]  me because it's all fiat to begin with but as the numbers grow and as more
[22:33.280 --> 22:38.280]  people get sick and as more die you already have the president set of the
[22:38.280 --> 22:41.960]  panic we saw in China boarding up people's houses welding them shut like
[22:41.960 --> 22:48.240]  it's a horror movie in their zombies when things happen like that humans are
[22:48.240 --> 22:52.480]  mammals and we see what others humans do and we behave the same way at a very
[22:52.480 --> 22:55.200]  deep level we believe in the knowledge of the crowd
[22:55.200 --> 22:59.040]  let's use this analogy a hundred times I'll do it again you don't know where you
[22:59.040 --> 23:02.320]  are in some small town back before Google was ubiquitous with reviews which
[23:02.320 --> 23:05.760]  you can't now believe at first they were good because Google let you actually
[23:05.760 --> 23:09.200]  vote now it's all scam in most cases but before that you pulled into small town
[23:09.200 --> 23:14.160]  in Colorado or Michigan or New York and you see the restaurant with lines out
[23:14.160 --> 23:17.480]  the door that's got the good food restaurant with four or five cars
[23:17.480 --> 23:22.440]  you're gonna get food poisoning there just wait it's you don't need to go
[23:22.440 --> 23:26.200]  into that restaurant that's four cars in it to find out there's a meth head
[23:26.200 --> 23:29.040]  running it and they're dealing drugs out of the back you just know that's a
[23:29.040 --> 23:31.960]  creepy-looking place
[23:31.960 --> 23:37.680]  well it's the same thing you watch the Chinese shooting people at checkpoints
[23:37.680 --> 23:44.600]  and people collapsing on the street and wailing and screaming and body bags
[23:44.600 --> 23:52.200]  piled up and you know something big hit China and so even the people that I know
[23:52.200 --> 23:55.640]  who are friends of mine that thought it was all BS I talked to one of them this
[23:55.640 --> 23:58.160]  morning with another one last night they're like actually I think they're
[23:58.160 --> 24:01.080]  spraying something in the air and I think it's what the Chinese released and I
[24:01.080 --> 24:05.120]  think that's a cover for something else but something begs going on yeah that's
[24:05.120 --> 24:07.760]  totally legitimate a lot of times they'll say it's one thing it's another
[24:07.760 --> 24:12.600]  all I know is it's admitted that virus is man-made and it's now spreading really
[24:12.600 --> 24:19.200]  fast it's super communicable and it is a Frankenstein creation complete with the
[24:19.200 --> 24:29.520]  microscopic cuts on it where they sandwich it together like a pie and the
[24:29.520 --> 24:34.080]  question is how bad is it gonna get how big is it who's really behind it and
[24:34.080 --> 24:37.400]  what's the end game because if it's man-made and it popped up right on time
[24:37.400 --> 24:43.440]  and they're trying to blame and they're trying to blame Trump for it as we
[24:43.440 --> 24:49.200]  predicted it's really crazy how info wars wargaming our audience our guest
[24:49.200 --> 24:52.160]  does your wargaming has been as good as mine or anybody's callers that's why I
[24:52.160 --> 25:00.440]  love taking your calls that that our information has absolutely been spot on
[25:00.520 --> 25:06.400]  with the peace shuttle gene and the protein points where it was injected in
[25:06.400 --> 25:11.520]  the HIV delivery system but just don't believe Alice Jones believe the
[25:11.520 --> 25:17.160]  epidemiologist and the and the virologist and Dr. Francis Boyle joining
[25:17.160 --> 25:21.680]  us the third hour who is the leading legal expert on this and talking to the
[25:21.680 --> 25:26.600]  top medical experts on it and he said a month ago here he said this is really
[25:26.600 --> 25:30.200]  bad it's man-made and there's a high kill rate probably two percent and now
[25:30.200 --> 25:34.360]  that's exactly the latest numbers and we hope it's way lower than that you know
[25:34.360 --> 25:38.720]  Lansett had a limited thing five weeks ago of just 47 deaths he did at least
[25:38.720 --> 25:44.240]  65 to get a decent reading but with the ones they had it was a 15% death rate
[25:44.240 --> 25:47.240]  or so but obviously those people are already super sick and so it's not a
[25:47.240 --> 25:52.760]  good focus group it's not a good test for it the proper term so because I mean
[25:52.760 --> 25:56.920]  if it was 15% I would be in a bunker somewhere I mean I won't lose any of my
[25:56.920 --> 26:01.520]  kids man I tell you talk about Russian roulette ladies and gentlemen 15%
[26:01.520 --> 26:09.040]  basically Russian roulette six cylinders eight cylinders in the revolver
[26:09.040 --> 26:13.680]  and you know you you spin it and hope you don't hope you don't pull the wrong
[26:13.680 --> 26:20.520]  hope you don't pull the wrong cylinder so we're gonna take your phone calls on
[26:20.520 --> 26:26.920]  this when we come back with Melinda and Dennis and Patrick and Hanuman and many
[26:26.920 --> 26:29.720]  many others eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine we can
[26:29.720 --> 26:34.720]  get into the economy we can get into the Democratic field we can get into a man
[26:34.720 --> 26:41.320]  that cannot string one coherent sentence together is who is gonna be the
[26:41.320 --> 26:46.400]  nominee I've been calling the nominee for a week but he won Super Tuesday they
[26:46.400 --> 26:49.720]  obviously cheated just like last time with Hillary the Democrats control the
[26:49.720 --> 26:57.760]  delegates the super delegates and that's it it's his turn the aging sketchy to
[26:57.760 --> 27:04.040]  take a turn at being emperor of the dark crystal but what are they planning
[27:04.040 --> 27:08.360]  behind that you know you don't know that she admits that they're trying to
[27:08.360 --> 27:15.240]  sell Hillary to flutter in as the VP and then he has a stroke like other
[27:15.240 --> 27:19.040]  presidents have had Woodrow Wilson that brought us the New World Order first and
[27:19.040 --> 27:23.440]  then in nurse Hillary because there's a cult of Hillary in the bureaucracy and a
[27:23.440 --> 27:28.800]  messianic vision that she's supposed to you know take over and rule everyone
[27:28.800 --> 27:35.400]  that these leftists still believe in the cult of Hillary so we'll discuss all of
[27:35.400 --> 27:42.760]  that as well today the global terrorism is something we have to look at as well
[27:42.760 --> 27:49.720]  the terrorism of masses of people with using children as human seals pouring
[27:49.720 --> 27:56.960]  across the border in mass and making us then pay for them and then setting up
[27:56.960 --> 28:02.000]  shop on average 80 plus percent military H-man criminal enterprises of drug
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.840]  dealing and prostitution and rigging the welfare system a cancer to bring down
[28:06.840 --> 28:10.720]  Europe the United States this this is a directed system you added that the
[28:10.720 --> 28:15.040]  global tourism is crashing due to coronavirus that story up on info wars
[28:15.040 --> 28:23.040]  dot com global spread of new virus brings more travel woes bands so there's
[28:23.040 --> 28:27.200]  just some of what we're going to be laying out today I want to be totally
[28:27.200 --> 28:31.360]  clear how deadly the viruses we're not sure we know it spreads easily we know
[28:31.360 --> 28:38.480]  what's man made but we know the response is tanking the supply chain and travel
[28:38.480 --> 28:42.320]  and tourism and it's it's going to be massive because as the numbers of death
[28:42.320 --> 28:45.840]  increase even it's a very low number the way things have been prepositioned it's
[28:45.840 --> 28:49.080]  going to create a loss of confidence which the Democrats and globalists called

[33:31.800 --> 33:36.160]  political conference attended by conservative activists from across the
[33:36.160 --> 33:42.000]  United States and beyond Gorka was ridiculed after calling for the removal
[33:42.000 --> 33:48.040]  of popular CPAC personalities that he doesn't like including people he says
[33:48.040 --> 33:52.480]  should have never been let in to begin with and that means independent and
[33:52.480 --> 33:57.760]  conservative voices outside the establishment conservative mainstream
[33:57.760 --> 34:02.280]  it's a big club as George Carlin would say and we ain't in it look Seb
[34:02.280 --> 34:07.800]  Gorka doesn't stand for free speech and neither does CPAC for that matter
[34:07.800 --> 34:12.480]  because when it comes down to it they're no different from the gatekeepers on the
[34:12.480 --> 34:18.640]  radical left both actively working to de-platform and censor their competition
[34:18.640 --> 34:23.760]  and this year for example the CPAC blacklist has extended all the way out
[34:23.760 --> 34:28.720]  to conservative icons like Michelle Malkin and Ann Coulter who are not
[34:28.720 --> 34:34.800]  invited and although alex jones and info wars did receive invitations it
[34:34.800 --> 34:39.320]  wasn't long before the entitled gatekeepers on the radical right did
[34:39.320 --> 34:44.520]  everything in their power to remove the outsiders like info wars reporter
[34:44.520 --> 34:50.000]  Owen shroyer and censored TVs Gavin McGinnis who are promptly kicked out of
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.360]  CPAC but hey at least they went out with style all right we've now been kicked
[34:54.360 --> 34:59.320]  out now having been kicked out of CPAC we're now being kicked out of reality
[34:59.320 --> 35:03.120]  should we continue this I didn't want to come to CPAC anyway yeah I'm having my
[35:03.120 --> 35:07.880]  own pack with with blackjack and hookers tell CPAC that we're having a bigger
[35:07.880 --> 35:11.040]  party it's gonna be more fun and there's gonna be naked ladies I just want
[35:11.040 --> 35:14.840]  everyone to know that CPAC is now kicking in for wars out I just want
[35:14.840 --> 35:19.600]  everyone to know CPAC is now kicking in for wars out God bless you guys we love
[35:19.600 --> 35:23.160]  CPAC God bless America God bless Donald Trump
[35:23.160 --> 35:26.920]  this is Harrison Smith going to a much cooler CPAC somewhere else with Gavin
[35:26.920 --> 35:31.280]  McGinnis our CPAC is cool pack that's what the acronym stands for that's right
[35:31.280 --> 35:35.400]  so a conservative political action committee is censoring itself in the
[35:35.400 --> 35:40.440]  age of censorship they have panels discussing free speech as they censor
[35:40.440 --> 35:43.840]  themselves and look at the media coverage here info wars is the most
[35:43.840 --> 35:49.800]  popular group here meanwhile Sebastian Gorka continues to publicly claim that he
[35:49.800 --> 35:57.080]  is a supporter of the First Amendment and free speech I am for free speech but
[35:57.080 --> 36:03.520]  just like the radical left his actions speak louder than words so away all right
[36:03.520 --> 36:08.640]  you guys are pooks and once he figures out he can't win an argument he wants
[36:08.640 --> 36:14.120]  use silence so we shouldn't be allowed to be here people for real conservatives
[36:14.120 --> 36:19.320]  not people who are snake oil merchants and conspiracy theorists like you
[36:19.320 --> 36:23.640]  Sebastian Gorka here for Relief Factor and first of all let me say that I have
[36:23.640 --> 36:28.200]  never before endorsed a pain reliever but when Pete and Seth Talbot the father
[36:28.200 --> 36:32.640]  and son owners of Relief Factor asked me to endorse their 100% drug-free
[36:32.640 --> 36:37.120]  product I absolutely couldn't say no and ironically the people he is trying to
[36:37.120 --> 36:42.200]  keep quiet are the very same voices who are widely credited for helping Donald
[36:42.200 --> 36:46.080]  Trump get elected to begin with info wars is the most popular group in the
[36:46.080 --> 36:49.960]  Trump movement and they're kicking info wars out Trump didn't divide American
[36:49.960 --> 36:54.040]  society Alex Jones didn't cause our widespread and by the way justified
[36:54.040 --> 36:59.360]  distrust in institutions the elites did that with their spectacular failures it
[36:59.360 --> 37:04.560]  is Gorka that doesn't fit the description as a true conservative he has
[37:04.560 --> 37:10.760]  now taken the role as an establishment insider and entitled gatekeeper he is
[37:10.760 --> 37:15.640]  the enemy inside of the gates
[37:15.640 --> 37:17.640]  ah
[37:33.320 --> 37:41.440]  agent Gorka conservative inks enemy inside the gates that important report is
[37:41.440 --> 37:46.640]  powerful and it needs legs only you can provide that by sharing the link from
[37:46.640 --> 37:50.920]  band-odd video in the Darren McBrain section or on the front page of info
[37:50.920 --> 37:55.280]  wars.com I suggest you share band-odd video does not as censored or
[37:55.280 --> 38:00.120]  restricted there it is right on the front page of band-odd video conservative
[38:00.120 --> 38:04.280]  ink agent Gorka in fact let's let's let's make that the top featured video
[38:04.280 --> 38:08.160]  now I'm gonna go to your phone calls but this is such a heavy subject the
[38:08.160 --> 38:12.120]  coronavirus and now the fact that it is super bad and is spreading fast and is
[38:12.120 --> 38:15.720]  man-made and is devastating the economy and is a globalist weapon is now
[38:15.720 --> 38:20.320]  overwhelmingly factual I've talked to a lot of prominent people off air that I
[38:20.320 --> 38:23.160]  don't want to get in fights with and call them saying you really don't think
[38:23.160 --> 38:25.520]  it's deadly you think it's a hoax they're like well no actually I think
[38:25.520 --> 38:31.120]  it's they're spraying something yeah probably who knows but almost no one
[38:31.120 --> 38:39.000]  thinks it's a hoax anymore okay my gut tells me I mean I I told my personal
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.480]  assistant three months ago I said the time has come before this I said I just
[38:43.480 --> 38:47.040]  have a feeling that things are dangerous with the economy and even if
[38:47.040 --> 38:51.200]  Trump wins I guess I got to get a farmhouse a hundred miles middle of
[38:51.200 --> 38:55.440]  nowhere around no towns in the crappiest brush area where no one even knows
[38:55.440 --> 38:59.520]  where I'm at I need to just load it with horrible food and an underground safe
[38:59.520 --> 39:02.920]  with guns in it just to have that
[39:03.480 --> 39:07.920]  covered that that box check because I don't have that we got family property
[39:07.920 --> 39:12.160]  in East Texas but that's three hours away and the maps show that if there's a
[39:12.160 --> 39:15.560]  big breakdown of society Houston's just gonna flood up Dallas is gonna flood
[39:15.560 --> 39:18.640]  now when there's a hurricane in Houston and then it looks like a war zone in
[39:18.640 --> 39:22.520]  East Texas where my family's from robberies and cars carjackings if people
[39:22.520 --> 39:25.240]  running through your property on the middle of nowhere people robbing your
[39:25.240 --> 39:32.080]  your farmhouse I mean it's just bad this country is a time bomb maybe it's a big
[39:32.080 --> 39:35.520]  war that's about to start the Islamists have launched big invasions now in phase
[39:35.520 --> 39:41.160]  two in the Europe with Erdogan right behind it I know I get calls every time
[39:41.160 --> 39:44.560]  it's ear to one whatever some say Erdogan or say Erdogan I'll get a
[39:44.560 --> 39:47.800]  linguist to tell me we got a linguist in there Daria is it Erdogan or ear to
[39:47.800 --> 39:57.200]  one Erdogan is correct okay there you go I'm not very good at pronouncing some
[39:57.200 --> 40:02.240]  things sometimes we say I got that right so Erdogan's gamble backfires as EU
[40:02.240 --> 40:09.160]  gives iron willed Greeks 780 million to secure their border sometime today after
[40:09.160 --> 40:12.680]  I take a bunch of calls but let's just say bottom of the next hour I'm gonna
[40:12.680 --> 40:17.000]  play a bunch of clips that I was watching this morning and today they're
[40:17.000 --> 40:23.920]  unbelievable of what the Islamists are doing the crimes they're committing not
[40:23.920 --> 40:27.000]  just torturing their children to then blame the police caught doing it and
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.400]  mainstream media now caught staging photo ops with them it's just all
[40:31.400 --> 40:35.280]  confirmed and then just raping and murdering and burning things and then
[40:35.280 --> 40:40.040]  the Greeks valiantly fighting back so the local leftist government sent a
[40:40.040 --> 40:46.720]  ship full of riot police of leftist to attack lesbos and so lesbos over a day
[40:46.720 --> 40:52.280]  period ran over 500 armed troops who are local leftist police into the ocean
[40:52.280 --> 40:57.280]  like 300 and then the Greek military swooped in and sealed the border and
[40:57.280 --> 41:00.480]  sealed lesbos so the central government's doing a job but they have
[41:00.480 --> 41:06.280]  leftist cities helping aid the overrun oh where have I heard of that before
[41:06.280 --> 41:11.880]  sanctuary cities and I'm not liking poor folks that come here from Latin America
[41:11.880 --> 41:16.120]  wanting a better life to the Islamic invaders most of them coming in from
[41:16.120 --> 41:18.640]  Latin America want a better job want a better life they're being exploited
[41:18.640 --> 41:21.080]  they're being used to drive down wages they're being used to become left as
[41:21.080 --> 41:24.000]  political voters that's why it's out of control got to be controlled and there's
[41:24.000 --> 41:28.760]  some crime coming across too but with the Islamic invasion it's I keep saying
[41:28.760 --> 41:34.640]  80% military age men and I looked it up it's almost 90% military age men in the
[41:34.640 --> 41:39.720]  last invasion 2015 1617 and never stopped and now it's probably over 90%
[41:39.720 --> 41:43.480]  military age men there's articles on info wars.com the one we just showed on
[41:43.480 --> 41:49.640]  news wars.com there it is you guys did it before I even said it show it's almost
[41:49.640 --> 41:58.240]  all men video after video after video there this is an invasion and they're
[41:58.240 --> 42:02.480]  blocking roads and grabbing families out of their cars and raping and killing
[42:02.480 --> 42:06.800]  people and folks are getting pissed man if I was there and I was Greek and
[42:06.800 --> 42:11.400]  somebody raped my wife listen you know what I'm gonna do to at least 10 of those
[42:11.400 --> 42:17.800]  invaders by the way Poland in places don't have one terror attack or anything
[42:17.800 --> 42:21.920]  you're an Islamic military age man you get there illegally you're never found
[42:21.920 --> 42:26.240]  again and that's how Poland survived a thousand years of invasion you either
[42:26.240 --> 42:33.960]  start protecting yourself or you die you either fight or die and that's why
[42:33.960 --> 42:38.400]  folks there's a lot of changes around here because I'm in war mode and nobody
[42:38.400 --> 42:42.480]  in a fight is gonna grab me like a woman by the hair and slam my head in the
[42:42.480 --> 42:46.560]  ground like I'm a bitch they're gonna get nothing but pure war because the
[42:46.560 --> 42:53.400]  season of war is now upon us information war culture war spiritual war
[42:53.400 --> 43:00.200]  economic war it is here so prepare across the Western world from high
[43:00.200 --> 43:06.760]  school to college sports to even the Olympics men biological men are winning
[43:06.760 --> 43:12.040]  almost all of the sporting events this is men invading women's spaces and
[43:12.040 --> 43:17.280]  bullying them and taking their rights away all in the name of the liberalism
[43:17.280 --> 43:21.520]  and openness and then every day I have stacks of news articles just like today
[43:21.520 --> 43:27.120]  UK team find under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender and
[43:27.120 --> 43:32.720]  it hurt their feelings UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman
[43:32.720 --> 43:39.040]  ordered to pay 1,000 pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new
[43:39.040 --> 43:44.520]  royalty that's the thought police if a leftist has their feelings hurt for any
[43:44.520 --> 43:49.440]  reason you get fined and you go to jail this is tyranny these people are
[43:49.440 --> 43:53.960]  bullies and it's sick and it's evil and it's part of a scientific anti-human
[43:53.960 --> 43:59.080]  takeover resist it speak out against it Alex Jones here with two big

[44:55.320 --> 45:01.920]  or store com I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an
[45:01.920 --> 45:06.520]  enterprise that is supported by all the work to help people be prepared and
[45:06.520 --> 45:10.400]  instead of just giving into sickness care take care of their health they care
[45:10.400 --> 45:13.640]  of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality and I
[45:13.640 --> 45:17.600]  say that from personal experience because I know that the products that are
[45:17.600 --> 45:22.160]  being offered here I've tried them and I use them every day and that power pack
[45:22.160 --> 45:26.120]  that they have the ampm power pack well I wouldn't be so energetic this morning
[45:26.120 --> 45:31.080]  except that I have been on a regular customer in that regard I just wanted
[45:31.080 --> 45:34.320]  to start out by saying that because I think it's important to remember that
[45:34.320 --> 45:38.160]  beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to
[45:38.160 --> 45:41.600]  think about these great events in the world one of the priorities has to be
[45:41.600 --> 45:47.880]  to take care of yourself remembering that our lives are a gift from God that
[45:47.880 --> 45:52.440]  he intends us to use for good purpose for our families and for our communities
[45:52.440 --> 45:57.080]  and right now folks who are willing to think like we do are critical to the
[45:57.080 --> 46:01.520]  future of America we always promote being prepared having firearms knowing
[46:01.520 --> 46:05.360]  how to use them and baby self-sufficient and learn how to hunt and learn how to
[46:05.360 --> 46:09.080]  garden I mean it's just what we're meant to do it feels good when we do it but we
[46:09.080 --> 46:13.400]  do sell high-quality swarble food I told my Patriot a month ago I said what can
[46:13.400 --> 46:15.440]  you handle I said I think it's gonna be really big and they said well you can
[46:15.440 --> 46:17.920]  handle probably this we're not sure we're investing everything we've got to
[46:17.920 --> 46:20.880]  even pay it forward to be able to fund I said no I think this is gonna be huge
[46:20.880 --> 46:23.640]  I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food even
[46:23.640 --> 46:26.000]  though the prices are going up for you so those are the type of discussions we
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.400]  have I'm just giving the inside baseball of all of us this is a hundred times
[46:29.400 --> 46:33.800]  regular volume plus was a hundred times a few days ago now it's about 200 times

[46:38.000 --> 46:42.240]  the fact that the orders are so ultramassive it's dizzy I mean this is

[46:46.520 --> 46:50.640]  if it continues like this we're looking at having to suspend food sauce but
[46:50.640 --> 46:54.280]  everybody gets their order in we'll get your food but that's how big this is so

[48:18.440 --> 48:21.960]  I'm gonna leave it at that I told the crew not to really make a note of it but
[48:21.960 --> 48:25.800]  they had their Beluga joke ready so I'll let them go with it I must look like a
[48:25.800 --> 48:28.640]  Beluga because I already thought of myself they already spontaneously had a
[48:28.640 --> 48:32.360]  Beluga ready so that's my new spirit animal is a Beluga well there was a
[48:32.360 --> 48:37.280]  nice little creatures okay let's get serious with something that segues from
[48:37.280 --> 48:41.760]  humor to seriousness here's that video of the now defeated master of the
[48:41.760 --> 48:45.440]  universe the technocrat and chief who was gonna tell us how to live our lives
[48:45.440 --> 48:49.800]  he said I'm gonna go across the country to tell you how to live your life and
[48:49.800 --> 48:54.960]  quote how to behave I can make Americans behave he wasn't joking but he's
[48:54.960 --> 48:59.560]  totally disconnected from reality he shakes dog's faces he he goes to like a
[48:59.560 --> 49:02.280]  buffet and sticks his fingers in and then eats it and licks them and sticks them
[49:02.280 --> 49:05.520]  back in so you talk about who to restrain who to quarantine who to lock
[49:05.520 --> 49:10.960]  up during the coronavirus well I give you patient zero that's right the now
[49:10.960 --> 49:18.000]  defeated not successful like Trump but the failure Mike Bloomberg

[49:30.760 --> 49:36.200]  in the serving dishes and then rubbing
[49:36.200 --> 49:49.520]  you know if you've ever been like an apple tree certain types of caterpillars
[49:49.520 --> 49:57.560]  is a PIG pig mini Mike now Mike didn't do too well he went way down if it's a
[49:57.560 --> 50:02.760]  real still early fall day and you're an apple orchard at least the one I was in
[50:02.760 --> 50:07.400]  was my little kid and there's all these big caterpillars eating leaves at time
[50:07.400 --> 50:11.120]  of year and if you sit back you're out there's so many of them and they're
[50:11.120 --> 50:15.000]  crunching you hear the crunch crunch of the of the caterpillars and that's
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.560]  that's what a very hungry caterpillar indeed who did not turn into a
[50:20.560 --> 50:25.680]  beautiful butterfly and become the president no he did not he slinked back
[50:25.680 --> 50:30.600]  off to his stolen rigged stock market scam and his anti-gun operations trying
[50:30.600 --> 50:35.080]  to buy off all the little governments okay I'm gonna stop and now I'm gonna
[50:35.080 --> 50:37.800]  start taking your calls right through the next hour we've got a lot of news to
[50:37.800 --> 50:42.440]  cover Dr. Francis Boyle's joining us but you know what's going on right now the
[50:42.440 --> 50:47.440]  coronavirus news is so intense so horrible so scary for me that I'm eating
[50:47.440 --> 50:52.880]  around the edges of it like a not so hungry caterpillar and not getting into
[50:52.880 --> 50:56.880]  it but killing a lot of people around the world it's very communicable it's
[50:56.880 --> 51:00.800]  man-made I want to know your take on it you disagree you agree where you think
[51:00.800 --> 51:04.200]  it's going how bad you think it's gonna get it then we have another footage we're
[51:04.200 --> 51:08.840]  into next hour it's upon enforce.com of a truck driver showing one of the big
[51:08.840 --> 51:12.520]  seaports the US just empty of containers you never see that and of
[51:12.520 --> 51:16.560]  course we know China's basically shipping almost nothing now but it's the
[51:16.560 --> 51:21.280]  visual of that is extremely powerful so that that's coming up as well next hour
[51:21.280 --> 51:26.440]  okay without further ado let's go to Philly Virginia he's a Navy vet on the
[51:26.440 --> 51:30.400]  coronavirus thanks for calling and holding hey Alex really I got to follow
[51:30.400 --> 51:34.440]  Bloomberg I got to be better than that right yes sir well that's not too hard
[51:34.440 --> 51:39.800]  is it right on the jokes this jokes aside I'm actually nervous to air what
[51:39.800 --> 51:43.760]  what I think about the coronavirus even on this show so that should tell you
[51:43.760 --> 51:47.280]  something. Well lay it on me brother because I feel something big. Yes sir yes
[51:47.280 --> 51:52.200]  sir so they they keep saying that we shouldn't worry about it if we're young
[51:52.200 --> 51:56.240]  and healthy it's only old people and compromise people that should worry
[51:56.240 --> 52:02.240]  right what is our largest unfunded liability in this country we're 23
[52:02.240 --> 52:07.200]  trillion dollars in debt and all I hear on the main it's people over 70 and hell
[52:07.200 --> 52:11.080]  Bill Gates has get rid of the old people that the liberals say the case for
[52:11.080 --> 52:16.080]  killing granny. So yesterday on Fox News there's they had a doctor on that said
[52:16.080 --> 52:20.800]  hey I expect to get this and you should too but unless you're old don't worry
[52:20.800 --> 52:26.960]  about it. So what would happen if you know we know that the biggest transfer
[52:26.960 --> 52:31.340]  of wealth in the country is going to occur as the older generation passes the
[52:31.340 --> 52:35.800]  baby boomer generation passes what if the government was able to receive some
[52:35.800 --> 52:41.920]  of that money ie have a huge crisis with this coronavirus thing and you know
[52:41.920 --> 52:45.440]  Sir I totally agree with you that it's at least a beta test for that because
[52:45.440 --> 52:49.640]  China already had a one-child policy and killed almost 400 million girls so
[52:49.640 --> 52:54.000]  don't think that governments don't think like this Bill Gates has said this at
[52:54.000 --> 52:58.120]  TED Talks and at other events we can play the clips so they're saying it you
[52:58.120 --> 53:02.760]  better damn well believe oh and who is involved cooking up a vaccine for it and
[53:02.760 --> 53:07.680]  who owns the Kamiro virus oh a subgroup Bill Gates funds wow you just can't make
[53:07.680 --> 53:12.600]  that up so I haven't heard anyone say that yet and just to come out of my
[53:12.600 --> 53:16.840]  mouth that's so just disturbing having you know we're gonna post this as a video
[53:16.840 --> 53:23.720]  report a band-up video the headline is is corona an age-specific bio weapon to
[53:23.720 --> 53:30.080]  kill the elderly before they get social security is corona virus an age-specific
[53:30.080 --> 53:37.120]  weapon targeting the elderly I think I think that's a very reasonable
[53:37.120 --> 53:42.720]  statement because it's man-made thank you sir yeah if you go to somebody's house
[53:42.720 --> 53:45.400]  because the neighbor says they haven't come out in a few days and they're beat
[53:45.400 --> 53:48.920]  to death with a hammer and there's a bloody hammer there you know it's a
[53:48.920 --> 53:52.760]  murder she'd like well we got it there's a homicides money beat this person to
[53:52.760 --> 53:58.320]  death well it's a man-made virus and it mainly targets old people so that's a
[53:58.320 --> 54:02.000]  simple invest and we're not saying that's the case that that that it's
[54:02.000 --> 54:08.480]  targeting him on purpose but that's what it does next on pond stars we've got
[54:08.480 --> 54:13.920]  chumlee coming up today you got to know what I'm talking about alright let's
[54:13.920 --> 54:18.240]  take another one Patrick in Washington you're on the air thanks for holding
[54:18.600 --> 54:24.800]  Alex yes sir yes thank you for your service sir to our country and to the
[54:24.800 --> 54:28.920]  rest of the free world thank you brother hey I'm right here in Ever
[54:28.920 --> 54:35.760]  Washington I'm a former Marine and you know I'm dialed in like you are I want
[54:35.760 --> 54:41.400]  to let you know that the shelves have been clean really clearing out Costco and
[54:41.400 --> 54:45.680]  all the all the places where you can buy the drybolt food other empty people
[54:45.680 --> 54:50.080]  don't seem to be in too much of a panic but there are people dialed in that have
[54:50.080 --> 54:56.240]  cleaned the shelves off as far as my personal experience with this thing I've
[54:56.240 --> 55:00.320]  got a co-worker who is friends with the woman who managed the health care
[55:00.320 --> 55:06.640]  facility in Kirkland Washington where we had our first death and they sent her
[55:06.640 --> 55:11.400]  home she's sick they haven't tested her they refused to test her she's at home
[55:11.400 --> 55:15.200]  sick whether she has the virus or not we don't know but we can pretty much
[55:15.200 --> 55:20.280]  assume she does also Jackson high school had a student come down with the virus
[55:20.280 --> 55:25.960]  he was sent home for a week he felt a little better came back to school spent
[55:25.960 --> 55:30.960]  half a day in the school and then went back home feeling ill well that's the
[55:30.960 --> 55:36.240]  thing about HIV is that it comes back over and over again this has an HIV
[55:36.240 --> 55:40.120]  delivery system but that wouldn't be enough it's then got a whole bunch of
[55:40.120 --> 55:44.360]  different viruses together that do different things that attack different
[55:44.360 --> 55:48.440]  parts so yeah it's a nightmare virus because it hits you and hits you and
[55:48.440 --> 55:52.000]  hits you but no one wants to discuss that no one's supposed to talk about that
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.520]  and that's why I am so pissed and let me tell you it's not a threatening thing
[55:56.520 --> 56:02.040]  to say but any of my family dies from this
[56:02.040 --> 56:06.680]  well you just fill in the blank it's time to start holding certain people
[56:06.680 --> 56:14.760]  responsible for this type of crap and Obama shipped that garbage in 2015 in
[56:14.760 --> 56:18.120]  fact bring me my coronavirus file please all three of them please pull up the
[56:18.120 --> 56:22.680]  Journal of Science I mean there was a big stir when he did that and so again
[56:22.680 --> 56:27.320]  I'm not even trying to blame Obama I'm saying that that that obviously this is
[56:27.320 --> 56:31.280]  man-made and something big is about to happen Patrick tell something already
[56:31.280 --> 56:35.480]  big is happening and that's what I try to remind people because there's a lot of
[56:35.480 --> 56:38.600]  you know where there's a lot of denial up here in Washington State in this
[56:38.600 --> 56:43.960]  left side and you know people just want to deny things and continue that that
[56:43.960 --> 56:49.600]  normalcy bias right that the Jews got on the trains willingly same sort of thing
[56:49.600 --> 56:53.400]  they want to keep going with their lives and I understand that but they got to
[56:53.400 --> 56:57.640]  realize it's the man-made virus genetically engineered they patched in
[56:57.640 --> 57:03.280]  that HIV so it shuts down your immune systems alarm response and you know it's
[57:03.280 --> 57:07.000]  much more effective than a natural virus absolutely Patrick God bless you great

[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:10.720]  products in front of me and bodies silver bullets super I got some of the
[1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:17.240]  Super Bowl blue silver before it was sold out and Michael ZX DNA force X2 Z
[1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:22.520]  shield super female vitality my wife takes selenium the chill force the
[1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:26.360]  toothpaste was using the super blue and then got the super silver which is even
[1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:33.080]  just even greater but I had surgery last fall and had a shoulder replacement and
[1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:37.760]  after about two weeks after the surgery I developed this respiratory issue in my
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:42.360]  bronchial and I just nothing was happening the doctors weren't able to
[1:01:42.360 --> 1:01:46.080]  help me with anything it just went on and on couldn't talk without coughing and
[1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:53.360]  coughing and I thought well maybe this is a fungal thing and so I started taking
[1:01:53.360 --> 1:02:00.800]  the Michael ZX last week I started taking it and was on it for four or five
[1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:06.520]  days and then I had the DNA force I had it and I stopped taking it for some
[1:02:06.520 --> 1:02:10.560]  reason after the surgery because maybe I'm having some reaction to that but I
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:18.000]  started taking the DNA force four days ago again and just two days ago I had a
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:21.960]  just a terrible coughing fit just cough and cough and cough and coughing stuff
[1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:28.840]  up and then my lungs have been better I'm breathing better and not having the
[1:02:28.840 --> 1:02:33.520]  the tension that was in my breathing and I just I attributed to the Michael ZX and
[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:38.040]  the DNA force thinking that it was well well sir listen we have callers calling
[1:02:38.040 --> 1:02:40.400]  they go you know I've been listening for years and love your info but I
[1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:44.680]  thought you were just teasing this is good stuff DNA force has proven pqq and
[1:02:44.680 --> 1:02:48.360]  coq 10 and then other factors that ought to break him with that turbo charge
[1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:53.960]  those dosages to get them into the cells they literally regrow mitochondria again
[1:02:53.960 --> 1:02:58.360]  and that's the engines of the cell the mitochondrial DNA so yeah my finger got
[1:02:58.360 --> 1:03:03.120]  chopped off like 18 years ago and it was numb for six seven years when I finally
[1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:08.840]  got on DNA force the feeling came back in about six months the danger is a lot
[1:03:08.840 --> 1:03:12.640]  of people had nerve damage it was so painful that they put up with it it goes
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:17.240]  away you can take DNA force and the nerves start going back and the old pain
[1:03:17.240 --> 1:03:22.520]  comes back so let's not just tell people it's a panacea sometimes old pain comes
[1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:25.640]  back because it's regrowing nerves all over the body and then usually it's
[1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:29.160]  better after a while but some people call they go yeah you're right man I'm my
[1:03:29.160 --> 1:03:33.080]  leg was broken around Achilles tear and kind of ignored it and you know I got
[1:03:33.080 --> 1:03:36.320]  on this and the pain came back but now I'm you know now now overall I have more
[1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:39.680]  use my Achilles and I'm talking about myself as well it's help of my Achilles
[1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:43.680]  has blown 90% people can't believe I walk around on it but absolutely sir
[1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:46.600]  that's what we're talking about what's your view on coronavirus in the West
[1:03:46.600 --> 1:03:53.120]  Coast well you know I was in Costco a couple weeks ago and talking I had your
[1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:57.440]  had the show going on when my across my speakerphone while I was going through
[1:03:57.440 --> 1:04:01.680]  Costco and I came across this lady and she says well who are you listening to
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:07.520]  I said that's Alex Jones she said I thought he was off the air and so I went
[1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:11.000]  ahead and educated her and told her where to go on them and don't hang up
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:15.280]  we're back in 60 seconds only to start over because what he's saying is the
[1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:18.520]  secret to everything in the info or not just for this broadcast but for all of

[1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:36.760]  and the great Daniel Taylor she get him on mankind now never before seen fight
[1:07:36.760 --> 1:07:41.640]  for survival the globalists are giving us a little taste of what they'll do to
[1:07:41.640 --> 1:07:45.680]  make us submit to their control grid just as I expose in the first six minutes
[1:07:45.680 --> 1:07:51.040]  of in-game blueprint for global enslavement how they will use bio weapons
[1:07:51.040 --> 1:07:56.000]  in the fear of bio weapons for total control that's how China will try to
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:00.760]  stop it uprising which was happening not just in Hong Kong but inside China they
[1:08:00.760 --> 1:08:05.040]  released a bio weapon has a low kill rate but still if you get killed by it
[1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:11.000]  it's like one man's recession is a depression if you're out of work going
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.760]  bankrupt about be homeless you're in a depression your neighbor well that's a
[1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:17.360]  recession well if you're the 2% that looks like that's what they're saying
[1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:23.920]  now this kills walk out of the door every day and you on your block but say
[1:08:23.920 --> 1:08:27.320]  there's a hundred people live on your block and come back every day and two
[1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:32.480]  people aren't there that's a big deal that's what the Pentagon has been told
[1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:36.120]  they believe is going on now the military people I've talked to they know
[1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:39.440]  just because it comes from on how to mean it's accurate but that's what they're
[1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:45.200]  being told to prepare for and that's a pretty big news isn't it and that's the
[1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:48.000]  numbers you see too that's the best numbers I mean what I got from the
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:52.160]  Pentagon is what we already know just that's what they're saying and they
[1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:55.080]  believe three plus million dead Americans the next six months is going to
[1:08:55.080 --> 1:08:59.600]  absolutely create a crisis that's even bigger than we currently see this is all
[1:08:59.600 --> 1:09:04.280]  about suspending the election and then trying to say Trump is illegitimate
[1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:09.680]  that I mean government by committing you could smell it from a mile away this is it
[1:09:09.680 --> 1:09:12.560]  so
[1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:18.880]  Hanuman from Oregon called in he hit the break he was telling story that I want
[1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:22.880]  him to repeat from the beginning because he got cut off because this is what
[1:09:22.880 --> 1:09:28.120]  happens to me every day everywhere I go and again it's perception you know media
[1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:32.120]  lies about a lot of things they lie about Trump or they lie about abortion or
[1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:37.240]  they lie about guns but when you hear him say a plane crash and this happened
[1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:39.920]  here or this happened there you think well that's that mean they can't lie
[1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:44.400]  about something that big oh yeah they do that too there's a lot of examples not
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:48.000]  just Jesse Small but ABC saying Trump allowed Turkey to blow up a whole city
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.520]  and it was really a machine gun shootout event they blew the video up to make it
[1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:56.920]  look like again a giant dinosaur was attacking a city or something complete
[1:09:56.920 --> 1:10:01.480]  with mushroom clouds they said were 5,000 feet tall that were 10 feet tall like
[1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:04.400]  that army men on the table fighting I told you they were real that's the
[1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:13.280]  culture of the stain and arrogance with these people and so when you pull back
[1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:17.280]  from this and you see the public yeah they get there being lied to but they
[1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:23.240]  don't get how it's now another level so people walk up to me everywhere and they
[1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:28.960]  say Alex I wish you were still on air because they would watch me on YouTube
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:31.360]  or they would watch me on Twitter or they would watch me or they would pick up
[1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:34.840]  the feeds of our podcast all of that our podcast is still there still free
[1:10:34.840 --> 1:10:40.480]  info wars.com forward slash show you watch the feeds but for them to hear I
[1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:45.480]  was the platform to hear I was off air they always saw a Chris Matthews or a
[1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:49.400]  Matt Lauer or whoever or a Bill O'Reilly well they're off the air well you think
[1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:52.680]  well they're off the air because there isn't really anybody that has their own
[1:10:52.680 --> 1:10:56.880]  radio TV satellites and affiliates that they do it's only two or three other
[1:10:56.880 --> 1:11:00.120]  networks and that that's all establishment and they all try to line
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:03.680]  up like Gorka and others do to be with the New World Order so they don't get
[1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:08.920]  taken off air they all subserviate themselves they all bootlick they have
[1:11:08.920 --> 1:11:14.200]  better word for it called but like but sorry family show let's just say their
[1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:20.200]  noses are not covered in chocolate and and and and so that's the world these
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:24.600]  people live in but the general public doesn't know so if you tell them hey
[1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:27.480]  you heard that show that's the most hated most attacked everywhere you know
[1:11:27.480 --> 1:11:32.320]  it's still on the air that is the power of person to person that is a
[1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:36.600]  coronavirus but it's knowledge like a fire being lit in the minds of men as
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:39.640]  Thomas Jefferson said we need to set brush fires in the minds of men and
[1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:44.000]  women everywhere so start your story over again please sir from Oregon and
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:48.920]  you men go ahead hi so yes I was in Costco a couple weeks ago I was getting
[1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:53.160]  ready I went to buy a bunch of toilet paper and some things before the crowds
[1:11:53.160 --> 1:11:59.040]  really hit and I had my phone I had your show going on sticking on my pocket so
[1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:04.920]  I could hear it I wasn't using headphones and I this lady starts says who's who
[1:12:04.920 --> 1:12:09.400]  you listening to who's that talking and I expected at first I thought because of
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:13.880]  where I live it's quite a leftist city and I thought I might get some flak but
[1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:18.360]  I said this is Alex Jones and she just got her eyes got wide open and she says
[1:12:18.360 --> 1:12:24.080]  I'm really I thought he was off the air and I said no and I told her I explained
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:27.720]  you know the whole situation and told her where to go she wrote down you know
[1:12:27.720 --> 1:12:31.520]  banned that video and also info words calm and just said she's he's still on
[1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:35.440]  and she we talked about 20 minutes about things and it was really quite a
[1:12:35.440 --> 1:12:41.400]  wonderful connection you know to have that and she was really grateful and I
[1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:47.440]  just you know it was it was great to have that and by the way Alex I was
[1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:51.280]  watching the show when you said something sometime back about sure in
[1:12:51.280 --> 1:12:55.480]  your head and I kept looking I said when's he gonna do that when's he gonna
[1:12:55.480 --> 1:12:59.240]  do that and I said look that you this morning you did it and I think you look
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:02.920]  great you know you look like a warrior it's just so much it's just such a weight
[1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:07.520]  to be off the head and so I just commend you I tell you I don't really like how
[1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:12.240]  it looks but man does it feel good no no no it doesn't matter I mean we did to
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:19.440]  beyond beyond that and but I I wanted to ask you something about you were
[1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:23.840]  talking about the the coronavirus you know I bought all kinds of masks I went
[1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:28.920]  to the Lowe's you know about three or four weeks ago and looking for masks and
[1:13:28.920 --> 1:13:34.120]  I said to the girl where you know we're in 1995 and 95 masks and she said
[1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:37.280]  only right here and she I said he's selling lunch so yeah we can't keep them
[1:13:37.280 --> 1:13:44.400]  in stock and I and I'm in this situation where you know we're in the heart of it
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:50.000]  and I just I'm taking all these things to build my immune system I'm pushing
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  70 years old and I'm I don't know what to make of it all I don't believe what I
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:00.560]  hear you know through the meat I don't listen to the news anyway I get my
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:07.240]  sources you know online and from you but I it's like have I already got it
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:12.120]  you know am I exposed I'm you on well we know I mean you can blame the CDC
[1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:14.960]  Trump and I'm I'm never for cover-ups but I get why they're doing it whether
[1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:18.640]  it's Trump the CDC but I think Trump's involved this is to be honest they're
[1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:22.000]  they're not sitting out cats they sent out faulty ones on purpose they know
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:26.040]  it's been here it's Deep Akinix really is smart he has tied into operations and
[1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:28.760]  all of them and he said it on there he said it's been here for six months it's
[1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:32.080]  already killed a bunch of people and we're just kind of make it through it so
[1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:35.120]  he tries to get ahead of the panic saying everything's okay and I get as a
[1:14:35.120 --> 1:14:38.000]  psychiatrist you know he doesn't want to yell fire in a theater as an authority
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:41.360]  figure I just think it's important for us to go ahead and just kind of tell
[1:14:41.360 --> 1:14:45.960]  people looks like this is pretty bad because if it is killing 2% that's no
[1:14:45.960 --> 1:14:49.760]  game and I don't want to say I have it I haven't gone and gotten tested they
[1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:52.880]  won't even really test you it's all over the news they're just refusing people I
[1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:57.560]  just hadn't had a cold in almost five years four plus years and sure as the
[1:14:57.560 --> 1:15:03.120]  sure as the devil man I've had a fever went away came back again and I've been
[1:15:03.120 --> 1:15:06.120]  coughing coughing coughing taking a ton of silver in a bunch of you a force it
[1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:08.680]  looks like it's pretty much gone now hopefully but I thought that about a
[1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:13.680]  couple days in three or four weeks ago then it came back and so everybody I
[1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:17.400]  know is hacking there's a bunch of weird stuff going on so again they could be
[1:15:17.400 --> 1:15:23.120]  using the human virus as a cover for other stuff I mean something big is
[1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:26.600]  going on brother I really appreciate your calling great points that was a great
[1:15:26.600 --> 1:15:29.040]  call we just spent two segments with him and I'm gonna get to everybody else
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:34.080]  Ernie and Jim and Rick and Dennis and Barbara I think Barbara's up next when
[1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:40.000]  we come back but absolutely it's crazy how they tried to get us off the air it
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  didn't work and now the show is just re-assurging and exploding and the enemy
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:48.520]  knows that so they'll probably take a physical shot at me so I am in God's
[1:15:48.520 --> 1:15:54.680]  hands I give it to Jesus and I have no fear I am committed to the Lord's hands

[1:20:49.800 --> 1:20:56.040]  flapping around me that's bad luck I wouldn't do that anyways I have children
[1:20:56.040 --> 1:21:00.680]  you get up there and hope something's bad so you make money you put a big-ass
[1:21:00.680 --> 1:21:03.880]  target on your head that's the analogy of God hitting you with a bolt of
[1:21:03.880 --> 1:21:10.720]  lightning no no here's an example we've been all over the country in Texas and in
[1:21:10.720 --> 1:21:14.800]  Virginia and in DC and a bunch of other places with the armored vehicle
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:20.320]  Pennsylvania the list goes on and on and the police like us and we go in bullhorn
[1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:24.080]  and it's a big driving billboard has been very successful I want to thank the
[1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:27.680]  losers for supporting us so we could get it we rented it first got huge effect
[1:21:27.680 --> 1:21:32.600]  huge national headlines I mean it's incredible paid for itself in four or
[1:21:32.600 --> 1:21:39.000]  five events we're driving we've driven past the Capitol I'm bullhorning the
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:42.680]  corrupt judge Amy Berman Jackson who literally rigged the jury and got caught
[1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:51.560]  and I've stopped bullhorning out of the top of the tank and the two drivers
[1:21:51.560 --> 1:21:58.360]  former special forces you hero Patrick is it was great guys are like man it's
[1:21:58.360 --> 1:22:01.280]  great the cops wave at us people drive by holding out your x2 out the window you
[1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:04.920]  they love you man look at all the black folks they see me the biggest fans I
[1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:07.480]  mean it's just like crazy in DC the black folks are like the black man almost
[1:22:07.480 --> 1:22:11.440]  yeah yeah yeah Trump Roger Stone you know it's BS I mean that's what the
[1:22:11.440 --> 1:22:14.880]  Democrats are panicking folks he didn't 30% of black men support no supporting
[1:22:14.880 --> 1:22:18.800]  Trump's way higher the system because they all knew Trump was an anti-black was
[1:22:18.800 --> 1:22:25.160]  pro-america before so the hoax is dropping and I literally sit there in
[1:22:25.160 --> 1:22:31.600]  the armored vehicle bringing some water around back the hotel and I go yeah it's
[1:22:31.600 --> 1:22:33.840]  crazy I've been pulled over by the cops you're right but I said that's probably
[1:22:33.840 --> 1:22:40.200]  bad luck though to even say it now one minute after I say this the Secret
[1:22:40.200 --> 1:22:46.880]  Service pulls over the the the vehicle behind us we had a another car
[1:22:46.880 --> 1:22:52.960]  trailing a black minivan we had a suburban in front of us and they'd been
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:55.840]  sent over there not by Trump but by whoever put in a false report that we
[1:22:55.840 --> 1:22:59.080]  were doing something legal we had other folks claim we had guns on us and we're
[1:22:59.080 --> 1:23:02.240]  brandishing them we later learn that happened another place the left goes
[1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:04.960]  that they're on an armored vehicle pointing guns at us well here comes a
[1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:10.000]  Secret Service all bunch of them and at first they were all tense and once they
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.960]  figured out what's going on they were real nice we shook hands and it was the
[1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:17.400]  you know the uniform Secret Service but they have like six vehicles total you
[1:23:17.400 --> 1:23:21.440]  know came down on us because some left us they wouldn't say what was said but we
[1:23:21.440 --> 1:23:25.400]  learned later at the hotel a leftist said that our guys had guns out and that
[1:23:25.400 --> 1:23:29.200]  we had we had DC police hired that had guns in DC our security guys didn't have
[1:23:29.200 --> 1:23:32.280]  guns because even security guys even cops can't have guns at DC every now
[1:23:32.280 --> 1:23:37.200]  from BC so we were dealing with that but that's not the reason I'm tell the story
[1:23:37.200 --> 1:23:43.560]  the minute we said man the cops always love us we never get pulled over it
[1:23:43.560 --> 1:23:50.400]  happened so that's this whole tempting fate situation and I've not wanted this
[1:23:50.400 --> 1:23:55.080]  to be bad I said SARS was a bunch of hype I've made films how they're gonna use
[1:23:55.080 --> 1:23:58.080]  bioattacks for political control to crack down but when they really start
[1:23:58.080 --> 1:24:01.880]  doing it I've said it's gonna be stronger and stronger at first a little
[1:24:01.880 --> 1:24:06.000]  deadly then more deadly then more communicable and we know the global's
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:10.800]  release HIV it's a it's a mutation virus that that keeps attacking over and
[1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:15.160]  over again attacks the T lymphocyte by blood cells this things man made it's
[1:24:15.160 --> 1:24:19.640]  got the HIV delivery system yeah I'm concerned but I don't just go off all
[1:24:19.640 --> 1:24:28.200]  the intellectual stuff right here man I'm pissed at the globalist and want to
[1:24:28.200 --> 1:24:33.680]  tear somebody's head off so as a father and as a man I feel sickeningly angry
[1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:36.840]  not the type of anger where you're out of control the type of anger where you
[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:41.840]  just tear somebody's head off you know what I'm talking about and I rarely feel
[1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:47.680]  that kind of anger unless you know so my brain looks my spirit looks at this it
[1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:54.160]  just goes oh oh oh this is bad and you now see it it's devastating economies
[1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:57.880]  around the world devastating terrorism countries all over are using it to
[1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:00.600]  crack down notice the Italy's run by authoritarians now they took it over
[1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:03.960]  from the populace China is they're all doing it so that's why they're shutting
[1:25:03.960 --> 1:25:08.840]  down sports stadiums and events and all of this but we'd have a discussion about
[1:25:08.840 --> 1:25:13.560]  how bad this is really gonna get and what its real motive is and where you
[1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:21.600]  think it came from but I legitimately in the pit of my stomach and just just
[1:25:21.600 --> 1:25:27.920]  I'm just like I'm not I'm not scared I'm like ready to get in the fight and I
[1:25:27.920 --> 1:25:31.600]  think that's that's what all this symbolizes you know shaving my head this
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:35.400]  morning I got up and said I'm saving my head and I said it's just a symbol of
[1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:38.440]  we're in a war folks and when you really go into a war you shave your head so
[1:25:38.440 --> 1:25:41.560]  people don't grab your hair and that's just an archetypal image of this is not
[1:25:41.560 --> 1:25:46.040]  normal we're not normal waters here we're in a war people better get that
[1:25:46.040 --> 1:25:49.360]  through their heads that's all I'm saying I think you all know that as well we
[1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:54.120]  don't want to get played into hysteria no no no we're concerned because our gut
[1:25:54.120 --> 1:25:57.200]  knows something big is going on the question is what is it Barbara in
[1:25:57.200 --> 1:26:00.000]  Florida thanks for holding we love you and appreciate you what's your take on
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:05.120]  this hi well first we want to say we love you and you save in life and we
[1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:12.320]  thank Jesus for you back at you we didn't hear you saying anything about this
[1:26:12.320 --> 1:26:21.080]  so we wanted to call two girls from Florida flew back from Milan and we
[1:26:21.080 --> 1:26:25.360]  got a breaking news the other night from channel 13 so we read it and the girls
[1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:32.320]  were saying they were sick on the plane so when they got to New York to fly to
[1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:36.600]  Florida they stopped because they didn't think they should they call the CDC
[1:26:36.600 --> 1:26:41.880]  CDC didn't know what they were talking about didn't sound like they knew what
[1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:47.760]  they were doing and they told them it's okay you cleared to go from we don't
[1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:53.320]  know what you have put in New York to Tampa Florida they flew here they ended
[1:26:53.320 --> 1:26:58.160]  up getting tests they both had it so we're just imagining how many people in
[1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:01.720]  Miami I did not know about that and I did not say that's what I'm being told is
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:05.200]  we're not being told one one hundred that what's really going on did you see
[1:27:05.200 --> 1:27:11.120]  that the national news I never did it was not me it was a news report out of
[1:27:11.120 --> 1:27:17.920]  channel 13 in Tampa guys look at a woman test positive from Milan flight in
[1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:23.200]  Tampa is that the headline two days ago I'm just going with a headline that I
[1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:30.120]  do you remember what the headline was we'll look it up it's okay but it was
[1:27:30.120 --> 1:27:35.760]  something like two women test positive from flight from Milan and they were
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:39.480]  front they stopped in New York to call the CDC because they were they didn't
[1:27:39.480 --> 1:27:43.520]  want to get on the flight to Tampa and they were told they should get on the
[1:27:43.520 --> 1:27:49.200]  flight to Tampa so they did but you imagine all the people in in both
[1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:53.520]  airports that the big bag and channel is the there it is there it is just like
[1:27:53.520 --> 1:27:57.880]  you said out of Florida Tampa Bay woman who tested positive coronavirus flew
[1:27:57.880 --> 1:28:01.360]  into Tampa International Airport the airport said staff had increased
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:05.160]  cleaning and sanitation on high touch areas it's it's coming out of your nose
[1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:10.040]  it's coming out of your mouth and her sister also tested positive now says two
[1:28:10.040 --> 1:28:13.240]  people yeah there it is there's the local channel for exactly what you're
[1:28:13.240 --> 1:28:18.760]  saying yeah so just wanted to let you know and then there's the third man and
[1:28:18.760 --> 1:28:26.040]  then there's a place in Sarasota that the woman was a nurse for the man that's
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:29.920]  in the hospital by the way man as you're saying this they're pulling up
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:35.760]  exactly what you're saying this has not been in the national news wow wow yeah
[1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:40.680]  we thought it was big we're running fattening out in north of Tampa but we're

[1:33:11.320 --> 1:33:22.560]  the answer to 1984 is the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex
[1:33:22.560 --> 1:33:28.880]  jones show it is my duty as an American citizen sworn to defend against the
[1:33:28.880 --> 1:33:42.120]  Satanist operation that this platform launched UKIP to Brexit victory launched
[1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:48.200]  the new Brazilian president to victory launched Trump to victory and has
[1:33:48.200 --> 1:33:53.880]  ignited the giant Eastern Europe resistance to the new world order every
[1:33:53.880 --> 1:34:04.040]  one of those leaders has acknowledged that info wars was the catalyst to quote
[1:34:04.040 --> 1:34:10.160]  energize and radicalize them and then created the template messaging blueprint
[1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:18.720]  to carry the fight the victory it is my duty to report to you my son wants to
[1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:25.720]  start a podcast called I'm not bragging and I got busy we never got around to it
[1:34:25.720 --> 1:34:30.360]  but I always want to say I'm not tooting my horn about bragging that's not what
[1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:34.920]  this is it'd be like battle the bulge if we turn the Nazis back and finally we're
[1:34:34.920 --> 1:34:40.000]  winning the war or it what happened in Russia at Stalingrad turn the Nazis
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:46.800]  back it's not bragging when you announce you're beginning to turn the tide and so
[1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:53.120]  it is twilight zone you know sometimes I sit there and I think is this like that
[1:34:53.120 --> 1:35:06.480]  1980s movie total recall Philip K. Dick book he was a smart guy PKD and he got a
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:10.640]  local cop and he goes in to have his virtual reality deal where they jack you
[1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:16.200]  in and he wants to be a secret agent and then they put him in it and then it
[1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:19.560]  totally freaks him out and secret agents come to kill him but really has a
[1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:23.960]  psychotic break and you know at the end did he really save Mars and you know did
[1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:28.960]  they really activate that you know the other reactor and it ends like a lot of
[1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:35.280]  PKD books the un-teleported man the list goes on and on you don't know if it was
[1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:39.800]  a hallucination from the machine or whether it really happened and but I
[1:35:39.800 --> 1:35:43.120]  know you're real but let me tell you it's kind of like that like okay and then
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:48.200]  in full wars launched the UKIP takeover and then we launched Balasaro and then
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:53.640]  and the Trump before that and that it's acknowledged but see it's not Alex Jones
[1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:57.960]  that did it I was just a focal point in a catalyst and somebody that wanted to go
[1:35:57.960 --> 1:36:01.640]  in with good intention and did the right thing created a system and had a vision
[1:36:01.640 --> 1:36:08.440]  that God gave me you got the nationalist and Patriot selected worldwide you
[1:36:08.440 --> 1:36:12.680]  spread the links you spread the articles you did the videos you spoke up you got
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:22.240]  ridiculed and you've done in credible things amazing things and that's why
[1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:29.520]  they're launching this virus that is the answer the answer to 1776 by the
[1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:46.040]  1984 crowd is the coronavirus see we have the answer to 1984 is 1776 but
[1:36:46.040 --> 1:37:02.240]  there answer 1776 is the coronavirus think about that all right let's go to
[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:05.560]  your phone calls let's rack them and stack them go these great people on the
[1:37:05.560 --> 1:37:11.920]  air who's been holding the longest would it be Rick would it be Jim it would be

[1:37:15.840 --> 1:37:22.520]  for holding it on the air welcome hey good morning Alex welcome sir real quick
[1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:26.680]  thank you for meant first of all may God bless you your family your crew and
[1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:30.960]  their families and thank you for providing the symbiotic relationship
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:35.600]  where we provide you with ammunition you provide us with ammunition and I'm
[1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:39.400]  gonna make two quick points the brother that's how families work that's how
[1:37:39.400 --> 1:37:46.280]  Christ works we're all together you can feel the power can't you yes sir two
[1:37:46.280 --> 1:37:51.240]  quick points first of all the what I've been hearing a lot well one of the
[1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:54.920]  theories out there is that this is gonna burn itself out when the weather gets
[1:37:54.920 --> 1:37:59.000]  warm well my concern is when the weather gets warm what else comes out
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:05.720]  mosquitoes oh my gosh the little blood they can spread it what happens what
[1:38:05.720 --> 1:38:10.920]  happens when you supercharge mosquitoes with the coronavirus how is the disc
[1:38:10.920 --> 1:38:15.160]  the weather getting warm gonna dull it down I think it's gonna not pump it with
[1:38:15.160 --> 1:38:21.600]  nitrous oxide like a race car man that's why I love taking calls the other
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:25.800]  caller calls in and rings up angles we hadn't gone with is it a age-specific
[1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:30.080]  bio weapon to get rid of retirees ahead of their payouts which Bill Gates is
[1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:33.120]  salivating over and then you bring up they're saying oh hopefully they don't
[1:38:33.120 --> 1:38:36.400]  know hopefully it's better in warm weather and it's like the flu but it's
[1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:40.040]  not it's like HIV which doesn't get affected by the temperature you know
[1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:45.760]  mainly warm water warm water is not gonna get rid of it and in fact it could
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:49.520]  actually make it worse and I've my wife and I have been following you and Mike
[1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:54.320]  from the beginning on this and I haven't heard anybody mention this that's why I
[1:38:54.320 --> 1:38:57.520]  didn't know you can correct me if I'm wrong no that's why I can't call it
[1:38:57.520 --> 1:39:00.240]  rather because you just come up with angles that like why didn't I think of
[1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:08.760]  that well that and you couple that with well like well obviously UN evil all
[1:39:08.760 --> 1:39:12.440]  that why aren't they telling her again to stand down with this invasion so it's
[1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:18.160]  like do you realize we're in a pandemic there's this stuff spreading stop it no
[1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:23.320]  they're not saying the Dean saying to him and our borders are wide open you
[1:39:23.320 --> 1:39:30.080]  guys were just talking about that yes or yesterday about Mr. Rose some borders
[1:39:30.080 --> 1:39:33.680]  are wide open why don't we bring our troops back to Afghanistan put them on
[1:39:33.680 --> 1:39:39.440]  the dang border sealed all four borders I totally agree to what you make of the
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:44.680]  EU capitulating to reality and given 700 plus million dollars and praising
[1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:48.560]  Greece stopping on a giant Islamic invasion by Turkey I mean finally
[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:54.800]  reality is dawning because Europe is revolting right and then Trump wouldn't
[1:39:54.800 --> 1:39:59.720]  take advantage of this now he could he could really come out of this on top if
[1:39:59.720 --> 1:40:03.920]  he just sticks to what he says he was gonna do oh Pat Buchanan said it last
[1:40:03.920 --> 1:40:09.480]  week Trump's missing a grand opportunity to prove that globalism is the problem
[1:40:09.480 --> 1:40:14.080]  and the nationalism and and compartmentalization freedom but walls to
[1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:18.800]  compartmentalize is the answer good walls make good neighbors thank you so
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:23.000]  much sir I appreciate your call like firewalls in a ship or firewalls in
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:26.560]  apartment complex you put it there so the fire starts in one apartment it
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:30.600]  doesn't spread to the next it's simple that's why you put barriers if we put
[1:40:30.600 --> 1:40:34.120]  speed bumps up in your neighborhood so some idiot tears and run your five-year
[1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:38.360]  old over when they're riding their tricycle or their bicycle I mean it's
[1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:42.320]  it's an all the libertarians and I'm a libertarian in ideas but there was an
[1:40:42.320 --> 1:40:46.040]  all we need born no borders and everything's too much there's other
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:50.760]  governments spin up and then come attack you that's just an organization we need
[1:40:50.760 --> 1:40:54.400]  government to limit government very limited to protect our freedoms that's
[1:40:54.400 --> 1:41:00.680]  America and yeah we've gotten away from that but just there's not a realism to
[1:41:00.680 --> 1:41:05.480]  people that are constantly saying oh I'm an anarchist capitalist I don't want
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:10.680]  any government I want capitalism in the market decide yeah but we don't even
[1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:13.960]  have a free market right now we have Soros and the globalist rigging
[1:41:13.960 --> 1:41:19.240]  everything and so it's a fascist model living on top of the ruins of a free
[1:41:19.240 --> 1:41:23.760]  market system that was never perfect it's the ideals we have to strive for but
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:27.840]  always there's people that want the perfection of an idea I know so many
[1:41:27.840 --> 1:41:31.200]  people will never launch an operation they'll never go do an interview they'll
[1:41:31.200 --> 1:41:33.960]  never take action because they're always waiting to get it just right and have
[1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:37.400]  meetings about it and talk about it all day and oh and then debating was it
[1:41:37.400 --> 1:41:43.600]  this way or that way theoretically action is what builds momentum and what
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:48.280]  builds force and what builds destiny and what builds training in the real
[1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:53.560]  universe so have goodwill study history ask God for guidance and then go out
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:57.960]  and do what's right and then as things happen you can change your angle you're
[1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:01.480]  always going for justice and truth but you have to use the systems that are
[1:42:01.480 --> 1:42:07.080]  there to then get to the goal you have to adapt and improvise and overcome not
[1:42:07.080 --> 1:42:10.960]  adapt to the tyranny not adapt by getting on your knees but adapt by I
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:15.160]  can't push that whole thing over right now but this little enemy I can start
[1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:18.920]  getting strong on this guy and the next you're toppling this guy and the next
[1:42:18.920 --> 1:42:23.960]  it's this guy and that's it and you said and and you know what even if you get
[1:42:23.960 --> 1:42:27.520]  destroyed when you take on that big one everybody else is watching by that
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:31.520]  example and they're not scared when they watch you get torn apart by the big
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:36.240]  enemy juggernaut that doesn't scare men the truth is it inspires them and it's
[1:42:36.240 --> 1:42:42.120]  in the jaws of the enemy that we find real victory it's in that not wanting
[1:42:42.120 --> 1:42:47.200]  to be destroyed but being willing to do it that inspires inspires that spirit
[1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:54.480]  that Alamo spirit that is unstoppable and I am here with you to invoke it
[1:42:54.480 --> 1:42:58.040]  everybody needs food I'm proud we're selling high quality food elections
[1:42:58.040 --> 1:43:02.240]  globalism the economy the bubble this is something you need on your checklist to
[1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:07.600]  have done but for me it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food and I
[1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:10.960]  had long discussions this morning over an hour long discussion with different
[1:43:10.960 --> 1:43:14.440]  individuals at different levels of this right now the folks run the plants to get
[1:43:14.440 --> 1:43:18.400]  the best idea we have but they want me to say six to eight weeks just so people
[1:43:18.400 --> 1:43:22.120]  aren't getting pissed but understand the last food company the biggest food
[1:43:22.120 --> 1:43:26.680]  company is now at hundreds of times their regular order and they were having
[1:43:26.680 --> 1:43:30.560]  discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales next week and at
[1:43:30.560 --> 1:43:33.480]  a certain point just saying we're done because people are going to take food
[1:43:33.480 --> 1:43:37.320]  orders out 10 weeks we don't want to sit on your money 10 weeks and then just all
[1:43:37.320 --> 1:43:40.440]  the weirdness that comes with that because we're honest under promise over
[1:43:40.440 --> 1:43:43.520]  delivered but technically it's gonna be six to eight weeks and we want you to get
[1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:46.920]  a great deal and feel like we took care of you so you come back again we want

[1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:29.240]  tyranny well so does he lie from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's
[1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:54.160]  Alex Jones. It's official March 5th, Thursday, 2020, 2-4-2 out from the
[1:47:54.160 --> 1:48:02.200]  election coronavirus is the big one so far for bio weapons man-made creating
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:06.680]  total fear governments using it to create hysteria and lockdowns of
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:11.160]  civilization Trump trying to play it down I understand why I can't faulty for
[1:48:11.160 --> 1:48:15.440]  it but they are suppressing the testing they are covering it up that's even in
[1:48:15.440 --> 1:48:20.600]  the news now and the left is using it against the president just like we
[1:48:20.600 --> 1:48:27.320]  predicted listen to this for just a second this is a really good music
[1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:32.960]  home the bell tolls from ride the lightning listen to this when I was
[1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:37.440]  like 12 years old I'm like man this sounds good
[1:48:41.800 --> 1:48:48.800]  all right let's get back into the news your phone calls but I want to air this
[1:48:48.800 --> 1:48:52.360]  just one more time than I'm gonna stop I heard it four times already since
[1:48:52.360 --> 1:49:00.000]  yesterday this is Mike Bloomberg who is the reverse Howard Hughes as our great
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:04.800]  boom operator John was saying earlier that's something I stole from him
[1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:10.040]  imagine Howard Hughes would lock himself up scared of germs we didn't have sex
[1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:16.400]  with prostitutes all day at the same time it's a paradox isn't and then you've
[1:49:16.400 --> 1:49:20.680]  got Bloomberg who's always caught on tape Joe Biden likes to kiss little girls
[1:49:20.680 --> 1:49:23.880]  on the lips and tell them that they're making horny that's that's audio with
[1:49:23.880 --> 1:49:27.920]  that Chris Matthews tells a woman that's a guest you look very beautiful he's
[1:49:27.920 --> 1:49:32.280]  fired I mean again just normal human activities illegal but you know pedophiles
[1:49:32.280 --> 1:49:37.400]  having kids bounce on their laps at pedophile storytime is okay but him
[1:49:37.400 --> 1:49:40.640]  sticking his fingers if you're a radio listener there's like a buffet he's at
[1:49:40.640 --> 1:49:44.200]  people went to the campaign event he's just they saw sir have some foods he's
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:48.560]  like getting food eating it licking his fingers and sticking his fingers back in
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:55.080]  it like a giant fly and again this is just emblematic of this control freak
[1:49:55.080 --> 1:50:00.080]  that wants to run our lives but he's so tone-deaf that he's got the etiquette of
[1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:03.000]  a three-year-old here it is
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:23.840]  he also eats with his mouth and then he wipes it back up there he's wiping his
[1:50:23.840 --> 1:50:33.280]  hands on the iced tea pitcher top once he puts his hands on where you get your
[1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:38.760]  tea from dude if I saw somebody in a buffet do that I'd say what I mean I'm
[1:50:38.760 --> 1:50:42.500]  out of control for it but hey dude do you wash your hands when you wipe your
[1:50:42.500 --> 1:50:48.640]  ass what is your problem that gets worse the video goes on he's sticking his
[1:50:48.640 --> 1:51:01.800]  fingers back in the containers and the reason I play it is the creepiness of
[1:51:01.800 --> 1:51:09.880]  this dude is evident I mean who raised this person and again that leads
[1:51:09.880 --> 1:51:16.400]  credence that he might be a reptile for planet pop tart because everything he
[1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:19.640]  does like some of the space alien would do like a space alien acts like that this
[1:51:19.640 --> 1:51:22.640]  guy's worth seventy eight million dollars and he's like at a buffet sticking
[1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:28.280]  it but I'm gonna stop now I'm done I'm not playing that again at least for a
[1:51:28.280 --> 1:51:33.560]  while let's move on to another demon Chucky Schumer because all these guys
[1:51:33.560 --> 1:51:39.080]  don't act normal but Biden's come acting completely insane corn pop and vote
[1:51:39.080 --> 1:51:44.360]  Thursday on Super Thursday and I like fly legs and fly hair little black kids
[1:51:44.360 --> 1:51:48.960]  and roaches I mean you're like listen to this stuff and you're like is this
[1:51:48.960 --> 1:51:56.680]  really happening but Schumer gets up in a bonafide threat yesterday and says the
[1:51:56.680 --> 1:52:02.480]  Supreme Court to Gorsuch and to Cabinado they've already tried to destroy and
[1:52:02.480 --> 1:52:07.520]  says we're gonna get you you're gonna pay well you can't impeach them you
[1:52:07.520 --> 1:52:13.240]  they're appointed for life you can't so it's it's I mean folks I only exposed
[1:52:13.240 --> 1:52:21.480]  that the judge in the stone case judge the definition of a corrupt judge dirty
[1:52:21.480 --> 1:52:27.240]  judge Jackson up was appointing Democrat Party officials to head up the jury and
[1:52:27.240 --> 1:52:29.760]  she had to make one of them step down and now they caught the second when she
[1:52:29.760 --> 1:52:35.640]  put in me and just as bad he wants me arrested and it's been all over the news
[1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:40.840]  crooked judge covers for bias and lying juror and Roger Stone case appoints a
[1:52:40.840 --> 1:52:44.680]  lawyer no one's ever done that I checked into it to represent a juror the jury's
[1:52:44.680 --> 1:52:48.720]  over everybody railroaded stone but they don't want you know who they are or the
[1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:52.640]  notes they filed when they lied on the jury applications because you know it's
[1:52:52.640 --> 1:52:55.920]  just not the two that she first put in that are bad news man it's the whole
[1:52:55.920 --> 1:53:05.920]  dirty enchilada and she's fighting to suppress that and is days away from
[1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:11.080]  making stone report to jail so here's truckie Schumer they're all the news
[1:53:11.080 --> 1:53:14.520]  saying I'm threatening the judge I'm threatening jurors if I go bullhorn a
[1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:17.640]  courthouse and say you're corrupt and I believe you're bad that's not
[1:53:17.640 --> 1:53:23.200]  intimidating somebody but when you say I'm gonna get you you're gonna pay and
[1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:30.280]  you're the one of the top Democrat senators the Chief Justice put out a
[1:53:30.280 --> 1:53:34.080]  letter saying this is a real threat by somebody your level but we will not be
[1:53:34.080 --> 1:53:39.040]  intimidated that's how crazy the dialogue has gotten in this country
[1:53:39.040 --> 1:53:45.040]  ladies and gentlemen but see why did Chuckie Schumer get so upset he always
[1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:47.560]  acts like he's half dead but we talk about talking about killing millions of
[1:53:47.560 --> 1:53:52.240]  babies a year the demon and that man just gets all excited over that blood of
[1:53:52.240 --> 1:53:57.480]  those babies and he wants that goodie and his daddy Satan tells him you get up
[1:53:57.480 --> 1:54:02.840]  their demon and you threaten them I want more dead kids I want to dehumanize
[1:54:02.840 --> 1:54:08.000]  people I want no value on human life so you get up there you red pajama devil
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:19.280]  and you get me more babies or you and Governor Northam are gonna be exposed
[1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:25.680]  keep those babies culling and keep them comfortable here he is and they're
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:31.360]  taking away fundamental rights I want to tell you Gorsuch I want to tell you
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:41.760]  Cavanaugh you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price you
[1:54:41.760 --> 1:54:47.680]  won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions yeah
[1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:50.920]  just like you said the intelligence agencies have seven ways to Sunday to
[1:54:50.920 --> 1:54:55.320]  what get Trump and then they committed a bunch of crime to try to get him and
[1:54:55.320 --> 1:54:59.040]  he's still hadn't gotten trouble so he's so arrogant now hell probably the same
[1:54:59.040 --> 1:55:04.640]  Cavanaugh is a Russian agent Robert stood up to him he's probably a Russian
[1:55:04.640 --> 1:55:09.400]  agent now too huh everybody's a Russian agent but you dirty Democrats that

[1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:04.000]  can't compete with Owen so I just saw his duck's ass the other day here on air

[1:57:07.240 --> 1:57:12.640]  only way to counter Superman and Superman hair is Lex Luthor and so Owen
[1:57:12.640 --> 1:57:16.360]  showed up he said my hair is more powerful than yours and I said okay that's
[1:57:16.360 --> 1:57:27.640]  it Lex Luthor is coming now you little face. The truth is I just said I need to shave my
[1:57:27.640 --> 1:57:31.960]  head as a message to folks that things are different here and things are crazy

[1:58:31.040 --> 1:58:35.480]  element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a

[2:00:30.880 --> 2:00:32.380]  Yes, thank you
[2:00:32.380 --> 2:00:39.000]  Hey, Alex. It's my first time caller ever, you know, but what I want to get at is the chuckles
[2:00:39.360 --> 2:00:47.080]  the clowns sewer and Pelosi the bucket drunk and the bomb will hold over that brought sick sick people back
[2:00:47.080 --> 2:00:50.840]  Absolutely. They're the herpes of Obama. They just keep giving and giving
[2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:53.240]  Yeah, see what gets me is
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:57.880]  They don't give a damn about the American people. They don't they don't
[2:00:58.360 --> 2:01:03.160]  Well, in fact, they don't they don't just dislike America. They hate us because we won't submit to them
[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:05.560]  We'll see another thing too is down
[2:01:06.120 --> 2:01:07.640]  my uncle
[2:01:07.640 --> 2:01:11.800]  all my uncles and my dad and everybody fought in World War two and
[2:01:11.800 --> 2:01:16.840]  And my uncle Jim always said now this is way back in
[2:01:17.800 --> 2:01:19.800]  71-72 ish, you know
[2:01:20.360 --> 2:01:25.480]  That he said that Russia would take over America without firing a bullet
[2:01:26.760 --> 2:01:31.200]  I mean, I mean and so far he's been right on everything
[2:01:31.200 --> 2:01:36.040]  Well, let's be clear, you know the globalist left us had taken over Russia in 1917
[2:01:36.040 --> 2:01:39.440]  So the same globalist group was absolutely using Russia to attack us
[2:01:39.440 --> 2:01:43.120]  But I wouldn't even say it was the Russians. It was that communist globalist group. Oh
[2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:46.320]  Yeah, I'll tell you what
[2:01:47.840 --> 2:01:55.160]  Yeah, and I'll be I'm gonna tell them myself now back in the day I used to vote Democrat used to that was back
[2:01:55.760 --> 2:01:57.440]  during
[2:01:57.440 --> 2:02:02.920]  Clinton's first term and after that, but see don't tell on yourself people didn't know how bad Democrats were back then
[2:02:03.360 --> 2:02:08.000]  Republican for blue bloods and bad then too. I mean, it's just now we have trumped a little more populist
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:14.640]  There's a better choice. But I mean, yeah, exactly. I don't blame anybody who voted Democrat before it as long as people now see what's happening
[2:02:15.280 --> 2:02:17.360]  Yes, see what gets me is why
[2:02:18.240 --> 2:02:26.560]  We'll see I blame it basically on our academia. You think about it right now our academics only teach the liberal
[2:02:27.680 --> 2:02:34.480]  Communist ideology and not academics and you know, I mean, they've done they've done already got past the
[2:02:34.480 --> 2:02:39.040]  Academy for it. Yeah, they teach a neoliberal system to sabotage
[2:02:39.840 --> 2:02:46.960]  Real nationalism real liberalism real conservatism anything authentic. God bless you. Thanks for the call rick in colorado. You're on the air. Welcome, sir
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:50.880]  Thanks for taking my call alex. Thank you, sir
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:54.480]  Hey, first off, I wanted to say that I've bought storeable food
[2:02:54.560 --> 2:02:59.440]  I've bought a lot of products, but the best thing I have ever bought from you was the election pure water system
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:06.240]  I've got one for my daughter with my grandkids and that thing is the best thing. It's better than any bottled water or anything you can get
[2:03:07.360 --> 2:03:10.800]  Well, it's top rated by third-party groups people go. Why is yours the best?
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:14.640]  Because it's really low price in the best. Why the hell wouldn't I sell some wow?
[2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:19.760]  People ask why does jones always sell the best products because that's what I use whatever we go out and thinks the best
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.640]  I strike a deal with them and that's what I sell. It's not rocket science
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:25.040]  Yeah, I agree
[2:03:25.040 --> 2:03:32.080]  The thing I wanted to say was I haven't heard anybody even comment on what's going to happen to the prison systems if this corona
[2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:34.480]  Breaks out in the prison
[2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:40.560]  Wow, I didn't think of that. Well, that's dr. Francis ball about that. Yeah, what happens with mosquitoes and ticks go ahead
[2:03:41.440 --> 2:03:44.800]  Prison here in color map colorado and you know a lot of big
[2:03:45.840 --> 2:03:49.520]  Big-time convicts are in there and you know the guards get sick
[2:03:49.520 --> 2:03:55.840]  Who's going to replace the guards and what happens in the prison systems because it'll fly around like a petri dish and then you just said it
[2:03:56.080 --> 2:04:00.720]  Boy, there's footage. I haven't aired yet of a homeless person eating poop that drudgereport.com linked to and I
[2:04:01.120 --> 2:04:03.120]  I meant to start the show with it, but I just
[2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:07.600]  Viewer discretion is advised, but we're talking about a petri dish. We're gonna we're gonna get to that
[2:04:07.600 --> 2:04:11.120]  We come back the dr. Francis boil here and we'll get to robert and Nathaniel and dan
[2:04:11.920 --> 2:04:13.920]  Rick, what are you and your family doing to get prepared?
[2:04:13.920 --> 2:04:21.520]  Well, I've always been a prepper, but you know, I got my daughters on board and all that and I mean we don't go crazy and go insane
[2:04:21.520 --> 2:04:27.680]  But you know, I have all the essentials and everything I need to take care of me and my family and that's all I care about
[2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:30.400]  Well, you know the most important things in relationship with God and
[2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:38.000]  Guns and being willing to use it. Thank you so much. We love you. It comes down to God guts and family ladies and gentlemen
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:41.840]  God guts and family. You got that. You got everything
[2:04:41.840 --> 2:04:48.240]  Well, they're right back on a frances boil and breaking news. Stay with us info wars.com tomorrow's news today
[2:04:52.240 --> 2:04:58.320]  Rich in alabama rich. Thanks for calling. Hey, mr. Jones appreciate it first thing. I love the turbo force
[2:04:58.320 --> 2:05:04.720]  I drive truck for a living and it's amazing coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end
[2:05:04.720 --> 2:05:09.760]  But that purple force is amazing. How is turbo force different than coffee? I didn't know
[2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:14.960]  I'll tell you what it's sustainable. Anywhere from
[2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:22.000]  18 hours, I don't feel the jitters like I do drink and coffee and it's just, you know, at the end of the day
[2:05:22.080 --> 2:05:27.440]  I don't need anything to go to bed. I'll you know, knock out them. I'm out cold
[2:05:27.840 --> 2:05:30.960]  Well, that's what we went out to a top developer who did want his name on it
[2:05:30.960 --> 2:05:35.840]  And I said, what would the ultimate long say 10 hour energy be is that possible?
[2:05:35.840 --> 2:05:41.840]  That's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and natural that are time released
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:45.280]  And there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product
[2:05:45.360 --> 2:05:51.440]  So that's why turbo force has such a great effect. And so I really appreciate you and I'm glad that you like turbo force
[2:05:51.440 --> 2:05:53.440]  I
[2:06:05.120 --> 2:06:07.120]  Am a shotgun rider
[2:06:07.120 --> 2:06:11.280]  For the sands you sent to line the desert is my brother
[2:06:11.840 --> 2:06:16.240]  My skin is cracked and dry. I was riding on a folk coast
[2:06:16.240 --> 2:06:22.000]  And everything was fine till we took a shorter road to save some time
[2:06:23.760 --> 2:06:27.680]  The bandits only fired once they shot me in the chest
[2:06:28.880 --> 2:06:33.520]  They may have wounded me, but they'll never get the best of better men
[2:06:34.320 --> 2:06:37.200]  All right, we're gonna go to dr. Francis Boyle here in just a moment who
[2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:44.480]  There's only two people out there that have done more in the last five weeks exposing this accurately and that's that's
[2:06:44.480 --> 2:06:52.320]  Dr. Francis Boyle and Mike Adams. I mean, they're just right at the tip of the spear the indian institute that came out and scanned it and said it was man made with the gene
[2:06:52.880 --> 2:06:58.160]  Uh, and and the the the RNA of the delivery system of hiv that's been confirmed now
[2:06:58.880 --> 2:07:02.880]  And uh, what's the big new developments here? This is just unbelievable
[2:07:03.920 --> 2:07:08.000]  What's unfolding? We're gonna hit all of that in a moment, but I said he'll be with us about 45 minutes
[2:07:08.080 --> 2:07:10.080]  Then I promised you I'd get to your calls
[2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:13.840]  And I'm gonna take a little bit of the time from Matt Bracken. He's cool with that at the next hour
[2:07:13.840 --> 2:07:15.840]  But we've got Francis Boyle here with us
[2:07:15.840 --> 2:07:18.320]  Uh, we're gonna get him on the line. We're they're getting him on right now
[2:07:18.320 --> 2:07:19.280]  We're going to him in a moment
[2:07:19.280 --> 2:07:25.120]  But robert in florida works at Tampa international airport where you know two women now we learned a third man came in with it
[2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:28.640]  What's the latest from from florida?
[2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:32.240]  Yes, sir
[2:07:32.240 --> 2:07:34.240]  Yeah, I work at the airport
[2:07:34.720 --> 2:07:38.480]  We haven't had any kind of work because normally we'll get work from security and whatnot
[2:07:38.480 --> 2:07:43.280]  I haven't even heard anything from staff because we work in the food industry me and my wife
[2:07:43.280 --> 2:07:46.560]  We both work here actually and we both work on their side
[2:07:47.200 --> 2:07:50.560]  And normally any time a thing happens we get first work
[2:07:51.200 --> 2:07:54.080]  Right directly from security. We haven't gotten anything yet
[2:07:54.800 --> 2:07:58.160]  As I was going to state about the lady that called earlier Barbara
[2:07:58.560 --> 2:07:59.840]  Um
[2:07:59.840 --> 2:08:04.880]  About being careful with like you talk about sometimes with these false flag uh news reports that they have
[2:08:04.880 --> 2:08:09.280]  You know, we have not had no word on any of that stuff in our airport yet
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:10.800]  and
[2:08:10.800 --> 2:08:11.600]  like
[2:08:11.600 --> 2:08:12.960]  Two nights ago
[2:08:12.960 --> 2:08:18.960]  Call a news thing from abc action news over here in hilsboro county. They're in front of a dollar tree
[2:08:19.520 --> 2:08:23.920]  Talking about uh, you know, there's no supplies anything. Everything's sold out signs are on the windows
[2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:28.640]  I was there today. Everything's in stock. There's nothing wrong at all
[2:08:29.120 --> 2:08:31.680]  Like there's nothing in the stores that are out of stock
[2:08:31.680 --> 2:08:38.240]  Uh, you know more so on the news and they're doing a bunch of fear mongering because you really don't hear anything about that over here
[2:08:38.480 --> 2:08:40.480]  Now, however, there is a case though and uh
[2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:44.560]  Hillsborough county where I'm at but this is all the way in around mango county
[2:08:45.280 --> 2:08:48.160]  And uh, where my mother stays in cerisota. There's one case
[2:08:48.880 --> 2:08:53.440]  But so far as far as the airport goes we haven't had any kind of communication with security
[2:08:54.080 --> 2:08:56.480]  Homeland security tsa anything like that
[2:08:56.480 --> 2:09:00.800]  Well, thank you so much robert. I appreciate your call and and obviously I've seen hundreds of videos so of you of
[2:09:01.520 --> 2:09:08.080]  Grocery stores and costco's and big lines of people outside. Those are real a lot of the footage though looks like employees
[2:09:08.080 --> 2:09:12.080]  Because they all are kind of being directed, but they're in plain clothes throwing
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:19.840]  Uh cards full of things and that was an old trick long that 50 years ago is a toy maker about two months before christmas
[2:09:19.840 --> 2:09:26.160]  Would pay off a local newscaster to go and say this doll or this toy is sold out here
[2:09:26.160 --> 2:09:31.280]  There's runs on cabbage patch dolls and then it would cause a run nationwide sold out sold out
[2:09:32.400 --> 2:09:34.400]  And so yeah, uh
[2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:39.360]  A lot of this looks fake. In fact, if you look that's a bunch of costco workers doing it
[2:09:39.360 --> 2:09:41.360]  Costco welcome to costco. I love you
[2:09:41.920 --> 2:09:45.920]  And as they say in a diagracy. So yeah, in fact, the crew is so good. I didn't even tell them to do that
[2:09:45.920 --> 2:09:49.920]  They they I never even told them. I thought that was fake. They knew out of like probably
[2:09:50.400 --> 2:09:55.440]  50 videos they've got of that. They pulled out the one that this that looks fake. The others are look real
[2:09:55.920 --> 2:09:57.920]  That's like humid man. They didn't even need to know
[2:09:58.640 --> 2:10:02.800]  Which one I was talking about. They just boom went to it. So yeah, that that's fake right there folks
[2:10:03.520 --> 2:10:06.640]  Uh, the issue here though is let's go back to the camera here
[2:10:09.760 --> 2:10:12.480]  The huge response by the chinese communist
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:17.920]  Over a hundred dead in idly the lockdown of all their schools it crippling air travel it crippling
[2:10:18.800 --> 2:10:24.240]  Uh, the supply chain, that's real whether it's an over-responsive or not. It's real and then we know it's man-made
[2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:29.520]  We know that genetic engineers look at it and clearly they can see where it was inserted. It was built different families of viruses
[2:10:29.840 --> 2:10:33.440]  This is ridiculously phony like plastic banana or
[2:10:34.480 --> 2:10:36.720]  A three dollar bill. So dr. Francis Boyle
[2:10:37.520 --> 2:10:39.520]  is a phd lawyer
[2:10:39.520 --> 2:10:41.760]  Teacher's major college at harvard top
[2:10:42.400 --> 2:10:46.880]  Uh, you know phd. I'm not going to go in his little background author of the u.s. Law and Bioweapons that got adopted by the un
[2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:49.440]  And he's been for five weeks here
[2:10:50.160 --> 2:10:56.720]  Charting what's happening. He's been dead on so the best thing to do is just turn over the next five minutes and we'll come back with a 10-minute segment
[2:10:57.120 --> 2:10:59.120]  To dr. Francis Boyle
[2:10:59.120 --> 2:11:04.400]  Uh, who took off teaching. We appreciate him to be here and lay out the newest developments, but but but can you just recap?
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:09.600]  You're the latest approximation of exactly what this is where it came from and what we're facing
[2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:17.280]  Well, okay, uh, Alex. Thank you for having me on obviously we've done several
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:21.040]  interviews here before I can't recap all of that
[2:11:21.840 --> 2:11:23.840]  But I did want to make some
[2:11:24.400 --> 2:11:26.400]  current observations for your
[2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:30.960]  listeners your viewers to decide for themselves
[2:11:30.960 --> 2:11:34.240]  listeners your viewers to decide for themselves
[2:11:35.040 --> 2:11:38.720]  as you know, uh last week president trump had a
[2:11:39.680 --> 2:11:41.200]  press conference
[2:11:41.200 --> 2:11:43.200]  where he brought in his uh team
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  dealing with this
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:47.040]  and
[2:11:47.040 --> 2:11:49.040]  When it was all over
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  They proceeded to march out
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:11:54.720]  stage left
[2:11:54.720 --> 2:11:56.720]  Sorry their stage right
[2:11:56.960 --> 2:11:58.960]  and as they were
[2:11:59.040 --> 2:12:00.720]  going out
[2:12:00.720 --> 2:12:01.600]  the
[2:12:01.600 --> 2:12:03.600]  uh director of the cdc
[2:12:04.320 --> 2:12:06.320]  redfield stopped
[2:12:06.640 --> 2:12:09.760]  turned and looked at the american people
[2:12:10.640 --> 2:12:12.240]  smirked
[2:12:12.240 --> 2:12:17.040]  And then said it's perfectly safe for everyone to fly to washington
[2:12:17.760 --> 2:12:19.360]  uh, oregon
[2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:21.360]  and california
[2:12:21.440 --> 2:12:23.440]  about two hours later
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:29.120]  uh, the state of washington declared a coronavirus
[2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:30.720]  emergency
[2:12:30.720 --> 2:12:35.680]  So they knew that was coming and tried to block it or tried to like overshadow it
[2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:43.360]  Well, Alex you can interpret that however you want but well you're a smart guy. How do you interpret it?
[2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:48.160]  I think he's an idiot between you and me first and second
[2:12:48.560 --> 2:12:51.840]  I think this criminal malpractice by the cdc
[2:12:51.840 --> 2:12:59.680]  Which is typical because we have to understand the cdc has been up to its eyeballs
[2:13:00.240 --> 2:13:03.040]  In this nazi biological warfare work
[2:13:03.600 --> 2:13:05.600]  Since the reagan administration
[2:13:06.480 --> 2:13:08.560]  Under the influence i'm sorry to direct you here
[2:13:08.560 --> 2:13:12.000]  But let let's recap with what you broke that was hiding in plain view three weeks ago here
[2:13:12.480 --> 2:13:19.440]  Science journal others reported five years ago the us allowed the transfer of this very virus a camira of the type to china
[2:13:19.440 --> 2:13:24.000]  So to me that's kind of epicenter of investigation. Or am I wrong like we should look at that
[2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:27.200]  You're perfectly correct. Alex that
[2:13:28.320 --> 2:13:31.920]  University of north carolina lab should be shut down
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:34.560]  immediately by state local
[2:13:35.200 --> 2:13:37.200]  law enforcement authorities
[2:13:37.920 --> 2:13:39.920]  It should be sealed
[2:13:40.160 --> 2:13:42.160]  to preserve the evidence
[2:13:42.160 --> 2:13:44.240]  and everyone involved in this
[2:13:44.240 --> 2:13:48.240]  uh uh uh coronavirus gain of function
[2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:50.640]  of uh
[2:13:50.640 --> 2:13:52.640]  nazi biological warfare activity
[2:13:53.360 --> 2:13:55.520]  uh should be
[2:13:55.520 --> 2:13:58.320]  investigated by law enforcement authorities
[2:13:58.880 --> 2:14:00.480]  and interrogated
[2:14:00.480 --> 2:14:02.880]  and I think prosecuted for violating my
[2:14:03.680 --> 2:14:07.840]  biological weapons anti-terrorism act uh of 1989
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:10.400]  that provides for
[2:14:10.400 --> 2:14:17.920]  Life imprisonment, but the point of my story is alex. We cannot trust the cdc
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:20.720]  To do the right thing here
[2:14:21.200 --> 2:14:24.080]  For you know that it's not to your horn, but this shows your knowledge
[2:14:24.640 --> 2:14:29.200]  How did you know a month ago? They were covering it up because that's now admitted that that they've been covering up and not letting people
[2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:31.200]  Get tested and all of this
[2:14:32.880 --> 2:14:37.520]  Well, actually it just goes back to my uh, uh involvement in
[2:14:37.520 --> 2:14:41.680]  uh trying to stop dna genetically engineering
[2:14:42.320 --> 2:14:44.320]  uh biological warfare
[2:14:44.480 --> 2:14:46.480]  by the united states government
[2:14:46.800 --> 2:14:49.680]  uh starting since since shortly after the
[2:14:50.400 --> 2:14:53.680]  council for responsible genetics asked me to serve as their
[2:14:54.560 --> 2:15:00.560]  Lawyer and do this work for them and crg has uh some of the top life scientists from
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:04.880]  Harvard and mit all my buddies there at harvard know
[2:15:04.880 --> 2:15:10.800]  Uh, who I am. So I've been following it. I guess well, you know professionally
[2:15:11.680 --> 2:15:13.680]  You've not been following it. You've been right at the center of it
[2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:18.160]  That's correct. I you know, I'm not here to toot my horn one way
[2:15:18.160 --> 2:15:21.840]  No, but we need to say that we need to say somebody's expertise when they're on I mean
[2:15:22.320 --> 2:15:26.400]  I mean somebody's an expert in a certain type of brain surgery or somebody invented something you have them on say

[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:31.120]  When we come back

[2:18:53.680 --> 2:18:59.680]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and
[2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:03.520]  I told alex. I said man. This is the best toothpaste. I've ever tried. He's like, well
[2:19:04.080 --> 2:19:08.960]  What are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell people and so here I am telling people
[2:19:08.960 --> 2:19:13.440]  Super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste
[2:19:13.520 --> 2:19:19.120]  I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free
[2:19:19.680 --> 2:19:25.040]  I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this
[2:19:25.360 --> 2:19:31.040]  They feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth at this
[2:19:31.280 --> 2:19:34.320]  It feels so good. It feels like it feels like
[2:19:34.320 --> 2:19:39.120]  Good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth
[2:19:39.840 --> 2:19:44.720]  Three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels
[2:19:44.720 --> 2:19:59.360]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:14.720 --> 2:20:16.720]  Oh
[2:20:16.720 --> 2:20:28.720]  Oh
[2:20:46.720 --> 2:20:53.200]  All right, dr. Francis Boyle author of the us biological weapons law was adopted by the united nations
[2:20:54.640 --> 2:20:58.640]  I'll stop asking questions for now and do doing recaps the current developments
[2:20:58.800 --> 2:21:01.280]  What you think is really happening now in the latest info you have
[2:21:03.120 --> 2:21:07.680]  Well again alex, let me just go back to uh president of trump's press conference
[2:21:08.240 --> 2:21:13.280]  And since then, uh, we've been inundated by all these com. I've already
[2:21:13.280 --> 2:21:18.880]  Dismissed the cdc and and redfield. They're they're completely
[2:21:19.840 --> 2:21:21.840]  Fatally compromised to give
[2:21:22.400 --> 2:21:28.080]  Any reputable advice to the american people. We've also been inundated by
[2:21:29.520 --> 2:21:31.040]  interviews with
[2:21:31.040 --> 2:21:32.480]  Tony Fauci
[2:21:32.480 --> 2:21:36.800]  Well on that university of north carolina smoking gun
[2:21:36.800 --> 2:21:44.000]  I already provided to you where it is clear the chinese government paid
[2:21:44.560 --> 2:21:51.280]  For access to the nazi biological warfare work at the university of north carolina
[2:21:51.680 --> 2:21:56.400]  And took it back to them. It clearly says quote research in this manuscript
[2:21:56.800 --> 2:22:02.160]  Was supported by grants from the national institute of allergy and infected diseases
[2:22:02.160 --> 2:22:08.880]  It's unquote whose director is Tony Fauci. So Fauci is up to his eyeballs in this
[2:22:09.360 --> 2:22:12.080]  He's lying about it. He's covering it up
[2:22:12.800 --> 2:22:15.920]  He's doing damage control and damage limitations
[2:22:16.480 --> 2:22:21.280]  We cannot believe one word. He's saying by the way, let me just stop you. I said I wouldn't interrupt but i'm going to
[2:22:21.600 --> 2:22:23.600]  You started saying this three weeks ago
[2:22:24.000 --> 2:22:26.560]  So i went and looked into who fouts. He is he's been there
[2:22:26.560 --> 2:22:32.000]  For 40 years involved in all this secret of operations. So I didn't realize
[2:22:32.880 --> 2:22:39.760]  Just how prestigious he is in all this illegal operations. I mean he has run basically biological weapons operations. Am I wrong?
[2:22:41.520 --> 2:22:46.720]  You're correct for uh, uh, niate and the national institutes of health and likewise
[2:22:47.280 --> 2:22:51.200]  We really can't trust these people at the national institutes from health
[2:22:51.760 --> 2:22:53.760]  this u n c
[2:22:53.760 --> 2:22:57.520]  Wuhan virology lab, uh, also says
[2:22:58.160 --> 2:22:59.920]  uh, uh
[2:22:59.920 --> 2:23:02.640]  Supported by grants from the national institutes of health
[2:23:03.360 --> 2:23:08.000]  As long as along with the uh, uh, national science foundation of china
[2:23:08.560 --> 2:23:14.080]  So they're up to their eyeballs in this too. Let me also comment on on the surgeon general
[2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:21.920]  Uh, uh, the surgeon general, uh wrote an op-ed piece saying well, uh, the american people don't need face masks
[2:23:21.920 --> 2:23:29.920]  That's just preposterous. There's a brand new article just came out from, uh, china today, uh, china
[2:23:30.960 --> 2:23:32.640]  scientists
[2:23:32.640 --> 2:23:34.640]  saying quote
[2:23:36.640 --> 2:23:38.640]  If the neuro invasion of SARS
[2:23:39.520 --> 2:23:44.560]  Cov2 does take a part in the development of respiratory failure
[2:23:45.120 --> 2:23:48.160]  In covet 19 patients, which they establish
[2:23:48.160 --> 2:23:51.280]  The precaution with masks
[2:23:52.000 --> 2:23:59.520]  Will absolutely be the most effective measure to protect against the possible entry of the virus
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:02.000]  into the central nervous system
[2:24:03.120 --> 2:24:08.800]  So obviously he's not telling the truth to us either and by the way, I got to stop you again
[2:24:08.800 --> 2:24:14.640]  This is like somebody at the nd 500 saying cars don't need tires. I'm not a scientist or a top bioweapons lawyer
[2:24:14.640 --> 2:24:19.680]  Like you but I've studied the virus. I know it's very small. It goes down deep into the lungs
[2:24:20.160 --> 2:24:23.920]  And that obviously it's very small technically can go through a mask
[2:24:24.160 --> 2:24:29.520]  But it's going to be carried in some water vapor. It's going to be carried in some spindle or a sneeze
[2:24:30.080 --> 2:24:33.040]  A lot of it will get caught and blocked in the nose, but not in the throat
[2:24:33.120 --> 2:24:37.600]  It'll go down the windpipe into the lungs and so of course a high-end mask
[2:24:38.080 --> 2:24:42.400]  It's like we sell water filters. They cut back 9 9 9 9 9 9 percent depending on the thing
[2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:48.720]  It's better to cut down the 9 9 9 9 9 9 9. The idea of well, they could technically the virus is so small
[2:24:49.360 --> 2:24:52.080]  It could go through. Is it that a red herring canard doctor?
[2:24:53.680 --> 2:24:58.560]  Well, the chinese scientists who over there dealing with it say you have to have masks
[2:24:58.960 --> 2:25:04.480]  Uh, uh, what else can I say? Uh, there's why the hell would trumps people be saying no masks?
[2:25:06.800 --> 2:25:10.640]  Well, alex, uh, uh, I just think we're getting
[2:25:10.640 --> 2:25:15.520]  Criminal malpractice by the trump advisers, but that's all I can say
[2:25:16.240 --> 2:25:19.360]  Um, and in the case certainly in the case of, uh
[2:25:20.080 --> 2:25:23.360]  Fauci and the cbc and the nih
[2:25:23.760 --> 2:25:27.360]  This is all covering your rear end
[2:25:27.840 --> 2:25:29.760]  And by the way, you're being politically, uh
[2:25:30.240 --> 2:25:36.640]  Agnostic here, right? You're not against her for you're just reporting what you see here that this is really a danger to america and trump
[2:25:36.640 --> 2:25:41.840]  That that he's letting all these insiders like he did with the neocons running russia gate
[2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:46.400]  Like he did with fiona hill and all these people we warned him then then didn't we?
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:53.120]  Well, you're correct. I was i'm a political independent to be honest with you. I didn't vote for mrs. Clinton
[2:25:53.200 --> 2:25:58.560]  I didn't vote for mr. Trump. I'm usually pick a third party. So I i'm not here
[2:25:59.280 --> 2:26:04.800]  Uh, uh to beat up on trump president trump. You're telling it like it is because some callers a couple are like, hey
[2:26:04.800 --> 2:26:08.560]  Why are you bashing trump? I'm not I'm just talking reality here. That's all we do
[2:26:09.600 --> 2:26:18.400]  Right and then finally, uh, alex. Uh, we have uh the health of human services secretary azar that I told you before we agree
[2:26:19.120 --> 2:26:23.840]  He's a uh, uh an employee and lobbyist for the drug industry
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:26.240]  So in this latest bill
[2:26:27.040 --> 2:26:29.040]  That was just passed by congress
[2:26:29.840 --> 2:26:33.440]  He made sure you can read this in today's new york times
[2:26:33.440 --> 2:26:37.440]  That there will be no bulk sales
[2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:39.840]  free of charge
[2:26:39.840 --> 2:26:41.840]  To any uh anti-covid
[2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:46.240]  Therapeutics or cures or anything else to the american people
[2:26:46.800 --> 2:26:50.000]  We are going to have to pay the drug companies whatever
[2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:54.560]  Outrageous extorbent rates. They charge us. Let's pull back from that
[2:26:55.040 --> 2:27:00.640]  They're saying there's not going to be any government backing when then you when you want welfare. This is when you do it during a pandemic
[2:27:00.640 --> 2:27:02.640]  No welfare
[2:27:03.200 --> 2:27:05.440]  No, no, no helping the public during an emergency
[2:27:06.720 --> 2:27:11.040]  It's not going to be provided free of charge. That's correct. You'll have to rely upon your
[2:27:11.600 --> 2:27:15.840]  insurance company if you have one and if you don't then too bad for you
[2:27:16.400 --> 2:27:18.640]  likewise, we see these uh
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:21.520]  enormous restrictions
[2:27:21.840 --> 2:27:26.560]  That the cdc has placed on coronavirus testing
[2:27:26.560 --> 2:27:33.280]  That, you know, technically they say they've just removed. Well, they're they're doing 10 000 tests a day
[2:27:33.920 --> 2:27:41.680]  In south korea and so far we've had 500 tests in america. Why again? I think this damage control
[2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:43.360]  damage
[2:27:43.360 --> 2:27:50.480]  Libertation uh covering their own rear ends and uh, uh, not being honest with the american people
[2:27:50.480 --> 2:27:56.400]  Well professor, I think you're dead on and you're a top expert on this and I get why trump wants to play it down
[2:27:56.400 --> 2:28:00.800]  He wants to save the stock market, but like china did the covering up of it up front
[2:28:00.880 --> 2:28:04.720]  I think creates more insecurity when it becomes apparent that it's deadly
[2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:09.200]  You're right. Alex. I you know, obviously
[2:28:09.920 --> 2:28:14.720]  We're not as bad as uh, communist china when it comes to uh propaganda
[2:28:15.280 --> 2:28:18.560]  But uh, I hate to say it our mainstream news media
[2:28:18.560 --> 2:28:26.720]  Is not much better, which is why I come here and uh, uh, give you my interviews because at least you let me say what I want
[2:28:26.800 --> 2:28:31.920]  You asked me some questions. You challenge, uh, you challenge me. Well, that's fine
[2:28:32.000 --> 2:28:38.160]  Uh, I always get a fair and honest interview with you where I've been completely blackballed off of uh
[2:28:38.640 --> 2:28:43.120]  Mainstream news news media ever. Well, that shows you're doing the right thing. Stay there. I've got a few
[2:28:43.840 --> 2:28:47.280]  Selfish questions. I know you're trying to tell me well how to protect themselves with the white house you did
[2:28:47.280 --> 2:28:51.440]  But I want to know like a provenance where it came from. You've been spot on about that. We'll be right back
[2:28:53.360 --> 2:28:56.000]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[2:30:01.040 --> 2:30:05.840]  People be prepared and instead of just giving in to sickness care take care of their health

[2:30:20.160 --> 2:30:24.320]  Well, I wouldn't be so energetic this morning except that I have been on a
[2:30:24.800 --> 2:30:29.920]  Regular customer in that regard. I just wanted to start out by saying that because I think it's important to remember
[2:30:30.240 --> 2:30:35.600]  Beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think about these great events in the world
[2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:39.680]  One of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself
[2:30:39.840 --> 2:30:46.240]  Remembering that our lives are a gift from god that he intends us to use for good purpose
[2:30:46.480 --> 2:30:53.840]  For our families and for our communities and right now folks who are willing to think like we do are critical to the future of america
[2:30:54.960 --> 2:30:56.960]  We know that the globalists are in trouble
[2:30:57.440 --> 2:31:04.000]  Humanities waking up to their tyranny how they run their scams their Ponzi schemes how they're building a post human world
[2:31:04.000 --> 2:31:08.480]  But we know they're going to strike back and the UN has said that they're going to
[2:31:09.200 --> 2:31:17.920]  Absolutely implode third-world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the west and collapse
[2:31:18.240 --> 2:31:21.600]  Our social services the giant clowered and pivot program
[2:31:21.920 --> 2:31:28.080]  The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government inner
[2:31:28.800 --> 2:31:29.840]  coronavirus
[2:31:29.840 --> 2:31:35.440]  This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading
[2:31:35.760 --> 2:31:38.640]  The word because people are waking up like never before
[2:31:38.960 --> 2:31:46.800]  But this fight against tyranny is neck and neck so spread the word about band dot video and in full wars dot com ford slash show
[2:31:47.120 --> 2:31:53.120]  That is so important. You are at the center of the resistance. You are our only hope
[2:31:53.920 --> 2:31:58.880]  Everybody's calling me. I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family
[2:31:58.880 --> 2:32:05.040]  Visiting the house saying is coronavirus really deadly? How bad is it really? So I would encourage listeners. Yes
[2:32:05.040 --> 2:32:09.280]  Go get high-quality swirled foods. We have the only company the biggest in the nation that actually still has food

[2:34:00.800 --> 2:34:05.520]  Okay, dr. Boyle author of the u.s. Biological Weapons law that then got adopted by the u.n
[2:34:06.720 --> 2:34:11.040]  I can see what a great professor you are and and how you're a professional like my dad. That's a doctor
[2:34:11.040 --> 2:34:14.880]  Uh medical you know he you just try to lay out the current crisis
[2:34:15.680 --> 2:34:18.800]  And the fact that stuff's not being done right and you're just saying this is wrong
[2:34:19.200 --> 2:34:21.680]  But everybody wants to know the providence
[2:34:22.400 --> 2:34:27.600]  And the media is ignoring the journal of science five years ago saying obama sold to china
[2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:30.480]  They're ignoring the end of the institute saying it's man-made, but
[2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:33.840]  If we can force that out
[2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:37.280]  Because you're an expert in law and all this stuff. I'm an expert on how to get stuff out
[2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:44.160]  I if we can get its providence out who's its daddy and what its in game is was it an accident?
[2:34:44.320 --> 2:34:46.000]  Was it on purpose?
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:52.480]  What does what does the evidence point towards right now people want to know where this this creature came from?
[2:34:54.800 --> 2:34:58.960]  Well, alex as you know, I uh, I gave that interview to mr.
[2:34:59.360 --> 2:35:01.360]  shroyer and then
[2:35:01.520 --> 2:35:03.520]  For a half hour and then two more
[2:35:03.520 --> 2:35:06.960]  Uh interviews for an hour long and more with you. So I can't
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:11.520]  Uh recapitulate all that here, but I know I know you can't go over all the evidence
[2:35:11.600 --> 2:35:15.360]  I'm just saying like now new developments have happened. You were like did it accidentally get out
[2:35:15.520 --> 2:35:18.960]  Did it get out on purpose? We don't know but it's man-made. What are you? What are you thinking now?
[2:35:20.240 --> 2:35:24.720]  Right and this is an evolving situation. I do uh change my opinion
[2:35:25.200 --> 2:35:31.040]  Uh as time goes on but yes, I do think this was an offensive biological
[2:35:31.040 --> 2:35:32.640]  warfare
[2:35:32.640 --> 2:35:34.080]  uh weapon
[2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:39.040]  That was originally developed there at the university of north carolina lab
[2:35:39.760 --> 2:35:41.760]  uh using the um
[2:35:42.720 --> 2:35:46.800]  SARS coronavirus which was already weaponized to begin with
[2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:50.640]  And in dowing it with gain of function
[2:35:51.440 --> 2:35:55.120]  Properties indeed it even travels through air
[2:35:55.760 --> 2:35:58.080]  alex. It's not just a question of
[2:35:58.080 --> 2:36:00.640]  Uh droplets. That's why uh
[2:36:01.760 --> 2:36:03.760]  Uh human excrement
[2:36:04.320 --> 2:36:12.160]  Uh can spread this uh disease. We've had reports of that coming out of uh, hong kong and china now
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:18.480]  that uh when people poop in the toilet and flush flush the chain and if the
[2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:25.440]  Lines are not secure on the way down. It can spread spread this uh
[2:36:25.440 --> 2:36:30.400]  Uh disease and that u.n.c. Uh, uh, it's clear
[2:36:31.520 --> 2:36:37.920]  China bought bought its way into that uh, Nazi biological warfare work
[2:36:38.560 --> 2:36:40.560]  and took that uh, uh,
[2:36:40.560 --> 2:36:43.440]  Nazi biological warfare technology back with it
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:46.000]  Uh to wuhan
[2:36:46.240 --> 2:36:52.000]  In order to weaponize it and I believe that that's what happened here so far
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:37:00.560]  I I believe it was a leak that these bsl4 bsl3 facilities leak even for detrick, which is a bsl4
[2:37:01.040 --> 2:37:03.040]  Had a leak and uh had to shut down
[2:37:03.600 --> 2:37:07.040]  Uh over regardless that's why they're so scared. It's a known bio weapon
[2:37:07.200 --> 2:37:12.880]  Did you see where merkle tried to shake hands with her interior minister? He wouldn't I think what you're saying is it's not about shaking hands
[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:14.880]  It's in the air
[2:37:14.880 --> 2:37:19.040]  That's correct. It's not just in the hands, but it's in the air. You're exactly correct
[2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:25.760]  And so that is why it is uh, so uh infectious indeed. There's another report
[2:37:26.400 --> 2:37:28.400]  just came out uh today from
[2:37:29.280 --> 2:37:33.920]  Los Alamos that uh one carrier can infect anywhere from five to seven
[2:37:34.800 --> 2:37:36.960]  Other people so you don't even have to uh
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:43.920]  Shake someone's hands or be hit with a droplet. But Alex, let me say what I think
[2:37:43.920 --> 2:37:50.480]  we could do today, which is that uh, I don't believe we can trust
[2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:52.880]  this uh
[2:37:52.880 --> 2:37:59.280]  Team there in washington dc this team of feds who are up to their eyeballs in this
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:05.920]  To properly advise the american people on how to protect themselves and their families
[2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:08.560]  uh from this I I would
[2:38:08.560 --> 2:38:15.200]  suggest that what needs to be done is the american people have to get organized
[2:38:15.840 --> 2:38:23.760]  on a state and local basis even going down to to cities and communities and villages and whatever
[2:38:24.480 --> 2:38:29.120]  and put together a team of experts uh medical doctor
[2:38:30.160 --> 2:38:33.840]  microbiologists uh public health uh official
[2:38:33.840 --> 2:38:42.800]  and be sure to do your due diligence on them and make sure that they have not accepted one penny
[2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:46.080]  of nazi biological warfare work
[2:38:46.720 --> 2:38:51.920]  From the united states government because otherwise they're just going to sabotage whatever
[2:38:52.400 --> 2:38:59.520]  You're trying to do and of course we can't believe the who either. We know they're up to their eyeballs here. This uh wuhan
[2:38:59.520 --> 2:39:04.000]  Uh, uh bsl4 was a who specially
[2:39:04.720 --> 2:39:09.040]  Designated research laboratory. Yeah research on development testing
[2:39:09.440 --> 2:39:13.520]  Uh, uh and stockpiling of nazi biological warfare weapons
[2:39:13.840 --> 2:39:18.000]  So we're going to have to do this for ourselves, Alex. We're going to have to go out
[2:39:18.080 --> 2:39:23.040]  We're going to have to get our own experts. They are going to have to evaluate the situation
[2:39:23.440 --> 2:39:26.720]  Of course, I guess they can listen to what cdc fouchy
[2:39:26.720 --> 2:39:35.040]  Uh, uh who is telling them, but uh, I don't think they they should pay attention to it. Uh, I think they need to make the
[2:39:35.760 --> 2:39:43.760]  Uh judgments on their own just like the state of washington did right you you had that uh cdc director say, oh
[2:39:44.640 --> 2:39:49.520]  You you you american people go right ahead and fly out to washington and oregon
[2:39:49.920 --> 2:39:52.640]  Uh and california and two three hours later
[2:39:52.640 --> 2:39:58.160]  Uh, uh washington declares a state of emergency. So we have to act
[2:39:58.800 --> 2:40:04.320]  At a state and local basis to protect ourselves and not believe anyone
[2:40:04.720 --> 2:40:13.200]  Who has taken even one penny of this nazi biological warfare work from the from the united states government whether it's nih
[2:40:13.760 --> 2:40:15.360]  ni-aid
[2:40:15.360 --> 2:40:23.680]  See the pentagon anywhere else. Well, clearly there's a cover-up. Clearly there's a cover-up going on and I hope trump's not involved in it
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:28.240]  But regardless, it's my duty to report. They've they've they've been covering it up. They've been blocking test
[2:40:29.120 --> 2:40:32.080]  We know the federal government is doing that. So we're bringing this up that are boiled
[2:40:33.200 --> 2:40:34.480]  Look at communist china
[2:40:34.480 --> 2:40:40.080]  They weren't able to cover up and look at other countries like italy. They're not going to cover up. So I agree with you
[2:40:40.080 --> 2:40:44.800]  They're not going to be able to cover this up. So what do you see speculating coming out of this?
[2:40:47.760 --> 2:40:54.960]  Well, Alex right now, I think we are facing uh an american, uh, coronavirus pandemic. That's clear
[2:40:55.040 --> 2:40:58.560]  this is going to sweep all over the country um and
[2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:08.080]  Uh, it won't it's not going to be I guess our government is not going to be able to do the same things that communist china did
[2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:11.440]  But the federal government very well might try right
[2:41:12.160 --> 2:41:18.480]  Um, what can I say? But I think you know the genie is now out of the bottle due to the criminal malpractice
[2:41:19.280 --> 2:41:20.880]  and incompetence
[2:41:20.880 --> 2:41:22.880]  Of the united states federal government
[2:41:23.360 --> 2:41:27.680]  They knew right from the get-go very closely from the get-go what was going on here?
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:30.560]  I mean if if it is a who lab
[2:41:31.040 --> 2:41:33.600]  We did we knew what's going on. They must know
[2:41:34.560 --> 2:41:35.440]  of course
[2:41:35.440 --> 2:41:40.160]  So, um, they've been lying at the feds have been lying and covering up
[2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:44.000]  Uh, uh and doing damage control and damage limitation
[2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:47.360]  From the beginning and I I'm not here bashing
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:53.680]  President trump. I don't really know what president trump knows exactly. We're just reporting what the facts are
[2:41:54.720 --> 2:42:00.160]  Right. I mean the people he round he has around them are worthless. They are more dangerous than worthless
[2:42:00.560 --> 2:42:02.560]  And to be fair again
[2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:11.120]  Uh, uh, show him fair. I I also, uh, uh, seriously attack president obama for the way he handled that, uh, a bolo
[2:42:12.400 --> 2:42:14.400]  Uh, uh outbreak it's clear
[2:42:15.120 --> 2:42:17.920]  That let me ask you this when we come back and we'll do five minutes
[2:42:18.240 --> 2:42:20.720]  You'll leave us and I'll get to all the calls folks and when you're done
[2:42:20.720 --> 2:42:23.200]  Then we'll go to the the guest host. It's about to take over
[2:42:23.680 --> 2:42:27.600]  I want to ask dr. Francis Boyle is one of the top experts out there not just from science but law
[2:42:27.600 --> 2:42:30.640]  Um, projecting out the numbers
[2:42:31.520 --> 2:42:35.760]  If there is a cover-up how bad it's going to get for death versus
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:39.840]  Supply chain and as long as it gets out of law and science, it's more like
[2:42:40.400 --> 2:42:44.320]  There's I have footage when we come back of east coast and west coast
[2:42:44.800 --> 2:42:49.600]  Um ship ports are usually full or just empty of the containers. What does that signify?
[2:42:49.920 --> 2:42:51.920]  We'll talk about it when we come right back stay with us
[2:42:51.920 --> 2:43:00.800]  This should really be easier than it is. I'm not here giving you a sales pitch. I'm pointing out
[2:43:01.280 --> 2:43:08.960]  The way forward things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you will listen to me and try them out for yourself
[2:43:09.120 --> 2:43:11.120]  You will see how amazing it is
[2:43:11.440 --> 2:43:18.880]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us and it's symbiotic
[2:43:18.880 --> 2:43:23.840]  My friends I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen
[2:43:24.080 --> 2:43:26.080]  fluorides the bad halogen and
[2:43:26.080 --> 2:43:32.240]  People told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to dr. Group like
[2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:39.680]  Eight years ago. It started taking true iodine atomic iodine. We've got it back in stock x2
[2:43:40.160 --> 2:43:45.040]  40% off right now at info or store.com and I'm telling you folks get it
[2:43:45.040 --> 2:43:51.920]  It's amazing discover the benefits and it funds the info or a 360 win. You can't lose unless you don't take action
[2:43:53.280 --> 2:43:55.280]  The evidence is overwhelming
[2:43:55.440 --> 2:44:02.000]  Coronavirus is a man-made bio weapon designed to destroy nation states economies and free peoples
[2:44:02.400 --> 2:44:09.200]  And usher in a planetary government. This is how the globalists are striking back. Here's a fortune headline today
[2:44:09.200 --> 2:44:16.000]  Fears of global coronavirus contagion rage as 3000 cruise ship passengers return home
[2:44:16.480 --> 2:44:18.480]  And that's just in one nation
[2:44:19.120 --> 2:44:23.280]  Coronavirus deals major blow to german car factories in china
[2:44:23.840 --> 2:44:28.160]  The reporting it could cut their sales in half this year
[2:44:28.880 --> 2:44:31.280]  That's how major this is
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  Everyone needs to be prepared
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:37.040]  2020 is not a year to play games
[2:44:37.040 --> 2:44:41.680]  Info wars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out
[2:44:42.240 --> 2:44:46.320]  Regardless of the fact of the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth
[2:44:46.800 --> 2:44:52.480]  We need you to step into the plate and help spread the word about band.video and info wars.com today
[2:44:54.240 --> 2:45:01.920]  We always promote being prepared having firearms knowing how to use them and be self-sufficient and learn how to hunt and learn how to garden
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:04.640]  I mean, it's just it's what we're meant to do. It feels good when we do it
[2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:09.840]  But we do sell high-quality swarble food. I told my patriot a month ago. I said, what can you handle?
[2:45:09.840 --> 2:45:12.240]  I said, I think it's gonna be really big and they said, well, we can handle probably this
[2:45:12.240 --> 2:45:15.520]  We're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund
[2:45:15.680 --> 2:45:16.880]  I said, no, I think this is going to be huge
[2:45:16.880 --> 2:45:20.800]  I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food even though the prices are going up for you
[2:45:20.880 --> 2:45:24.000]  So those are the types of discussions we have and I'm just giving the inside baseball of all of us

[2:45:29.920 --> 2:45:35.760]  Okay at info war store.com you go right in the queue first come first serve, but the fact that the orders are so
[2:45:36.080 --> 2:45:41.600]  Ultramassive it's busy. I mean, this is just insane. We're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe
[2:45:41.760 --> 2:45:47.680]  And then if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend food sales that everybody gets to order in
[2:45:47.760 --> 2:45:54.000]  We'll get your food, but that's how big this is. So what you're getting is a hundred percent the straight deal of what's going on info war store.com

[2:46:57.040 --> 2:46:59.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:46:59.680 --> 2:47:01.680]  So
[2:47:16.080 --> 2:47:18.080]  The Alex Jones show
[2:47:18.080 --> 2:47:28.880]  Because there's a war on for your mind
[2:47:29.600 --> 2:47:31.600]  I'm your host. Thanks for joining us
[2:47:32.960 --> 2:47:34.960]  All right in closing Dr. Francis Boyle
[2:47:35.600 --> 2:47:39.600]  Um, we really appreciate you your author research people should check out the titles of your books
[2:47:39.840 --> 2:47:43.520]  One of the amazing things you write about just as a as a patriot
[2:47:43.520 --> 2:47:49.360]  It's just a pro-human person just as a professor. It's a guy that wrote the us biological weapons law the u.n. Then adopted
[2:47:52.320 --> 2:47:58.320]  What are your biggest concerns or final points you want to make about where this is going because you know, italy shutting down all sporting events
[2:47:59.040 --> 2:48:02.640]  tourism down by like 87 the number is I mean
[2:48:03.440 --> 2:48:09.840]  This is a giant panic if this isn't super deadly over nothing. So either way you cut it something big is going on
[2:48:09.840 --> 2:48:11.840]  I
[2:48:12.080 --> 2:48:17.200]  Think you're correct. Uh, uh, I think you know the fact that the fed
[2:48:18.320 --> 2:48:26.640]  Uh, uh, when uh, pal trumps old man was asked. Uh, well, we might consider further rate cuts at the end of march and then two days later
[2:48:27.120 --> 2:48:29.120]  They cut it by, uh
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:35.600]  Half a point. I I think they realize how dangerous the situation is as I said, uh
[2:48:36.560 --> 2:48:38.560]  We in my opinion we are facing
[2:48:38.560 --> 2:48:41.520]  Uh, uh, a corona virus
[2:48:42.560 --> 2:48:44.560]  Epidemic here in america
[2:48:44.800 --> 2:48:46.800]  Uh, it will spread across the country
[2:48:47.360 --> 2:48:50.880]  Um, it will have about a 15% lethality rate
[2:48:51.520 --> 2:48:53.520]  Uh, the other, uh
[2:48:54.160 --> 2:49:00.880]  80% might be you know mild cases that will people will suffer but uh get over with
[2:49:01.360 --> 2:49:04.080]  It will be extremely dangerous for, um
[2:49:04.080 --> 2:49:09.920]  Uh senior citizens, you'll note seattle just recently publicly said
[2:49:10.480 --> 2:49:14.080]  That anyone over 60 should stay home
[2:49:14.720 --> 2:49:20.080]  And avoid public gatherings. I think that is very good. Uh, public health advice. Yes, and I'm
[2:49:20.560 --> 2:49:26.320]  Doing the best I can to keep my wife at home and of course I come into my office until they
[2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:31.520]  Uh, shut us down. Um, yes and avoid public gatherings for sure
[2:49:31.520 --> 2:49:36.480]  Um, and then, you know, do do the best you can but yes mass
[2:49:37.040 --> 2:49:39.600]  Uh hand washing, uh and realize
[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:46.720]  Everyone, you know, everyone who's saying, uh, oh, well, uh, uh, the flu is more, uh infectious
[2:49:47.200 --> 2:49:53.840]  That's just a total lie. It's not been proven. This is like one 10 to 1% versus 2% and here's my gut level
[2:49:54.960 --> 2:49:57.760]  I get the chai comms use it to crack down on taiwan their own people
[2:49:57.760 --> 2:50:04.400]  They wouldn't shut down almost all their factories and all their major cities and lose tens of billions a day just for a power trip
[2:50:04.640 --> 2:50:08.960]  This is crippling them for decades. I mean, this must be something really bad doctor
[2:50:10.480 --> 2:50:16.320]  Right now, so we you know, you really can't believe anything coming out of china, uh between you and me
[2:50:16.960 --> 2:50:20.560]  And and their statistics or anything like that. What do you think's happening?
[2:50:21.280 --> 2:50:25.200]  Well, I think we're seeing, uh, uh, a severe threat to the
[2:50:25.200 --> 2:50:33.600]  Um, uh communist system of government over there that that is shaking it as very foundations. Yes, and uh, whatever
[2:50:34.400 --> 2:50:36.400]  Statistics that coming out are completely
[2:50:36.960 --> 2:50:41.600]  Could this be let's let's talk about it. Could this be because we know obama sold it to china
[2:50:41.920 --> 2:50:44.480]  Could this be a u.s. Globalist base?
[2:50:45.120 --> 2:50:51.520]  Bioweapon to launch at china for their fentanyl attacks. I'm not saying that's happening. I'm not positing that theory
[2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:54.960]  I just people are saying that. What do you think?
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  Well, elix what I I see just from the record is
[2:51:00.960 --> 2:51:05.840]  University of north carolina was doing this nazi biological warfare work
[2:51:06.560 --> 2:51:12.400]  China bought and paid to get involved in it because they knew what was going on
[2:51:12.960 --> 2:51:16.320]  And then they brought that, uh, uh, nazi technology
[2:51:17.360 --> 2:51:20.000]  Back to china they weaponized it
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:29.520]  Uh, obviously for use against us and or, uh, russia maybe taiwan. I don't know and they shot themselves in the foot
[2:51:30.080 --> 2:51:36.480]  That's the way I see it now. It leaked out of there. Well, that's what that's what a lot of the really smart people in the pentagon
[2:51:36.480 --> 2:51:39.840]  I've talked to and that's what a lot of people even jill scowls
[2:51:39.840 --> 2:51:44.640]  It's always been proof is that they all think it leaked out by maybe harvesters getting the gloves or whatever
[2:51:44.960 --> 2:51:48.960]  That were supposed to be burned and that's that's what why would you release this? It doesn't make sense
[2:51:48.960 --> 2:51:55.840]  Right even from their perspective, uh, it would not make sense what what it has done to them as I said it
[2:51:56.160 --> 2:52:01.600]  I I think it's going to shake their communist system to its foundations. Yes, you're right
[2:52:02.240 --> 2:52:07.360]  Uh, it could short. I don't know what what happened from what you're saying is bottom line. This is a big deal
[2:52:07.840 --> 2:52:09.840]  Anyway, you look at it. This is huge
[2:52:11.200 --> 2:52:13.200]  Well, that's the way I see it. Yes
[2:52:13.600 --> 2:52:15.920]  And it's far more serious than the flu
[2:52:15.920 --> 2:52:21.840]  Uh, all these people saying well, the flu is worth that's just total propaganda that that's just red herring
[2:52:22.240 --> 2:52:25.360]  Uh, designed to get the american people
[2:52:25.840 --> 2:52:29.040]  From focusing in really on what's happening here
[2:52:29.280 --> 2:52:34.720]  Well, exactly usually usually the media creates a straw man of what trump has said that isn't true and I defend trump
[2:52:35.120 --> 2:52:39.440]  Well, what he said it's like the flu two percent. Well, the flu is less than one to the one percent
[2:52:39.680 --> 2:52:42.640]  That is a admittedly false statement. I'm not attacking trump
[2:52:42.640 --> 2:52:46.080]  It's just fouts. He's obviously telling him this and it's just not true
[2:52:48.080 --> 2:52:53.680]  That's right. I mean, isn't that I mean how many times is one to the one percent do the math versus two percent?
[2:52:53.920 --> 2:52:56.160]  I mean, it's it's it's 20 times more powerful
[2:52:57.200 --> 2:53:01.760]  We know that uh, president trump is a drum germapho. We we know that for sure
[2:53:02.240 --> 2:53:04.480]  So, uh, I just don't think he's getting
[2:53:05.280 --> 2:53:10.160]  He's getting criminal advice from people like that's one thing roger stone told me. It's not a secret, but
[2:53:10.160 --> 2:53:15.680]  Trump loves white people black people everybody, but he had to get over the phobia of shaking hands
[2:53:16.160 --> 2:53:18.320]  So he is a germaphobe or he used to be
[2:53:19.120 --> 2:53:25.600]  I'm not here to defend trump either. I'm just trying to objectively look at the situation and say the advice
[2:53:25.680 --> 2:53:32.560]  He's getting is more dangerous than useless when it comes to protecting the american people and unfortunately
[2:53:33.200 --> 2:53:37.280]  Uh, if he continues to rely on the same cast of characters
[2:53:37.280 --> 2:53:41.040]  It's going to read down to his detriment in the no, I agree
[2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:44.080]  and at a gut level
[2:53:44.160 --> 2:53:47.280]  To me the way the media is saying it's trumps fault. We predict they would do that
[2:53:47.680 --> 2:53:51.200]  I think this is the biggest threat to trumps reelection coming up in six months. What do you think?
[2:53:52.480 --> 2:53:56.480]  Well, let me say this this problem long preceded trump
[2:53:57.200 --> 2:54:01.920]  So this is the tip of the iceberg and and trump is coming in on top of it
[2:54:01.920 --> 2:54:06.560]  Is that not defending him? He just inherited this, but if he does the wrong thing, he will then own it
[2:54:08.080 --> 2:54:16.080]  That's correct. Trump is is basically left holding the bag here for years of this nazi biological warfare work
[2:54:16.640 --> 2:54:20.880]  Going back to the neocons under reagan and continuing
[2:54:21.760 --> 2:54:28.320]  Today through obama. You're perfectly, uh, correct on that. So, uh, and I also
[2:54:28.320 --> 2:54:33.760]  You know a stock broker friend of mine sent me a, uh, you know, a wells fargo
[2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:38.240]  prediction on all this and asked me to take a look at it and give my comments
[2:54:38.720 --> 2:54:42.640]  At you know wells fargo. Uh, they said out to all their investors
[2:54:43.280 --> 2:54:46.800]  Uh, uh, basically saying well, we're not facing a recession
[2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:52.160]  I don't see how we can avoid a recession, uh, alex under under these circumstances
[2:54:52.560 --> 2:54:56.320]  The way things are going it right now. It's it's out of control
[2:54:56.320 --> 2:54:58.320]  And I don't think the, uh
[2:54:58.800 --> 2:55:02.320]  team that that president trump has around them can
[2:55:03.040 --> 2:55:06.560]  Bring this, uh under control between you and me. I could be wrong
[2:55:06.880 --> 2:55:09.440]  But again that goes back to my advice
[2:55:10.160 --> 2:55:16.320]  That we cannot rely we american people cannot rely on the federal government to save us. No, you're right
[2:55:16.320 --> 2:55:19.440]  They are not going to save us. They have they have made this
[2:55:20.080 --> 2:55:25.760]  Uh, uh almost out of control at this point. So we are you're right and the dow's down
[2:55:25.760 --> 2:55:30.720]  A thousand points despite a massive interest rate cut. Dr. Boyle. I know you're a very busy man
[2:55:30.720 --> 2:55:34.560]  I want to thank you and your family and your wife and your students for the time you took out here
[2:55:34.560 --> 2:55:38.640]  I know you never plug yourself, but you've written a lot of great books. Where do people find your books?
[2:55:39.760 --> 2:55:45.120]  Uh, you could just hit my name on amazon.com. Um, go right ahead. Sure
[2:55:45.760 --> 2:55:49.120]  So you just look up dr. Francis. Hey boy, you'll find it. I've read seller your books
[2:55:50.400 --> 2:55:53.760]  That's my key book there, uh, dealing with the, um
[2:55:53.760 --> 2:55:57.920]  U. S. Uh, biological warfare, uh programs
[2:55:58.720 --> 2:56:00.720]  Going back to reagan
[2:56:01.200 --> 2:56:06.160]  Sure. So again, trump is left holding the bat. He better take action
[2:56:06.960 --> 2:56:08.960]  But unfortunately
[2:56:09.280 --> 2:56:12.400]  That's politics if he can't bring this under control
[2:56:13.040 --> 2:56:17.440]  Uh, the american people are going to hold them responsible for that. That's just the way things work
[2:56:17.440 --> 2:56:23.440]  Well, a month ago when you said it, it was somewhat speculation. Now it's happening. You've been proven right. Thank you, dr. Boyle
[2:56:24.480 --> 2:56:30.960]  Thank you, alex. And again, I appreciate always the, uh, fair interview you gave me. Uh, you've given me online
[2:56:30.960 --> 2:56:33.360]  Oh, yeah, this is the real alex jones show not the edited clips
[2:56:33.680 --> 2:56:36.960]  I used to have fun at crazy on air like once a week. They just take that out of context
[2:56:36.960 --> 2:56:39.280]  But everybody gets the real show. Thank you so much doctor
[2:56:40.160 --> 2:56:41.360]  Thanks a lot
[2:56:41.360 --> 2:56:44.160]  Believe me, I want to act crazy and silly and be really stupid right now
[2:56:44.160 --> 2:56:47.440]  But I'm not going to do it because when I get stressed out, I tend to have fun and act out
[2:56:47.520 --> 2:56:50.240]  But I don't I barely do that anymore. You notice there's not satire anymore
[2:56:50.240 --> 2:56:55.840]  We don't screw around very much because they take out a context and say, oh look jones, you know, he really believes all this stuff
[2:56:56.480 --> 2:56:59.440]  Uh, I'm really concerned about my children. I know you are and
[2:57:01.600 --> 2:57:05.920]  When I told you five weeks ago, the big institutions are buying up all this horrible food. It's because they were
[2:57:06.720 --> 2:57:08.720]  We still have it at infowarstore.com
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:12.720]  It's five to eight weeks putting on what you order because we're not gonna lie to you
[2:57:12.720 --> 2:57:19.200]  Everybody else is sold out. They're lying. They don't even have the food. We have the food. We have the factories. We have the top producer
[2:57:19.600 --> 2:57:21.200]  They are
[2:57:21.200 --> 2:57:26.240]  Five to eight weeks. They're really four weeks. Okay, I mean that we're gonna tell you technically five eight weeks
[2:57:26.240 --> 2:57:28.240]  They're like jones just put extra weeks on
[2:57:28.240 --> 2:57:32.400]  That's because they were worried the food wars would keep going totally crazy and then they kind of are but not as much

[3:00:26.560 --> 3:00:30.400]  Let's go ahead chris. Thanks for holding you're on the air from north carolina south carolina. Go ahead
[3:00:31.760 --> 3:00:35.120]  Hey alex thanks for taking my call longtime listener. I love your show, dude
[3:00:35.120 --> 3:00:39.600]  Thank you, brother. We're out here in upstate south carolina engaging in the info war
[3:00:43.760 --> 3:00:45.760]  Well earlier, I heard you entertain the idea
[3:00:46.560 --> 3:00:51.760]  That cosco footage could be a gimmick like with the cabbage patch dolls. Maybe it isn't real or something
[3:00:51.760 --> 3:00:54.080]  But that's all because i sent out my crew
[3:00:54.800 --> 3:00:57.280]  To a bunch of places that were supposedly out of stuff and awesome
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:02.800]  And they weren't the crews like sir. They're not sold out. I go but so put the report out like
[3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:05.120]  The we just want to show what's happening. So what do you think?
[3:01:06.560 --> 3:01:13.360]  Well, I went to cosco last night locally here and uh, usually they've got lots of food items on sale and last night
[3:01:13.360 --> 3:01:15.360]  There were far fewer sale signs
[3:01:15.600 --> 3:01:19.040]  And when I got when I got to the back of the store where they keep the cases of bottled water
[3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:21.920]  And paper towels and toilet paper and all that
[3:01:22.560 --> 3:01:27.120]  They had the ground level pallets where you can pick those items off the pallet and put them in your cart
[3:01:27.120 --> 3:01:32.720]  But in the shelves above where they usually store the extra inventory where the pallets are all wrapped up
[3:01:33.120 --> 3:01:38.880]  It was all empty space and one of the employees was back there consolidating pallets of their store brand toilet paper
[3:01:39.360 --> 3:01:42.560]  And I walked up and I said hey, man, I've never seen it looking so empty back here
[3:01:42.720 --> 3:01:45.120]  And he replied neither of I not in 12 years
[3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:50.080]  So I mean obviously there's pressure on the supply chain. There's a lot of panic buying going on
[3:01:50.400 --> 3:01:55.120]  Well like a communist country that bernie sanders would want where you don't get multiple types of deodorant or toilet paper
[3:01:55.120 --> 3:01:59.360]  There are too many types of deodorant. We need lines. Those are quotes
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:02.960]  A free market system can leverage up or down
[3:02:03.520 --> 3:02:08.800]  During crises. That's why it's so hard to take us down. But I mean, I do think they've covered up how bad the virus is
[3:02:08.800 --> 3:02:10.800]  What do you think's going to happen?
[3:02:11.840 --> 3:02:15.680]  Well, I I mean, I think the virus is bad, but I think that
[3:02:16.400 --> 3:02:21.440]  You know people have been saying hey, you know, chris you're buying into the panic and the hype
[3:02:21.440 --> 3:02:26.160]  But I think that getting ahead of this curve is super vital
[3:02:26.720 --> 3:02:30.560]  Because you know if if you're ahead of the curve then you're prepared
[3:02:30.640 --> 3:02:36.640]  Then you don't have to panic when everybody else can't find anything. That's there's a 10% chance. This is really bad
[3:02:36.800 --> 3:02:38.800]  That's why you get prepared
[3:02:38.800 --> 3:02:42.560]  And then you're prepared that that's what preparedness is about like you have insurance
[3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:45.360]  We have a gun and you know by your bed at night, you know the drawer
[3:02:45.680 --> 3:02:47.520]  You're not thinking somebody's gonna break in that night
[3:02:47.520 --> 3:02:52.400]  It's just there to know that you're secure ready to defend yourself because you're not a victim
[3:02:53.120 --> 3:02:54.640]  But you just said it
[3:02:54.640 --> 3:02:57.680]  And and now it becomes more and more obvious that it is going to be a big deal
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:00.000]  And those of us that prepared again
[3:03:00.720 --> 3:03:02.720]  Are going to be in the right position, but
[3:03:04.960 --> 3:03:08.560]  We're better off than communist china, but we're going to see what's going to happen chris
[3:03:09.600 --> 3:03:11.280]  Exactly
[3:03:11.280 --> 3:03:16.800]  Well, I love your show man. Thanks for taking my call. I love the product and you have a good one. Okay, god speed
[3:03:16.800 --> 3:03:19.280]  You too chris. Thanks for holding. All right. I don't want to cut
[3:03:20.080 --> 3:03:21.520]  Nathaniel
[3:03:21.520 --> 3:03:24.480]  Short so Nathaniel will come back in 60 seconds. We'll go to you and then dan
[3:03:25.120 --> 3:03:26.080]  michael
[3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:28.080]  And trish for those callers and then
[3:03:29.040 --> 3:03:33.200]  We're gonna have matt bracken take over for three segments the rest of the hour
[3:03:33.520 --> 3:03:38.640]  Normally you have a guest host fourth hour. It's always fun. They're charged up. They've got the new news. They're ready to go on
[3:03:39.120 --> 3:03:41.440]  Sometimes I comment here a little bit of it, but then
[3:03:43.040 --> 3:03:45.040]  We're going to have
[3:03:45.040 --> 3:03:52.160]  I want shroyer and the war room all ready for you. But you know, I'm not only a hair club international member
[3:03:53.280 --> 3:03:55.120]  I'm also the owner
[3:03:55.120 --> 3:03:56.240]  and so
[3:03:56.240 --> 3:03:58.400]  Look what hair club international did for me
[3:03:59.600 --> 3:04:02.720]  You know all these years I've been wearing a toupee. I actually never wore toupee
[3:04:03.600 --> 3:04:06.240]  But this toupee I'm wearing is the highest quality ever
[3:04:07.280 --> 3:04:12.240]  It actually feels the best right now. You're ready illiterate. You're saying. Why are you talking about toupee?
[3:04:12.240 --> 3:04:16.000]  Well, the truth is I've been a beluga whale all my life
[3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:18.800]  But one that was bipedal
[3:04:19.360 --> 3:04:21.360]  And so now I'm embracing my trans
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:23.280]  zoological
[3:04:23.280 --> 3:04:24.320]  nature
[3:04:24.320 --> 3:04:27.040]  That I am indeed an a re-entrant aquatic
[3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:30.400]  Baluga species
[3:04:30.400 --> 3:04:42.400]  And my main enemy is the killer whale
[3:04:42.640 --> 3:04:46.400]  Having some fun today. It's thursday thursday
[3:04:52.320 --> 3:04:58.320]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that we're seeing record food sales
[3:04:58.320 --> 3:05:02.160]  Not just here, but across the world. That's good people need to be
[3:05:02.720 --> 3:05:06.320]  Self-sufficient the average person is living hand-to-mouth
[3:05:06.960 --> 3:05:10.000]  Paycheck to paycheck and doesn't even know how to change their tire
[3:05:10.480 --> 3:05:15.920]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared and that means even with just the basics
[3:05:16.000 --> 3:05:21.280]  Even a three week food supply that you know is always there that you only go to in emergencies
[3:05:21.840 --> 3:05:28.000]  That said boosting your immune system is just as critical or even more so and things like dna

[3:06:17.280 --> 3:06:21.920]  Now sanyo in north carolina, I agree with you the coronavirus could be
[3:06:24.640 --> 3:06:26.640]  The new 9-11, what do you think?
[3:06:26.640 --> 3:06:31.520]  Well, god bless you alex and uh, it's great to chat with you
[3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:34.960]  You know, you've often said that uh, your gut
[3:06:35.520 --> 3:06:41.520]  You know points you in the right direction and and typically it it knows best and I just want to share what's in my gut
[3:06:42.160 --> 3:06:47.360]  And this kind of feels to me like a like a global slow motion
[3:06:47.760 --> 3:06:51.920]  The 9-11 event across multiple nations obviously
[3:06:51.920 --> 3:07:00.240]  But it seems that when really wicked things happen that uh, it involves a perfect storm where
[3:07:00.800 --> 3:07:04.640]  Multiple large agendas are served by the large power
[3:07:05.120 --> 3:07:09.360]  The planets have to align all the globalist bodies have to agree upon it
[3:07:10.400 --> 3:07:13.520]  Uh, you know, you look back at just recent history, you know
[3:07:14.240 --> 3:07:19.200]  When jfk got his head blown off multiple agendas were served when 9-11 happened
[3:07:19.200 --> 3:07:26.720]  And in 2001 multiple agendas were served and this has that feeling of it and it stinks and uh
[3:07:27.120 --> 3:07:30.720]  So I want that's what my gut is telling me right now. There's a lot we don't know
[3:07:30.880 --> 3:07:33.280]  But there's a lot we know about what's going on right now
[3:07:33.680 --> 3:07:36.960]  And so and the key is that it is a man made bio weapon
[3:07:36.960 --> 3:07:41.360]  They've confirmed it and that it reinfects with different aspects like a swiss army knife
[3:07:41.760 --> 3:07:46.880]  Or like hiv which it has the same delivery device. It keeps coming back. That's what's so deadly
[3:07:46.880 --> 3:07:50.000]  Who knows what it does in phase three phase four phase five?
[3:07:51.120 --> 3:07:57.360]  Precisely and you know, whether it was you know leaked or or uh, whether it escaped
[3:07:58.480 --> 3:08:06.240]  It's you know, what ultimately hopefully we'll we'll understand that we'll we'll know that but it's almost irrelevant because at this point
[3:08:06.560 --> 3:08:08.560]  It will be utilized, you know, my
[3:08:09.680 --> 3:08:13.760]  A good job of just going down the punch list of agendas. No, you're right
[3:08:13.760 --> 3:08:17.280]  But you go back six weeks ago. Who's even knows I had this this this idea
[3:08:17.360 --> 3:08:20.560]  I said a man in an astronaut's outfit. I saw the image. I said, yes
[3:08:20.960 --> 3:08:26.800]  The earth uninhabitable for humans and I said this is the future and weeks later. That was what was but it wasn't weeks later
[3:08:26.800 --> 3:08:28.800]  It was already going on
[3:08:29.680 --> 3:08:34.320]  It's it's your gut. It's the basic instinct and you know, a lot of folks are
[3:08:34.880 --> 3:08:36.880]  Are starting to get that awareness
[3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:42.720]  And you know, I'll just make the analogy it's kind of crude but it almost feels like the first tower just got hit
[3:08:42.720 --> 3:08:45.200]  And the fireball is still up in the air
[3:08:45.600 --> 3:08:52.720]  Exactly and we're all just tuning in now to see the second tower and then we're going to watch them collapse in the other towers
[3:08:52.960 --> 3:08:54.960]  And then the response that comes after
[3:08:55.840 --> 3:09:01.280]  And it's going to play out over months and potentially over the next one to two years or or even more
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:06.960]  But agendas it this has the potential to serve a lot of wicked agendas and
[3:09:06.960 --> 3:09:13.200]  You just can't discount some of the things that are happening right now. Yeah, zero hedge has linked to an article
[3:09:13.600 --> 3:09:17.600]  By a fellow named professor anthony hall. I don't know his politics
[3:09:17.920 --> 3:09:21.200]  Professor anthony hall. I think he might be on tomorrow. Yeah, we really want him on
[3:09:21.840 --> 3:09:25.280]  I scanned the article. I didn't do a deep dive on it
[3:09:25.360 --> 3:09:30.720]  But you know, he raises a lot of interesting questions and has some powerful info in there
[3:09:31.280 --> 3:09:33.280]  I don't know much about his background
[3:09:33.280 --> 3:09:41.280]  But we need to be asking the tough questions. We we can't be cowed and we have to be brave and we have to be resilient
[3:09:41.920 --> 3:09:47.760]  You know, you've often said and many folks have said at its core. We're involved in a spiritual battle right now
[3:09:48.480 --> 3:09:52.320]  And we need to pray to Almighty God in the name of Jesus Christ
[3:09:52.800 --> 3:09:54.800]  Not only for his shield of protection
[3:09:55.360 --> 3:09:59.280]  But that God might bring his mighty sort of justice into this world
[3:09:59.280 --> 3:10:04.080]  And to find up and cast out into the fiery pit of abject failure
[3:10:04.240 --> 3:10:11.440]  All those wicked sick degenerate evil entities that are looking to bring death doom destruction and disparate humanity
[3:10:11.680 --> 3:10:18.400]  The united states of america is the beacon of free humanity and that's that's what this country is all right
[3:10:18.560 --> 3:10:22.160]  Make no mistake. This is the globalist attack. Nathan amazing. God bless you
[3:10:22.800 --> 3:10:26.640]  Wow, that's a four minutes exactly. He was on we're gonna put that in there as a
[3:10:26.640 --> 3:10:31.520]  Four-minute piece running during the breaks set of ads. We run the great callers during the ads
[3:10:31.520 --> 3:10:35.840]  He can be reheard. He was the caller of the day unless these other three callers are even more powerful
[3:10:35.840 --> 3:10:40.320]  We got to move quick with five minutes left Dan in wisconsin. Thanks for holding her on the air than michael and trish
[3:10:41.840 --> 3:10:42.960]  Hello
[3:10:42.960 --> 3:10:44.560]  Welcome Dan
[3:10:44.560 --> 3:10:49.600]  Hi, Alex. Um, I want to piggyback off the last fellow's point
[3:10:49.600 --> 3:10:56.320]  Dr. Boyle did us a great service. He said that you can't trust anything that comes out of the who
[3:10:57.520 --> 3:11:00.720]  Did you hear about the the pandemic bonds?
[3:11:03.760 --> 3:11:08.240]  The the pandemic bonds are bonds that were set aside for
[3:11:09.360 --> 3:11:11.040]  paying money
[3:11:11.040 --> 3:11:16.720]  Out in case there's a pandemic. Well, I know after 9 11. They set up some different
[3:11:16.720 --> 3:11:19.200]  Uh funds that are for emergencies. Those are way out
[3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:26.560]  Well, the one that I'm talking about is going to be paid off like in april and if they don't call a pandemic before then
[3:11:27.440 --> 3:11:29.440]  Then they get the money
[3:11:29.520 --> 3:11:33.920]  I mean, why aren't we calling for uh a taiwan freedom march size?
[3:11:34.560 --> 3:11:36.560]  Occupation of the who
[3:11:36.880 --> 3:11:41.840]  No, that's confirmed. You're right. Even even the wall street like created special bond funds for this
[3:11:42.080 --> 3:11:44.400]  That's a good point and tell folks more about that
[3:11:44.400 --> 3:11:48.320]  I'd love to um, it's totally unethical
[3:11:48.720 --> 3:11:54.960]  It's so unethical that if you take where the who is positioned in the federal government the total
[3:11:55.760 --> 3:11:58.880]  line of thinking is that you've got to stop
[3:11:59.520 --> 3:12:08.080]  Where are the you got to cut the head off the snake? You got you got a why can't we occupy the who to the point where mainstream media can't stop
[3:12:08.080 --> 3:12:15.440]  Broadcasting and on television. Why can't we have a million man march or a two million man march on the who?
[3:12:16.080 --> 3:12:20.880]  Why can't we great point dan is time to start exposing the power structure and who's behind
[3:12:21.520 --> 3:12:25.200]  All these biological weapons and the quote treatment of them. That's really the way to develop them
[3:12:25.440 --> 3:12:30.800]  And that's why we had dr. Francis Boyle on earlier saying he believes these agencies are committing criminal malfeasers. Thank you dan
[3:12:31.280 --> 3:12:34.000]  Michael in michigan. Thanks for holding your own here
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:41.040]  Hi, thank you. I'm a fairly new listener. So I'm just kind of playing catch-up, but I I appreciate your interview with
[3:12:41.840 --> 3:12:43.840]  Dr. Boyle. I hope you'll have him on again
[3:12:44.320 --> 3:12:49.680]  And also Mike Adams. I heard him the other day and he was fantastic. They're both amazing. They're good people
[3:12:50.560 --> 3:12:54.720]  Absolutely, um, please have them. Please continue to have them on. I will here's the question
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:12:57.520]  Here's the question. I would have hoped to have asked dr. Boyle
[3:12:57.840 --> 3:13:02.880]  Perhaps you want to take a stab at the answer yourself or maybe you could ask him the next time and he can get back to us
[3:13:02.880 --> 3:13:06.720]  So my question is does dr. Boyle see any scenario?
[3:13:07.360 --> 3:13:13.360]  Where this still could be controlled if we had leadership that would do what dr. Boyle suggests
[3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:15.680]  That's the first part of my question second part
[3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:22.080]  Is this does he believe this is the kind of infection or virus where people who so-called
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:24.000]  recover from it
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:27.520]  Because like you said, we don't know what happens in stage five for example
[3:13:27.520 --> 3:13:34.240]  Is this something where once people like let's let's assume we could all hide out for six months nine months a year
[3:13:34.240 --> 3:13:37.200]  Whatever and let it, you know do with things
[3:13:37.760 --> 3:13:42.480]  But then people who were they're going to still be contagious even though they are so-called recovered
[3:13:42.480 --> 3:13:47.840]  Are they going to be contagious for the rest of their life? This is like hiv this stuff. Well, I can answer your question on that
[3:13:49.520 --> 3:13:54.400]  Taking action and being admitting what's happening is always the best way and boyle would say that I can and he actually talked to that a
[3:13:54.400 --> 3:13:57.840]  Few days ago. He's been on like once a week the last month. He's been on for my show 20 years
[3:13:58.480 --> 3:14:00.480]  But to answer your second question
[3:14:01.280 --> 3:14:03.120]  um
[3:14:03.120 --> 3:14:05.120]  What was your second question I had the answer
[3:14:05.680 --> 3:14:08.240]  I'm trying to I'm trying to I'm thinking about okay
[3:14:08.400 --> 3:14:11.760]  There's not a whole lot we can do at this point other than try to protect ourselves
[3:14:11.840 --> 3:14:14.480]  So my question is I had the answer then I forgot what you said. What was it?
[3:14:15.280 --> 3:14:19.440]  So so okay does dr. Boyle think that this will be
[3:14:19.440 --> 3:14:26.720]  Eternally contagious, but it's not okay. Well, so not what he thinks if we know it's like hiv it reinfects
[3:14:27.280 --> 3:14:28.880]  It's a it's an autoimmune thing
[3:14:28.880 --> 3:14:32.960]  It's got hiv delivery systems and a bunch of other viruses built in so it's really bad
[3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:35.280]  And yes, that's the problem is it comes back
[3:14:35.360 --> 3:14:39.360]  That's why people are so scared if you don't just get it and maybe two percent die
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:44.480]  It's that it comes back and back. Thank you great point Michael. That's why people are so scared folks. It's man made
[3:14:44.560 --> 3:14:46.080]  It's super creepy
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:49.040]  And the u.s. Made it and china got it. So there's this weird
[3:14:49.600 --> 3:14:52.240]  Trump trying to be friends with china because no one knows really who did it
[3:14:52.560 --> 3:14:55.600]  And that's why this is so creepy because it's like a science fiction movie
[3:14:56.080 --> 3:14:58.400]  Trish you got 50 seconds. Sorry. What do you like go ahead Trish?
[3:14:59.200 --> 3:15:01.200]  Hey, how are you doing alex?
[3:15:01.200 --> 3:15:03.200]  I'm all right. Yeah
[3:15:03.520 --> 3:15:05.360]  Yeah, I had a question
[3:15:05.360 --> 3:15:09.680]  My concern is if they do develop a vaccine for this
[3:15:10.640 --> 3:15:12.000]  coronavirus
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  What if that's a way for them to get us
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  Just in
[3:15:16.080 --> 3:15:23.920]  Some kind of chip like a mark of the beast or absolutely it's all just more vaccine stuff. Yeah, I totally agree. Yeah
[3:15:25.200 --> 3:15:29.840]  And that's why if they get if they come up with one, I will not take it
[3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:35.680]  I swear I won't well because what they always come up with every protects you anyways. All right. I'm sorry. We're out of time Trish
[3:15:35.680 --> 3:15:37.680]  Thank you so much

[3:17:52.080 --> 3:17:56.960]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world a lot of people that never deliver
[3:17:57.760 --> 3:18:02.080]  Well, I'm here to tell you info wars has delivered in royal flush
[3:18:02.080 --> 3:18:06.240]  In a handful of ace of spades because of god
[3:18:06.960 --> 3:18:12.560]  Because of the audience of activists and because of the great team at info wars and we are all a team
[3:18:13.040 --> 3:18:18.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, so right now humanity's awakening. It's explosive. It's powerful. It's incredible
[3:18:18.960 --> 3:18:25.200]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road and the only way we can effectively fight the nwo and stay in the game
[3:18:25.440 --> 3:18:28.400]  Like info wars is the tip of the spear is your financial support
[3:18:28.400 --> 3:18:34.080]  We make it really easy and info wars store.com, but I am blowing through our backup money
[3:18:34.800 --> 3:18:40.960]  Right now our reporters doing triple the work they ever have because they volunteered to do it and oan and the rest of the crew
[3:18:40.960 --> 3:18:44.800]  Will fight 18 hours a day seven days a week during this election year
[3:18:44.960 --> 3:18:51.600]  That's so critical, but they need the financing to put them in the field go to info wars store.com and fight for your own future
[3:18:52.960 --> 3:18:56.320]  Real stuff, man. We're talking about the real deal here and I love trump all day long
[3:18:56.320 --> 3:19:00.800]  But man, I tell you he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running rough shot over everybody
[3:19:01.680 --> 3:19:03.200]  I mean, I've got a problem
[3:19:03.200 --> 3:19:06.720]  And we'll just take the trump rallies over that said about two months ago
[3:19:06.720 --> 3:19:08.720]  I came with a plan that I haven't launched yet
[3:19:08.720 --> 3:19:13.440]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers 20 different stickers
[3:19:13.840 --> 3:19:18.640]  impeach the democrats save the second amendment defend the first amendment info wars.com
[3:19:18.960 --> 3:19:21.200]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker
[3:19:21.200 --> 3:19:25.760]  You put it over your mouth you'd go to a trump rally and you instantly take over without even disrupting
[3:19:25.760 --> 3:19:29.520]  Then people say why are you doing this? What's happening when you go? Well, we're being censored
[3:19:30.240 --> 3:19:32.480]  You know trump won't do anything about it and dr. Pachennic
[3:19:32.560 --> 3:19:35.600]  I'm let me just ask you what you think because I've not launched this yet. It's brilliant
[3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:42.800]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon
[3:19:43.040 --> 3:19:48.240]  You have the loudest sound of all silence and you know what's most disturbing to people
[3:19:48.880 --> 3:19:50.880]  silence
[3:19:50.880 --> 3:19:57.840]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:19:57.840 --> 3:20:07.840]  Go
[3:20:14.480 --> 3:20:20.800]  Waging war on corruption it's alex jones with matt bracken
[3:20:20.800 --> 3:20:28.720]  All right, well, I'll tell you what a couple calls ago there was a caller
[3:20:29.280 --> 3:20:33.360]  I mean this is what a quality show to have callers like I think his name was adam
[3:20:34.480 --> 3:20:38.240]  But uh, he made some he made some just really unbelievable points
[3:20:39.120 --> 3:20:40.320]  and
[3:20:40.320 --> 3:20:42.320]  And I hope that
[3:20:42.320 --> 3:20:44.000]  People take it to heart
[3:20:44.000 --> 3:20:49.280]  Dr. Boyle he was spot on you know, I don't know the origins of this thing. I'm not a microbiologist
[3:20:49.280 --> 3:20:53.440]  But it's absolutely a biological world war we're in right now
[3:20:53.840 --> 3:20:57.760]  And you can say it's the chinese fault or the american government earlier or
[3:20:58.880 --> 3:21:05.360]  It maybe it's just bat soup who the hell knows really but I mean because we're all going to be getting information from everywhere
[3:21:06.000 --> 3:21:10.000]  But this is a biological world war and it's the it's the
[3:21:10.800 --> 3:21:15.040]  You know the coronavirus versus humanity at this point. It's out
[3:21:15.040 --> 3:21:22.720]  I think last week I mentioned dr. Strangelove where a crazy american general in the famous movie from the early 60s
[3:21:23.280 --> 3:21:28.080]  Launches a b52 strike because he's convinced he's got to start the uh start off
[3:21:28.240 --> 3:21:33.360]  You know armageddon for the good of the west and that other generals will have to follow
[3:21:33.920 --> 3:21:38.320]  And and that's you know in a sense. This is what china is now looking at
[3:21:38.880 --> 3:21:43.600]  There's no other country on the planet that could lose 500 million people
[3:21:43.600 --> 3:21:47.680]  And still have a billion left over to repopulate the world
[3:21:48.000 --> 3:21:50.880]  And if you don't think that they're thinking this way they are
[3:21:51.280 --> 3:21:54.880]  There's not anything you can trust out of the chinese communist party
[3:21:55.280 --> 3:22:00.800]  The figures are lies people from inside that are getting the word out are saying that hospitals have quotas
[3:22:01.120 --> 3:22:07.120]  It's all coming top down from the chinese communist party. Your hospital may not say it has x
[3:22:07.520 --> 3:22:12.320]  It can only say it has one quarter x and we're getting it under control. This is
[3:22:12.320 --> 3:22:14.320]  A pure communist propaganda
[3:22:15.360 --> 3:22:20.560]  What's really happening is what is what's happening in places like iran
[3:22:21.040 --> 3:22:27.280]  Where it's where it's rampant if you um if you can roll that that tape. I want to talk while it rolls
[3:22:27.680 --> 3:22:33.040]  This is what it really looks like when corona virus gets loose in an ordinary city
[3:22:33.440 --> 3:22:38.560]  Now china has the advantage that they can force people to quarantine or else
[3:22:38.560 --> 3:22:44.480]  You know, you either quarantine or we'll put you in a quarantine camp and you'll never be seen again
[3:22:45.040 --> 3:22:52.240]  But in in iran they're at the mass grave level and you know back up back earlier in that video they show
[3:22:52.800 --> 3:22:58.640]  They they show a a a morgue not even a morgue just I think it's the basement of a hospital
[3:22:59.040 --> 3:23:06.640]  Where there's just dozens of body bags and they're at the level now of bulldozing mass grave pits in iran
[3:23:06.640 --> 3:23:14.400]  This is the real story. It's not getting out to the u.s. Media. We are still in a pure cover-up mood
[3:23:14.800 --> 3:23:19.600]  We're still in what I call the jaws amity island, you know, happy talk
[3:23:20.000 --> 3:23:25.920]  Don't wreck the stock market. Don't cause people to panic, you know, there's there's no shark threat
[3:23:26.480 --> 3:23:32.000]  Okay, what's important is that the fourth of july festival doesn't get ruined. That's the stock market
[3:23:32.160 --> 3:23:34.160]  We don't want to wreck the airline industry
[3:23:34.160 --> 3:23:40.400]  Well, well folks, I'm sorry. That's all done. Our government is always behind the curve
[3:23:40.480 --> 3:23:46.080]  Not only our government, but we're further behind the curve than most I saw the surgeon general today
[3:23:46.880 --> 3:23:48.880]  He is still calling it
[3:23:48.880 --> 3:23:53.120]  He's still saying that the flu is worse. He looks like he's he's right out of college
[3:23:53.520 --> 3:23:58.080]  So he's probably a kind of a token kind of a guy when you see him, you'll know what I'm talking about
[3:23:58.080 --> 3:24:05.520]  He's just doing the party line. No problem. You don't need masks. If you're ordinary people, please don't buy masks
[3:24:05.520 --> 3:24:07.040]  They'll only hurt you
[3:24:07.040 --> 3:24:11.840]  But we need to save them for the medical personnel because they critically need them
[3:24:12.480 --> 3:24:19.920]  Whiskey tango foxtrot, which one is it? This is almost like Baghdad bob level of bad messaging
[3:24:20.240 --> 3:24:26.160]  And this can easily be trump's super Katrina. I even saw him a few days ago saying
[3:24:26.160 --> 3:24:30.800]  I saw Trump a few days ago saying it's just going to disappear like a miracle
[3:24:31.120 --> 3:24:37.360]  Well, when you say stuff like this, if it turns out that it's a pandemic and it has awful casualties in the USA
[3:24:38.160 --> 3:24:40.160]  They are going to play these
[3:24:40.160 --> 3:24:42.160]  clips of trump
[3:24:42.160 --> 3:24:48.160]  non-stop leading up to the election and and we're going to have the money of of bloomberg
[3:24:48.800 --> 3:24:54.720]  behind the messaging of joe biden and never meant never mind that he's a senile old fool
[3:24:54.720 --> 3:24:58.720]  He'll look like, you know, when they met package him in all these ads
[3:24:58.720 --> 3:25:05.200]  He's going to look great and trump's going to look terrible because they're going to be playing all of these trump clips saying
[3:25:05.520 --> 3:25:10.720]  Oh, the flu kills more people, you know people that still say that the flu kills more people
[3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:13.280]  They do not understand
[3:25:13.520 --> 3:25:15.200]  They do not understand
[3:25:15.200 --> 3:25:20.000]  A geometric progression compared to a linear progression
[3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:28.320]  They're like people who have never seen or heard of a tsunami and you're trying to explain to them about the water rising and falling
[3:25:28.800 --> 3:25:30.400]  and their only
[3:25:30.400 --> 3:25:37.120]  Basis for comparison is a daily like two or three foot tide where they live and you're trying to tell them
[3:25:37.280 --> 3:25:44.160]  No, it's not like that. It's way worse and they're saying. Oh come on the tide. It's nothing. It's the flu
[3:25:44.160 --> 3:25:51.360]  18,000 a year but that 18 or 40 whatever it is per year is steady like the daily tide
[3:25:51.760 --> 3:25:57.920]  What's coming is a geometric progression and those those films from iran
[3:25:58.480 --> 3:26:00.720]  That's what it's going to be like in the usa because
[3:26:01.360 --> 3:26:03.360]  We're not even like korea
[3:26:03.680 --> 3:26:09.120]  In korea people will line up for miles or in an orderly fashion
[3:26:09.120 --> 3:26:14.240]  And to buy to buy masks. Okay, and then oh probably like one or two per customer
[3:26:14.720 --> 3:26:15.840]  They're not
[3:26:15.840 --> 3:26:18.720]  Going to do that in america in america
[3:26:19.600 --> 3:26:21.840]  When people when this panic really hits
[3:26:22.480 --> 3:26:29.600]  People are not going to line up for anything. They're going to storm the local supermarket and loot it for food
[3:26:30.000 --> 3:26:34.240]  They're going to loot it for drinking water the pharmacy the gun store
[3:26:34.240 --> 3:26:41.040]  You know everything is going to be looted like that and once things are looted you can't just resupply
[3:26:41.440 --> 3:26:47.600]  So as as bad as the disease is going to be our american social chaos reaction
[3:26:48.240 --> 3:26:50.800]  is probably going to be worse because
[3:26:51.840 --> 3:26:59.600]  Whether the the the who which will get to that in the next segment the whose own numbers now are something like three and a half percent
[3:26:59.600 --> 3:27:06.960]  For the fatality rate of people who are infected harvard said 40 to 70 percent of americans
[3:27:07.280 --> 3:27:10.480]  Will be infected 40 to 70 percent
[3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:13.360]  Three and a half percent of that
[3:27:13.360 --> 3:27:19.360]  Is still millions dead. Okay, the spanish flu killed two and a half million people
[3:27:20.240 --> 3:27:24.880]  But our society at the end of world war one was very rigid traditional
[3:27:24.880 --> 3:27:28.800]  People had a high trust was a high trust society
[3:27:29.520 --> 3:27:37.200]  You know if the if the the government said everybody needs to stay inside or you know not go to ball games people did it
[3:27:37.760 --> 3:27:39.760]  That trust is gone
[3:27:40.240 --> 3:27:48.080]  A genius doctor in einstein of doctors could invent the perfect vaccine if it was completely safe the magic bullet
[3:27:48.480 --> 3:27:53.520]  It still wouldn't work because in our low trust society of 2020
[3:27:53.520 --> 3:28:00.240]  There are so many americans that have lost all trust in government that they wouldn't take a perfect vaccine
[3:28:00.720 --> 3:28:04.800]  And it might be the kind of vaccine where if one third of the population doesn't take it
[3:28:05.040 --> 3:28:10.560]  It wouldn't matter and in any event a vaccine is a minimum of a year away
[3:28:10.800 --> 3:28:14.720]  So there will be waves of this pandemic sweeping over the globe
[3:28:15.280 --> 3:28:20.720]  Mutating there's already an s version and l version, you know, they we have such good
[3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:22.720]  uh genomic uh

[3:28:31.360 --> 3:28:35.360]  Who got it what what stranded is all of this is knowable
[3:28:35.680 --> 3:28:42.960]  But what they can't do is stop it because that thing that little bump that little that little probe on the outside of the virus

[3:33:12.400 --> 3:33:16.480]  Live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide
[3:33:16.480 --> 3:33:22.560]  It's alex jones ml your host matt bracken
[3:33:26.240 --> 3:33:27.360]  All right
[3:33:27.360 --> 3:33:32.880]  coronavirus is going to take all the time that i've got and I hope people do take it seriously because
[3:33:33.680 --> 3:33:35.680]  People who I have respected in the past
[3:33:36.640 --> 3:33:39.200]  Some you know national talk show hosts and so forth
[3:33:40.560 --> 3:33:43.360]  They're still going with the flu comparison
[3:33:43.360 --> 3:33:50.480]  You know, they're still they're still you know the amity island chamber of commerce don't wreck the fourth of july festival
[3:33:51.360 --> 3:33:55.680]  Sharks are sharks are just hyped. There's no shark threat. The water is fine
[3:33:57.360 --> 3:34:00.160]  A couple of uh, you know callers back
[3:34:00.880 --> 3:34:07.280]  And and alex even said i'm going to make this guy the uh like a caller of the day and I agree with that completely
[3:34:07.760 --> 3:34:10.880]  His name might have been adam. I didn't write it down. Unfortunately
[3:34:10.880 --> 3:34:12.880]  He called he called this pandemic
[3:34:13.840 --> 3:34:15.840]  A slow motion 9 11
[3:34:16.480 --> 3:34:20.160]  You know, we've seen the first tower collapse and we can't believe it
[3:34:20.880 --> 3:34:24.880]  And we're not even prepared mentally to see the second tower collapse
[3:34:25.920 --> 3:34:30.880]  But 9 11 only affected Manhattan directly
[3:34:30.880 --> 3:34:32.880]  Yeah, there was economic spilloff
[3:34:32.880 --> 3:34:38.880]  Then we went it charging into afghanistan, which I could understand at least to get rid of al-qaq
[3:34:38.880 --> 3:34:40.880]  And in afghanistan
[3:34:40.880 --> 3:34:47.840]  Then we went charging into iraq, which was completely a mistake in my opinion as bad as saddam hussein was
[3:34:48.320 --> 3:34:51.360]  Or today as bad as asad is in syria
[3:34:52.480 --> 3:34:54.480]  It's better than being a bull in a china shop
[3:34:55.120 --> 3:35:01.520]  Just smashing everything like the u.s. Military did with good intentions. All right, of course the industrial complex
[3:35:01.520 --> 3:35:06.400]  They get their billions out of it. You know, they're so what you know, what's what's uh
[3:35:06.400 --> 3:35:10.320]  A couple 10,000 americans missing limbs traumatic brain injury
[3:35:10.640 --> 3:35:16.880]  That's a small price to pay for our global elites to make billions of dollars on war contracts
[3:35:17.280 --> 3:35:19.280]  Small price to pay, you know, we'll
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:25.440]  We'll have some specials on tv where we say we love the veterans and salute the troops
[3:35:25.920 --> 3:35:31.040]  But let's face it as bad as saddam hussein was in retrospect
[3:35:31.520 --> 3:35:33.520]  What has happened is worse
[3:35:33.520 --> 3:35:36.960]  Now not only is, you know, is iraq still in turmoil
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:46.000]  syria is in a continuing civil war flooding turkey with refugees that that that turkey is now sending straight into europe
[3:35:46.560 --> 3:35:49.440]  I mean the chaos and and destruction
[3:35:50.320 --> 3:35:54.960]  Since we got rid of saddam has been much worse than putting up with saddam
[3:35:55.680 --> 3:35:59.120]  And and to his credit trump said this all along now
[3:35:59.120 --> 3:36:05.040]  Alex talking to this caller that called this a slow-motion 9-11 even though this is a global pandemic
[3:36:05.360 --> 3:36:11.920]  He said it seems like the purpose of this is to make the planet uninhabitable for humans
[3:36:12.240 --> 3:36:19.360]  You know, this isn't a quick easy disease where you get over it and you've got an immunity and you go about your life
[3:36:19.360 --> 3:36:23.680]  You know x percent die everybody else's health is healthy
[3:36:23.680 --> 3:36:30.080]  And they've gotten immunity like spanish flu. It's done. It's over. It's in the past
[3:36:30.880 --> 3:36:32.880]  This thing keeps mutating
[3:36:33.440 --> 3:36:35.440]  It has different characteristics
[3:36:35.760 --> 3:36:40.080]  The video I showed from iran shows sick children. It shows young people falling down
[3:36:40.880 --> 3:36:42.880]  This is a real killer
[3:36:43.600 --> 3:36:49.280]  Chris martinson at peak prosperity who I watch every day every video he makes he's extremely
[3:36:49.280 --> 3:36:55.200]  Smart about this. He calls it the honey badger virus and it really upsets me
[3:36:55.920 --> 3:37:02.320]  That trump is still surrounded by you know, lackeys and sycophants and chamber of commerce types
[3:37:02.880 --> 3:37:05.760]  Who are low low balling this?
[3:37:05.760 --> 3:37:12.880]  Oh, you don't need masks because they'll only hurt you if you're an ordinary person and we need to save them for the medical personnel
[3:37:13.440 --> 3:37:15.920]  Because they're critically needed for them. Sorry
[3:37:15.920 --> 3:37:19.680]  That's bagdad bob pr and this is going to be
[3:37:20.400 --> 3:37:28.080]  Trump's Katrina if he keeps handling it this way because they're just going to annihilate him by playing back his own words
[3:37:28.880 --> 3:37:32.320]  And he'll be left saying but I didn't know how bad it would be
[3:37:32.880 --> 3:37:37.440]  Well, lots of people knew how bad it was was going to be from january on
[3:37:37.920 --> 3:37:43.040]  People with eyes to see that could understand, you know, a geometric reaction
[3:37:43.040 --> 3:37:47.920]  That could understand, you know, a geometric progression have understood this
[3:37:48.960 --> 3:37:53.200]  The author of the black swan nasim nicolas telep
[3:37:53.920 --> 3:38:01.440]  He has he's been all over this that governments just cannot react fast enough. It's like a a
[3:38:02.800 --> 3:38:11.280]  The movie um starship troopers. It's humans versus bugs giant bugs. Well, this is starship troopers on our planet
[3:38:11.280 --> 3:38:16.000]  It's the humans versus the tiny bugs and the sideshow is
[3:38:16.560 --> 3:38:22.320]  Where did the bug come from or who is who released the bug? The fact is the bug is loose
[3:38:22.960 --> 3:38:26.560]  And just like in dr. Strangelove at the point in the movie
[3:38:27.440 --> 3:38:29.840]  Where the the b-52s are flying
[3:38:30.640 --> 3:38:36.160]  And our general, uh, buck turgeson says look we can't help that, you know, that's it. That's a
[3:38:36.160 --> 3:38:41.920]  A, uh, an unhappy incidence, but we've got to now make the best advantage for america
[3:38:42.480 --> 3:38:48.720]  I am guaranteeing you that the very evil way more evil than our american generals and dr. Strangelove
[3:38:49.280 --> 3:38:52.560]  The chinese generals are saying, you know, uh
[3:38:53.440 --> 3:38:55.440]  chairman chairman lee
[3:38:56.240 --> 3:39:00.800]  This might not be the worst thing that ever happened because we've done the calculations
[3:39:01.360 --> 3:39:02.880]  And we can lose
[3:39:02.880 --> 3:39:04.880]  500 million people
[3:39:04.880 --> 3:39:09.280]  And we can still win because the rest of the world will be
[3:39:10.400 --> 3:39:16.960]  Depopulated, you know, china has basically bought africa. Let's say it's a fact
[3:39:17.920 --> 3:39:22.160]  There are african countries that have sovereignty in name only
[3:39:22.880 --> 3:39:31.440]  Their leaders have been bought off. They've got, you know, millions and billions in swiss bank accounts and the chinese own their countries
[3:39:31.440 --> 3:39:36.640]  These countries under their corrupt leadership bribed and bought by the china chinese
[3:39:37.040 --> 3:39:43.520]  These african countries and not only africa also in south america and other places, but primarily in africa
[3:39:44.480 --> 3:39:46.480]  These countries have signed contracts
[3:39:47.120 --> 3:39:51.280]  To pay to pay back loans to china that are impossible to pay
[3:39:51.760 --> 3:39:57.760]  And i'm and it's not like america was perfect in this regard with our, you know, era of band capitalism
[3:39:57.760 --> 3:40:03.520]  But this is leveraged to put china in control of ownership of these countries
[3:40:04.160 --> 3:40:09.120]  And when this gets loose in africa, africa is going to be depopulated
[3:40:09.360 --> 3:40:12.080]  I mean, i'm worried about the united states of america
[3:40:12.480 --> 3:40:17.520]  We have we have a leadership that is still in denial either in denial
[3:40:17.840 --> 3:40:24.080]  Or they're trying to like, you know, on the side quietly warning their own family warning their elite network
[3:40:24.080 --> 3:40:31.200]  Get ready horde food because this is a killer. Meanwhile, they go on television. You don't need a face mask
[3:40:31.600 --> 3:40:39.120]  Everything's great. Don't worry. This is like people in the titanic saying to the to the ordinary people down in steerage
[3:40:39.600 --> 3:40:43.760]  Don't panic because they want a place in the lifeboat. All right, so
[3:40:44.720 --> 3:40:46.720]  if china
[3:40:46.720 --> 3:40:48.320]  ends up
[3:40:48.320 --> 3:40:50.320]  The winner of this
[3:40:50.320 --> 3:40:53.920]  It could be a chinese world in a century
[3:40:54.160 --> 3:40:58.880]  And i'm not saying that's going to happen, but i am telling you at the very top level
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:05.120]  Like in the movie dr. Strangelove, but that was, you know, b52 is going 500 miles an hour
[3:41:05.840 --> 3:41:08.480]  You know in a very short compressed time frame
[3:41:09.280 --> 3:41:12.000]  This is a slow motion dr. Strangelove
[3:41:12.560 --> 3:41:18.400]  The missiles are flying, but the missiles are these coronavirus bugs. He's mutating
[3:41:18.400 --> 3:41:20.400]  coronavirus bugs and
[3:41:21.200 --> 3:41:24.400]  How this is going to end up in five or ten years?
[3:41:24.880 --> 3:41:28.000]  Nobody knows, but one thing that i can tell you for sure
[3:41:28.560 --> 3:41:32.880]  If you are still listening to american government and mainstream media
[3:41:33.840 --> 3:41:35.840]  Like that surgeon general buffoon
[3:41:36.480 --> 3:41:39.520]  If you are still listening to them and taking them seriously
[3:41:39.920 --> 3:41:44.800]  All i can say is you're like a poor steerage class person down in the titanic
[3:41:44.800 --> 3:41:50.000]  That here's the here's the crew say don't worry. You don't need a life jacket
[3:41:50.880 --> 3:41:52.880]  This ship is unsinkable
[3:41:52.960 --> 3:41:54.320]  meanwhile
[3:41:54.320 --> 3:41:57.680]  The crew is all hoarding the life jackets and heading for the lifeboats
[3:41:58.160 --> 3:42:03.200]  Because in this case there aren't enough lifeboat seats for the passengers
[3:42:03.280 --> 3:42:06.640]  I guarantee you that and when we come back on the other half
[3:42:06.960 --> 3:42:12.960]  On after the break i'm going to i'm going to talk about the medical consequences in the united states
[3:42:12.960 --> 3:42:18.560]  How this is going to affect medical staff and people who are going to start having to make decisions
[3:42:19.280 --> 3:42:26.640]  Do i just keep going to work and probably get infected or do i start self quarantining now my government's never going to tell me that
[3:42:27.040 --> 3:42:30.080]  They're saying there's no sharks in amity in amity island

[3:44:01.840 --> 3:44:06.000]  They're trying to silence free speech. They're trying to trigger riots in the streets

[3:45:29.680 --> 3:45:33.520]  In which we're trying to help equip people to think about these great events in the world
[3:45:33.680 --> 3:45:37.600]  One of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself
[3:45:37.680 --> 3:45:44.160]  Remembering that our lives are a gift from god that he intends us to use for good purpose
[3:45:44.160 --> 3:45:51.760]  For our families and for our communities and right now folks who are willing to think like we do are critical to the future of America
[3:45:51.920 --> 3:45:56.880]  Everybody's calling me. I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family

[3:46:10.640 --> 3:46:16.560]  But I would encourage listeners to do the most important thing and that's drink purified water. That's pray. That's get focused

[3:46:51.520 --> 3:47:05.600]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:05.600 --> 3:47:24.400]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 it's matt bracken you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:29.040 --> 3:47:30.640]  You know for the last
[3:47:30.640 --> 3:47:37.600]  Of 15 or so years i've been writing dystopian fiction and in my novels we have a lot of you know
[3:47:38.320 --> 3:47:44.640]  Really difficult problems bad outcomes and and i wrote them so that people would pay attention to me when it really mattered
[3:47:44.640 --> 3:47:46.640]  That's why i wrote them that was my motivation
[3:47:47.440 --> 3:47:49.920]  When it really counts i'll have some credibility
[3:47:50.400 --> 3:47:51.440]  all right
[3:47:51.440 --> 3:47:53.120]  and
[3:47:53.120 --> 3:47:55.840]  In my novels there wasn't something as dangerous
[3:47:55.840 --> 3:48:00.560]  As an asymptomatic spreader of a virus
[3:48:01.040 --> 3:48:06.240]  Who could you know be a child that won't be affected that brings it home and and infects his parents
[3:48:07.200 --> 3:48:11.600]  Who die i mean this is this is that something it can get on an airplane
[3:48:12.080 --> 3:48:14.080]  Nobody's coughing nobody's sniffling
[3:48:14.640 --> 3:48:16.800]  And half the people on the airplane are infected
[3:48:17.520 --> 3:48:19.520]  This is like another order of magnitude
[3:48:20.240 --> 3:48:22.240]  You know that that that movie
[3:48:22.240 --> 3:48:25.200]  The starship troopers with the bugs
[3:48:26.080 --> 3:48:28.080]  At least you could see those bugs
[3:48:28.400 --> 3:48:30.400]  And they were fighting on other planets
[3:48:30.880 --> 3:48:32.800]  This is our home planet
[3:48:32.800 --> 3:48:34.800]  And the bug is too small to see
[3:48:35.280 --> 3:48:40.720]  And not only that our own generals are saying there's no bug problem
[3:48:41.600 --> 3:48:44.720]  The old flu bug is worse than this invisible bug
[3:48:45.840 --> 3:48:49.680]  It just it blows my mind it really does you know
[3:48:49.680 --> 3:48:56.160]  We're still if you put on the news in this country
[3:48:56.880 --> 3:49:00.320]  They're still covering the election okay bloomberg's out
[3:49:00.960 --> 3:49:02.480]  Warren is out
[3:49:02.480 --> 3:49:05.280]  You know biden is the man even though he's got dementia
[3:49:06.080 --> 3:49:09.680]  As if everything that's happening outside of america
[3:49:10.320 --> 3:49:13.920]  Isn't going to affect what's happening inside of america
[3:49:14.320 --> 3:49:18.320]  I don't understand people how they can be so myopic how they can channelize
[3:49:18.320 --> 3:49:22.000]  Is they're thinking oh it's terrible what happened in china
[3:49:22.480 --> 3:49:26.640]  It's terrible what's spreading to like you know 70 other countries half of the world
[3:49:27.120 --> 3:49:28.640]  That we know of
[3:49:28.640 --> 3:49:33.760]  It's you know it's terrible those iran things look at those morgues in iran, but those are iranians
[3:49:33.840 --> 3:49:39.040]  They're dumb they believe you know they they kiss shrines that could never happen in america
[3:49:39.520 --> 3:49:44.400]  Hello folks you know what happens in america when the ebt system goes down for an hour
[3:49:44.400 --> 3:49:50.640]  You know it'll be at least as bad in america because our stores will be looted
[3:49:51.760 --> 3:49:53.760]  And we're at a point now
[3:49:54.800 --> 3:49:56.800]  Strategically thinking where
[3:49:57.120 --> 3:50:03.840]  The long term the long view where the generals are thinking long view and the and generals what they do is come up with
[3:50:04.400 --> 3:50:06.400]  contingency planning
[3:50:06.400 --> 3:50:09.600]  And one of the contingencies the generals are thinking about
[3:50:09.600 --> 3:50:17.600]  Even in pc america they probably would never dare say it aloud or write it down because if the if this pandemic fizzles out
[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:24.880]  And somebody records or you know two years from now. They're afraid. Whoa boy. If I ever wrote this memo
[3:50:25.680 --> 3:50:28.480]  I would be I would be shafted destroyed
[3:50:28.960 --> 3:50:32.400]  So they won't even say it so so pc is working against us
[3:50:32.720 --> 3:50:38.960]  Do you think that in china the generals aren't having frank discussions about just like dr. Strangelove?
[3:50:38.960 --> 3:50:43.440]  Okay, the b-52 wing. It's off. You know the bombs are going to drop
[3:50:44.160 --> 3:50:46.160]  How do we deal with it now?
[3:50:46.320 --> 3:50:49.680]  That's the pandemic world war. We're in now
[3:50:50.400 --> 3:50:52.400]  and in this in this sense
[3:50:53.360 --> 3:50:57.120]  The failure is if you have your hospitals overrun
[3:50:58.000 --> 3:51:01.520]  And everything gets out of control your stores are looted
[3:51:02.400 --> 3:51:07.520]  And you know you're on a short a short count from there to you know just total chaos
[3:51:07.520 --> 3:51:09.520]  Anarchy cannibalism
[3:51:10.480 --> 3:51:15.040]  I guarantee you we have the bullets have a much longer shelf life than food
[3:51:15.520 --> 3:51:19.280]  And there are probably as many bullets as cans of food in this country
[3:51:19.920 --> 3:51:26.160]  When the supermarkets are looted people will still be running around with guns and that does not pretend well for the future
[3:51:27.360 --> 3:51:32.480]  So in this context to the chinese communist party truly evil men
[3:51:32.480 --> 3:51:37.600]  You know they look at Mao and can still he's pictures still up there and you know at
[3:51:38.400 --> 3:51:42.160]  At the square in china his pictures there after Tiananmen Square
[3:51:42.720 --> 3:51:46.720]  Mao oversaw the death of probably 60 to 80 million chinese
[3:51:47.440 --> 3:51:50.240]  Small price to pay for communism. They don't care
[3:51:50.880 --> 3:51:55.280]  So to them to the chinese generals that are running their show
[3:51:56.560 --> 3:51:58.560]  If they survive
[3:51:58.800 --> 3:52:00.800]  And we totally collapse
[3:52:00.800 --> 3:52:06.160]  They win do you understand that if if america goes like iran
[3:52:06.800 --> 3:52:09.760]  Except iran where every house has a gun
[3:52:10.560 --> 3:52:12.560]  And more bullets than food
[3:52:12.800 --> 3:52:15.200]  That america wipes itself out
[3:52:15.760 --> 3:52:22.160]  You know will be so wounded it won't be a factor if they can maintain their rigid hierarchical
[3:52:22.720 --> 3:52:24.720]  You know forced quarantine
[3:52:24.800 --> 3:52:29.920]  Where you either quarantine or you wind up in a quarantine camp where nobody comes back
[3:52:29.920 --> 3:52:36.160]  You know, that's how you keep a quarantine in china. The quarantine means you either quarantine
[3:52:36.720 --> 3:52:39.200]  Or we take you away and you're never going to be seen again
[3:52:39.760 --> 3:52:45.840]  Do you think that can work in america? What if the key element to surviving this coronavirus?
[3:52:46.400 --> 3:52:47.520]  bug
[3:52:47.520 --> 3:52:52.240]  World war. What if the key factor is this social isolation?
[3:52:52.800 --> 3:52:57.440]  Then you're in a situation where your economy is dialed down to almost zero
[3:52:57.440 --> 3:53:03.840]  There's no industrial output. Nobody's going to school. Like in japan, korea, iran, iran
[3:53:04.560 --> 3:53:09.520]  Italy no school. Okay, that means kids are home. That means mom doesn't go to work
[3:53:10.000 --> 3:53:15.040]  And people are afraid to go to work. They're afraid of being infected and they're being told to self quarantine
[3:53:15.280 --> 3:53:21.600]  So our economies start dialing down screw the stock market. You know, we're talking about will there be enough food
[3:53:22.160 --> 3:53:24.720]  You know chris martins and overt peak prosperity
[3:53:24.720 --> 3:53:28.800]  He calls it this balancing act. You've got these three elements
[3:53:29.840 --> 3:53:34.800]  You've got to get the r not number below one with an r not number above one
[3:53:36.400 --> 3:53:39.680]  It's still spreading if it's below one it starts diminishing
[3:53:40.240 --> 3:53:46.160]  But if you do that like china you have no economy and the economy starts dialing down to zero
[3:53:46.880 --> 3:53:52.160]  And in between them you you can't have your hospitals overrun if your hospitals were overrun
[3:53:52.160 --> 3:53:58.000]  And they look like you know an iranian morgue if that's your below you one story below the hospital
[3:53:58.240 --> 3:54:00.240]  How do you think that hospital is doing next week?
[3:54:00.480 --> 3:54:06.400]  Because what happens when the hospital staff and this is probably starting in washington state and working out from there
[3:54:06.800 --> 3:54:10.080]  What happens when the hospital staff become infected?
[3:54:10.640 --> 3:54:15.360]  Or they're working double shifts and they start having mistakes with their PPEs
[3:54:16.000 --> 3:54:20.320]  Or or they have nervous breakdowns. They're exhausted. They can't work anymore
[3:54:20.320 --> 3:54:24.560]  They go home after their triple shift and they never come back to the hospital
[3:54:24.880 --> 3:54:31.920]  That's the hospital being overrun scenario. So china in this strategy of this pandemic world war
[3:54:32.560 --> 3:54:34.560]  china's strategy is
[3:54:34.720 --> 3:54:36.720]  Survive no matter what it takes
[3:54:37.280 --> 3:54:42.800]  Anybody suspected quarantine camp wuhan city quarantine dead. We don't care
[3:54:43.280 --> 3:54:47.600]  This this the strategy for china is we survive
[3:54:47.600 --> 3:54:53.520]  The rest of the world dies. That's china's dr. strange love strategy
[3:54:54.240 --> 3:55:00.160]  And we're still in the bag dad bob phase with a buffoon surgeon general
[3:55:00.720 --> 3:55:05.360]  Saying don't buy masks because they don't work for you. You ordinary civilian
[3:55:05.920 --> 3:55:10.000]  And we need them critically for our medical people. Well, which is it?
[3:55:10.800 --> 3:55:14.880]  I mean, this is this is a a very serious situation. We're in
[3:55:14.880 --> 3:55:22.480]  I hope it peters out. I don't want to inflict this on anybody. I don't want my children to suffer this your children anybody
[3:55:23.040 --> 3:55:26.160]  You know, I'm over 60. So theoretically I'm in the more at risk
[3:55:26.640 --> 3:55:30.080]  There are probably people out there saying great the boomers will all die
[3:55:30.640 --> 3:55:33.360]  But that's just the disease effect
[3:55:34.080 --> 3:55:40.240]  The knock-on effects socially are going to be looted supermarkets looted pharmacies
[3:55:40.560 --> 3:55:43.200]  looted liquor stores looted gun stores
[3:55:43.200 --> 3:55:48.400]  And that's it folks. Then we look like what I've been saying worst case
[3:55:48.880 --> 3:55:52.640]  And now I've got to think of a new worst case like instead of squared cubed
[3:55:53.120 --> 3:55:56.480]  I've been saying rwanda times bosnia
[3:55:57.200 --> 3:56:01.920]  Well, this is going to be rwanda times bosnia during a pandemic in america
[3:56:02.640 --> 3:56:05.200]  How will you how will you let your friends into your house?
[3:56:05.600 --> 3:56:08.720]  How you know your relatives from far away that are coming and need help
[3:56:08.720 --> 3:56:15.360]  How can you afford to let them in your house if you're on quarantine and they might be bringing a bug even though they appear completely healthy
[3:56:17.120 --> 3:56:24.160]  This is this is a really serious situation folks. I hope I'm wrong. I hope that in a month everybody's laughing at me and mocking me
[3:56:24.480 --> 3:56:27.920]  Oh boy. Bracken went off the deep end. This is like a total joke
[3:56:29.120 --> 3:56:30.640]  But it's real
[3:56:30.640 --> 3:56:32.640]  it's very real
[3:56:32.800 --> 3:56:34.800]  And week by week we're going to see this
[3:56:35.440 --> 3:56:37.200]  the difference between
[3:56:37.200 --> 3:56:38.480]  china
[3:56:38.480 --> 3:56:39.760]  and iran
[3:56:39.760 --> 3:56:41.200]  and italy
[3:56:41.200 --> 3:56:44.240]  And washington state is just time
[3:56:44.880 --> 3:56:46.880]  There's no more containment
[3:56:47.440 --> 3:56:49.440]  Containment is done
[3:56:49.840 --> 3:56:53.600]  This bug travels for up to you know, three weeks or more
[3:56:54.240 --> 3:56:59.120]  asymptomatically while spreading. So there's no such thing as containment at this point
[3:56:59.120 --> 3:57:06.480]  There's only social distancing. Yeah, the hand washing the masks and here's a tip. Nobody has yet said i'm wrong
[3:57:07.200 --> 3:57:13.520]  The key to a mask an n95 mask is what's called hepa hepa cloth
[3:57:14.080 --> 3:57:20.880]  It's the n95 is big enough or the pores are small enough to stop a virus floating on
[3:57:21.520 --> 3:57:23.520]  a spit particle, okay, and
[3:57:23.520 --> 3:57:30.400]  And vacuum cleaner bags that say hepa or any air conditioning filters things that say hepa
[3:57:31.040 --> 3:57:34.640]  That's the key. That's the n95 right there hepa
[3:57:34.640 --> 3:57:52.800]  Next week. I hope i'm uh, we're all laughing at me next week. I hope
