[00:00.000 --> 00:26.280]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[00:26.280 --> 00:29.120]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday Live Edition.
[00:29.120 --> 00:33.600]  I'm David Knight, your host. Alex Jones is going to be joining us at the bottom of the
[00:33.600 --> 00:39.200]  hour with a special report. Of course, you've probably seen this video about, it's up on
[00:39.200 --> 00:45.200]  Infowars.com, about the barbecue police coming in and grilling their neighbors over the smoke.
[00:45.200 --> 00:51.120]  There's a lot more to it than just that. This is something that has a very, very broad agenda.
[00:51.120 --> 00:57.360]  Agenda 21 is part of it. We've also seen other aspects. We've seen movements in Austin to get
[00:57.360 --> 01:03.520]  rid of barbecue. The famous Franklin barbecue here in Austin, the Austin City Council would like
[01:03.520 --> 01:08.240]  to essentially shut them down because they said, we certainly can't, as well as they do. And I mean,
[01:08.240 --> 01:13.440]  people line up at this barbecue. I've never been able to eat there. I've been here for
[01:13.440 --> 01:18.000]  over three years. I've never been able to actually get into the restaurant and never have the time
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.600]  to go through the line or they run out of food. This famous barbecue said, they can't comply with
[01:23.600 --> 01:28.880]  these regulations. Certainly, the smaller restaurants can't comply with it. It is over the top.
[01:28.880 --> 01:33.040]  We're seeing wood stoves being banned. We're seeing barbecue being banned. And of course,
[01:33.040 --> 01:40.160]  there's the war on coal. We have an article on Infowars.com about a coal executive, Murray Energy,
[01:40.160 --> 01:46.960]  CEO Robert Murray, talking about how the president is trying to destroy not only the coal industry,
[01:46.960 --> 01:51.920]  but the United States as well. He has some spot on comments. We're going to cover that as well.
[01:51.920 --> 01:58.000]  It's an amazing day. As I said in news, there's articles about what is being done to our children.
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.720]  You will not believe this article up on Infowars.com, an anti-bullying conference where middle
[02:02.720 --> 02:10.080]  schoolers learn about lesbian strap-on anal sex and fake testicles. This is just amazing.
[02:10.080 --> 02:15.040]  We're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about pre-crime being extended to
[02:15.040 --> 02:23.040]  kindergartners. This is all part of the government's vast surveillance state that they're putting in
[02:23.040 --> 02:28.320]  place. It's one of the things that should concern everyone about the Jade Helm exercise. It's part
[02:28.320 --> 02:33.920]  of that continuum. It's a very dangerous part of that continuum, especially when you look at what's
[02:33.920 --> 02:39.920]  going on in the UK. Just three days ago, we see that Theresa May, the home secretary in the UK,
[02:39.920 --> 02:44.880]  emphatically rejected the use of water cannons in England and Wales. She had some very strong
[02:44.880 --> 02:50.720]  statements to talk about how they did not want the UK police to hide behind military-style
[02:50.720 --> 02:55.760]  equipment and tactics. But then just three days later, this story at Infowars.com,
[02:55.760 --> 03:00.880]  secret plan for soldiers to fight terror in the UK. This is coming out of Sky News.
[03:01.680 --> 03:06.000]  Just three days after she says we're not going to have militarized police. Don't worry. You can
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.200]  trust us. We're going to protect your freedoms. We want to have consensual police. We don't want
[03:11.200 --> 03:16.320]  to hide behind the military. Now they're talking about how they've already put in place a plan to
[03:16.320 --> 03:22.560]  put up to 5,000 soldiers immediately out if there is some kind of a terror attack. How many people
[03:22.560 --> 03:28.640]  would say, great. I'd like to see that. You need to understand how this is all playing out. You need
[03:28.640 --> 03:34.720]  to understand this in the full context of the surveillance state in terms of grabbing everyone's
[03:34.720 --> 03:40.880]  information, in terms of profiling people, not just down to regional groups, not just down to
[03:40.880 --> 03:47.360]  targeting a specific building or a specific vehicle, but targeting individuals. We have a
[03:48.240 --> 03:53.520]  revelation about the future of war coming from a military think tank sponsored by the Department
[03:53.520 --> 03:59.120]  of Defense. But of course, those things are already here. They're already looking at individuals.
[03:59.120 --> 04:04.080]  We've got Wesley Clark talking about internment camps, saying you got a right to be disloyal
[04:04.080 --> 04:08.640]  and criticize the government, but we're going to lock you up for that. At the same time, of course,
[04:08.640 --> 04:14.320]  Wesley Clark is a former candidate for president with the Democrat Party. We've also got the
[04:14.320 --> 04:18.560]  Republicans joining in. Of course, they love the war on terror. They love the surveillance state.
[04:18.560 --> 04:23.920]  We've got Mike McCall at the same time. Wesley Clark is floating this idea that anyone who is
[04:23.920 --> 04:27.440]  disloyal, of course, you've got a right to say whatever you want to. He said, but we've got a
[04:27.440 --> 04:32.880]  right to lock you up, to segregate you as he euphemistically calls it. At the same time,
[04:32.880 --> 04:39.040]  we've got Mike McCall creating a new division of Homeland Security to be funded by FEMA that is
[04:39.040 --> 04:44.880]  going to identify individuals before they do anything. This is all part of pre crime. Everything
[04:44.880 --> 04:49.440]  you do now, everything you do on social media, everything you do going into kindergarten, every
[04:49.440 --> 04:52.960]  institution, they're going to look at what you're doing. Stay with us. We're going to break these
[04:52.960 --> 05:02.960]  down in detail after the break. A clean, toxic free body is the foundation of true health. Introducing
[05:02.960 --> 05:08.560]  deep cleanse by infowarslife.com, a scientifically formulated blend of nanocoloidal zeolites and

[06:14.240 --> 06:28.720]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Sunday. I'm David Knight, your host. Alex Jones is going
[06:28.720 --> 06:34.480]  to be joining us at the end of the hour with a report. I'm here live. We'll possibly take your
[06:34.480 --> 06:41.120]  calls also later in the program. Of course, today we see something in a special Sunday session that
[06:41.120 --> 06:45.840]  Rand Paul is trying to do. We've all seen the videos. I'm presumed you've seen the videos by
[06:45.840 --> 06:51.600]  now. You've probably taken one position or the other on this. It's pretty amazing to see Planned
[06:51.600 --> 06:58.480]  Parenthood talking about profiting from baby parts at the same time saying that, well, their
[06:58.480 --> 07:05.520]  tissue, their fetuses, no, their baby body parts that they're selling for money. Many of us have
[07:05.520 --> 07:12.400]  had enough of this. It's repulsive. It's immoral. It should be illegal, but it is funded by our
[07:12.400 --> 07:16.880]  government. Rand Paul is going to try to block this today in a special Sunday session. This is an
[07:16.880 --> 07:23.360]  article on infowars.com. Paul is going to try to block Planned Parenthood funding during a rare Sunday
[07:23.360 --> 07:27.440]  voting session. He says, I really think the time has come in our country to have a debate on whether
[07:27.440 --> 07:32.720]  taxpayer money should be spent on this. And of course, this is something in terms of how it's
[07:32.720 --> 07:38.400]  going to work. I'm not really sure. It's a long shot legislative maneuver. Fox News said he's
[07:38.400 --> 07:44.160]  going to try to submit a discharge position to force the vote when senators return today in
[07:44.160 --> 07:50.640]  Washington to vote on a transportation and transit funding bill set to expire in a few days. So
[07:50.640 --> 07:56.240]  we'll see what happens. I certainly appreciate him trying to do something about this. We've got
[07:56.240 --> 08:02.640]  other presidential news as well. Hillary Clinton has got a lot of news about her emails that broke
[08:02.640 --> 08:11.520]  on at the end of the week. Also, we've had some comments from Donald Trump about the report that
[08:12.240 --> 08:18.720]  Josh Owens and Joe Biggs filmed at the border showing drug smugglers coming across the border.
[08:18.720 --> 08:22.880]  He talked about that in Iowa. Now a lot of people are talking about that. A lot of them
[08:22.880 --> 08:28.560]  are very skillfully avoiding mentioning info wars. Some of them do like the Daily Caller.
[08:29.280 --> 08:32.560]  But we're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about his comments. And I want to talk
[08:32.560 --> 08:38.720]  a little bit about what the real solution might be. Maybe want to take a look at what the real
[08:38.720 --> 08:45.280]  problem is in terms of uncontrolled immigration. This is not something that is just involving
[08:45.280 --> 08:49.680]  people coming from one particular country. People are coming in from all different countries.
[08:49.680 --> 08:54.880]  I want to get to that, but I want to run down the headline news here that's happening today.
[08:54.880 --> 09:04.400]  We've got more information about this Sandra Bland case here in Texas. The person who reportedly
[09:04.400 --> 09:10.880]  committed suicide after being arrested for a very minor traffic offense, not using her turn signal.
[09:11.600 --> 09:18.080]  And of course, if you've seen the reports that we have at info wars.com on our YouTube channel,
[09:18.080 --> 09:24.160]  you can see that we've got, I can't remember the guy's name. What's the guy's name, CJ,
[09:24.960 --> 09:27.680]  that does the reports about how to handle police encounters.
[09:29.680 --> 09:32.160]  Anyway, we'll get that name for you. But you can see the report there.
[09:32.160 --> 09:32.720]  Larry Craig.
[09:32.720 --> 09:37.760]  Larry Craig. Thank you so much. Larry Craig talks about how to handle a police encounter. And he
[09:37.760 --> 09:41.360]  makes a very interesting point. He says, when the police pull you over most of the time,
[09:41.360 --> 09:44.720]  of course, they're looking for revenue, traffic revenue, and that sort of thing. Most of the
[09:44.720 --> 09:49.760]  time they really want to try to get you on some kind of a drug offense. That's really where the
[09:49.760 --> 09:56.000]  money is. And so this cop was very intent on getting her out of the car. She got very angry.
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.480]  She was arrested. She spent three days in jail. Then they said she committed suicide by hanging
[10:00.480 --> 10:06.320]  herself with some garbage bags tied together. That looks suspicious enough. Now it gets even
[10:06.320 --> 10:11.120]  more suspicious to try to cover this up because a lot of people are not buying that story. It
[10:11.120 --> 10:14.960]  doesn't sound very plausible. Now they come up with something else to try to make it sound
[10:15.920 --> 10:20.320]  more plausible, but it does just the opposite. Now they're telling us that it is some kind of a
[10:20.320 --> 10:27.440]  reefer madness that caused her to commit suicide. They say that she had a massive amount of marijuana
[10:28.000 --> 10:34.640]  that she smoked in jail. Remember, she's been there three days. They admitted her into jail.
[10:34.640 --> 10:39.280]  She didn't come into the jail with the marijuana. They would have checked her for that. But she's
[10:39.280 --> 10:44.480]  been there three days. Then she hangs herself. Then they say she's consumed a massive amount of
[10:44.480 --> 10:51.360]  marijuana just before she hung herself. How does that get them off the hook? I really don't
[10:51.360 --> 10:56.000]  understand. They say looking at the autopsy results and toxicology, it appears that she swallowed a
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.880]  large quantity of marijuana or smoked it in jail and they didn't happen to notice either of those
[11:00.880 --> 11:10.800]  things. Stuff like this does happen in jail. It I think underscores that we cannot stop drug use
[11:10.800 --> 11:16.240]  by incarcerating people. We have a lot of people in federal prison who die of drug overdoses every
[11:16.240 --> 11:22.560]  year because you can't stop people from using it even if you lock them up. So what kind of a
[11:22.560 --> 11:27.680]  society are we creating for ourselves when we try to stop drug use, when we try to stop vice
[11:27.680 --> 11:34.480]  by use of a militarized police force? It simply doesn't work. But I don't believe that's the
[11:34.480 --> 11:40.400]  situation in this particular case. They say, and this is the report from Mint Press in terms
[11:40.400 --> 11:44.080]  of summarizing it, they say the officer seemed to be more interested in searching bland in her
[11:44.080 --> 11:48.880]  vehicle. He indicated he would let her go with a warning, but he wanted her out of her vehicle
[11:48.880 --> 11:55.200]  to do a search. Things turned ugly when she asserted her rights and refused to consent to the
[11:55.200 --> 12:01.920]  search or to put out her cigarette. You do have a right to refuse a search. When you're pulled over,
[12:01.920 --> 12:06.800]  you are under arrest. You're under custodial arrest. That has been proven over and over again
[12:06.800 --> 12:13.600]  and ruled on by the courts. I know that when we got arrested at AP Hill, Joe Biggs and I,
[12:14.320 --> 12:17.920]  the guy cynically said, no, no, you're not under arrest. And so when they were free to go, no,
[12:17.920 --> 12:23.840]  you can't go. They know that they won't call it an arrest. They'll play semantic games with you.
[12:23.840 --> 12:32.160]  But this is absolutely amazing that they would now try to push this onto reefer madness. But
[12:32.160 --> 12:40.480]  we're seeing this happen everywhere. Even when they prosecute police officers for excessive force,
[12:40.480 --> 12:45.520]  for wrongful death, they get a slap on the wrist. Look at the situation here in LA.
[12:46.160 --> 12:52.640]  A former veteran LA police department officer sentenced to beating a handcuffed woman who
[12:52.640 --> 12:59.840]  later died. She gets off with 20 months, 20 months, which means that she's only going to
[12:59.840 --> 13:04.000]  serve 16 months in county jail. She's going to get credit for three months that she's already
[13:04.560 --> 13:12.320]  been in jail. She kicked, she shoved, she beat a woman who was handcuffed. And that's all she's
[13:12.320 --> 13:21.040]  going to get. Undercover of law. Why do we allow that to happen? Changing gears quickly here,
[13:21.040 --> 13:24.720]  getting onto the presidential campaigns. Bernie Sanders, of course, is one of these candidates
[13:24.720 --> 13:29.920]  who's been rising in the polls because compared to Hillary Clinton, he looks very authentic.
[13:29.920 --> 13:35.680]  He looks, he comes across as a very genuine, authentic guy. Look at this article, however.
[13:35.680 --> 13:40.240]  He's demanding $15 per hour minimum wage. He's just introduced a bill to do that. Yet he pays
[13:40.240 --> 13:47.440]  his own interns $12 an hour. So you're going to make it a law, but you're not going to do that.
[13:47.440 --> 13:53.600]  It's simply perception folks. It's simply perception for all these folks that are doing this.
[13:53.600 --> 13:58.880]  Hillary Clinton, of course, had a press conference where she's talking about the
[13:59.600 --> 14:04.480]  newest report from the inspector general looking at whether or not she was using
[14:04.480 --> 14:11.280]  sending classified emails from her personal account. And she said, I am confident that I
[14:11.280 --> 14:17.920]  never sent or received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received.
[14:17.920 --> 14:24.320]  I heard her say this going past the mainstream monitors that we have throughout the infowars
[14:24.320 --> 14:32.080]  area here. I heard her saying that and it was just deja vu all over again. It was Bill Clinton
[14:32.640 --> 14:40.160]  saying, I did not have text with those people. No textual relations here whatsoever. So she's
[14:40.160 --> 14:45.680]  saying and again, parsing the semantics of all of this. I'm confident that I never sent or received
[14:45.680 --> 14:51.760]  any information that was classified at the time it was sent or received. What I think you're seeing
[14:51.760 --> 14:57.280]  here is very typical kind of discussion to some extent disagreement among various parts of the
[14:57.280 --> 15:02.320]  government over what should or should not be publicly released. Well, she's got her own private
[15:02.320 --> 15:07.920]  server that she's keeping this on. Now they found at least four emails from that private server
[15:07.920 --> 15:12.160]  account that she used while she was Secretary of State that had classified information on it.
[15:12.160 --> 15:17.040]  That's what the Inspector General Charles McCullough said. He oversees intelligence
[15:17.040 --> 15:22.960]  agencies and that's what he told members of Congress on a letter on Thursday. Guys,
[15:22.960 --> 15:27.520]  do you have that clip of Hillary Clinton ready? Yeah, let's play that clip of Clinton. I want
[15:27.520 --> 15:36.160]  you to hear the tone of her voice. First, I want to say a word about what's in the news today.
[15:36.160 --> 15:47.520]  It's because there have been a lot of inaccuracies as Congressman Cummings made clear this morning.
[15:48.480 --> 15:56.400]  Maybe the heat is getting to everybody. We all have a responsibility to get this right.
[15:56.400 --> 16:00.560]  I have released. Yeah, we're going to come right back. We're going to talk about that. They said
[16:00.560 --> 16:07.440]  using secret 12, the new info wars life vitamin B12 formulation. Secret 12 is a binary of
[16:07.440 --> 16:12.960]  nutrimentical grade bio available co enzyme forms of B12, methylcobalamin, the same kind
[16:12.960 --> 16:18.560]  used in B12 injections and adenosylcobalamin. Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth right on the
[16:18.560 --> 16:24.400]  tongue and then swallowed no needles, no injections. Secure your revolutionary secret 12 formula

[20:27.120 --> 20:34.560]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm your host today David Knight
[20:35.440 --> 20:42.000]  Alex is going to have a special report if you've seen the article that's up on info wars.com of the
[20:42.000 --> 20:47.840]  barbecue police coming around and telling people to watch their smoke or they're going to have to
[20:47.840 --> 20:53.600]  report them it's absolutely an amazing exchange you may find it hard to believe but this is something
[20:53.600 --> 20:59.280]  that is happening everywhere it's part of a much much broader agenda it's all tied into agenda 21
[20:59.280 --> 21:03.600]  Alex Jones has a special report we're going to air at the end of this hour that's going to broaden
[21:03.600 --> 21:09.440]  that out to put that in the proper context so you really understand that there's more than just
[21:09.440 --> 21:14.880]  some little petty bureaucrat here bullying somebody like a crossing guard at a elementary school
[21:14.880 --> 21:20.160]  okay it's much more to that and that's going to be in a special report at the end of this hour
[21:20.160 --> 21:25.520]  of course this hour of Alex Jones is show is going to be brought to you by deep cleanse this is our
[21:25.520 --> 21:31.200]  newest flagship product something we just got in at info wars life.com deep cleanse is an all in one
[21:31.200 --> 21:35.840]  total body cleanser that uses nano colloidal zeolites think of those really kind of as

[21:55.440 --> 22:01.120]  for the lowest prices while supplies last because it seems like every time we get a new product in
[22:01.120 --> 22:05.760]  it immediately sells out and I don't know how much they've got left but of course right now through
[22:05.760 --> 22:10.880]  the end of July there is free shipping at info wars life.com we've already sold out about 85
[22:10.880 --> 22:16.080]  percent of this first run it'll be months before our next shipment arrives that's just what they
[22:16.080 --> 22:20.160]  told me so that's how much we sold out we sold out about half of it the first day now it's up to
[22:20.160 --> 22:26.160]  about 85 percent you can get that again at info wars life.com that's our newest flagship product
[22:26.160 --> 22:31.120]  deep cleanse and just before we went to the break we were talking about Hillary Clinton and her email
[22:31.120 --> 22:39.920]  problem this is the inspector general who went through and did find that there were four emails
[22:39.920 --> 22:45.840]  that were classified now the way Hillary is putting this in context she says well I turned
[22:45.840 --> 22:53.120]  over 55,000 pages of emails okay now they say that even though they've only found four and she's
[22:53.120 --> 22:56.960]  saying there's not really a big problem because if we just found four the inspector general says
[22:56.960 --> 23:03.520]  that he's only reviewed about 40 of her emails that puts a bit of a different spin on it doesn't it
[23:03.520 --> 23:08.800]  it may be 55,000 pages of emails but they've only looked at 40 of them and they found that 10 percent
[23:08.800 --> 23:15.760]  of them contained information that was classified now her defense is worthy of her husband he's
[23:15.760 --> 23:22.400]  says I did not send or receive anything that was classified at the time like I said before he did
[23:22.400 --> 23:27.760]  not she did not have textual relationships with anybody look let's put that in perspective as
[23:27.760 --> 23:33.680]  well with whistleblowers jesslyn radick who has defended Ed Snowden she defended many of the
[23:33.680 --> 23:38.960]  NSA whistleblowers like thomas drake and others I she might have been the lawyer for William Benny
[23:38.960 --> 23:46.240]  she was a whistleblower herself so she knows what's going on with the whistleblowers in terms
[23:46.240 --> 23:52.320]  of classified documents and otherwise this is what she tweeted out she says the government says
[23:52.320 --> 23:56.880]  that Hillary Clinton's emails have classified data on it but she says that the classified
[23:56.880 --> 24:04.160]  that they were classified after the fact now whistleblowers have been prosecuted
[24:04.160 --> 24:09.520]  in both scenarios she points out they've been prosecuted for releasing information that was
[24:09.520 --> 24:14.800]  classified before they released it they have been prosecuted for information that was classified
[24:15.440 --> 24:21.680]  after they released it that's what they did to thomas drake they took some very innocuous
[24:21.680 --> 24:25.840]  documents that didn't need to be classified they weren't classified when he took them
[24:26.400 --> 24:30.480]  they found them he wasn't even releasing them to anyone they found them in his apartment and said
[24:30.480 --> 24:35.360]  you are in possession of classified documents of course that whole prosecution collapsed
[24:36.080 --> 24:42.880]  but that is what the government did to whistleblowers so you know that that doesn't necessarily
[24:42.880 --> 24:46.320]  put her off the hook and right now with 10% of the emails that have been reviewed
[24:47.040 --> 24:52.400]  showing that they were classified doesn't look too good for Hillary Clinton at this point although
[24:52.400 --> 24:58.880]  I don't think it's really going to hurt her in terms of incarceration or in terms of charges
[24:58.880 --> 25:04.320]  brought against her because it appears that no matter what these people do they never go to jail
[25:04.320 --> 25:10.160]  look at this article from info wars dot com today documents prove the irs targeted conservative
[25:10.160 --> 25:18.160]  groups this is a judicial watch showing that they went after the donor lists of tax exempt
[25:18.160 --> 25:22.560]  organizations they went after the people who had donated to these organizations these conservative
[25:22.560 --> 25:28.720]  groups and then they targeted them with audits but let's put this in context because this is
[25:28.720 --> 25:33.680]  the way the daily sheeple article points out they say on monday this last this is all come out in
[25:33.680 --> 25:41.200]  the last week last monday we learned that the irs phone system has hung up on 8.8 million callers
[25:41.200 --> 25:45.440]  who were looking for help with their taxes look they weren't just looking for advice because the
[25:45.440 --> 25:50.800]  irs doesn't get advice these are people who are calling up saying why are you making these demands
[25:50.800 --> 25:57.440]  on me I don't owe this money I need clarification for what these demands are and the irs just hangs
[25:57.440 --> 26:03.360]  up on them the irs talks about how they have fired their customer service representatives if you
[26:03.360 --> 26:07.200]  want to call them customer service that's a pretty cynical way to put it but they have
[26:07.200 --> 26:14.720]  fired them to reduce costs they say meanwhile hiring 17 000 new irs agents for obama care that
[26:14.720 --> 26:20.800]  brings us to revelation number two last week we also learned that the irs has been loving
[26:20.800 --> 26:25.840]  outrageous fines on businesses that reimburse their employees for health insurance fines that are
[26:25.840 --> 26:34.720]  12 times larger than the statutory limit written in the affordable care act in obama care okay so
[26:34.720 --> 26:41.200]  they they put fines in obama care and the irs comes along and says well I don't think we need any
[26:41.200 --> 26:51.040]  stinking laws we're just going to find people 12 times what the law says see it's not about revenue
[26:51.040 --> 26:58.080]  it's always been about control the irs has been used by virtually every president against their
[26:58.080 --> 27:04.800]  political enemies it's just never been used in such a broad sweep as has been done with obama
[27:04.800 --> 27:12.640]  it has never been done so openly so brazenly it's never been done without anybody trying to
[27:12.640 --> 27:18.560]  arrest someone for doing this this is what richard nixon was impeached for one of the main
[27:18.560 --> 27:23.440]  three things that he was impeached for was using the irs against his political enemies attempting
[27:23.440 --> 27:28.640]  to use it you know what happened at that time he sent a letter of enemies to the head of the irs
[27:28.640 --> 27:36.480]  and the head of the irs blew the whistle on that no the irs today works with obama and goes after
[27:36.480 --> 27:42.240]  massive numbers of conservative groups targeting them for auditing targeting their donor lists for
[27:42.240 --> 27:48.800]  audits now this is what we learn from judicial watch this week they have obtained documents
[27:48.800 --> 27:54.400]  that prove the irs used donor lists of tax exempt organizations to target them with audience
[27:54.400 --> 28:00.640]  audits they were largely conservative organizations that were opposed to obama the irs attempted to
[28:00.640 --> 28:08.960]  issue a gift tax of 35 percent on these donors despite the fact that a gift tax on donations
[28:08.960 --> 28:16.800]  was ruled unconstitutional by the supreme court and hasn't been used since 1982 you understand
[28:16.800 --> 28:22.720]  think about that this is something first we learned last week that they go in and they impose fines
[28:22.720 --> 28:29.360]  on companies that are 12 times higher than the obama care act allows just arbitrarily take it
[28:29.360 --> 28:36.160]  to 12 times higher then they go in and issue a gift tax of 35 percent on donors this is something
[28:36.160 --> 28:43.520]  that's been declared unconstitutional it hasn't been done since 1982 and they just do it this is
[28:43.520 --> 28:51.840]  the kind of punitive corruption the politicization politicization of the irs that is extremely
[28:51.840 --> 28:53.760]  dangerous stay with us we'll be right back
[28:53.760 --> 29:06.720]  wired magazine demonstrated how 470 000 Chrysler fiat vehicles in this case a jeep could be wirelessly
[29:06.720 --> 29:11.680]  remotely hacked and driven into a ditch of course it'll only be five to ten years before someone
[29:11.680 --> 29:16.640]  else the government will be driving your car all the time the national highway traffic safety
[29:16.640 --> 29:21.920]  administration plans to issue a v2v mandate that's vehicle to vehicle communication this year
[29:21.920 --> 29:27.120]  instead of 2016 as originally planned these mandates will be expensive new additions for your
[29:27.120 --> 29:31.280]  safety just like the safety systems that allowed hackers to turn off the steering turn off the
[29:31.280 --> 29:36.240]  brakes accelerate the jeep and drive it into a ditch mainstream media scoff when we talked at
[29:36.240 --> 29:40.320]  length about hacking a vehicle in conjunction with a car bomb to make it look like reckless driving

[33:40.320 --> 33:46.640]  to have a special report from alex jones in the next segment talking about what is behind
[33:46.640 --> 33:53.600]  these regulations to shut down your barbecue grill your fireplace creating regulations in
[33:53.600 --> 34:00.160]  seattle where they're going to outlaw single family homes this is all part of a government agenda
[34:00.160 --> 34:05.520]  just like the war on drugs many conservatives don't understand that the war on drugs is a un
[34:05.520 --> 34:11.280]  agenda was something that was created 10 years before nixon declared the war on drugs the un
[34:11.280 --> 34:16.000]  created their four schedules and of course we repeated that verbatim 10 years later that's
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.560]  the way these things work it's just the same way that they do the legislative agendas where the
[34:20.560 --> 34:27.040]  corporations write the laws with alex the american legislative uh i can't remember what the acronym
[34:27.040 --> 34:32.240]  stands for but we've seen this happening in many places with toll roads that's the way they used
[34:32.240 --> 34:37.680]  it in north carolina just recently we saw the politicians they're working with alex working
[34:37.680 --> 34:42.720]  with this organization they come in they go to these special retreats and this organization
[34:42.720 --> 34:47.200]  hands them legislation that has been written by the corporations and all they have to do
[34:47.760 --> 34:53.680]  is fill in the name of the state and get it passed in their state and there's a lot of questions
[34:53.680 --> 34:59.280]  about the money that is being handed around the scene being given by alex and these other
[34:59.280 --> 35:03.600]  organizations and of course that's the way these massive trade treaties that are being negotiated
[35:03.600 --> 35:09.040]  in secret are being handled as well they're being written by the corporate lawyers once they get
[35:09.040 --> 35:14.240]  that written they're going to hand it to the legislators and just tell them to sign on the
[35:14.240 --> 35:20.160]  bottom line we see this happening over and over again but there's a massive concern
[35:21.280 --> 35:26.080]  and rightful concern about what's going on in immigration in this country and donald trump's
[35:26.080 --> 35:31.920]  meteoric rise in the polls is a reflection of that we're seeing a situation look at some of these
[35:31.920 --> 35:36.320]  headlines illegal immigrant victims mothers we're at war right here in this country of course we've
[35:36.320 --> 35:41.680]  seen the many people the parents going to these congressional hearings talking about how their
[35:41.680 --> 35:45.680]  family members were killed by illegal immigrants who are basically part of a catch and release
[35:45.680 --> 35:50.880]  program that's been created by the federal government violent criminals who are not incarcerated
[35:50.880 --> 35:57.040]  who are even if they are deported they are brought back in very quickly illegal alien crime wave in
[35:57.040 --> 36:07.840]  texas 611,234 crimes 2,993 murders this is from 2008 2014 includes thousands of homicides
[36:07.840 --> 36:16.400]  sexual assaults they say a total of 177,588 unique criminal alien defendants these are people who
[36:16.400 --> 36:24.480]  had already been fingerprinted i went to a meeting of the secure communities initiative this was the
[36:24.480 --> 36:28.800]  uh it wasn't really a meeting of that but it was a meeting of the democrat party that was
[36:29.760 --> 36:35.680]  angry they wanted to get that repealed here in the austin area they were angry with the county
[36:35.680 --> 36:41.840]  sheriff who is a black democrat they told him you're in the wrong party if you're going to enforce
[36:41.840 --> 36:48.400]  this secure communities initiative what that was done for was to identify people who had previously
[36:48.400 --> 36:53.520]  been in the system as criminals people they had fingerprints for to single them out to turn them
[36:53.520 --> 36:59.600]  over to immigration they didn't want to see that happen and so basically what it turns into is a
[36:59.600 --> 37:04.400]  catch and release program look at this obama administration plans more executive action
[37:04.400 --> 37:08.960]  on immigration i say the obama administration is moving forward with plans to expand a waiver
[37:08.960 --> 37:13.360]  program that will allow additional illegal aliens to remain in the country rather than apply
[37:13.360 --> 37:20.400]  then apply for legal status from abroad another article obama shielding 80 percent of the nation's
[37:20.400 --> 37:25.120]  illegals from deportation another one obama administration strips requirement to defend
[37:25.120 --> 37:31.840]  the united states from the citizenship oath one more a mother of a son murdered by illegal
[37:31.840 --> 37:39.280]  aliens slams the sanctuary cities and politicians and says your silence speaks volumes so with all
[37:39.280 --> 37:44.000]  of this with the silence of the democrats the people telling us it's not a problem it's a good
[37:44.000 --> 37:50.320]  thing that we have open borders donald trump comes in and states the obvious it is a problem
[37:50.320 --> 37:54.240]  it's a problem that the republicans aren't doing anything about the democrats aren't doing anything
[37:54.240 --> 38:00.720]  about what really is the problem i mean when you look at a massive influx of people that we don't
[38:00.720 --> 38:06.960]  have any control over it's going to raise unemployment it's going to lower wages whether
[38:06.960 --> 38:12.080]  it's legal or illegal immigration if we have no control over who comes through our borders
[38:12.080 --> 38:15.360]  and the number of people that come through our borders look at what just happened in disney
[38:16.320 --> 38:22.000]  they brought in indian workers under a visa program that was originally set up so that
[38:22.000 --> 38:26.480]  technically uh tech companies could bring in people who had specialized skills that they
[38:26.480 --> 38:32.640]  couldn't find the united states but these were just customer service representatives these were low
[38:32.640 --> 38:37.840]  level white collar jobs nevertheless they were able to get the indian people that they brought in
[38:37.840 --> 38:43.120]  at a much cheaper rate than they could the americans they told the americans train your replacements
[38:43.120 --> 38:50.320]  and then they fired them see what what we don't understand is that every country and we've mentioned
[38:50.320 --> 38:54.240]  this many times here at info wars alex has talked about it you can't go to any other country and just
[38:54.240 --> 39:00.000]  say i want to live here i want to be provided for i want to be given free health care i want free
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.560]  education i want housing i want food stamps whatever you can't do that in any other country
[39:04.560 --> 39:10.480]  i remember 20 plus years ago i was looking at leaving this country i was looking at believes
[39:10.480 --> 39:16.720]  i was looking at new zealand even in believes i would have to go in with 25 000 per person to
[39:16.720 --> 39:22.560]  get citizenship there every other country especially countries like switzerland you have
[39:22.560 --> 39:26.880]  to have a certain amount of wealth to provide for yourself for your family you have to show
[39:26.880 --> 39:34.960]  that you have income show that you have a job but not here not in america not under this situation now
[39:34.960 --> 39:41.840]  i don't want to see some kind of a berlin wall erected at the borders because understand that
[39:41.840 --> 39:48.000]  in east germany that berlin wall was not there to stop people immigrating into east germany it was
[39:48.000 --> 39:55.040]  there to keep people from emigrating leaving that country but we also have a situation here in america
[39:55.040 --> 40:01.280]  where immigrants even illegal immigrants are treated better than citizens for example in state
[40:01.280 --> 40:07.200]  tuition an american citizen can only get in state tuition in the state in which they live not so
[40:07.200 --> 40:13.920]  with an alien they can get in state tuition anywhere they get treated differently as we
[40:13.920 --> 40:18.720]  pointed out with the sanctuary cities with the communities that don't want to participate in
[40:18.720 --> 40:23.440]  secure communities or whatever they get this catch and release system they're essentially
[40:23.440 --> 40:30.400]  treated as if they've got diplomatic immunity why can't us citizens be treated at least as well
[40:30.960 --> 40:36.800]  as immigrants why can't we get equal protection under the law from our own government of course
[40:36.800 --> 40:42.000]  they're not doing that at the same time we see the government looking the other way with violent
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.760]  criminals who come into this this country they are lowering the hammer on us with every kind of
[40:47.760 --> 40:54.480]  regulation with every kind of inspection using the border patrol not at the border but hundreds of
[40:54.480 --> 41:01.440]  miles inside the country to harass people that are obviously not coming into the country illegally
[41:02.480 --> 41:09.280]  so basically donald trump kind of goes howard bill on this whole problem okay he goes to the
[41:09.280 --> 41:12.800]  window and he shouts he's mad as hell and he's not going to take it anymore and he's got a lot of
[41:12.800 --> 41:19.200]  people who are following him on that but what is what is the source of the problem when we'd
[41:19.200 --> 41:23.440]  look at this video and let's pull this up because this is an article again at the end of the week
[41:23.440 --> 41:31.040]  last week we had the pictures that josh Owens and joe bigs took of the drug smugglers coming
[41:31.040 --> 41:37.280]  across the river they got some very close-up pictures of them dumping the large packages
[41:37.280 --> 41:42.080]  into the back of the suv and they were there to cover trump so this is going on while donald
[41:42.080 --> 41:47.280]  trump is there and so drudge picked up the story and then donald trump saw it from the
[41:47.280 --> 41:52.000]  drudge report here's what donald trump had to say what happened so while with it you probably
[41:52.000 --> 41:57.520]  read it it was a drudge who's great by the way drudge is amazing but the story and drudge
[41:58.080 --> 42:04.000]  and big story it's all over the place now guys swimming across and big bags of stuff
[42:04.000 --> 42:12.160]  drugs swimming across the river right swimming right across and they put the drugs and actually
[42:12.160 --> 42:17.280]  the camera crew or the reporters were petrified because they thought they were going to be killed
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.760]  because they're showing this on camera the guys carrying bags of stuff it was drugs
[42:23.120 --> 42:28.560]  yeah exactly that's a very dangerous situation but let me ask you what were they doing which
[42:28.560 --> 42:33.840]  direction were these drugs coming they're being pulled in just like the crime is being pulled
[42:33.840 --> 42:39.840]  in because of our war on drugs we've got businesses that are pulling in immigrants because they want
[42:39.840 --> 42:45.280]  cheap labor we've got government pulling them in because they want reliable dependents people who
[42:45.280 --> 42:50.720]  will vote for them that's the way you stop it you have to understand that it is the war on drugs
[42:50.720 --> 42:56.000]  that creates the el chapos just like it created al capone stay with us alex generals has a special

[47:02.320 --> 47:05.040]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:05.040 --> 47:25.840]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[47:25.840 --> 47:33.120]  many times in history incredibly horrible things can happen
[47:34.240 --> 47:39.200]  corruption can get completely over the top and the public just doesn't seem to respond
[47:40.000 --> 47:47.440]  but then there can be a catalyst that really causes a mass awakening and last year that was
[47:47.440 --> 47:52.720]  jonathan gruber one of the architects of obama care on c span admitting that they
[47:52.720 --> 47:57.360]  may keep the public in the dark and lie to us and that the insurance companies wrote obama
[47:57.360 --> 48:03.920]  care to screw everybody and that's when it went from being 65 percent unpopular like 89 percent
[48:03.920 --> 48:09.600]  in major polls but even though it's almost 90 percent unpopular and totally illegal
[48:11.120 --> 48:15.360]  and even though insurance profits are up 40 something percent is the last few years of
[48:15.360 --> 48:21.840]  obama care still the class warfare crowd can't get they've been screwed it wasn't a free deal
[48:21.840 --> 48:26.240]  the hospital systems are collapsing corporate raiders are looting the people
[48:27.280 --> 48:32.640]  under standardized central global models that have already been deployed in other countries
[48:32.640 --> 48:37.920]  i'm about to get to some huge information but i just want to point out so folks understand
[48:37.920 --> 48:44.240]  there's a chance to stop the next phase of this and that's agenda 21 that's what all of this is
[48:44.240 --> 48:50.560]  it's just a global treaty for global standardization of zoning education the environment
[48:50.560 --> 48:57.600]  health care self-defense reproductive rights trade that's what tpp is is just the next
[48:57.600 --> 49:02.240]  extension of that a usurpation private corporations setting up a world government
[49:02.960 --> 49:10.080]  we're being conquered by banks not tanks that back in 2007 i produced the film in-game blueprint
[49:10.080 --> 49:18.960]  for global enslavement and in that documentary we show you what's going to happen in the next decade
[49:18.960 --> 49:24.160]  and now we're here six and a half seven actually almost eight years later time flies
[49:24.160 --> 49:33.120]  so 2007 to 2015 we're talking eight years countless people will hate the new world order and will
[49:33.120 --> 49:39.360]  die protesting against it so this has been going on for a long time but now they have to break our
[49:39.360 --> 49:46.640]  will they have to train us to basically accept anything and everything now there's a new video
[49:46.640 --> 49:50.480]  out as i was saying earlier sometimes there's something political that happens that really
[49:50.480 --> 49:55.520]  gets people's attention and what's really woken folks up in the last 12 months across the united
[49:55.520 --> 50:02.800]  states is something we warned of back in 2007 2008 and it's in the film in game is that under
[50:02.800 --> 50:10.240]  unesco u n law that we've signed on to so they have to bring us under it all fireplaces space
[50:10.240 --> 50:15.840]  heaters everything's going to be banned here's a clip from roiders back in 2008 announcing how
[50:15.840 --> 50:24.000]  wonderful it was that the EU was banning space heaters and fireplaces the war on climate change
[50:24.000 --> 50:31.360]  is brewing conflict in europe it's over EU plans to ban these outdoor patio heaters okay there you
[50:31.360 --> 50:36.880]  go boom that's now happened now let's move on along to 2015 the thing that's gotten people's
[50:36.880 --> 50:43.520]  attention not just this particular story but from san francisco to tampa florida uh from austin texas
[50:43.520 --> 50:51.040]  uh to detroit michigan they are coming in saying no more fireplaces no more space heaters and they've
[50:51.040 --> 50:57.600]  got little regulators out with these vaguely written international rules that they pass locally
[50:58.240 --> 51:02.800]  that are mere copies saying anything anybody finds objectionable we're going to give you a
[51:02.800 --> 51:08.320]  fine for and this video is in florida and it's gone viral at info wars dot com where the code
[51:08.320 --> 51:15.680]  enforcer shows up they're barbecuing literally you can't even see the smoke the neighbor complains
[51:15.680 --> 51:19.520]  about it and we now have that in austin texas as well and he comes and gives them a fine
[51:20.640 --> 51:26.800]  and he says hey everybody else is cooking out he said look just complain on her so the answer is
[51:26.800 --> 51:35.040]  just all tattle on each other we have gmo poisoning us 400 billion tons of life a city year hard to
[51:35.040 --> 51:39.680]  believe number but that's how much is dumb tom things all of this is killing us but let's worry
[51:39.680 --> 51:44.320]  about barbecue smoke this is the whole nanny state and then it gives power to people to complain
[51:44.320 --> 51:49.920]  this is all part of the rollout for this and this code enforcer says hey if it's objectionable anybody
[51:49.920 --> 51:54.960]  around here it's banned you can have smells on your property but not off your property so again
[51:54.960 --> 51:58.800]  they're just training you to live under total tyranny here's the club so again right now but
[51:58.800 --> 52:01.760]  i'm on your property you're allowed to have a smell for your property so that doesn't count
[52:01.760 --> 52:07.280]  but when i'm on the street oh my god smell barbecue smoke on the street i can smell barbecue so
[52:07.280 --> 52:13.120]  i'm so excited right now i'm set against the law the law says everybody right here
[52:14.240 --> 52:19.200]  always all i can tell you is notice he says all i can tell you then he reads it anything
[52:19.200 --> 52:24.960]  objectionable that's under the u n your speech is objectionable it's banned now big chemical
[52:24.960 --> 52:28.960]  plants can spew chemicals in the air on you that's fine it's all for the little people to have no
[52:28.960 --> 52:34.320]  rights and then it just continues on from there florida man ordered by city to keep barbecue
[52:34.320 --> 52:40.720]  smell from leaving his property now let's move on to the next story this is from a few years ago
[52:40.720 --> 52:46.240]  micro apartments bloomberg himself is behind getting people living 250 to 300 to 400 square foot
[52:46.240 --> 52:51.200]  apartments so they can raise taxes on you have higher property taxes and have most of your living
[52:51.200 --> 52:57.840]  expense not be the actual square feet or quality but be to pay government more taxes so everything's
[52:57.840 --> 53:02.320]  being geared to basically take everything you've got but tell you it's trendy so it's cool this is
[53:02.320 --> 53:08.320]  all part of the 21 california wages war on single family homes in recent years homeowners have been
[53:08.320 --> 53:14.880]  made to feel a bit like villains rather than the victims of hard times wall street and then it just
[53:14.880 --> 53:19.520]  goes on from there that you're not allowed to have a family home and then they tell all these
[53:19.520 --> 53:25.440]  reasons for it it's under the u n code to have us be in compact cities for higher taxes and end
[53:25.440 --> 53:32.240]  family units as you know it these new high-rise tattletail buildings continuing this is just this
[53:32.240 --> 53:40.160]  week how a seattle plan to end single family zoning to change affordable housing epa's wood burning
[53:40.160 --> 53:47.680]  stove ban has chilling consequences for many rural people and then it ties into the social
[53:47.680 --> 53:54.320]  engineering obama just goes to kenya a few days ago and he lectures them on gay rights while they
[53:54.320 --> 54:00.080]  have terrorists connected to groups he's funding attacking their country he lectures them as if that's
[54:00.080 --> 54:05.840]  the only right there is the only culture there is no other cultures allowed but the artificial
[54:05.840 --> 54:10.880]  culture of quote gay rights because then you don't have children then you don't have families then
[54:10.880 --> 54:16.800]  it lowers population we cover that an end game and show their documents where they admit that's the
[54:16.800 --> 54:21.440]  plan to end the human community as we know it i'm not against people that are quote gay i can care
[54:21.440 --> 54:28.320]  less i'm a libertarian it's that this agenda is in stone to force feed this not for tolerance
[54:28.320 --> 54:35.840]  but to make everyone adopt it and finally california governor signs bill repealing words husband and
[54:35.840 --> 54:43.600]  wife and they're now saying it's hateful uh for children to use the word boy or girl so in public
[54:43.600 --> 54:49.440]  schools nationwide under agenda 21's control of education you're called purple penguins imagine
[54:49.440 --> 54:54.080]  imagine a kurt vonnegut novel where you don't call yourselves boys or girls you're purple penguins
[54:54.080 --> 55:03.920]  it's it's a total cult of absolute brainwashing and control over the top at a level absolutely
[55:03.920 --> 55:09.600]  never seen and then they say brown paper bags in seattle it's the model of the country are racist
[55:09.600 --> 55:15.440]  and hateful well now they're saying medieval themed video games legitimize white supremacy
[55:15.440 --> 55:22.720]  so any movie or video game set in a white culture is obviously bad it's not allowed to even exist
[55:23.760 --> 55:28.240]  so king arthur's racist because where are the black people well then i guess where are the
[55:29.200 --> 55:33.600]  where are the white people and you know in an african fable it's where you don't know reading
[55:33.600 --> 55:38.800]  writing and arithmetic you just know mental illness to obsess on any culture that's independent
[55:38.800 --> 55:44.240]  any culture not controlled by the corporate plastic hive borg and and you notice it's getting
[55:44.240 --> 55:50.720]  worse every few weeks now this is the global rollout all over the world this is agenda 21 this is the
[55:50.720 --> 55:54.640]  green police where they had out of commercials five years ago where you get arrested for having
[55:54.640 --> 55:59.280]  the wrong light bulbs they even admitted in the san francisco chronicle that that was meant to
[55:59.280 --> 56:05.280]  prepare the public for the real rollout and now federally and locally they were the exact uniforms
[56:05.280 --> 56:11.840]  from the green police ads that out of your hand during the super bowl five years ago that's now
[56:11.840 --> 56:18.160]  happened this is how they condition and prepare you it's a diabolical takeover plan we're breaking

[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.600]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:20.960]  welcome back to the alex jones show on this sunday july 26 2015 i'm david night your host
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:28.080]  want to talk in this section about the amazing dichotomy that we've seen in just the last week
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:34.960]  or so in the congress we've had the house pass a bill that would block states from requiring gmo
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:41.040]  labeling on food now there's already two states that have passed that law and this would essentially
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:47.040]  override those bills i see a big constitutional problem with it of course it's not become law
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:54.640]  yet it still has to go through the senate 275 to 150 they passed the safe and accurate food
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:00.560]  labeling act of 2015 how is it accurate when they prohibit you from knowing everything that's in your
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:08.000]  food there's over 3000 ingredients that are required to be labeled by the fda if somebody puts
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:13.520]  a particular ingredient they have a list of 3000 of them if that ingredient is on that list
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:19.360]  that's on the from the fda you have to say that that ingredient is in your food of course they're
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:24.960]  saying you're not going to be able to afford to eat if we have to change these labels really is that
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:30.000]  really credible that is something that we've seen coming out of the coalition for safe and affordable
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:38.080]  food they said that this is going to increase $500 a year your food cost if these labels were to go
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:44.160]  through and of course as blacklisted news points out this is a lie that's been debunked over and
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:50.720]  over again this is something that came out from the council for biotech information uh monsanto
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:57.360]  and the other trade organizations that create genetically modified organisms are part of that
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.320]  look we have a lot of different ingredients like i just said that are on uh listed on your food
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.760]  you're free to look at that you're free to consider those ingredients you're free to ignore
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.960]  them you're free to just blissfully choose it because you like the color of the label and you
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:19.600]  don't care at all what's in it we have the thing called free choice especially in grocery stores
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:26.240]  but there are people who want to know people who are very concerned and we all as consumers have
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:31.600]  a right to know the principle is called informed consent but of course that's something that don't
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.320]  really care about much anymore is it when you've got state governments like california telling
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:40.800]  people that we're going to mandate that we're going to mandate vaccines for you for your children
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:46.880]  and we don't really care whether you agree with this or not we're not going to uh uh let you be
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:51.520]  informed about this and we certainly don't care about your consent and that's precisely what we're
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:58.080]  seeing here as i've said before we've seen the corporate model getting control of politicians
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:03.520]  in government so that they could create regulations for their smaller competitors to drive them out
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:09.840]  of business that's been the anti-competitive model for a very long time it's been a huge part of
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:14.160]  crony capitalism now you can see it even in the banking industry look at the act that was put
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:19.840]  together by dodd and frank the dodd frank bill basically created so many regulatory requirements
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:26.880]  that small banks everywhere are having to stop or cannot any longer write loans about homes or
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:32.880]  many business loans are having to get out of that business because they can't afford to comply
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:39.200]  with the massive amounts of regulation reporting and forms that are required by this so-called
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:46.320]  reform act so once they get out once they no longer have the competition from the smaller banks
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:51.600]  or whatever the industry is then the big guys who got the legislation put in there to start with
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:57.440]  can come back and they can get that regulation removed so it no longer costs them any money
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:02.720]  that's been the model for a very long time but now the model is to keep you in the dark to not
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:07.120]  let you know what the new trade treaties are about to not let you know what's going in your food
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:13.200]  and to tell you that even if you do know you're going to be forced to get that you're going to
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:17.840]  be forced to buy the insurance you're going to be forced to buy affordable health care
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:24.400]  just like you're going to be forced to buy food that doesn't have accurate food labeling information
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:31.520]  on it they call up the safe and accurate food labeling act when they deny states requiring
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:36.720]  that they accurately label what's on there that's the pattern that's the pattern we've seen from
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:42.400]  our government for a very long time that's why activists are calling it the dark act but now
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:47.120]  the pattern is for the corporations to use government to hold a gun to your head to force
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:52.720]  you to buy products that you don't want that aren't safe that you can't afford stay with us
[01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:57.600]  we're going to be right back and we're going to talk about what's going on on the intelligence
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:03.120]  side something that ties into jade helm have you ever dreamt of having superpowers well what if I
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:09.520]  told you there are real life superhumans and their dna could be worth billions drug companies have
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:16.480]  their eyes on people like steven peat who can put his hand on a hot stove or step on glass and feel no
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:22.720]  pain and about 100 people share timothy drayers condition his bones are so dense he could walk
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:29.760]  away from a mangled wreck unscathed both men's apparent superpowers come from uncommon deviations
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:36.240]  in their dna but rather than freakish these traits are seen as a gift from god to the drug companies
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:41.920]  who want to turn them into something useful something good for business the painkiller
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:47.200]  market alone is worth 18 billion a year so of course the industry is pressing ahead with
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:53.120]  research into genetic irregularities for better or worse find out how this research will change
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:06:09.040]  humanity forever at info wars dot com

[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:10.160]  life dot com that's info wars life dot com now as we were talking about in the last segment we're
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:15.920]  talking about the dark act of course they call it the safe and accurate food labeling when they
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:23.280]  deny you to have information about what's going into your food when they override the constitutional
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:28.960]  authority that the states have to require labeling this is for products that are within their state
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:37.280]  and they're certainly within their right to put in laws that require that the manufacturers will
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:41.440]  tell people what is in their food and it's been passed in a couple of states so what they decided
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:45.920]  to do was to fight that at the national level and of course it's going to be fought at the
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:50.880]  international level that's a huge part of the secret trade agreements the transatlantic the
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:56.560]  trans specific trade agreements those are also going to shut down the idea that anyone should
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:02.080]  know if there's genetically modified organisms in their food why should we be concerned about that
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:08.080]  well you need to understand what genetically modified organisms are educate yourself but
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:14.880]  we should all have the ability and the right to know what is in our food and we should all
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:22.800]  be very concerned about genetic modified organisms what we have already seen from these organisms
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:27.920]  in terms of studies from other countries we saw the study in France where they showed the
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:34.480]  rats the mice with tumors all over their bodies just feeding them genetically modified food for
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:42.160]  a short period of time that study was redone by Monsanto and they shortened it up to an extremely
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:47.440]  short period of time and said look our mice didn't get those tumors because they ran it a fraction
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:53.440]  of the time that the French study did so you can always find somebody that you can pay to do a study
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:09:01.600]  to prove that your product is safe but we have a right to know what is in our food but not when
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.560]  you've got the government that is for sale not when you have congressmen who can easily be bought
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:13.040]  off by Monsanto by the Koch brothers again one of these articles pointed out that Koch brothers
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:18.640]  only had to pay $299,000 to block labeling of genetically modified food that's an article
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:24.800]  from Zero Hedge they point out that the guy who took they have one particular congressman just
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:31.040]  like Senator Pan in California took the lead for pushing through the mandatory vaccinations of
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:38.000]  children there the guy that's doing this to push through a genetically modified foods without
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.440]  anybody knowing what's in it is a guy by the name of Mike Pompeo from Kansas a Republican
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:51.200]  and it didn't cost them too much to get this through they have paid $67 million to fight labeling
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:56.560]  laws all across this country at the state level but even places where it has been one now they
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:02.960]  decided they would go the next higher next higher level and shut this down now you have to ask
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:07.760]  yourself when you see this when you see that you're not going to be allowed to know what's in your
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:16.080]  food it's very interesting to see this in direct contravention to what the government wants to know
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:21.680]  about you which is everything and we can see this with another bill that unanimously passed
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:28.640]  committee this is a bill that would allow Homeland Security to create yet another department
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:33.200]  this one I guess we could call this the pre-crime department this is going to be the
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:40.800]  countering violent extremism department the CVE is going to be funded under FEMA which of course
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:48.880]  is under Homeland Security very worrying when you look at the fact that this new department is going
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:54.720]  to be identifying people who have the potential to be violent extremists they haven't committed an
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:11:01.920]  act this is equivalent to identifying people as we pointed out before with Jade Helm human domain
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:07.680]  analytics activity based intelligence geospatial intelligence all these different technologies
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:12.800]  that will mine all of the information that they're getting about everyone about every group putting
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:18.720]  this together then running it through their artificial intelligence to see who pops up out
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:26.560]  of their database a very very dangerous idea if ever there was one many people have been concerned
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:33.920]  about the potential of profiling to falsely identify people of different groups understand
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:39.920]  that this is about religious groups it's about political groups it's about racial groups this
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:46.960]  is about every kind of profiling you can imagine and this is also involved with Jade Helm mastering
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:52.000]  the human domain is their motto that was the motto of the geospatial intelligence conference
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.800]  just a couple of years ago the keynote speech was about mastering the human domain now they want to
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:02.240]  take this to another level they want to fund this under FEMA and that comes at the same time we've
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:10.880]  heard Wesley Clark floating the trial balloon saying that we need to identify people who are
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.120]  going to be maybe looking at social media looking at young people who are alienated because of their
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.920]  job because of their love life maybe because they're just not happy we need to look at their
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:25.200]  religious background remember when he said all that we covered this last week you need to understand
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:29.840]  where this is going because at the same time that came out we see this bill that passed the
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:37.280]  house committee unanimously and is now going to the full house this will fund efforts by FEMA to
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:43.600]  identify people to propagandize people this is an all-out propaganda campaign remember it was
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:49.600]  just a couple of years ago that our government removed the prohibitions from Radio Free Europe
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:55.760]  and Voice of America they were never allowed to operate in the United States that was the term
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.560]  of their creation they were not going to be allowed to propagandize the American people on
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:07.840]  behalf of the government but of course we had things like NPR we had things like ABC CBS NBC
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:12.720]  people who would when Obama was pushing through Obamacare they would report every day remember
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:16.480]  how they did that every day from the White House and when the Republicans said hey we would like
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:21.040]  to have some equal time to push back against what Obama is promoting with Obamacare they said
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:25.520]  now we're not going to give you equal time they said fine sell us some equal time said we're not
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:30.640]  even going to sell you equal time so yeah there's been a lot of propaganda but now it is getting
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:36.240]  much more in your face I mean this is getting to the point of Orwell's Ministry of Truth they're
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:43.040]  now creating this new department under Homeland Security under FEMA called countering violent
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:47.600]  extremism they're going to identify people through social media through other methods
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:53.360]  that they think might become radicalized and violent and then they are going to
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.840]  who knows what they're going to do perhaps they're going to enter them that's certainly what
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:04.960]  Wesley Clark proposed remember he said at the time he said if in World War II someone supported
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:08.960]  the Nazis at the expense of the US we didn't say that was freedom of speech we put them in a camp
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:14.880]  no actually you were locking people up because of the group that they belong to because they were
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:19.920]  Japanese Americans it wasn't that they were speaking out in favor of the Nazis they didn't
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:25.600]  lock up Charles Lindbergh they didn't lock up the royal family for speaking out in favor of eugenicism
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:30.000]  or the Aryan race or saying that Hitler made the trains run on time they didn't lock people up for
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.480]  that they locked people up because they were German because they were Japanese ancestry
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:40.720]  of course spies were always locked up people who created acts of terrorism a violence of sabotage
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:45.520]  they were always locked up they were executed but this is something different and Wesley Clark
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:50.560]  knows that this is different Wesley Clark was valedictorian at West Point this is a guy that
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:56.720]  ran for president as a Democrat he knows better than this okay he goes on to say people who are
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:01.520]  disloyal to the United States as a matter of principle that's fine it's their right but it's
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:07.760]  our right an obligation to segregate them from the community for the duration of the conflict
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:17.520]  let's parse those euphemisms there segregate means internment the length of the conflict
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:25.520]  is indefinite this is a war on terrorism it is a war on a tactic there's not even a defined
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:31.280]  group of people you may think you know who this is you may think that this is against the jihadis
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:37.040]  it's not against the jihadis we'll talk about that when we come back but understand too look at this
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:42.880]  in the context of the ndaa that they passed a couple of years ago that obama signed on new
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:50.080]  years eve indefinite detention by the military without trial without charge and now they've
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:56.000]  got fema involved and they've got a us general pushing the idea stay with us we'll be right back

[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:42.080]  about the topics we've been talking about today i want to go back though and and continue to talk
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:51.360]  a little bit more about this bill it is a hr 2889 is the bill that will create a center for violent
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:57.440]  extremism to combat violent extremism and of course that is not people who have committed acts of
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:03.360]  violence but people that they identify as potentially becoming radicalized potentially
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:09.600]  becoming violent who would that be well of course it reminds me of every election when the democrats
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:14.960]  and the republicans say that they're going to cut somebody's benefit or they're going to raise
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:20.080]  somebody's taxes everybody believes that it's going to be a different group than them they don't
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:23.600]  think that they're going to get their benefits cut or their taxes raised they think it's going to be
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:27.360]  someone else and that's kind of the same thing we see happening with this everybody here is
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.240]  violent extremists and uh so many people want to believe well okay that's the jihadis that's
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:37.920]  people like uh that guy that shot up the recruitment stations did you notice how they pushed back
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:43.760]  against that you notice how they refuse to label him as a terrorist did you notice that they came
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:51.520]  up with every excuse they could to avoid the connections of mohammed and a guy who was very
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:58.400]  troubled you could see his um if you want to look in mind the database uh on social media you could
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:03.520]  very easily do that and see that he had a chip on his shoulder about the way that he was treated he
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:10.960]  was very angry he specifically targeted not one but two different recruitment areas shooting at
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:15.440]  the people at one then driving to another one and shooting them specifically targeting the
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:21.280]  u.s. military but of course we can't say it was an act of terrorism we can't say it was an islamic
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:27.920]  jihadi who did this in spite of all of the obvious indicators they have to come up with some phony
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:34.480]  baloney thing that his parents were concerned that he was doing a lot of drugs and uh prescription
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:42.800]  drugs uh marijuana and alcohol look the marijuana and alcohol aren't going to make you do that he
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:48.000]  knew precisely what he was doing it wasn't that he went crazy and just started shooting randomly
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:53.760]  in some area because he was hyped up on uh some ssri drug he could have been hyped up on that but
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:23:01.120]  it was also focused on uh a jihadi agenda so but a lot of people look at this and they say well
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:05.040]  of course so you know violent extremists yeah we need to stop that we need to keep things like that
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:12.080]  from happening in the future understand that is not the way mike mccall and barack obama
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:15.680]  are going to use this legislation and this legislation has passed unanimously in the
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:20.800]  house committee it is now going to go to the full house and it has broad bipartisan support
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:25.520]  here's an article from conservative hq talking about this they say who are these violent extremists
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:31.680]  that obama and mike mccall republican keep talking about well are they actually isomacists
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:37.840]  okay like the guy that shot things up in tennessee no they're americans uh perhaps who support the
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:42.480]  right to life for second amendment rights or maybe they're veterans you know the same people
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:47.360]  that we've seen over and over again from the mayak report that info wars broke back in 2009
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:53.680]  identifying people like uh those who have bumper stickers supporting ron paul or chuck baldwin uh
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:57.280]  on the back of their car those are the people that they're concerned about those are the people
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:03.440]  that the southern poverty law center has identified okay remember of course that uh you know they want
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:08.160]  to talk about white supremacists and the kook klex klan the southern poverty law centers
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:14.880]  founder morris d's defended the kook klex klan he worked for george wallis in the early days of
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:21.040]  the civil rights movement when george wallis was opposed to civil rights the only way that that
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:26.000]  morris d's the founder of the southern poverty law center was involved in the civil rights movement
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.480]  when it was happening was to defend the klan to defend the people that beat demonstrators that
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:36.960]  burned their buses he made a lot of money doing that but he made even more money doing direct
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.040]  mail and that's what they're doing they're setting the agenda and we've seen this over and over again
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:46.880]  not just in the mayak report we've seen it in scenarios military scenarios voted by uh the
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:52.960]  government we've also uh seen it in uh the various reports that are coming from them here's another
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:25:00.240]  example from security debrief this guy says uh mccall's legislation must take on a more nuanced
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:06.400]  thoughtful and intelligent perspective of homegrown violent extremism than we have seen thus far in
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:12.080]  government efforts he says this is not just about isle or about those inspired by radical violent
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:18.400]  interpretation of islam if we're serious about countering growth and homegrown violent extremism
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:25.120]  we need to legitimately focus our efforts on all forms of it okay so then he talks about a few
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.320]  different points down here he says here's the problems with our approach so far number one
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:34.960]  the whole idea of radicalism we don't really define what radicalism is i say yeah that's that
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:40.160]  is a problem because it's so open-ended just like the war on tears or war on a tactic but they want
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:45.120]  to broaden it the very next thing they say is too narrowly focused on muslims the original
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:50.560]  program looked exclusively at the muslim community so we need to look at other things to be sure
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:58.000]  muslim identity extremism is a threat but it is not the only threat nor is it even the greatest
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.040]  threat this is what the people in the business are saying this is what the people in the military
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:08.560]  industrial complex this is what the people in the surveillance industrial complex are telling us
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:14.160]  okay this is what the people who write the war scenarios who write the legislation this is what
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:18.880]  they think over and over again we see this we see this from strat for where he's talking about he
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:23.760]  says yeah okay islamicism that's a that that's a threat but it's not the biggest threat okay
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:30.560]  all these people have a bigger threat the bigger threat the homegrown threat are people who are
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:36.000]  conservatives who are for limited government as they would call them this is what he says right here
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.720]  in the in the study here and of course he's quoting government studies when he says this in
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:44.800]  2014 a national consortium for the study of terrorism and responses to terrorism
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:50.800]  their center reported that it is anti-government sovereign citizen movement that is the top
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:56.720]  terrorist threat the new america foundation remember those guys they called for a north american union
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:03.280]  id that was their editorial not too long ago they were in the top of cnn calling for a north
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:08.880]  american union id well these people also like to play with statistics they say if we exclude the
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:14.240]  september 11 2001 attack well why in the world would you exclude that because it doesn't give you
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:19.440]  the answer that you want okay but if you exclude that we see that more people have been killed by
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:25.520]  anti-government adherents white supremacists other non-muslim extremists so just understand
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:29.840]  that when they're talking about combating violent extremism when they're talking about creating
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:36.480]  a department that's going to be under fema to identify to propagandize and we can presume
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:41.280]  that they're going to enter people just as wesley clark has advocated with his troblons
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:46.240]  when you look at that just understand that they're talking probably about you
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:52.080]  anyone whether you're islamic or whether you're not islamic whether you're white or whether you're
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:28:01.360]  not white anyone can be flagged as a false positive by some kind of a massive pre-crime

[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:22.640]  okay that's what they're doing right now they're practicing domestic operations people say it's
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:29.200]  provocative when uh when the russians are doing exercises or when the americans are going close
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:33.680]  to the russian border and doing exercises as they currently are right now they're doing

[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:46.080]  saying well that's very provocative you're trying to provoke the russians okay but we don't think
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:53.760]  that is provocative when they train against us civilians in our country labeling us as hostile

[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:14.880]  another article that that really ties in to what we were just talking about with the massive
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.000]  data mining with the pre-crime analysis all of this data that they're collecting to
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:25.120]  from you remember they're going to mine this data they're going to pass it through some software
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:31.760]  that is going to try to identify people who are potential radicals people who are potentially
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:37.280]  violent and they're going to do something to those people before they commit a crime
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:42.160]  that is the stated goal that is the goal of this legislation from mike mccall
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:48.160]  are they going to stop it propagandizing these people or are they going to proceed to
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:56.400]  detention and internment camps or worse that's the question but look it doesn't even
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:02.320]  begin when you get on social media it begins in kindergarten in today's america this is a story
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:10.400]  from zero hedge pre-crime is now upon us schools assess students threat level starting in kindergarten
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:16.800]  this is in virginia the virginia student threat assessment guidelines the stag they got a great
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:21.360]  in that great you know it just legitimizes it when you create an acronym like that the stag
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:28.240]  the stag is a school-based manualized process designed to help school administrators mental
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:33.520]  health staff this is for kindergarten mental health staff in kindergarten and law enforcement
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:40.480]  officers assess and respond to threat incidents involving students in kindergarten through 12th
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:47.040]  grade to prevent student violence so we got mental assessment we've got law enforcement
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:53.120]  assessment from our kids beginning in kindergarten and as he points out in zero hedge he says the
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:37:00.400]  idea unfortunately is to implement this watch and flag surveillance grid that's what we see with the
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:07.120]  human domain analytics to implement the surveillance grid across the system at every level with
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:14.080]  every institution that everyone comes in contact with constant surveillance everywhere of course
[01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:20.800]  zivik new brzezinski suggested that 40 some odd years ago and the book that got him to be hand
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:26.960]  picked for the trilateral commission to head that commission as its first president by kissinger and
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:32.480]  others the commission that would create a structure that we see being mirrored in the
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:38.800]  current secretive trade treaties the transatlantic the trans-pacific partnerships combining those
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:44.400]  two regions with the north american region nevertheless the question is you know who's
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:48.640]  going to pop up what's the criteria that they're going to use but look at this look at this article
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:53.760]  it's up on info wars.com today at an anti-bullying conference middle schoolers learn about lesbian
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:59.920]  strap-on anal sex and fake testicles this is originally from the daily caller they say in a
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:06.160]  small rural town in iowa a group of parents and community leaders are seeking to prevent
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:12.800]  students from the local taxpayer funded middle school and high school from attending future versions
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:19.120]  of an anti-bullying conference for lesbian gay bisexual transgender teams now this is being held
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:25.760]  in a very small town humboldt iowa this is a town with 4,690 people in it and these are middle
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:34.640]  school kids look this is nothing but brave new world now when i was in high school we read brave
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:41.920]  new world we analyze brave new world now you've got middle schoolers living brave new world
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:47.120]  that's what this is really about listen to some of the stuff that they're doing how to sew fake
[01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:51.840]  testicles into your underwear in order to pass themselves off as boys as for girls when speaker
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:57.200]  war address made out of condoms which could be quote used as needed another speaker raised the
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:03.200]  important middle school issue of using the internet to locate an orgy this is for middle school kids
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:11.520]  okay what kind of bullying is this this is bullying from the lgbt community this is sexual
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:16.800]  bullying from that community we had bullying everybody had bullying in school it wasn't
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:23.200]  anything to do with this that's the pretext that they use to get these kids in to sexualize them
[01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:29.280]  and they say well we support all clubs in the school that meet policies and procedures but of
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:33.360]  course i don't imagine that that policy and procedure i don't imagine they would support
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:39.280]  some explicitly christian group because they would be afraid they get sued by the aclu
[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:44.240]  let's go to your calls eileen and fema region number five eileen are you a potential radical
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:51.440]  oh she did okay uh she dropped off let's go to uh tony and south carolina tony
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:40:02.480]  hello tony yeah yeah i'm here um we're calling about the sand blend death
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:09.280]  mm-hmm and i don't know five six years ago i was studying um you know music dot org about
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:14.480]  austrian economics i watch videos by dr block um
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:20.080]  and they brought up about you know whatever the government been having something and make
[01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:26.240]  stairs which makes it expensive um and talking about marijuana so i studied marijuana i know
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:31.440]  i don't smoke i don't you know have anything to do with it but during my studies i found out that
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:37.680]  that the marijuana plant has flowers and leaves there are things called trichomes which are little
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:43.440]  round balls that grow on those leaves at at blossoming time inside that bulb or the trichome
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:49.920]  is tetrahydrocannabinole but in its native form the tetrahydrocannabinole is bonded or bound with
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:57.120]  a carboxylate molecule to um your your your body has receptors that receive thc
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:00.960]  that's right yeah there's a lot of people have talked about the health benefits of things like
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:06.400]  cannabis oil and other things like that we had a representative here in the state of texas
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:13.360]  david simpson who floated a bill said look marijuana is a natural substance we don't need
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:19.200]  to have any regulation of it any more than we need to have a regulation of potatoes for example
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:25.200]  we should remove all mention of it from the code i think uh tony the the problem you you mentioned
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:30.080]  austrian economics and of course the economics of prohibition you understand that as well i think
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:35.840]  when we see places where they have decriminalized marijuana they haven't really decriminalize it
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:40.320]  what they've done is they've put in a very complicated code very much like the irs code that
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:45.760]  we talked about earlier in the show where they can go in with a complex law and use that to entrap
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:49.680]  people you know one of the things that we've heard for a very long time is that any law that is
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:56.000]  sufficiently complex is the same as having no law at all just as we're seeing with the irs constantly
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:01.760]  we see that it is so complex as uh rand paul was uh setting fire to it trying to cut it with a
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:06.880]  chainsaw with a wood chip or anything he's talking about look it's 70 000 pages it's like who can know
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:13.440]  what is in this code it is simply an instrument of social control it's not about revenue it's simply
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:17.520]  about controlling you but what was the point that you want to make with uh sandra bland
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:21.920]  well the point was i was getting to it or wrapping up so people understood it is that
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:28.960]  the carboxyl atom blocks the thc receptor from receiving the thc so without removing that carboxyl
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:34.080]  atom by converting it you don't get high you don't get stoned you don't get you know we for madness
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:41.280]  you don't go crazy um you can remove that carboxyl by heat of 170 some out of 180 degrees and up
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:49.120]  you can remove it by oils and alcohol uh so hard to this way i mean so so do you buy the idea that
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:52.560]  she got re for madness and killed herself because we're running out of time we gotta go to break
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:58.880]  yes yes or no very very quickly we're out of time hang on well we'll come to you when we come back

[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:33.040]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host in this last segment
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:36.720]  i want to try to get to as many of these phone calls as we've got on the line right now i want
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:42.480]  to go back to uh tony in south carolina we were talking about sandra bland and uh the likelihood
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:48.000]  is to whether or not the reason she committed suicide as a police say that she did was because
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:52.160]  she was on reefer madness real quickly tony because we got a lot of people on online i want to get
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:58.160]  to everybody uh tell us what you think about sandra bland do you buy the uh the line from the police
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:03.040]  that she committed suicide because of marijuana when she was there in the jail for three days
[01:48:03.920 --> 01:48:08.480]  well they've almost i'm very skeptical about it because you can eat 15 tons of marijuana
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:13.440]  and not get a buzz yeah so that wouldn't make or nothing kill herself so the autopsy shows
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:17.360]  that she consumed it where did she get it from in either case they wouldn't have gotten her high
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:22.960]  and stupid um that's right it is it's not the sort of thing that makes people i i'm not like you
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:27.680]  i'm not a marijuana user but i've i've read enough about it talked enough people about it that i know
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:34.080]  that it doesn't make you suicidal it doesn't make you go out and shoot people uh it is not reasonable
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:38.160]  and the fact that she was there for three days and they say she was smoking it in such quantities
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:44.800]  that she committed suicide i mean that's just that really raises a lot of red flags uh thank you
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:47.840]  tony i want to go to some of the other callers because we've got a lot of people on the line
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:52.000]  let's go to uh christ in new york christy has some comments about wesley clark's comments
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:49:01.040]  yeah um thank you david i wanted to say that um these um what he said about
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:10.320]  how people that have to be somehow um restrained from uh taken away from the public um that sounds
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:19.520]  to me like the manual that was led out by the army which is the 3-39-40 interment and resettlement
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:25.520]  yes exactly exactly we've seen this voted in so many different ways so many different times i mean
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:29.600]  i can't believe that it's not getting more attention i find this very alarming when you
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:33.040]  look at the manual you just talked about when we look at the training scenarios that we've seen
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:36.960]  when we look at the indefinite detention by the military without trial that was quietly
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:43.600]  signed in as part of the nda act that never was repealed they keep re-upping that uh does that concern
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:51.760]  you it should well it's of course it is concerning but people have to connect the dots the ndaa is
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:57.680]  there for a reason also the uh manual that we just spoke about also um the department of
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:02.320]  homeland security saying that veterans are the number one threat and christians are the number
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:09.200]  one for uh the number four threat yes also i would like to state that um the same type of
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:16.720]  scenario is being used for those who are who have political defense and question the government
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:22.800]  and do not submit entirely to the establishment and those are going to be the people who are sick
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:27.600]  that watson is going to make the decision whether they take the care or not they're starting
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:32.400]  this with the veterans but that's going to be for everybody absolutely and you know one of the things
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:36.080]  chris that they concerned me when i looked at this and one of the places that i saw this
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:42.240]  originally reported was on a site called crooks and liars and they had a left-leaning democrat party
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:46.960]  readership and what they said was yeah you know i think this is basically a good idea i think we
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:52.160]  ought to uh inter all these people in texas who want their guns maybe we could send them someplace
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:57.520]  like texas anybody that's like that build a fence around texas you can read about these
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:04.560]  wackos at info wars this is precisely the kind of thinking that is so dangerous everybody thinks
[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:09.200]  it's going to be some other group the conservatives think it's going to be the islamists the uh
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:15.680]  the liberals are obviously have their eye on us but they need to realize that whenever there have
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:22.480]  been military fascist governments they have usually been right wing and they may find themselves
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:27.120]  as targets and most likely will this is going to be something that's going to be equal opportunity
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:32.080]  anybody that the current regime whether it's left wing or whether it's right wing is going to see
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:36.240]  as dangerous and that's what we need to stand together this is something that should not
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:40.800]  separate us into different partisan groups everybody should understand that regardless of
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:46.640]  their political party regardless of their religion or their race this is something that threatens
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:53.120]  all of us to have a government doing this kind of pre-crime analysis uh thank you so much chris
[01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:57.920]  we've got a phone call from alex jones i don't want to get his comments thank you alex go ahead
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:10.080]  sure uh i think we just lost him alex is trying to call us he is he's touched down he's in europe
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:15.520]  right now he's in uh london did he did he drop off guys okay i think we lost connection to alex if
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:20.400]  we can get him back we're gonna go back to alex obviously let's go to uh rob in arizona you
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:29.280]  want to talk about the irs targeting go ahead yeah hi david i i got a big problem with that targeting
[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:34.880]  i mean number one it's unconstitutional to target any one singular group of people
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:41.600]  racially religiously politically or otherwise and frankly if they want to target somebody how
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:48.640]  about they target themselves look at all the criminality they commit yes yes precisely i find
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:54.480]  it very concerning that this is so much broader in scope than anything we saw under nixon and at
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:59.120]  least they tried to impeach nixon uh he resigned because he knew that that was imminent he knew
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:05.840]  that even his own party was going to impeach him for these criminal acts and yet today we don't even
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:10.480]  have the republicans trying and we know that the democrats wouldn't impeach the obama administration
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:16.080]  and of course they are ultimately responsible when the irs underneath them does these types
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:21.280]  of things when it's brought to light and they don't prosecute they own those crimes the justice
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:26.640]  department owns those crimes that they decide not to bring prosecution against that well one of the
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:33.520]  things i thought was interesting that i found out recently and didn't know but back in the 1930s
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:42.560]  the irs when it was created it was created as a corporation in the philippines yeah i hadn't
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:47.280]  heard that before well the the simple fact of matter is that if you look at the amount of money
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:52.000]  that comes from our income taxes that does not run the government it basically pays the interest
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:57.040]  on the debt we are essentially on an interest only loan from the federal reserve it was created
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:02.080]  about the same time as the federal reserve so we're basically on interest only loan it's a balloon
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:06.960]  note and it's going to turn out just like we saw happen in greece where they came in and now they're
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:14.560]  taking massive amounts of hard assets after getting the country onto this debt chain and letting it
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:20.320]  run and run and the bills piling up that's why so many candidates independent parties like libertarian
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:26.160]  party i remember harry brown i remember uh ron paul talking about how get rid of the income tax get
[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:32.160]  rid of the irs and all you have to do to replace the money that the irs is bringing in is to roll
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:37.840]  government back to where it was about five years ago that's how rapidly this government is growing
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:44.400]  and that's how little this uh of money that is being supplied by the irs for all the harassment
[01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:50.480]  it really isn't about revenue it really is an instrument of political control uh was there
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:58.400]  anything else you want to say rob yeah i just hope that our people of america will have strong enough
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:02.960]  something inside and they'll help us take back the country absolutely yeah it's absolutely amazing
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:07.680]  when we see that they are using things like a gift tax as they point as we point out earlier we
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:12.240]  talked about that article hasn't been used since 1982 it was declared as unconstitutional
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:18.880]  by the supreme court yet they simply do it they're charging people 12 times uh the amount of fines that
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:25.120]  were put in under obama care just because they can they do whatever they wish uh let's go to brad
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:31.680]  in louisiana brad you want to talk about artificial intelligence go ahead yes dave thank you um
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:37.280]  artificial intelligence is a scary subject uh primarily because i feel like the morality
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:43.760]  and the ethics that's going to be defined are integrated into this artificial intelligence
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:51.120]  is being uh programmed by unethical and immoral people and they're uh the propagation of these
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:57.280]  programs i believe is uh is due to their own deep rooted acknowledgement of their own lack of
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:03.520]  intelligence and ability and you know we have the the constitution here in the united states but
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:08.800]  i believe that the government is separate from the united states today there is a distinction
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:15.520]  there is a difference like alex says the war is on and their constitution is one sentence do what
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:22.960]  that will shall be the whole of the law and that was a quote from alistair krally which goes to uh
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:28.640]  underscore my belief that it is an entirely sinister and satanic movement thank you david yeah
[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:32.160]  absolutely and you know when you look at artificial intelligence you understand that when they're
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:35.520]  doing this data mining when they're doing the pre-crime analysis when they're going to flag
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:39.920]  somebody it's going to be done by and it's not generalized artificial intelligence it'll be
[01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:44.800]  specific artificial intelligence but the computer will spit these names out just like the name that
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:49.760]  came out and if you've ever seen the movie brazil you know it comes out it's a buttle and this guy
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:54.240]  they're actually looking for a guy named tuttle who really hadn't done anything either but that's
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:58.560]  what's going to happen it's going to be spit out by the computer and these people are going to not
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:04.400]  question the presumptions that cause that name to come out so anybody can put any kind of criteria
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:10.560]  they want in there and as you correctly pointed out there is no ethical connection to so many of
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:14.000]  the different technologies that we're doing whether or not it's artificial intelligence or
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:20.960]  whether it is bioengineering or nanotechnology there's so many different areas that our government
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:27.040]  is weaponizing and creating these technologies that have the the possibility of getting out of
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:33.360]  control and taking down most of humanity giga death is the way hugo daguerre has talked about
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:37.920]  an out of control artificial intelligence sorry to the rest of the callers that's all the time we
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:44.320]  have for today again if you'll join us tomorrow at 11 central we'll be right back here on the
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:58:08.080]  alex joneshow and alex will be joining us with live reports from europe stay tuned we'll be back then
