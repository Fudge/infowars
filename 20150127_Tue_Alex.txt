[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.480 --> 00:20.960]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:20.960 --> 00:30.000]  jones welcome ladies and gentlemen it is already
[00:30.000 --> 00:39.920]  tuesday it's tuesday the 27th day of january 2015 i'm your host alex jones
[00:39.920 --> 00:43.600]  we're going to be live here lord willing for the next three hours and we
[00:43.600 --> 00:49.520]  have a jam-packed transmission we have a whole bunch of different guests
[00:49.520 --> 00:53.280]  joining us we have the man responsible for putting i guess it's going to be
[00:53.280 --> 00:57.600]  more than 50 billboards up around the united states the last year promoting
[00:57.600 --> 01:01.360]  info wars dot com and this radio show and that spurred
[01:01.360 --> 01:04.640]  other people who were trying to discover their identities if they want the
[01:04.640 --> 01:09.040]  attention who are copying him and putting him up as well
[01:09.040 --> 01:12.720]  now hundreds and hundreds of billboards as we speak
[01:12.720 --> 01:17.200]  in almost every city of the united states except where i live
[01:17.200 --> 01:20.240]  i've had affiliates before three different times by billboards
[01:20.240 --> 01:23.840]  but it is strange that they say a prophet is not known in his own country
[01:23.840 --> 01:28.720]  i'm not saying i'm a prophet but the saying certainly goes to that
[01:28.720 --> 01:32.480]  that when you actually live in a town or a place people don't
[01:32.480 --> 01:36.400]  take you as seriously as say people in other cities other states other
[01:36.400 --> 01:40.480]  countries or maybe the listeners just think hey he's
[01:40.480 --> 01:43.040]  on the radio so what we don't need to wake anybody else up
[01:43.040 --> 01:46.720]  i'm not complaining it's just interesting human psychology so he's popping
[01:46.720 --> 01:49.680]  in for about 10 15 minutes and then we've got
[01:49.680 --> 01:57.040]  joseph curl who with the good graces and in a nice nod from matt drudge
[01:57.040 --> 02:02.800]  created a kind of republican style constitutionalist style clone of the
[02:02.800 --> 02:06.960]  drudge report dot com on the washington post
[02:06.960 --> 02:12.960]  and uh or the washington times i can't a big difference and it's called
[02:12.960 --> 02:18.480]  right reed over at the washington times and
[02:18.480 --> 02:22.000]  joe kerls has done a lot of work for drudge for decades since it was first
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.040]  around he was over at the washington times so now we've
[02:25.040 --> 02:28.640]  got joseph curl from the washington times dot com which he never left
[02:28.640 --> 02:32.480]  he's just focusing on that now joining us to give us his view
[02:32.480 --> 02:35.680]  on inside the beltway i mean joe kerls been to the white house hundreds of
[02:35.680 --> 02:38.720]  times he's got all the inside connections
[02:38.720 --> 02:43.040]  or if it's hundreds of times i know under bush some like scores of times
[02:43.040 --> 02:46.960]  and he's got a lot of different contacts he's
[02:46.960 --> 02:50.400]  there every day thousands of times at capitol hill and
[02:50.400 --> 02:55.120]  in the beltway is my main point over the last 30 years of covering
[02:55.120 --> 02:58.880]  politics and he's going to give us his take on where the republican leadership
[02:58.880 --> 03:05.280]  is really going to go john bainer who will not repeal obama care who will not
[03:05.280 --> 03:09.360]  try to prosecute obama for any of his vengazi crimes or
[03:09.360 --> 03:13.120]  the irs gate the nsa gate the list goes on and on
[03:13.120 --> 03:17.920]  he won't do anything about the open borders
[03:17.920 --> 03:21.840]  treasonous policy that's taking place we're going to find out from joe kerl
[03:21.840 --> 03:26.160]  the inside beltway scoop with his ear to the ground on what he thinks is coming
[03:26.160 --> 03:29.120]  in the future and a lot more so we'll discuss the political
[03:29.120 --> 03:35.360]  realignment with joe kerl of right read dot com
[03:35.360 --> 03:40.400]  and that is linked up on the washington times dot com a

[09:18.000 --> 09:23.440]  property and justice and we know historically
[09:23.440 --> 09:30.080]  what works we know time and time again that collectivism leads
[09:30.080 --> 09:33.440]  to all-out nightmarish enslavement and
[09:33.440 --> 09:39.840]  ruination again we have a giant broadcast coming up today leon macadoo
[09:39.840 --> 09:43.520]  is at an international conference that's based here in austin texas is being
[09:43.520 --> 09:46.960]  covered by wired magazine the bbc you name it
[09:46.960 --> 09:51.440]  it is the biggest basically anti-ai conference
[09:51.440 --> 09:54.960]  pretty much ever held with top scientists there's the headline
[09:54.960 --> 09:58.320]  ai has arrived and that really worries the world's
[09:58.320 --> 10:03.040]  brightest minds and leon has been going there the last few days
[10:03.040 --> 10:08.720]  she's going back as well she's going to be joining us in studio today it has a
[10:08.720 --> 10:11.680]  bunch of the interviews that are going to be airing over the next few days
[10:11.680 --> 10:16.320]  on the nightly news but she talked to the author of artificial intelligence
[10:16.320 --> 10:18.720]  the book of course that was going to be made to a film
[10:18.720 --> 10:23.280]  by stanley kubrick but was later made into a film after he died mysteriously
[10:23.280 --> 10:27.360]  artificial intelligence was made into a film by stevens billberg
[10:27.360 --> 10:30.560]  she talked to the author of ai and others she's going to be joining us
[10:30.560 --> 10:34.640]  at the bottom of the second hour robert brogue
[10:34.640 --> 10:39.280]  who's a true trailblazer has put up scores of huge billboards all over the
[10:39.280 --> 10:42.160]  united states even though he's not really a rich man
[10:42.160 --> 10:44.720]  we didn't know who he was the last six months but just kept hearing about the
[10:44.720 --> 10:47.840]  billboards they're all over the country and now something
[10:47.840 --> 10:50.240]  interesting happened other people are imitating it
[10:50.240 --> 10:53.920]  putting up similar billboards in their cities or in the same city
[10:53.920 --> 10:57.680]  so a chain reaction is beginning and we need to really
[10:57.680 --> 11:01.520]  get the artwork he has and get with our graphics department as i said about a
[11:01.520 --> 11:05.520]  month ago and just create the pdf files for info wars
[11:05.520 --> 11:08.640]  dot com and do the work for folks so they can just
[11:08.640 --> 11:13.360]  contact their local billboard company and put them up i mean now the billboard
[11:13.360 --> 11:16.960]  industry has collapsed for all intents and purposes
[11:16.960 --> 11:23.280]  because of the internet taking over and also because of the fact that the
[11:23.280 --> 11:26.400]  economy is in trouble so billboards that would cost five
[11:26.400 --> 11:30.080]  thousand dollars that are in major cities off major
[11:30.080 --> 11:33.440]  highways that hundreds of thousands of people will see a week
[11:33.440 --> 11:37.120]  you can get those for basically the cost of
[11:37.120 --> 11:41.680]  the graphics the cost of the message we're talking a thousand two thousand
[11:41.680 --> 11:46.000]  dollars and reach hundreds of thousands of people
[11:46.000 --> 11:52.400]  we don't have the capital or the money to do this ourselves nationwide
[11:52.400 --> 11:55.840]  but i am today when i get off here we're going to make the graphics in the
[11:55.840 --> 11:58.960]  graphics department we're going to basically just imitate that one
[11:58.960 --> 12:02.800]  and we are i think it's excellent and then we are going to create a page on
[12:02.800 --> 12:06.400]  info wars dot com and prisonplanet.com
[12:06.400 --> 12:09.840]  where we're going to put different billboards up there
[12:09.840 --> 12:13.920]  and you know it doesn't just have to be info wars dot com we'll also have some
[12:13.920 --> 12:17.120]  just saying remember when america was a free country
[12:17.120 --> 12:21.680]  restore the republic and then maybe
[12:21.680 --> 12:25.440]  well i don't know who else's site we can link to that doesn't really make sense
[12:25.440 --> 12:29.120]  maybe just have george washington up there and say remember when
[12:29.120 --> 12:32.400]  we wanted to build a free country doesn't mean we ever had one we just wanted
[12:32.400 --> 12:36.080]  to build one and those ideas did build the greatest
[12:36.080 --> 12:39.760]  experiment in liberty we've ever seen we never got to the ultimate goal of a
[12:39.760 --> 12:43.280]  perfect utopia of freedom but we wrote the book worldwide
[12:43.280 --> 12:46.960]  on what the standards of freedom success and prosperity are
[12:46.960 --> 12:50.320]  because out of freedom comes incredible prosperity
[12:50.320 --> 12:53.920]  the problem is then great decadence as we you know
[12:53.920 --> 12:59.680]  constantly warn and history shows incredible decadence then follows the
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.000]  corruption moves in then the tyranny to secure the ill-gotten
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.840]  gains of the insiders who then waged jihad
[13:07.840 --> 13:13.520]  and war and a crusade choose your word on any independent wealth or ideas they
[13:13.520 --> 13:16.720]  do not control that's the problem with letting
[13:16.720 --> 13:22.480]  hardcore corruption run rampant you can have big mega bankers creating
[13:22.480 --> 13:26.480]  two thousand trillion dollars in fake derivatives and signing us on to it but
[13:26.480 --> 13:30.400]  then if they catch an 18 year old drinking a
[13:30.400 --> 13:35.600]  beer on his back porch he'll be arrested the system's all there to throw the
[13:35.600 --> 13:38.000]  book at people that have really done nothing wrong
[13:38.000 --> 13:42.320]  or victimless crimes but then to exalt the great tyrants they say
[13:42.320 --> 13:46.240]  if you're going to steal steal big don't steal a thousand dollars you'll go to
[13:46.240 --> 13:50.800]  the pen for 20 years steal five billion and they'll make you king
[13:50.800 --> 13:53.520]  and that is really the corruption that we're facing
[13:53.520 --> 13:58.400]  joseph curled of the washington times has launched a
[13:58.400 --> 14:03.840]  powerful new section on the site rightread.com he formally of course
[14:03.840 --> 14:06.800]  worked for about i don't know over a decade with drudge report drudge report
[14:06.800 --> 14:09.840]  dot com and the new site he's got has got the
[14:09.840 --> 14:13.760]  blessing of the big the big man drudge matt drudge and so we're
[14:13.760 --> 14:18.080]  going to get um joe curls take as i said earlier we just joined us
[14:18.080 --> 14:21.360]  on will the republican leadership get away
[14:21.360 --> 14:28.240]  with the unprecedented betrayal of the libertarian tea party movement
[14:28.240 --> 14:33.760]  that put them in power back in november in the house and senate well we now
[14:33.760 --> 14:36.800]  know it's open borders certifying everything obama's
[14:36.800 --> 14:40.160]  done as a dictator he is a dictator in action doesn't mean he'll stay in
[14:40.160 --> 14:42.720]  office just means he's operating as a dictator even
[14:42.720 --> 14:46.240]  jonathan turley and other liberals admit that three times worse than bush in
[14:46.240 --> 14:49.040]  his words when it comes to eviscerating the constitution
[14:49.040 --> 14:53.040]  and just sets that precedent digs the hole deeper
[14:53.040 --> 14:57.840]  open borders fiat gun control fiat energy policies
[14:57.840 --> 15:01.760]  obama care it's all just racing forward
[15:01.760 --> 15:06.240]  he's going to be joining us jacari jackson will also pop in with his take
[15:06.240 --> 15:09.600]  on the political realignment halfway into that interview
[15:09.600 --> 15:15.920]  coming up today now before we go any further here
[15:15.920 --> 15:19.920]  let me just run through some of the news we're going to be breaking
[15:19.920 --> 15:26.080]  down today the blazio ordered yesterday in definite street
[15:26.080 --> 15:32.080]  shut down tonight during the blizzard well the blizzard didn't really come

[15:36.480 --> 15:40.080]  but notice it first they said the new york times last year that there'd be no
[15:40.080 --> 15:44.160]  more snow in new york because of quote global warming man made global warming
[15:44.160 --> 15:47.440]  then they said our computer models are so good it shows we're gonna have a giant
[15:47.440 --> 15:52.560]  blizzard the worst on history the worst on record and it wasn't that
[15:52.560 --> 15:57.920]  quomo bans travel in snowy new york in your car you're committing a crime
[15:57.920 --> 16:01.440]  was the headline the statement by the governor
[16:01.440 --> 16:04.640]  but here's paul watson's article today on info wars
[16:04.640 --> 16:11.600]  dot com forecasters fail on blizzard yet we're supposed to believe 100 year
[16:11.600 --> 16:15.760]  climate models meteorologists apologize for snowmageddon
[16:15.760 --> 16:21.120]  failed predictions and here is cbs news basically saying the same thing
[16:21.120 --> 16:24.800]  storm fails to live up to predictions in some areas as national weather service
[16:24.800 --> 16:29.200]  meteorologist apologizes hey weather prediction has gotten
[16:29.200 --> 16:32.560]  better and better but you know living here in texas hey if you like the
[16:32.560 --> 16:35.520]  weather it's about to change if you don't like the weather it's about to
[16:35.520 --> 16:40.640]  change the only thing that continues to really
[16:40.640 --> 16:44.720]  change obviously is the change that's why saying now it's climate change oh my
[16:44.720 --> 16:48.160]  gosh we can't allow it well there's always climate change i mean this is
[16:48.160 --> 16:52.000]  this is asinine and every time it's hot in summer they say it's global warming
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.920]  every time it's cold they say it's global warming it's just a total fraud
[16:57.920 --> 17:01.680]  but that's just some of the news on that front i've basically already
[17:01.680 --> 17:06.160]  covered that but subway open after new york city dodges historic
[17:06.160 --> 17:13.280]  blizzard now continuing here aircraft carrier stennis has
[17:13.280 --> 17:20.320]  biggest ordinance unload since 2010 why engage in such a major
[17:20.320 --> 17:26.000]  weapons loading process now and we're talking heavy bombs for what you take
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.760]  out governments with well yeah they're gonna probably have to do that to
[17:29.760 --> 17:33.200]  syria maybe even russia you know here's here's what i want to talk
[17:33.200 --> 17:37.200]  about after the break leech throughout history think they're
[17:37.200 --> 17:40.720]  invincible think they're infallible when they have success after success look
[17:40.720 --> 17:44.080]  at hitler in world war two had four or five successes in poland and
[17:44.080 --> 17:49.120]  zeckoslovakia and austria and danzig and then in
[17:49.120 --> 17:55.840]  france i said six victories and then all he had was defeats from north africa
[17:55.840 --> 18:00.160]  to russia to the battle of the blitz to the battle of the bolds
[18:00.160 --> 18:06.560]  it was just defeat defeat defeat defeat defeat and these elites i don't care
[18:06.560 --> 18:12.000]  how fancy their ai prediction computers are there's still human error in there
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.360]  and they are endangering the planet according to every major analyst out
[18:17.360 --> 18:20.800]  there who's not on an establishment payroll
[18:20.800 --> 18:25.600]  mainline political professors mainline history professors mainline economists
[18:25.600 --> 18:29.440]  former editor not not an editor the editor of the wall street journal the
[18:29.440 --> 18:32.480]  father ergonomics just says our government you know brookings
[18:32.480 --> 18:36.000]  institute you name it says our government is completely
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  insane and super dangerous well i don't need him to tell me that but the point
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.200]  is he's an intellectual from the inside
[18:43.200 --> 18:48.960]  and just just just basically starts laughing on air now it's so insane
[18:48.960 --> 18:54.880]  us troops and mercenaries are battling russian spit snats in ukraine
[18:54.880 --> 18:59.040]  that's basically like texas eastern ukraine would be like of mexico
[18:59.040 --> 19:02.960]  tried to retake texas and the un had foreign troops
[19:02.960 --> 19:06.560]  say from china backing up the mexican army
[19:06.560 --> 19:10.480]  and they'd driven all the way up to the colorada border and all the way up to
[19:10.480 --> 19:13.200]  the indiana border and all the way up to the illinois border
[19:13.200 --> 19:19.680]  and we're just blowing everything up and then calling the us tyrants i mean
[19:19.680 --> 19:22.560]  it's and you can call the us evil if you want
[19:22.560 --> 19:27.040]  there were six flags over texas mexico couldn't hold anything but a couple of
[19:27.040 --> 19:30.320]  missions spain couldn't hold anything and close most
[19:30.320 --> 19:35.120]  their missions before they left mexico or got overthrown
[19:35.120 --> 19:40.080]  so mexico has pretty much zero claim on texas
[19:40.080 --> 19:44.960]  western ukrainians have always been trying to take eastern ukraine that's
[19:44.960 --> 19:47.520]  russian and the russians have always been trying to take western
[19:47.520 --> 19:50.080]  both sides are wrong both sides are killing each other
[19:50.080 --> 19:54.160]  both sides are idiots the point is though the west is exacerbating that
[19:54.160 --> 20:00.320]  and george soros says to bring the whole place down and start world war three
[20:00.320 --> 20:04.000]  what's the best way to keep secrets for somebody why don't you give them something
[20:04.000 --> 20:07.120]  that they want so bad that they don't care what you're hiding
[20:07.120 --> 20:11.760]  the year is 2007 and 20 percent of the state of california is employed in real

[25:05.280 --> 25:09.040]  the Benghazi attack and calls on the smoking gun proving that they were
[25:09.040 --> 25:12.960]  engaged in a cover-up DEA cameras tracking hundreds
[25:12.960 --> 25:16.640]  of millions of americans journeys across the U.S.
[25:16.640 --> 25:21.040]  with license plate reading cameras I know I told everybody about that 18 years
[25:21.040 --> 25:27.040]  ago but now it's in the financial times and it's
[25:27.040 --> 25:32.080]  now in it world and the LA Times so now it exists
[25:32.080 --> 25:34.640]  just like they now admit your television watches and listens to you in
[25:34.640 --> 25:38.160]  live time and there are cancer viruses added to most major
[25:38.160 --> 25:40.480]  vaccines there's nothing funner than having an
[25:40.480 --> 25:44.480]  excruciating death of you or your child from a loving globalist
[25:44.480 --> 25:47.520]  injection but again don't be an extremist
[25:47.520 --> 25:52.160]  stress the system that's coming up we're also going
[25:52.160 --> 25:57.280]  to get into the CIA whistleblower Jeffrey Stirling found guilty on all
[25:57.280 --> 26:00.560]  counts lots of whistleblowers and journalists
[26:00.560 --> 26:05.280]  being sent to prison now in the free country so that's coming up
[26:05.280 --> 26:11.200]  NASA test Mars helicopter report Indiana governor
[26:11.200 --> 26:15.600]  wants to launch state-run news site well the police he's being honest about it
[26:15.600 --> 26:19.120]  but it's got the left and right upset that's a small
[26:19.120 --> 26:24.720]  shmattering of the news that we are going to be covering
[26:24.720 --> 26:28.720]  today Libyan luxury hotel attacked in the name of
[26:28.720 --> 26:33.280]  intelligence operative who's known CIA it's always the
[26:33.280 --> 26:37.600]  same it's like the attackers in Paris were working for
[26:37.600 --> 26:42.160]  Amaralaki at his training base where the other Patsy's were trained
[26:42.160 --> 26:46.400]  publicly and he is CIA and does hang out at the Pentagon all the time
[26:46.400 --> 26:49.520]  and that's in the London Guardian and Associated Press I mean you just
[26:49.520 --> 26:53.360]  can't make that up I mean I'm not the one saying that if you're a new listener
[26:53.360 --> 26:56.400]  believe me I can't believe it either it's but it's admitted
[26:56.400 --> 27:03.280]  so Libyan luxury hotel attacked police want cop tracking at banned
[27:03.280 --> 27:06.320]  while they use the very same technology to track the public
[27:06.320 --> 27:10.480]  hey I'm against tracking the cops and the citizens
[27:10.480 --> 27:14.160]  and the problem is this stuff's already been turned loose so
[27:14.160 --> 27:20.000]  it's going to roast everybody's bacon and there's no pun intended on that one
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  it's going to roast everybody's behind this this if we don't get a hold of all
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.960]  this right now and and really as a culture
[27:26.960 --> 27:30.320]  through the free market stop financially supporting
[27:30.320 --> 27:34.240]  organizations that are engaged in total surveillance
[27:34.240 --> 27:37.440]  and and companies and products that do it we're done
[27:37.440 --> 27:40.880]  we're done and that doesn't mean I'm again on some high horse and I'm a
[27:40.880 --> 27:43.760]  purist and I have all the answers I just know
[27:43.760 --> 27:49.280]  this is a human society wrecking ball according to every metric and every
[27:49.280 --> 27:51.920]  expert no one is even debating that fact that
[27:51.920 --> 27:54.880]  you better get your seat belt on ladies and gentlemen
[27:54.880 --> 27:58.640]  and for the public that isn't even aware of what time of day it is
[27:58.640 --> 28:06.160]  they are like lambs to the slaughter and there's seven billion plus people
[28:06.160 --> 28:09.760]  that in a crisis not knowing what they're doing
[28:09.760 --> 28:14.800]  are 10,000 times more dangerous than a stampede of
[28:14.800 --> 28:18.400]  cows that can run through your town and kill hundreds of people that happen in
[28:18.400 --> 28:23.440]  cases out west cases of stampedes in major cities like Chicago that killed
[28:23.440 --> 28:26.640]  more people than the biggest gun battles
[28:26.640 --> 28:30.480]  cow stampede's causing giant fires that burn down whole towns or cities or
[28:30.480 --> 28:34.000]  part of cities when I say they're 10,000 times that human
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.840]  stampeding or 10,000 more times how about a nuclear war
[28:37.840 --> 28:41.200]  during the stampede during a crisis during a breakdown
[28:41.200 --> 28:44.240]  all these tv shows all these movies all these apocalypse
[28:44.240 --> 28:49.040]  dystopic films road warrior you name it does not even hold
[28:49.040 --> 28:53.840]  a mere candle to what the real explosion will look like when seven and a half
[28:53.840 --> 28:56.960]  billion people go crazy and no amount of ai
[28:56.960 --> 29:00.480]  no amount of swat teams no amount of poison in the water
[29:00.480 --> 29:03.920]  no amount of gmo no amount of prozac in the water
[29:03.920 --> 29:08.800]  is going to stop this because the system is engineering a controlled collapse
[29:08.800 --> 29:11.680]  there's a very good chance it's going to get out of hand
[29:11.680 --> 29:16.080]  they see the world is unsustainable and seven and a half million people
[29:16.080 --> 29:19.760]  as a dangerous scourge and quite frankly the way the establishments help
[29:19.760 --> 29:25.280]  grease the skids for this it is incredibly dangerous
[29:25.280 --> 29:29.760]  but when you look at the elite who are the worst of the worst running all this
[29:29.760 --> 29:33.280]  they have dug their own pit and there's an article today about the elite trying
[29:33.280 --> 29:36.560]  to run for the hills everywhere to hide out from the global depression they
[29:36.560 --> 29:39.600]  helped engineer well you guys said the global depression would bring in your
[29:39.600 --> 29:41.680]  world government said it's going to bring in world
[29:41.680 --> 29:45.360]  arm again probably we'll break down the arms built up against

[33:57.600 --> 34:04.480]  how dare the neo eugenicist globalist who wish to create a

[34:09.120 --> 34:13.120]  call themselves progressives they are the progression

[34:17.440 --> 34:26.400]  mind of god's creation let me talk about the heavy issue right now
[34:27.680 --> 34:34.400]  world war three i do not believe that the elites controlling the anglo-american
[34:34.400 --> 34:37.200]  establishment that are the most intelligent and most
[34:37.200 --> 34:42.800]  of virulent of the three global crime syndicates
[34:42.800 --> 34:48.000]  i do not believe that they want to have a nuclear war
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.920]  but history and common sense has shown
[34:51.920 --> 34:56.080]  that though they are the most sophisticated
[34:56.080 --> 34:59.920]  predatory group the world has ever produced
[34:59.920 --> 35:03.920]  that humanity has ever produced and that our decadence
[35:03.920 --> 35:08.080]  and our slovenliness has allowed to develop
[35:08.080 --> 35:14.160]  this cancer
[35:14.160 --> 35:19.200]  is rationalizing to itself that it has a plan
[35:19.200 --> 35:24.480]  that will end up empowering humanity when clearly their entire
[35:24.480 --> 35:28.640]  bent their entire bearing their entire gearing
[35:28.640 --> 35:34.640]  is for destroying peace destroying liberty destroying progress
[35:34.640 --> 35:40.720]  world government was established by the rockefellers with the
[35:40.720 --> 35:44.800]  league of nations after world war one
[35:44.880 --> 35:49.520]  and was the chrysalis to then form the united nations and allied groups
[35:49.520 --> 35:53.440]  the un is mainly a diversionary body so people think it's an ineffectual world
[35:53.440 --> 35:57.040]  government group while the imf world bank xm bank
[35:57.040 --> 36:03.280]  and international secret boards the naftan gat boards the
[36:03.280 --> 36:06.880]  pacific partnership boards they're all completely secret on record
[36:06.880 --> 36:09.200]  and the new york times has the headline it's totally secret none of your
[36:09.200 --> 36:14.080]  business but that it will now tell congress what to do
[36:14.080 --> 36:17.040]  the tpp
[36:17.680 --> 36:20.400]  and the rest of it
[36:21.040 --> 36:24.800]  and they just tell the childlike public oh that doesn't exist children
[36:24.800 --> 36:27.200]  while there's no world government being formed and then now they're like oh
[36:27.200 --> 36:29.440]  there's a world government but it wants to help you
[36:29.440 --> 36:34.480]  no it doesn't it wants to bomb into the stone age
[36:34.480 --> 36:37.920]  the family the individual the spark of liberty
[36:37.920 --> 36:41.360]  because free will gets in the way of the robotic
[36:41.360 --> 36:48.560]  hell world they're building the trans specific partnership is
[36:48.560 --> 36:51.920]  a tyranny out of this world but it's all done by men and women in suits and
[36:51.920 --> 36:55.520]  it's all secret and then the lapdog media will only tell you that it's
[36:55.520 --> 36:58.480]  secret for your own good and so that's the end of it
[36:58.480 --> 37:01.520]  and then you wonder why we can't repeal open borders
[37:01.520 --> 37:05.520]  that aren't even a law you wonder why we can't stop international gun treaties
[37:05.520 --> 37:08.640]  that obama is now implementing by fiat you wonder why
[37:08.640 --> 37:12.000]  nato is commanding our military you wonder why our own military doesn't want
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.280]  to fight for al-qaeda but is ordered to do so
[37:15.280 --> 37:18.560]  it's because we don't run our country anymore
[37:18.560 --> 37:22.240]  for all intents and purposes the congress is about
[37:22.240 --> 37:28.480]  90 percent and counting vestigial vestigial if you're a new listener or
[37:28.480 --> 37:31.680]  maybe you don't know what vestigial means
[37:31.680 --> 37:36.240]  you ever noticed a dog has what they call a dewclaw up on the side of its
[37:36.240 --> 37:40.400]  leg back from when it had a different type of
[37:40.400 --> 37:43.520]  paw they believe where it was it was more like a hand
[37:43.520 --> 37:46.880]  and it's vestigial it has no use but it's it's it's up there
[37:46.880 --> 37:53.600]  whales have fingers in their flippers that are vestigial pretty soon spines
[37:53.600 --> 37:57.680]  will be vestigial in humans uh i'm not even joking about this one
[37:57.680 --> 38:00.960]  sexual organs under the sexless globalist plan
[38:00.960 --> 38:05.920]  will be vestigial a sperm are already 87 percent
[38:05.920 --> 38:10.160]  non-active and basically vestigial in western men
[38:10.160 --> 38:13.600]  doesn't matter if you're black or white your sperm counts dropping and
[38:13.600 --> 38:17.440]  genetically each generation the genitalia are becoming smaller
[38:17.440 --> 38:23.440]  we are under bio-chem attack hope you enjoy it
[38:23.440 --> 38:27.440]  the wages of the new world order is absolute bloody death
[38:27.440 --> 38:30.880]  slowly carried out on you and your children remember the globalists like to
[38:30.880 --> 38:36.400]  do these things delicately lovingly they love their work
[38:36.400 --> 38:42.400]  but they've run up against russia who is incredibly corrupt incredibly mafia
[38:42.400 --> 38:48.320]  incredibly primitive but very intelligent scientifically
[38:48.320 --> 38:51.760]  and russia is being bullied right now
[38:51.760 --> 38:55.680]  and uh in fact let's play the clip from it's been out for days we played on the
[38:55.680 --> 39:00.800]  nightly news on this was sunday we had on the radio but
[39:00.800 --> 39:04.480]  the the clip has been on info wars.com since sunday but i wanted to play it
[39:04.480 --> 39:09.120]  here the media said terror attack in ukrainian city and what it is is a
[39:09.120 --> 39:12.880]  battle between western mercs and russian
[39:12.880 --> 39:16.960]  spitznats in traditionally for 500 years an area that was russia
[39:16.960 --> 39:20.400]  it's been taken away from them a bunch they fought for it
[39:20.400 --> 39:23.760]  i think it's 13 times they've had 13 major wars they've lost
[39:23.760 --> 39:27.680]  millions russia's lost millions in Crimean wars
[39:27.680 --> 39:31.360]  there's been i think three wars called Crimean wars
[39:31.360 --> 39:34.320]  the Crimean the first Crimean what is the great Crimean
[39:34.320 --> 39:37.760]  and the i forget all the names you can look it up yourself but but more than
[39:37.760 --> 39:42.160]  more than 13 major wars with millions dead
[39:42.160 --> 39:45.520]  it'd be like if the u.s was a thousand years old
[39:45.520 --> 39:52.320]  and we'd fought 13 wars for texas it only fought really two
[39:52.320 --> 39:55.360]  one under texas one under the u.s against mexico
[39:55.360 --> 39:59.440]  that's why the marines say from the halls of montezuma
[39:59.440 --> 40:05.520]  to the shores of tripoli we will fight our country's battles well you know
[40:05.520 --> 40:09.680]  what's going on the u.s is in there the cia admitted this
[40:09.680 --> 40:16.000]  last year almost 12 months ago back in february
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.120]  that yeah we spent five billion dollars over there and we've got the cia
[40:19.120 --> 40:22.560]  commanding mercenary teams up against the russians
[40:22.560 --> 40:27.040]  we are fighting russian spitznats right now
[40:27.040 --> 40:32.320]  our government our crazy evil government is in russian territory
[40:32.320 --> 40:36.320]  in land they've had taken from them over and over again and i'm not pro russia
[40:36.320 --> 40:39.440]  or pro ukrainian i don't have a dog in this fight i've studied it
[40:39.440 --> 40:43.760]  the russians have committed ungodly
[40:44.560 --> 40:49.680]  barbarous abuses on western ukrainians for at least 500 years
[40:49.680 --> 40:54.880]  the western ukrainians have committed barbarous tyranny and barbarous mass
[40:54.880 --> 41:00.080]  murders against the russians in the east it's because it's two countries they've
[41:00.080 --> 41:03.840]  been fighting each other forever it needs to be divided
[41:03.840 --> 41:07.440]  it's that simple and it's been divided many times in history
[41:07.440 --> 41:12.480]  hitler spilt into ukraine with the western ukrainians and killed millions
[41:12.480 --> 41:16.080]  then the russians poured in and killed millions it just goes back and forth
[41:16.080 --> 41:18.720]  they hate each other when they're not marrying each other
[41:18.720 --> 41:22.160]  they're genetically almost the same people it is so
[41:22.160 --> 41:26.480]  stupid just like george soros trying to start a war with the police
[41:26.480 --> 41:30.800]  and to start a war you know black on white and vice versa
[41:30.800 --> 41:34.480]  yeah there's beefs on both sides yeah there's problems with the police
[41:34.480 --> 41:39.120]  yeah but when the bad guy wants you to have a civil war with them
[41:39.120 --> 41:43.120]  just like in ukraine yeah the russians have done bad stuff yeah the western
[41:43.120 --> 41:48.240]  ukrainians have done bad stuff but george soros and the cia spent five
[41:48.240 --> 41:53.680]  billion can we play the head us envoy to the EU and we can play her saying we
[41:53.680 --> 41:57.520]  spent five billion in ukraine i mean to do this i mean they bragged
[41:57.520 --> 42:02.320]  that they installed an unelected government and now
[42:02.320 --> 42:07.360]  they're sending armored vehicles tanks tens of thousands of us troops on the
[42:07.360 --> 42:10.080]  polish border building up right by
[42:10.080 --> 42:15.200]  ukraine and russia saying it's for russia nato generals that look so soft and
[42:15.200 --> 42:17.680]  weak going we're ready for war with the russians
[42:17.680 --> 42:21.040]  you don't talk like that even during the cold war
[42:21.040 --> 42:24.080]  you don't shoot your mouth off about nuclear war
[42:24.080 --> 42:28.800]  the russians aren't doing it do you understand
[42:28.800 --> 42:33.040]  you understand you soft fake pieces of garbage
[42:33.040 --> 42:37.280]  the point is is that there are us mercs and us troops
[42:37.280 --> 42:40.160]  dying just like when they launched an attack on russia now areas
[42:40.160 --> 42:45.360]  in osetia and abkhazia south osetia and abkhazia
[42:45.360 --> 42:49.440]  in 2008 and then the news announced russia attacked
[42:49.440 --> 42:53.840]  uh georgia no they didn't it's just not true
[42:53.840 --> 42:56.800]  just like obama care didn't let you keep your doctor and didn't cut your
[42:56.800 --> 43:00.880]  bill in half it doubled it or tripled it
[43:00.880 --> 43:04.080]  raising the debt limit raises the debt limit two plus two equals four
[43:04.080 --> 43:08.800]  i don't care what cnn says i'm sick of it and you should be sick of it

[46:08.960 --> 46:12.960]  here's the next headline in full wars dot com paul craig roberts
[46:12.960 --> 46:16.640]  russia in the crosshairs washington's attack on russia has moved beyond the
[46:16.640 --> 46:21.520]  boundary of the absurd in the realm of insanity and it is a scary article and

[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:57.680]  uh... that's a robert bow and then we've also got uh... leon macadoo who's
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:00.880]  been following the big a i conference here in austin
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:04.160]  with serious warnings from these top experts and scientists
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:07.200]  uh... she's going to be spending time with us
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.200]  discussing how humans can engineer a future
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.760]  an architecture of computers that empowers us
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:18.400]  instead of bad humans the elite engineering it with autonomous killer
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:22.480]  drones in fact guys print me articles they got stuff like five years ago about
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.960]  britain's uh...
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.520]  tyranny drone but then they go oh it's it's a
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:30.480]  it's a gaelic word for strength i think they
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.200]  no it's called tyranny it's a spell different i'm gonna give me a break
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:41.440]  a big giant b2 bomber style the killer drone called tyranny
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:45.120]  or is it tyranus it's what it's ridiculous it's like the latin word but
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:48.400]  it's tyranny or tyranus and they go oh no it's a gaelic word
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:51.760]  meaning strength it's it's such a sick joke how they fly on our face
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.080]  and then we got articles like two years ago about the pentagon already
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:57.280]  launching autonomous drones i just want to have those
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.320]  when i get to uh... this stack just to back up what we're gonna say when she

[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.320]  real time so we're not being given this technology

[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:36.080]  uh
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.040]  catching my breath running back in the studio i was feverishly during that
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:45.120]  three-minute break getting ready for the new operation we're going to launch to
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.440]  promote freedom all over the united states
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:54.080]  and show people their real power and that is our plan modeled after one of our
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.040]  listeners to put up billboards all over the country
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:00.800]  that listeners decide to sponsor in their area
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:04.800]  billboards are incredibly inexpensive the billboard market has been collapsed
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.720]  for at least five years you can just basically pay for the artwork
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:12.960]  and get your billboard up we're even going to put data on info wars dot com on
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.800]  this page we're going to build in the next week
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:17.680]  that shows you prices you should be paying by region
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:21.280]  so that it's easy and quick to get the billboards paid for
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:25.520]  you just call give them the money send them the artwork and it's up for a month
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:29.200]  and a lot of times they get busy and then if nobody's paid for a new one
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.560]  they'll just leave it up we've had billboards that have been up for
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:35.920]  six months before one time i paid for one in austin about i don't know eight
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:39.600]  nine years ago and it was up for six months because no one else had bought
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:45.520]  the billboard on shelf lamar that has got to have hundreds of
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.640]  thousands of people a day driving on
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:51.920]  i mean it's one of the most busy thoroughfares let's just say 50 000
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.600]  that they'd be conservative that would have seen it simply amazing i'm not
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.960]  going to sit here and self promote the operation i'm going to get into a bunch
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:03.760]  of news uh coming up but this is the power the french
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:08.240]  resistance basically undermined the nazis to where they easily fell
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:13.120]  once the allies moved into france by handing out pamphlets hanging up signs
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.760]  criticizing the furor letting folks know that it was a tyranny
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:23.120]  simple activism like that scares the system big time
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.520]  so it's important for all of you to have your own youtube your own facebook use
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:31.200]  the globalist platforms there's a reason they censor folks on youtube and
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:34.720]  facebook there's a reason the system doesn't want libertarian
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:39.920]  constitutionalist freedom-based americana pro-family type ideas out there
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.280]  there's a reason the democratic party is trying to make conservatism and
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.960]  libertarianism and being a veteran uh be illegal i mean they openly say it's
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.840]  terrorist the big terror threat is gun owners and veterans
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.520]  and christians there's a reason that for hood last year they told the troops
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:57.440]  you're not allowed to be part of the tea party or evangelical christian will
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:00.080]  court-martial you guess that really happened
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:04.240]  it's because we're the enemy of the globalist that have taken over the
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:08.160]  federal government we're the people that say no to
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.600]  banker bailouts no derivatives no to totally open borders
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:16.320]  no to obama acting like a dictator and and we want obama care repealed but they
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:20.160]  won't do it even though it was written by the insurance companies their
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.480]  profits are up 47 percent just in 2014
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:29.520]  death panels the whole nine yards both parties the leadership level are sold
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.520]  out but the republican leadership barely hung on with the
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:37.120]  constitutional freshman that came in the tea party freshman one more election
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:41.200]  like that they're going to be checkmated what will they do
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.160]  in my view watching them seeing and do it before
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:48.000]  the establishment will activate black ops squads
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.080]  probably foreign corporate mercenaries to carry out terror attacks in the united
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:55.680]  states to blame them on the tea party now democratic
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:00.000]  memos came out four years ago fox news even covered them we covered them
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.720]  say that uh don't worry terror attacks are coming and we're going to blame it
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:08.000]  on domestic groups and demonize them don't
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.440]  worry this is how we're going to get our agenda through don't worry
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:14.400]  you see the democratic party being destroyed being discredited
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.000]  we've got a plan terror attacks are coming very
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  thinly veiled extremely extremely thinly veiled
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.120]  it's really the oldest trick in the book just frame your opposition for a crime
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:33.520]  you know you want to get more money for your uh black dorm
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.920]  just go hang a swastika on your door burn across in the yard turns out
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.560]  almost all of those events attacks on black uh dorms or churches in the last
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:47.680]  20 years have been fake also turns out most attacks on white women that you
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:51.760]  always are hearing about where the black guys carve you know
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:55.680]  whitey on their face or whatever turns out most of those are fake
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:58.720]  turns out most black women claiming white men raped them remember the whole
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:02.800]  lacrosse thing turns out those are fake it's it doesn't matter if they're black
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:06.480]  or they're white or they're whatever cops know this
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:09.600]  most the time when a business gets robbed and something valuable really gets
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:13.040]  taken it's an inside job let's say half the time it is
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.880]  it's either the owner or the employees and most the time they show up somebody
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:20.640]  says they've been raped or whatever it's a made up folks well government does
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:24.240]  that too to create a big pity party and i'm
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:28.560]  telling you look for that to happen so with the censorship we've had
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:33.120]  multiple journalists this week and a cia whistleblower
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.840]  one journalist in fact i'm going to get to liana's report we'll play that later
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:38.640]  i'm meant to play that since sunday make me play that at the bottom of the hour
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:41.280]  guys ahead of lian being in studio with us
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:45.280]  i want to intro her playing that report where you
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:51.200]  retweet on a wiki leak and you get what is it 60 plus months in jail
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.720]  i mean this is happening so all of us need to engage in free speech
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:59.520]  all of us need to flood the system with truth to counter their propaganda
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:05.760]  and joining us is a real hero he doesn't even really want to come on the show
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:11.040]  but robert bow is a hero and he's not a rich guy but he's put up just tons of
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.040]  billboards i don't know the exact number
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.760]  i just keep hearing about him all over the country and now other people are
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:19.360]  sending us photos of other billboards that aren't his
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:23.360]  some of them are just black and white say info wars dot com others are complex
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:29.360]  other huge city murals my son told me that his teacher came in and said i
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:33.120]  saw a huge mural in new york city with your daddy on it info wars dot com it
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.840]  was like 40 feet tall uh my daughter's friend said
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.680]  yeah we were in north carolina and saw a billboard for info wars dot com
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:45.280]  i mean this is happening all over the place and it's zeitgeist
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:49.760]  if people want freedom it's unstoppable and if info wars is that focal point or
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:54.480]  ron paul is or drugs report dot com whatever it is
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:58.240]  if if we're a focal point then we should maximize that
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.360]  and it's dangerous for us to get bigger and more successful but
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.560]  i i don't want to just do this in half measures
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:07.200]  i don't want to just fight tyranny because it makes me look like a hero and
[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:10.960]  we can become successful because liberty is popular i want to really push the
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:14.000]  system i want to really make them uncomfortable
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.440]  i don't have a death wish i love life so much i'm ready to give it up
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:21.520]  i would never commit suicide but i love life so much
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:24.320]  and love my children and your children so much who will live together in the
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:28.960]  future and don't want evil to win and so despise these people
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:32.640]  that i intend to push them until they
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:39.920]  crush me or or or until they
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.480]  back off or we win and maybe i'll never become a big enough
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:47.760]  threat to them to crush me they're trying to politically assassinate info
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.880]  wars dot com and alex jones right now but your prayers your
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.560]  support have given us a shield of defense against that so thank you
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:58.720]  so i don't want to be destroyed but i know if i fly enough missions over
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.760]  enemy territory i'm going to get shot down and that just goes with
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:06.640]  territory and it's not a curse it's a blessing if i get
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:11.920]  destroyed in the service to humanity then then i get to measure up to my
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.320]  ancestors or if i'm victorious that's almost
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:19.280]  ignominious because then you get old you degenerate
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:22.720]  you know you're not perfect whatever it's it's better
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:26.080]  it's better in the service of something so holy
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:30.960]  to end the end be destroyed and i don't want that but in my spirit
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:36.560]  i am ready and willing they could put a gun to my head and say
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:42.640]  deny freedom deny liberty or will kill you and i would
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.520]  never do it because it's the expense of the innocent
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:49.120]  the children and i am not a person that wants to hurt the innocent my
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:56.800]  soul says no now it's robert bro b-r-e-a-u-x
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.360]  very interesting fellow we really appreciate him
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:03.520]  coming on uh sir how me how'd you get this idea we're gonna skip this one
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:07.200]  network break because i kind of held you over
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.960]  how did you get this idea how did you take action and it's
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.720]  it's having a huge effect break it down for us uh
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:18.640]  well you know i've been listening to your show for probably three years now
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.560]  and you've been talking about promoting the show and
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.520]  you know it's great for people out there to
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:29.520]  you know tell others that's a great thing to do but i wanted to bring it to
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:34.000]  the next level i wanted to uh do it on a mass scale
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.920]  and uh we had the ability to do that so we uh i came up with the idea you know
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:43.920]  i think uh god puts ideas in people's heads
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:49.520]  and i decided to act on them and i came up with a very simple
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:55.760]  very simple idea uh it's a it's a good way to promote the show in mass scale
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:59.600]  you know the billboard just says want the truth and it has your website and
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:04.480]  your picture and your name on it and i think the billboards really worked
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:08.160]  real well and uh i'm trying to figure out a way
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:12.400]  to do more of them now to really wake people up
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:16.480]  to get the people off their butts in this country
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:19.520]  and realize what we were facing in this country
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:24.560]  and i'd really like to get the listeners involved because i know they want to
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:28.320]  get involved because i am a listener and i want to get involved in this
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:32.240]  and i think the listeners want to too and i think i have a pretty good idea
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:39.200]  that would be uh very uh not you know wouldn't cost very much
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:43.440]  of money per listener to do this and we could put these things up all over the
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:47.200]  country and we could also have a way to where other
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.320]  people can join in and i'd like to see what other people
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:53.520]  ideas are about this and that's what we're going to do i mean there's a
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.880]  multi-track we could get people to donate directly to you because you know
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:00.800]  how to do it and do it inexpensively you've definitely been very effective
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:04.480]  and then you could run an operation we could create a open operation with
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:07.520]  different billboards and just if people want to go get it and put
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:11.600]  up one billboard five billboards whatever but all these nouveau rich people
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:14.800]  that think they're going to be safe not getting involved and keep their money
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:18.800]  we're going to lose everything our freedom if we don't stand up and i can't
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:22.240]  think of a better website and radio show and operation
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.160]  to send people to be warned about what's happening and i'm telling you
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:29.760]  huge effect from the billboards how many have you put up
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:34.800]  we we did a total of 13 and we did you know four louisiana
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.960]  two in mississippi and then i did uh another
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:42.640]  seven in seven other states i did one
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:46.240]  city in seven other states because i really wanted to
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:50.720]  broadcast this as you know with the money that we had
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:54.880]  to do this i wanted to get it as broad as i possibly could
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:58.560]  to really wake up people because people can talk about it through you know other
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:02.000]  states and everything sure people ask what is it well obviously it took us
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.880]  months to figure out who you were uh how long ago did you start this
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:12.880]  uh we started uh probably i would say in uh let's see
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:17.040]  september i think we started this okay so you started back in september so it's
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:19.840]  been three or four months it took us a couple months to
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:24.080]  to find you there's other people doing it now we don't know who they are because
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:27.280]  they're different billboards that are starting to pop up that's really
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:31.040]  exciting imagine a chain reaction if our listeners
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:34.800]  that have the means in every town and city put these up even if it's on the
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:37.840]  side of your barn you know info wars dot com
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:42.080]  or if it's a small billboard what if everybody started doing this or people
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.480]  that didn't started printing up hand bills and
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:49.600]  handing them out it's just the idea anything could be the focal point but
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:53.680]  again you were the focal point to spur us now and to spur others so
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:57.520]  congratulations well thank you and yeah just like i was saying
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:01.440]  you know last time you know people can order the bumper stickers
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:04.880]  and order the bumper stickers and put them up everywhere i mean
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:09.840]  it's really time for the american people in this country to start becoming
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:15.120]  active because this time right now is i really think we have
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.920]  two years maybe even less than that to save this country
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.840]  and i mean we really need to start absolutely i mean look
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:27.440]  they're not going to stop if george soros got caught spending 30 well he admitted
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:31.840]  it 33 million dollars uh just to destabilize and start a
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.880]  war with the police uh imagine what other tricks they've
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:38.880]  got up their sleeves they are moving on every front start civil unrest
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.560]  to get us all fighting with each other we've got to identify the globalists
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:46.400]  that are behind all this the private fellow reserve before they bring us
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:51.120]  into the next level of crisis absolutely and look the thing is is if
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:54.720]  they want to do this if they want to blow buildings up if they
[01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:57.360]  want to release viruses if they want to do
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:02.000]  there's nothing we can do to stop that the only thing we can do
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:06.720]  is wake as many people up to what's going on and who's at fault
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:09.840]  that way people know and they don't fall into their trap
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:13.680]  that's that's really the only thing we can do well has it been a good experience
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.560]  with you i know you're not a guy with a lot of means and you spent a lot of
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:20.160]  your money uh on putting up these billboards but has it been
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:23.840]  satisfying it was very exciting uh i love doing it
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:29.520]  i'd like to do more through the donations of other listeners and
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:34.720]  ideas they have uh it was it was awesome well how do people we didn't talk
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:37.520]  before air but i guess we're wargaming this right now that's how most great
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:41.360]  things end up happening is people just take action how do people contact you
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.440]  if they wanted to donate and and how much on average is each billboard these
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:50.320]  are huge billboards uh the average price you know it depends
[01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.920]  on your city but i would say average price is probably
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:56.160]  around three thirty five hundred something
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:59.120]  like that and that's because these are the big jumbos they have the smaller ones
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:02.400]  that are about half that yeah but we you know we wanted
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.600]  there's no point in going halfway you know let's put them up
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:09.840]  in major cities major traffic areas i mean let's
[01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:13.520]  if you're gonna do it let's do it so uh and you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:17.120]  prime the pump buckley i'm doing five thousand to push this
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:21.200]  contest but let's let's spend uh i gotta check the budget
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:24.080]  where we don't have a lot extra capital right now as we just expanded but you
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:28.640]  know what the money will come in let's uh put ten thousand down on maybe two
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.800]  billboards in austin's another more expensive here
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:35.440]  because it's such a hot city let's try to get one or one big one on i35
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:38.400]  to get this going in fact in the next month let's get a billboard up and
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:42.400]  listeners if you mail in donations and right on there for a billboard you have
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:45.120]  my word one hundred percent of that check
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:49.200]  will go towards an info wars billboard you can even specify
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:54.080]  what town or city you want it in um and i'm not gonna wait we're just gonna
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:58.560]  start doing it how do they contact you robert bro uh if people want to donate
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:03.040]  to you uh here's the thing i haven't said
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.360]  anything up yet i know we weren't planning it okay well
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.360]  that's fine come up with a plan and we'll do it
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:12.160]  okay i will i'll contact you and set up something we'll we'll get this going
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.320]  absolutely well that's what it's all about i was just sitting there saying we
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.160]  need to get this guy on he's great and i went wait a minute
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:19.200]  other billboards are going up other murals are going up why don't we just
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:22.720]  have a contest and get folks to come up with their billboard designs
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.080]  and shoot video of them handing out hand bills of the design
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:29.600]  that way you get people on youtube waking up in cyber war not just
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:35.280]  on the ground war real world war physical three-dimensional war we're cyber war
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:38.400]  we're three-dimensional and we're also then we're going to try to put up some
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.440]  billboards ourselves put our money where our mouth is
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.520]  maybe create a billboard fund send the emails out to our folks do people want
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:49.920]  to be part of this do you want us to bring a billboard to your city
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:52.880]  basically the sky's the limit on this man this is exciting
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:58.080]  absolutely i think it's a great idea man i really do i think a key is to
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.600]  if local cities have the money if a couple business guys get together and
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:06.000]  want to put one up you could have you know wake up or learn the
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.600]  truth or any of the things that you're putting on the billboards
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:13.280]  and then the name of the radio station alex jones on
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:18.880]  blah blah am or fm and then the time and then have info wars under it we can
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:22.480]  kind of have a synergy to also point people locally
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:26.640]  who aren't online or who don't like to listen online at the local am and fm
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:29.840]  affiliates that's going to take some legwork but
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:33.600]  if people are in the cities call the station work with them call the
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:37.360]  affiliates say i want to sponsor a billboard for you and alex jones
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.240]  to thank you for carrying the show to reach more people
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:44.720]  this is how wars are won getting off the bench taking action i'm nobody
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:47.680]  i've been doing this 20 years folks i've spent
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.440]  more than 15 million dollars a year the last 10 years funding this operation
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:55.200]  trying to get the products and sell the high quality products to make the money
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.800]  to pay for a major news organization and this is just the next level
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.000]  again that's not money i'm making that's money i'm bringing in to spend
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.520]  and it's the best money i ever spent in the war
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:09.440]  that's what this is all about i love my ford f-150
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.080]  i don't need a lamborghini it's a i mean i could i could have had those things
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:17.360]  as a successful talk show host but i didn't want them i wanted to build a
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.680]  news organization with the money and i put it into this is seed money
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:25.760]  and it's grown and grown by god's blessing i'm asking you listeners
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.520]  even there's not really a plan yet to help us with this in fact don't wait for
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:33.600]  our plan just do what robert bro has done and take action
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:36.960]  what do you say to that robert i think that's a great idea
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:40.480]  you know what we'll set something up and we'll just see how it progresses
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:46.640]  but i really uh encourage the listeners that if you do have the money
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.480]  then you should do this is about the future of this
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:54.800]  country i mean there's no other thing you can do
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:59.040]  that'll give you more satisfaction than standing up for your rights
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:02.720]  and your freedoms and saving this damn country
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:05.280]  beautifully said we got about three minutes to break i've been ranting

[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:11.680]  to be on air but we appreciate you well i mean all i want to say
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.640]  brother is that you know we don't have anything set up yet but we are
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:22.400]  going to do that and we'll contact you about a webmail maybe even a
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:26.240]  email address that y'all can send in ideas

[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:33.760]  but i do want to say one thing you know the this guy that had these videos of
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:38.320]  these people in uh california that are just totally uh
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:42.640]  idiots i mean we don't need to worry about people like that because they're
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:46.560]  even if they don't do anything they're not going to be a
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:51.120]  force they are we flip them off with our fingertips
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:55.920]  they are nobody so we the people who are strong in this country
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.200]  need to start standing up we don't need to worry about people
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:03.120]  that they're not going to take our rights ever that's right that's why they
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.840]  fund al-qaeda so that our best and brightest that want to defend this
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.600]  country gets suckered in to go in and get

[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:10.800]  and not let the machines take over well they're being engineered by the

[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:35.280]  that's coming up in a moment but first her report on barrett brown
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:51.280]  and the persecution of the press
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.200]  well if you haven't heard already political prisoner barrett brown
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.960]  was sentenced today to 63 months in prison
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:02.560]  on trumped-up charges for basically exposing
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:06.800]  the shady relationship between intelligence contractors
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:11.360]  and the u.s. government here's leon macadoo to tell us why the
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:15.840]  barrett brown case is vitally important to freedom
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:19.760]  in america american journalist and activist barrett brown
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:23.680]  first landed on the fbi's radar through his journalistic activities
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:29.120]  with a crowdsourced investigation called project pm project pm was intended
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:31.840]  to provide a centralized data set regarding the
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:34.480]  expanding capabilities of the surveillance state
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:37.440]  and other issues constituting threats to human rights
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:41.680]  and the health of democratic institutions brown was originally facing
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:46.160]  decades of prison time for copying and pasting a link
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:50.880]  to a publicly available file journalists shouldn't face prosecution for
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:54.160]  linking to source material so journalists everywhere should be
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:57.680]  paying very close attention to what happens in barrett brown's case
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:01.360]  but not only that anyone who uses social media
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:05.520]  should be paying attention as well six months after the march 2012
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:09.360]  fbi raid on his mother's home he tweeted dead men
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:13.200]  can't leak stuff illegally shoot the son of a b
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:17.280]  now of course upon first glance that sounds like an incitement to murder
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:22.000]  and indeed the fbi even claimed that the tweet was targeted toward one of their
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.840]  agents but here's the thing the tweet was actually a quote of fox news host
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:32.400]  bob beckle beckle was using his prime time news hour
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.880]  to call for the assassination of wiki leaks founder julian assange
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:40.720]  the way to deal with this is pretty simple we've got special ops forces
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:44.320]  i mean a dead man can't leak stuff this guy's a traitor a treasonous
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:48.400]  and and and he has broken every law of the united states the guy ought to be
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:51.280]  and i'm not for the death penalty so if i'm not for the death penalty i only
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:55.920]  wanted to do it illegally shoot the son of a the fbi took no action against bob
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:59.040]  beckle or numerous others who were openly calling
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:02.640]  for a mystery bullet to take out julian assange
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:06.960]  instead two days after barrett tweeted the bob beckle statement
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:11.360]  the fbi arrested not bob beckle but barrett brown
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:16.320]  and he's been in jail ever since assange warns social media users of this
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:19.680]  vulnerability writing twitter is a police interview that
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:22.960]  never ends facebook has all of your friends wearing a
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:27.440]  wire and youtube has you in the dock talking to the judge
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:31.600]  every social media user creates a vast library of statements
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:35.280]  that may be taken out of context by vengeful or ambitious
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:38.560]  officials users should be displayed their maranda rights
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:43.280]  each time they log on keep this in mind as the obama administration is pushing
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:47.200]  for cispa 2.0 which will effectively allow governments to
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:50.800]  demand that companies hand over user data without the
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:55.920]  need for warrants or subpoenas with stronger cyber security laws will come
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:59.040]  harsher punishment
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:06.000]  alex jones here back live in full wars nightly news anchor leon macadoo
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.920]  investigative journalist joins us leon for those that don't know about barrett
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:13.200]  brown they just convicted a cia whistleblower that exposed criminal
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:17.200]  activity to about a big federal prison sentence today
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:21.040]  barrett brown linked to a public document
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:24.800]  and then quoted a fox news reporter and now he's in jail
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:28.320]  uh the the white house has a war on journalists and
[01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:32.480]  the average journalist won't even get up in arms to defend their own profession
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:36.000]  in the first amendment there is no common sense out there
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.440]  in the establishment right well it's just like when we had a
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:42.480]  a lot of people were coming after you saying oh well we should drone him we
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:46.080]  should take him out right there using their platform
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:50.080]  of a new you know a news hour broadcast to call for your death
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:52.800]  i forgot fox news said i should be droned or tased
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:56.000]  and that's exactly what they were saying about the wiki leaks founder julien
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.440]  assange and i mean just show after show after show calling
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:03.840]  so all barrett brown did was repeat what this
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.720]  bob buckle said and then that was when they
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:10.480]  they finally just came in about two days later and took him to jail and he's
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:13.840]  in jail for 63 months he'll serve almost the whole
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:16.640]  sentence federally that's hard time as they call it
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:20.400]  for retweeting what a fox news guy shit well and linking to a document yes the
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:24.560]  initial thing that you know they got him on the computer fraud and abuse act
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:29.040]  because he linked to a publicly available document they were building this
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:32.960]  sort of dossier and we do that all the time i mean i mean what's in it you
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:35.920]  know what's attached to it he didn't even know what was there he was just
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:40.320]  helping with his investigation and apparently well you've got to open
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:43.760]  files to know what's in it yeah and that's and they had the whole track through
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:46.800]  his emails and his his i ams and everything where he's
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:50.880]  saying he he doesn't know what's in it but he links to it because it's part of
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:56.240]  the story and everything with his blog but apparently it had some
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:00.400]  credit cards attached to it or you know private information and so now
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:04.160]  anybody can open an email by accident or anybody could
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:07.040]  go to the wiki leaks website and now the fbl throw you in prison
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:10.400]  there's nothing but a huge chilling effect exactly and that's what it is
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:14.960]  is to silence whistleblowers silence journalists keep them from
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:18.880]  from exposing this this information because then they can say oh well you
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:20.560]  you know you shouldn't have put that out there
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:24.480]  national security issue things like that and and it is a
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:29.040]  chill for journalists well i mean some mainstream news has been calling a
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:32.320]  tyranny but if we don't see a bigger backlash this is going to set the
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:35.520]  precedent and it really is frightening yeah well and they can just call for
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:38.720]  your death right on cable news you know
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:42.240]  and prime time news hour call for your death but that's that's not an issue i
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:45.840]  forgot when on pierce morgan they said yeah get a gun
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.560]  shooting right here in the studio and they said yeah i'd love to kill him
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:52.240]  they all agreed let's murder him exactly and they could say it's a joke but
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:56.400]  when you start calling for violence it crosses the line
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:59.600]  in precedent federal and state and in common law
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:03.120]  if i would have said you know let's shoot pierce morgan close quote i didn't
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:06.160]  just say that by the way i said if i was to have said that hypothetically as he
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:10.080]  said about me uh and buzz bisoner said then i would
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:13.440]  be indicted absolutely and that's the issue here is that
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:17.520]  cherry picking who how they're going to prosecute or who they're going to charge
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:20.720]  and oh that's okay because you know you're part of the establishment
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:23.840]  well look at this report out of right bart report indiana governor
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:28.000]  mike pinched to launch state-run news site then in apple star is reporting the
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:31.600]  potential 2016 presidential hopeful governor mike pinch republican
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:35.120]  plans to launch a state-run news site that will offer pre-written articles
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:38.480]  to indiana news outlets as well as sometimes break news stories
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:41.840]  about administration the white house has already moved to this several years
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:45.440]  ago right the reason they can do it is when the
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:49.680]  mainstream media regurgitate whole cloth what they're told
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:54.560]  you make yourselves obsolete that's what the cia came out a decade ago and rolled
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:58.720]  it out three years ago computers that write the news and put fake names on
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:02.880]  they just put in the pre-scripted disinfo it scrambles it to make it look like a
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:06.320]  human wrote it it leaving out of typo to make it they found that makes it look
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:10.080]  more legitimate and uh they caught the cia will put a
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:14.320]  typo in the headline for some reason they found makes people buy it
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:17.040]  more i don't understand that they've got the algorithms
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:20.320]  show that's why this is really happening but now
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:24.560]  republicans and democrats are up in arms about this why are they i mean i'm
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:27.520]  not i'm not saying it's good but why are they up in arms
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:31.040]  when this is what the whole federal government does they just don't want the
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:33.680]  competition exactly and it or it's that it's out
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.640]  there in the public now but i mean we reported this
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.920]  a year or so ago when they lifted the ban on spreading propaganda to the
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:45.200]  continental cia disinformation yeah yeah
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:49.680]  allegedly they were only doing it overseas but now they're openly they can
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:53.120]  just get us propaganda right here on the news shifting gears you've got like a
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:55.840]  five-minute clip there'll be more on the nightly news tonight that you're going
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:59.520]  to be hosting seven o'clock central again leon macadoo here on the info wars
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:02.720]  dot com news studios you've gone to this international
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:05.600]  conference being held in austin artificial intelligence
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:10.560]  open house uh monday january 26th at the hyatt region seat in austin
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:13.360]  texas you're going to be also reporting on some of the break away
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:17.120]  break-off groups but you talked to some of the top
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:20.640]  artificial intelligence professors you talked to the author of artificial
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:23.440]  intelligence the the book that was turned into a movie
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:29.440]  you talked to a bunch of other folks the about the ibeam watson you name it
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:32.880]  that's deciding which troops not give health care to now that was announced
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:36.960]  last week given your take on this because they're
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:42.320]  talking about being able to stop the ai anti-human takeover of
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:46.800]  tyrannous that's the bae system the aircraft that kills people and makes
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:50.800]  its own decisions that's what all this is going to but we still have time to
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:54.720]  stop it don't we leon absolutely and that was kind of my takeaway
[01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:58.400]  from that experience because initially i went there i was thinking i was going
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:03.760]  to see you know robo girlfriends and all sort of eye tracking and
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:07.520]  mosquito drones and yeah i was like oh i'm going to get some good stuff on camera
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:12.000]  and then i go there and it was just like poster boards up on the wall with like
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.520]  here's what we want to do and it was kind of disappointing
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:22.320]  but then when i i left i realized that that is actually a great thing because
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:27.120]  these systems this this malevolent takeover that science fiction is
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:29.760]  basically warning us is going to happen
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:34.560]  isn't here just yet we have the opportunity to really press down and
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:39.120]  say we need to be responsible with what we are creating in this
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:43.520]  technology that we're creating because it is a part of our human evolution
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:48.480]  you know that's what humans do we supposedly try to control our environment
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:51.760]  and build the environment we want not let the establishment build a
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:53.920]  technocracy that enslaves us and you're right
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:57.840]  japan's trying to go with the robo sapien robot model the
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:01.280]  the western elite want an artificially intelligent computer to map
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.800]  reality through smart dirt or chips and everything
[01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:08.080]  to then control and surveil everything that is here
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:12.000]  what's not here is the killer robots on the ground but we're only a few
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.040]  years away from that and have to have a debate about it
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:19.200]  tell us about this clip we're about to play well this clip i'm speaking with
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:22.320]  a doctor stewart russell he wrote the book artificial
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:26.400]  intelligence a modern approach and we basically
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:29.680]  we're talking about what is the future for humanity what happens when the
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:34.160]  robots take all the jobs who decides who gets to decide
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:38.480]  what is positively beneficial to society because a drone
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:41.760]  you know a autonomous drone it's beneficial to the soldier that's not
[01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:44.960]  going to have to die out on the field but it's not beneficial to
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:49.440]  perhaps the innocent person who is killed with that drone plus it takes humans
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:52.880]  out of the equation and then the robot can just be self-destructed or it's
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:55.760]  memory-wived after it murders the family right and we know
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:58.880]  plants dna there to blame me right and whoever is
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:02.560]  programming this drone might just be doing his job but who gave you the
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:05.600]  orders to do that and is it a war that was waged
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:09.520]  for humanity or just for some corporate person who wanted to go in and take
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:12.800]  this country's resources who decides there was a tom
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:15.840]  sellick movie back in the 80s called runaway and
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:19.920]  they've now come out with basically killer robots that don't stab you with
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:23.760]  acid they fire a shotgun burst at you or or or they
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:27.120]  have a handgun built inside of them and it comes in your house and kills you
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:31.760]  DARPA released that two years ago they have drones that fly over to release a
[01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:34.480]  hundred and actually have these now little
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.360]  pods that come down and surveil you and shoot you
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:41.280]  i mean this is really happening and believe me i talked to a marine core
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:45.760]  colonel uh 16 years ago that said look the robots you're
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:49.440]  seeing are nothing but he said we're not going with the Japanese model this is
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:51.680]  back then of like having something that looks at
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:55.920]  actually a human it's an 18-wheeler that pulls up that's a robot
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:00.160]  and out of it rolls off a whole bunch of wheeled killer robots
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:03.040]  that just it doesn't matter if it takes them five minutes to climb your stairs
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:06.320]  they go in they blow up your door they come in and they roll in and they kill
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:09.200]  you and uh and then now of course they've
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:12.800]  shown us all that i mean basically they have things that are like f-150 pickups
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:16.400]  but are battle-hardened that look like a cartoon they've got so many guns and
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:20.000]  weapons on them and then that's what you're facing right it's robot planes
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.600]  it's robot cars it's it's it's it's not going to be
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:28.400]  homo sapien looking robots right and and he was actually saying that
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:32.640]  it's it's even more uh it's it's going to be even more frightening than that
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:35.600]  building this robot army that doesn't even make sense
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:40.080]  what they what they would do could take out a country in a day
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:44.240]  simply well sure it's a robot brains that go in and jack into all the
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:48.720]  communications or even if they hardwire stuff not to be
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:53.600]  hooked into the grid they simply deploy robot drones that are like smart meters
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:57.600]  that hover in attach hack the system at the point and then take it over
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:00.880]  right he said it could you could have one robot per city take over
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:04.320]  he said two seconds decimate the civilian population
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:08.240]  and that's why is that going to be in this report or the extended one tonight
[01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:11.760]  uh well i believe he mentions that here at the end and this is why he's talking
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:15.360]  about why elin musk and these other people are signing this open letter
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:18.640]  saying we need to be responsible we're going to cover it after the break but
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:21.840]  talk about some of these articles in that wired magazine admitting google's
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:26.160]  plan at the beginning was to build an ai supercomputer to control reality
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:29.840]  right well that's that's basically uh what us stewart russell was talking
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:33.120]  about as well is that the ai that we have is like siri
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:37.280]  or like google where where what it is is it's kind of taking all this data and
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:42.640]  figuring out how to be a more perfect uh source of information we are building
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:47.200]  the ai it is us exactly that's how it learns that's how
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:51.760]  the robots learn is they observe us and they see what's beneficial to us
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:54.800]  my god we're building robots that are like us we're really in trouble
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:59.680]  well i mean we are we are programs you know biological androgen that's and that's
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:03.280]  why we have the ability to observe our environment and say
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:07.280]  you know my tribe is cold so i'm going to knit a sweater or i'm going to build a
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:10.880]  fire or i'm going to you know we that's what we do we build these
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:15.040]  things and so we are creating this ai system
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:18.720]  just like we built info wars to fight the new world order absolutely
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:22.720]  and so that's what it is is that we we can't be afraid of what our human
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:26.320]  abilities are going to do but we also cannot stand down
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:30.800]  and let you know john connor build the terminator we have to fight
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:34.720]  exactly to build a free and open system and take it away from the technocrats
[01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:36.800]  that are just telling us the way it's going to be and that's what this
[01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:40.000]  conference was about exactly because it doesn't exist yet
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.240]  they just want us to believe that it's that's how you control reality
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:47.440]  they tell us this is what it is and then we just accept it right first they
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:50.800]  deny it's happening so we're not involved in in in in changing how they
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:54.480]  build it you know for the good now they just say oh this is the way it is
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:58.320]  humans are obsolete you're over that's what the borgs say you're obsolete you

[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:30.480]  here's part of our interview with Dr. Stuart Russell
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:33.680]  we're gonna go ahead and roll that and we'll come back in the next segment and
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:41.600]  finish the interview
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.960]  so speaking about dispelling the myth of this AI explosion and then robots are
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:50.640]  going to you know destroy humanity and and that's kind of
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:55.440]  a way that media and science fiction can sell you know sell their product
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:59.200]  but we do have people like Stephen Hawking or Elon Musk saying
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:02.800]  that you know there is a reason for concern and and Elon Musk donates a
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:06.000]  lot of money to this research where they're going to
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.440]  put forth this effort to make sure AI doesn't get ahead of us
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:13.760]  is there a reason to be concerned and what can we do about it
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:19.200]  so there is a reason to be concerned in a long term because the direction
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:22.880]  that AI has been going and not just AI control theory
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:25.840]  operations researcher other disciplines aimed at exactly the same thing which
[01:55:25.840 --> 01:55:29.120]  is producing the capability for making high quality
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:35.120]  decisions that's all it means and if you have a system that
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:38.800]  can make very high quality decisions which means it it takes into account
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:41.120]  much more information than a human could do
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:46.000]  it's able to look further in the future than a human could do
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:51.360]  the third part of the triangle so to speak is is what's the objective
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:54.320]  so it's using lots of information it's looking far ahead in the future that's
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:58.800]  great what's the objective that it's trying to achieve
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:01.760]  if that objective is not perfectly aligned with
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:08.880]  with the values of us humans then that creates the possibility for
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:12.880]  bad things to happen for that in some sense
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:18.160]  is the definition of conflict and getting into a conflict with
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:21.920]  systems that are more and more capable than we are
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:26.000]  doesn't sound like a good idea so the solution
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:30.720]  seems to be that we have to make sure the values of the machine are aligned
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:36.880]  with the values of the human race so one way to get that to happen
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:41.360]  is for the machine to observe what humans do
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:44.560]  not only what we do but what is our attitude to
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:49.680]  what we do and what other people do so if someone gets put in jail we learn
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:53.600]  that that was an act contrary to human values
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:58.560]  if someone gets up in the morning makes a cup of coffee
[01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:02.720]  then you the machine learns that you know having some coffee in the morning
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:07.840]  is valuable to humans vital to humans and
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:12.560]  there is there is a lot of information out there who gets to decide
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:16.480]  what is positively beneficial is it going to be some
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:20.400]  government agency or some bureaucracy who gets to decide because
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:24.240]  for instance if you take autonomous drones
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:26.960]  well what the human would want them to do
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:31.120]  is be really accurate and have precision you know so that it'll
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:36.320]  strike its target but maybe the person on the receiving end of that drone
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:40.000]  strike that's not going to be beneficial to them
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.240]  and we know sometimes war is waged for the wrong reasons
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:48.400]  and people decide for the wrong reasons that they want this machine to
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:53.840]  to do their bidding basically so i mean that's not really something that
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:57.680]  people can even backtrack that technology is already there
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:01.520]  but so who who kind of gets to decide what's beneficial and
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:04.960]  and is there any control we're going to come back in the next little segment
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:09.600]  ahead of joseph curl joining us and and and have leon
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:12.880]  finish this video but you were just making the point that
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:16.160]  this is the crossroads right now i mean go ahead make that point you were
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:19.600]  telling me yes we are on the precipice of a decision
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:24.560]  that is going to alter the course of humanity for all time this ai it's
[01:58:24.560 --> 01:58:27.600]  going to happen ai has a future it's here it's just
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:31.440]  the question is what is the future for humanity and are we going to be involved
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:34.400]  in that or just let the globalist build a nightmare system which they are
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:38.960]  building an anti-human computer grid and training the robots to exterminate us

[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:57.920]  let's let's go to the conclusion of the interview you got it'll all be edited
[02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:01.120]  with b-roll really powerful tonight on the nightly news but let's go back to
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:04.720]  more of the writer of the best-selling book ai here it is
[02:02:04.720 --> 02:02:08.000]  is there any way to control some of the systems that are already
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:14.160]  growing so that's a great question i think the issue of autonomous weapons is
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:17.280]  is a very immediate one in some ways much more immediate than the kinds of
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:22.080]  things we've just been talking about and my own view
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:29.040]  is that it's a mistake to think just about replacing
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:33.760]  current functions that are done by humans with machines so right now we have
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:37.920]  drones but they're the targeting decisions are made by a human who you
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:41.840]  know is getting the remote video feed from the drone
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:47.360]  and the human identifies the target and the human pulls the trigger
[02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:50.160]  and so people are talking about is it acceptable
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:55.840]  to replace that particular function with a computer program
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:03:00.720]  and the argument then focuses on accuracy and
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:04.960]  you know moral agency and liability and responsibility and
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:08.880]  you know whether it exactly fits the Geneva convention
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:14.720]  and issues like that and that argument is playing out right now in the United
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:19.280]  Nations so so it will get resolved one way
[02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:23.520]  or the other and and that's the right place i think the
[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:27.280]  the the collection of nations of the world need to decide on what
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:31.440]  what kinds of military capabilities are actually
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:36.160]  allowable but the reason i think it's a mistake
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:38.880]  is because it assumes that everything remains the same
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:43.200]  that we just replace an existing human function with a with an algorithm or
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:45.920]  machine and nothing else changes but in fact
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:49.120]  if you have autonomous weapons you're going to have an arms race
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:53.120]  of autonomous weapons there you go he really gets into the powerful stuff now
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:55.760]  this will all be on the nightly news tonight seven o'clock central standard
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:58.960]  time but leon i wanted to give you one minute to finish up
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:02.880]  right well obviously the autonomous weapons a lot of people who are involved
[02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:05.840]  in this AI you know they want to be able to take this
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:09.920]  further but they are saying we need common sense we need ethics
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:12.720]  and i'm also going to talk about on the news tonight
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:18.080]  something that's even more pressing much sooner than 2045 has been predicted
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:23.440]  no idea what humans in the transition period are going to do for jobs
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:26.560]  it is going to be a job that's the problem the globalists are engineering
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:30.320]  it to make us obsolete and saying it so the scientists and the writers saying
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:33.040]  we don't know what to do we've got to talk about it the plans already been made
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:36.400]  to get rid of us yeah and the and the economists they all want to know what
[02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:40.080]  what's what do we do what do we do but they have no solutions no answers well
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:42.560]  they ought to read what the transhumanist eugenicists are saying they're going to
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:45.840]  kill everybody well that's the thing that's gotta talk
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:49.600]  to bill joy and read his article and the robots can do it because they have no
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:54.000]  a passion no care leon macadoo you'll be hosting the news tonight seven o'clock

[02:08:15.360 --> 02:08:27.200]  alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:30.720]  well i was up in dallas one time visiting
[02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:34.640]  families staying in a hotel and right there in the middle of the restaurant
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:38.640]  bar comes walking over joe kerl who i had met
[02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:45.200]  up in dc watch covering bilderberg and joe kerl has been up there for 30 years
[02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:48.880]  i guess or so in dc he hadn't looked at all but he's been
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:51.680]  there with the washington times you name it
[02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:54.960]  he was there when the drudge report basically started and was involved
[02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:58.560]  really since the beginning of it at the washington times working back and
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:03.600]  forth with the drudge now he has launched his own big site
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:07.200]  over at the washington times dot com
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:13.280]  right read and that's a joseph curl and i wanted to get him on because he i don't
[02:09:13.280 --> 02:09:16.320]  want to call him really an insider insider he just is up there on capitol
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:19.200]  hill every day you know he's covering the white
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:23.280]  house he's got the inside scoop not the state-run media angle and i got to tell
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:25.920]  you the washington times just gets better and better
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:29.440]  you can say what you want about who started it or whatever the point is they
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:33.440]  cover you know the pentagon training to take on the tea party uh they cover
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:35.760]  fast and furious they cover been gauzy gay it's
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:40.320]  trudge report dot com the washington times dot com uh world net daily dot com
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:45.840]  you know drudge m4s that's really about it and that scares me
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:49.440]  it's good to see more and more sites out there starting to cover some of these
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:53.200]  issues but uh it's it's just scary sometimes
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:56.240]  realize how few big sites there are that will actually
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:59.840]  tackle stuff that's painful for both political parties
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:03.680]  the world it seems is being set on fire right now
[02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:07.360]  major destabilization obama has said again that the world's never been more
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:11.840]  stable under his his leadership and he also says two plus two equals five and
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:14.400]  that you can keep your doctor and that raising the debt limit doesn't raise the
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:16.880]  debt limit i know i say that pretty much every day but it's just
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:21.360]  repeating the craziness right read dot com will take you to the
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:25.680]  subsection of the uh washington times now well it's it's affiliated with a lot
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:28.480]  of different organizations he'll explain it all to us because i don't want to
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:31.680]  butcher the facts here but it's an excellent site he's an american writer
[02:10:31.680 --> 02:10:36.000]  and political columnist he ran and worked with drudge report for years
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.920]  he covered politics for 25 plus years 12 years as white house correspondent
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:43.680]  for the washington times columnist for the washington times as well as editor
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:48.480]  of right read dot com right read dot com so explain to me before we get into
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:53.040]  all these topics where are the big establishment republicans going can they
[02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:55.920]  weather the storm allowing open borders allowing
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:58.960]  obama care to continue what's going to happen there
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:02.160]  what's the big summit of republican candidates saturday
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:06.480]  what does that mean that you covered uh what'd you pick up there uh we'll also
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:10.320]  talk about immigration and where a potential political candidates stand
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:14.560]  and we'll also talk about obama and what he's going to do in his last two years
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:19.200]  in office we just passed that rubicon last week but but first tell me about the
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:23.040]  new news website well the things that actually
[02:11:23.040 --> 02:11:25.840]  initiated one that's quite an introduction um and i was thinking about
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:29.920]  that the other day our our night in um in gallus remember what we ended up
[02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:32.560]  doing what do we end up doing

[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:08.560]  and um and it was just time for me to break out and do my own thing it
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:12.240]  it'll never be it'll never be the the size and power of the drudges report as
[02:12:12.240 --> 02:12:16.000]  you know is it's huge and and enormous and but he links to your stuff that's
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.040]  the amazing thing about drudge i mean he supported right bart when he left
[02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:23.120]  he's supporting you he just really is all about the information in a media
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:26.080]  system full of egomaniacs he's the opposite
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:28.720]  that's right and that's why he that's why he likes to you guys too i mean he
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:31.600]  loves your work he knows that you guys are breaking stories
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:35.360]  he knows that the the liberal media is you know pooling you guys and talking
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:38.880]  about conspiracy whack jobs out there but he knows that you're getting to the
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:41.760]  real stuff and that's why he likes you guys so much as well well that's what
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:44.480]  you're doing tell us about right read.com and what it's
[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:46.960]  affiliated with because i may have gotten some of that wrong i just visited
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:50.560]  the site i don't know all the details and then let's get into the news
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:53.520]  yeah but it's connected connected to washington times they they were kind
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:57.440]  enough to offer me a help starting it and running it and
[02:12:57.440 --> 02:13:00.240]  and access to all their readers and everything so i took them up on it i've
[02:13:00.240 --> 02:13:04.080]  been there for just about 20 years now on and off with them doing all kinds of
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:06.640]  different things and so loyal to the to the great
[02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:09.360]  washington times i think you're right i think they're getting better and better
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:13.120]  and they're coming on they've got all kinds of new guys going and and it's
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:17.440]  really going to be exciting 2016 with the kind of stuff they're doing so my
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:20.720]  my idea really is to try to get people another
[02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:24.880]  another place to go for information i think what's happening in the world
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:28.480]  today is in the you know on the internet and the and the
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:32.800]  and the media there's so much stuff and it's hard to get through it all my
[02:13:32.800 --> 02:13:36.400]  idea is to to do what i what i did so well at
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:40.480]  drudges is to read everything so that you don't have to i will read everything
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:43.280]  i'm reading hundreds of stories a day and then i'm picking
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:47.360]  50 or 60 stories to say here's what you can't miss here's what you gotta read
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:50.240]  today so that's my idea and i and i'm assuming
[02:13:50.240 --> 02:13:53.680]  people are going to read drudges and hopefully they'll click over to me and
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:57.520]  take a look at what i'm doing as well because there's so much stuff out there
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:01.200]  that it can it can become overwhelming you read a lot of these sites and it's
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:04.640]  just a nonstop stream of stuff and and the way the media
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:07.280]  jumps on things there they're on something for a little bit then they're
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:11.360]  often they're quick hitting things like crazy and then jumping to the next thing
[02:14:11.360 --> 02:14:15.360]  nobody's really following through on on what's really going on exactly it's
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:18.960]  speaking of vengazi maybe we should go there first a judicial watch got these
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:22.160]  new documents uh and and and as your headline
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:24.800]  shows there the White House is now walking back their
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:29.360]  previous lies will they get away with this and what are the documents show
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:33.440]  well it's been it's been a shocking day off on the hill with these guys because
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:36.960]  they're really saying you know they've been walking this
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:39.840]  these documents i mean we're talking about something that happened
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:43.200]  more than two years ago and then and that in congress still doesn't have the
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:46.000]  documents they've asked for time and again these guys
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:50.240]  literally had the gall to stand up there today in the justice department or
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:53.440]  state department officials didn't say well we're not really sure what
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:57.440]  documents that you're looking for and and the republicans on on the committee
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:00.720]  were all saying look we've told you over and over again
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:04.160]  what documents we want we want access to these 22 witnesses
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:07.040]  and you've got the state department guy up there going well why don't you
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:10.560]  prioritize it tell us which ones you want to see we'll see we can
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:14.480]  get to make that happen but what really what they've been doing is and this is
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:18.240]  what the the media and the administration in cahoots has been
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:20.800]  doing is they're trying to they're killing this
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:24.800]  thing by making a team they're dragging your feet on this so that
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:28.320]  so that nothing ever happens and they put these things out every once in a
[02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:30.640]  while like recently they dumped a bunch of
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:34.960]  documents on a friday late over friday and at least some documents that
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:38.560]  again like you said judicial watch got a hold of a bunch of great documents
[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:42.640]  showing what had really happened there and and showing again that the
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:46.240]  administration was sitting on and not releasing all this information
[02:15:46.240 --> 02:15:50.080]  what what the administration's goal is what obama's goal is
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:54.720]  is to make this scheme as if it's just the republicans on a witch hunt there's
[02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:57.360]  nothing there they just won't let it go they just keep
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:00.960]  hiding about it and and for a lot of people it's working a lot of people
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:04.400]  think well what are they doing they're still you know they're on and on again
[02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:07.920]  about this well that's because the republican leadership
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:12.320]  doesn't ever attack if they had attack obama on obama care
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:15.760]  if they would attack obama on blanket amnesty outside of law
[02:16:15.760 --> 02:16:19.760]  if they would attack obama on what really happened in in ben gazi or fast
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:23.360]  and furious or irs gate he would be impeached right now
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:26.880]  and the truth is from my view they are bought and paid for
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:30.080]  by the same special interest at least mcconnell and bainer are
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:34.560]  and are basically letting obama take over i mean i'm scared of what he may do
[02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:37.840]  in the next two years shifting gears and back into the other issue
[02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:41.200]  because it's all tied together as you know joe curl who just joined us
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:46.240]  from his website right read dot com what do we do about the huge landslide that
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:49.520]  happened and now the republican leadership is sitting on top of it
[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:53.360]  ignoring the constitution and ignoring the landslide what do you think is going
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:56.960]  to come out of this well i think i think there's there's an awful
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:17:00.800]  lot of there's an awful lot of intrigue going along under
[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:04.560]  under the current behind the scenes in in in capital hill right now i mean you
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:08.480]  saw what happened with john bainer and the the um
[02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:11.600]  mutiny that took place and there were a lot of you know there were there were
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:15.440]  reports that i heard at the time that they were upwards of 50
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:17.920]  republican members who were going to vote against
[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:21.840]  john john bainer now what happens when that when that starts to swirl around
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:25.120]  nobody wants to get out ahead of it because if you vote against bainer
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:28.400]  and and and you don't oust them as speaker
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:31.200]  then you don't get any good committee assignments and you got it you just made
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:35.920]  a powerful entity so what happened there was a lot of guys who were ready to go
[02:17:35.920 --> 02:17:39.120]  they ended up getting cold feet and everyone went back and
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:42.320]  and went ahead and supported them but you still had 24 people vote against them
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:46.080]  which was pretty bold and right now what's happening is
[02:17:46.080 --> 02:17:50.240]  there the the party is splintering on capital hill there there are
[02:17:50.240 --> 02:17:53.040]  different factions within the republicans that
[02:17:53.040 --> 02:17:58.240]  that are not really um accessible to the other factions there are key party
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:01.920]  guys there are guys who are really concerned about the over spending the
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:05.440]  deficit spending the massive national debt
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:08.880]  and they're not really on board with with all of this sort of go along to get
[02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:11.520]  along which is what's happening on capital hill right now
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:15.200]  this idea that you know we need to negotiate with with obama where
[02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:18.400]  we're never going to get anything done because obama controls everything
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:21.360]  so there's a lot of our happiness on capital hill from
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:24.480]  a lot of republicans and especially conservatives what they're finding out
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:26.880]  is that they're they're going to have a lot of
[02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:30.560]  trouble pushing things through because they don't have
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:35.280]  a a solid majority they don't really have the kind of
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:40.000]  solidity that they need the not everyone the unity that they're looking for
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:43.840]  is not there and they're in trouble well joe what's going to happen
[02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:47.360]  when the next election comes around and republicans haven't delivered anything
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:51.840]  haven't repealed any of obama care have let obama open the borders up
[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:55.520]  i mean there's going to be a huge backlash in my view and an even bigger
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:58.960]  tea party contingent i think will be sent i think it's key for the tea party to
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:03.200]  explain that they've been betrayed and sat on by a bunch of rhinos
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:09.920]  and that we need to remove the rhinos if we have any hope
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:13.280]  that's right and that's exactly what that's the danger that
[02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:17.040]  you know remember when when when it was a huge landslide on November 4th for
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:20.800]  republicans that remember policy and other democrats talking about well this
[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:23.200]  is you know quietly talking about the fact that
[02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:26.080]  this could be a good thing for them because now they've got a two-year lead
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:29.360]  in if the republicans get nothing done and can't
[02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:32.880]  get over this kind of intra-party fighting wobbling
[02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:36.160]  then the democrats are going to say look these guys have been in control for
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:38.960]  two years they haven't done anything you should put
[02:19:38.960 --> 02:19:42.000]  us back in power and that will be a pretty powerful argument
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.200]  for voters going into the polls on 2016 so
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:48.640]  you're right republicans are either going to have to get together
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:52.080]  in the next couple of months and and really move forward with a unified
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:54.400]  face what they're going to they're going to face

[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:32.320]  new york times said there'd be no more blizzards
[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:37.680]  by this year i mean it's just a border surge likely in 2015 data shows
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:41.520]  bainer mcconnell's retreat and obama amnesty fight panics conservatives
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:45.520]  washington times i want to talk about the drone and all the panicking is a toy
[02:25:45.520 --> 02:25:49.680]  drone crashes uh i mean there's just so much it's just crazy
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:52.480]  joe curl worry where do you want to go next i mean
[02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:55.840]  what else are you focusing on uh there on your new news site
[02:25:55.840 --> 02:26:01.440]  right read dot com well anything that's happening on the on the drone
[02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:05.760]  debacle is obama has come out and said that drones need to be regulated
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:10.720]  so that that'll be interesting as as the the white house decides to take over
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:14.160]  all drones i guess you know kids playing in the backyard are you not going to be
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:17.280]  regulated well it was already illegal in dc
[02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:20.960]  to have a drone and do that so i mean i mean these laws don't do it's remote
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:23.600]  control toys it sounds like an excuse to try to ban
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:27.600]  remote control toys yeah that's that's that's what's
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:29.760]  really interesting i mean you know it really does
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:32.720]  it's really kind of amazing when you think about what what the white house
[02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:36.240]  you know like it is a vulnerable building it's right in the middle of dc
[02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:40.240]  you can walk up to or from all sides you can get within
[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:44.480]  you know a couple hundred feet at the front door so and and there's just those
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:47.760]  big old iron you know rod iron bars in front of it so
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:51.840]  it's really but but but now they're saying that that the the drone was
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:55.840]  was too small to be picked up by radar and that really makes you wonder
[02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:59.440]  what kind of security they've got at the white house if they if they can't handle
[02:26:59.440 --> 02:27:02.720]  and see the the the coming you know the future of
[02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:05.760]  of what kind of security threats they got a face it's kind of amazing that they
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:09.360]  didn't think you know boy i wonder if they you know if you can fly a drone in
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:13.040]  there that means you could you could arm a drone put a bunch of weapons on it
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:16.480]  put a bomb on it and fly a drone right into the white house and just exploded
[02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:19.120]  you know right next to the window fly it inside
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:22.160]  just smash it through the window and fly it into the residence kind of amazing
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:24.960]  that if they don't have the foresight to know
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:28.640]  that's what that's what they say well they'll probably argue for kills which
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:33.120]  is in all these toy drones so that they can have a field a radio wave field i'm
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:36.640]  predicting this you know being broadcast to to order them to crash but
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:40.800]  i've been on people's boats that have pretty inexpensive radar systems on them
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:45.440]  and if you've got a duck flying at you at 500 yards away it picks up the duck
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:50.800]  or or a a group of ducks flying uh or a flock of seagulls i mean i don't
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:54.080]  believe that they're i mean they've got radar that would
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:58.640]  pick it up oh i'm sure i mean but it's again
[02:27:58.640 --> 02:28:01.840]  like you know the other day when with that guy a couple a couple of months ago
[02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:04.000]  when the guy you know jumped over the fence and ran
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:07.040]  to the white house ran in the front door and and was you know
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:11.120]  tackled inside then they said well he's a wasn't arby wasn't a danger
[02:28:11.120 --> 02:28:14.240]  and it turns out of course he was arby had a knife on him so
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:18.400]  it's it's confusing what these guys think they just keep to keep having
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:23.120]  problems they can't really protect the president it's kind of frightening
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:26.960]  well i mean at the same time we are a free society and look at 10 Downing
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:30.480]  Street i mean somebody could fly a drone into that i mean i think it just comes
[02:28:30.480 --> 02:28:33.360]  down to the fact that i don't think we can be held
[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:38.160]  hostage by all the potential threats as but but but you're right as technology
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:42.480]  proliferates i don't see how we're ever going to stop
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:46.720]  crazy people being able to do damage no matter how big a police state we build
[02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:50.880]  so what is the answer well then that's that's that's a great
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:54.320]  point because the other what what what happens right away now is exactly what
[02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:58.080]  obama's talking about which is like let's let's have the state control this
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:00.720]  let's have the state control that and then you know the way they're
[02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:04.800]  the way they're justifying things like the you know they're capturing
[02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:08.240]  photographs of all of these license plates the idea behind that is
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:12.000]  well we will track drug dealers but that's not really how it gets used
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.040]  eventually it gets used on on everyone everyone's
[02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:18.080]  going to be collected by the government and they're going to they're going to
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:20.560]  put a big database together that's going to have us all in
[02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:23.680]  and they basically admit that i mean they admit that 10 years ago it started
[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:25.760]  just on the border but now it's nationwide
[02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:29.440]  hundreds of millions of people are tracked a year basically everybody
[02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:33.840]  and they're keeping a complete database history of this but governments exempt

[02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:29.680]  battling with the rhino republicans and neocons
[02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:32.960]  and it's that battle i'm talking about right now the big money behind chris
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:36.800]  christie the big money behind jeb bush
[02:37:36.800 --> 02:37:40.720]  i mean i'm sick and i know you know bush and i'm hung out with him and all that
[02:37:40.720 --> 02:37:43.040]  and and and you know like him somewhat joe but
[02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:47.760]  another bush another clinton i just don't think people are going to go for it
[02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:51.040]  but expanding on that i really don't like chris christie i don't
[02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:54.160]  know your view on him at least since we talked last time
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:58.000]  give us your breakdown of what you think of the field of republican candidates i
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:01.040]  mean we should be able to run a ham sandwich against whoever the
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:04.320]  democrats run with all that they've done but
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:07.760]  the republicans just won't deliver what do you see in your crystal ball
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:12.800]  happening and what's the word currently in dc
[02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:16.480]  well he'd be there was a big summit the first really on the side the first of
[02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:21.360]  the 2016 cycle was in iowa on saturday
[02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:24.560]  and i really showcase i was really fascinated to see the new people you're
[02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:27.360]  exactly right um and we had to look to donald trump
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:30.880]  to to literally say it but he said you can't run
[02:38:30.880 --> 02:38:35.120]  mit romney again he ran and he lost you can't have another bush i mean you know
[02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:39.040]  he's got all kinds of problems with with with conservatives and i really
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:42.320]  think he might be a lot of trouble at least you'd have a very hard
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:46.160]  time that's why he that's why he was not one of the candidates in iowa but he
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:49.520]  had a very hard i'm winning states like that i think you know i mean the flip
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:52.960]  flopping that's right yeah so he's got
[02:38:52.960 --> 02:38:56.160]  he's got a lot of baggage and you're right it's another bush i mean you know
[02:38:56.160 --> 02:39:00.320]  where is it it was it was bush's mom who's the your mom of jab and
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:04.080]  george w who said you know do we really need another bush i mean we've had
[02:39:04.080 --> 02:39:07.440]  enough to be a two presidents in that family and that's what's really
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:10.080]  remarkable is right now you know we're looking at
[02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:13.600]  the possibility of it being bush versus clinton which would just be in saturday
[02:39:13.600 --> 02:39:16.240]  i mean having the same people we we apparently
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:20.000]  with 350 million people we've only got two families that could produce
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:23.120]  presidents it's it's crazy so that's what was so
[02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:27.520]  interesting about iowa on saturday was there were some real new people there
[02:39:27.520 --> 02:39:31.680]  with some real new ideas and and chris christie was one of them but
[02:39:31.680 --> 02:39:35.360]  but the real star of the thing the real step out of the day was
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:39.920]  stott walker from wisconsin he really kind of wowed the the crowd they're a very
[02:39:39.920 --> 02:39:42.720]  conservative group um you know hardcore
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:46.880]  grassroots very into politics and they and they went nuts for him so
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:49.600]  he's looking like he might be a very strong contender i just fell on the
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:54.560]  wires today that he's created a um a patch so he's getting ready to go so he
[02:39:54.560 --> 02:39:57.360]  was one of the big stand-ups carly's for you if you're rena
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:00.160]  she was another one it was very fascinating i was very interested to see
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:04.080]  her because she hasn't done a whole lot she's unpopular in
[02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:07.600]  some circles she had some problems that healer packard you know the things
[02:40:07.600 --> 02:40:11.200]  didn't go well there when she left and all that but i mean i hate to be shallow
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:14.160]  she just looks too much like hillary clinton
[02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:18.480]  that's right well she does but she was very strong very very strong speech she
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:22.160]  delivered um and she really she really went went right at
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:25.040]  um and hillary clinton which is an interesting idea that
[02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:29.840]  she may be setting herself up for for a deep um not sure i was being sarcastic
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:34.240]  let me ask you this what about a sarah palan uh ted cruz ticket that just
[02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:39.280]  seems like a super sexy ticket uh and again i've got some problems with palan
[02:40:39.280 --> 02:40:42.800]  i really like ted cruz but remember folks they're a lot better than hillary
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:45.760]  clinton i mean isn't that a hot ticket or rand paul
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:51.040]  sarah palan ticket or is her running as vp not good
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:55.280]  i don't know boy that's tough she she didn't do that well in in iowa
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:58.640]  you know either her teleprompter broke which was some reports or she showed up
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:04.400]  and just decided to swing it but she had a 20 minute spot she spoke for 35 minutes
[02:41:04.400 --> 02:41:09.280]  she did about 12 minutes of thanking people and reminiscing about iowa
[02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:14.640]  it was a rather disjointed and an odd speech but i do like her i mean i do
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:18.800]  like her blouse oh absolutely i mean she she had a
[02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:22.880]  ton of a plot line she really once she got going and once she really got on
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:26.640]  focus she was good and i think and i think that's when i think you know she's
[02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:30.080]  all another one of those people that she's got so much power she could really
[02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:34.000]  put something together in a matter of weeks or a few months and she would be
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:37.280]  a major force she could she could bring huge cash in
[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:40.160]  she's got millions of followers are you talking about her on the top of the
[02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:43.680]  ticket i mean because that would be big if she if she went at the top of the
[02:41:43.680 --> 02:41:46.720]  ticket it would be but i i still get the
[02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:50.160]  feeling that she's that she's not really planning to run i know that she said
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:53.360]  she's interested she told the watch and the post that she was interested but
[02:41:53.360 --> 02:41:57.200]  i really still get the feeling that she's not really going to go i just i just
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:00.800]  see that's the reason i think she's good because she doesn't want power and
[02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:04.640]  look i've got big problems with her on her super hawkish stuff but i just have
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:08.240]  studied her i think the way they demonized her the way they came after
[02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:12.080]  that's why i like ran paul the way they're coming after him
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:16.640]  give me your take on ran paul oh ran paul is a is a serious candidate i think
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:19.600]  he's one of the i think he's one of the top three or four i mean
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:24.480]  what i really see it boiling down so i like ben carson he's usually popular
[02:42:24.480 --> 02:42:28.320]  see arena get a good speech i think it's coming down to about five people it'll
[02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:33.440]  probably be walker ran paul chris christie
[02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:37.120]  rick perry and ted cruise i think those are the the serious ones
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:40.240]  and they all kind of bring something different i think chris he's going to
[02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:44.320]  try to cast himself as as a guy that can do that he's not going to do great in
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:46.800]  in our way he's not going to necessarily do great
[02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:50.640]  you know with conservatives but his point is we need to move a little bit
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:54.480]  past that you need to pick somebody he said a line in iowa where he said
[02:42:54.480 --> 02:42:56.960]  if you want somebody who agrees with you 100 percent of the time look in the
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:42:59.600]  mirror because that's the only one you're going to find
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:02.880]  so we've got it and what his point is he's saying we got to get past
[02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:06.960]  the notion that if we disagree with a candidate or one small thing we're
[02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:09.840]  going we're going to abandon that candidate what he's saying is
[02:43:09.840 --> 02:43:13.200]  we need to find somebody you know whoever it is and we need to
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:16.320]  not hold our noses but we need to get past some of the things that
[02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:19.840]  that we don't necessarily like about him so sure i think he's a strong candidate
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:22.480]  i think i think rick perry is a real sleeper i think
[02:43:22.480 --> 02:43:26.400]  oh i agree people didn't they didn't take him seriously last time he didn't
[02:43:26.400 --> 02:43:29.520]  well he was on painkillers from back surgery i think that's what's something
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:33.520]  that's right yeah and he and he admitted too that he didn't take it as
[02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:37.280]  seriously you know he's run several times in in texas he's about to become
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:40.960]  like the longest-serving governor in texas and he's not already is so but
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:45.360]  he is so so he's um but but he said that he didn't take it as seriously as he
[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:48.560]  should have it's a different world when you go on the national stage and
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:51.680]  and you're right the painkillers and and all that were were bad but
[02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:55.360]  i think he's a serious and he's another guy when you match him up against
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:59.040]  somebody like chris christy you look at the state of texas and you look at the
[02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:02.960]  state of of new jersey and just their their finances their budget where
[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:05.520]  everything's going yeah it's a pretty convincing
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:08.240]  argument that this is a heck of a lot better off than new jersey
[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:11.920]  i think it shows just how horrible the democrats and how radical they are
[02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:16.080]  that that that people like rick perry look good compared to them but but it
[02:44:16.080 --> 02:44:19.440]  expanding on that and i want to get some questions and some comments from our
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:23.600]  crew in there from our reporters who join uh joe curl reporter with us right
[02:44:23.600 --> 02:44:27.520]  now from right read dot com formally with drudge report
[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:30.880]  dot com and also with washington times dot com
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:36.080]  when you look at this everybody's saying be moderate republicans to get
[02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:39.680]  democrats to vote with you when you look at the state of the country the
[02:44:39.680 --> 02:44:43.280]  anger democrats voting for tea party people in some cases that they're so
[02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:48.240]  upset i think being a radical constitutionalist
[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:52.240]  and not compromising and really demonizing obama
[02:44:52.240 --> 02:44:55.600]  and running against obama and four more years of hillary
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:45:01.760]  is basically is what uh obama's been or or you know eight more years is just the
[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:05.040]  continuation of the clinton's i think if people get hardcore and aggressive
[02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:08.560]  they're going to win in the landslide but if they try to become the democrats
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:10.880]  they're going to lose what do you say
[02:45:10.880 --> 02:45:14.640]  well that's that's and that that's the real split right now between
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:17.680]  that's where that's where christie's trying to position herself and that's
[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:21.680]  where he's trying to position himself as that compromise candidate but there are
[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:24.240]  a lot of awful lot of people who are looking at him saying
[02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:27.840]  hey we just did that part we did that with we did that with mccain we did that
[02:45:27.840 --> 02:45:30.160]  with romney we we didn't like him they weren't
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:32.960]  conservative enough for us but we held our nose and we
[02:45:32.960 --> 02:45:36.160]  you know in the case of romney five million people didn't show up to the
[02:45:36.160 --> 02:45:39.680]  polls they just said yeah i'm the like i don't like you do i i'm not showing
[02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:42.000]  sure i mean we had a landslide for tea party and
[02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:46.000]  and conservatives because they did demonize you've got to demonize
[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:49.520]  out of control corruption because it is evil
[02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:52.800]  i mean we're not painting it something and isn't i want to go to our reporters
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:56.240]  for comments and questions jacari jackson in there in the info wars dot
[02:45:56.240 --> 02:46:00.080]  com studios in the control room uh jacari what's your take on this
[02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:02.960]  political realignment and the republican field
[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:08.640]  i want to ask mr kerr for as far as the political climate we see a lot of the
[02:46:08.640 --> 02:46:10.880]  republican wins you know they had a big win
[02:46:10.880 --> 02:46:15.680]  in the midterms but now that people see that they haven't done much since then
[02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:17.920]  you know a lot of things that the republican
[02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:21.440]  uh fan base wanted to see done hasn't been done they've been pretty much sitting
[02:46:21.440 --> 02:46:24.720]  on their hands so are we at a time coming up with this
[02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:27.600]  presidential election that you guys have been talking about when people are
[02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:31.280]  going to realize that there isn't a whole lot of difference between the
[02:46:31.280 --> 02:46:34.320]  republicans and the democrats by large you know you do have some standout
[02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:37.280]  candidates such as rand paul's to ted cruises who at least
[02:46:37.280 --> 02:46:41.280]  you know talk the good game i want to ask mr curl if you really sees a
[02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:45.440]  uh changing paradigm which is people are always figuring out meet the new boss
[02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:48.640]  same as the old boss but people are getting mad quicker and quicker used to
[02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:52.320]  take years now it takes months i yeah that's a great question
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:56.240]  does the political power structure realize how angry people are
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:47:00.400]  joseph well that's it that's it is a great question because that's exactly
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:05.040]  what you're right it's you know in some ways the republicans just got in
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:08.320]  they just took over january 6th it's only been a few weeks
[02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:10.960]  but you're right people are frustrated already and they're already looking at
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:15.120]  them and saying you know first they they could barely pick a speaker and then
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:18.400]  you know they they can't get it together on a portion that was a big debacle
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:21.600]  where they didn't know what they wanted and they voted you know some republicans
[02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:23.840]  voted against it and they had to re-vote it
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:26.880]  i even got the the whole mess with with keystone where
[02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:29.760]  you know they couldn't they couldn't pull enough votes together they said they
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:32.640]  had 60 they only ended up with 53 or 54
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:36.240]  so you're right people are getting frustrated quickly and and again just
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:39.760]  like just like obama did in the state of the union where he ignored the
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:43.840]  notion that you know he was addressing 50 or 60
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:47.520]  brand new republicans who are in that room that weren't there the last time he
[02:47:47.520 --> 02:47:51.280]  gave a state of the union so he should have he really a lot of people have
[02:47:51.280 --> 02:47:55.760]  said i'll veto anything you you know you try to block me on anything i'm doing
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:48:01.600]  open borders turning off the power i will veto that i mean it's just the arrogance
[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:04.880]  but that's and then that's the real problem right now that that's happening
[02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:08.960]  with the republican party is they're looking to and this is this is again
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:12.560]  a problem with keeping the establishment of mcconnell
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:16.320]  and veiner there they're looking now to negotiate
[02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:20.720]  and and compromise with this president when in fact what the voters did
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:24.000]  when they put these guys in was they said go in there and take it to them they
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:27.280]  didn't want them to go in and make deals with obama
[02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:31.600]  and settle for half of everything you want and let him get away with amnesty
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:34.640]  and and deficit spending and all the things that he's doing
[02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:38.480]  but but the republicans now are really are starting to appear as if
[02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:41.920]  they're gonna they're gonna pull the line and try to work with this guy your
[02:48:41.920 --> 02:48:45.440]  point alex is exactly where a lot of people say the republican party
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:49.520]  needs to go is get angry about this get up in the girls about it get up in
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:51.920]  their face and and battle it make it make it
[02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:55.600]  well sure i mean just from political points even though we know banners is
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:48:59.280]  horrible he could have at least started committee hearings on repeal of obama
[02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:02.640]  care or part of it they're not doing jack
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:06.400]  squat i mean it's so clear that they know there's such pressure
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:09.600]  they don't want to let one inch of resistance in because it'll bring the
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:12.640]  whole house of cards down and save the country
[02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:16.480]  uh i want to go back to the reporters john bound with jacari
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:20.400]  jackson uh bound what's your take on this got any questions or comments for
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:25.520]  curl uh yeah mr curl pleasure um
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:29.520]  good good i just wanted to uh reiterate
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:33.680]  the wealth that exists in congress and in the presidency
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:37.440]  the the presidential campaign has increased
[02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:40.640]  every campaign by two to three billion dollars
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:45.200]  so and then we have uh people in congress that costs on average about three
[02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:47.920]  and a half million dollars to get into congress
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:51.120]  they're completely out of touch with the american people you're talking about how
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:54.000]  most of democrats are worth hundreds of millions but want to raise taxes on poor
[02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:57.360]  people well and republicans too they're all in it together i know but if you
[02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:00.000]  look at the top 15 it's all democrats i mean
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:03.520]  again i'm not against rich people it's that they're for wealth redistribution
[02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:06.720]  but then exempt themselves from most the taxes i'm gonna let you come back with
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:10.480]  more of that bound and finish up your point but briefly curl uh
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:15.600]  what do you think of that well that's that's again that's that's where
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:18.720]  everything's going right now if you're looking at you know you finally got the
[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:22.640]  coat leather so that i get into this because it's full of about 750 billion
[02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:26.000]  but you look at people like florist and and who's backing
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.600]  the democrats and again you've got the liberal media saying oh there's so much
[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:32.400]  conservative money in it they're controlling everything
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:36.800]  quietly the democrats and liberal you know liberal money is enormous of what's
[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:41.600]  happening there so you're right it's it's now being controlled by these two
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:45.200]  groups of billions of dollars and that's where we're going to go in 2016 it's
[02:50:45.200 --> 02:50:48.240]  going to be again you know he accidentally
[02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:52.480]  higher than it costs to run like sure sure well america is really
[02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:55.520]  you're absolutely right i mean america is up for sale special interest and
[02:50:55.520 --> 02:50:57.680]  that's the bigger problem that's why there's no difference
[02:50:57.680 --> 02:51:02.640]  at the very top my name is clad age 59 and i reside in florid south carolina
[02:51:02.640 --> 02:51:05.440]  the doctor's diagnosis me is having clogged arteries
[02:51:05.440 --> 02:51:08.880]  felt like i was carrying heavy concrete blocks around my feet and legs

[02:51:13.040 --> 02:51:16.960]  and not like a young man again it's unbelievable that an herbal formula can

[02:54:34.480 --> 02:54:37.520]  so busy with our projects we're ready to start to
[02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:40.080]  hookups the promotion here in just the next few months

[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:01.120]  procrastinating on the subconscious level because it's scary
[02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:04.080]  maybe why some candidates that are better don't want to run for president
[02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:06.960]  because you know you're going to get attacked but we're about to go to the
[02:55:06.960 --> 02:55:10.720]  next level uh joe curled is also expanding when he's
[02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:13.440]  doing not just working some with rudgereport.com or
[02:55:13.440 --> 02:55:17.680]  washingtontimes.com but rightread.com um i wanted you to be able to finish your
[02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:20.880]  comment off what john bound said but john you had another point as well then
[02:55:20.880 --> 02:55:24.240]  we'll get a final point from chicari then we're going to go to overdrive and let
[02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:28.640]  you guys finish up uh john bound yeah i just want to ask joe because he
[02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:33.920]  witnessed the uh iowa debacle well the attempt to getting the american
[02:55:33.920 --> 02:55:39.040]  trust and it seems that the public trust has been lost uh was
[02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:44.320]  scott walker's popularity result of the fact that he doesn't have as much
[02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:51.360]  dirt on him uh i.e christ christie's traffic gate scandal so on so forth
[02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:54.960]  absolutely and and you're right i think i think one of the things that
[02:55:54.960 --> 02:55:59.040]  that that really resonated when when walker was talking was
[02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:03.040]  the the mistrust in government the and and and the fact that you know he didn't
[02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:06.720]  didn't go as far as as mid romney and saying 47 percent of
[02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:09.920]  people are just sucking off the government team but what he did say was
[02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:14.480]  you don't measure the government excuse me by by how much you get from the
[02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:17.440]  government how many people are dependent on you measure government by
[02:56:17.440 --> 02:56:22.000]  how few people are dependent on so he got a lot of applause there we got a lot
[02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:25.840]  of applause when he when he talked about which he did very successfully taking
[02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:30.480]  on the unions in in wisconsin and and winning you know he's won three
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:33.680]  three battles three elections in less than four years
[02:56:33.680 --> 02:56:37.680]  so he's really he's really been tested and a lot of the things he talked about
[02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:42.480]  resonated with when he when he got to the the the big government small
[02:56:42.480 --> 02:56:47.360]  government intrusive government debate and and people really really took
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:50.960]  took to that to that message well i think it's the democrats demonizing him
[02:56:50.960 --> 02:56:54.400]  that makes people like him i mean when rand paul's getting demonized his poll
[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:58.000]  numbers go up and then you know he thinks being nice the democrats will make
[02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.720]  him like you more know the answer is get attacked
[02:57:00.720 --> 02:57:03.920]  that's what people see as the badge of certification
[02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:08.720]  final question comes from jacari jackson to joseph curl jacari your final
[02:57:08.720 --> 02:57:13.040]  question or statement for joe curl yeah mr curl we saw with the last
[02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:16.960]  presidential election governor rick perry who i believe today said he would
[02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:20.240]  announce his plans or lack thereof come may or june
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:23.360]  last time he had a pretty tough time dillis dealing with the garter sale
[02:57:23.360 --> 02:57:27.600]  questions coming from mrs bachman do you anticipate him having
[02:57:27.600 --> 02:57:31.440]  additional issues i know you talked about the pain killers and him entering
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:34.240]  the race late what's his week underbelly that's a
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:39.440]  great question jacari well you guys don't well there you guys
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:42.400]  you guys live with them every day there and then that state but um
[02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:46.480]  but yeah he's got he's got he's got baggage and he's got problems he's been
[02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:49.120]  you know i think that now actually i think that's another problem that that's
[02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:52.000]  their pillar has i think those those two both have it is that
[02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:55.120]  they get pigeonholed they get defined and whether it's
[02:57:55.120 --> 02:57:59.200]  right or wrong good or bad they get defined and unfortunately they sort of
[02:57:59.200 --> 02:58:03.680]  take that definition sarah paleon has i think rick i think rick perry has
[02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:06.880]  and they're going to have to battle against us to get back out of it and
[02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:10.160]  and reestablish their credentials but but perry's most
[02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:13.920]  boy you could do it he's not oh i agree and you know americans love a good
[02:58:13.920 --> 02:58:18.240]  soap opera imagine a rick perry sarah paleon ticket
[02:58:18.240 --> 02:58:22.640]  wow people that was i mean the media would go after that wouldn't they
[02:58:22.640 --> 02:58:25.680]  sure would they would have a field day but boy with that with that

[03:00:36.400 --> 03:00:39.040]  hosting the news i'll just say this obviously i don't
[03:00:39.040 --> 03:00:42.160]  like rick perry for being a democrat in the past being
[03:00:42.160 --> 03:00:45.040]  anti-gun before he was pro-gun for his guard of sale
[03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:48.560]  for but i mean let's just be honest there's no lesser or two evils but
[03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:52.400]  compared to obama or hillary i mean there's just nothing worse
[03:00:52.400 --> 03:00:56.720]  these are would-be stallants doesn't mean i like rick perry doesn't mean i'm
[03:00:56.720 --> 03:00:59.440]  going to be all i want ted cruiser ran paul
[03:00:59.440 --> 03:01:03.600]  that's why they're being demonized uh we're just discussing who's on the field
[03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:07.040]  in this race and looking at different ones so i want to be clear
[03:01:07.040 --> 03:01:11.040]  i get it's controlled i get all that i i'm just i know they're attacking the
[03:01:11.040 --> 03:01:14.160]  tea party we got a chance of taking the country back
[03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:18.160]  we can win now finishing up with about a minute and a half each
[03:01:18.160 --> 03:01:21.760]  uh john bound what else do you think is the top story of the day
[03:01:21.760 --> 03:01:25.200]  uh well i just saw this particular story here if you guys want to bring this up
[03:01:25.200 --> 03:01:30.480]  on nine the cuba tot shrinks an entire house into one
[03:01:30.480 --> 03:01:36.080]  compact cube and that's the plan they want to put us in remote control cars
[03:01:36.080 --> 03:01:39.200]  and remotely drive us back to our little cubes
[03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:43.680]  and pretend that the political theater is real and
[03:01:43.680 --> 03:01:48.800]  you know go into a holographic reality with the microsoft's new hologram
[03:01:48.800 --> 03:01:52.960]  technology and they're well on their way
[03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:56.480]  and we're just being pushed we're just being pushed
[03:01:56.480 --> 03:02:03.360]  into a reality that we're all aware is happening it's all
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:08.640]  getting the pace at which the news is progressing is moving faster and
[03:02:08.640 --> 03:02:12.160]  faster and faster every day interesting to have joe curlon
[03:02:12.160 --> 03:02:16.640]  because drudge reports started it with monica lewinsky and now we are we have
[03:02:16.640 --> 03:02:21.840]  bill clinton and this new sex scandal which you know we're we're so used to
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:26.080]  at this point you know so we've gotten tyranny fatigue
[03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:28.960]  and that's a great point the new article in info wars dot com should go
[03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:32.400]  mega viral it probably won't uk government announces planned remotely
[03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:35.680]  control vehicles and this is from the government website that they will take
[03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:39.520]  control and remote control your car to save the earth and to lower
[03:02:39.520 --> 03:02:43.280]  carbon emissions and tax you i mean they've put all this in the cars
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:47.760]  premeditatedly it's complete lunacy and it's like thurs one one three eight
[03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:52.480]  live in the cube there's no room you know it's a wasteland outside the city
[03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:56.800]  jacari jackson yeah talking about these these smart cars
[03:02:56.800 --> 03:03:00.640]  so so forth we've heard i believe it was the fbi came out last year and said
[03:03:00.640 --> 03:03:03.600]  that these things can easily be hacked we've seen several articles i know
[03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:06.160]  we've done articles and videos about this recently
[03:03:06.160 --> 03:03:09.600]  these technologies and these smart cars and not only can they be hacked
[03:03:09.600 --> 03:03:13.120]  but this information is also being given to big brother so it's not just
[03:03:13.120 --> 03:03:16.160]  your cell phone or your ipad or whatever else
[03:03:16.160 --> 03:03:19.520]  they can also get the information from your car and we also saw your smart
[03:03:19.520 --> 03:03:22.880]  tv's that's right the world's being designed for a government and corporate
[03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:25.840]  hack to run our lives and they're telling us
[03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:30.080]  we're going to control your thermostat control your car it's in our face jacari
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:33.440]  oh that's exactly right you know they're taking the choice away from me
[03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:37.280]  so you can't decide if you want to have your house hot if you want to drive fast
[03:03:37.280 --> 03:03:40.640]  or whatever and everybody says well it's going to make everything safer
[03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:43.360]  well i don't see how it's going to make everything safer you think about a
[03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:46.400]  computer crash if you have a a malfunction with your phone
[03:03:46.400 --> 03:03:49.200]  inside your deal but if you're driving 70 miles an hour in your car
[03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:52.720]  malfunctions that's a pretty big uh circumstance
[03:03:52.720 --> 03:03:56.240]  well you know how many glitches are in iphones and stuff imagine when your car
[03:03:56.240 --> 03:03:58.640]  glitches out and that's already happening we know government's already killed
[03:03:58.640 --> 03:04:01.760]  people with the remote control stuff that's been in cars for two decades
[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:04.560]  they've got total remote control the last four or five years with all the new
[03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:07.920]  cars this is a serious situation this is the plan
[03:04:07.920 --> 03:04:11.280]  it is a conspiracy and it's being done to enslave us
[03:04:11.280 --> 03:04:15.440]  not to empower us we need to wake up to it and say no
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:19.920]  any closing comments jacari well i'll end with the security theater we're talking
[03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:22.640]  about earlier the drone that flew over the white house
[03:04:22.640 --> 03:04:26.160]  and recently we've seen uh the most recent drone we've seen people jump the
[03:04:26.160 --> 03:04:29.440]  white house fence run into the white house that john
[03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:32.000]  bound was talking about the young lady who was shot
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:34.960]  outside the white house they're trying to build a case to build an iron wall around it
[03:04:34.960 --> 03:04:38.000]  yeah it's pretty much it they put up the barricades the barricades that people
[03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:40.880]  tore down it's just complete security theater and if they can't
[03:04:40.880 --> 03:04:43.920]  secure the white house how can they secure you john bound and you know the
[03:04:43.920 --> 03:04:47.440]  warning that something big is coming soon from ices
[03:04:47.440 --> 03:04:51.200]  something bigger than 9-11 and when they blow up a city with a nuke or something
[03:04:51.200 --> 03:04:54.160]  no one will point out that they were funded and created by our own government
[03:04:54.160 --> 03:04:57.600]  thank you so much gentlemen great job to the crew nightly news tonight seven
