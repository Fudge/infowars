[00:00.000 --> 00:21.160]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:21.160 --> 00:28.720]  When we are successful and we will win, we have a real chance at this new world order.
[00:28.720 --> 00:30.720]  New world order.
[00:30.720 --> 00:32.720]  New world order.
[00:32.720 --> 00:34.720]  New world order.
[00:34.720 --> 00:36.720]  New world order.
[00:36.720 --> 00:38.720]  New world order.
[00:38.720 --> 00:48.720]  I believe we, and particularly you, your class has an incredible window of opportunity to lead and shape you.
[00:48.720 --> 00:52.720]  A new world order for the 21st century.
[00:52.720 --> 01:04.720]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[01:04.720 --> 01:06.720]  New world order.
[01:06.720 --> 01:16.720]  We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order when we are successful.
[01:16.720 --> 01:20.720]  We have a real chance at this new world order.
[01:20.720 --> 01:24.720]  We have a real chance at this new world order.
[01:24.720 --> 01:31.720]  We'll explode the site. We'll put back in place. Especially with reopening and people going back to pubs and stuff.
[01:31.720 --> 01:38.720]  Our exposure site will be put back in place to be enlisted once we are reopening.
[01:38.720 --> 01:44.720]  We will be looking at what contact tracing looks like in the new world order.
[01:44.720 --> 01:49.760]  spike in the new world order and yes it will be cubs and clubs and other things if we have a positive
[01:49.760 --> 01:54.720]  case there. Our response may be differently, different if we know that people are fully vaccinated
[01:54.720 --> 02:21.920]  so we're working through a number of those issues but we will have to reflect and learn
[02:24.720 --> 02:41.920]  all over the world the forced injections of the experimental cocktail is being carried out and
[02:41.920 --> 02:48.640]  it's confirmed in major published studies that it has nano metallic material in it to track and
[02:48.640 --> 02:56.720]  trace you as a world ID guess who owns and controls those patents you guessed it Bill Gates the
[02:56.720 --> 03:01.760]  United Nations and others all right this is going to be an incredible transmission today
[03:03.760 --> 03:07.440]  the federal government's VAERS reporting system where they estimate conservatively
[03:07.440 --> 03:12.160]  one in ten bad reactions gets reported studies are out there saying it's more like one in 42
[03:12.160 --> 03:19.200]  so it's 40 plus times worse whether it's 10 or 42 times worse it's massive 70 deaths a day
[03:19.200 --> 03:24.240]  tracked back and confirmed on VAERS to be accurate reports by physicians and nurses and others
[03:25.200 --> 03:32.480]  of 70 deaths a day but don't worry Israel just started studying the long-term effects
[03:32.480 --> 03:37.040]  of these injections and say they may know in a few years kind of like a month ago the FDA said oh
[03:37.040 --> 03:43.680]  it's now approved and they approved a name of a vaccine that isn't even out yet for 2025 and said
[03:43.680 --> 03:49.520]  that will be approved the level of lying like the surgeon general saying oh you don't want
[03:49.520 --> 03:55.920]  learned immunity natural immunity it's not any good and Fauci got asked by Sanjay Gupta I have to
[03:55.920 --> 04:00.320]  know who talked to Sanjay Gupta and said do you have a soul are you part of the mass murder
[04:00.320 --> 04:05.920]  you know you're you're a smart guy you're a scientist you're a doctor you know all the
[04:05.920 --> 04:11.840]  literature shows it's 13 27 a hundred times depending on what it is better than these injections
[04:12.800 --> 04:17.040]  and Gupta said I know you're right I'll I'll I'll ask Fauci about it and Fauci did
[04:17.680 --> 04:21.200]  you didn't got to ask about you said oh I just can't answer that because you don't want to get pinned
[04:21.200 --> 04:29.840]  down on saying Fauci is the molecule for water H2O he's like I just don't know I just don't know
[04:30.720 --> 04:33.680]  well I mean what how do you make a water molecule I just I don't know
[04:33.680 --> 04:38.480]  know because he they're denying that water exists are denying the natural immunity exists
[04:38.480 --> 04:43.520]  so instead of being pinned down like the surgeon general it was a flaming little punk liar mag killer
[04:44.080 --> 04:48.080]  who oh by the way good job surgeon general he helped advise Australians come out to block
[04:48.080 --> 04:51.920]  ivermectin so there'll be mass death there now as well oh AP had to retract another story about

[07:08.720 --> 07:13.120]  actually we are doing it now when you know behavioral psychology that's called jerking
[07:13.120 --> 07:18.000]  people around it's called gas lighting called trauma-based mind control to manipulate your
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.040]  emotions and flip them on and off until like drugs mess up your brain receptors well so does emotions
[07:23.040 --> 07:27.680]  like this over and over again where you just finally give up and roll over unless you're
[07:27.680 --> 07:33.840]  conscious of it and harden your resolve and decide to make the pressure like weights you're lifting
[07:33.840 --> 07:38.080]  make you stronger that's what i've done and i was not a person that enjoyed being lied about in the
[07:38.080 --> 07:44.480]  tactic demonized and and and everything else you can imagine but i've now learned thanks to the holy
[07:44.480 --> 07:49.680]  spirit to transmute it and not in a masochistic way but in another way to understand it means i'm
[07:49.680 --> 07:55.520]  over the target to actually forgive my enemies to a great extent still not perfect and to take it on
[07:55.520 --> 08:03.200]  as energy and to be able to take those attacks and kind of like yoda does with count duke who
[08:03.200 --> 08:08.160]  to use another cheesy star wars analogy i am i am learning to take the lightning bolt attacks and just
[08:09.760 --> 08:13.920]  thank you for that meal because i understand i'm over the target i'm going to take that hate and
[08:13.920 --> 08:19.360]  that all of it's turning around to love and make my persistence to you that much stronger and then
[08:19.360 --> 08:29.120]  urnus ramirez speaking of love his son played sports great shape of if anything skinny uh
[08:29.120 --> 08:34.880]  you know just like i was at 16 and took them in a shot because they said it was safe and effective
[08:34.880 --> 08:38.480]  they wanted to help people and was dead five days later from a giant large cart when he went out to
[08:38.480 --> 08:43.040]  play basketball he just got started fell over dead and they told him in large part of the hospital
[08:43.040 --> 08:48.160]  probably from the vaccine uh he spoke at the capital air in texas in austin and uh it started
[08:48.160 --> 08:53.520]  going viral after he was on saturday and he'd been talking for weeks and they said you are not
[08:53.520 --> 08:58.400]  allowed to do that post and banned him so that's up on info wars dot com the article about it and
[08:58.400 --> 09:04.160]  then we've posted there the interview with him that got him censored that he was even a local fox
[09:04.800 --> 09:09.440]  they said you're not allowed to talk about your dead son we killed him and now big media with big

[10:52.080 --> 10:57.920]  marketing department this is the state of south carolina we'll meet with the marketing department

[12:10.480 --> 12:14.400]  at quote red states to further divide the public and claim the red states are making everybody

[18:04.720 --> 18:09.280]  happening in the atmosphere but if you look at all the different studies reports about my nasa
[18:09.280 --> 18:13.440]  and other governments other agencies they all disagree on what's really happening with the
[18:13.440 --> 18:21.520]  climate the only constant the only great truth is change is the only constant so yes climate change
[18:21.520 --> 18:26.400]  is totally real but notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s 80s and then
[18:26.400 --> 18:29.520]  it's gonna be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to
[18:29.520 --> 18:35.280]  okay now it's just climate change but did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing
[18:35.280 --> 18:40.480]  when it comes to the united nations and the department of energy and bill gates and the
[18:40.480 --> 18:46.720]  un they have weather control trees for 1979 bill gates has been manipulating the weather for a
[18:46.720 --> 18:52.080]  very long time in fact back in 1994 two scientists won a Nobel prize for an idea of spring different
[18:52.080 --> 18:56.560]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather so yes man-made climate change is real
[18:56.560 --> 19:04.560]  if you think the puppet president joe bite coming out and announcing that a hundred
[19:04.560 --> 19:09.280]  million americans are going to be forced to take experimental shots or lose their jobs
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.520]  understand we know the blueprint of the un they stated their plan contact tracers coming to your
[19:15.520 --> 19:21.840]  house 10 forced injections a year the destruction of your immune system the depopulation of the
[19:21.840 --> 19:27.760]  planet and the vaccine passport on your quote iphone or droid tracking and tracing everything
[19:27.760 --> 19:32.160]  you do and telling you when you can go outside your house or where you can go not just for
[19:32.160 --> 19:39.040]  covid-19 but for carbon taxes so as i've said a thousand times submission is death you give into
[19:39.040 --> 19:43.520]  this just for your job or to be able to go to the bar or to be able to quote flying an airplane
[19:44.080 --> 19:49.120]  then they're going to slowly put the screws in with these apps on your phone to control where
[19:49.120 --> 19:54.400]  you go and what you do and dog train you ride a total slavery this is criminal it's illegal
[19:54.400 --> 20:21.680]  it's tyranny and we must resist and not comply you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:21.680 --> 20:31.040]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones live from austin texas
[20:31.040 --> 20:42.800]  broadcasting worldwide from the info wars dot com studios
[20:46.160 --> 20:50.160]  all right we have got so much incredible news to break down and cover today
[20:50.160 --> 20:57.360]  but this segment i want to get into this incredible group of stories now i'm not
[20:57.360 --> 21:01.840]  going to play all the old clips just to give you a background of all the hot mics in canada
[21:01.840 --> 21:08.720]  and australia and germany and the united states like with governor wolf and pennsylvania and
[21:08.720 --> 21:13.360]  they're on the stage and they say on the hot mic yeah just put your mask on when you come up just
[21:13.360 --> 21:20.160]  for just for looks you know just for just for the effect well that's child's play compared to the new
[21:20.160 --> 21:26.400]  stuff we've got and this is in hebrus we're just gonna play the b-roll hot mic catches israeli
[21:26.400 --> 21:32.240]  health minister admitting vaccine passports are about coercion to make everyone take the shots
[21:32.800 --> 21:37.520]  and attract and control and create a live tracking system
[21:37.520 --> 21:48.080]  so that's the point this whole system has gotten to unaware that he was on a hot mic
[21:48.080 --> 21:54.640]  and being broadcast live on the tv station israeli health minister nitzan horowitz admitted
[21:54.640 --> 22:00.320]  that vaccine passports were primarily about coercing skeptical people to get the vaccine
[22:00.320 --> 22:06.080]  quote imposing green pass rules on certain venues is needed only to pressure people of
[22:06.080 --> 22:11.040]  the public to get vaccinated oh really and not for medical reasons oh yeah because the vaccine
[22:11.040 --> 22:16.720]  doesn't work you can still spread this is bad or died sunday ahead of the weekly cabinet meeting
[22:16.720 --> 22:25.760]  reports a jewish news syndicate so you see there you go and then he goes on to admit that it does
[22:25.760 --> 22:29.520]  nothing that you can give it to somebody just as easy if you've been vaccinated that's all about
[22:29.520 --> 22:36.720]  control i suggest you go and see that for yourself let's continue here's another one shock leaked
[22:36.720 --> 22:40.320]  video this came out over the weekend so it's halfway down the page one in four wars dot com
[22:40.320 --> 22:45.840]  i suggest you share this is even more powerful shocked leak video top democrats discuss need to
[22:45.840 --> 22:52.960]  inflate the real covid numbers to be quote more scary to the public and if you listen to them they
[22:52.960 --> 22:57.760]  know they're on a zoom meeting with the public has access to sort of like you know we need to count
[22:57.760 --> 23:03.440]  people who've gotten over but are still in the hospital and she goes out or you know other
[23:03.440 --> 23:09.040]  conditions uh you know he goes why they're like we already list that she goes she's the boss he goes
[23:09.040 --> 23:15.040]  you know what i mean and he goes okay well let's talk with marketing later because you want to
[23:15.040 --> 23:19.440]  put out fraudulent numbers you go to prison for that even though it's time to force so he's like
[23:19.440 --> 23:22.480]  let's do it through marketing which can be complete bs
[23:22.480 --> 23:29.840]  yes these people are just the scum of the earth and that's why they don't want you know about
[23:29.840 --> 23:39.280]  hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin or zinc or c or d all of the because they make 53 000 per person
[23:39.280 --> 23:44.560]  that is intubated it's very very sad you know i'll tell you more about this later
[23:44.560 --> 23:50.160]  with the lady i had on saturday about her husband on the west coast being you know intubated not
[23:50.160 --> 23:55.040]  letting him have ivermectin and things he died he died in just a few hours after she was on very
[23:55.040 --> 23:59.840]  very sad now you see that full interview again in the saturday 9 11 special that's five and a half
[23:59.840 --> 24:06.560]  hours long pretty powerful transmission but let's get to this video the following backlash hospital
[24:06.560 --> 24:13.040]  released a statement claiming doctors talks to deceive public was simply a frank discussion so
[24:13.040 --> 24:19.120]  deceiving just frank thought was the opposite senior doctors in new hanover county north carolina
[24:19.120 --> 24:24.480]  were caught on video scheming how to inflate the real covet numbers so they can more easily
[24:24.480 --> 24:29.440]  scare the public into taking the covet injection they talk about how it's marketing
[24:31.360 --> 24:38.800]  so let's go ahead and roll this little piece of video here it is the dashboard and how it's set
[24:38.800 --> 24:45.680]  up myself as far as how we get information out to the community on meaningful numbers we set on a
[24:45.680 --> 24:50.960]  weekly basis so that's on our website and we've been sharing that through social channels as well
[24:50.960 --> 24:56.240]  particularly those graphics that show the number of patients and how's the percentage of them that are
[24:57.280 --> 25:03.520]  unvaccinated the percentage of unvaccinated people in the icu and the percentage of deaths
[25:03.520 --> 25:10.080]  and the numbers so those are numbers that we put out as far as we don't get into details of floor
[25:10.080 --> 25:19.200]  or right those other numbers are certainly out there right i guess my feeling at this point
[25:19.200 --> 25:27.040]  in time is maybe we need to be completely a little bit more scary for the public then there's
[25:27.040 --> 25:31.680]  another comment as i completely agree there are many people still hospitalized that were considered
[25:31.680 --> 25:39.360]  post-covid but we're not counting in those numbers so how do we include those post-covid people in
[25:39.360 --> 25:46.480]  the numbers of patients we have in the hospital so is that all the people who have been in the
[25:46.480 --> 25:51.360]  hospital since the beginning of coven well or that are still in and that's something that i could
[25:51.360 --> 25:55.840]  take to someone else but i think those are important numbers that patients that are still in the
[25:55.840 --> 26:02.720]  hospital that are often called before but still are occupying the hospital for a variety of reasons
[26:02.720 --> 26:08.720]  okay harrell and we call those i'm sorry we we're calling those recovered now if you look at the
[26:08.720 --> 26:16.080]  nabont health dashboard they're listed as recovered but i do think it from our standpoint we would
[26:16.080 --> 26:21.680]  still consider them a coveted patient because they're still healing yeah so i think that that
[26:21.680 --> 26:26.720]  needs to be highlighted as well yeah because once they're all isolation and drop from the
[26:26.720 --> 26:34.560]  coveted numbers that's exactly right kelvin we can talk offline how we run that up to marketing
[26:34.560 --> 26:40.000]  right so i was gonna say i think we have to be more blunt we have to be more forestful we have
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.800]  to say something coming out you know you don't get vaccinated you know you're gonna die i mean let's
[26:44.800 --> 26:50.960]  just let's just be really blunt to these people and that's what they're doing all over the world
[26:50.960 --> 26:56.720]  there is the creature um that the ring wraith and once into your body with something that doesn't
[26:56.720 --> 27:01.440]  protect you and lowers your immune system they lied about first oh nine i percent of people
[27:01.440 --> 27:06.400]  in the hospital are dying didn't have the shot all made up all the life because they were using
[27:06.400 --> 27:12.160]  two thousand numbers saying everyone dying has not been vaccinated because there wasn't a freaking
[27:12.160 --> 27:18.400]  shot then and now they lie don't count you if you die with 14 days from your first or second
[27:18.400 --> 27:22.800]  injection they don't count you as covered you add those numbers back in way higher death rates and
[27:22.800 --> 27:27.680]  hospital rates just like israel singapore and other areas but these monsters are making a lot
[27:27.680 --> 27:31.040]  of money you know how much a hospital administrator makes now that's running these type of black ops
[27:32.320 --> 27:40.400]  half a mill more a mill and they have found the trash of the planet that will do anything
[27:40.400 --> 27:46.880]  they're told and that's who they put in charge but imagine if the little nilly guy that's going
[27:46.880 --> 27:50.320]  to help her now why don't y'all let's do this off here sweet so you get a little bit you little
[27:50.320 --> 27:55.360]  sassy pants there let's meet with marketing later if you look like skeletor hitler we'd be
[27:55.360 --> 28:00.880]  arresting them but because they're all oh i'm wearing liberal glasses oh i'm a little liberal
[28:00.880 --> 28:05.600]  it's like oh well that's okay oh tim cook runs death camps and they have suicide nets around the
[28:05.600 --> 28:10.560]  factories they work 18 hours a day and force will be sterilized women they've got weavers the main

[28:16.160 --> 28:22.240]  wears turtlenecks he's skinny talks like this oh and then cook oh we bend alex jones is that all
[28:22.240 --> 28:28.240]  right of course we did and then here it is right here they're burning books now all over the world

[29:08.000 --> 29:13.200]  it's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death you probably
[29:13.200 --> 29:18.320]  already believe that i certainly do so here's the thing i wanted to get past the craziness and find

[34:20.560 --> 34:25.200]  as well just not as bad off and they they use psychological warfare techniques behavioral
[34:25.200 --> 34:31.920]  psychology why i said on friday when the uk announced okay we're not gonna do vaccine passports
[34:31.920 --> 34:36.560]  till the end of the winter maybe not ever and i said watch in a couple weeks they're gonna announce
[34:36.560 --> 34:41.920]  they are that's what they always do and they did they actually came out today quicker than i thought
[34:41.920 --> 34:47.520]  uk government says vaccine passports integral to covet winner plan day after they're supposedly
[34:47.520 --> 34:52.240]  scrapped to break this down and talk about the millions hitting the streets protesting there
[34:52.240 --> 35:00.160]  and around the world and so much more is the proprietor of summit dot news paul joseph watch
[35:00.160 --> 35:05.120]  and paul thanks for coming on with us give us the latest good to be back alex yeah as he mentioned
[35:05.120 --> 35:11.120]  we had an announcement on sunday from the new vaccines minister savitt jabbet who said that
[35:11.120 --> 35:16.000]  the plans for a vaccine passport had been completely ruled out he said that they were
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.960]  quite a huge intrusion into people's lives he said i'm pleased to say that they will not be going
[35:20.960 --> 35:28.000]  ahead well just as we had the headlines back in december alex at the end of last year gove claims
[35:28.000 --> 35:34.000]  government not considering vaccine passports we had another one uk vaccine minister uten absolutely
[35:34.000 --> 35:41.200]  no plans for covet passports within 24 hours of this announcement yesterday the government has
[35:41.200 --> 35:47.760]  come out and said that covet passports will be the front line of defense against any winter
[35:47.760 --> 35:55.120]  wave of covet if cases saw if hospitalization saw and we know they will alex and that's the
[35:55.120 --> 35:59.840]  scam that they're playing they're saying don't worry there'll be no new mask mandates there'll
[35:59.840 --> 36:06.560]  be no vaccine passports no new lockdowns boris johnson said today but they're willing if cases of
[36:06.560 --> 36:10.800]  coronavirus start to rise again and we know they're going to start to rise because the school kids
[36:10.800 --> 36:16.480]  have just gone back to school they're testing them multiple times weekly despite the fact
[36:16.480 --> 36:21.600]  obviously they have no symptoms school kids in this country have got more risk of dying from
[36:21.600 --> 36:26.720]  being struck by lightning than covet they've got more chance of dying from falling over putting
[36:26.720 --> 36:32.880]  their pants on by covet but they're testing them multiple times a week anyway the university students
[36:33.520 --> 36:38.560]  are going back this week or next week they're going to be getting tested multiple times weekly
[36:38.560 --> 36:43.840]  then of course you have the winter flu season which happens every year alex as we saw last year
[36:43.840 --> 36:49.840]  the flu miraculously disappeared and they said oh we've we've combated the flu there are no more
[36:49.840 --> 36:54.240]  they literally said public health england there are no more flu infections in england
[36:54.240 --> 36:59.360]  we know why that is because they were counting them as covet cases to artificially inflate the
[36:59.360 --> 37:06.800]  numbers so we've been assured no masks no new lockdowns no vaccine passports unless the cases
[37:06.800 --> 37:11.520]  start to rise in winter and of course with the vaccines and with regular stuff coming through
[37:11.520 --> 37:15.760]  they always call a coma with the fake PCR test they said it's fake but they keep using so
[37:15.760 --> 37:20.480]  what is the point of this from my perspective they keep doing the same maneuver so that it kills
[37:20.480 --> 37:25.360]  opposition kills the giant crowds kills the public going out and educating and so people
[37:25.360 --> 37:32.640]  can't have a victory like they did in uh moscow and like they did in several other uh russian cities
[37:32.640 --> 37:38.000]  where like st petersburg where the mayors and people tried to make folks do this in the last year
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.680]  they just didn't get haircuts they didn't go out to eat they didn't do any that and after just a
[37:41.680 --> 37:45.920]  few months they had to come to their knees and reject it that's what i see this says is they
[37:45.920 --> 37:51.760]  don't want to give us a chance to have a victory so precisely and it's important to remain optimistic
[37:51.760 --> 37:56.800]  because i mean my gut tells me at least in this country because we still have some vestige of what
[37:56.800 --> 38:01.600]  liberty and what the relationship between the state and the people really means in terms of freedom
[38:01.600 --> 38:06.000]  i don't think they'll get it through you'll still have companies trying to enforce it but i don't
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.760]  think the government can get it through i don't i think they know they can't get it through so
[38:09.760 --> 38:14.720]  they're trying to put people back to sleep because this could represent a massive victory and then
[38:14.720 --> 38:20.640]  it could spread to other areas of this great reset covid control authoritarian agenda that we're
[38:20.640 --> 38:24.880]  seeing roll out across develop world across western countries absolutely they're threatening
[38:24.880 --> 38:29.680]  multiple years in prison if you're caught outside in south australia but here's video for TV viewers
[38:30.320 --> 38:33.520]  hundreds of thousands all over went to the beach and told the police burn in hell
[38:33.520 --> 38:41.120]  yeah and they did so despite being under the threat of as he said years in prison an 11,000
[38:41.120 --> 38:46.720]  dollar fines merely for posting anti-lockdown information on the internet but of course the
[38:46.720 --> 38:52.000]  overriding theme here is that the vaccines even by their own standards are completely useless alex
[38:52.000 --> 38:58.400]  we were told in the uk eight nine months ago we're going to vaccinate our way out of this right
[38:58.400 --> 39:03.840]  because the vaccines limit the severe symptoms and they reduce hospitalizations well what did we
[39:03.840 --> 39:09.520]  hear last week out of the government again in this country or if the hospitalizations keep
[39:09.520 --> 39:15.760]  climbing then in october we're going to have to impose a new lockdown once again oh well you you
[39:15.760 --> 39:20.240]  told us that the vaccine stopped the hospitalizations and yet now you're saying that there are going
[39:20.240 --> 39:28.640]  to be more hospitalizations in Gibraltar alex by june the first you had 99 percent of the entire
[39:28.640 --> 39:37.680]  population vaccinated weeks after that their covered infection rates climbed by 2,500 percent
[39:37.680 --> 39:44.160]  despite the fact that almost everyone in that territory was vaccinated you see the same thing
[39:44.160 --> 39:50.400]  in israel the earliest country developed country to roll out vaccines en masse and the vaccine
[39:50.400 --> 39:55.520]  passport they claimed a great success now as of a couple of weeks ago they've had their highest
[39:55.520 --> 40:02.640]  covid infection rate ever in israel despite the vast majority of the population being vaccinated
[40:02.640 --> 40:06.880]  but it's going to be a lockdown for the unvaccinated it's not going to be a lockdown
[40:06.880 --> 40:12.080]  for those who comply over and over again and let's explain the name in australia said once
[40:12.080 --> 40:16.400]  you've done that you're still only out allowed out a few hours a day and now in canada australia
[40:16.400 --> 40:21.760]  that europe they've all announced this is really about carbon and so is lord roth child so is prince
[40:21.760 --> 40:26.880]  charles they've all said oh these lockdowns are preparing you to non-essential travel with phone
[40:26.880 --> 40:31.520]  apps that control where you can go and what you can do is that not the holy grail here of control
[40:33.360 --> 40:38.560]  this what i've said all along alex is what you said the vaccine passport is the digital id the
[40:38.560 --> 40:44.320]  digital id is the social credit score the state of south australia as he mentioned is about to pass
[40:44.320 --> 40:50.400]  a new regulation whereby if you're supposed to be under self isolation quarantine the government
[40:50.400 --> 40:57.600]  phones you up and within 15 minutes if you don't respond with a selfie which is geolocation tagged
[40:57.600 --> 41:02.720]  they're going to send literal police agents of the state out to hunt you down if you don't
[41:02.720 --> 41:08.880]  self report your location to the government that's beyond all well that's beyond any dystopian thing
[41:08.880 --> 41:14.560]  that we could have imagined even a year ago but again it's about punishing the unvaccinated alex
[41:14.560 --> 41:20.880]  we have a situation here in britain with nightclubs okay originally they said all the nightclubs
[41:20.880 --> 41:26.880]  would have to introduce vaccine passports by the end of september problem being 25 percent of young
[41:26.880 --> 41:32.480]  people in britain haven't had one dose of the vaccine the profit margin net for nightclubs is 15%
[41:33.200 --> 41:38.160]  they're all going to go out of business so they're rebelling against it then the government came out
[41:38.160 --> 41:44.880]  and said you can't get into a nightclub even if you provide a negative covid test they're removing
[41:44.880 --> 41:50.720]  that option but you can get in if you've had the vaccine despite the fact that they tell us even if
[41:50.720 --> 41:55.600]  you've had the vaccine you can still get the virus and pass it on it's not about public health
[41:55.600 --> 42:00.240]  let me back you up because again the more we give in folks the more they tighten the news
[42:00.240 --> 42:04.080]  for our neck i know listeners of this show know that but your friends and family don't get educated
[42:04.080 --> 42:08.880]  here's an example c&m not getting vaccinated against covid 19 is like driving well intoxicated
[42:08.880 --> 42:13.520]  health experts say they say you can give somebody the virus but next they say study vaccinated people
[42:13.520 --> 42:19.200]  can carry as much virus as others actually they carry much more and are more infectious it's a leaky
[42:19.200 --> 42:27.680]  vaccine it doesn't work paul total proof there's their god ap total proof as well with the masks
[42:27.680 --> 42:32.800]  alex they're saying they're going to reintroduce then you know my parents live in spain they removed
[42:32.800 --> 42:39.200]  the rule that said you had to wear a mask outdoors in spain in like 38 degrees celsius temperatures
[42:39.200 --> 42:44.480]  at the height of summer everyone's still wearing them outside even though they're not even legally
[42:44.480 --> 42:48.080]  required to do that's what the globalist bet on stay there let's talk about how we get out of the
[42:48.080 --> 42:56.320]  screen ahead with paul joseph watson of summit dot news check it out with their effect on september
[42:56.320 --> 43:03.920]  ninth 2021 the puppet president joe biden publicly declared war against america he then
[43:03.920 --> 43:10.560]  announced dictatorial powers unto himself and announced forced inoculations against the american
[43:10.560 --> 43:16.160]  people he is a puppet of the united nations and the rockefeller combine of corporations
[43:16.160 --> 43:21.440]  that put him in power and he is making a very serious move against the american people but the
[43:21.440 --> 43:26.240]  attack he's launched is being launched against every other western country on the planet by these
[43:26.240 --> 43:31.200]  corporations that have already enslaved the third world what they're doing is illegal on its face
[43:31.760 --> 43:36.720]  violates our federal and state laws and the janiva convention as well as the nuremberg code
[43:36.720 --> 43:41.440]  it's very very simple we have to decide whether we're going to surrender to this globalist corporate
[43:41.440 --> 43:46.400]  takeover whether we're going to stand up with our birthright and say no and then prosecute these
[43:46.400 --> 43:50.960]  criminals for their crimes against humanity so other criminals in the future don't dare try it
[43:50.960 --> 43:59.520]  the choice is up to us in late august info or saw an explosion of orders because our audience
[43:59.520 --> 44:05.920]  understands that the globalists are destabilizing the planet by design and are attempting to cause
[44:05.920 --> 44:11.840]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide now ladies and gentlemen storeable food has always
[44:11.840 --> 44:16.000]  been something that's important to have it's a checkbox that everybody needs to have taken care
[44:16.000 --> 44:22.240]  of right along with water filtration self-defense and a relationship with god but now more than ever

[46:38.720 --> 46:42.800]  that's why the globalists are censoring they can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like
[46:42.800 --> 46:47.040]  us on the air so while you're at it don't just financially support us and spread the word

[46:51.040 --> 46:54.240]  to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said
[46:58.080 --> 47:02.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:02.960 --> 47:18.480]  well paul joseph watson of summit.news is popping in with us right now to talk about
[47:18.480 --> 47:23.680]  are they really getting rid of the vaccine passport in the uk or are they really just
[47:23.680 --> 47:26.880]  trying to kill opposition to bring it right back well it looks like they've already said since this
[47:26.880 --> 47:31.040]  weekend saying we're not going to do it this winter to saying oh we probably are paul joseph
[47:31.040 --> 47:35.200]  watson's here but i want to ask paul up front looking at the global id and where this medical
[47:35.200 --> 47:39.520]  id is going according to claus Schwab of the una's research what he makes of australia here's a
[47:39.520 --> 47:45.440]  federal senator on tv basically threatening people saying we're going to be on our front foot now
[47:45.440 --> 47:49.840]  you unvaccinated are making us sick even though they admit the vaccinated are just as likely or more
[47:50.480 --> 47:54.800]  to actually spread it and shed it i'll show people the associated press but i want your
[47:54.800 --> 48:00.080]  take on this paul here she is i think people are getting quite agitated right out there now
[48:00.080 --> 48:06.240]  outside pete and those anti-vaxxers out there that 20 30 percent are the ones out there protesting
[48:06.240 --> 48:09.440]  on the streets and doing that sort of thing i think you're going to find the rest of us coming at
[48:09.440 --> 48:13.520]  you lock stock and barrel and we're going to be putting the pressure on you fairly hard because
[48:13.520 --> 48:19.040]  the rest of us that are trying to do the right thing by the country and our kids and get vaccinated
[48:19.040 --> 48:24.640]  and do the right thing i think for you we're going to start to get even more agitated and we're
[48:24.640 --> 48:27.920]  going to start to get more hardcore and i think that's what you're going to see massive division
[48:27.920 --> 48:32.080]  out there it'll be us on the front foot that's what i think is going to happen i think the
[48:32.080 --> 48:36.000]  the tide is going to turn on those anti-vaxxers out there and you are really going to feel the
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.520]  heat no the tide has turned on you so feel the heat front foot lock stock and barrel means the
[48:41.520 --> 48:44.800]  same thing in texas it means there we're going to beat your ass like the police are already
[48:44.800 --> 48:49.440]  running folks over with cars but paul here it is study vaccinated people can carry as much
[48:49.440 --> 48:54.480]  virus as others maybe more paul what do you say about that and it's the same argument in the us
[48:54.480 --> 49:00.160]  in the uk and europe and australia it's just disgusting what's happening well in australia
[49:00.160 --> 49:05.440]  don't forget alex it was only a few months ago that they seriously floated the idea of fitting
[49:05.440 --> 49:11.440]  people self-isolating with electronic ankle bracelets like literal prisoners they call it
[49:11.440 --> 49:16.320]  prison island there isn't much resistance because people are literally being threatened with
[49:16.320 --> 49:20.800]  eleven thousand dollar fines and ten years in jail merely for posting things about anti-lockdown
[49:20.800 --> 49:26.640]  protests on facebook but there's also a kind of weird genuflecting and worshiping of the state
[49:26.640 --> 49:32.240]  that's been endemic within the australian character for decades and decades which is why it's different
[49:32.240 --> 49:36.880]  from britain because whenever they try to impose this authoritarianism in britain it's always
[49:36.880 --> 49:42.400]  completely messy and falls apart at the seams because we do have a vestige of the understanding
[49:42.400 --> 49:46.480]  of as i've said liberty and the relationship between the government and the people but in
[49:46.480 --> 49:51.040]  australia it's like oh the authorities said it it must be good and they're literally threatening
[49:51.040 --> 49:57.120]  to go door to door to do covid tests fit people with electronic ankle bracelets this government
[49:57.120 --> 50:02.560]  tracking app we talked about we have to report your location to the government within 15 minutes
[50:02.560 --> 50:09.120]  of them demanding it and yet meanwhile the prime minister of australia takes a private jet across
[50:09.120 --> 50:14.320]  the country from two states that are both supposedly under lockdown to visit his family on
[50:14.320 --> 50:20.800]  father's day and everyone else is held in these quarantine camps where if you remove your mask
[50:20.800 --> 50:26.880]  for 10 seconds to drink a cup of tea the police come and shout you down we even had an article
[50:26.880 --> 50:32.240]  last week alex where the government is going to these buildings that are owned by the local
[50:32.240 --> 50:39.040]  councils in australia intercepting the delivery packages from family members of alcohol because
[50:39.040 --> 50:44.320]  these of course as in every other country the lockdowns created a million new alcoholics because
[50:44.320 --> 50:50.480]  they really care about our health now they're not even allowed to pass the time by drinking booze
[50:50.480 --> 50:56.640]  so it's now all a giant exercise in nanny state power grab and what do you make of all these leak
[50:56.640 --> 51:01.200]  videos out of the u.s out of australia out of israel where they're admitting it's all just a
[51:01.200 --> 51:06.320]  power grab i mean this is i mean claus Schwab writes books and says this is about a great reset
[51:06.320 --> 51:11.280]  and in getting rid of capitalism and bringing in stakeholder you know bs globalism i mean
[51:11.280 --> 51:15.840]  that's what's crazy to me is so many liberals particularly love to jump through the hoops and
[51:15.840 --> 51:20.800]  social distance and scan this and scan that don't they get their chumps don't they get their targets
[51:22.560 --> 51:27.120]  well the elites all buy in private islands which they go to on private jets they're immune from
[51:27.120 --> 51:31.840]  all the restrictions because they've paid money to get on these special privileged blueless like
[51:31.840 --> 51:37.840]  larry page in fiji bill gates is the biggest owner of farmland in the u.s meanwhile you'll
[51:37.840 --> 51:42.720]  own nothing and you'll be happy according to claus anil Schwab who literally says in his own
[51:42.720 --> 51:47.840]  book as he said this the ultimate agenda is put microchip in your forehead that's not us saying
[51:47.840 --> 51:55.200]  that it's claus Schwab the great reset his book we have the story today alex the israeli health
[51:55.200 --> 52:01.280]  minister caught on a hot mic saying the vaccine passports have nothing to do with epidemiology
[52:01.280 --> 52:07.920]  there to do with punishing the unvaccinated and keeping the unvaccinated under indefinite lockdown
[52:07.920 --> 52:14.880]  forever it's about ring fencing the dissidents identifying them and punishing them meanwhile
[52:14.880 --> 52:21.920]  everyone else gets 10 booster shots and they continue to have their fun with that and meanwhile the bbc
[52:23.040 --> 52:30.000]  german newspapers us publications like bloomberg say get used to a permanent lockdown so so they've
[52:30.000 --> 52:38.880]  i mean fouchy and gates have said on tv so has um Schwab the cut is forever it never ends
[52:38.880 --> 52:44.320]  lockdown is forever we put bloomberg back up folks permanent pandemic permanent lockdown you'll never
[52:44.320 --> 52:49.920]  come out i mean there it is come on folks i mean paul this is ridiculous by the way you said last
[52:49.920 --> 52:54.080]  segment i really have to correct you because you're usually just as accurate as i am maybe even more
[52:55.520 --> 52:59.200]  you just said we couldn't even have imagined all this just a few years ago you mean the general
[52:59.200 --> 53:04.640]  public you wrote about lockstep 11 years ago we covered it you predicted last year the global
[53:04.640 --> 53:09.520]  i digs because they said it so let's explain how we knew all this because everybody keeps freaking
[53:09.520 --> 53:13.520]  out about my predictions i've told you you ought to toot your horn a little more and put up articles
[53:13.520 --> 53:19.520]  you wrote 15 years ago 20 years ago at prism planet dot com and info wars dot com and propaganda
[53:19.520 --> 53:25.120]  matrix dot com and now on your site uh summit dot news i mean explain to people because because i
[53:25.120 --> 53:28.160]  know you're not into toot your horn but people really pay attention to that paul and it wakes
[53:28.160 --> 53:35.200]  them up today when we warn them oh we have numerous articles numerous programs about bill gates about
[53:35.200 --> 53:39.280]  all these top public health officials in canada specifically i remember there was documentary
[53:39.280 --> 53:44.000]  where they literally said they'd round up the unvaccinated and put them in camps we had that
[53:44.000 --> 53:48.640]  video in numerous articles oh i forgot that one was like it's an asian woman like four years ago
[53:49.520 --> 53:55.840]  oh we gotta find that you gotta flash back to her sorry i did write an article about it but
[53:55.840 --> 54:02.160]  whether the the question is could we have ever imagined this even the people doing it at the
[54:02.160 --> 54:07.200]  start of the pandemic professor neil ferguson remember this guy who's spectacularly wrong
[54:07.200 --> 54:11.280]  proclamations about the number of people who would die in britain half a million led to the
[54:11.280 --> 54:16.080]  first lockdown even though borris johnson was originally going to go for herd immunity meanwhile
[54:16.080 --> 54:20.720]  he of course is traveling across london to shag his married mistress because he took lockdown so
[54:20.720 --> 54:27.040]  seriously himself he came out of the start of the pandemic and said we looked at what china was
[54:27.040 --> 54:31.280]  doing you know literally welding people inside their houses and stuff like that and he and he
[54:31.280 --> 54:37.920]  said we thought we could never get away with anything like that and yet we went ahead and we
[54:37.920 --> 54:42.880]  got away with it why did they get away with it because as you said right the start alex they
[54:42.880 --> 54:49.520]  had behavioral psychologists mind control teams affiliated to the government saying look we're
[54:49.520 --> 54:55.200]  not going to get any of this through unless we drastically exaggerate the risk posed by covid
[54:55.200 --> 54:59.040]  that's precisely what they did they had the propaganda of people in china falling over and
[54:59.040 --> 55:04.480]  convulsing on the streets which we fell for at the time everyone else did it was complete bs made
[55:04.480 --> 55:10.000]  up by these military affiliates by the way paul they actually say in the uk news we use army
[55:10.000 --> 55:15.840]  psychological warfare to quote brainwash the public they use the term brainwash use of fear to
[55:15.840 --> 55:23.200]  control behavior in covid crisis was totalitarian admit scientists that's all being laid out there
[55:23.200 --> 55:31.520]  in susan doddsworth book covid 19 the influenza group on behavior spib this is literally attached
[55:31.520 --> 55:36.480]  to a military unit in the uk called the 77th brigade whose propaganda is supposed to be aimed
[55:36.480 --> 55:41.600]  outwards at foreign adversaries the start of the pandemic they turned it inwards which is why you'll
[55:41.600 --> 55:47.600]  see on twitter people repeating word for word oh this is why we need another lockdown and phrases
[55:47.600 --> 55:54.080]  like that it's literally a military ops unit designed to terrify people to accept increasingly
[55:54.080 --> 56:01.440]  draconian measures when the real threat doesn't necessitate that 99.8 survival rate of covid summit
[56:01.440 --> 56:05.520]  dot news we got a minute left paul what else is on your radar how do we get out of this crisis
[56:05.520 --> 56:11.680]  we get out of it by not complying by continuing to engage in civil disobedience and if there are
[56:11.680 --> 56:17.520]  enough people who do that they're going to back off which is the point we can sit here all day and
[56:17.520 --> 56:21.760]  say oh they're going to do this anyway they're going to implement vaccine passports anyway they're
[56:21.760 --> 56:26.080]  just lying what can we do about it i think we can do a lot about it and i think we have backed
[56:26.080 --> 56:31.280]  them off to a certain extent my god tells me they're not going to get it through in the united
[56:31.280 --> 56:36.080]  kingdom because we have this spirit of resistance unfortunately they've already got it through
[56:36.080 --> 56:42.000]  places like france and israel but again the good news on that front a lot of the businesses on even
[56:42.000 --> 56:47.280]  enforcing it the ticket sales for all the events at the end of september are flatlined so these
[56:47.280 --> 56:53.680]  industries are going to go out of business they're fighting back so don't be nihilistic about it and
[56:53.680 --> 56:58.880]  have some optimism because we can push this back that's right paul all over the world from israel
[56:58.880 --> 57:03.600]  to france the uk people are pushing back and governments are having to back off even australia
[57:03.600 --> 57:08.480]  the tip of the tyranny spear says the tide will turn against you anti-vaxxers no it's not a vaccine
[57:08.480 --> 57:13.440]  it doesn't protect us it's about a global id for a global carbon tax and the more we submit the worst
[57:13.440 --> 57:16.720]  it gets we have to get these criminals out of government they're going to keep pulling this
[57:16.720 --> 57:22.000]  summit.news paul thank you so much thanks elix powerful interview we'll archive it at band

[59:57.760 --> 1:00:07.760]  you
[1:00:20.720 --> 1:00:23.840]  you know when i get up here and i tell you that we've woken up a lot of the top talk show
[1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:28.560]  hosts in the country you would see bill mar starting to find a soul it's been this broadcast
[1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:36.480]  with a lot of top names and that is not about me up here saying oh look we're really special
[1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:41.520]  we're powerful it's the opposite it's saying you're powerful you've had a great effect all of us
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:50.240]  together are doing a good work and things are not hopeless and i mean used to a lot of these
[1:00:50.240 --> 1:00:55.920]  really famous talk show hosts i know it's all the big names basically used to send me a text maybe
[1:00:55.920 --> 1:01:02.080]  once a month and now some of them text me 15 times 20 times a day and it's all about the new world
[1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:07.040]  order it's all about the injections it's all about because they're not they don't even need to listen
[1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:15.760]  to alex jones anymore they heard me say this stuff 25 years ago 20 years ago i mean people
[1:01:15.760 --> 1:01:23.120]  like joe rogan heard me say this stuff i guess it's not 25 years ago like 22 years ago when we
[1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:30.400]  hung out and had dinner 22 years ago i was friends with joe 20 years ago good friends and so
[1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:37.200]  just now joseph smart guy but he projects his own goodness he's a really nice guy behind the scenes
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:44.320]  onto people but now that he knows they're lying now he knows the social contract's broken notice
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:48.720]  what how bad he's hurting the globalist because he knows as much as i do he's really smart good at
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:55.120]  business everything he's not dumb we used to argue about 911 being an inside job and all the rest of
[1:01:55.120 --> 1:02:04.800]  it 20 years ago and so you see how awake he is when i told you six months ago i said you're about
[1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:10.160]  to see joe rogan get hardcore just as soon as he was making sure he couldn't get censored and now
[1:02:10.160 --> 1:02:16.880]  they want his ass off air and now that they mess with him even harder he's going to get even more
[1:02:16.880 --> 1:02:21.680]  aggressive what i went after him was because i knew he was smart i knew he was awake and he was
[1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:27.280]  taking the wrong direction and i did it over the top and it was wrong and i apologized to him i went
[1:02:27.280 --> 1:02:34.000]  too far but i was in i don't want to say a dark place um four years ago three years ago
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:43.120]  so i just get to where i don't care about the new world order what they do to me and so when you get
[1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:50.720]  to that point you just let it all hang out but i've controlled myself and dialed that back
[1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:55.440]  because the great power comes great responsibility yeah take howard stern he's what you don't want
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:03:01.360]  to be uses the first amendment to get rich and powerful now is anti-free speech forced in
[1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:06.720]  oculation and i got articles here from stern the headline you effing idiots were given the cure
[1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:15.760]  and you would not take it now you're dead f you and then attacks everybody it doesn't work stern
[1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:27.040]  got articles here workers to get microchipped to pay for food from the can team that's out of the
[1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:32.160]  uk and out of the us it's happening everywhere i got more judges busted
[1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:39.520]  engaged in pedophile activity and that's why the globalists are pissed because they're a pedophile
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:46.640]  click and there aren't a lot of those in local and state law enforcement there are now in the
[1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:52.000]  justice department and in the fbi at the top and so there's an internal war going on and that's why
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  why more than ever this broadcast is so important now listen i got ready and i'm not complaining
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:04.880]  i'm just saying i i do too much preparation most people don't do it with a lot of preparation
[1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:12.000]  like the narls barkley song it wasn't that i didn't know enough i knew too much i have done so much

[1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:18.880]  you
[1:06:24.080 --> 1:06:26.880]  last night
[1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:32.880]  she said
[1:06:32.880 --> 1:06:36.880]  i got a nice central
[1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:42.880]  rain hell from above because
[1:06:52.880 --> 1:06:54.320]  i'm here to tell you i'm a rebel
[1:06:56.560 --> 1:07:00.800]  all these conformists going along with the warmongers all these conformists going along
[1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:05.520]  with the tyranny all the conformists going along with these franken shots i'm really sad for it
[1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:09.120]  because you're going to be destroyed in the process you don't turn back soon
[1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:17.520]  all right let's get right into it right now and let me just i covered a lot of key global
[1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:22.320]  government world id takeover news last hour and i got more of that coming up and more of it at the
[1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:26.080]  bottom of the hour and we're going to hit it then and we know a lot now about this vivic
[1:07:26.080 --> 1:07:32.400]  murthy uh and who he works for wait till you learn about this coming up in fact i'll hit
[1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:42.960]  that next second segment but then coming up at the start of the next hour a bunch of videos
[1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:51.840]  in australia in europe in the uk in canada in the us of everywhere their leaders go
[1:07:51.840 --> 1:08:00.320]  go people are saying f u f the neural editor f bill gates f claus Schwab i mean giant crowds
[1:08:00.880 --> 1:08:05.600]  everywhere the the the the the puppet globalists are being chased and having rocks thrown at them
[1:08:05.600 --> 1:08:10.160]  and in madrid they're an area they're burning down part of the police stations and these aren't
[1:08:10.160 --> 1:08:14.080]  the type of folks that usually go out and burn down police stations these aren't the communists
[1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:17.360]  when the police come out and attack crowds trying to go to the beach they just go burn down the
[1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:22.240]  police station i'm not saying do that but if the police are acting like that here that's what's
[1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:28.720]  going to happen which is you know sad because you really need the police stations they're just
[1:08:28.720 --> 1:08:32.960]  following legal orders there would be real shame if people went to claus Schwab's house do not do
[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:36.240]  that either we don't want to turn him into a martyr in fact they'll probably do it to themselves
[1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:42.080]  i'm serious when i say that but if it goes through a full civil war well all's fair in
[1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:49.440]  love and war as they say so that's coming up but let me let me hit some of the other
[1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:56.400]  news that we've got here in our in our stacks that are so incredibly important
[1:08:57.520 --> 1:09:03.760]  you've got rose mcgowan and larry elder she's the lady that brought down harvey weinstein
[1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:12.000]  she had a press conference yesterday that actually got in the news that she was gonna
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:16.080]  have a press conference they were very smart they announced it in the morning knowing if you
[1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:19.680]  announced it a few days before the calls go out to all the media they waited till the weekend
[1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:23.600]  thinking well maybe the bosses aren't there the editors aren't there whoever's advising elder is
[1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:29.600]  extremely smart probably elder himself he's very smart and they waited till sunday morning they
[1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:39.280]  announced hey coming up today at six p.m pacific four p.m central five p.m eastern we are going
[1:09:39.280 --> 1:09:46.320]  to talk about how governor newson's wife called me and tried to pay me off to not expose weinstein
[1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:52.720]  of course you know that's true now he got out that they were gonna have the press conference but
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:59.840]  i checked everywhere if you saw it then then then you then you i mean i missed it nowhere was it
[1:09:59.840 --> 1:10:09.440]  carried nowhere could you find it except oan thank god for them it was nowhere and that shows you
[1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:19.920]  the incredible control that these people have over society and how the media is so incredibly lock
[1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:30.080]  step now speaking of that major supermarket chain warrants inflation is about to impact more americans
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:37.920]  four less foods kroger all say it's already up 10 percent and looks like it's going to go up
[1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:43.120]  15 percent and those are even skewed numbers by the federal government

[1:18:57.520 --> 1:19:02.160]  measure what's happening in the atmosphere but if you look at all the different studies reports
[1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:06.720]  about my nasa and other governments and other agencies they all disagree on what's really
[1:19:06.720 --> 1:19:14.160]  happened with the client the only concept the only great truth is change is the only constant so yes
[1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:19.280]  climate change is totally real but notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s
[1:19:19.280 --> 1:19:23.360]  80s and then it's gonna be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to
[1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:29.040]  okay now it's just climate change but did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing
[1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:34.240]  when it comes to the united nations and the department of energy and bill gates and the
[1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:40.480]  un they have weather control trees for 1979 bill gates has been manipulating the weather for a
[1:19:40.480 --> 1:19:45.840]  very long time in fact back in 1994 two scientists won a Nobel prize for an idea of spring different
[1:19:45.840 --> 1:19:50.320]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather so yes man-made climate change is real
[1:19:54.640 --> 1:19:57.280]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:19:57.280 --> 1:20:05.760]  so
[1:20:08.320 --> 1:20:13.760]  a monday worry of me means right today's time so you mean me
[1:20:13.760 --> 1:20:22.240]  so
[1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:39.600]  the globalists are tearing down western society because they're challenged by it they're bringing
[1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:45.120]  in a worldwide authoritarian system that takes away families that takes away women and men's
[1:20:45.120 --> 1:20:51.200]  spaces that turns us into cogs in a machine that's why at colleges across the u.s. they've taken down
[1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:56.960]  martin luther king bust the left says he didn't stand up for trans rights well that tabastock
[1:20:56.960 --> 1:21:02.480]  institute depopulation sterilization operation didn't exist when he was alive they took down the
[1:21:02.480 --> 1:21:07.200]  big beautiful statue in front of the metropolitan museum in new york i shot footage of it a few
[1:21:07.200 --> 1:21:13.440]  months ago i was there was taken down the next week and because he tried to empower black people
[1:21:13.440 --> 1:21:19.680]  and it showed an image of him with black folks rising up with him it was taken down and across
[1:21:19.680 --> 1:21:25.120]  the world they now apologize at colleges for having white students that's in the uk a particular
[1:21:25.120 --> 1:21:31.120]  article i'm talking about and now they burn books i'm going to get to that in a moment but first
[1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:44.880]  let's look at vivik murthy 1998 george soros fellow scholarship paul and daisy soros fellowship
[1:21:44.880 --> 1:21:52.480]  for new americans that's one of his sons Yale university medical doctor vivik is an immigrant
[1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:59.520]  from the united kingdom now we love indians that tend to be more conservative and anti-globalist but
[1:21:59.520 --> 1:22:05.440]  they hired this indian out of the uk brought him over here and now he tells us that national
[1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:10.480]  immunity is no good and that the vaccine is 100 and he is the biggest liar in the u.s government
[1:22:10.480 --> 1:22:17.280]  and that that says a lot but it's okay because he's got brown skin dr vivik h murthy is a 21st
[1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:22.320]  surgeon general united states he also serves the 19th sergeant general under president rock obama
[1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:28.640]  as the vice admiral of the u.s public health service commission corps and command of uniform
[1:22:28.640 --> 1:22:32.960]  service six thousand six hundred public health officers globally during his tenure dr murthy
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:40.560]  murthy launched the turn the tide campaign and they go on to brag how the soros has trained him
[1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:50.400]  prepared him and launched him and now he's gonna announce with biden tomorrow even more tyranny
[1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:57.600]  that it's okay he's wearing a Scientology admiral outfit and he's not white so we must
[1:22:57.600 --> 1:23:01.760]  do what he says so uh there you go ladies and gentlemen thank god he's on a white devil though
[1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:07.760]  oh speaking of white devils members of congress and their aides are exempt from biden's vax mandate
[1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:13.920]  but of course you're not but don't worry news outlooks retract story claiming ivermectin
[1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:19.840]  causes male infertility third time media has failed to accurately cover it that's right
[1:23:20.800 --> 1:23:25.840]  another media scare story about ivermectin has fallen apart making it the third time in a week
[1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:30.560]  the media has failed when it comes to a particular drug they've not failed they were lying on purpose
[1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:35.280]  this is not to say that anyone should be rushing to take the human version
[1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:40.480]  the latest comes from ktsm which here the nigerian study that's his biggest three-dollar bill claiming
[1:23:40.480 --> 1:23:44.080]  it makes your testicles basically fall off i want to look at all the other studies it's not true
[1:23:44.080 --> 1:23:48.480]  that medical doctor's on about it and but don't worry australia is citing the wave of fake news
[1:23:48.480 --> 1:23:52.720]  how poison controls calling in the hospitals are full of ivermectin victims and it makes your
[1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:59.920]  testicles fall off none of it's true a decision they'll regret australian regulator bans ivermectin
[1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:05.200]  use as coba 19 treatment that will kill a lot of people but that's all right it makes them feel good
[1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:14.480]  and fountsy doesn't go as far as the uh soros fellow uh the soros isn't just putting in our
[1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:20.160]  district attorneys and county attorneys and 20 plus attorney generals of state see now controls
[1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:25.520]  your doctors fountsy can't give a really firm answer on why americans with natural immunity need
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:30.480]  vaccines he just passed on this anew it'd be so embarrassing to say it doesn't exist
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:40.320]  here's another article out of bhf.org.uk coba 19 spike protein binds and changes cells in the heart
[1:24:40.320 --> 1:24:46.160]  will be covering that next segment why there's so many heart attacks taking place and being triggered
[1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:50.800]  by all of that and then i've got a bunch of tweets and a bunch of videos of doctors and
[1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:57.040]  scientists look at this stack oh my goodness this is a huge huge huge stack we're gonna be getting to
[1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:08.400]  coming up but first i wanted to just read this little tidbit this is from issa lee on twitter
[1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:19.280]  and they say i have a brother like both of my parents dad and phd in invertebrate zoology mom
[1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:28.960]  who's an md had a real scientific bent he went as a child but now in the late 60s he's touting
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:35.840]  every kakamemi conspiracy theory he can find about covid quoting alex jones and so on
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:42.560]  and i see so oh my gosh oh my gosh one parent's a phd in invertebrate zoology
[1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:50.240]  and the other is an md and and you know what they just are saying when alex jones says well you
[1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:55.520]  might want to listen to your parents but see the more highly educated you are the less you take
[1:25:55.520 --> 1:26:00.960]  this injection that's that's admitted the news but see the left is just how intelligent you are
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:07.840]  and how it totally protects you and how there's no side effects and you believe the lies you're told
[1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:13.120]  and you want to be a prisoner and you think by pretending to be with the power structure you
[1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:17.200]  get ahead that's not the case we now have world leaders admitting the lockdowns are about making
[1:26:17.200 --> 1:26:21.280]  you take the shot but we don't need them to tell us that we can tell you have the former head of
[1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:26.000]  plant parenthood now it's to abort you after you're born saying it's a privilege even leave
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  your house lady you want to live under tyranny go back to china that's all coming up next segment
[1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:40.880]  but first we have this week's new sales are here and i suggest you take advantage of it for your
[1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:46.000]  health and your life and your immune system and your body and everything we have winter sun the
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:53.920]  highest quality vitamin d3 taken under the tongue and when you take it out of the tongue you get a
[1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:57.600]  better absorption a lot of people can't absorb it in their gut especially we got brown skin or
[1:26:57.600 --> 1:27:01.520]  black skin unless you're getting 30 40 minutes of direct sun a day in the summer you're not
[1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:06.320]  getting enough vitamin d3 and that's directly linked to everybody that gets sick period uh out
[1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:10.320]  there with with any viral issue so we have it it's high quality wherever you get your vitamin d3
[1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:16.480]  i suggest you get organic it's not synthetic it's 50 off winter sun taken under the skin
[1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:22.240]  and also member six years ago this first came out that a buzzfeed article in a huffington post
[1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:28.800]  article why they tested our b12 at a california lab they have the highest standards and they found
[1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:34.560]  out they said okay it's clean it's it's it's it's vitamin b12 but it's overpriced and they said
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:40.640]  but here's the best b12 that was twice as much and they really put which was another brand
[1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:45.520]  that was being actually sold by that lab that i guess was tied to a company owned by uh mark cuban

[1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:29.280]  but it wasn't because i didn't know enough
[1:33:32.400 --> 1:33:34.160]  i just knew too much
[1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:43.440]  ladies and gentlemen we are back live heart inflammation in teens explodes across the
[1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:48.640]  u.s after fda approves injections there's an article out of the uk out of the sun side effect
[1:33:48.640 --> 1:33:54.320]  teenage boys are 14 times more likely to suffer heart complications from fizer jab study finds
[1:33:54.880 --> 1:33:58.160]  well ernaz ramirez who's on his job or go to him in a moment
[1:33:58.880 --> 1:34:03.200]  got censored by facebook and told and sent our article about him we have screenshots
[1:34:03.200 --> 1:34:07.040]  that he's been restricted he's been blocked from posting because he's not allowed to talk about his
[1:34:07.040 --> 1:34:12.320]  dead son sign up that facebook's involved the wuhan lab invested in the vaccines there it is father
[1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:16.960]  whose son died from vaccines induced heart inflammation censored by facebook so go to
[1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:22.720]  that site click through go to his twitter follow him work with him amplify what he's doing and other
[1:34:22.720 --> 1:34:26.240]  parents that have lost their children because they believe they were doing the right thing and
[1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:31.120]  trying to help themselves and help others here's another young man and they're trying to suppress
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:36.320]  this a well-known football player in other sports who took the shot and almost died as well here it is
[1:34:38.320 --> 1:34:43.840]  i am in the hospital right now with heart complications from the covet 19 vaccine
[1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:49.840]  and i want to inform as many people as i can about the risks from taking the vaccine that i
[1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:56.080]  wish someone would have told me so i am a division one student athlete with no prior health issues
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:35:03.440]  and i got the second covet shot tuesday and within four days i have been diagnosed with
[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:10.000]  my own carditis and was told that i probably won't be able to play my senior season now
[1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:20.080]  it is a side effect from the covet vaccine and it's really not being reported or addressed
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:26.240]  and it is a serious issue that we should all be informed about before making this decision it
[1:35:26.240 --> 1:35:32.240]  isn't right for people to be forced to take the vaccine because there are actual side effects
[1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:37.680]  like this that could happen to you and the NCAA should not mandate student athletes to get the
[1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:44.240]  vaccine because of what could happen to so many fellow student athletes on health issues which
[1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:50.720]  has happened to me everyone should be informed of the side effects and no one should be forced
[1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:56.880]  to take something that could cause what has happened to me and no one knows the long term
[1:35:56.880 --> 1:36:03.040]  effects of what's possibly going to happen from this and it's kind of uncharted territories
[1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:09.440]  because everyone else with the same heart issues from the vaccine is me we're all being tracked and
[1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:16.400]  monitored we're basically like test subjects from the vaccines and it's a very serious issue that
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:27.120]  really needs to be spread and i've spoken with some other student athletes that have also had
[1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:35.120]  to have either heart surgery or have had heart issues from this and it's it's very scary stuff
[1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:41.200]  and a lot of people in our age group apparently are at higher risk for heart issues from the
[1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:47.600]  vaccine and it really does need to be talked about
[1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:53.840]  all right we're going to earn us here in a moment after he leaves us we have a tribute
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:36:58.960]  to his son now that facebook will try to block as well remember they the head facebook fact checker
[1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:03.200]  is a head person number two person at the Wuhan lab this was all concerted you wouldn't
[1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:08.160]  want an attack like this unless you had control over those you're planning to kill with a depopulation
[1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:13.120]  weapon which bill gates home admit this is here is what got censored off of facebook
[1:37:14.640 --> 1:37:20.720]  right after mr ramirez who we're about to be talking to was on my show this is what they're
[1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:26.320]  suppressing him at the capital with his free speech in america here it is i love the hell out of my
[1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:35.360]  country but i don't trust my government anymore my son received the vaccine and he died a few days
[1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:43.120]  later the only explanation i was given to me was in large heart so if i have anything to say to
[1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:50.480]  anybody look down at your child is that worth the risk i mean you see your baby right now
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:57.600]  you might not see your baby tomorrow i have to live with that the rest of my life now here's
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:38:03.360]  the smoking gun and we'll go to mr ramirez in october list of adverse reactions before they even

[1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:18.640]  come up to me after seeing uh your show tell me um they decided not to do that because it's not worth
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:26.400]  the risk like i've always said it's not worth the risk uh i feel like uh we're playing pressure roulette
[1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:30.720]  they handed the government handed me the gun telling me it was safe and then told me to pull
[1:39:30.720 --> 1:39:38.240]  the trigger and after my son passes they throw their hands up like it's it's not our fault i mean
[1:39:38.240 --> 1:39:44.800]  why are you trying to shut me up you know if i'm trying to i'm telling truth i'm telling the story

[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:07.840]  real study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design the large central banks
[1:44:07.840 --> 1:44:14.000]  that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into say the
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:18.240]  anglo-american establishment the founder of the bill berg group the trilateral commission of the
[1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:24.160]  united nations the whole project of the roth shawls and the rockelfellows until 10 years ago the media

[1:47:14.240 --> 1:47:17.600]  now admitted how would you do it

[1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:34.000]  the regulators you'd have to control regulators around the world as bill gates does and now they've
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:41.360]  done it you'd have to have fake PCR tests you'd have to have it all so going back to our guest
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:48.400]  Ernest Ramirez Ernest what is it like for you losing Ernest jr who was healthy 16 year old
[1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:52.160]  there at the little basketball court where he just started as you said running and playing

[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:31.120]  say to the people that did this to you and and they were trying to silence you and obviously hurt
[1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:34.560]  so they don't learn what's happened to them and about all these deaths and heart attacks and
[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:38.560]  heart surgeries because this is your chance with probably two million people watching
[1:48:38.560 --> 1:48:41.920]  to address these uh globalists they're going to take what you say today they're going to share
[1:48:41.920 --> 1:48:46.480]  it online they're going to share the story you're signed so this is your chance to stand up on a
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:51.120]  major platform to mark zuckerberg and others and ask them what do they think they're doing
[1:48:52.640 --> 1:49:00.240]  I mean to me what is this uh being they're splitting our country up is what they're doing
[1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:06.480]  I mean why are you gonna try to shut me up when I'm telling my story I'm not making anything up
[1:49:07.040 --> 1:49:13.520]  this is what happened I mean there's no way they're gonna shut me up I want every parent

[1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:48.560]  I'll find a way if I gotta stand on the street corner to warn parents so they don't have to go
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:57.040]  through the same thing I'm going through I mean like I said this is certainly political and you know
[1:49:57.040 --> 1:50:02.080]  I'm like I said I'm just a little person I'm just one regular person and you just want me to shut
[1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:09.120]  my mouth and go on with life well there's no more life after this you know you you took my life so

[1:50:59.360 --> 1:51:03.840]  same way it reminds me of my son this I'll be honest with you mr Ramirez I'm not trying to get you
[1:51:03.840 --> 1:51:09.200]  to say mean stuff I'm pissed for you and I just want the globalist to know we're not gonna do anything
[1:51:09.200 --> 1:51:12.880]  at this point but we're gonna take our government back and we're gonna have Nuremberg too the people
[1:51:12.880 --> 1:51:18.480]  responsible for this I want to see go to present bare minimum yeah somebody has to pay for this
[1:51:18.480 --> 1:51:23.760]  because I mean I'm like I said I'm just one man I know there's hundreds of people out there that's
[1:51:23.760 --> 1:51:29.120]  going through the same thing I had a gentleman text me this morning he's seen my uh your show
[1:51:29.120 --> 1:51:35.680]  and he said the same thing happened to his nephew so I know there's hundreds more that with it's
[1:51:35.680 --> 1:51:40.960]  thousands sir it's it's it's hundreds of thousands we need this is all by design we this is eugenics
[1:51:40.960 --> 1:51:46.960]  this is Hitler folks 2.0 we need to have a national rally or an event somewhere or or me or rallies
[1:51:46.960 --> 1:51:50.480]  across the country for the victims to come out because again they're trying to suppress us we need
[1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:57.280]  to go to facebook headquarters or go to kawaii to to mark zuckerberg's frickin front gate and let
[1:51:57.280 --> 1:52:03.120]  that little monster know we're aware of what a damn killer he is he's involved with gates he's
[1:52:03.120 --> 1:52:09.360]  involved in all that he knows what he's doing yes sir I mean they're trying to cover each other's
[1:52:09.360 --> 1:52:14.640]  back that's why I see it everybody's trying to cover each other's back to continue what they're
[1:52:14.640 --> 1:52:21.600]  doing I mean somebody's making millions out of all our kids passing you know it's it's it's tens of
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:26.560]  billions and then they're also targeting the old it is not a vaccine they lied to you it's not your
[1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:30.800]  fault you went there believing your government believing the media because in the past they usually

[1:56:55.520 --> 1:56:58.520]  This is very powerful, hope radio listeners will
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:02.520]  Find this when it's archive today at freeworldnews.tv
[1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:05.520]  Loving memory
[1:57:05.520 --> 1:57:07.520]  I'm sorry
[1:57:10.520 --> 1:57:12.520]  Ernesto Ramirez Jr
[1:57:14.520 --> 1:57:16.520]  Another casualty, Bill Gates
[1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:19.520]  In this war against America and humanity
[1:57:22.520 --> 1:57:25.520]  Remember 11, 2004 was born
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:30.520]  April 24, 2021
[1:57:31.520 --> 1:57:33.520]  Guiled by the globalist
[1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:35.520]  Remember the hearts
[1:57:37.520 --> 1:57:41.520]  Biden and his corporate controllers are lying to you
[1:57:41.520 --> 1:57:45.520]  This is not a pandemic of the unvaccinated
[1:57:45.520 --> 1:57:48.520]  This is an engineered virus in a lab
[1:57:48.520 --> 1:57:51.520]  That they then injected into the public
[1:57:51.520 --> 1:57:53.520]  Using their poison vaccine
[1:57:53.520 --> 1:57:55.520]  So the body then created mutations
[1:57:55.520 --> 1:57:57.520]  That actually spread even worse
[1:57:57.520 --> 1:57:59.520]  Like the Delta variant
[1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:01.520]  That is scientifically admitted
[1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:04.520]  That is mainline science and not even debated
[1:58:04.520 --> 1:58:08.520]  But the general public does not even know that
[1:58:08.520 --> 1:58:12.520]  So when that criminal with his pedophile crackhead son
[1:58:12.520 --> 1:58:14.520]  Gets up there on television
[1:58:14.520 --> 1:58:17.520]  And tells you that you are to blame
[1:58:17.520 --> 1:58:19.520]  Because you didn't take your poison shot
[1:58:19.520 --> 1:58:21.520]  That is a giant lie
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:24.520]  Countries like Israel and Singapore
[1:58:24.520 --> 1:58:26.520]  With the highest vaccine rate
[1:58:26.520 --> 1:58:29.520]  Have the highest death and highest illness rates
[1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:31.520]  That is the facts
[1:58:31.520 --> 1:58:33.520]  Get that information up to your friends, family
[1:58:33.520 --> 1:58:35.520]  And strangers like your life depends on it
[1:58:35.520 --> 1:58:37.520]  Because it does
[1:58:38.520 --> 1:58:40.520]  It's only been in the last 60 years
[1:58:40.520 --> 1:58:43.520]  That we've had satellites that can decently
[1:58:43.520 --> 1:58:45.520]  Measure what's happening in the atmosphere
[1:58:45.520 --> 1:58:47.520]  But if you look at all the different studies
[1:58:47.520 --> 1:58:49.520]  That were reports about my NASA
[1:58:49.520 --> 1:58:51.520]  And other governments and other agencies
[1:58:51.520 --> 1:58:53.520]  They all disagree on what's really happening with the climate
[1:58:53.520 --> 1:58:56.520]  The only constant, the only great truth is
[1:58:56.520 --> 1:58:59.520]  Change is the only constant
[1:58:59.520 --> 1:59:02.520]  So yes, climate change is totally real
[1:59:02.520 --> 1:59:04.520]  But notice, first they called it global freezing
[1:59:04.520 --> 1:59:05.520]  Back in the 70s and 80s
[1:59:05.520 --> 1:59:07.520]  And then it's going to be global warming
[1:59:07.520 --> 1:59:09.520]  And when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to
[1:59:09.520 --> 1:59:11.520]  Okay, now it's just climate change
[1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:13.520]  But did you know that man-made climate change
[1:59:13.520 --> 1:59:15.520]  Is a real thing
[1:59:15.520 --> 1:59:17.520]  When it comes to the United Nations
[1:59:17.520 --> 1:59:19.520]  And the Department of Energy
[1:59:19.520 --> 1:59:21.520]  And Bill Gates and the UN
[1:59:21.520 --> 1:59:23.520]  They have weather control treaties from 1979
[1:59:23.520 --> 1:59:26.520]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather
[1:59:26.520 --> 1:59:27.520]  For a very long time
[1:59:27.520 --> 1:59:29.520]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists
[1:59:29.520 --> 1:59:31.520]  Won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spring
[1:59:31.520 --> 1:59:33.520]  Different particles out of jet engines
[1:59:33.520 --> 1:59:34.520]  To control the weather
[1:59:34.520 --> 2:00:00.520]  So yes, man-made climate change is real
[2:00:00.520 --> 2:00:01.520]  Coming up, ladies and gentlemen
[2:00:01.520 --> 2:00:03.520]  The next segment
[2:00:03.520 --> 2:00:05.520]  I'm going to get into the book burning
[2:00:05.520 --> 2:00:06.520]  I'm going to get into the censorship
[2:00:06.520 --> 2:00:09.520]  I'm going to get into the total control that's expanding
[2:00:09.520 --> 2:00:10.520]  The level's never before seen
[2:00:10.520 --> 2:00:11.520]  I've got articles here
[2:00:11.520 --> 2:00:14.520]  Where Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram
[2:00:14.520 --> 2:00:16.520]  All of them are blocking videos
[2:00:16.520 --> 2:00:17.520]  In fact, I meant to tell you this
[2:00:17.520 --> 2:00:18.520]  Get that two-minute compilation
[2:00:18.520 --> 2:00:20.520]  We didn't play Saturday
[2:00:20.520 --> 2:00:23.520]  Of Kamala Harris and Biden
[2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:25.520]  Saying, don't take the vaccine
[2:00:25.520 --> 2:00:26.520]  Don't trust the vaccine
[2:00:26.520 --> 2:00:27.520]  Till it's totally tested
[2:00:27.520 --> 2:00:29.520]  Which they're now not done
[2:00:29.520 --> 2:00:31.520]  If you try to play that
[2:00:31.520 --> 2:00:33.520]  The internet lords are taking it down
[2:00:33.520 --> 2:00:35.520]  And I've got another article here
[2:00:35.520 --> 2:00:36.520]  But I had my stack
[2:00:36.520 --> 2:00:37.520]  I'll find it in a minute
[2:00:37.520 --> 2:00:38.520]  Here it is
[2:00:38.520 --> 2:00:39.520]  Platform censor post
[2:00:39.520 --> 2:00:41.520]  Saying Biden could introduce
[2:00:41.520 --> 2:00:42.520]  Federal vaccine mandates
[2:00:42.520 --> 2:00:45.520]  As CDC's own fact checks denies it
[2:00:45.520 --> 2:00:47.520]  So they're saying this is not a mandate
[2:00:47.520 --> 2:00:48.520]  We're not making you
[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:49.520]  Even though we're making you
[2:00:49.520 --> 2:00:50.520]  I mean, it's reached
[2:00:50.520 --> 2:00:53.520]  Orwellian beyond Orwellian proportions
[2:00:53.520 --> 2:00:56.520]  But first, speaking of Canada
[2:00:56.520 --> 2:00:58.520]  Getting on the Global Social Credit
[2:00:58.520 --> 2:01:01.520]  Score with Congress, China announcing it officially
[2:01:01.520 --> 2:01:03.520]  Gregory Sunday knocked it out of the park
[2:01:03.520 --> 2:01:05.520]  Yet again, that guy's working seven days a week
[2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:06.520]  And put out this very special report
[2:01:06.520 --> 2:01:08.520]  That's in the Gregory section of
[2:01:08.520 --> 2:01:09.520]  Band.videos
[2:01:09.520 --> 2:01:10.520]  Click the left-hand side
[2:01:10.520 --> 2:01:11.520]  Find the Gregory section
[2:01:11.520 --> 2:01:13.520]  Reachreport.com will take you there
[2:01:13.520 --> 2:01:14.520]  And here is this report
[2:01:14.520 --> 2:01:16.520]  And we'll be right back
[2:01:23.520 --> 2:01:26.520]  China seems to be preparing for war
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:28.520]  And several western nations
[2:01:28.520 --> 2:01:30.520]  Are allying with them
[2:01:30.520 --> 2:01:31.520]  Including Canada
[2:01:31.520 --> 2:01:33.520]  Who is now officially rolling out
[2:01:33.520 --> 2:01:35.520]  The Chinese Social Credit Score
[2:01:35.520 --> 2:01:38.520]  For Canadian businesses
[2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:40.520]  China has recently banned
[2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:42.520]  English exams
[2:01:42.520 --> 2:01:44.520]  Limited video game use
[2:01:44.520 --> 2:01:48.520]  And erased several pop stars from history
[2:01:48.520 --> 2:01:51.520]  In an attempt to filter out western culture
[2:01:51.520 --> 2:01:54.520]  China is cracking down on effeminate men
[2:01:54.520 --> 2:01:57.520]  While assembling thousands of ships
[2:01:57.520 --> 2:01:59.520]  And millions of troops
[2:01:59.520 --> 2:02:01.520]  For war with Taiwan
[2:02:01.520 --> 2:02:04.520]  Just last year, half of the CCP's
[2:02:04.520 --> 2:02:07.520]  Nuclear scientists mysteriously quit
[2:02:07.520 --> 2:02:10.520]  On the same day for personal reasons
[2:02:10.520 --> 2:02:13.520]  And last month, the main news outlet
[2:02:13.520 --> 2:02:16.520]  For the CCP published an article
[2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:20.520]  Blaming the US for biological warfare
[2:02:20.520 --> 2:02:23.520]  Blaming capitalism for social degeneracy
[2:02:23.520 --> 2:02:27.520]  And calling for a new communist revolution
[2:02:27.520 --> 2:02:30.520]  The CCP is preparing for war
[2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:33.520]  And several world leaders are working with them
[2:02:33.520 --> 2:02:35.520]  Perhaps this is what the dozens
[2:02:35.520 --> 2:02:38.520]  Of ghost cities in China are for
[2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:40.520]  All now empty
[2:02:40.520 --> 2:02:43.520]  Ready to house hundreds of thousands of people
[2:02:43.520 --> 2:02:47.520]  Including a city that looks like France
[2:02:47.520 --> 2:02:50.520]  Is this for Macron and his fellow traders
[2:02:50.520 --> 2:02:52.520]  To someday feel at home?
[2:02:52.520 --> 2:02:55.520]  Maybe, but Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
[2:02:55.520 --> 2:02:58.520]  Is all in with the communist Chinese
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:00.520]  And his government has announced
[2:03:00.520 --> 2:03:02.520]  On a government website
[2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:05.520]  The Chinese social credit score system
[2:03:05.520 --> 2:03:08.520]  How businesses can prepare
[2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:10.520]  It outlines the penalties that Canadians
[2:03:10.520 --> 2:03:12.520]  Have to look forward to
[2:03:12.520 --> 2:03:15.520]  Which include public blaming and shaming
[2:03:15.520 --> 2:03:18.520]  And being blacklisted
[2:03:18.520 --> 2:03:21.520]  The CCP is coming to Canada
[2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:23.520]  With Trudeau, Canada has become
[2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:26.520]  The most willing subject of the CCP
[2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:28.520]  With Australia in second place
[2:03:28.520 --> 2:03:32.520]  And the rest of the western world fighting for third
[2:03:32.520 --> 2:03:36.520]  Who will be left to stand up for freedom?
[2:03:36.520 --> 2:03:39.520]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees
[2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:45.520]  And by the way, China says we're not doing
[2:03:45.520 --> 2:03:46.520]  Any carbon taxes
[2:03:46.520 --> 2:03:48.520]  We're building three carbon plants a week
[2:03:48.520 --> 2:03:51.520]  We're going to put homosexuals in prison
[2:03:51.520 --> 2:03:54.520]  We're going to take girly men off TV
[2:03:54.520 --> 2:03:56.520]  All that, but then they own Hollywood
[2:03:56.520 --> 2:03:58.520]  I mean, they bought it up
[2:03:58.520 --> 2:04:01.520]  And they are running all the poison
[2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:03.520]  That's like right out of the things of a cobra
[2:04:03.520 --> 2:04:06.520]  Or a rattlesnake into our veins
[2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:08.520]  And they are the model
[2:04:08.520 --> 2:04:10.520]  And so the rest of the world is getting in line
[2:04:10.520 --> 2:04:12.520]  To merge with that
[2:04:12.520 --> 2:04:14.520]  There are fissures between the power structures
[2:04:14.520 --> 2:04:16.520]  And you know, Soros on the surface
[2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:18.520]  Against Xi Jinping
[2:04:18.520 --> 2:04:20.520]  But it's just evil competing over the same operations
[2:04:20.520 --> 2:04:22.520]  They all want the same goals
[2:04:22.520 --> 2:04:25.520]  They're just demons competing for Lucifer's attention
[2:04:25.520 --> 2:04:28.520]  To be the ten kings of the earth, the three super regions
[2:04:28.520 --> 2:04:31.520]  Courtauld in Revelation 2,000 years ago
[2:04:31.520 --> 2:04:33.520]  Now officially announced by the UN
[2:04:33.520 --> 2:04:36.520]  That's right, ten kingdoms, three super regions
[2:04:36.520 --> 2:04:38.520]  That was publicly announced in 1992
[2:04:38.520 --> 2:04:40.520]  At Rio de Janeiro in Agenda 21
[2:04:40.520 --> 2:04:42.520]  They are following the biblical script

[2:06:13.520 --> 2:06:14.520]  No, it's true
[2:06:14.520 --> 2:06:15.520]  They know it's true
[2:06:15.520 --> 2:06:18.520]  That's why they want to silence this and can't warn people
[2:06:18.520 --> 2:06:20.520]  They're lighting a fire under a lot of people's ass
[2:06:20.520 --> 2:06:22.520]  By killing their children
[2:06:22.520 --> 2:06:24.520]  So the fight is on
[2:06:24.520 --> 2:06:28.520]  Look at that funeral of Ernesto Ramirez Jr
[2:06:28.520 --> 2:06:31.520]  And that looked like a couple thousand pissed off people
[2:06:31.520 --> 2:06:33.520]  Showed up there
[2:06:33.520 --> 2:06:35.520]  And they look like most of them were veterans
[2:06:35.520 --> 2:06:37.520]  And pretty serious folks
[2:06:37.520 --> 2:06:40.520]  So the war has been going for a while
[2:06:40.520 --> 2:06:43.520]  People are just now figuring out what's going on
[2:06:43.520 --> 2:06:45.520]  And I believe this is going to be a unifying effect
[2:06:45.520 --> 2:06:47.520]  In the end, evil always makes us move
[2:06:47.520 --> 2:06:50.520]  But it drives the people together
[2:06:50.520 --> 2:06:52.520]  About what color you are, what color your blood is
[2:06:52.520 --> 2:06:54.520]  And whether you're pointed at God or the devil
[2:06:54.520 --> 2:07:00.520]  Who are you aligned with?
[2:07:00.520 --> 2:07:02.520]  I don't like to show things
[2:07:02.520 --> 2:07:04.520]  Like when I'm attending a show coming up
[2:07:04.520 --> 2:07:06.520]  At the bottom of the hour
[2:07:06.520 --> 2:07:08.520]  But I really, at my spirit level
[2:07:08.520 --> 2:07:09.520]  I think I need to show this and I will
[2:07:09.520 --> 2:07:11.520]  And if a controversy comes out of it
[2:07:11.520 --> 2:07:14.520]  That's even better
[2:07:14.520 --> 2:07:16.520]  I always go with my gut
[2:07:16.520 --> 2:07:18.520]  And then I later can see, you know
[2:07:18.520 --> 2:07:21.520]  The spiritual level and the subconscious level
[2:07:21.520 --> 2:07:24.520]  How I came up with a plan
[2:07:24.520 --> 2:07:30.520]  But I don't want to look at the things they're doing
[2:07:30.520 --> 2:07:32.520]  I got sent this probably a dozen times this weekend
[2:07:32.520 --> 2:07:33.520]  By different prominent people saying,
[2:07:33.520 --> 2:07:35.520]  Have you seen this?
[2:07:35.520 --> 2:07:37.520]  And I couldn't even make myself go in the search engine
[2:07:37.520 --> 2:07:40.520]  And look it up
[2:07:40.520 --> 2:07:42.520]  And I finally did yesterday evening
[2:07:42.520 --> 2:07:46.520]  After my wife and youngest and oldest daughter
[2:07:46.520 --> 2:07:48.520]  Went to bed, the middle daughter
[2:07:48.520 --> 2:07:51.520]  Staying with her mom right now
[2:07:51.520 --> 2:07:55.520]  And Rex has moved out
[2:07:55.520 --> 2:07:58.520]  And I went and I read the book
[2:07:58.520 --> 2:08:02.520]  And I really felt depressed after I looked
[2:08:02.520 --> 2:08:05.520]  I never felt down
[2:08:05.520 --> 2:08:07.520]  Because I don't do stuff that makes me feel bad
[2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:08.520]  I have a conscience
[2:08:08.520 --> 2:08:09.520]  And the more I do good
[2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:10.520]  The better I feel about myself
[2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:11.520]  The stronger I get
[2:08:11.520 --> 2:08:13.520]  It made me feel weak
[2:08:13.520 --> 2:08:16.520]  But before I covered it
[2:08:16.520 --> 2:08:18.520]  I made myself go look at it
[2:08:18.520 --> 2:08:19.520]  I know why radio stations don't want to hear this
[2:08:19.520 --> 2:08:21.520]  Why TV stations don't want to see it
[2:08:21.520 --> 2:08:24.520]  But this is happening to the children
[2:08:24.520 --> 2:08:26.520]  And that's why evil puts out some terrible stuff
[2:08:26.520 --> 2:08:29.520]  No one will just go, oh, and run away from it
[2:08:29.520 --> 2:08:30.520]  And then they take over the schools
[2:08:30.520 --> 2:08:32.520]  They take over the Catholic church
[2:08:32.520 --> 2:08:34.520]  They take over the Baptist churches
[2:08:34.520 --> 2:08:35.520]  They take over the Boy Scouts
[2:08:35.520 --> 2:08:38.520]  In fact, print me that
[2:08:38.520 --> 2:08:39.520]  I was already aware of this book
[2:08:39.520 --> 2:08:40.520]  That I didn't cover it months ago
[2:08:40.520 --> 2:08:41.520]  When it first broke
[2:08:41.520 --> 2:08:42.520]  Now it's all over the country in schools
[2:08:42.520 --> 2:08:45.520]  You print me the Boy Scouts
[2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:48.520]  Signed Giant Settlement
[2:08:48.520 --> 2:08:49.520]  Record Settlement
[2:08:49.520 --> 2:08:51.520]  And I just remembered like eight years ago
[2:08:51.520 --> 2:08:54.520]  Boy Scout Jubilee
[2:08:54.520 --> 2:08:56.520]  You know, top, nearly meaning
[2:08:56.520 --> 2:08:59.520]  Hands out condoms to six-year-olds
[2:08:59.520 --> 2:09:01.520]  And print me that article too
[2:09:01.520 --> 2:09:02.520]  Condoms handed out
[2:09:02.520 --> 2:09:04.520]  And they knew when they sent
[2:09:04.520 --> 2:09:06.520]  A squad of pedophiles in there
[2:09:06.520 --> 2:09:09.520]  To have sex with children
[2:09:09.520 --> 2:09:11.520]  That it would take over the Boy Scouts
[2:09:11.520 --> 2:09:13.520]  And ruin it like every other institution
[2:09:13.520 --> 2:09:15.520]  They didn't want boys to learn how to camp
[2:09:15.520 --> 2:09:17.520]  And hunt and sharpen knives
[2:09:17.520 --> 2:09:19.520]  And all that they want
[2:09:19.520 --> 2:09:20.520]  And then none of them got in trouble
[2:09:20.520 --> 2:09:22.520]  And then the kids that got raped
[2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:25.520]  Got a bunch of money
[2:09:25.520 --> 2:09:26.520]  To plan
[2:09:26.520 --> 2:09:27.520]  And the very lawyers orchestrating it all
[2:09:27.520 --> 2:09:28.520]  Get the cash
[2:09:28.520 --> 2:09:30.520]  So I'm going to cover that bottom of the arrow
[2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:32.520]  Not a bunch of news first
[2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:34.520]  But they are teaching sixth, seventh
[2:09:34.520 --> 2:09:35.520]  And eighth graders
[2:09:35.520 --> 2:09:36.520]  And I've got city council meetings
[2:09:36.520 --> 2:09:37.520]  Talking about it
[2:09:37.520 --> 2:09:39.520]  Where they hold the book up
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:41.520]  Where these books
[2:09:41.520 --> 2:09:43.520]  There's a bunch of these books
[2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:46.520]  Child pornography legal
[2:09:46.520 --> 2:09:48.520]  But if you make child
[2:09:48.520 --> 2:09:51.520]  But if you make books about
[2:09:51.520 --> 2:09:53.520]  Children's experiences being raped
[2:09:53.520 --> 2:09:54.520]  And saying they like it
[2:09:54.520 --> 2:09:56.520]  Well, it's only a cartoon
[2:09:56.520 --> 2:09:58.520]  So it starts out in one book with
[2:09:58.520 --> 2:10:00.520]  You know, the 10 year olds have sex
[2:10:00.520 --> 2:10:02.520]  And then it's next, oh, you know
[2:10:02.520 --> 2:10:04.520]  The neighbor is 18
[2:10:04.520 --> 2:10:05.520]  Has sex with them in a barn
[2:10:05.520 --> 2:10:07.520]  And then next it's a 30 year old
[2:10:07.520 --> 2:10:08.520]  And how great it is
[2:10:08.520 --> 2:10:09.520]  This is in the school
[2:10:09.520 --> 2:10:11.520]  It's not just this book but others
[2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:17.520]  And let me tell you
[2:10:17.520 --> 2:10:19.520]  I never online tried to see a horse
[2:10:19.520 --> 2:10:20.520]  Having sex with a woman
[2:10:20.520 --> 2:10:21.520]  I've seen it for about a half a second
[2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:22.520]  And blocked my eyes
[2:10:22.520 --> 2:10:23.520]  Back in college we were like
[2:10:23.520 --> 2:10:24.520]  Look at this
[2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:26.520]  You know, right when the internet got big
[2:10:26.520 --> 2:10:29.520]  Or, you know, two girls in a cup
[2:10:29.520 --> 2:10:31.520]  Which had like hundreds of millions of views
[2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:33.520]  And it's like people click on a video
[2:10:33.520 --> 2:10:36.520]  And it's women eating feces
[2:10:36.520 --> 2:10:38.520]  I mean, I never, I wish I never
[2:10:38.520 --> 2:10:42.520]  Would have saw that
[2:10:42.520 --> 2:10:43.520]  But you're at the radio station
[2:10:43.520 --> 2:10:44.520]  And you're like, look at this
[2:10:44.520 --> 2:10:45.520]  It's like, what the hell
[2:10:45.520 --> 2:10:46.520]  I always saw like one second of it
[2:10:46.520 --> 2:10:47.520]  And I still remember it
[2:10:47.520 --> 2:10:52.520]  This is public schools
[2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:54.520]  With cartoons of adults
[2:10:54.520 --> 2:10:58.520]  Raping children
[2:10:58.520 --> 2:11:00.520]  And the book series and other books
[2:11:00.520 --> 2:11:01.520]  It's a couple of books doing this
[2:11:01.520 --> 2:11:04.520]  Not just Lawn Boy
[2:11:04.520 --> 2:11:08.520]  Is literally of the most horrible stuff
[2:11:08.520 --> 2:11:09.520]  You can imagine
[2:11:09.520 --> 2:11:10.520]  And they want to wreck psychology
[2:11:10.520 --> 2:11:12.520]  They want to wreck the young children
[2:11:12.520 --> 2:11:14.520]  Also print me the article
[2:11:14.520 --> 2:11:16.520]  Articles, DW.com and others
[2:11:16.520 --> 2:11:17.520]  And then, oh, they're reported on a year later
[2:11:17.520 --> 2:11:18.520]  After others did
[2:11:18.520 --> 2:11:20.520]  After we were reported on years ago
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:22.520]  Psychologists sending children
[2:11:22.520 --> 2:11:24.520]  Two convicted pedophiles
[2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:25.520]  By the tens of thousands
[2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:26.520]  On purpose to be raped
[2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:27.520]  As young as age three
[2:11:27.520 --> 2:11:28.520]  I always love the left
[2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:29.520]  On Twitter and Facebook
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:31.520]  Oh, I bet Jones, look this judge
[2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:32.520]  Got busted with young boys
[2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:34.520]  I bet Jones a little crazy
[2:11:34.520 --> 2:11:35.520]  With all his crap
[2:11:35.520 --> 2:11:36.520]  All my crap
[2:11:36.520 --> 2:11:39.520]  It is industrial level
[2:11:39.520 --> 2:11:41.520]  The pedophiles have taken over
[2:11:41.520 --> 2:11:43.520]  And when you see the judges
[2:11:43.520 --> 2:11:44.520]  Coming after patriots
[2:11:44.520 --> 2:11:46.520]  And you see them persecuting people in DC
[2:11:46.520 --> 2:11:47.520]  I'm here to tell you
[2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:49.520]  They're either narcotics traffickers
[2:11:49.520 --> 2:11:50.520]  Or they're screwing little kids
[2:11:50.520 --> 2:11:51.520]  Or they're doing something
[2:11:51.520 --> 2:11:53.520]  Like this sub
[2:11:53.520 --> 2:11:55.520]  Surgeon general on TV saying
[2:11:55.520 --> 2:11:57.520]  Natural immunity is no good
[2:11:57.520 --> 2:11:58.520]  And that's a total lie
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:00.520]  And he was brought to this country
[2:12:00.520 --> 2:12:02.520]  By the Soros and put through college
[2:12:02.520 --> 2:12:03.520]  They own that guy
[2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:05.520]  I don't know what it is they got on him
[2:12:05.520 --> 2:12:08.520]  But he sure looks like a demonic
[2:12:08.520 --> 2:12:10.520]  Snapping turtle to me
[2:12:10.520 --> 2:12:11.520]  But then when he does this evil
[2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:12.520]  What he does is bad
[2:12:12.520 --> 2:12:13.520]  I'm going to go to break
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:14.520]  And hit the book burning
[2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:15.520]  And some good news
[2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:17.520]  Where the globalists are being hounded
[2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:18.520]  Around the world
[2:12:18.520 --> 2:12:19.520]  But there it is
[2:12:19.520 --> 2:12:21.520]  An experiment
[2:12:21.520 --> 2:12:23.520]  That plays foster children with pedophiles
[2:12:23.520 --> 2:12:25.520]  That's the New Yorker
[2:12:25.520 --> 2:12:27.520]  Oh, and now they tell you about it
[2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:29.520]  30 plus thousand children
[2:12:29.520 --> 2:12:31.520]  From the 60s on on purpose
[2:12:31.520 --> 2:12:32.520]  On purpose
[2:12:32.520 --> 2:12:34.520]  And it's still going on
[2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:37.520]  That's who they are
[2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:40.520]  Penn State
[2:12:40.520 --> 2:12:41.520]  Sandusky
[2:12:41.520 --> 2:12:44.520]  With all those little dozens of cottages
[2:12:44.520 --> 2:12:46.520]  Where famous people would come stay
[2:12:46.520 --> 2:12:47.520]  For the night
[2:12:47.520 --> 2:12:51.520]  With children that had already been raped
[2:12:51.520 --> 2:12:53.520]  8, 9, 10 years old
[2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:54.520]  Who had been raped by their parents
[2:12:54.520 --> 2:12:56.520]  So no doctor's going to know
[2:12:56.520 --> 2:13:00.520]  Because they've already been brutalized
[2:13:00.520 --> 2:13:01.520]  And then little boys
[2:13:01.520 --> 2:13:03.520]  And little girls getting screwed
[2:13:03.520 --> 2:13:06.520]  Getting raped
[2:13:06.520 --> 2:13:08.520]  And then who ran the white wash
[2:13:08.520 --> 2:13:10.520]  Of that, the former FBI director
[2:13:10.520 --> 2:13:13.520]  I mean, man, you talk about God
[2:13:13.520 --> 2:13:14.520]  Going to destroy you
[2:13:14.520 --> 2:13:17.520]  Can you imagine being these people?
[2:13:17.520 --> 2:13:18.520]  And I told you
[2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:21.520]  My uncle worked in Guatemala
[2:13:21.520 --> 2:13:22.520]  In the 80s
[2:13:22.520 --> 2:13:23.520]  And was connected to Iran Contra
[2:13:23.520 --> 2:13:25.520]  He never told me anything about it
[2:13:25.520 --> 2:13:27.520]  He just said, the government's evil
[2:13:27.520 --> 2:13:28.520]  It's bad
[2:13:28.520 --> 2:13:29.520]  And before he died
[2:13:29.520 --> 2:13:30.520]  A year before he got sick
[2:13:30.520 --> 2:13:31.520]  With pneumonia and died
[2:13:31.520 --> 2:13:32.520]  Seven years ago
[2:13:32.520 --> 2:13:34.520]  We were driving along the ranch
[2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:35.520]  He looks at me
[2:13:35.520 --> 2:13:36.520]  And he's always got a friendly, nice guy
[2:13:36.520 --> 2:13:37.520]  Looking at me
[2:13:37.520 --> 2:13:38.520]  A really evil looking face
[2:13:38.520 --> 2:13:40.520]  It wasn't evil, it was just a really scary face
[2:13:40.520 --> 2:13:41.520]  I could be scary, too
[2:13:41.520 --> 2:13:42.520]  He was looking really scary
[2:13:42.520 --> 2:13:43.520]  I was like, damn, this guy's scary looking
[2:13:43.520 --> 2:13:44.520]  I was like
[2:13:44.520 --> 2:13:45.520]  He also looked like a dark cloud
[2:13:45.520 --> 2:13:47.520]  And he goes, children
[2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:48.520]  They were kidnapping children
[2:13:48.520 --> 2:13:49.520]  Out of orbit and he wasn't flying them out
[2:13:49.520 --> 2:13:50.520]  And that's who runs this
[2:13:50.520 --> 2:13:52.520]  They're hurting children
[2:13:52.520 --> 2:13:53.520]  And I said, what?
[2:13:53.520 --> 2:13:58.520]  And he goes, you know what they do
[2:13:58.520 --> 2:13:59.520]  I guess he's driving
[2:13:59.520 --> 2:14:00.520]  And he turns to me
[2:14:00.520 --> 2:14:04.520]  And goes, you know what they do
[2:14:04.520 --> 2:14:05.520]  We need to get them
[2:14:05.520 --> 2:14:12.520]  We need to stop them
[2:14:12.520 --> 2:14:13.520]  And then I remember
[2:14:13.520 --> 2:14:14.520]  There was like missionaries
[2:14:14.520 --> 2:14:15.520]  Coming to the house
[2:14:15.520 --> 2:14:16.520]  And all the former people
[2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:17.520]  From Central America
[2:14:17.520 --> 2:14:18.520]  And all the stuff they'd done
[2:14:18.520 --> 2:14:19.520]  Coming out of the house
[2:14:19.520 --> 2:14:20.520]  And obviously there were double agents
[2:14:20.520 --> 2:14:21.520]  And stuff
[2:14:21.520 --> 2:14:22.520]  He was dead soon after that
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:24.520]  Whatever they hit him with
[2:14:24.520 --> 2:14:27.520]  Killed my dad's cousin across the street
[2:14:27.520 --> 2:14:30.520]  Killed his son
[2:14:30.520 --> 2:14:32.520]  And killed him all in a month
[2:14:32.520 --> 2:14:33.520]  I mean, they got stuff
[2:14:33.520 --> 2:14:34.520]  It's incredible
[2:14:34.520 --> 2:14:35.520]  They can give you a virus
[2:14:35.520 --> 2:14:36.520]  Or a chemical that simulates like one
[2:14:36.520 --> 2:14:38.520]  It's a synthetic nanotic virus
[2:14:38.520 --> 2:14:39.520]  It eats your lungs
[2:14:39.520 --> 2:14:40.520]  And then it doesn't even replicate
[2:14:40.520 --> 2:14:41.520]  Or they can give you stuff
[2:14:41.520 --> 2:14:42.520]  That simulates
[2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:43.520]  I've already experienced it all
[2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:45.520]  And all these dumbasses on line go
[2:14:45.520 --> 2:14:46.520]  He had met his uncle
[2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:47.520]  And worked in Iran
[2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:48.520]  Contra
[2:14:48.520 --> 2:14:49.520]  He's one of them
[2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:50.520]  Because they
[2:14:50.520 --> 2:14:51.520]  What the hell are you talking about
[2:14:51.520 --> 2:14:52.520]  My uncle fought that stuff
[2:14:52.520 --> 2:14:53.520]  When he learned about it
[2:14:53.520 --> 2:14:54.520]  Was against it
[2:14:54.520 --> 2:14:56.520]  I'm independent
[2:14:56.520 --> 2:14:58.520]  I tell the former heads
[2:14:58.520 --> 2:14:59.520]  Of intelligence agencies
[2:14:59.520 --> 2:15:00.520]  What's going on
[2:15:00.520 --> 2:15:01.520]  I'm independent
[2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:02.520]  I spend all my time
[2:15:02.520 --> 2:15:03.520]  I'm my own man
[2:15:03.520 --> 2:15:04.520]  You idiots out there
[2:15:04.520 --> 2:15:05.520]  That there's no real men
[2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:06.520]  Or anyone that has any power
[2:15:06.520 --> 2:15:07.520]  Outside of the government
[2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:08.520]  Or the reason we're in this trouble
[2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:10.520]  You have God's birthright
[2:15:10.520 --> 2:15:12.520]  You have authority over these people
[2:15:12.520 --> 2:15:13.520]  In the name of Jesus Christ
[2:15:13.520 --> 2:15:15.520]  That's who I've got authority from
[2:15:15.520 --> 2:15:17.520]  Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:19.520]  Not the stupid CIA
[2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:20.520]  Not the pathetic FBI
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:23.520]  Not any of these criminal organizations
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:26.520]  You understand that?
[2:15:26.520 --> 2:15:28.520]  And all of you that are bots
[2:15:28.520 --> 2:15:29.520]  And work for the system to claim
[2:15:29.520 --> 2:15:30.520]  I'm with the feds
[2:15:30.520 --> 2:15:31.520]  When all my work's the opposite
[2:15:31.520 --> 2:15:33.520]  You got God to continue with
[2:15:33.520 --> 2:15:34.520]  I'm not worried about it

[2:17:24.520 --> 2:17:26.520]  Two pounds of what we think
[2:17:26.520 --> 2:17:28.520]  Is the single most underrated
[2:17:28.520 --> 2:17:30.520]  Superfood in the world, period
[2:17:30.520 --> 2:17:32.520]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com
[2:17:32.520 --> 2:17:34.520]  That's soupbeansurvival.com
[2:17:34.520 --> 2:17:36.520]  And discover the real reason

[2:17:39.520 --> 2:17:41.520]  At soupbeansurvival.com
[2:17:41.520 --> 2:18:07.520]  I've been fighting as hard as I can
[2:18:07.520 --> 2:18:11.520]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[2:18:11.520 --> 2:18:13.520]  That all viewers and all listeners
[2:18:13.520 --> 2:18:15.520]  Tell everybody they know about the show
[2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:17.520]  Because people are ready to wake up
[2:18:17.520 --> 2:18:18.520]  And ready to hear the truth
[2:18:18.520 --> 2:18:20.520]  So we've got an information warfare
[2:18:20.520 --> 2:18:22.520]  The enemy and try to stop their agenda
[2:18:22.520 --> 2:18:24.520]  And we've also got to get personally prepared
[2:18:24.520 --> 2:18:25.520]  And one of the number one things to do
[2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:26.520]  Is high quality storeable food
[2:18:26.520 --> 2:18:28.520]  We've got the best food, ready to ship
[2:18:28.520 --> 2:18:29.520]  At very affordable prices
[2:18:29.520 --> 2:18:31.520]  At infowarstore.com
[2:18:31.520 --> 2:18:33.520]  So whether it's a month or a six month
[2:18:33.520 --> 2:18:34.520]  Or a year supply
[2:18:34.520 --> 2:18:35.520]  Or specialty diets
[2:18:35.520 --> 2:18:36.520]  It's ready to ship right now
[2:18:36.520 --> 2:18:38.520]  So get your numbers in before food prices go up
[2:18:38.520 --> 2:18:40.520]  And before there are long lines and waits
[2:18:40.520 --> 2:18:42.520]  Because believe me, serious times are coming
[2:18:42.520 --> 2:19:11.520]  Get ready at infowarstore.com
[2:19:12.520 --> 2:19:14.520]  And now their puppet bite has announced
[2:19:14.520 --> 2:19:16.520]  The forced inoculation of 100 million Americans
[2:19:16.520 --> 2:19:18.520]  To keep their jobs in total violation
[2:19:18.520 --> 2:19:20.520]  Of the Nuremberg code
[2:19:20.520 --> 2:19:21.520]  This is criminal
[2:19:21.520 --> 2:19:23.520]  And he's lying saying it's an approved vaccine
[2:19:23.520 --> 2:19:24.520]  When they did not approve it
[2:19:24.520 --> 2:19:26.520]  They say that's a 20, 25 maybe
[2:19:26.520 --> 2:19:28.520]  They just expanded the emergency authorization
[2:19:28.520 --> 2:19:30.520]  That's why the two top scientists quit
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:31.520]  A week and a half ago
[2:19:31.520 --> 2:19:33.520]  Well, you live to see it
[2:19:33.520 --> 2:19:35.520]  Absolute new world order world guide
[2:19:35.520 --> 2:19:36.520]  And we're going to see it
[2:19:36.520 --> 2:19:37.520]  We're going to see it
[2:19:37.520 --> 2:19:38.520]  We're going to see it
[2:19:38.520 --> 2:19:39.520]  We're going to see it
[2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:40.520]  We're going to see it
[2:19:40.520 --> 2:19:42.520]  Absolute new world order world government
[2:19:42.520 --> 2:20:11.520]  If you submit, they will totally enslave you
[2:20:12.520 --> 2:20:38.520]  If you submit, they will totally enslave you
[2:20:38.520 --> 2:20:41.520]  Stopped into a church
[2:20:41.520 --> 2:20:45.520]  I passed along the way
[2:20:45.520 --> 2:20:49.520]  Well, I got down on my knees
[2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:50.520]  That's where your strength is
[2:20:50.520 --> 2:20:52.520]  Not standing up all powerful
[2:20:52.520 --> 2:20:54.520]  Over people like your arrogant
[2:20:54.520 --> 2:20:57.520]  New world order narcissist
[2:20:57.520 --> 2:21:00.520]  Get down on your knees to God
[2:21:00.520 --> 2:21:02.520]  To get in line with God
[2:21:02.520 --> 2:21:03.520]  Doesn't mean we're all perfect
[2:21:03.520 --> 2:21:05.520]  We got to keep trying
[2:21:05.520 --> 2:21:06.520]  The more I get in line with God
[2:21:06.520 --> 2:21:08.520]  It's just incredible
[2:21:08.520 --> 2:21:12.520]  These Satanists don't know what they're missing
[2:21:12.520 --> 2:21:14.520]  All right, let's hit the good news here
[2:21:14.520 --> 2:21:16.520]  We got some really sick, horrible stuff
[2:21:16.520 --> 2:21:19.520]  Coming up next segment, ladies and gentlemen
[2:21:19.520 --> 2:21:21.520]  It's got to be exposed
[2:21:21.520 --> 2:21:22.520]  Believe me, I don't want to go there
[2:21:22.520 --> 2:21:23.520]  But it's got to be done
[2:21:23.520 --> 2:21:26.520]  This is the tip of the iceberg
[2:21:26.520 --> 2:21:28.520]  Video of college football fans
[2:21:28.520 --> 2:21:30.520]  Shouting f-biden during games goes viral
[2:21:30.520 --> 2:21:32.520]  It's happening at every game
[2:21:32.520 --> 2:21:34.520]  UT, Alabama
[2:21:34.520 --> 2:21:35.520]  It doesn't matter, it's all of them
[2:21:35.520 --> 2:21:39.520]  We've got literally dozens of them, it's incredible
[2:21:39.520 --> 2:21:41.520]  You need to pick me up, ladies and gentlemen
[2:21:41.520 --> 2:21:42.520]  Go watch this stuff
[2:21:42.520 --> 2:21:45.520]  Because they know Trump won by 20 points
[2:21:45.520 --> 2:21:46.520]  They know the truth
[2:21:46.520 --> 2:21:48.520]  They know Biden's a puppet
[2:21:48.520 --> 2:21:50.520]  So no matter what the system tries
[2:21:50.520 --> 2:21:51.520]  The people don't like Kamala
[2:21:51.520 --> 2:21:53.520]  They don't like any of it
[2:21:53.520 --> 2:21:54.520]  And they're black, white, they're Hispanic
[2:21:54.520 --> 2:21:56.520]  They're Asian, they're old, young
[2:21:56.520 --> 2:21:57.520]  They want America, they want freedom
[2:21:57.520 --> 2:21:58.520]  They know it's all crap
[2:21:58.520 --> 2:22:00.520]  They're not wearing your stupid mask
[2:22:00.520 --> 2:22:01.520]  But don't worry, they're going to release
[2:22:01.520 --> 2:22:03.520]  More serious bio weapons soon
[2:22:03.520 --> 2:22:04.520]  That's what we got to expose
[2:22:04.520 --> 2:22:05.520]  And they have the motive
[2:22:05.520 --> 2:22:07.520]  So when they do it, they get the hate
[2:22:07.520 --> 2:22:08.520]  Oh, they're going to do it
[2:22:08.520 --> 2:22:11.520]  We don't have much time to stop them
[2:22:11.520 --> 2:22:13.520]  People ask, why does this guy get so much energy?
[2:22:13.520 --> 2:22:14.520]  Why is he so pissed?
[2:22:14.520 --> 2:22:16.520]  Is he on cocaine?
[2:22:16.520 --> 2:22:17.520]  I hate cocaine
[2:22:17.520 --> 2:22:18.520]  I've done it three times in my life
[2:22:18.520 --> 2:22:19.520]  I hate hard drugs
[2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:21.520]  I like caffeine and alcohol
[2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:22.520]  And I don't even drink anymore
[2:22:22.520 --> 2:22:24.520]  I know about the plan
[2:22:24.520 --> 2:22:27.520]  I know they're doing it
[2:22:27.520 --> 2:22:29.520]  You think Ernest Ramirez is pissed now?
[2:22:29.520 --> 2:22:32.520]  Yeah, his son, they killed him
[2:22:32.520 --> 2:22:34.520]  I know they're coming for us
[2:22:34.520 --> 2:22:36.520]  So I saw somebody robbing my neighbor
[2:22:36.520 --> 2:22:37.520]  Mugging my neighbor
[2:22:37.520 --> 2:22:39.520]  I jump around and get a gun
[2:22:39.520 --> 2:22:41.520]  Because that's what you do
[2:22:41.520 --> 2:22:45.520]  I'm alive, not a jellyfish
[2:22:45.520 --> 2:22:48.520]  We're here to get people out of their trance
[2:22:48.520 --> 2:22:50.520]  We got more, too
[2:22:50.520 --> 2:22:53.520]  Video, Sleepy Joe is a uniner
[2:22:53.520 --> 2:22:55.520]  After Yankee fans and Metfans
[2:22:55.520 --> 2:22:56.520]  Both chant F-Biden
[2:22:56.520 --> 2:22:58.520]  We're going to play both of these in a moment
[2:22:58.520 --> 2:23:00.520]  And then, from Jack Masoby
[2:23:00.520 --> 2:23:02.520]  The video appears, the show Biden getting booed
[2:23:02.520 --> 2:23:04.520]  At 9-Eleven Memorial
[2:23:04.520 --> 2:23:06.520]  Everywhere he goes
[2:23:06.520 --> 2:23:08.520]  That's why he didn't speak at any of the events
[2:23:08.520 --> 2:23:10.520]  Because he came and got up on a stage
[2:23:10.520 --> 2:23:12.520]  They had to keep the families out
[2:23:12.520 --> 2:23:14.520]  They all met with Trump down the street
[2:23:14.520 --> 2:23:16.520]  Go ahead and play, I know we got a bunch up
[2:23:16.520 --> 2:23:18.520]  Just play some of the football
[2:23:18.520 --> 2:23:19.520]  Some of the baseball
[2:23:19.520 --> 2:23:23.520]  And then him getting booed at the 9-Eleven Memorial
[2:23:23.520 --> 2:23:25.520]  Here it is
[2:23:25.520 --> 2:23:30.520]  F-Biden, F-Biden
[2:23:30.520 --> 2:23:32.520]  We're bleeping it out, folks
[2:23:32.520 --> 2:23:36.520]  F-Biden, F-Biden
[2:23:36.520 --> 2:23:41.520]  F-Biden, F-Biden
[2:23:41.520 --> 2:23:46.520]  F-Biden, F-Biden
[2:23:46.520 --> 2:23:48.520]  Now, the reason that this is great
[2:23:48.520 --> 2:23:51.520]  For me to say, Joe Biden's a puff fit
[2:23:51.520 --> 2:23:53.520]  F the New World Order
[2:23:53.520 --> 2:23:56.520]  The Rockefeller, F-Plaus Schwab
[2:23:56.520 --> 2:23:59.520]  F Bill Gates
[2:23:59.520 --> 2:24:02.520]  Joe Biden
[2:24:02.520 --> 2:24:05.520]  Joe Biden
[2:24:05.520 --> 2:24:09.520]  Joe Biden
[2:24:09.520 --> 2:24:11.520]  The motorists, look
[2:24:11.520 --> 2:24:13.520]  The motorists
[2:24:15.520 --> 2:24:17.520]  Yeah, it's Obama
[2:24:20.520 --> 2:24:22.520]  So much of trash
[2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:24.520]  I don't want people for the globalists
[2:24:24.520 --> 2:24:26.520]  I didn't know he is
[2:24:26.520 --> 2:24:28.520]  Look at him
[2:24:30.520 --> 2:24:32.520]  He's a kid, so he runs over
[2:24:35.520 --> 2:24:38.520]  He literally walks like he has dementia
[2:24:47.520 --> 2:24:50.520]  Now, let's get into how they're counter-striking
[2:24:50.520 --> 2:24:52.520]  Against everybody
[2:24:52.520 --> 2:24:54.520]  With the same thing tyrants always do
[2:24:54.520 --> 2:24:56.520]  Breaking, this is on infowars.com
[2:24:56.520 --> 2:24:58.520]  You can go see it for yourself
[2:24:58.520 --> 2:25:00.520]  We should probably actually add Gregory's video
[2:25:00.520 --> 2:25:02.520]  To the top of this and repost it on infowars
[2:25:02.520 --> 2:25:04.520]  I don't think Gregory's the reporter we got posted this weekend
[2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:06.520]  Maybe it did, we need to get it back up, it's excellent
[2:25:06.520 --> 2:25:08.520]  On the same subject
[2:25:09.520 --> 2:25:11.520]  Breaking, Canada announces plan
[2:25:11.520 --> 2:25:13.520]  To merge with communist China
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:15.520]  Social credit score
[2:25:15.520 --> 2:25:18.520]  They put out a government report on the government website
[2:25:18.520 --> 2:25:20.520]  Saying on their income tax site
[2:25:20.520 --> 2:25:22.520]  You need to get ready
[2:25:22.520 --> 2:25:24.520]  To work with China, this is the new system here
[2:25:24.520 --> 2:25:26.520]  They're going to track what you say and do
[2:25:26.520 --> 2:25:28.520]  Here's how you comply with the communists
[2:25:30.520 --> 2:25:32.520]  Here's another one, book burning
[2:25:32.520 --> 2:25:34.520]  Woke Canadian schools
[2:25:34.520 --> 2:25:36.520]  Destroying nearly 5,000 books
[2:25:36.520 --> 2:25:38.520]  Deemed offensive to indigenous peoples
[2:25:38.520 --> 2:25:40.520]  Some were thrown away, some were burned
[2:25:40.520 --> 2:25:42.520]  Others just pulled off the shelf and thrown in the landfill
[2:25:44.520 --> 2:25:46.520]  Really, so we
[2:25:46.520 --> 2:25:48.520]  They've got Hitler's book
[2:25:48.520 --> 2:25:50.520]  They've got stuff written by Julius Caesar
[2:25:50.520 --> 2:25:52.520]  You want to read what everybody wrote
[2:25:52.520 --> 2:25:54.520]  We can't let you read that
[2:25:54.520 --> 2:25:56.520]  Schools in Ontario are facing backlash
[2:25:56.520 --> 2:25:58.520]  For burning or destroying books
[2:25:58.520 --> 2:26:00.520]  Deemed offensive to first nations
[2:26:00.520 --> 2:26:02.520]  It's for the natives that the government killed before
[2:26:02.520 --> 2:26:04.520]  Including classic comics such as
[2:26:04.520 --> 2:26:06.520]  Tintin
[2:26:06.520 --> 2:26:08.520]  And asterisk
[2:26:08.520 --> 2:26:10.520]  Tintin's funny, I like it
[2:26:10.520 --> 2:26:12.520]  The book burning labeled an act of flame
[2:26:12.520 --> 2:26:14.520]  Purification
[2:26:14.520 --> 2:26:16.520]  Stuff that Hitler did
[2:26:16.520 --> 2:26:18.520]  Yeah, roll that B roll you guys have
[2:26:18.520 --> 2:26:20.520]  From Indiana Jones last crusade
[2:26:20.520 --> 2:26:22.520]  Where it shows the Nazis were in the books, that's powerful
[2:26:22.520 --> 2:26:24.520]  They book burning labeled an act of flame
[2:26:24.520 --> 2:26:26.520]  Purification
[2:26:26.520 --> 2:26:28.520]  So when the left burns your house down, I guess that's a turn
[2:26:28.520 --> 2:26:30.520]  This is mostly peaceful and they burn down
[2:26:30.520 --> 2:26:32.520]  Two million dollars of businesses and homes
[2:26:32.520 --> 2:26:34.520]  That's mostly peaceful too
[2:26:34.520 --> 2:26:36.520]  Flame purification, they burned witches
[2:26:36.520 --> 2:26:38.520]  Flame purification
[2:26:38.520 --> 2:26:40.520]  The book burning labeled an act of flame
[2:26:40.520 --> 2:26:42.520]  Purification
[2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:44.520]  Was first undertaken in 2019
[2:26:44.520 --> 2:26:46.520]  By the province of
[2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:48.520]  Catholic school board
[2:26:48.520 --> 2:26:50.520]  A undertaking
[2:26:50.520 --> 2:26:52.520]  In the province of Catholic school board
[2:26:52.520 --> 2:26:54.520]  A French language school board
[2:26:54.520 --> 2:26:56.520]  Of southwestern Ontario that manages
[2:26:56.520 --> 2:26:58.520]  23 primary schools and 7 secondary schools
[2:26:58.520 --> 2:27:00.520]  According to the report, the French
[2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:02.520]  Language Broadcaster Radio Canada
[2:27:02.520 --> 2:27:04.520]  The first incident saw books
[2:27:04.520 --> 2:27:06.520]  Ceremonially burned
[2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:08.520]  Wow
[2:27:08.520 --> 2:27:10.520]  With the ashes
[2:27:10.520 --> 2:27:12.520]  And a fertilizer to plant a tree
[2:27:12.520 --> 2:27:14.520]  Other burnings were
[2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:16.520]  Planned but halted due to the coronavirus
[2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:18.520]  Pandemic
[2:27:18.520 --> 2:27:20.520]  So there you go ladies and gentlemen
[2:27:20.520 --> 2:27:22.520]  We bury the ashes of racism
[2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:24.520]  Discrimination and stereotypes
[2:27:24.520 --> 2:27:26.520]  In the hope that we will grow an inclusive country
[2:27:26.520 --> 2:27:28.520]  Where you all follow what the globalists say
[2:27:28.520 --> 2:27:30.520]  As they exploit everybody
[2:27:30.520 --> 2:27:32.520]  Meanwhile
[2:27:32.520 --> 2:27:34.520]  Maryland judge allegedly kills himself
[2:27:34.520 --> 2:27:36.520]  Minutes before FBI agents come to arrest him
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:38.520]  For sexually abusing children
[2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:40.520]  He had a hunting cabin
[2:27:40.520 --> 2:27:42.520]  He would invite them into it and then come
[2:27:42.520 --> 2:27:44.520]  And touch them in the showers
[2:27:44.520 --> 2:27:46.520]  Then it turned out he had cameras hidden in there
[2:27:46.520 --> 2:27:48.520]  When the police found it, the FBI found it
[2:27:48.520 --> 2:27:50.520]  He ate the SIM card in front of them
[2:27:50.520 --> 2:27:52.520]  They were coming back with a warrant and
[2:27:52.520 --> 2:27:54.520]  Well, he shot himself in the head reportedly
[2:27:54.520 --> 2:27:56.520]  Who knows
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:27:58.520]  The FBI might be a complete opposite
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:00.520]  Might have been actually exposing bed of all rings or something
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:02.520]  Washington high school scraps
[2:28:02.520 --> 2:28:04.520]  Plans for patriotic attire during 9-11 tribute
[2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:06.520]  Says it could be seen
[2:28:06.520 --> 2:28:08.520]  As
[2:28:08.520 --> 2:28:10.520]  Racially insensitive, you see
[2:28:10.520 --> 2:28:12.520]  Everything's racially insensitive, that's what
[2:28:12.520 --> 2:28:14.520]  Biden and George W. said
[2:28:14.520 --> 2:28:16.520]  We're not worried about the Islamists now
[2:28:16.520 --> 2:28:18.520]  In 9-11, we're worried about American patriots
[2:28:18.520 --> 2:28:20.520]  To attack the Capitol
[2:28:20.520 --> 2:28:22.520]  And when we come back, I'm going to get into
[2:28:22.520 --> 2:28:24.520]  Just the whole sexual takeover of our children
[2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:26.520]  With Lawn Boy
[2:28:26.520 --> 2:28:28.520]  And
[2:28:28.520 --> 2:28:30.520]  You know, I don't feel like
[2:28:30.520 --> 2:28:32.520]  Looking at it again myself
[2:28:32.520 --> 2:28:34.520]  But this needs to be out there
[2:28:34.520 --> 2:28:36.520]  I said 6th graders, it's 4th graders
[2:28:36.520 --> 2:28:38.520]  Are being taught how to have sex
[2:28:38.520 --> 2:28:40.520]  With men
[2:28:40.520 --> 2:29:08.520]  Yeah, we'll be right back
[2:29:10.520 --> 2:29:12.520]  We'll be right back
[2:29:40.520 --> 2:29:44.520]  In late August,
[2:29:44.520 --> 2:29:46.520]  Info War saw an explosion
[2:29:46.520 --> 2:29:48.520]  Of orders
[2:29:48.520 --> 2:29:50.520]  Because our audience understands
[2:29:50.520 --> 2:29:52.520]  That the globalists are destabilizing
[2:29:52.520 --> 2:29:54.520]  The planet by design
[2:29:54.520 --> 2:29:56.520]  And are attempting to cause an economic
[2:29:56.520 --> 2:29:58.520]  And financial collapse
[2:29:58.520 --> 2:30:00.520]  Worldwide
[2:30:00.520 --> 2:30:02.520]  Now ladies and gentlemen, storable food has always
[2:30:02.520 --> 2:30:04.520]  Been something that's important to have
[2:30:04.520 --> 2:30:06.520]  It's a check box that everybody needs to have
[2:30:06.520 --> 2:30:08.520]  Taking care of, right along with water filtration

[2:30:40.520 --> 2:30:42.520]  And not under their control
[2:30:42.520 --> 2:31:08.520]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told and the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[2:31:08.520 --> 2:31:14.520]  The Hindu Chakras align with the endocrine system, the chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye
[2:31:14.520 --> 2:31:24.520]  Also described as the seat of the soul, the pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness and otherwise unseen dimensions of reality
[2:31:24.520 --> 2:31:29.520]  Fluoride free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy

[2:31:35.520 --> 2:31:38.520]  And the propure shower head will seal the deal

[2:33:37.520 --> 2:33:49.520]  On your screen, thousands of firefighters and police are marching, refusing to be part of the vaccine passport, the forced inoculations, and the deadly tyranny
[2:33:49.520 --> 2:33:53.520]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, I'm Alan Schoenger, host
[2:33:53.520 --> 2:34:02.520]  I was just sent an incredible OAN video that the crew is giving me articles to back up because I know they show those on screen
[2:34:02.520 --> 2:34:05.520]  That we're going to air next segment
[2:34:05.520 --> 2:34:12.520]  I told you I've looked at the numbers and that people that are vaccinated with any of these shots are way more apt to get sick and die
[2:34:12.520 --> 2:34:16.520]  They've been trying to cover those numbers up and the studies actually show that
[2:34:16.520 --> 2:34:28.520]  A new big prestigious study just came out and wait till you hear how many times more likely you are to get hospitalized with COVID if you've had a vaccine
[2:34:28.520 --> 2:34:36.520]  5 times, 10 times, 20 times, 25 times
[2:34:36.520 --> 2:34:41.520]  Next segment, I'm going to get it up on Band-Aid Video ASAP
[2:34:41.520 --> 2:34:48.520]  These people are ballsy, man, that's why they skipped the animal trials, they've already secretly tested all this on animals before they released COVID-19
[2:34:48.520 --> 2:34:53.520]  And that's in the Peter Dazik emails that we did reports on 6 months ago
[2:34:53.520 --> 2:34:58.520]  And the videos, they're like, oh, get ready for it, combine the 5 hours, there's a mega vaccine for it
[2:34:58.520 --> 2:35:05.520]  And then in December, when they already released it, nobody knew about it, they go, okay, prepare the vaccine, tell the different vaccine makers what to start making
[2:35:05.520 --> 2:35:11.520]  That's how, man, in January they already had a COVID vaccine, they made it in 2 days
[2:35:11.520 --> 2:35:13.520]  Oh, they didn't
[2:35:13.520 --> 2:35:15.520]  They just tell you that crap
[2:35:15.520 --> 2:35:21.520]  So they know what they're doing, that's coming up, I mean I'm just blown away by what's coming out
[2:35:21.520 --> 2:35:27.520]  This is just dumb-founding, in fact as soon as Rob or whoever Rob do or whoever can get that up, I sent to Rob
[2:35:27.520 --> 2:35:32.520]  Please get an article out on m4s.com as he's going viral, this is incredible
[2:35:32.520 --> 2:35:36.520]  Okay, let's get into it right now
[2:35:36.520 --> 2:35:40.520]  There are a bunch of books that are even worse than this one, I've covered some of them here
[2:35:40.520 --> 2:35:50.520]  Where it describes, I was 8 years old and the neighbor was named such and such and he took me in the shed
[2:35:50.520 --> 2:35:55.520]  And I really loved it and it describes all this horrible abuse of children
[2:35:55.520 --> 2:35:59.520]  And you wonder, what are they doing? It's like, oh, the public school made a mistake, but it's all over the country
[2:35:59.520 --> 2:36:08.520]  Police in Germany investigate 30,000 potential suspects in pedophile probe
[2:36:08.520 --> 2:36:11.520]  DW.com, that's from a year ago
[2:36:11.520 --> 2:36:16.520]  That's just in one city, all over the country, industrial level, take children from Christians mainly
[2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:20.520]  And give them to convicted pedophiles to create the new love of a 3-year-old being raped
[2:36:20.520 --> 2:36:24.520]  By 7 or 8, then they supply them to politicians and people they want to blackmail
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:27.520]  And the pedophiles are then the pimps over the children
[2:36:27.520 --> 2:36:34.520]  Okay, now, that's Germany, that's our CIA, that's globalist CIA, that got control of a country, West Germany
[2:36:34.520 --> 2:36:38.520]  And in the 60s set this up, so that's their dream, our nightmare
[2:36:38.520 --> 2:36:44.520]  People that run the CIA, just like they put pedophiles in charge in Afghanistan, at the top are pedophiles
[2:36:44.520 --> 2:36:46.520]  Okay, there you go
[2:36:46.520 --> 2:36:53.520]  Here it is in the New Yorker, this year in July, the German experiment that placed foster children with pedophiles
[2:36:53.520 --> 2:36:58.520]  Judge Clear's Boy Scouts, 850 million sex abuse settlement
[2:36:58.520 --> 2:37:03.520]  Just like they make 40 billion on oxy-cotton, and then they pay a billion dollar settlement
[2:37:03.520 --> 2:37:06.520]  And they're giving immunity by the judge, not getting in trouble, they do it on purpose
[2:37:06.520 --> 2:37:11.520]  The same FDA head is back now, she's approving all these shots, even though they're not been tested
[2:37:11.520 --> 2:37:15.520]  On, publicly on humans, on animals, they have been
[2:37:15.520 --> 2:37:20.520]  So here it is, see, and remember, they sent them in at the main Boy Scout global event
[2:37:20.520 --> 2:37:24.520]  Hundreds of thousands of people gave, you know, five, six, seven-year-olds condoms
[2:37:24.520 --> 2:37:29.520]  It was so cute in the news, the Libbers were like, oh, wonderful, they're teaching young boys how to be gay
[2:37:29.520 --> 2:37:33.520]  It's gay when men have sex with them, this is what they've done
[2:37:33.520 --> 2:37:36.520]  And then they brought down the whole institution and took it over
[2:37:36.520 --> 2:37:38.520]  Like everything else they wrecked
[2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:44.520]  Now, here's TikTok mom calls out Texas school board over fourth grade book
[2:37:44.520 --> 2:37:51.520]  A concerned mom has called out a Texas school board after a profane book
[2:37:51.520 --> 2:37:56.520]  It's targeting children with sex, so it's pedophilic, in my view
[2:37:56.520 --> 2:38:03.520]  Was found in the library, TikTok user, key slave, uploaded the footage of the board meaning
[2:38:03.520 --> 2:38:06.520]  Which has since gone viral, and that's why all of you should go speak out
[2:38:06.520 --> 2:38:11.520]  Now folks, the left is online making excuses for it, saying it's no big deal
[2:38:11.520 --> 2:38:17.520]  It's always an accident, see the Twitter user, oh, it's just an accident, it's all a mistake
[2:38:17.520 --> 2:38:21.520]  And folks, here's Lawn Boy, and again, this is what fourth graders are being shown
[2:38:21.520 --> 2:38:25.520]  This is all over the country, this is stuff even, I'm not going to show it
[2:38:25.520 --> 2:38:28.520]  If you want to go look it up, I just can't even look it again myself
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:30.520]  It's just unbelievable
[2:38:30.520 --> 2:38:34.520]  Okay, so let's just stop right there and go to the mother
[2:38:34.520 --> 2:38:41.520]  The cybercom unit of Germany, of course, is now discovered
[2:38:41.520 --> 2:38:43.520]  The government officially did this, it's just insane
[2:38:43.520 --> 2:38:47.520]  But here's the lady in the Texas town that are fronting these monsters
[2:38:47.520 --> 2:38:54.520]  I'm going to explain to you the book that he received, but Mr. McKay, I pray you're a man for work
[2:38:54.520 --> 2:38:59.520]  Last week I asked my children if I could check the books that they picked up from the school
[2:38:59.520 --> 2:39:05.520]  My son picked up this brand new book from the shelves and taught us Lawn Boy
[2:39:05.520 --> 2:39:10.520]  He was under the impression it was about a kid that ends up with a gay mowing the grass at Disneyland
[2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:13.520]  I'd like to share a few quotes with you
[2:39:13.520 --> 2:39:15.520]  Let's turn it around
[2:39:15.520 --> 2:39:21.520]  On page 19, note that it really matters in fourth grade, at a church youth group meeting out in the bushes
[2:39:21.520 --> 2:39:25.520]  I touched Doug Goble's dick and he touched mine
[2:39:25.520 --> 2:39:29.520]  In fact, there was even some mouths involved
[2:39:29.520 --> 2:39:32.520]  That's not page 191
[2:39:32.520 --> 2:39:35.520]  What if I told you I touched another guy's dick?
[2:39:35.520 --> 2:39:38.520]  What if I told you I sucked it? I was 10 years old, but it's true
[2:39:38.520 --> 2:39:41.520]  I put Doug Goble's dick in my mouth
[2:39:41.520 --> 2:39:43.520]  I was in fourth grade, it was no big deal
[2:39:43.520 --> 2:39:46.520]  He said mine, too, and you know what? It wasn't terrible
[2:39:46.520 --> 2:39:51.520]  Page 174, I don't know if I put it in this line for this one
[2:39:51.520 --> 2:39:53.520]  Yeah, I did
[2:39:53.520 --> 2:39:57.520]  He talked about old times at the church, but never mentioned our penises
[2:39:57.520 --> 2:40:02.520]  Or the fact that he never said 10 words to me after I looked right in the bushes
[2:40:02.520 --> 2:40:05.520]  Not a single reference to holding or tying or sucking dicks
[2:40:05.520 --> 2:40:10.520]  All I could think about while he was chatting me up was his little salamander
[2:40:10.520 --> 2:40:14.520]  Between my fourth grade fingers, rapidly engorging with blood
[2:40:14.520 --> 2:40:17.520]  Page 193, I don't think some of this
[2:40:17.520 --> 2:40:19.520]  Why won't you admit we slept each other's dicks?
[2:40:19.520 --> 2:40:23.520]  We should have first be barred, then you showed me your dick
[2:40:23.520 --> 2:40:26.520]  And folks, I've got other books here that they've got in schools
[2:40:26.520 --> 2:40:29.520]  That's Leander, where they have drag queen story time
[2:40:29.520 --> 2:40:31.520]  That in Houston they have a bunch of convicted pedophiles doing it
[2:40:31.520 --> 2:40:34.520]  And the local news said, hey, you gotta get them while they're young and laughed
[2:40:34.520 --> 2:40:40.520]  So Leander is again a suburb of Austin, Texas, northwest of it
[2:40:43.520 --> 2:40:47.520]  Zoom in on that, and this is everywhere
[2:40:47.520 --> 2:40:52.520]  It's not clear if the schooling in Texas was aware of these separate titles
[2:40:52.520 --> 2:40:55.520]  There's other books as well, but it was likely a mistake
[2:40:55.520 --> 2:40:58.520]  Yes, it's all a big mistake
[2:40:58.520 --> 2:41:03.520]  Just like placing 30,000 children in one German city with convicted pedophiles
[2:41:03.520 --> 2:41:09.520]  And then taking them to sex orgies in churches where satanic rights were conducted
[2:41:09.520 --> 2:41:11.520]  That's mainline news, ladies and gentlemen
[2:41:11.520 --> 2:41:14.520]  The German experiment that placed foster children with pedophiles
[2:41:14.520 --> 2:41:19.520]  And then the Boy Scouts of America, you guys find the article, get it, search web
[2:41:19.520 --> 2:41:22.520]  It was like eight years ago
[2:41:22.520 --> 2:41:26.520]  Boy Scouts, you know, global annual meeting to hand out free condoms
[2:41:26.520 --> 2:41:30.520]  To people as young as, I think it was like eight years old or something
[2:41:30.520 --> 2:41:34.520]  I mean, what does that say? Here's your condoms, a bunch of, I mean, this is what's going on
[2:41:34.520 --> 2:41:36.520]  There it is
[2:41:36.520 --> 2:41:39.520]  Boy Scouts provide condoms in upcoming World Jamborees
[2:41:39.520 --> 2:41:43.520]  Scroll down, I'm saying eight years, let me see if I'm right, memory-wise
[2:41:43.520 --> 2:41:49.520]  2001, 2018, I guess they did it again
[2:41:49.520 --> 2:41:53.520]  So now they're all bankrupt, now it's all over, mission accomplished
[2:41:53.520 --> 2:41:57.520]  Ruined something wholesome, turned it into a giant pedophile party
[2:41:57.520 --> 2:42:03.520]  All right, oh, I forgot this, transgender fighter Elena McLaughlin, it was a U.S. Army
[2:42:03.520 --> 2:42:06.520]  Wins MMA to be beating a woman up to death
[2:42:06.520 --> 2:42:11.520]  And he's got him in the military, he's got him, you know, all right here
[2:42:11.520 --> 2:42:14.520]  And they've got his transformation to this, they're calling him a woman
[2:42:14.520 --> 2:42:18.520]  It's just all insanity in your face, ladies and gentlemen
[2:42:18.520 --> 2:42:21.520]  That's all this is, is to get you to accept anything they want
[2:42:21.520 --> 2:42:24.520]  Like convicted sex offenders going into women's side of the gym
[2:42:24.520 --> 2:42:27.520]  And getting in the hot tub with a heart on, saying he wants to have sex with women
[2:42:27.520 --> 2:42:29.520]  As long as he says he's a woman, it's okay
[2:42:29.520 --> 2:42:32.520]  There are men getting women pregnant in prisons all across the country
[2:42:32.520 --> 2:42:36.520]  Saying that they're really women, and they say two women had a baby today
[2:42:36.520 --> 2:42:41.520]  It's all part of the gaslighting
[2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:10.520]  And the vaccine passport on your, quote, iPhone or droid
[2:43:10.520 --> 2:43:12.520]  Tracking and tracing everything you do
[2:43:12.520 --> 2:43:15.520]  And telling you when you can go outside of your house or where you can go
[2:43:15.520 --> 2:43:18.520]  Not just for COVID-19, but for carbon taxes
[2:43:18.520 --> 2:43:22.520]  So as I've said a thousand times, submission is death
[2:43:22.520 --> 2:43:25.520]  You give into this just for your job, or to be able to go to the bar
[2:43:25.520 --> 2:43:27.520]  Or to be able to, quote, fly on an airplane
[2:43:27.520 --> 2:43:30.520]  Then they're going to slowly put the screws in
[2:43:30.520 --> 2:43:34.520]  With these apps on your phone to control where you go and what you do
[2:43:34.520 --> 2:43:37.520]  And dog train you, riding a total slavery
[2:43:37.520 --> 2:43:42.520]  This is criminal, it's illegal, it's tyranny, and we must resist and not comply
[2:43:42.520 --> 2:43:47.520]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently
[2:43:47.520 --> 2:43:50.520]  Measure what's happening in the atmosphere
[2:43:50.520 --> 2:43:53.520]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about my NASA
[2:43:53.520 --> 2:43:55.520]  And other governments and other agencies
[2:43:55.520 --> 2:43:58.520]  They all disagree on what's really happening with the climate
[2:43:58.520 --> 2:44:01.520]  The only constant, the only great truth is
[2:44:01.520 --> 2:44:03.520]  Change is the only constant
[2:44:03.520 --> 2:44:06.520]  So yes, climate change is totally real
[2:44:06.520 --> 2:44:09.520]  But notice, first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s
[2:44:09.520 --> 2:44:11.520]  And then it's going to be global warming
[2:44:11.520 --> 2:44:13.520]  And when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to
[2:44:13.520 --> 2:44:15.520]  Okay, now it's just climate change
[2:44:15.520 --> 2:44:19.520]  But did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing
[2:44:19.520 --> 2:44:23.520]  When it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy
[2:44:23.520 --> 2:44:27.520]  And Bill Gates and the UN, they have weather control trees from 1979
[2:44:27.520 --> 2:44:31.520]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time
[2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:34.520]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize
[2:44:34.520 --> 2:44:37.520]  For an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines
[2:44:37.520 --> 2:44:38.520]  To control the weather
[2:44:38.520 --> 2:45:02.520]  So yes, man-made climate change is real
[2:45:08.520 --> 2:45:36.520]  So yes, man-made climate change is real
[2:45:36.520 --> 2:46:05.520]  So yes, man-made climate change is real
[2:46:05.520 --> 2:46:34.520]  So yes, man-made climate change is real
[2:46:34.520 --> 2:46:56.520]  So yes, man-made climate change is real
[2:46:56.520 --> 2:47:16.520]  So yes, man-made climate change is real
[2:47:16.520 --> 2:47:25.520]  So yes, man-made climate change is real
[2:47:25.520 --> 2:47:54.520]  So yes, man-made climate change is real
[2:47:54.520 --> 2:48:23.520]  So yes, man-made climate change is real
[2:48:23.520 --> 2:48:52.520]  So yes, man-made climate change is real
[2:48:52.520 --> 2:48:55.520]  Surprisingly, the medical establishment is bucking science
[2:48:55.520 --> 2:48:58.520]  That's been settled on for nearly a century now
[2:48:58.520 --> 2:49:02.520]  By claiming that vaccines are a better solution to the China virus
[2:49:02.520 --> 2:49:05.520]  Than your own body's natural defense system
[2:49:05.520 --> 2:49:08.520]  So, what's the truth?
[2:49:08.520 --> 2:49:11.520]  We've been in this pandemic for a year and a half now
[2:49:11.520 --> 2:49:13.520]  What do the numbers say?
[2:49:13.520 --> 2:49:18.520]  Well, unsurprisingly, the numbers back up what we've known all along
[2:49:18.520 --> 2:49:20.520]  Or at least what most of us have known
[2:49:20.520 --> 2:49:24.520]  That our bodies are far better at fighting this virus
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:27.520]  And many others than the vaccine is
[2:49:27.520 --> 2:49:29.520]  Before we get started, we want to be clear
[2:49:29.520 --> 2:49:33.520]  OAN is not taking an anti-vax position
[2:49:33.520 --> 2:49:36.520]  Vaccines have been proven to be tremendously helpful
[2:49:36.520 --> 2:49:40.520]  And have saved countless millions of lives since their inception
[2:49:40.520 --> 2:49:45.520]  The point is, they aren't perfect and they're not all created equal
[2:49:45.520 --> 2:49:49.520]  Effective vaccines typically take the better part of a decade
[2:49:49.520 --> 2:49:52.520]  To get right, not the better part of six months
[2:49:52.520 --> 2:49:55.520]  Which is why we're seeing the huge number of problems
[2:49:55.520 --> 2:49:58.520]  With this vaccine against the China virus in particular
[2:49:58.520 --> 2:50:02.520]  And now, scientists in Israel, a country with more experience
[2:50:02.520 --> 2:50:05.520]  With this virus than pretty much anywhere in the world
[2:50:05.520 --> 2:50:09.520]  Have found that humans' natural immune protection against COVID
[2:50:09.520 --> 2:50:12.520]  Is not only much better than expected
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:17.520]  It's far and away more powerful than any of the vaccines we're using today
[2:50:17.520 --> 2:50:20.520]  The study involved looking at the medical records
[2:50:20.520 --> 2:50:22.520]  Of not just a handful of participants
[2:50:22.520 --> 2:50:26.520]  But tens of thousands of Israelis infected with the China virus
[2:50:26.520 --> 2:50:30.520]  It's the largest real-world study ever conducted on the virus
[2:50:30.520 --> 2:50:34.520]  And it found COVID survivors who developed a natural immunity
[2:50:34.520 --> 2:50:37.520]  Were much less likely to get infected again
[2:50:37.520 --> 2:50:40.520]  Than patients who were fully vaccinated
[2:50:40.520 --> 2:50:42.520]  Not only with the regular coronavirus
[2:50:42.520 --> 2:50:44.520]  But with the new Delta variant as well
[2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:48.520]  Fully vaccinated patients were also far likelier
[2:50:48.520 --> 2:50:51.520]  To develop symptoms, become hospitalized
[2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:54.520]  And require serious medical treatment
[2:50:54.520 --> 2:50:57.520]  Than patients who developed natural immunity
[2:50:57.520 --> 2:51:01.520]  Scientists who reviewed the data say this is a textbook example
[2:51:01.520 --> 2:51:05.520]  Of how natural immunity is better than vaccination
[2:51:05.520 --> 2:51:09.520]  Better than vaccination
[2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:11.520]  These are actually a doctor's experience
[2:51:11.520 --> 2:51:14.520]  We downloaded that, it made the audio a little off a little
[2:51:14.520 --> 2:51:17.520]  It's fixed, and we just posted it minutes ago
[2:51:17.520 --> 2:51:19.520]  That's why it's got eight views
[2:51:19.520 --> 2:51:21.520]  To make the featured video, write stories about it
[2:51:21.520 --> 2:51:26.520]  Shock study, vaccinated 27 times more likely to catch COVID
[2:51:26.520 --> 2:51:31.520]  Not just that you're 27 times better off of your natural immunity
[2:51:31.520 --> 2:51:35.520]  But it makes you even sicker even if you don't have it
[2:51:35.520 --> 2:51:40.520]  Versus vaccinated in the past with other so-called vaccines
[2:51:40.520 --> 2:51:43.520]  If the vaccine worked, they just might have side effects
[2:51:43.520 --> 2:51:46.520]  Or be contaminated, or the globalists would spike them
[2:51:46.520 --> 2:51:49.520]  If I did tetanus shots in Africa, they got caught in the mid-90s
[2:51:49.520 --> 2:51:51.520]  Putting sterilence in it, this isn't a vaccine
[2:51:51.520 --> 2:51:53.520]  This is a gene therapy
[2:51:53.520 --> 2:51:57.520]  And so you're 27 times more likely to catch COVID
[2:51:57.520 --> 2:52:01.520]  Or to get sick, you're 27 times more likely to get COVID
[2:52:01.520 --> 2:52:03.520]  And more apt to get sick as well
[2:52:03.520 --> 2:52:08.520]  It's all in the study that we've posted to infowars.com
[2:52:08.520 --> 2:52:10.520]  We've already been posted to band.video
[2:52:10.520 --> 2:52:14.520]  So great job to the crew getting that back up so quickly
[2:52:14.520 --> 2:52:17.520]  Okay
[2:52:17.520 --> 2:52:20.520]  Here's the big news, ladies and gentlemen
[2:52:20.520 --> 2:52:21.520]  And we knew this would happen
[2:52:21.520 --> 2:52:25.520]  This happened all over the country in swing states
[2:52:25.520 --> 2:52:29.520]  Like Michigan, like Pennsylvania, like Georgia, like Arizona
[2:52:29.520 --> 2:52:33.520]  You'd go to vote because they had all these mail-in ballots
[2:52:33.520 --> 2:52:35.520]  And you'd been told somebody already got your ballot
[2:52:35.520 --> 2:52:37.520]  Somebody already voted for you
[2:52:37.520 --> 2:52:39.520]  Like government and the corrupt postal service
[2:52:39.520 --> 2:52:42.520]  And the Democrat operatives, they've got all the key blue cities
[2:52:42.520 --> 2:52:46.520]  I mean, they're already sitting little kids to pedophile story time
[2:52:46.520 --> 2:52:49.520]  They're already busting all these Democrat judges being pedophiles
[2:52:49.520 --> 2:52:52.520]  They're already busting them lying and saying that the vaccine doesn't hurt you
[2:52:52.520 --> 2:52:54.520]  Or signing a vaccine, it does hurt you
[2:52:54.520 --> 2:52:56.520]  So of course, you go to try to vote
[2:52:56.520 --> 2:52:58.520]  Of course, everybody hates Newsom in the lockdowns
[2:52:58.520 --> 2:53:01.520]  And the fires and the homeless and the feces and the needles
[2:53:01.520 --> 2:53:04.520]  And the fentanyl and the oxy-cotton
[2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:06.520]  But they don't care
[2:53:06.520 --> 2:53:09.520]  It doesn't matter how much Rose McGowan gets up there and exposes the fraud
[2:53:09.520 --> 2:53:12.520]  It doesn't matter how much it comes out they're involved in all this sick sinister stuff
[2:53:12.520 --> 2:53:15.520]  Or Ed Buck and his Satanism rituals killing black people
[2:53:15.520 --> 2:53:17.520]  Now convicted
[2:53:17.520 --> 2:53:24.520]  Doesn't matter because he who counts the votes rules as Joseph Stalin said
[2:53:24.520 --> 2:53:29.520]  And so this is coming out from all over the place
[2:53:29.520 --> 2:53:33.520]  People are saying now that the polls are actually open
[2:53:33.520 --> 2:53:37.520]  Because you've got the recall election officially tomorrow so it opened
[2:53:37.520 --> 2:53:44.520]  Asher tells me what happened at the Woodland Hills polling station on Saturday
[2:53:44.520 --> 2:53:47.520]  The system showed that we had already voted
[2:53:47.520 --> 2:53:49.520]  And we were shocked
[2:53:49.520 --> 2:53:50.520]  She wondered who voted for it
[2:53:50.520 --> 2:53:53.520]  Well, and they voted, they voted for against the recall
[2:53:53.520 --> 2:53:54.520]  And they were going to vote for it
[2:53:54.520 --> 2:53:56.520]  We were like, well, we hadn't voted
[2:53:56.520 --> 2:53:59.520]  They apologized, it's okay
[2:53:59.520 --> 2:54:03.520]  So we're sorry we put all those books in the dozens of books in all the public schools
[2:54:03.520 --> 2:54:06.520]  For fourth and fifth graders about how fun it is to get in a car with a man
[2:54:06.520 --> 2:54:08.520]  When he wants you to get in it and have sex with him
[2:54:08.520 --> 2:54:10.520]  Probably a dead but it's okay
[2:54:10.520 --> 2:54:14.520]  They said this was happening to about 70% of those who showed up that day
[2:54:14.520 --> 2:54:16.520]  I'll read it again
[2:54:16.520 --> 2:54:20.520]  The system showed us when they voted on Saturday that we had already voted
[2:54:20.520 --> 2:54:21.520]  And we were shocked
[2:54:21.520 --> 2:54:23.520]  We were like, well, we hadn't voted
[2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:24.520]  They apologized
[2:54:24.520 --> 2:54:29.520]  They said this was happening to about 70% of those who showed up that day
[2:54:29.520 --> 2:54:32.520]  Because they already have the polling names
[2:54:32.520 --> 2:54:34.520]  They already had the mail-in ballots
[2:54:34.520 --> 2:54:36.520]  And they told you with Trump, there'll be a red mirage
[2:54:36.520 --> 2:54:37.520]  The polls will close
[2:54:37.520 --> 2:54:40.520]  But the next few days you'll find out he lost
[2:54:40.520 --> 2:54:42.520]  Pelosi said, no matter what happens, he'll be out
[2:54:42.520 --> 2:54:43.520]  Don't worry
[2:54:43.520 --> 2:54:45.520]  And just look at Gavin Newsom
[2:54:45.520 --> 2:54:49.520]  He looks like a rubber-faced alien in that photo
[2:54:49.520 --> 2:54:51.520]  He doesn't even look real
[2:54:51.520 --> 2:54:53.520]  He doesn't even make up to be the Joker
[2:54:53.520 --> 2:54:55.520]  You wouldn't buy a car from him
[2:54:55.520 --> 2:55:00.520]  I mean, look at Kamala Harris
[2:55:00.520 --> 2:55:02.520]  I mean, God help us
[2:55:02.520 --> 2:55:04.520]  Have you seen how psychotic he is in interviews?
[2:55:04.520 --> 2:55:06.520]  How fake?
[2:55:06.520 --> 2:55:08.520]  That's who God's put over us
[2:55:08.520 --> 2:55:10.520]  We haven't stopped him
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:11.520]  Here's the clip
[2:55:11.520 --> 2:55:13.520]  Of them stealing the election from Larry Elder
[2:55:13.520 --> 2:55:14.520]  Here it is
[2:55:14.520 --> 2:55:17.520]  Saturday, around noon, one o'clock
[2:55:17.520 --> 2:55:21.520]  We go to a voting center that we had gone to before
[2:55:21.520 --> 2:55:23.520]  That's our center
[2:55:23.520 --> 2:55:25.520]  And we walk up to the person
[2:55:25.520 --> 2:55:27.520]  And they look up our names
[2:55:27.520 --> 2:55:32.520]  And they tell us that the system showed that we had already voted
[2:55:32.520 --> 2:55:33.520]  And we were shocked
[2:55:33.520 --> 2:55:35.520]  We were like, well, we hadn't voted
[2:55:35.520 --> 2:55:36.520]  It wasn't us
[2:55:36.520 --> 2:55:37.520]  And they apologized
[2:55:37.520 --> 2:55:40.520]  They said, this is happening to about 70% of those
[2:55:40.520 --> 2:55:42.520]  Who had showed up that day
[2:55:42.520 --> 2:55:46.520]  And the gentleman and his wife came right behind us
[2:55:46.520 --> 2:55:48.520]  And the same thing was happening to them
[2:55:48.520 --> 2:55:50.520]  So I asked to speak with the supervisor
[2:55:50.520 --> 2:55:51.520]  I spoke with him
[2:55:51.520 --> 2:55:53.520]  And, again, he apologized
[2:55:53.520 --> 2:55:55.520]  He said, we don't know what's happening
[2:55:55.520 --> 2:55:56.520]  We've already reported it
[2:55:56.520 --> 2:56:00.520]  And it's happening to about 70% of those who have showed up
[2:56:00.520 --> 2:56:03.520]  I asked them, what are our options?
[2:56:03.520 --> 2:56:05.520]  He said, you can fill out a provisional ballot
[2:56:05.520 --> 2:56:06.520]  Mail it in
[2:56:06.520 --> 2:56:09.520]  And we can vote that way
[2:56:09.520 --> 2:56:10.520]  I'll share the letter as well
[2:56:10.520 --> 2:56:12.520]  And then I asked them, well, what's the process of that?
[2:56:12.520 --> 2:56:15.520]  How do we know, you know, that our vote will get casted
[2:56:15.520 --> 2:56:17.520]  And not the person who voted for us
[2:56:17.520 --> 2:56:19.520]  He said, once they receive your provisional
[2:56:19.520 --> 2:56:22.520]  They'll compare the signatures and whichever signatures is right
[2:56:22.520 --> 2:56:27.520]  They'll use that vote to count
[2:56:27.520 --> 2:56:30.520]  Only place in the country they've been checking them is Arizona
[2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:31.520]  And it takes forever
[2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:36.520]  All eyes, all pacifying, all stealing the election from you
[2:56:36.520 --> 2:56:38.520]  I'll do five more minutes until it's taken over
[2:56:38.520 --> 2:56:40.520]  Briefly, vitamin mineral fusion today
[2:56:40.520 --> 2:56:42.520]  All the vitamins, all the minerals from your insulin body

[2:56:51.520 --> 2:56:52.520]  Of your vitamin D particularly

[2:57:26.520 --> 2:57:55.520]  We'll be right back with us, hour number four, straight ahead.
[2:57:57.520 --> 2:57:59.520]  But the attack he's launched is being launched
[2:57:59.520 --> 2:58:02.520]  Against every other western country on the planet
[2:58:02.520 --> 2:58:03.520]  By these corporations
[2:58:03.520 --> 2:58:05.520]  That have already enslaved the third world
[2:58:05.520 --> 2:58:07.520]  What they're doing is illegal on its face
[2:58:07.520 --> 2:58:09.520]  Violates our federal and state laws
[2:58:09.520 --> 2:58:11.520]  And the Geneva Convention
[2:58:11.520 --> 2:58:13.520]  As well as the Nuremberg Code
[2:58:13.520 --> 2:58:14.520]  It's very, very simple
[2:58:14.520 --> 2:58:16.520]  We have to decide whether we're going to surrender
[2:58:16.520 --> 2:58:18.520]  To this globalist corporate takeover
[2:58:18.520 --> 2:58:20.520]  Or whether we're going to stand up with our birthright
[2:58:20.520 --> 2:58:21.520]  And say no
[2:58:21.520 --> 2:58:23.520]  And then prosecute these criminals
[2:58:23.520 --> 2:58:25.520]  For their crimes against humanity
[2:58:25.520 --> 2:58:27.520]  And criminals in the future don't dare try it
[2:58:27.520 --> 2:58:29.520]  The choice is up to us
[2:58:31.520 --> 2:58:34.520]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action
[2:58:34.520 --> 2:58:36.520]  And there is plenty to be afraid of today
[2:58:36.520 --> 2:58:40.520]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly
[2:58:40.520 --> 2:58:42.520]  And debilitating experimental injection
[2:58:42.520 --> 2:58:44.520]  Because they were told to be afraid
[2:58:44.520 --> 2:58:46.520]  Of an invisible asymptomatic disease
[2:58:46.520 --> 2:58:48.520]  The perpetrators of all this
[2:58:48.520 --> 2:58:49.520]  Have clearly stated their goal
[2:58:49.520 --> 2:58:51.520]  Of having 80% of the population
[2:58:51.520 --> 2:58:53.520]  Hooked up to an artificial intelligence
[2:58:53.520 --> 2:58:56.520]  Hive mind in less than nine years
[2:58:56.520 --> 2:58:58.520]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell
[2:58:58.520 --> 2:59:00.520]  We know this is all really happening
[2:59:00.520 --> 2:59:03.520]  And it's unbelievably unsettling to see
[2:59:03.520 --> 2:59:05.520]  But there's only two things to do
[2:59:05.520 --> 2:59:07.520]  We continue sounding the alarm
[2:59:07.520 --> 2:59:09.520]  Because it's a numbers game
[2:59:09.520 --> 2:59:11.520]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell
[2:59:11.520 --> 2:59:12.520]  Then we win
[2:59:12.520 --> 2:59:13.520]  But even when we win
[2:59:13.520 --> 2:59:15.520]  And we eventually will
[2:59:15.520 --> 2:59:17.520]  The days of convenience are soon coming to an end
[2:59:17.520 --> 2:59:19.520]  And so we must prepare
[2:59:19.520 --> 2:59:21.520]  Get up to a year's worth of storable foods
[2:59:21.520 --> 2:59:23.520]  Water filtration
[2:59:23.520 --> 2:59:24.520]  Survival gear
[2:59:24.520 --> 2:59:25.520]  Seeds
[2:59:25.520 --> 2:59:26.520]  Shortwave radios
[2:59:26.520 --> 2:59:28.520]  And lifesaving knowledge
[2:59:28.520 --> 2:59:53.520]  Well, Sonia Swaminathan
[2:59:53.520 --> 2:59:57.520]  Is facing the death penalty in India
[2:59:57.520 --> 2:59:59.520]  If their National Bar Association
[2:59:59.520 --> 3:00:01.520]  Has its way
[3:00:01.520 --> 3:00:03.520]  It was seven, eight months ago
[3:00:03.520 --> 3:00:05.520]  That the lawyers of India got together
[3:00:05.520 --> 3:00:07.520]  And they sued the government
[3:00:07.520 --> 3:00:09.520]  That were blocking Ivermectin
[3:00:09.520 --> 3:00:10.520]  And if you look at the graph
[3:00:10.520 --> 3:00:11.520]  As soon as the public
[3:00:11.520 --> 3:00:12.520]  They handed out to everybody in the country
[3:00:12.520 --> 3:00:13.520]  Over a million people
[3:00:13.520 --> 3:00:15.520]  A packet of Ivermectin
[3:00:15.520 --> 3:00:18.520]  Their death rate went down over 90%
[3:00:18.520 --> 3:00:19.520]  There it is, Forbes
[3:00:19.520 --> 3:00:21.520]  India's state will offer Ivermectin
[3:00:21.520 --> 3:00:23.520]  To an entire adult population
[3:00:23.520 --> 3:00:25.520]  Even as WHO warns against its use
[3:00:25.520 --> 3:00:27.520]  Of COVID-19 treatment
[3:00:27.520 --> 3:00:29.520]  Print me that, that's big
[3:00:29.520 --> 3:00:31.520]  So, they're saying
[3:00:31.520 --> 3:00:33.520]  She committed crimes against humanity
[3:00:33.520 --> 3:00:35.520]  She knows about the hundreds of studies
[3:00:35.520 --> 3:00:37.520]  That's what it is when the U.S. government does that
[3:00:37.520 --> 3:00:39.520]  That's what, I mean, that's what it is
[3:00:39.520 --> 3:00:41.520]  When our
[3:00:41.520 --> 3:00:43.520]  Surgeon General says, you know
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:45.520]  Keep it, people
[3:00:45.520 --> 3:00:47.520]  When Australia does it, they're killing you
[3:00:47.520 --> 3:00:49.520]  They know the truth
[3:00:49.520 --> 3:00:51.520]  They're trying to make sure you die
[3:00:51.520 --> 3:00:53.520]  There she is
[3:00:53.520 --> 3:00:55.520]  WHO scientists may face death penalty
[3:00:55.520 --> 3:00:58.520]  For advising against Ivermectin
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:00.520]  Deleting the tweet won't save her
[3:01:00.520 --> 3:01:02.520]  That she went and got it banned
[3:01:02.520 --> 3:01:03.520]  But they overwrote her
[3:01:03.520 --> 3:01:04.520]  The 51-page legal statement
[3:01:04.520 --> 3:01:06.520]  Prepared by the Indian Bar Association
[3:01:06.520 --> 3:01:08.520]  Attacked WHO chief scientist
[3:01:08.520 --> 3:01:11.520]  With 71 counts describing
[3:01:11.520 --> 3:01:13.520]  The evaluation she made
[3:01:13.520 --> 3:01:15.520]  Discouraging Ivermectin to treat
[3:01:15.520 --> 3:01:17.520]  COVID-19 as extremely unreasonable
[3:01:17.520 --> 3:01:19.520]  And having other purposes
[3:01:19.520 --> 3:01:21.520]  Yeah, absolutely
[3:01:21.520 --> 3:01:23.520]  Emails who gave her the order, you know it's Fauci and Gates
[3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:25.520]  The association, Gates has kicked out of
[3:01:25.520 --> 3:01:27.520]  There, by the way, as Dab has kicked out
[3:01:27.520 --> 3:01:29.520]  Testing all sorts of stuff on kids
[3:01:29.520 --> 3:01:31.520]  You're some real sickos
[3:01:31.520 --> 3:01:33.520]  The association called, they get power
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:35.520]  Off of it because they really want to hurt the life force
[3:01:35.520 --> 3:01:37.520]  The association called to invoke
[3:01:37.520 --> 3:01:39.520]  Article 302-304
[3:01:39.520 --> 3:01:41.520]  Paragraph 2 and 88 of the Indian penal code
[3:01:41.520 --> 3:01:43.520]  Regarding murder and other claims
[3:01:43.520 --> 3:01:45.520]  Punishable
[3:01:45.520 --> 3:01:47.520]  By these, how do you say her name again
[3:01:47.520 --> 3:01:49.520]  Swanna
[3:01:49.520 --> 3:01:51.520]  And it says that if she's convicted
[3:01:51.520 --> 3:01:53.520]  She may face the death penalty
[3:01:53.520 --> 3:01:55.520]  Or life imprisonment
[3:01:55.520 --> 3:01:57.520]  And it goes on there
[3:01:57.520 --> 3:01:59.520]  Ivermectin was first developed
[3:01:59.520 --> 3:02:01.520]  As a veterinary drug in the 1970s
[3:02:01.520 --> 3:02:03.520]  However, since 1988
[3:02:03.520 --> 3:02:05.520]  It has been prescribed for humans
[3:02:05.520 --> 3:02:07.520]  To combat various parasitic infections
[3:02:07.520 --> 3:02:09.520]  Was later added to the WHO's list
[3:02:09.520 --> 3:02:11.520]  Of essential medications
[3:02:11.520 --> 3:02:13.520]  In 2015, Ivermectin was awarded
[3:02:13.520 --> 3:02:15.520]  The Nobel Prize in medicine
[3:02:15.520 --> 3:02:17.520]  And all I know is
[3:02:17.520 --> 3:02:19.520]  I've had a lot of my crew
[3:02:19.520 --> 3:02:21.520]  That's been sick
[3:02:21.520 --> 3:02:23.520]  My dad
[3:02:23.520 --> 3:02:25.520]  It was like 82-83%
[3:02:25.520 --> 3:02:27.520]  Oxygen, they're innovating for sure
[3:02:27.520 --> 3:02:29.520]  Got him on Ivermectin, got him on inhalable steroids
[3:02:29.520 --> 3:02:31.520]  That Dr. Bartlett got us through
[3:02:31.520 --> 3:02:33.520]  Local doctors that came and saw my dad
[3:02:33.520 --> 3:02:35.520]  At the house
[3:02:35.520 --> 3:02:37.520]  And those folks were, by the way,
[3:02:37.520 --> 3:02:39.520]  Indian, great people, big listeners
[3:02:39.520 --> 3:02:41.520]  And so, we beat it
[3:02:41.520 --> 3:02:43.520]  But I mean, he'd been dead
[3:02:43.520 --> 3:02:45.520]  So, absolutely, these people are trying to murder us
[3:02:45.520 --> 3:02:47.520]  And now the Australian government
[3:02:47.520 --> 3:02:49.520]  Is banning their public
[3:02:49.520 --> 3:02:51.520]  From having or having it produced or given
[3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:53.520]  What a pack of murderers, if your dad or mom
[3:02:53.520 --> 3:02:55.520]  Or your son or daughter is dying
[3:02:55.520 --> 3:02:57.520]  They want to innovate them
[3:02:57.520 --> 3:02:59.520]  What are they going to do to you? I'm not saying do this
[3:02:59.520 --> 3:03:01.520]  If you ram your truck through the pharmacy at night
[3:03:01.520 --> 3:03:03.520]  And steal that Ivermectin
[3:03:03.520 --> 3:03:05.520]  I mean, these people are really pushing us into a corner
[3:03:05.520 --> 3:03:07.520]  And they think we're just going to blow up in our governments
[3:03:07.520 --> 3:03:09.520]  And then that'll destroy the government
[3:03:09.520 --> 3:03:11.520]  And then they'll come in and buy everything up
[3:03:11.520 --> 3:03:13.520]  That's what the IMF plan
[3:03:13.520 --> 3:03:15.520]  We need to have the globalists exposed
[3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:17.520]  And we need to have good people come up
[3:03:17.520 --> 3:03:19.520]  Like Rand Paul and the folks in India
[3:03:19.520 --> 3:03:21.520]  And say, arrest Fauci, arrest Gates
[3:03:21.520 --> 3:03:23.520]  Arrest all these people
[3:03:23.520 --> 3:03:25.520]  Arrest the head
[3:03:25.520 --> 3:03:27.520]  Surgeon general lying to everybody
[3:03:27.520 --> 3:03:29.520]  These are doctors lying
[3:03:29.520 --> 3:03:31.520]  For a big pharma to take control of you
[3:03:31.520 --> 3:03:33.520]  And kill you
[3:03:33.520 --> 3:03:35.520]  And bring in a world government
[3:03:35.520 --> 3:03:37.520]  And people see it
[3:03:37.520 --> 3:03:39.520]  You have the main doctor association
[3:03:39.520 --> 3:03:41.520]  The union of medical doctors
[3:03:41.520 --> 3:03:43.520]  In Tokyo
[3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:45.520]  Biggest city arguably in the world
[3:03:45.520 --> 3:03:47.520]  Saying they're going over 10,000 people
[3:03:47.520 --> 3:03:49.520]  With a 99% success rate
[3:03:49.520 --> 3:03:51.520]  They are suppressing
[3:03:51.520 --> 3:03:53.520]  They are attacking us
[3:03:53.520 --> 3:03:55.520]  They don't want you to have vitamins, minerals
[3:03:55.520 --> 3:03:57.520]  They don't want you to have vitamin D3
[3:03:57.520 --> 3:03:59.520]  They don't want you to have free speech
[3:03:59.520 --> 3:04:01.520]  Like Ernest Ramirez Jr. who they killed
[3:04:01.520 --> 3:04:03.520]  So his daddy can't speak up
[3:04:03.520 --> 3:04:05.520]  But they are speaking up and they are fighting back
[3:04:05.520 --> 3:04:07.520]  And we're not backing down and you're fighting hard
[3:04:07.520 --> 3:04:09.520]  You're going to take the archive of this show
[3:04:09.520 --> 3:04:11.520]  And your text message, your word of mouth
[3:04:11.520 --> 3:04:13.520]  And you're going to share it, you're going to take the best interviews
[3:04:13.520 --> 3:04:15.520]  And the best articles you think are most important
[3:04:15.520 --> 3:04:17.520]  Because you're in charge of the fight in your area
[3:04:17.520 --> 3:04:19.520]  And you're going to spread that information
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:21.520]  And shove it down the throat of these globalists politically
[3:04:21.520 --> 3:04:23.520]  They want a war
[3:04:23.520 --> 3:04:25.520]  They started one, they want a fight
[3:04:25.520 --> 3:04:27.520]  I don't know how this is going to end because God's watching
[3:04:27.520 --> 3:04:29.520]  All I know is I'm going to do what God tells me to do
[3:04:29.520 --> 3:04:31.520]  I'm going to stand up to these monsters
[3:04:31.520 --> 3:04:33.520]  And they will be brought to justice
[3:04:33.520 --> 3:04:35.520]  They've been off a lot more than they can chew
[3:04:35.520 --> 3:04:37.520]  Oram comes up in 55 minutes
[3:04:37.520 --> 3:04:39.520]  Next, tune in, spread the word, fight back
[3:05:07.520 --> 3:05:09.520]  And the best sales we'll continue through next week

[3:06:07.520 --> 3:06:09.520]  2020, everything changed
[3:06:09.520 --> 3:06:11.520]  Who to believe this
[3:06:11.520 --> 3:06:13.520]  So, I just had a great
[3:06:13.520 --> 3:06:15.520]  Experience of my life
[3:06:15.520 --> 3:06:17.520]  I was on with
[3:06:17.520 --> 3:06:19.520]  Down in DC
[3:06:19.520 --> 3:06:21.520]  And I was one of the guest speakers
[3:06:21.520 --> 3:06:23.520]  At Ron Paul's
[3:06:23.520 --> 3:06:25.520]  War on Us
[3:06:25.520 --> 3:06:27.520]  Event
[3:06:27.520 --> 3:06:29.520]  On September 4th
[3:06:29.520 --> 3:06:31.520]  We could go Saturday
[3:06:31.520 --> 3:06:33.520]  We could go Saturday
[3:06:33.520 --> 3:06:35.520]  And
[3:06:35.520 --> 3:06:37.520]  It sold out
[3:06:37.520 --> 3:06:39.520]  Over
[3:06:39.520 --> 3:06:41.520]  500 people were there
[3:06:41.520 --> 3:06:43.520]  They had to move it
[3:06:43.520 --> 3:06:45.520]  From a hotel they had in DC
[3:06:45.520 --> 3:06:47.520]  To one of Dulles Airport
[3:06:47.520 --> 3:06:49.520]  Because the government took it over
[3:06:49.520 --> 3:06:51.520]  So they could bring in refugees
[3:06:51.520 --> 3:06:53.520]  At Afghanistan
[3:06:53.520 --> 3:06:55.520]  And boy Daniel McAdams
[3:06:55.520 --> 3:06:57.520]  Who works with
[3:06:57.520 --> 3:06:59.520]  On the Liberty Report
[3:06:59.520 --> 3:07:01.520]  With Ron Paul
[3:07:01.520 --> 3:07:03.520]  He had a great job
[3:07:03.520 --> 3:07:05.520]  In pulling this thing together
[3:07:05.520 --> 3:07:07.520]  Great speakers
[3:07:07.520 --> 3:07:09.520]  Dr
[3:07:09.520 --> 3:07:11.520]  Judge
[3:07:11.520 --> 3:07:13.520]  Andrew Napolitano was one of them
[3:07:13.520 --> 3:07:15.520]  I was one of them
[3:07:15.520 --> 3:07:17.520]  RFK Junior
[3:07:17.520 --> 3:07:19.520]  And others
[3:07:19.520 --> 3:07:21.520]  And standing ovations
[3:07:21.520 --> 3:07:23.520]  For everyone
[3:07:23.520 --> 3:07:25.520]  It was really very touching
[3:07:27.520 --> 3:07:29.520]  And when RFK Junior walked off the stage
[3:07:29.520 --> 3:07:31.520]  His last words were
[3:07:31.520 --> 3:07:33.520]  I will fight
[3:07:33.520 --> 3:07:35.520]  For my fight
[3:07:35.520 --> 3:07:37.520]  To my death with my boots on
[3:07:39.520 --> 3:07:41.520]  Talking about freedom, peace and justice
[3:07:43.520 --> 3:07:45.520]  It was very heartwarming
[3:07:47.520 --> 3:07:49.520]  And I had them crying
[3:07:49.520 --> 3:07:51.520]  And laughing
[3:07:51.520 --> 3:07:53.520]  Because my heart is broken
[3:07:53.520 --> 3:07:55.520]  So they know my tears are real
[3:07:55.520 --> 3:07:57.520]  When I talk about what's going on
[3:07:57.520 --> 3:07:59.520]  And of course
[3:07:59.520 --> 3:08:01.520]  A couple of days later on Thursday
[3:08:01.520 --> 3:08:03.520]  Joe Biden
[3:08:03.520 --> 3:08:05.520]  Our
[3:08:05.520 --> 3:08:07.520]  Tyrant
[3:08:07.520 --> 3:08:09.520]  Who is running the show
[3:08:09.520 --> 3:08:11.520]  The freak show, the presidential reality show
[3:08:11.520 --> 3:08:13.520]  Pushed in these mandates
[3:08:15.520 --> 3:08:17.520]  Government workers have to get
[3:08:17.520 --> 3:08:19.520]  Vaccinated
[3:08:19.520 --> 3:08:21.520]  This is unprecedented
[3:08:21.520 --> 3:08:23.520]  And contractors
[3:08:23.520 --> 3:08:25.520]  But
[3:08:25.520 --> 3:08:27.520]  Doesn't have to get vaccinated
[3:08:27.520 --> 3:08:29.520]  That's right, members of congress
[3:08:29.520 --> 3:08:31.520]  Oh no, they're above us
[3:08:31.520 --> 3:08:33.520]  We's just the plantation workers
[3:08:33.520 --> 3:08:35.520]  On slave landia
[3:08:35.520 --> 3:08:37.520]  So we got to get vaccinated
[3:08:39.520 --> 3:08:41.520]  And people who work for the
[3:08:41.520 --> 3:08:43.520]  You know, the courts, the federal courts
[3:08:43.520 --> 3:08:45.520]  They don't have to get vaccinated
[3:08:45.520 --> 3:08:47.520]  No, it's fine
[3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:49.520]  You're just a piece of crap
[3:08:49.520 --> 3:08:51.520]  You're just a low life American nothing
[3:08:51.520 --> 3:08:53.520]  It's a complete takeover
[3:08:53.520 --> 3:08:55.520]  And it's global
[3:08:55.520 --> 3:08:57.520]  What's going on
[3:08:57.520 --> 3:08:59.520]  And I realized
[3:08:59.520 --> 3:09:01.520]  On the way back
[3:09:01.520 --> 3:09:03.520]  My buddy and I
[3:09:03.520 --> 3:09:05.520]  We stopped at Cape May
[3:09:05.520 --> 3:09:07.520]  In New Jersey
[3:09:07.520 --> 3:09:09.520]  Took the ferry
[3:09:09.520 --> 3:09:11.520]  Delaware
[3:09:11.520 --> 3:09:13.520]  With little Joe Biden
[3:09:13.520 --> 3:09:15.520]  The guy's been sucking off the public
[3:09:15.520 --> 3:09:17.520]  To his whole life
[3:09:17.520 --> 3:09:19.520]  This little arrogant boy
[3:09:19.520 --> 3:09:21.520]  This imbecilic arrogant boy
[3:09:21.520 --> 3:09:23.520]  With his arrogant
[3:09:23.520 --> 3:09:25.520]  Freaked out son
[3:09:25.520 --> 3:09:27.520]  Yeah, we left him Delaware
[3:09:29.520 --> 3:09:31.520]  Oh, White House clarifies
[3:09:31.520 --> 3:09:33.520]  Yeah, U.S.
[3:09:33.520 --> 3:09:35.520]  Napoleon
[3:09:35.520 --> 3:09:37.520]  They'd be subject to vaccines, yeah
[3:09:37.520 --> 3:09:39.520]  But not, of course, the
[3:09:39.520 --> 3:09:41.520]  Clowns
[3:09:41.520 --> 3:09:43.520]  So we left Delaware, took the ferry
[3:09:43.520 --> 3:09:45.520]  Over to Cape May
[3:09:45.520 --> 3:09:47.520]  You go into Cape May driving in
[3:09:47.520 --> 3:09:49.520]  And there's a sign
[3:09:49.520 --> 3:09:51.520]  You take this boat to go whale watching
[3:09:53.520 --> 3:09:55.520]  You didn't have to take the boat to go whale watching
[3:09:57.520 --> 3:09:59.520]  All you had to do was walk around the beach
[3:09:59.520 --> 3:10:01.520]  Walk around the boardwalk
[3:10:01.520 --> 3:10:03.520]  Walk around town
[3:10:03.520 --> 3:10:05.520]  And you could see whales everywhere
[3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:07.520]  Guys like this
[3:10:07.520 --> 3:10:09.520]  Women and young girls like this
[3:10:09.520 --> 3:10:11.520]  Heartbreaking
[3:10:11.520 --> 3:10:13.520]  Heartbreak
[3:10:13.520 --> 3:10:15.520]  To see how low the Americans
[3:10:15.520 --> 3:10:17.520]  Have gone
[3:10:17.520 --> 3:10:19.520]  There's no fight
[3:10:21.520 --> 3:10:23.520]  How could you be happy
[3:10:23.520 --> 3:10:25.520]  How could you be happy
[3:10:25.520 --> 3:10:27.520]  With yourself
[3:10:27.520 --> 3:10:29.520]  Being 30, 40, 50
[3:10:29.520 --> 3:10:31.520]  Pounds overweight
[3:10:31.520 --> 3:10:33.520]  The whales were everywhere
[3:10:39.520 --> 3:10:41.520]  There's no fight in this country
[3:10:41.520 --> 3:10:43.520]  The people who lost their self-respect
[3:10:43.520 --> 3:10:45.520]  I have a picture
[3:10:45.520 --> 3:10:47.520]  In my Zizi book over here
[3:10:47.520 --> 3:10:49.520]  With Zizi gave Honey Boy
[3:10:49.520 --> 3:10:51.520]  A true story about love, wisdom
[3:10:51.520 --> 3:10:53.520]  And the soul of America
[3:10:53.520 --> 3:10:55.520]  And here's a
[3:10:55.520 --> 3:10:57.520]  Picture
[3:10:57.520 --> 3:10:59.520]  Of my parents' wedding
[3:10:59.520 --> 3:11:01.520]  May they rest in peace
[3:11:01.520 --> 3:11:03.520]  1934
[3:11:03.520 --> 3:11:05.520]  Look at the
[3:11:05.520 --> 3:11:07.520]  Dignity of these people
[3:11:07.520 --> 3:11:09.520]  Look what they look like
[3:11:09.520 --> 3:11:11.520]  They were laborers
[3:11:11.520 --> 3:11:13.520]  Or construction
[3:11:15.520 --> 3:11:17.520]  Worked in fish store
[3:11:17.520 --> 3:11:19.520]  Manufacturing plant
[3:11:21.520 --> 3:11:23.520]  You look at the dignity of these people
[3:11:23.520 --> 3:11:25.520]  Bezos
[3:11:25.520 --> 3:11:27.520]  Buffet
[3:11:27.520 --> 3:11:29.520]  Gates
[3:11:29.520 --> 3:11:31.520]  Musk
[3:11:31.520 --> 3:11:33.520]  Couldn't even come close
[3:11:35.520 --> 3:11:37.520]  That's when there was a pride in America
[3:11:37.520 --> 3:11:39.520]  And then you know
[3:11:39.520 --> 3:11:41.520]  I was in the business
[3:11:41.520 --> 3:11:43.520]  I used to work for a major trade association
[3:11:43.520 --> 3:11:45.520]  I was the number two guy when I left at 32 years old
[3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:47.520]  And I was traveling all over the country
[3:11:47.520 --> 3:11:49.520]  I could tell you when it changed
[3:11:49.520 --> 3:11:51.520]  I remember TGIF
[3:11:51.520 --> 3:11:53.520]  TGIF was only in New York City
[3:11:53.520 --> 3:11:55.520]  Around
[3:11:55.520 --> 3:11:57.520]  30-something street on the east side
[3:11:59.520 --> 3:12:01.520]  And
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:03.520]  40-something
[3:12:03.520 --> 3:12:05.520]  Maybe around anyway
[3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:07.520]  And then it went national
[3:12:07.520 --> 3:12:09.520]  And the big thing was
[3:12:09.520 --> 3:12:11.520]  How big the portions were
[3:12:11.520 --> 3:12:13.520]  That's right
[3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:15.520]  Eat a lot of crappy food for cheap
[3:12:15.520 --> 3:12:17.520]  I remember
[3:12:17.520 --> 3:12:19.520]  When they wouldn't allow McDonald's
[3:12:19.520 --> 3:12:21.520]  Into New York City in the 70s
[3:12:21.520 --> 3:12:23.520]  That's right
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:25.520]  And now
[3:12:25.520 --> 3:12:27.520]  I forgot
[3:12:27.520 --> 3:12:29.520]  To bring something with me
[3:12:29.520 --> 3:12:31.520]  When I went and had to go to Walmart
[3:12:31.520 --> 3:12:33.520]  To get it
[3:12:33.520 --> 3:12:35.520]  According to my computer
[3:12:35.520 --> 3:12:37.520]  First time I've been to Walmart
[3:12:37.520 --> 3:12:39.520]  In 20 years
[3:12:39.520 --> 3:12:41.520]  I stay away from it
[3:12:43.520 --> 3:12:45.520]  Back in the day
[3:12:45.520 --> 3:12:47.520]  You went into places
[3:12:47.520 --> 3:12:49.520]  Department stores
[3:12:49.520 --> 3:12:51.520]  And they were beautiful
[3:12:51.520 --> 3:12:53.520]  They were decorated
[3:12:53.520 --> 3:12:55.520]  That's America
[3:12:55.520 --> 3:12:57.520]  They didn't have those things to ride in
[3:12:57.520 --> 3:12:59.520]  When you go into stores
[3:12:59.520 --> 3:13:01.520]  Again
[3:13:01.520 --> 3:13:03.520]  It's everywhere
[3:13:03.520 --> 3:13:05.520]  In only 78% of the people
[3:13:05.520 --> 3:13:07.520]  Dying of COVID according to the CDC
[3:13:07.520 --> 3:13:09.520]  78%
[3:13:09.520 --> 3:13:11.520]  Are obese
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:13.520]  Type 2 Diabetics
[3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:15.520]  According to the numbers
[3:13:15.520 --> 3:13:17.520]  That was even reported
[3:13:17.520 --> 3:13:19.520]  In
[3:13:19.520 --> 3:13:21.520]  CNBC
[3:13:21.520 --> 3:13:23.520]  So it's not a conspiracy theory
[3:13:25.520 --> 3:13:27.520]  You go into Walmart
[3:13:27.520 --> 3:13:29.520]  And it's ugly as hell
[3:13:29.520 --> 3:13:31.520]  Look at the people around
[3:13:31.520 --> 3:13:33.520]  It
[3:13:33.520 --> 3:13:35.520]  You know
[3:13:35.520 --> 3:13:37.520]  It's heartbreaking
[3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:39.520]  Going into a warehouse
[3:13:39.520 --> 3:13:41.520]  A factory to buy stuff
[3:13:41.520 --> 3:13:43.520]  The spirit is gone
[3:13:43.520 --> 3:13:45.520]  In this country
[3:13:45.520 --> 3:13:47.520]  My talk at Ron Paul's
[3:13:47.520 --> 3:13:49.520]  And
[3:13:49.520 --> 3:13:51.520]  Daniel McAdams' event
[3:13:51.520 --> 3:13:53.520]  And there's no man alive, by the way
[3:13:53.520 --> 3:13:55.520]  I respect more than Dr. Ron Paul
[3:13:55.520 --> 3:14:01.520]  Just to make it clear
[3:14:01.520 --> 3:14:03.520]  Well, as we must unite
[3:14:03.520 --> 3:14:05.520]  United we stand, divided we fall
[3:14:05.520 --> 3:14:07.520]  We have to unite on the one
[3:14:07.520 --> 3:14:09.520]  Umbrella to defeat this
[3:14:09.520 --> 3:14:11.520]  Those people that you just showed
[3:14:11.520 --> 3:14:13.520]  They're not in the fight
[3:14:13.520 --> 3:14:15.520]  They're in a fight for their lives
[3:14:19.520 --> 3:14:21.520]  We must unite
[3:14:21.520 --> 3:14:23.520]  And
[3:14:23.520 --> 3:14:25.520]  We have to do it on the one umbrella
[3:14:27.520 --> 3:14:29.520]  I formed
[3:14:29.520 --> 3:14:31.520]  The Universal Church of Freedom, Peace and Justice
[3:14:31.520 --> 3:14:33.520]  That may be one way
[3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:35.520]  We're going to be working on it more
[3:14:35.520 --> 3:14:37.520]  The rallies
[3:14:37.520 --> 3:14:39.520]  The protests, they mean nothing
[3:14:41.520 --> 3:14:43.520]  Nothing
[3:14:45.520 --> 3:14:47.520]  It has to go on day after day
[3:14:47.520 --> 3:14:49.520]  Night after night, week after week
[3:14:49.520 --> 3:14:51.520]  Like the Berlin Wall came down
[3:14:53.520 --> 3:14:55.520]  Because if we don't stop this
[3:14:55.520 --> 3:14:57.520]  This is going to be hell on earth
[3:14:59.520 --> 3:15:01.520]  More mandates
[3:15:01.520 --> 3:15:03.520]  More push vaccines
[3:15:03.520 --> 3:15:05.520]  More taking control of your life
[3:15:07.520 --> 3:15:09.520]  That's not what this country is about
[3:15:11.520 --> 3:15:13.520]  If we don't change it now
[3:15:13.520 --> 3:15:19.520]  It's going to be too late tomorrow
[3:15:19.520 --> 3:15:21.520]  My heart's broken
[3:15:21.520 --> 3:15:23.520]  When I see what's going on
[3:15:23.520 --> 3:15:25.520]  But I'm fighting for peace
[3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:27.520]  Freedom and justice
[3:15:27.520 --> 3:15:29.520]  And so is info wars

[3:16:09.240 --> 3:16:11.500]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy
[3:16:11.500 --> 3:16:13.240]  in a crazy COVID culture?
[3:16:13.240 --> 3:16:15.840]  Me too, but listen, after all the research,
[3:16:15.840 --> 3:16:18.360]  all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[3:16:18.360 --> 3:16:21.100]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[3:16:21.100 --> 3:16:23.560]  It's that immune system health can literally be
[3:16:23.560 --> 3:16:25.480]  the difference between life and death.
[3:16:25.480 --> 3:16:28.400]  You probably already believe that, I certainly do.
[3:16:28.400 --> 3:16:29.360]  So here's the thing.
[3:16:29.360 --> 3:16:30.920]  I wanted to get past the craziness
[3:16:30.920 --> 3:16:33.520]  and find out which plant-based substances
[3:16:33.520 --> 3:16:35.640]  actually have studies that demonstrate
[3:16:35.640 --> 3:16:38.200]  some efficacy in immune support.
[3:16:38.200 --> 3:16:39.800]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver,
[3:16:39.800 --> 3:16:41.540]  but you can check out what I've discovered
[3:16:41.540 --> 3:16:43.640]  at StrongerDefense.com.
[3:16:43.640 --> 3:16:44.960]  No cures or treatments there.

[3:17:09.000 --> 3:17:10.200]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:17:10.200 --> 3:17:12.320]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[3:17:12.320 --> 3:17:14.120]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:17:14.120 --> 3:17:15.660]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:17:15.660 --> 3:17:18.600]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:18.600 --> 3:17:20.300]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[3:17:20.300 --> 3:17:22.520]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[3:17:22.520 --> 3:17:24.120]  they thought might never be solved.
[3:17:24.120 --> 3:17:25.320]  I can help you too.
[3:17:25.320 --> 3:17:26.920]  If you owe taxes, you can't pay.
[3:17:26.920 --> 3:17:28.280]  Don't wait another day.
[3:17:28.280 --> 3:17:30.480]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[3:17:39.400 --> 3:17:42.260]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[3:17:42.260 --> 3:17:45.240]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[3:17:45.240 --> 3:17:48.280]  Monday at midnight, we've got to end this sale.
[3:17:48.280 --> 3:17:50.760]  We may end it earlier, because we think it'll sell out
[3:17:50.760 --> 3:17:52.560]  by then at current sales rates.
[3:17:52.560 --> 3:17:54.520]  Vitamin mineral fusion's super popular.

[3:18:39.680 --> 3:18:42.120]  What was the most important point
[3:18:42.120 --> 3:18:45.600]  in Joe Biden's declaration of war against America
[3:18:45.600 --> 3:18:48.680]  on Thursday, September 9, 2021?
[3:18:48.680 --> 3:18:51.880]  Was it the announcement of forced inoculations
[3:18:51.880 --> 3:18:53.400]  of 80 to 100 million Americans?
[3:18:53.400 --> 3:18:55.760]  Was it the announcement of federalization
[3:18:55.760 --> 3:18:59.240]  of all the major cities, the bypassing of state governors
[3:18:59.240 --> 3:19:01.840]  to threat to basically remove them?
[3:19:01.840 --> 3:19:02.680]  No, it wasn't.
[3:19:02.680 --> 3:19:04.600]  That was all bad enough.
[3:19:04.600 --> 3:19:07.040]  It's the fact that he's following a UN
[3:19:07.040 --> 3:19:10.480]  globalist-grade reset blueprint that Australia,
[3:19:10.480 --> 3:19:13.280]  the UK, Europe, and the rest of the Western world is,
[3:19:13.280 --> 3:19:15.640]  and that this is just the beginning.
[3:19:15.640 --> 3:19:18.920]  More lockdowns, national medical IDs approved
[3:19:18.920 --> 3:19:20.640]  by the United Nations.
[3:19:20.640 --> 3:19:23.960]  Carbon taxes that don't just track and trace you and tax you,
[3:19:23.960 --> 3:19:25.880]  but actually tell you when you can go somewhere
[3:19:25.880 --> 3:19:26.960]  and what you can do.
[3:19:26.960 --> 3:19:29.520]  It's all been announced at the UN level.
[3:19:29.520 --> 3:19:32.400]  This is a UN world government takeover,
[3:19:32.400 --> 3:19:35.640]  corporate revolution through global governance.
[3:19:35.640 --> 3:19:38.920]  It's illegal, and Congress must stand up and stop it now.
[3:19:38.920 --> 3:19:50.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:19:50.440 --> 3:20:07.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:20:07.600 --> 3:20:12.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Salente.
[3:20:15.800 --> 3:20:19.120]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:19.120 --> 3:20:20.960]  Yeah, this is the cover of the toilet paper
[3:20:20.960 --> 3:20:24.760]  record in the New York Times yesterday.
[3:20:24.760 --> 3:20:30.760]  False diagnoses conceal drugging of frail seniors.
[3:20:30.760 --> 3:20:37.920]  One in five nursing homes get anti-psychotics far more
[3:20:37.920 --> 3:20:40.560]  than publicly reported.
[3:20:40.560 --> 3:20:42.200]  I'm mentioning this because they're
[3:20:42.200 --> 3:20:44.720]  drugging out the people.
[3:20:44.720 --> 3:20:47.840]  You turn on the TV, which I rarely do,
[3:20:47.840 --> 3:20:50.880]  but when I was away in a hotel listening to it,
[3:20:50.880 --> 3:20:57.640]  and it's one drug ad after another, one after another.
[3:20:57.640 --> 3:20:59.280]  And then they tell you the side effects,
[3:20:59.280 --> 3:21:02.720]  and you're saying, why would anybody take this stuff?
[3:21:02.720 --> 3:21:08.800]  The reason is that people believe what they see on TV.
[3:21:11.920 --> 3:21:17.560]  It's very, very sad, and I'm not making this up.
[3:21:17.560 --> 3:21:20.520]  American people don't believe anything's
[3:21:20.520 --> 3:21:26.280]  real until they see it on TV.
[3:21:26.280 --> 3:21:30.760]  Richard Nixon, a low-life murderous piece of crap
[3:21:30.760 --> 3:21:34.000]  that knew the story.
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:38.160]  So when you watch these drug ads, it's simple.
[3:21:38.160 --> 3:21:41.840]  It's propaganda that they've been using for centuries
[3:21:41.840 --> 3:21:44.240]  on how to control people.
[3:21:44.240 --> 3:21:48.200]  Now with TV, it's been going on forever.
[3:21:48.200 --> 3:21:53.040]  But now, it's easier because people tune in.
[3:21:53.040 --> 3:21:55.160]  American people don't believe anything's
[3:21:55.160 --> 3:21:58.400]  real until they see it on TV.
[3:21:58.400 --> 3:22:04.160]  So how stupid can you be to listen to a little daddy's girl,
[3:22:04.160 --> 3:22:08.560]  Anderson Cooper, on CNN, the Cartoon News Network, whose
[3:22:08.560 --> 3:22:10.960]  mommy was Gloria Vanda built, and you're just
[3:22:10.960 --> 3:22:13.160]  another little arrogant boy who wouldn't
[3:22:13.160 --> 3:22:16.480]  be there if mommy didn't get you there with all your money?
[3:22:16.480 --> 3:22:21.040]  So save your crap, little boy.
[3:22:21.040 --> 3:22:23.520]  Oh, now we got a little Andy Cuomo's,
[3:22:23.520 --> 3:22:30.600]  Radha, Chris C, another daddy's boy on CNN.
[3:22:30.600 --> 3:22:32.600]  American people don't believe anything's
[3:22:32.600 --> 3:22:35.440]  real until they see it on TV, being
[3:22:35.440 --> 3:22:38.400]  spewed out by low-life prostitutes who
[3:22:38.400 --> 3:22:42.400]  get paid to put out by their corporate pimps
[3:22:42.400 --> 3:22:46.320]  in their Washington warmast.
[3:22:46.320 --> 3:22:49.440]  Pfizer paid the largest criminal fine in US history
[3:22:49.440 --> 3:22:51.200]  lawsuit details.
[3:22:51.200 --> 3:22:54.320]  This is her market realist, August 26th.
[3:22:54.320 --> 3:22:57.560]  Getting full approval from the FDA for its COVID-19 vaccine
[3:22:57.560 --> 3:22:59.560]  is a big deal for Pfizer.
[3:22:59.560 --> 3:23:02.520]  The FDA stamped on approval is a critical step
[3:23:02.520 --> 3:23:04.720]  in getting a drug to market.
[3:23:04.720 --> 3:23:07.640]  If pharmaceutical companies start promoting a drug for something
[3:23:07.640 --> 3:23:10.560]  that the FDA hasn't OK, then it's a big trouble.
[3:23:10.560 --> 3:23:15.640]  In 2009, Pfizer agreed to pay $2.3 billion
[3:23:15.640 --> 3:23:19.000]  in a criminal and civil liability lawsuit stemming
[3:23:19.000 --> 3:23:21.840]  from the illegality of promoting a certain drug.
[3:23:21.840 --> 3:23:24.600]  At that time, it was the largest health care fraud
[3:23:24.600 --> 3:23:26.400]  settlement in history.
[3:23:26.400 --> 3:23:30.400]  In 2012, health care giant GlaxoSmithKline
[3:23:30.400 --> 3:23:33.560]  agreed to pay $3 billion in criminal and civil charges
[3:23:33.560 --> 3:23:37.200]  for unlawful promotion of drugs like Paxil and Wellburgeon.
[3:23:37.200 --> 3:23:38.680]  All right?
[3:23:38.680 --> 3:23:40.920]  I could go on and on and on.
[3:23:40.920 --> 3:23:44.560]  Morons and imbeciles call them big pharma.
[3:23:44.560 --> 3:23:47.000]  They're drug lords.
[3:23:47.000 --> 3:23:49.000]  They're drug dealers.
[3:23:49.000 --> 3:23:49.760]  You got it?
[3:23:54.000 --> 3:23:58.240]  Look at that little slime ball.
[3:23:58.240 --> 3:24:02.720]  A little nothing of a clown boy with another attitude.
[3:24:02.720 --> 3:24:05.160]  Scott got lead.
[3:24:05.160 --> 3:24:07.800]  Scott got crap.
[3:24:07.800 --> 3:24:12.560]  Scott, your little low life piece of garbage.
[3:24:12.560 --> 3:24:15.080]  It was the head of the FDA under Trump.
[3:24:15.080 --> 3:24:18.120]  And it's now on the board as directors of Pfizer.
[3:24:18.120 --> 3:24:20.040]  Oh, that Pfizer?
[3:24:20.040 --> 3:24:22.840]  The Pfizer that paid the largest criminal fine in history
[3:24:22.840 --> 3:24:24.640]  lawsuits detail?
[3:24:24.640 --> 3:24:25.320]  Yeah, that one.
[3:24:28.800 --> 3:24:34.720]  And again, this is going on around the world.
[3:24:34.720 --> 3:24:38.080]  Hey, look at that little boy.
[3:24:38.080 --> 3:24:43.840]  Look at that little boy, that ball-less little boy.
[3:24:43.840 --> 3:24:47.040]  You're a low life.
[3:24:47.040 --> 3:24:53.160]  Going from the FDA to Pfizer, you should be in jail.
[3:24:53.160 --> 3:24:57.880]  You're a criminal, like the rest of them.
[3:25:01.240 --> 3:25:04.280]  Supposedly representing the people.
[3:25:04.280 --> 3:25:06.360]  And then you go over there.
[3:25:06.360 --> 3:25:10.080]  You represent your pocketbook.
[3:25:10.080 --> 3:25:15.120]  And your little cojones that represent nothing.
[3:25:15.120 --> 3:25:18.520]  Snap lockdown.
[3:25:18.520 --> 3:25:23.920]  After COVID case found, 238 deaths in 19 months, right?
[3:25:23.920 --> 3:25:25.440]  This is here.
[3:25:25.440 --> 3:25:29.040]  Residents of South Wales, local government area
[3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:31.640]  will be sent back into snap lockdown
[3:25:31.640 --> 3:25:34.960]  within hours after discovery of a COVID case today.
[3:25:34.960 --> 3:25:36.080]  All right?
[3:25:36.080 --> 3:25:44.440]  New South Wales, 238 deaths in 19 months at 8.1 million people.
[3:25:48.440 --> 3:25:52.560]  238 deaths out of 8.1 million people.
[3:25:52.560 --> 3:25:55.920]  They're pushing for more vaccines, and it's working.
[3:25:55.920 --> 3:25:58.600]  The vaccine rate, it was just a couple of months ago,
[3:25:58.600 --> 3:26:01.560]  was under 20%.
[3:26:01.560 --> 3:26:04.240]  You ready?
[3:26:04.240 --> 3:26:07.800]  There were also seven more fatalities.
[3:26:07.800 --> 3:26:09.320]  Here are the seven more fatalities.
[3:26:09.320 --> 3:26:11.320]  Count them up.
[3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:14.640]  Three men in their 80s.
[3:26:14.640 --> 3:26:17.040]  What kind of shape were they?
[3:26:17.040 --> 3:26:20.520]  And what's the average age that you die?
[3:26:23.320 --> 3:26:24.640]  So they're going out, right?
[3:26:24.640 --> 3:26:26.600]  They're 80 years old and not 18.
[3:26:26.600 --> 3:26:34.240]  Two in their 90s.
[3:26:34.240 --> 3:26:38.240]  They would have lived on 100.
[3:26:38.240 --> 3:26:49.400]  And two women, one in their 60s, and one in their 90s.
[3:26:49.400 --> 3:26:52.480]  You got it?
[3:26:52.480 --> 3:26:55.400]  And they're vaccinating young people
[3:26:55.400 --> 3:27:02.360]  with a recovery rate of only 99.997% for people 1 to 20.
[3:27:02.360 --> 3:27:03.560]  There you got it.
[3:27:03.560 --> 3:27:08.840]  78.54 years, and people are dying.
[3:27:08.840 --> 3:27:09.920]  That's the United States.
[3:27:09.920 --> 3:27:13.000]  Anyway, in the 90s, this is what they're doing.
[3:27:16.040 --> 3:27:20.080]  By Monday, 78.5% of New South Wales residents
[3:27:20.080 --> 3:27:23.040]  aged 16 and older had one vaccine.
[3:27:23.040 --> 3:27:25.800]  They are pushing it and pushing it, and it's working.
[3:27:25.800 --> 3:27:29.400]  New Zealand extended a strict lockdown.
[3:27:29.400 --> 3:27:31.640]  And it's the largest city, Monday.
[3:27:31.640 --> 3:27:34.400]  Required 1.7 million people living in Auckland
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:37.400]  to remain indoors.
[3:27:37.400 --> 3:27:40.360]  You know how many debts they had in New Zealand?
[3:27:40.360 --> 3:27:47.320]  You got 5 million people, 19 months, 27 debts.
[3:27:47.320 --> 3:27:54.840]  27 cases?
[3:27:54.840 --> 3:27:56.200]  Cases don't count.
[3:27:56.200 --> 3:27:57.920]  PCR tests are fake.
[3:27:57.920 --> 3:28:00.160]  The numbers are there, not making us up.
[3:28:02.880 --> 3:28:05.680]  The city is virtually cut off from the rest of the country,
[3:28:05.680 --> 3:28:07.480]  keeping people inside.
[3:28:07.480 --> 3:28:08.320]  What is the facts?
[3:28:08.320 --> 3:28:10.920]  What's the data?
[3:28:10.920 --> 3:28:13.080]  The hard data?
[3:28:13.080 --> 3:28:20.600]  Chances of getting it outside are less than 1%
[3:28:20.600 --> 3:28:22.080]  and you're keeping people inside?
[3:28:24.880 --> 3:28:27.760]  If we don't fight for freedom, we're lost.
[3:28:27.760 --> 3:28:30.240]  And do what you can to support InfoWars.
[3:28:30.240 --> 3:28:33.360]  They got great products and great sales going on.
[3:28:33.360 --> 3:28:35.440]  And when I get back, we're going to talk more about it.
[3:28:37.960 --> 3:28:40.400]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me,
[3:28:40.400 --> 3:28:44.440]  and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there
[3:28:44.440 --> 3:28:47.000]  and I beg you for support, constantly,
[3:28:47.000 --> 3:28:50.280]  for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[3:28:50.280 --> 3:28:51.760]  And we're all this together.
[3:28:51.760 --> 3:28:54.360]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey,
[3:28:54.360 --> 3:28:55.440]  I got great products.
[3:28:55.440 --> 3:28:57.080]  Please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[3:28:57.080 --> 3:28:57.800]  But it's true.
[3:28:57.800 --> 3:28:59.880]  We're the only media organization in the United States
[3:28:59.880 --> 3:29:02.480]  that promotes liberty at this level that is not
[3:29:02.480 --> 3:29:04.440]  beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:29:04.440 --> 3:29:06.520]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:29:06.520 --> 3:29:09.160]  They've crippled all the other groups, and we're still here.
[3:29:09.160 --> 3:29:12.360]  And as this whole new world order comes out and be open,
[3:29:12.360 --> 3:29:13.560]  our credibility is going up.
[3:29:13.560 --> 3:29:15.200]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:29:15.200 --> 3:29:17.320]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:29:17.320 --> 3:29:19.600]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved.
[3:29:19.600 --> 3:29:21.720]  And America is still quasi-free.
[3:29:21.720 --> 3:29:23.560]  You can't have InfoWars has been proven right
[3:29:23.560 --> 3:29:25.600]  being on air with all the craziness
[3:29:25.600 --> 3:29:26.880]  that's about to unfold.
[3:29:26.880 --> 3:29:28.920]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:29:28.920 --> 3:29:30.240]  So thank you all.
[3:29:30.240 --> 3:29:31.640]  And get an infowarstore.com.
[3:29:31.640 --> 3:29:33.560]  Get some great 2020 election shirts,
[3:29:33.560 --> 3:29:34.920]  supplements, and so much more.
[3:29:34.920 --> 3:29:36.800]  They're wonderful products, and they support the InfoWars.
[3:29:36.800 --> 3:29:38.280]  Thank you.
[3:29:38.280 --> 3:29:40.600]  It's only been in the last 60 years
[3:29:40.600 --> 3:29:43.920]  that we've had satellites that can decently measure
[3:29:43.920 --> 3:29:45.920]  what's happening in the atmosphere.
[3:29:45.920 --> 3:29:47.400]  But if you look at all the different studies
[3:29:47.400 --> 3:29:51.000]  and reports about NASA and other governments and other agencies,
[3:29:51.000 --> 3:29:53.840]  they all disagree on what's really happening with climate.
[3:29:53.840 --> 3:29:59.280]  The only great truth is change is the only constant.
[3:29:59.280 --> 3:30:02.080]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[3:30:02.080 --> 3:30:04.280]  But notice, first they called it global freezing
[3:30:04.280 --> 3:30:07.080]  back in the 70s and 80s, and then it's going to be global warming.
[3:30:07.080 --> 3:30:09.800]  And when that didn't really happen the way they wanted to,
[3:30:09.800 --> 3:30:11.840]  OK, now it's just climate change.
[3:30:11.840 --> 3:30:16.120]  But did you know that man-made climate change is a real thing
[3:30:16.120 --> 3:30:18.680]  when it comes to the United Nations and the Department
[3:30:18.680 --> 3:30:21.240]  of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[3:30:21.240 --> 3:30:24.280]  They have weather control trees from 1979.
[3:30:24.280 --> 3:30:26.680]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather
[3:30:26.680 --> 3:30:28.120]  for a very long time.
[3:30:28.120 --> 3:30:29.880]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists
[3:30:29.880 --> 3:30:32.800]  wanted a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles
[3:30:32.800 --> 3:30:34.960]  out of jet engines to control the weather.
[3:30:34.960 --> 3:30:38.240]  So yes, man-made climate change is real.
[3:30:38.240 --> 3:30:41.520]  Let's go back in time, say, to the mid-1990s.
[3:30:41.520 --> 3:30:45.160]  And then imagine a science fiction movie set in the year 2020
[3:30:45.160 --> 3:30:46.920]  where a world government's being established,
[3:30:46.920 --> 3:30:49.600]  where members of Congress and former presidents
[3:30:49.600 --> 3:30:51.160]  are censured by big tech.
[3:30:51.160 --> 3:30:54.480]  And where, if you don't take an experimental injection that
[3:30:54.480 --> 3:30:58.200]  grows blood clots and prions all over your body,
[3:30:58.200 --> 3:31:01.920]  then you're not allowed to fly on an airplane.
[3:31:01.920 --> 3:31:04.160]  Think about that, because that's where we are.
[3:31:04.160 --> 3:31:07.680]  Imagine just 20, 30 years ago, tell us just five years ago,
[3:31:07.680 --> 3:31:10.960]  if somebody told you this would be happening.
[3:31:10.960 --> 3:31:13.000]  But it is happening now.
[3:31:13.000 --> 3:31:14.440]  And then they tell you, oh, sorry,
[3:31:14.440 --> 3:31:16.160]  it's not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy,
[3:31:16.160 --> 3:31:17.640]  and it doesn't really work.
[3:31:17.640 --> 3:31:19.560]  So you've got to take it every few months.
[3:31:19.560 --> 3:31:22.040]  And the people that have submitted say, great,
[3:31:22.040 --> 3:31:24.520]  I want to take it all the time so I can go outside and not
[3:31:24.520 --> 3:31:27.520]  get sick from COVID, even though it gets you sick from COVID.
[3:31:27.520 --> 3:31:29.800]  And now there's record numbers of really sick people
[3:31:29.800 --> 3:31:32.440]  from the sloughing, the shedding of the virus.
[3:31:32.440 --> 3:31:34.240]  And that's in mainline studies.
[3:31:34.240 --> 3:31:36.120]  Bill Gates and Fauci did this, need
[3:31:36.120 --> 3:31:37.840]  to go to prison for it right now.
[3:31:37.840 --> 3:31:40.600]  Just a week ago, we got a new shipment of vitamin
[3:31:40.600 --> 3:31:42.560]  and mineral fusion back in stock.
[3:31:42.560 --> 3:31:45.560]  And it was only half of the order we wanted to get.
[3:31:45.560 --> 3:31:47.760]  But because we won't cut corners on the quality
[3:31:47.760 --> 3:31:49.640]  of what goes into it, the factory
[3:31:49.640 --> 3:31:50.880]  can only get limited supply.
[3:31:50.880 --> 3:31:53.120]  So again, it was half the order we wanted.
[3:31:53.120 --> 3:31:56.480]  But despite that, I'm still offering it for 33% off,
[3:31:56.480 --> 3:31:58.520]  so everybody on the fence will get it.
[3:31:58.520 --> 3:32:00.840]  It's critical for your immune system and your whole body.
[3:32:00.840 --> 3:32:03.160]  All the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals,
[3:32:03.160 --> 3:32:06.080]  and a bunch of key amino acids at infowarstore.com.
[3:32:06.080 --> 3:32:08.520]  So while supplies last until it runs out,
[3:32:08.520 --> 3:32:12.200]  we're selling it for 33% off, and it'll be months
[3:32:12.200 --> 3:32:13.280]  till more comes in.
[3:32:13.280 --> 3:32:16.360]  So get yours today at infowarstore.com.
[3:32:16.360 --> 3:32:17.960]  Because it's not just a great product,
[3:32:17.960 --> 3:32:20.120]  we need those funds to keep operating as well.
[3:32:20.120 --> 3:32:21.480]  We're all in a catch-22.

[3:32:29.960 --> 3:32:31.920]  It's just called hair and beard.
[3:32:31.920 --> 3:32:33.720]  So get that as well for your immune system.

[3:32:35.440 --> 3:32:37.560]  but it's designed for men in infowarstore.com.

[3:33:11.480 --> 3:33:15.640]  and as Alex just said with that ad, infowarsstores.com.
[3:33:15.640 --> 3:33:17.880]  And we're in the fight of our lives,
[3:33:17.880 --> 3:33:20.000]  and we can't do this alone.
[3:33:20.000 --> 3:33:22.120]  You need to support us.
[3:33:22.120 --> 3:33:23.240]  And they have great products,
[3:33:23.240 --> 3:33:25.680]  so you're not getting, you know, for nothing,
[3:33:25.680 --> 3:33:27.320]  even though you're getting all this information
[3:33:27.320 --> 3:33:28.920]  that you're putting out.
[3:33:28.920 --> 3:33:31.880]  We give it from our hearts and souls.
[3:33:31.880 --> 3:33:36.160]  So they have great, great sales going on.
[3:33:36.160 --> 3:33:38.800]  And one of them, of course, is the Ultra 12,
[3:33:38.800 --> 3:33:43.800]  which is 50% off at infowarsstores.
[3:33:44.720 --> 3:33:47.520]  And in a constant search to improve their formulas
[3:33:47.520 --> 3:33:49.640]  and give you the best for less,
[3:33:50.520 --> 3:33:53.240]  infowars have found an all new way
[3:33:53.240 --> 3:33:56.720]  to provide you with the 12 that you need.
[3:33:56.720 --> 3:33:59.040]  And you need this stuff because Ultra 12
[3:33:59.040 --> 3:34:03.720]  from infowarslife, it took a familiar secret 12 formula
[3:34:03.720 --> 3:34:07.760]  and singled out one powerful ingredient.
[3:34:07.760 --> 3:34:11.160]  And it's the most effective and expensive form
[3:34:11.160 --> 3:34:13.000]  of B12 available.
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:18.000]  And Ultra 12 provides you with twice, twice the B12.
[3:34:19.240 --> 3:34:22.200]  And because B12 is necessary nutrient
[3:34:22.200 --> 3:34:25.880]  that isn't found in any vegetables,
[3:34:25.880 --> 3:34:27.600]  it can be difficult to attain.
[3:34:27.600 --> 3:34:30.920]  So instead of getting painful B12 injections,
[3:34:30.920 --> 3:34:33.520]  we're taking weaker formulas,
[3:34:33.520 --> 3:34:36.200]  you can now support your energy production
[3:34:36.200 --> 3:34:40.720]  with this far, far, far superior form of B12.
[3:34:40.720 --> 3:34:43.080]  And with just a single ingredient,
[3:34:43.080 --> 3:34:45.080]  it is Ultra 12 can help you.
[3:34:45.080 --> 3:34:48.620]  So support your healthy nerve and brain cells,
[3:34:50.400 --> 3:34:52.080]  help make DNA,
[3:34:53.680 --> 3:34:56.240]  help the body produce energy,
[3:34:56.240 --> 3:34:59.700]  help produce healthy blood cells.
[3:34:59.700 --> 3:35:04.440]  And it's essential for proper nervous system function.
[3:35:04.440 --> 3:35:09.140]  So with as many as 30% of adults over 50,
[3:35:09.140 --> 3:35:12.440]  having trouble absorbing B12 from their normal diet,
[3:35:12.440 --> 3:35:14.840]  it's really important that you're able to avoid
[3:35:14.840 --> 3:35:19.840]  B12 deficiency and support your energy production for less.
[3:35:20.720 --> 3:35:25.000]  So with Ultra 12 from infowars,
[3:35:25.000 --> 3:35:28.360]  you can take advantage of this incredible formula
[3:35:28.360 --> 3:35:30.240]  and start boosting your energy production.
[3:35:30.240 --> 3:35:32.800]  So don't miss out now and grab a bottle
[3:35:32.800 --> 3:35:35.280]  of the concentrated B12 formula today

[3:35:48.360 --> 3:35:49.200]  All right.
[3:35:51.120 --> 3:35:53.140]  So what else is going on?
[3:35:57.880 --> 3:36:00.480]  COVID vaccination progress.
[3:36:00.480 --> 3:36:02.320]  Only one in five Americans say
[3:36:02.320 --> 3:36:03.560]  they won't get a jab.
[3:36:07.200 --> 3:36:09.160]  This is from your Trends Journal.
[3:36:11.960 --> 3:36:16.960]  September 29th, 2020, almost a year ago.
[3:36:18.760 --> 3:36:19.880]  All right.
[3:36:19.880 --> 3:36:21.200]  This is why you subscribe.
[3:36:21.200 --> 3:36:23.080]  It's history before it happens.
[3:36:24.560 --> 3:36:29.080]  Americans get cold feet over COVID-19 vaccine.
[3:36:29.080 --> 3:36:30.600]  No, no, wait a minute.
[3:36:30.600 --> 3:36:33.680]  It says COVID vaccination progress now.
[3:36:33.680 --> 3:36:36.320]  Only one in five say they won't get a jab.
[3:36:36.320 --> 3:36:37.160]  Huh, okay.
[3:36:37.160 --> 3:36:38.320]  What happened back then?
[3:36:39.320 --> 3:36:41.520]  Americans seem to, this is from the magazine,
[3:36:41.520 --> 3:36:42.800]  The Trends Journal.
[3:36:42.800 --> 3:36:45.000]  Americans seem to have reservations
[3:36:45.000 --> 3:36:46.280]  about being first in line
[3:36:46.280 --> 3:36:49.080]  for any approved vaccination of COVID-19,
[3:36:49.080 --> 3:36:53.320]  according to recent Axios-Ipsos poll.
[3:36:53.320 --> 3:36:55.600]  The poll showed only 13% of Americans
[3:36:55.600 --> 3:36:58.760]  will be willing to take the vaccine upon rollout.
[3:36:58.760 --> 3:37:00.360]  Are you ready for this?
[3:37:00.360 --> 3:37:04.320]  Joe Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris,
[3:37:04.320 --> 3:37:07.880]  have raised suspicions about the reliability
[3:37:07.880 --> 3:37:12.160]  of any vaccine rolled out before the election.
[3:37:14.080 --> 3:37:16.120]  President Trump and his campaign,
[3:37:16.120 --> 3:37:20.280]  seeing effective vaccine is a major boost to his reelection.
[3:37:20.280 --> 3:37:24.800]  In May, President Trump announced Operation Whoop Speed.
[3:37:24.800 --> 3:37:29.800]  And he compared it to the U.S. race for the atomic bomb.
[3:37:32.120 --> 3:37:33.720]  The Associated Press reported,
[3:37:33.720 --> 3:37:37.400]  once there was a variable vaccine,
[3:37:37.400 --> 3:37:40.200]  Trump said he was employed every plane, truck,
[3:37:40.200 --> 3:37:41.780]  and soldier to distribute it.
[3:37:43.560 --> 3:37:46.720]  News website Stat reported that many Democrats
[3:37:46.720 --> 3:37:48.680]  that indicated a swift vaccine approval
[3:37:48.680 --> 3:37:50.840]  would be politically motivated by the White House.
[3:37:50.840 --> 3:37:52.720]  Oh, the Democrats said that.
[3:37:52.720 --> 3:37:55.880]  Harris said she would not trust the vaccine under Trump.
[3:37:55.880 --> 3:37:58.440]  Biden agreed with his running mate.
[3:37:58.440 --> 3:38:00.480]  I trust vaccines.
[3:38:00.480 --> 3:38:02.320]  Biden said, I trust scientists,
[3:38:02.320 --> 3:38:04.760]  but I don't trust Donald Trump.
[3:38:04.760 --> 3:38:07.720]  Political reporters, Trump called out Biden,
[3:38:07.720 --> 3:38:09.720]  a recklessly endangering line.
[3:38:11.680 --> 3:38:14.480]  The Axios-Ipsos poll showed
[3:38:14.480 --> 3:38:18.420]  has been a rise in suspicions about the vaccine.
[3:38:18.420 --> 3:38:22.080]  Most of those polled, about 30% said it would.
[3:38:22.080 --> 3:38:23.600]  All right?
[3:38:23.600 --> 3:38:25.920]  And look how quick it changed.
[3:38:25.920 --> 3:38:28.040]  Look how quick the people swallowed it.
[3:38:29.080 --> 3:38:34.200]  And the Democrats are the ones that are the most pro-vaccine.
[3:38:34.200 --> 3:38:39.200]  So, don't call these Democrats, by the way, liberals.
[3:38:41.320 --> 3:38:45.120]  A liberal is willing to respect or accept behavior
[3:38:45.120 --> 3:38:48.360]  or opinions different from one's own,
[3:38:48.360 --> 3:38:51.820]  opened to new ideas.
[3:38:51.820 --> 3:38:56.820]  I said to you that the protests,
[3:38:58.440 --> 3:39:00.480]  there's one going on now in New York City.
[3:39:00.480 --> 3:39:02.240]  I couldn't make it today
[3:39:02.240 --> 3:39:04.320]  because I'm on deadline with the Trends Journal.
[3:39:04.320 --> 3:39:06.080]  TrendsJournal.com.
[3:39:06.080 --> 3:39:08.120]  The only magazine, as you can see,
[3:39:08.120 --> 3:39:09.880]  where you read history before it happens.
[3:39:09.880 --> 3:39:13.160]  Matter of fact, I didn't read you this.
[3:39:13.160 --> 3:39:16.420]  Remember, this is September 20th, a year ago.
[3:39:16.420 --> 3:39:21.340]  Here's my trend forecast, right down the bottom.
[3:39:21.340 --> 3:39:24.660]  As we have noted from nation's capitals
[3:39:24.660 --> 3:39:26.180]  across the globe to Wall Street,
[3:39:26.180 --> 3:39:29.460]  the word is that until a COVID vaccine
[3:39:29.460 --> 3:39:31.700]  is made available to the public,
[3:39:31.700 --> 3:39:35.460]  there will be no stronger economic rebound.
[3:39:35.460 --> 3:39:37.780]  Therefore, we forecast the first,
[3:39:37.780 --> 3:39:41.300]  faster the vaccine hits Main Street,
[3:39:41.300 --> 3:39:44.580]  resistance to get vaccinated will decrease
[3:39:44.580 --> 3:39:46.980]  as the major media and politicians
[3:39:46.980 --> 3:39:49.020]  promote getting vaccinated
[3:39:49.020 --> 3:39:53.500]  as the only way to win the COVID war with virtually no mention.
[3:39:53.500 --> 3:39:56.380]  No mention of building one's immune system
[3:39:56.380 --> 3:39:58.380]  and getting healthy.
[3:39:58.380 --> 3:40:00.660]  Governments will impose educational
[3:40:00.660 --> 3:40:03.100]  and other restrictions on all those
[3:40:03.100 --> 3:40:05.140]  who refuse to get vaccinated.
[3:40:06.020 --> 3:40:07.900]  It's right there.
[3:40:07.900 --> 3:40:12.380]  We said this would happen when no one else said it.
[3:40:12.380 --> 3:40:15.420]  And that's why you subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[3:40:15.420 --> 3:40:17.500]  TrendsJournal.com.
[3:40:17.500 --> 3:40:20.340]  And as I said at Ron Paul's conference,
[3:40:20.340 --> 3:40:22.860]  my topic was we must unite,
[3:40:22.860 --> 3:40:25.540]  united we stand divided we fall.
[3:40:25.540 --> 3:40:27.220]  Again, I was mentioning there's a rally
[3:40:27.220 --> 3:40:28.700]  in New York City right now.
[3:40:28.700 --> 3:40:30.300]  It was the start of four o'clock.
[3:40:31.900 --> 3:40:35.340]  Del Bigtree will be there a number of people.
[3:40:35.340 --> 3:40:38.500]  I did one three weeks ago at Columbus Circle,
[3:40:38.500 --> 3:40:41.380]  only about 2,000, 3,000 people showed up.
[3:40:41.380 --> 3:40:43.780]  There'll probably be a lot more.
[3:40:43.780 --> 3:40:46.900]  Because now it's going official in New York City,
[3:40:46.900 --> 3:40:49.860]  Novak's passport you can't get in most places.
[3:40:51.540 --> 3:40:53.420]  The rallies are worthless.
[3:40:56.220 --> 3:40:57.860]  They don't make any sense to me.
[3:40:59.260 --> 3:41:00.460]  And I'll tell you why.
[3:41:03.660 --> 3:41:04.900]  I support them.
[3:41:04.900 --> 3:41:06.780]  I do everything I can for them.
[3:41:06.780 --> 3:41:08.020]  I believe in them.
[3:41:08.020 --> 3:41:11.420]  I'll never forget this.
[3:41:13.660 --> 3:41:15.580]  Back in 1982,
[3:41:17.900 --> 3:41:20.860]  there was a huge rally protest
[3:41:21.940 --> 3:41:23.780]  in Central Park in New York.
[3:41:25.900 --> 3:41:27.620]  An anti-nuclear rally.
[3:41:29.500 --> 3:41:33.460]  They estimate up to a million people turned out.
[3:41:33.460 --> 3:41:37.380]  Did he do anything? Nope.
[3:41:40.380 --> 3:41:44.180]  This is a quote by Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
[3:41:44.180 --> 3:41:45.020]  back then.
[3:41:46.020 --> 3:41:49.180]  He said the fact that a very large number of people
[3:41:49.180 --> 3:41:50.980]  turned out for a particular event
[3:41:50.980 --> 3:41:53.100]  is certainly something that people notice.
[3:41:54.100 --> 3:41:56.660]  But I don't think anybody rushes back and says,
[3:41:56.660 --> 3:41:58.580]  we have to change our policy.
[3:41:58.580 --> 3:42:01.700]  I don't think anybody's going to change our policy.
[3:42:01.700 --> 3:42:05.260]  He goes back and says, we have to change our policy
[3:42:05.260 --> 3:42:09.420]  or something because there has been a rally.
[3:42:10.340 --> 3:42:11.180]  Got it.
[3:42:12.660 --> 3:42:13.700]  They did nothing.
[3:42:14.660 --> 3:42:16.420]  Didn't stop anything.
[3:42:20.820 --> 3:42:22.340]  The rallies don't work.
[3:42:23.300 --> 3:42:27.180]  You have to do what they did when the Berlin Wall fell.
[3:42:27.180 --> 3:42:28.540]  You came and you didn't leave.
[3:42:28.540 --> 3:42:29.820]  More came, they didn't leave.
[3:42:29.820 --> 3:42:31.460]  More came, they didn't leave.
[3:42:31.460 --> 3:42:33.620]  More came and they didn't leave.
[3:42:33.620 --> 3:42:34.740]  That's the way I see it.
[3:42:34.740 --> 3:42:35.900]  We'll be back.
[3:42:35.900 --> 3:42:38.820]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like
[3:42:38.820 --> 3:42:41.460]  with one of our most powerful products ever made,
[3:42:41.460 --> 3:42:42.500]  Alpha Power.
[3:42:42.500 --> 3:42:45.980]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.
[3:42:45.980 --> 3:42:48.340]  With the incredible ingredients in this formula,
[3:42:48.340 --> 3:42:50.300]  we can help you beat the test of time
[3:42:50.300 --> 3:42:52.460]  and assist in restoring that lost energy
[3:42:52.460 --> 3:42:54.820]  and mood that comes with time and age.
[3:42:54.820 --> 3:42:56.700]  Alpha Power's incredible ingredients
[3:42:56.700 --> 3:42:58.820]  can help you boost your sports performance
[3:42:58.820 --> 3:43:01.300]  or enhance your day-to-day life with ease

[3:43:04.900 --> 3:43:09.020]  or with super male vitality in the true alpha male pack.
[3:43:09.020 --> 3:43:11.180]  Alpha Power can help lose performance,
[3:43:11.180 --> 3:43:13.700]  help maintain normal testosterone levels,
[3:43:13.700 --> 3:43:16.260]  support healthy cholesterol, and more.
[3:43:16.260 --> 3:43:17.860]  Let Alpha Power help bring you

[3:44:03.220 --> 3:44:05.860]  about the show because people are ready to wake up
[3:44:05.860 --> 3:44:07.300]  and ready to hear the truth.
[3:44:07.300 --> 3:44:09.220]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[3:44:09.220 --> 3:44:10.580]  and trying to stop their agenda,
[3:44:10.580 --> 3:44:12.820]  but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[3:44:12.820 --> 3:44:13.980]  And one of the number one things to do
[3:44:13.980 --> 3:44:15.420]  is high quality, storeable food.

[3:44:16.980 --> 3:44:20.100]  at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.

[3:44:28.500 --> 3:44:30.620]  and before there are long lines and waits
[3:44:30.620 --> 3:44:32.940]  because believe me, serious times are coming.
[3:44:32.940 --> 3:44:35.100]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[3:44:36.660 --> 3:44:39.260]  Bio remediation is a process used to treat
[3:44:39.260 --> 3:44:42.420]  contaminating water, soil, and subsurface material
[3:44:42.420 --> 3:44:44.740]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions
[3:44:44.740 --> 3:44:46.860]  to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[3:44:46.860 --> 3:44:48.700]  and degrade targeted pollutants.
[3:44:48.700 --> 3:44:51.260]  For the first time, the bio pros are bringing
[3:44:51.260 --> 3:44:54.460]  to the public market a suite of bio remediation products
[3:44:54.460 --> 3:44:55.780]  to the everyday consumer.
[3:44:55.780 --> 3:44:58.020]  Their first product they are launching is called
[3:44:58.020 --> 3:45:01.020]  BioSeptic Pro, a product specifically designed
[3:45:01.020 --> 3:45:02.980]  to establish a healthy septic system.
[3:45:02.980 --> 3:45:05.580]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms,
[3:45:05.580 --> 3:45:07.740]  not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[3:45:07.740 --> 3:45:09.660]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[3:45:09.660 --> 3:45:12.340]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank
[3:45:12.340 --> 3:45:14.940]  and is at least 100 times more effective
[3:45:14.940 --> 3:45:16.860]  than similar microbial products
[3:45:16.860 --> 3:45:19.020]  due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[3:45:19.020 --> 3:45:21.900]  BioSeptic Pro contains no chemical ingredients
[3:45:21.900 --> 3:45:23.820]  and no genetically modified organisms.
[3:45:23.820 --> 3:45:27.980]  Visit thebiopros.com today and protect your septic system.
[3:45:27.980 --> 3:45:30.020]  That's thebiopros.com.
[3:45:30.020 --> 3:45:32.180]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks
[3:45:32.180 --> 3:45:34.140]  and the job it does is unparalleled.
[3:45:34.140 --> 3:45:35.780]  Thebiopros.com.
[3:45:36.660 --> 3:45:39.500]  I am cutting this ad on Thursday afternoon.
[3:45:39.500 --> 3:45:42.460]  That means you've got one, two, three, four days.
[3:45:42.460 --> 3:45:45.500]  Monday at midnight, we've got to end this sale.
[3:45:45.500 --> 3:45:46.820]  We may end it earlier,
[3:45:46.820 --> 3:45:48.540]  because we think it'll sell out by then
[3:45:48.540 --> 3:45:49.780]  at current sales rates.
[3:45:49.780 --> 3:45:51.740]  Vitamin refuge is super popular.
[3:45:51.740 --> 3:45:53.500]  It's got all the high quality vitamins
[3:45:53.500 --> 3:45:54.700]  and minerals that are essential,
[3:45:54.700 --> 3:45:56.300]  great amino acids, and it tastes great.
[3:45:56.300 --> 3:45:58.660]  It's powder formed, so in the water,
[3:45:58.660 --> 3:46:01.180]  you absorb it more when you drink the fruit punch.
[3:46:01.180 --> 3:46:03.260]  Then we also have back in stock,
[3:46:03.260 --> 3:46:04.820]  this sale will continue through next week,
[3:46:04.820 --> 3:46:07.900]  knock out sleep aid with eight organic ingredients
[3:46:07.900 --> 3:46:08.900]  that help you sleep better.
[3:46:08.900 --> 3:46:11.980]  It's 50% off and ultra 12 on our best sellers,
[3:46:11.980 --> 3:46:14.140]  high quality, vitamin B12 for your whole body,

[3:46:16.780 --> 3:46:20.180]  It's back in stock and it is 50% off as well

[3:46:31.500 --> 3:46:33.860]  but the sale of vitamin mineral fusion ends Monday night,
[3:46:33.860 --> 3:46:34.780]  so get yours now.
[3:46:39.540 --> 3:46:42.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:46:42.580 --> 3:47:02.260]  Alex Jones.
[3:47:02.260 --> 3:47:04.260]  Leading up frontal assault
[3:47:04.260 --> 3:47:07.060]  on the lies of the new world order,
[3:47:07.060 --> 3:47:09.060]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:09.060 --> 3:47:11.520]  And now your host,
[3:47:11.520 --> 3:47:14.520]  Gerald Salente.
[3:47:17.520 --> 3:47:21.520]  Hello, hello, great being on the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:21.520 --> 3:47:25.520]  And remember, do what you can to support info wars.
[3:47:25.520 --> 3:47:28.520]  You better put your money where your heart is.
[3:47:28.520 --> 3:47:30.520]  And again, you know, the Trends Journal,
[3:47:30.520 --> 3:47:32.520]  if you want to read history before it happens,
[3:47:32.520 --> 3:47:34.520]  there's no magazine like it.
[3:47:34.520 --> 3:47:38.520]  You've shown me one like it, and I'd love to see it.
[3:47:38.520 --> 3:47:41.520]  And again, the more you support us, the more we can do.
[3:47:41.520 --> 3:47:44.520]  So get it in your head. This isn't a free ride.
[3:47:44.520 --> 3:47:47.520]  And we need money to make it happen.
[3:47:47.520 --> 3:47:49.520]  That's the society we live in.
[3:47:49.520 --> 3:47:52.520]  And the bigs are getting bigger and taking control of more and more.
[3:47:52.520 --> 3:47:55.520]  Merge your acquisition activity. You ready?
[3:47:55.520 --> 3:47:58.520]  It's at an all-time high.
[3:47:58.520 --> 3:48:01.520]  Every day you pick up the paper one after another.
[3:48:01.520 --> 3:48:07.520]  One company buying out another for 3 billion, 5 billion, 2 billion.
[3:48:07.520 --> 3:48:11.520]  Or we become plantation workers in slave landia.
[3:48:11.520 --> 3:48:14.520]  Walmart. There was no such thing when I was a young guy.
[3:48:14.520 --> 3:48:19.520]  There were no such ugly places to go buy stuff.
[3:48:19.520 --> 3:48:21.520]  You're taking over everything.
[3:48:21.520 --> 3:48:24.520]  So you got to support info wars, support the Trends Journal.
[3:48:24.520 --> 3:48:28.520]  We're fighting for freedom.
[3:48:28.520 --> 3:48:33.520]  I told you how stupid it is though they're doing it in New Zealand.
[3:48:33.520 --> 3:48:36.520]  Man, there they are. The Berlin Wall.
[3:48:36.520 --> 3:48:39.520]  People didn't leave. More came. They didn't leave.
[3:48:39.520 --> 3:48:42.520]  I'm going home. It's 6 o'clock.
[3:48:42.520 --> 3:48:46.520]  Now, you don't go rally and then go home. You stay.
[3:48:46.520 --> 3:48:49.520]  Until about 6 o'clock, the streets are dead at 10.
[3:48:49.520 --> 3:48:52.520]  I tell you I was down in Cape May.
[3:48:52.520 --> 3:48:54.520]  I figured out nightlife down there, you know.
[3:48:54.520 --> 3:48:56.520]  Labor Day weekend.
[3:48:56.520 --> 3:48:58.520]  9.30, 10 o'clock.
[3:48:58.520 --> 3:49:00.520]  I used to say when I was a kid.
[3:49:00.520 --> 3:49:03.520]  It's 10 p.m.
[3:49:03.520 --> 3:49:09.520]  You know where your children are.
[3:49:09.520 --> 3:49:11.520]  Now it's 10 p.m. Everything's dead.
[3:49:11.520 --> 3:49:14.520]  You know where your kids are. You know where you are.
[3:49:14.520 --> 3:49:16.520]  There's nobody on the streets.
[3:49:16.520 --> 3:49:18.520]  When I was a kid, it was a big deal.
[3:49:18.520 --> 3:49:20.520]  Where are you? Where are you?
[3:49:20.520 --> 3:49:22.520]  How's all my friends?
[3:49:22.520 --> 3:49:24.520]  That's the way it used to be.
[3:49:24.520 --> 3:49:27.520]  10 days to run these ads because the kids are out going nuts.
[3:49:27.520 --> 3:49:32.520]  And now you're freaked out staying home.
[3:49:32.520 --> 3:49:36.520]  Marches must be vaccinated for Macy's Day parade.
[3:49:36.520 --> 3:49:38.520]  Now there you go. Look.
[3:49:38.520 --> 3:49:40.520]  Look at the soldiers.
[3:49:40.520 --> 3:49:42.520]  Look at these young guys.
[3:49:42.520 --> 3:49:45.520]  Look how young they are.
[3:49:45.520 --> 3:49:47.520]  You don't see them fighting.
[3:49:47.520 --> 3:49:51.520]  Took off their helmets and joined the crowd.
[3:49:51.520 --> 3:49:55.520]  They don't want to fight.
[3:49:55.520 --> 3:49:57.520]  When I was at the rally in the city,
[3:49:57.520 --> 3:50:01.520]  at Columbus Circle, the cops wouldn't bother us.
[3:50:01.520 --> 3:50:04.520]  The Kingston police were having my rallies over.
[3:50:04.520 --> 3:50:06.520]  They don't bother me.
[3:50:06.520 --> 3:50:09.520]  They're men and women.
[3:50:09.520 --> 3:50:12.520]  But then you got the little tough little COVID cops over there
[3:50:12.520 --> 3:50:14.520]  in Australia and France and other places in Germany
[3:50:14.520 --> 3:50:17.520]  beating the hell out of people.
[3:50:17.520 --> 3:50:20.520]  Anyway, marches must get vaccinated.
[3:50:20.520 --> 3:50:23.520]  Marches for Macy's Day parade.
[3:50:23.520 --> 3:50:27.520]  I mentioned how they're locking down New Zealand,
[3:50:27.520 --> 3:50:29.520]  keeping people in the house.
[3:50:29.520 --> 3:50:32.520]  They don't get the virus outside.
[3:50:32.520 --> 3:50:34.520]  The facts are there.
[3:50:34.520 --> 3:50:36.520]  I'm not making them up.
[3:50:36.520 --> 3:50:38.520]  It's less than one percent.
[3:50:38.520 --> 3:50:42.520]  We wrote about it in the Trends Journal with scientific data
[3:50:42.520 --> 3:50:44.520]  and not at all.
[3:50:44.520 --> 3:50:47.520]  Not at all criticized by the
[3:50:47.520 --> 3:50:52.520]  Centers of Disease Control and Prevention.
[3:50:52.520 --> 3:50:58.520]  So I want to talk a little bit about the economy.
[3:50:58.520 --> 3:51:00.520]  We just had five days down.
[3:51:00.520 --> 3:51:02.520]  Today, the market's up.
[3:51:02.520 --> 3:51:04.520]  They're going to rig the market.
[3:51:04.520 --> 3:51:06.520]  The plunge protection team is going to come in.
[3:51:06.520 --> 3:51:09.520]  This thing's going down.
[3:51:09.520 --> 3:51:13.520]  As I said, 10 o'clock, the streets are empty.
[3:51:13.520 --> 3:51:20.520]  Airlines low expectations for profits as business slows.
[3:51:20.520 --> 3:51:22.520]  All right.
[3:51:22.520 --> 3:51:28.520]  Business travel is way down.
[3:51:28.520 --> 3:51:31.520]  Trade shows, conventions.
[3:51:31.520 --> 3:51:33.520]  How about all the businesses?
[3:51:33.520 --> 3:51:36.520]  How about the tax revenue that comes in that's supported
[3:51:36.520 --> 3:51:38.520]  by trade shows and conventions?
[3:51:38.520 --> 3:51:40.520]  Gone.
[3:51:40.520 --> 3:51:42.520]  Gone.
[3:51:42.520 --> 3:51:46.520]  The hotel, hospitality sector,
[3:51:46.520 --> 3:51:48.520]  souvenirs, all the stuff, theaters,
[3:51:48.520 --> 3:51:57.520]  people going entertainment, finished.
[3:51:57.520 --> 3:52:00.520]  Yep.
[3:52:00.520 --> 3:52:02.520]  As recently as late July,
[3:52:02.520 --> 3:52:06.520]  airlines look to be on track for a rapid rebound
[3:52:06.520 --> 3:52:10.520]  from the crisis that brought air travel to a standstill
[3:52:10.520 --> 3:52:14.520]  when the COVID-19 hit in 2020.
[3:52:14.520 --> 3:52:23.520]  Now, Benito, here's another one for you.
[3:52:23.520 --> 3:52:26.520]  Wall Street Journal.
[3:52:26.520 --> 3:52:29.520]  Last week, this Wednesday,
[3:52:29.520 --> 3:52:33.520]  office occupancy fell in August.
[3:52:33.520 --> 3:52:36.520]  Go back to 2020.
[3:52:36.520 --> 3:52:38.520]  Remember they were going to flatten the curve?
[3:52:38.520 --> 3:52:42.520]  Remember that BS, they were spewing out of their crappy mouths?
[3:52:42.520 --> 3:52:44.520]  That little arrogant, arrogant,
[3:52:44.520 --> 3:52:46.520]  arrogant daddy's boy Cuomo,
[3:52:46.520 --> 3:52:48.520]  that got so goddamn new,
[3:52:48.520 --> 3:52:51.520]  some little gruesome piece of crap.
[3:52:51.520 --> 3:52:54.520]  And how about the wine over there in Ohio?
[3:52:54.520 --> 3:52:58.520]  And Witless Whitmere?
[3:52:58.520 --> 3:53:00.520]  Yeah, the curve.
[3:53:00.520 --> 3:53:01.520]  Flatten the curve.
[3:53:01.520 --> 3:53:03.520]  Flatten your brain.
[3:53:03.520 --> 3:53:05.520]  Now, it'll come back.
[3:53:05.520 --> 3:53:07.520]  Everybody swallowed the crap.
[3:53:07.520 --> 3:53:09.520]  It'll come back.
[3:53:09.520 --> 3:53:14.520]  And we're saying that by Labor Day of 2020,
[3:53:14.520 --> 3:53:16.520]  people would be back at work.
[3:53:16.520 --> 3:53:17.520]  It didn't happen.
[3:53:17.520 --> 3:53:19.520]  Look at these freaks.
[3:53:19.520 --> 3:53:22.520]  How gutless can people be
[3:53:22.520 --> 3:53:25.520]  to look up to this class of clowns?
[3:53:25.520 --> 3:53:27.520]  You look at that one they were playing before,
[3:53:27.520 --> 3:53:30.520]  that glad it's been jerking around over there
[3:53:30.520 --> 3:53:33.520]  in New South Wales.
[3:53:33.520 --> 3:53:34.520]  You look at them.
[3:53:34.520 --> 3:53:37.520]  How can anybody who follow them?
[3:53:37.520 --> 3:53:39.520]  There's a little boy over there in Australia,
[3:53:39.520 --> 3:53:42.520]  little Danny Andrews.
[3:53:42.520 --> 3:53:45.520]  How could people take orders from these pieces of crap?
[3:53:45.520 --> 3:53:48.520]  Again, you don't have to take the trip
[3:53:48.520 --> 3:53:51.520]  on the boat to see the whales.
[3:53:51.520 --> 3:53:53.520]  You're on land and sea.
[3:53:53.520 --> 3:53:54.520]  Look at it.
[3:53:54.520 --> 3:53:57.520]  How can anybody listen to this thing?
[3:53:57.520 --> 3:54:00.520]  Oh, she got caught screwing around with a married guy, too.
[3:54:00.520 --> 3:54:02.520]  Look at this little boy.
[3:54:02.520 --> 3:54:05.520]  Look at this little clown of nothing.
[3:54:05.520 --> 3:54:08.520]  Can you imagine anybody taking orders from them?
[3:54:08.520 --> 3:54:10.520]  And they are.
[3:54:10.520 --> 3:54:13.520]  They lost the fight.
[3:54:13.520 --> 3:54:19.520]  The office occupancy rate.
[3:54:19.520 --> 3:54:22.520]  You ready?
[3:54:22.520 --> 3:54:25.520]  In New York City,
[3:54:25.520 --> 3:54:29.520]  it's 22 percent.
[3:54:29.520 --> 3:54:31.520]  In San Francisco,
[3:54:31.520 --> 3:54:34.520]  where all the geeky freaks started this thing,
[3:54:34.520 --> 3:54:36.520]  they were the first ones to call,
[3:54:36.520 --> 3:54:43.520]  stay at home because they made all this dough, the high tech.
[3:54:43.520 --> 3:54:45.520]  20 percent.
[3:54:45.520 --> 3:54:47.520]  20 percent.
[3:54:47.520 --> 3:54:49.520]  So now you're looking at,
[3:54:49.520 --> 3:54:52.520]  it's around 33 percent now.
[3:54:52.520 --> 3:54:54.520]  Offices in 10 major U.S. cities
[3:54:54.520 --> 3:54:56.520]  were just 33 percent
[3:54:56.520 --> 3:54:58.520]  in the week ending, August 25th.
[3:54:58.520 --> 3:55:02.520]  So let's say they go up to 40 percent.
[3:55:02.520 --> 3:55:05.520]  We'll be optimistic.
[3:55:05.520 --> 3:55:07.520]  It'll come back.
[3:55:07.520 --> 3:55:12.520]  All the businesses that depend on commuters.
[3:55:12.520 --> 3:55:16.520]  All of them.
[3:55:16.520 --> 3:55:18.520]  All the restaurants.
[3:55:18.520 --> 3:55:20.520]  All the shops.
[3:55:20.520 --> 3:55:23.520]  All the theaters that depend on tourism.
[3:55:23.520 --> 3:55:27.520]  Business travel.
[3:55:27.520 --> 3:55:29.520]  Gone.
[3:55:29.520 --> 3:55:33.520]  The economy is going to go down hard and it's going to go down heavy.
[3:55:33.520 --> 3:55:36.520]  They're doing everything they can to rig the markets.
[3:55:36.520 --> 3:55:37.520]  It's a fact.
[3:55:37.520 --> 3:55:39.520]  I didn't make up the plunge protection team.
[3:55:39.520 --> 3:55:44.520]  I didn't make up the, that J.P. Morgan Chase rigged the precious metals markets.
[3:55:44.520 --> 3:55:46.520]  These are facts.
[3:55:46.520 --> 3:55:51.520]  You better prepare for the future.
[3:55:51.520 --> 3:55:53.520]  This is a time for preparedness.
[3:55:53.520 --> 3:55:56.520]  When the winter hits, this thing's going to go down hard.
[3:55:56.520 --> 3:55:59.520]  I drove down to Jersey Turnpike.
[3:55:59.520 --> 3:56:01.520]  Went to state at the Hilton.
[3:56:01.520 --> 3:56:02.520]  I read papers every day.
[3:56:02.520 --> 3:56:04.520]  Outline all the salient points.
[3:56:04.520 --> 3:56:10.520]  Tons of stuff I read, right?
[3:56:10.520 --> 3:56:12.520]  No newspapers.
[3:56:12.520 --> 3:56:14.520]  Couldn't find them.
[3:56:14.520 --> 3:56:16.520]  People don't know what's going on.
[3:56:16.520 --> 3:56:17.520]  Sorry.
[3:56:17.520 --> 3:56:21.520]  You don't get the same online as you get when you're reading hard copy.
[3:56:21.520 --> 3:56:23.520]  It's in front of you and you're doing it.
[3:56:23.520 --> 3:56:26.520]  And it takes time to print it out and read it if you're doing something else.
[3:56:26.520 --> 3:56:28.520]  And you're not getting the big picture.
[3:56:28.520 --> 3:56:30.520]  You're only getting what you want.
[3:56:30.520 --> 3:56:32.520]  People have no clue what's going on.
[3:56:32.520 --> 3:56:34.520]  They're lost.
[3:56:34.520 --> 3:56:37.520]  And again, that's why you subscribe to The Trends Journal.
[3:56:37.520 --> 3:56:40.520]  We're political atheists.
[3:56:40.520 --> 3:56:43.520]  We look at the world for what it is, not the way we want it to be.
[3:56:43.520 --> 3:56:46.520]  And we make connections between different fields.
[3:56:46.520 --> 3:56:49.520]  So it's not one-sided.
[3:56:49.520 --> 3:56:51.520]  So do what you can to support infowars.
[3:56:51.520 --> 3:56:54.520]  And most importantly, most importantly,
[3:56:54.520 --> 3:56:59.520]  do what you can to rise to the highest level that you can.
[3:56:59.520 --> 3:57:01.520]  It's up to you.
[3:57:01.520 --> 3:57:04.520]  United we stand, divided we fall.
[3:57:04.520 --> 3:57:06.520]  Get in the best shape you can.
[3:57:06.520 --> 3:57:10.520]  Physically, emotionally, and spiritually.
[3:57:10.520 --> 3:57:12.520]  And helping you get in the best shape,
[3:57:12.520 --> 3:57:15.520]  you got some great products over there at Infowars.
[3:57:15.520 --> 3:57:18.520]  The future's in your hands.
[3:57:18.520 --> 3:57:19.520]  Don't drop it.
[3:57:19.520 --> 3:57:20.520]  We're all in this together.
[3:57:20.520 --> 3:57:22.520]  Thank you for tuning in.
[3:57:22.520 --> 3:57:51.520]  See you next week.
