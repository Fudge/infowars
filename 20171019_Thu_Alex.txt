[00:00.000 --> 00:10.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's already Thursday, October 19, 2017.
[00:10.400 --> 00:15.160]  The whole House of Cards on Hollywood pedophilia is now breaking in mainstream news.
[00:15.160 --> 00:20.240]  The whole House of Cards on how the Clintons, but also the leadership of the Democratic party
[00:20.240 --> 00:21.800]  were on the Russian payroll.
[00:21.800 --> 00:22.800]  It's all collapsing.
[00:22.800 --> 00:25.840]  This is going to be an incredibly important transmission.
[00:25.840 --> 00:29.040]  Let's kick it off with the one the only, John Bowne.
[00:29.040 --> 00:33.520]  Should the real power elite colluding with the Russians please stand up, the mainstream
[00:33.520 --> 00:39.080]  media is being forced to accept a heavily documented investigation into Russian corruption
[00:39.080 --> 00:40.920]  leading to Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[00:40.920 --> 00:46.880]  The Hill reports, before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010, giving
[00:46.880 --> 00:50.880]  Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium.
[00:50.880 --> 00:55.560]  The FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were
[00:55.560 --> 01:01.520]  engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir
[01:01.520 --> 01:06.480]  Putin's atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents
[01:06.480 --> 01:07.480]  and interviews.
[01:07.480 --> 01:13.160]  Obama's FBI under Mueller and then Comey, together with the Justice Department under
[01:13.160 --> 01:19.640]  Rod Rosenstein, essentially buried an investigation into Vadim Mikharin, the Russian negotiating
[01:19.640 --> 01:25.640]  the padded no bid contracts after the Obama administration alerted Congress by approving
[01:25.640 --> 01:33.160]  of the selling off of 20% of the United States uranium supply via Uranium One to Rosatom,
[01:33.160 --> 01:37.760]  and then allowed the same company, Rosatom, to sell the uranium in the United States while
[01:37.760 --> 01:43.320]  Bill Clinton received hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees for Russian audiences
[01:43.320 --> 01:47.920]  interested in the uranium deal, all under the watch of Hillary Clinton while she served
[01:47.920 --> 01:49.160]  as Secretary of State.
[01:49.160 --> 01:55.720]  We have the documents, we have the witnesses, we have the FBI reports that were given to
[01:55.720 --> 02:05.800]  Mueller and then to Comey that were completely and totally killed because Mueller's law firm
[02:05.800 --> 02:13.360]  and companies that Mueller sits on the boards of are heavily invested with state run mining
[02:13.360 --> 02:19.760]  and energy companies and gas companies and, wait for it, defense companies in Russia and
[02:19.760 --> 02:25.040]  it's in the FBI investigation, Hillary as a Secretary of State was signing waivers.
[02:25.040 --> 02:30.200]  A report suggests that the Clinton Foundation received millions of dollars for interested
[02:30.200 --> 02:32.720]  parties in the transaction.
[02:32.720 --> 02:38.520]  Bill Clinton received 500,000 for a speech in Moscow, June 2010 from the Russian government
[02:38.520 --> 02:45.040]  line bank, the same month as a speech Russia began the uranium acquisition process.
[02:45.040 --> 02:50.760]  This fact pattern raises serious concerns about improper political influence on the
[02:50.760 --> 02:58.800]  process by the previous, by the Clinton's during the Obama administration, has the Justice
[02:58.800 --> 03:03.880]  Department fully investigated whether the Russians compromise the Obama administration's
[03:03.880 --> 03:09.960]  decisions to smooth away for transactions and if not, why not?
[03:09.960 --> 03:14.320]  Mr. Chairman, we're working hard to maintain discipline in the department, it wouldn't
[03:14.320 --> 03:18.320]  be appropriate for me to comment on any ongoing investigation.
[03:18.320 --> 03:23.920]  The Department of Justice today, under President Trump, Attorney General Sessions, could tomorrow
[03:23.920 --> 03:28.080]  come back and say we are removing this gag order, that we believe that there's a compelling
[03:28.080 --> 03:33.720]  national interest to know, we want this individual to testify before Congress.
[03:33.720 --> 03:36.040]  We want the public to know exactly what went on.
[03:36.040 --> 03:39.960]  So this is not something that's unbreakable, but it just simply takes a request from the
[03:39.960 --> 03:42.960]  Department of Justice to remove that gag order.
[03:42.960 --> 03:46.600]  If that gag order is not removed, I think it's a doubtful this businessman is going
[03:46.600 --> 03:50.040]  to want to go public because he doesn't want to be put in legal jeopardy.
[03:50.040 --> 03:53.600]  Mickeran's use of extortion and bribery is well documented.
[03:53.600 --> 03:58.440]  Regardless, The Hill reports, the lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington
[03:58.440 --> 04:04.560]  with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security
[04:04.560 --> 04:06.720]  implications had been uncovered.
[04:06.720 --> 04:12.320]  On December 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mickeran, a
[04:12.320 --> 04:17.120]  former Russian official residing in Maryland, was sentenced today to 48 months in prison
[04:17.120 --> 04:20.840]  and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.
[04:20.840 --> 04:23.840]  No more fumbling around for the drain on the swamp.
[04:23.840 --> 04:30.240]  If there is any justice, congressional investigations and prosecution need to immediately follow
[04:30.240 --> 04:32.280]  up on all of this evidence.
[04:32.280 --> 04:37.320]  The FBI now has evidence that Russia for years has been doing this, and they're reporting
[04:37.320 --> 04:42.800]  the FBI has evidence that literally they used bribery to gain control over America's
[04:42.800 --> 04:46.880]  uranium industry, all while the Obama administration did nothing.
[04:46.880 --> 04:51.600]  And the Clintons benefited to the tune of nearly $145 million.
[04:51.600 --> 04:53.920]  You want a real Russia collusion story?
[04:53.920 --> 04:54.920]  We've got it.
[04:54.920 --> 04:57.360]  John Bowne reporting for Infowars.com.
[04:57.360 --> 05:05.360]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best
[05:05.360 --> 05:07.480]  selling product, Brainforce.
[05:07.480 --> 05:12.920]  Now Brainforce Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle, and we're now purchasing so much of
[05:12.920 --> 05:16.720]  it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able
[05:16.720 --> 05:17.720]  to get it for less.
[05:17.720 --> 05:22.880]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off, and I thought I could offer this for
[05:22.880 --> 05:23.880]  maybe a month.
[05:23.880 --> 05:30.080]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse
[05:30.080 --> 05:34.800]  because the fans of it, already you're stocking up, they know how great it is, a whole bunch
[05:34.800 --> 05:38.920]  of organic, natural, healthy, known, new tropics.
[05:38.920 --> 05:44.240]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then Brainforce is for you and you're supporting
[05:44.240 --> 05:47.040]  the broadcast at the same time.
[05:47.040 --> 05:48.840]  It's a good deal at $39.
[05:48.840 --> 06:01.280]  It's 1996 at InfowarsLife.com, or simply call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[06:01.280 --> 06:28.280]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:28.280 --> 06:39.760]  It's the broadcast that I know are particularly historical and important, where I really attempt
[06:39.760 --> 06:46.800]  before we go live to just calm down and slow down before I turn into the Tasmanian Devil
[06:46.800 --> 06:50.280]  from Texas.
[06:50.280 --> 06:56.560]  Because anybody that's been listening for even a decade or 20 years knows I can be
[06:56.560 --> 07:02.520]  very negative, but people also know that I'm not going to tell you that we're winning
[07:02.520 --> 07:04.640]  if we're not winning.
[07:04.640 --> 07:11.920]  I'm not going to tell you that we're having spectacular victories by the day against the
[07:11.920 --> 07:15.760]  Globalist unless it's really happening.
[07:15.760 --> 07:21.800]  Now that said, I got a really good feeling and I got a really bad feeling, best of times,
[07:21.800 --> 07:26.320]  worst of times, the worlds of paradox, because the Globalists are going to strike back and
[07:26.320 --> 07:30.480]  they're going to strike back hard, and they've been striking back.
[07:30.480 --> 07:35.360]  But nevertheless, they are being routed.
[07:35.360 --> 07:40.680]  And I'm going to tell you who is the main icebreaker going through their lives.
[07:40.680 --> 07:48.960]  His name is Donald John Trump, and he's from New York City.
[07:48.960 --> 07:54.000]  And I just love the fact that the Globalists took over one of the most American cities,
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.980]  near Americana, and turned it into a Globalist command base, but that's the way God works.
[07:58.980 --> 08:04.360]  That city of corrupt globalism is now being retaken.
[08:04.360 --> 08:14.680]  Out of that Babylon comes a great man of change and courage who is the catalyst for devastating
[08:14.680 --> 08:16.080]  victories right now.
[08:16.080 --> 08:19.360]  I mean, Trump is leveling the playing field.
[08:19.360 --> 08:21.800]  He is doing two-way streets with China.
[08:21.800 --> 08:25.040]  He's taking care of American workers, our veterans.
[08:25.040 --> 08:26.600]  It's incredible.
[08:26.600 --> 08:31.800]  But everything Trump's strong on, they try to make his weakness.
[08:31.800 --> 08:36.920]  That's why he tries to get charities to give $25,000 to $50,000 to every veteran that's
[08:36.920 --> 08:47.560]  killed in combat, every active-duty soldier, sailor, marine, member of the Air Force.
[08:47.560 --> 08:51.200]  And that's why he tries to personally visit them or give them multiple phone calls.
[08:51.200 --> 08:56.200]  And because that's one of his big strengths, that he personally gives money or gets a charity
[08:56.200 --> 08:58.960]  to give money, they make it his weakness.
[08:58.960 --> 09:04.480]  That's what this whole scandal is with the few dead soldiers that happen to have Democrat
[09:04.480 --> 09:09.760]  party mothers who are political activists.
[09:09.760 --> 09:15.480]  And you just look at how they take his strength and they try to turn it into a weakness.
[09:15.480 --> 09:18.840]  And then my old friend Rick Linkletter said, you know, I don't know why Alex is against
[09:18.840 --> 09:24.800]  the power structure and against elites that suddenly so for Trump, in a big article, interview
[09:24.800 --> 09:34.320]  he did for BuzzFeed about his new film, Last Flag Standing, again, I'm teleprompter free.
[09:34.320 --> 09:38.400]  I'm going from memory on the name of the film.
[09:38.400 --> 09:40.720]  And what are you talking about?
[09:40.720 --> 09:50.120]  The global government, Hollywood, mainstream media, Silicon Valley, the big tech companies,
[09:50.120 --> 09:55.000]  the communist Chinese, the EU, who isn't against our president?
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  And who isn't against the American people?
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.440]  And who doesn't want to dominate and bully us into submission and sell off our jobs and
[10:01.440 --> 10:04.240]  our secrets and our ingenuity?
[10:04.240 --> 10:10.280]  You've got the whole globalist world trying to force us into TPP that would have transferred
[10:10.280 --> 10:17.560]  our sovereignty into a secret offshore combine.
[10:17.560 --> 10:22.920]  And Trump killed it the first week in office doing what he said he'd do and transferred
[10:22.920 --> 10:24.760]  the power back to Congress.
[10:24.760 --> 10:32.080]  The reason he could do that is Obama had done all these unconstitutional things through
[10:32.080 --> 10:33.240]  executive power.
[10:33.240 --> 10:34.240]  Nobody challenged him.
[10:34.240 --> 10:38.160]  So Trump's just killing it all with executive power.
[10:38.160 --> 10:41.400]  And they're harassing his tenants.
[10:41.400 --> 10:42.800]  They're harassing his members.
[10:42.800 --> 10:44.480]  They're harassing his family.
[10:44.480 --> 10:46.000]  They're harassing everyone he knows.
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.440]  They're basically suing thousands of people associated with him.
[10:49.440 --> 10:54.320]  They are including yours truly and Roger Stone and everybody else.
[10:54.320 --> 10:59.560]  They are coming after us because they'd stolen this country through fraud.
[10:59.560 --> 11:04.960]  And they're a bunch of parasites feeding on poor people and feeding on third world populations.
[11:04.960 --> 11:10.400]  And if Trump can deliver the American dream again, then their collectivism can't compete
[11:10.400 --> 11:14.040]  with that and it's game over.
[11:14.040 --> 11:15.920]  Just look at DrudgeReport.com.
[11:15.920 --> 11:18.400]  Bloomberg has to admit.
[11:18.400 --> 11:20.880]  Google Slayer.
[11:20.880 --> 11:27.680]  Trump picks antitrust simons for FTC, a lawyer known for busting trust.
[11:27.680 --> 11:29.800]  That is exactly what this country needs.
[11:29.800 --> 11:34.600]  And that's exactly what Mother Jones 100 years ago would have told she was needed.
[11:34.600 --> 11:36.520]  And not the Mother Jones of the day.
[11:36.520 --> 11:42.200]  That's a Goldman Sachs financed George Soros controlled fake leftist group.
[11:42.200 --> 11:50.960]  Teddy Roosevelt is the type of guy I would have called for this.
[11:50.960 --> 11:55.480]  You got Google with 90% control over search and a bunch of other functions and we got
[11:55.480 --> 12:01.120]  their executives on video admitting their search is fake now and that people have to
[12:01.120 --> 12:05.720]  pay for what they get and that they restrict populist conservatives, libertarians and even
[12:05.720 --> 12:06.720]  the president.
[12:06.720 --> 12:11.440]  And the head of Twitter says we might ban the president off Twitter.
[12:11.440 --> 12:15.240]  You can have Twitter accounts dedicated to killing the president and Twitter accounts
[12:15.240 --> 12:20.840]  dedicated to bankrupting info wars but you can't have the president speak out and call
[12:20.840 --> 12:26.160]  Comey a liar two months ago saying he ordered the investigation to stop but claimed it was
[12:26.160 --> 12:28.680]  still ongoing against Hillary.
[12:28.680 --> 12:32.560]  The memo came out two days ago, the president was correct.
[12:32.560 --> 12:37.320]  And when they looked at Conway and they said how do you know he was being spied on?
[12:37.320 --> 12:38.320]  How does he know?
[12:38.320 --> 12:43.400]  She goes he's the president, he knows things you don't know and of course it all came out
[12:43.400 --> 12:44.400]  just like he said.
[12:44.400 --> 12:47.880]  Gee, think the president can go look and see if he was spied on?
[12:47.880 --> 12:50.720]  But I don't need the president to do it.
[12:50.720 --> 12:53.240]  I was shit the federal documents.
[12:53.240 --> 12:57.000]  You notice the media didn't touch that.
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.360]  It was Trump's private phone numbers at his resorts in Florida and New Jersey and New
[13:03.360 --> 13:04.360]  York.
[13:04.360 --> 13:09.640]  I mean, and I knew they were his numbers because I had two of them.
[13:09.640 --> 13:10.640]  They've changed the number.
[13:10.640 --> 13:18.120]  I had the private number to his his apartment in Marlago to give them a call sometime.
[13:18.120 --> 13:20.360]  Trump likes you if you just try to call him.
[13:20.360 --> 13:24.360]  The media inside baseball knows that that's how they're able to get through to him as
[13:24.360 --> 13:25.360]  well.
[13:25.360 --> 13:28.880]  He thinks they're at night stills is answering the switchboard number.
[13:28.880 --> 13:32.360]  Citizens actually get the president sometimes and they're trying to stop him doing that.
[13:32.360 --> 13:38.240]  But he's a guy that runs hundreds of towers and resorts and golf courses.
[13:38.240 --> 13:39.800]  He's all about what do the people want?
[13:39.800 --> 13:41.960]  What do they do if the food isn't good at a resort?
[13:41.960 --> 13:42.960]  He throws a fit.
[13:42.960 --> 13:45.720]  If the right marble isn't put in, he throws a fit.
[13:45.720 --> 13:51.000]  He's OCD about that folks and he doesn't like seeing America get run into the ground and
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.080]  they don't know what to do.
[13:54.080 --> 13:55.080]  So he's not perfect.
[13:55.080 --> 13:56.520]  He gets bad advice sometimes.
[13:56.520 --> 14:01.000]  But you know a man by his enemies, they hate his guts because he's standing up for what's
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  right.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  Now we come back.
[14:03.000 --> 14:12.360]  Start your engines because mainstream news is having to report major publications like
[14:12.360 --> 14:17.160]  The Week and Others that the major pedophile scandal in Hollywood is the next level to
[14:17.160 --> 14:18.160]  break.
[14:18.160 --> 14:21.440]  Well, exactly as we told you months ago.
[14:21.440 --> 14:25.560]  When they talk about the award-winning film An Open Secret that's interviewed the witnesses
[14:25.560 --> 14:30.280]  and stars who were abused as children, they're going to be in studio tomorrow.
[14:30.280 --> 14:32.840]  Notice that mainstream news has got their ear to the ground.
[14:32.840 --> 14:35.680]  They knew we were about to break this tomorrow with them in studio.
[14:35.680 --> 14:43.080]  So notice it's now in major mainstream publications today and that's our job, forcing them to
[14:43.080 --> 14:49.240]  report Hollywood sex abuse film An Open Secret released online.
[14:49.240 --> 14:52.560]  It's been award-winning and very popular last year.
[14:52.560 --> 14:53.760]  It's been released online.
[14:53.760 --> 14:58.080]  We're going to play Big X, Serb Subbit tomorrow with the director of the producers, Ann Moore.
[14:58.080 --> 15:00.040]  They're arriving today in studio.
[15:00.040 --> 15:01.040]  Boom.
[15:01.040 --> 15:02.840]  Get ready for that.
[15:02.840 --> 15:06.880]  Corey Feldman hints at naming Hollywood pedophiles.
[15:06.880 --> 15:12.520]  We've been in talks to get him on the broadcast directly, reportedly raped by these people.
[15:12.520 --> 15:14.600]  So that's all coming up.
[15:14.600 --> 15:23.160]  Then the big news, we're going to get into the new Trump nominee to head up the Federal

[20:20.280 --> 20:31.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[20:31.920 --> 20:39.480]  Deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex
[20:39.480 --> 20:40.480]  Jones.
[20:40.480 --> 20:50.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, I do not have words to describe to you intellectually what I'm
[20:50.120 --> 20:54.920]  looking at right now and spiritually how I'm feeling.
[20:54.920 --> 21:00.440]  I feel really good, but I also know the enemy is rallying against humanity right now and
[21:00.440 --> 21:05.960]  it is in the process of preparing to strike back, so watch your six, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:05.960 --> 21:17.800]  I knew that Robert Mueller had delivered uranium in 2015 to the Russians illegally for Hillary.
[21:17.800 --> 21:23.640]  I knew that they had gotten hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that Robert Mueller
[21:23.640 --> 21:30.880]  is on the board of and that Mueller has worked for via his law firm.
[21:30.880 --> 21:33.600]  I knew that Comey was his minion.
[21:33.600 --> 21:39.320]  I knew that Mueller basically is still the head of the FBI to a great extent and put
[21:39.320 --> 21:44.680]  major stay behind networks in management positions who were basically part of the Clinton Foundation
[21:44.680 --> 21:46.520]  crime machine.
[21:46.520 --> 21:56.280]  We had guest after guest on covering all of that information.
[21:56.280 --> 22:01.240]  But now to see it in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, to now see the Attorney
[22:01.240 --> 22:10.600]  General say Hillary is being criminally investigated, to now see the lawyer for FBI operatives and
[22:10.600 --> 22:18.680]  FBI informants who were in Russia and in Europe and in DC and in New York witnessing the Democrats
[22:18.680 --> 22:25.600]  with photos and documents and videos of them sitting around, you know, like all the famous
[22:25.600 --> 22:29.920]  FBI videos you've seen where it's in the briefcase and they're sitting around doing arms deals.
[22:29.920 --> 22:34.840]  Same thing, high level Democrats on video.
[22:34.840 --> 22:39.560]  That's the big breaking news on infowars.com right now from Dr. Corsi putting all the information
[22:39.560 --> 22:45.120]  together.
[22:45.120 --> 22:53.800]  That this entire investigation started back in 2011 was finally killed in 2015 and that
[22:53.800 --> 23:03.360]  despite the fact that all that came out, they still allowed the Uranium One deal to transfer
[23:03.360 --> 23:07.560]  upwards of 30% of our highest quality uranium to the Russians.
[23:07.560 --> 23:10.000]  This is the headline on infowars.com.
[23:10.000 --> 23:18.480]  Documents show other Democrats, not just Clintons, on Russian payroll, Uranium One scandal threatens
[23:18.480 --> 23:20.920]  to bring down the entire Democratic Party.
[23:20.920 --> 23:30.160]  It's exactly what Roger Stone said in January of 2016 here on the air.
[23:30.160 --> 23:34.080]  And he was just doing the research himself from the Panama Papers that had come out a
[23:34.080 --> 23:38.040]  month before and from his sources in DC that confirmed it.
[23:38.040 --> 23:41.840]  And that woman who exposed it a year and a half ago, her car blew up.
[23:41.840 --> 23:47.200]  She died four days ago in Panama.
[23:47.200 --> 23:51.280]  Investigative journalist with major international syndicates dead, murdered.
[23:51.280 --> 23:57.440]  Her car was blown in pieces up to 50 yards away, just like Michael Hastings.
[23:57.440 --> 24:00.520]  But in California, they said it wasn't a car bomb even though it was.
[24:00.520 --> 24:04.560]  With her, they said, yeah, it's a car bomb.
[24:04.560 --> 24:05.560]  That was for Panama Papers.
[24:05.560 --> 24:06.560]  She was in Malta.
[24:06.560 --> 24:10.600]  Malta Carbomb kills Panama Papers journalist.
[24:10.600 --> 24:16.280]  So ladies and gentlemen, just think about how massive this information is and the courage
[24:16.280 --> 24:18.800]  of the people getting it out.
[24:18.800 --> 24:20.600]  And now you know why.
[24:20.600 --> 24:26.240]  Starting last January, Roger Stone was doing no exaggeration because he was coming visiting
[24:26.240 --> 24:27.240]  us here.
[24:27.240 --> 24:29.760]  He would do 15, 20 interviews a day.
[24:29.760 --> 24:30.760]  You couldn't go to dinner with him.
[24:30.760 --> 24:33.800]  He'd duck out, do 10 minute interviews, out in the parking lot of a steakhouse.
[24:33.800 --> 24:37.280]  Then you take a call from the president candidate at the time.
[24:37.280 --> 24:38.280]  It was pretty amazing.
[24:38.280 --> 24:40.040]  Here, talk to Trump.
[24:40.040 --> 24:46.920]  But what's incredible is that that's when they went, Roger Stone's a Russian agent.
[24:46.920 --> 24:52.480]  Even though in the 80s, Russians tried to contact him about secrets and he helped the
[24:52.480 --> 24:58.040]  FBI round up a bunch of Russians and US citizens who were indicted and convicted.
[24:58.040 --> 25:03.960]  Roger Stone came up under Nixon, the famous anti-communist and the Red Scare and Senator
[25:03.960 --> 25:06.120]  McCarthy.
[25:06.120 --> 25:09.240]  Roger Stone was around way back then.
[25:09.240 --> 25:14.000]  He's been doing this since he was 18 years old, the opposite of a communist.
[25:14.000 --> 25:20.560]  So what do you do when an old red hunter is on your Democratic Party butt?
[25:20.560 --> 25:24.000]  What do you do when a red hunter is on your tail?
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.040]  The bane of the Democratic Party since 1917, the Republicans have been on them for working
[25:29.040 --> 25:31.400]  with communists and working with the Russians.
[25:31.400 --> 25:36.080]  What are you going to do when people like Vice President Richard Nixon are on your
[25:36.080 --> 25:37.080]  tail?
[25:37.080 --> 25:44.240]  Don't forget, he was the Vice President for Eisenhower and came back, became president.
[25:44.240 --> 25:50.600]  What are you going to do when Nixon's later best friend, Roger Stone, the red hunter is
[25:50.600 --> 25:51.600]  on your butt?
[25:51.600 --> 25:55.080]  Roger Stone's a red, Roger's everybody's a red.
[25:55.080 --> 25:58.360]  Remember when they started saying on television, Tucker Carlson, when he doubted the official
[25:58.360 --> 26:00.520]  fake story about Russiagate?
[26:00.520 --> 26:03.240]  They said to Tucker Carlson, you better watch it, you're working for the Kremlin, you're
[26:03.240 --> 26:04.240]  on his payroll.
[26:04.240 --> 26:09.320]  And of course, if you know anything about Tucker Carlson's Blue Blood East Coast family,
[26:09.320 --> 26:13.160]  their Patriots, his dad was the head of Voice of America.
[26:13.160 --> 26:16.320]  You don't just think he was in the CIA, do you?
[26:16.320 --> 26:20.600]  And the rest of his family, and Tucker Carlson said, you better watch it right there.
[26:20.600 --> 26:23.160]  And that's why they started saying, I'm a Russian agent.
[26:23.160 --> 26:29.040]  And remember Rand Paul, we ought to go all these clips together, Rand Paul, McCain said,
[26:29.040 --> 26:36.720]  on the floor of the Senate is a Russian agent being paid by Vladimir Putin, total defamation,
[26:36.720 --> 26:40.520]  total slander, total desperate libel.
[26:40.520 --> 26:48.800]  And if you wonder why they're so desperate, ladies and gentlemen, it's because John McCain,
[26:48.800 --> 26:51.800]  it turned out, was involved with banks on the Russian payroll.
[26:51.800 --> 26:55.800]  And it turns out, Hillary and both Podesta brothers and a bunch of the Democratic Party
[26:55.800 --> 27:02.320]  and Dr. Jerome Corsi's article on infowars.com were in banks and in brokerage firms and in
[27:02.320 --> 27:05.440]  energy companies and in military companies.
[27:05.440 --> 27:09.780]  And Hillary was the head of the State Department for most of those eight years, and she was
[27:09.780 --> 27:15.800]  transferring everything out of the country because she could sign waivers and claim it
[27:15.800 --> 27:20.120]  was legal, but she kept it secret.
[27:20.120 --> 27:25.200]  And that's why they are in total and complete panic mode in DC right now.
[27:25.200 --> 27:33.480]  And that's why they have the whole media brand Trump and the Republicans and all of the rest
[27:33.480 --> 27:38.960]  of the resistance as Russian agents, because it's just like in an old spy movie, when you
[27:38.960 --> 27:44.520]  catch one spy, they go, no, they're the spies, it's them, it's them, with no proof.
[27:44.520 --> 27:48.840]  But then when Roger started exposing it, he was going to testify, he got shot in the back
[27:48.840 --> 27:53.600]  with a polonium dart, little gelatin darts that dissolve, but it deflected it, cut his
[27:53.600 --> 27:58.760]  back real bad in his backyard, hit him in his backyard, got real sick two days later
[27:58.760 --> 28:00.280]  and they tested it was polonium.
[28:00.280 --> 28:06.760]  And then a few weeks later, he's going to testify, they teabone his car and almost kill
[28:06.760 --> 28:12.200]  him and in some armored vehicle, you know, races off because they wanted to say it was
[28:12.200 --> 28:17.800]  all Roger stone so that a dead man couldn't resist them and a dead man couldn't speak
[28:17.800 --> 28:18.800]  out.
[28:18.800 --> 28:20.720]  So let me tell you something.
[28:20.720 --> 28:22.200]  They've been failing on every front.
[28:22.200 --> 28:27.840]  We come back, we're going to play these clips where the lawyers for the informants and the
[28:27.840 --> 28:33.240]  rest of it are getting ready to testify to Congress and they are in full panic mode.

[32:05.160 --> 32:08.360]  45 pitchfork because it's not what it seems.
[32:08.360 --> 32:13.680]  A new bombshell report from the hill reveals that the FBI had uncovered a Russian bribery
[32:13.680 --> 32:16.120]  plot way back in 2009.
[32:16.120 --> 32:21.120]  The FBI gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged
[32:21.120 --> 32:26.200]  in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin's
[32:26.200 --> 32:28.880]  atomic energy business inside the U.S.
[32:28.880 --> 32:33.800]  But they sat on the story for years allowing President Obama to sign a controversial deal
[32:33.800 --> 32:38.680]  in 2010 giving Russia control of 20% of U.S. uranium.
[32:38.680 --> 32:43.960]  The report confirms the Russians routed millions of dollars into the U.S. to support this scheme
[32:43.960 --> 32:47.640]  via charitable donations to the Clinton Foundation.
[32:47.640 --> 32:52.760]  Plus special counsel Robert Mueller sat on the committee alongside Hillary Clinton which
[32:52.760 --> 32:57.640]  rubber stamped the sale of uranium despite knowing about Russian racketeering.
[32:57.640 --> 33:02.200]  Leanne McAdoo, infowars.com.
[33:02.200 --> 33:14.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:14.160 --> 33:18.160]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[33:18.160 --> 33:19.160]  You want answers?
[33:19.160 --> 33:20.160]  Well, so does he.
[33:20.160 --> 33:21.160]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[33:21.160 --> 33:40.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we now know why the Democrats were so desperate going back in
[33:40.040 --> 33:49.160]  early 2016 claiming that Tucker Carlson, myself, Senator Rand Paul, Roger Stone, Donald Trump
[33:49.160 --> 33:52.800]  his whole family were basically Russian agents.
[33:52.800 --> 33:57.560]  It's because that's what they were fearing most because there had been criminal investigations
[33:57.560 --> 34:05.040]  going on in 2011 to 2015 that Mueller and Comey had ordered killed.
[34:05.040 --> 34:08.160]  Now the informants, the FBI agents, they're all coming out.
[34:08.160 --> 34:13.880]  They're now having congressional hearings and many experts agree this could take the
[34:13.880 --> 34:19.600]  Democratic Party that's already just a coastal elite party and extinct the party.
[34:19.600 --> 34:26.480]  This is so big, ladies and gentlemen, that it's hard to calculate but that's why they're
[34:26.480 --> 34:30.080]  fighting for their lives because they thought Hillary would get in, they thought the sellouts
[34:30.080 --> 34:34.720]  to communist China, to Saudi Arabia, to the EU, to the Russians, they thought it would
[34:34.720 --> 34:37.800]  never be known because they'd be in charge.
[34:37.800 --> 34:42.400]  Well now, ladies and gentlemen, they are blaming their enemies for what they've done, that
[34:42.400 --> 34:43.400]  old tactic.
[34:43.400 --> 34:50.160]  And it's been proven, Mueller delivering uranium illegally as a bag man to the KGB, FSB.
[34:50.160 --> 34:55.360]  You see, this is beyond the James Bond movie and it's all coming out.
[34:55.360 --> 34:59.720]  Everything we told you a year ago, but more, all the same reports but then the rest of
[34:59.720 --> 35:00.720]  the story.
[35:00.720 --> 35:04.720]  And I can't even believe how brazen it was, the Clinton Foundation.
[35:04.720 --> 35:07.960]  So let's go ahead and go to a few of these clips because this is threatening to bring
[35:07.960 --> 35:09.720]  down their whole system.
[35:09.720 --> 35:15.240]  This is Grassley and our Republican as Victoria Tosing, the lawyer representing a former FBI
[35:15.240 --> 35:18.840]  informant to allow her client, who says he worked as a voluntary informer of the FBI,
[35:18.840 --> 35:24.680]  to be allowed to testify about the investigation into uranium one that got killed.
[35:24.680 --> 35:30.000]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of that report with reporter Ms. Carter.
[35:30.000 --> 35:34.680]  Attorney Victoria Tunsey, she's representing that FBI informant at the center of the
[35:34.680 --> 35:36.720]  latest Clinton Foundation scandal.
[35:36.720 --> 35:38.400]  I'll start with you, Victoria.
[35:38.400 --> 35:39.440]  This is your client.
[35:39.440 --> 35:45.760]  He wanted to tell Congress about all the bribery, all the scheming, all the kickbacks, all the
[35:45.760 --> 35:46.760]  corruption.
[35:46.760 --> 35:48.400]  He had the information.
[35:48.400 --> 35:49.600]  He wanted to tell the story.
[35:49.600 --> 35:50.600]  What happened?
[35:50.600 --> 35:55.920]  Well, when he started working for the FBI in 2009, they had him sign what's called an
[35:55.920 --> 35:59.160]  NDA, a non-disclosure agreement.
[35:59.160 --> 36:05.520]  They never gave him a copy of it, and when he went public in 2016, way after all this
[36:05.520 --> 36:11.320]  case stuff was done, the Justice Department under Loretta Lynch called him and threatened
[36:11.320 --> 36:14.800]  him with his freedom if he violated the NDA.
[36:14.800 --> 36:19.680]  Now, I've never heard of an NDA that had a criminal penalty for violation, but they won't
[36:19.680 --> 36:21.600]  show him a copy of it.
[36:21.600 --> 36:28.160]  So we decided to go to the members of Congress and the Senate, and I have breaking news for
[36:28.160 --> 36:29.760]  you, Sean.
[36:29.760 --> 36:37.040]  While I was in makeup, I got a letter from Chairman Grassley asking my client to give
[36:37.040 --> 36:38.040]  them information.
[36:38.040 --> 36:44.640]  Now, what this does is set up a constitutional issue because the executive branch cannot
[36:44.640 --> 36:49.840]  say to someone, don't you give information to the legislature.
[36:49.840 --> 36:53.640]  So it'll be a very interesting thing to see how the Justice Department responds.
[36:53.640 --> 36:55.600]  So they have the power to lift that NDA.
[36:55.600 --> 36:56.600]  That would be amazing.
[36:56.600 --> 36:59.480]  And again, that's not even a national security letter.
[36:59.480 --> 37:04.360]  It's an NDA, and those don't cover criminal activities.
[37:04.360 --> 37:09.400]  Just like whistleblowing, even for classified stuff, if people are doing illegal stuff,
[37:09.400 --> 37:10.920]  you bring it to Congress.
[37:10.920 --> 37:15.920]  The problem is when they do, then deep state SWAT team raids them, like Bill Benny and
[37:15.920 --> 37:18.400]  many others that this has happened to.
[37:18.400 --> 37:19.400]  Let's go to the clip now.
[37:19.400 --> 37:24.400]  FBI uncovered Russian nuclear kickbacks months before the Iranian one deal passed.
[37:24.400 --> 37:28.960]  So the FBI investigation gets killed, even though it's under investigation, with the
[37:28.960 --> 37:33.560]  payoffs, money to the Podestas, to Hillary, to other Democrats.
[37:33.560 --> 37:35.040]  The FBI head kills it.
[37:35.040 --> 37:36.840]  The Justice Department kills it.
[37:36.840 --> 37:41.400]  They let the deal go through to give one-third of our uranium, and then witnesses to it get
[37:41.400 --> 37:44.120]  threatened with jail if they talk to Congress.
[37:44.120 --> 37:45.120]  Here it is.
[37:45.120 --> 37:49.960]  It's an issue before an agency called CIFIA, South Abed too.
[37:49.960 --> 37:57.120]  But that is the agency that decides whether foreign governments may buy U.S. companies
[37:57.120 --> 37:58.760]  or product.
[37:58.760 --> 38:06.880]  The Russian entity wanted to buy a company that had 20% of the American uranium, and
[38:06.880 --> 38:09.160]  it's called Uranium-1, which was the name of the company.
[38:09.160 --> 38:13.360]  And that issue was before CIFIA, so they were supposed to decide whether there was an OK
[38:13.360 --> 38:18.640]  deal, and whether there was any corruption or any kind of problems or national security
[38:18.640 --> 38:21.280]  issues regarding this purchase.
[38:21.280 --> 38:26.800]  And this was at the same time, correct, or during the same time, that your client was
[38:26.800 --> 38:30.520]  already providing information to the FBI?
[38:30.520 --> 38:36.560]  My client had been providing information for a couple of years before this, really got
[38:36.560 --> 38:37.960]  voted on by CIFIAs.
[38:37.960 --> 38:39.520]  And here's the rub.
[38:39.520 --> 38:45.520]  High ranking law enforcement officials in the Obama administration knew that there was
[38:45.520 --> 38:47.800]  corruption in this company.
[38:47.800 --> 38:54.160]  But that information about the corruption in this Russian entity never made it to CIFIAs
[38:54.160 --> 39:01.160]  evidently because CIFIAs authorized the purchase in October of 2010.
[39:01.160 --> 39:04.160]  That's a Cicero with the great reporter, Sarah Carter.
[39:04.160 --> 39:09.120]  Now, I don't want to toot our horn, but I want people to know the facts here.
[39:09.120 --> 39:14.960]  If you go back four and a half years ago, Tosh Plumlee, now retired CIA contractor, came
[39:14.960 --> 39:19.640]  on this broadcast and he said, Alex, Fast and Furious, Benghazi, all of it is about
[39:19.640 --> 39:24.360]  shipping arms to rebels for the Libya and now Syria war.
[39:24.360 --> 39:33.640]  And he had that from the U.S. Army, from NATO, and from others in the Middle East.
[39:33.640 --> 39:35.640]  And there it is from October 2014.
[39:35.640 --> 39:38.040]  Now, that's the third interview.
[39:38.040 --> 39:40.640]  Benghazi whistleblower tells all.
[39:40.640 --> 39:43.560]  He got Justice Department threats, you name it.
[39:43.560 --> 39:49.640]  And we lay out that Hillary, as Secretary of State, had the power to assign secret orders
[39:49.640 --> 39:54.360]  circumventing federal law, because of the previous law, that you could ship prohibited
[39:54.360 --> 39:59.240]  weapons or materials to states where it was prohibited or to groups where it was prohibited
[39:59.240 --> 40:01.400]  if she signed the letters.
[40:01.400 --> 40:05.840]  So you would give money as a terrorist group or a foreign government or a corporation to
[40:05.840 --> 40:11.440]  the Clinton Foundation, we have the emails, then they were then usually a few days.
[40:11.440 --> 40:14.840]  This is about a million dollars or more, just to meet with Hillary was a couple hundred
[40:14.840 --> 40:18.920]  thousand, or to have her be given your email or request.
[40:18.920 --> 40:21.920]  So first you give a couple hundred thousand just to have her agree to talk to you.
[40:21.920 --> 40:26.680]  Then you give a million, ask them for what you want, and almost always you got it.
[40:26.680 --> 40:30.120]  Didn't matter if it was anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, didn't matter what
[40:30.120 --> 40:34.600]  it was, and if you paid enough, they would have it, then the orders of the State Department,
[40:34.600 --> 40:40.360]  which controls the Pentagon to a great extent, and the MCIA, they would then deliver that
[40:40.360 --> 40:46.840]  to you on a C-130, and Tosh Blum we took parts in those flights, and he risked his life to
[40:46.840 --> 40:47.840]  tell you.
[40:47.840 --> 40:52.320]  Now he only knew part of it, very, very famous by the way, he was in the Bay of Pigs, but
[40:52.320 --> 40:56.960]  before that he was flying arms to Fidel Castro, this is in Congressional hearings, he was
[40:56.960 --> 41:00.640]  in the Frank Church Committee, he was in the Iran Conqueror Committee, you say, well how
[41:00.640 --> 41:02.040]  was he still in the CIA?
[41:02.040 --> 41:06.160]  Well there's dark hats and white hats, and because he's a whistleblower he was protected
[41:06.160 --> 41:12.080]  and until three years ago still flying flights, I mean he used to come on the show, leading
[41:12.080 --> 41:18.480]  groups of C-130s as the head, you know, as Commodore of the Skies, 15 C-130s lined up
[41:18.480 --> 41:22.320]  behind him about to fly to wherever, and he'd say, hold on Alex, I gotta tell him to wait
[41:22.320 --> 41:28.280]  10 minutes, I'm turning the engines off, I got my time zones, I got 10, 15 minutes for
[41:28.280 --> 41:34.680]  you, I mean there's interviews where he's on the tarmac flying whatever it is, and then
[41:34.680 --> 41:40.120]  on the air saying, we're flying high-impact kinetic weapons to the jihadis and nobody
[41:40.120 --> 41:44.440]  likes it, I'm not gonna say I'm doing it, but I've done it, I'm onboarding aircraft
[41:44.440 --> 41:48.320]  right now and we're really pissed about this Alex, and I don't care if they kill me, I'm
[41:48.320 --> 41:53.720]  gonna tell you, we need him on now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, not only say
[41:53.720 --> 41:57.040]  that because that busy producers are great, but I've kind of lately been running around
[41:57.040 --> 42:01.600]  saying Tosh Plumlee, Tosh Plumlee, because let me tell you, he is the one that broke
[42:01.600 --> 42:06.800]  it all, we stuck our necks out, and now everything you're hearing about Hillary, and exporting
[42:06.800 --> 42:12.520]  things to the State Department and those waivers, that is directly from the CIA and the Patriots
[42:12.520 --> 42:16.640]  in the CIA to Tosh Plumlee, they said, you're willing to get killed, you go ahead and you
[42:16.640 --> 42:22.680]  do it, but that is, I'm so proud of how he's a Texan, so there you go, now, briefly, we're

[45:59.040 --> 46:02.640]  Dr. Group you developed living defense for us, it took you over a year to do it, why
[46:02.640 --> 46:04.400]  is this so good?
[46:04.400 --> 46:09.000]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most,
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.680]  I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[46:13.680 --> 46:19.400]  my system but right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's
[46:19.400 --> 46:25.120]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[46:25.120 --> 46:29.600]  spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere, these are all
[46:29.600 --> 46:30.600]  parasites.
[46:30.600 --> 46:32.800]  Tell us about that all of a sudden there's so many things that are in it.
[46:32.800 --> 46:37.760]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, I recommend
[46:37.760 --> 46:40.440]  doing the parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[46:40.440 --> 46:43.720]  Alright well I'm glad we got some back in because I'm going back on it today, it just
[46:43.720 --> 46:48.280]  came back in yesterday, living defense, infowarslife.com and folks you can't lose, it's full of stuff
[46:48.280 --> 46:53.680]  that's great for your body period and you support the broadcast infowarslife.com, thank
[46:53.680 --> 46:57.120]  you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center, thank you so much for all your work sir on
[46:57.120 --> 47:01.720]  this great product.
[47:01.720 --> 47:21.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:21.440 --> 47:27.200]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[47:27.200 --> 47:34.320]  We're listening to Alex Jones, there's a reason when you get internal videos of top
[47:34.320 --> 47:41.000]  YouTube executives, directors of major operations that they say number one enemies Alex Jones,
[47:41.000 --> 47:49.320]  we must shut him down and it's not Alex Jones, it's that the Tosh Plumleys and the people
[47:49.320 --> 47:56.840]  like that that come on this broadcast four and a half years ago and laid out everything
[47:56.840 --> 48:02.000]  about Benghazi, specifically how they did it, why they killed the people, how they shipped
[48:02.000 --> 48:09.320]  the weapons, the anti-tank weapons, the anti-aircraft weapons out of there to Syria, how that war
[48:09.320 --> 48:16.120]  was coming, how Hillary quarterbacked the operation and reportedly the ambassador wouldn't
[48:16.120 --> 48:19.640]  go along with it so they let him come and kill him.
[48:19.640 --> 48:23.440]  That's why they told him evacuate the bases and some of the folks didn't get the message
[48:23.440 --> 48:29.680]  to evacuate so they were there and took on 300, 400 jihadis, killing most of them, oh
[48:29.680 --> 48:38.640]  I'm too bad for the globalist, four people survived, you see?
[48:38.640 --> 48:44.360]  But even before that happened they were already flying into the jihadis weapons and the C-130s
[48:44.360 --> 48:50.080]  would land and see people with al-Qaeda flags.
[48:50.080 --> 48:54.120]  This was first here and then later Rand Paul talked about it, Ted Cruz's credit said we're
[48:54.120 --> 48:59.600]  not al-Qaeda's air force and all of that broke and John McCain remember, he was over in the
[48:59.600 --> 49:05.200]  Middle East meeting with the quote, leaders of the rebels who were al-Qaeda so then when
[49:05.200 --> 49:10.960]  the public woke up to that four years ago they changed the name to ISIS which is just
[49:10.960 --> 49:16.840]  the name of the Islamic state to confuse the public that they wanted to make out of Syria,
[49:16.840 --> 49:23.280]  of Syria and part of Iraq, part of eastern Syria, western Iraq.
[49:23.280 --> 49:29.040]  And our military and good people in the deep state said no to that plan and four and a
[49:29.040 --> 49:34.840]  half years ago General Dempsey went and met with Obama and said we are not going to have
[49:34.840 --> 49:39.200]  a military strike from the air on Syria, we're going to work with the Russians to contain
[49:39.200 --> 49:43.640]  the civil war and end it and then Assad will step down after elections in the future when
[49:43.640 --> 49:45.600]  the war is over.
[49:45.600 --> 49:50.600]  Now you see Trump putting pressure on Iran, we made a deal with you in the Russians four
[49:50.600 --> 49:55.160]  and a half years ago, our military did bypassing Obama, you're now going to pull out of there
[49:55.160 --> 49:58.400]  and we're going to have elections and Assad is going to step down, we're going to put
[49:58.400 --> 50:02.120]  sanctions on you and if you want to attack our troops in Syria, that's what all this
[50:02.120 --> 50:04.920]  really is, we're going to go to war with you.
[50:04.920 --> 50:10.200]  We made a deal with you, the American people and the folks that put Trump in from the good
[50:10.200 --> 50:14.480]  side of the deep state, you're going to follow that agreement, no more backstabbing, no more
[50:14.480 --> 50:23.480]  weasel stuff, if Gaddafi would have made a deal 10 years ago like he did with Obama
[50:23.480 --> 50:27.000]  to come in out of the cold and work with the West, Trump wouldn't have double-crossed him.
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.280]  See America used to be known until about the mid-60s, if we made a deal with you we followed
[50:31.280 --> 50:33.200]  it.
[50:33.200 --> 50:38.200]  Now we cheat you on the deal and we've lost our soft power, now what does Joe Biden hope
[50:38.200 --> 50:43.160]  to do as the Russia gate comes out and is a democratic, his son in Ukraine got control
[50:43.160 --> 50:48.240]  of a $4 billion a year company that controls the Russian gas coming in, they jack up the
[50:48.240 --> 50:53.120]  prices and then rob Europe, the profits of the company have gone off the charts, he personally
[50:53.120 --> 51:00.520]  reportedly is getting hundreds of millions of dollars a year, his son by the way just
[51:00.520 --> 51:07.280]  got out of college a few years ago and is now a viceroy sitting on the Russian gas that
[51:07.280 --> 51:13.920]  has to go through Ukraine into Eastern and Western Europe, so they seized control of
[51:13.920 --> 51:20.880]  the switching pipes and the conduits that Ukraine had that come out of Russia and what's
[51:20.880 --> 51:26.640]  he say, we're going to play the video, Biden urges Obama holdovers to stay put, they all
[51:26.640 --> 51:33.000]  call me all the time, I say please stay, please stay, what do you think Eric Holder did and
[51:33.000 --> 51:39.040]  Loretta Lynch and Robert Mueller and James Comey, they all put stay behind networks in
[51:39.040 --> 51:45.520]  and here he is speaking with Ohio Governor John Kasich, University of Delaware, here's
[51:45.520 --> 51:49.960]  the clip of them admittedly staying, we're staying in government, we're going to overthrow
[51:49.960 --> 51:55.720]  Trump, we're never going to stop and here's an article exclusive to news wars dot com
[51:55.720 --> 52:02.120]  by Dan Lyman does a great job, deep state making US a failed state, top judicial watch
[52:02.120 --> 52:06.880]  investigator sounds alarm, deep state is a giant socialist organ protecting itself,
[52:06.880 --> 52:13.040]  he said, it's a cancer, McCain says American patriotism is bad this week, now we've got
[52:13.040 --> 52:18.400]  Biden urging people to stay put, to resist, to not follow orders, to not do what you're
[52:18.400 --> 52:23.480]  supposed to do, to block a making America great again, let's play that clip, here is
[52:23.480 --> 52:41.640]  Jim Aiden who still thinks he's the vice president, hit pause, they've got people shooting
[52:41.640 --> 52:46.960]  congressmen, they've got democratic strategist on TV saying hunt republicans, they've got
[52:46.960 --> 52:51.920]  Hollywood saying kill Trump, they've got Phil Mudd former deputy director of the CIA and
[52:51.920 --> 52:56.880]  deputy director of the FBI put in by Comey and Mueller as a Mueller minion, because Mueller
[52:56.880 --> 53:01.440]  Comey then Mudd saying we're going to kill the president soon and then you say someone
[53:01.440 --> 53:05.840]  saying Obamacare doesn't cover illegal aliens when it was in the bill and the congressman
[53:05.840 --> 53:11.960]  says you lie and you said they're about basic norms, we have basic norms, we're going to
[53:11.960 --> 53:15.840]  sexualize your three year olds and teach them how to be sexually screwed up and we're
[53:15.840 --> 53:20.080]  going to ship HIV blood all over the country and give that to you in hepatitis and we're
[53:20.080 --> 53:24.320]  going to tell you two plus two equals five and we're going to get rid of our sovereignty
[53:24.320 --> 53:28.840]  and treat our veterans like crap and have the VA cut their funding off and have the
[53:28.840 --> 53:34.160]  Thomas computer at IBM decide who gets healthcare and who doesn't as a death panel, they're
[53:34.160 --> 53:38.080]  now using Thomas computers, the national health service in England and if you were ever a
[53:38.080 --> 53:43.360]  smoker you don't get any surgery or healthcare now, could have been 20 years ago, if you're
[53:43.360 --> 53:48.200]  a drinker you don't get any surgery but Thomas the little Nazi IBM computer named after a
[53:48.200 --> 53:53.840]  Nazi, you can't make that up, literally, with all this run by a former Nazi collaborator
[53:53.840 --> 53:59.680]  who the ADL gives awards to, you can't make this, you can't make this up and he's going
[53:59.680 --> 54:03.360]  to tell us, back it up, let's start from the beginning again, he's going to tell us folks
[54:03.360 --> 54:06.720]  about norms, here I'm going to try to shut up during this, just everything he says is
[54:06.720 --> 54:12.440]  a lie, let's hear from this lying sack of anti-American parasitic garbage about how
[54:12.440 --> 54:17.760]  we need to core them and lay down all these people bankrupt the country, here it is.
[54:17.760 --> 54:24.760]  In some who would yell at a state of the union, liars, these are basic norms, there's a reason
[54:24.760 --> 54:25.760]  why.
[54:25.760 --> 54:30.080]  I'm sorry, pause again, it took me three and a half hours to get into the inauguration
[54:30.080 --> 54:33.480]  because there were Democrats, it's all on video, beating up men, women and children
[54:33.480 --> 54:38.200]  outside and assaulting everyone, the next day they had their George Soros women's march
[54:38.200 --> 54:45.000]  led by Linda Sorcerer, the admitted jihadi Islamist, Palestinian activist with a hat
[54:45.000 --> 54:50.520]  for family and prison in the Middle East for their activities, you could all go have your
[54:50.520 --> 54:54.480]  demonstration couldn't you, but we couldn't go see our president inaugurated because
[54:54.480 --> 54:58.840]  you're a bunch of thugs, play the clip about decorum, here it is.
[54:58.840 --> 55:05.560]  Norms, they're the arbiter of how we work together, so the thing that I find the most
[55:05.560 --> 55:11.840]  debilitating about what's going on now is the destruction of these norms and it's generating
[55:11.840 --> 55:19.480]  chaos, it's generating chaos internally, I don't want to see the chief of staff quit,
[55:19.480 --> 55:25.720]  I don't want to see the secretary of defense or the secretary of state quit, I don't want,
[55:25.720 --> 55:29.680]  all the people who are in our administration who are still there, they call me all the
[55:29.680 --> 55:36.160]  time I say please stay, please stay, please parasites, there has to be some competence
[55:36.160 --> 55:43.080]  we're going to win, again it's not even about the issues, it's about the norms, I'll conclude
[55:43.080 --> 55:48.800]  by saying, that's enough, you don't say, that's enough of that piece of garbage, he's so nice,
[55:48.800 --> 55:52.640]  we're being so friendly when we hit people in the head with bike locks and we call for
[55:52.640 --> 55:57.500]  violence and we have our surrogates say all whites are inherently evil and no white day
[55:57.500 --> 56:02.600]  at major colleges and while we push all this stuff and while we push war and say we're
[56:02.600 --> 56:06.360]  the resistance and say we're going to kill the president and have all of our minions
[56:06.360 --> 56:15.280]  say it and then see they want us to get calm again, just like Ted Bundy, the serial killer
[56:15.280 --> 56:18.600]  would just say it's going to be okay, just put the handcuffs on, I'm not going to kill
[56:18.600 --> 56:23.600]  you, just put the gag on, as soon as they did that he'd say you're so stupid, I'm going
[56:23.600 --> 56:29.000]  to torture you to death for weeks or I'm going to bite chunks out of your body, you're such
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.000]  a dumb idiot and he's just saying settle down, just get in the basement, just put the handcuffs
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.240]  on, he's standing there in a room without a weapon, he says put the handcuffs on, you're
[56:38.240 --> 56:42.080]  like yes master, let me put the handcuffs on and Biden's down, come down here, I'm going
[56:42.080 --> 56:46.960]  to strap you onto this bloody gurney, never mind the dirty clothes and you know that woman
[56:46.960 --> 56:52.400]  hanging on a me hook right there and just be normal, talk like I talk, be politically
[56:52.400 --> 56:57.240]  correct, submit, be passive because I'm going to hurt you politically bad, I'm going to
[56:57.240 --> 57:02.120]  do the equivalent of torture you for six months and rip your teeth out with pliers and I'm
[57:02.120 --> 57:05.480]  going to tell you how great it is while I do it, these are the monstrous pig demons
[57:05.480 --> 57:10.680]  we're dealing with and we see them, we're awake, we're not going back to sleep, jerk.

[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:20.560]  Rallying Patriots Worldwide in Defense of Human Liberty, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:27.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are witnessing what is the end of globalism, we're witnessing
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:33.720]  the end of the Democratic Party, we're witnessing the takeover of the Republican Party, are
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:41.240]  we about to enter some type of nirvana, a Valhalla, a Utopia, far from it, at the deep
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:49.400]  centralized power of unelected globalist combines, seeking diplomatic and corporate
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:01:01.800]  tax exemption and immunity, is burning down before our eyes, it's beyond the archaic
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:08.280]  garbage that is royalty, but at least someone in that clan, someone in that tribe, someone
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:15.360]  in that group, had led people to success and cultural and military victory, but then it
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:21.480]  would always become decadent corrupt, even in the better societies that forced the royal
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:25.480]  bloodlines to be at the front of the battles, as soon as royalty stopped being at the front
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:31.800]  of the battles it became the cancer, but now global corporations tax exempt, taking control
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:37.220]  of governments to sup dry populations and then have a rearguard action of political
[01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:43.280]  correctness, getting everybody to racially fight with each other, that's all this is,
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.840]  and it's in the WikiLeaks and it's in the government documents, how's the Jeff Bezos
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:54.240]  worth a hundred billion dollars himself, sitting on top of a trillion dollar company, who's
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.120]  got the laws written where he gets a dollar forty eight for every package, a taxpayer
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.920]  money given to him, so he can leverage out even the Chinese slave factories and leverage
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:09.160]  out even Walmart, even the other big fat parasites, now he spends hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:14.600]  a year, it's chump change to create division, sexual division, cultural division, to fund
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.800]  black lives matter, and so does Google and Facebook and Twitter, and so does IBM, every
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:25.520]  stinking one of them, not because they're liberals, they're executives or some of the
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:32.040]  most hardcore anti-human people, they're beyond races, they're so elitist that their
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:40.240]  factories are always amongst the most vicious and hateful, mass suicides and just forced
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:49.240]  drugging and abortion, because they want people poor and under full control, they do not want
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:55.120]  to build economies that are sustainable and successful to build families, they want a
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:04.360]  post industrial world with a bunch of poor people, brutal conditions in Amazon's warehouses
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:13.120]  threaten to ruin the company's image, yeah but that's nothing ladies and gentlemen, it's
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:18.240]  like California, they legalize giving people HIV or hepatitis, but twenty years ago they
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:29.560]  passed Prop 65 where the USDA and the FDA say that lead is dangerous at one thousand
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:40.480]  times what California says it's dangerous, the EU is 250 times higher, there's more
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:47.720]  lead in the air, but then California passes a law exempting basically California businesses,
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:54.000]  they pay a $500 fine, but then no one outside of the states basically exempt, I mean this
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.720]  is parasitic behavior written into a state law to launch attacks against all the other
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:09.880]  states, who thinks like that, George Soros, he funds a lot of it, and then what happens,
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:13.360]  you can't have jobs anywhere in America, that's why in California they've got signs
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:20.840]  on every major building and in restaurants, this food, the steaks, chicken broth has twice
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:25.720]  naturally in the bones the level of what they say is lead, the spectrometers can hardly
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:33.160]  even pick it up, but they don't care because they are exempt, just like the EU bureaucrats
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:39.800]  are exempt from the laws and the regulations and the taxes, look it up, it's the new royalty
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:45.560]  and guess what, we're going to educate the public about it, jerks, and then when we're
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:52.920]  done, you're all going to be sued out of existence and thrown in jail, think about
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:05:01.880]  the pink slime scam buddies and get ready, protect your skin with SPF 30 sunscreen lotion

[49:39.740 --> 01:06:56.780]  ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow in studio, you're going to witness a controlled demolition
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:05.200]  of the Hollywood pedophile elite, you're going to witness the detonation cap being
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:13.440]  struck, you're going to watch the beginning of their absolute total collapse, they are
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:22.960]  your sworn enemy, they are the diseased brain of the globalist, hell bent on destroying
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:29.400]  culture for absolute complete domination, they are so mentally ill and so incredibly
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:35.480]  competitive that they see your prosperity as evil, they don't see overall prosperity
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:43.920]  as their collective prosperity, they see it as a horrible affront to them, that's why
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:49.240]  they push collectivism that we've seen ravage every country that ever tried it, and here
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:59.140]  we are 100 years into the great experiment of Marxist-Leninist ideology and 220 plus
[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:06.300]  million dead we know of at the hands of communism, fascism and all other government exterminations
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:17.880]  we know of are only another 60 million, communism accounts for over 80% of death by government
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:26.160]  in the last 100 years since the voluptuous in the eyes of the globalist sickening anti-Christian
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:35.240]  anti-family, anti-god bloodbath, orgy of carnage and death that is the great vampiric
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:45.520]  red terror suckling on the blood of your children, that's who they are, and they wish to suckle
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:50.520]  on America and they've already suckled on our jobs, our industry, our technologies,
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:55.280]  our inventions and used it to buy off and enslave most of the world while hanging around
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:03.480]  our neck, the laurel of the tyranny, while they themselves preach hatred of the host,
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:12.720]  the great creature that they rode, yes America has been a power slave of the globalist but
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:19.680]  now globalism is in freefall worldwide, coming up Millie Weaver who was a model and in some
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:26.440]  films things out in Hollywood, she reached out to us I don't know like seven years ago
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:33.320]  back when she was like 18 years old wanting to tell her stories and I said listen we can't
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:37.640]  be the lead elephant on things, we have a lot of the guests on and experts on that first
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:41.360]  break things but I know Hollywood is really bad and does a lot of really terrible things
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:46.000]  but I said if you'd like to be a reporter on news issues for us you can follow reports
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.960]  that's why we've got reports seven years ago when she was 18 years old for us and her sister
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:56.360]  also did quite a bit of stuff in Hollywood and she wants to come on there and talk about
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:01.520]  some of her experiences at the bottom of the hour, I've asked her not to name names because
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:07.720]  some of this is in the public record if folks want to look it up but we are tomorrow going
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:16.080]  to have in studio the folks that made the film that is now getting a lot of attention
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:26.400]  and open secret now magically this broke today on the 19th even though we've been scheduling
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:32.040]  this week on Friday to have these folks in studio but here is the article or the group
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:38.120]  of articles that we'll be getting into at the bottom of the hour, is Hollywood sitting
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:46.680]  on a pedophile scandal, well does a bear live in the woods, do fish live in the sea,
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:54.400]  do birds fly in the sky, is grass green and did grandma love you, maybe she didn't but
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:01.840]  most grandmas do, ladies and gentlemen you can't swing a stick in LA in the elite areas
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:07.720]  elite maggot areas or you can't swing a stick in DC or New York in the so called elite
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:15.320]  areas without hitting a pedophile, now pedophiles are only the renfield procures, I told you
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.800]  this sex scandal in Weinstein is meant to legitimize going after Trump to make all
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.080]  scandals about males and females together and what could be consensual sex, I'm not
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:28.560]  defending what Weinstein did, looks like assault, certainly looks like intimidation,
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:34.280]  talking, racketeering, had others involved in the cover ups, definitely sleazy to the
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:39.600]  max, Roman Polanski raping 13 year old girls and things, getting away with it, Meryl Streep
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:43.720]  saying he's a great guy even when it's known he is, that tells you who they really are,
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:50.800]  but I told you this sex scandal with Weinstein will fall into the gay mafia and men dominating
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:56.960]  men many times not even for the pleasure of sex but for domination, it's that eurythmic
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.720]  song, some of them want to use you, some of them want to be used by you, there's certainly
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:07.040]  plenty of folks in Hollywood that like all this, there's a lot of people that don't,
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:13.800]  so it goes from the heterosexual to the homosexual to the pedophilia and then it's human sacrifice,
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:19.200]  tortured death murder and they prime people with things like 50 shades of gray and all
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:25.000]  this to get people into it thinking it's avant-garde, but finally the 10 or 15th time you're in
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  that dungeon, it didn't tell anybody where you were going, once you've been running
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.080]  around with a bunch of folks and they think they've got you where they want you, they're
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.720]  not going to let you out of those ropes and you're going to be down there for a couple
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.840]  weeks if you're lucky, maybe a few months or they might keep you for a couple years
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:45.120]  in a dungeon, they're going to come in and laugh at you with a bone sticking out of your
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:51.160]  side begging for your mommy and then finally when you become a gibbering wailing person,
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:54.980]  finally when they hear you making happy noises, totally mentally ill, totally broken, they're
[01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:58.560]  going to say get that slab of crap out of here and throw it in the river and open an
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:03.320]  acid bath up and dunk you in there, Hollywood doesn't like it when I tell you this, Hollywood
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:08.480]  is a spider hole for devil worshipers to get your young daughters and sons out there so
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:18.680]  they can rape them and torture them to death, so it's not, the gay mafia is only one level,
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:25.840]  below that's the pedophiles and below that is torturing men, women and children to death,
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.080]  their favorite thing is a two, three year old crying for mommy begging in total horror,
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:33.680]  they just sit there in those dungeons and rape and torture them and they want to do
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:38.280]  that to your family but because they can't, that's why they give them the vaccines that
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.400]  cause all the brain damage and neurological disorders and cancer because if they can just
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:47.080]  spiritually torture you that way, it's kind of like a bonfire from a distance, they feel
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:55.680]  the heat, their god rewards them because true psychopathic Satanists are not happy unless
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:00.160]  they are torturing an innocent person, they have nightmares, they're tortured, they're
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:04.040]  scared, they feel alone, they feel powerless most of them and they're just really freaked
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:08.040]  out, that's the deep psychopathic study, not the stuff you see on TV where you know American
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:12.240]  psychopaths mountain women's heads on walls, he feels really great and he's cool, that's
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:18.640]  their act, most of the really hardcore ones are tortured and they describe it as white
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:25.240]  light blazing, like in the Manchurian candidate remake when they activate the mind control
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:29.760]  guy, suddenly everything's bright and beautiful and wonderful and that's exactly, I've talked
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:33.040]  to top psychiatrists that have actually studied the famous serial killers, they've been on
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:39.480]  the show, you've heard them and the real study it's like they come alive, it's like everything's
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:44.160]  good now but that's because they're possessed basically, we're not sure, you don't believe
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:49.720]  in spiritualism, that's fine, it's an archetype and so only when they get your kid out of
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.360]  a backyard or only when they're grooming your kid and watching them in school or only once
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:57.840]  they get them in the vehicle and take them to the dungeon and then torture them and then
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:03.000]  get away with it, only then do they have enjoyment in life, it's like oxygen, imagine yourself
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.920]  underwater, you go to the deep end, you go down 10 feet, it's kind of fun at first but
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:10.840]  suddenly you want air, you kind of panic, when they're not torturing your children or
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.320]  your wife or your husband or your daughter or your son, when they're not torturing a
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:20.880]  good innocent person or poisoning them, they're not getting air, so they need to torture and
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:26.800]  kill you, look at North Korea, millions torture their death every decade, total slave labor,
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:31.240]  all about domination, all about control, look at the Nazis, look at the communist Chinese,
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:37.440]  look at Pol Pot, look at the Khmer Rouge, look at every time the Aztecs, it's all about
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:42.880]  priest of power torturing and chopping people up and having control over them, there's some
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:47.920]  kind of demon energy in the universe that enters into people and always manifests this
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.960]  from a sociological, archeological point, it's a known fact, we're facing hordes of
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:59.960]  devil worshipers.

[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:16.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:35.920]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure, you're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:40.480]  You imagine the children and the women and the men, a lot of folks like to torture strong
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.480]  men.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:46.640]  I think the Mexican drug cartels, a lot of them are torturing men until they give up
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.640]  and beg for their mommies.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:52.000]  But then if they can't torture the man to do it, a lot of times the cartel heads will
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000]  commit suicide.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:59.120]  That's even been in a big investigative report I read like 20 years ago, based down in Madame
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:04.200]  Morris, in the Texas Monthly article, that they tortured the Southern narcotics trafficker
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:08.840]  to death for like two days and they couldn't get him to break, even though they pulled
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:13.160]  his eyes out, ripped his teeth out, cut his testicles off, were burning and pouring hot
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.160]  grease on him.
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:18.120]  So when you're going to hell, I've defeated you, you're crushed, and the cartel people
[01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:19.120]  just freaked out.
[01:21:19.120 --> 01:21:26.120]  Some committed suicide, others just gave up, just, see, I mean this is some weird stuff
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:29.160]  ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:34.960]  This is some weird stuff these people are into, and I'm telling you, it's gringos in
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:41.480]  LA, and it's Chinese and China that are into it, and it's Mexicans in Mexico, and it's
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:47.080]  black people in Haiti, it's devil worship.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:53.760]  And people can't ignore this stuff at their own peril, but you serve God or you serve
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:54.760]  the devil.
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:55.760]  Remember Bob Dylan?
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:59.720]  There's video of this, he wasn't joking, in two different interviews he said, you know
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:04.240]  I sold my soul to the devil, and he said you got to serve somebody, and this system
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:08.880]  is run by the God of this world, and he even became a Christian for a while, but he said
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:14.960]  you know what, I just decided to go back to the God of this world, and so I served the
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:27.880]  devil, I sold my soul, that's Bob Dylan, smart guy, stupid guy at the same time, Bob Dylan,
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:31.840]  I don't care about starred name dropping, I've heard this show, seen our material, heard
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:39.480]  about that years ago, still, besides the go along with the system, he could write songs
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:46.200]  30 years ago about sundown on the union, about world government, and about GMO crops, think
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:53.160]  he knows what's going on, and why would Bob Dylan decide to go with the God of this world
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:59.440]  as smart as he is?
[01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:08.680]  Not me Jack, the devil can take a big old jump in the lake, as they say, yeah Katy Perry
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:12.480]  says she sold her soul to the devil, and they don't just do that to act cool, I've been
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:18.640]  in Hollywood and I've had people ask me, hey, the devil isn't that bad, Lucifer isn't
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:23.160]  that bad, and all you got to do is renounce Christ, and you're going to be a very, very
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:29.640]  rich man, I never told that story until Mark Dice told it, Mark Dice is there at one of
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:34.720]  the biggest reality TV show companies in the world, they're offering him his show with
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:44.080]  one of the lead members of Motley Crube, and he's in there alone with the head producer,
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:49.360]  the head of the company, and the guy looks at him and he says, you know what, I like
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:55.960]  the devil, and I've worshiped the devil, and Lucifer is God, and if you'll just tell
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:24:00.760]  me that you worship Lucifer, I'm going to give you this job, Mark Dice wouldn't worship
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:05.760]  Lucifer, so he didn't get a stupid reality show, who wants it?
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:12.040]  I've been on the shows, I didn't have to worship the devil, who cares?
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:17.600]  Having a real in-depth discussion with you, being able to really long form break things
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:23.560]  down, really talking about what's happening is so much better than being in some decadent,
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:29.480]  dirty mega city with a bunch of soulless people, scrabbling for recognition, and their moment,
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:34.040]  the sun, their 15 minutes, and having to go in there and sit in front of devil worshipers
[01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:43.160]  and say, fine, I renounce Jesus Christ, that's what they want you to do, well I don't, and
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:48.320]  I'm not renouncing the republic, I'm not renouncing my family, and I'm not getting on
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:25:00.280]  my knees, and I'm not scared of you, I know who you are, and that's what they hate.
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:06.920]  Because they want to torture us into submission, they want to break our will, they want control
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:12.320]  of our will, because you never really give up your will, they just want you to turn it
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:18.200]  over to them, they want you to be a slave for them, that's what they're after, not
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:27.720]  the money, the money is the light that brings in the moths to the flame, or the angler fish
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:31.240]  at 10,000 feet down, so the other little fishies think they're about to eat another
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:34.520]  little plankton that's glowing, that's a little worm that's glowing, I'm gonna get
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:38.400]  some dinner, and you get up closer, and all of a sudden there's a big old black fish with
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:46.160]  big old blue teeth, pow, you're dead, and it's just sucking you in, Hollywood, you see
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:54.520]  that light, get a little bit closer, and it's yeah, stick your arm in this drainage ditch,
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:59.320]  I'm gonna rip it off, and then when you're begging for your mommy, I'm gonna let you
[01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:04.520]  crawl away, and I'm gonna reach out with a big long arm, and I'm gonna drag you right
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:11.440]  back in, and there's gonna be popcorn and lollipops and clowns down here, and you're
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:19.600]  gonna love it, you're gonna like it, you're going to enjoy it, so just come on down here
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:32.360]  sweetheart, you're gonna like it, because you're gonna float too, it's so liberal, all the
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:37.400]  big feminist leaders, so we shouldn't have families, that hurts women, we should have
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:43.320]  the trannies teach the three-year-olds, it's liberal, mmm, mmm, families are bad, stick
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:48.840]  your arm in this drainage ditch, oh, I can put two and two together, Ellen DeGeneres,
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:56.760]  CNN, she's invested in works for Mandalay, we knew that Jesus Campos disappeared for
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.360]  days to be told what to say, and now the Daily Mail has a big long ten page article saying
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:07.640]  exactly what I told you yesterday saying put two and two together, exclusive, get today's
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:14.240]  news yesterday, Mandalay Bay owner insists security guard Jesus Campos appear only on
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:18.680]  Ellen and not to be grilled by TV hard hitters, fearing his answers to timeline questions
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:23.400]  could result in a massive lawsuit from victims of the massacre, gee, that's exactly what
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:29.800]  I said two days ago and yesterday, again, why do they fear us, why do they hate us,
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:36.640]  because we can say two plus two equals four, and as Winston Smith said in 1984 to O'Brien,
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:41.000]  freedom is the ability to say two plus two equals four, and O'Brien said it is, my friend,
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.920]  and I'm going to torture you until you're completely mentally ill and you don't know
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.600]  what two plus two equals, period, you're just going to say whatever I said, because I want
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:50.840]  to dominate your soul, now get ready, I'm going to torture you for a month straight,
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:59.960]  see, oh George Arwell, secret intelligence, M-I-6, O-S-S, telling you, he said this book
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:04.560]  is what the Fabian socialists are, they are priests of power that want to stomp on your
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:11.280]  face forever, or lock kids up and starve to death while you rape them, see, see, it's
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:17.800]  all there, it's all there, you ignore it at your peril, Millie Weber's coming in to get
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:21.440]  it all out, we got other huge, exciting news about trust busting by Donald Trump, what
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:26.480]  Trump put out his tweet five years ago, that he thinks child molesters ought to be executed,
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:31.760]  yep, he's not like Salon and CNN and the New York Times, not about how much they admire
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:37.480]  pedophiles, he doesn't want to grab your kid out of the backyard, he doesn't want to have
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:43.400]  your kid stick their arm down in a drainage ditch, that's not what he's into, he's into
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:48.760]  six foot tall supermodels because he's not intimidated by something powerful, he doesn't
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.720]  want to dominate something little and defenseless, he wants somebody to love him, he's not a devil
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:57.240]  worshiper, that's why they hate him.
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:02.600]  The answer to being in control of your own healthcare is freedom from insurance, become
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:07.120]  part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:13.440]  expenses, individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families, choose
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:17.760]  from three health sharing programs, holistic treatment may be eligible for sharing, see
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:23.880]  guidelines, discount programs available for dental, vision and pharmacy, go to libertyoncall.org,

[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:18.240]  And now, for the next episode, we're going to talk about the best, most powerful and
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:21.400]  affordable, great tasting multivitamin formula available.
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:25.840]  In the history of InfoWarsLife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:30.960]  Shield X2, SuperMail Vitality and so many others, with its unique delivery system and
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:35.080]  proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:41.520]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products, and this part is most important.
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:46.760]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:48.440]  quality lab standard.
[01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:52.440]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure and resecured, you're finding the tip of
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:57.080]  the spear in the InfoWars, that's InfoWarsLife.com and vitamin mineral fusion, take action
[01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:00.600]  now before we sell out.
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:03.920]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:08.800]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance
[01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:11.560]  to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:17.880]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:20.400]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:24.840]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:30.440]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality,
[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:34.400]  turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:37.800]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:45.840]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:49.120]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:52.040]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.
[01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:56.920]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.920]  with Anthroplex.

[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:21.240]  your oral health.

[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:27.800]  and biblical times.
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:32.920]  Instead of containing fluoride, our super-blue line is floated with the good halogen iodine
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:37.160]  and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:38.160]  health benefits.
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:43.480]  Super-blue, fluoride-free mouthwash and toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:47.800]  natural ingredients, xylitol, nano-silver, and iodine.
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:51.520]  Notice the difference with our super-blue, fluoride-free products.
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:56.560]  Refresh your breath and invigorate your oral health routine at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:03.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:34.320]  It's the time of the season to expose the power cult that is Hollywood and D.C. and
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:39.240]  how the predators there want to get you involved in every form of corruption there is.
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:44.800]  Drug dealing, money laundering, it's not just men abusing women or women abusing men.
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.320]  It is the gay mafia, oppressing and dominating people.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:54.560]  That's been covered by gay folks in Hollywood, but below that it's the pedophile mafia and
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:59.920]  then there's the occult mafia that we first started exposing 20 years ago with whistleblowers
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.640]  from the BBC in London.
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:06.720]  And now it's coming out that the Prime Minister reportedly tortured and murdered children.
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:11.760]  Mr. Heath, that's the top police commissioners who are saying that with evidence.
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:19.440]  We also just have all of this incredible evil coming out where one of the top members of
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:29.240]  the Royal House's entourage, Jimmy Savelle, had a secret satanic dungeon where he took
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:33.080]  children to rape them and he went and had sex with other leaders with dead bodies of
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:37.320]  children at the hospital and reportedly conducted satanic rituals where children were killed
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:42.240]  and then there's a list of the children that were found dead, freshly killed but also dug
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:43.720]  up.
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:46.320]  You want to find out about it, just look into it for yourself.
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:51.000]  So when I talk about Hollywood and the next shoot a drop being pedophilia and then after
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  that the final level, outright Satanism.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.600]  That's why they're pushing bondage and stuff for young women.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:01.600]  So the first 10, 15 times you do it, there's no problem.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.720]  Suddenly you're at a party, you're tied up, you never come back.
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.960]  So it's not like serial killers that trick women to get in and they put handcuffs on
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.560]  and then, you know, I won't hurt you if you put handcuffs on.
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:15.800]  No, it's your friends do it and then finally you get killed and they do it to men.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:16.800]  They do it to children.
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:17.800]  They do it to women.
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:18.800]  This is what they're into.
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:24.400]  And they had one of the top members of the Scorpions, they'll public and talk about clubs
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:25.400]  in Germany.
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:26.400]  He named them.
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:30.240]  A few years ago, where they go and they kill people at these and sometimes this is with
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:31.600]  a thousands of people.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.320]  They'll drag in a bomb and shoot them.
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:37.040]  That's kind of the entry level is killing bombs.
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.840]  You got to pay a lot of money to kill kids.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:41.080]  But that's how this works.
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:43.080]  That's why they want a lot of illegals coming in.
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.600]  That's why they've got thousands of kids.
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.080]  They've smuggled in from Haiti.
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:49.080]  One of the favorite things to kill is small black children.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:53.280]  There's a famous case you can't find on the Internet, but I have the newspaper clippings
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:57.800]  of the Rolling Stones and a black child that was found dead in New York at their house
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:59.360]  in a voodoo ritual.
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:00.360]  It's disgusting.
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:07.120]  So it's despicable and we are bound to see this happen and come out from Hollywood as
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:11.840]  we see more of these celebrities being given some support from the people, from the American
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:17.280]  people, when they see that the American people are appalled by the sex abuse and the satanic
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:21.320]  ritual stuff that's been going on in Hollywood, they're going to get more comfortable, more
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:23.360]  confident in coming out and releasing more.
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:26.200]  And again, we're mainly radio, but we syndicate television as well.
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:28.880]  But if you're a radio listener, that's Millie Weaver, one of our great reporters.
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:32.400]  It has been six or seven years you've been filing reports for us.
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:33.400]  It's been quite a while.
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:38.480]  I think 2013 was when I first started filing some, but then we kind of came back on later.
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:41.960]  So maybe I talked to you before that, but it's been at least five years, but it seems
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:45.240]  like, I mean, I knew your story and of course you've never really gotten into your personal,
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:46.240]  your sister's story.
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:47.240]  Yeah.
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:48.240]  On air.
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:49.240]  You're just doing reporting.
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:53.160]  Now you live here, obviously with your son and you're doing a great job here at InfoWars.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:57.400]  But just your overall is a woman and as a researcher and as somebody who lived in Hollywood
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:02.320]  as a teen and then saw some of the underbelly of what goes on there.
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:05.080]  What is all this latest news really about?
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:07.400]  Well, what I can say is this.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:09.060]  It's real 100% real.
[01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:11.520]  What these celebrity women are saying goes on.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:12.520]  It's actually even worse.
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:15.360]  They're just, they're just at the tip of the iceberg.
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:16.360]  What's going on?
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:21.320]  And it was so bad in fact that myself and a group of other women actually got together
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:25.200]  in Hollywood and we created something called the Hollywood Girls Club, which, you know,
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:29.120]  it's been completely ran into the ground and run out.
[01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:31.840]  We were ran out of Hollywood actually.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:35.040]  We had our events shut down by big helicopters.
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:38.840]  I mean, we were literally chased out of Hollywood because we were trying to create a women's
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:43.040]  networking organization at the time that was actually anti-feminist.
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.040]  It was, we were against.
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:46.040]  And that was in the newspaper at the time.
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:49.720]  I mean, you were accomplished at doing that, trying to get women to actually organize,
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:55.680]  not have a bunch of fake feminist virtue signaling by women that actually help deliver children
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:58.400]  to people like Roman Polanski.
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:37:59.400]  Exactly.
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:03.440]  We were not following the typical feminist model, feminist norm.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.840]  We were your virtue signal all day, but then, but then helped take folks to rape rooms.
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:13.080]  Yeah, no, not, not like some of these other people here who I have, you know, suspicions
[01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:16.360]  about Meryl Streep and Madonna and some of these other women who claim that they're
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:20.920]  feminists, claim that they're for Meryl Streep does standing ovations for Polanski saying
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:21.920]  he did nothing wrong.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:25.440]  It should be allowed out of prison for raping a 13 year old girl.
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:26.440]  Yeah.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:30.760]  And that's because they're all covering for these Hollywood predators, these demonic,
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:34.840]  filthy scum that are out there abusing women, but it's, it's bad.
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:39.840]  You have a concentrated level of talent and beauty all coming to Hollywood.
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:43.320]  So what are you going to have a concentrated level of predators?
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:45.360]  They all magnetized there.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:49.080]  And so then you have all these girls being taken advantage of, and then they come out
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.160]  with a bad taste of men in general.
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:55.200]  And that's what it seems like the media is trying to do in hijacking these celebrity
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:39:00.740]  women's abuses by telling all women that, see, this is all a problem of masculinity.
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:01.740]  It's all men's fault.
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:03.240]  Men are the bad guys in general.
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:08.400]  When in reality, you have a handful of predatory type men out there and what needs to happen
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:13.760]  with the real men out there, the good hearted men out there, they need to, instead of saying,
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:18.840]  oh, well, you know, okay, and try to try to disinvalidate it by saying, you know, these
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:22.960]  women, maybe they're asking for it, maybe they're trading for their career or whatever.
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:28.640]  No, the real men need to say, you know what, we're going to take on these women's flight.
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:32.960]  We're going to fight these predatory disgust and then that way the leftist can't be the
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:33.960]  gatekeepers.
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:37.280]  Just like they control the environmental movement, but want to tax carbon dioxide, but ignore
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:41.360]  genetic engineering, atmospheric manipulation, nuclear reactors leaking.
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:45.280]  They always want to lead the movements so that they can control them because obviously
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:49.800]  it's like the missing children groups turns out keep getting run by pedophiles or you
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:53.680]  know, it's like the cancer research groups are actually run by the drug makers who don't
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:55.280]  want you to have a cure.
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:58.640]  The globalists want to divide the sexes.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:01.200]  They do not want people having traditional marriages.
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:05.920]  They don't want men and women getting along, raising productive members of society.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:06.920]  They don't want that.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:08.360]  So what are they doing?
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:13.360]  They're having these predatory type men get away with it sexually abusing and assaulting
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:14.360]  women.
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:18.120]  And then if you can convince the other general population of men to say, oh, well, you know,
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:22.960]  she asked for it because they're attacking masculinity as a whole, the feminists are.
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:26.480]  And what happens, the feminists decide, well, we'll take up your plight, we'll take up
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:29.680]  your cause and it needs to be said right now.
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.840]  We need real men coming and saying, you know what, these women were abused and we're going
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:39.240]  to come after the scum out there in Hollywood, the Harvey Weinstein's, the disgusting types
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:42.360]  out there because we know they do not represent masculinity.
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:44.120]  They represent weakness.
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:46.440]  And we hear on that Weinstein tape.
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:49.000]  He isn't even trying to make her feel good or get her in bed.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:53.640]  He wants to humiliate her watching this disgusting blob shower.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:56.480]  And obviously what he, the other things he does, there are things I'm not going to mention
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:57.480]  here.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:59.480]  It's about humiliating gorgeous, beautiful women.
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:03.560]  I'm not going to get into the things they do, but obviously what's come out in Hollywood
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:05.520]  is these guys are so degenerate.
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.480]  It's not sex with these gorgeous women.
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:09.120]  It's making them do degrading things.
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.000]  And these are the bait of males.
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:15.600]  These are the guys who women naturally wouldn't be magnetized to.
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.160]  And then meanwhile you have all these alpha males out there in society who aren't preying
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:23.880]  on women, who aren't trying to get in these positions of power to do these things.
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:27.600]  And those are the men that women need to come and help them, essentially.
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:28.600]  And that is what it is.
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:33.880]  Modern culture creates these cults of betas who are then twisted and seek after power,
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:36.760]  but it's always really twisted versions of it.
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:42.280]  I mean, making beautiful women basically get on the ground like a dog and eat crap.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:44.880]  That's the kind of things reportedly Mr. Weinstein's into.
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:45.880]  Exactly.
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:46.880]  Exactly.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:50.720]  If you want to take down feminism because feminism is vile, it's repulsive, it's all
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:52.880]  about man-hating and I will not stand for it.
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:56.400]  And it's all about weird technocrat women controlling women.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.400]  Exactly.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:00.360]  As if you don't have a husband that's there to defend you and help you and you help him,
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:01.800]  the states your husband.
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:02.800]  Exactly.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:07.200]  The women are forced to go to these feminist women that hate men for help rather than
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:11.680]  going to the real men in society, the men that can actually stand up and say, we're
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:13.320]  going to come after the Harvey Weinstein's.
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:16.720]  We're going to come after these sick predators that want to do this to women.
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:19.480]  We're going to play some of that tape when we come back and I know I want to be careful
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:22.480]  because I know you're storing your report and your sisters, but if you want to without
[01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:26.960]  getting into names, talk about just what really happens in Hollywood when you were even under
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:27.960]  age.
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:33.560]  Just so people get an idea of imagining women out there luring young girls in just like
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:36.920]  they use women or children to lure folks into the ice cream truck and then you're never
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:37.920]  seen again.
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:39.680]  I mean, that's what Hollywood is.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:41.120]  That's what Nickelodeon is.
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:42.120]  That's what MTV is.
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:45.640]  It's all a big lure to sexualize and get your children.
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:50.000]  That's what the left hates me so much because a large portion of them are now fellow travelers
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  on board.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:54.880]  A larger percentage than I thought actually like all this because they're all so beta
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:55.880]  and so cupped.
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.880]  Dr. Group, you developed living defense for us.
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:00.280]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:02.000]  Why is this so good?
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.520]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:11.320]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:12.320]  my system.
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:17.560]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:20.360]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:25.440]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.720]  going on everywhere.
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:27.720]  These are all parasites.
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:30.440]  Tell us about all the stuff that said there's so many things that are in it.
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:31.680]  You have the neem in there.
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:34.760]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:38.080]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:39.080]  All right.
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:41.240]  Let's put some back in because I'm going back on it today.

[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:18.560]  to mix with whey and then make shakes.

[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:28.320]  And our intrepid reporter, Millie Weaver, her and her sister, back when they were under
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:33.560]  age and then after they were 18, were in Hollywood and witnessed a lot of what we're already
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:36.160]  seeing, but she's saying it's the tip of the iceberg.
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:41.480]  We have producers and directors of the award-winning film, an open secret in studio tomorrow, that
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:45.800]  The Week and others are reporting on, saying this could bring down the pedophile networks
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:46.800]  in Hollywood.
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:50.280]  So that's the next level, before we get more into your story and show some of these articles
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:55.240]  and documents that folks can watch, who are watching the stream online at infowars.com
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:58.840]  forward slash show and on some cable and TV stations around the country, but describing
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:01.360]  it from a radio listeners will go over it.
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:05.000]  But Millie, before we get into your story and what happened to you and what it's like
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.960]  now, see this breaking as Hollywood implodes, as the snake eats itself, as this thing begins
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:15.520]  to crumble, as the rats try to leave the sinking ship.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:19.400]  What about the deeper stuff, the devil worship, the pedophilia, I mean you were underage when
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:23.280]  some of this happened to you, but I wouldn't call it classical pedophilia if you're 16
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:27.520]  or whatever, but what about the occult, did you ever run into that in Hollywood?
[01:48:27.520 --> 01:48:35.640]  Oh, definitely, without a doubt, I was, you know, I had been exploited when I was underage
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:41.480]  by a prominent mogul in Hollywood, I won't say names.
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:48.880]  And once you're in that loop, you have people surrounding you, basically making sure that
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:51.560]  you're in their circle, in their network.
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:57.480]  And so I was surrounded by big time producers, big names, my sister and I, you know, we had
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:01.400]  record deals on the table and all these people that were surrounding us, it wasn't until
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:06.320]  years into associating with these people, I mean, I was, these are the Grammy Awards,
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:10.360]  I was at the Grammys, I was at the Academy Awards, bunch of different things, and I was
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:18.360]  being groomed, essentially, to be inducted into the Hollywood Celebrity Circle, and-
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:23.040]  And we now know that's what Disney did, most of these big stars, male and female, are primed
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:27.360]  right through being sexually abused, many times by the time they're six or seven years
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:32.040]  old, and then they're even rehiring directors that raped little kids, Disney does.
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:36.000]  Yeah, and you know, one of the producers that I was working with, you know, records Carrie
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:42.640]  Underwood, Selena Gomez, big time, multi-millionaire producer, records for Disney, you know, did
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:44.800]  a bunch of soundtracks for 300, and all of them-
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:47.760]  In fact, as we have a new audience every minute, guys, pull up the article about the famous
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:52.000]  director that raped a 12-year-old boy and still got hired by Disney, that broke last
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.120]  week, I'm gonna put that on screen, go ahead.
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:59.160]  So essentially what happened was, right when you get to the precipice, right when you're
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:04.960]  about to sign your contract, about to sign your movie deal, that's when they start revealing
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:08.240]  what they are, who they're affiliated, what they're about, and that's when they start
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:16.680]  telling me about their OTO, affiliations, Illuminati, drinking blood, a bunch of stuff.
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:19.720]  And just to be clear, with your contacts, you were able to get in the Getty Center that
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:26.080]  nobody can, and got video of actual manuscripts of child sacrifice that are 500 years old that
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:27.080]  we premiered here.
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:29.920]  I mean, with you and your contacts, you guys actually got in there, nobody's ever gotten
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:30.920]  that out.
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:38.480]  And my sister actually, she was invited to one of these rituals, and she went, and she
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:45.880]  said she saw basically a big fat woman sitting up and dancing up on a stage naked, and they
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:51.200]  had a guy dressed like Jesus sitting in a chair throne, and they were essentially enacting
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:51:00.240]  a ritual where this big fat naked woman was this, the bat, what is it, the goddess, and
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:04.560]  she was trying to seduce, and she seduced and kissed the guy that was looking like Jesus,
[01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:08.160]  and then they all took a communion to it.
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:09.760]  And that's just entry-level blasphemy?
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:11.040]  That's entry-level, yes.
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:15.680]  And then once I started realizing, oh my gosh, these people, what am I getting into?
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:19.840]  And I wanted to get away from that, you know, that's when it all broke loose.
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:25.880]  I started being gang harassed, stalked, threatened, Gavin helped me get away from them.
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:29.320]  I met him totally separate from these people, and they freaked out.
[01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:35.240]  And we were gang-stalked, we were harassed, they charged false charges against him for
[01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:39.400]  saying that he harassed them when they called him and made death threats toward him.
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:45.040]  It was as though the courts, everything, were just interlaced with these corrupt people,
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:46.040]  you know?
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:50.960]  It's discussing how bad it is in Hollywood, and sorry, it's hard for me to say all of
[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:53.040]  this just because it brings back a lot of memory.
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:58.400]  You're doing a great job, you're strong, it was hard for me to talk about, because I'm
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:01.240]  a guy that kind of just slept it off and thought it was weird and said, hey, watch it, I'm
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:04.920]  gonna knock you upside the head, and then you go, ha, ha, ha, ha, like they're guys.
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:08.080]  But I mean, I've had producers just here at a meeting, they just reach over and grab
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:09.080]  your genitals.
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:10.080]  It's just an act of domination.
[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:16.800]  Well, the worst part was, you know, after this big Hollywood person, celebrity, had,
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:19.560]  you know, sexually abused me.
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:21.080]  Hal, were you then?
[01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:25.200]  I was, well, I was 17, I just turned 17 at the time.
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:28.960]  But that's when my mom reached out to some attorneys and tried to, you know, and then
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:34.480]  you find out that these attorneys that are women that say that they're feminists aren't
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:36.440]  really out to help women.
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:40.280]  And that's the hardest part is the realization, and that kind of red-pilled me in a big way
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:47.920]  to realize how vile these feminist women are that say that they're helping women, and really,
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:52.120]  they're out there just kind of protecting and being handlers and damage control for
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:54.440]  some of these big wicks.
[01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:56.640]  It's really disheartening, you know?
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:01.920]  And that's why I say we need more women to come forward, as well as men, because there
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:04.920]  were child actors like Corey Feldman and Corey Heim.
[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:09.640]  There are much more than are willing to be brave enough to come out against.
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:13.200]  And Corey Feldman is hinting at naming Hollywood pedophiles.
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:17.440]  I mean, the word is, you heard it here first, folks, in the last few months.
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:22.120]  The pedophile scandal is about to break, and then the Weinstein comes out after that.
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:25.760]  So I really think, I'm not defending Weinstein, it's terrible, but they've allowed this to
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:32.760]  come out in the New Yorker after the New York Times and NBC spiked it back in 2004 and 2009,
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:36.040]  because they want to use all this to smokescreen the pedophilia.
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:37.040]  Exactly.
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:42.920]  And then we have these feminists now out there in the media, which enrages me, taking this
[01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:48.920]  on as their champion, their plight, their, oh, this is all men, this is all masculinity.
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:52.320]  We need to all whip these men into submission.
[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:53.320]  That's what the feminists say.
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:58.840]  And it's disgusting, because in reality, what we need is we need real men to stand up and
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:03.400]  come after these predatory types, because these women who are out there saying this, pushing
[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:06.320]  this MO, they're part of the globalists, they're part of the elites.
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:10.920]  It's all part of this divide and conquer strategy, where they want to divide men and women so
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:11.920]  we don't have marriages.
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:13.440]  We stop having as many children.
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:15.800]  We stop having successful, moral-
[01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:18.600]  And by the way, that's in all the government documents.
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:22.840]  That's in the TAVA stock, that's in the CIA, it's all been declassified, mainstream news,
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:23.840]  and they've done it.
[01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:28.920]  You know, and it kind of reminds me of this story that Gavin told me about his grandpa
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:34.240]  and how times used to be versus how they are now, you know, they're putting all these chemicals
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:36.640]  in the water to try and lower sperm counts.
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:41.880]  But you know, I want to talk about his grandpa, apparently one of their neighbors was kept
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:48.520]  beating his wife, okay, and the men kept finding out, and Gavin's grandpa kept finding out
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:49.520]  through the wives.
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:53.200]  The wives would keep complaining, you know, this guy, he keeps beating our friends so
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:58.320]  and so, he's beating his wife, and you know what they did?
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:03.680]  They went over there with guns and they beat him up and said, if you ever put your hand
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:08.040]  on this woman again, we will mess you up bad.
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:13.780]  And you know what, he stopped and the women stopped complaining, their wives stopped complaining
[01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:15.280]  and they didn't need feminism.
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:16.760]  Because men acted like men.
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:21.040]  Men acted like men, and nowadays it's like the guy's beating up the women, the women
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:24.040]  are all hearing the other women complain and the men aren't doing anything.
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:25.040]  So what do they do?
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:27.800]  They go to the feminists who are going to try to demonize all men.
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:30.320]  Who are actually more like madams who want to control women.
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:31.320]  Exactly.
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:34.280]  I've been around some famous feminists and they, even though they're old women, they
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:35.280]  actually hit on you.
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:38.720]  I mean, I'll just say it because they put Joy Behar image on Twitter, grabbing a man's
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:40.960]  genitals without asking.
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:44.720]  I mean, she didn't do that, but I was on CNN with her too, not just the view, and she's
[01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:49.280]  like, you're a good looking young man, hey, how long you in New York?
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:52.840]  And she didn't go all the way, but it was like the famous madam in the movie, like,
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:55.360]  hey, baby, why don't you come up here and see me sometime.
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:59.200]  And for an older woman, I mean, she was definitely putting it on and wasn't joking.
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:03.480]  Well, I'm not going to say arrest her because she grabbed a guy's genitals.
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:06.120]  You know, the point is the next time he said stop, though, then it would be ripe if she
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:08.840]  continued, but she shows what a bunch of hypocrites they are.
[01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:09.840]  Exactly.
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:15.240]  And I have actually met and been told about and was in circles with people who are like,
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:16.520]  oh yeah, that's so-and-so.
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:17.520]  She's a madam.
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.360]  And the madams have tried to come and talk.
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:22.800]  And again, you've got a lot of women that just have that madam spirit as well for the
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:23.800]  powerful men.
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:27.160]  We're going to go to break and come back with more just briefly, folks.

[02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:33.160]  Millie Weaver's our guest.
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:37.640]  She was a model and actress out in Hollywood and had some success with her sister but soon
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:42.160]  learned that it was a nightmare just the last minute and a half break.
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:45.720]  You were talking about some of the cost of your friends and people that died that went
[02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:50.640]  to mental institutions just with the hands of one individual and it wasn't just older
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:53.880]  men when you were underage that grimmed you and that were having sex.
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:57.520]  It was you were telling me also being raped so tell us about some of that.
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:07.520]  Yeah so basically we were kind of being damaged, controlled, handled by some big name Hollywood
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:12.840]  managers and producers and it turns out I found out later that one of these producers
[02:01:12.840 --> 02:01:21.600]  was in association with the mogul that had assaulted me and apparently he also managed
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:26.960]  for a while these girls that were twins that one of the twins was assaulted by that guy
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:36.600]  when she was about 16 she was actually raped and those twins ended up one of them she jumped
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:42.560]  mysteriously out of a condo high-rise on cocaine and died and her sister wound up being in
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:47.200]  a mental hospital and basically it's really you know they kind of have just disappeared
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:51.840]  all together off the map and so I was wondering in my mind that kind of terrified me at the
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:55.360]  time is that what's going to happen to me or-
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:02:00.880]  Well think about this if I didn't join their group join the occult that's what the offer
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:06.120]  was being put forward to me on the table if I said no was I going to wind up like those
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:10.520]  girls and that's when I tried to go to the authorities get help and the gang stalking
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:18.320]  and all of that stuff was tremendous I had severe anxiety it was horrible.
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:24.480]  And you were just there a few years as this all begins to come out you were downtown this
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:29.200]  week on Congress and did a report and a lot of people were oblivious or they thought Hollywood
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:35.080]  was only about you know feminism or guys being pushy I mean you can really see how they're
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:41.000]  obscuring what's really going on just by focusing on guys that are borderline assaulting women
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.000]  which I think is terrible we talked about this weeks ago saying that's where it's going
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.320]  and you talk to the trendies and they just don't seem to have any idea what's going
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:49.320]  on.
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:57.000]  Hollywood is a satanic mafia run town and industry and so why do we have these women
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.640]  only now after all these years coming forward well I think it's partially because of the
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:08.040]  fact that Harvey Weinstein is coming under fire and he's likely to be prosecuted maybe
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:11.680]  they feel safer maybe they feel like there's more of an alternative that they can rely
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:16.760]  on in covering and exposing what their statements are but I feel like their statements have been
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:19.560]  way under reported in the mainstream media.
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:25.920]  I also noticed in your personal street report the women particularly just 10 years ago would
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:31.440]  want to be on TV now they're all looking at their own phones it's made them so insular
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:37.280]  or so inward looking but in a way that's good people don't even like reporters or Hollywood
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:42.040]  anymore these two folks would jump to be on TV now they don't I mean this is really the
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:46.480]  collapse of mainstream media but I noticed your frustration as well they also didn't
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:50.520]  want to be on TV about something serious some of the pop stuff on the internet's made it
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:54.560]  where it's all just you know mindless stuff and that's the stuff that YouTube pushes not
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:55.560]  the serious topics.
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:04:00.040]  Well the frustration there was that it seemed like hardly anybody had heard about these
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:04.600]  celebrities coming out about sex abuse and I'm asking them you know did you hear about
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:09.480]  the Hollywood sex abuse scandals and they're all like no no no and then finally some of
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:13.600]  them when I mentioned Harvey Weinstein they said oh you know I think I saw something about
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:18.520]  that on social media but none of them said they saw it on TV well your report mainstream
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:21.720]  media your report was very important we got to take this clip talking about it put it on
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:29.080]  the front and put it back out but with a headline like libtards not aware of Hollywood sex scandal
[02:04:29.080 --> 02:04:32.680]  and then just point and then it'll get 5 million views like your last video you'll do a super
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:35.960]  video it's like 50,000 views and the other one you did but the last video did has like
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:40.040]  5 million views now one before that where you took on Eminem so great job Millie Weaver
[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:44.040]  I appreciate your courage let's talk more about this on the war room coming up there's

[02:04:56.200 --> 02:05:01.160]  We have your Russian collusion Mad Maxine but you might want to hold on to that in peach
[02:05:01.160 --> 02:05:06.680]  45 pitchfork because it's not what it seems a new bombshell report from the hill reveals
[02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:13.520]  that the FBI had uncovered a Russian bribery plot way back in 2009 the FBI gathered substantial
[02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:19.320]  evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery kickbacks extortion
[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:23.960]  and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin's atomic energy business inside the
[02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:29.680]  US but they sat on the story for years allowing President Obama to sign a controversial deal
[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:36.120]  in 2010 giving Russia control of 20% of US uranium the report confirms the Russians
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:41.880]  routed millions of dollars into the US to support this scheme via charitable donations
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:47.560]  to the Clinton Foundation plus special counsel Robert Mueller sat on the committee alongside
[02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:52.560]  Hillary Clinton which rubber stamped the sale of uranium despite knowing about Russian
[02:05:52.560 --> 02:06:10.440]  racketeering Leanne McAdoo info wars dot com the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening
[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:27.120]  to the Alex I ask well what is going to happen to those people that we can't reeducate better
[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:34.360]  die hard kept capitalists and the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated and when
[02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:40.440]  I pursued this further they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people
[02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:47.480]  in these reeducation centers and when I say eliminate I mean kill 25 million people I
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:55.200]  want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people most of which have graduate degrees
[02:06:55.200 --> 02:07:06.480]  from Columbia and other well-known educational centers and hear them figuring out the logistics
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:13.480]  for the elimination of 25 million people and they were dead serious that was from an interview
[02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:20.960]  back in 1992 Mr. Grathwald died in the last few years and I was shocked to hear it I said
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:25.320]  let's get Larry back on back in 2013 and six months had gone by and they said oh you know
[02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:30.880]  he died tragically but if you see the documentaries he was in back in the 90s or the interviews
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:38.000]  we did back in the 2000s right through to 2013 you then see the weathermen and Bill
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:43.120]  Ayers and the Antifa and the globalist the Democratic Party literally pushing the same
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:51.480]  rhetoric now and you see them in the 2010 army documents that are public be classified
[02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:57.320]  talking about reeducation camps in America they use the term reeducation camp is type

[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:56.440]  and re-released it in 2013 he was on the brink a break from his book tour when he passed
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:09:02.120]  away on july 18th 2013 and Lindsey worked with her dad behind the scenes mostly researching
[02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:08.240]  Obama's ties to domestic terrorists like Bill Ayres fast forwarded today she saw Antifa
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:12.520]  and Black Lives Matter and others in Berkeley violently attacking people she was born and
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:16.280]  raised in San Francisco Bay Area was shocked at the violence she saw on the streets and
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:20.040]  the cops doing nothing she knew people like Bill Ayres were involved and she found out
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:26.640]  she was right so she joins us now your father was just an amazing patriot infiltrating the
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:32.920]  highest levels of people with Harvard and Cornell degrees calmly sitting around as
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:39.520]  he said talking about exterminating 25 million people and that was in the 70s they had this
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:44.280]  plan now they got Obama in they put these networks in place now they're calling for
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:51.560]  a war riding shotgun with us in this hour is one of our investigative reporters as well
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:56.440]  Millie Weaver who's been out and been physically attacked by Antifa and been death-threatened
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:03.400]  in her car broken into with her cameraman and producer Gavin Gavin Wins as well so Lindsey
[02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:09.520]  we want to just say we appreciate you and you're ongoing work with your father's important
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:15.080]  investigations without him we know we wouldn't be able to bring down the larger network
[02:10:15.080 --> 02:10:19.960]  of the weather underground or another game plan for today so again we stand on your father's
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:23.720]  shoulders and we salute you thank you for joining us thank you for having me I'm honored
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:29.280]  to be here Alec first snapshot I mean you say it yourself we are witnessing their plan
[02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:34.200]  yet again they've said November 2nd the main uprising begins on the 100th anniversary of
[02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:41.640]  the Bolshevik Revolution yeah absolutely and here in the Bay Area things are getting
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:47.200]  pretty pretty crazy here you know I live I feel like I live in the hornest nest is what
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:54.800]  I call it and every time you know we step into a city like Berkeley or San Francisco simply
[02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:59.800]  for you know if you wear an American flag you you're subject to violence it's pretty
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:04.800]  scary well I've always loved the American flag but I thought some people used it to
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:08.600]  launch wars I didn't like and it could be misused but since they've tried to ban it
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:13.400]  now I wear it since they don't like it now now I'm flying you know something peculiar
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:18.960]  I noticed when I was at Berkeley was all around the town I saw graffiti but their graffiti
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:25.160]  had this hammer and sickle mark on it so I found that bizarre I had never seen hammer
[02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:31.800]  and sickle graffiti anywhere other than Berkeley oh yeah I mean that that town is very much
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:39.560]  marked I mean the mayor himself I mean he's a he's a member of the BAM which is a domestic
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:45.600]  terrorist group by any means necessary he's actually a member of on their Facebook page
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:51.240]  so and these people I mean that their ultimate goal is to overthrow our government and bring
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:57.680]  us into a Marxist communist regime and your father was the trailblazer talk about your
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:02.680]  dad talk about his history talk about I mean never want to talk about himself talk about
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:07.920]  Green Beret Vietnam how he decorated a patriot why he's why he infiltrated I mean he was
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:11.840]  on the college campus doing the GI Bill he wasn't even looking for this but he saw them
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:16.800]  running around I mean talk so about your father yeah my father you know as you said he was
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:23.960]  he was in Vietnam he enlisted when he was 16 years old and he in into the army and he
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:29.840]  was in Vietnam by the time he was 17 and he spent his 18th birthday in Vietnam and when
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:36.360]  he returned home he became a drill instructor at Fort Knox Kentucky and he got married to
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:41.480]  his first wife and had my two sisters and at that point he decided he wanted to use
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:47.760]  the GI Bill so they moved back to Cincinnati which is where my dad was born and raised
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:53.200]  and he decided to go to the University of Cincinnati to get his education and that's
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:13:01.240]  where he ran into the SDS and and he he was very alarmed by them and he just so happened
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:08.960]  to his first wife happened to her father worked for the Cincinnati Police Department so my
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:13.040]  dad immediately you know went to him and you know was basically said you know these people
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:18.280]  are they're serious they seem pretty crazy and that's how it all started you know the
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:25.560]  Cincinnati Police Department started the investigation had my dad go to meetings and and report back
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:31.400]  to him but they quickly realized that this group was serious and that's when the FBI
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:37.560]  got involved and that's when my dad became the only informant to be able to infiltrate
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:42.840]  the weather underground and when they did go underground he was the only FBI informant
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:48.320]  to be able to go or to go underground with them so he he worked and lived with people
[02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:54.400]  like Bill Ayers, Bernadine Dorn, Mark Rudd, Linda Evans, Jeff Jones, I mean these are
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:14:02.280]  names that I mean for me I heard about them all my life so for me when Obama was running
[02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:06.840]  for president and you know they had the Bill Ayers came to play it was just you know was
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:14.080]  absolutely mind blowing to me you know that that he was he was in the public eye and that
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:20.880]  nobody was questioning anything about it so I mean that's basically my dad you know ran
[02:14:20.880 --> 02:14:25.400]  messages between the Central Committee which was people like Bill Ayers they were the leaders
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:32.120]  of the weather underground their mission was to go around the country and to cause as much
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:37.880]  of damage as they could well up buildings and I mean Bill Ayers himself said that in
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:43.600]  a revolution innocent people have to die so to them killing innocent people was just
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:49.880]  part of the revolution that needed to happen and they they claim that they've never killed
[02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:56.440]  anybody but my father was you know actually there when Bill Ayers said that Bernadine
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:01.800]  Dorn placed a bomb on the window ledge of the Park Police Station in San Francisco,
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:06.800]  California which killed Sergeant McDonald so they claim that that you know that never
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:12.640]  happened but my father actually talked about it wrote about it and had to testify in front
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:20.600]  of the Senate so and his stories always stayed the same and I believe that they did and let's
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:23.800]  be clear we're going to break your father was a hero and so are you working with him
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:28.760]  for decades he lives on with this important work we will defeat the communists we will

[02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:35.520]  wars and their car got broken into they got threatened they went and showed the different
[02:20:36.480 --> 02:20:40.880]  professor classes and meetings where they were promoting how they were going to go out and be
[02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:45.200]  violent in fact those reports are up on info wars dot com you can tell folks some of the names the
[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:52.000]  reports but if you want to know the brainchild the operating system the granddaddies of blm and all
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:57.680]  this it's communist cop tillers in fact the founder of blm the lady that they say is the is the
[02:20:57.680 --> 02:21:04.800]  grandmother of it is in cuba fleeing justice from just shooting a cop that wasn't even doing anything
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:11.040]  to her and the whole point is they want violent revolution and they believe the time is now and
[02:21:11.040 --> 02:21:15.120]  suddenly there's red brigades all over austin marching and there's people all over the country
[02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:20.080]  doing it and they're calling for violence and saying the 100th anniversary is here then you
[02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:25.360]  look at obama who's set at the feet of bill ares who he lived with and you understand that this now
[02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:31.120]  has state backing and how close we were if hillary would have gotten in we have larry grathwald the
[02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:36.800]  only man whoever infiltrated the weather underground successfully and helped send some of them to
[02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:41.440]  prison we have his heroic daughter who helped him write his book and travel the country before he
[02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:47.360]  died four years ago you know it was interesting because while i was in berkeley this man came
[02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:52.800]  up to me on the street and he said hey do you want to see the real commies the commie leaders the
[02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:58.960]  leaders of bam antifa and the communist movements and i said okay sure why not but i was a little
[02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:03.600]  bit suspicious because i didn't want to walk into an ambush or a trap but we went there hesitantly
[02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:09.600]  and of course that's when we saw the revcom bookstore and inside i was expecting much of young
[02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:15.120]  antifa looking punks to be the leaders them putting it all together and plotting and scheming
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:20.800]  no believe it or not it was much of old white people and i was just completely shocked to see
[02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:26.720]  these gray-haired people looking like professors and city leaders and planners help us to name
[02:22:26.720 --> 02:22:30.960]  the report so they can pull it up and show tv viewers and radio listeners because you got footage
[02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:38.880]  of all this this is powerful it was like exposed berkeley um communist leaders i think that i don't
[02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:43.360]  remember that we got to republish that with the inside a berkeley communist meaning never before
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:48.160]  and you know what they were doing they had a video on screen when we walked up there of my
[02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:54.560]  milo unopolis who went out and spoke earlier that day and it was the footage from the disruptor
[02:22:54.560 --> 02:22:59.200]  that went out there and shut him down and i spoke to milo's people and they said wow that
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:04.880]  is the footage from the disruptor the loudmouth disruptor that went out there and made it so
[02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:09.200]  that milo had to leave so essentially they were watching the footage of their own agent that they
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:13.280]  sent out there to shut down milo and they were actually applauding and clapping look at these
[02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:17.760]  communists they have such dead eyes it's exposed berkeley antifa leaders caught wargaming against
[02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:23.360]  milo that's a strong headline but i think we should say you know inside a communist training

[02:24:02.320 --> 02:24:09.200]  magnitude of this is living in san francisco it's huge it's scary i i have to say something after
[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:14.720]  watching that clip i need to tell you guys the story um that video that you just showed in front
[02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:21.280]  of revolution book i was there that day um i'm not in that video but i was there standing in front
[02:24:21.280 --> 02:24:27.280]  of the store with some friends and we were holding an american flag um in front of the store later
[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:36.320]  this was after i think this video and revolution book actually just this last weekend had a fundraiser
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:42.560]  and i wish that i could send it to you the the flyer that they have posted but it goes on and on
[02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:48.800]  about the nazis which i was i guess one of those nazis that was standing out in front of their store
[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:55.760]  holding the flag um chanting us a and they wanted to raise money i mean that the the flyer basically
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:25:01.920]  says they're raising money to to organize against us you know calm let's be clear they're watching
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:08.960]  a video of my love speaking on the internet from the same day about how they tried with their minions
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:15.200]  they sent out to violently stop him i mean this is literally communists at their command base
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:20.960]  directing their minions and just look at the sorry sacks of garbage and what the school did was the
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:26.000]  school made it so that any type of amplified and they also had trendy type thugs trying to stop you
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:30.480]  well no this guy actually was the one who tipped us off right here he said he had sat in on a meeting
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:34.640]  and he knew their plans and he was essentially giving us a tip well he's a cool guy i just saw
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:39.040]  some other communists going by but he did say that they know you they've seen you they're after
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:44.480]  you now and lo and behold our car gets broken into so i found that interesting how soon after
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:49.520]  because i think it was like the next day yeah go to her twitter where is that posted all the windows
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:55.360]  knocked out the stuff stolen yeah that was the next day that that happened and what was interesting
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:26:01.200]  is berkeley the campus made it so that you couldn't use an amplificatory device so no
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:06.720]  speakers and so they knew that and my lila mylo went out there to try and just talk with his
[02:26:06.720 --> 02:26:11.280]  voice there it is info wars reporter caravan analyze equipment stolen at berkeley protest info
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:16.000]  wars dot com news wars dot com sorry i'm gonna go ahead so they sent their agent out there to
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:21.840]  yell over him because they knew that the berkeley staff made it so you couldn't use an amplificatory
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:27.360]  device to drown out the provocateur nobody could even hear mylo so mylo left and the left openly
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:31.920]  says ban free speech on berkeley and they've done it of questions of conservatives and then if you
[02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:35.920]  try to have a prayer rally we're gonna come back and talk about this that you were witness to
[02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:40.960]  in san francisco they come out and viciously attack you and the police and the mayor defends it
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:46.640]  and polosi defends it but then they had to back off a week later and say okay it's bad so i want
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:53.600]  to ask our guests what do you think that's about well you know our rallies i just want to say
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:58.080]  that what we were supposed to have that we had to cancel the christie field and then there was the
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:04.720]  saint edomarktism in berkeley we had created what we had called liberty weekend and those rallies
[02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:09.840]  to be honest i mean we had a couple hundred people that were going to show up it wasn't until charlotte
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:16.080]  so that people really started paying attention and right like literally the day after charlotte so
[02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:21.920]  there were people you know calling us out calling us nazis and that's when polosi got on tv and mayor
[02:27:21.920 --> 02:27:26.960]  lady and all of them and just drilled into everybody that we were white supremacist nazis
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:32.000]  without even without even trying to reach out to us without even really looking to see what we were
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:38.160]  about um that they wanted to shut us well my own personal opinion isn't that they wanted to shut us
[02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:44.800]  down is that they wanted us to go in there and i really feel like we were being set up for another
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:52.400]  charlotte bill um just from the security that they were were planning to give us and um all the intel
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:57.680]  that we were getting it was dangerous and so we made the decision to cancel it and i don't think
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:03.920]  they were planning on that because it it it backfired on them because antifa showed up in full force
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:08.480]  as we saw in berkeley i was there i went to berkeley that's the following and they were going to attack
[02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:13.440]  people even it was the cops and regular citizens they're so hateful and so then they didn't have
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:18.880]  some patsies for there to be violence two-sided it was just a full display of how they started the
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:23.760]  whole charlotte bill thing as well and then it turns out their leaders sheep dip for one year
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:29.920]  were also running the white supremacist group yeah and and and i you know it's crazy i mean we in
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:36.000]  berkeley that day we you know they berkeley had said you know no they gave us a list no helmet

[02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:25.600]  the sexualization of children you want to know russia's crime their national tv shows now for
[02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:33.040]  at least six seven years sound like this broadcast and cover and by the way do play clips of my show
[02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:38.960]  i'm told every day on private and russian television i never asked that i've never been to russia
[02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:45.200]  i don't speak five words or russian the point is is that russia he was christian and was anti
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:51.360]  communist before they got taken over to 1917 and the very same grandchildren of the same mega bankers
[02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:58.080]  on record that financed that bolster revolution are launching one now and they mean business now
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:02.640]  larry grathwald you're riding shotgun you've been attacked many times yeah you were in charlottesville i
[02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:07.680]  forget i mean that's why millie weaver's here the antifa should be taken serious they have
[02:35:07.680 --> 02:35:13.600]  military like training i don't know who exactly is giving them a training but they were doing warlike
[02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:19.520]  maneuvering and essentially pulling the right people the alt-right people have phalanxes they're
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:25.440]  peddling people exactly they're using police tactics they have training and somebody's training
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:31.760]  them that's all i've seen and you know it's interesting my mom's stepmother her family
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:39.360]  was actually from russia and they had fled the bolshevik revolution they had everything taken
[02:35:39.360 --> 02:35:43.520]  which was a new york london liberal revolution a bunch of people meeting just like they're at that
[02:35:43.520 --> 02:35:48.640]  bookshop saying we're taking over they mean business they were and you got some bozo the clown old
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:53.840]  crazy middle patient running your life in a death camp that's right they took their their estate
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:58.800]  their wealth everything they ran them out they were lucky to get away with their lives i would take
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:05.600]  the threat of antifa and even on november 4th pretty serious in that if you have grandma at home
[02:36:05.600 --> 02:36:12.560]  in an area that you think that antifa could you know protest or keep your family out of those areas
[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:17.920]  and just be prepared to defend yourselves if you get exactly because let's be clear these
[02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:22.080]  they call it anti fascist they've got communist tattoos they're communist but notice the last
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:27.920]  30 years were told communists don't exist okay when it actually came from here so let me go back
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:32.640]  to lindsay grathwald i want to get more into where you think antifa is going how we stop them but
[02:36:32.640 --> 02:36:37.280]  just stories about your dad because there's a couple documentaries he's in i interviewed him
[02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:43.840]  probably 15 times or so uh you know i read his book uh tell us some stories about your dad because
[02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:49.520]  the same way i was going to local college at 18 years old i went in i read a bunch of history
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:54.160]  books i wasn't you know green beret like your dad that fought communist and i was hearing america's
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:59.040]  evil the founding fathers are bad guns are bad all whites are bad these were white professors
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:04.640]  and i knew it was classic communism and so i said i better fight this that's what i it's the same
[02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:10.080]  path as your dad so i think we were on many levels the same paths uh him just earlier back in the
[02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:15.360]  70s you know right around the time i was born so tell us some stories about larry grathwald because
[02:37:15.360 --> 02:37:20.720]  now these are the type of patriots that literally we would have lost by now it wasn't for their instinct
[02:37:20.720 --> 02:37:27.600]  he wasn't directed by government he did it on his own just like i did yeah he did he um he always
[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:33.680]  said he felt that he did it because it was the right thing to do and i i definitely know where
[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:39.760]  he's coming from because i i feel the same way with what i'm doing i i feel like i can't there's
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:46.480]  no way i can just stand back and watch you know them take over my country can't do it um there's
[02:37:46.480 --> 02:37:52.480]  a couple story i mean one thing with my dad um he you know for a lot of years the bill airs and
[02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:57.680]  burning during the weather underground they they were really quiet um throughout the 80s and and
[02:37:57.680 --> 02:38:04.880]  even part of the 90s um and it wasn't until obama ran for office that you know they really came out
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:11.120]  and people started talking who obama lived with in college just wanted to add that right um yeah
[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:17.280]  my dad did a lot of extensive research on as you know because you spoke to my dad many times and um
[02:38:17.280 --> 02:38:21.440]  you know every time we would you know we would research something we would find something else
[02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:25.680]  there was always something they weren't just neighbors and they weren't just it wasn't just
[02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:32.640]  a man in the neighborhood like he wanted to say um so my dad you know it he felt you know
[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:36.880]  but he needed to get out he needed to speak up because here's this man running for president
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:43.040]  who is an outright communist to marxist communist and so my dad got out and and really tried to
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:49.120]  speak with people and um we ended up going to st mary's college bill airs um spoke at st mary's
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:56.480]  college i i want to say it was in 2010 maybe and your dad confronted yeah well my dad tried to um
[02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:01.520]  the thing about that was is that when my dad got to the front of the line bill airs abruptly
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:07.840]  ended the q and a session and ran out the back door we followed him like we my dad myself and a
[02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:13.120]  few other people we followed them and he got in a car and he drove away it wasn't long after that
[02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:21.040]  that i found out that bill airs son um malik dorne he he goes by malik dorne instead of malik airs
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:28.320]  is an actual he's a teacher in a middle school here in the same district that i live in so in in
[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:34.880]  the bay area so he bill airs spends quite a bit of time here in the bay area um i also when i
[02:39:34.880 --> 02:39:39.600]  started doing research of online tifa and like refuse fascism and bam and all these domestic
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:46.960]  terrorist groups of today i found that um bill airs was actually here during one of the uh the
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:52.480]  riots that you know happened in berkeley i think it was in april um he was actually here in the
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:58.800]  bay area he was helping them make signs um so he is very active and very involved in this which i
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:04.320]  wasn't surprised of course so obama was their next foundation ford foundation carnage endowment
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:08.560]  all came out in the frank church committee hearings in the in the 70s that good liberals
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:12.720]  exposed the communist takeover plan with the foundations it wasn't just conservatives this
[02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:17.920]  is so monstrous when the average person is is faced with this they just they just can't believe it
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:24.240]  but what was it like for your dad to then see once obama came out to see the whether underground
[02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:30.400]  terrorists come out from under their rocks after two decades of hibernation just absolutely
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:36.000]  mind-blowing you know it's like and i can now i can even understand even more because of what
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:41.440]  i'm witnessing today how bad it is now even as opposed to where it was you know before my dad
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:48.240]  passed away but it is just mind-blowing that and what was even more mind-blowing is that you know
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:54.160]  as much as people would get out and talk like you know you and and my dad and so many people
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:59.040]  you know trevor allowed in you know getting out there and trying to show the actual facts and
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:05.120]  that the proof that this man is not what he claims to be and nobody was listened it was very just
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:08.720]  but what is it like now to see people really are starting to wake up now do you agree
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:15.920]  oh i love it you know it motivates me it motivates me a lot to get out there and do more because
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:20.160]  you know it's like finally you know people are waking up and seeing it and and i feel like
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:28.880]  i mean because it's so obvious now i mean that people that um that used to be liberal are coming
[02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:33.840]  out to me and and saying you know wow like especially after our rallies and they got canceled
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:39.040]  here in the bay area i have people coming to me and apologizing to me for having you know for
[02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:43.040]  us having to count them for people you know them exactly a lot of liberals are deciding they're
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:48.560]  still liberal and they're not joining this truly fascist communist organization you know we built
[02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:54.080]  up basketball players football players golf players all that is but but guys that are trailblazers
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:58.080]  like your dad you know really are the top of people that if we didn't have him because i can look at
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:02.320]  he was like patient zero but in a good way that's one of the first dominoes to discover this whole
[02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:08.880]  thing if it wasn't for him we would be way behind right now literally or ron paul or a matt drudge or
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:15.680]  somebody like you know during the red scare in the 1910s when the bolsheviks first started overthrowing
[02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:22.240]  the russian um government or monarchy then um the united states government started actually
[02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:28.400]  going and finding communists and deporting them even if they were u.s citizens and that's how serious
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:33.120]  they took the start of communism now we're to the point where in california it's legal for

[02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:38.800]  i have only heard everybody ranting and basically raving about how wonderful the knockout is and
[02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:43.680]  how it gives them the most vivid dreams they've ever had and the knockout and the brain force really
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:49.600]  kind of go together they pair together in a really nice way um that you don't become dependent on

[02:49:59.680 --> 02:50:04.640]  and here's an example i forget why i'm not taking it when my sleep is so much better
[02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:11.280]  it's amazing and all it is is 1995 the same amount of melatonin is in it it's another leading
[02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:18.160]  brands that cost 1995 but then we put in the altrip to fan all organic we put in uh the uh
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:24.720]  valerian root and other things and so it's it all works in synergy together great point about the
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:31.200]  knockout you want to have i max level movie theatrical dreams take the knockout what does
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:35.200]  that what happened for you yeah and we didn't talk about this beforehand a bunch of other
[02:50:35.200 --> 02:50:39.440]  people in the studio a bunch of the crew i've talked to you that take the knockout that's the
[02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:45.200]  valerian i take i have the most insane vivid dreams i've ever had in my life well it's all
[02:50:45.200 --> 02:50:51.680]  about wild sourcing and inorganics so we get different batches like the last batch was it was
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:58.320]  good but not super strong i take two the new batch came in and i mean it is it's funny you said that
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:04.800]  i'm taking one pill even when i'm sleepy it's just so much better i was about to say it is like
[02:51:05.600 --> 02:51:10.240]  you have really good vivid dreams but again we're not a big industrial deal this is all
[02:51:10.240 --> 02:51:15.040]  wildcrafted or you know organic source so each batch is different this particular batch is
[02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:19.520]  really uh lives up to the name knockout in fourslife.com and it really makes the globalist
[02:51:19.520 --> 02:51:23.840]  mad when you support us so please take action uh and support us today and just commit the sign
[02:51:23.840 --> 02:51:28.960]  up for auto ship to ten dollars uh or ten percent off on your order the knockout is thirty three
[02:51:28.960 --> 02:51:34.320]  percent off as well so that's also on sale that's right and again we don't raise the price and lower
[02:51:34.320 --> 02:51:38.240]  the price we really already have a discount on usually ten percent everything's always discounted
[02:51:38.240 --> 02:51:43.760]  ten percent because everybody likes sales but i'm just also now buying more and more from the big
[02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:49.760]  uh organic manufacturers that we get it from and so we're just leveraging up and up and up and up
[02:51:49.760 --> 02:51:54.400]  and up and as everybody knows you know they had buzzfeed test seven the products in california
[02:51:54.400 --> 02:51:58.960]  that has the highest standards in the world the the FDA has a thousand times a higher standard for
[02:51:58.960 --> 02:52:03.760]  lead or there could be a thousand percent more till they say there's a problem california says
[02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:08.800]  there has to be less lead in your products than there is in the air and it passed this thing but
[02:52:08.800 --> 02:52:13.920]  i said listen then there is in kale but i said folks the liberals never give up just just just know that
[02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:19.200]  okay i mean i mean you think that makes them mad absolutely uh and so they've almost bankrupted
[02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:23.840]  california it's it's it's truly amazing to watch california commit suicide like this and it's it's
[02:52:23.840 --> 02:52:29.040]  very very sad speaking of the devil you're out there in california larry grathwald's daughter
[02:52:29.040 --> 02:52:34.480]  joins us uh lindsey grathwald i've been doing a lot of the talking here and the time we have left
[02:52:34.480 --> 02:52:38.880]  both you ladies what are other points people should know about the clear and present danger of
[02:52:38.880 --> 02:52:42.400]  communism because milley during the break we'll do one more segment after this if you have time
[02:52:43.440 --> 02:52:48.640]  before john repport comes on you were talking about you know the communist bombings of the 1910s
[02:52:48.640 --> 02:52:53.760]  the 1920s alex here we're talking about that and i said yes they called them anarchist bombings but
[02:52:53.760 --> 02:52:58.480]  they were communists trying to overthrow the us that's why they deported a bunch of them and
[02:52:59.040 --> 02:53:03.280]  the same thing today the communists called themselves anarchists so they don't give their
[02:53:03.280 --> 02:53:08.160]  movement any blame while they destabilize the society you want to speak to that lindsey
[02:53:09.280 --> 02:53:15.280]  yeah well bill there i mean bill there's always called themselves an anarchist um i think he even
[02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:21.760]  probably said that when he was on your show that doesn't surprise me um he goes i'm not a communist
[02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:27.440]  i'm an anarchist alex i've never wanted violence what it's like it makes you wonder do these people
[02:53:27.440 --> 02:53:33.440]  have cognitive dissidents or are they a total disrespect for you and they're going to sit there
[02:53:33.440 --> 02:53:38.480]  and say no one's ever called for violence against congressman just top democrats they're just gas
[02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:45.200]  lighting everyone that's it yeah absolutely and and there i mean if you were when we went to
[02:53:45.200 --> 02:53:53.200]  uber glee for the even well the notamarksism rally that was canceled they i mean they actually
[02:53:53.200 --> 02:54:00.000]  showed up and i don't know if it was antifa or if it was bam what group it was but there was a big
[02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:06.800]  truck that actually showed up that actually they started um handing weapons and shields to the people
[02:54:06.800 --> 02:54:13.040]  on the street so i mean the earlier i wanted to say because we were talking earlier about the
[02:54:13.040 --> 02:54:19.200]  train eating you were saying that they're trained um they are definitely well trained a lot of them
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:26.400]  i saw it i saw it in berkeley and when i was up in portland for a rally i actually that there were
[02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:33.440]  actually uh signed in portland for antifa training at union building so not sure if you guys are
[02:54:33.440 --> 02:54:39.680]  aware of that but they do train in union union buildings up in portland wow again what would
[02:54:39.680 --> 02:54:45.280]  your father think that again the only man to ever infiltrate the uh the weather underground and survive
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:51.040]  and expose their plan to overthrow the u.s government bring in latin american communist forces just like
[02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:56.160]  red dawn and communist chinese and then put 50 million americans in forced labor camps and kill
[02:54:56.160 --> 02:54:59.840]  25 million of us and that was back with 70s numbers so it'd be about a hundred million they
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:03.920]  they want to put in camps and 50 mil they'd kill they've got to be upset they haven't gotten their
[02:55:03.920 --> 02:55:07.760]  plan yet to kill 50 mil but i've been around communists they tell you we're gonna kill people
[02:55:07.760 --> 02:55:11.360]  and you better get in line back when i was exposing bush for bad stuff he was doing
[02:55:11.360 --> 02:55:14.640]  communists would want to come on air they'd call themselves liberals and later at dinner they'd say
[02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:18.960]  listen you're a libertarian we're going to let you be part of it we're going to kill everybody
[02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:22.320]  we want to kill people they really get off on talking about killing people
[02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:31.440]  thickening it's thickening um i know i i mean my dad growing up i mean i i heard these stories
[02:55:31.440 --> 02:55:37.680]  my dad was pretty certain um that things like this would eventually happen and people called
[02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:43.200]  them crazy for it now not so much people are saying what's happening right now and you're
[02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:47.840]  seeing the violence and everything that's happening in the streets and in november 4
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:54.480]  i take that very seriously especially with the violence that i've seen firsthand to you know
[02:55:54.480 --> 02:56:01.920]  with myself and my friends um i have no doubt that they are in it to win it that they are in
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:07.760]  this to overthrow our government and to take over and this has been going on for decades it's not
[02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:13.680]  something new um a lot of people you know are just waking up to it so it's new to them but
[02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:18.560]  it's not new we know that let's be clear they don't want a republic where we elect people
[02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:23.280]  and where we have a constitutional democracy they want state-run pollock bureaus and central
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:26.960]  committees just like common to china because i've studied them the modern groups correct me if i'm
[02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:32.880]  wrong ladies their main model is china they see china and also north korea strangely enough is the
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:39.200]  model you know a lot of people are talking about how the strategic and best move might be to not
[02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:44.560]  go out and try to face these communists in the street and just let them go out and be terrorist
[02:56:44.560 --> 02:56:50.080]  so that we can then pressure our government officials to formally classify them as terrorist
[02:56:50.080 --> 02:56:53.840]  organizations well that's happening but if here's the problem they're smart like they'd bomb stuff
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:58.080]  in the 20s and call themselves anarchists or blame them on conservatives they clearly did
[02:56:58.080 --> 02:57:02.720]  mandalay he was a leftist operative with with ices people that we've got the evidence it's all come
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:08.560]  out now they will do a tax and blame it on america that the problem is they've got to be stopped
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:14.000]  yes absolutely i we believe that that's what they were trying to do with our rallies in the
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:19.040]  bay area is that they wanted the violent somewhere to starlet's bill and then it was going to turn
[02:57:19.040 --> 02:57:25.120]  on us it was going to be we caused it our people did all this and the violence is on us not them
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:31.520]  that's right stay right there lindsey grathwell her father a true hero exposing the murderous

[03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:47.200]  melly we were you got cut off by the break you've survived a lot of anti-confrontation charlottesville
[03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:52.800]  many trips to uh berkeley just it's like going to north korea or something and then
[03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:58.080]  lindsay grathwald daughter of just a real hero larry grathwald cheers so just other points you
[03:00:58.080 --> 03:01:03.520]  ladies like to make the left likes to criticize president trump for initially not coming out
[03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:10.480]  hard enough against the alt right elements that were out there in charlottesville and the reason
[03:01:10.480 --> 03:01:14.160]  why the mainstream media is coming after him well we know many reasons they they hate him
[03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:19.440]  they want to take him down but why did trump not come out so hard against them well because it
[03:01:19.440 --> 03:01:25.200]  wasn't being reported how vicious and militant the antifa work we came out against both and
[03:01:25.840 --> 03:01:31.040]  but yeah he did come out against both but what i want to make very clear here is that although
[03:01:31.040 --> 03:01:36.720]  some elements on the right had vile views okay which i even got into debates with them because
[03:01:36.720 --> 03:01:41.120]  some of them work openly fashion but i mean all three leaders were democrats the the
[03:01:42.320 --> 03:01:49.680]  antifa side came out there prepared with weapons they started balloons exactly violent so i think
[03:01:49.680 --> 03:01:54.480]  that you know he was looking into it before he initially made those statements but the reality
[03:01:54.480 --> 03:02:01.040]  here is that um what i will say is this the antifa did win that battle they did i saw it i saw it
[03:02:01.040 --> 03:02:06.080]  happen the alt right people retreat but they lost the war that's right because a month later they
[03:02:06.080 --> 03:02:10.960]  attacked peaceful people at a prayer rally in san francisco where our guest lives and then polosi
[03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:15.040]  even had to turn against them how big a deal was that lindsey grathwald and why do you think they
[03:02:15.040 --> 03:02:19.520]  finally a week after that san francisco attack on peaceful prayer vigils calling black people
[03:02:19.520 --> 03:02:23.200]  they were beating up nazis because they were christians why did polosi and others have to
[03:02:23.200 --> 03:02:30.480]  retreat from the vicious activities of antifa i think she had to um because well if there were
[03:02:30.480 --> 03:02:37.040]  it wasn't just uh citizens that got hurt that day it was there were actually people in the
[03:02:37.040 --> 03:02:43.040]  media that were there that antifa turned on and started beating up that sunday um in berkeley
[03:02:43.040 --> 03:02:48.880]  think about that a bunch of beta cup cowards so vicious in a gang they beat up anybody
[03:02:48.880 --> 03:02:54.400]  they can get their hands on that is the just it's just the the the lawless idiot weakness
[03:02:54.400 --> 03:03:00.400]  witness of them it's like there's nothing worse than wimps a big tough guy being a thugs bad there's
[03:03:00.400 --> 03:03:05.120]  nothing about about a bunch of cowards ganging up on some you know fat guy and beating him up
[03:03:05.920 --> 03:03:12.880]  right i mean i witnessed that day in particular i witnessed i i actually went in with um joey
[03:03:12.880 --> 03:03:20.560]  gibson who is uh patriot prayer he um him and i we went there and i was with i was behind him
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:25.760]  as he walked in i'm sure people see the videos of him walking in with his arms up you know saying
[03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:32.960]  peace um i was about 150 200 people behind him but i blended in with the crowd nobody recognized me
[03:03:32.960 --> 03:03:40.080]  i watched them you know mace them and beat them um while the cops did absolutely nothing the cops
[03:03:40.080 --> 03:03:46.320]  stood down they did they didn't help and it wasn't just you know joey i watched a father and son get
[03:03:46.320 --> 03:03:52.560]  beat up that day right in front of the police you see in the video that you're you're showing the
[03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:58.880]  video of you can see joey and tiny actually end up um they end up where the police are standing
[03:03:58.880 --> 03:04:04.000]  there's a line of police and they had to push their way through i was in that crowd i i i was
[03:04:04.000 --> 03:04:10.800]  blessed i i was very lucky that day um but i mean i witnessed many many instances like that
[03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:17.200]  and it was very sad because um yeah i know the city and i know the barry has spent millions of dollars
[03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:24.480]  for extra you know police force that day however the police did nothing and exactly and for those
[03:04:24.480 --> 03:04:28.720]  watching on tv they see it but these are black guys having people throw things at them and say
[03:04:28.720 --> 03:04:34.080]  they're racist nazis because they come to a prayer rally and you know and white guys being
[03:04:34.080 --> 03:04:38.800]  attacked it's just and you name it let's talk again lindsey grathwald i know you don't have a
[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:42.640]  website you're not plugging anything but one of your friends uh i think as a fundraiser going

[03:06:19.280 --> 03:06:27.440]  studios it's alex jones well we tend to leave the most important so last that's why we're in the
[03:06:27.440 --> 03:06:32.640]  fourth hour coming up is john rapaport of no more fake news dot com said that type of 15 years
[03:06:33.680 --> 03:06:39.360]  but the globalists claim they trademark copyright fake news saying we're the fake news when we just
[03:06:39.360 --> 03:06:46.560]  keep proving what we're saying over and over again we just have this breaking fbi helps
[03:06:46.560 --> 03:06:51.680]  rescue 84 children from a sex trafficking ring that's a new breaking story it's almost every day
[03:06:51.680 --> 03:06:56.800]  but snopes says there is no uptick in child molesters and child traffickers getting busted
[03:06:56.800 --> 03:07:04.480]  you know the numbers show a six-fold increase from 2016 millie well snopes has been caught many
[03:07:04.480 --> 03:07:11.920]  times trying to cover for the left and they claim things are false that people have proven to be true
[03:07:11.920 --> 03:07:19.040]  so i don't really see snopes as a very accurate source for fact checking that's right and again
[03:07:19.040 --> 03:07:23.120]  it's almost every day we see these busts and they just keep saying there's no such thing as pedophilia
[03:07:23.760 --> 03:07:27.920]  that's why they created the pizza gate deal there was pizza code in the pedestrian emails which the
[03:07:27.920 --> 03:07:34.720]  fbi says is for uh child pornography cheese pizza things like that then the cnn new york times
[03:07:34.720 --> 03:07:38.960]  washington post all focus on a pizza place he'd go to hoping we'd all cover it and look at it we
[03:07:38.960 --> 03:07:43.520]  go look at it cover some of the weird anomalies they didn't say that we said hillary was in their
[03:07:43.520 --> 03:07:48.080]  killing kids in the basement which we hadn't and then now write articles every day saying there's
[03:07:48.080 --> 03:07:51.920]  no such thing as pedophilia it's not the catholic church the deputy pope just didn't get arrested
[03:07:51.920 --> 03:07:56.000]  which he did and it just doesn't exist just like they said there's no sexual abuse in hollywood
[03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:01.840]  i've talked to people both in the hollywood entertainment industry that were sexually molested
[03:08:01.840 --> 03:08:07.760]  as kids i've talked to people that were sexually molested by high-ranking high-level politicians
[03:08:07.760 --> 03:08:13.920]  when they were underage and i can't name names um it was all off the record but i will say that i
[03:08:13.920 --> 03:08:18.960]  have no doubt in my mind that eventually these truths will come to life and we've been saying
[03:08:18.960 --> 03:08:23.760]  this for months now it's in mainstream news the week reports hollywood sitting on a pedophile
[03:08:23.760 --> 03:08:29.520]  scandal uh we've got uh kory feldman hints at naming hollywood pedophiles that's the next
[03:08:29.520 --> 03:08:35.280]  big shoe to drop and we've got the directors of the film that they're reporting on in the week

[03:08:56.480 --> 03:09:00.960]  daughter of larry grathwald the green beret that was going to college and then just uh
[03:09:00.960 --> 03:09:04.400]  infiltrated the weather underground was the only person that'd be able to do it because
[03:09:04.400 --> 03:09:08.240]  he was right there they knew he was for real enrolled before he even tried where they planned
[03:09:08.240 --> 03:09:14.480]  to take over the country and put 50 million of us in death camps and kill half of those 25 million
[03:09:14.480 --> 03:09:18.880]  uh total but i was saying now come back on and soon with any other tidbits you didn't get to
[03:09:18.880 --> 03:09:24.400]  what she said how about the death of my dad i knew he was on a book tour and he was on a tour
[03:09:24.400 --> 03:09:28.640]  following bill errs around the country the founder and head of the weather underground and the guy
[03:09:28.640 --> 03:09:36.240]  that uh barack obama lived with when he was going to college and she then then then brought up the
[03:09:36.240 --> 03:09:42.000]  mysterious nature of his death which i'd never never heard about so just briefly uh please tell us
[03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:53.360]  about that yeah um so he was on a break from his book tour um in july of 2013 and um i
[03:09:53.360 --> 03:09:58.080]  we had been trying to get a hold of him for well i talked to my dad very regularly and
[03:09:58.080 --> 03:10:03.440]  long story short we couldn't get a hold of him he wasn't responding and so i had to because my
[03:10:03.440 --> 03:10:09.200]  dad lived in Cincinnati and i still live here in california so i had to have someone go
[03:10:09.200 --> 03:10:16.640]  and check on him and um that's when my aunt discovered that he had passed away um because
[03:10:16.640 --> 03:10:24.560]  of the fact that he passed away alone and um you know there was no um you know obvious signs of you
[03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:30.320]  know what had happened they did an autopsy report which it took about eight to ten months i didn't
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:35.280]  get that autopsy report back for about i was i wanted to eight and a half nine months it took
[03:10:35.280 --> 03:10:40.880]  and when i did get it back it was very vague all it said on there is that he died from lung cancer
[03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:47.440]  and that the onset of that lung cancer was years now the interesting thing about that is that my
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:54.080]  father you know he was a vet so he went to the ba quite often he was he had had health problems in
[03:10:54.080 --> 03:11:00.160]  the past that he was very adamant about going to the doctor and you know keeping himself healthy
[03:11:00.160 --> 03:11:09.280]  as much as he could and um he was never diagnosed with lung cancer wow so it was very shocking to
[03:11:09.280 --> 03:11:14.320]  all of us we we had all kind of thought that you know maybe he had passed away from a heart I mean
[03:11:14.320 --> 03:11:20.640]  you know my dad was 60 he was 67 years old so you know it was quite possible he could have passed
[03:11:20.640 --> 03:11:25.280]  away from a heart attack or a stroke or something like that and that's kind of what we had expected
[03:11:25.280 --> 03:11:33.440]  we did not expect lung cancer well this sounds very very very very suspicious uh that just sounds
[03:11:33.440 --> 03:11:37.680]  basically unheard of I remember him being on the air during that book tour and I said man be careful
[03:11:37.680 --> 03:11:42.400]  because as you know following Bill Ayers who also had a book tour around trying to confront him and
[03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:48.880]  then he dies same time they both came out with books around the same time both my dad and Bill Ayers
[03:11:48.880 --> 03:11:56.640]  well um yeah so yeah it it's something that um and then when I when I've tried to question it um
[03:11:57.200 --> 03:12:03.200]  the investigator who has been lead investigator you know um that day when they found my father
[03:12:03.200 --> 03:12:09.040]  that person no longer works with the the township that um that was there I can't get a hold of it
[03:12:09.040 --> 03:12:14.560]  nobody I mean basically when I try to get answers I I can't get any answers sure he may have had some
[03:12:14.560 --> 03:12:18.960]  lung cancer but it'd be a killing man you know without anybody knowing that's that sounds very rare
[03:12:18.960 --> 03:12:22.640]  could have died for something else then they go in he's had some cancer they claim that's it
[03:12:22.640 --> 03:12:26.960]  you were talking about one of your associates being facing prison time for something out there in
[03:12:26.960 --> 03:12:34.480]  uh in um San Francisco I guess yes tell us about that um so the bookstore that we were talking about
[03:12:34.480 --> 03:12:40.320]  earlier we were actually out there on Tuesday night and we went out to the bookstore you know just
[03:12:40.320 --> 03:12:47.120]  to wave our flags and afterwards we went to bar Kyle Chapman he also um people call him
[03:12:47.120 --> 03:12:52.960]  bass stick man he was with us and when we all the left you know we all on our separate ways
[03:12:52.960 --> 03:13:00.000]  he actually got attacked on Tuesday night um in his car they attacked his car um they sprayed
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:07.920]  bare mace at him into his car um it was crazy but um Kyle Chapman is you know he he's very um
[03:13:07.920 --> 03:13:15.280]  he's a great guy he's he's out there he was in Berkeley in March and in April when the police
[03:13:15.280 --> 03:13:19.680]  sit down and he was out there you know defending sure so what happened to him because we're about
[03:13:19.680 --> 03:13:26.880]  to be out of time um he is facing prison time so he does and I do that I gave you guys the website
[03:13:26.880 --> 03:13:31.920]  and um it's back to the right and and I remember reading about this so he gets attacked he fights
[03:13:31.920 --> 03:13:36.080]  back and not only do Berkeley police let you get attacked that's admitted they admit that they're
[03:13:36.080 --> 03:13:40.320]  proud of themselves uh and and they ban even students from from having free speech and it's
[03:13:40.320 --> 03:13:46.160]  not communist but then now they when they attack you you then get charged for it absolutely and so
[03:13:46.160 --> 03:13:51.440]  he's facing eight years prison possibly eight years prison time um for protecting and defending
[03:13:51.440 --> 03:13:57.120]  people so he's trying to raise money for his you know legal defense um you know all of us I mean

[03:18:20.800 --> 03:18:26.480]  business inside the us but they sat on the story for years allowing president obama to sign a

[03:20:13.680 --> 03:20:22.960]  john rap report here sitting in for alex and a fourth hour on info wars man so much to talk
[03:20:22.960 --> 03:20:31.360]  about here from the perspective of being a reporter which i've been for 30 35 years now
[03:20:32.160 --> 03:20:37.360]  here's the thing about the vagus story it's blowing up all over the world
[03:20:38.720 --> 03:20:48.240]  way beyond the capacity of major media or the cops or the fbi to deal with it this is a good thing
[03:20:48.240 --> 03:20:55.040]  a good thing folks that's why i named my site no more fake news back in 2001
[03:20:56.800 --> 03:21:00.160]  point i'm getting at here is do not let this story go away
[03:21:02.320 --> 03:21:09.600]  do not let it die because as we know mainstream news has already moved on it's over
[03:21:09.600 --> 03:21:14.800]  yeah boy that was really something now let's get to wine scene let's get to this let's get to that
[03:21:14.800 --> 03:21:24.080]  but what happened in vegas stays in vegas and what i'm saying is this is one of these opportunities
[03:21:25.760 --> 03:21:31.280]  where the more people that share these stories the real stories about what really happened there
[03:21:31.840 --> 03:21:38.880]  the real lies the real contradictions the more people are going to wake up as they see how
[03:21:38.880 --> 03:21:44.960]  major media are trying to choke this off and narrow it down to one crazy guy who is a shooter we
[03:21:44.960 --> 03:21:54.720]  don't know why we'll never know why the usual right but now online there is so much activity
[03:21:55.760 --> 03:22:02.000]  about this story in so many different places and so many stories being shared
[03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:08.960]  with millions and millions and millions of people looking and reading and waking up
[03:22:09.920 --> 03:22:16.720]  that we are engulfing the major media to the point where they're not even doing any more
[03:22:16.720 --> 03:22:22.400]  press conferences in vegas they said that no more that's it we don't want to hear anything
[03:22:22.400 --> 03:22:28.000]  more we don't want any of these distractions we don't want any of these questions from anybody
[03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:32.480]  no independent reporters can get in we're just going to cancel all the press conferences
[03:22:33.920 --> 03:22:37.920]  and the people the sheriff's department look like they're really under the gun and they are
[03:22:41.520 --> 03:22:52.000]  but if we independent media infowars keep on putting out more and more stories on the lies
[03:22:52.000 --> 03:23:03.600]  that are uncovered what's going to happen is we own the story we own the coverage not them
[03:23:05.120 --> 03:23:11.520]  they are the liars the government is lying major media are lying the cops are lying the FBI is
[03:23:11.520 --> 03:23:24.320]  lying picture it they get smaller we get bigger they get smaller we engulf them we expose them
[03:23:26.160 --> 03:23:33.040]  this is what happens this is the seesaw i've watched it for a long time since 1982
[03:23:33.040 --> 03:23:42.080]  who's on top who's on the bottom independent media major media alternative media major media
[03:23:43.760 --> 03:23:52.160]  this is our channel our pipeline to destroy globalism simple that's what's happening you know
[03:23:53.440 --> 03:23:58.320]  we're being told time and time and time again that the world is independent interdependent
[03:23:58.320 --> 03:24:05.360]  interconnected everything is connected to everything it's all one gigantic system and we can't possibly
[03:24:07.600 --> 03:24:15.600]  succeed we can't opt out it's all too you know it's all connected and you know this we've got
[03:24:15.600 --> 03:24:19.280]  this wonderful system and it's getting better all the time that's globalism talking
[03:24:19.280 --> 03:24:26.480]  and now they've got this thing called soft brexit have you heard of that
[03:24:30.720 --> 03:24:36.720]  Britain decided hey we're out of here bye bye European Union we're gone they took a vote
[03:24:37.760 --> 03:24:43.200]  why but basically because of the immigration policy that was being forced on all of Europe
[03:24:43.200 --> 03:24:49.600]  by the European Union that's why that's what happened people in England know what's going on with
[03:24:49.600 --> 03:24:57.280]  massive unscreened immigration they know that the disaster that it is as it keeps on going and going
[03:24:57.280 --> 03:25:03.280]  and going so they said we're getting out of the European Union all right so now the leaders
[03:25:03.280 --> 03:25:08.240]  and England are saying yeah but there's this thing called soft brexit and what that means is
[03:25:08.240 --> 03:25:14.800]  is yeah you can leave but you're really still part of it all the trade relations you had before
[03:25:14.800 --> 03:25:21.280]  you still have now there's still going to be waves of immigrants but you can say that you've left
[03:25:21.280 --> 03:25:27.600]  the European Union I mean this is how criminal and vicious disgusting slimy they are
[03:25:29.680 --> 03:25:36.160]  people want to get out Austria they want to get out I know people in Australia they want to get out
[03:25:36.160 --> 03:25:46.480]  of globalism of the system I don't care what you think about Trump love them hate him indifferent
[03:25:46.480 --> 03:25:56.400]  doesn't matter but the words that he spoke about globalism and nationalism have spread like wild
[03:25:56.400 --> 03:26:01.600]  fire around the world you can say well he never meant it ah he's a captain of the global side of
[03:26:01.600 --> 03:26:07.440]  this that is all upon to put up job but I don't care about anything I'm just telling you the effect
[03:26:08.480 --> 03:26:14.000]  the effect is on and on and on and on as people begin to wake up what are we doing in these
[03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:24.960]  international uh prisons called globalism technocracy why are we all connected in these
[03:26:24.960 --> 03:26:32.800]  insane trade deals why do we have to send millions of jobs out of the country to faraway places
[03:26:32.800 --> 03:26:39.360]  where they pay slave wages and they have no environmental regulations whatsoever so that
[03:26:39.360 --> 03:26:47.200]  people can be poisoned work 20 hours a day die bring on the new workers etc then export all these
[03:26:47.200 --> 03:26:52.720]  products back here you know it's a paradise it's wonderful folks this is globalism sure
[03:26:52.720 --> 03:26:58.880]  they really think this was going to go on forever and nobody was going to notice and nobody would
[03:26:58.880 --> 03:27:07.120]  care did limousine liberals in new york really think that all the unemployed people in the
[03:27:07.120 --> 03:27:12.240]  midwest people who were thrown out of good manufacturing jobs by globalism would never
[03:27:12.240 --> 03:27:18.400]  care would never raise their voices would never support somebody who was talking anti-globalism

[03:34:52.800 --> 03:35:00.400]  that's called exchanging something of worth for something else of worth a product
[03:35:01.840 --> 03:35:08.480]  and info wars funds its operation by selling products to people people buy the products they
[03:35:08.480 --> 03:35:15.120]  like them they get healthier they support the info war the information therefore continues to get out

[03:39:54.080 --> 03:40:02.320]  to china and see how it works let's not look at the capitalist operations that are going on in china
[03:40:02.320 --> 03:40:07.760]  you know the gigantic industry in commerce and trading everything no let's look at the other side
[03:40:07.760 --> 03:40:14.800]  of that where we keep tabs on everybody and everybody in china that's a lot of people folks
[03:40:14.800 --> 03:40:20.720]  is going to be on a facial recognition system and people will get points for good behavior which is
[03:40:20.720 --> 03:40:27.520]  very specifically defined and if you get good points you get ahead in life if you're a good
[03:40:27.520 --> 03:40:33.760]  communist a good citizen if you toe the line if you keep your eyes straight ahead if you're loyal
[03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:45.600]  and unquestioning if you accept your lot into life as assigned to you you get points and if
[03:40:45.600 --> 03:40:53.760]  you do the opposite you get prison that's called utopia folks that's called utopia
[03:40:53.760 --> 03:41:02.320]  that's behind the mask when you drop the mask of everything for nothing that's what you really see
[03:41:02.880 --> 03:41:09.840]  of course what else would you think workers of the world unite are going to take over the
[03:41:09.840 --> 03:41:17.440]  planet how's that going to operate we're going to have a gigantic somewhere in the goby desert

[03:41:25.920 --> 03:41:31.680]  run in the world is that really that's really what's going to happen no the communists inserted
[03:41:31.680 --> 03:41:36.880]  a little thing called you might remember it called dictatorship of the proletariat
[03:41:38.320 --> 03:41:46.400]  and that was you see while we're reaching utopia where everybody loves everybody and shares
[03:41:46.400 --> 03:41:52.400]  everything and there's no private property and nobody owns anything temporarily we need to have
[03:41:52.400 --> 03:41:57.840]  a transition phase and we call that the dictatorship of proletariat and that means
[03:41:58.640 --> 03:42:04.880]  not that the proletariat is the dictatorship although it sounds that way no it's that the
[03:42:04.880 --> 03:42:11.280]  few elite people who really are the wise ones who can see the total vision of communism they will
[03:42:11.280 --> 03:42:17.440]  rule over everybody else with an iron fist they will own all the companies all the businesses
[03:42:17.440 --> 03:42:22.720]  everything in the country and decide who produces what where and when and how much and where it

[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:46.320]  what this war is all about you don't really exist you see as yourself that's an illusion that you
[03:47:46.320 --> 03:47:53.840]  have you're really part of a great hole and this great hole is all moving in a direction that is
[03:47:53.840 --> 03:48:00.560]  good for humanity and we the leaders have seen that we know that and we're conducting the orchestra
[03:48:00.560 --> 03:48:10.240]  to arrive at a much better place who is going to believe that really i mean you have to be a
[03:48:10.240 --> 03:48:19.680]  complete moron to buy that tune really who are you anyway who are leading us in this direction
[03:48:19.680 --> 03:48:29.040]  the president of the european union unelected by anybody with you know a sense of his own
[03:48:29.040 --> 03:48:35.680]  entitlement the size of mount everest that's the guy who sees the future for all of us who can say
[03:48:35.680 --> 03:48:43.040]  to any one of us you don't really exist as a separate self as an individual that was all an
[03:48:43.040 --> 03:48:51.040]  illusion throughout history but now we know that you are a you know you're a little cell in a great
[03:48:51.040 --> 03:48:58.800]  body and we are the brain of that body and we are leading you into a much more glorious future so
[03:48:58.800 --> 03:49:10.720]  come with us that's the story folks that's the story of globalism it's cheap cheese cheap suit
[03:49:11.520 --> 03:49:24.320]  cheap rhetoric only a fool would buy it and so we're seeing the rejection of it by more and more
[03:49:24.320 --> 03:49:34.080]  people now you go to a place like silicon valley where the elite tech heads see how they can hook
[03:49:34.080 --> 03:49:43.200]  into this machine and make it work for them and they're all for globalism and they'll tell you
[03:49:43.200 --> 03:49:50.000]  how humanity is going to benefit from this because your brain is going to be hooked up to a super
[03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:56.560]  computer one day and then you'll have all the wisdom that's ever has existed throughout time
[03:49:56.560 --> 03:50:03.840]  and space they'll give you the biggest line of bs you've ever heard in your life because
[03:50:03.840 --> 03:50:11.600]  they see a way to hook up and make an advantage for themselves and be in a prime position with
[03:50:11.600 --> 03:50:25.120]  the surveillance state with censorship with the CIA will give you whatever you want etc etc etc
[03:50:25.120 --> 03:50:33.120]  so naturally they're suddenly going to be humanitarians of the highest order and they're
[03:50:33.120 --> 03:50:44.320]  going to lay it on thick and deep baby and so will titans of industry and the military industrial
[03:50:44.320 --> 03:50:50.000]  complex and the neocons and anybody else who can climb on the wagon university professors
[03:50:50.000 --> 03:50:57.520]  who will get grants and stipends and speaking fees and so on to write all kinds of gibberish
[03:50:57.520 --> 03:51:07.840]  about how the individual is out and the group is in which is the history of sociology for the last
[03:51:07.840 --> 03:51:14.480]  50 years you could sum it up okay folks here's the course the individual is out the group is in
[03:51:14.480 --> 03:51:19.200]  have you got it okay you all get a's you don't have to come to class for the rest of the year
[03:51:19.200 --> 03:51:33.040]  that's it that's the lesson globalism wants to take you this is not abstract okay they want to
[03:51:33.040 --> 03:51:42.480]  take you and your family and turn you into little tiny cells in the great body of the future of this
[03:51:42.480 --> 03:51:51.360]  planet no nations no borders no traditions no customs no local populations what do you think
[03:51:51.360 --> 03:51:57.120]  massive immigration and open borders is really all about forget all the hype and this and that
[03:51:57.120 --> 03:52:04.240]  and whatever that's what it's about let's bring in so many people to so many places
[03:52:04.240 --> 03:52:11.120]  that after a while you can't recognize anything as it existed before and no one has any memory
[03:52:11.120 --> 03:52:18.560]  of the past in that place no one can remember the culture the art the music the philosophy
[03:52:20.000 --> 03:52:30.880]  the technology the science it's all gone there's just masses of roiling people everywhere on the
[03:52:30.880 --> 03:52:41.360]  planet that's the precursor to globalism that's what it's all about that's why it's happening
[03:52:41.360 --> 03:52:50.000]  and that's why all these vicious front groups are being deployed in order to keep it that way to
[03:52:50.000 --> 03:52:55.840]  keep the doors open everywhere and to say that anybody who even has a question about this
[03:52:55.840 --> 03:53:05.840]  who even proposes the possibility of somehow that there should be a ceiling on this immigration
[03:53:06.880 --> 03:53:18.880]  is a horrible criminal vile racist because that's the globalist agenda is to keep the
[03:53:18.880 --> 03:53:32.160]  doors everywhere open that's why when they say erase borders that's not just a slogan that's
[03:53:32.160 --> 03:53:42.880]  what they're doing that's what they're trying to do and so part of the great awakening is when
[03:53:42.880 --> 03:53:50.320]  people who live in a place called a country that has a name suddenly say no no no no no no no
[03:53:52.480 --> 03:53:59.280]  we don't want that we never did we see what you're doing we see where you're going
[03:53:59.280 --> 03:54:18.080]  we're not signing up for that no absolutely not out out the globalists never wanted that kind of
[03:54:18.080 --> 03:54:25.680]  conversation they never wanted anybody to really see what they were doing or understand the reason
[03:54:25.680 --> 03:54:35.120]  why they were hoping to skate by without that ever happening but it happened and it's still happening
[03:54:35.120 --> 03:54:44.880]  all the time you can see it you know it you can feel it
[03:54:44.880 --> 03:54:54.080]  it how did we wake up one day and all of a sudden the rhetoric and the doctrine was
[03:54:55.520 --> 03:54:59.760]  you don't really live in america that's just a fiction see that was an illusion
[03:55:02.400 --> 03:55:09.200]  you were always living in a much larger sphere only you didn't see it where did this come from
[03:55:09.200 --> 03:55:15.200]  oh who passed that rule where was that meeting that i missed where this was all decided you see
[03:55:15.200 --> 03:55:22.160]  like it sprang up as if out of nowhere and everybody was on the same teleprompter oh sure
[03:55:22.160 --> 03:55:29.840]  and i'm talking people from the spiritual side of things to the hard political side of things
[03:55:29.840 --> 03:55:38.160]  to the economics if they have their bases covered oh yes we are all together in the cosmos
[03:55:38.160 --> 03:55:46.080]  floating along and when we translate that down into earthly existence we see that there is no
[03:55:46.080 --> 03:55:56.480]  more such thing as you or you or any individual really really where did you get that from
[03:55:58.000 --> 03:56:07.840]  who got inside your brain and put that message there because excuse me but i seem to remember
[03:56:07.840 --> 03:56:13.280]  that when this thing called a republic was formed and the founders and the documents you
[03:56:13.280 --> 03:56:19.120]  remember that right declaration constitution so forth that if you actually read these things
[03:56:19.120 --> 03:56:29.280]  now now you see that everything was structured to have severely limited government the absolute
[03:56:29.280 --> 03:56:40.640]  opposite of globalism in order to maximize the individual and his freedom and his liberty
[03:56:40.640 --> 03:56:50.800]  and his vision for himself and his future that was the message otherwise why limit the government
[03:56:50.800 --> 03:57:00.000]  right come on there'd be no reason to limit the government unless the entire stress was on the
[03:57:00.000 --> 03:57:09.200]  individual we're trying to maximize the liberty of the individual and free him from what was
[03:57:09.200 --> 03:57:14.560]  historically the chains of oppression divine right to rule of kings and the monarchs and the
[03:57:14.560 --> 03:57:25.600]  priest class theocracies and all of that and and now there you are here i am this is info wars
[03:57:25.600 --> 03:57:42.080]  it's been nice talking with you carry the message forward john rappaport see you next time
