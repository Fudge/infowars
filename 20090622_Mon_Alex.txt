[00:00.000 --> 00:13.660]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:13.660 --> 00:24.500]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:24.500 --> 00:34.000]  We have another incredibly important broadcast lineup for you today. Extremely important.
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.920]  And we're going to have wide open phones. We have a state senator joining us, dealing
[00:36.920 --> 00:42.640]  with the federal and state land grabs, water grabs, going on around the nation. Just off
[00:42.640 --> 00:47.360]  the charts, information today we're going to be breaking down. It is the 22nd day of
[00:47.360 --> 00:53.400]  June on this Monday edition. So again, thank you so much for joining us on the 22nd day
[00:53.400 --> 01:02.660]  of June 2009 on this Monday worldwide broadcast against tyranny as we wage war on corruption,
[01:02.660 --> 01:09.900]  as we crash through the lies and disinformation. All right, here are some of the headlines.
[01:09.900 --> 01:15.580]  Obviously, we're going to go over what's happening in Iran. This is really shaping up bad, bad
[01:15.580 --> 01:21.180]  for the Iranian people, bad for the people of the United States, bad for the world. Kissinger's
[01:21.180 --> 01:24.500]  confirmed they're getting ready to probably go ahead and hit Iran. Israel's getting ready
[01:24.500 --> 01:30.100]  to hit Iran. This is all propaganda, the stage revolution. A lot of well-meaning people
[01:30.100 --> 01:38.340]  involved in it to sell the West on leveling, leveling the major cities of Iran like the
[01:38.340 --> 01:44.720]  capital Tehran. Very sophisticated, multi-level chess. We'll be breaking that down coming
[01:44.720 --> 01:48.580]  up also the North Korea situation. They're saying they're going to go ahead and fire
[01:48.580 --> 01:54.900]  nukes if their ship is stopped. This is huge Cuban Missile Crisis level situation. And
[01:54.900 --> 02:02.500]  the news is busy talking about Sasha Baron Cohen and trying to set Ron Paul up in a hotel
[02:02.500 --> 02:07.460]  room. I mean, this is just the type of insanity we're dealing with and the attacks we're dealing
[02:07.460 --> 02:13.620]  with here. And then, of course, there's this news I covered some yesterday, but it's just
[02:13.620 --> 02:18.160]  so huge that I'm not going to just drop it. Proposed law allows A.G. Holder to block gun
[02:18.160 --> 02:25.820]  sales to over a million Americans. The reason that's a big issue is the New York Times.
[02:25.820 --> 02:30.100]  We've been telling you about this for months. It's in the Obama deception. They're saying
[02:30.100 --> 02:36.900]  it's good and basically allow the government to ban anybody owning guns they want. In fact,
[02:36.900 --> 02:40.820]  guys, I was looking through my stack and I hit print this morning on it again and I
[02:40.820 --> 02:44.660]  don't have it. I have our article about it. Proposed law allows A.G. Holder to block gun
[02:44.660 --> 02:48.120]  sales to over a million Americans and growing by 20 plus thousand a month.
[02:48.120 --> 02:53.020]  Jeremy, you go to this article and the first links New York Times and print me that I want
[02:53.020 --> 02:57.780]  to read from them. I mean, the sickeningness of how they're selling. Oh, we'll just ban
[02:57.780 --> 03:01.380]  all of you owning guns with no judge, no jury, no arrest, no way to know why you're on the
[03:01.380 --> 03:05.780]  list. No way to find out how you got on the list. No way to get off the list. Just, you
[03:05.780 --> 03:12.060]  know, same thing. Stalin did. Same thing. Mounted. Same thing. Hitler did. And then
[03:12.060 --> 03:18.580]  on top of that, the Iranian protest, another U.S. or street of color revolution. Again,
[03:18.580 --> 03:24.460]  I'm going to be breaking that down. Confidential memo reveals U.S. plan to provoke an invasion
[03:24.460 --> 03:28.900]  of Iraq. This is in the London Guardian confirmed, declassified. Well, this is the White House
[03:28.900 --> 03:33.700]  memo, not the Downing Street memo. The White House memo. This is in my film, Terror Storm
[03:33.700 --> 03:38.500]  released three and a half years ago. I'm not tooting our horn, but it's now big breaking
[03:38.500 --> 03:43.900]  news that it was all completely staged and a provocation and they had no intent of letting
[03:43.900 --> 03:49.180]  Saddam negotiate that they were going to stage shoot down of U.S. aircraft. Yes, stage terror
[03:49.180 --> 03:55.700]  attacks. Absolutely, baby. It's in the Army Captain manual. Captains and above in the
[03:55.700 --> 04:00.980]  army. Special forces captains and above are taught out of stage terror attacks and blaming
[04:00.980 --> 04:06.780]  on their enemies. It is in official manuals, just like a canteen and an M16 and they issued
[04:06.780 --> 04:13.380]  two, two, three rounds just like their backpacks, just like their boots. How does preferably
[04:13.380 --> 04:19.020]  blow little kids up and blame it on people? That's who runs our government illegitimate
[04:19.020 --> 04:24.740]  narcotics trafficking scum. And I'm risking my life and I'm not pulling any punches to
[04:24.740 --> 04:29.700]  tell you this stuff. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going full bore against these people because
[04:29.700 --> 04:33.940]  the same banks that want to blow Iran to bits, want to blow the United States financially
[04:33.940 --> 04:40.700]  to blitz and I'm not going to be part of it. Ah, DOD training manual describes all protests
[04:40.700 --> 04:48.020]  as terrorism. Don't forget that because there's two new reports, two new reports saying gun
[04:48.020 --> 04:53.820]  owners, Constitution Party, you are terrorists, period. And mainstream news is now coming out
[04:53.820 --> 05:00.340]  saying that you bet you are. Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[05:00.340 --> 05:04.740]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[05:04.740 --> 05:08.980]  this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[05:08.980 --> 05:14.220]  bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[05:14.220 --> 05:18.940]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[05:18.940 --> 05:23.340]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[05:23.340 --> 05:27.140]  is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number
[05:27.140 --> 05:31.420]  four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands
[05:31.420 --> 05:35.780]  of families lose their power from weather related outages. Number five, a solar power
[05:35.780 --> 05:40.020]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe
[05:40.020 --> 05:44.700]  in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours.
[05:44.700 --> 05:52.300]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government
[05:52.300 --> 06:01.420]  doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365. In the New
[06:01.420 --> 06:07.260]  World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear. We've got
[06:07.260 --> 06:13.260]  to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just
[06:13.260 --> 06:18.940]  as well funded. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for
[06:18.940 --> 06:27.900]  the best interests of the American people. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[06:27.900 --> 06:34.180]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers
[06:34.180 --> 06:39.420]  and finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left or right. It's about a one
[06:39.420 --> 06:45.780]  world government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and
[06:45.780 --> 06:52.700]  his real agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download

[08:04.020 --> 08:10.980]  deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio
[08:10.980 --> 08:24.460]  Network. Even the Wall Street Journal's CNN Fox News admit that they're using images
[08:24.460 --> 08:30.660]  of dead and dying Iranians as a propaganda war as a pretext to launch a military bombardment
[08:30.660 --> 08:35.300]  of the country. That will destabilize the world further. Another piece of the puzzle
[08:35.300 --> 08:39.500]  will fall to the New World Order, and they will only encourage the globalists to move
[08:39.500 --> 08:50.340]  into the next nation on their grand chessboard, their whole planetary takeover system. So we're
[08:50.340 --> 08:58.340]  going to be going over that today. And all of this goes together. What's happening domestically,
[08:58.340 --> 09:02.940]  what's happening internationally, the Cuban Missile Crisis Part II going on with North
[09:02.940 --> 09:08.620]  Korea. We're going to break it all down today. We don't have a guest until the third hour,
[09:08.620 --> 09:12.860]  dealing with different criminal activities of the state government in Texas, but it's
[09:12.860 --> 09:17.540]  also going on around the country. How the police just pull you over, take your wallet,
[09:17.540 --> 09:22.020]  take your cash, take your car. If you argue with them, they beat you up in many cities
[09:22.020 --> 09:25.460]  in Texas. It's on record, and the police don't even lie about it. They just defend it and
[09:25.460 --> 09:31.420]  say, I've also got video shot by the police of any cop watch groups that come out and
[09:31.420 --> 09:37.180]  document police beating protesters in England. They come up and choke them out, and then
[09:37.180 --> 09:41.420]  the police release it and say, yes, we're allowed to choke you out now. I mean, it's
[09:41.420 --> 09:45.860]  choking women. They just walk up and say, you're not allowed to take photos of police.
[09:45.860 --> 09:51.060]  It's an act of terrorism, and they choke them out. I mean, America is just going down the
[09:51.060 --> 09:55.540]  rat hole. England is, we are almost as bad as Communist China. They don't go after me
[09:55.540 --> 09:58.980]  because I'm a big fish, and they know that would really draw attention out. They're
[09:58.980 --> 10:03.780]  right now just training their paramilitary police that it's completely normal, kosher,
[10:03.780 --> 10:08.860]  acceptable to just go absolutely wild on the public. This is all being done because the
[10:08.860 --> 10:11.700]  bankers are going to bankrupt everything. They're going to take everything all of us
[10:11.700 --> 10:15.540]  have got. They are going to give us no quarter, ladies and gentlemen. It is going to be savage
[10:15.540 --> 10:20.900] . You ain't seen nothing yet of this depression they're bringing us into. They've got us wrapped
[10:20.900 --> 10:26.020]  up in their black wings, and they're taking us right to hell. But I wanted to play this
[10:26.020 --> 10:32.540]  clip of this YouTuber. We linked up to him on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube, and
[10:32.540 --> 10:38.860]  I think he really concisely lays it out even better than I can. What's happening? We're
[10:38.860 --> 10:43.660]  just one of these issues, and we keep telling people. The Attorney General argued before
[10:43.660 --> 10:50.460]  Congress last year when he was just a lawyer for the Justice Department, the former Deputy
[10:50.460 --> 10:55.020]  Attorney General, for total gun ban bills. He argued before the Supreme Court for total
[10:55.020 --> 11:01.780]  ban, saying U.S. citizens deserve to own no firearms. Period. On record, Obama as a state
[11:01.780 --> 11:07.060]  senator and as a federal senator. Same thing. A wide outcheap of staff on record saying you're
[11:07.060 --> 11:10.740]  on the no fly list, no gun for you, you're not part of the American family. If we even
[11:10.740 --> 11:18.260]  think maybe you could be a terrorist, possibly. This is the essence of tyranny, the essence
[11:18.260 --> 11:28.300]  of maximum tyranny. The Krim dollar Krim, the heart, the core. And it's happened everywhere
[11:28.300 --> 11:34.060]  else. And so he lays it out. Well, I'll let him introduce himself and then we'll come
[11:34.060 --> 11:39.060]  back into all the rest. But they're openly official, not even secret Pentagon training
[11:39.060 --> 11:44.500]  manuals for all security forces and MPs that all protest is illegal in an act of terror.
[11:44.500 --> 11:49.460]  I told you we got the secret document months ago that the army watches me basically everywhere
[11:49.460 --> 11:55.780]  I go. I can't believe this country's turned into this. And they want it. They want to
[11:55.780 --> 11:59.580]  scare you. I've got all these reports from Kentucky and Missouri with the news acting
[11:59.580 --> 12:09.380]  like it's normal going. Yeah. All political parties, Constitution Party, libertarians,
[12:09.380 --> 12:16.260]  you're all terrorist. I mean, I just can't do these idiot newscasters feeling like they're
[12:16.260 --> 12:20.380]  part of the system realize this is all about. I mean, this isn't some boss hog tyranny.
[12:20.380 --> 12:28.380]  This is hardcore mechanized scientific, devastating variety. So many of you fools have decided
[12:28.380 --> 12:32.980]  to serve this have no idea what you're involved in. You've had it cushy and easy in this country.
[12:32.980 --> 12:36.860]  Our forebearer stood up for liberty. So you have no idea what tyranny's like. Well, you're
[12:36.860 --> 12:41.180]  going to get it the worst anybody's ever had it. I guess me right along with you. All right,
[12:41.180 --> 12:46.660]  here's the clip. All right, welcome back. And thanks for joining me. My name is Doc.
[12:46.660 --> 12:53.780]  And for those of you whose first time it is joining me and welcome. Um, today, um, I want
[12:53.780 --> 13:02.180]  to get right in talking about, um, you guys know about HR 21 59, right? The firearms and
[13:02.180 --> 13:08.660]  explosive dangerous terrorist act, right? Now, we know that that was that's that's has nothing
[13:08.660 --> 13:16.940]  to do with with terrorists, right? That bill criminalizes you selling a firearm to your
[13:16.940 --> 13:24.260]  buddy down the street or whatever. You can no longer do that. Um, you have to, well, this,
[13:24.260 --> 13:32.420]  this law, um, makes you have to take your firearm to a dealer, submit it, have them go
[13:32.420 --> 13:39.740]  through all the checks. And then if they pass, um, they can have the firearm. Um, it also
[13:39.740 --> 13:46.580]  keeps you from being able to will your firearms to someone else if you die. So, um, that's
[13:46.580 --> 13:52.100]  like the background of this there, there, but there, there, um, on Monday introducing
[13:52.100 --> 14:01.380]  a new law. Now this new law is this, this is the final phase folks. Okay. Um, this new
[14:01.380 --> 14:11.140]  law outlaws anyone on the watch list from buying guns, any guns. Okay. Um, on the terrorist
[14:11.140 --> 14:16.100]  watch list. Now that was at a million names in like January and it's been going up for
[14:16.100 --> 14:21.660]  about 20,000 names a month ever since. So you figure there's a million and a half Americans
[14:21.660 --> 14:27.700]  on that list, but they classified the list. So, uh, once it got, once we started, they
[14:27.700 --> 14:34.100]  figured out we were tracking who was on the list. They classified it. Um, so basically
[14:34.100 --> 14:41.460]  you have no idea who's on that list and, and it's my contention here today that over half
[14:41.460 --> 14:47.900]  of America is on that list, right now. And here's why. See, you need to go over to the
[14:47.900 --> 14:53.420]  Department of Homeland Security, Lexicon. Okay. And I'm going to post, um, as we go
[14:53.420 --> 14:59.300]  down the list, I'm just going to post, um, photos, um, down the list of the actual Lexicon
[14:59.300 --> 15:05.260]  itself. So you will understand when I talk to you about who is on this list and, and
[15:05.260 --> 15:11.100]  what this law is, is this new law is about. And it's to give Eric Holder the ability to
[15:11.100 --> 15:16.900]  ban any gun he wants and to ban anyone he wants from owning a gun and to automatically ban
[15:16.900 --> 15:24.700]  everybody who they've decided is a possible extremist, not an actual extremist, but a
[15:24.700 --> 15:28.020]  possible extremist. Now I'm going to take you over here to this New York Times article
[15:28.020 --> 15:33.980]  because it illustrates it very well. Um, right here, uh, uh, it's the third paragraph down.
[15:33.980 --> 15:37.220]  I'm going to read the whole thing, the whole sentence to you and then I'm going to break
[15:37.220 --> 15:42.540]  it down for you. It says, uh, gun purchases must be approved unless federal officials
[15:42.540 --> 15:47.660]  can find some other disqualification of the would be buyer, like being a felon, an illegal
[15:47.660 --> 15:55.180]  immigrant or a drug addict. Hold up. Now let's flip that around, right? What they're
[15:55.180 --> 16:00.260]  saying is, is, uh, uh, let's put that in plain English into a statement, right? That makes
[16:00.260 --> 16:07.140]  a little bit of sense that what they're saying here is gun purchases must be approved
[16:07.140 --> 16:16.100]  for non felons, legal immigrants and non drug addicts. Okay. Gun purchases must be approved
[16:16.100 --> 16:22.780]  for non felons, legal immigrants and non drug addicts. Okay. Do you understand that? That's
[16:22.780 --> 16:29.460]  normal folks. They got to be approved for you. If, if a normal you goes in to buy a gun,
[16:29.460 --> 16:36.220]  they have to approve it because you've done nothing wrong. What this law does is gives
[16:36.220 --> 16:43.660]  them new reasons to disqualify perfectly legal citizens from owning firearms. And that's
[16:43.660 --> 16:51.380]  going to get into the lexicon. Okay. The lexicon criminalizes the entire world. Or at least
[16:51.380 --> 16:57.780]  if you're an American, it criminalizes every viewpoint there is and puts you down as an
[16:57.780 --> 17:02.340]  extremist. If you don't believe me, we will go through the list. There's animal rights
[17:02.340 --> 17:08.700]  activists, any type you're on the list. There's an idealist. In other words, if you just have
[17:08.700 --> 17:16.260]  ideas that you believe in, like religion or, or like right and wrong, or that there should
[17:16.260 --> 17:22.020]  be any type of standard whatsoever. If you believe strongly in that, there is a section
[17:22.020 --> 17:27.260]  in a lexicon that says you're an extremist that automatically disqualifies you from firearms.
[17:27.260 --> 17:35.820]  Okay. Now, if you're for or against abortion, you're there. If you're an atheist, you're
[17:35.820 --> 17:41.820]  there. If you don't believe in technology, you're there. If you believe in God, any God
[17:41.820 --> 17:49.340]  of any type, you are there. If you believe in the constitution, you are there. The patriot
[17:49.340 --> 17:55.140]  movement, a new addition, folks. If you are a patriot, if you believe in this country,
[17:55.140 --> 18:00.700]  in other words, any single person who was alive during World War II that waved a flag
[18:00.700 --> 18:06.260]  is now an extremist and under this bill will not be able to own firearms. Okay, but here's
[18:06.260 --> 18:14.500]  the deal, right? This is what this is, okay? When Chairman, when, when, when Chairman Mao
[18:14.500 --> 18:20.060]  took over China and killed a hundred million people, the first thing they did was pass
[18:20.060 --> 18:29.500]  law identical to this one, to disarm all people who had any belief system that was at odds
[18:29.500 --> 18:36.420]  with conflict theory or socialism, okay? And they disarmed them, and then they starved
[18:36.420 --> 18:41.300]  them to death, or they rounded them up and stuck them in forced labor camps, which they
[18:41.300 --> 18:48.060]  still do to this very day, except now that they, they harvest out if you're Christian
[18:48.060 --> 18:53.380]  or Falon Gong or whatever, they take your blood type, your tissue sample, and then they
[18:53.380 --> 19:01.260]  sell your organs to the world. How much money do you want to bet that old Mr. Microsoft
[19:01.260 --> 19:06.340]  and his liver transplant that he bought some Christian or some Falon Gong's liver from
[19:06.340 --> 19:10.860]  China? I'll bet money on that, you know what I mean? Because that's what they do. They
[19:10.860 --> 19:17.740]  sell the organs to the highest bidder. So let's move on to Stalin, okay? Now, this
[19:17.740 --> 19:25.340]  is the identical laws to what Stalin did, okay? You know why they're identical, folks?
[19:25.340 --> 19:30.260]  They're identical because they were given these laws by the same people who are running
[19:30.260 --> 19:36.020]  these other public governments. Communism did not spring up on its own. Communism was
[19:36.020 --> 19:39.500]  created. Alright, folks, I'll give you the channel's
[19:39.500 --> 19:43.220]  name. I was looking for my stack when we come back. It's up on the Alex Jones channel
[19:43.220 --> 19:48.300]  on YouTube, but the guy really, really lays it out. He's 100% right. And actually, half
[19:48.300 --> 19:51.940]  of Americans are on the list. I'll explain. We'll come back and finish the clip. Stay
[19:51.940 --> 20:06.100]  with us. In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the
[20:06.100 --> 20:11.740]  spear. We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all
[20:11.740 --> 20:17.140]  of us would like to see. The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is
[20:17.140 --> 20:21.940]  working for the best interests of the American people. While Obama's already fudging, he's
[20:21.940 --> 20:26.460]  fudged since day one in this election. If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[20:26.460 --> 20:32.860]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and
[20:32.860 --> 20:39.860]  finance oligarchs, that's fascism. It's not about left to right. It's about a one-world
[20:39.860 --> 20:46.500]  government. This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real
[20:46.500 --> 20:53.340]  agenda. Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super
[20:53.340 --> 21:00.380]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv. The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[21:00.380 --> 21:05.620]  Good day. Jim Newcomer from Ida's Resources, June 22, 2009. Gold opened this morning at
[21:05.620 --> 21:12.860]  $9.2370. A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.5033, $4.7517 for a half ounce, and
[21:12.860 --> 21:20.460]  $2.3758 for a quarter ounce. That's $9.5033, $4.7517, and $2.3758.
[21:20.460 --> 21:24.980]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed
[21:24.980 --> 21:28.740]  the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a
[21:28.740 --> 21:32.900]  privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes
[21:32.900 --> 21:37.580]  to service the debt? Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central
[21:37.580 --> 21:41.700]  bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than
[21:41.700 --> 21:42.700]  a standing army?

[24:21.500 --> 24:36.580]  All right, Gigantic News Blitz coming on the next segment. Let's finish up with a breakdown
[24:36.580 --> 24:41.820]  by a reader of infowars.com. That's the sources he's using and New York Times Associated Press
[24:41.820 --> 24:45.900]  as well as official government documents. He links to all of them. And again, that's
[24:45.900 --> 24:49.580]  up on the Alex Jones channel at YouTube. We're going to finish up with this clip where he's
[24:49.580 --> 24:54.300]  explaining why it's the exact same plan in the Soviet Union, Communist China, and Germany.
[24:54.300 --> 24:58.860]  And of course, he doesn't give this particular source, but just Carol Quigley's Georgetown
[24:58.860 --> 25:04.020]  book, the head of political science there when he was hired by the CFR to write the
[25:04.020 --> 25:09.180]  true history of the New World Order for CIA commanders and State Department people because
[25:09.180 --> 25:13.340]  they have to know what's really going on. And so now that book's public, you can read
[25:13.340 --> 25:18.620]  it and how they do it all. And they plan to kill a lot of you. Okay? Let's go ahead
[25:18.620 --> 25:20.420]  and finish the clip.
[25:20.420 --> 25:26.900]  By the very same central bankers that created capitalism, and they admit that they created
[25:26.900 --> 25:32.780]  them as a balancing force in the world in order for them to play off against each other.
[25:32.780 --> 25:37.380]  In fact, John, John, you know, the break interrupted it. Back it up 30, 45 seconds. I want them
[25:37.380 --> 25:42.020]  to hear him explain that. You see, it's all the same attack profile. It doesn't matter
[25:42.020 --> 25:49.540]  if it's Russia, Germany, England, the United States. It's the same globalist. Here it is.
[25:49.540 --> 25:55.260]  Microsoft and his liver transplant that he bought some Christian or some Falun Gong's
[25:55.260 --> 25:59.620]  liver from China. I'll bet money on that. You know what I mean? Because that's what
[25:59.620 --> 26:06.180]  they do. They sell the organs to the highest bidder. So let's move on to Stalin. Okay?
[26:06.180 --> 26:13.780]  Now, this is the identical laws to what Stalin did. Okay? You know why they're identical,
[26:13.780 --> 26:19.300]  folks? They're identical because they were given these laws by the same people who are
[26:19.300 --> 26:25.380]  running these other public governments. Communism did not spring up on its own. Communism was
[26:25.380 --> 26:33.420]  created by the very same central bankers that created capitalism. And they admit that they
[26:33.420 --> 26:39.860]  created them as a balancing force in the world in order for them to play off against each
[26:39.860 --> 26:45.660]  other so that they could incrementally bring in this new world order. Now, why is it that
[26:45.660 --> 26:53.060]  you think that every single country, starting with Hitler, moving to Stalin and Lenin, right?
[26:53.060 --> 27:00.460]  Actually, I should say Lenin and Stalin, right? Then the chairman Mao, then the Pol Pot. Why
[27:00.460 --> 27:06.140]  is it always identical? Why is it that they build secret prisons? Why is it that they
[27:06.140 --> 27:11.940]  pass these identical laws, even the wording is the same in these laws, that criminalize
[27:11.940 --> 27:18.220]  political dissent and opposition? And then why is it that they then, after criminalizing
[27:18.220 --> 27:26.180]  them and confiscating their guns, they either, in the case of Lenin and Stalin and the Ukraine
[27:26.180 --> 27:32.500]  where they just starved 80 million people, 50 million, I'm sorry, it's 50 million in
[27:32.500 --> 27:36.500]  the Ukraine. They just starved to death after they disarmed them. Why? Because they didn't
[27:36.500 --> 27:41.180]  want to submit. They didn't want to turn in their firearms. They did not want to submit
[27:41.180 --> 27:49.220]  because religion became illegal under Lenin and Stalin. And orthodoxy was major and still
[27:49.220 --> 27:54.500]  is major in the Ukraine, Russian orthodoxy, although it's not called that there in the
[27:54.500 --> 28:02.740]  Russian Ukraine. Okay? So then they just starved them to death, folks. Well, that's the plan
[28:02.740 --> 28:09.460]  here, right? They've always starved you in the submission. And so that brings me back
[28:09.460 --> 28:15.060]  to this, right? As the pieces are in place. So let's look at what they got going on. Currently,
[28:15.060 --> 28:21.460]  currently, art and sentry began officially, I guess it begins officially tomorrow, I'm
[28:21.460 --> 28:29.540]  sorry, it begins tomorrow. And it runs for the next month, right? But it overlaps a week
[28:29.540 --> 28:37.540]  by the Department of Homeland Security's July 27th kickoff of their nationwide drills
[28:37.540 --> 28:46.780]  of the same nature. And just at that exact moment, Lautenberg enters a bill that's identical
[28:46.780 --> 28:52.820]  to all these other gun control bills by Mao Pol Pot. Oh, no, Pol Pot, they didn't really
[28:52.820 --> 28:58.540]  pass gun control. He was a dictator. He just decreed. Okay, folks. So that's what's going
[28:58.540 --> 29:05.060]  on, right? They're going to take all your guns. Just look at the lexicon. It's everyone.
[29:05.060 --> 29:11.460]  It's left. The further left you are, the more of you are on the list. Okay? The further
[29:11.460 --> 29:17.940]  right you are, you're on the list. You are all gone. Okay? And denying it is going to
[29:17.940 --> 29:24.700]  do nothing. Okay? Or getting caught up in little distractions, okay? Distractions are
[29:24.700 --> 29:29.140]  there to distract you from what's really going on. It's just a repeat. They've done it over
[29:29.140 --> 29:38.780]  and over, folks. Wake up before they round you up. I'm NSM Doc. See you on the next round.
[29:38.780 --> 29:46.020]  That's right. I think the name of the site is Sacromania MC. Sacromaniax MC. Very well
[29:46.020 --> 29:50.860]  said. I'll give you the rest of the story when we get back. Stay tuned. Stay with us.

[31:08.140 --> 31:13.940]  by a powerful new government. It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective
[31:13.940 --> 31:20.180]  be world domination? For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew. Now as they hail the
[31:20.180 --> 31:25.780]  birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity
[31:25.780 --> 31:33.780]  is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown
[31:33.780 --> 31:38.860]  wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda. Builder
[31:38.860 --> 31:42.500]  Bird is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea. They're
[31:42.500 --> 31:45.660]  not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their
[31:45.660 --> 31:59.940]  strategy. Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now
[31:59.940 --> 32:00.940]  at prisonplanet.tv. In-game blueprint for global enslavement. You have been warned. There's
[32:00.940 --> 32:04.540]  a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[32:04.540 --> 32:08.460]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago. He was devastated, but it taught him
[32:08.460 --> 32:12.940]  a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss
[32:12.940 --> 32:17.380]  tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security. You are always
[32:17.380 --> 32:21.980]  in danger of losing your job, unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your
[32:21.980 --> 32:27.460]  own business. Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you. So MZ has been his own boss
[32:27.460 --> 32:33.220]  for over 37 years and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits
[32:33.220 --> 32:38.100]  of working for themselves and not for others. MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home
[32:38.100 --> 32:42.360]  business opportunity involving the marketing of helpful dark chocolate that can help people
[32:42.360 --> 32:49.020]  lose weight and set you up with an impressive compounding monthly income. Visit chocolate.ownmyself.com
[32:49.020 --> 32:54.820]  and check out the opportunity. That's chocolate.ownmyself.com. It takes very little money and if you're
[32:54.820 --> 33:12.940]  interested MZ wants to talk to you, remember chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[33:12.940 --> 33:33.040]  Money through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time, we are here waging
[33:33.040 --> 33:45.800]  war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation. Look, again I'm going to go over this right
[33:45.800 --> 33:49.920]  now, but there are stacks of news coming out every day where the government all over the
[33:49.920 --> 33:54.360]  newspapers is openly getting the public ready to start restricting free speech. They're
[33:54.360 --> 33:59.760]  setting up a federal agency that is openly saying they're going to decide what you can
[33:59.760 --> 34:03.520]  and can't say on the web and whether it's true or not and their feds are now saying
[34:03.520 --> 34:08.480]  the First Amendment does not give you the right to lie. Remember what Barack Obama's
[34:08.480 --> 34:14.160]  campaign said in Vermont and in Missouri and in Illinois. On the news, they had police
[34:14.160 --> 34:20.240]  chiefs saying you will be arrested if you lie about Obama and we're deciding what there
[34:20.240 --> 34:27.040]  is a lie. Nothing civil, nobody's suing you, no proof. They got up on the news and they
[34:27.040 --> 34:31.920]  said we are coming after you. In fact, John, pull that up. People never believe it when
[34:31.920 --> 34:36.320]  I say that unless we have the news clip. And I have stacks of news today where it's being
[34:36.320 --> 34:41.560]  announced in the AP, the New York Times. I've got TV stations all around the country. We're
[34:41.560 --> 34:47.200]  going to play some of them coming out and saying, look, it is terrorism. It is evil
[34:47.200 --> 34:53.120]  to be in the Constitution Party. The ACLU is openly writing letters and suing the government
[34:53.120 --> 34:57.880]  over a host of issues. One of them, I mean, for those who don't believe me, you can go
[34:57.880 --> 35:04.480]  to the ACLU's website, just saying protest is terrorism. The army is being taught period
[35:04.480 --> 35:10.160]  that it's terrorism. And the people don't understand. They were never taught the Bill
[35:10.160 --> 35:17.600]  of Rights and Constitution. They don't know that that is what war reels in World War II.
[35:17.600 --> 35:20.880]  I just had this idea for the new Obama film. Write it down for I forget, guys. My whole
[35:20.880 --> 35:27.560]  life is a brainstorm. I'll show our news reels explaining how Hitler controlled people's
[35:27.560 --> 35:31.680]  free speech and controlled the press and said he was fighting terrorists and then we'll
[35:31.680 --> 35:36.160]  cut to the modern news. That's a great way to illustrate things because the slaves out
[35:36.160 --> 35:41.520]  there have never, never understood that. It's just incredible. I just keep saying it's
[35:41.520 --> 35:47.160]  incredible. I live this. I fight this. I know this is real and I can't believe how open
[35:47.160 --> 35:55.200]  they are, how open they are and the sickening ways that they sell this. I mean, here's the
[35:55.200 --> 36:01.680]  terrorist watch list story. New York Times. Now we've read the bill on air. It's in the
[36:01.680 --> 36:05.400]  Obama deception. Now it's mainstream news because they're openly trying to pass it.
[36:05.400 --> 36:11.320]  It's racing through the House and Senate right now. It's like a bill for the feds to federalize
[36:11.320 --> 36:16.040]  all water in the United States and they openly say they can take your property. Just open
[36:16.040 --> 36:22.080]  total takeovers, total federalization of everything because the buffer zones around all water is
[36:22.080 --> 36:25.480]  the entire country. It's meant to take over states like Texas and others that don't have
[36:25.480 --> 36:31.600]  a lot of federal lands. If you hadn't had the feds treat you like absolute scum slaves
[36:31.600 --> 36:34.880]  on your own property, which isn't even really yours anymore, you just pay a tax to upkeep
[36:34.880 --> 36:39.920]  it for them. You live in places like Alabama or Florida or Texas where you hadn't put
[36:39.920 --> 36:45.960]  up with this. Get ready. They're coming. Look at this. New York Times. This is how they sell
[36:45.960 --> 36:56.400]  evil by Eric. Lick the bomb. People on the government terrorist watch list tried to buy
[36:56.400 --> 37:03.600]  guns nearly 1000 times in the last five years and federal authorities cleared the purchase
[37:03.600 --> 37:07.600]  of nine out of 10 because they had no legal way to stop them. According to the new government
[37:07.600 --> 37:13.000]  report, what did we always say? They're going to get their instant check, their instant registration.
[37:13.000 --> 37:18.720]  Your name, where you live, what you're buying. Long gun, shotgun, handgun. They're going
[37:18.720 --> 37:28.880]  to do that. They're going to set that up. And then they're just going to start not
[37:28.880 --> 37:33.600]  letting you on firearms. Now, earlier, the fellow's clip that we played from YouTube
[37:33.600 --> 37:36.760]  where he's breaking down the facts said that he believes half the public are on it just
[37:36.760 --> 37:43.000]  off the lexicon and what it says. The Homeland Security lexicon. If it says if you're idealistic,
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.800]  you're a terrorist. Well, I don't know what percentage of the public are military vets.
[37:47.800 --> 37:52.360]  I need to look that up. In fact, do a search on that percentage of U.S. population that
[37:52.360 --> 38:03.520]  are veterans. I would guess it's probably 30%, but check it for me. The issue here is that
[38:03.520 --> 38:08.280]  Homeland Security is built for you. Men of fighting age, people that know how to use
[38:08.280 --> 38:14.720]  a firearm, people that aren't afraid to get their hands dirty. They're scared of you.
[38:14.720 --> 38:17.480]  And by extension, police, that's why there's some of the most surveilled people. That's
[38:17.480 --> 38:21.640]  why they brainwash the cops, make them feel special, not knowing the whole time they're
[38:21.640 --> 38:24.600]  the main target. Just like when Hitler and Stalin and Mao took over, first thing they
[38:24.600 --> 38:28.960]  did was wipe out the police, all the fools that had helped them get into power. Check
[38:28.960 --> 38:33.600]  your history if you don't know that. It's an absolutely historical fact. And they never
[38:33.600 --> 38:45.560]  believe it until it happens to them. But the issue here is that I have known since Bill
[38:45.560 --> 38:49.600]  Clinton, his last year in office, suddenly veterans all over the country couldn't buy
[38:49.600 --> 38:54.400]  guns, couldn't buy their grandson a 22. They couldn't buy no criminal record. And then
[38:54.400 --> 38:59.800]  we said, oh, they don't want veterans to be armed. And then it came out on one list,
[38:59.800 --> 39:02.640]  80-something thousand, then a couple hundred thousand more. It was in the news. You can
[39:02.640 --> 39:12.680]  pull it up. This was in 2000. That when Bill Clinton was a lame duck and didn't care he
[39:12.680 --> 39:18.520]  was going out of office, anybody who'd ever collapsed on the battlefield in Korea or Vietnam
[39:18.520 --> 39:22.880]  had wondered why after two, three days of no sleep, they'd collapsed from stress or heat
[39:22.880 --> 39:26.640]  stroke or even if they'd been shot in the leg and bled, you know, bled real bad and
[39:26.640 --> 39:31.080]  passed out. They'd say, hey, you're going home, Scott free. You're done on the army.
[39:31.080 --> 39:36.200]  And they'd say, what's this on my discharge form saying psychosis or post-traumatic stress
[39:36.200 --> 39:41.520]  disorder? You know, I collapsed from not enough water. I was, we were out there three days
[39:41.520 --> 39:46.080]  getting hit with mortars. And they say, because I've interviewed people on air and they go,
[39:46.080 --> 39:51.360]  sorry, no more second amendment for you. The VA's put out this list and there was no judge,
[39:51.360 --> 39:56.960]  no jury, no law. They would just deny it. So people sued and fought it, but they still
[39:56.960 --> 40:02.320]  do it. And then I know famous UT football players, no criminal record that I'll see
[40:02.320 --> 40:08.240]  in an event or something. They come over and tell me, yeah, you believe that, uh, you know,
[40:08.240 --> 40:14.200]  I'm the guy from coach Royals first championship team and I can't own a gun now. No criminal
[40:14.200 --> 40:18.920]  record. They just say I can't have it because something in the military. I had a dis I had
[40:18.920 --> 40:24.880]  an honorable discharge. I didn't have a dishonorable. I don't know. They won't even tell me I can't,
[40:24.880 --> 40:30.160]  I can't get off the list and just the thousands of emails and people that come up to me and
[40:30.160 --> 40:34.080]  tell me about it. And you all, I'm sure have experienced it. A lot of you out there. That's
[40:34.080 --> 40:40.320]  what you get by these greedy offshore filthy bankers because you're not good old boys.
[40:40.320 --> 40:49.560]  You're not part of the system. You understand that you've been thinking you were part of
[40:49.560 --> 40:54.040]  it and we're the good guys. We're fighting the brown people. No, that didn't know how
[40:54.040 --> 40:58.400]  it works. Jack, they don't like the brown people and they don't like you either. You
[40:58.400 --> 41:04.920]  understand that? And I know it's a big hot dog roasting event and I've talked to liquor
[41:04.920 --> 41:09.280]  store owners and pizza chain owners and they say when, when the United States is attacking
[41:09.280 --> 41:16.920]  Afghanistan or Iraq or Serbia, it's like New Year's Christmas. People's, you know, other
[41:16.920 --> 41:25.520]  major holidays, like Thanksgiving all rolled into one, just whiskey, pizza, barbecue,
[41:25.520 --> 41:30.040]  total alcoholic drunkenness, men sitting back in their chairs, loving buildings getting
[41:30.040 --> 41:36.680]  blown up and seeing dead bodies, some sick mutation of male instinct aggression put on
[41:36.680 --> 41:46.440]  disgusting display. Hey, pal, they'd love to do that to you too. They're the real predators.
[41:46.440 --> 42:00.000]  You've just been playing at being a predator. You've just been playing. This isn't a game
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.640]  and I suggest you realize how much danger we're all in. If you love your family, if
[42:04.640 --> 42:08.760]  you're a real man, you ought to be able to uncloud your mind and face the propaganda
[42:08.760 --> 42:13.320]  and the brainwashing you've been living under and you should go in there and break your
[42:13.320 --> 42:15.560]  conditioning. You know, you're going to know when you break your conditioning because it's
[42:15.560 --> 42:18.800]  heavy. You're going to get nauseous. You're going to be sweating. You're going to throw
[42:18.800 --> 42:23.640]  up. You know what that is? That's your guts getting connected to your brain. That's your
[42:23.640 --> 42:31.120]  soul shining through that layer of matrix propaganda. And it's happened to all of us.
[42:31.120 --> 42:35.820]  And you realize the whole world, you know, is a lie and your whole family's in danger.
[42:35.820 --> 42:40.280]  It's called a gut check. It's your body throwing up when it realizes it's under attack and
[42:40.280 --> 42:43.960]  it's under threat and you're being poisoned with fluoride and vaccines and the globalists
[42:43.960 --> 42:49.480]  know it. That's your body getting ready for a fight. That's your body saying, I need to
[42:49.480 --> 42:57.120]  get this out of my stomach because I'm going to go all out 110 percent. Throwing up isn't
[42:57.120 --> 43:01.920]  because you're nervous, ladies and gentlemen. It's your body getting ready to defend its
[43:01.920 --> 43:06.360]  very life. And if you don't have that feeling, I haven't had it in many, many years. I can
[43:06.360 --> 43:10.120]  be in front of, you know, TV with 5 million people watching me, 16 million listeners on
[43:10.120 --> 43:14.480]  radio shows. I can be in front of a crowd of 3,000 people on national TV does nothing
[43:14.480 --> 43:19.400]  to me because I went way past that point decades ago, but I'm telling you something. If you
[43:19.400 --> 43:24.400]  haven't had the fear of God come over you and if you haven't puked your guts up over
[43:24.400 --> 43:28.640]  what's happening, then you haven't been there and you're headed and screwed on straight
[43:28.640 --> 43:40.080]  because that's the brain getting right with the body. That's solid Tarsus on the road
[43:40.080 --> 43:45.700]  of Damascus knocked off that horse, stumbling around, throwing up in the ditch. That's your
[43:45.700 --> 43:50.440]  soul coming back into your body. That's your soul that's just connected by the tiniest
[43:50.440 --> 43:59.080]  little flimsy golden cord that you're about to lose. Your body is so happy when that
[43:59.080 --> 44:04.560]  humanity comes back into it that it symbolizes the evil and the corruption and who you've
[44:04.560 --> 44:09.440]  been serving leaving you when your soul comes back in. And I hate to get spiritual and that's
[44:09.440 --> 44:21.840]  more of an analogy, but that's really what it's like. You need to convert to liberty
[44:21.840 --> 44:27.800]  and freedom. You need to leave evil. All it's going to give you is hurt and weakness. All
[44:27.800 --> 44:42.000]  it's going to give you is the trappings of power, but rotten feet. Yeah, it's got a
[44:42.000 --> 44:50.600]  golden head. It's got a silver shoulders and chest. It's got a bronze stomach that legs
[44:50.600 --> 44:55.800]  and feet of rotten clay. It's standing on sand. That's not where you want to be going
[44:55.800 --> 45:07.360]  into this, this tempest storm. This great evil rises across the planet. All right, let me
[45:07.360 --> 45:16.600]  just blitz through this. Look at this on terrorist watch list, but allowed to buy guns. Oh, look
[45:16.600 --> 45:23.040]  at how they push it. Look at how they phrase it. Look at how they, it's so sick. And this
[45:23.040 --> 45:31.560]  Eric liked Blom knows exactly what he's doing. People on the government terrorist watch list
[45:31.560 --> 45:38.600]  tried to buy guns only 1000 times in the last five years and federal authorities cleared
[45:38.600 --> 45:45.480]  the purchase nine times out of 10 because they had no legal way to stop them. According
[45:45.480 --> 45:49.040]  to a new government report, in one case, a person on the list was able to buy more than
[45:49.040 --> 45:55.640]  50 pounds of explosives. What a deception. They have nothing but contempt for their moron
[45:55.640 --> 46:00.760]  readers. Lots of yuppies and know it all sitting up their little sequestered ivory towers.
[46:00.760 --> 46:06.040]  Oh, dear God, they know nothing about buying explosives or firearms. These gilded domesticated
[46:06.040 --> 46:14.680]  chicken neck week pieces of filth. You can't buy explosives, ladies and gentlemen, unless
[46:14.680 --> 46:19.060]  you have a special license and they don't sell it to you now, unless you're with a major
[46:19.060 --> 46:26.520]  construction company or mining operation. This is a load of baloney. So they mix in.
[46:26.520 --> 46:31.960]  Oh, and they can't stop people buying explosives. That is a lie. And you know it. New York Times.
[46:31.960 --> 46:36.080]  Just like you lied about yellow cake, uranium, diorak out of Niger, Africa. Like you lied
[46:36.080 --> 46:46.800]  about aluminum tubes. Just like you lie about everything because you're of your father.
[46:46.800 --> 46:52.640]  And your names are all written in the book of death. And you love it. You love death.
[46:52.640 --> 47:00.560]  I don't like you. I love life. And I will defend it. I will not sit here on my back
[47:00.560 --> 47:08.040]  on my knees sucking your boots. You control free degenerates. The new statistics compiled
[47:08.040 --> 47:12.200]  in a report for the government accountability office that is scheduled for public release
[47:12.200 --> 47:18.640]  next week. Draw attention to an odd divergence in federal law. People placed on the government's
[47:18.640 --> 47:24.520]  terrorist watch list can be stopped from getting on a plane or getting a visa, which is wrong.
[47:24.520 --> 47:30.480]  It's a made up no reason can't find out why you're on it into habeas corpus into due process.
[47:30.480 --> 47:34.880]  And see how they sell it. It's an odd divergence of the government's terror watch list can
[47:34.880 --> 47:38.920]  be stopped from getting on a plane or getting a visa, but they cannot be stopped from buying
[47:38.920 --> 47:46.080]  a gun. Oh, let us all live like in New York hiding behind ten locks shaking at night as
[47:46.080 --> 47:50.640]  the criminals and the criminal police have their ways with you. Gun purchases must be
[47:50.640 --> 47:55.040]  approved unless federal officials can find some other disqualification of the would be
[47:55.040 --> 47:59.840]  buyer like being a felon illegal immigrant and drug addict. And what this really says
[47:59.840 --> 48:03.520]  is like the fellow said, if you're not a drug addict, you're not illegal immigrant, you're
[48:03.520 --> 48:07.200]  not a felon. That's who they want to go after. Hell, I read the New York Times last week
[48:07.200 --> 48:11.760]  where they're hiring felons for Obama's city year and leap year and all these other
[48:11.760 --> 48:19.800]  weirdo groups in uniforms marching around with gutter snipes. They mean business folks.
[48:19.800 --> 48:23.280]  And then how they're trending the Boy Scouts to take on the veterans front page in the
[48:23.280 --> 48:27.400]  New York Times. You people really are. You want to do a red purge here in America? You
[48:27.400 --> 48:30.960]  hippies are really going to try this for your banker bosses. You don't know you're going
[48:30.960 --> 48:37.080]  to get your butts kicked. This isn't this old Russia. Bunch of hearty hard work in Russia's
[48:37.080 --> 48:40.760]  but they lived under slavery for thousands of years and they put up with it. This isn't
[48:40.760 --> 48:47.960]  China living for thousands of years under the chin. This is the United States and we
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.920]  may be decadent mind controlled and on Prozac, but there's still the good old boy guts in
[48:52.920 --> 48:56.920]  there that kicked the butt of the Redcoats never before defeated, that kicked the butt
[48:56.920 --> 49:01.800]  of the corrupt Mexican government and my ancestors didn't put up with people's bull
[49:01.800 --> 49:06.640]  and I know a lot of you out there aren't slaves either and you got it in your guts to not
[49:06.640 --> 49:12.840]  be slaves. So fire up your guts and stop being cowards and recognize a bunch of slack,
[49:12.840 --> 49:23.400]  god black uniform wearing thugs when I have their way with us. These bastards aren't going
[49:23.400 --> 49:30.080]  to win. They're setting up to go after everybody big time. I'm just getting the drums beaten
[49:30.080 --> 49:36.760]  here to recognize that the enemies of this republic are. Now it's on mainstream news
[49:36.760 --> 49:41.560]  that yes the fellow reserve will rule everything from coffee shops to hot dog stands to every
[49:41.560 --> 49:47.280]  factory every business not even with the green core and there's a carbon tax total complete
[49:47.280 --> 49:54.200]  rulership absolute no no more even pretense of judges or juries just absolute reigning
[49:54.200 --> 50:00.720]  tyranny. I mean this is all happening. Why do you think police suddenly all over the
[50:00.720 --> 50:06.160]  country are robbing people and TSA all over the nation robbing people's bags admittedly
[50:06.160 --> 50:10.640]  because tyranny's been given an absolute green light. They're going for broke. They're engaging
[50:10.640 --> 50:15.920]  us. We're under attack. We're being engaged. We're already under attack. Don't you understand
[50:15.920 --> 50:22.720]  that? Like Patrick Henry said the war is already here. That's why they're but 90% of war now
[50:22.720 --> 50:27.880]  is info war. So you got to hit them and hit them hard while we still got time down the
[50:27.880 --> 50:31.200]  road you're going to wish you to done more early on it's going to get harder and harder
[50:31.200 --> 50:36.200]  to get these transmissions out. They're definitely going for broke and going for broke soon.
[50:36.200 --> 50:41.000]  I wouldn't be surprised if they don't state some big terror attacks in the next 60 to
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.400]  90 days. I'll tell you a while later with Obama's approval rate and plunging. Red level
[50:44.400 --> 50:49.120]  mayday mayday red level under attack from all sides. They got child kidnapping forces
[50:49.120 --> 50:53.200]  going wild. They got bills introduced in almost every state for no fourth of them at the seizure
[50:53.200 --> 50:58.600]  children it will mayday mayday mayday red alert republic under attack. All patriots
[50:58.600 --> 51:04.280]  come to defense immediately. Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of
[51:04.280 --> 51:08.480]  the economic and political problems facing the US and the world. And for the first time
[51:08.480 --> 51:12.800]  in their lives they are feeling the need for preparedness. Ready reserve foods has been

[53:00.480 --> 53:05.560]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill? If you're taking vitamins and minerals in

[54:15.920 --> 54:23.360]  There is no doubt this is the most deadly strain of government management. This is the most
[54:23.360 --> 54:30.120]  deadly strain of tyranny I have ever seen doing in-depth historical studies of human
[54:30.120 --> 54:35.280]  societies for more than 8,000 years. I have studied how humans organize themselves, how
[54:35.280 --> 54:40.680]  they operate. I understand what the greater tyrannies have been in history. I have studied
[54:40.680 --> 54:48.040]  them from different perspectives and I'm telling you this is the most savage, vicious, reprobate,
[54:48.040 --> 54:54.520]  heartless, soulless, ruthless group of murdering scum you can imagine. They will stage massive
[54:54.520 --> 54:59.400]  terror attacks including vaporizing entire cities if it's what it takes for them to
[54:59.400 --> 55:08.000]  get total power. We have got to expose the new world order now and who they are because
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.520]  if they know enough people know who they are, they will move into a less aggressive stance
[55:12.520 --> 55:18.560]  and go dormant. But if they think they're going to be able to do this, folks, it's going
[55:18.560 --> 55:24.840]  to be the Ukrainian level, the Russian level, the Maoist level massacre. I know the attack
[55:24.840 --> 55:35.120]  pattern. There is no doubt. It is 100% certain they are going for a blood feast. I'm telling
[55:35.120 --> 55:41.040]  you right now, there is no doubt and it's been taking a lot for me to even face just
[55:41.040 --> 55:45.480]  how real this is. Believe me, I'd rather rationalize that this isn't coming down on us like a ton
[55:45.480 --> 55:49.720]  of bricks, that they're going to stall, that it's just going to collapse. The collapse
[55:49.720 --> 55:55.200]  is their plan. They got it so domesticated, so dependent, right where they want us, mind
[55:55.200 --> 56:00.600]  controlled. They've been drugging the water supply on record. Think about that alone,
[56:00.600 --> 56:10.840]  on record, knowingly. Oh, God. It's all I can do to not evacuate with my children because
[56:10.840 --> 56:14.240]  I love them so much, but I love everybody else's children too and I'm not going to run off
[56:14.240 --> 56:19.840]  somewhere and be hunted down later. I'm going to stand up. You can call it failing forward,
[56:19.840 --> 56:25.520]  running forward, you know, flight forward and that's what it is, but I am not turning
[56:25.520 --> 56:31.480]  tail. I'm going 110% into these people and I know I'm not up to the job. Lord knows I'm
[56:31.480 --> 56:35.920]  not perfect and Lord knows you're not either, but you got to just have guts and stand up
[56:35.920 --> 56:40.600]  and do what you can and just start swinging at these bastards, exposing them. I don't
[56:40.600 --> 56:46.240]  care how you do it. You just get the word out right now. These poor domesticated public
[56:46.240 --> 56:51.440]  have no idea the jaws, the iron bear trap they're in. They have no idea what's tangled
[56:51.440 --> 56:57.720]  up around them. They have no idea what they've been caught up in. Caught almighty. It's hard
[56:57.720 --> 57:02.120]  for me to even face it psychologically because it's so scientific. It's so creeping. It's
[57:02.120 --> 57:08.080]  so wicked. It's so in our face. My God, we're training the whole army that any protest is
[57:08.080 --> 57:12.640]  illegal and getting them ready for total martial law publicly. They got bills all introduced
[57:12.640 --> 57:17.560]  to ban free speech openly and they're pushing it in the news, trying to pass it. Cyber bullying
[57:17.560 --> 57:22.640]  act that a bunch of others and new federal agencies to do it. I mean, they are coming
[57:22.640 --> 57:27.560]  at us hard, ladies and gentlemen, and they're selling secret lists where you can't have
[57:27.560 --> 57:31.600]  jobs. They're saying if you have bad credit, you're not going to be able to own a gun because
[57:31.600 --> 57:35.480]  you're going to be on the no fly list and that's going to become a list for jobs, everything.
[57:35.480 --> 57:41.080]  As Homeland Security said, Americans on secret list, the whole bill of rights, the whole
[57:41.080 --> 57:48.120]  constitution thrown out. The new regulatory reform bill. I had Dr. Paul Craig Roberts
[57:48.120 --> 57:53.040]  head of the Treasury, former head of the Treasury on yesterday had a policy former Wall Street
[57:53.040 --> 57:57.440]  Journal editor saying yes, a predatory government's looting and stealing everything. And yes,
[57:57.440 --> 58:00.960]  this is the fellow reserve setting up an open dictatorship above the government private
[58:00.960 --> 58:06.160]  bank. Ron Paul's on record saying it. Judge Napolitano is on record saying it, but Fox
[58:06.160 --> 58:11.320]  News won't put him. They won't put him on Fox News. All these people on the internet
[58:11.320 --> 58:16.360]  go look, Fox News is putting on TV. That's the internet only. The time he had me on it
[58:16.360 --> 58:26.160]  was only internet. They're not going to put that on TV. God help us. This doesn't have
[58:26.160 --> 58:31.520]  to happen. It's so over the top. We got to have the equivalent of a Nazi slash Soviet
[58:31.520 --> 58:36.080]  takeover because the yuppies won't stand up. They're too busy riding around their little
[58:36.080 --> 58:51.200]  shorts on their bikes. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCN Live.com today. Hello friends,
[58:51.200 --> 58:55.160]  this is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important to be self sufficient
[58:55.160 --> 58:59.160]  and today that's more important than ever. We need to be independent and food and water
[58:59.160 --> 59:02.800]  is the key. You'll never have to stand in a bread line where you have your own bread.
[59:02.800 --> 59:06.720]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[59:06.720 --> 59:10.760]  in any emergency if you simply prepare. No one is going to take care of your family in
[59:10.760 --> 59:15.400]  the final equation, but you know, EFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's
[59:15.400 --> 59:20.120]  safe from E. coli, salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at almost
[59:20.120 --> 59:27.960]  half the cost of last year's grocery prices. Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to EFoodsDirect.com.
[59:27.960 --> 59:32.680]  Visit EFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, freeze dried and dehydrated
[59:32.680 --> 59:36.960]  foods they have to offer. Watch the three videos, look at their online catalog or give
[59:36.960 --> 59:45.920]  them a call at 1-800-409-5633. Again 800-409-5633 or on the web at EFoodsDirect.com. Take action
[59:45.920 --> 59:56.560]  today. The first step is getting storable food. Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones
[59:56.560 --> 1:00:11.680]  on the GCN Radio Network. Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:20.520]  Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas,
[1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:31.240]  Alex Jones. I'm going to open the phones up in this hour. Now I'm going to continue going
[1:00:31.240 --> 1:00:35.760]  over the news as best I can. In fact in the next second I'm going to do a huge round up
[1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:41.920]  and try to not divert off and only one story when I start reading it. Now I'm going to
[1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:46.320]  open the phones up. What do you think about the big picture? Open bills introduced to
[1:00:46.320 --> 1:00:50.560]  ban free speech, cyberbullying act and others. Open bills to allow the attorney general to
[1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:56.280]  ban any guns he wants or all guns at one time. Bander manufacture. Other bills where
[1:00:56.280 --> 1:01:00.560]  he can put you on secret lists where you can't own guns, can't have jobs. Openly announced
[1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:07.560]  the heart of tyranny. The Army saying all protest is an act of terrorism. ACLU publicly
[1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:11.080]  talking about it. It's not just me putting the manual up. They're even talking about
[1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:16.800]  it for all you idiots in denial out there. This isn't a game. Just I can't believe it.
[1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:22.200]  I'm going to get into Iran. That's the big news in North Korea. But I have trouble while
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:25.640]  they're about to start World War III with North. That's why they're gearing up and cracking
[1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:30.440]  down and Homeland Security's being set up to make sure we go along with World War III.
[1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:34.920]  Just to make sure we're good little slaves and babies set us while we give our sons and
[1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:41.120]  daughters to the giant global New World War machine. We're going to have the nice liberal
[1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:45.520]  leading us into war. I think they're going to stage terror attacks. I think they're going
[1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:49.400]  to go ahead and do something with Iran and North Korea unless we hit our knees and ask
[1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:55.480]  God to give us a reprieve and start living different and start showing God that we're
[1:01:55.480 --> 1:01:58.240]  not going to be part of this evil. I mean, people are like, well, what do we do? What
[1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:01.320]  do we do? I don't know. You better go to your church and stand up and speak. You better
[1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:05.720]  make copies of films and put them up. Micro FM's carrying this show and others. You better
[1:02:05.720 --> 1:02:09.960]  tell everybody about the MNFM stations we're on. Other people you think are putting on
[1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:18.640]  good work. Tell people about that. Call Congress. Do banner hangs on highways. Just, I mean,
[1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:23.440]  go crazy. We need all of you out there that have been bunkering down for 10 years and
[1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:30.440]  hiding out who can see this coming. We need you to stop hiding and get in the fight, man.
[1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:35.000]  This is the battle. You know, they didn't hide at the Alamo folks that were right up
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:39.680]  there on the parapets and they, they pay with their lives, but out of their sacrifice, people
[1:02:39.680 --> 1:02:46.800]  saw the honorable human spirit standing up for liberty and it kindled a great fire in
[1:02:46.800 --> 1:02:51.360]  the other Texans. And it's the same thing at Bunker Hill, same thing at Lexington and
[1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:56.000]  Concord. And let me tell you something, folks, make no mistake. I am at the Alamo right here
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:00.400]  right now. Make no mistake. I am under attack from every side. Make no mistake. The enemy
[1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:04.840]  is encamped around me and I've gotten letters out to you telling you never give up victory
[1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:11.360]  or death. We are going to win this thing. Okay. We win by fighting. We win by striving.
[1:03:11.360 --> 1:03:17.600]  We win by committing. We win by not being cowards. This life is a test, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:03:17.600 --> 1:03:22.640]  And all I'm afraid of is the new world order putting you on Prozac. I was reading. Was
[1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:27.400]  it 26% increase in Prozac type drug uses in the last year alone? I mean, they're totally
[1:03:27.400 --> 1:03:35.680]  drugging everybody. I mean, it's just, it's 1984, brave new world craziness. You know,
[1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:40.360]  you beat the new world order, husbands and wives. Stop fighting with each other. Stop
[1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:46.400]  cheating on each other. Stop going out and acting tough at the bar instead of taking
[1:03:46.400 --> 1:03:53.280]  care of your kids. Get your souls back. And I'm not on some high horse. None of us are
[1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:59.640]  here. Get right with who you are. Get right with being a human being on this planet and
[1:03:59.640 --> 1:04:05.280]  fighting for our little sad species that's got so much potential, but almost so so much
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:10.240]  bad in us and all the things we've done wrong. We got to be ashamed of ourselves. We're here
[1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:14.440]  on an incredible planet with incredible technology with an incredible future ahead of us for
[1:04:14.440 --> 1:04:18.560]  the bar species. Don't you understand those that came before us are living on through
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:24.800]  us? We're going to live on through those that come. And when you finally dial into that
[1:04:24.800 --> 1:04:32.960]  fact that you are in the middle of majesty and wonderment and should be joyful, joyful
[1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:41.840]  at creation and thankful and go completely past fear into an entirely different dimension
[1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:52.200]  you commit. Then your soul is beyond their reach forever. It is in the cosmos. We'll
[1:04:52.200 --> 1:04:56.560]  be right back and I'll try to focus on the news. The horror will be good back. Total
[1:04:56.560 --> 1:05:02.080]  transmission straight ahead. The resistance continues. What can you do to keep you and

[1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:06.240]  tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years. Inner

[1:06:46.480 --> 1:07:06.280]  This is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give
[1:07:06.280 --> 1:07:11.120]  you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can
[1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:16.800]  get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:21.200]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts. When will
[1:07:21.200 --> 1:07:25.640]  you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will
[1:07:25.640 --> 1:07:29.960]  it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go
[1:07:29.960 --> 1:07:34.520]  to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have
[1:07:34.520 --> 1:07:39.800]  a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How
[1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:44.920]  much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[1:07:44.920 --> 1:07:52.600]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check
[1:07:52.600 --> 1:08:10.480]  it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:28.080]  Alright, now look, I'm just going to go ahead and go to your phone calls now because I don't
[1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:36.400]  want to just calmly, like it's no big deal, just kind of halfway report on this Iran situation
[1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:41.640]  and North Korea. I've got that in my stack. I'm going live at PrisonPlanet.TV at the bottom
[1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:48.920]  of the shower in 22 minutes and I'm going to start simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.TV with
[1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:53.040]  the radio so I can play this video clip of this young lady being shot and killed. Some
[1:08:53.040 --> 1:08:58.880]  folks are saying it's fake. I've seen a few people die. If it is fake, it is academy award
[1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:05.640]  winning. It's the best dying scene I've ever seen. It's real. And watching that woman's
[1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:10.040]  soul pour out of her really touches your heart. But you've got to remember the larger mind
[1:09:10.040 --> 1:09:15.000]  control involved in all of this. Now it could have been staged who shot her and it does
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:21.720]  look staged the way it was filmed. But that I can't be 100% about. So there's something
[1:09:21.720 --> 1:09:28.400]  going on here but this woman is dying. A communication in her eyes as she realizes she's about to
[1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:33.560]  die and that blood comes pouring out of her mouth. I've seen people die and that's it.
[1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:42.240]  Again, this woman is academy award winning like nothing I've ever seen. I can tell you
[1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:47.000]  right now it's real. So we're going to go over that coming up. It's being shown all over
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  seeing in to freak people out and scare them. I don't particularly like showing a snuff
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:56.920]  film on air but this is war. And I guess they showed those little kids running around on
[1:09:56.920 --> 1:10:03.240]  Walter Cronkite, CBS News of their napalm and their skin hanging off so we'll show this.
[1:10:03.240 --> 1:10:11.360]  It's coming up at Prison Planet.TV. Of course, they're not going to show you the kids with
[1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:18.400]  their arms and legs blown off when they start bombing Iran. No, then they won't even let
[1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:21.600]  the news show the Marines torturing a puppy to death because that might turn you against
[1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:28.520]  the war. But boy, they had LCIA that torturing a puppy. They'd show it. A little yellow lab
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:36.760]  picked out of central casting for the job. God, these people are sick. So we'll go over
[1:10:36.760 --> 1:10:43.920]  that. Let's go ahead and talk to Mark and Oregon. Mark, you're on the air.
[1:10:43.920 --> 1:10:46.200]  Hey, good morning to you, Alex.
[1:10:46.200 --> 1:10:47.200]  Hey, buddy.
[1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:52.080]  Well, Alex, you sound on the verge of tears today. You might even have a few rolling down
[1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:58.000]  your face. I don't have internet here, so I'm reading everything from your voice, which
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:02.600]  is pretty accurate, usually. And remember you said yesterday on your show that you're
[1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:07.240]  about two inches away from moving your wife and children out of the country to a place
[1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:13.280]  of safety? You know, I put these kind of things together. And with the, like I was mentioning
[1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:21.160]  to John Harmon a moment ago, that you have a much wider picture on average detail-wise
[1:11:21.160 --> 1:11:25.680]  of what's really going on on a day-to-day basis and where things are up to this point
[1:11:25.680 --> 1:11:30.840]  in time as far as the progress of the New World Order evildoers and the implementation
[1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:39.240]  of their agenda to bring us all down to our demise here. And Alex, I'd just like to take
[1:11:39.240 --> 1:11:43.960]  about a minute or so to go over something and if you bear with me.
[1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:46.760]  Sure, go ahead.
[1:11:46.760 --> 1:11:53.800]  Despite the great and ever-increasing rate of the dissemination of the true facts which
[1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:58.520]  fully expose the structure and objective of evil in this country as well as the whole
[1:11:58.520 --> 1:12:04.240]  world, we see essentially that the streets are dead silent relative to any form of protest
[1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:09.960]  from the people of the world concerning the nefarious and evil plan to destroy us all
[1:12:09.960 --> 1:12:16.160]  in short order with very cruel and painful methods. So what's holding people back from
[1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:18.560]  being outraged to the degree that the voices of the world-
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:25.160]  They don't have fluoridated water in places like Iran. Notice the first thing they wanted
[1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:28.960]  to do in Iraq, once they've been liberated, was fluoridate their water and they do now.
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:34.120]  They also forced them to buy GMO seeds that's only kind of allowed to be shipped in. So they'll
[1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:41.200]  soon be docile as well. They sap the strength, as General Jack T. Ripper says, it's all about
[1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:45.920]  throwing it in our face in that film, the oppressive essence. I mean, really it attacks
[1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:55.200]  the organs, it attacks all the hormone, endocrine releases, and so it really is the sodium fluoride
[1:12:55.200 --> 1:12:59.200]  and all the other things they're putting in the water supply, but I appreciate your call.
[1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:07.920]  The reason I'm freaked out is I've always known the Neural Order was real. I've always
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:12.040]  known they were eugenicists. It's one thing to know they were setting it all up. It's
[1:13:12.040 --> 1:13:16.560]  another thing to finally be getting deeper and deeper into it every day and realize this
[1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:23.160]  is really happening. I mean, this is real, folks. We really have the same people that
[1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:28.640]  ran the Nazis and the Soviets and the Maoists in control and they openly brag about it and
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:38.200]  they mean business. And we've got a cow kind of broke back, given up, public. Now, living,
[1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:46.600]  I've seen a lot of fights, been in a lot of fights a lot. I found out a lot of areas
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:50.680]  in the country aren't like where I grew up. People don't act like animals and beat the
[1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:55.480]  hell out of each other and beat each other to death on a routine basis. But growing up
[1:13:55.480 --> 1:14:00.520]  where I did in Dallas, that was the culture. And I've seen a lot of stuff and then in college
[1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:03.760]  and things later, you ever seen a big guy beating up on a little guy and it seems like
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:06.840]  he's giving up and he's being beaten and all of a sudden the little guy or it could
[1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:10.640]  be another big guy, if another big guy, all of a sudden just decides to fight back and
[1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:19.960]  goes wild and opens up a can and just explosively is unstoppable. And so don't think just because
[1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:25.600]  a lot of people are laying down and rolling over that it's not building up to a tempest.
[1:14:25.600 --> 1:14:28.880]  The problem is we're thinking two, three, four moves ahead and the New World Order is
[1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:35.580]  thinking 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100. They've got mathematical computer algorithms for human
[1:14:35.580 --> 1:14:43.000]  sociology and psychology. They've been testing and humanity is unpredictable, but as unpredictable
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:51.600]  as they are, they're predictable. There's a predictable quantum equation within the
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:59.480]  chaos. And so that's why people are like, all right, Americans are out buying guns
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:03.960]  and masks getting ready for war. And whereas I say it's a good thing you're out buying
[1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:07.120]  guns to defend yourself, protect yourself. And yeah, that's not good for the New World
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:14.440]  Order. Still, there's a method in the madness of the establishment. And I just because they'll
[1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:18.560]  set off shore while the police and military and citizens all kill each other. You think
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:28.160]  they care? I don't have some know the word is the proper word I'm not going to use because
[1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:34.560]  I'm somewhat vulgar. I'm not excited wanting to get in a fight with the police and military.
[1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:45.720]  I'm not looking for it. I don't have a I'm not aroused is what the terms connotations
[1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:53.920]  are. I'm not out there looking for it. Something I don't want. I want peace. But peace at
[1:15:53.920 --> 1:15:58.320]  any price, peace at being a slave in cornered and shot up with chemical weapons. That's
[1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:04.200]  not peace. I have an inherent right as a sentient being. And I declare my right against the eugenicist
[1:16:04.200 --> 1:16:10.200]  to live and to not be exterminated by them. And I have an inherent right to fight them.
[1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:15.040]  But they want to have a fight. It's not a fight. The first wave is going to win or the second
[1:16:15.040 --> 1:16:20.960]  or the third. But after we're done rioting and killing for two, three years, they will
[1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:25.600]  move in as the saviors. They'll even repudiate the group they've got in power now that's
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:30.880]  going to carry this out. You understand how that works?
[1:16:30.880 --> 1:16:37.120]  They'll that's why the globalists are such masters. This isn't a Hitler or a Mao or
[1:16:37.120 --> 1:16:42.520]  Stalin where the group in power really is in power, just being funded by the bankers.
[1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:47.240]  And then they play off other power structures and factions ago off against the wind up toy
[1:16:47.240 --> 1:16:52.160]  or faction they've created. They're now down to the end game where they control almost
[1:16:52.160 --> 1:16:57.160]  every faction completely and are playing the factions off against humanity itself. And
[1:16:57.160 --> 1:17:02.520]  there's a few rogue pieces left that are wildcards, but they're cornered nations and they really
[1:17:02.520 --> 1:17:07.520]  hate Iran because the Iranians are fighters. They're smart. They're certainly not perfect,
[1:17:07.520 --> 1:17:11.640]  but their elite is idealistic and really thinks they're fighting the new world order and they
[1:17:11.640 --> 1:17:16.160]  are. And so they're loaded for bear ready to go all the way to the wall. The new order
[1:17:16.160 --> 1:17:27.920]  hates it. So they're encircling them and it's just, it's just totally sick.
[1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:33.860]  It's absolutely sick because the new world order are a bunch of intelligent ruthless
[1:17:33.860 --> 1:17:38.400]  potbellied weak pieces of garbage, but they're intellectually very strong. They're very
[1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:42.680]  sick people. They love hurting humanity. They love hurting innocence. They get off on it.
[1:17:42.680 --> 1:17:47.000]  It's what they are. And they think they're going to be able to carry this out and they
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:51.640]  got a good chance of being able to do it folks, but I'm telling you, you don't have any chance
[1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:54.960]  but to wake up and break your conditioning and come out of the cage. They've got you
[1:17:54.960 --> 1:18:01.320]  in mentally and realize this is real. Let's go to Angel in Pennsylvania. Angel, you're
[1:18:01.320 --> 1:18:05.760]  on the air. Hey, what's up, Alex? How are you? Worldwide transmission. What's on your
[1:18:05.760 --> 1:18:11.480]  mind? Well, um, I was browsing YouTube today and I came across the, you know, White House
[1:18:11.480 --> 1:18:16.440]  YouTube page and I noticed that it says here that the first lady Michelle Obama officially
[1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:22.080]  kicked off the United. We serve. It's a call to all Americans to join a volunteer effort
[1:18:22.080 --> 1:18:27.920]  this summer going into September 11th to be a part of building a new foundation for America.
[1:18:27.920 --> 1:18:30.920]  And I just want to say that you really hit the nail on the head. You guys have been talking
[1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:35.680]  about how they were going to start to promote this thing hardcore come September 11th. And
[1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:41.440]  uh, you know, we're really in for for big, big, uh, we didn't hit anything on a head.
[1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:45.320]  I mean, they, they, it's all announced. It's all, I mean, they're going to incrementally
[1:18:45.320 --> 1:18:49.920]  just start arresting people for their speech, swatting people for their legal guns, putting
[1:18:49.920 --> 1:18:54.080]  everybody on list and they're just going to do it. I mean, they've got bills, sir, to
[1:18:54.080 --> 1:18:58.720]  openly seize everybody's property with any water on it, including rainwater. I mean,
[1:18:58.720 --> 1:19:03.600]  you can't, it says they can just take any property they want that has any water on it.
[1:19:03.600 --> 1:19:08.840]  Period. Well water aquifer. It's over. I mean, the little criminal city council in Austin
[1:19:08.840 --> 1:19:13.640]  stole over 20,000 acres off claiming it was for aquifers and then they perp and then the
[1:19:13.640 --> 1:19:18.240]  mayors and people openly own the hotels and condos they build on stolen property. I mean,
[1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:23.680]  it's just, just laughing with armed troops around them. It's just mafia evil everywhere.
[1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:28.080]  I mean, you know, I mean, oh God help us. I just want to say, I know it's tough for
[1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:31.520]  you because this is really big for you, but keep doing what you're doing, man. You are
[1:19:31.520 --> 1:19:35.720]  the reason why we have, we, you know, you give us that, that belief that, that we can't
[1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:38.840]  actually win this. We can't take over. So we need you to keep doing this. We need you
[1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:42.480]  to keep on. Don't give up buddy. Don't give up. No, I'm not going to give up. The issue
[1:19:42.480 --> 1:19:47.280]  is I can't believe how obvious it is. And some people are waking up. I just can't believe
[1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:52.120]  it's happening. I'm mourning for humanity in my country. That's really what this is.
[1:19:52.120 --> 1:20:01.200]  I'm, you know, this is horrible. I'm an American. My family's been here for 300 plus years.

[1:22:24.900 --> 1:22:28.660]  the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a
[1:22:28.660 --> 1:22:32.820]  privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes
[1:22:32.820 --> 1:22:33.940]  to service the debt?
[1:22:33.940 --> 1:22:38.620]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public
[1:22:38.620 --> 1:22:42.700]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[1:24:28.100 --> 1:24:31.500]  She goes, when you do this full time, you've got to clear a picture.
[1:24:31.500 --> 1:24:35.980]  I remember the London Guardian and New York Times about six years ago, I made a huge deal
[1:24:35.980 --> 1:24:36.980]  out of it.
[1:24:36.980 --> 1:24:43.060]  They said, under new national compulsory service in the UK and the US, one of the jobs of the
[1:24:43.060 --> 1:24:48.500]  youth corps and the senior corps, the government's going to give you a computer.
[1:24:48.500 --> 1:24:52.180]  So when you hear these free programs for computers, oh, everybody should have a computer.
[1:24:52.180 --> 1:24:58.180]  It then randomly dials you into a city, tells you the tattletale phone numbers, and then
[1:24:58.180 --> 1:25:02.740]  has you watch people off the city cameras.
[1:25:02.740 --> 1:25:05.620]  Now by law, they're going to try to make all the private businesses, Chicago's already
[1:25:05.620 --> 1:25:08.240]  doing this, wire into the police.
[1:25:08.240 --> 1:25:14.140]  And so people by law will be wired in watching your office and you, not just outside but
[1:25:14.140 --> 1:25:15.140]  inside.
[1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:16.140]  And no, people don't believe me.
[1:25:16.140 --> 1:25:25.460]  This Houston police chief wants cameras inside homes in your house and they got cameras in
[1:25:25.460 --> 1:25:28.500]  the school bathrooms now and they go, oh yeah, we filmed the children while they used the
[1:25:28.500 --> 1:25:29.500]  bathroom.
[1:25:29.500 --> 1:25:34.540]  Remember in Tennessee, visiting group of 11 year old basketball girls, I guess they were
[1:25:34.540 --> 1:25:37.580]  in the seventh grade or something.
[1:25:37.580 --> 1:25:40.780]  And they were after the basketball game and went to take showers and panic.
[1:25:40.780 --> 1:25:41.780]  There was a panic.
[1:25:41.780 --> 1:25:45.420]  It said with girls running out into the street screaming with their parents picking them up
[1:25:45.420 --> 1:25:48.940]  waiting outside, saying there's a camera in the shower and the police said, what's the
[1:25:48.940 --> 1:25:50.020]  big deal?
[1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:53.060]  We film all the girls and boys naked.
[1:25:53.060 --> 1:25:57.100]  That was in the Tennessee and they just said, it's not, see, that's a psychological warfare
[1:25:57.100 --> 1:25:58.100]  thing.
[1:25:58.100 --> 1:25:59.580]  Yeah, we film your naked children.
[1:25:59.580 --> 1:26:03.580]  What's, there could be crime in the showers for your safety.
[1:26:03.580 --> 1:26:04.980]  You're not feeling well.
[1:26:04.980 --> 1:26:07.900]  You don't think it's normal to have your children videotaped naked.
[1:26:07.900 --> 1:26:08.900]  Same thing in Sacramento.
[1:26:08.900 --> 1:26:11.300]  The police watch the kids and they go, what's the big deal?
[1:26:11.300 --> 1:26:13.420]  I, it's, you're not wanting her.
[1:26:13.420 --> 1:26:15.420]  What are you seeing?
[1:26:15.420 --> 1:26:17.780]  This is all psychologists, psychiatrists run.
[1:26:17.780 --> 1:26:22.940]  It's all a big joke to them to just shock you with incredible stuff and then just legitimize
[1:26:22.940 --> 1:26:23.940]  it.
[1:26:23.940 --> 1:26:24.940]  But here it is.
[1:26:24.940 --> 1:26:30.220]  Lancaster PA keeping a close eye on itself, a vast and growing web of security cameras
[1:26:30.220 --> 1:26:36.940]  monitors the 55,000, the city, 55,000 operated by a private group of self appointed gatekeepers.
[1:26:36.940 --> 1:26:43.060]  There's been surprising a little outcry Los Angeles times.
[1:26:43.060 --> 1:26:46.260]  It's the same thing all over the world, but by law, and that's what the New York Times
[1:26:46.260 --> 1:26:47.260]  is now admitting.
[1:26:47.260 --> 1:26:52.440]  Oh, the secure core people are going to sit it and it said, so they don't watch the locals.
[1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:56.180]  They'll watch somebody else in other city and the New York Times reported five, six
[1:26:56.180 --> 1:26:57.180]  years ago.
[1:26:57.180 --> 1:27:01.660]  I remember the article that said, oh, to make sure people stay on their toes, the government's
[1:27:01.660 --> 1:27:06.420]  going to place computer generated fake crimes over the video images.
[1:27:06.420 --> 1:27:08.340]  Yeah, it's going to be fake.
[1:27:08.340 --> 1:27:12.260]  Just like they simulate fake terror attacks, then two days later say, oh, that bus that
[1:27:12.260 --> 1:27:16.940]  got blown up in Belton, Texas, that car that got blown up in Belton, Texas two days ago,
[1:27:16.940 --> 1:27:17.940]  that wasn't a terror attack.
[1:27:17.940 --> 1:27:23.660]  Like we said, yeah, they say terrorists have hit all over the, and then people freak out.
[1:27:23.660 --> 1:27:24.660]  Why is it on national news?
[1:27:24.660 --> 1:27:29.980]  And they all panic and come down to the mayor's office and then they go, it's a drill.
[1:27:29.980 --> 1:27:30.980]  Then it becomes a rumor.
[1:27:30.980 --> 1:27:31.980]  They were hit by terrorists.
[1:27:31.980 --> 1:27:33.140]  See, it's all psych warfare.
[1:27:33.140 --> 1:27:41.020]  Well, it's the same thing here where they then superimpose fake terrorist over regular
[1:27:41.020 --> 1:27:47.340]  city video shots to then test and see if the citizens groups that are volunteering, but
[1:27:47.340 --> 1:27:48.340]  in the future it's compulsory.
[1:27:48.340 --> 1:27:52.820]  They're saying are really watching the computer screen and it says, well, it's too boring
[1:27:52.820 --> 1:27:54.860]  because there's never any real crime.
[1:27:54.860 --> 1:27:57.060]  So we do simulations to make it interesting.
[1:27:57.060 --> 1:28:03.500]  See to test and see if the tabling is working well to create the psychological subconscious
[1:28:03.500 --> 1:28:09.020]  picture in the mind that there really are terror attacks and mass shootings going on.
[1:28:09.020 --> 1:28:18.020]  It's a video feed with a video game almost indistinguishable from reality overlaid to
[1:28:18.020 --> 1:28:28.140]  create the psychological illusion of terror attacks just like these federally funded drills
[1:28:28.140 --> 1:28:31.940]  in Michigan and Texas and all over that have been in the news where the police come show
[1:28:31.940 --> 1:28:35.100]  up at elementary so the kids don't know it's fake.
[1:28:35.100 --> 1:28:36.780]  They call them out in the parking lot.
[1:28:36.780 --> 1:28:38.340]  They drill shooting them in the head.
[1:28:38.340 --> 1:28:43.020]  The children cry, teachers collapse thinking it's real, that's happening in Minnesota.
[1:28:43.020 --> 1:28:46.100]  One case we had the lady on, they came and told her we're going to kill you, took the
[1:28:46.100 --> 1:28:49.220]  kids out in the woods behind the school out of the portal building and said you're all
[1:28:49.220 --> 1:28:52.580]  going to die now.
[1:28:52.580 --> 1:28:57.580]  Woman's now a basket case, kids defecating on themselves and they said we are homeschoolers
[1:28:57.580 --> 1:28:58.720]  here to kill you.
[1:28:58.720 --> 1:29:00.860]  We are pro second amendment homeschoolers.
[1:29:00.860 --> 1:29:04.460]  We are homeschoolers against public education and then the parents hear about it later
[1:29:04.460 --> 1:29:08.020]  and say it was a drill for homeschoolers killing us.
[1:29:08.020 --> 1:29:12.020]  And then the hate goes on the homeschoolers because the public is under mind control to
[1:29:12.020 --> 1:29:17.420]  accept whatever the police say so they psychologically engage in double think, triple think, crime
[1:29:17.420 --> 1:29:21.100]  stop as Orwell said and decide it's the homeschoolers fault.
[1:29:21.100 --> 1:29:28.180]  So now the trauma based mind control torture is placed off of the police who deserve the
[1:29:28.180 --> 1:29:34.580]  blame for the mind control off on to homeschoolers.
[1:29:34.580 --> 1:29:40.500]  This is how a reeducation camp works but all of America is now a giant reeducation camp
[1:29:40.500 --> 1:29:45.660]  with a television sets, bombarding us, the schools, the corporate workplaces, all of
[1:29:45.660 --> 1:29:51.140]  the sensitivity training, all mass programming, hold your eye back.
[1:29:51.140 --> 1:29:54.860]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[1:29:54.860 --> 1:30:00.820]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:00.820 --> 1:30:05.260]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:30:05.260 --> 1:30:06.260]  this summer.
[1:30:06.260 --> 1:30:10.140]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:30:10.140 --> 1:30:14.700]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:30:14.700 --> 1:30:15.940]  allows you to have.
[1:30:15.940 --> 1:30:21.100]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:30:21.100 --> 1:30:25.700]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded especially
[1:30:25.700 --> 1:30:27.620]  with the high demand summer months ahead.
[1:30:27.620 --> 1:30:31.180]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[1:30:31.180 --> 1:30:34.860]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[1:30:34.860 --> 1:30:39.380]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:30:39.380 --> 1:30:43.540]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:30:43.540 --> 1:30:45.220]  a long time sponsor of ours.
[1:30:45.220 --> 1:30:51.620]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:30:51.620 --> 1:30:54.260]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[1:30:54.260 --> 1:31:00.460]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[1:31:00.460 --> 1:31:01.820]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:31:01.820 --> 1:31:03.860]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[1:31:03.860 --> 1:31:04.860]  Well you should.
[1:31:04.860 --> 1:31:10.100]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you, that's right.
[1:31:10.100 --> 1:31:15.900]  You can attend five days of world class gun training at front site firearms training institute
[1:31:15.900 --> 1:31:20.540]  and secure a 30 state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar, plus if you
[1:31:20.540 --> 1:31:21.540]  act fast.
[1:31:21.540 --> 1:31:26.260]  The millionaire patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber
[1:31:26.260 --> 1:31:27.260]  of your choice.
[1:31:27.260 --> 1:31:31.420]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels
[1:31:31.420 --> 1:31:34.460]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[1:31:34.460 --> 1:31:38.740]  Front site provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor
[1:31:38.740 --> 1:31:39.940]  attitudes.
[1:31:39.940 --> 1:31:46.500]  This is real, don't miss out, secure a front site defensive handgun course, plus a 30 state
[1:31:46.500 --> 1:31:50.900]  concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[1:31:50.900 --> 1:31:59.100]  Go to frontsite.com today, that's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com, go to frontsite.com for your training
[1:31:59.100 --> 1:32:00.100]  and free gun.
[1:32:00.100 --> 1:32:03.460]  Sorry, if you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[1:32:03.460 --> 1:32:06.860]  Hi, summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[1:32:06.860 --> 1:32:10.300]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a
[1:32:10.300 --> 1:32:11.780]  learning curve.
[1:32:11.780 --> 1:32:13.860]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[1:32:13.860 --> 1:32:17.140]  To speed it up you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[1:32:17.140 --> 1:32:19.140]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[1:32:19.140 --> 1:32:21.940]  Her wild food knowledge package is the crash course.
[1:32:21.940 --> 1:32:25.660]  The DVD gives you a three hour overview of her world directly from her.
[1:32:25.660 --> 1:32:30.100]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[1:32:30.100 --> 1:32:34.260]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your field work.
[1:32:34.260 --> 1:32:38.020]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet
[1:32:38.020 --> 1:32:40.380]  survivalist in weeks, not years.
[1:32:40.380 --> 1:32:44.980]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal, she's my mom and I watched her do it.
[1:32:44.980 --> 1:32:49.820]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51eatfree.
[1:32:49.820 --> 1:32:50.820]  Start now.
[1:32:50.820 --> 1:32:52.320]  Knowledge is power.
[1:32:52.320 --> 1:32:53.320]  Better take action.
[1:32:53.320 --> 1:33:20.420]  I think a storm's coming.
[1:33:20.420 --> 1:33:50.360]  All right, I'm doing a big news blitz for continuing when your phone calls at 1-800-559-9231.
[1:33:50.360 --> 1:33:56.000]  We're going to be simulcasting for the next two hours and 27 minutes that we have left
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  in the syndicated broadcast.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:05.880]  We normally simulcast the last two hours at personsoflinet.tv, but some days we simulcast
[1:34:05.880 --> 1:34:07.880]  more, obviously.
[1:34:07.880 --> 1:34:09.280]  Big news blitz coming up right now.
[1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:18.400]  I want to hit what's really happening in Iran and in North Korea right now and how on this
[1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:25.360]  global grand chess board all of this feeds in and is connected.
[1:34:25.360 --> 1:34:32.440]  The establishment crafts its propaganda to be very lowbrow, very simple, targeting the
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:39.120]  largest swath of the population, the lowest common denominator.
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:47.440]  And so John Bolton, Zbigniew Brzezinski, all the planners from Bush and Obama are all publicly
[1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:53.240]  bragging that they're staging all this in Iran right now.
[1:34:53.240 --> 1:34:58.920]  But they're like the match that lights the fire.
[1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:04.840]  The fire takes on a life of its own, and the people rioting have some legitimate claims.
[1:35:04.840 --> 1:35:06.840]  So this isn't a black and white issue.
[1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:11.920]  You have to pull back geopolitically and decide what is most moral to support and what
[1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:13.080]  is most moral to do.
[1:35:13.080 --> 1:35:18.360]  And I have wrestled with this, that's why for a week I said I couldn't really comment.
[1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:24.000]  I said my heart is with the protesters, but I said that can be deceiving what's being
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:29.640]  presented as a fog of disinformation and war.
[1:35:29.640 --> 1:35:32.160]  But now we have a very clear picture.
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:38.280]  And so over a week into the rioting and death on both sides, I can comment on that.
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:43.760]  In North Korea, just the situation is it is very, very grave, very, very serious, rivaling
[1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:46.600]  the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960s.
[1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:51.720]  We've seen nothing of this magnitude since then, and it's clear on every front.
[1:35:51.720 --> 1:35:56.120]  The new world order is launching offensives against free humanity on the grand chess board
[1:35:56.120 --> 1:35:59.040]  trying to take out the last few countries they don't control.
[1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:00.840]  Obviously North Korea is horrible.
[1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:03.320]  Obviously the moulas are corrupt and do a lot of bad stuff.
[1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:07.680]  They're not as sophisticated or one-tenth as evil as the globalists, but not a threat
[1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:08.880]  to this nation, certainly.
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:12.240]  But the issue is the globalists can go, oh, look, we're fighting North Korea.
[1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:13.600]  We're fighting the moulas.
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:15.280]  Why is that happening now, though?
[1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:19.560]  What's the bigger picture?
[1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:20.560]  And what is the history?
[1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:25.200]  And of course, the moulas are in about five different blocks as well and constantly fighting
[1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:27.880]  with each other.
[1:36:27.880 --> 1:36:39.760]  So I could criticize the moulas that are hereditarily related to Mohammed, but then it's almost
[1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:40.760]  like a legislature.
[1:36:40.760 --> 1:36:46.640]  It's like a royal system, but it's also legislative because the system votes their own people
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:50.280]  in and out, and then they, of course, do allow free elections.
[1:36:50.280 --> 1:36:51.280]  That's been documented.
[1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:55.400]  So it's a very, very strange system they created.
[1:36:55.400 --> 1:37:03.080]  But if you're going to criticize it, because it is bloodline related, you can't be on these
[1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:09.440]  councils unless you're related to Mohammed from Saudi Arabia, what Saudi Arabia today,
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:10.440]  Mecca.
[1:37:10.440 --> 1:37:13.240]  Now, the problem is to try to give people a detailed breakdown.
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:14.240]  It's so complex.
[1:37:14.240 --> 1:37:17.360]  That's why it's just easy for the government to go, oh, look, they're killing innocent
[1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:18.360]  women.
[1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:19.360]  Let's attack them.
[1:37:19.360 --> 1:37:20.880]  Oh, yes, with smart bombs.
[1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:23.800]  So, oh, smart bomb hit the wrong building, killed 300.
[1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:26.600]  Another hit a car and killed 50 around it.
[1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:30.320]  Yeah, little kids, arms and legs blown off, we're not going to show you the little kids.
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:34.360]  You know, there are those videos out on the web of a little kid with his bottom half blown
[1:37:34.360 --> 1:37:38.880]  off crawling and then the lights going out of his eyes, just like a light bulb turning
[1:37:38.880 --> 1:37:39.880]  off.
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:40.880]  I mean, we could show you that.
[1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:45.200]  We don't show you that to make you be anti-war because it's so hard.
[1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:51.160]  We're forced to show the footage they're showing on CNN and Fox, though, in many cases, unedited
[1:37:51.160 --> 1:37:52.880]  and watching CNN this morning.
[1:37:52.880 --> 1:37:56.080]  Sometimes they show her dying and the blood pouring out, and then other times they blur
[1:37:56.080 --> 1:37:57.080]  the face.
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:38:05.440]  So, I don't know what the si-op is there or it may just be different producers call on
[1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:08.840]  it, but we're going to show you the unedited video.
[1:38:08.840 --> 1:38:12.000]  Some people distrust the media so much they're saying it's fake.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  If it's fake, we know Jerry Bruckheimer on record stage, the rescue of Jessica Lynch,
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  Jessica Lynn.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:24.160]  The time passes.
[1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:26.800]  Who was the girl, Jessica Lynch?
[1:38:26.800 --> 1:38:27.800]  Yeah, Lynch.
[1:38:27.800 --> 1:38:28.800]  I mean, that's admitted.
[1:38:28.800 --> 1:38:33.600]  Jerry Bruckheimer told the BBC that Iraqi saved her.
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:34.600]  The U.S.
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:35.600]  had already taken over that area.
[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:39.280]  The Iraqi doctors came to their checkpoints and said, we have an American here and some
[1:38:39.280 --> 1:38:41.160]  dead from the shoot out on the road.
[1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:45.000]  The Republican Guard has pulled back, so they said, okay, we'll be there in a little while.
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:48.320]  Sent troops, met with them, said, okay, we're going to come get the bodies and then stage
[1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:51.800]  kicking in the doors and beating up the doctors and, you know, the doctors were in there trying
[1:38:51.800 --> 1:38:53.360]  to kill her.
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:38:57.360]  And then Lynch later said, no, they saved us and this is all fake.
[1:38:57.360 --> 1:38:58.920]  And I didn't fight the people off.
[1:38:58.920 --> 1:39:02.840]  They wanted to sell women in the military.
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:05.840]  Then the family of the people that actually did fight the Republican Guard off and got
[1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:08.040]  killed, an Hispanic gentleman.
[1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:09.720]  They came and murdered some of those families.
[1:39:09.720 --> 1:39:11.720]  I remember this was in the news.
[1:39:11.720 --> 1:39:16.200]  People that survived in her unit would be cooking hamburgers in their backyard in Phoenix
[1:39:16.200 --> 1:39:21.440]  and a guy in a black uniform would pop up and double tap them in the head from 25 yards.
[1:39:21.440 --> 1:39:26.120]  That was in the news at the time, but I'm already digressing, you know, you see fake
[1:39:26.120 --> 1:39:32.440]  stuff like that, but Brockheimer, I don't think could do a woman dying the light going
[1:39:32.440 --> 1:39:33.440]  out of her eyes like this.
[1:39:33.440 --> 1:39:38.280]  If you haven't seen somebody die up close and I've seen it repeatedly, you don't, you
[1:39:38.280 --> 1:39:40.840]  don't know reality when you're seeing it.
[1:39:40.840 --> 1:39:44.200]  Now they could have morphed over a woman's face, another woman dying in a hospital of
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:51.360]  a car wreck or something, you know, they got, they got tricks, but it's hard to fake somebody
[1:39:51.360 --> 1:39:52.800]  really dying.
[1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:57.520]  All the Hollywood movies I've seen when somebody goes, you know, and dies, they're trying to
[1:39:57.520 --> 1:40:10.320]  fake it, but it just didn't like watching the, the, the soul go out of somebody, the,
[1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:11.320]  the essence.
[1:40:11.320 --> 1:40:17.120]  It's, it's, it's a, anybody who's seen somebody die up close has seen it and their eyes will
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:21.040]  be open and you literally just see the light go out and just like, there's something like
[1:40:21.040 --> 1:40:26.000]  coming out, but side issue, very, very touching, very, very poignant.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.880]  And I'm sure she thought when she was out there protesting that it was a great thing
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:35.080]  she was doing and you can't help but support her and it's designed so that they can bomb
[1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:38.680]  all the water treatment plants and all the schools and all the colleges and kill over
[1:40:38.680 --> 1:40:40.920]  a million just like Iraq.
[1:40:40.920 --> 1:40:44.720]  Well, they've killed a million, 300,000 in Iraq, according to British medical journal
[1:40:44.720 --> 1:40:55.720]  Lancet who's nonpartisan and highly respected and Iran has almost, it's more than double.
[1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:58.880]  It's almost triple.
[1:40:58.880 --> 1:41:04.440]  They got almost three times population of Iraq and when the US funded the attack on
[1:41:04.440 --> 1:41:11.040]  Iran in the, in the eighties, that killed over a million and a half Iranians and 300,000
[1:41:11.040 --> 1:41:18.240]  Iraqis, so the Iranians won't give up, so I'd probably say if they just bombard them,
[1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:25.960]  it'll kill to blow up their infrastructure, 60, 70,000, but they actually do some type
[1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:32.040]  of big civil war or invasion out of Iraq, millions, millions.
[1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:37.800]  And so you got to ask yourself, you want to get all emotional and call for the attack
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:40.840]  on Iran?
[1:41:40.840 --> 1:41:46.240]  Do you want to say turn into a glass parking lot because that woman died?
[1:41:46.240 --> 1:41:51.040]  How about we nuke and because they're talking about using nukes against Iran?
[1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:53.760]  How about we kill a million because, because, because this one woman's dead.
[1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:57.000]  How about we kill whole houses full of kids and whole houses full of women?
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:01.160]  See, they always dehumanize the Iraqis and never show you on the news the dead kids and
[1:42:01.160 --> 1:42:04.760]  the dead families and the troops sitting off the side of the road shooting truckloads of
[1:42:04.760 --> 1:42:09.720]  families and laughing about it as the families fall out dead and the military says, well,
[1:42:09.720 --> 1:42:16.040]  the troops thought they were threatened by the family and on the audio, they're laughing.
[1:42:16.040 --> 1:42:21.640]  But see when they want to make them humans, oh, look at this beautiful young lady and
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:27.600]  they'll show the Iranian people and folks are like, well, they look like like us or a lot
[1:42:27.600 --> 1:42:28.600]  like us.
[1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:36.960]  You know, like clean cut, sharp, smart people, but I thought they were saying, you know,
[1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:42.520]  in words, glass parking lot, you know, it's this sickening attitude.
[1:42:42.520 --> 1:42:43.640]  Let's nuke them.
[1:42:43.640 --> 1:42:44.640]  Let's see now.
[1:42:44.640 --> 1:42:45.640]  Oh, our humanity.
[1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:50.360]  Oh, oh, meanwhile, the police are being overrun.
[1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:54.280]  The revolution looks like it's being beaten back for now, but you never know this stage
[1:42:54.280 --> 1:42:55.600]  color revolution.
[1:42:55.600 --> 1:43:00.400]  They're attacking and killing police, beating them to death all over the country on video
[1:43:00.400 --> 1:43:04.080]  and the police, when huge crowds are climbing up the barricades, setting buildings on fire
[1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:10.320]  are selectively shooting people to drive them back.
[1:43:10.320 --> 1:43:16.520]  And that's how the revolution in Lexington and Concord began.
[1:43:16.520 --> 1:43:23.840]  But that was a real revolution of the colonies and you better believe that Sam Adams was
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:29.280]  there manipulating the whole situation.
[1:43:29.280 --> 1:43:30.880]  But he believed their cause was right.
[1:43:30.880 --> 1:43:32.360]  They wanted to have the confrontations.
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:33.760]  They wanted to get the fight started.
[1:43:33.760 --> 1:43:38.360]  So you've got to morally decide who's running this fight and isn't moral.
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:42.080]  And when you find out the CIA and the New World Order, the ones put an IQ reducer in
[1:43:42.080 --> 1:43:45.600]  your tap water, the one shooting your kids up with Mercury and saying, Mercury's good
[1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:47.840]  for children's brains on the news.
[1:43:47.840 --> 1:43:52.520]  When you realize they're the ones, no doubt orchestrating this, even the CIA, even picking
[1:43:52.520 --> 1:43:55.760]  the color green because that's the Islamic color.
[1:43:55.760 --> 1:43:58.880]  This guy's an Islamist insider.
[1:43:58.880 --> 1:44:04.480]  The guy tied into the CIA on record from the Iran conference situation as the foreign minister
[1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:07.520]  making the Iran contra deal.
[1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:12.760]  Even beforehand, he's the, he's the main spook of anybody in the Iranian government.
[1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:17.600]  This is the guy, the most hooked up with the West.
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:22.480]  And so you got to ask yourselves, why are they showing you this woman and not?
[1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:29.480]  The videos of women being shot with 50 cows for target practice entertainment at 2,000
[1:44:29.480 --> 1:44:35.880]  yards away as described by newspapers like the London Guardian, London Telegraph in front
[1:44:35.880 --> 1:44:42.680]  of British reporters, US Marines with 50 cows shot a woman with a three year old holding
[1:44:42.680 --> 1:44:47.280]  her hand, walking down the desert path and, and, and just made a bet in front of them
[1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:51.440]  about, I bet I can blow her F and head off and then did it at, and was described in the
[1:44:51.440 --> 1:44:55.040]  paper by the news and the newspaper people attacked the Marines and said, what's your
[1:44:55.040 --> 1:44:56.040]  problem?
[1:44:56.040 --> 1:44:59.400]  And the Marines screamed, we'll kill more effing little children.
[1:44:59.400 --> 1:45:00.400]  We love it.
[1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:03.320]  And it described the devil tattoos and everything on them.
[1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:04.880]  I mean, this is evil.
[1:45:04.880 --> 1:45:08.480]  And the reporters had souls and were like, you just blew that woman's head off like
[1:45:08.480 --> 1:45:15.280]  she was a watermelon you bought at the store and, you know, shot with a 30 odd six to watch
[1:45:15.280 --> 1:45:21.760]  it shatter or like a milk jug full of water.
[1:45:21.760 --> 1:45:24.320]  I was a kid growing up.
[1:45:24.320 --> 1:45:25.320]  We used to go down to the farm.
[1:45:25.320 --> 1:45:28.440]  My dad would put a little gasoline in a milk cart and stick a rag in it, light it and shoot
[1:45:28.440 --> 1:45:29.440]  it.
[1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:30.440]  Boom.
[1:45:30.440 --> 1:45:31.440]  You know, had a little fun with the milk cart.
[1:45:31.440 --> 1:45:34.600]  No, let's do it with a woman with a three year old.
[1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:35.800]  She's holding by the hand.
[1:45:35.800 --> 1:45:36.800]  This is confirmed.
[1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:41.160]  Oh, but you're not going to want to hear about that.
[1:45:41.160 --> 1:45:47.000]  You want to hear about this so you can then hate the Iranians and go in there and blow
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:50.920]  that country back to kingdom come just like Serbia, just like Iraq.
[1:45:50.920 --> 1:45:52.640]  Anybody tries to build their own country.
[1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:59.680]  That's a first world nation, 65% urbanized Tehran looks like New York City in the mountains.
[1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:00.680]  Gorgeous.
[1:46:00.680 --> 1:46:08.160]  But look at it, but see, they got to have their water fluoridated.
[1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:09.160]  They got to eat GMO.
[1:46:09.160 --> 1:46:11.120]  They got to have that light.
[1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:13.900]  They look like people in old photos from the thirties and forties that have that light
[1:46:13.900 --> 1:46:15.400]  in their eyes that are awake and alive.
[1:46:15.400 --> 1:46:20.400]  You look at Americans, it's like, because we're drugged out, we're entertained out.
[1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:21.520]  We don't have that spark, folks.
[1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:23.320]  They want to, they're in Serbia now.
[1:46:23.320 --> 1:46:24.320]  They floored out of their water.
[1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:27.520]  Oh, we invaded just to do this because we care about you.
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:29.840]  You're not going to complain anymore after this.
[1:46:29.840 --> 1:46:30.840]  Drink up.
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:37.220]  You understand how diabolical this is?
[1:46:37.220 --> 1:46:38.720]  Let's go ahead and read you some of this.
[1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:39.920]  I'm going to play the video.
[1:46:39.920 --> 1:46:45.640]  I ran fury as YouTube screens last moments of woman shot dead at democratic rally.
[1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:50.480]  See, they're using Twitter, which they admit the CIA was pushing these Twitters out day
[1:46:50.480 --> 1:46:51.480]  one.
[1:46:51.480 --> 1:46:52.480]  John Bolton's bragging about it.
[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:56.520]  I had Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on for 45 minutes.
[1:46:56.520 --> 1:47:00.560]  Former Wall Street Journal editor syndicated calmness as he went through all the admissions.
[1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:06.040]  The White House admits Bush and Obama, they're running these covert ops at destabilization.
[1:47:06.040 --> 1:47:08.840]  Now the kids have been oppressed.
[1:47:08.840 --> 1:47:10.480]  There is oppression there like any government.
[1:47:10.480 --> 1:47:12.080]  I'm not defending it.
[1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:15.480]  The issue is, this is a false revolution.
[1:47:15.480 --> 1:47:20.000]  And these kids don't understand it's, they don't intend their revolution to win.
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:24.240]  It is meant to make Iran look bad and the American people and British people's eyes
[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:26.320]  and European's eyes.
[1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:31.440]  So there can be a bombardment of Iran using many nukes that Israel says they're getting
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:32.440]  ready to do.
[1:47:32.440 --> 1:47:33.440]  Remember Jerome Corsi.
[1:47:33.440 --> 1:47:38.440]  I want to get back on about this, but let's say, you know, that guy's all hooked up into
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:39.440]  this stuff.
[1:47:39.440 --> 1:47:41.880]  And he's like, suddenly about a year ago, oh, I don't want to attack Iran now, Alex.
[1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:46.080]  He had been back when that was the Bush policy, then he shifts to, oh, no, we need to fund
[1:47:46.080 --> 1:47:49.560]  the revolution because the Iranian people don't like their government, which a lot of
[1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:50.560]  them.
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:51.560]  It's true.
[1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:54.760]  But the issue is the globalists don't have something good in mind for Iran.
[1:47:54.760 --> 1:48:02.400]  They have something bad in mind, the humanization, destruction of their infrastructure.
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:09.200]  So going over the story, Iran fury as YouTube screens last moments of woman shot dead at
[1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:14.520]  democracy rally, an Iranian woman looks up at the camera as she lies dying on the streets
[1:48:14.520 --> 1:48:18.560]  of Tehran after Saturday's democratic protest.
[1:48:18.560 --> 1:48:20.120]  Blood starts to pour from her mouth and her nose.
[1:48:20.120 --> 1:48:24.360]  Yes, she gets hit in the heart, a orders blowing, it's going into her lungs.
[1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:25.360]  It's just, it's horrible.
[1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:28.200]  And well, you can tell she's been hit.
[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:34.520]  She's realizing, oh my God, and just her eyes just blaze with life force, just like a sun
[1:48:34.520 --> 1:48:38.480]  when it's about to burn out, first gets real brighter, a light bulb, when it's about to
[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:41.960]  burn out, gets real bright, the universe is all the same.
[1:48:41.960 --> 1:48:49.320]  Just like her eyes go, like I'm young, I want to have kids, I wanted to live and they go,
[1:48:49.320 --> 1:48:50.320]  she's dead.
[1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:52.480]  I mean, it's very touching.
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:53.760]  So we're going to go ahead and roll this tape.
[1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:54.760]  Here it is unedited.
[1:48:54.760 --> 1:48:57.120]  Are we playing the CNN or the raw footage?
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:04.120]  Raw footage, go ahead and roll it.
[1:49:27.120 --> 1:49:45.440]  Yeah, you can't fake that now.
[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:51.200]  When they bombard Iran, there's little kids laying dead everywhere and there's dead women
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:53.560]  all over the place and there's people screaming and crying.
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:55.520]  You're not going to see it on the news.
[1:49:55.520 --> 1:50:00.920]  You're just going to see boom, boom, as buildings are blowing up, pull up shock and awe, pull
[1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:04.480]  up the 2003 bombardment of Baghdad for folks.
[1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:10.720]  You're going to get to sit back, pop the bastards, kill that girl and you're going to sit there
[1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:19.080]  while people are dying by the hundreds every time one of those 2000 pound bombs goes off.
[1:50:19.080 --> 1:50:24.680]  And the United States government hijacked by the foreign bankers admits on record that
[1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:35.600]  they're funding four al-Qaeda groups, four al-Qaeda groups, inside Iran, which is Shiite,
[1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:41.160]  the opposite group of Islam, to destabilize them, blowing up mosques, bombing school buses,
[1:50:41.160 --> 1:50:44.160]  killing whole mosques full of people, whole blown to bits.
[1:50:44.160 --> 1:50:47.280]  Oh, but that's on Iranian TV.
[1:50:47.280 --> 1:50:49.800]  That's not on TV here.
[1:50:49.800 --> 1:50:53.800]  And our criminal government admits they're doing it, like, do something, Iran.
[1:50:53.800 --> 1:50:54.800]  Do something.
[1:50:54.800 --> 1:50:55.800]  Do something.
[1:50:55.800 --> 1:50:56.800]  We're going to nuke you.
[1:50:56.800 --> 1:50:57.800]  Oh, you won't fight back.
[1:50:57.800 --> 1:51:26.800]  We're going to nuke you.
[1:51:26.800 --> 1:51:30.200]  That's what I'm saying, but back it up.
[1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:34.220]  We're going to nuke you.
[1:51:34.220 --> 1:51:37.460]  If you ever got one in you, do it?

[1:52:01.760 --> 1:52:07.440]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[1:52:07.440 --> 1:52:13.440]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:20.160]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[1:52:20.160 --> 1:52:24.760]  Well, Obama's already fudging. It's fudged since day one in this election.
[1:52:24.760 --> 1:52:35.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:41.160]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[1:52:41.160 --> 1:52:48.160]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[1:52:56.160 --> 1:53:00.160]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[1:53:02.160 --> 1:53:13.160]  The New World Order beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[1:53:13.160 --> 1:53:22.160]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options, starves or surrender.
[1:53:22.160 --> 1:53:30.160]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out. What then? Then.
[1:53:30.160 --> 1:53:34.160]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.

[1:53:59.160 --> 1:54:21.160]  This is the end, beautiful friend. This is the end, my only friend.
[1:54:21.160 --> 1:54:27.160]  I haven't even gotten into the North Korea situation. New orders moving on all fronts.
[1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:32.160]  They're moving here domestically saying all protest is terror. That's another thing.
[1:54:32.160 --> 1:54:39.160]  You see this poor woman get killed. I've got lots of footage of cops beating Americans and British to death and shooting you with rubber bullets and killing you.
[1:54:39.160 --> 1:54:47.160]  And footage of cops shooting Americans can cuffed in the back and then not getting in trouble.
[1:54:47.160 --> 1:54:53.160]  Remember this woman dies after head injury, sustained for Red Sox win. Talk about a way of spinning it.
[1:54:53.160 --> 1:54:58.160]  We could play the video of this. Cops walk up, shoot her at less than 10 feet in the face.
[1:54:58.160 --> 1:55:02.160]  She was walking out of a bar, journalism student, no criminal record.
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:07.160]  And the cop, maybe we should pull that up, shoots her right in the face of the rubber bullet shotgun.
[1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:11.160]  He knows you're not supposed to shoot you any more than 35, 40 feet depending on the load.
[1:55:11.160 --> 1:55:16.160]  I mean, they know that kills people. He didn't care. He shot her or I went back in her brain. She died.
[1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:19.160]  Now you're not going to see that. She died in minutes.
[1:55:19.160 --> 1:55:25.160]  You're not going to see, you know, up close video footage. The police fought to not release their own internal video.
[1:55:25.160 --> 1:55:30.160]  I never saw that. I saw chopper video of him like 10 feet away, shooting her right in the face. I mean, right in the face.
[1:55:30.160 --> 1:55:34.160]  She comes walking out. He thinks it's a video game. He wants to have some fun tonight.
[1:55:34.160 --> 1:55:38.160]  He's bored in this storm dripper outfit. You die, lady.
[1:55:38.160 --> 1:55:44.160]  Now we're going to have a foreign government bombard the entire United States because this is because they killed this woman.
[1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:51.160]  Again, we don't know who shot this woman in the chest, but we know what these rallies, if you pull back with the footage,
[1:55:51.160 --> 1:55:58.160]  they're burning cars, burning buildings, moving up, attacking and beating the police to death.
[1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:04.160]  The police are going to shoot you. It's going to happen.
[1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:12.160]  And again, that's the facts here is that they want to go bombard Iran and not show you all the dead kids,
[1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:15.160]  but they want to show you this woman dying.
[1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:26.160]  Show them shocking off, folks. Now, they don't show you the up close people getting killed when it's the globalist attack on a country.
[1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:33.160]  They will only show you from a distance. And it's like, oh, look at the fireworks display, honey.
[1:56:33.160 --> 1:56:41.160]  Oh, look, flashes in the night sky. Oh, how dare those Iraqi shoot their primitive anti aircraft up into the sky.
[1:56:41.160 --> 1:56:47.160]  Those dirty terrorists were only blowing up all their. Oh, there you go.
[1:56:47.160 --> 1:56:55.160]  Oh, we blew up a whole apartment building full of men, women and children. Oh, it's just war. These things happen.
[1:56:55.160 --> 1:57:03.160]  Ah, you know, the Japanese, even though they tried to surrender unconditionally, they deserve to have Hiroshima and Nagasaki a bombed.
[1:57:03.160 --> 1:57:10.160]  Even though the flying Tigers for a year and a half before they attacked Pearl Harbor or attacking them in China.
[1:57:10.160 --> 1:57:22.160]  Oh, and again, I'm just stating the facts here. So it'll be nice distance photos of skyscrapers being blown up full of people.
[1:57:22.160 --> 1:57:27.160]  But when it suits them, they'll show you the woman up close gasping and fighting for her life.
[1:57:27.160 --> 1:57:31.160]  I'm going to get into North Korea after some more calls and then another big huge news blitz.
[1:57:31.160 --> 1:57:36.160]  And I have a Texas state senator coming on with about the police all over the country robbing everybody.
[1:57:36.160 --> 1:57:47.160]  And finally, because of you getting the word out, mainstream media is admitting the new Federal Reserve takeover bill is over all of government total dictatorship of the Fed.
[1:57:47.160 --> 1:57:52.160]  We're going to talk about that as well. So Jim Beverly, John Lou and others that is coming up before I end this hour.
[1:57:52.160 --> 1:57:56.160]  I need to start thinking sponsors only have one sponsor an hour, but I was wait until the end of the show to start plugging them.
[1:57:56.160 --> 1:57:59.160]  So I need to need to get to those now.

[1:58:25.160 --> 1:58:30.160]  I'm like, hey, this is actually good storeable food. The other stuff I bought is junk. I'll call them and get them as a sponsor.

[1:59:09.160 --> 1:59:12.160]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation, but you.

[1:59:45.160 --> 1:59:59.160]  Take action today. The first step is getting storeable food.
[2:00:15.160 --> 2:00:24.160]  On the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:24.160 --> 2:00:43.160]  Bottom line, the CIA is using a power structure split in Iran as a pretext to them demonize the country worldwide to make it look like a popular revolution so they can launch military strikes on them.
[2:00:43.160 --> 2:00:48.160]  The committee of experts can kick anybody off the ballot if they want.
[2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:53.160]  And so they allow you to run for president.
[2:00:53.160 --> 2:00:56.160]  That means they've already selected you.
[2:00:56.160 --> 2:01:02.160]  So they let the people choose from who they choose, kind of like what we have here with the big banks owning both parties.
[2:01:02.160 --> 2:01:05.160]  Just a little bit more of the illusion.
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:10.160]  And this guy that supposedly said he won, he announced that he'd won hours before the polls even closed.
[2:01:10.160 --> 2:01:15.160]  A classic CIA op. Remember the CIA and MI6 over through Iran in 53.
[2:01:15.160 --> 2:01:22.160]  The pro-West, Mohammed Mosaddek, just because he wouldn't give them all the oil money and wanted to modernize the country.
[2:01:22.160 --> 2:01:26.160]  They use radical Muslims to do that, then bait and switch, put the Shah in.
[2:01:26.160 --> 2:01:31.160]  The Shah's son is running around wanting to go take back over at the press club.
[2:01:31.160 --> 2:01:39.160]  It's on CNN. It's just disgusting lies about oppression when his dad killed hundreds and hundreds of thousands of torture under CIA command.
[2:01:39.160 --> 2:01:44.160]  I mean, it's just hypocritical. Don't call yourselves the good guys, and don't say you're the good guys.
[2:01:44.160 --> 2:01:49.160]  The people running our country, the new world running our country, want to destroy our liberties and freedoms,
[2:01:49.160 --> 2:01:52.160]  and they'll treat us just like the Iranians if they can get away with it.
[2:01:52.160 --> 2:01:57.160]  Okay, our common enemy is the new world order. Does that mean I love all the moolahs? No.
[2:01:57.160 --> 2:02:05.160]  Kim Jong-il is another subject. Pure evil, just as evil as the globalists, not as smart, not over as big a kingdom.
[2:02:05.160 --> 2:02:09.160]  And they're going to use that little demon as a pretext, so I'm going to cover that after the break.
[2:02:09.160 --> 2:02:13.160]  Right now, let's keep taking calls. Jim in Ohio, you're on the air, Jim.
[2:02:13.160 --> 2:02:20.160]  Mary Notha, Alex Semper fi. I just wanted to tell you that, you know, that green core thing that you talked about?
[2:02:20.160 --> 2:02:29.160]  People were joining felons and stuff. Well, my nephew, he's in the jail right now, and he's qualifying to join that.
[2:02:29.160 --> 2:02:38.160]  And he was a former Army Ranger. And the other thing I saw was a movie on TV the other day called Pentalute or something like that.
[2:02:38.160 --> 2:02:44.160]  And it was a girl born part pig. She had a pig nose, pig ears, like that there.
[2:02:44.160 --> 2:02:47.160]  And as far as the war things goes, these have been going on just like this.
[2:02:47.160 --> 2:02:53.160]  You can trace it clear back, far in history. They use people for their bullets and their things to do whatever they want to do.
[2:02:53.160 --> 2:02:59.160]  It's always been done that way. And thanks for what you're doing, Mary Notha.
[2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:09.160]  Mary Notha. I'm ignorant. What does that mean? I remember vaguely what it means. I can't look at Mary Notha, see what that means.
[2:03:09.160 --> 2:03:13.160]  Let's talk to Beverly and Georgia. Beverly, you're on the air.
[2:03:13.160 --> 2:03:14.160]  Hello?
[2:03:14.160 --> 2:03:15.160]  Yes, Beverly.
[2:03:15.160 --> 2:03:25.160]  Good afternoon, Alex. I've just got a couple of quick points that I wanted to tell you about. And thank you for waking me up to Ron Paul.
[2:03:25.160 --> 2:03:30.160]  I was honored to volunteer for him when I was living in South Carolina.
[2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:39.160]  You've seen those pictures that went across the Internet of Iraqi women and holding up pictures of signs they had.
[2:03:39.160 --> 2:03:46.160]  Thank you, Mr. Bush, and thank you, America, and stuff like that. You familiar with that?
[2:03:46.160 --> 2:03:48.160]  Yes, in English, all staged.
[2:03:48.160 --> 2:03:49.160]  Right, exactly.
[2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:54.160]  That's not admitted. That was all staged. No, it was run by Ahmed Shalabi on record.
[2:03:54.160 --> 2:03:59.160]  Absolutely. My cousin is married to one of the spin doctors for the Air Force.
[2:03:59.160 --> 2:04:05.160]  Before that ever went on the Internet, it ruined my Christmas to see that one time.
[2:04:05.160 --> 2:04:11.160]  And so if anybody that sees that is still going around and it's just disgusting.
[2:04:11.160 --> 2:04:21.160]  Well, they use three-year-old video of Palestinians celebrating an election and said that was them celebrating 9-11. It's just all lies.
[2:04:21.160 --> 2:04:34.160]  It sure is. It sure is. And people need to understand whenever I get those pictures now, I write in what I know and I send it around and tell them you'd better wake up.
[2:04:34.160 --> 2:04:36.160]  Stay there. Stay there. Stay there. I'm going to come back to you.
[2:04:36.160 --> 2:04:41.160]  By the way, I'm not even trying to prove my point about this being a setup in Iran.
[2:04:41.160 --> 2:04:44.160]  BBC's had to retract. It's admitted CNN's doing it.
[2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:52.160]  They crop photos of Ahmed Dinajid supporters and then say that they're really supporting his opposition.
[2:04:52.160 --> 2:05:01.160]  I mean, they're just faking everything. They probably shot this woman themselves and we're all ready for it. It's disgusting.
[2:05:01.160 --> 2:05:06.160]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?

[2:06:01.160 --> 2:06:06.160]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the Truth Movement for years.
[2:06:06.160 --> 2:06:08.160]  Inner Health Botanicals.

[2:06:12.160 --> 2:06:21.160]  My wife just loves the stuff and now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his editor's choice award for best superfood of 2009.
[2:06:21.160 --> 2:06:24.160]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[2:06:24.160 --> 2:06:26.160]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[2:06:26.160 --> 2:06:30.160]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price and their formula really works.
[2:06:30.160 --> 2:06:33.160]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[2:06:33.160 --> 2:06:35.160]  Try the Nutra Cafe.
[2:06:35.160 --> 2:06:39.160]  They're great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[2:06:39.160 --> 2:06:42.160]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.

[2:07:00.160 --> 2:07:06.160]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[2:07:06.160 --> 2:07:10.160]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:07:10.160 --> 2:07:15.160]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[2:07:15.160 --> 2:07:20.160]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:07:20.160 --> 2:07:24.160]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[2:07:24.160 --> 2:07:27.160]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[2:07:27.160 --> 2:07:30.160]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[2:07:30.160 --> 2:07:34.160]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[2:07:34.160 --> 2:07:39.160]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:07:39.160 --> 2:07:43.160]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:07:43.160 --> 2:07:45.160]  a long time sponsor of ours.
[2:07:45.160 --> 2:07:49.160]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[2:08:00.160 --> 2:08:09.160]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:08:09.160 --> 2:08:15.160]  There certainly is a war on for your mind going back to your phone calls.
[2:08:15.160 --> 2:08:24.160]  And I'm going to get into what's happening in the Korean Peninsula, not just Iran and the larger chess board.
[2:08:24.160 --> 2:08:26.160]  We've talked about Iran the last 30 minutes or so.
[2:08:26.160 --> 2:08:29.160]  Now I'm going to get into what's happening in Korea.
[2:08:29.160 --> 2:08:35.160]  And this ship is going to be intercepted by the John McCain senior, or I guess John McCain the second,
[2:08:35.160 --> 2:08:42.160]  the father of John McCain, the senator, the recent Republican presidential candidate,
[2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:44.160]  going to intercept the ship.
[2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:48.160]  And North Korea says, if you mess with our ship, we're going to launch nuclear weapons.
[2:08:48.160 --> 2:08:50.160]  And their history is they may do it.
[2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:54.160]  And then the globalists don't have a stage of terror attack.
[2:08:54.160 --> 2:08:57.160]  Kim Jong-il will fire a nuke at Hawaii.
[2:08:57.160 --> 2:09:00.160]  I mean, there's no end to it.
[2:09:00.160 --> 2:09:08.160]  They're just poking the psychopath who's dying of cancer and had strokes about transfer power to his 23-year-old son.
[2:09:08.160 --> 2:09:14.160]  Another example of governments, of communists, of hereditary power, just the corruption.
[2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:19.160]  I'm telling you, in 50 years, if this continues in the U.S., this pad will have kings.
[2:09:19.160 --> 2:09:21.160]  I mean, that's what they do.
[2:09:21.160 --> 2:09:23.160]  That's what they set up.
[2:09:23.160 --> 2:09:26.160]  Okay, going back to Beverly and Georgia, go ahead, Beverly.
[2:09:26.160 --> 2:09:29.160]  Yeah. Alex, one other thing I wanted to tell you about.
[2:09:29.160 --> 2:09:33.160]  I was at a recent bluegrass festival in South Carolina.
[2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:39.160]  Met a young man by the name of Jesse, who was just getting ready to be deployed to Afghanistan.
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:42.160]  I think this was going to be his second time there.
[2:09:42.160 --> 2:09:45.160]  This kid is just, he's just a kid.
[2:09:45.160 --> 2:09:52.160]  We were talking a little bit, and I asked him if he had ever heard of the Iraqi veterans that were against the war
[2:09:52.160 --> 2:09:57.160]  and some of the other groups and about yourself, Ron Paul, and he wasn't.
[2:09:57.160 --> 2:10:03.160]  And as we were talking, what little bits that he would talk to me, he looked at me and he had tears in his eyes,
[2:10:03.160 --> 2:10:08.160]  and he said, if you knew what I knew, and I said, what are you trying to tell me?
[2:10:08.160 --> 2:10:12.160]  Won't you tell me what you want, you know, what's going on?
[2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:14.160]  He said, I never want to go back there.
[2:10:14.160 --> 2:10:17.160]  We don't need to be there, but I've got to go.
[2:10:17.160 --> 2:10:19.160]  And I said, no, I don't think you've got to go.
[2:10:19.160 --> 2:10:24.160]  I think you need to start looking at some of these groups that are standing up.
[2:10:24.160 --> 2:10:27.160]  And, you know, I don't think he's the only one.
[2:10:27.160 --> 2:10:33.160]  I think a lot of these kids know that something is very wrong and they don't need to be there.
[2:10:33.160 --> 2:10:36.160]  And I really felt for that young man.
[2:10:36.160 --> 2:10:38.160]  Well, God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:40.160]  Let's talk your call now from John in Missouri.
[2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:42.160]  John, you're on the air.
[2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:52.160]  Thank you for you and your people there continuing to shine the light on all the cockroaches behind the curtain trying to control our lives.
[2:10:52.160 --> 2:10:54.160]  We're trying our best, sir.
[2:10:54.160 --> 2:11:14.160]  I'm a 54-year-old veteran, and when I was going through my training after boot camp, the Shaw had all his sailors and army men going through training in the United States.
[2:11:14.160 --> 2:11:22.160]  There was 10,000 Iranian sailors going through Great Lakes Training Command when I was there myself, and I met quite a few of them.
[2:11:22.160 --> 2:11:25.160]  And they're just like normal Joe's.
[2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:32.160]  They just want to live a life, peaceably be profitable for their family.
[2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:47.160]  And I just want to put out a word to all the ex hippies and veterans from my era that haven't been raised on foreignated water and everything else that's trying to control our minds.
[2:11:47.160 --> 2:11:54.160]  Think about everything that's happened back from the time when you were protesting in the streets for what was going on in Vietnam.
[2:11:54.160 --> 2:11:57.160]  We don't need another Vietnam to happen.
[2:11:57.160 --> 2:12:04.160]  We screwed the Vietnamese people after World War II and we're going to end up doing the same mistake with Iraq and now Iran.
[2:12:04.160 --> 2:12:12.160]  It's time to put a stop to this continuing revolving door that's taking away our liberties bit by bit.
[2:12:12.160 --> 2:12:19.160]  Time to focus on what the real problem is behind the curtain and keep doing the good work.
[2:12:19.160 --> 2:12:22.160]  And we don't need to bomb Iran.
[2:12:22.160 --> 2:12:27.160]  We're not seeing the real story. We're only seeing what they're allowing us to see.
[2:12:27.160 --> 2:12:29.160]  Absolutely. There's no doubt of that.
[2:12:29.160 --> 2:12:39.160]  They're admitting that these four terror groups, that three of them are Wahhabist or Al Qaeda, number three in Al Qaeda, the White House admits is commanded by the U.S.
[2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:41.160]  You can't make this type of craziness up.
[2:12:41.160 --> 2:12:46.160]  And they're targeting and killing and bombing the police to get the police to shoot at them.
[2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:49.160]  I mean Iran has been very restrained.
[2:12:49.160 --> 2:12:57.160]  It's on record that our government admits they've been staging terror attacks there, blowing up mosques, trying to get the Muslims all hyped up.
[2:12:57.160 --> 2:13:01.160]  And Iran has been overthrown so many times by the West they've learned how to deal with this.
[2:13:01.160 --> 2:13:03.160]  And again, I'm not saying they're perfect either.
[2:13:03.160 --> 2:13:04.160]  That's the problem with government.
[2:13:04.160 --> 2:13:05.160]  It's all bad.
[2:13:05.160 --> 2:13:08.160]  North Korea, U.S., the Mullahs, whatever.
[2:13:08.160 --> 2:13:11.160]  But it's clear the aggressor here is the West.
[2:13:11.160 --> 2:13:19.160]  And it's the same aggressor trying to take our rights, saying that Homeland Security thinks you're the number one threat, John.
[2:13:19.160 --> 2:13:20.160]  I don't know.
[2:13:20.160 --> 2:13:22.160]  I'm probably on the number of lists already.
[2:13:22.160 --> 2:13:29.160]  In fact, I got a Missouri TV station reporting it like it's good and normal that anybody in the Constitution Party is a terrorist.
[2:13:29.160 --> 2:13:30.160]  That's coming up.
[2:13:30.160 --> 2:13:31.160]  I appreciate your calling.
[2:13:31.160 --> 2:13:33.160]  God bless you.
[2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:35.160]  This isn't our government.
[2:13:35.160 --> 2:13:47.160]  It would be bad enough to, if we were a tribal racial country, to go in and murder some neighbors to take over their property.
[2:13:47.160 --> 2:13:49.160]  And that's what most cultures do.
[2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:54.160]  But at least there's a group mind of we only abuse and kill these neighbors.
[2:13:54.160 --> 2:14:00.160]  But once you have this global society, it's the elites against the people and they have all these tricks to play us off.
[2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:09.160]  They're waging war, they're engaging in predator behavior on us.
[2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:19.160]  And we have to get out of this tribal mode of, yeah, we're killing that enemy over there that's brown and realize, no, it's a scientific tyranny that's doing it to all of us together.
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:26.160]  And as long as we play along with the game of this tribalism, the globalists are going to keep winning, we have to get the big picture.
[2:14:26.160 --> 2:14:29.160]  And I'm going to go over that after some more calls coming up.
[2:14:29.160 --> 2:14:32.160]  Let's talk to Lou in Illinois. Lou, you're on the air.
[2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:35.160]  Alex, thank you very much for taking my call today.
[2:14:35.160 --> 2:14:43.160]  I wanted to thank you for the vast amount of education that you're putting out there about this.
[2:14:43.160 --> 2:14:54.160]  And I'm doing, I finally got the guts up today to sign up for the TV thing and I just signed up and I'm really happy with it.
[2:14:54.160 --> 2:15:04.160]  And the vast amount of information on there, whether it's books, videos, articles, the things that you can learn on there are just amazing.
[2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:07.160]  I can't wait to just go in there and dedicate, you know...
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:15.160]  Well, let me be clear, we would give PrisonPlanet.tv out for free, but just the bandwidth of all the sites, everything's over 20 grand a month in IT.
[2:15:15.160 --> 2:15:20.160]  It's a total of 30 with all the T1 lines and all that.
[2:15:20.160 --> 2:15:26.160]  So we spend all our time just trying to even have the money to pay for all this when I'd rather spend it on news and information.
[2:15:26.160 --> 2:15:30.160]  But that's how the world works. I'm not complaining. It just holds us back.
[2:15:30.160 --> 2:15:33.160]  That's why we had the money bombs. We'd have to worry so much about this for another year.
[2:15:33.160 --> 2:15:35.160]  You know, it supplements what we're doing.
[2:15:35.160 --> 2:15:38.160]  But that barely pays for the bandwidth alone.
[2:15:38.160 --> 2:15:41.160]  And so, yes, PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[2:15:41.160 --> 2:15:48.160]  But more importantly, the films are all in high quality, so you can burn them to disk, to CD, very easy point and click tools.
[2:15:48.160 --> 2:15:57.160]  It's an arsenal, an armory of info weapons, you know, basically grenades in the Info War to go in there, burn all the films to disk,
[2:15:57.160 --> 2:16:07.160]  give them to people, most new DVD players, you know, have the different systems where they can play these that are burned, DivX and other things.
[2:16:07.160 --> 2:16:12.160]  So, yes, thank you, PrisonPlanet.tv. Go ahead.
[2:16:12.160 --> 2:16:20.160]  Yes, and, you know, what I'm doing is, and one of the things I've learned from you, and what your message was, and what I believe your message was,
[2:16:20.160 --> 2:16:25.160]  was to inform people, inform your friends, your neighbors.
[2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:31.160]  And I want to go about it in a way that I don't represent this like I'm a moron.
[2:16:31.160 --> 2:16:34.160]  And so, what I'm doing is, is I'm studying hard at it.
[2:16:34.160 --> 2:16:40.160]  And my best friend is a Northwestern law graduate, while she's just getting her degree now.
[2:16:40.160 --> 2:16:42.160]  She, this girl, is a genius.
[2:16:42.160 --> 2:16:46.160]  And I was talking to her about it, and I'm not as well educated.
[2:16:46.160 --> 2:16:49.160]  You know, when I started talking to her, I said, you have to hear this guy.
[2:16:49.160 --> 2:16:51.160]  She heard you, and she just flipped out.
[2:16:51.160 --> 2:16:54.160]  She's like, this guy really is smart.
[2:16:54.160 --> 2:17:01.160]  And now she's telling all her friends at Northwestern, you know, and it's kind of spread a little wildfire amongst her friends.
[2:17:01.160 --> 2:17:04.160]  And, you know, I just, I can't thank you enough.
[2:17:04.160 --> 2:17:11.160]  I really idolize what you're doing, and, you know, it's given me a direction in my life as far as, you know...
[2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:13.160]  Well, let me just say this, my friend.
[2:17:13.160 --> 2:17:16.160]  I mean, go ahead and finish, but don't idolize me.
[2:17:16.160 --> 2:17:18.160]  Idolize the successes I've had.
[2:17:18.160 --> 2:17:21.160]  Also, learn from the mistakes I've made.
[2:17:21.160 --> 2:17:23.160]  That's why parents try to teach their kids something they've learned.
[2:17:23.160 --> 2:17:25.160]  It's not that they're high and mighty.
[2:17:25.160 --> 2:17:26.160]  They've been around longer.
[2:17:26.160 --> 2:17:27.160]  They've got the scars to prove it.
[2:17:27.160 --> 2:17:32.160]  They're trying to pass on by warning the children instead of them having to experience themselves.
[2:17:32.160 --> 2:17:36.160]  But when people think I'm so smart, I'm reading the globalist-owned documents.
[2:17:36.160 --> 2:17:38.160]  I source them on air.
[2:17:38.160 --> 2:17:41.160]  These arrogant people brag how they manipulate us.
[2:17:41.160 --> 2:17:47.160]  I'm like just giving you a TV guide report of what they say they're going to do.
[2:17:47.160 --> 2:17:51.160]  That's what's so outrageous about all this, but go ahead.
[2:17:51.160 --> 2:17:56.160]  Yes, and the last thing is that I have friends of mine that are Polish-designed.
[2:17:56.160 --> 2:17:58.160]  They're new to this country.
[2:17:58.160 --> 2:18:00.160]  They're, you know, they want to be good Americans.
[2:18:00.160 --> 2:18:05.160]  And when you go and you start talking this stuff to people, they either think you're nuts
[2:18:05.160 --> 2:18:07.160]  or they cannot understand it.
[2:18:07.160 --> 2:18:10.160]  And so I don't know, you know, if this has been said before.
[2:18:10.160 --> 2:18:11.160]  No, no, no.
[2:18:11.160 --> 2:18:13.160]  I'll tell you why the poll, I mean, I mean, make your point.
[2:18:13.160 --> 2:18:15.160]  I'm going to tell you what's going on with the polls, but go ahead.
[2:18:15.160 --> 2:18:16.160]  Yeah.
[2:18:16.160 --> 2:18:20.160]  A guide for, you know, info war for dummies.
[2:18:20.160 --> 2:18:27.160]  If it could be simplified, broken down and give us maybe someone to write, help write
[2:18:27.160 --> 2:18:33.160]  and give people like me direction of how to get out there, how to go door to door in
[2:18:33.160 --> 2:18:39.160]  my free time and spread this information and, you know, get it going and get off our butts.
[2:18:39.160 --> 2:18:42.160]  We can sit here and we can say, yeah, I listened to Alex Jones.
[2:18:42.160 --> 2:18:47.160]  I know what's going on, but the doing of it, getting out there and doing it and informing
[2:18:47.160 --> 2:18:48.160]  these people.
[2:18:48.160 --> 2:18:49.160]  No, I agree.
[2:18:49.160 --> 2:18:50.160]  I agree.
[2:18:50.160 --> 2:18:51.160]  But I mean, but I mean, don't wait to inform people.
[2:18:51.160 --> 2:18:53.160]  You don't have to have some perfect handbook or have all the answers.
[2:18:53.160 --> 2:18:57.160]  It's almost better for you not to follow a handbook because then the enemy can attack
[2:18:57.160 --> 2:18:58.160]  a handbook.
[2:18:58.160 --> 2:19:02.160]  If our attack profile in the info war is a unified direct, it needs to be truly organic,
[2:19:02.160 --> 2:19:03.160]  truly real.
[2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:04.160]  But I appreciate your call.
[2:19:04.160 --> 2:19:07.160]  Let me explain what's happening with the polls.
[2:19:07.160 --> 2:19:12.160]  This is why the globalist love engineered crises that El Castro is bad.
[2:19:12.160 --> 2:19:15.160]  Clearly he's a thug attire.
[2:19:15.160 --> 2:19:20.160]  So what they do is they get the right wing Cubans to murder, steal, deal drugs, commit
[2:19:20.160 --> 2:19:25.160]  assassinations, do anything because it's for a good cause fighting that communist.
[2:19:25.160 --> 2:19:29.160]  But then they turn into what they're fighting or worse.
[2:19:29.160 --> 2:19:31.160]  And it's the same thing with the polls.
[2:19:31.160 --> 2:19:35.160]  They had the communist attacking them, butchering them, slaughtering them, killing their families.
[2:19:35.160 --> 2:19:36.160]  They fought back.
[2:19:36.160 --> 2:19:37.160]  They win.
[2:19:37.160 --> 2:19:38.160]  They won.
[2:19:38.160 --> 2:19:42.160]  They see the Americans as the good guys who helped them.
[2:19:42.160 --> 2:19:48.160]  And so now they can't imagine 20, 30 years later that the United States is bad.
[2:19:48.160 --> 2:19:52.160]  They don't understand there's a group above Russia and the United States that was playing
[2:19:52.160 --> 2:19:54.160]  out a master chess game on record.
[2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:55.160]  This is all admitted.
[2:19:55.160 --> 2:20:00.160]  So I'll explain that when we get back.
[2:20:00.160 --> 2:20:03.160]  This is Alex Jones for American tax settlement.
[2:20:03.160 --> 2:20:07.160]  We have received news the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes
[2:20:07.160 --> 2:20:12.160]  and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[2:20:12.160 --> 2:20:17.160]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created
[2:20:17.160 --> 2:20:22.160]  an open phone line with American tax settlement for all Alex Jones listeners to see if you
[2:20:22.160 --> 2:20:25.160]  qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands.
[2:20:25.160 --> 2:20:29.160]  The number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:34.160]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.
[2:20:34.160 --> 2:20:39.160]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property.
[2:20:39.160 --> 2:20:44.160]  American tax settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf.
[2:20:44.160 --> 2:20:48.160]  Keeping the IRS off your back and saving consumers millions of dollars.
[2:20:48.160 --> 2:20:56.160]  If you owe $10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[2:20:56.160 --> 2:20:59.160]  That's 1-800-506-5904.
[2:20:59.160 --> 2:21:01.160]  Call today.
[2:21:01.160 --> 2:21:07.160]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[2:21:07.160 --> 2:21:13.160]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[2:21:13.160 --> 2:21:19.160]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[2:21:19.160 --> 2:21:21.160]  Well, Obama's already fucking.
[2:21:21.160 --> 2:21:24.160]  Yeah, but since day one in this election.
[2:21:24.160 --> 2:21:28.160]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement, a personality cultist,
[2:21:28.160 --> 2:21:37.160]  who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[2:21:37.160 --> 2:21:40.160]  It's not about left or right. It's about a one-world government.
[2:21:40.160 --> 2:21:47.160]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[2:21:47.160 --> 2:21:52.160]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com,

[2:21:55.160 --> 2:21:59.160]  The Obama deception. The people strike back.
[2:22:01.160 --> 2:22:03.160]  Hi, I'm John Swenson. It might as resources.
[2:22:03.160 --> 2:22:09.160]  800-686-2237, extension 128, and let's take in a brief mind movie.
[2:22:09.160 --> 2:22:15.160]  We're surrounded by gestures, members of the nation's largest clown club based in Washington, D.C.
[2:22:15.160 --> 2:22:21.160]  Fuzzy hair, baggy pants, big yellow shoes, and now offering financial assurances that all will be well.
[2:22:21.160 --> 2:22:25.160]  The stimulus package is working. A bailout is coming your way.
[2:22:25.160 --> 2:22:29.160]  And while we're flat broke, we're also told that we've stepped back away from the brink.
[2:22:29.160 --> 2:22:30.160]  Pardon me?
[2:22:30.160 --> 2:22:31.160]  Back to the real world.
[2:22:31.160 --> 2:22:35.160]  We know that we can rely on no one but ourselves to generate financial security.
[2:22:35.160 --> 2:22:38.160]  Protecting your assets is solely up to you.
[2:22:38.160 --> 2:22:40.160]  No one else is coming to the rescue.
[2:22:40.160 --> 2:22:48.160]  Please call me John Swenson 800-686-2237, extension 128 to discuss investing in precious metals, gold, and silver,
[2:22:48.160 --> 2:22:51.160]  with a 6,000 year track record of success and security.
[2:22:51.160 --> 2:22:59.160]  I'm John Swenson 800-686-2237, extension 128, and together we'll create a package that really works for you.
[2:23:00.160 --> 2:23:06.160]  You've probably heard about the incredible, powerful, and natural antioxidants found in red wine.
[2:23:06.160 --> 2:23:10.160]  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to drink a glass of wine each day.
[2:23:10.160 --> 2:23:14.160]  Now, you don't have to drink even a single drop, thanks to New Rev.
[2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:21.160]  New Rev is America's number one anti-aging supplement, thanks to its active ingredient, resveratrol.
[2:23:21.160 --> 2:23:27.160]  Resveratrol is the main nutrient found in red wine, and has been proven to help slow down the aging process.
[2:23:27.160 --> 2:23:33.160]  Help you lose weight, override an unhealthy lifestyle, boost your energy level, and so much more.
[2:23:33.160 --> 2:23:38.160]  New Rev has been the subject of some of the most exciting anti-aging research in decades,
[2:23:38.160 --> 2:23:41.160]  and has only recently become available in purified form.

[2:23:58.160 --> 2:24:03.160]  Improve your life today.
[2:24:29.160 --> 2:24:36.160]  So, they selectively show you a young woman gunned down.
[2:24:36.160 --> 2:24:41.160]  Now, the American people say, bomb Iran, kill them all.
[2:24:41.160 --> 2:24:46.160]  Blow up buildings full of women, just don't show them to us.
[2:24:46.160 --> 2:24:51.160]  It's a very, very sick selective propaganda, and it's all staged.
[2:24:51.160 --> 2:25:02.160]  And now, I want to go ahead and start getting into North Korea situation, and then back to your phone calls, and a ton of other news.
[2:25:02.160 --> 2:25:06.160]  So, let's go ahead and get into Korea.
[2:25:06.160 --> 2:25:17.160]  Notice how all of a sudden, Obama comes in, first trying to pass his gun ban bills, secret list for Americans, all protests of terrorism.
[2:25:17.160 --> 2:25:24.160]  We'll be covering that coming up.
[2:25:24.160 --> 2:25:30.160]  The bankers are openly stealing $14.8 trillion here alone and growing and counting.
[2:25:30.160 --> 2:25:34.160]  In Europe, setting up a dictatorship of foreign offshore banks.
[2:25:34.160 --> 2:25:43.160]  All of this is happening, and meanwhile, suddenly, right when Kim Jong-il is sick and dying of cancer and says he may only have a few months left,
[2:25:43.160 --> 2:25:50.160]  maybe something your old son's about to give him power, right when their regime is in flux, there's a power transfer.
[2:25:50.160 --> 2:25:54.160]  All the sanctions in North Korea make millions more of their own people die.
[2:25:54.160 --> 2:26:01.160]  That's propping up that regime by the outside oppression, props up the inside oppression.
[2:26:01.160 --> 2:26:04.160]  The two tyrannies prop each other up.
[2:26:04.160 --> 2:26:09.160]  It's how this dark logic, this dark, this dark mathematics of the new order works.
[2:26:09.160 --> 2:26:12.160]  They brag about it.
[2:26:12.160 --> 2:26:20.160]  On top of that, the United States, ABB, Swiss company, Donald Rumsfeld, chairman of the board, in the 90s, on record, mainstream news,
[2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:24.160]  it's in my film, The Masters of Terror.
[2:26:24.160 --> 2:26:29.160]  We talk about why did they give nukes to Pakistan and North Korea,
[2:26:29.160 --> 2:26:35.160]  because later they're going to start wars with them as a way to encircle Russia and China and start a war with them.
[2:26:35.160 --> 2:26:38.160]  That's a film I made in 2002, and now it's happening.
[2:26:38.160 --> 2:26:44.160]  I mean, these people are playing 10, 20, 30-year plans, and they write books about it, bragging.
[2:26:44.160 --> 2:26:46.160]  This is not my opinion.
[2:26:46.160 --> 2:26:57.160]  The National Security Advisor for Obama was as big as Brzezinski's bragged in two books he's written on the subject, one on the grand chess board.
[2:26:57.160 --> 2:27:05.160]  So here it is, North Korea threatens to harm U.S. of attack, and they're saying they're going to start pulling over any North Korean ships coming out of the country,
[2:27:05.160 --> 2:27:12.160]  selling any components to any nation for food, for oil, for money, heating oil, grain, things like that.
[2:27:12.160 --> 2:27:14.160]  And North Korea is saying that's an act of war.
[2:27:14.160 --> 2:27:23.160]  And if you do that, we're going to fire a nuke at South Korea, at Hawaii, or at Japan, and they got Taipang-dong, too, missiles.
[2:27:23.160 --> 2:27:29.160]  Now, Kim Jong-il's dad, the first dictator, he died on July 4th.
[2:27:29.160 --> 2:27:31.160]  They always test missiles on July 4th.
[2:27:31.160 --> 2:27:35.160]  The media is saying they want to attack America on July 4th.
[2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:37.160]  That is not what these lunatics are doing.
[2:27:37.160 --> 2:27:46.160]  It's a cult all about the great leader, like he's a superhero, like they're now doing for Obama, or Hitler, Stalin, Iron, Stalin.
[2:27:46.160 --> 2:27:48.160]  Steel, Stalin.
[2:27:48.160 --> 2:27:51.160]  That's what Stalin means, a steel, the man of steel.
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:54.160]  So they love the same crud.
[2:27:54.160 --> 2:27:57.160]  So they take anything North Korea does and also exaggerate it.
[2:27:57.160 --> 2:28:05.160]  We're going to fire a missile, test missile into the Pacific, testing our range.
[2:28:05.160 --> 2:28:08.160]  And they say, oh, they're going to attack us on July 4th.
[2:28:08.160 --> 2:28:09.160]  So they also distort everything.
[2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:16.160]  But North Korea is officially coming out, have even tuned into their English transmission on the Internet to check it for myself.
[2:28:16.160 --> 2:28:21.160]  And boy, let me tell you, listen to North Korean radio is not fun, that they are threatening to nuke South Korea.
[2:28:21.160 --> 2:28:23.160]  They say, if you attack us, we'll attack you.
[2:28:23.160 --> 2:28:34.160]  And they're having all these drills the last few months in the buildup to this, massing troops on the North Korean border with South Korea and submarines and missile cruisers menacing North Korea.
[2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:42.160]  So they're trying to push the lunatics into firing and doing some provocation so we can be off to the races.
[2:28:42.160 --> 2:28:49.160]  As of a month ago, the armistice, the ceasefire, 50 plus years old is over.
[2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:51.160]  The state of war is back.
[2:28:51.160 --> 2:28:56.160]  North Korea reminded the U.S. on Monday that it has nuclear weapons and warned it will strike back and attack.
[2:28:56.160 --> 2:29:01.160]  As the U.S. destroyer continued to trail a North Korean cargo ship suspected of carrying illicit weapons.
[2:29:01.160 --> 2:29:06.160]  After the U.S., that is the people that run our country.
[2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:11.160]  The United States is a hooker being dragged by the hair by the pimp.
[2:29:11.160 --> 2:29:17.160]  So I don't want to say the United States, the people dragging us the hooker around by our hair.
[2:29:17.160 --> 2:29:18.160]  That's the New World Order.
[2:29:18.160 --> 2:29:23.160]  The New World Order is menacing and manipulating and armed North Korea to begin with.
[2:29:23.160 --> 2:29:29.160]  So I'll come back and finish up with this and then I'm going to give each story one minute.
[2:29:29.160 --> 2:29:30.160]  I'm going to blitz through nose.
[2:29:30.160 --> 2:29:31.160]  I'm just going to make myself.
[2:29:31.160 --> 2:29:32.160]  In fact, you guys time it.
[2:29:32.160 --> 2:29:34.160]  Make me stop each minute on each story.
[2:29:34.160 --> 2:29:36.160]  That's what I want to elaborate, elaborate.
[2:29:36.160 --> 2:29:41.160]  Like earlier how they announced Obama's volunteers, which will be force volunteers.
[2:29:41.160 --> 2:29:42.160]  That's what it's called.
[2:29:42.160 --> 2:29:44.160]  Well, we'll be watching you on the surveillance cameras.
[2:29:44.160 --> 2:29:47.160]  That's their job is watching communities and their felons.
[2:29:47.160 --> 2:29:49.160]  The New York Times says that's good though.
[2:29:49.160 --> 2:29:51.160]  You're not against giving a felon a job a second chance.
[2:29:51.160 --> 2:29:52.160]  We're on the march.
[2:29:52.160 --> 2:29:54.160]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:54.160 --> 2:29:58.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.160 --> 2:30:01.160]  This is Alex Jones.
[2:30:01.160 --> 2:30:03.160]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[2:30:03.160 --> 2:30:04.160]  Well, you should.
[2:30:04.160 --> 2:30:09.160]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[2:30:09.160 --> 2:30:10.160]  That's right.

[2:30:16.160 --> 2:30:19.160]  and secure a 30 state concealed weapons permit.
[2:30:19.160 --> 2:30:20.160]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[2:30:20.160 --> 2:30:27.160]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[2:30:27.160 --> 2:30:34.160]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[2:30:34.160 --> 2:30:40.160]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
