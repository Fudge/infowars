[00:00.000 --> 00:29.680]  25 days, ladies and gentlemen, 25 days to the midterms, and we know it was coming.
[00:29.680 --> 00:36.800]  I warned everyone over and over again that I was patient zero, the first domino to be
[00:36.800 --> 00:45.960]  totally de-platformed, and now, working in concert, Twitter and Facebook banned 800 major
[00:45.960 --> 00:53.360]  conservative Christian libertarian pro-life, pro-gun pages, some that had millions of
[00:53.360 --> 01:00.920]  followers apiece from major, major publications. Everybody from Press, from Truth, to Michelle
[01:00.920 --> 01:09.720]  Malkin's page, to you name it, 800 in one day banned, and you know what they said? They
[01:09.720 --> 01:17.720]  said, you are fake news. There's a Washington Post, Facebook purges over 800 US accounts
[01:17.720 --> 01:25.200]  and pages for pushing political spam, and then you read it's in the fake news category.
[01:25.200 --> 01:32.400]  So, it's, oh, now it's spam. Oh, no, it's called being popular, and it's called the
[01:32.400 --> 01:38.320]  Washington Post, who's all part of this cartel of mainstream media that goes around and judges
[01:38.320 --> 01:44.400]  what's fake news, what's spam, what's hate, and then now they're banned from being fake
[01:44.400 --> 01:50.800]  news and spam. They're banned because they're popular, and I'm going to explain when we
[01:50.800 --> 01:56.320]  come back how this works, but you have to understand, 15 years ago, 90 plus percent
[01:56.320 --> 02:02.160]  of the internet was not social media networks, it was individual sites, and a giant archipelago
[02:02.160 --> 02:08.120]  of millions and millions of popular sites. It was a vibrant internet, and Matt Rudd warned,
[02:08.120 --> 02:13.120]  he said, you're all giving all your traffic to these places, you're pushing your audiences
[02:13.120 --> 02:19.600]  to Facebook and Twitter, and these other globalist platforms, these gulags, these, the term he
[02:19.600 --> 02:28.200]  used was ghettos, digital ghettos, and in the last 15 years, it went from 90 plus percent
[02:28.200 --> 02:32.920]  being millions of individual sites that all got great traffic, and then billions of sites
[02:32.920 --> 02:43.040]  total to four sites that get 90 plus percent of the traffic, and of course radio shows,
[02:43.040 --> 02:46.640]  TV shows, everyone pushed their Facebook, everyone pushed their Twitter, everyone pushed
[02:46.640 --> 02:52.720]  their audience onto there and their content, and now the rugs being pulled out from under
[02:52.720 --> 02:58.920]  everybody. They're going, oh, we're, we're our own companies, we're our own sites, but
[02:58.920 --> 03:05.680]  then they fight to shut down gab.com and info wars.com, and the Democrats have Federal
[03:05.680 --> 03:12.040]  Elections Commission meetings and say, we want Matt Rudd shut down. Oh, we want the payment
[03:12.040 --> 03:24.880]  processors as Alex Jones taken. Horse Congress, 800, and you, you added up its tens upon tens
[03:24.880 --> 03:30.640]  of millions of followers that went and subscribed, that gave their content on those conservative
[03:30.640 --> 03:38.960]  and nationalist and patriot sites, and they're all gone, all gone, not one strike, not two
[03:38.960 --> 03:42.880]  strikes, not three strikes, like they used to have, oh, so-called rules, they were still
[03:42.880 --> 03:50.240]  arbitrary and run by SJWs. No, ladies and gentlemen, they're just gone, including real
[03:50.240 --> 03:56.440]  liberal sites. I would call Dan Dix a liberal, liberal libertarian, socially liberal, but
[03:56.440 --> 04:01.600]  a smart guy, filmmaker. He had 300,000 followers, very popular filmmaker, gone, because they
[04:01.600 --> 04:07.880]  don't want real liberals around making other liberals look stupid, who are fake liberals,
[04:07.880 --> 04:13.920]  so they're gone, and oh, don't worry, the Los Angeles Times and everyone else, they're
[04:13.920 --> 04:18.840]  all just celebrating. Now, people like Dan Dix and others were smart, they had backup
[04:18.840 --> 04:25.080]  accounts, but see, oh, they'll get to those, they'll get to those. Now, that's big news,
[04:25.080 --> 04:34.840]  and it's coming up, the amazing Kanye West event, the total racism of an all-white panel
[04:34.840 --> 04:41.000]  talking about how Kanye West is a dumb, you know, and then other panels saying things
[04:41.000 --> 04:44.280]  I won't even really repeat or they'll edit it and say I said it. I mean, you talk about
[04:44.280 --> 04:53.760]  real KKK type caricatures and stereotypes, it is disgusting, but I'm very proud of Mr.
[04:53.760 --> 05:00.720]  Brown and Mr. West. I'm very proud of Mr. Trump. I'm very proud of all of you.
[05:00.720 --> 05:05.880]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now. Info
[05:05.880 --> 05:10.320]  Awards is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt
[05:10.320 --> 05:15.080]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate. People say, why would you start
[05:15.080 --> 05:19.840]  a fight with them? Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground,
[05:19.840 --> 05:24.760]  and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this. So we've already had incredible success,
[05:24.760 --> 05:29.680]  but if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[05:29.680 --> 05:34.520]  why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us and if you spread
[05:34.520 --> 05:40.240]  the word about our articles and videos, infowords.com, we won't just continue to stand up against
[05:40.240 --> 05:45.720]  these brutal scum bags, we'll win. We have huge sales at infowords.com right now, and
[05:45.720 --> 05:49.720]  we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite
[05:49.720 --> 05:53.520]  the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market. But if you
[05:53.520 --> 05:56.960]  don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and the globe will spring with. This
[05:56.960 --> 06:05.000]  is InfoWars Darker Sour. We need your support. I'm counting on you.
[06:05.000 --> 06:14.080]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[06:14.080 --> 06:28.480]  you are the resistance. From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting
[06:28.480 --> 06:35.480]  worldwide its Alex Jones.
[06:35.480 --> 06:45.080]  I'm scared to not wear this hat, my own friends, but this hat, it gives me power in a way. You
[06:45.080 --> 06:52.600]  know, my dad and my mom separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home. And
[06:52.600 --> 07:00.720]  also, I'm married to a family that, you know, not a lot of male energy going on. It's beautiful
[07:00.720 --> 07:06.440]  though, but there's times where, you know, it's something about, you know, I love Hillary,
[07:06.440 --> 07:12.320]  I love everyone, right? But the campaign I'm with her just didn't make me feel as a guy
[07:12.320 --> 07:17.600]  that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his
[07:17.600 --> 07:22.720]  son. It was something about when I put this hat on, it made me feel like Superman. You
[07:22.720 --> 07:27.840]  made a Superman. That's my favorite superhero. And you made a Superman cake for me. Oh, I
[07:27.840 --> 07:28.840]  love you.
[07:28.840 --> 07:29.840]  I know.
[07:29.840 --> 07:31.840]  But I don't want to take, I don't want to put you in that spot.
[07:31.840 --> 07:38.600]  No, I'm standing in that spot. I love this guy right here. Let me get this guy.
[07:38.600 --> 07:40.600]  I love this guy right here.
[07:40.600 --> 07:46.600]  That's really nice. And that's from the heart. I didn't want to put you in that position.
[07:46.600 --> 07:53.600]  But that's from the heart.
[07:53.600 --> 07:59.680]  It is Friday, the 12th day of October, 2018. I am your host, Alex Jones. We're going to
[07:59.680 --> 08:04.520]  be here for the next four hours in the war rooms coming up. And I intend to open the
[08:04.520 --> 08:13.320]  phones up and take your phone calls throughout the entire transmission today to put it lightly.
[08:13.320 --> 08:19.800]  The confirmation that the globalists are as evil as we thought they were, in fact, they're
[08:19.800 --> 08:28.640]  worse than we thought they were. And they're completely taking up the mask off is a spiritual
[08:28.640 --> 08:40.560]  and cultural temper tantrum. It's like a demon being exercised out of the body. And when
[08:40.560 --> 08:45.800]  you look at the behavior of Soros and Hillary and all of these demonic entities, that's
[08:45.800 --> 08:56.160]  what they are, literally, you are witnessing their death rows politically and spiritually.
[08:56.160 --> 09:02.600]  And we've got clips dealing with Kanye today that are so insane that I don't have words
[09:02.600 --> 09:07.600]  to describe it. The hit and run individual who's allowed to hit and run in public while
[09:07.600 --> 09:14.480]  he's drunk driving, Chris Cuomo of CNN with no viewers, he came out and said, we're going
[09:14.480 --> 09:21.880]  to play the clip coming up. Trump looked like he was thinking racist thoughts. So they're
[09:21.880 --> 09:34.600]  projecting that out there now on the weak-minded. Other hosts said that Kanye West was a black
[09:34.600 --> 09:44.720]  ventriloquist dummy doll and that Trump basically was telling him what to say and that Kanye
[09:44.720 --> 09:53.920]  West is a black ventriloquist doll for white supremacy. That's right. A bunch of successful
[09:53.920 --> 10:01.680]  men who built their own incredible careers are there hugging on each other and meeting
[10:01.680 --> 10:08.200]  Mr. Brown, Mr. West, Mr. Trump. They're all there meeting, talking about how they want
[10:08.200 --> 10:16.440]  to bring America and the world together and how they want to invest in the black community
[10:16.440 --> 10:22.600]  particularly and to try to get fathers back in the homes and try to have male energy infused
[10:22.600 --> 10:27.240]  back in because what the globalists are doing is removing male energy so that they can lead
[10:27.240 --> 10:31.160]  and control everyone. They're breaking the human cycle. They're not trying to put feminine
[10:31.160 --> 10:36.640]  energy in charge. They're trying to have corporate energy in control with divided slaves. That's
[10:36.640 --> 10:42.680]  in their WikiLeaks. It's in their own documents. And Kanye West is bringing a message of truth,
[10:42.680 --> 10:51.600]  a message of courage and he pointed out that Trump is on a hero's quest and walking the
[10:51.600 --> 10:59.840]  walk of a hero and that's what's happening here and the evil does not know what to do
[10:59.840 --> 11:07.560]  and so what does Don Lemon and all the other hosts say? They say, poor Kanye, he is like
[11:07.560 --> 11:14.880]  a black minstrel actor, minstrel shows where they would make fun of black people and others
[11:14.880 --> 11:24.160]  and that he is, these are all quotes, that he is an uneducated dumb Negro that doesn't
[11:24.160 --> 11:30.400]  read. I mean, this is the most stereotypical racist horrible crap and then they edit what
[11:30.400 --> 11:36.560]  he says out of context so it doesn't make sense and they sit back and say, look at the
[11:36.560 --> 11:44.600]  dumb black man who's self-made and who has courage because the truth is, if anybody is
[11:44.600 --> 11:53.240]  a house slave, it's Don Lemon. He's a house slave of Hillary Clinton and you can be black,
[11:53.240 --> 12:00.720]  you can be white, you can be brown, you can be yellow, you can be pink, you can be lying
[12:00.720 --> 12:07.720]  on a morgue slab and be purple or blue, but if you serve the globalists, you are a slave.
[12:07.720 --> 12:14.720]  See, slavery isn't about a skin color, it's about a position you're in and a lot of slaves
[12:14.720 --> 12:26.160]  are slaves willingly, like the soy boy, Don Lemon, the race pimp, Don Lemon, following
[12:26.160 --> 12:31.320]  the sick script so I'm going to play all those clips when we come back and I'm going
[12:31.320 --> 12:35.880]  to play Mr. Brown's great speech from C-SPAN and I'm going to get to a lot more coming
[12:35.880 --> 12:40.760]  up and I'm going to take your calls throughout the broadcast but here's the big news after
[12:40.760 --> 12:50.880]  the next segment at the bottom of the hour. This is the Washington Post. Facebook purges
[12:50.880 --> 12:56.480]  over 800 U.S. accounts and pages for pushing political spam and that's not counting Twitter.
[12:56.480 --> 13:02.720]  The big news here is that the numbers are coming out, it's worth 800. They did it in
[13:02.720 --> 13:15.600]  the exact concert in the same hour as Twitter and what did the good folks over at Buzzkill
[13:15.600 --> 13:21.200]  say, Buzzfeed, fake news kings, but they also do get the inside baseball. Oh, remember about
[13:21.200 --> 13:27.240]  them six weeks ago? Oh, Facebook and Twitter and Google, they all met in secret to decide
[13:27.240 --> 13:31.840]  how to run the midterms. They even said how to respond to it and you're seeing and I predicted
[13:31.840 --> 13:37.720]  that right up to the election they would end up banning every libertarian Christian conservative
[13:37.720 --> 13:45.600]  site off these platforms and they've now done it and it's going to get worse. Oh, and now
[13:45.600 --> 13:49.280]  governments around the country, Democrat run cities, they want to know if you're a Christian
[13:49.280 --> 13:53.240]  or a conservative and they make you declare it on forms if you've ever been involved or
[13:53.240 --> 13:58.760]  a member of the NRA and they're saying we're not going to give you government contracts
[13:58.760 --> 14:08.720]  for cement or paper or food programs for anything if you are a conservative, if you are a gun
[14:08.720 --> 14:14.440]  supporter, you hurt me and why not? They're getting away with it. They got away with banning
[14:14.440 --> 14:18.280]  me. I told everybody they're like, how are you taking it? Well, I'm taking it really
[14:18.280 --> 14:21.440]  bad because it means they're going to go after everybody and they're going to try to steal
[14:21.440 --> 14:24.640]  the election and then they're going to go after what we say on the street and where
[14:24.640 --> 14:29.600]  we work and what religion we are. This is real authoritarianism. Oh, come on, Alex.
[14:29.600 --> 14:34.520]  You know, they say you're fake news. No, they're the fake news. They put out lies about me
[14:34.520 --> 14:39.800]  to set the precedent so Congress would sit there on their butts when this happened and
[14:39.800 --> 14:43.480]  the Pentagon knows what's going on. Trump knows what's going on. Be surrounded by a bunch
[14:43.480 --> 14:51.480]  of addled yes men who are all in the bank role, the payroll of these big tech companies.
[14:51.480 --> 14:56.680]  They buy them cheap senators. You know, Google might give $50,000 to each senator they own
[14:56.680 --> 15:03.920]  a year. Nothing. These are trillion dollar companies. They bought us up like a cheap
[15:03.920 --> 15:11.720]  whore, a $5 hooker. Now they put the cigarettes out on us and now they're slicing us up and
[15:11.720 --> 15:18.040]  we're so broke back. We're laying there in the bed while they beat us with a coat hanger
[15:18.040 --> 15:24.160]  and they knock our damn teeth out. So don't go along with this anymore. You've got a birthright.
[15:24.160 --> 15:29.600]  I told you it's not about me. I told you they were coming for you and they are. They're
[15:29.600 --> 15:33.720]  coming for talk radio. They're coming for your children. They want it all because they
[15:33.720 --> 15:39.640]  crave it. And if you roll over to this group of psychos, you deserve what you get. They're
[15:39.640 --> 15:45.760]  a gang of crooks that hadn't been put in their place. They're a bunch of knuckle dragon trash
[15:45.760 --> 15:49.960]  like Hillary and Soros that have gotten away with all sorts of crimes and they think they're
[15:49.960 --> 15:55.760]  invincible. Well, they're not invincible and God is going to smash them into the ground
[15:55.760 --> 16:00.000]  and destroy them.
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.880]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked
[16:04.880 --> 16:09.440]  the place and what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[18:00.360 --> 18:05.680]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing PollenBlock.
[18:05.680 --> 18:11.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:11.000 --> 18:17.720]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.720 --> 18:23.600]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.600 --> 18:28.960]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[18:28.960 --> 18:34.360]  trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable
[18:34.360 --> 18:40.080]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. PollenBlock is natural and effective.
[18:40.080 --> 18:45.120]  It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by
[18:45.120 --> 18:50.400]  blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[18:50.400 --> 18:56.720]  responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com
[18:56.720 --> 18:59.640]  and grab a pack of our PollenBlock chewable tablets.
[18:59.640 --> 19:04.640]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[19:04.640 --> 19:09.320]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dogs for a walk. Believe me,
[19:09.320 --> 19:14.000]  I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every
[19:14.000 --> 19:20.840]  day, but thanks to SupermailVitality at infowarsstore.com, I still have that energy. There's no way
[19:20.840 --> 19:25.120]  I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals and
[19:25.120 --> 19:29.360]  the food and water to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time
[19:29.360 --> 19:34.960]  and the extended hours to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to
[19:34.960 --> 19:40.720]  the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[19:40.720 --> 19:46.000]  So go to infowarsstore.com and get SupermailVitality before it's gone. This is actually our last

[20:03.600 --> 20:21.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:21.880 --> 20:41.600]  I want to say something here. I want to be infinity clear. This country and this world
[20:41.600 --> 20:46.720]  is in a battle between good and evil. You got to choose the side. And evil is going
[20:46.720 --> 20:54.000]  into overdrive because it senses and is witnessing a global awakening. And it is critical that
[20:54.000 --> 20:59.680]  everybody be as active and focused as you can politically, spiritually, economically
[20:59.680 --> 21:05.920]  in the fight for freedom. Now is the time for peaceful, focused action. And if we do our
[21:05.920 --> 21:14.160]  part, God will deliver vengeance. Not us. We are not offensively going to do anything
[21:14.160 --> 21:20.680]  wrong. But we are going to defend ourselves. And if they want a war, they're going to get
[21:20.680 --> 21:28.440]  one. But we are destroying them in the information war. We are annihilating them and making them
[21:28.440 --> 21:36.560]  bring out open censorship up front with 800 plus major sites banned at the same time off
[21:36.560 --> 21:43.400]  Twitter and Facebook in the same hour. Total criminal coordination. And they didn't even
[21:43.400 --> 21:50.280]  say you broke rules or strikes. They said we consider your news to be conservative spam.
[21:50.280 --> 21:57.040]  Trash. Unwanted garbage. A total inversion. These are popular sites with millions of followers
[21:57.040 --> 22:01.920]  and hundreds of thousands of followers apiece from respected conservative and libertarian
[22:01.920 --> 22:10.720]  and nationalist groups. And they're all gone. And that's so these monsters at CNN and MSNBC
[22:10.720 --> 22:18.000]  can say that Kanye West is like a minstrel actor. A white person in blackface making
[22:18.000 --> 22:24.720]  fun of black people. And that he is a dumb Negro. This is what they're saying, not me.
[22:24.720 --> 22:31.920]  They'll probably edit and put this out. And that he's a puppet of Trump, a racist ventriloquist
[22:31.920 --> 22:40.960]  doll. I have all these clips. This is sick. This is Trump trying to have love and Kanye
[22:40.960 --> 22:46.520]  trying to have love and Mr. Brown trying to have love. And the establishment responds
[22:46.520 --> 22:54.520]  with the most sickening. There's articles on infowars.com that are in credible. Steve
[22:54.520 --> 22:58.800]  Watson has one that had so many examples this morning, even though I didn't have time to
[22:58.800 --> 23:04.920]  spend 45 minutes on one article. I got up at 5am. I did. I spent 45 minutes on this
[23:04.920 --> 23:10.400]  one article because there's dozens of tweets, seven or eight videos of the people saying
[23:10.400 --> 23:19.840]  the most horrible, nasty, racist crap I have ever heard in America. I mean, this is the
[23:19.840 --> 23:30.240]  stuff that you would hear out of the mouths of toothless KKK members. I mean, the worst.
[23:30.240 --> 23:34.920]  But this is why they're so scared of this country coming back. And that's coming together.
[23:34.920 --> 23:41.680]  And Mr. Brown and Mr. West and Mr. Trump seriously working out plans and delivering
[23:41.680 --> 23:47.000]  massive factories and jobs and startups to black inner city areas and trying to develop
[23:47.000 --> 23:51.440]  plans to bring fathers back in the home and reverse the collapse of the black family,
[23:51.440 --> 23:55.800]  which is the opening salvo of taking all our families down and it's admitted and they're
[23:55.800 --> 24:03.280]  doing it. Male energy. Jim Brown has spent since he retired, whatever, 40 years ago
[24:03.280 --> 24:09.480]  on the greatest players ever. But he's really played on the field of life. Spending his
[24:09.480 --> 24:15.920]  time, his money actually trying to help youth and trying to get fathers and people's lives.
[24:15.920 --> 24:21.200]  And there he is again, doing it. And they call them all these horrible names and stupid
[24:21.200 --> 24:31.320]  and dumb and oh, a woman wants claim. He did something to her. Give me a break. It's unbelievable.
[24:31.320 --> 24:36.000]  For all the Democrats money and all their propaganda, all their foreign funding, $38
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.880]  million raised the last three months for beta who can hardly talk. He's another guy with
[24:40.880 --> 24:45.520]  a hit and run record, but that's okay. He's a Democrat raises 38 million. He wants to
[24:45.520 --> 24:51.120]  ban all assault rifles, all semi-autos in Texas. They're calling him the new Obama. They're
[24:51.120 --> 24:57.240]  hoping all this insane celebrity. Oh, worshiping beat. Oh, he'll remove Ted Cruz. Everyone
[24:57.240 --> 25:04.800]  in Texas better vote. And I'm not saying do what the Democrats do. Look at the obituary
[25:04.800 --> 25:10.280]  and find somebody that died and going there and vote in their name. Plus in Texas, we
[25:10.280 --> 25:19.000]  have ID. Oh, so that hadn't worked that way. See how that works. Unbelievable. So let's
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.920]  start getting to some of these clips. What's, which one should we play first? Let's play
[25:25.920 --> 25:30.680]  the clip where they talk about, I mean, I can't even hardly get to these clips. Maybe
[25:30.680 --> 25:34.840]  I shouldn't even play this. Let's play the one where they talk about this is what happened
[25:34.840 --> 25:40.920]  when Negroes don't, which, which are the left, they've made that word Anglo Negro. It just
[25:40.920 --> 25:44.480]  means like Negro and Spanish or Latin. It just means, you know, like you get the Mexican
[25:44.480 --> 25:48.320]  beer, this dark. It's I want the Negro. I want the blonde. That's all that means. But
[25:48.320 --> 25:53.920]  the media has turned the word Negro into the N word. And so they know what they're doing
[25:53.920 --> 25:58.520]  when they use it. I don't use it because a lot of ignorant people, especially ignorant
[25:58.520 --> 26:10.520]  white people think it's the N word. So let's go to that clip. Here it is. Kanye West is
[26:10.520 --> 26:15.480]  what happens when Negroes don't read. And we have this now. And now Donald Trump is
[26:15.480 --> 26:18.760]  going to use it and perverted. And he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and
[26:18.760 --> 26:28.400]  take pictures. Just look at that. Scott. Listen, black folks are about to trade Kanye
[26:28.400 --> 26:33.320]  West in the racial draft. Okay. They've had it with him. And he's an attention whore like
[26:33.320 --> 26:38.920]  the president. He's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson. He's he's the token Negro
[26:38.920 --> 26:43.880]  of the of the Trump administration. This is ridiculous. And no one should be taking Kanye
[26:43.880 --> 26:49.040]  West seriously. He's clearly has issues. He's already been hospitalized. He's already been
[26:49.040 --> 26:56.360]  hospitalized hospitalized. This is white supremacy by ventriloquism. A black mouth is moving.
[26:56.360 --> 27:02.160]  But white racist ideals are flowing from Kanye West's mouth. Kanye West is engaging in one
[27:02.160 --> 27:09.960]  of the most nefarious practices yet a black body and brain are the warehouse for the articulation
[27:09.960 --> 27:15.800]  and expression of anti black sentiments that have been chinshacked by people with far more
[27:15.800 --> 27:21.320]  rigorous credentials. I mean, these are race players who thinks that only white people
[27:21.320 --> 27:28.320]  can be racist. But it's beyond race. It's manipulation of people to keep us divided.
[27:28.320 --> 27:32.840]  And that's what these monsters. We have the memos from the last election where they said
[27:32.840 --> 27:39.840]  go out and racially divide top psychological warfare professors. Psychiatrist are who are
[27:39.840 --> 27:44.600]  who are on the Hillary campaign. The highest levels are telling her this is what you've
[27:44.600 --> 27:52.840]  got to do. Expand the culture wars. That means women against men, men against women, black
[27:52.840 --> 27:56.440]  against white and everything they're doing. By the way, I said I'd announced this last
[27:56.440 --> 28:01.800]  night and I didn't remind me at the end of the hour to do it guys. We like a whiteboard
[28:01.800 --> 28:08.040]  in here or something. So I don't forget. I didn't tell you the rest of the story. The
[28:08.040 --> 28:11.560]  other day I got so excited when I was breaking down that it's confirmed Hillary will be given
[28:11.560 --> 28:21.960]  the nomination like she was three years ago. So it's it's it's it's simply absolutely
[28:21.960 --> 28:26.640]  mind blowing that all of this is happening and unfolding and it's going to get worse.
[28:26.640 --> 28:34.680]  Now coming up, we have Cuomo saying stuff even worse that Trump was secretly thinking
[28:34.680 --> 28:41.000]  racist thoughts while he was looking at Jim Brown and looking at Kanye West and saying
[28:41.000 --> 28:47.960]  what a special, wonderful, courageous people they are for the courage they have. So this
[28:47.960 --> 28:53.320]  is the level of deception in fake news. It's not even fake news. It's just raw base mindless
[28:53.320 --> 28:59.400]  propaganda that's meant to hype up their base to be violent.

[30:31.080 --> 30:36.200]  go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[30:36.200 --> 30:42.040]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[30:42.040 --> 30:47.560]  So now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos,
[30:47.560 --> 30:50.880]  to tell people about the local stations you're listening to, but the bare minimum you can
[30:50.880 --> 30:58.440]  do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter. We are the Renaissance
[30:58.440 --> 31:03.200]  and we are winning. We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together
[31:03.200 --> 31:08.560]  with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave
[31:08.560 --> 31:13.240]  us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[31:13.240 --> 31:18.680]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known
[31:18.680 --> 31:22.840]  compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it
[31:22.840 --> 31:28.280]  supports the info war. It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally
[31:28.280 --> 31:32.880]  have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[31:32.880 --> 31:37.040]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to
[31:37.040 --> 31:41.760]  your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay
[31:41.760 --> 31:47.400]  as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant
[31:47.400 --> 31:51.960]  of America to reignite those brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused
[31:51.960 --> 31:55.920]  as you can be thanks to your support and your prayers together. We're changing the world.
[31:55.920 --> 32:00.280]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and infowarslife.com.
[32:00.280 --> 32:05.400]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found
[32:05.400 --> 32:10.480]  here in Lailania states but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need
[32:10.480 --> 32:17.080]  to be concerned about ash and acid rain. Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[32:17.080 --> 32:22.360]  and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed
[32:22.360 --> 32:28.640]  a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was
[32:28.640 --> 32:34.160]  in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater. Next, we tested
[32:34.160 --> 32:39.240]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within
[32:39.240 --> 32:46.040]  safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter
[32:46.040 --> 32:51.680]  on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water. So what we've learned is that volcanic ash
[32:51.680 --> 32:57.120]  and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water
[32:57.120 --> 33:03.600]  filtration system will purify it.
[33:03.600 --> 33:16.840]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:16.840 --> 33:23.880]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex
[33:23.880 --> 33:36.800]  Jones show 25 days out and Facebook and Twitter and others have gotten even more bold than
[33:36.800 --> 33:41.880]  I thought they would in censorship. I predicted that as we got close to the election a year
[33:41.880 --> 33:47.720]  ago that you would see these purges and now you've seen it. 800 just on Facebook. So when
[33:47.720 --> 33:52.640]  I said earlier 800, excuse me, numbers are now coming out as more groups announced they've
[33:52.640 --> 34:01.800]  been banned. It looks like it's about 1600 major major conservative libertarian Christian
[34:01.800 --> 34:11.040]  pro-gun pro-veteran pro-life just just like Project Veritas got documents last year and
[34:11.040 --> 34:15.880]  got video. They said what are you ban? They said anything else shows. He's our main enemy.
[34:15.880 --> 34:25.760]  But what else? Well, American flags and veterans and scum. I have talked to over the years
[34:25.760 --> 34:29.760]  secret service that told us Hillary was collapsing and I said a month before she collapsed that
[34:29.760 --> 34:32.800]  she was collapsing and having seizures all the time and that we should follow her because
[34:32.800 --> 34:36.480]  we'd catch her falling down and indeed Millie Weaver caught her falling down behind a tent
[34:36.480 --> 34:40.240]  for an hour and a half. Then two weeks later she collapsed. So my point is these are real
[34:40.240 --> 34:50.360]  sources and I have now confirmed from CIA details that protected her, Blackwater details
[34:50.360 --> 35:00.680]  that protected her, same thing, secret service, federal law enforcement, you name it. And
[35:00.680 --> 35:05.840]  these are people that provide me photos of them with her. These are people that spent
[35:05.840 --> 35:13.200]  months sometimes overseas with her. She literally in situation rooms tells generals and colonels
[35:13.200 --> 35:18.400]  and people you are stupid, you're in the military, do not look me in the eye. Behind the scenes
[35:18.400 --> 35:22.440]  she is just literally, you think she looks like a demon in public when she walks around
[35:22.440 --> 35:28.520]  and she walks into rooms and goes, I am in command of this operation. Do as I say, you
[35:28.520 --> 35:33.480]  do not even look at me. Looking like this and people are just like, what the hell? Linda
[35:33.480 --> 35:38.840]  Blair. Other times she goes into a trance and like cocoons herself on a plane or in
[35:38.840 --> 35:42.840]  a car when they're driving somewhere and says, do not speak to me and then goes into like
[35:42.840 --> 35:49.160]  some type of demon trance. And I've talked to person after person after person. They
[35:49.160 --> 35:56.600]  said she is demon possessed. And that's why I started saying that back during the campaign.
[35:56.600 --> 36:00.160]  Remember what FBI agents that worked in the White House went public from back in the nines?
[36:00.160 --> 36:04.680]  They said Hillary would throw marble ashtrays at Clinton and him in the head and that she
[36:04.680 --> 36:10.720]  would get so mad that she would beat on the ground and chew the carpet. Hitler chewed
[36:10.720 --> 36:20.280]  the carpet. She gets on the ground and convulsed satanically so bad that she chews the carpet.
[36:20.280 --> 36:26.560]  She hates dogs. If they bring bomb dogs in, she goes, I told you I hate those filthy,
[36:26.560 --> 36:32.160]  disgusting animals. Get them out of here. And they're just like, yes ma'am, yes ma'am.
[36:32.160 --> 36:38.840]  Don't you look at me, you filthy military idiot. You are mentally retarded. I am an
[36:38.840 --> 36:49.320]  incredible and alert and a powerful woman. You will respect me.
[36:49.320 --> 36:58.400]  You cannot exaggerate the full demon force. She is Linda Blair. She was already co-president
[36:58.400 --> 37:10.400]  in four administrations. Let me stop there. I said I could tell the censorship. And here's
[37:10.400 --> 37:14.080]  the thing. It's been said a trillion times that truth is stranger than fiction. It's
[37:14.080 --> 37:20.000]  real, folks. Mental illness. They call it demonic possession. People being taken over
[37:20.000 --> 37:27.960]  by stuff that acts like Linda Blair or Jack Nicholson in The Shining. That's what we're
[37:27.960 --> 37:35.680]  dealing with. She doesn't know what she looks like. She doesn't know how psychotic she looks
[37:35.680 --> 37:47.440]  because there's no one there. She is a husk.
[37:47.440 --> 37:52.760]  All right, let me stop. In fact, she triggers me, as they say, when they put her on screen.
[37:52.760 --> 37:55.800]  Remember, we're radio show. It's also syndicated on TV. If you're a radio listener, you go,
[37:55.800 --> 37:58.960]  why does he keep saying, keep saying, put it on screen. Show this, show that. Those
[37:58.960 --> 38:06.200]  are radio slash TV. And without you, info wars.com and newswords.com will be destroyed. And then
[38:06.200 --> 38:10.280]  you'll be destroyed because as I said, they're going to go after everybody. So I'm going
[38:10.280 --> 38:14.640]  to get into the Jim Brown stuff and more of the censorship next segment. Let me just say
[38:14.640 --> 38:19.280]  now before I forget to because I should be doing this every segment. Their number one
[38:19.280 --> 38:27.320]  goal is to destroy info wars because we are putting out the reboot program of America
[38:27.320 --> 38:34.200]  and Americana and the spirit of resistance. And our spirit trumps their spirit by unlimited
[38:34.200 --> 38:40.840]  levels. And so when they hear this transmission, it's grating. They want to have MPR voices
[38:40.840 --> 38:49.280]  and sleep, go to sleep, little chicken as the snake coils around you. That's nice. Now you
[38:49.280 --> 38:54.800]  don't want to get involved. Sleepy, sleepy, sleepy. But now that's not working. So they're
[38:54.800 --> 39:02.640]  trying to intimidate everybody. And I really am enraged by their activities, not, not,
[39:02.640 --> 39:10.120]  not called. And they are afraid because they want to bring us down. So I want to defeat
[39:10.120 --> 39:16.360]  them. And they understand existentially, we have the capabilities. We have the metal.
[39:16.360 --> 39:23.440]  We have the political truth. We have the weapons politically. We have the high ground politically
[39:23.440 --> 39:40.360] . Our quiver is filled with razor sharp truths. And we have the great bowman's confidence
[39:40.360 --> 39:45.880]  to destroy our political enemies instantly, if ever humanity awakens and it's happening.
[39:45.880 --> 39:50.920]  And so this is a very magic time to be alive. But as I told you, and it's not hard to predict,
[39:50.920 --> 39:59.120]  but still, why are we putting up with it? Why is this unfolding? Why is this happening?
[39:59.120 --> 40:04.120]  Because it's a plan because we're at war. The globalists are stealing your birthright,
[40:04.120 --> 40:09.760]  taking over your family and putting you into bondage. And the beta test was the black community.
[40:09.760 --> 40:21.320]  They are here to dominate you. They are taking control. So I want to thank the listeners.
[40:21.320 --> 40:24.600]  You have been supporting us and you've been getting great products at the same time. It
[40:24.600 --> 40:30.720]  is so essential that everyone who hasn't tried the great supplements and the great products,
[40:30.720 --> 40:36.680]  go to m4store.com and get award winning, you know, hardcore politically incorrect t-shirts,
[40:36.680 --> 40:42.200]  all of it, funds the operation. We have the biggest sale we've ever run, store-wide free
[40:42.200 --> 40:49.240]  shipping and 50% off all of the nutraceuticals, the fluoride-free toothpaste, 4 to 5-aquilital
[40:49.240 --> 40:54.880]  silver iodine, the brain force, the X2 that's already selling out last run. But you know
[40:54.880 --> 40:58.120]  what? They took PayPal, they're trying to take our other payment processors, and they're
[40:58.120 --> 41:01.200]  going to take all the other conservatives' payment processors. And they're going to
[41:01.200 --> 41:05.600]  ban anybody from being able to work or have a job that was in the NRA. They're announcing
[41:05.600 --> 41:12.640]  it all on Fox News last night. You don't roll over to that, you fight it. So you want to
[41:12.640 --> 41:16.120]  get your supplements and stock up and get your Christmas gifts right now, because this is
[41:16.120 --> 41:21.880]  Christmas, this is Black Friday and this is Cyber Monday, all rolled into one. And we'll
[41:21.880 --> 41:26.640]  have those specials if we're even around then. But I see, I don't see it as a bad thing
[41:26.640 --> 41:31.240]  for me, whatever happens to us, because they're coming for everyone. They're at war. This
[41:31.240 --> 41:37.160]  is serious. This isn't a game. So I'm broadcasting and transmitting as hard as I can, because
[41:37.160 --> 41:43.200]  we're actually winning hearts and minds, but the enemy has the rail lines and the telephones
[41:43.200 --> 41:48.960]  as Stalin said. And that's why they're testing the Internet kill switch, that they transferred
[41:48.960 --> 41:54.480]  mainly to the UN and the EU and the Chinese three years ago, two and a half years ago,
[41:54.480 --> 42:01.200]  right before Obama left. Yeah, you heard me right. But the head of Interpol was the number
[42:01.200 --> 42:06.440]  two civilian in the Chinese military who has all the databases of everybody. That is the
[42:06.440 --> 42:12.200]  office of personal management hack, Interpol. Well, of course, just like the Chai comms run
[42:12.200 --> 42:19.760]  Interpol, they now with the EU and the UN have control of ICANN. They were going to get full
[42:19.760 --> 42:22.960]  control, but now they only got about 80% control. So they're going to test turning the Internet
[42:22.960 --> 42:29.920]  off tomorrow. You heard that right. See, it's not Trump that's getting ready to turn the
[42:29.920 --> 42:33.680]  Internet off. These people, they're getting ready to make a big move and they're turning
[42:33.680 --> 42:38.800]  everybody's communications off right before they do it. So it's pretty obvious that this
[42:38.800 --> 42:43.280]  is the big assault. So we need Congress with emergency injunctions. We need the president
[42:43.280 --> 42:47.320]  to take action now. They're not going to wait till after the election. They're making their
[42:47.320 --> 42:51.880]  move. They've got terror teams loading trucks full of bombs right now. They might not even
[42:51.880 --> 42:55.960]  do false flags. They might go right to bombing every Republican governor and trying to kill
[42:55.960 --> 42:59.880]  the president and one fell swoop.

[47:03.560 --> 47:10.560]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:10.560 --> 47:28.560]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[47:28.560 --> 47:46.680]  Welcome back to the most band, most demonized, the platform program in the world but hey
[47:46.680 --> 47:52.240]  don't worry we got lots of company. Thousands and thousands and thousands. It was 800 as
[47:52.240 --> 47:56.240]  of this morning the Washington Post but now the thousands more are coming in. Some pages
[47:56.240 --> 48:02.040]  with a million followers, some with 300,000 followers. Michelle Malkin's page, anti-war,
[48:02.040 --> 48:05.920]  liberal groups pages being banned. Anything really political that's real and popular is
[48:05.920 --> 48:11.120]  all being banned. Mainly conservatives and Christians. Facebook purges over 800 US accounts
[48:11.120 --> 48:16.400]  and pages from pushing political spam. That's right the Democrats can run around and say
[48:16.400 --> 48:21.000]  kill and murder everybody and if they can have pages run by professors organizing trying
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.520]  to kill Republicans. That's all protected. Maxine Waters can get up there and say hound
[48:25.520 --> 48:30.200]  them in restaurants, hound them at gasoline stations, hound them at the mall, don't let
[48:30.200 --> 48:35.400]  them rest, don't let them eat, don't let them do nothing. The former attorney general says
[48:35.400 --> 48:42.280]  when they go low we go lower and kick them, kick them, kick them, fight, fight, fight.
[48:42.280 --> 48:47.160]  Facebook and Twitter banned popular independent media sites in coordinated purges InfoWars.com
[48:47.160 --> 48:54.400]  from InformationLiberation.com. And you're like well you've got your own website. I'm
[48:54.400 --> 48:58.240]  going to explain how the architecture works. 15 years ago 90 plus percent of the web was
[48:58.240 --> 49:06.800]  millions of popular sites, billions of other sites. An endless island chain, an archipelago.
[49:06.800 --> 49:12.360]  Incredible diversity. Then everyone's just their own Facebook, their own Twitter. Other
[49:12.360 --> 49:18.200]  platforms and then radio shows and TV shows. They all push to that and push their audiences
[49:18.200 --> 49:25.140]  off their websites on to those platforms. The platforms swell. Then they begin slowly
[49:25.140 --> 49:29.280]  censoring, curtailing, blocking, but only when they need to. Then they went from being
[49:29.280 --> 49:37.160]  arrogant to scared two years ago and Trump won. And so now 25 days out from the historic
[49:37.160 --> 49:42.200]  election they're purging everybody. But see now they don't have to titrate the poison
[49:42.200 --> 49:45.600]  dust. They build it up, build it up, build it up until you start to kind of like the
[49:45.600 --> 49:51.560]  poison. First, oh, nobody's censoring. Oh, there's no conservative sites. Oh, well Alex
[49:51.560 --> 49:54.840]  Jones is banned, but he's a hate monitor. We're going to show you what he said, but
[49:54.840 --> 50:02.960]  oh, now it's spam. Now we consider it spam that you're posting articles and you have
[50:02.960 --> 50:08.360]  a political view. Only we're allowed to do that 25 days out. Oh, and it was 800 yesterday.
[50:08.360 --> 50:11.960]  How about a few more thousands a day? And then it's just kind of, okay, everybody's
[50:11.960 --> 50:16.280]  banned. Then they call in Facebook and Twitter execs just a month ago and they're like, no,
[50:16.280 --> 50:20.920]  we don't ban anybody if they're conservative. We only ban people that are violent or hateful.
[50:20.920 --> 50:27.560]  And now it's oh, and spam, which is totally arbitrary to what we want because Congress
[50:27.560 --> 50:33.160]  has not acted because Congress is citizen and Google moved to China helping their military
[50:33.160 --> 50:37.720]  build AI won't work with our military using US government funding that started Google
[50:37.720 --> 50:43.600]  in QTEL, the geospatial center. And why not see Trump's the president, but Obama and
[50:43.600 --> 50:47.120]  Hillary have their whole network in place. And they've got their executive orders in
[50:47.120 --> 50:51.800]  place from a civil emergency that Trump hasn't revoked. And so they're just sitting there
[50:51.800 --> 50:57.120]  with white. We don't exist. Trump's done a few things to get the economy going, but
[50:57.120 --> 51:02.320]  they've blocked 90% of what he wants to do. And then oh, he says, you know, when he says
[51:02.320 --> 51:06.280]  there's media censorship of conservatives, why he's attacking the press. No, they're
[51:06.280 --> 51:14.040]  the ones attacking the press. So what are you going to do? What are we going to do?
[51:14.040 --> 51:18.440]  Because we're at war with China politically and economically, and we have traders in our
[51:18.440 --> 51:24.600]  government and our corporations that are openly crapping on us and rubbing it in that are
[51:24.600 --> 51:31.240]  stealing our birthright. And in school education and school programming, everywhere, I'm gonna
[51:31.240 --> 51:38.720]  cover this when we come back. They're targeting children with the agenda to not have children
[51:38.720 --> 51:41.560]  and to break up the family. And that's in the WikiLeaks. It's in the documents. It's
[51:41.560 --> 51:46.760]  in the psychology with quote, sex education and tolerance training, where they take four
[51:46.760 --> 51:51.600]  year olds up, three year olds up as a obese man in a wig shakes their butt in their face,
[51:51.600 --> 52:01.160]  and they stick $5 bills in their panty line. And now the son of a daily male gay penguin
[52:01.160 --> 52:07.400] 's names, Sven and magic are set to raise their first chick after aquarium staff. Notice
[52:07.400 --> 52:13.560]  the pair were more than just friends. So they see the penguins hanging out. So they go give
[52:13.560 --> 52:19.760]  them an egg. And then male birds, especially penguins, if no one else is around and some
[52:19.760 --> 52:26.600]  species will take care of eggs. And so that means they're gay. Just like men in England,
[52:26.600 --> 52:31.360]  nurses get fired if they don't come in. One nurse said he had very large genitals and
[52:31.360 --> 52:37.080]  tattoos and a beard. He got up in the stirrups and said, I want you to give me a pap smear.
[52:37.080 --> 52:42.360]  She was suspended when she said, you sir are a male. You don't have a cervix. And the hospital
[52:42.360 --> 52:48.120]  went, no, he does. So if I said maybe I was a penguin, and he did my beak trimmed, and
[52:48.120 --> 52:53.800]  I'd go in to a dental office and I'd say, sir, I'm a penguin. Will you trim my beak?
[52:53.800 --> 52:59.240]  Or maybe I'm a, maybe I'm a chicken. Will you pluck my feathers? You don't go to a mental
[52:59.240 --> 53:04.020]  institution. Oh no. Yes, sir. Let's, let me pluck your feathers out for you. Here, let
[53:04.020 --> 53:10.880]  me preen your feathers. This is total war. And you take children who expect adults to
[53:10.880 --> 53:13.840]  give them real leadership and real direction and you put them in these schools and these
[53:13.840 --> 53:17.920]  systems and you teach little boys that are five years old. You're really a girl and you're
[53:17.920 --> 53:24.200]  really a boy to a girl or you can dress however you want. You are screwing them up. You are
[53:24.200 --> 53:30.440]  taking the existing order of mammal species and everything that is sacred and real. And
[53:30.440 --> 53:36.000]  you are irrevocably molesting their minds. You are raping their brains. You are turning
[53:36.000 --> 53:41.600]  them into middle patients. And that's the other big thing you're not supposed to talk
[53:41.600 --> 53:47.600]  about. That's the other big third rail. Jones, don't talk about radical Islam. Jones, you
[53:47.600 --> 53:55.680]  know, Jones, Jones, don't talk about transgenderism targeting children. And Jones, don't talk
[53:55.680 --> 54:02.200]  about communist China and their net censorship. Shut up. Shut up. And they told everybody,
[54:02.200 --> 54:05.720]  you shut up and you'll be banned like him. Then they didn't shut up. They go, okay, we'll
[54:05.720 --> 54:10.000]  just ban all of you. How do you like that? Well, hell, last night I'm up here late. Fox
[54:10.000 --> 54:14.200]  News is on during our own broadcast and I see Tucker Carlson reporting during election
[54:14.200 --> 54:18.240]  coverage now every week night, eight to 10 central. Cruz did a great job burning the
[54:18.240 --> 54:24.040]  camel both ends. And I see Tucker Carlson. I turn up the audio in the coffee room, the
[54:24.040 --> 54:34.720]  break room. And he's going and now this breaking in in in Los Angeles, if you're a member
[54:34.720 --> 54:38.880]  of the NRA and you're involved in contracting with the government, you must declare it in
[54:38.880 --> 54:42.880]  your contract or it's fraud. And then we're not going to give you contracts. So they're
[54:42.880 --> 54:47.240]  now saying if you are a gun owner and you're politically involved, you are banned from
[54:47.240 --> 54:53.080]  contracting. You are banned from the marketplace. That's totally illegal. Oh no, we're allowed
[54:53.080 --> 54:58.360]  to discriminate for political purposes. These people are out of control. There is Tucker
[54:58.360 --> 55:03.080]  Carlson, new LA law, will the NRA members be allowed to work in Los Angeles? It's beyond
[55:03.080 --> 55:07.760]  working. It's getting contracts. See how it starts? Remember, they took me off LinkedIn
[55:07.760 --> 55:12.480]  and now they're taking other people, other conservatives off LinkedIn and Google in California
[55:12.480 --> 55:18.960]  listed all Republicans as in the Nazi party. Oh, but there's no political bias. They're
[55:18.960 --> 55:23.800]  making their move. We're at war. And the number one tactic of a real war is you don't tell
[55:23.800 --> 55:29.320]  somebody that they're attacking. You just run over them. And as tanks roll over you,
[55:29.320 --> 55:32.600]  they have loudspeakers saying, this is not an assault. We are your friends. Lay it on
[55:32.600 --> 55:36.200]  your weapons because a certain percentage will lay them down and go, I give up and then
[55:36.200 --> 55:41.760]  you shoot them. People go, you idiot. No, they're friends. Once they buy into the Nigerian
[55:41.760 --> 55:47.500]  email scam. Once you buy in the Democrat scam, once you buy into the broadcast when the Delta
[55:47.500 --> 55:51.600]  force was killing the Davidians in Waco, grabbing in with the tank and shooting them to get
[55:51.600 --> 55:56.000]  rid of them as payback, they were, they had loudspeakers saying, this is not an assault.
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.920]  This is not an assault. Put out with your hands up and many came out with their hands
[55:58.920 --> 56:04.160]  up and were shot and then bulldoze back in and gasoline poured on them. I know the guys
[56:04.160 --> 56:11.560]  that did it. So this is how the world really works. This is what really goes on.
[56:11.560 --> 56:17.960]  Stop being childlike. We are not assaulting. Put out your hands up. Infantry on both sides
[56:17.960 --> 56:21.400]  of the back of the tank, shooting the people as they come out and then bulldozing them
[56:21.400 --> 56:27.000]  into the fire. And even though you see people being shot, you still want to get out of the
[56:27.000 --> 56:32.680]  fire. So you run out and they shoot you. This is not an assault. This is not an assault.
[56:32.680 --> 56:37.840]  No one's censoring you. No one's censoring you. Trump's a Nazi. Kanye West is a Nazi.
[56:37.840 --> 56:44.240]  Jim Brown is a Nazi. And you let these con artists sit there with Hillary's demon smile.
[56:44.240 --> 56:55.360]  Hi, I'm Hillary with Eric Smith. We love you. Yeah. They should all be arrested. They sold
[56:55.360 --> 57:02.400]  out to China. We're in World War four. These are infiltrators for God's sakes.
[57:02.400 --> 57:05.880]  I want to thank God we come back in the next hour. It's really important as yesterday and
[57:05.880 --> 57:10.360]  I just praise God for all your prayers on your support. I'm going to say it again. They're
[57:10.360 --> 57:14.400]  trying to financially shut us down, as you know, and we need to then sell out of all
[57:14.400 --> 57:20.800]  the product we have unless in case they get our last processor. And, you know, I just
[57:20.800 --> 57:24.080]  have to give you that news. It looks like we've got some more, but we're under mafia
[57:24.080 --> 57:28.000]  attack. They're going after everybody else now. So you need to get the products so we
[57:28.000 --> 57:32.080]  can have to be provisioned into next year with the funds we need. Everyone must act
[57:32.080 --> 57:36.320]  now and go to m4store.com, free shipping store wide, 50% off and all the supplements, huge
[57:36.320 --> 57:39.640]  discounts, everything else. Get t-shirts, get books while you still can. This is part
[57:39.640 --> 57:43.800]  of history and Americana and we need to be provisioned. We will continue to fight to
[57:43.800 --> 57:48.600]  the end, but I need provisions. I need information warfare ammo. I need refueling to get back
[57:48.600 --> 57:53.200]  in the field. Just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing
[57:53.200 --> 57:58.080]  and survival still next to is the pure iodine. No one else has this from deep earth crystals
[57:58.080 --> 58:03.360]  between 7 to 12,000 feet. It's very hard for me to get. It's the good halogen, but
[58:03.360 --> 58:08.160]  instead they hammer you with the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally
[58:08.160 --> 58:13.120]  fog you, fill all your cells, your thyroid, you name it. Myotry selenium goes with it
[58:13.120 --> 58:19.800]  like a horse of carriage. Selenium is an electrochemical. It's needed as well in all activity
[58:19.800 --> 58:25.280]  in the body, particularly neurons. So these go incredibly well together. We have a combo
[58:25.280 --> 58:30.480]  of those. Just experience it for yourself. Why do you think they fear me so much? Very
[58:30.480 --> 58:35.840]  simple stuff. Filter your water. Yeah, I find myself some water filters. Best out there
[58:35.840 --> 58:40.000]  for the price. When I say it's the last run, I think it'll be six months a year until we
[58:40.000 --> 58:43.920]  get more. I hope we get more. This is the last run it looks like. Survival short x2,
[58:43.920 --> 58:50.600]  m4works, tour.com, rem4workslife.com, or triple A, 2, 5, 3, 3, 1, 3, 9.

[59:53.120 --> 01:00:00.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:15.120]  I say a lot of important stuff, obviously.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:28.040]  We have very important times around us. It's not hard. We're in profound times, and when
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:31.560]  we start the next segment, there's something that's really been pressing on me. A, we've
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:42.000]  got to seek God's face and discernment, God's mind. And we also have to obviously humble
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.120]  yourself to do that. And it's a chicken or the egg thing. You come into God's presence.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:51.880]  You obviously are going to feel pathetic at one level and very small and very bad because
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:58.000]  of how good, powerful, and clean the Spirit is. But then you also feel better and closer
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.280]  to God. And then you begin to just enter the mind of God just a little bit and can see
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:12.040]  the completion and the total mastery and the timelessness and the desire to be with that
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:24.000]  forever. Now, the enemy does not like that Spirit, obviously. It's all about how powerful
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.880]  it is. It's very infantile, to say the least. But I also want to just point this out when
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:38.600]  I come back. We are not in normal times. And the biggest problem facing us is the fact
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:54.360]  that even Trump is projecting too much of himself onto the situation because he wouldn't
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:02:01.720]  do the kind of things they're coming up with. And you have to get into the enemy's mind.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:12.160]  And so just as you have to seek God's mind, I have sought to not be possessed by, but
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:16.120]  interface with evil, especially when I was younger. I didn't really do it on purpose,
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:25.400]  but I have definitely interfaced with really, really bad stuff. And not a lot of folks
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:29.680]  interface with that and never come back. So the enemy particularly doesn't like me because
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:35.920]  I have swam in very deep, dark waters. And obviously the enemy could project forward
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:40.640]  to the future and was trying to attach itself to me very early on, but I escaped it through
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:47.680]  God's grace. And they're my ancestors that prayed for future generations very intensely.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:58.880]  And so that great reservoir, that reserve of very good people is the only reason I'm
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:07.960]  here through God's grace. And my mom's mom told me things I already knew, but real mysteries,
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:13.000]  real mysteries of people that really serve God in the town of this country. And they
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.560]  don't have to meet in secret societies. They don't have to go around in black cloaks. It's
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:24.800]  not that they're close to God. And it's like everybody's connected and we know and it's
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:34.440]  powerful. And when the enemy presses their pure evil, that's when it activates. And it's
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:40.080]  a chain from us now into the past and our ancestors and then into the future. And it's
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:47.480]  electrical. So you physically touch your most ancient ancestor through your mother, your
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:53.280]  father down the line. And that's why the enemy wants to break that with artificial humanoids,
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:04:00.240]  artificial biologicals. But it's been documented that they're always aggressive, evil, soulless.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:04.040]  But that's why they want five fathers, five mothers. These aren't going to be humans.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:09.720]  So the whole transhumanist movement goes into the world of you won't be able to criticize
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:14.960]  things that are made by companies and laboratories and factories and all these movies about replicants
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.840]  and oh, they're poor things and we need to be nice to the genetically engineered creatures
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:24.400]  and you know, they're better than us. They're all preparing you for the robots and the synthetics
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:31.680]  and the biological androids to have supremacy over us. But to do that, they've got to stunt
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:39.480]  us and poison us and sterilize us so that we need to use them like a cane. And I mean,
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:42.360]  you know, the tinkered toys they show you from Boston Dynamics that can now climb up
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:46.720]  the ceiling. You can see how it's exponentially getting more dangerous. And these armies will
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:52.320]  follow orders. Just like calculators remove humans ability to do math, this will make
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:58.200]  all of our manhood vestigial. So manhood's being removed because we're being spiked.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.840]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue. Info Wars
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:07.480]  is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet,
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:11.960]  shower and sink in your home. That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water

[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:15.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. From the front lines of
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:20.200]  the Information Roar, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.840]  Well, here we are, second hour kicking it off. I'm going to give the number out for
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:45.560]  taking your calls to bottom of the hour throughout the rest of the broadcast. And here's the
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:55.480]  big announcement. On multiple fronts, I know who's running for president of a Democratic
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:59.520]  Party and I know who's already been given the nomination just like three years ago,
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:05.880]  and I know who Hillary's running made it. So I said I'd get to it last night, didn't
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.240]  said I'd get to it last hour, didn't, so I'm going to get to it right now. I have been
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:14.120]  told by the Secret Service and I have been told by the CIA and I have been told by people
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:20.080]  to Blackwater and I have been told by people in the Democratic Party, but I have been told
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:25.080]  by people that have been there at the houses, at the meeting halls, at the facilities. The
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:32.120]  ticket now is not Joe Biden. The ticket is Hillary Clinton because she owns the Democratic
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:38.360]  Party with George Soros. And you've heard rumors of this and you've seen even Democrat
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:41.120]  newspapers say, well, she's looking at it and they're saying, please don't. She doesn't
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:47.040]  care. She does what she wants. She's tone deaf. She's power man. But guess who's going
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:52.840]  to run with her? They've already announced that Michelle Obama is looking to run right
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:58.360]  now. They are looking at another co-presidency. It's where these power groups do it, where
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:02.200]  it was Bill and Hillary for two terms, then Hillary and Obama for two terms. She's been
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:08.400]  president, co-president, even liberals have been at that. They even call her Mrs. President,
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:13.400]  President in the emails going back years ago. People say, why do they call the president?
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:19.320]  Because she's been the president, co-president, that she will then be able to serve, she believes
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:35.400]  six terms, six terms, Hillary and Michelle Obama. And I have been given this by the CIA
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:40.800]  and I mean real people in the CIA, not left as pencil pushers and, you know, academics
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.720]  that all have a little card in their wallets. They can act tough and cool, you know, like
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:48.960]  the people they have testified before Congress and making up lies. We're talking about the
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:55.280]  real people that are there and sent calm whole nine yards. It's done. Democrats are being
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.320]  told this is it. You're like, wow, that doesn't sound very democratic. Sanders won all the
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:06.000]  first primaries and won California. They gave the delegates to Hillary. Remember? They tried
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.680]  to do that against Trump, but we didn't stand for it. We didn't go along with it. We would
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:19.880]  not bow down to this. And so it's done. You know, that sounds insane. It's all about
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:25.360]  divisional politics and everything is about dividing men and women and families. And so
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.080]  the same job they did on the black community in the last 50 years is already being done
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:38.480]  on everybody else. And they're going to run the corpse, the brain in the bubbling jar,
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:45.080]  like Matt Rudd said a decade ago. And just like Roosevelt was in a wheelchair and super
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:49.360]  sick, but he was still the president. Their belief is it doesn't matter. She can be in
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.680]  a wheelchair. They'll just say she isn't. You'll all see the wheelchair and they'll
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.880]  say, well, that's not a wheelchair. She fell down on her face. They said she didn't fall
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:03.960]  down. Alex Jones is fake news. MSNBC actually said Alex Jones is fake news. Look, she only
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:08.520]  stumbled and they cut off her falling on her face and being picked up and put in the vehicle
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:18.600]  having a convulsion.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:24.080]  So you think about that long and hard. That's what's about to happen. And you say, well,
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:30.400]  well, put up with that. They're, they're killing now, not just tens of thousands of conservative
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:33.800]  sites last few months and thousands in the last day. That's the big news on the fours
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:40.560]  dot com. Or we're just used to it now. See Congress doesn't act. So we get worse. They're
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:46.120]  purging all of the real liberal sites that are socially liberal on some issues, tolerant,
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.520]  but that are anti war. I looked at the list and some of these have millions of followers,
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.560]  800,000 followers, 800,000 followers, Dan Dex, the filmmaker, you name it, they're, they're
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:03.040]  all being banned too because they actually report objectively and they have followings
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:07.480]  and the establishment doesn't like that. They want full control. And so Alex Jones was a
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:14.520]  test case. Shilling lie about him, demonizing for years, hundreds of thousands of articles,
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:19.840]  literally thousands of TV programs, dozens of TV shows, homeland based on Alex Jones
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:27.240]  where I'm an evil criminal, comedy central shows, all of it to turn me into a demon in
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:32.360]  the eyes of the public so that I could then be destroyed, which we're in the process of
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:39.280]  doing here so that we're all taught how it's done. And I'm the test case. I'm the test
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:43.720]  pilot. See, just like I'm the test pilot for bringing out the hardcore ideas that are real,
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:48.400]  that no one else has the courage to do. And I put myself in this position and prove it.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:54.040]  I don't know what I'm doing. And so I'm here and I'm willing to do it because somebody's
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:59.400]  got to volunteer. I'm not saying I'm a hero here. We have no future if we don't do it.
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:07.280]  I mean, I use the cheesy wrath of Khan analogy that the big Genesis bombs about to go off
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:12.120]  and it's going to kill everybody on both ships because Khan's dying and he wants to kill
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:16.560]  Captain Kirk and the Enterprise and spot goes down on the reactor and fixes the ship because
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:22.840]  everybody's going to die if he doesn't. It's either everybody dies or I die. Now, if more
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:28.200]  of us acted like that, I wouldn't have to die. But I'll tell you right now, when I talk
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:36.360]  about death, I mean my name, my treasure, everything because we lose everything anyways.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:42.080]  There's not even a thought in my mind. I don't feel sorry for myself. I'm extremely honored
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:48.160]  because when you behave like that, that's when God opens the doors and that's when Providence
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:53.480]  raises its beautiful face and that's when you get closer to God and that's what's valuable.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:59.080]  Not money, not power. No, money, power. That's all to be used judiciously to help people.
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:07.200]  Money is only fuel to build a civilization, not to sit back with a bunch of bling and
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:11.720]  there's nothing wrong with bling if it isn't your God. It's okay to celebrate God's
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:16.600]  Providence and success, but it's not your God and you don't sell out for it. When you
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:21.440]  don't sell out, you get all the wealth and all the power. When you do sell out, you end
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:28.080]  up losing your children and your whole world and your whole life. And there's a spirit
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:32.160]  of evil being poured out in the world right now and there are people resonating with the
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:38.320]  evil spiritually and there are people who are interfacing with true evil. The devil's
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:52.720]  working overtime. It's real. Everybody knows it and we're not in normal times. We're not
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:59.040]  in normal times and that's one of Trump's only problems and my problem too. We get so
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.800]  set in the daily routine and we get used to the left's violence and their threats and
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:10.840]  all the horrible things they do and then we just kind of adapt to being abused and then
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:15.320]  when they hit us with the full dose, when they finally ramp it up, which they're doing,
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:18.680]  I think they're going to attack the next 25 days. Unless we get the word out and stop
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:23.000]  them. I don't think I know. You see the mass bomber that admits he was going to blow up
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.720]  them all, 200 pounds of explosives and kill potentially thousands of people and he's
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:31.000]  a big leftist. The media covers that up. They're activating through the propaganda, through
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  the brainwashing, through the media, the most manipulatable, manipulatable, suggestible
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:44.120]  people that are now being pushed to go out and be violent and to target. Just like advertising.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.880]  They know they put a certain beer commercial on. They're going to sell X amount of beer
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:51.680]  to this group. Well, you go out and say the Republicans or Nazis kill them or everybody's
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:56.280]  going to die and you see authority figures saying that on every channel and the presidents
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:00.280]  of white supremacists, you're going to have people try to blow the White House up when
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:04.440]  Madonna's saying I, I think a lot about blowing the White House up. Why do you think they're
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.760]  all up there every day saying kill, kill, kill and then lying about me and saying I'm saying
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:13.440]  go out and kill them with no proof is to then add, oh look, Jones says he's coming to kill
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:23.960]  you. So they go, I'm not going to put up with that. I'm going to kill you. You know how bold
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:28.400]  it is when every major news channel in the country, national news said Jones said get
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:33.440]  battle rifles and go kill the media. No clip, no nothing. That's war propaganda, man. That
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:38.560]  means they're going for broke, baby. You think I'm worried about my office and me? I'm worried
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:43.320]  about the whole world, baby. They're coming for everybody. It ain't just Alex Jones. This
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:48.160]  is the big final globalist assault and the Pentagon and the military and the police and
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:53.520]  the public. Everybody better get ready because this is the big one people that coming over
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:16:01.240]  the top six billionaires. Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:08.080]  gang of thieves ransacked the place and what they don't steal will be destroyed. This year,

[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:32.720]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.800]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:44.680]  Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S.,
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:50.240]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:57.400]  with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available at Amazon Books.

[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:03.840]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now. InfoWars
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:08.000]  is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.760]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate. People say, why would you start
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:17.520]  a fight with them? Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.480]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this. So we've already had incredible success.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:27.360]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:32.200]  why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us and if you spread
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:37.480]  the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:42.920]  up against these brutal scumbags. We'll win. We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:47.400]  now, and we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:51.240]  the fact we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market. But if you
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:55.160]  don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Love will spain win. This is InfoWars
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:22.280]  Darker Sour. With your support, I'm counting on you.
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:35.120]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. You're listening to the most banned, most lied about, most
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:39.040]  demonized broadcast in the world by the ChaiCons. They're media openly attacking me, calls
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:44.520]  me to be shut down by the Hollywood Trash, by the entire establishment. I'm a loyal American
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:49.080]  and I'm loyal to the Bill of Rights Constitution and to our open free society that's under
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:54.440]  attack. And a lot of powerful elites sold our country out. They parlayed it into global
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:58.880]  government. And if they were building a world government of peace and freedom, I'd still
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:02.920]  be worried about it because a dictator could take that over. It's authoritarian, but out
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:08.560]  of the gates, it's anti-family, anti-human. It wants full control over the life process,
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:16.840]  the life cycle. Everything is targeting our fertility, our health. We are under globalist
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:24.040]  attack and Trump represents a pro-human future and a human future. And that's why they see
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:32.120]  him as a archaic, bumbling booby. They know they could do the same things Trump's done
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:36.720]  and turn the economy on. They don't want that. They want you poor under their control. That's
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:42.440]  in the WikiLeaks. And I always say that because we forget what's in the WikiLeaks. There's
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:47.560]  one reason they want internet censorship is they're afraid of New Lakes. It's all there.
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:51.040]  How they want to keep you poor. How they want to keep you dumb. How they don't want you
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:57.000]  to have a family. How they want full control. How they want low IQ idiots they can run.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:03.520]  So, I'm going to say it again. All of these crazy wild-eyed leftists who are promised
[01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:07.560]  this utopia and go into debt to get these worthless degrees they know are worthless,
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:12.320]  they're not going to school to get a degree. They're going to school to be reeducated.
[01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:18.480]  To be brainwashed. And then they're turned loose as these big, entitled, spoiled brats
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:29.680]  to run around like political officers and commasars. And it's nasty, nasty, nasty.
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:35.800]  And as they realize they're going to lose the midterms, they are censoring and shutting
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:40.800]  everything down. I want to give the number out. I want to have people call in. I want
[01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:45.120]  to say first time callers in the first round or people that have called in and didn't get
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:50.800]  to get on when you were on hold. Those folks go to the front of the line. On the incredible
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:59.000]  race baiting and the incredible demonization of Kanye West and Mr. Brown and Mr. Trump
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:04.800]  and the Facebook and Twitter purges of thousands of pages is not 800 of prominent groups coordinated
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.480]  on the same day and that's just the beginning and that Congress must act. You must call
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:15.800]  the White House. You must. This is coordinated carteling. If any industry gets together to
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:22.280]  fix prices or to deny certain groups from the marketplace, that's illegal unless it's Congress
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:28.560]  passing sanctions. The left, the big banks, Hollywood, big tech, the Democratic Party
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:34.480]  are putting sanctions on conservatives. They're in CBS News last night saying you may not
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:41.080]  be able to work in the city of Los Angeles or get a contract if you are an NRA member.
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:47.080]  They're making you sign a contract that you aren't. You know how illegal that is, but
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:52.960]  why not? They're so bold in California multiple cities have passed laws that illegal aliens
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:24:01.360]  can vote. How do you pass a law that violates federal law? You understand we're in the middle
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:09.520]  of their revolution against what's left of America. Trump is a desperate rearguard action
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:13.560]  to just slow the thing down while we're pushed towards the edge of the cliff while he hopes
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:17.560]  other people, hey, let's come together, one flag, you know, prosperity, God, we're about
[01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:21.240]  to really be destroyed. Why would you want to be poor? Why would you want race wars for
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:26.640]  the Chai Con? Stop, please, let's be, what, come on, no, bulldozing us over the edge of
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:33.880]  the cliff and Trump's sliding, sliding towards the edge of the cliff. And you got the hordes
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:44.200]  like battering down the castle gates. And then the very throngs that are battering down
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:51.520]  the castle gates are going to destroy their own future, but they'd rather burn the castle
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:59.560]  because it's too pretty. It works too well. They have existential envy of the fortress
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:05.880]  and they want to pull it down to metaphysically, they believe, absorb it and become it. Just
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:11.760]  as South Pacific natives believe that they eat the heart of a strong man or the brain
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:18.320]  of a wise man, they take on the essence. And of course, it's called black magic. It's
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:25.960]  called voodoo. It's called evil. And that's what it is. They don't want, the globalists
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:30.720]  don't want to take over the strongest nations and then export that strength and then rise
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:35.520]  the whole civilization. They're not conquering things to build aqueducts and build libraries
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:42.840]  and public baths and medicine and literature. No, they come to destroy that, to burn it
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:51.680]  up. In their own creed, you want to see the future, Winston? It's a boot stomping on a
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:55.720]  human face forever. We don't want a society that lives longer, is more beautiful or better.
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:00.880]  We want one that's uglier and more short lived and we love trampling and being trampled upon,
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.120]  Winston. You know, Winston, you look at my face as I torture you and you see my black
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:09.840]  circles around my eyes and my chipped teeth and you think, man, your establishment's weak.
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:13.840]  No, no, my establishment's strong because I was once a very handsome, you know, very
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.800]  smart, good, altruistic person, but I joined the party and turned my soul over to ripping
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:24.200]  souls out so that I can be a true evil priest of power, Winston. I am committed to total
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:28.720]  darkness, Winston. And when I'm done, you're going to be a mentally ill, gibbering idiot
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:33.600]  that believes two plus two is whatever I say it is with your rotting teeth pulled out and
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:38.600]  then I'm going to stick you in a little bar to drink synthetic gin and worship big brother
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:42.800]  in front of a telescreen until we finally take you and blow your brains out and throw
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:47.280]  you into a furnace and your name is erased from the history books and your gas is shot
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:55.240]  up into the atmosphere. We are going to suck your soul, boy. So your soul goes right into
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:59.160]  hell. We're going to get your soul and take it down to those lower dimensions and you're
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:04.000]  gone forever. And I'm going to take I'm going to use up your fear and I'm going to suck
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:15.920]  the energy out of you because I'm a vampire. Do you understand that boy? Think we might
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:22.200]  want to protect our children from these people. If someone told you 30 years ago, they'd be
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.680]  teaching five year old boys that they're really girls and girls that they're boys and have
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:30.720]  all these weird little liberal families doing it. These are pervert families. This is pedophilia
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:43.000]  out in the open. This is the reality of what's going on because the essence is vampirism.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  Psychic, kinetic, energetic, soul sucking, energy destroying. If you could take the potential
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.880]  of a child and their whole genetic line and what they would develop normally go through
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:59.800]  rights of passage and you can steal that and confuse them and make them mentally ill, it's
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:04.240]  even better than sacrificing them and drinking their blood because you can sacrifice the
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:10.640]  entire energy line of their entire family line and then you can have them as a new disease
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:23.560]  mode infect others because the vampirism will only try to take on more, more prey. This is
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:35.600]  a vampire invasion. A psychic, interdimensional, intergalactic, multivariate system set up
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:43.520]  in a hierarchy of vampires in a huge energetic program, a satanic matrix sucking your energy
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:53.080]  and breaking your will for Satan. All done to blaspheme God because the devil knows he's
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:29:00.080]  a loser. I'll give the number out when we come back.
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:29.000]  At 886-3653 goberky.com. Most of you know that heart disease is the number

[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:03.440]  X2, we were selling it for about three years and then they found out how big it was and
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:06.960]  I was, we were buying and they said, oh, we want more money, more money and oh, this and
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:12.760]  that. And so I've broken my contract and right now we can't get more of this proprietary
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:16.560]  ingredient that goes in next to it. It literally is so pure that if you put it in a picker
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:22.360]  dish on top of 90 degree hot plate it gasses like I dream of genie and it's purple gas.
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:26.200]  I mean that is so pure it just goes right into your body when you take it. We're working
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:31.480]  on trying to get other suppliers right now but I bought a huge amount of it, ordered
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:35.720]  it six months ago, so I get the price down and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done,
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:40.520]  I'm breaking the contract. Well, I broke the contract last week and so this is potentially
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:45.920]  the last run. In fact, right now it is the last run of survival shield X2 and we've got
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:50.160]  a good supply of it. It'll be gone in a couple of months. X2, if you haven't experienced
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:54.040]  it in foreshore.com, if you have experienced it and how great it is, I suggest you stock
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:58.280]  up on it. It's available right now for a limited time in foreshore.com right now.

[01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:41.520]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:46.800]  Money through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. I'm here. Alex Jones, your host. War Room,
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:52.480]  3 to 6, David Nights of the Morning, 8 to 11, chicken butt. And then, we've launched
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:58.960]  right through the election, the censored coverage of the 2018 midterms, the left's violent
[01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:03.560]  attacks, their promise for terrorism, their attempts to crash the stock market economy,
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:06.760]  the trade war with China that they've been launching for decades that we're now just
[01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:12.760]  raising a shield to. 8 o'clock every night, InfoWars.com, we're sitting out on the radio
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:17.920]  and TV satellites for any radio or TV stations that want to pick it up, and quite a few TV
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:22.880]  stations are picking it up. We're only taking the breaks at the top and bottom of the hour.
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:28.320]  You guys get those breaks. We are skipping our breaks for this coverage, and then we're
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:31.480]  going to announce about a week after the election. We're going to have coverage for
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:35.920]  about a week after the election. It'll be aftermath. We're going to launch a new broadcast
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:42.640]  from 7 to 10 o'clock every single night here, as we promise to expand towards the new year.
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:45.720]  In the face of the globalist attacks, thanks to your prayers and your support, and don't
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:49.640]  forget, we're trying to shut us down right now, so without you, we will be shut down.
[01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:54.120]  I'm going to take phone calls and play clips for the rest of the broadcast here. I mean,
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:56.920]  I feel like if I'm not up here yelling and screaming and saying a red alert, that I'm
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:02.280]  actually hurting us because the internet kills witches in place. Trump doesn't have control
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:05.760]  of it. As I said a few weeks ago, now they've announced that today. We'll get to that in
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:10.280]  a moment. The censorship has gone thermal nuclear. Every major conservative site you
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:14.400]  can imagine being banned off Twitter and Facebook. I mean, they have titrated the dose. They've
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:18.600]  conditioned us and now they're making their big move. That is a military tactic as well.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:22.360]  We do pinprick attacks where people don't take them serious anymore than you had them
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:27.400]  with the big one. And that, again, is a tactic we use in Panama and the other areas. And
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:33.000]  that's what other systems use. And this is economic and psychological warfare. And so
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.720]  notice it's not even big news now. Everybody heard about censorship when they got sick of
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:40.760]  it about Alex Jones. And I predicted it wouldn't get a lot of attention when it was everybody
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:49.360]  else. I know the enemy game plan. I know the enemy game plan. And they've gone from denying
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:57.880]  censoring to celebrating and saying, we don't like it. We think the daily callers spam.
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:03.040]  We think and then everybody's banned. We think Michelle Malcolm spam. No, she's effective.
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:09.440]  She's smart. She does a great job. Even though we had a fight one time because I showed Marines
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:13.880]  killing a puppy and I said, listen, I support the military, but I don't like people killing
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:18.440]  innocent animals and stuff. And it makes people look bad. And she said it was a robot dog.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:25.640]  No, it wasn't a robot dog. Okay. And so some of her handlers bumped into her elbows. I
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:31.920]  bumped into a lot harder too. And it's like some six, five guy, but he wasn't tough. And
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:35.400]  he hit me with his elbows. I rammed him in his elbow and felt something crack. And he
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:38.120]  was like, whoa, I was like, uh, yeah, dude, you hit me. I'm going to actually hit you
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:45.320]  back hard. But it's so, but, but she's been banned off Facebook. And it's all happening
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:48.960]  right now. Thousands of people, thousands of prominent groups, some of these pages with
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:54.600]  millions of followers. It's here. So how do we respond to that? What do we do? Do you
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:58.720]  agree with me? They're coming over the top. I mean, this is the big push. I see an exponential
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:02.960]  buildup where I don't see how they turn it up after the election. They know in the internal
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:11.400]  polls and even public ones. Now there's a red wave and they, they couldn't stop the
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:20.400]  second SCOTUS appointment. And so the calls for violence, the open borders, the Islamification,
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:25.480]  the demonization, the race war garbage, it's all gone into hyperdrive. So what do we do
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:30.040]  to counter this? What do we do to expose what's happening? What stunts do we pull their legal
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:35.440]  and lawful in the media? Like we did saying Bill Clinton's a rapist that helped defeat
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:45.000]  Hillary. We have to get out in the streets. We have to get aggressive politically, economically.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.600]  I mean, look, they're getting aggressive $38 million twice what Ted Cruz has raised the
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:58.440]  most ever in three months for a Senate candidate for Beto, that idiot moron, anti-gun, slimebag.
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:04.440]  And it's just every news channel in Texas worship, worship, worship, worship, worship,
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:15.600]  worship, worship. On and on and on. So that's what's happening. And it's bad. And it's
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:21.960]  Soros money. It's globalist money. And they're making their move. Now look, you guys have
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:28.960]  been supporting us. I'm going to give the number out. First time callers are people
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:34.160]  that have called him before, but we're unable to get on air. When you sat on hold, that counts
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:38.440]  as a first time caller. We just have a big phone system. They could take tons of calls
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:40.920]  at the same time. So that's why sometimes we don't get to your calls. I'm going to try
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:47.680]  out here to everybody, but I don't have words to describe how coordinated and evil this is
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:52.440]  and how outrageous it is. And I'm so ashamed that we're on the knife edge of retaining
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:58.240]  the house and the Senate, the house particularly, because people can't choose America and our
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:04.920]  recovery and goodness over the chai comms and Hollywood and all this scum. But that's
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:10.240]  how many people they brainwashed and wrecked and ruined and who like to get into the hate
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:17.000]  of calling Trump an evil white supremacist who was looking at Kanye and looking at Mr.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:24.920]  Brown and thinking racist thoughts. That's what Cuomo said, Chris Cuomo and all the
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:33.280]  things they said. I don't want to repeat it, but they called him a dumb ignorant Negro,
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:40.280]  which is like the N word now in parlance. It's not a racist words like Anglo, Negro,
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:47.840]  Negro means black and Spanish or Latin, but it doesn't matter. They're up there invoking
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:54.040]  serious racism and saying he's like a menstrual show and that he's a white supremacist puppet.
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:59.800]  I already played it last hour and they know exactly what they're doing. These are nasty
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:05.200]  people using the race card and they sit up there with a big consensus of experts who
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:10.040]  are all this Democratic Party hacks reading a script and just parroting, parroting, parroting
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:21.080]  and you've got 28% in most polls up from 13% of black folks in this country saying they
[01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:25.040]  now support President Trump and you know a lot of folks black or white are scared to
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:29.960]  say they support Trump in a poll and even how they sample it. So I'd say that number's
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:33.320]  at like 45, 50 and that's why the globalists are crapping their bridges. You know, I've
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:37.480]  been down at the Travis County Courthouse this week and we had a real blessing and I'm
[01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:40.440]  just going to leave it at that and just thank God for all your prayers and I appreciate
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:47.560]  everybody out there. Some very positive things have gone on for my family and for justice
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:56.480]  and I'll leave it at that. Some sad things but things that had to be done and I mean
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:00.520]  I just couldn't get the black people in Hispanics to stop shaking my hand. I mean white folks
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:04.000]  like me too but let me tell you, the black folks love me. Hispanic folks love me and
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.760]  I love them and I'm walking down the street just shaking hands, black folks in suits,
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:13.600]  black guys in repair uniforms, Hispanic folks, families. I've got that little cafeteria down
[01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:16.640]  there with all little Hispanic ladies in it and they're just all sweethearts. They all
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:20.760]  know who I am. They all like me. They all know. They're not stupid. They tell I walk
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:27.120]  in there. I'm a nice guy. People know I'm not a villain so all the propaganda hadn't
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:31.960]  worked so I've just got to be taken completely off the air, don't I? And I'm not saying
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:42.280]  I'm perfect. I like women. I'm how God made me. I like enchiladas and cold beer too and
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:46.680]  I probably drink too much of that and eat too much of it. But the point is, is I love
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:51.840]  life and I love justice and I love seeing your success and I believe in you. So we're
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:56.320]  going to give the number out. We come back. We're going to take calls. We got some really
[01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:01.320]  special stuff in the fourth hour today. Can you believe Hillary and is going to run for
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:05.960]  president and they're going to give her the nomination. It's confirmed. The CIA is just
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:08.760]  the people that aren't left us are totally blown away. They've been at the planning
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:15.840]  meetings. This is being planned and Michelle Obama is going to be VP. That's the ticket.
[01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.800]  So you heard it here first. Next year's news today. Maybe putting it out there, it's thought
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:26.960]  might stop it but who knows. And they want me out there because these predictions aren't
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:33.880]  predictions. The things are set up at that level and Trump is the insurgency against
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:38.120]  that. We are the resistance. Don't forget I've got the biggest sale we've ever done

[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:52.280]  into one. Everything must go. Everything must sell because we may not even have the ability

[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:05.480]  for the future of humanity right now. InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:11.120]  Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department and the entire Soros crime
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:14.840]  syndicate. People say why would you start a fight with them? Because they were already
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:19.240]  dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had no future if we didn't do
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:24.880]  this. So we've already had incredible success, but if you will simply realize how epic this
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:30.080]  is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target and if
[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:36.080]  you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos infowars.com,
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:41.120]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win. We have

[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:57.400]  the Global is going to win. This is InfoWars Darker Tower, we're your support, I'm counting

[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:13.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. From the front lines of the Information War, it's
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:18.800]  Alex Jones. Watch me. Watch me. Too hard not to do that. Watch me. I got something. I got
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:26.240]  it. Watch me. Frump's got it. I got it. Hey! Mr. Brown's got it. I got something. Mr.
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:38.120]  Brown's got it. You got it, folks. Oh, yeah. I got soul. I got soul. I'm super bad. Not
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:44.680]  bad in a bad way. Bad in a good way. Let's listen to Mr. Brown a little bit more. I feel
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:48:10.520]  so good. Tell me what to do. And I'm super bad. Now, let's get serious here. The toll
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:17.080]  free number to join us on. Do you think I'm exaggerating how deadly, dangerous the times
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:21.640]  are and that things are so critical at this point? I should be on air 24 hours a day.
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:29.280]  And we all just have the normalcy of living in a quasi-free country. We have real authoritarians
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:35.240]  in a real power grab. America is in the greatest danger it's ever been in. Because King George
[01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:43.640]  III was an angel compared to the elites we have today. He was a wonderful person compared
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:54.080]  to them. Some could say even honorable. Just tyrannical. But not a bad person. I've read
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:49:01.000]  several history books from different perspectives. Menileo, yes, from inbreeding. But believed
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:09.960]  he was doing good things. Had courage. People running things in this country are the worst
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:14.880]  synthesis of decades of scum promoting themselves up and only the very worst getting in positions
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:24.040]  of power. It's a marathon of evil. A survival of the worst of the most twisted. And I don't
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:27.200]  say that to scare you. See, you know, the globalists years ago said, oh, we don't care
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:33.400]  if Jones is on air. He's just scaring him for us. No, you think we're like you. I believed
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:39.520]  in people and that if they knew the threat, they'd want to do something about it. I mean,
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:47.080]  I'll be honest. If I saw thugs breaking in my neighbor's house, I'd call the police.
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:53.200]  But if I saw him say pistol whipping my neighbor, I would get excited not because I'm a violent
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:59.760]  person. But then at that point, I have an instinct that I would enjoy going into gear
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:07.200]  and grabbing a firearm and taking action. Just like I enjoy that. I got a boil on my
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:12.200]  foot lancing. It hurts. Plus comes out. But your body says that's good. That's what you're
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:19.440]  supposed to be doing. That's the same thing. This is what you're born for, folks. This
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:24.280]  is what it's all about right now. You're, you're, we're facing real evil. And I'm gonna
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:28.200]  say it for the 10th time today. Everybody kept saying, how's it going, man? You must
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:32.560]  be really down. What's it like? You know, they're, they're going to destroy you. They're
[01:50:32.560 --> 01:50:36.200]  going to try to destroy your operation. They're going to try to bankrupt you. And I'm like,
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:39.760]  uh, get ready. They're coming for you. Come on. Let's go. Let's get them. I mean, it's
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:48.640]  not me. You're under attack. They're stealing your birthright people. I'm more alive than
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:51:05.120]  I've ever been. I'm in a war. Wake up. You're in one with child molesting scum, psychopaths
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:10.840]  that see you as food on the table, mistakes who are into being evil, who are allied with
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:16.040]  the Chinese communists. And I'll say it again, who've killed five times in their own admissions
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:26.160]  what Hitler did. Now I'm going to ask you again, why in the world would everyone not
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:31.080]  be behind Trump? And why would everyone in the world not be behind restoring our republic?
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:36.400]  What is your problem? And our audience was like, no, we're awake. We're involved. No,
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:39.800]  I'm not talking to you. You think God, you're awake. Thank God. You're the reason we're
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:43.600]  here. Thank God. I'm not talking to you. You know what I'm saying. What we got to go tell
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:49.120]  the sheep out there is listen, bro, you're with the wolves. They're eating your butt.
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:56.080]  They're not good. They're not even wearing sheep's clothing. And they're coming for everybody.
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:00.480]  They're trying to sew it all up right now. The doors are closing. The knives are coming
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:09.000]  out. They're butchering people all around you. They're uncloaked. They're firing on
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.880]  you. Let's see. A lot of people think on with the establishment mainstream media, whatever
[01:52:13.880 --> 01:52:19.840]  is in Vogue magazine, whatever is on ABC News, they still think that if they parrot that,
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:24.200]  they're like in the majority and cool. They're followers. Okay, great. You want to be followers?
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:28.880]  That's great. You're like sheep marching into a banquet and a bunch of wolves are sitting
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:34.280]  around a big table. You see sheep hanging up by their feet gutted and wolves gobbling
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:38.200]  the fresh meat. And you say, what's for dinner? And they're like, you don't know. You don't
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:46.440]  smell the blood and guts, you dumb idiot. We're going to eat your ass. Instead, you
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:51.520]  are lined up with the wolves saying protect us from those sheepdogs we saw back there
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:55.920]  in the field. They were trying to tell us not to go this direction, but we didn't listen
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:01.000]  to them and we came down here. And the wolves are like, well, thank you. You're a really
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:10.800]  good person. Come on in here. Here's the toll free number to join us. 877-789, Alex. 877-789-2539.
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:18.120]  What do we do to stop this? I just, I mean, it's bad. It's bad. The good news is we're
[01:53:18.120 --> 01:53:22.120]  on air. We're fighting it, but my God, this is all un-American tyranny taking place. It's
[01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:27.320]  naked now. There's no holding back now. It's real. They're preparing mass bombings like
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:31.400]  I told you. I haven't said they'll bomb DC before the election and now they bust a guy
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:39.440]  with 200 pounds who's a crazy Democrat. I'm going to go to some clips here. And, you know,
[01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:43.520]  here's the breaking news. Senator Cotton, we have clip coming up next hour. The Schumer
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:46.960]  political operation was behind the release of Dr. Ford's letter from the very beginning.
[01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:53.400]  We knew that. Rand Paul, media coverups, police shooting, shouting. This is for healthcare
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:54:00.400]  because they hadn't given them their free healthcare. And then all the rest of it. I've got all
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:07.600]  this Islamic news that is just unbelievable. Poland and Austria to quit UN migration compact.
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:12.000]  We want Poles to be safe in our own country. It goes on to say they're joining Hungary,
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:18.520]  the United States and others in not having the UN run who can come into your country.
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:24.800]  Yeah, until last year, going back to Bill Clinton, the UN was over who came to the U.S.
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:35.400]  And guess who runs that? You guessed it, a board appointed by George Soros. There's another
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:40.200]  one, Greece. Large Christian cross pulled down because it could offend to Muslim migrants
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:45.600]  on the island of Lesbos that's had thousands, hundreds of thousands of Islamist land. They
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:48.680]  didn't like it. So they're pulling it down and all over Europe. They're removing it from
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:55.320]  churches and public places, saying it's racist. And the EU is appointing all Muslim boards
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:55:03.200]  to have it all removed. That's on info wars.com. Paul Joseph Watson cannot make that up. Marks
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:07.480]  and Spencer criticized for selling school uniform, had jibs for toddlers. They're now telling
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:11.640]  even kids at public schools and private schools that have any Muslims going there, cover your
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:19.000]  girls. See, surreal law. Oh, you don't want to offend the Muslims. SJW is one that Dwayne
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.720]  the Rock Johnson is not black enough to play John Henry. That's just some of the type of
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:28.400]  stuff. And then tomorrow, Internet across the globe to face downtime over the next 48
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:33.120]  hours. I cans having problems. They're testing the Internet kill switch. Obama transferred
[01:55:33.120 --> 01:55:42.320]  most of the control of the Internet to the UN and the EU and a board run by George Soros.
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:46.760]  Only did it three years ago. Soros said in leaked documents that came out was in the
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:51.520]  news that they would ban all conservative and nationalist news to stop the collapse
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:55.720]  of world government calling it fake news and hate. And here we are. They're still doing
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:59.200]  it. And what's the president going to do? He's surrounded by a bunch of cowards that
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:06.040]  won't stop this. The Pentagon shouldn't be meeting with Google next week about their
[01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:11.600]  treason. They should be taking it over. It's our company, our infrastructure. We paid for
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:15.880]  it and they've merged with the Chinese. It's a national security threat. This isn't radical
[01:56:15.880 --> 01:56:22.480]  statements. We are basically gone if we don't do that. Tim Cook should be absolutely indicted
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:26.960]  for treason and espionage, getting all the code keys to China and letting them put spy
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:34.440]  chips at Foxconn into all the damn phones. Are you worried Tim Cook banned you? I'm worried.
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:38.320]  He's the traitor. I don't care what they do to me. I'm going to go down with the ship.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:45.320]  I'm not a freaking traitor. I'm not Benedict Arnold, baby. It was some big giant free country.
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:52.080]  I'd marry it. I'd merge with it. It ain't. I think America should merge with Switzerland
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:57:01.800]  today. China? No. Get it. I'm loyal to freedom and I'm loyal to free will. We're going to
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:04.720]  go to break. I've got all these clips and I'm going to write your calls. We're going

[01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.880]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.

[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:21.680]  and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:27.760]  get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.

[01:59:47.760 --> 02:00:08.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:22.880]  World Order. It's Alex Jones. Oh, you don't hear about fusing GPS anymore. Cooked up by
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:29.240]  Jeb Bush and then handed over to Hillary and then more garbage dumped on top of it. Buzz
[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:38.720]  Feed putting it out. Trump with women urinating on him. Absolute hogwash. Absolute Balderdash.
[02:00:38.720 --> 02:00:45.240]  Complete and total fiction of the defamatory type. But that's okay because they were doing
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:49.720]  it to a white supremacist. Oh, that's not true either. But now Kanye is a white supremacist
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:54.440]  because they're coming up next segment. But here's the latest breaking news alert. The
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:01:01.040]  head of future GPS is taking the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination. Here is that important
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:09.600]  news. Capitol Hill. Can lawmakers force him to answer questions? We're going to get insight
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:18.520]  from a veteran of the Watergate investigation. There's little rest. So there you go, ladies
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:24.520]  and gentlemen, they are now running for the hills and got to leave PM there in case you
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:29.240]  need that as well. Let's make a joke. Leave is our new sponsor. The left will put articles
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:33.680]  out. Stop them immediately. Oh my God, you're funding white supremacist. Just think about
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:40.680]  how criminal the media is. Think about how out of control they are. The so-called media,
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:46.040]  they're not media. They're psychological terrorists. They are liars and they know they're liars.
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:48.920]  And then all they try to do is get more and more radical, lie more and more because the
[02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:52.480]  old lies didn't work. Here, let's just make it worse. Let's make it more intense. Let's
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:02:05.080]  make it more out of control. I want to play a clip here of Jim Brown that was there yesterday
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:09.880]  with Kanye West and President Trump when he came outside and talked to C-SPAN about Trump
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:16.400]  and about the NFL kneeling as well. And the corporate media has even attacked him. Now,
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:21.880]  they haven't called him a minstrel dancer and they haven't called him a uneducated negro.
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:26.400]  But man, CNN and the mainstream media are really sick puppies. Here it is.
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:33.520]  Well, I can be very blunt about taking a knee. See, first of all, I'm an American.
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:39.120]  That flag is my flag. The things that I've overcome in this country allows to make me
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:47.120]  a better person. I don't think that we should take knees in protests instead of standing
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:53.240]  up for our flag. I think we should work out our problems as a family. And that's what
[02:02:53.240 --> 02:03:01.160]  I would advocate to my children, to all the young people that I deal with. I am an American.
[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:05.120]  That flag is my flag. And I want to represent it that way.
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:16.760]  Well, you'd have to talk to Conway. I mean, he's a beautiful human being, but I can't
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:17.760]  speak for anyone.
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:26.600]  Two more questions. Two more questions. I don't get shocked.
[02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:31.680]  We're going to move along. Thank you.
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:35.680]  All right. Last question. Excuse me. Last question.
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:40.680]  What's been the reaction from members of the football community to your support for this
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:41.680]  administration?
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:54.320]  Oh, really, I don't know. I really don't. I really don't really care because this is
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:04:06.000]  the President of the United States. He allowed me to be invited to his territory. He treated
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:15.920]  us beautifully. And he shared some thoughts. And he will be open to talking when I get
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:23.440]  back to him. That's the best he could do for me. So I'm happy to say on that it's been
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:27.160]  very successful. I wanted to give you all my respect. We've got to go.
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:30.000]  Thank you so much. Thank you.
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:35.480]  That's a classy guy. They don't make it like that anymore, do they? No, they don't. He
[02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:39.320]  respects himself. He respects the President. And he cares about the black community. And
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:43.160]  it's absolutely behind the scenes. Gotten tens of thousands of youth out of trouble
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:47.880]  and created tens of thousands of jobs. And now he's helping President Trump energize the
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:04:56.640]  black community with real investment and real jobs and a real future.
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:02.400]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by Infowars

[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:43.200]  Well, I missed Zach Cole last night because I get to the point where I just got to turn
[02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:47.920]  my cell phone off, but I know Zach. I know who Zach is. I know he's friends with Kanye
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:54.680]  West and friends with a lot of other folks like Elon Musk, and he's also friends with
[02:06:54.680 --> 02:07:00.320]  Anthony Bourdain, and he's a really interesting fella, and I can't, I mean, he doesn't want
[02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:04.760]  to get into who he is at this point in his history and his background. It's very, very
[02:07:04.760 --> 02:07:11.120]  interesting and complex, and of course, Kanye's come out and said Alex Jones and Donald Trump
[02:07:11.120 --> 02:07:17.160]  were the ultimate matrix breakers, but everybody that goes against the grain when the grain
[02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:24.360]  is evil is a matrix breaker, and this is a very magic time to be alive right now where
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:27.880]  humanity's at a crossroads, but I notice I get the number out, and Zach, who wouldn't
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:35.960]  come on the last three, four months because of Homeland Security harassing him and his
[02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:39.200]  family, and again, Trump isn't in full control of Homeland Security. I know a lot of that
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:43.720]  got shut down now, but because the security clearances and things he's had, they really
[02:07:43.720 --> 02:07:49.360]  came after him. He didn't give anything secret out on the show, but they sure came after
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:53.400]  him, and of course, Zach, he's good friends with Lewis Farrakhan and a bunch of other
[02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:58.320]  people. I'll just leave it at that, so he's connected, and a lot of stuff's been going
[02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:01.800]  on to him and his family, and he knows a lot of things about Libya and things that they'd
[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:05.680]  rather you not know, and I'll just, again, leave it at that, but I'm glad he's the first
[02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:11.240]  caller to call in, and then we'll go to Kevin and A-boss and Robert, everybody else, and
[02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:14.200]  Zach, I get you on as a guest. I mean, I looked up and noticed you've been sitting there
[02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:19.200]  for 14 minutes, so I appreciate you holding, and I know a lot of wild stuff's going on.
[02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:24.560]  I mean, you told me you'll soon see Kanye at the White House. You said that the culture
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:29.960]  will speak, and you've not predicted you know a lot of what's coming and what's going
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:39.520]  to be unfolding, and so 25 days out, my friend, from this historic crossroads election, you
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:45.360]  want to connect the dots with Nikki Haley, Michelle Obama, Avid, and more, so thanks
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:46.360]  for coming on.
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:51.600]  First and foremost, it's a pleasure to be back on. I apologize for my absence. I've
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:56.520]  realized things were going on. It's a very complex country and a very complex situation.
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:05.760]  Well, yes, like we predicted last year, and you know, YouTube has done a very good job
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:13.600]  of wiping what we said last year off, but on your broadcast, I said, in resignation,
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:19.640]  in that order, Bannon will be gone, Haley will be gone, Tillerson will be gone.
[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:26.280]  Sessions is next. Watch my words, and I have some information about Haley. I have some information
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:33.320]  about this, but make no mistake. I was dealing with some personal things, so I had to deal
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:39.880]  with it, but now I'm in a much better place now, and let's just say this, a very big event
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:44.880]  is being planned, and there's going to be some speakers. Alex Jones is going to be a
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:49.880]  speaker. Roseanne Barrow is going to be a speaker. Luis Farrakhan is going to be a
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:54.720]  speaker. Kanye West is going to be a speaker, and I can guarantee that.
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:57.880]  Well, now you're letting the cat out of the bag, man.
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:09:58.880]  Oh, listen.
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:03.080]  I know, hey, I know, they messed, they try to stop Kanye this time, because obviously
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:06.200]  he was coming here to the office, and they went crazy. I'll go ahead and release all
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:08.920]  this. Why are you releasing all this right now?
[02:10:08.920 --> 02:10:09.920]  Because it has to happen.
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:13.480]  By the way, I was going to say, why didn't you just call Dario the producers? We'd put
[02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:16.640]  you on Skype, better audio. I mean, you could have called here if you wanted to come on.
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:21.360]  I know, a lot of things are happening, and this is what's going to occur. This is what's
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:25.040]  going to occur. If we want to do the reveal right now, I'll do the reveal right now.
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:30.400]  Is that the best thing, Zach? Because usually you hold back. Maybe we shouldn't do the reveal.
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:32.400]  Let's hold up till we talk today, okay?
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:38.280]  Okay. We'll do the reveal right there. Okay. But just make no mistake, folks. Like we said
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:44.720]  last year, or earlier this year, rather, culture will speak. And notice that Kanye used the
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:50.280]  term shy rack, and maybe a lot of these listeners don't understand what that means, but that's
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:55.040]  about culture. That's about mingos. That's about rap. Culture will speak, and culture
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:11:00.040]  did speak. And there was a lot of things behind the scenes that were occurring at the White
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:04.560]  House that I was very proud to see, that I had a lot to do with, that a lot of people
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:09.000]  I knew had a lot to do with, and we're very proud of it. We're very happy about it. What
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:13.360]  we're not happy about is the attack on Elon Musk. What we're not happy about is the attack
[02:11:13.360 --> 02:11:18.400]  on Alex Jones. It's an absolute disgrace in this country. It will be addressed, and
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:20.400]  quite frankly, what it might be done.
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:25.560]  Well, I was told separately, I was told separately by the CIA and the Pentagon, in person and
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:29.840]  over the phone, that Trump, they said, don't worry, they're going to pay.
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:37.640]  Well, there's no worry. I think what it's doing is exposing sort of an error in the
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:45.040]  system of corporatism, an error in the system of economic advertising, meaning we can make
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:50.040]  our own revenue. We can generate our own bandwidth. We can have our own reach. We don't need
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:51.040]  them.
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:54.360]  No, I agree, but let's get to Nikki Haley, because that's what's really important. I
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:58.360]  was told, not just by you, but others, that she's the mole, and that Trump let her go
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:01.440]  in a nice way, but that she was, and you did say that last year first.
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:07.240]  There's a clip. I got the clip saved on the, I got it on the hard drive. I told you Haley.
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:12.720]  I told you about Haley last year. She's a snake in the grass. She's a UN creature, and
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:16.640]  it's not going to be Hillary. Hillary will be there in essence. She'll be there to promote.
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:22.120]  She'll be on the podium, but it's going to be, it's going to be Michelle OP, Nikki Haley
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:24.920]  running advice, and that's what they're going to try to run.
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:29.280]  Okay. Well, I was told by some really high level people that, that, that is in the works
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:32.560]  exactly. In fact, Roger Stone said that on air a year ago, that she's the snake in the
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:35.720]  grass and that she's going to run. And that's, that's what the left loves her. And that,
[02:12:35.720 --> 02:12:40.200]  that is in the cards, but, um, there's about Connelly Sir Rice running as a Republican
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:44.920]  or maybe even a pincet in there with Trump. I mean, who knows, but, but, but high level
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:47.920]  folks that have been in the meetings, unless they're putting out this info to fool the
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:52.440]  guys that are in the meetings, they're saying Hillary won't step down, refuses to, and that
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:57.600]  Michelle O's going to be VP. No, they, they won't, they won't let her do it because of
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:04.120]  what what's been revealed about Bernie, what's been revealed about Bernie and I implore individuals.
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:09.520]  First of all, I've had some conversations out there in those hills out there in Calabasas
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:13.880]  with Joe Rogan about having you back on, but when he had Roseanne bar on and I implore
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:20.440]  people to listen to that, um, a lot of things were revealed and what was done to Bernie Sanders
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:26.440]  the true DNC members who happened to be actual Democrats, who happened to be progressives.
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:31.520]  Like they're actually progressive. They actually believe it. They're not happy about what occurred
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:36.120]  and publicly won the nomination and they stole it publicly won it and they're not going
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:41.000]  to let her do a damn thing. And here's, and here's the big point. Oh my God, we could
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.840]  talk for hours, but here's the, here's the big point. Here's the big point. We have
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:50.400]  Kanye and Jim Brown, two of most iconic African American individuals in the Oval Office. Talk
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:55.040]  to the president of the United States of America. Here's my question. Where's the response
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:14:03.520]  from Barack Hussein? Where are you at? Oh, we know where you're at. Can you believe they're
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:10.360]  calling Kanye all these racist names, a minstrel, a dumb Negro? I mean, I'm just outraged.
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:15.040]  It's sick to watch real racism and saying, Oh, that's a dumb black man. He doesn't know
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:20.360]  anything. He's mentally ill. And this is crazy. It's smarter because the Q community in the
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:27.560]  whole phenomenon, this whole problem, which is a forest and it got really ran out of control.
[02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:32.600]  But they were calling for tribunals early and this and this and this. You can't do that
[02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:36.400]  that early because it causes chaos. You need to do it gradually. And what you're seeing
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:42.800]  is a gradual dismantling of the Democratic Party and the corrupt nature of the United
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:48.120]  States government that has been alive since about the 40s. And it's being done brilliantly
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:53.720]  in what occurred in the Oval Office with Kanye West and Jim Brown was spectacular. It was
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:58.800]  a very important, was a critical part. The event that I'm putting together, the event
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:06.120]  that will shock the world, the event that will cause headlines for weeks, will also
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:11.640]  do that. And the type of stuff that we saw in the Oval Office will continue because the
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:16.720]  dialogue needs to continue. We are Americans. I don't care where you're from. I don't care
[02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:22.840]  what you think happened. I don't care what, there's never been a better model, ever, anywhere.
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:26.840]  So I know I got loaded phone lines, but I'm going to get to everybody, but to do a few
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:29.600]  more minutes, Zach, because I wish you'd have called it on Skype. And then we were going
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:33.280]  to talk it too. But briefly, then I've got a big special report coming up and I'll talk
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:39.720]  to you after that. But and what he's saying is going on behind the scenes. And I trust
[02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:43.400]  Zach, he's usually holds pretty close to the vest. So I got to talk to you during the break,
[02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:47.760]  if they can patch him through, I want to find out why in the world he's saying this on air.
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:52.520]  Because in my experience, that's not what we're going to find out what's going on. We'll
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:53.960]  be right back.

[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:30.080]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:35.200]  the world. George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:42.000]  Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken. Its former colony, the U.S.,
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:47.640]  had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began
[02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:56.440]  with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunne, available at Amazon Books.

[02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:22.080]  beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want
[02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:46.080]  to strangle our first amendment rights.
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:20:01.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.080 --> 02:20:31.120]  All right, I got loaded phone lines, and then Zach's a great source of really interesting
[02:20:31.120 --> 02:20:34.320]  information, and I know who he is, who he is, who he is, and some of the things he's done
[02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:40.880]  behind the scenes and things that have unfolded. And so he is who he says he is, he does do
[02:20:40.880 --> 02:20:45.120]  what he says he's doing, and I can confirm some of the stuff he's been up to out in Las
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:55.200]  Vegas and out in Florida and out in LA as well. But just finishing up, I know we're winning
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:21:00.000]  the country's coming back, and this whole Democrat party is being dismantled because
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.920]  they're a criminal group out of Chi Coms. Now it's everything we talked about years ago is now
[02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:08.480]  over the news, the secret chips from China, Tim Cook, Apple, Google moving over there,
[02:21:08.480 --> 02:21:14.720]  the Pentagon is summoning Google next week, you know, to try to read the riot act to them.
[02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:18.560]  The fact that they already did this, you can't ever let them back into anything. They're criminals.
[02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:24.480]  They're censoring Americans. It is an 800 conservative sites that were banned off Facebook
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:28.480]  and Twitter together yesterday. Now we're learning it's thousands and thousands,
[02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:33.200]  with tens of millions of followers, you know, total or more. Some have millions of followers
[02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:39.840]  apiece. They're really making a serious criminal move 25 days out. They busted this guy with 200
[02:21:39.840 --> 02:21:45.840]  pound bomb, was gonna blow stuff up as a Democrat. They've got the editor of Raw Story saying,
[02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:49.920]  you know, Scalise deserved it. We're defending ourselves. You've got the former attorney general
[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:54.080]  saying we need to kick them. We need to attack conservatives. You've got anti-blocking roads
[02:21:54.080 --> 02:21:59.360]  all over the country trying to get run over, trying to have another Charlottesville. So I,
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:06.080]  all I'm saying, Zach, is you say big event. I think they know they're exponentially losing.
[02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:09.680]  I don't think they even want this election to happen. And they admittedly we're going to try
[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:14.320]  to have this bombing and others to suspend the election and then claim it's Trump's fault. So
[02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:19.360]  just give us from your perspective and your sources and some of the people, some of the generals,
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:22.800]  I know that you talked to, that talk to you that authorized you to come on the show.
[02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:26.880]  What are they thinking is going to be pulled? Because if we don't see there's about to be
[02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:32.480]  a big leftist attack. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. This is why I haven't been on. This is
[02:22:32.480 --> 02:22:38.880]  why the show on your platforms have been canceled because we compile the timeline. What happened
[02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:44.720]  at Gaddafi? What happened at Vegas? What all these things that are unsolved that we cover,
[02:22:44.720 --> 02:22:51.600]  that in force covers with impeccable integrity, with impeccable journalistic integrity,
[02:22:51.600 --> 02:22:55.440]  what happened to those things? Oh, they just go unsolved and then the next thing happens.
[02:22:55.440 --> 02:23:00.000]  The next thing happens. Let me tell you something. You're not going to stop us now
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:04.480]  because we have enough capital now. We have enough integrity now. We have a president in
[02:23:04.480 --> 02:23:10.240]  the White House now that's not going to allow us to be stopped. Free market will thrive in this
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:15.680]  country. We do not need your platforms. If you want to de-platform us, great. We'll make our own
[02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:19.280]  platform. No, I agree. But what do you make of them now? Not even calling it fake news, just
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:22.880]  not even claiming they did violations. With me, they claim violations. They just go,
[02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:26.800]  thousands of major newspapers and magazines and Michelle Malkin and everybody else.
[02:23:26.800 --> 02:23:31.520]  You're just totally banned with millions of followers of peace because we say you're spam.
[02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:35.440]  We don't like your politics. Oh, good. I got some key words for them.
[02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:40.720]  I got some key words for them real quick. What's up with Huma Abedine and Lucy Graham?
[02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:46.000]  Look at that footage. Oops. People forgot about that. Go ahead and Google that. Now,
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:50.640]  people Google that. Good. You do not want me back on the platform. I'm telling you,
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:54.880]  these people are not playing with us. They're not playing with us and we're not playing with them.
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:24:00.240]  We are in a full out war and we're going to win the war. I agree. But doesn't it show how desperate
[02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:04.480]  they are, Zach? They were planning to still do this incrementally over the next few years.
[02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:08.960]  They're desperate, but they're weak. I know. I listen. Sometimes my little nephew gets desperate,
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:16.400]  but I'm like, calm down, buddy. Calm down. Calm down. They're desperate, but they're weak.
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:23.200]  They will not win. We will prevail. Culture will speak and you will not stop us. And what we have
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:28.880]  to... Well, I think they figure that out now, Zach. I think they figure that out now,
[02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:33.440]  but they're not going to give up. So at a certain point, I believe in our free market and I believe
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:39.280]  in due process. They're an outside group with CHICOM funding attacking us. At a certain point,
[02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:44.240]  we're in dereliction of duty. If we don't tell the president, it's time to just deal with these people.
[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:49.520]  President knows. President knows. We're blind and seen. We know what's going on.
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:57.360]  Listen, there's channels. There's communication. It's strategic. It's happening slowly. It seems
[02:24:57.360 --> 02:25:02.240]  weird and it's unfair right now. It is unfair right now, but make no mistake. In the end,
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:06.960]  we will prevail. And at the very end of the day, we're going to create even more capital.
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:11.760]  So if they want to try to hold something over, good luck because you're not going to do nothing.
[02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:15.600]  You're not holding nothing over our head. Nothing. Over our head.
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:19.920]  Haven't they figured out yet that like a game of chicken, we're not blinking and that they don't
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:24.880]  make it out of this? I mean, there's no scenario where the globalists win now. I mean, they're done.
[02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:29.200]  And I'm going to end with this. We have other callers and a show to do here,
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:34.560]  but what we also have, and I have to just drop this in, we might have to schedule another appearance
[02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:40.720]  for me and I'll do the whole thing. But we can't talk about space force and continue to talk about
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:46.960]  space force. But what people aren't talking about, because it gets buried by like just like political
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:52.800]  sort of counterculture, pop culture stuff. What happened over the sky to China?
[02:25:52.800 --> 02:25:59.440]  Oh yeah, put up that incredible image. You have a hypersonic nuclear weapon,
[02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:05.520]  which is pre-orbit. Oh, no big deal. No big deal. There's no space war. No big deal.
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:10.800]  Are you guys out of your mind? You're more worried about Kanye wearing the hat, which is great,
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:14.400]  which culturally we're going to do it. We're going to make things happen. And that's how
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:19.200]  we have to do things on the ground. But make no mistake, within the continuity of government,
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:24.480]  there's actual things occurring, period. Technologically, things are occurring.
[02:26:24.480 --> 02:26:30.400]  And they want to demonize Elon Musk and bury him and bury the Dow and do all this stuff,
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:35.440]  because he talks his mind, speaks his mind. He's a genius. Stop hating on people.
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:39.520]  Well, I mean, he was, he was exposing the AI gods and the globalist takeover plan.
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:43.200]  So he had to be punished. Listen, when I'm off the years, I'll call you right away. God bless.
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:49.440]  We appreciate you coming on. But yeah, get into what that was that went off last night.
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:56.320]  I've seen the famous footage in Trinity and beyond where they're detonating atomic weapons
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:27:03.040]  in the atmosphere. And that's not good. Not good. Pretty over it there. So call me a call,
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:09.040]  call me, call me when the show's over. We'll talk and I will, I promise an appearance. And you know
[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:14.800]  what? We'll do the full reveal because at this point, who cares? I'm all in. I'm all in. Well,
[02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:18.000]  God bless you. I'll call you after the show. Thank you, Zach. We're gonna go to calls now.
[02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:21.520]  That happens sometimes when somebody calls in. I promise I'll get to everybody. I apologize.
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:27.440]  But what exactly is this mysterious light is spotted in the ice guys of China? And go ahead
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:33.600]  and scroll down now. And if you look at detonations in space of atomic or nuclear weapons,
[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:43.520]  that is exactly what they look like in US military Air Force footage of nuclear weapons detonating in
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:55.760]  space. So and then of course, you've got whatever they blew up, the debris of it sinking down.
[02:27:55.760 --> 02:28:06.640]  But that is very sophisticated, very sophisticated weapon because, well, you can see the initial
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:13.280]  detonation point at some type of chain reaction weapon. Probably that looks almost like an
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:21.440]  antimatter pellet or something. Man, I tell you, they got some, this is wild. I'm sure the Chinese
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:26.800]  are happy right now. All right, we're gonna go to break. I promise I won't wrap back to your calls.
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:31.920]  Don't forget, we are not in Kansas anymore. And Info Wars is your support. Plus, we've got
[02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:38.160]  supplements of the best out there. And we have free shipping store wide and 50% off all the

[02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:52.080]  shut us down. So I'm selling everything out of the warehouse. So we got a backup provision. Thanks
[02:28:52.080 --> 02:28:58.800]  for the support. Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:03.840]  tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:07.920]  them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people
[02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:12.400]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved. I can help you too. If you owe taxes,

[02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:47.520]  stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile
[02:31:47.520 --> 02:31:51.360]  armies. And that's who they are. And they know we know who they are. And they're coming back
[02:31:51.360 --> 02:32:01.360]  against us, so we need your support.
[02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:28.080]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it,
[02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:33.360]  ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down. And I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done,
[02:32:33.360 --> 02:32:38.240]  I'm breaking the contract. Well, I broke the contract last week. And so this is potentially
[02:32:38.240 --> 02:32:42.000]  the last run. In fact, right now it is the last run, which there's Vivalchild X2,
[02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:48.000]  and we've got a good supply that'll be gone a couple of months. X2, if you haven't experienced it,
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:52.240]  infowarslife.com, if you have experienced it and how great it is, I suggest you stop up on it.
[02:32:52.240 --> 02:33:18.240]  It's available right now for a limited time, infowarslife.com right now.
[02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:28.160]  Thank you, audience, for being in the arena and being a radio, TV audience that's actually changing
[02:33:28.160 --> 02:33:32.640]  the world with your support of what we do, but also what you do word of mouth and your courage
[02:33:32.640 --> 02:33:36.640]  to stand up for what's right. You're amazing. Don't thank me when we take these calls. You
[02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:42.800]  are amazing. You are incredible. The globe will tell you all day what crap you are, how racist you
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:46.720]  are, to demoralize you. I'm telling you, you're awesome because you are, and we're changing the
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:56.160]  world and it's real and it's happening. I'm very thankful for all your prayers. Real prayer has
[02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:05.520]  been answered on so many fronts here, and we're still in the woods here, but I can see the opening
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:10.880]  to the beautiful field out there where all of our children are going. We may not make it out to that
[02:34:10.880 --> 02:34:14.880]  field, but our kids are going to go there, and that's really what matters, and that's what this is
[02:34:14.880 --> 02:34:20.240]  really all about, is that commitment to something bigger, and we're individuals, but there is a
[02:34:20.240 --> 02:34:25.920]  collective in God's greater plan, and I'm just very thankful to all of you and please keep praying
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:30.800]  for us because I just want to execute better. Man, I'm up here a lot. I'm covering a lot,
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:36.000]  and I just get mad at myself because there's so much I don't get to, and then I'm always mad at
[02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:40.240]  myself truthfully. That kind of spills over to the crew, and that they're doing a great job.
[02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:46.320]  I just, this is so epic. How do you, how do you fight this? What do you come, what words do you
[02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:55.280]  come up with to what these people do because they're indescribably evil, and we're handicapped in this
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:35:02.880]  because we're not like that. You know, we would be depressed if we cheated on our wife or husband,
[02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:07.200]  or if we did something corrupt or we said something mean to somebody that didn't deserve it.
[02:35:07.200 --> 02:35:12.560]  We have a conscience. They don't have any conscience. They have no governor. They have no bottom.
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:19.920]  There's no basement, to quote Lee Stranahan. The left, the left isn't the left. They're,
[02:35:22.640 --> 02:35:29.440]  they are the left hand path. They're not liberals. They're just selfish sociopaths and psychopaths
[02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:35.200]  that know that we have a conscience, and so they're trying to program us because we have feelings,
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:40.160]  and so we have to not have feelings for what they do and have feelings for our children
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:47.280]  and our culture and God, but not let them manipulate us. You have to learn to not have
[02:35:47.280 --> 02:35:50.560]  feelings. That's what they can't stand is, I don't care what they say or do to me.
[02:35:51.440 --> 02:35:54.560]  I just know they're liars. We're going to defeat them. People say, how do you handle all these
[02:35:54.560 --> 02:36:00.480]  attacks? It's a bunch of criminals. You know, if some child molester was in prison saying bad
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:05.920]  things about me, why would I care? Well, these child molesters and people, they mean nothing
[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:11.680]  to me. I want them out of my life, but they won't leave me alone. So I will crush them.
[02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:20.560]  And that's what this exercise is. I'm here to wage war on Soros and Hillary. I expect to be
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:30.560]  attacked. I expect to fight and I expect to be destroyed because I intend to go where the action
[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:37.760]  is. I intend to go into every battle in every place I can, whenever I can, as many times as I can,
[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:51.600]  and I don't expect in the great final continuum to save my bacon because shaving my ash means my
[02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:58.480]  children and this country in the world fails. And then we lose it all. And once you realize,
[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:02.640]  think about losing humanity, your children, their future, then you're like, I don't care
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:09.280]  about me exactly because it's all about the continuum and stopping things like this.
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:16.560]  That's an abomination. That will not rule us. This will not control us. That will not control us.
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:22.480]  These husk, these demon-possessed monsters, they will fall forever. It won't always be the
[02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:28.960]  season of them crouched over our children lapping up their blood. I'm going to go to your calls
[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:33.920]  and I apologize. I'm going to get to everybody, but I got to everybody quick now. A-boss, Sam,
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:39.120]  David, everybody. We're going to go to A-boss in Idaho. What's the Dems' next move, A-boss?
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:45.760]  Well, actually, I just want to say that I really agree with that, that we are winning,
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:49.200]  okay? And we have to really, really believe that. There is going-
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:54.560]  But we are winning, but the enemy can go to and blow up a whole school full of kids and blame
[02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:59.440]  it on us. So what do we do when they do that? Well, and that's what I'm coming to. I honestly
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:03.280]  believe that what they're going to do, you know, you've been talking about the plan for the attack
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:07.440]  on the press. You know, I honestly don't think that they have the guts for that because, first
[02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:11.920]  off, they might get injured in it, but they honestly, the false life situation isn't working.
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:16.720]  There's too many eyes out there. But what I do think is going to happen is that this red wave
[02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:21.840]  is going to occur and it is going to make these people literally go crazy. They're going to be
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:27.520]  out in the streets. And Alex, do you remember back when, in the Ukraine war, when it first started,
[02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:33.200]  okay, those people were out protesting against the police? What did they do? They got those
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:37.760]  dang made-on. Do you remember the made-on out there? Those Nazi made-on, Euro made-on.
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:42.800]  Yes, yes. And they started firing into themselves, into their own protesters,
[02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:46.880]  to get them riled up. The cops were forced to stay out there. They had to be there
[02:38:46.880 --> 02:38:51.120]  because that was their job. And then finally, after they got the crowd riled up enough,
[02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:55.600]  they started shooting into the freaking cops to demoralize them, basically, and cause fear.
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:39:01.200]  So I honestly believe that they are going to follow the same George Soros plan that they've
[02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:07.600]  been following this entire time. It is a playbook. These people have such limited vision and no
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:12.400]  imagination. And I can tell you right now, it's enraging to watch how many lemmings are out on
[02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:18.960]  the street. It makes me sick. What do you think? Man, you're on fire, A-Boss. We could keep going.
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:23.600]  That's how they took down Ukraine with staging attacks on their own Nazi forces
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:27.840]  and our own liberal media, then back literal Nazis taking over Ukraine.
[02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:35.520]  Absolutely. I mean, these people really can't think two steps ahead. And that's, you know,
[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:38.560]  I know you want to worry about, you know, are we going to win? Are we going to win?
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:41.840]  How are we going to do it? Because, you know, what you were just saying. But honestly,
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:48.240]  we are winning, okay? And we're not really winning by our own fire here. We're carrying the fire of
[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:51.440]  God. And, you know, a lot of people out there get turned off when you start talking about God.
[02:39:51.440 --> 02:39:55.280]  I'm not going to shove it down their throats. But I'm telling you that right now, unless we walk
[02:39:55.280 --> 02:40:01.280]  with God in this, we will lose. And so we have to every step realize that we aren't the ones winning
[02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:06.560]  this, that we have to give it over to God and he is going to win it for us. All right? And you,
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:11.680]  my friend, I'm telling you, of all the years I've been watching you, I absolutely love you and your
[02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:16.560]  crew. And, you know, I've been praying for you. And what you're going through, you know, do not
[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:21.680]  let them get you down. Do not let them get you down. Because you are going to come out of this
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:27.360]  squeaky clean. All right? You will be remembered as a true blazing hero. And you know what? There's
[02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:32.640]  very few of us out there. And I'm not as, you know, as big-scaled as you are. But dang it, I am out
[02:40:32.640 --> 02:40:36.000]  there. I am tagging, playing. I love those little stickers you guys send out with your products.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:41.200]  Hey, brother, every, it's the little people that are the big people. Okay? And you're, you're the
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:45.920]  pal, listen, I just want my children to have a future. And you're right. But, you know what,
[02:40:45.920 --> 02:40:49.520]  I want my children to have a future too, man. And the globalists don't have any imagination.
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:53.040]  You're right. Beautiful call, A-boss. Call back again. Well, that was powerful.
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:56.240]  Let's talk to Sam in North Carolina. Sam, thanks for holding it on the air. Go ahead.
[02:40:57.360 --> 02:41:02.400]  Hey, how's it going, Alex? Good, brother. I just want to let you know that I was a former
[02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:08.240]  leftist in college. I ended up joining the Young Democratic Socialist. And I apologize
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:15.600]  for walking to class right now. But these people are so radicalized and so insane. What you're
[02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:20.720]  speaking of earlier, what A-boss was talking about earlier, these people will try to revolt
[02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:27.360]  and cause a civil war. I know them. And if you look at what happened at UNC at Silent Sam,
[02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:34.080]  it was a Confederate monument dedicated to UNC students who went to go serve in the Civil War
[02:41:34.080 --> 02:41:39.360]  and died. And they toppled the monument. And the Confederate people showed up and they held
[02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:44.080]  their Confederate flags and the cops pulled them the leaves. The cops also told the Democratic
[02:41:44.080 --> 02:41:49.120]  Socialist anarchist crowd the leaves as well. What did they end up doing? They didn't leave
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:55.120]  and they tried to fight the cops. And so we have these radical leftist anarchists who are in the
[02:41:55.120 --> 02:42:00.960]  streets trying to fight and kill police officers and just say, oh, I'm just anti-racist because
[02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:05.840]  that's how they brand themselves. And then when they're hitting cars with batons because white
[02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:10.640]  people are in it and it's whites hitting it, screaming F white people. It's like old people
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:15.920]  driving by. They're beating their car with batons. You F-ing white person. This is total mental illness.
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:21.520]  It is complete, total mental illness. And so what I've been doing on campus is I've been
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:27.840]  trying to instigate these people to show their true color. I go into the free expression area
[02:42:27.840 --> 02:42:32.160]  and I put, these guys want civil war. And they show up the next day and they say,
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:36.720]  hell, yes, we want civil war. We want to arm the poor. We want to arm the workers. And then we'll

[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:54.640]  I haven't gotten to of leftist grabbing a woman saying I'm going to rape you and she goes no
[02:47:54.640 --> 02:48:02.560]  as you think oh no you're anti woman so we're going to rape you and then feminists come over
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:08.320]  and defend it on video that's up on info wars.com we had the reporter that was attacked uh on the
[02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:12.720]  show yesterday and he you know he's grabbing her he's trying to get on her but but it's okay because
[02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:19.360]  he's a liberal so she's a nazi so it's all right you've been dehumanized but uh let's go ahead and
[02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:24.160]  roll some of this audio actually of the roundhouse guy kicking the pro-life woman in the in the head

[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:39.920]  right here but uh going back to salmon north carolina yes the the the average tattoos and
[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:49.360]  the average garb of a leftist uh is pentagrams and abortion worship and wanting to destroy
[02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:53.840]  reality and wanting to attack christians and so you're saying at your university that's what they're
[02:48:53.840 --> 02:49:02.640]  doing uh and they're doing it publicly uh it's not just like they're they're going out in defense
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:08.320]  of what they stand for they're going on the offense they're saying yes we do want to cause civil war
[02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:13.840]  yes this is everything that we believe in because i wrote you guys want civil war everybody called
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:17.680]  me delusional they're like oh they don't want civil war and then what do they come out and do
[02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:23.840]  they go hell yeah we want civil war it's absolute lunacy if if you remember two years back in north
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:31.120]  carolina the GOP headquarters in orange county update got firebomb uh they threw Molotov cocktails
[02:49:31.120 --> 02:49:36.560]  through the windows of the GOP headquarters that happened two years ago and i think a group of
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:43.920]  democrats raised 13 000 uh in order to help rebuild because you know after your political
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:49.840]  opponent gets firebomb we all agree that firebombing is not a good uh political strategy and so the
[02:49:49.840 --> 02:49:56.640]  community comes together to heal these people have been angry for two years that the democrats
[02:49:56.640 --> 02:50:03.920]  helped out the republicans rebuild their firebomb uh headquarters they they know how dare you support
[02:50:03.920 --> 02:50:09.200]  i won't i won't repeat what they call them but it is absolutely insane that they endorse fight
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:15.520]  and they endorse tactics such as firebombing your political opponents uh calling for anarchy
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:21.840]  giving guns to crackhead and then they're like oh yeah we're the side of what they what they want
[02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:29.280]  is power what they want is to not do any work be funded by Soros with his rise up garbage but
[02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:33.760]  believe me when they order them to go out and start killing they're only going to be the cover
[02:50:35.120 --> 02:50:39.040]  for the more serious forces behind the scenes and then they'll be the idiots
[02:50:39.040 --> 02:50:44.240]  if the globalist revolution fails that get hung high from lamppost god bless you sam
[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:48.880]  north carolina great points shoot some video what you're talking about post it fight back
[02:50:48.880 --> 02:50:54.480]  we'll we'll we'll air it here join the info wars army david in wisconsin you're on the air about
[02:50:54.480 --> 02:51:00.160]  Kanye west meeting with trump hey yeah alexa good to talk with you i've been looking for about 17
[02:51:00.160 --> 02:51:04.960]  years so great um whatever we wanted to bring up was the whole Kanye west thing and just
[02:51:04.960 --> 02:51:09.840]  i find it super disturbing and how they're using me the n word on the news and it just kind of
[02:51:09.840 --> 02:51:16.160]  to me makes it i want to try to keep black people with a victim mentality oh and totally stirred
[02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:22.640]  up i mean it's so obvious it really is and i think that's kind of the democratic democrats plan
[02:51:22.640 --> 02:51:27.120]  is to kind of like keep them on the plantation anytime like a conservative black well that's
[02:51:27.120 --> 02:51:31.840]  what Kanye's saying and that's why they're pissed they go he's crazy he's dumb a year and a half ago
[02:51:31.840 --> 02:51:38.560]  he endorsed trump his own family had him thrown with a baker act anybody can have it done in a
[02:51:38.560 --> 02:51:43.360]  mental institution for a week because he liked the president who he already knew 10 years before
[02:51:43.360 --> 02:51:47.760]  Kanye'd stayed at trump's house man let me tell you i know jesse jane's real good he's a great guy
[02:51:47.760 --> 02:51:52.240]  he stayed at trump's house many times i know a bunch of folks know trump trump is like super
[02:51:52.240 --> 02:51:57.920]  cool man Kanye's hung out and stayed with him over a decade ago Kanye know he's played at his
[02:51:57.920 --> 02:52:04.400]  hotels Kanye knows it's a load of bs they were they were friends before and what he's not allowed
[02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:09.840]  to be his friend now oh it's incredible and then they use the terms like you know house me grow
[02:52:09.840 --> 02:52:14.800]  and uncle tom those are terms for blacks that left the plantation to go live in the master's house
[02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:19.440]  and if they want to just try to keep black people in that mentality instead of how about
[02:52:19.440 --> 02:52:24.400]  we just leave the entire plantation all of us instead that's what Kanye's saying let's not
[02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:29.920]  be in the master's house because there is no plantation exactly and if we can just get black
[02:52:29.920 --> 02:52:34.320]  people to understand that trump just wants to let them thrive and not just survive what the
[02:52:34.320 --> 02:52:41.120]  democrats deal with their food stamps and all that stuff no you're right it's just so sickening what
[02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:45.920]  they've done and you know then Kanye you can only admire courage you know jim brown obviously has a
[02:52:45.920 --> 02:52:50.800]  lot of courage has been conservative for a long time but somebody like Kanye you know who's got
[02:52:50.800 --> 02:52:54.400]  everything to lose and they're coming after him and he's not backing down you can only admire that
[02:52:54.400 --> 02:53:00.080]  god bless you dad we could hear from you Juan in Texas thanks for holding you're on the air go ahead
[02:53:01.200 --> 02:53:05.920]  hey how's it going mr. Jones my first time from San Antonio welcome sir thanks for calling
[02:53:06.800 --> 02:53:11.280]  hey well thank you thank you for informing us listen i was just calling because i just read a
[02:53:11.280 --> 02:53:19.680]  uh report on impious digest.com and it mentions that how they're they're they're they're gonna
[02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:25.360]  begin to set attacks here through these um uh through these riots but they're gonna the way
[02:53:25.360 --> 02:53:30.800]  they're gonna do it is they're gonna start spilling acid on people and so from what I read was that
[02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:36.880]  Hillary Clinton met with the city of mayor in London and so they already did this in the city
[02:53:36.880 --> 02:53:42.720]  and in London as well and so yeah there's like seven acid attacks a day in London
[02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:51.040]  right correct so anyhow just letting you know that the according this is on impious digest.com
[02:53:51.040 --> 02:53:56.080]  has been very accurate because before even info or to anybody else started talking about how miss
[02:53:56.080 --> 02:54:02.560]  Ford was related to the CIA I already had that information so they found that this uh website
[02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:07.840]  seems to be very trustworthy so well I mean I want to ask myself what whoever the radicals lamas is
[02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:13.520]  whatever why why would you because I say randomly women are being attacked with acid good-looking
[02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:17.680]  women that aren't wearing veils over their heads and so you've got guys running around with buckets
[02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:23.200]  of acid that they cook up their house throwing it on a woman it's like a it's like an evil ritual
[02:54:23.200 --> 02:54:30.000]  and so what are they what's the reason like why would you do that well I don't know about the
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:33.840]  reason you know there's a lot of conflict there's a lot of powerful institutions fighting among
[02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:38.240]  each other you know the war you yourself know what's really going on behind the scenes but
[02:54:38.240 --> 02:54:44.000]  nevertheless as a matter of fact they told the certain people from high powers of position
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:49.040]  from Russia here that in the United States or here legally in the United States not to attend
[02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:54.080]  these riots because there's going to be a lot of these types of terror attacks with acid and so
[02:54:54.080 --> 02:54:58.560]  from what I understand is this is our plan and according to this report I'm not saying according
[02:54:58.560 --> 02:55:04.560]  to this report because I don't want to be involved with slander miss Clinton is involved in this so
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:09.120]  I don't know but this this website been well I know this and I appreciate your call antifa
[02:55:10.320 --> 02:55:14.640]  defecates in plastic bags and urinate senate and then lets it stew into a rotting stew
[02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:19.360]  and a guy rode by when we're leaving protesting the democrats that were having a ban on shones
[02:55:19.360 --> 02:55:24.480]  off the air ban all conservatives literally hosted by the city of austin and walmart i'm sure
[02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:28.960]  walmart didn't know but it was actually called you know banning the conservative meeting and ban
[02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:34.000]  alex jones ban trump you know were fake news and and they mainly hit owen and the other guy
[02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:41.920]  kyle it only hit me a little bit but they they he drove by on his bike with a bag and just threw
[02:55:41.920 --> 02:55:46.480]  it on us and so that's what they do they also will like get hiv and then stick you with needles
[02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:52.080]  that's what the left does i mean their their main cities are just cess pits of feces everywhere
[02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:56.880]  and they all wear like anti swastika outfits then meanwhile they're funded by jordan soros a literal
[02:55:56.880 --> 02:56:02.720]  nazi so it's it's just the irony is not lost i bless you appreciate the call from san antonio

[03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:31.920]  every single day all those those prayers that we come through and that whole info wars through
[03:03:31.920 --> 03:03:40.480]  as well thank you but what i'm um thinking about is uh i keep getting on social media
[03:03:40.480 --> 03:03:49.760]  uh um there's this constant encouragement for people to wear red wear red wear red okay
[03:03:50.480 --> 03:03:55.600]  and this is is starting to trouble me a little bit i get it you're saying we're wearing a uniform
[03:03:55.600 --> 03:03:59.360]  when they're getting ready to launch an offensive why would you wear it did something identifying
[03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:07.040]  for them to kill you well i mean red is really easy to steal the peripheral you know uh with a
[03:04:07.040 --> 03:04:14.800]  scope and i'm thinking about these idiot moron lunatic mental patients um you know because
[03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:18.800]  they already know that they're gonna no i agree if they start a violent shooting war you want to
[03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:24.800]  go wear an antifa outfit and get the middle of them and you know bake them a cake well i'm seeing
[03:04:24.800 --> 03:04:31.040]  it like we're at the voting uh uh you know we're we're voting you know the large crowd of people
[03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:41.360]  wearing red okay is is an easy target i mean and if they're up on a you know a rooftop or in a you
[03:04:41.360 --> 03:04:48.080]  know a third floor you know window or something like that you know what what and a lot of people
[03:04:48.080 --> 03:04:53.600]  stay on online well i'll take my 45 with me hold on stay right there i'm gonna come back to you
[03:04:53.600 --> 03:04:58.160]  stay with us words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now
[03:04:58.160 --> 03:05:03.840]  info lords is being openly targeted by the democratic party left to cia operatives the
[03:05:03.840 --> 03:05:08.880]  corrupt justice department and the entire soros crime syndicate people say why would you start
[03:05:08.880 --> 03:05:13.440]  to fight with them because they were already dominating and running america into the ground
[03:05:13.440 --> 03:05:19.040]  and i knew we had no future if we didn't do this so we've already had incredible success but if you
[03:05:19.040 --> 03:05:24.640]  will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made
[03:05:24.640 --> 03:05:29.760]  the main target and if you financially support us if you spread the word about our articles and
[03:05:29.760 --> 03:05:36.160]  videos info wars dot com we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scompags we'll win
[03:05:36.880 --> 03:05:41.680]  we have huge sales in four store dot com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping
[03:05:41.680 --> 03:05:45.200]  cart get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact you're trying to block our commerce and
[03:05:45.200 --> 03:05:49.920]  you're right to the market but if you don't stand up and support us financially soros the global
[03:05:49.920 --> 03:06:05.840]  spain win this is info wars darkest hour we your support i'm counting on you
[03:06:06.880 --> 03:06:15.760]  you can run on for a long time run on for a long time run on for a long time
[03:06:15.760 --> 03:06:25.840]  but the tree of liberty is water with the blood of patriots and tyrants and i think you have to
[03:06:25.840 --> 03:06:32.640]  be as wise as a serpent as peaceful as a dove but walk softly and carry a big stick i'll show
[03:06:32.640 --> 03:06:36.800]  us your back live go right back to your phone calls really great calls today
[03:06:36.800 --> 03:06:46.480]  it's gonna cut them down if you're in red state areas it's great to wear trump hats and everything
[03:06:46.480 --> 03:06:52.080]  to have solidarity to promote free speech and in targeted times it's only layers like san francisco
[03:06:52.080 --> 03:06:56.480]  or downtown austin when you get the elder screamed at wearing one and it's good to exercise it like
[03:06:56.480 --> 03:07:00.480]  kanye's doing just to promote free speech and say i'm not a slave i don't mean that because he's
[03:07:00.480 --> 03:07:05.200]  black i mean for all of us we're not slaves these people tell us what we can and can't say that's so
[03:07:05.200 --> 03:07:11.040]  fundamental it's their desperation that's made them show their true authoritarianism
[03:07:12.880 --> 03:07:19.600]  but yeah i think uh statistically you're not going to have an issue but still if you're the
[03:07:19.600 --> 03:07:24.240]  place where the dems blow something up or shoot people it won't matter you'll be dead that yeah uh
[03:07:25.760 --> 03:07:29.920]  there's no point in me unless i'm videotaping it to show how violent they are to go out and
[03:07:29.920 --> 03:07:34.560]  look for trouble so sometimes i even if i want to go out to eat with my kids or something i'll
[03:07:34.560 --> 03:07:39.520]  wear like a cap or something and uh and a big crowd of people i won't even talk too much because a
[03:07:39.520 --> 03:07:42.800]  lot of it's i've just got to get somewhere and fans will come over and they're and they're great
[03:07:42.800 --> 03:07:46.640]  but i've got to get where i'm going so i got to shake everybody's hand which which i love doing
[03:07:46.640 --> 03:07:51.280]  just that i've got to get somewhere uh but yeah i mean i think everybody identifying wearing red
[03:07:51.280 --> 03:07:56.400]  is like a uniform so it is very good to get the word out but you have to know that when you're
[03:07:56.400 --> 03:08:02.240]  doing that you're doing it for a specific reason especially if it says trump pence 2020 we sell
[03:08:02.240 --> 03:08:08.000]  those shirts it's like choose your own adventure wear a molon lobby shirt that the antifa meth
[03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:11.760]  heads aren't going to know what that means they're just getting a paycheck from soros but they will
[03:08:11.760 --> 03:08:17.120]  know what a make america great again is and they have no real power themselves so they're cowards
[03:08:17.120 --> 03:08:21.200]  you'll be sitting there at a cafe when they hit you in the back of the head with a bike lock
[03:08:21.200 --> 03:08:28.400]  or a chair and then run off and so yeah i would not turn my back and i would not be in a i would
[03:08:28.400 --> 03:08:34.400]  not take my children out wearing and make america great again had in any big city in america because
[03:08:34.400 --> 03:08:39.440]  they got a lot of brainwashed weirdos that will attack you so uh it's like put on a battle uniform
[03:08:39.440 --> 03:08:43.920]  basically or even a dress uniform uh and and going out and doing it with a bunch of meth
[03:08:43.920 --> 03:08:49.440]  head devil worshipers around so if you do it you got to be ready uh what's your take on that paul
[03:08:50.480 --> 03:08:56.720]  well what i was thinking is uh when we go to the voting uh it doesn't matter where you are to go
[03:08:56.720 --> 03:09:06.080]  vote um to be invisible okay uh vote red to be invisible all right because i think that
[03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:13.760]  they know that they're going to get the butt kicked i i i believe that that they that they know
[03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:18.240]  that they're going to get the butt kicked and so what are they going to do you're always asking
[03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:25.520]  that alex what are they going to do next okay and i'm thinking if they see a whole bunch of people
[03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:30.880]  that are proud and i can understand pride you know i'm not you're saying it might trigger i'm like
[03:09:30.880 --> 03:09:35.920]  anybody trying to have a trump demonstration in america andy foe shows up well not everywhere
[03:09:35.920 --> 03:09:40.880]  now because i heard some of them fell down hit their heads but wow imagine that but but but but
[03:09:40.880 --> 03:09:46.640]  you also know there's other forces involved here you know andy fuzz is a little bird told me is getting
[03:09:46.640 --> 03:09:50.400]  followed back to their houses when they beat up women and children now i heard like a week or two
[03:09:50.400 --> 03:10:00.800]  later they fall down the stairs paul yeah and a bunch of witnesses see it and uh yeah i don't
[03:10:00.800 --> 03:10:05.040]  know what you're talking about you know that you just go down the steps i know all about that
[03:10:05.760 --> 03:10:10.640]  but you you're the one that keeps that asking this alex you know what are they going to do next
[03:10:11.280 --> 03:10:17.200]  and i'm thinking that if a lot of people that are proud of you know who they're voting for and
[03:10:17.200 --> 03:10:22.720]  what side they're on and everything like that i can understand the pride all right but if they're
[03:10:22.720 --> 03:10:28.720]  in a big crowd like that there's some mental patient on the left oh i totally agree you heard
[03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:33.840]  about this leftist who confessed to the 200 pound bomb that was going to blow up the mall right
[03:10:34.640 --> 03:10:42.080]  or just like uh uh los vegas the los vegas shooting okay i mean how far away was that
[03:10:42.080 --> 03:10:49.520]  shooter from that crowd of people right and just imagine like a bunch of people just read
[03:10:49.520 --> 03:10:55.040]  paul great point people should think about it thank you so much uh let's talk to mike in texas
[03:10:55.040 --> 03:11:02.800]  mike you're on the air thanks for holding uh hey alex i i would like to say you know degenerates
[03:11:03.520 --> 03:11:10.560]  psychopathic droppulous control freak it's a good uh a good way to describe these people
[03:11:10.560 --> 03:11:15.840]  you know i remember back remember back when you sat in front of a curtain with the headphones on
[03:11:15.840 --> 03:11:20.400]  your head i remember back when you predicted 9 11 i've i've been around listening to you that long
[03:11:20.400 --> 03:11:28.080]  and you asked earlier you know 10 segments you go overseas you're ready and man i mean you remember
[03:11:28.080 --> 03:11:36.320]  because you were they remember i cannot believe how far we we couldn't exaggerate you wouldn't
[03:11:36.320 --> 03:11:42.400]  even have exaggerated this far then it's crazy i urge everybody who's listening right now don't
[03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:49.760]  just listen to alex go on youtube and watch kanyei talk in the oval office yesterday because it
[03:11:49.760 --> 03:11:55.280]  really had a big impact on me i was supporting him already but and you gotta hear him and you're
[03:11:55.280 --> 03:12:02.160]  gonna understand i wanted to point to touch on that one more thing i wanted to ask alex um brother
[03:12:02.160 --> 03:12:06.480]  is uh i have been searching around and i've heard you touch on it but you didn't get into it too
[03:12:06.480 --> 03:12:10.800]  much you talked about how you're going to you're getting out of the iphone you're going back to
[03:12:10.800 --> 03:12:15.840]  pcs i did the same thing years ago i went to max just because of the program the infrastructure
[03:12:15.840 --> 03:12:23.120]  it made sense you know but i'm on a my uh tricom spy device right now talking to you and i want
[03:12:23.120 --> 03:12:31.840]  out and i i would like to put together some kind of a info sheet or just get somebody break it down
[03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:37.840]  and say okay here is a is a good path we know that all of the well i agree we should look at
[03:12:37.840 --> 03:12:42.640]  companies that have smartphones that aren't owned by the evil chinese communists aren't putting spy
[03:12:42.640 --> 03:12:49.920]  chips on them and they're all platforms of trojan horses it's just apples the worst by leagues by
[03:12:49.920 --> 03:12:55.360]  lightyears i mean they are consciously calling for censorship waging war against america putting
[03:12:55.360 --> 03:13:01.280]  spy chips in chinese government run giving the i cloud keys the government and and but it's okay
[03:13:01.280 --> 03:13:06.640]  because you know tim cook prances wrangling i mean it's so ridiculous and so yeah no i don't know
[03:13:06.640 --> 03:13:12.880]  the answer i don't know the answer i was always a pc guy then like 19 years ago we moved over to
[03:13:12.880 --> 03:13:17.760]  mac because they had good cheaper video editing processing and then you know there were more bugs
[03:13:17.760 --> 03:13:23.680]  in pc so i kind of like the mac level at that point but this is not the company steve job started
[03:13:23.680 --> 03:13:27.680]  the steve jobs wouldn't let his kids have ipads now everybody's got them and so you're absolutely
[03:13:27.680 --> 03:13:32.880]  right god bless you mike and to hear from you yeah i know it's here it's going on let's go
[03:13:32.880 --> 03:13:42.560]  ahead and get another caller in here let's talk to talk to jason in new mexico let's talk trump
[03:13:42.560 --> 03:13:47.840]  kanyei meeting and larry hoover go ahead thank you very much for taking my cross sir um i'm gonna
[03:13:47.840 --> 03:13:52.560]  get right to it um kanyei tips the scale by mentioning larry hoover and the things that the
[03:13:52.560 --> 03:13:57.440]  democrats hate the most is an empowered black man and you could look at the history and look at
[03:13:57.440 --> 03:14:01.680]  malcolm max he didn't get killed till he started going against the democratic party and started
[03:14:01.680 --> 03:14:05.520]  speaking to black people about waking up he said the democratic party's worse and they're the ones
[03:14:05.520 --> 03:14:09.440]  of slavery he said the republicans aren't perfect but listen the democrats the ones
[03:14:09.440 --> 03:14:14.000]  they're domesticating you to control you and then when he stopped doing the whole race thing where
[03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:19.760]  all whites are evil that's when they killed him exactly and so the same deal with larry hoover
[03:14:19.760 --> 03:14:24.080]  when when trump i'm excuse me when kanyei mentioned larry hoover which is the founder of the black
[03:14:24.080 --> 03:14:28.880]  gangster disciples but he changed his life and started the growth and development curriculum
[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:34.880]  this basically would overnight instantly gain that that urban support if trump was departing
[03:14:34.880 --> 03:14:40.000]  him or commenced his sentence because what larry hoover was doing was actually starting to reform
[03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:45.200]  and reshape chicago and if you look at the state of what chicago is in now they couldn't have him
[03:14:45.200 --> 03:14:49.920]  get political and they only gave him the six life sentences because i believe he started to get
[03:14:49.920 --> 03:14:55.520]  political empower his community let him know that we need to have the factories the jobs
[03:14:55.520 --> 03:15:00.400]  everything that would empower young men to stay in the houses everything that that kanyei said
[03:15:00.400 --> 03:15:05.200]  in the oval office but that's why they hate him that's why they want to get rid of kanyei now because
[03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:10.400]  they're like oh he's a negro's can't read no he knows his history and his story is saying look at
[03:15:10.400 --> 03:15:15.200]  all strong black men that come and talk out against democratic party they're no longer around
[03:15:15.200 --> 03:15:21.280]  oh you're right and the democratic party thinks they own everybody but they really get territorial
[03:15:21.280 --> 03:15:26.400]  about black people and black men like hillary saying black men are predators and we need to
[03:15:26.400 --> 03:15:31.760]  keep them to heal like a dog god bless you jason there's an awakening worldwide it's huge i'm sorry

[03:17:59.040 --> 03:18:04.560]  be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need
[03:18:04.560 --> 03:18:11.600]  to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid
[03:18:11.600 --> 03:18:17.920]  rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[03:18:17.920 --> 03:18:24.320]  for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of
[03:18:24.320 --> 03:18:30.240]  heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our elixir pure gravity
[03:18:30.240 --> 03:18:36.720]  filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored
[03:18:36.720 --> 03:18:43.760]  to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of the water so what
[03:18:43.760 --> 03:18:49.600]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more
[03:18:49.600 --> 03:18:55.680]  importantly a good water filtration system will purify it it's really hard to have the energy
[03:18:55.680 --> 03:19:01.360]  at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take

[03:19:52.880 --> 03:20:09.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:09.360 --> 03:20:25.120]  i mean you are there breathing this guy's nauseous breath right in your face i commend
[03:20:25.120 --> 03:20:31.680]  you when he's grabbing you for not smacking him upside the head this is incredible well if anyone
[03:20:31.680 --> 03:20:38.720]  knows anything about me it's that i carry a firearm everywhere i go and i don't think that
[03:20:38.720 --> 03:20:44.480]  man because he's so old and crazy even knew about me but there were other women there who did
[03:20:44.480 --> 03:20:49.440]  one actually got in my face and said she was going to punch me and i just kindly and calmly
[03:20:49.440 --> 03:20:57.440]  reminded her who i am and that i do carry a firearm and boy did she turn around after that so uh
[03:20:57.440 --> 03:21:02.400]  you know they should be out there talking about women's right to self-defense if anything they
[03:21:02.400 --> 03:21:09.040]  want to call themselves feminist but instead they you know prop up people who uh want to threaten
[03:21:09.040 --> 03:21:14.480]  conservatives and i just don't know well well we commend you but i'm going to ask you this question
[03:21:14.480 --> 03:21:18.400]  you've traveled all the country now like millie weaver and other reporters have we don't have
[03:21:18.400 --> 03:21:23.120]  the cherry pick i wouldn't do like three four hour long still does facebook's and youtube's
[03:21:23.680 --> 03:21:28.960]  and they get millions of views and it's like one person at the next act like gibbering mental
[03:21:28.960 --> 03:21:33.840]  patience and we're not like feeling powerful that they released the state hospital but i mean you
[03:21:33.840 --> 03:21:40.480]  go to a democrat event uh they i don't care what color they are they look like they got beat with
[03:21:40.480 --> 03:21:46.400]  a mentally ill stick and they're just drooling they're racist you'll see white people call
[03:21:47.360 --> 03:21:53.360]  black cops the n word and and then and then the media defend i mean it's like a licensed act like
[03:21:53.360 --> 03:22:00.720]  animals i don't know what's going on well it's it's honestly it is mentally ill people and there's
[03:22:00.720 --> 03:22:06.080]  a lot of reasons how they've reached that point but they've now been hit with the messaging and
[03:22:06.080 --> 03:22:11.280]  hit with the propaganda at the right time to activate them and it's all about justification i
[03:22:11.280 --> 03:22:18.800]  mean alex let's be real if you really believed there was a nazi kkk member as the united states
[03:22:18.800 --> 03:22:24.560]  president if you really believe there was a serial gang rapist on the supreme court maybe you do have
[03:22:24.560 --> 03:22:29.440]  a little justification to to want to do something but i mean it's not even true it's beyond that it's
[03:22:29.440 --> 03:22:34.960]  like it's the justification like they're being screwed by the globalist but they're in love
[03:22:35.520 --> 03:22:41.040]  with running around and freaking and they're all here's what here's what it is that guy's obviously
[03:22:41.040 --> 03:22:46.160]  on oxygen a lot of people are from he's on disability they're all on welfare like like
[03:22:46.160 --> 03:22:52.080]  it's what mitt romney said it was true 47.9 percent don't work they're being manipulated a big rich
[03:22:52.080 --> 03:22:57.200]  free market to take care of them but like venezuela no one gets any welfare now but they don't get
[03:22:57.200 --> 03:23:02.800]  that so the truth is they're just pissed and think the workers aren't going to give them free stuff
[03:23:02.800 --> 03:23:07.040]  so they're just out there to intimidate you and say i'm going to rape your ass woman if you don't
[03:23:07.040 --> 03:23:13.120]  give him my goddamn money excuse me for saying that but uh go ahead katelyn bet it so um oh and
[03:23:13.120 --> 03:23:17.120]  then you know you guys are talking about them being mentally ill and they look like just they just
[03:23:17.120 --> 03:23:22.240]  came out of mental health facility i actually talked to one woman who uh held up a sign that said
[03:23:22.240 --> 03:23:28.000]  the g.o.p. hates women and i just asked a very objective question i said what do you think about
[03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:34.160]  the women who do vote for trump and who do align with the right wing ideology and she said
[03:23:34.160 --> 03:23:40.640]  that she feels the only reason women ever align to the right wing is because they have experienced
[03:23:40.640 --> 03:23:47.360]  trauma in their life that has left them with PTSD and some type of mental health defect
[03:23:47.360 --> 03:23:53.760]  and i'll release that video as soon as it's edited and we find it it is literally the holy team of
[03:23:53.760 --> 03:23:58.320]  men and women together that are built the world that men and women together is the power go ahead
[03:23:58.320 --> 03:24:06.400]  talk about that yeah i mean we have women's marches we can see it right now women's marches are
[03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:12.560]  going around and they just chant at everything they don't they can't come together and actually
[03:24:12.560 --> 03:24:20.240]  build something or all they do is brainwash people but men and women coming together we have those
[03:24:20.240 --> 03:24:27.440]  family values the traditional values that sustain a family and have the working class and everything
[03:24:27.440 --> 03:24:31.840]  and it's just oh of course the blood was going to get in the middle of men and women that's the
[03:24:31.840 --> 03:24:41.600]  species that's the power yeah absolutely i mean i i'm happy with tell us about your political process
[03:24:41.600 --> 03:24:44.880]  tell me get get into it you never do this on air get into your family your process
[03:24:44.880 --> 03:24:48.480]  you know where you grew up what got you politically involved with hundreds of millions of years now
[03:24:48.480 --> 03:24:52.560]  just the last six months i mean you've exploded out there and you're an example to other women
[03:24:52.560 --> 03:25:01.680]  and men i mean explain tell us about yourself so in high school i started to kind of understand more
[03:25:01.680 --> 03:25:08.640]  of the political ideology that was around me i had a an english teacher who was so left-wing
[03:25:08.640 --> 03:25:14.080]  she had a hillary clinton bobblehead on her desk and i just kind of was like would it be okay if
[03:25:14.080 --> 03:25:21.040]  someone had like a reagan bobblehead on their desk and she tried to push a lot of her socialist
[03:25:21.040 --> 03:25:27.360]  ideology onto the class and i would always be that person that would say no i actually wrote a paper
[03:25:27.360 --> 03:25:32.480]  against teacher unions to her and i when i turned it in i said please don't grade it badly just because
[03:25:32.480 --> 03:25:36.880]  i disagree with you she ended up being one of the best teachers i had and she helped me
[03:25:36.880 --> 03:25:42.800]  more understand my viewpoint because i could disagree with her and i could listen to the
[03:25:42.800 --> 03:25:49.360]  other side i had to she was in my class um but going through college when i went to kent state
[03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:54.240]  that was the first time i really experienced the indoctrination it wasn't really bad in high school
[03:25:54.240 --> 03:25:59.440]  but when i got here uh one of the first things i witnessed was a black lives matter protest on
[03:25:59.440 --> 03:26:06.240]  campus trying to shut down the black squirrel festival that kent has every year and i was just
[03:26:06.240 --> 03:26:11.360]  i was freaking out i was like oh my gosh this is a culture shock like i live in the middle of nowhere
[03:26:11.360 --> 03:26:18.320]  in zanesville and i see this and like your sky's breaking up but they're like saying that a black
[03:26:18.320 --> 03:26:25.920]  black squirrel is racist no they they just wanted to like shut it down they wanted to
[03:26:25.920 --> 03:26:30.960]  block everybody i saw the university that said that it was lynch hall which is an irish name
[03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:35.440]  but lynch could be associated with lynching someone so they changed the name because the word lynch
[03:26:36.160 --> 03:26:40.880]  was scary so so so you same thing with me i witnessed going to college a few years
[03:26:40.880 --> 03:26:46.160]  that was all worthless dis info already had a sales job was successful and all it was was
[03:26:46.160 --> 03:26:50.880]  america bashing no matter what the class was and i was like god this is authoritarianism
[03:26:52.640 --> 03:26:56.880]  yeah that's exactly what it was when i was in my architecture class he was going on about
[03:26:56.880 --> 03:27:02.640]  how women should be pro-abortion and pro-choice and and he was going on about how gay he was and
[03:27:02.640 --> 03:27:06.560]  i'm like dude no one cares that you're gay but we want to learn about the tosh mahal so we can
[03:27:06.560 --> 03:27:10.800]  pass our exams yeah why is the gay dude like kill your baby it's really sexy because david
[03:27:10.800 --> 03:27:17.200]  rockeville said so um after i dealt with that i realized there were no conservatives on campus
[03:27:17.200 --> 03:27:24.240]  standing up for themselves so i just said okay i'll be that person then and i was so shy i did
[03:27:24.240 --> 03:27:30.640]  not like putting myself out there but i just got so sick of seeing all of this indoctrination
[03:27:30.640 --> 03:27:35.840]  happening on campuses and i could not freely express my opinion without someone in my class
[03:27:35.840 --> 03:27:41.200]  just talking down to me or even the professors so uh the very first thing i did was take a
[03:27:41.200 --> 03:27:46.560]  trump flag out to uh one of the very many protests that they left us on kent state campus did
[03:27:47.200 --> 03:27:53.600]  and um i just stood there and i stated my voice and i marched with them around campus and then i
[03:27:53.600 --> 03:28:01.040]  ended up in student conduct because they wanted to uh expel me for my trump flag and uh that
[03:28:01.040 --> 03:28:06.640]  made me mad kaitlyn vennett you are amazing god bless you we really really appreciate you the
[03:28:06.640 --> 03:28:11.920]  articles on info wars dot com and news wars dot com liberty hangout dot org thanks for joining us tonight
[03:28:13.680 --> 03:28:19.040]  you know it's it's it's great to have uh new young firebrands oh it makes me excited like kaitlyn
[03:28:19.040 --> 03:28:23.120]  vennett coming up and you know what the crazy thing alex is someone like me and i think kaitlyn is
[03:28:23.120 --> 03:28:27.680]  the same way uh when i was in college i wasn't necessarily politically inclined but then once
[03:28:27.680 --> 03:28:31.360]  you get politically inclined and you just have conservative values you don't think like oh this
[03:28:31.360 --> 03:28:34.560]  means i'm going to get death threats oh people are going to hate me now and then you do it and
[03:28:34.560 --> 03:28:39.360]  you get it and this is like whoa but then you know you've got to do it more because they're lying

[03:33:25.840 --> 03:33:30.480]  edited piece where it makes no sense this is and they put a similar clip out nationwide
[03:33:31.040 --> 03:33:36.320]  of literally from like 10 minutes of the thing mixing things together to make Kanye sound crazy
[03:33:36.320 --> 03:33:41.520]  and then we're gonna roll what he actually said so let's roll the edited piece uh i think it's the
[03:33:41.520 --> 03:33:48.160]  bravery that helps you beat this game call life you know they try to scare me to not rip his hat
[03:33:48.160 --> 03:33:56.960]  my own friends but this hat it gives me it gives me power in a way you know my dad and my mom separated
[03:33:56.960 --> 03:34:05.040]  so i didn't have a lot of male energy in my home and also uh i'm married to a family that um you
[03:34:05.040 --> 03:34:11.600]  know not a lot of male energy going on it's beautiful though but there's times where you know it's
[03:34:11.600 --> 03:34:18.560]  something about you know i love hillary i love everyone right but the campaign i'm with her
[03:34:18.560 --> 03:34:24.240]  just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time like a guy that
[03:34:24.240 --> 03:34:29.840]  could play catch with his son it was something about when i put this hat on it made me feel like
[03:34:29.840 --> 03:34:38.080]  superman you made a superman that's my favorite superhero so they edited it all together so you
[03:34:38.080 --> 03:34:43.440]  don't quite get what he's saying but now he's going to really get to what's being talked about here
[03:34:44.240 --> 03:34:48.320]  about how they want to take chiefs they want to take role models away from men and women
[03:34:49.040 --> 03:34:55.280]  then because they know women once men are gone will comply and become under the state so let's
[03:34:55.280 --> 03:35:00.880]  go ahead down and start the real clip of what khanye talks about unedited here 21 minutes long
[03:35:00.880 --> 03:35:06.400]  here it is and uh we've made a lot of progress so it's very good they look that's one of many things
[03:35:06.400 --> 03:35:13.280]  but i appreciate everything with you i'll tell you what kim was in mrs johnson we got her out
[03:35:13.280 --> 03:35:20.000]  she was very unfairly treated and there are many other people like that that uh yeah larry
[03:35:20.000 --> 03:35:27.280]  clover's lawyer with us today and it's uh a person of that focus um he has six life sentences and
[03:35:27.280 --> 03:35:34.240]  they have him next to the human bomber who are 21 and one right what did he do larry i'm still there
[03:35:34.240 --> 03:35:39.920]  right why is he in yes tell me tell us allegedly it's for uh conspiracy from uh prison from state
[03:35:39.920 --> 03:35:45.200]  prison uh you know it's alleged but uh we do believe even if he did commit those crimes the
[03:35:45.200 --> 03:35:50.000]  sentence was uh overly broad by the way everything comes to us about six taking people that are non
[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:54.240]  violent whether it be water black getting them out of prison also known as clean version which the
[03:35:54.240 --> 03:35:59.680]  clinton's got the law passed in 94 to give blacks longer sentences than whites and people tried to
[03:35:59.680 --> 03:36:05.120]  petition obama for this he did nothing and i'm not against this video but the one i seen from rt
[03:36:05.120 --> 03:36:12.160]  was better you hear at all can you everybody hear this how old is he how old is he 68 he's 68 years old
[03:36:13.520 --> 03:36:20.400]  and really the reason why i think of him is because he started doing a positive for the community
[03:36:20.400 --> 03:36:24.880]  he started showing that he actually had power that he wasn't just one of a monolithic voice because
[03:36:24.880 --> 03:36:30.000]  he could wrap people around so there's theories that there's infinite amounts of universe and
[03:36:30.000 --> 03:36:34.800]  there's alternate universe they fear you each shows the universe he doesn't get to prove around
[03:36:34.800 --> 03:36:39.920]  because in a halt to him the highest level i am him each shows the universe they want you to go with
[03:36:39.920 --> 03:36:43.920]  what they're saying instead of being your own individual free will just like how i'm moving
[03:36:43.920 --> 03:36:49.120]  back to literally giving you the key what kind of you know that is this entertainer having a
[03:36:49.120 --> 03:36:54.800]  monolithic voice that's first forced to be a monolithic people going you know people expect
[03:36:54.800 --> 03:37:01.120]  that if you're black you have to be democrat i have a i have conversations that basically
[03:37:01.120 --> 03:37:06.080]  said that welfare is the reason why a lot of black people end up being a democrat they say
[03:37:06.080 --> 03:37:12.640]  you know first of all it's it's a limit to amount of jobs so the the fathers lose the jobs and they
[03:37:12.640 --> 03:37:18.080]  say we'll give you more money for having more kids in your home this is total level we got rid
[03:37:18.080 --> 03:37:24.000]  of the mental health institutions in the nineties and the prison rates just literally now you have
[03:37:24.000 --> 03:37:29.680]  shy rack what people call shy rack which is exactly our murder rate is going down 20% you're a
[03:37:29.680 --> 03:37:34.560]  victim yeah you're victimizing superintendent met with michael sacks that's wrong wrong but it's so
[03:37:34.560 --> 03:37:37.920]  common sense you wonder if people can even comprehend it it's like i think the reason why
[03:37:37.920 --> 03:37:42.560]  we need three million people on welfare is because we don't have three million jobs because we shift
[03:37:42.560 --> 03:37:48.800]  them to china though to not to wear this hat my own friends but this hat it gives me it gives me
[03:37:48.800 --> 03:37:57.280]  power in a way you know my dad and my mom separated so i didn't have a lot of male energy in my home
[03:37:57.280 --> 03:38:05.040]  and also uh i'm married to a family that increased you know not a lot of male energy going on it's
[03:38:05.040 --> 03:38:11.520]  like when we're on air but there's times where you know it's something about you know i love hillary i
[03:38:11.520 --> 03:38:17.760]  love everyone right but the campaign i'm with her just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get
[03:38:17.760 --> 03:38:24.240]  to see my dad all the time like a guy that could play with his son there was something about when
[03:38:24.240 --> 03:38:29.600]  i put this hat on it made me feel like superman you made a superman that was that's my favorite
[03:38:29.600 --> 03:38:34.640]  receiver and you made a superman cape for me also as a guy that looks up to you looks up to
[03:38:34.640 --> 03:38:41.440]  rapper in looks up to american industry guys non-political no bullshit put the beef on it however you
[03:38:41.440 --> 03:38:47.520]  want to do it five seconds delay and just goes in and gets it done right now you gave me the heart
[03:38:47.520 --> 03:38:54.640]  to go to adidas because at adidas when i went in 2015 i loved how he said that he done like oh he's
[03:38:54.640 --> 03:38:59.840]  done yeah because he's you're done he's talking fast because he's smart you didn't make five
[03:38:59.840 --> 03:39:07.680]  billion dollars your effect and i went to casper we had a meeting in chicago and i said you have to
[03:39:07.680 --> 03:39:16.320]  bring manufacturing on shore inch that even shore into the core is that about the borders the core
[03:39:16.320 --> 03:39:22.080]  of adidas and chicago is the core of middle america we have to make middle america strong
[03:39:22.080 --> 03:39:27.280]  so i had the balls because i had an evolving trump or sink brother i mean this did a sting
[03:39:27.280 --> 03:39:32.480]  maybe a billionaire and i could have lost 200 million dollars walking away from that deal
[03:39:32.480 --> 03:39:36.960]  but even with that i knew it was more important for me to take the chance of walking away from
[03:39:36.960 --> 03:39:42.720]  that deal than to have no fathers in chicago with no and we do have written a restoration
[03:39:42.720 --> 03:39:48.240]  for no because it's a superman and he realizes that there's only one man who can help him make
[03:39:48.240 --> 03:39:52.720]  that happen and that's president donald trump he's saying empower my people get them out of
[03:39:52.720 --> 03:39:58.080]  president go factories the black community help stop this garbage more and they say he's a dumb
[03:39:58.080 --> 03:40:04.160]  negro because they want to keep everybody poor on that damn plantation and that we provide
[03:40:04.160 --> 03:40:11.680]  transition with mental health in the american um education curriculum that a jim has worked on
[03:40:11.680 --> 03:40:16.800]  larry hooper also has a curriculum that he's worked on we have monosori curriculums that we
[03:40:16.800 --> 03:40:24.960]  worked on we worked on the curriculum we have meditation there's a lot of things affecting
[03:40:24.960 --> 03:40:30.400]  our mental health that makes us do crazy things that puts us back into that trap door called a
[03:40:30.400 --> 03:40:35.760]  13th amendment i did say abolish with the hat on this by the way never free around that's a trap
[03:40:35.760 --> 03:40:41.360]  door as you feel in the floor the constitution is the face of our of our industry right of our
[03:40:41.360 --> 03:40:46.960]  of our country of our company would you build a trap door that if you mess up and you accidentally
[03:40:46.960 --> 03:40:51.360]  something happens you fall and you're black you get three times longer in person i don't you
[03:40:51.360 --> 03:40:56.960]  got to remove all that trap door as a democrat policy the four gentlemen that wrote that go by
[03:40:56.960 --> 03:41:02.960]  and hillary clinton wrote the legend's work it's perfect we don't have 13 floors do we you know so
[03:41:02.960 --> 03:41:08.000]  the four uh the four gentlemen that wrote that's like he gets it he looked like the people they
[03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:17.280]  were amending also at that point it was illegal for blacks to read or african-americans to read um
[03:41:18.320 --> 03:41:24.800]  and so that meant you get locked up when that spirit closes like when i talk to him again so
[03:41:26.080 --> 03:41:32.400]  we don't need sentences we mind no trump he knows he knows he knows it he's done i was diagnosed with
[03:41:32.400 --> 03:41:37.840]  bipolar disorder so scared i was connected with a neuropsychologist that works with the athletes in
[03:41:37.840 --> 03:41:43.840]  the mba and the nfl and he he looked at my brand it's equal on three parts i'm gonna go ahead drop
[03:41:43.840 --> 03:41:50.000]  some bombs for you 98 percentile iq tests i had a 75 percentile of all human beings but it was
[03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:54.800]  counting eight numbers backwards after his repeat so i'm gonna work on that one the other one's
[03:41:54.800 --> 03:42:02.720]  98 percent tesla freud you know so yeah connie was a genius and they're and the blacks are calling
[03:42:02.720 --> 03:42:08.080]  him a retard because he's a genius sleep deprivation which could cause dementia it on the plantation
[03:42:08.080 --> 03:42:14.240]  connie years when your shackles on connie my son's name so all this power that i get and i'm taking

[03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:24.800]  and what we need is to grab him from a miller the pharmaceutical all these parasites and live off
[03:42:24.800 --> 03:42:29.760]  more money that's one thing i've never stepped into a situation where i didn't make people more money
[03:42:29.760 --> 03:42:35.920]  so we can empower pharmaceuticals we can he's saying listen i'm the leader i build it i build

[03:47:56.800 --> 03:48:03.120]  you follow that and then they said trump didn't like it and then trump was blown away please if he
[03:48:03.120 --> 03:48:09.360]  doesn't look good we don't look good great right that's right you're not a great savior yes it is
[03:48:10.080 --> 03:48:15.120]  you're so great place a lot of sense and see jim brown and trump are sink they've been friends
[03:48:15.120 --> 03:48:20.720]  for 30 years jim brown impressed before they're synced up jim brown is a badass jim brown knows
[03:48:20.720 --> 03:48:25.760]  trump walloves everybody i think he's a dump and that's what you think jim brown is going to be
[03:48:25.760 --> 03:48:31.120]  intimidated the guy used to run over people on like literally run them over that was quite something
[03:48:31.120 --> 03:48:38.800]  that guy's not intimidated by anything so yeah he just said that he dies he's been wrong
[03:48:38.800 --> 03:48:44.480]  ever bonus body from you realize that this is where god is and you do first coming together
[03:48:44.480 --> 03:48:49.280]  and they're not going to stand the way of this that's why they hate us before they say this is
[03:48:49.280 --> 03:48:56.880]  satanic this means interdimensional victory this is the symbol of of the future next one they
[03:48:56.880 --> 03:49:03.760]  see i was very emotional and i was programmed to think from a victimized mentality this literally
[03:49:03.760 --> 03:49:10.000]  means okay in sign language the real they seem simple as a second day we really get caught up
[03:49:10.000 --> 03:49:15.280]  infinity is like an dimensional game over the idea of industry this why we love this is people don't
[03:49:15.280 --> 03:49:21.200]  have land they settle you're living forever we're together everything's okay uh don't matter mama died
[03:49:21.200 --> 03:49:25.840]  last week she's in heaven we want to we're in an extended order we want land because we're scared of
[03:49:25.840 --> 03:49:31.040]  that and deals to actually have land and have ownership of our own blocks so when you don't
[03:49:31.040 --> 03:49:36.160]  have ownership then it's all about how same deal makes you wealthy own your own city about the
[03:49:36.160 --> 03:49:41.200]  soul of the core we focus more on the amazing thing he said there was he's saying that people buy
[03:49:41.200 --> 03:49:46.640]  into the propaganda of making sure they have the coolest brand like nike instead of you know i'm
[03:49:46.640 --> 03:49:51.200]  going to invest in myself and buy a home or buy land no i'm going to invest in a brand so i can be
[03:49:51.200 --> 03:49:57.280]  cool and accepted and we have to and the whole horror media says khanye's crazy none of it makes
[03:49:57.280 --> 03:50:03.600]  sense devate billions on his own and he's an idiot but don lemon that can't even wipe his own ass
[03:50:03.600 --> 03:50:08.080]  he's a genius calling black people that are successful we have to take a responsibility for
[03:50:08.080 --> 03:50:14.240]  dumb Negroes let's finish up we kill each other more than uh police officers and that's not saying
[03:50:14.240 --> 03:50:19.360]  that the police officer is not an issue because exactly as i say in bad cops sir we need to stop
[03:50:19.360 --> 03:50:24.320]  killing each other but he's trying to explain the placement of law enforcement they need to be
[03:50:24.320 --> 03:50:31.840]  law power it's force versus power so a lot of times the police officer is sitting there
[03:50:31.840 --> 03:50:35.920]  they're being forced to do this and forced to do that black and then they force somebody into
[03:50:35.920 --> 03:50:42.080]  something and force something we have to release the love throughout the entire country and give
[03:50:42.080 --> 03:50:48.880]  opportunities a lot of times it's just the overall lack of reparations literally this is a given
[03:50:48.880 --> 03:50:53.280]  point we say oh this is racist this is racist this is racist this is racist so we don't have
[03:50:53.280 --> 03:50:59.040]  a reparations but we have a 13th amendment we've got to open up the whole conversation so and uh
[03:50:59.040 --> 03:51:04.240]  that's a move one of the moves that i love that liberals tried to do the liberal would try to
[03:51:04.240 --> 03:51:08.560]  control a black person through the concept of racism because they know that we are very proud
[03:51:08.560 --> 03:51:13.600]  emotional people so when i said i like trump to like someone as liberal they'll say oh but these
[03:51:13.600 --> 03:51:18.240]  races you think racism can control me you know all i'm doing is there oh that don't stop me that's an
[03:51:18.240 --> 03:51:23.120]  invisible you know kanya it almost came to the studio this is no i don't think maybe it's no it
[03:51:23.120 --> 03:51:25.040]  wasn't you know i don't think you're saying you're saying you're saying you're saying you're saying you
[03:51:25.040 --> 03:51:29.520]  unplugged the info or something edited it out i answered your question because you add us together
[03:51:29.520 --> 03:51:35.920]  it's like a new period oh it'd be the next you know rogan podcast etc you better play 40 tests with
[03:51:35.920 --> 03:51:40.080]  me like i'm gonna call it fair con because it ain't that simple no i'm trying to explain
[03:51:40.080 --> 03:51:45.040]  mr president imagine alex jones fair con and kanya was on time so i would like to know what you
[03:51:45.040 --> 03:51:49.440]  would like to ask president trump to do for chicago you're here to talk no it's like trump says
[03:51:49.440 --> 03:51:55.440]  something with anybody the thing that um that the uh head of the police and um my sacks met with me
[03:51:55.440 --> 03:52:00.720]  last night so i was there with we feel that stop and frisk and fair game says just not
[03:52:00.720 --> 03:52:04.160]  how some things are wrong you said these are wrong there's a matter of course and everyone that knew
[03:52:04.160 --> 03:52:10.880]  i was coming here said asked about stop and frisk that's that's that's uh the number one thing
[03:52:10.880 --> 03:52:17.760]  that we're uh having this conversation about uh another thing is opening up industries and we've
[03:52:17.760 --> 03:52:23.600]  got to get some tax breaks too because you know we're making um we got a speed factory in atlanta
[03:52:23.600 --> 03:52:28.160]  but the joggery don't do in front of that you're costing us too much to make tax breaks for black
[03:52:28.160 --> 03:52:31.920]  you need some prototypes here like you go out and do a business it's not like oh you just
[03:52:31.920 --> 03:52:36.720]  don't mind if you're black or whatever can't be discussed no no no but because things were done
[03:52:36.720 --> 03:52:43.840]  wrong you know about reparations in kapa and vietnam to a a a to be able to have to play in my
[03:52:43.840 --> 03:52:48.640]  hometown forgive taxes every point seven minutes of nine million surrounding suburbs but we can't
[03:52:48.640 --> 03:52:51.760]  think that i know you're talking about my opinion i think it'd be cool for them to be
[03:52:51.760 --> 03:52:57.600]  not google or start google them or do a banner and i think it'd be cool to have the jewish ideation
[03:52:57.600 --> 03:53:04.560]  uh centers which would be a mix of system of forgiving that every decade or so and gives
[03:53:04.560 --> 03:53:09.280]  them modern information like jumble sometimes people say this guy has ad this guy has ad you
[03:53:09.280 --> 03:53:14.000]  don't have ad school is boring it was boring is that as exciting as this we have to make it what
[03:53:14.000 --> 03:53:18.480]  is the biblical principle of forgiving that's basketball while you're doing math what is the
[03:53:18.480 --> 03:53:23.360]  biblical principle of forgiving that's why you meditate in the morning we have to instate mental
[03:53:23.360 --> 03:53:30.080]  health and art programs uh back into the uh back to the city so those are uh and also
[03:53:30.640 --> 03:53:35.840]  larry hoover is an example of a man that was turning his life when you're watching as soon as he
[03:53:35.840 --> 03:53:40.880]  tries to turn his life around they hit him with his life sentences so i believe he's with you say
[03:53:40.880 --> 03:53:45.920]  don't tear down the statue somebody's really down there is a living statue he's a beacon for us
[03:53:45.920 --> 03:53:51.520]  i think it's the year of jubilee jubilee jubilee jubilee jubilee jubilee jubilee jubilee jubilee
[03:53:51.520 --> 03:53:56.960]  on every single block they can own the block is that and i'm white from jib brown from the

[03:57:48.400 --> 03:57:53.440]  buying and they said oh we want more money more money and oh this and that and so i've broken
[03:57:53.440 --> 03:57:59.280]  my contract and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in next to
[03:57:59.280 --> 03:58:04.960]  that literally is so pure that if you put in a picker dish on top of 90 degree hot plate it gasses

[03:58:09.680 --> 03:58:14.960]  when you take it we're working on trying to get other suppliers right now but i bought a huge amount
[03:58:14.960 --> 03:58:20.480]  of it ordered it six months ago so i get the price down and i said if you don't lower it i'm done
[03:58:20.480 --> 03:58:25.840]  i'm breaking the contract well i broke the contract last week and so this is potentially the last
