[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.680]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.460]  It's Sunday, September 24th, 2023.
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.400]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we take you first to the battle front in the proxy war
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.360]  between NATO and the Russians, backed by the US taxpayer, where Seymour Hersh with the
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.980]  highest level sources confirms what we can analyze for ourselves.
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.540]  The Russians have won the war against NATO in Ukraine, and no amount of heavy weapons
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.900]  will ever stop that, but they don't care.
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.660]  They're massively money laundering, and of course, using the crisis to cut off grain supplies
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.080]  to the world to accelerate their societal collapse.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.900]  Here's the headline, Seymour Hersh, stories up on InfoWars.com, Zelensky's battered
[00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.340]  army no longer has any chance of a victory.
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.500]  Intelligence sources tell Hersh the war is over, Russia has won, there is no Ukrainian
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.860]  offensive anymore, but the White House and the American media have to keep lies going.
[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.380]  We're going to go to break here in a few minutes and come back with this as our top
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.060]  story, but I wanted you to know that we're going to be covering that first in detail.
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.260]  Then I want to tie it all together.
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.100]  Zelensky in DC last week spent most of his time begging for money and of course
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.260]  saying climate change is destroying the world and flooding our coastal cities and
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.020]  causing tornadoes and hurricanes and that we all need to drive electric cars.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.820]  Then John Kerry went on national television and said that we need to totally get rid
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.820]  of our combustion engines because China's getting rid of them, because China is flooding
[00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.100]  and China knows how important it is to save the earth.
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.220]  That is the sickest gaslighting I've ever seen.
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.540]  In fact, we started having annual gaslighting awards and hands down that would win it so
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.460]  far for 2023.
[00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, China is building three new coal power plants a week.
[00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.340]  China has the largest carbon footprint in the world and I'm not saying that's even
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.340]  bad.
[00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.940]  Carbon's good, it's what we're made of, what the atmosphere is made of, but the
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.720]  idea of that is just next level.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.540]  So we're going to look at how these wars, these open borders, the carbon taxes, the
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.780]  shutting off the power of the West is part of this larger globalist agenda to empower
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.940]  China and cause deindustrialization in the West to bring us to our knees.
[00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.780]  We'll be looking at those stories that all tie together and also a Von Mises fellow
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.700]  and a professor who has been going viral for years, but particularly lately going
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.700]  really viral, who's just been destroying all of these frauds.
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.540]  So we're going to be playing some of his clips coming up as well and just so much
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.540]  more today.
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.380]  Owen Schroyer is obviously coming up later.
[00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.900]  I'm going to be getting back into town tomorrow and I'll be back on air, back in
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.900]  the studio.
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.060]  But as you've been noticing, I've been working here from the road.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.780]  I want to thank you all for tuning in.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.900]  We're living in unprecedented times and when we look back on this, we're going to realize
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.360]  the historic crossroads we were at.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.820]  There is a giant awakening, but our enemies are striking back with more surveillance,
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.660]  more censorship, more lawfare, more weaponized justice department, but we forced the enemy
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.780]  to take the mask off.
[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.980]  And speaking of the different globalist programs, they've got to bring down the Western world
[00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.580]  and complete the mega corporations domination and hegemony over the planet.
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.460]  Biden a few days ago blamed Trump for the border crisis, but then went on to say
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:03.380]  what his solution was, which is basically turning the border into a turnstile where
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.580]  anybody can come in and will be given quote assistance.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.340]  And that as the cities implode because of the late, the feds are going to federalize
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.420]  the cities and bring in federalized grocery stores and everything else.
[00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.640]  Basically the Soviet Union 2.0.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.880]  You cannot make this up.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.980]  It's Cloward and Piven on steroids.
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.100]  We're living in the collapse, but there's still time to turn it around and rebuild
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.180]  it in a free market, open society system based on our constitution bill of rights,
[00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.420]  but not the counterfeit false.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.700]  Escape open society that the UN and Klaus Schwab, and of course the Memphis society
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.420]  is the open society foundation.
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.420]  George Soros.
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.780]  We'll be right back on this live sunny transmission.
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:05:00.540]  Please stay with us.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.660]  My fellow Patriots, the trifecta has not been in stock for years.
[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.940]  Many of these products have been sold out for years, but we've not had all three

[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.800]  The last beacon of truth in a world of deception.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:26.760]  It's Sunday, September 24th, 2023.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.320]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.880]  You're about to go through a massive list of incredible news.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.400]  The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.160]  Speaking of the bad and the ugly, I first want to go to a big story from zero hedge.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.000]  That's up on info wars.com.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.360]  Seymour Hearst, Zelensky's battered army no longer has any chance of victory.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.200]  Intelligence sources tell Hearst the war is over.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.680]  Russia has won.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.960]  There's no Ukrainian offensive anymore, but the white house, the American media have
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.400]  to keep the lie going.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.180]  Now, first off, Hearst is one of the most award-winning trusted reporters ever.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:08.520]  He is the thoroughbred, uh, triple crown winner, Pulitzer prize winning investigative
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.520]  journalist.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.720]  I give about a 99% accuracy rate, but I don't have to go off Hearst.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.120]  We've got Colonel McGregor.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.320]  We've got reporters on the ground.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.320]  We've got all the Intel coming out.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.240]  It is a fact that 500,000 Ukrainians have died.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.480]  It is a fact that the Russians had ever intended to take the whole country, but tended
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.960]  to take only those Eastern areas as a security buffer.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.100]  It is a fact that NATO knew they would lose the entire time, but they win wandering
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:40.280]  hundreds of millions of dollars and expanding NATO and of course being able to shut off
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.720]  the grain and then blame that for the larger food collapse.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.860]  The UN and the WF have been running with policies.
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:55.400]  The big danger here is that they may continue to escalate with more heavy weapons and double
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.960]  down with the Russians.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.940]  That will just cause the Russians to double down themselves again, but Poland is pulling
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:01.940]  out of the war.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.040]  Uh, the polls show 80% of Americans are against the war.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.800]  Europe is completely turning against the war.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.720]  People are waking up to just how out of control and dangerous this march towards
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.200]  thermal nuclear World War III is.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.440]  Let's continue with the article breaking down Cy Hirsch's latest report.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.120]  The clandestine bombings, the Nord Stream one and two pipelines under the Baltic sea
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.320]  happened on September 26, 2022.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.560]  This coming Tuesday will mark the one year anniversary.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.000]  The prospect of a direct NATO Russia war has only continued to grow and some possible
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.200]  nuclear World War III level disastrous catastrophe to grow into that still looming darkly
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.960]  on the horizon.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.680]  Yes, Lavrov just gave a speech to UN two days ago saying the US is officially at war
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.440]  with Russia and that Russia is at war with the US.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.800]  This is a nightmare.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.800]  Legendary American investigative journalist Seymour Hirsch and his latest article has
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:03.680]  bluntly stated the reality is that Zelensky's battered army no longer has any chance of
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.680]  victory.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:09.160]  Whereas previously there was a vast chasm between Hirsch's conclusions and those the
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:15.600]  Western press reports this is no longer the case, just as the Economist this week reported.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.160]  The Economist is the mouth of the new world order.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:23.560]  The narrative dissonance must be particularly jolting for the average Americans who up
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:28.860]  until this point have been treated to a constant rosy pictures and overly optimistic reports
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.660]  of Ukraine winning or at least pushing back the Russians.
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:37.080]  This was certainly the mainstream's driving theme as last throughout the first year of
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.960]  the war and even into the summer.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.280]  I remember the defense minister a few months ago before they launched their counter offensive.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.960]  The Ukrainian defense minister said we're going to go all the way to Moscow with our tanks.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.640]  Delusions of grandeur.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:55.000]  Hirsch in his Thursday substack report cited an unnamed intelligence source who spent
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.640]  the early years of his career working against Soviet aggression spying.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.440]  This source said that despite some continued and recent attempts to paint the Ukraine
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.800]  counter offensive as making slow but steady progress, the truth is the opposite.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.020]  It's all lies, the source told Hirsch, the war is over, Russia has won.
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.920]  There is no Ukrainian offensive anymore, but the White House,
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.080]  the American media have to keep the lie going.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.680]  The truth is the Ukrainian army is ordered to continue the offense of the army with mutiny.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.000]  The soldiers aren't willing to die anymore, but this doesn't fit the BS that's being
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.760]  authored by the White House.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.520]  The intelligence source explained the conclusion, perhaps given some degree of
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.040]  confirmation when Zelensky met with Biden on Thursday.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.440]  Lackluster is how the previously generated characterized the mood.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.840]  Nothing new of importance was announced by Biden other than a measly 325 million
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.520]  military aid package for already approved funds.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:55.360]  There was also the mention of limited or little US long range missiles approved for Kiev.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.600]  Now Congress wants $24 billion though to rebuild Ukraine.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.320]  That's the next leg of the money laundering operation.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.920]  Of course, the Clintons will then take control of the IMF World Bank,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.520]  US taxpayer money and European taxpayer money and siphon it back to themselves.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.760]  That's what I added.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:19.040]  So it goes on from there and lays out some of the points I made about Poland and the rest of it.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.240]  Meanwhile, Ukraine, it appears with direct targeting and intelligence help from Washington,
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.040]  continues to mount riskier and riskier attacks on targets inside Russia and Crimea.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.040]  Friday's storm shadow missile attack that the British gave them on
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.560]  Sebastopol Black Sea fleet naval headquarters is a case in point.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.400]  It may have taken out the top naval commanders as Ukraine is currently
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.920]  claiming and marks one of the biggest escalations of the war so far.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.680]  So that's NATO's insane and the globalist insane wish is to use
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.200]  a major war with Russia to bring in a collapse of the old system.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.320]  That'll do it better than opening the borders and shipping in fentanyl and devaluing currencies
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:03.760]  and turning blue cities and states into crackhead hellscapes.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.840]  And they're willing to do that to bring in their new world order.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.240]  It'll kill a bunch of Russians.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.640]  It'll kill a bunch of Americans.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.240]  It'll kill a bunch of Europeans.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:17.720]  Then they can resettle us with a replacement migration for more easily managed third world populations.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.800]  And this all ties into the further shutting off of our energy and food resources
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.320]  and the fertilizer to grow it.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.800]  Folks, the decisions that have already been put in place are going to cost
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.560]  hundreds of millions to starve to death.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.720]  The U.N. even admits it, but they don't tell you they're the ones that are behind it.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.920]  Here is the globalist puppet Zelensky just a few days ago at the U.N.
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.160]  in between demanding billions of dollars more.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:46.480]  He said that we all need to get on board with the globalist plan
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.640]  to cut off our energy and to end fossil fuels.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.640]  Or again, the oceans are all going to rise and kill us.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.280]  They've been telling us that since the 80s.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.920]  Oh, by 1992, these islands will be underwater.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.400]  And those very islands are still there and the sea level hasn't gone up.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.920]  But here he is just pushing the constant agenda of fear
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.600]  that the world's collapsing, that things are going to hell
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.120]  as the globalists actually turn off all the resources and infrastructure
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.240]  to create the self-fulfilling prophecy,
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.760]  which they themselves will then be the saviors of.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.400]  So I'm going to play a short clip of Zelensky at the U.N.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.880]  We're going to go to break and tie it in with the biggest gaslighting lies
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.120]  I've ever seen from John Kerry,
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.840]  claiming China is the leader in saving the world from fossil fuels.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.440]  Wait till you hear this.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.440]  But first, Zelensky.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:41.200]  Even though humanity is failing on its climate policy objectives,
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:47.080]  this means that extreme weather will still impact the normal global life
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:53.160]  and some evil state will also weaponize its outcomes.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.640]  And when people in the streets of New York
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:02.120]  and other cities of the world went out on climate protests,
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.880]  we all have seen them.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.640]  And when people in Morocco and Libya
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.720]  and other countries die as a result of natural disasters,
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.880]  and when islands and countries disappear underwater
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:22.320]  and when tornadoes and deserts are spreading into new territories,
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.040]  and when all of this is happening,
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.960]  one unnatural disaster in Moscow decided to launch a big war
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.880]  and kill tens of thousands of people.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.120]  We have to stop it.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.520]  We must act united to defeat the aggressor
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:51.280]  and focus all our capabilities and energy on addressing these challenges.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.880]  As nukes are restrained,
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:59.680]  likewise the aggressor must be restrained at all his tools and methods of war.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.480]  Each war now can become final,
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:09.240]  but it takes our unity to make sure that aggression will not break in again.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.200]  And it is not a dialogue between the so-called great powers
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:19.480]  somewhere behind the closed doors that can guarantee us all the new wars era,
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.800]  but open war of all nations for peace.

[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:06.740]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:32.260]  and welcome back to this live original Sunday transmission I'm your host Alex Jones if you
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:37.100]  just joined us let me recap what we just covered the Russians have defeated NATO and the Ukrainians
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:42.140]  hands down but the globalist are using it as a giant destabilization tool and a money laundering
[00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:49.580]  tool and a cover for massive world starvation being accelerated by globalist policies cutting
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:57.260]  off energy and of course energy for plants the fertilizer and having three years of lockdowns the
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:02.340]  third world the IMF and World Bank policy over those captive nations now the third world's
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:10.900]  collapsing and flooding us via UN migration camps and replacement migration they now need to use the
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:16.980]  war in Ukraine as the pretext because it is causing some of the problem with the grain shortages to
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:22.740]  be blamed entirely on Russia claiming that the war that NATO started nine years ago there is the
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:28.260]  Russians fault and now all the starvation is caused simply by grain shortages and fertilizer
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:36.780]  shortages coming out of Ukraine when again that's still only less than 20% worldwide of the grain
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:44.540]  and similar number to the shortage in fertilizer but the overall fertilizer shortages are publicly
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:50.780]  being driven by the IMF and World Bank and those same WEF UN policies and they're the ones
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.820]  shutting off the pipelines they're the ones killing the oil and gas drilling permits they're
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:22:00.220]  the ones banning all over Europe and now in the u.s. all sorts of gas-powered machines
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:08.180]  and farm equipment and combustion engines so this is the post-industrial world the reason
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:12.540]  you've got Zelensky up there pushing this during his warmongering speech is because it's
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:19.500]  all part of the same agenda that is war against humanity to shut down the infrastructure and then
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:24.340]  again have the IMF the World Bank the big central banks the Black Rocks through their front
[00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:30.580]  group the UN come in and act as the saviors so now I want to go to the biggest gas lighting
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.580]  I've ever seen and then and that's saying a lot folks you know they've shown us polar
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:39.660]  bears sitting on top of a piece of floating ice and said they can't swim and they're all
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:45.340]  about to ground because the North Pole completely melted no the North Pole always gets about half
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.700]  as big as it is in the winter during the summer and that's when the polar bears get fat
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:54.900]  is in the summer and they hunt on the ice flows eating beluga whales and seals and
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:00.140]  things like that they're the farthest swimming land animal up to 200 miles they've been observed
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:05.060]  swimming non-stop from one ice flow to another they also say the penguins are all
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:11.060]  dying I mean there's been a lot of incredible lies but if you actually study the numbers
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:15.940]  since the 1950s there are five times their polar bears there were in the mid 1950s today
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:22.420]  the biggest population ever recorded but again I digress there's a lot of gaslighting Al Gore
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:27.740]  told us in the 90s and the 2000s that oh by the year 2007 the North and South Pole will
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:32.820]  be melted they're bigger than ever we've seen John Kerry say in the Senate he was a senator in
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:37.660]  the mid 2000s that within a few years the ice caps be totally melted or this island or that
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:43.500]  island would be completely flooded none of it came true it's all a fraud it's all a lie it's
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:48.780]  water vapor that controls the atmosphere with the Sun as the regulator okay the sun's the driver
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:55.100]  it's water vapor all the scientists know that carbon dioxide to trace gas but it's what plants
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:24:00.140]  breathe and what plants exhale is oxygen so now Al Gore the rest of them are saying
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:05.300]  cut down trees because they put off carbon dioxide as well this is an IQ test you're not
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:12.640]  stupid folks here is John Kerry on national television this week telling the world in a
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:18.840]  roundtable discussion that China has floods and China has hot weather and they know the
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.680]  world's basically ending and so they're the leader and the biggest producer of green
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:29.520]  products you know solar and electric cars and they're saving the planet solar is incredibly
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:35.160]  dirty to manufacture electric cars are incredibly dirty to manufacture this is a known fact and
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:40.760]  they are then powered by coal-powered plants all the solar in the world can't run the
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.480]  electric cars if they converted even half the cars in the world to electric so it's a bridge
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:50.639]  to nowhere it's incredibly dirty they want to get rid of cars in general but so they want to
[00:24:50.639 --> 00:24:57.160]  give you again a bridge to nowhere a false solution so you acquiesce to the industrialization
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:04.520]  de-industrialization program that they are running so here he is saying China is the
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:09.040]  leader no China is the leader with globalist owning and controlling the factories in China
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:15.560]  as a client state as a slave colony producing the most electric cars producing the majority
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:20.120]  of solar panels to be sold back to Europe and the United States I mean if we're gonna
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:26.400]  build these costly dirty things that we might as well build them here in the United States
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.720]  and they certainly have some uses and I'm not against solar and I'm not against electric the
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.400]  point is is they're way more expensive and way more toxic to make with their giant
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.400]  horrible lithium and cadmium and nickel and copper mines but again ladies and gentlemen
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.880]  they think you're stupid they think you don't know how the world really works so I want you
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:51.320]  to listen to this incredible gas lighting from John Kerry it's a short clip so I'm gonna play
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:57.680]  it two times back-to-back you can hear this and really let this burn in China's building
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:02.320]  three new coal-powered plants a week China has produced tens of millions of electric cars
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.520]  and dumped them on the world market they blow up they burn they're the crappiest electric
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.600]  cars ever most electric cars have serious problems a lot of them blow up but the Chinese
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.840]  cars are literally ticking time bombs they blowing up every few hours I mean it's all
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:23.960]  over the news it's just totally insane you've got the driverless cars in Austin Texas and San
[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:31.000]  Francisco causing traffic jams every day it's all meant to disrupt human society so I'm
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.680]  ranting here because everything that comes out of these people's mouths is a lie polar
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.720]  bears aren't dying they're exploding polar bears the greatest land animal swimmer there
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.200]  are the eyes captured bigger than ever well there's new reports out Oh Antarctica
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.760]  has plants for the first time I've read naval histories I got into this like 20
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:53.720]  years ago by the British and the French and they described the first missions down there by
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:59.600]  whalers and they described times when as far as the eye could see Antarctica was grass in
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:05.240]  the areas that are land-based part of its mountainous region the plants have always been there
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.800]  there's at least five plant species there but they think that you don't know that so they go
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:15.240]  oh look everything's melting there's flowers in the Arctic there's always been flowers in the
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:22.560]  Arctic but I digress ignorance is their key to taking over information is the key to being
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.720]  free those that do not know history are doomed to repeat it there's the Bible says my people
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:32.120]  perish for lack of knowledge so here's John Kerry and the ultimate gaslighting back-to-back
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.720]  saying China is the leader in the environment they're the biggest carbon producer which is
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.880]  not a problem but they're also the biggest toxic waste producer which is a problem and the
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.639]  most wild out of control genetic engineer operation on the planet as well here's the clip back
[00:27:45.639 --> 00:27:53.360]  to back out building everybody in renewable energy and they're deploying that energy at home
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:59.840]  and literally China is now deploying and manufacturing more than all the rest of the
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:05.639]  world put together so China's made a decision they had 52 degrees centigrade that last summer
[00:28:05.639 --> 00:28:12.400]  they've had people dying because of the floods in China so our hope is that we can you know
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:18.760]  depoliticize this issue at least it's a universal threat we all need to be engaged in
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:25.000]  this we need China and we hope we can work with China in this so let's just out building
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.360]  everybody in renewable energy and they're deploying that energy at home and literally China
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:38.720]  is now deploying and manufacturing more than all the rest of the world put together so
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.360]  China's made a decision they had 52 degrees centigrade that last summer they've had people
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:50.480]  dying because of the floods in China so our hope is that we can you know depoliticize this
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:57.240]  issue at least it's a universal threat we all need to be engaged in this we need China and
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:01.400]  we hope we can work with China don't lie down and take it spread the word about this

[00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:06.950]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones
[00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:38.630]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one
[00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:54.630]  and we are back on this live Sunday transmission again I'm your host Alex Jones very honored and blessed that you're here I get pretty angry when I start laying all these facts out because this is economic warfare this is siege 101
[00:33:54.630 --> 00:34:16.630]  here you say China's leading the world in green energy well not for themselves they're exporting it to us it's expensive and doesn't work overall and of course is then powered by carbon generating factories here in the United States which are so called leaders are busy shutting down so there won't be any power for your electric car and then of course we have
[00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:36.630]  Zelinski saying the most important thing is quote saving the environment that means handing all control over to BlackRock and the ESG's and their plan this is all interconnected remember the system isn't broken the system is predatory designed to break you we have to take the system back
[00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:56.630]  now there's a very popular professor I've wanted to get him on for years we're gonna really push to get him on Peter St. Onage if I pronounced that right I guess it's French PhD's big professor works with Von Mies Institute but he's also extremely articulate and so I want to play several clips of him from his Twitter site that are going mega viral
[00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:19.630]  he points out that he's a guy with a computer and he's getting three four million views per video and CNN gets 50,000 views per video now and of course CNN has the lowest ratings ever recorded I just want to point that out that they're not just the dinosaur media they're the zombie media they're dead almost no one's watching it but it's still a government deep state channel with their talking points
[00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:48.630]  so it's important to be aware of what they're up to but I digress let's get into his first video that ties it all together is the green revolution creating a dozen opex green tech is turning the West into an economic colony of China and the bricks the problem is green techs are built on some of the very dirtiest things cobalt nickel lithium copper green activists are chasing all of them overseas where those carbon footprints are out of mind
[00:35:48.630 --> 00:36:17.630]  that's right so China's ramping up its carbon which is fine except it makes us dependent because we're only allowed to use the quote green energy that's not green and we're completely dependent not just on Chinese slave goods now but on our very energy system so you can see how we're being held hostage the result is levels of dependence OPEC could only dream of just a handful of bricks countries control the majority of those inputs to make the so called green products
[00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:42.630]  remember China has 90 plus percent control 97 percent control of rare earth minerals that's because of any Western country or company tries to go explore them the green organizations of the UN and the regulators come in and sue them into oblivion and claim they're using slave labor but if China wants to use real slave labor and move it anywhere and be as toxic as they want to be
[00:36:43.630 --> 00:37:05.630]  and leech these elements out of the rocks using cyanide and just stuff that'll blow your mind with huge floods and dams breaking and toxifying and polluting whole regions using real slave labor that's okay that's liberal that's trendy so here he is in a very important three and a half minute video laying this fact out
[00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:34.630]  so when you see left is promoting the quote green agenda has nothing to do with rich and it has to do with an agenda of energy that via regulations are only allowed to be produced in China because they're so toxic in their production then shipped back over here to us making us totally dependent and of course the globalist own large percentages in those manufacturing facilities in China in India in Mexico and so they're the middlemen that make the majority of the profit not even the communist Chinese or their slaves so here is the professor laying it out
[00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:43.630]  the green revolution is turning the West into an economic colony of China and a rogues gallery of dictators from all over the world
[00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:55.630]  recently the Wall Street Journal reported that the green energy push is forcing the US and Europe into a dependent relationship with authoritarian regimes that makes OPEC look like an amateur
[00:37:55.630 --> 00:38:05.630]  this could effectively hand especially the BRICS group of anti dollar countries a natural resources veto on America indeed on the entire West
[00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:17.630]  the problem is that the key ingredients in green tech are all dug out of the ground dug out with the kind of carbon footprints that send our ruling left wing activists into panic attacks
[00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:27.630]  cobalt, nickel, lithium and copper are what batteries are made of and without batteries an electric vehicle, windmill or solar field is a very expensive paperweight
[00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:38.630]  to give a sense of the problem Saudi Arabia accounts for 12% of global oil production and OPEC as a whole is 38% throw in Russia and it's close to half
[00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:45.630]  meanwhile in nickel just two countries Indonesia and Russia make up 27% of global production
[00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:52.630]  for lithium new BRICS member Argentina and Chile account for 43% of global production
[00:38:53.630 --> 00:39:00.630]  for cobalt again two countries Indonesia and Congo make up 51% of global production
[00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:05.630]  downstream where the raw materials are refined for actual use it's even worse
[00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:13.630]  China alone refines 42% of the world's copper, 65% of its lithium, 70% of the world's cobalt
[00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:17.630]  China has already weaponized rare earths and it is eager for more
[00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:23.630]  note that thanks to trillion dollar green subsidies they are green dollars as well
[00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:29.630]  demand for these critical materials is expected to soar 23 fold in the next 12 years
[00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:36.630]  for a sense of perspective it takes 15 years to stand up a copper mine in the US if you can get it permitted
[00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:42.630]  so how did things get so bad because for decades America and Europe have chased out mining and refining
[00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:47.630]  sending it overseas where those carbon footprints are out of sight and out of mind
[00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:53.630]  so they can pretend it doesn't exist and brag about their clean economies and impressive footprints
[00:39:54.630 --> 00:40:00.630]  of course refining cobalt in China or digging it up in Congo are just as dirty as doing it in the US or Europe
[00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:05.630]  quite likely dirtier but optics are everything when it comes to being green
[00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:13.630]  the problem comes in because we are potentially handing a dozen OPEX to countries that don't particularly like us very much
[00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:17.630]  China already holds a virtual materials veto over parts of the American economy
[00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:25.630]  and forcing more of our industrial base and energy production into green technologies that depend on China's good graces
[00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:32.630]  is a recipe for becoming dependent on a country that is already actively hostile
[00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:34.630]  so what's next brought to you by Unchained
[00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:40.630]  what's next is it gets worse both America and Europe are doubling down on the unicorn fart utopias
[00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:49.630]  chasing out what remains of not just mining and refining but the manufacturing that remains a stain on their virtuous carbon footprints
[00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:56.630]  I did a recent video on Germany deindustrializing and it is happening across the west including here in America
[00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:04.630]  where the United Auto Workers are currently striking specifically because green mandates are sending production to China
[00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:09.630]  where it will become yet another leverage point for the dictators in Beijing
[00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:12.630]  ok we'll be watching see you next time
[00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:21.470]  and that's professor Peter St. Onage doing a splendid job breaking down the
[00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:28.470]  reality just like me he talks fast because if I slow down my brains moving
[00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:32.630]  too quick if I slow down my brain jumps ahead of me and so we've just got so
[00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:36.710]  much knowledge and so much Intel it's hard to get it out in the spoken word
[00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:39.830]  it's easier just to write it down but so many people don't read so it's
[00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:43.470]  important for us to speak but I would challenge listeners to take that three
[00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:47.270]  and a half minute clip and every five seconds take everything he says and
[00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:51.630]  write down the term he says and then look up that term or look up that statement
[00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:55.549]  I know most of you understand what he said but but but what he's saying is
[00:41:55.549 --> 00:41:59.670]  is piercingly powerful and dead-on when you connect it all together so I
[00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:04.390]  challenge everybody to take what he said because that's a year-long course
[00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:08.430]  on high-level economics and economic warfare he just said three and a half
[00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:12.310]  minutes and it's the heart of the globalist takeover so just like with
[00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:17.390]  my show and what I say you can take terms I say take documents I talk about like
[00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:21.670]  if I say State Department Miranda 200 look it up that's a week of research
[00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:26.390]  it's incredible or if I say State Department Miranda 7277 wow that's the
[00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:31.130]  whole UN takeover of the world I mean this is all critical by the way
[00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:35.830]  speaking of UN takeover of the world Jack Smith's the former head UN war
[00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:40.350]  crimes prosecutor now he's hired his deputy another war crimes prosecutor that
[00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:45.590]  ran the UN persecution of the Serbs to be his deputy going after Trump and the
[00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:50.230]  criminal prosecutions I mean this is just literally a UN takeover the UN
[00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:55.790]  with a UN treaty over energy the UN with a treaty over our medical care I
[00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:59.630]  mean it's just it's it's the UN not taking over with soldiers and blue
[00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:05.350]  helmets taking over through the corporate bureaucracy but I digress the
[00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:09.549]  reason people turn to the show is we give you tomorrow's news today by
[00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:13.470]  showing how the globalist have all these different agendas and they admit
[00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:19.830]  working in concert to bring you to a post-industrial starvation level to
[00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:24.830]  then dictate the terms of your surrender so here is the professor
[00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:30.990]  talking about the food deserts in San Francisco in Chicago in New York where
[00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:35.190]  they are purposely defunding the police purposely allowing people to commit
[00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:39.029]  crimes via the Soros prosecutors that don't even have people arrested now much
[00:43:39.029 --> 00:43:45.350]  less turn them loose and it is designed to bring us into a Soviet model and now
[00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:49.029]  that the criminals like locusts have destroyed the blue cities they're now
[00:43:49.029 --> 00:43:53.710]  moving out into the suburbs that's why the globalists want our guns so
[00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:56.790]  that their criminals can go out and terrorize us in a submission without
[00:43:56.790 --> 00:44:01.350]  being resisted and that's why the Second Amendment is so critical on so
[00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:04.950]  many levels so here's the professor breaking down the food deserts and
[00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:08.910]  what's happening in Chicago as Chicago says they're gonna set up governments
[00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:15.190]  stores that's right I owe my soul to the company store this is true
[00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:21.630]  slavery and a master plan being rolled out now the city of Chicago as usual is
[00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:26.549]  plumbing innovative depths of Klondom with a proposal to build government
[00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:31.630]  grocery stores since the real grocery stores are fleeing the city due to
[00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:37.150]  predatory taxes predatory mandates and of course predatory shoplifters who are
[00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:40.830]  doing the hard work of destabilizing American cities to usher in the
[00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:44.950]  revolution Chicago's mayor exploring the possibility of city-owned grocery
[00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:48.270]  stores in some windy city neighborhoods mayor Brandon Johnson
[00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:51.990]  believes this will provide relief for communities without quality grocery
[00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:56.470]  stores living in those so-called food deserts the plan is part of Chicago
[00:44:56.470 --> 00:45:00.990]  mayor and unironic socialist Brandon Johnson's quote whole of government
[00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:05.509]  approach to address inequalities which suggests everything will be free but then
[00:45:05.509 --> 00:45:09.910]  of course everything in Chicago stores is free with a little creativity the
[00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:13.830]  mayor will be partnering with the economic security project is a
[00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:18.230]  nonprofit meaning it's government funded to take over for abandoned
[00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:23.110]  Walmart's he also hinted that he'll have subsidies from Joe Biden which
[00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:27.509]  means all Americans will get to join in and fund Chicago's whole of
[00:45:27.509 --> 00:45:31.470]  government approach we could see a lot more of this since it turns out
[00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:36.150]  that tolerating industrial scale looting and shoplifting oddly enough
[00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:41.109]  leads to cities with no grocery stores major chains are already exiting
[00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:46.190]  Washington DC Philadelphia New York Los Angeles and of course San Francisco
[00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:51.670]  expect more Looney Tunes from the gang as they try to keep grocery
[00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:56.109]  stores without arresting the people burning them it is worth noting that
[00:45:56.109 --> 00:46:00.990]  the Soviet Union did try this and it got widespread food shortages it turns
[00:46:01.029 --> 00:46:05.470]  out free stuff means no stuff or as Milton Friedman put it quote if you
[00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:09.069]  put the government in charge of the Sahara Desert in five years there
[00:46:09.069 --> 00:46:15.509]  would be a shortage of sand of course the Soviet Union shot shoplifters so
[00:46:15.509 --> 00:46:20.029]  we can imagine how Soviet grocery stores that welcome shoplifters will
[00:46:20.029 --> 00:46:24.830]  turn out I would think they could actually just skip building the store
[00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:28.190]  part of it and just leave the delivery trucks open overnight to move the
[00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:32.750]  inventory faster now Chicago already has failing schools failing health
[00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:36.710]  care and of course failing public safety and it does all of that with
[00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:40.710]  a five hundred and thirty eight million dollar budget deficit which
[00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:46.190]  is about to get bigger as Chicago's finest take on the food supply the
[00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:49.950]  general rule of thumb in government is if you want a problem to get
[00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:54.470]  bigger have the government fix it by that rule it's about to get a lot
[00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:59.310]  harder to find food in Chicago at some point you're down to Amazon and Uber
[00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:03.910]  eats at least until the drivers get robbed enough so what's next brought
[00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:08.710]  to you by Unchained what's next is at some point in theory voters will
[00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:14.750]  rebel alas America's pockmark with cities where they did not instead
[00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:20.390]  those who could flee did flee leaving the inner cities to spiral into post
[00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:26.109]  apocalyptic hellscapes between fortified elections and a regime media whose job
[00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:32.430]  is to sugarcoat spin and hide what is happening the few voters with their
[00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:38.230]  eyes open could miss their chance to save the city's this hey we'll be
[00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:42.830]  watching see you next time an excellent breakdown by the professor now let's go
[00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:47.150]  to what he wrote about this on Twitter mayor of Chicago announces city run
[00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:50.830]  grocery stores replaced the real ones fleeing the city due to predatory city
[00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:55.350]  government collapsing social order and industrial scale shoplifting it's worth
[00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:59.230]  noting that the Soviets tried this and got food shortages and they put
[00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:03.069]  shoplifters in the gulag well the globalist leftist from King Charles
[00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:06.750]  down to the Extinction Rebellion have said they want to create artificial
[00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:11.430]  scarcity which they're doing Chicago already has failing schools failing
[00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:16.069]  health care and of course failing public safety it could get a lot harder
[00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:21.029]  to find food the city true you can always get Uber eats at least until the
[00:48:21.029 --> 00:48:25.590]  drivers get robbed enough times in theory at some point the voters rebel
[00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:31.190]  in reality many once great American cities they missed their chance yeah
[00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:35.230]  plus election fraud these are all little mini dictatorships and now we're
[00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:38.870]  gonna shift gears into the last piece of this big puzzle today and
[00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:43.830]  that's the puppet Biden admitting he's broken the border admitting he told
[00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:47.590]  people to immediately surge if he quote won the election slash stole the
[00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:51.590]  election and that the answer is capitulating and completely opening the
[00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:55.509]  border and then the feds will come into the cities and federalize them
[00:48:55.509 --> 00:48:59.990]  with federal troops federal grocery stores and our journey into total
[00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:07.150]  slavery will be complete here is Joe Biden just a few days ago first we
[00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:12.470]  put in place policies that process people on a fair and fast way second
[00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:16.390]  we're significantly expanding legal pathways for entry so businesses can
[00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:20.150]  get the workers they need families don't have to wait for a decade to be
[00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:25.190]  together I've also directed my team to make historic increase in the number
[00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:29.830]  of refugees admitted from Latin America people fleeing violence and
[00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:34.950]  persecution we simply want the kids to have a better life next week my
[00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:40.150]  team will consult with Congress on this plan third for supporting states
[00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:45.190]  and cities that have seen a surge in immigrants we've developed federal
[00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:50.630]  experts deployed them to help train city workers we've launched outreach
[00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:55.029]  campaigns helping over a million eligible migrants apply for work
[00:49:55.029 --> 00:49:58.870]  permits and we're accelerating the process for work permit application
[00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:03.990]  right now most migrants have to wait six months after filing the claim
[00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:08.870]  before they can go to work only Congress can change that but the
[00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:12.390]  Secretary of Homeland Security can take extraordinary action yesterday
[00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:16.470]  given the poor conditions in Venezuela Secretary Mayorkas
[00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:18.870]  announced temporary protection for hundreds of thousands of
[00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:24.790]  Venezuela already in this country in the same speech that we just
[00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:30.150]  played an excerpt of Joe Biden then blamed Trump for the quote
[00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:34.950]  border crisis that Biden and the UN directed even before again he
[00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:39.029]  got selected Biden said if I win immediately surge the
[00:50:39.029 --> 00:50:42.310]  border so Biden has now unveiled his plan for the border
[00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:46.310]  crisis fast track processing at the US border expanded legal
[00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:49.350]  pathways for citizenship increase the total number of refugees
[00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:52.950]  send money to help the sanctuary cities speed up work
[00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:56.790]  permits for illegals and of course organize the illegals
[00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:59.350]  into voting blocks and give them driver's license which
[00:50:59.350 --> 00:51:02.550]  they're already doing everywhere while of course denying that
[00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:05.750]  they're election meddling in any way as they try to put in
[00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:08.950]  jail anyone that points out the open election fraud is
[00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:12.630]  taking place the good news is America is waking up the
[00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:15.590]  good news is Europe's waking up the good news is the
[00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:17.830]  globalists admit they're in trouble they're even pulling
[00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:21.270]  back their ESG operation at least the name so we've got
[00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:23.990]  to really push hard here just like we did with the
[00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:26.310]  new lockdowns you notice they're having big problems
[00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:29.350]  getting it done even though they've tried that's the

[00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:18.550]  immeasurable might of the globalists tune in and

[00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:37.590]  and share the links at infowars.com forward slash show
[00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:49.350]  all right we are now inside the info wars world headquarters coming to you
[00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:55.750]  live on this sunday and while I do take over the
[00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:58.870]  transmission we are going to be hearing again from
[00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:04.870]  Alex on a very serious issue a little outside of the lines if you
[00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:08.550]  will discussing the will to live the will to
[00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:12.230]  survive and how past civilizations when they
[00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:18.550]  lose that will that desire that instinct they are no more they fall
[00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:21.590]  and so this whole trend going with the fall
[00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:28.390]  of Rome which is ironic it's this internet trend where girls
[00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.750]  ask their boyfriend or their husband or whatever how often do you think about
[00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:35.029]  the Roman Empire the fall of Rome but
[00:54:35.029 --> 00:54:38.230]  it's this internet trend and nobody really understands what's
[00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:41.990]  actually behind it why is the fall of Rome
[00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:45.029]  significant why was the Roman Empire even able
[00:54:45.029 --> 00:54:51.590]  to fall and so Alex is going to break all of that down coming up in
[00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:54.790]  the next hour and of course I will be with you for
[00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:59.029]  Infowars Sunday Night Live we do intend to take a lot of phone calls
[00:54:59.029 --> 00:55:00.950]  but let me tell you what we have coming up because this is very
[00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:04.230]  important as well I'll get a little bit political with
[00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:06.630]  you tonight and then Alex is going to get a little bit
[00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:09.990]  outside the lines existential if you will
[00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:16.470]  and then we'll take your phone calls there is this looming quote-unquote
[00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:21.830]  government shutdown and there's only a few individuals who really understand
[00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:28.470]  how to approach this politically and that of course is Matt Gates
[00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:32.550]  who we're going to be hearing from and then presidential candidate Vivek
[00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:36.550]  Ramaswamy now I think Vivek has the complete right attitude on this
[00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:39.990]  saying why aren't we embracing a government shutdown
[00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:43.109]  why aren't we promoting a government shutdown when the democrats
[00:55:43.109 --> 00:55:48.069]  lie and it is a lie and say oh the republicans are responsible for
[00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:50.550]  every government shutdown folks you can go do the research the
[00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:53.990]  democrats have been in control of the house and congress for multiple
[00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:56.550]  government shutdowns so they just outright lie to you but
[00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:59.430]  that's part for the course you cannot be a democrat unless you're
[00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:02.390]  willing to lie to the American people it's not
[00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:05.990]  even a will you have to lie to the American people they tell you
[00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:10.150]  the border is secure Joe Biden just set a record for any
[00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:13.750]  presidential administration for most illegal border crossings in a month
[00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:16.790]  and then Karine Jean Pierre tells you the border is secure and Kamala Harris
[00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:21.190]  of course is the border czar she's never been down there but I'm
[00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:24.150]  going to play an interview for Matt Gates in its entirety because
[00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:27.109]  it's important for Matt Gates to break this down and it's important for
[00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:30.390]  us to give Matt Gates a platform right now
[00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:35.109]  because the empty suit Mitch McConnell has been beyond a failure
[00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:38.470]  and I would even argue at this point that he's working for
[00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:44.230]  the democrats so we've got a break coming up in 60 seconds it's a short
[00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:47.750]  break then in the five minute short segment
[00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:50.870]  I'm going to explain why I believe Mitch McConnell is now working for the
[00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:54.470]  democrats and perhaps always was and then we're going to
[00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:59.509]  play a full segment of Matt Gates responding to some of the
[00:56:59.509 --> 00:57:03.029]  weak-kneed republicans when it comes to this government
[00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:06.630]  shutdown and and so to be clear he's going to be
[00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:10.470]  attacking Jim Jordan a little bit here now I think Jim Jordan has done a lot
[00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:13.670]  better than his predecessors when it comes to house
[00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:18.069]  oversight and judiciary is concerned but we're still not where we need to
[00:57:18.069 --> 00:57:21.590]  be and so Matt Gates is putting the pressure
[00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:25.190]  and trying to move the ball up field and I'm going to explain all that when
[00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:28.150]  we come back from this break and then we're going to be hearing from Matt
[00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:31.029]  Gates but I'm going to tell you I think Kevin McCarthy is actually
[00:57:31.029 --> 00:57:36.230]  working for Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi and the democrats and then
[00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:39.190]  you're going to hear from Matt Gates on this looming government shutdown
[00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:42.950]  who as far as I'm concerned has had the only right take on this

[01:00:55.189 --> 01:00:58.870]  show and share the link today
[01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:06.310]  all right when we come back in the next segment i'm going to play an
[01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:09.029]  entire interview of matt gates with maria barcharomo
[01:01:09.029 --> 01:01:13.109]  and it's important to give matt gates the platform here
[01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:16.870]  because a he's the real leader of the house republicans
[01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:20.069]  kevin mccarthy's proven himself an empty suit if not working for the
[01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:21.910]  democrats and i'm going to explain that
[01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:25.350]  and it's time to build matt gates political capital and you notice that
[01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:28.390]  rana romney mcdaniel is nowhere to be
[01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:31.590]  found and so there is no strategizing there is no leadership in
[01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:35.350]  the gop and rana romney mcdaniel and kevin
[01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:38.710]  mccarthy are responsible for this lack of strategy
[01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:43.590]  this lack of foresight this lack of vision
[01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:47.830]  and this lack of action so we've got to build matt gates political capital he
[01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:50.950]  needs to be a household name he needs to be the next speaker of the house
[01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:54.390]  but let me explain aside from rana romney mcdaniel
[01:01:54.390 --> 01:02:00.710]  and and the missing in action gop chair that she's been everybody
[01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:04.950]  could have seen that coming of course mitt romney is going to be
[01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:07.430]  stepping down there's a victory for us but it's
[01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:12.149]  time for rana romney mcdaniel to be next i now believe kevin mccarthy is
[01:02:12.149 --> 01:02:16.630]  working for the democrat party now i didn't want kevin mccarthy to be
[01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:20.069]  speaker house because i anticipated this is exactly how it would go
[01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:23.910]  but he's been an empty suit he hasn't fulfilled any of his promises
[01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:28.390]  and at first i thought the only reason he was filing articles of impeachment
[01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:31.510]  now is because he wanted to gain some
[01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:34.870]  points he wanted to score some points on the board because he's got a big fat
[01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:39.990]  egg he's got a big fat zero as far as political points are concerned
[01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:43.189]  from kevin mccarthy he's been an empty suit as speaker of the house
[01:02:43.189 --> 01:02:46.870]  and he fought so hard for it and he made so many promises
[01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:51.029]  and what's he done since nothing he fought like hell to become speaker of
[01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:54.870]  the house and now he's laid down like a little bitch
[01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:59.830]  but now i actually think kevin mccarthy is working for the democrats
[01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:02.950]  let me explain why
[01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:06.390]  i think it's clear at this point that the american left
[01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:09.590]  and the democrats are ready to move on from joe biden
[01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:12.950]  now this is not going to be a smooth transition
[01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:16.230]  but i think it's pretty clear the media is now coming for biden
[01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:21.350]  and all the hunter biden problems and all the joe biden quid pro quo problems
[01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:25.350]  are are going to come home to roost it's unavoidable
[01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:31.430]  not to mention his physical and mental decline which is going to get more
[01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:34.870]  and more obvious and the embarrassment on the
[01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:39.510]  international stage which is only going to get even worse
[01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:44.710]  with the disrespect and the geopolitical disadvantage
[01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:52.870]  that he brings our country so what a perfect time
[01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:57.430]  after all these years for kevin mccarthy to file articles of impeachment
[01:03:57.430 --> 01:04:02.630]  ride along when the democrats are ready to move him out of the way
[01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:07.430]  just about all the evidence we needed there's been some new evidence coming
[01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:11.670]  forward when it comes to the biden crime family allegations but all the
[01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:14.950]  evidence was already there for an impeachment inquiry to move
[01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:17.670]  forward or a special counsel to move forward
[01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:23.830]  and kevin mccarthy did nothing so why is he doing it now because the
[01:04:23.830 --> 01:04:27.350]  democrats need some help to get joe biden out of the way but
[01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:30.790]  they don't want to do it themselves they want someone else to do it for
[01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:33.109]  them and in this process they're going to
[01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:37.910]  stab rfk jr in the back which is only going to hurt them
[01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:41.910]  politically but that's an entire different issue so let's give the real
[01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:44.550]  speaker of the house let's give the real leader of house
[01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:46.790]  republicans the platform when we come back
[01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:50.710]  maria barcharomo interviews matt gates i think it's very important to play
[01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:59.590]  this and we'll respond on the other side
[01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:02.790]  info war store.com is like a grocery store
[01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:06.710]  or like a vitamin shop we want to have all the best brands we want to
[01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:08.310]  have a bunch of different choices for you
[01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:12.470]  so i get constant questions online in person hey what's better knockout
[01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:16.310]  what's better down and out what's better why do you sell two or three different
[01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:19.430]  sleep eggs and the answer is different herbal
[01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:23.029]  formulas different compounds are better for different people
[01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:26.950]  so one person might like this coffee another person likes that coffee
[01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:30.230]  that's how our bodies work they're all very diverse but we've been able
[01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:32.710]  to private label a national best seller

[01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:09.990]  so kevin mccay uh kevin mccarthy has been an empty suit
[01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:14.310]  as speaker of the house he didn't fulfill any of his promises he hasn't
[01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:18.230]  been a leader at all even though he fought for that position
[01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:22.069]  so hard tooth and nail he was scratching to become speaker of the house
[01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:23.990]  and then he gets it and does what with it how about
[01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:27.910]  nothing now he wants to score political points
[01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:31.670]  by launching an impeachment inquiry but i now believe that's because he's working
[01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:34.550]  for the democrats and this has been on the democrats
[01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:37.910]  timetable that now they want to remove biden and replace him with either
[01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:42.310]  gavin newson who said he wasn't running or maybe big mike obama steps in no they
[01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:45.029]  don't want rfk junior he's anti-establishment he's against the
[01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:47.990]  military industrial complex he's against the pharmaceutical industrial
[01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:51.350]  complex so their unit party corrupt dc isn't interested in him so
[01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:55.109]  here's maria barcharomo right after interviewing jim jordan
[01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:59.990]  matt gates brings the heat on sunday morning futures
[01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:03.350]  now joining us one of the people holding up an agreement
[01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:07.109]  to fund the government florida republican congressman matt gates
[01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:10.149]  congressman thank you very much for being here this morning
[01:07:10.149 --> 01:07:13.189]  well thank you i i'm glad i get to respond to your monologue because if
[01:07:13.189 --> 01:07:16.149]  you're saying that i'm standing in the way of all the republican wins
[01:07:16.149 --> 01:07:19.990]  i'd love you to enumerate them watching my friend and mentor jim jordan
[01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:22.630]  it was it was quite painful because he started by saying
[01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:25.910]  we should only pick one fight the border but then as the interview went
[01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:28.470]  on he said we should pick a second fight jack smith
[01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:30.950]  and by the time the interview rounded out he was saying that we shouldn't be
[01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:34.630]  funding ukraine without a plan and yet the very continuing resolution that
[01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:37.510]  you and jim jordan seem to be four continues to have three hundred
[01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:41.430]  million dollars more for ukraine so i think we ought to fight on all fronts
[01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:44.630]  i think the border is very important and the best way for us to advance
[01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:47.830]  republican border policies is to pass the department of homeland
[01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:51.990]  security appropriations bill do that along with veterans defense ag
[01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:54.230]  state and foreign ops will have seventy three percent of the
[01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:57.590]  discretionary uh... budget funded and if you know the department of labor
[01:07:57.590 --> 01:08:00.710]  and education have to shut down for a few days as we get their
[01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:03.910]  appropriations in line and that's certainly not something that is
[01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:08.069]  is it uh... optimal but i think it's better than continuing on the current
[01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:10.550]  path we are to america's financial ruin
[01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:13.830]  cars and i understand and that is why you are on this program this morning
[01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:17.190]  because i want to give you a fair shot and i want to get your view to
[01:08:17.190 --> 01:08:21.990]  heard as a tell me why you are threatening speaker mccarthy and trying
[01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:25.910]  to shut down this government at a time that the republicans have finally
[01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:28.230]  gotten some upper hands here
[01:08:28.230 --> 01:08:32.389]  uh... in terms of wins able to investigate president biden on what
[01:08:32.389 --> 01:08:33.350]  looks like
[01:08:33.350 --> 01:08:34.710]  uh... bribery
[01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:38.150]  it we don't put our pencils down in the investigation of president biden
[01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:42.110]  during a shutdown so the premise is false second if kevin mccarthy was
[01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:45.430]  actually serious about pursuing the biden's he would have sent hunter
[01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:49.030]  biden a subpoena by now that's how you know this is sort of failure
[01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:52.470]  theater that you're observing at the end during the first year of democrat
[01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:55.750]  control of the congress they brought in donald trump junior three times
[01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:59.710]  over nothing over and nothing burger and so we seem to be fundamentally
[01:08:59.710 --> 01:09:03.750]  unserious in our oversight but what is serious is the fact that we are spending
[01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:06.870]  more than seven trillion dollars a year bringing in around five trillion
[01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:10.350]  dollars a year and uh... it i want to fund the government i'm not pro
[01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:14.110]  shutdown but the way to fund the government is not the same way we've
[01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:17.910]  been doing it since not the mid nineties words one upper down vote on the
[01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:21.910]  entire government all at once we should have separate single-subject spending
[01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:26.750]  bills kevin mccarthy promised that in january he is in breach of that promise
[01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:27.790]  so i'm not here
[01:09:27.790 --> 01:09:31.910]  so hold the government hostage i'm here hold kevin mccarthy to his word
[01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:37.070]  are there freedom caucus members also out of compliance they were also on the
[01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:41.710]  appropriations committee where is the responsibility for them are they also
[01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:43.430]  out of compliance
[01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:46.150]  no other i'm not a member of the freedom caucus all of them speak for
[01:09:46.150 --> 01:09:49.570]  themselves but take for example the border this issue you think is has
[01:09:49.570 --> 01:09:51.470]  great primacy and i would agree with you
[01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:55.550]  the department of homeland security appropriations bill was passed out of
[01:09:55.550 --> 01:10:00.230]  the appropriations committee in june and yet kevin mccarthy has it put it
[01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:04.990]  on the floor in more than a hundred days that is not serious you know why
[01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:08.850]  kevin mccarthy didn't move our border appropriations bill because the
[01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:13.430]  lobbyists and the special interests who own kevin mccarthy wanna put us in this
[01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:17.790]  position where were backed up against the wall facing shutdown politics and
[01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:22.490]  what that does it centralizes power to the people that they buy off with
[01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:26.510]  packed donations and lobbyists donations and then the membership
[01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:30.550]  doesn't get tired real real real contributions to that process i'm trying
[01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:31.850]  to democratize it
[01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:36.110]  the bills are being worked on you just heard jim jordan say that they
[01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:40.430]  are affording four bills this week appropriations bills this week to get
[01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:43.190]  through that would partially fund the government
[01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:47.790]  uh... the defense bill as well you wanted the defense bill to move forward
[01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:49.170]  did you not
[01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:53.030]  yes that's why i voted for it and i voted for the rule to proceed on to it
[01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:54.190]  and by the way
[01:10:54.190 --> 01:10:56.950]  don't give kevin mccarthy credit for the fact that we're moving on to
[01:10:56.950 --> 01:11:00.470]  these four appropriations bills that was the deal that house conservatives
[01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:04.110]  foisted upon kevin mccarthy when he couldn't just move the big spending
[01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:07.889]  bills without moving the bills that cut spending we said no no no you have to
[01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:11.130]  move bills like the state and foreign ops bill because we don't think we
[01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:16.010]  should be borrowing money from china to go fund gay pride parades in prague or
[01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:20.210]  lgbtq uh... you know seminars in indonesia we don't think that that's a
[01:11:20.210 --> 01:11:24.010]  good use of our money and i only way to do this for you is a line by line
[01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:27.610]  kevin wants it in one big up or down vote keep the government open shut
[01:11:27.610 --> 01:11:30.730]  it down i'm saying single subject spending bills it's the only way to
[01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:33.770]  break the fever and liberate ourselves from this out of control spending well
[01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:37.290]  he's doing the four bills next week so we're making is
[01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:42.330]  we're making it so it's a portion out to blow up all of the wins that you all
[01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:44.530]  have had now which means
[01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:48.250]  please enumerate the okay well how about the fact that he has set up a
[01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:52.290]  weaponization committee to investigate the dlj whether they're involved in a
[01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:54.889]  cover-up that's why i think he has gone on
[01:11:54.889 --> 01:11:56.090]  we're going to get
[01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:56.730]  hold on
[01:11:56.730 --> 01:12:00.050]  how about the fact that he has set up the china select committee to keep
[01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:04.610]  china to account and of course he has launched this inquiry into
[01:12:04.610 --> 01:12:07.250]  impeachment potentially for president
[01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:09.330]  is that not what you want
[01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:13.170]  none of those things are deliverables those are steps in a process that
[01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:14.690]  setting up a committee
[01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:19.170]  is an end unto itself only in washington d c the american people demand
[01:12:19.170 --> 01:12:22.970]  results although i want to talk about these these committees have done
[01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:24.889]  nothing to reduce inflation
[01:12:24.889 --> 01:12:27.970]  they've done nothing to actually constrain the biden government we can
[01:12:27.970 --> 01:12:31.490]  set up committees and have hearings and yell at people but at the end of
[01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:33.650]  the day if we still send the check
[01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:35.650]  to fund a weaponized government
[01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:40.050]  having a weaponization subcommittee is little relief to the american people
[01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:44.210]  and if any of this was serious we would be sending out subpoenas and
[01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:48.210]  compelling process the way the january sixth committee did we should be
[01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:51.490]  operating like them instead we're playing patty cake
[01:12:51.490 --> 01:12:55.170]  with the biden's were allowed to get away with it and we're funding it
[01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:58.610]  we're sending the money if we were serious use the power of the purse
[01:12:58.610 --> 01:13:03.570]  the speaker joined me a week ago and told me that he will in fact subpoena
[01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:07.970]  hunter biden he said at the appropriate time but let's be clear eight months
[01:13:07.970 --> 01:13:10.930]  where do you think the appropriate time is how many months should the
[01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:13.970]  american people have to wait before that subpoena is sent you tell me we
[01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:18.130]  would we would not know any anything that we know about the biden family
[01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:23.010]  176 suspicious activity reports 20 shell companies set up while he was
[01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:26.690]  vice president the whistleblower testimony we would not know any of
[01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:29.650]  this if not for those committees that he set up
[01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:33.490]  exposing all of this we just heard from mary garland last week but you have to
[01:13:33.490 --> 01:13:37.809]  follow that to its natural conclusion it's not enough to expose facts that
[01:13:37.809 --> 01:13:41.570]  get people angry and animated you then have to follow those facts to a
[01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:45.490]  conclusion and to accountability you see that's what republicans are bad at
[01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:48.770]  we're great at having the hearings and putting on the performances but if
[01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:51.809]  you're still going to underwrite biden's debt which is what kevin
[01:13:51.809 --> 01:13:54.770]  mccarthy did joining with democrats on the debt limit deal and if you're
[01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:58.290]  going to join up with democrats to see still fund his government mary garland
[01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:01.650]  will sit there and he'll answer my tough questions and he'll smirk at me or
[01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:05.170]  he'll obfuscate and then guess what he goes back to the justice department
[01:14:05.170 --> 01:14:08.770]  and the coffers are full with money from the american taxpayer that gets
[01:14:08.770 --> 01:14:11.970]  turned against the brave patriots in this country you know what about the
[01:14:11.970 --> 01:14:15.170]  january 6th tapes kevin promised he was going to release those i'm still
[01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:19.650]  waiting well the january 6th tapes are available to anybody who wants to
[01:14:19.650 --> 01:14:23.570]  see them he gave them and allowed tucker colson and his team to see them
[01:14:24.130 --> 01:14:28.050]  it is true no maria they are not available to anyone who wants to see
[01:14:28.050 --> 01:14:31.970]  them that is a that is a factual misstatement they have been curated for
[01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:36.370]  some people in the media and some defense attorneys but any american cannot
[01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:40.610]  see any of the january 6th are you not right now indirectly working with
[01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:44.450]  democrats because you are going to allow chuck schumer to come up with a
[01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:47.889]  continuing resolution next week to fund the government that's what your
[01:14:47.889 --> 01:14:51.730]  actions are doing that's why some people feel this is a personal vendetta
[01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:57.330]  you have against the speaker no my vendetta is against a washington system
[01:14:57.330 --> 01:15:01.650]  that allows corruption to put the interests of lobbyists and pacts above
[01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:05.010]  the interests of the american people kevin mccarthy facilitates that
[01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:08.130]  system and i do deeply resent that but i'm not working with chuck
[01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:10.930]  schumer any other democrat i am the one working with house
[01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:14.930]  conservatives to require single subject spending bills no no you guys
[01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:18.610]  criticize me for forcing single subject spending bills then you give
[01:15:19.090 --> 01:15:23.170]  kevin mccarthy the credit for doing it the reality this is about to come to a
[01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:27.090]  conclusion let me just lay some other things out now i did a preface to this
[01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:30.450]  that explains some of the things barcharomo said now barcharomo is a
[01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:33.969]  loyalist to mccarthy and jim jordan so that's why she's trying to go tit
[01:15:33.969 --> 01:15:39.969]  for tat there with matt gates but clearly she does not see what's
[01:15:39.969 --> 01:15:42.930]  actually going on and that mccarthy is actually the one working for the
[01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:46.850]  democrats not matt gates and in fact i would say
[01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:50.210]  it like this matt gates is the future of the
[01:15:50.210 --> 01:15:54.530]  republican party and matt gates rhetoric is the rhetoric
[01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:59.250]  and the actions that the republican voters want
[01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:02.690]  i talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had
[01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:05.969]  i don't think anybody can deny it and it is
[01:16:05.969 --> 01:16:09.570]  because of listeners and viewers supporting us when we talk about the

[01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:24.610]  they engage in every day five six seven days a week it's
[01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:27.889]  really just incredible so for myself the whole info wars

[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:19.460]  Back here live at the Infowars World Headquarters for the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:25.020]  I want to follow up with one thing that Matt Gaetz talked about and that's this, that's
[01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:32.400]  this bill to fund homeland security and protect the border that Kevin McCarthy's been stalling
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:35.900]  on and the Democrats are even calling him out for that because not every Democrat wants
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:36.900]  an open border.
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:41.620]  I'm going to have that for you coming up, but let's just follow it up a little bit here.
[01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:49.460]  Again, understand Maria Bartiromo is a loyalist to Jim Jordan and Kevin McCarthy because they
[01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:53.000]  give her inside scoops and they give her their time whenever she asks for it.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.660]  So that's fine.
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:21:00.420]  And overall Maria Bartiromo is probably in the top tier, I'd say top 90 percentile
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:03.300]  when it comes to cable news hosts.
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:04.700]  So that's fine.
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:08.140]  Maria Bartiromo is not the problem here and, and quite frankly, even the, even the back
[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:10.980]  and forth, I think, was healthy there.
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:14.360]  But everything Matt Gaetz says is spot on.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:20.620]  The only place where Matt Gaetz could go further would be embracing the government
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:24.540]  shutdown and saying, why should we fund this corrupt out of control government that's
[01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:29.420]  weaponized against the American people and even more corrupted by Joe Biden?
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:32.980]  But he doesn't want to go there, fine.
[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:36.740]  But everything he's talking about is true.
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:43.120]  And for Maria Bartiromo to not see through her loyalist to Kevin McCarthy, her, her loyalty
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:47.180]  to Kevin McCarthy is unfortunate.
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:51.300]  Because she talks about, but, but he's waiting for the right time, but he's done
[01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:56.880]  this to the Biden and that to the Biden, really how the Biden suffered at all.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.460]  Because in my view, it's the American people that have suffered in my view, it's the American
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.560]  economy that has suffered.
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:08.700]  In my view, it's America's standing in the world that has suffered, not Joe Biden, not
[01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:09.700]  Hunter Biden.
[01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:12.100]  They're doing just fine.
[01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:15.140]  Joe Biden spends 40% of his time as president on vacation.
[01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:20.560]  In fact, let me check the clock here, a Sunday, 5 22 central time, Joe Biden is
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:23.120]  on vacation right now.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:26.640]  Don't tell me Joe Biden is feeling the heat from Kevin McCarthy.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:30.420]  That's a joke.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:40.420]  And all that information that Maria Bartiromo laid out there was all available before Kevin
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:44.580]  McCarthy became speaker of the house, all of it.
[01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:49.940]  Now they've been able to go into bank records and that's the one difference, but all the
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:55.240]  text messages, all the whistleblowers, all the business transactions that has all been
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:59.960]  publicly available before Kevin McCarthy became speaker of the house.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:03.880]  Oh, he's just waiting for the right time.
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:06.580]  I think you're right about that, Maria.
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:08.460]  I think you're right about that.
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:13.600]  He has been waiting for the right time, the right time for the Democrats to get Joe Biden
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.680]  out of the way.
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.720]  That's why Kevin McCarthy's moving forward with it.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:22.640]  Now, I originally thought, well, Kevin McCarthy's just moving forward now because he needs
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:27.420]  to score some political points because he's been speaker for almost two years and he's
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:31.720]  still got an egg on the board.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:34.400]  He's still got a donut on his scoreboard.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.520]  So he wanted to score some political points in his moment of desperation.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:39.000]  No, I was wrong, actually.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.040]  I will say, I believe I was wrong.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:46.060]  I believe Kevin McCarthy is doing this because that's what Chuck Schumer, that's what Nancy
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:52.800]  Pelosi and that's what the Democrat Party establishment, maybe even Barack Obama, wants
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:58.300]  Kevin McCarthy to do because we've all seen the media now turn on Biden.
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:01.020]  We've all seen the poll numbers in for Biden.
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:02.620]  Look at that top page of Drudge Report.
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:06.260]  Trump leads Biden 52 42 in polls.
[01:24:06.260 --> 01:24:09.680]  It's over for Joe Biden and the Democrats know it.
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:14.180]  So Kevin McCarthy is doing their bidding and taking Biden out for them.
[01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:15.920]  And that way they don't have to do it.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:20.920]  So it doesn't look like they're a disaster or they're engaging in infighting while they
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:26.200]  are completely ignoring and snubbing the real Democrat presidential candidate, Robert F.
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:27.280]  Kennedy Jr.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:29.440]  But Matt Gaetz brought up a bill.
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:32.160]  I want to show you that bill that Kevin McCarthy's been sitting on for over 100 days
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:33.680]  to protect the border.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.240]  And so here it is in clip seven.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:40.180]  Well, let me take a step back.
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:46.020]  I take it you would describe the situation on our southern border is urgent.
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:48.340]  Yes.
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:51.100]  And I don't think you'd be alone in that view.
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:56.300]  When did the Homeland Security subcommittee hold hearings on this bill that we're considering
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:57.860]  today?
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:59.540]  My understanding is you held a lot of hearings.
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:00.540]  Right.
[01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:03.260]  And I believe we passed it in the full committee in July.
[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:08.740]  You passed it, would June 21st of this year sound about right?
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:10.860]  That the full committee marked up your bill?
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:13.700]  I'll defer to you, sir, if you have the date there.
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:16.960]  I know that I've been working on it since the day I was appointed as chairman, but my
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:23.500]  dear friend Henry Cuellar tried to find better ways to make the implement a strategy
[01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:26.740]  to contain what's happening at the border because it's a national shame.
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:28.860]  And I, for one, want to say I appreciate your commitment.
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:34.620]  The question I have is why has it taken 100 days for the Homeland Security subcommittee
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:38.500]  and the full Appropriations Committee to bring this bill to the rules committee?
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:42.220]  If the situation on the southern border is as urgent as you and I both believe it
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:43.220]  is.
[01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:50.380]  Well, I certainly agree that if I was, you know, running this place, you know, I prioritize
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:51.780]  things perhaps in a different way.
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:53.020]  But are you running the place?
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:54.020]  Who is in charge?
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:56.140]  Well, do I talk to the Republican whip?
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:57.420]  Do I talk to Speaker McCarthy?
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:59.380]  Who do I ask this question of?
[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:03.540]  Well, the appropriations process normally takes place during we have our field hearings throughout
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:06.020]  the first six months of the year.
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:07.020]  Sure.
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:10.900]  Well, generally, as we have processed 10 of our 12 bills, the other two should get done
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:11.900]  shortly.
[01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:12.900]  You did your work.
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:13.900]  June 21st.
[01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:14.900]  You finished.
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:15.900]  You marked up the bill.
[01:26:15.900 --> 01:26:17.140]  June 21st was 100 days ago.
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:18.140]  Correct.
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:19.140]  What?
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.560]  That's what all I'm trying to ask is what happened in this intervening 100 days?
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.140]  Why didn't we take up this bill last month or maybe in July?
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:26.140]  I don't understand.
[01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:30.700]  I'm ready to go on June 22nd, sir, but I don't dictate the schedule.
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:33.420]  Do you understand why the American people would be frustrated?
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:34.540]  Kevin McCarthy's holding it up.
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:42.980]  As they see a Republican caucus that can purports and states that the situation on our southern
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:47.040]  border is urgent but waits 100 days to bring a homeland security funding bill to the House
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.040]  floor.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.100]  Would that make sense?
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:51.100]  May I respond, sir?
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:52.100]  Yeah, of course.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.100]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:55.940]  Yeah, no, because I think the American people are completely frustrated because, you know,
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:59.700]  if you look at it, I remember I think it was my dear friend, Mario Dias Pilar, who
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:04.580]  had presidents of the countries he's talked about before who came here in 14 and 15 who
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:06.020]  said we want our children.
[01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.360]  We want them to stay home.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:13.100]  We wish the president at that time, President Obama, would say you're not welcome here.
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:17.660]  And when he did that, when he started deporting people and pushing back on the entry,
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:18.660]  guess what?
[01:27:18.660 --> 01:27:19.660]  The numbers went down.
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:20.660]  And they stayed down.
[01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:24.780]  But this administration from day one has said there's a green light here.
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:25.780]  Please come.
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:29.340]  Now talking about giving Venezuelans cards in which they can work in this country and
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:32.820]  stay in this country and they don't care whether or not these people are coming across
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:33.820]  the border.
[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:35.780]  You can't call what's happening down there Christian.
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:38.220]  You cannot call it humane.
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:41.700]  The jury these people are taking to come to freedom is not fair to anyone.
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.940]  And the American people are having to pay for it.
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:45.580]  And I can tell your passion.
[01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:50.660]  And I and again, as I said, Mr. Joyce, Mr. Chairman, I understand your passion.
[01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:52.380]  I understand your commitment.
[01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:56.840]  And I understand that your subcommittee did its job working with Mr. Cuellar, holding
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:27:59.260]  a series of hearings earlier this year.
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:02.900]  And the Appropriations Committee, you know, I have substantive disagreements, which we'll
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:07.620]  go through with respect to this particular bill, but the committee marked up the bill.
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:13.440]  And my point that I'm simply trying to better understand, I suppose the question
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:17.980]  that I am trying to reconcile is in my mind is why the House Republican majority
[01:28:17.980 --> 01:28:23.500]  decided to spend the summer on bills regarding gas stoves and the lesser prairie chicken
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:28.780]  and then send everyone home for a 47 day recess, only to come back.
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:32.880]  And seven days before the government is slated to shut down his name and troops and Border
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:37.860]  Patrol agents are slated to not receive paychecks decide that now they'd like to bring this
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:38.860]  bill to the floor.
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:39.860]  That is my point.
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:43.180]  And I and you, you know, answer, you know, I just wanted to give a little more clarity
[01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:44.820]  to what Matt Gaetz was talking about.
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:45.820]  That's perfect example.
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.540]  Oh, who's holding this bill up?
[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:48.540]  Why is it?
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:49.540]  Why is it getting scheduled?
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:50.540]  Why?
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:58.380]  Kevin McCarthy, that's why get him out, get him out.
[01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:03.420]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:08.020]  the insanity, the currency devaluations, the economy going crazy.
[01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:09.020]  You are crazy.
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:12.500]  In my view, if you don't get high quality, storeable food and water filtration and
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.500]  self defense.
[01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:15.500]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:18.140]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:20.060]  And I'm preaching the choir on that.
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:24.980]  A lot of people got plenty of guns, but they don't have enough durable food or water filtration.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:29.200]  This is something you need now and we've got it in the food department and in the high

[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.060]  Thought it was next week.

[01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:37.020]  This is 95%, super constant.
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:40.900]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:43.540]  It's that powerful or more.
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:49.820]  So they're available at info war store.com, body's ultimate turmeric formula sold out
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:57.220]  for almost eight months back in stock at info war store.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:06.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:18.670]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:28.590]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:34.670]  All right, we've got big information coming up from Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.670 --> 01:33:41.910]  He has filed a special report on the fall of the West, and he's going to be exposing
[01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:49.190]  some geopolitical information that the American media will ignore, tied into a historical
[01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:58.070]  lesson that he feels is imperative for us to learn here on this Sunday evening.
[01:33:58.070 --> 01:34:07.750]  Now, we have some of the most important guests that come on our transmissions.
[01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:11.590]  And there are going to be more important guests coming up this week.
[01:34:11.590 --> 01:34:17.550]  And they break some of the most key information when it comes to the media, and it's way
[01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:20.810]  ahead of its time, every time.
[01:34:20.810 --> 01:34:23.910]  And so that's why it's important for Infowars to stay on air.
[01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:30.670]  And that's why the globalists and the corrupt politicians and the deep state and the corrupted
[01:34:30.670 --> 01:34:35.270]  social media companies, big tech companies, want us off the air.
[01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:38.550]  When there's big breaking news, they want to control the narrative.
[01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:41.410]  And if Infowars is on the air, they can't do that.
[01:34:41.410 --> 01:34:43.890]  That's why they are trying so hard to shut us down.
[01:34:43.890 --> 01:34:48.130]  With all the attacks they've had against Alex Jones, and now they're in attempt to
[01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:50.370]  imprison me.
[01:34:50.370 --> 01:34:55.870]  So your continued support at InfowarsStore.com maintains us here on the air.
[01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:56.870]  You're our sponsors.
[01:34:56.870 --> 01:35:00.450]  We don't have big Hollywood sponsors, we don't have big pharmaceutical sponsors,
[01:35:00.450 --> 01:35:03.830]  we don't have big fast food sponsors, none of that.
[01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:07.370]  We just have you shopping at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:35:07.370 --> 01:35:12.050]  And we make it easy because we have things that you need on our site, like toothpaste
[01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:16.510]  and emergency food supplies and water filters.
[01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:22.150]  And then we have things that we promote to help you live a happy and healthy life.
[01:35:22.150 --> 01:35:25.190]  Like DNA force plus, bodies, and the real red pill plus.
[01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:29.830]  These are three supplements that I always have in my pantry.
[01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:35.710]  And now in the trifecta pack, you can get all three 40% off.
[01:35:35.710 --> 01:35:40.310]  And look, I can tell you about each one of these products because I'm a product of
[01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:41.310]  these products.
[01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:45.330]  And so most people will have to read off of a script to tell you about the products
[01:35:45.330 --> 01:35:46.330]  they promote.
[01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:47.450]  Because I know all about them.
[01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:50.490]  The real red pill plus, here's why this is important.
[01:35:50.490 --> 01:35:51.690]  Vitamin K, very important.
[01:35:51.690 --> 01:35:52.690]  Most people are deficient.
[01:35:52.690 --> 01:35:54.210]  You're probably not getting it in your diet.
[01:35:54.210 --> 01:35:55.930]  It's in the real red pill plus.
[01:35:55.930 --> 01:35:57.210]  And then the pregnenolone.
[01:35:57.210 --> 01:36:01.370]  Again, most people don't even know about pregnenolone and why it's so important.
[01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:06.250]  And the pregnenolone actually in the real red pill plus works supplementally and
[01:36:06.250 --> 01:36:09.670]  complementary with DNA force plus.
[01:36:09.670 --> 01:36:13.970]  But there's one other thing in the real red pill plus, and that's naturally occurring
[01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:17.230]  caffeine because of some of the other ingredients.
[01:36:17.230 --> 01:36:19.890]  So it does have a little caffeine boost, a little energy boost in there for you
[01:36:19.890 --> 01:36:20.890]  as well.
[01:36:20.890 --> 01:36:25.470]  Then there's DNA force plus with the CoQ10 and the PQQ for telomere support
[01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:29.130]  and cellular energy production.
[01:36:29.130 --> 01:36:36.770]  And then there's bodies with the 95% curcuminoid turmeric for anti-inflammatory
[01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:38.730]  support, flexibility support, and joint support.
[01:36:38.730 --> 01:36:42.570]  A lot of different reasons why people like bodies.
[01:36:42.570 --> 01:36:47.270]  I like it if I'm sore or stiff after a workout or I play ball for two hours
[01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:51.010]  on a night and then it's some soreness, some joints aching.
[01:36:51.010 --> 01:36:53.330]  I hit the bodies and I get the relief.
[01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:55.990]  But there's a lot of different reasons why people like bodies.
[01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:59.170]  So you can go to infowarsstore.com and read all about it for yourself.
[01:36:59.170 --> 01:37:04.130]  Go read the hundreds of five-star reviews, not just on bodies, but all three of those
[01:37:04.130 --> 01:37:07.690]  products, now 40% off in the trifecta pack.
[01:37:07.690 --> 01:37:11.730]  And it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[01:37:11.730 --> 01:37:16.810]  Now I give a big round of applause to Matt Gaetz.
[01:37:16.810 --> 01:37:21.410]  The only knock I would have against him would be that I think he should embrace the government
[01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:22.410]  shutdown.
[01:37:22.410 --> 01:37:27.010]  He should say, hey, you know what, first of all, the Democrats are lying when they
[01:37:27.010 --> 01:37:30.330]  say the Republicans have been in charge of every government shutdown.
[01:37:30.330 --> 01:37:31.810]  That's just an outright lie.
[01:37:31.810 --> 01:37:33.370]  It's provable.
[01:37:33.370 --> 01:37:37.010]  Like the Democrats pretend like there's no historical records or like you can't go back
[01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:38.830]  and research things on the internet.
[01:37:38.830 --> 01:37:41.510]  But whatever, like I said, it's part of the fiber of being a Democrat.
[01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:44.510]  You have to be a liar.
[01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:51.430]  Or if you're RFK Jr, they'll make sure that you never get into office.
[01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:54.870]  So Vivek Ramaswamy, he understands this.
[01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:58.590]  He understands that the right rhetoric and the right political move that resonates with
[01:37:58.590 --> 01:38:02.350]  the American people is to embrace the shutdown.
[01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:04.710]  Who likes government?
[01:38:04.710 --> 01:38:06.710]  Seriously?
[01:38:06.710 --> 01:38:09.830]  Sure you've got libtards out there that just pretend to like whatever they're fed,
[01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:14.670]  whatever slop the mainstream puts on their plate, they just embrace it mostly because
[01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:18.370]  they just hate you and want to be contrarian to you.
[01:38:18.370 --> 01:38:22.110]  But really at their heart, at their soul, who likes government, who wants government
[01:38:22.110 --> 01:38:28.610]  in their lives, in their lives and interrupting their lives and determining their outcomes.
[01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:30.570]  So really the response should be good.
[01:38:30.570 --> 01:38:33.130]  Shut down this government that's weaponized against the American people.
[01:38:33.130 --> 01:38:36.370]  Shut down this government that steals our money and gives it to foreign countries.
[01:38:36.370 --> 01:38:40.910]  Shut down this government that cares more about illegal immigrants than American citizens.
[01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:42.230]  That resonates with the American people.
[01:38:42.230 --> 01:38:44.130]  So Matt Gaetz doesn't want to go that far.
[01:38:44.130 --> 01:38:45.370]  Maybe it's for political reasons.
[01:38:45.370 --> 01:38:48.670]  Maybe he just doesn't want to have that rhetoric as a member of Congress.
[01:38:48.670 --> 01:38:54.110]  But Vivek Ramaswamy has gone that far in so many words, but he also goes one other
[01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:57.850]  place that I love to see.
[01:38:57.850 --> 01:39:04.250]  Talking about the government lying to us on the Full Send podcast, here's Vivek Ramaswamy
[01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:07.570]  in clip number eight.
[01:39:07.570 --> 01:39:08.570]  How old are you guys actually?
[01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:09.570]  29.
[01:39:09.570 --> 01:39:10.570]  You're 29?
[01:39:10.570 --> 01:39:11.570]  Same age.
[01:39:11.570 --> 01:39:12.570]  I'm 30, a little bit older than you guys.
[01:39:12.570 --> 01:39:15.930]  But certainly I grew up, and I think you guys did too, into a generation where the
[01:39:15.930 --> 01:39:21.450]  government has systematically lied to us.
[01:39:21.450 --> 01:39:23.570]  Lied to us about weapons of mass destruction.
[01:39:23.570 --> 01:39:25.530]  We've always not trusted the government in our...
[01:39:25.530 --> 01:39:30.990]  Oh yeah, and even conservative, Republican, Democrat, the Iraq war, the 2008 bailouts.
[01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:32.730]  I was working on a job in New York City here.
[01:39:32.730 --> 01:39:33.730]  I mean, that was a farce.
[01:39:33.730 --> 01:39:38.770]  The bailouts after the 2008 financial crisis, the Trump-Russia collusion hoax that never
[01:39:38.770 --> 01:39:43.690]  was, origin of COVID-19 pandemic, what we knew about the vaccines before they were
[01:39:43.690 --> 01:39:49.130]  foisted on us as mandates, the Hunter Biden laptop story on the eve of an election, the
[01:39:49.130 --> 01:39:53.850]  Nashville transgender shooter manifesto that they still have not released, now how our
[01:39:53.850 --> 01:39:56.010]  money's being spent in Ukraine.
[01:39:56.010 --> 01:40:00.770]  We have a government that has systematically lied and said, we can't trust the people
[01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:01.770]  with the truth.
[01:40:02.530 --> 01:40:05.730]  And so young people who grew up into that generation, I mean, what a four-year college
[01:40:05.730 --> 01:40:09.550]  degree is worth that you take on that debt somehow that's going to help you live the
[01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:10.550]  American dream.
[01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:15.030]  Many of my peers still haven't paid off their college debts.
[01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:17.850]  So yeah, I get it why young people are disaffected.
[01:40:17.850 --> 01:40:25.530]  Boy, I got to tell you, you know, I remain consistent in my vote right now being for
[01:40:25.530 --> 01:40:26.870]  Donald Trump again.
[01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:29.890]  Some people will disagree with that, might call me a fool, but I believe he's got a
[01:40:29.890 --> 01:40:30.890]  second term.
[01:40:30.890 --> 01:40:36.450]  He's earned it and, and maybe I do believe that he's going to have his redemption arc
[01:40:36.450 --> 01:40:41.850]  if he can get into office again, but I got to tell you, the more I see, the more
[01:40:41.850 --> 01:40:45.610]  I hear from be vague, he just keeps warming my heart.
[01:40:45.610 --> 01:40:49.290]  He just keeps softening my heart and warming my heart to him.
[01:40:49.290 --> 01:40:51.430]  And really the only reason I wouldn't vote for him is just cause he doesn't have any
[01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:58.150]  political capital yet, but man, his stance on just about everything is just spot
[01:40:58.150 --> 01:41:02.470]  on organic and right in my view.
[01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:06.110]  And he's the only one that said, why are we, why aren't we giving the Democrat?
[01:41:06.110 --> 01:41:08.230]  Why aren't we taking what the Democrats give us here?
[01:41:08.230 --> 01:41:12.990]  Let's own the government shutdown and let's actually shut this corruption down.
[01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:15.510]  He's the only one I've seen go that far.
[01:41:15.510 --> 01:41:18.630]  Now here's an interesting thing.
[01:41:18.630 --> 01:41:25.150]  Donald Trump had a big record skip last week and I don't know why, I mean, look,
[01:41:25.150 --> 01:41:27.110]  I understand why people go on Megan Kelly.
[01:41:27.110 --> 01:41:28.110]  She's got a platform.
[01:41:28.110 --> 01:41:32.670]  But why, why Donald Trump would go back on Mellon, Megan Kelly is just beyond me.
[01:41:32.670 --> 01:41:36.550]  I mean, how many times has she stabbed the person in the back that she's interviewing?
[01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:42.590]  So he heard himself when he talked about abortion and that was a big, that was a big
[01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:44.430]  record skip for him.
[01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:47.550]  And now the Democrats are coming to his aid.
[01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:52.190]  And so after Trump basically kind of backed off his abortion stance, the Democrats are
[01:41:52.190 --> 01:41:56.890]  now pushing him right back to the, to the full on abortion victories that he's had.
[01:41:56.890 --> 01:42:02.650]  This is the Democrats, Joe Biden tweeted out this video of Donald Trump after he was
[01:42:02.650 --> 01:42:06.050]  like, well, maybe we should have six weeks or eight weeks or a heartbeat thing.
[01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:09.250]  Lot of Republicans took that the wrong way.
[01:42:09.250 --> 01:42:10.770]  Political peers took that the wrong way.
[01:42:10.770 --> 01:42:12.450]  Cultural peers put that the wrong way.
[01:42:12.450 --> 01:42:18.130]  But now the Democrats put out this video saying Trump is the king of banning abortion.
[01:42:18.130 --> 01:42:20.330]  I got rid of Roe v. Wade.
[01:42:20.330 --> 01:42:23.050]  I'm the one that got rid of Roe v. Wade.
[01:42:23.050 --> 01:42:25.970]  I was able to do it and I was very honored to do it.
[01:42:26.050 --> 01:42:27.570]  Do you believe in punishment for abortion?
[01:42:27.570 --> 01:42:28.570]  Yes or no?
[01:42:28.570 --> 01:42:29.570]  As a principle.
[01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:33.570]  The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment for the woman.
[01:42:33.570 --> 01:42:35.010]  Yeah, there has to be some form.
[01:42:35.010 --> 01:42:40.050]  There of course remains a vital role for the federal government in protecting unborn
[01:42:40.050 --> 01:42:41.050]  life.
[01:42:41.050 --> 01:42:45.050]  Nobody has ever done more for right to life than Donald Trump.
[01:42:45.050 --> 01:42:46.050]  Roe v. Wade.
[01:42:46.050 --> 01:42:47.050]  They won.
[01:42:47.050 --> 01:42:48.050]  They finally won.
[01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:51.490]  The Iowa bill was signed and they wouldn't have been able to do anything if I wasn't
[01:42:51.490 --> 01:42:53.410]  able to do what I did.
[01:42:53.410 --> 01:42:56.410]  So Democrats restoring some of the damage Trump did to himself.
[01:42:56.410 --> 01:42:57.410]  That's hilarious.
[01:42:57.410 --> 01:42:59.570]  Don't lie down and take it.

[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:17.060]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:20.580]  Please don't forget, coming up when this hour ends in about ten and a half minutes,
[01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:25.740]  Owen Short will be taking over yet again to host Sunday Night Live, six to eight
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:30.340]  p.m. Central. A lot of breaking news, clips, analysis and your phone calls.
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:35.980]  Now, I'm about to cover in this last segment the most important issue happening on our
[01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:42.460]  planet today. Hands down, you'll agree with me. And we have a chance to control our destiny
[01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:48.900]  and not march headlong into nuclear Armageddon. So let's get into it right now.
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:54.860]  Facts are stubborn things. And I don't agree with the head Russian foreign minister,
[01:47:54.860 --> 01:48:01.380]  Sergei Lavrov, because he's Russian or because I'm a Russia file. No, it's because I am a
[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:08.740]  truth seeker, a truth file, and I support the truth. And Russia did not start the war.
[01:48:08.740 --> 01:48:12.900]  The Anglo American globalist forces, the same ones destroying the West, destroying
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:17.980]  our borders, devaluing our currency, attacking our families, attacking Christianity are the
[01:48:17.980 --> 01:48:22.420]  ones now trying to start thermal nuclear war with the Russians.
[01:48:22.460 --> 01:48:28.780]  So what did the Russian foreign minister say on Friday in a huge speech to the United
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:34.700]  Nations? Here's the headline and read the transcript at Infowars.com. The West is now
[01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:41.580]  the real empire of lies. Key takeaways from Lavrov's U.N. speech. Let's be clear.
[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:46.460]  Russia's not perfect. They're not without sin either. But they are not expansionary
[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:52.420]  like the Anglo American globalist allied with communist China. But now China is breaking
[01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:56.820]  with that and teaming up with Russia. And you talk about anything on the earth that's
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:49:01.620]  as evil as the globalist. It's the communist Chinese. So the Russians aren't perfect.
[01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:06.820]  But compared to the globalist and the communist Chinese, they are like choir boys in my
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:13.460]  research to view an opinion. So what did Lavrov talk about? What's the big takeaway?
[01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:20.340]  He said the West is losing its survival instinct. He said the West is losing its connection
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:26.220]  to reality and the fact that this is an existential threat to all life on Earth.
[01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:31.500]  And they don't realize how much danger everyone is in because they basically have
[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:38.580]  a bias, a normalcy bias of being in charge and having the power and being the controlling
[01:49:38.580 --> 01:49:44.380]  empire since the end of World War Two, 70 plus years ago. And that's the point I make all
[01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:48.780]  the time. The globalists are getting more and more reckless, more and more out of control.
[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:52.460]  The more they squeeze people, the more resistance they get instead of backing off
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:57.900]  of and using soft power. They use hard power. And now they've run up against the largest
[01:49:57.900 --> 01:50:02.660]  nuclear power on earth who's saying they're not going to back down. This is a game
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:06.380]  of chicken. We don't want to play, especially when the people who've hijacked our country
[01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:11.300]  and Europe are diametrically opposed to us as much as they're opposed to the Russians
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:16.740]  because any independent sovereign culture is a threat to their hegemonic, technocracy
[01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:24.980]  and transhumanist aims and depopulationist goals. Russian official slams US for stirring
[01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:31.020]  up conflicts that actively divide humanity into hostile blocks and prevent it from achieving
[01:50:31.020 --> 01:50:36.820]  common goals. Close quote, says Western nations are sending arms to Kiev and training
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:44.140]  its troops. They are de facto fighting against us with the hands and bodies of Ukrainians.
[01:50:44.140 --> 01:50:50.460]  Yes, they'll fight the last Ukrainian NATO will the world has a chance to achieve authentic
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:55.940]  democratization and international relations by establishing a multipolar order, making
[01:50:55.940 --> 01:51:01.220]  the first opportunity since the end of World War Two. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
[01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:07.460]  told the UN General Assembly Saturday, Friday, the US and its Western allies seek to prevent
[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:13.020]  such a development by stirring up new conflicts to divide humanity and keep the hegemony
[01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:17.780]  of a global minority. That's a quote in place. He added the West is an empire of
[01:51:17.780 --> 01:51:21.980]  lies, not the people of the West, but the people that have hijacked the ruling elite,
[01:51:21.980 --> 01:51:27.300]  the corrupt aristocracy. The US and its allies still reject the principle of a quality international
[01:51:27.300 --> 01:51:31.980]  relations. Lavrov said, Americans, Europeans keep looking down on the rest of the world
[01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:38.580]  and that leads to their total intractability in any negotiations. Washington, its allies
[01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:42.700]  keep making promises left and right. They don't just look down on the third world
[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:47.420]  or the old world. They look down on the American people as well. The ends up being
[01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:53.660]  reneged on, the Russian minister added. As Russian President Vladimir Putin put it, the West is now
[01:51:53.660 --> 01:51:59.260]  the real empire of lies, he added. Reckless Western politicians have forgotten about
[01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:06.460]  self-preservation. This is point two, forgotten about self-preservation. NATO activities have
[01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:10.940]  reached unprecedented levels since the end of the Cold War, the top Russian diplomat believes.
[01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:16.620]  The US-led bloc forces have conducted drills that involve simulated nuclear strikes against
[01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:22.140]  Russia. Even CNN is reporting that now. That's been building up. He reported,
[01:52:22.860 --> 01:52:27.660]  adding that Washington is also actively seeking to protect its military might in the Asia Pacific
[01:52:27.660 --> 01:52:33.020]  through establishing military-political alliances with nations like Australia, South Korea and Japan
[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:36.860]  and pushing them towards closer cooperation with NATO. I thought NATO was just the North
[01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:42.140]  Atlantic Treaty Organization. Now it's global, the UN military force they talked about decades ago.
[01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:47.180]  Such actions risk creating a new explosive geopolitical hot spot. In addition to the
[01:52:47.180 --> 01:52:52.140]  European one, Lavrov warned, adding that the Western politicians have been so blinded by
[01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:59.900]  a feeling of impunity or invincibility that they've lost, quote, the sense of self-preservation.
[01:52:59.900 --> 01:53:05.980]  And he goes on to break down what's happening. He goes on to say the globalists have their
[01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:10.780]  new world order that stands in the way of a independent nation-based order with nations
[01:53:10.780 --> 01:53:15.260]  working together. He goes on to say that Western sanctions are only hurting poor people
[01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:18.780]  and starving them around the world, not actually hurting the Russian government,
[01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:22.460]  which again, Russia has made record profits during the last year and a half war
[01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:28.060]  because they're supplying more fuel and more gas to India and of course, to China.
[01:53:28.060 --> 01:53:34.860]  And he just goes on to lay all of that out. You can't disagree with the facts here.
[01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:40.860]  And as I say this every day, the globalists are we're putting fluoride out, 5G, GMO,
[01:53:40.860 --> 01:53:45.420]  poison shots that blows back on them and their families. They're not exempt from it and it's
[01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:49.820]  destroying them as well. And you look at how unhappy the main dynasty families are,
[01:53:49.820 --> 01:53:53.900]  if you research the DuPonts or the Rockefellers or the Rothschilds or any of them,
[01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:58.460]  highest levels of suicide in their families, super high levels of transgenderism.
[01:53:58.460 --> 01:54:00.780]  They are sick. They are twisted and they're trying to
[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:08.460]  project what's happened to them because of their service to evil on to us. And if you expand on
[01:54:08.460 --> 01:54:13.980]  this, think about how we're told the Russians are destroying America, but who's cutting off
[01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:18.380]  our energy? Who's attacking our children with sexualization? Who is allowing fentanyl to be
[01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:22.700]  shipped in? Who's dissolved our borders? Who's doing a thousand other horrible things?
[01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:26.700]  It's not the Russians. Do the Russians control thousands of US public schools?
[01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:30.220]  No, the communist Chinese do. Do the Russians own four of the big six Hollywood
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:34.220]  production firms? No, the communist Chinese do. And I'm not saying the communist Chinese run at
[01:54:34.220 --> 01:54:39.740]  all. They're just a major command arm of the globalist until about a decade ago.
[01:54:39.740 --> 01:54:45.260]  And now Xi Jinping has broken with them. So the globalist plan is not working. Just like
[01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:50.140]  Hitler and Stalin, the first two years of World War II were allied. They later turned against
[01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:55.100]  each other and we know the rest of history. So this global government and in this race to
[01:54:55.100 --> 01:55:02.220]  set up authoritarian global cashless societies and AI surveillance grids will end up biting all
[01:55:02.220 --> 01:55:08.060]  of us in the ass, including the globalists that have established this totalitarian transhumanist
[01:55:08.060 --> 01:55:15.180]  system. A brief history is basically the British Empire won World War I, but was bankrupt after
[01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:20.380]  it. Then they basically built up Hitler, allowed him to launch the attacks he did.
[01:55:20.380 --> 01:55:24.220]  They didn't control him, but they set him up and told the Germans they had a treaty with
[01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:29.980]  them and then the king of England will become the head of the EU. And the deputy fuhrer had a
[01:55:29.980 --> 01:55:34.220]  treaty that he delivered back to the British. And so they locked him in the tower. Rudolph
[01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:39.660]  Hess. This is all there. And so out of that, the British empire at the end of World War II
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:44.780]  merged with the new burgeoning American empire. And that's been the global order since then.
[01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:48.780]  But now that's been run completely into the ground because the globalist aren't just trying
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:52.780]  to dominate the Russians and the Chinese and the Africans and everybody else. They're trying
[01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:57.500]  to dominate the people at home and saying the main threat is the American people and
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:02.620]  populist conservatives that just want to have a free and prosperous world to promote American
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:07.900]  values through soft power and not be part of this hegemonic world government. That's why
[01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:12.940]  the globalists are failing according to every measurement. But again, they don't back down.
[01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:17.900]  They only intensify their operations. That's why people that serve the system, even though
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:23.260]  it's at their own detriment, need to wake up and pull back and realize just because big tech
[01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:28.620]  promotes your post, because you go along with tyranny, doesn't mean you're on a winning team.
[01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:32.940]  You're schmucks, you're fools, you're useful idiots that have been brought along with this
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:37.260]  system. The globalists claim they're launching all this war and all these sanctions and control
[01:56:37.260 --> 01:56:41.740]  to protect us. But at the same time, any place they control, they are busy
[01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:45.500]  shutting off the infrastructure of the general public because they cannot help
[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:51.580]  the totalitarian predatory mindset. They are predators. They are pedophiles. They are inbred
[01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:56.540]  globalist degenerates. They are the enemy of the world. They are the worst elite on the planet.
[01:56:56.540 --> 01:57:01.100]  They are the plague. They will kill us all. It will do not break with them and stop following
[01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:07.580]  their orders. Going along with the globalists is a suicide pact. It's a circular firing squad
[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:12.940]  and info war stands against nuclear war stands against the destruction of national sovereignty
[01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:16.780]  and the family and stands against transhumanism. We're going to go to break. We're going to end
