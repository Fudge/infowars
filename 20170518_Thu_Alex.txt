[00:00.000 --> 00:17.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War, and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[00:18.000 --> 00:24.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24.000 --> 00:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the biggest news. In the last year of mainstream media propaganda, with no proof that Donald Trump is a Russian agent, this is incredible.
[00:41.000 --> 00:49.000]  More and more Democrats like Dennis Kasenich, who are actually respectable, I don't agree with their politics, but they're not evil people, have come out and said the deep stays trying to take Trump out.
[00:49.000 --> 00:56.000]  Colonel Schaefer has said it. Jonathan Turley, a constitutional lawyer and big Democrat, big liberal, they're saying this is totally criminal, this is dangerous.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  Even if you believe Comey's supposed memo, this is not obstruction of justice.
[01:03.000 --> 01:07.000]  What is obstruction of justice is what Comey's done.
[01:07.000 --> 01:18.000]  That's the big breaking news. Any way you look at what I'm about to break here. This has been blurbed a few times online. It's got no attention.
[01:19.000 --> 01:28.000]  One of our producers, Matt, brought it to my attention. It is incredible. We've been scrambling this morning, just looking at this over and over again, and looking at the dates.
[01:28.000 --> 01:38.000]  This is incontrovertible. This is open and shut on Comey. Either the memos fake and whoever released it from the FBI's lying or the media's lying, it doesn't exist.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  And the FBI hasn't come out and said that that's a lie.
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.000]  And the FBI is letting this fake leak come out with totally made up bogus info.
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.000]  That wouldn't be the first time. It's happened multiple times just this week so far with the whole Russia intel claim that wasn't true about laptop bombs.
[01:53.000 --> 02:00.000]  So listen to me carefully. Here's the big news. James Comey is going to play the clip in a moment.
[02:01.000 --> 02:14.000]  In the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3rd, that's months after the supposed February meeting with the president and the February phone calls where they had just dismissed Flynn.
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.000]  And he said, reportedly, gee, I hope you can see your way to not keep this going.
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.000]  Trump says he never said that. Trump said, watch out. I've got tapes.
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.000]  And it just broke. Kit Daniels, infowars.com breaking. Comey caught committing perjury to Congress.
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  Question mark. Comey's February memo contradicts May 3rd Senate testimony.
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  And I would just say Comey's reported February memo because he hadn't denied it.
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.000]  In fact, he pretty much says he's done it. He wants to testify, though, as a government agent next week, not as a citizen.
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  I guess he wants immunity. But again, my brain is just burning with all the angles here. Let me say it very, very simply.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  Comey testified May 3rd to the Senate Committee.
[02:58.000 --> 03:09.000]  The Senate Judiciary Committee that there was no outside influence and that Trump had not been trying to influence the Russia investigation and that the FBI had not been told to stand down.
[03:09.000 --> 03:24.000]  This is months after he reportedly meets with Trump in person and writes this memo where Trump tried to encourage him to drop any type of stuff going forward against Flynn.
[03:25.000 --> 03:31.000]  So is the memo fake and the FBI leader is going along with the lie?
[03:31.000 --> 03:44.000]  Did he really do the memo and it's true Trump did it? But then Comey perjured himself to Congress and said he hadn't been influenced or nobody tried to influence him?
[03:45.000 --> 03:53.000]  Any way you slice it, they have been caught in red-handed perjury and fraud and lies.
[03:53.000 --> 04:04.000]  The lesser of is the FBI knows the memo's fake and doesn't exist and has let somebody put out a fake leak and let the lie go out there in an attempt to bring down the president.
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  That's the lesser crime and it's serious.
[04:07.000 --> 04:22.000]  There's so many crimes there it makes your head spin or Comey did have the meeting, did do the memo and perjured himself to Congress or the memo's perjury.
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  There's no way out of this now. No way out.
[04:26.000 --> 04:37.000]  You're about to find out about the Providence and the luck of the United States of America because God love children, drunks and the United States of America.
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  The thing I've got all three of those covered.
[04:41.000 --> 04:49.000]  We'll be right back ladies and gentlemen but I tell you they're going to have a lot of trouble covering this one up and it's hiding in plain view.
[04:49.000 --> 04:59.000]  We're going to play you the video clip that sinks the whole lie on the other side of this break and we've got just so much giant news, it's red-donkulous.
[05:19.000 --> 05:26.000]  Northridge joins a long list of unfortunate murder and suicide victims with close ties to the Clintons.
[05:27.000 --> 05:35.000]  Meanwhile the FBI and DC police continue to insist that his death was from a robbery gone bad.
[05:36.000 --> 05:44.000]  But former DC homicide detective turned private investigator Rod Wheeler says the DC police were told to stand down.
[05:44.000 --> 05:54.000]  I actually have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said Rod we were told to stand down in this case and I can't share any information with you.
[05:54.000 --> 06:23.000]  And you can learn more right now at Infowars.com.
[06:24.000 --> 06:31.000]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture them.
[06:32.000 --> 06:39.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal, you used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[06:40.000 --> 06:47.000]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[06:47.000 --> 06:55.000]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself at InfowarsLife.com today.

[07:25.000 --> 07:28.000]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[07:29.000 --> 07:39.000]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my superfemale, I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again, very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[07:39.000 --> 07:46.000]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again, so obviously the superfemale is amazing, I love it.

[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  We are the Infowar. Thank you so much for joining us.
[08:44.000 --> 08:55.000]  Big demonstration at the FCC and DC today by Occupy the FCC that wants Obama's so-called net neutrality that is an internet takeover.
[08:56.000 --> 09:02.000]  A world for net neutrality, they just call their net neutrality takeover net neutrality, it's not net neutrality.
[09:03.000 --> 09:09.000]  Just like North Korea is called the Democratic Republic of North Korea, it's not democratic, they don't have elections.
[09:09.000 --> 09:21.000]  The FCC kicks off effort to roll back net neutrality rules, which aren't net neutrality rules, it's what Obama put in to take over the internet as if it's a quote, public utility and regulating.
[09:22.000 --> 09:27.000]  Are there dangers under this new FCC proposal for control? Absolutely, that's the nature of government.
[09:27.000 --> 09:42.000]  But the Democrats have dumbed it down that we just want net neutrality and Alex Jones is against it and so what are they out there doing? There are signs up on Infowars.com in the article, we tweeted it, ban Infowars, hashtag net neutrality.
[09:42.000 --> 09:59.000]  Story is up on Infowars.com, ban Infowars, hashtag net neutrality and then here's another one, ban Breitbart, ban Drudge, they've got the communist red fist there, ban Drudge, there's images of that.
[09:59.000 --> 10:17.000]  And then we've got the official organization saying that they would be there as part of Occupy, the FCC, we're camping out day and night on the FCC's doorstep to defend net neutrality and keep the internet free from discrimination and slow lanes.
[10:17.000 --> 10:28.000]  And the discrimination they want banned is Matt Drudge, there you go, and then we send a crew out there, and we find the tweets online.
[10:29.000 --> 10:35.000]  Where it is, is some of the locals who have a crew that's going to have some HD footage uploaded soon, because this is just happening as we speak.
[10:35.000 --> 10:47.000]  Net neutrality protesters leave messages on doors in FCC Chairman's neighborhood. This is the type of harassment that's going on, net neutrality protesters, Rick Roll Trump's FCC Chairman.
[10:48.000 --> 10:57.000]  So, there for free speech, they want Drudge and Infowars and Breitbart banned, aren't they sweet, aren't they nice, aren't they cute?
[10:57.000 --> 11:15.000]  And it's a bunch of communists out there, of course, that are doing all this. The alt-left targets Ajipai, who has explained that the Obama's takeover of the FCC with the law that's still in place ends the freedom that we have on the internet.
[11:16.000 --> 11:22.000]  It brings FCC control. Now, before I get back into that huge story, here is the Gigantor News.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  And I want to be clear, I'm not going after the former head of the FBI Mueller, because I've got some acts to grind with him.
[11:28.000 --> 11:37.000]  I've got a lot of sources, like Dr. Corsi, that's coming on later, that thinks this is a good idea, and he'll do a good job, and then he's this patriot and war hero from Vietnam and the rest of it.
[11:38.000 --> 11:44.000]  And then I've got other people that are really concerned about his connection to the Bushes and the aftermath of 9-11 and the cover-ups that happened there.
[11:44.000 --> 11:57.000]  That doesn't matter to me when it comes to this case. I'm going to coldly look at him as this special counsel, and we're calling it a special prosecutor, over what the president has called is the most unfair treatment of a president ever.
[11:58.000 --> 12:10.000]  And I totally agree. Look at the crimes of the Clintons. Look at the crimes of Obama. Look at them just engaging in all this insane, anti-American behavior, funding ISIS, funding al-Qaeda, Benghazi.
[12:10.000 --> 12:17.000]  The list just goes on and on, opening our borders outside of law, violating the law, not even testing people for diseases coming in.
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.000]  It goes on and on, targeting with the IRS, Christians and conservatives and libertarians and veterans groups, and admitting in their own memos they're going after people for their ideology.
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  This makes Nixon look like an angel. And I don't defend some of the stuff Nixon did.
[12:32.000 --> 12:40.000]  But on a rector's scale, it's like a zero, zero, zero point, whatever. It doesn't even show up. And with Obama, it was like a nine on the rector's scale.
[12:42.000 --> 12:55.000]  So what business does the FBI have doing this to President Trump when all these months of these investigations, even the Reuters today admitted, no evidence of Russian collusion. There's nothing there.
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  With the Clintons, they're in bed with the Russians. It's crazy.
[12:58.000 --> 13:03.000]  The uranium deals, the energy deals, the secret meetings, all the things they claim Trump did.
[13:04.000 --> 13:11.000]  Now here comes the trillion pound gorilla on Mueller, former director Robert Mueller.
[13:12.000 --> 13:22.000]  Here's the big news. He testified, I'm going to play the clip here in a moment, to the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3rd.
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  We have links to the full testimony on infowars.com.
[13:28.000 --> 13:40.000]  And they asked him, under oath, and as a federal employee under the executive branch, they asked him, has anybody tried to influence this investigation?
[13:41.000 --> 13:48.000]  Has anybody from the Trump administration, or connected to him, tried to get you to drop this? And he said no.
[13:48.000 --> 13:58.000]  And of course, he goes into the same arguments that, oh, Loretta Lynch, you know, just had a general discussion with Clinton, but it wasn't about anything specific.
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  It was just people's opinions about cases.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  Well, see, that's the issue.
[14:03.000 --> 14:09.000]  Trump, if he really did say this in the memo, is saying, well, I hope you can see it through, you know, in your work that he hadn't anything.
[14:10.000 --> 14:11.000]  Because I don't think he's done anything. I think he's a good guy.
[14:11.000 --> 14:18.000]  And then, Comey says, yeah, he is a good guy. Plus, the president, with his executive power, could order him not to.
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.000]  He can release any intelligence he wants.
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  He's not above the law, though.
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  He's got to be executing it for the Constitution, for the Republic, for the people under his duly sworn powers.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  Then if Congress thinks he's gone too far, they have to move with the investigation.
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  They have to vote for the investigation in the House and have the investigation in the Senate.
[14:37.000 --> 14:38.000]  That's the impeachment process.
[14:38.000 --> 14:47.000]  But Jonathan Turley and other top Democrat lawyers have come out and said, listen, we don't particularly like some of his politics, but the deep states after him.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  And even if this memo is real, this is not obstruction of justice by any means.
[14:54.000 --> 14:57.000]  And Turley, there's an article on infowars.com, runs through all of it.
[14:58.000 --> 15:05.000]  So we've got former Black Ops commander coming out saying that deep states coming after Trump trying to overthrow him, the presidents at war, the countries in a civil war.
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  We've got percentage coming out saying the deep states trying to destroy Trump.
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  We've got Dana Bash bragging on CNN saying, quote, this is the deep state.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  You know how to get back, even if you're the president.
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  You've got Chuck E. Schumer saying the same thing.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  So these people admit they're trying to bring the president down for political power.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  They're trying to hijack the country.
[15:26.000 --> 15:27.000]  They're trying to ignore our election.
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.000]  They're trying to overthrow an elected president.
[15:30.000 --> 15:30.000]  They admit it.
[15:31.000 --> 15:32.000]  They call themselves the resistance.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  I'm the resistance to the globalist hijacking our country, not to our own government.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  But see, they are because they're the outside power, everything they claim Trump is.
[15:43.000 --> 15:50.000]  But they're the well-organized, globalist EU, NWO, banking power, the TPP, the IMF, the World Bank, everything Trump's pulling us out of.
[15:50.000 --> 16:05.000]  So the big news here, any way you slice this, tell me, and I'm about to play the clip, says there was not outside influence trying to make us obstruct justice.
[16:06.000 --> 16:13.000]  Then this memo gets released or leaked, not even the specifics of it, not even all the details, but the basics.
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.000]  We don't know that memo's even real, but the FBI isn't saying it's false.
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  There's no discussion of how it's a criminal leak, as usual.
[16:21.000 --> 16:29.000]  So either it's a fake memo, and the media's cooked this up, and the deep state, and the liberal FBI segments have done this, and that's a fraud.
[16:30.000 --> 16:37.000]  Or Comey perjured himself to Congress on May 3rd by saying Trump didn't try to obstruct justice in his view.
[16:37.000 --> 16:46.000]  Or the memo is made up, and Comey did it, and then he told the truth in front of Congress under oath.
[16:47.000 --> 16:48.000]  I mean, any way you look at it, they're lying.
[16:49.000 --> 16:59.000]  Any way you look at it, the FBI, the mainstream media, the corporate media, they've all gone along with this memo probably being real, and that Comey really did this, and he's ready to testify to Congress.
[17:00.000 --> 17:01.000]  They've not been denying it.
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  They just don't want to go to jail for leaking it.
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.000]  So did Comey cook this up? Did he exaggerate in his notes?
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.000]  Did he lie to Congress?
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.000]  Any way you look at it, it's a fraud.
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  Any way you look at it, it's a lie.
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.000]  Now, Comey may not be guilty of this, but somebody is.
[17:25.000 --> 17:26.000]  I ask, is he guilty of perjury?
[17:26.000 --> 17:42.000]  Well, through this leaked memo with no providence or where it came from, and without the full details, Comey right now is hanging his butt out there if he doesn't come out and clarify this, and his entering perjury, his entering deception.
[17:43.000 --> 17:48.000]  Any way you look at it, against the Congress, against the American people, against the president, and against this republic.
[17:48.000 --> 17:57.000]  We're going to have some constitutional experts on later in the day and see if they can find fault with what I've said, but I don't think you can.
[17:58.000 --> 18:10.000]  Because he tells them May 3rd, months after he writes this memo, after he met with the president, that night he wrote it, he said, they say, because he was so shocked by it, but Comey doesn't say it, his surrogates say it.
[18:10.000 --> 18:17.000]  And then a few months later, he tells Congress, no, he didn't see any attempts to influence it, or obstruction of justice, so which one is it?
[18:20.000 --> 18:26.000]  And remember, they said, oh, we've been spying on Trump, we know he's talking to the Russians, we know he's selling people out, we know he's doing bad stuff.
[18:27.000 --> 18:32.000]  And then Trump calls him and says, well, that's an illegal leak, and they go, we never said we were wiretapping you, we never said we were listening to you.
[18:33.000 --> 18:38.000]  And you're like, wait a minute, you've been all over the newspapers and TV saying it, oh no, we haven't, you're crazy.
[18:38.000 --> 18:57.000]  So this is a circular logic they've been involved in the whole time, where they put out that they have all this surveillance, or they have these memos, or the Russians are planning listening devices, or Trump gave out classified info, or Trump got pee-peed on in a hotel room, and every time it's a load of horse manure.
[18:58.000 --> 19:05.000]  So here is Comey, when he was director of the FBI May 3rd to the judiciary committee of the Senate, here it is.
[19:05.000 --> 19:15.000]  So if the attorney general or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?
[19:16.000 --> 19:17.000]  In theory, yes.
[19:18.000 --> 19:19.000]  As it happened?
[19:20.000 --> 19:27.000]  Not in my experience, because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something without an appropriate purpose.
[19:27.000 --> 19:34.000]  I mean, we're oftentimes, they give us opinions that we don't see a case there, and so you ought to stop investing resources in it.
[19:35.000 --> 19:40.000]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason, that would be a very big deal.
[19:41.000 --> 19:42.000]  It's not happened in my experience.
[19:43.000 --> 19:52.000]  If we were told to stop something for a political reason, that would be a big deal, and I've not seen it in my experience.
[19:52.000 --> 19:59.000]  But now, we got this ghost memo, and they're calling for the impeachment of the president.

[23:58.000 --> 24:18.000]  Now the FBI under federal law, if they have a memo or one of these reports filed by one of their agents or one of their directors, has a digital trace number.
[24:18.000 --> 24:28.000]  And of course the FBI just keeps hanging out there letting the rumor float around that the president said, hey, I politically want you to shut this down.
[24:29.000 --> 24:37.000]  But should people know Trump, they say he wouldn't say. A lot of members of Congress are saying they don't buy this. A lot of Democrats are saying they don't buy it.
[24:37.000 --> 24:52.000]  But it doesn't matter because it's all part of the steady stream of lies. And that's why Trump said, days before Comey's surrogates released this story about this memo, this ghost memo,
[24:52.000 --> 25:06.000]  that Trump said, you better watch what you do, buddy boy, because there might be tapes and you know there's tapes in the White House and you know there's tapes on the telephone conversations.
[25:07.000 --> 25:16.000]  So with Trump, they've got somebody ready to fight back. And the word is most of the FBI does not like the corrupt leadership that protected the Clintons and Obama.
[25:16.000 --> 25:23.000]  And Comey was a big part of that. He was involved in the big bank that was involved, HSBC and all the money laundering.
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.000]  I mean, it's just incredible. He's got that Leave it to Beaver act going on. He's really Eddie Haskell.
[25:30.000 --> 25:37.000]  And you know, gee, gee, Mrs. Cleaver. Sorry, we're going to let all these Islamists stand. Oh gee, sorry about the year of spring.
[25:37.000 --> 25:47.000]  Oh gee, sorry about Obama ordering the borders open. We did nothing. Oh, sorry. Gee, about Bill Clinton and stealing all the money from the Haitian refugees or all the pedophilia going on.
[25:48.000 --> 26:02.000]  Oh gee, Mrs. Cleaver. Sorry, we can't do that. Now here comes Mueller who doesn't have that much baggage but still involve the deep state.
[26:02.000 --> 26:10.000]  We've got Dr. Corsi joining us. He seems to think this is a good move that was done by the Deputy Attorney General.
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.000]  It's changed the subject off these diversions. But the problem is Trump's going around saying he doesn't like it.
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  And it's a witch hunt and that this has never happened to a president that hadn't done anything like him.
[26:22.000 --> 26:32.000]  And why didn't this happen to the Clintons or Obama? And he's absolutely right. So with Trump, you're really getting a very truthful guy who is very upset.
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  It's normal to meet with high level Russians when you're the main person running for president and the nominee.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  And Kushner did meet with the ambassador. That ambassador left those dinners and events.
[26:42.000 --> 26:56.000]  The Attorney General had to refuse himself because he had two meetings as a senator in the year previous with the Russian minister, the Russian ambassador.
[26:57.000 --> 27:06.000]  That's totally normal. In fact, it came out that Pelosi had something like 30 that year previous during the campaign and that sessions had only had two or three.
[27:06.000 --> 27:14.000]  Because the guy goes around asking for things. That's what an ambassador does. And when you're on these committees, you get visits from them.
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  But they're acting like now the president has them to the White House. It's bad.
[27:18.000 --> 27:24.000]  And they're also acting like if Trump goes and meets Putin, which he should have already done.
[27:25.000 --> 27:31.000]  He needs to go at this. He needs to go meet with Putin, laugh about it, make a joke about it because it is a joke.
[27:31.000 --> 27:44.000]  But more importantly, he needs to change the subject onto the fact that Comey is the one through his surrogates that either put out a fake memo or he's letting people make up memos that don't exist completely.
[27:45.000 --> 27:49.000]  And the whole story is just made up. Either the memo is fake or the whole memo story is made up.
[27:50.000 --> 27:56.000]  And Comey is just letting that hang out there as a lie, but he didn't do it or he perjured himself to Congress.
[27:56.000 --> 28:04.000]  Those are the three things. The memos either are fake and the media and the FBI and the deep state, the Democrats and Republican establishment are going along with it.
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000]  That's one. Or the memo itself is real, but it's it's it's fake.
[28:11.000 --> 28:19.000]  Or the memo is real and it really happened. I guess there's four things or he perjured himself to Congress.
[28:19.000 --> 28:26.000]  I mean, there are the different possibilities they cannot cook up anymore.
[28:27.000 --> 28:33.000]  So either Trump didn't ever say this and Comey told the truth there and the memo doesn't exist.
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  Or the memo exists and it's fake and Comey's lying either in the memo or on the stand.
[28:39.000 --> 28:45.000]  He's contradicted himself. Let's play the clip one more time. It's up on infowars.com right now. Here it is.
[28:45.000 --> 28:56.000]  So if the attorney general or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.000]  In theory, yes.
[28:59.000 --> 29:00.000]  As it happened?
[29:01.000 --> 29:08.000]  Not in my experience because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something that without appropriate purpose.
[29:08.000 --> 29:14.000]  I mean, we're oftentimes they give us opinions that we don't see a case there and so you ought to stop investing resources in it.
[29:15.000 --> 29:20.000]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason. That would be a very big deal.
[29:21.000 --> 29:22.000]  It's not happened in my experience.
[29:23.000 --> 29:26.000]  That's just incredible, isn't it?
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  Good luck. Comey getting out of that one, buddy. Good luck.
[29:31.000 --> 29:41.000]  Good luck. Bill Clinton got Trump elected because he was dumb enough to go on that airplane and then Comey had to come out and at least tell part of the truth to have any credibility at the FBI.
[29:41.000 --> 30:01.000]  That was the beginning of the end, though, wasn't it, Comey? Because you've caught your tail in our rat trap.
[30:12.000 --> 30:20.000]  Even after the miserable failure that was his first, Hillary Clinton starting a new super PAC since the Clinton Foundation hasn't made enough money to raise money to fight President Trump.
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  Now the Democrats are smashing records and online donations.
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  The Democrats should be thanking Trump for making them so much money.
[30:27.000 --> 30:39.000]  To put the rush of cash into perspective, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised $19.7 million in 2015 but have raised $20 million so far this year with contributions averaging $18 chomping the chumps.
[30:39.000 --> 30:45.000]  Compare that to the $1.7 million raised by the National Republican Congressional Committee and, well, it doesn't compare, does it?
[30:46.000 --> 30:53.000]  This is all in a desperate push to win back the 24 seats needed to control the House of Representatives to put Nancy Pelosi back as majority House leader.
[30:54.000 --> 30:58.000]  But just like the 2016 presidential election, Democrats will waste their money and come out on bottom.
[30:58.000 --> 31:08.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  To the best job you can to purify your air.
[31:32.000 --> 31:38.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[31:39.000 --> 31:40.000]  The general public doesn't.
[31:41.000 --> 31:44.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:45.000 --> 31:48.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:49.000 --> 31:55.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:55.000 --> 31:58.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today.
[31:58.000 --> 32:25.000]  Infowars.com.
[32:29.000 --> 32:35.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[32:36.000 --> 32:43.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[32:44.000 --> 32:51.000]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new bubblegum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint free.

[33:21.000 --> 33:26.000]  In Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:26.000 --> 33:51.000]  During the break I was working on a tweet but ran out of time running back here on air so we have to add the link into it before we send it out.
[33:51.000 --> 34:05.000]  In his perjury that is becoming more and more evident, we have Chuck E. Schumer two days ago, one of the most brazen, arrogant people that I've ever seen in my life, a literal cartoon villain,
[34:06.000 --> 34:14.000]  hopping around saying, you know, impeach Trump having a surrogate to push for it, just a red terror of control and anti-Americanism.
[34:14.000 --> 34:23.000]  We've got him up there praising the Comey memo that it's real and it's true and he's on those different important committees that have oversight.
[34:24.000 --> 34:39.000]  He's the ranking Democrat now in the Senate and he's running around praising the Comey memo to see, oh, they're saying it's real, they're saying Comey really did it, he's ready to testify but only with immunity.
[34:39.000 --> 34:44.000]  Remember when Flynn wanted immunity, he was the biggest criminal ever but when Comey wants it, it's no big deal.
[34:45.000 --> 34:56.000]  He wants to testify as a FBI agent, as the director, not as a citizen and he's now been caught on May 3rd saying no one tried to influence the FBI but that would be a big deal.
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.000]  Schumer challenges Trump, if Comey memo is wrong, prove it.
[35:01.000 --> 35:08.000]  He wants the tapes the president has, well that's a separation of powers between the legislative and the executive and you know that.
[35:09.000 --> 35:15.000]  Don't you, you little tyrant, wicked witch of DC.
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  We're going to play that clip and then play the Comey clip again.
[35:19.000 --> 35:38.000]  If you just joined us, Kit Daniels has the big breaking news on infowars.com, hiding in plain view, May 3rd Senate Judiciary Committee, the full testimony is up there, the full transcript on infowars.com will show you Kit Daniels article, it's red linked on infowars.com right now.
[35:38.000 --> 35:48.000]  Breaking, Comey caught committing perjury to Congress, question mark, Comey's May 3rd Senate testimony contradicts reported February memo.
[35:49.000 --> 35:58.000]  And they're now saying that memo is his but they don't want to show us the actual details of it, they just want to paraphrase what's in it.
[35:58.000 --> 36:14.000]  At most it's the president saying he's a good guy, didn't do anything, this witch hunt needs to end, but you know, I hope you can see it to do that, I mean I hope your investigation ends that way, I hope this guy's innocent, that's not obstruction of justice, plus he's the president.
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.000]  There's a higher standard of obstruction of justice when it's his own agency he controls.
[36:18.000 --> 36:27.000]  And Jonathan Turley, the big liberal professor is out in the news today saying that, and so is everybody else because it's a fact.
[36:28.000 --> 36:34.000]  So the president didn't do anything, and he sure didn't commit all the crimes of the Clintons and all the rest of the garbage they've been involved in.
[36:34.000 --> 36:50.000]  But they're everywhere saying impeach, impeach, impeach, and the seediest Democrats ever with investigations on almost all of them for all the big city corruption they're involved in, they're running around saying bring us the head of Donald J. Trump on a platter and MSM saying kill him.
[36:50.000 --> 37:07.000]  Oh, and then even talk show hosts who have late night shows on TV are having to apologize and say, I'm so sorry I ever was nice to Trump and ever rubbed on his hair and showed it was real, I don't like him, please don't fire me, please don't take my job.
[37:07.000 --> 37:21.000]  And then Alan just lost his TV show. Tim Allen, he can't believe he lost his show, but they said because you're political, you're supporting free speech, we don't do that.
[37:21.000 --> 37:37.000]  And then we have footage today from the FCC in DC at the Occupy, the FCC event with the Democrats and the communists, they're there in their communist office, they're red fists, they're red bandanas with info wars dot com, drudge report dot com and Breitbart dot com
[37:37.000 --> 37:53.000]  signs saying ban us and their official literature says ban hate. That's the net neutrality of Obama. That's the Soros funded net neutrality where we're taking the internet over the FCC is and the Democrats are to keep it safe.
[37:54.000 --> 38:01.000]  So Hillary intended to do all this when she got in she said she was but see Trump got in there but the deep state said we don't care.
[38:01.000 --> 38:12.000]  We're going to just move forward right now. So we've got this special counsel special prosecutor they're calling it both that they've put in there Robert Mueller will see former FBI director before James Comey.
[38:12.000 --> 38:31.000]  James Comey. But the big news is Chucky Schumer says the memo is real. But nobody gets to see a copy of it but the Washington Post The New York Times. And then we've got Comey. We've got Comey in his testimony. I want to play that first May 3rd.
[38:31.000 --> 38:42.000]  Hiding in plain view. Senator to share committee saying no one tried to influence the investigation. That'd be a big deal and no one, no one. This is him two months later.
[38:42.000 --> 39:02.000]  Three months later. February. He's meeting with him. Repeatedly. February. March, April, May two and a half months later on May 3rd. He's in there telling him on C span to to the committee that it's just ridiculous.
[39:02.000 --> 39:16.000]  He's never heard of such a thing. While he's got a memo. He's filed. That his surrogates are shopping around and saying that's intent is obstruction of justice.
[39:16.000 --> 39:36.000]  And he's ready to testify to Congress as long as he gets immunity when we have him dead in the water. So the minute he says that memo is real and the minute he interprets it as an attempt to obstruct justice he has now committed perjury on one end or the other.
[39:36.000 --> 39:56.000]  Here is Chuckie Schumer. The topic of Mr. Comey. If the president has tapes of his conversation with Mr. Comey, we ought to be able to review those tapes as well to see if the president pressured the FBI director to shut down an active investigation.
[39:56.000 --> 40:09.000]  The Times reported that Mr. Comey kept temperate contemporaneous memos of his conversations with the president. And Mr. Comey has a reputation for accuracy in those memos.
[40:09.000 --> 40:25.000]  Oh, okay. So this is a real memo. And of course they've been saying that for days, but I just want to get it clear. The leading Democrat, the Senate says it's real. And it's accurate. It's like the word of God, like Moses took it down from Mount Sinai.
[40:25.000 --> 40:47.000]  Okay, this is from the ex-cathedra. This is like from the Pope. This is absolutely the word of God. So he perjured himself. In the words of Darth Vader, I have you now. Now let's go to the clip we're talking about. This is on infowars.com that needs to go mega viral right now. Here it is.
[40:47.000 --> 40:57.000]  So if the attorney general or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation, can they halt that FBI investigation?
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  In theory, yes.
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  Has it happened?
[41:01.000 --> 41:21.000]  Not in my experience, because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something that without appropriate purpose. I mean, we're oftentimes they give us opinions that we don't see a case there. And so you ought to stop investing resources in it. But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason. That would be a very big deal.
[41:22.000 --> 41:23.000]  It's not happened in my experience.
[41:23.000 --> 41:37.000]  Not happened. The FBI director at the time. Not happened. And again, it's on info wars. We're also going to clear it out on my regular real Alex Jones, former FBI director has perjured himself.
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  That is absolutely critical.
[41:40.000 --> 42:08.000]  I have tweeted this at real Donald Trump at real Donald Trump bombshell. Comey caught perjuring himself to Congress contradicts own memo. No one trying to block Russia investigation may third two and a half months after the personal meeting where he puts out this memo saying it caught red handed, perjuring himself to Congress, perjuring himself to Congress, perjuring himself to Congress, perjuring himself to Congress.
[42:08.000 --> 42:27.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we need this. This just went out. This needs 10,000 retweets. And I know I came to Twitter late. I never really promote Twitter. I'm trying to do it more. Paul Watson has a huge following. He has more impressions of the BBC does.
[42:27.000 --> 42:45.000]  I need to call Paul and ask him to retweet this. Everyone needs to retweet the tweet at real Alex Jones right now at Donald Trump and at the FBI and at local radio stations and everybody, you know, we need to get a red siren on drugs report about this.
[42:46.000 --> 42:54.000]  I never asked Roger to do that or somebody else can write the story. I don't even want the credit. I just want to defeat this, ladies and gentlemen, because this is such a big deal.
[42:54.000 --> 43:04.000]  Now joining us to talk about a battle plan to strike back against this, defeating the deep state mainstream media planning coup d'etat counterintelligence. Step one, it changed the subject.
[43:05.000 --> 43:11.000]  Colonel Schaffer's come out and said the same things happening. Dennis Kucinich has come out and said the same thing. This is main line. This is happening.
[43:11.000 --> 43:24.000]  Dana Bash admits that's the plan, but she's pushing it like it's a good thing. Trump comes out and says it's so unfair. Trump claims no politician in history has been treated worse than commencement speech.
[43:25.000 --> 43:39.000]  He's absolutely right. And then now we have Comey saying there was no effort to halt the investigation two months after he puts out an internal memo saying the opposite reportedly, wow, the arrogance, the stupidity.
[43:39.000 --> 43:47.000]  I guess he thought he never needed to use that fake memo. That was just a little weird insurance policy. Comey, you know, cooked up famous FBI tactic.
[43:48.000 --> 43:56.000]  Well, FBI is getting caught in its own tactics. And again, most of the FBI is not bad people. A lot of them are listeners. They've helped us with good intel on stuff. They can't stand Comey.
[43:57.000 --> 44:06.000]  And Comey is really getting caught up in this because we know with these special prosecutors, they never get you for what they claim they were going after. It's always something else somebody else did.
[44:06.000 --> 44:16.000]  So that's why Trump is upset about the new special investigator or special counsel, special prosecutor. I've heard all three names because he knows he's done nothing wrong.
[44:17.000 --> 44:27.000]  And he's saying, why not the Clintons? Why not Obama? Why me? But then folks like Corsi have told me privately. No, this changes the subject. There's nothing there. And now it takes it away from the Democrats so they can't make it political.
[44:27.000 --> 44:43.000]  Now, we also have another story on Drudge that's apologize of Watson article that we're going to get to police departments talking up on riot year in preparation for summer of rage.
[44:44.000 --> 44:49.000]  Soros has doubled the amount of money for the anti police, anti free market, anti Trump people.
[44:49.000 --> 44:57.000]  Believe me, they're all in there in my face all over the place from the streets of Austin. So things are escalating quickly to break all of this down is Dr Jerome Corsi.
[44:58.000 --> 45:03.000]  What a time doc to be alive and to be shing all this unfold first off. And we'll hold you in the next hour.
[45:04.000 --> 45:15.000]  If you can't get a lot of angles to cover here. What do you make of the Comey testimony surfacing and the fact that this has been hiding in plain view for the last week with really nobody else pointing it out?
[45:15.000 --> 45:25.000]  Well, I think Comey has a serious problem and that he's made a clear in testimony under oath to Congress that there was no interference politically in his investigation.
[45:26.000 --> 45:38.000]  And clearly the investigation has continued. So there's no effort and there's going to be no documentation that President Trump did anything to really stop the investigation.
[45:38.000 --> 45:45.000]  I can show you things that Richard Nixon did to stop various actions of Congress, etc. This is dramatically different.
[45:46.000 --> 45:55.000]  And the conversation that President Trump had with Comey in the White House, first of all, we only have one side of that conversation recorded.
[45:56.000 --> 46:06.000]  And if President Trump only said, please is there any way you can let up on that's very different from I'm ordering you to stop the investigation.
[46:06.000 --> 46:14.000]  Well, plus he said, if you believe the memo, see your way. Your way means your investigation. See it your way where it's in the right.
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  I don't think he's saying anything wrong. He's a great guy. Yeah, he's a great guy.
[46:19.000 --> 46:23.000]  But even if that memo is real, they've let the media put out that this is some type of obstruction of justice.
[46:24.000 --> 46:33.000]  So they're guilty of slandering and defaming the president and allowing a lie to be put out based on his memo when he's perjured himself saying that he doesn't believe that's what it is.
[46:33.000 --> 46:42.000]  So either way you slice it, it's defamation, it's sedition, it's disinformation campaigns against the president with the colluding media, or he's perjured himself. Which is it?
[46:43.000 --> 46:58.000]  Well, and I think you're right. And what's what I'm pointing out in this article is that, you know, and how they can compete against this disinformation campaign because the entire Russian collusion is classic disinformation.
[46:58.000 --> 47:03.000]  It's a lie. There's no basis for it.
[47:04.000 --> 47:14.000]  Here's an example. I was watching a Newsweek clips this morning on YouTube and I was watching Washington Post video clips and they're all saying even sessions got caught working with the Russians and tried to cover it up.
[47:15.000 --> 47:20.000]  So he had to recuse himself. He never got caught. He never did anything wrong. So they're just lying on every front.
[47:20.000 --> 47:32.000]  Well, that's the whole purpose of the memo. It's designed to continue its life even against news and proof that there's no evidence.
[47:33.000 --> 47:43.000]  Now the first article that I wrote made the point that you do not beat a propaganda campaign that's kind of misinformation by truth.
[47:43.000 --> 47:54.000]  In other words, proof that there is no evidence is not going to stop the Democrats from saying, oh, but we might find evidence. We're going to investigate keeping it alive.
[47:55.000 --> 48:08.000]  Now by pointing a special counselor and differently special prosecutor, limited powers, special counsel is that all these questions now all have to be referred into the Justice Department.
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.000]  So that's more fake news when the media kept calling it a special prosecutor.
[48:13.000 --> 48:21.000]  It's not a special prosecutor. It's a special counselor, a very different distinction. Mueller's authorities do not include prosecution.
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.000]  It's advisory.
[48:23.000 --> 48:38.000]  It's investigation only. He's there to counsel the Department of Justice as to what he finds and he might be able to call a grand jury, but that's different from prosecuting. It was going to be prosecuted. That's up to the Department of Justice, not up to Mueller.
[48:39.000 --> 48:50.000]  Now, Mueller, in doing this, this puts the issue, the propaganda issue is now in a proper jurisdiction where truth does matter.
[48:50.000 --> 49:02.000]  And Mueller is going to be able to distinguish between conversations that were held in the normal course of business and collusion. Collusion is going to be very hard to prove.
[49:03.000 --> 49:11.000]  Sure, because they spend it. I mean, take sessions. He met in the year before during the campaign, but not as a part of the campaign with the Russian ambassador to the United States.
[49:12.000 --> 49:17.000]  Totally normal. Pelosi met 30 plus times the same year. Said she didn't get caught on her own records and on video doing it.
[49:17.000 --> 49:29.000]  But that's normal. And of course, he went sessions when I didn't lie. Of course, I met with him on the Intelligence Committee, but I didn't or the Armed Services Committee, but I didn't meet with him on the campaign trail in that capacity.
[49:30.000 --> 49:40.000]  It's a different hat. But then the media plays games with that. Mueller will be tied to what the law is and the legal specifics, not just this overblown MSM lie.
[49:40.000 --> 49:48.000]  Yeah, because see now the innuendo, which in the court of public opinion would have kept the propaganda memo live.
[49:49.000 --> 50:00.000]  To Mueller is going to be inconsequential because Mueller will distinguish based upon law that in the order course of business Nancy Pelosi, many others met with a Russian ambassador.
[50:00.000 --> 50:16.000]  It's no crime to meet with the Russian ambassador, but the crime here would have to constitute some very strict standards of proof. In other words, that there was a plan was perpetrated to somehow or other influence the government for money or other goods.
[50:17.000 --> 50:28.000]  Yeah, you'd have to be selling the country out somehow, not meeting with the Russian ambassador. That doesn't mean anything with the goal with the goal of throwing the election to Donald Trump away from Hillary Clinton.
[50:28.000 --> 50:39.000]  Now, first of all, even if the emails are out there, there's no proof that the emails affected anybody's vote. So that's a big problem in proving collusion legally.
[50:40.000 --> 50:52.000]  Number two, you've got the issue that it looks like this rich Seth, the DNC operative that was killed was the one who released the emails.
[50:52.000 --> 50:59.000]  We're going to come back and talk about that more and the Democrats wanting to openly ban info wars. Stay with us.

[54:21.000 --> 54:28.000]  At real Donald Trump bombshell, Comey caught perjuring himself to Congress.
[54:29.000 --> 54:35.000]  Contradix, his own memo, says no one trying to block Russia investigation.
[54:36.000 --> 54:42.000]  We should probably get that 30-second clip itself and upload it to Twitter on our Periscope and actually embed it as a new tweet.
[54:42.000 --> 54:49.000]  We need this to go mega viral. We need everyone to retweet this.
[54:50.000 --> 54:55.000]  It's incredible. We can get a million, two million views easily on a Facebook video. Same thing on YouTube.
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.000]  I have always been weak on Twitter. Paul Watson has dominated it. I need everybody's help.
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  This is a war, folks. So many people go, oh, you know, Trump's not perfect, so I'm abandoning him.
[55:05.000 --> 55:12.000]  This is when Trump, he's our support. The globalist hate him. He killed TPP. He's brought trillions back to our country.
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.000]  He's building a wall. The illegals are down 43% coming in. He got a conservative appointed.
[55:20.000 --> 55:25.000]  They're going to try to reverse everything if they have their way. Just briefly, we fund this operation with high quality products.
[55:26.000 --> 55:31.000]  And it's spent years, in the last seven years, we've spent a lot of time, but really the last two years,
[55:31.000 --> 55:37.000]  trying and testing to get a super high quality line of personal care products.
[55:38.000 --> 55:44.000]  And then finally, because so many companies weren't as the high quality they said they were, or it was too expensive, or they didn't want to work with us.
[55:45.000 --> 55:50.000]  This is one of the top brands in the country. Private label by us now called EmRick's Essentials.
[55:51.000 --> 55:56.000]  The deodorant, the sunscreen, the shampoo, all of it.
[55:56.000 --> 56:08.000]  Just take the organic mouthwash, 10 to 1 concentrate, ounce for ounce, the same as other organic mouthwashes, but at 10 times less money.
[56:09.000 --> 56:15.000]  Because it's concentrated 10 to 1, but a little splash in your glass of water, really strong mouthwash, herbal, really powerful.
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.000]  No reviews yet because we just started selling this two days ago, but this is private labeled.
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.000]  A brand's been around for more than 20 years. The owner is a great patriot. He's working with us.
[56:24.000 --> 56:30.000]  This is so exciting. Everybody at the office that has tried this loves it. My family has used it. They cannot believe how good it is.
[56:31.000 --> 56:39.000]  It's 20% off than the national brand in stores, not just national brands, but the very brand in stores.
[56:40.000 --> 56:44.000]  And then 25% off when you sign up for auto ship, other stuff we have is 10%.
[56:45.000 --> 56:50.000]  I want you to see how great this is. That equals 45% off on EmRick's Essentials out of the gate.
[56:50.000 --> 56:55.000]  And that way you get it each month or every three months, four months, however you want to sign up.
[56:56.000 --> 57:03.000]  You can quit auto ship anytime. You could go sign up, get the 45% off and then, you know, cancel, not getting it the next month if you want.
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.000]  But I hope you'll stay with us because we need the funding to build this independent media operation.
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.000]  You see how we're under attack because we are having an effect because we have the sources and because we're not cowards will tell the truth.
[57:14.000 --> 57:24.000]  EmRick's Essentials, organic mouthwash, 10 to 1, natural herbal body wash, shampoo, the natural zinc oxide that's not in nanos.
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.000]  It doesn't go through your skin and become toxic. It's the best out there. Very, very low prices.
[57:30.000 --> 57:36.000]  Natural deodorant without the heavy metals or without the other garbage or additives or the aluminum or the titanium.
[57:36.000 --> 57:43.000]  It's all there. Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  And we're selling, Trump is my president, new navy blue shirts at cost.
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.000]  Even though the Trump shirts have gotten popular again, as people see, he's embattled and they see him firing Comey.
[57:53.000 --> 57:59.000]  We're selling them at cost to flood the streets with them to stand up against the anti-free speech garbage, you name it.
[57:59.000 --> 58:07.000]  495, whether it's a small or an XXXL, my friend, that's below cost because an XXXL costs like six bucks.
[58:08.000 --> 58:14.000]  The average shirt costs like 450. So again, that's at cost. Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[58:15.000 --> 58:21.000]  Three different variants. Trump is my president, Trump pens 2020, keeping America great again with Infowars.com on the back and the right shoulder.

[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  We've got massive breaking news.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  We just tweeted this out about 20 minutes ago. It's got 758 retweets. It needs 10,000.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  You're doing a great job, folks. At Real Donald Trump, tweeted at him, Bombshell Comey caught perjuring himself to Congress, contradicts own memo.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  No one trying to block Russia investigation. This proves everything Trump has said. This is so massive. Bombshell Comey caught perjuring himself to Congress, contradicts own memo.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  Everybody else is retweeting it. I want to thank General Deplorable and everybody else that's taking action.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  I've got Corsi in this segment, a little bit into the next. Then we've got Doug Hagman with all his great intel in the northeast with his law enforcement sources about where this is going.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  But getting into the article, defeating Deep State mainstream media planning coup d'etat, counterintelligence, step one, change the subject. What's amazing is the Democrats and others admit they're lying and trying to overthrow Trump.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  They know this is targeting dumbed down people. So how do we get around that? The truth doesn't seem to work against it. So what do we do, Dr. Corsi?
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  Well, this is the point. I'm laying out a strategy, which is a technical counterintelligence strategy, as to how you beat a propaganda campaign that's aimed at you, propaganda campaign aimed at Trump on Russian collusion.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  I'm saying the first thing is you can't beat it with facts by proving that there's no evidence doesn't stop the propaganda campaign.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  Now, changing the subject does. And the first step, appointing a special counselor who has to get to the next step to become a prosecutor still has to establish even that a crime was committed.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  And I sent you the authorizing jurisdiction. He can look at even any matters that arise from the investigation, like maybe it was others who were actually colluding with the Russians, including Hillary Clinton and Podesta.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  But this changes the subject because now any new information.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  Oh, that's the headline. Now I get what you were trying to tell me last time this morning. I was being dense. Mueller can investigate anybody. And this is actually what Trump's been wanting. So maybe Trump shouldn't get so upset because now they really are in bed with the Russians.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Well, see, the point is that the way this is written, if you look at it very carefully, it says, first of all, that they're going to investigate the Russian government and individuals associated with a campaign of President Trump.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  And number two, any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation, such as that it was Hillary Clinton and Podesta that were coordinating.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  And these are the kinds of issues or that it was Seth, which is named Seth Rich, the guy who was killed, the DNC, who may have handed over the 44,000 emails to Podesta.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  All that under point two is within the subject matter of what the special counselor, or look at the topic, special counselor is not special prosecutor.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  It says in C, a special counselor believes it's necessary and appropriate. He may then proceed to prosecute, but the authority to prosecute is not yet given because there's no establishment yet of a crime.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  Now, President Trump may feel this was written against him and should have also included Hillary and Podesta and the others.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  But what it does is it changes the subject because now any new evidence that comes up, all the White House has to say is under investigation.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  We're going to let that proceed with the special counselor. This is going to take a long time.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  It's not going to be done in a week, and it diverts the entire advance of the propaganda meme in the sphere of the mainstream media.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  Sure. So then why is Trump upset about it?
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  Well, Trump probably doesn't like the fact there's a special counselor mentioning him by name in point one, and he probably hasn't thought it all the way through yet.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  But in fact, it's a very, very sophisticated move to stop the Democrats from developing this story every day in their partner, the mainstream media.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  That's not blocked.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  Let me ask you about the rumors that this could be a deep state move to destabilize Trump, make him resign and put Pence in, but they've been keeping out of the whole Russian thing since day one.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  Let me ask you about that straight ahead.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  We've got to get to these other steps that he can take, because it's very important.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  All right, William, we'll get to those, and then we'll also hit the FCC demonstration today where they called for info or should be banned with signs.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  Earlier this week, President Trump met with the president of Turkey when protesters took the streets outside the Turkish embassy in D.C. to protest President Erdogan's policy towards free speech and dissonance.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  Just to get a lick in on the American, nine people were injured and required a visit to the hospital, and two people have been arrested for aggravated assault on a police officer.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  The D.C. police say they intend on pursuing more charges.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  This is professional Turkish security in America oppressing free speech just as their leader has in Turkey.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  This is a Turkish president who supports, even threatens nations with, open borders.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  If supposed high standing individuals and professionals representing Turkey behave like this, imagine what kind of dregs may be infiltrating this country and other countries with open borders and how they might treat American men, women and children on the streets.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:58.000]  Just check out how they behave in Europe, and you'll understand.
[1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  For infowars.com, this is Owen Troyer.

[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  A new shipment of bio trusillinium is now available at infowarslife.com.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  We've been sold out for months.

[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are well known.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  Bio trusillinium is also the perfect supercharger to survive shield x2 nascent iodine.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  As both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.

[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  We didn't ask for this fight but we're in this fight.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  This is the time to support InfoWars. That's infowarslife.com.
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  The president has tapes of his conversation with Mr. Comey.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  We ought to be able to review those tapes as well.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  To see if the president pressured the FBI director to shut down an active investigation.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  The Times reported that Mr. Comey kept contemporaneous memos of his conversations with the president.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  And Mr. Comey has a reputation for accuracy in those memos.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  So if the attorney general or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  can they halt that FBI investigation?
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  In theory, yes.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  As it happened?
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  Not in my experience because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something without an appropriate purpose.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  We're often times they give us opinions that we don't see a case there and so you ought to stop investing resources in it.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  That would be a very big deal.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  It's not happened in my experience.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  If you take on the intelligence community they have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  So even for a practical supposedly hard-nosed businessman he's being really dumb to do this.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were motivated to?
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  I don't know but from what I've been told they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  And we need the intelligence community.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  We don't know.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  Look at the Russian hacking.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  Without the intelligence community we wouldn't have discovered it.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  Oh no, we wouldn't have discovered the foreign outside enemy force overtaking the country like globalism, right Schumer?
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  So notice you got Schumer two days ago saying thank goodness for Comey.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  He's the best guy.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  He's so known to be so accurate in these memos.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  When Schumer said he's horrible he should be fired over and over again just a few months ago and Hillary just two weeks ago.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  But now, oh, Comey's their best friend ever and we need these tapes.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  And then we play you a tape from May 3rd of Comey saying never happened, didn't happen, two months after this supposed memo.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  You could not discredit Schumer more.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  They'll be cut to a clip of Schumer with President-elect Trump saying watch out, the intelligence community has a way to bring you down.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  Clapper said shut your mouth.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  Brennan said shut your mouth.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  I mean the arrogance of these people is incredible.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  Dr. Corsi finishing up with your article on infowars.com.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  Defeating the deep state, the battle plan, mainstream media plan Cude talk, counterintelligence, step one, change the subject now with a special counsel who can also investigate the Democrats.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  Step two, what else?
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  Well, if you just take a look, I mean this is how you basically get this Russian collusion meme to recede into the background.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  Just truth isn't going to do it.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  Let's take for an example, let's say that it develops that it's justified and necessary to have a war with North Korea that we have to attack North Korea.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  Now, I'm not recommending that we do attack North Korea.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  And I'm saying as an example only, let's assume it comes to the point where it's absolutely necessary to attack North Korea to reduce their nuclear capacity.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  The minute that happens, the new cycle is going to get 100% taken by the North Korean attack and the meme on Russian collusion disappears immediately.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  There's no oxygen for it.
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  That's an example of changing the subject.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  Next week, President Trump is going to go on this overseas trip.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  Saudi Arabia, the Vatican, he's going to end up in Israel and go to Belgium for a NATO's meeting.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  He's going to be in Italy with the G7.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  He's got plenty of opportunity to change the subject, to force the mainstream media to cover the news he's creating in foreign policy.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  And the Russian collusion meme now goes in the background because we're going to say, wait a minute, well, that's all Mueller.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  We can't talk about it anyway.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  It's under investigation.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  It's all going to be referred into Mueller.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  And by the way, anybody who leaks anything like these notes from Comey or anything else is now committing a crime violating the special counsel and violating the potentially might create a grand jury.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  So, you know, you've got a new crime created for any more leaks.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  All the conversation of the Russian collusion has to go in the background because it's now been referred to.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  Is that an accurate statement I've seen from MSM that Mueller is known for going after leakers because these are the known crimes being committed and they're using the supposed leak to make stuff up.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  They're using the national security dome as a way to actually manufacture frauds that can't be pierced because they hide behind that wall.
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  And I think this is a great example of this memo that's come out that they won't even show us that in the timeframe of two months after the FBI director at the time contradicts himself.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  I mean, what do you think is really going on here?
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  Well, first of all, the point I'm trying to make is that the power of the presidency is so great and so extensive that the president can change the subject anytime the president wants to.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  And the Clinton administration was the wag the dog movie, if you remember.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  Sure, blowing up aspirin factors, you name it, the thing that Trump did with the missile strikes in Syria.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  But I'm saying if it's done legitimately, not as a wag the dog, I'm not advocating a wag the dog.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  I understand.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  But if it comes out legitimately that we have to take action militarily in North Korea immediately, 100% of the news cycle gravitates to that subject.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  And the Russian mem is pushed to the back and we're not calling for that.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  The point is those the type of things that could come to the fore.
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  What are other current crises that are going on that the president could go after and legitimately distract from this giant anti-American lie that is publicly designed to bring down the country into globalism?
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  Well, let's say the president goes into Israel and comes out of Saudi Arabia with an agreement there's going to be a type of a NATO formed among the cooperating Muslim countries to go after ISIS.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  And Israel agrees to apply intelligence to it.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  There's new potential that there could be a breakthrough in the Middle East fighting iris with ISIS with the combination of Israel in the background and the Saudis, perhaps the other forces.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  That will be seen as another giant victory.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  And of course the word is that's why they leaked this fake thing that Trump leaked info on Israel about the bombs and laptops when it was in the news three months ago was again to try to spin the narrative going into Israel because they don't want Trump to be able to make deals and have peace.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  But it's going to be the news coming that the president has the ability to generate news that will command the attention of the media. Even the image of Air Force One landing in Saudi Arabia and Israel landing in Brussels.
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  This is the kind of news that's going to dominate has to be covered.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  It's going to have to be shown in NBC and CBS and CBS and will be covered by the mainstream media and the public not following all the details of these crises are going to see the general image of the president being presidential and creating international policy which they like.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  It's the same thing in the domestic era.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  The president comes back and either signs new executive orders or implements them and reducing crime.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  Absolutely. Let me shift gears here.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  What about having the attorney general do his job and go after the Clintons for China gate which is open and shut. They've been on their payroll as you know for almost 30 years.
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  Missile secrets you name it. What about going after them for the Pito gate and Jeffrey Epstein.
[1:16:06.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  What about going after them for all the other crimes they've committed. What about the best defense being good offense.
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  All good ideas. All good ideas. But the point is when you're combating a disinformation campaign you've got to shift the subject. You can't rearrange the furniture in the room.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  In other words to say well the Clintons did this or the other people did that is pointing fingers around but you don't shut that dynamic down. You don't shut it down.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  I mean this is a psychological technique.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  I don't know. I think Hillary getting indicted. I think that'll change the subject real quick. I agree.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  It would but I'm saying you know somebody comes into the marriage counselor and says I think I've got marriage problems. Well that's now three years of marriage counseling and you know nothing ends up changing in the marriage as opposed to somebody saying I want a divorce.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  I've got a lawyer. Now everything's changed. I'm trying to find the kinds of techniques that work to change everything immediately.
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  Sure. Let's shift gears and I'm going to continue to check in with you as articles break. What about this whole other story that's on info wars dot com of the FCC protest occupy FCC run by this George Soros funded group with ban info war signs.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  Ban Breitbart signs ban drudge signs will put that article info wars dot com up on screen as soon as we can for TV viewers and then you go to their actual website. They call for us to be banned.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  We've got members of Congress. That's why they're trying to call me fake news and do all this stuff to try to get us to you know shut down is because they want to set the precedent for this. This is this is crazy.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  What do you think is going on here.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  Well and by the way we did this very quickly this morning kit put it together but if you'd put my byline on there as well because I wrote the copy on this.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  It's a very important article because you've got the protesters out there makes it clear that that neutrality is about censorship. It's about banning info wars.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  It's about banning Breitbart and what my article says in the text of it is that this is the direction it's been going from the beginning.
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  And there's the sign stop the hate regulate and that's the the Soros funded occupy FCC group that's going to the house of the head of it and everything else is crazy.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  Right or perhaps maybe I wrote an article I'd like my article to be posted the one I sent in to get I'll send it again because I did a narrative.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  They've been scrambling we're trying to hire more folks kids to the job. We'll get your article up with the photos as well.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  It came in so fast. I'll resend it again.
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  Here's your article all left demonstrators at FCC support Obama era net neutrality censorship rules with banned drugs and ban info wars and ban Breitbart signs.
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  Yeah I mean that's it like like Soros funded Democrats want drugs banned at FCC. I mean there's the headline. There's your article.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  I've got it even though it hasn't been fully posted. I think what happened is kit was already on it as that was happening and it's kind of added your stuff in.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  But we'll we'll post that separately with the photos as well. I'm trying to hire two or three people to help kit. He's kind of taking on the job of editor and everything else.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  Complaining. I just what I wrote in there I think is very important to be published because it will be ties it ties it together to explain to people that net neutrality is not about net neutrality.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  We support neutrality Obama called the takeover of the Internet last year net neutrality that's not what it is.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  It's not. It only affects the people there protesting from the Democrats have signed saying banned the hate on official website and official signs and then handmade one saying banned drugs ban info wars.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  This is crazy. All right Dr. Corsi thank you so much. They hate us because we'll show you a clip of Comey saying that nobody tried to influence the investigation two months after he wrote this memo saying the opposite.
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:20:00.000]  We'll expose perjury. We have a memory by the way. Of course he wrote the story about the Fannie Mae Freddie Mac. That's now confirmed again today.

Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea. Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack. When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.

[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  All right, syndicated talk show host, author, researcher, police and law enforcement trainer, Doug Hagman of HagmanReport.com is our guest.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  I appreciate him holding while I had a course. He finished up with that breakdown to do with us for the rest of the hour.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  There is so much to get into. I got a lot of questions for Doug, but I want to get his gestalt, the waterfront of where we're at right now.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  And then the next few segments, I've got a bunch of clips with Democrats going. This is deep state. We're going to bring Trump down and we're going to shut down the free press and we're going to kick the Republicans out of Congress.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  We're going to take the whole government over. Everybody's a Russian. And of course, there are some Russians trying to manipulate our elections. Every country does that to other countries.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  But we had all the globalists piled up on America trying to force feed Hillary, the Communist Chinese, the Pope, the EU, all of them.
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  I mean, hell, Obama runs over to Europe trying to stop Lepin. What do they go? All the elections thrown out. Obama's over here. That's part of politics.
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  But it's not. So again, we're joined by Doug Hagman here, HagmanReport.com. This is a short segment, long segment coming up, but I'm going to go through even because Senate saying it's a deep state takeover.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  Jonathan Turley saying it, WikiLeaks saying it, Colonel Schaefer saying it because it's the truth. But let's find out what's front and center for him.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  He's also pointed out this big Turkish attack on Armenians, the Armenian genocide, the Turk ambassador's house. They won't even allow peaceful protesters.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  They beat them up in front of everybody. This is who we're allied with against Christians. And that's why they hate Trump.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  Because Pence has given the speeches about Christian genocide and all that's happening. That's why the globalists hate him.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  So what do you think is really going on with all this craziness right now, Doug?
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  Oh, Alex. Well, first of all, thanks for having me. Second of all, to continue the thought, continuation of thought with Dr. Corsi.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  I trace this meme of this attack against Donald Trump and his legitimacy, of course, to directly to the lap of Obama as a minion of the deep state.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  And one thing, the clip that you showed with Charles Schumer talking there on the house or center floor, it would be nice if he himself would state, would admit to being of counsel to an organization called American Oversight.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  It's a 501c3 corporation or 501c3 entity, nonpartisan supposedly, but it was founded by Austin Evers and Melanie Sloan.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  Austin Evers is a former State Department lawyer under Obama. Melanie Sloan, of course, is a former federal prosecutor, worked for Schumer himself in of counsel.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  There is Schumer, but that entity there of which Schumer is part and parcel to is the engine supplying the legal ammunition against Donald Trump via the ethics route.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  That's number one, of course, and of course, people have to understand that this is a war of optics.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  Indeed, as Dr. Corsi pointed out, and you pointed out, and the optics here are going to look very bad if people are solidified into just this MSNBC narrative or CBSNBC narrative.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  It's total lies. It is a wall of fraud.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  Exactly, exactly. And speaking of lies, and this is something I've not heard anyone at all talk about, but, well, I take that back. I believe, handy, you might have mentioned this, but I was talking with a couple of federal prosecutors here this week.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  If Comey, and this is so important, if FBI Director Comey, as FBI Director, had maintained contemporaneous notes, and if he did what he said he did,
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  and that is to write down his memorandum of the conversation he had with Donald Trump, and did not take that to the Justice Department right then and there.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  That's obstruction.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  That is, again, 18 U.S.C. Section 4, misprison of felony, and as an agent of the government, it's a violation of 28 U.S.C. Section 1361, which requires a person of his position.
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  And so what that really tells us is this, either Comey never believed it was real obstruction of justice, and is now letting them use this memo out of context to claim that that's fraud against the country and the president and a bunch of other crimes,
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  or he did commit the obstruction of justice by not bringing it to the Justice Department and the file number.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  That's right. He's trying to straddle a barbed wire fence here, and he's going to have to make a decision one way or the other. Certainly he's not going to.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  Well, this is bombshell. Let's talk about these prosecutors, because I've mentioned that. I've seen that. It is true that if he thought that was happening, he had to bring it to the Justice Department immediately, or he's basically obstructing justice.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  He's aiding and abetting. So what are they saying needs to happen?
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:32.000]  Well, somebody is going to need to pressure, and this is going to have to come from the Department of Justice, the current Justice Department, to go in and to subpoena the records from Comey to determine whether or not those were contemporaneous records.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  And then from there, use that perhaps as leverage.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  Stay there, because you're an expert on this, I know. Let's walk through then how you think this could break, because you were the guy that broke here on the whole WikiLeaks and the laptop and the pedophile stuff, the underage girl, which all came out.
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:30:06.000]  So you've got great sources. Where do they think this is going with Doug Hackman? Stay with us, folks.
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  To raise money to fight President Trump. Now the Democrats are smashing records and online donations. The Democrats should be thanking Trump for making them so much money.
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  To put the rush of cash into perspective, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised $19.7 million in 2015, but have raised $20 million so far this year, with contributions averaging $18, chumping the chumps.
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  Compare that to the $1.7 million raised by the National Republican Congressional Committee, and well it doesn't compare, does it?
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  This is all in a desperate push to win back the 24 seats needed to control the House of Representatives, to put Nancy Pelosi back as majority House leader.
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  But just like the 2016 presidential election, Democrats will waste their money and come out on bottom. For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.

[1:33:12.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  I want all listeners to understand something. I never thought I'd be in this position but this is not about being a talk show host. It's not about being popular. This is now war.
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  And the Democrats admit it's a war. I've been telling you it's a war. They now say it's a deep state war to bring Trump down because he's actually trying to turn our economy on and it's going with policies of production and of family and of an honorable civilization.
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  And of the president actually being the president. He killed TPP. He got a conservative justice on. He's over delivered.
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  But a lot of people want to jump on the bandwagon that he's not perfect or oh he's done for. Let's move on because you don't want to be associated with somebody that's destroyed.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  I'm not comparing Donald Trump to Jesus Christ but Jesus Christ was destroyed and rose again.
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  George Washington lost for four or five years and then finally won the last year. I support Trump more now that he's got a bunch of hyenas all over him.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  He's done some stuff I don't like and when he does that I'll criticize it but they hate him because he's real and not out to get this country and everybody should be praying for him.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  Coming knowingly. Got up there in Congress and said nobody tried to influence him and that no one had said that and that was not true.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  Two and a half months after he wrote a memo saying Trump tried to get him to drop the investigation. Now he lied to Congress or the memos that lie.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  He's done. You imagine if Trump had been caught doing something like this.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  This is baloney and I'm so sick of people like Comey put on that good guy act on the rest of it.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  He sat there while the Clintons and Obama committed so many crimes it's ridiculous and we're sick of it.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  And look I don't expect our government to be perfect but to just try to have a prosperous good decent nation.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  That's the sin of the new world order. It wants to end success. It wants to end a mental class.
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  It wants to have a stagnant top down society. And that's why our own agencies who I'd never I've been big critics of them.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  But in this election they were MVPs getting Intel the American people to defeat Hillary because she was so bad.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  Our military said no to backing Al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria four years ago. They finally hit rock bottom and found their soul again.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  So I want to commend the government when it does the right thing but Trump is so obviously hated by the corrupt elites.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  We're going back to Doug Hagman here in a moment. Here's breaking news.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  U.S. forces strike pro regime forces in Syria.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  U.S. aircraft conduct airstrike on Syrian Army convoy.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  The U.S. sent aircraft strike Syrian regime vehicles today that violated a
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  Deconfliction zone set up around Al Teneff an army base where special forces are training Syrian militants.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  Syrian militants CBS News National Security Correspondent David Martin reports.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  That's exactly what I was worried about.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  McMaster wants 150,000 troops. He's got Marines and heavy artillery about 20,000 troops.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  They told the president we need these as a backup in case Syrian forces while we're driving on ISIS come and try to attack us.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  Well the Syrian forces were coming in that direction if you believe this report CBS News and the Associated Press.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  And so our aircraft had to take them out.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  Will this escalate now into a bigger crisis?
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  Because you know Trump didn't authorize this. You know that this was already demarcation lines set up.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  And do you really think that the Syrians crossed that line knowing they're bringing the United States in?
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  Is this a provocation, a Gulf of Tonkin-like event to get us into something wider?
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  Or is this what Corsi was talking about an hour ago and to me on the phone last night about
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  distracting from those trying to bring the country down.
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  I'm not a Machiavellian. I don't support stuff like this.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  I'm not saying this is going on but it doesn't look good.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  But then when Trump still is cutting the taxes and securing the border and going after ISIS and standing up for Christians being murdered
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  and you know not letting them sexualize children or resting pedophiles for the thousands.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  I go, wow, kind of glad he struck that base and got them off his back.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  But when does that end? You see.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  What happens when our guy starts using dirty tricks against the bad guys? Doesn't he become them?
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  I don't know what's going on at this point.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  This may just be that the Syrian forces belligerently went into a U.S. area and this happened.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  But that's the danger.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  The Syrian regime has violated the zone two times in the past few days.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  Martin reports. That means they were warned.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  In one incident, 37 regime vehicles drove within 18 miles of Al-Tanf,
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  which breached a 35-mile radius of the Army convoy.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  US aircraft had to buzz the regime and the convoy didn't turn around.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  They conducted an airstrike against some of the vehicles.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  Is this them probing?
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  In the second incident, an Army unnamed Syrian SU-22 fighter bomber entered the de-escalation zone
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  and was intercepted by a pair of F-22 fighter aircraft.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  It remains unclear as to why the Syrians violated the zone.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  Martin reports that Syrian forces are pushing eastwards towards the Euphrates River Valley,
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  which hints the idea that the regime may have been doing reconnaissance on their flank.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  The United States is pushing al-Qaeda and ISIS out with the Russians.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  The Syrians want to take back the country and not have the U.S. come back in and hand it over to somebody else.
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  Because the word is once they've kicked them out, al-Qaeda, ISIS, they're going to break up Syria into three parts.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  Which is what Assad agreed to do or at least hold elections.
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  So it looks like the military that made deals with Assad four years ago is getting ready to hold him to it.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  And that's the word from Trump is, hey, they were supposed to get rid of those chemicals.
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  They're at the base. We bombed them to let them know we mean business.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  But then McMaster says we're going to take out ISIS and we're going to take out Assad.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  Trump says, no, that's not what we're doing.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  Three days after I told you that was what he was planning because I had my sources very high level.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  I should say that. That was from the president.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  We'll just stop right there.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  So the president is dealing with people not following his orders.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  At least that's what it looks like to me.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  But then can McMaster or others trick him into a larger battle?
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  But then that becomes a distraction from all the Russiagate stuff.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  And so is it a good thing? No, because I don't want to use a war to save the country because we'll end up destroying the country in the end.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  Doug, we're all over the map. I want to get back to the bombshell info you were laying out talking to federal prosecutors about the fact that if Comey thought there was obstruction of justice or an attempt to stop the investigation.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  He'd have to report that to the Justice Department or he would become an obstructor aiding and abetting and a partner and an accomplice to the crime.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  I want to go back to that in a moment. Doug Hagman of Hagman and Hagman, the Hagman report.com.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  But this new information, U.S. aircraft conduct strikes on Syrian Army convoy. This is big.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  And that's a win-win for the deep state, in my view, because the media, one of the enemies, of course, of the Trump administration, enemies of constitutional liberty can say,
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  alright, that strike is a PR move. It's a move to distract from the special counsel being appointed.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  Oh, they would do it to then claim it's a false flag by Trump.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  Right. And then, of course, that helps the military, of course, in two ways. Number one, the armament supply.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  And second of all, it further erodes the support for Assad.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  So you've got, I mean, this is a beautiful tactic, an eloquent tactic by the deep state, in my view, if that's what it is.
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  Sure. Just like three days ago, they come out and say that he leaked intel to the Russians about laptop bombs that were on the news three months ago,
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  totally made up, but they just don't care. It shows that the deep state is right there at point blank range. My word is, through the NSA, it's McMaster.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  Well, exactly. And Donald Trump and the people who support, actually support Donald Trump, are busy playing whack-a-mole with the leakers and with the people who are on the inside attempting to take him down from the inside.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  You've got to watch McMaster, and of course, you've been very good at identifying people like Priebus and Paul Ryan and others.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  That's not hard.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  Well, yeah, I mean, Donald Trump has got a real big problem with the people. I mean, he's neck deep in the swamp, and his friends are-
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  And then we're bitching at him that he's got a crocodile on his leg and a bogey structure around his neck.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  Yeah, exactly. So in that, with that particular set of news, and I would expect to see more of that, and in particular, with respect to the military intelligence and the things,
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  I would expect to see some things happening with Hezbollah, watch Hezbollah too, making some moves in Israel and the Middle East and such.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  And even in Syria. So this is kind of a multifaceted, prong attack against Donald Trump and against the optics.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  Again, it's all about optics to the American people because the average person who's got their television channel stuck on CBS or NBC or MSNBC, all they hear is impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  You know, Al Green gets up on the House floor and says, oh, we've got to impeach Donald Trump. But going back to the narrative, which really began after inauguration,
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  shortly thereafter, when they cited the 25th Amendment Section 4, now they're citing, when they couldn't really get traction with that, now they're citing,
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  okay, we've got some, you know, from Anderson Cooper to Chris Matthews and Rachel Manow, we've got some real dirt here, we've got some real crimes taking place.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  And this is what might now my federal sources are saying, look, there are factions within the FBI. It's chaotic there.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  I mean, fistfights, maybe, you know, I mean, it's almost gone to fistfights in the FBI. It's that segment because of this.
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  Now, having said all of that, going back to what I said originally, when I spoke with one federal prosecutor who asked that not use her name,
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  she said, look, the big thing, a big deal on this Comey situation is focus on the 18 USC Section 4 misprison of felony,
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  because that if Comey is telling the truth, and if Comey, in fact, has that memo and did so contemporaneous to that event,
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  then he was obligated by law and by his position. And he knows this, where he should have taken that whole memo that he dictated
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  contemporaneously, taken that, walked it over to the DOJ and said, look, we've got a problem here.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  That's right, because then he's either obstructing or he's involved in blackmail and has opened up his own influence peddling operation.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  Exactly. But you cannot use, and this is, look, federal prosecutors deal with us all of the time. You cannot use this as a method of extortion.
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  You cannot put this in a drawer for use three months later as Comey did. And again, I don't hear too many people talking about this.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  Sure. But how much trouble is he in saying two months after, on May 3rd, two and a half months later, that no one ever came and no one tried to block him
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  when he's got a memo saying the opposite? I mean, he should be in deep trouble.
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  Right. I mean, that speaks to, of course, perjury and his own self-impeachment.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  You talk about impeachment of character and impeachment of facts, there it is.
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  So you can't believe a word out of his mouth now.
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  No, no, man, not at all. Not at all. And he should know, especially as the law is very clear in 28 USC section 1361, I believe it is,
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  where in his position, a person in his position has, is required to act accordingly.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  And there's another name for that law, and it escapes me now, but it does, it does.
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  Failure to report criminal activity you're aware of.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  Right. But that, that by itself as well serves as you pointed out as obstruction of justice by Comey.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  So these two things, in addition to with, in addition to what you said earlier with Dr. Corsi and others, look, this is a fight.
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  And here's, we said this from the beginning, that the deep state is looking for a civil war.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  Misprision of felony, is that it? Misprision of felony goes to 18 USC section 4, 28 USC 1361 is action required by any U.S. official,
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  any court official of the United States. By law as officers of the court or under their oath, the failure to execute their duty.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  Exactly, exactly. And depending on, depending on how, how big they fail or how bigly they fail, it determines what the, what the actual damage.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  Yeah, exactly. So you cannot have, like I said, you can't have Comey dictating this, knowing that there's a problem,
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  putting it in a drawer and saying, you know what, I'm just going to wait until the right time to bring this out.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  And that's what we see him doing. And then you've got, again, Charles Schumer on the House floor, center floor,
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  talking about, talking about these ethics of violations and violations of law, when in fact he is part and parcel to the very organization,
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  the 501c3 American oversight that works for Obama and also tangentially for the Clinton, the Clintons to impeach.
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  And I use that word not in the literal sense, but to impeach the credibility and legitimacy of Donald Trump.
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  But this is what we have here. And at the end of the day, you, you look at what Soros is doing and his other minions,
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  Total destabilization. Absolutely. And it's kind of like the, it's kind of like the guy or the wife saying, hey, you know what,
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  if I can't have my wife or my girlfriend or my husband, it's right, no one's going to have her.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  And this is what we're seeing today because that's the mentality. It's classic insane criminality.
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  They're openly saying kill the president or saying kill you, me, everybody. They're running around, thumbing at the mouth, lying everywhere.
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  They're saying the president did something with no proof when they're the ones running the country down, running the stock market down, destabilizing it, getting away with all these crimes.
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  And it's funny because the word is the Russia thing was going nowhere. It was made up.
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  That's why Comey had gone to Congress and said, oh no, nobody tried to stop me because they knew where this was going.
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  They were just going to use it and try to control the president. The word is he's just been mad and said, no, no, my, my, my designates didn't recommend it.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  I did it. And you know what? It is about them not going after leaks and it is about Russia because it's made up.
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:30.000]  And so that's what they can't stand is he's not scared. He's not hiding anything. He's totally pissed off. He didn't trust Comey.
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  He taped him. Of course he did. And so they don't know what to do because Trump isn't intimidated and quite frankly gets off on this game of chicken.
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  Trump, Trump is ready. He's going to run them over. He hasn't done any of this. That's why he goes out in public.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  He goes trillions more in the stock market, hundreds of billions in jobs, restoring the country, protecting the police, getting killed, taking care of veterans.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  You want that? I'm here. You want to go with the same scum? Go with them. Fine. Destroy me if you want to.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  I'm standing on this and that's the end of it. And they don't know what to do.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  Well, exactly. And the other, the other part of this, the never Trumpers and we, we have to really focus on the never Trumpers and the established from Republicans.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  The previous, the Ryan's and McCain. They're the fifth column. Exactly. And you know something?
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  I'm so tired of these snot nose, mealy mouth, spineless Republican conservatives. Exactly.
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  We wanted somebody to kill TPPs, secure the border, put conservatives on. He's doing it all.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  And they sit around and bitch where the strongman stumbled when they're not in the arena.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  And that's why I back Trump when he's under attack more than ever. And I expect that if I'm, if I'm going down.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  Exactly. And if we are in a war, if we truly believe what we're saying that we're in a war, then let's act like it.
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  Then let's start, let's start bringing it. Let's, let's do it. But legally, of course, you know, through the legal systems and through.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  We need to have that attitude because they're all saying it's a war. In fact, let's start playing some clips.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  Let's play Dana Bash saying it's a war. The deep state's getting the revenge. Then we'll play Schumer.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  Then we'll play a black ops commander, CIA. You name it. Great patriot.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  So many secret operations taken out the worst guys saying it's a criminal element in the group trying to bring down a patriot.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  America's under attack and everybody better act accordingly on Fox business.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  Shafer's telling you, folks, the military's behind Trump. They know this is a desperate situation against the scum of the earth.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  Here's Dana Bash.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  This president has done in his first hundred plus days, even before he came into office, is pick fights with the intelligence community.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  You picked them.
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  And now the law enforcement community, particularly the way, never mind that he fired James Comey, but the way in which he did it,
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  not giving him the respect of actually telling him in person or at least not having him find out from cable news.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  And so we know that this is, you know, they talk about the deep state.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  Well, these are communities that have a lot of loyalty within and know how to get back, even if you're the president of the United States.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's skip this one break today because the republic has in so much trouble.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  It is also in such a positive position. We're like on a knife's edge either way.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  I mean, Dana Bash now trumps anti police.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  This is the this is the party that's given $500 million just from Soros alone to black lives matter and other liberal groups like the red brigades and people that are literally saying kill cops and random white people.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  It's kind of blacks doing it mainly.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  It's a bunch of white socialists and communists.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  They're the ones running around saying kill everybody. They're the ones that want the UN to run local police.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  And then they say Trump's the enemy of police. Everything that comes out of their fat mouths is a bonafide certified lie.
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  Now let's go to Chucky Schumer.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  Here's Schumer a couple months ago threatening the president two days before he gets inaugurated.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  We better watch his mouth just like Brennan said, the Wahhabist.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  And then we're going to get to Schaefer. We're going to get to the clips we haven't played with Cassinage. Good liberals.
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  I don't agree with some of their policies, but I respect them because they're always the same telling the truth.
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  Deep State is trying to destroy our president who we elected. Here it is.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  You take on the intelligence community. They have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do it.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  What do you think the intelligence community would do?
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  These snakes don't get why Trump doesn't bow to them, why he doesn't care.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  He's doing the right thing. Let the chips fall where they may. That's why I said these tweets.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  I'm going to go all the way. I'm going to double down. I'm going to be strong. I need you to be strong.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  I'm going to do the right thing. I'm not going to stop.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  That's called commitment and these cowards that all get around the little coward groups, Doug.
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  They don't know what it's like to commit to something. They think they go with whatever the easiest road is.
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  That creates North Korea or Venezuela. Stuff that Trump's doing created America. Get used to it.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  Donald Trump is an American and all of us, no matter what color we are, if we understand doing the right thing and not being cowards, then we are unstoppable.
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  Go ahead.
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  You're exactly right. And again, it all comes down to identifying who our enemies are.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  And I think we've done that. I think the media, of course, is the mouthpiece for the enemy.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  Oh, and they call Trump evil for calling them the enemy. They're saying killing. They're saying he's the enemy.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  He goes, that's the enemy. And they go, oh my God, I can't believe you said that. Sorry.
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  Right. No, you're exactly right. And I think Donald Trump would be well advised as Robert David Steel had indicated to circumvent the media and speak directly to the.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  He needs to do at least twice a week of a fireside chat.
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And of course, you know, all of these deep state or all of these selective leaks are coming from elements of the deep state within the circle within the White House, the Oval Office, or I shouldn't say the Oval Office, but the White House, the West Wing and Congress.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  And again, the information I'm getting is the the tingle in Chris Matthews leg back from Obama has never been greater now that the deep state is utilizing the media to foment the passions of the.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  Oh, yeah, I've seen. I've seen Matthews and Obama going. How's it going now that I've been gone while they're waging war against America, trying to kill our stock market, trying to keep the VA in place hurting the veterans, trying to keep their overthrow local government
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  attack on cops going, trying to keep funding ISIS and Al Qaeda that Trump's destroying. And they sit there as our enemies as the literal bane of art existence.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  And then they look at our champion and say it's his fault.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  Exactly. You know, and Alex, we don't as conservatives as Christian conservatives as pure moral, spiritual and ethical people as conservatives, we don't fight like they fight.
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  And I guess we are going to have to start, you know, Donald Trump fights according to the official rules of fighting, of course, the the the minions of the deep state fight, you know, with street rules.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  And we have to change our tactics or we are we do have the possibility of losing if we don't.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  Well, that's what he's basically saying to the audience and I get it. Do we use the ring of Mordor to defeat Mordor? I don't know what we do.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  I just I just I just can't when you're out on the street and they walk up and say you're a Russian agent to your face.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  And then when you try to tell them stand up, you know, say it again, they run off like cowards. It's like they're the one serving the foreign powers.
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  They're the one screwing us over. I'm so sick of it.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  Yeah, exactly. And in my view, anyway, just talking with the with the police I've talked to and with the investigators and the federal prosecutor, because that conversation was pretty long.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  What do you do at this point? What do we do collectively and individually? What's best to do? Well, number one, you have to identify the enemy we have.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  Number two, you have to fight at their level and then certainly go after the the weakest link here.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  And I believe the weakest link will be the establishment Republicans and never Trumpers to go after and and to to they're the traders.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  We point out because because we have the constituents, we have the people, our people know where they're at.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  We understand we just expose the never Trumpers as the fifth column aiding the Democrats in ruining America's recovery.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  We point out the stock market plunging and say it's your fault. You're a jerk.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  I've got other guests coming up and I want to open the phones up, but Doug, I want to keep you a little bit.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  If you have to go, it's fine.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  Hagenreport.com. I want to keep you a little bit in the next hour to finish up. And then we've got Paul Joseph Watson and more coming up today. And I've got some other clips I want to play with Colonel Schaefer and also with Cassinage.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  Can you do a little bit into the next hour with us? Yeah, sure.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  Okay, great. Let me just briefly stop here for a moment because I can sit here and put on an act and I'm not angry, but I am angry.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  I mean, I'm pissed. These are evil people who really have it out to bankrupt us, make us poor. They attack Christians. They attack families.
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  You just see what the globalists are up to. I wouldn't be risking my life fighting some boss hog corruption.
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  I mean, I'd be speaking out against it, but I wouldn't be hair on fire. Wild-eyed.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  If I didn't know the people we're up against run the gamut from devil worshipers, pedophiles, psychopaths.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  I mean, they're just the worst people on earth. Okay.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  And I'm done. Everything they say is a lie. Everything they say is a fraud.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  And we're so honest, we're up here admitting we're thinking about dirty tricks.
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  I mean, you know, that's how honest we are. And I'm not going to do it.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  There's a lot of people are desperate at this point.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  And it's just, I hope all the chicken necks and cowards out there that want some physical war.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  I hope you know how stupid you are trying to start a fight with everybody that knows how to actually fight.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  I mean, you're idiots. You are morons. I mean, I could take on a hundred trendies.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  And I'm not even warrior class compared to the warrior class.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  I mean, you guys are so far removed from men. I don't even know what you call yourselves.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  Now let's just stop right there. I need funding to prosecute a war.
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  I was your help and the crew. We have devastated the globalists.

[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:50.000]  It's fun, it's there, thank you for making this possible. You are the M4Ware, hour three straight up.
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:37.000]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[1:59:37.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[1:59:45.000 --> 2:00:07.000]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself and M4WarsLive.com today.
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:19.000]  You are the Resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  Is this some conspiracy crucified for no sins?
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  I'm not comparing him to Christ. It's just a good allegory and say I find no wrongdoing. Why are you going to do this? I mean Trump is really a real guy. That's why they hate him and that's why they're trying to bring him down because they see him as an image of Americana returning.
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  Big breaking news I'll cover in the next segment. Farage warns EU Britain could walk away from negotiations if bullying continues.
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  An US aircraft conduct airstrike on Syrian army convoy was approaching US forces. They were 18 miles away. Wow that doesn't sound very reasonable.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  But okay Doug Hagman continue here with other big bomb shows you've got. If folks just joined it sounds like Comey's in a lot of trouble. We've got thousands of retweets on our video and article.
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  Headline at m4wars.com by Kit Daniels. Comey caught perjuring himself to Congress saying that Trump or no one else ever tried to influence him two months after he now admits he wrote a memo claiming Trump did. Wow this is big.
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  Exactly. And I think people would be well advised to understand Comey was the one who refused to prosecute Hillary Clinton for the emails.
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  Open and shut. Open and shut. Exactly. I mean you talk about a lay down investigation. There it is. And that should have been prosecuted. But of course you've got the Lynch and Bill Clinton factor the tarmac meeting and such.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  You've got so much exposure by Hillary's campaign people. Podesta for example Podesta group lobby Russia's largest bank income of nine hundred thousand dollars for crying out loud.
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  You've got all this Russian connections with the Clinton Foundation. Podesta's and everyone else. Lanny Davis for example yet. Comey has been silent or was silent on that.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  And of course now the special counsel which is interesting because many people and this is something I should people should consider many people identify the special counsel as a special prosecutor kind of the synonymous named synonymous not quite.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  However people relate to the special counsel slash prosecutor as coming of age with Nixon with our archival car. It isn't more like Ken Starr.
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  It's actually Ulysses Grant the first special prosecutor. It goes back that far. But the problem with the prosecutors slash special councils. And again this is from my source the federal prosecutors the fact that there's always investigation drift.
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  And we can start start out with one subject that moves into perjury or absconding or this. What about the other two congressional investigations going on. Those are still ongoing. What happens now.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  Well they should continue autonomously away from whatever Mueller might be getting into and they have to continue unimpeded. One of the areas of concern. You and Roger Stone talked about this.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  I think he did a great job covering this of course is the murder of Seth Rich. The person. Oh yeah let's talk about that. We've got federal investigators others saying they've seen the emails.
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  Right forty forty four thousand fifty three emails seventeen thousand seven hundred sixty one email attachments spanning from June of January twenty fifteen through May of twenty sixteen that were that made it from the DNC to the WikiLeaks.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  Assange via McFadden and also according to my sources there was one other intermediary there. The fact of the matter is this particular issue. This is at the epicenter. This Russian narrative was devised by this this fake false report of Russian hacking.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  There was no hacking. It was really a transfer of data from a in my professional opinion from what I've seen the DNC staffer Seth Rich. He took that information from the DNC had given it via intermediate via his connections to contacts to
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:39.000]  Assange twelve days later the Podesta emails broke that was I believe it was or I'm sorry a month or it might have been longer than that but nonetheless we saw the first batch of Podesta emails break.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  The murder is yet unsolved when in fact they have the FBI has and the DC police have a forensic evidence to tie WikiLeaks and Seth Rich.
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  I want to get an update on the whole pedophile roundup is happening and then we'll let you go my friend and get our next guest on again right now we are joined by Doug Hagan of Hagan report dot com.
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  Earlier this week President Trump met with the president of Turkey when protesters took the streets outside the Turkish embassy in DC to protest President Erdogan's policy towards free speech and dissonance.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  The Turkish president's security detail began brutally attacking them beating them to the ground ambush style attacks kicking them while they were down in the body and the head aggressively running to the scene just to get a licking on the American.
[2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  Nine people were injured and required a visit to the hospital and two people have been arrested for aggravated assault on a police officer.
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  The DC police say they intend on pursuing more charges. This is professional Turkish security in America oppressing free speech just as their leader has in Turkey. This is a Turkish president who supports even threatens nations with open borders.
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:58.000]  If supposed high standing individuals and professionals representing Turkey behave like this. Imagine what kind of dregs may be infiltrating this country and other countries with open borders and how they might treat American men women and children on the streets. Just check out how they behave in Europe and you'll understand.
[2:05:58.000 --> 2:06:11.000]  For info wars dot com this is Owen Troyer.

[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  Hey, everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side. And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the shocking statistics. Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country.
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.

[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  This is an AP U.S. aircraft conduct airstrike on Syrian army convoy. Zach was breaking down a meter in the break where this happened. It's a Shiite training base.
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  But then meanwhile Assad is Sunni, but it was a man in Sunni invasion force that was coming into the whole country.
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  And let's say much of Assad's support is Sunni. So it's all this inner Muslim inner Arab killing going on. It was a 35 mile protection zone around this. They came into it for the third day in a row.
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  And really nobody knows what's going on with this right now. But Zach had some interesting theories off what's being said. So does that kind of repeat what you just said?
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  Yes. So it's all breaking news. So it's kind of all in flux right now. But as far as what I've seen and what I've read back in August, I ran sent 3000 troops to Altamph, which is the area that got hit.
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  And those 3000 troops are there to be trained to be pro Assad militants. But there's Shia. So my thoughts were maybe that there might be some pro Assad Sunni rebels or pro Assad militants that kind of went to this very remote area.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:45.000]  It's on the border. It's essentially on the border of Iraq, Syria and Jordan because there's constant backstabbing between the five or six different factions, Kurds, you know, three factions of Sunni, the multiple factions of Shiites.
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  I mean, that's why the Muslims can't ever build a civilization is statistically historically through the anthropology sociology. They're constantly backstabbing double dealing doing this.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  And so that's a good point you make that this is Shiites brought in that are now being targeted. So so who knows because as ISIS and al Qaeda Saudi Arabian backed are and Qatari backed are being pushed out.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  That will create the vacuum that even McMaster to his credit has said will create a whole new civil war as a battle for control.
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  Yes. And as far as I see, it seems that it might just be the fact that Iran, Syria, Iran, the United States and Russia work together to build this army base to fuel.
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:35.000]  So once they see outside forces in the state, the Confliction Zone, I think it might have been just due diligence on parts of US and Russia.
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  They might even be working on this together to make sure that they secure those militants and things like that because who knows what those militants really were.
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  Well, it is certainly a giant, disgusting mess. Separately this attack in New York with one person dead 20 hit a hit and run with car slams and pedestrians and Times Square.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  More and more, it looks like somebody maybe passed out or some type of shock from diabetes or something just in the wrong lane, running people over.
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  That's what the media is saying. But if it wasn't Islamic attack, they wouldn't tell us. So thank you so much for the breakdown, Zach.
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  Let's go to Doug Hagman. Doug, what do you think about the attack in Times Square too early to tell?
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  Yeah, I just got some information. Allegedly, the driver of that vehicle has a history of DUI. That's not confirmed. That's just raw information. I don't know.
[2:11:23.000 --> 2:11:33.000]  Frankly, I think there was four police officers who took that driver out of the car. Information is too new for me to really comment on it.
[2:11:33.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  But certainly, what would stop Muslim terrorists from doing exactly that?
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  It's sad when we can't trust anyone or the media to tell the truth or even the police to tell the truth at this point.
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  Sure, because they get ordered in Europe. We see attacks with trucks every week in Europe and they keep telling them to get bigger trucks in ISIS videos.
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  And then the media says that Islam isn't involved in anything. In closing, other tidbits of info you haven't hit, other points folks should know about, Doug.
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  Well, one thing, being a PI, I investigated myself 30-plus years. Other PIs, there's a community of investigators that we know each other.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  Rod Wheeler, great private investigator.
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  Oh, yeah, let's spend some time on the Seth Rich situation. I mean, we're hearing a lot of conflicting stories. What's the intel you've got?
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  Well, the intel that I've got, Rod Wheeler did speak with a federal source. He said, look, I had eyes on the computer. I can verify, as a matter of fact, that this was connected to WikiLeaks.
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  It was connected to WikiLeaks. The motive with respect to the murder of Seth Rich certainly was not robbery. It doesn't conform to any robbery that he's worked in, however.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  So that's just go back to motive. What was the motive? But what we find interesting in the investigative business myself, when I work on solve homicides, who is complaining the most?
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  And I find it very interesting, with outside input, who's complaining the most? Brad Bowman. The new family spokesman for the Seth Rich family is saying, wait a minute, this is all conspiracy nonsense, and don't believe him.
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  We're satisfied with the police. Well, who's Brad Bowman? Brad Bowman is a professional Democratic crisis PR consultant.
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  Exactly. So the family was concerned for the first six months and wanted a PI. Now this guy's involved a known, quote, crisis manager for the Democratic Party.
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  Right. So again, they, the enemies of the truth are sending in, at least in my view, sending in people who are trying to plug holes in the dam where tidbits of the truth come out.
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  This is one example. I personally, I know the reputation of Rod Wheeler. I do believe that he's a good guy. I believe that he's telling the truth.
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  And I believe that we need to solve the, or the Seth Rich homicide needs to be solved conclusively, because this will be a cog in the wheel that doesn't really do a lot of damage to the DNC, to the Wasserman Schultz.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  By the way, they have the civil case Schultz and against Schultz, I'm sorry, Sanders against Schultz and the DNC.
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:32.000]  This is going to, this will be, once this is solved, 130 plus thousand reward, once this is solved, this will open up an entirely new avenue of investigation that will just put a lot of people on notice that we're coming for you.
[2:14:32.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  That's right, Doug Hagman. Thank you so much. Always amazing analysis. Hagmanreport.com. Thank you, sir.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  Thank you.
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  Wow. I want to open the phones up in the last 30, 40 minutes of this hour, and Paul Watson's going to come in from London, England, and just absolutely dominate as he does a great job with the rest of the crew.
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:15:01.000]  But I want to play a Paul Watson report about the impeachment of Donald Trump in the next segment that needs to go viral.
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  Separately, I want to thank the folks on Twitter, but this is how you get to hold the president for retweeting the tweet I put out an hour and a half ago with the headline, bombshell.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  And again, if we put the tweet up, that's on real Alex Jones, I can read the tweet.
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  Bombshell, Comey caught perjuring himself to Congress, Contra Dick's own memo, no one trying to block Russia investigation.
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  Now that's all I can say in a Twitter comment, but I probably should just write it out and then take a screenshot of it.
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  So I can put a larger two or three paragraphs as an image up there for people. That's kind of a trick for getting around it.
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:57.000]  So just say this, bombshell, Comey caught lying to Congress, or bombshell, Comey lied, there it is, or breaking, Comey caught lying, told Congress Trump didn't try to influence investigation.
[2:15:57.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  And then you can put a video, I know from the start of the show I shot, I think that video is done a couple hours ago. We could add that in there where I lay out those facts for people.
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  I mean, this is a big deal. We have Comey.
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  If you just joined us, maybe I should play that clip one more time. Let's queue up Comey from May 3rd telling the House committee that the judiciary committee that, no, no one tried to influence him.
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:31.000]  None of that was going on. Then that's just ridiculous. I mean, that would really get him upset. I mean, nobody tries to do that to the FBI.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  And this is while he lets this memo go out and be put out everywhere to the forewinds that he's meeting him in February and he's trying to influence the investigation.
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:46.000]  But then months later he says that's never happened. He's never seen that. He's never heard that.
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  This is a big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big deal.
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  And we're putting that first video I did earlier today on Facebook and on Twitter.
[2:16:58.000 --> 2:17:05.000]  We're going to tweet it out at Real Alex shows. We're going to post it on Facebook. It needs to go completely viral and throw that in the Democrats face.
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:13.000]  Here's Comey saying it didn't go on months after he spent with Trump and he said it did. Your God is a liar.
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  The attorney general or senior officials at the Department of Justice opposes a specific investigation. Can they halt that FBI investigation?
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:25.000]  In theory, yes.
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  Has it happened?
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  Not in my experience because it would be a big deal to tell the FBI to stop doing something that without appropriate purpose.
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  I mean, we're oftentimes they give us opinions that we don't see a case there and so you ought to stop investing resources in it.
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  But I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop something for a political reason. That would be a very big deal.
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:49.000]  It's not happened in my experience.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:54.000]  So we have this and it needs to get 50 million views.
[2:17:54.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  The video is on info wars.com and present planet.com in the article. Kit Daniels wrote dealing with this fact right now that we've tweeted out at real Alex Jones.
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  Everyone needs to share the link. Everyone needs to email it. Everybody needs to call their local talk show host. Everybody needs to call C-SPAN and say, did you hear about May 3rd when Comey told the world that Trump or nobody else tried to influence them or tried to obstruct justice when months before he met with him and wrote a memo saying that we can't believe a word comes out of James Comey's mouth.
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  He needs to be investigated. Who are these people?
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  The FBI. Oh, you're an FBI guy that worked for the Clintons and covered up. Oh, you're God. We can trust you, but we can't trust who we elected, Donald Trump. We can trust Chuck Schumer.
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  We can trust Hillary Clinton. We can trust Michael Moore. We can trust every globalist dart bag.
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:53.000]  But the guy that got 3 trillion in the stock market because the people believed in it and hundreds of billions of new jobs and got a good Supreme Court justice, they just can't stand it.
[2:18:53.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  They can't stand it. They were this close to gutting the country with Hillary and shutting down free speech. FCC demonstrations today, ban info or signs, you name it.
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  They're coming for us. I'm the big target. Trump's the target. Info wars is the target. Drudge is the target. Breitbart's the target.
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  A lot of people in conservative or libertarian media go good. I'll get bigger once you're gone. They'll shut you down even quicker, idiot.
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  That's why I love BuzzFeed articles trying to create divide and comfort going, Jones is obsessed with Limbaugh and hopes to get shut down.
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  I'm not in competition with Rush Limbaugh in your break. That just shows how they try to manipulate us and try every angle they can.
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  Separately, Roger Ailes died today. It was announced by his wife and I screenshotted the comments from his wife and sent it out.
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  And I'm not going to even talk about what was going on as of late with Roger Ailes behind the scenes, but I don't know, maybe down the road, I'll tell you.
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:20:00.000]  But truth is, stranger than fiction. We'll be back with Paul Joseph Watson's report destroying the attack on Trump, and that's even before the new Comey video came out.

[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  What if I say I'm not like the others? What if I say I'm not just like the others?
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  I'm going to take some of your phone calls in the next segment. I've got a bunch of clips I want to play where even mainstream news admits the deep state that's rogue criminal organizations are lying about the president working with the foreign-owned media.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  And you look at these people, they are such traders. But first, let's go to this Paul Joseph Watson report that he filed last night before we even knew that Comey had perjured himself to Congress saying no one in Trump's administration or anybody connected to Trump ever tried to influence his administration two months after he'd already secretly been writing memos up about the president.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  So Comey has been caught red-handed. The video, the articles are all on Twitter. Here it is. Here's Paul Watson.
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  This summer, the situation could explode. The drive to impeach Donald Trump will lead to either war abroad or war on the streets of America.
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  Sources close to the White House indicate to us that sleeper cells within the administration, turncoats, will be the leading voices in the push to impeach Donald Trump.
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  The same traders responsible for the leaks in alliance with never Trump Republicans are feverishly working with the Democratic Party establishment to sabotage Trump.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  And thanks to the media, bought and paid for by the deep state, the propaganda is working.
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  When clearly we're on the trail there to an impeachment.
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  Are we getting closer and closer to the possibility of yet another impeachment process?
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to call for the impeachment of the president of the United States of America.
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  Are well on our way to impeachment.
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  Odds of Trump being impeached by the end of 2017 have shot up past 30%. 48% of Americans want to see it happen.
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  And that's because the media has engaged in blitzkrieg-like onslaughts of deception.
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:27.000]  We're told this Comey memo is, quote, deeply troubling. So troubling that Comey sat on it for three months.
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  So troubling that he kept it quiet for all that time and only released it days after he was fired. What a coincidence.
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  So Trump tells Comey that he hopes he'll be fair to Flynn because he thinks he's a good man.
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  And the media calls this obstruction of justice.
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:49.000]  Even CNN admits that this is part of the deep state's revenge against Trump.
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  We know that this is, you know, they talk about the deep state.
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  Well, these are communities that have a lot of loyalty within and know how to get back, even if you're the president of the United States.
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  The same revenge that Chuck Schumer promised with an evil glint in his eye before Trump even took office.
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community. They have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  The leak to The Washington Post. Trump tells Russia how to protect innocent people from being blown up on a plane by ISIS.
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  And he's the monster for trying to save lives.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  Not a single shred of evidence has ever been presented to prove Trump colluded with Russia to influence the election.
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  But that doesn't matter to these people.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  The end justifies the means, and the end game is the elimination of Trump at whatever cost to the country.
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  Isn't it rich how they still grandstand, like they've got the moral high ground?
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  Keith Algerman begging foreign countries to launch a coup d'etat.
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  You're literally trying to incite the overthrow of a democratically elected president.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  You don't have the moral high ground.
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  These people are perfectly willing to see the country fail if it means they can claim they were proven right about Trump.
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  They're quite happy to see the plane go down even though they're on it, just to soothe their butthurt about losing the election.
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:28.000]  Difference is, they've got parachutes. The middle and working class Americans who voted for Trump don't, and they're the ones who are going to suffer.
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  There are two courses of action for Trump.
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  Either he initiates a massive purge of fifth columnists within his administration, as well as completely replacing his communications team, which steadfastly refuses, or is too incompetent a week to fight back on any of these issues.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  The deep state has declared war on Trump. It's time to fight back.
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  The other option is war. You saw what happened after the airstrike on Syria.
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  The deep state left him alone for a few weeks, and his approval rating recovered.
[2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:09.000]  Trump could launch a massive war and rally the country around that last refuge of scoundrels, patriotism.
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:16.000]  But that's exactly what the deep state wants, and once it's over, they'll just keep undermining Trump anyway.
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  Where's this all heading?
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  Paul Watson is amazing, isn't he? The full video is on infowars.com. It's called The Impeachment of Donald Trump, and it's ongoing.
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  It's already begun by the enemies, and it's so important.
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  Also, I have tweeted out the first part of the show where we expose Comey and the absolute obstruction of justice. That is so key to get out right now.
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  If you want to save the Republic and defeat these people, we have them.
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:47.000]  If you spread the link on Facebook, Twitter, Google, Talk Radio, Call C-Span, you name it.
[2:29:47.000 --> 2:30:00.000]  The full video and the full tweets on infowars.com and on real Alex Jones on Twitter.
[2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:20.000]  To raise money to fight President Trump.
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  Now the Democrats are smashing records in online donations.
[2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:26.000]  The Democrats should be thanking Trump for making them so much money.
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  To put the rush of cash into perspective, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised $19.7 million in 2015, but have raised $20 million so far this year, with contributions averaging $18, chomping the chomps.
[2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:45.000]  Compare that to the $1.7 million raised by the National Republican Congressional Committee, and well, it doesn't compare, does it?
[2:30:45.000 --> 2:30:53.000]  This is all in a desperate push to win back the 24 seats needed to control the House of Representatives, to put Nancy Pelosi back as majority House leader.
[2:30:54.000 --> 2:30:58.000]  But just like the 2016 presidential election, Democrats will waste their money and come out on bottom.
[2:30:59.000 --> 2:31:01.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[2:31:04.000 --> 2:31:06.000]  Let's go to Debitant, Florida. Debitant, Florida, you're on the air.

[2:33:01.000 --> 2:33:29.000]  This is our land. These are our people. The workers. The strivers. The builders. These are our people. They're the globalists.
[2:33:29.000 --> 2:33:39.000]  Who are they? They are the Dark Armies. The Dark Murdering Armies was only on them.
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:34:06.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jimmy Show. Here's Colonel Schaefer yesterday exposing the enemies within our government, the deep state trying to bring down Trump, and the Trumpies are recognized he's in a war. Here it is.
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  The President, for better or for worse, is the ultimate classification or declassification authority. He can talk to anybody about anything no matter what the level is.
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:24.000]  And beyond that, I understand that things were instantly twisted by the National Security Council staff and leaked obviously to the Post.
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  And there was a very delayed, very muted response where they should have been right up there outlining the facts right up front about how this is completely false.
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  So I think they, like you point out, the White House communications staff has to believe they are now at a state of war. This is war.
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:52.000]  It's called information operations, information warfare, and clearly the other side, the deep state and the Clinton folks, and I have to say some folks on the Republican side are all lining up.
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  The battle lines are drawn. It's time for people to understand how to deal with this like it's a war.
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:15.000]  The deep state is committed to maintaining this assault, it seems. I mean, we're not even four months into the Trump presidency, and the assaults continue, the attacks continue, and we have, as you indicated, the outset.
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  The New York Times and the Washington Post, these are no longer fake news. I mean, they are, it's an entire psiops.
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  It is a disinformation campaign from previous, you know, former journalists.
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  What do you think having some experience with all of the above would be an appropriate response by this White House?
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:42.000]  Well, two things. First, you're completely correct on the papers. I mean, this is, they become probda.
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  It's just to use a Cold War metaphor, and it's shameful.
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  Secondly, regarding the very fact, and look, I've met with senior intelligence officials now in place, and Lou, they have to go through and sort out who is going to be actual career people who are going to do their job and those who are loyal to the previous administration.
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  And some of these folks have transitioned from what we call political appointee jobs into career jobs.
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  So you got to go through, so my recommendation, I'll tell you what I said, you need to go fire two levels down. Everybody below you two levels, fire them. Be done with it.
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:24.000]  Thank you for your service to America. It's time for you to find a new job and then start looking for people who are going to be loyal to the American people and to the policies of this president.
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:26.000]  That's what you got to do. It's just that simple.
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  Wow, that's powerful. We're going to get him on soon.
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:42.000]  Here's my problem. I sent Nico eight or nine articles this morning when I got up at like five a.m. and he printed them all off for me.
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  And every one of these, I could spend an hour on the lies.
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  Just look at all this other stuff. I haven't even gotten to it. It's like we all saw Putin. We played it unedited saying it's crazy.
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  They say they gave Lavrov all the secret info, the media, the U.S. make stuff up.
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  Lavrov, you're in trouble. You didn't give us the secret info. And then Lavrov goes on to say, yeah, we used to have Provda in the news and there wasn't any, you know, truth in Provda and there wasn't anything, you know, Provda in the news.
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  I'm quoting that from memory, but the point is the Russians are admitting they had a horrible brainwashing media, but our media won't even admit that's what they are.
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  And so I saw headlines on Newsweek and USA Today and CNN. You can search this. Putin laughs at Trump and America and makes fun of how they let him spy on them.
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  Putin laughed and said, we're allowed to meet with the president. Nothing went on. Nothing secret happened. This is pure crap.
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  And then they make jokes about it. But the headlines are, oh, yeah, there it is. Putin laughs at political chaos in the U.S.
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:38:03.000]  Well, that's more of a fair thing from the BBC. The actual headlines that I found was, Vladimir Putin openly mocks Donald Trump for sharing secret intel with Lavrov.
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  No, they say we didn't do it. It's not true. You're like Provda. And then that gets translated to Newsweek and everywhere else.
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  I saw it today. I mean, I, I mean, I watch when I'm on the treadmill, YouTube boil down because they're all like 30 seconds long.
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  And if I look for like 45 minutes, I mean, I'll see, you know, 50 clips. And it was just all these clips from Newsweek and Fox and CNN and just all the little things they put out on the web all at 30 seconds to a minute.
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  And it was like, yeah, I saw it three times this morning, just in a newsfeed. Putin's laughing at Trump and America. How he got the intel from Trump, that dumbass Trump.
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  He is the biggest idiot I ever saw. Time to get rid of him. We've had enough. I mean, and then meanwhile, we play the clip of what Putin really said, you know, read the closed captioning.
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  He said, this is ridiculous. Nothing secret was discussed. It's been all over the news about laptops and bombs. Trump's trying to get us to go take out ISIS. Wouldn't you even want that?
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  Lavrov, you didn't give us a secret info. You bad man.
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  But that turns into Putin making fun of us because they know you're not going to go actually watch the clip.
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:23.000]  It's just, that's what the official Russian government media said. It's very dangerous to use the United States media for anything but birdcage lining.
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  So I've got a couple of these clips. There's a bunch of them, but here's some of the exchanges. I'll try as best I can to read the closed captioning. Here it is.
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  I'd be forced to issue Lavrov a reprimand because he did not share the secrets with us. Neither with me nor the representatives of the Russian intelligence services.
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  It was very bad of him.
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  Moreover, the United States administration finds it possible we are ready to provide a record of the Trump-Lavrov talks to the U.S. Congress and Senate, of course, if the U.S. administration wants it.
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  At the same time, we see the politics of schizophrenia in the developing United States.
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  And I cannot find any other explanation for accusations that Donald Trump has had some revealed some secret to Lavrov.
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:38.000]  At first, as we looked at how the internal political process the U.S. is developing, we found it funny, but today it's not just sad, it worries us.
[2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  All of this has been done on the basis of incitement of anti-Russian sentiment.
[2:40:46.000 --> 2:40:52.000]  What surprises me is that they're shaking up the domestic political situation in the United States using anti-Russian slogans.
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  Either they don't understand the damage they've done to their country, in which case they're simply stupid, or they understand everything, in which they are dangerous and corrupt people.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  Ding-ding, that's it.
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  And there's another clip where Lavrov makes the joke about you can't believe anything in the U.S. that is as bad as the old Soviet media.
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:16.000]  But here's the big truth of it.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  Was Trump a Russian agent? No, there's no evidence.
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  It's all made up.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  Was Hillary on the payroll? Yes.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  That's what foreign governments do, they try to buy influence.
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  But was Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, making fun of Trump in the U.S.? No.
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  He was saying, it's ridiculous they made this up.
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  We usually think it was funny, then it was sad, now it's dangerous.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  We're not laughing.
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  He said, this isn't funny, this is dangerous.
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  There's the full clip, they go on, it's powerful.
[2:41:51.000 --> 2:41:54.000]  So they call us Russian agents because we actually show you what the Russians say.
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  The Russians aren't in our business, the EU is, the Pope is, the Chai comms are.
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  Israel is, I'm not an enemy of Israel, but Israel's got a lot of control over the U.S. and it's got some anti-gun groups here.
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  And I'm like, we're paying for M16s for settlers, then I can't have guns.
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:14.000]  I'm critical of any of these foreign powers.
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  The point is, is that Russia is barely involved.
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  They got some bots, they got people trying to influence stuff, of course they are.
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  All governments do that.
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  But Russia is a superpower of industry that's rusting, but it's really a superpower of raw resources.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:34.000]  That's why the United States working with Russia would be better for humanity.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  They're not communists anymore.
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  But regardless, it's a red herring of 21st century globalism that has hijacked our country.
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:49.000]  It's trying to sell us that the foreign enemies what's running things, but not the actual globalists that are in our faces every day.
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  Under UN treaties, they decide how big new apartments are, how many kids you're supposed to have, where you can go to school, what the power lines look like.
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:00.000]  It's global standardization.
[2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  Our police policies, the curriculum in our public schools, our colleges, we are a kept run nation, just like the U.K. under the EU.
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:11.000]  But the U.K. is starting to pull out.
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  And Trump began to pull us out of the unelected secretive TPP, Transpacific Partnership and all the rest of the garbage.
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  And so the special interest that it hijacked things, they howl, they scream, shut down Trump, shut down the new press, kick the new Republicans out.
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  No, no, no.
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:36.000]  Peter Schiff, he will stay in power.
[2:43:36.000 --> 2:43:47.000]  All the rest of the little globalists like the John McCain's and the Republicans that have come to the House floor, Senate floor, and it's time to look at impeachment.
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  Why, there's this memo from Comey where he tried to influence the investigation, but no discussion of Comey.
[2:43:55.000 --> 2:44:05.000]  Two months later, plus saying Trump never asked me to do anything, perjuring himself, impeaching himself, caught red-handed.
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  And that video is up on infowars.com.
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  It's on prisonplanet.com.
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:14.000]  It's on our Twitter, real Alex Jones.
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  It's on our Facebook.
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  Let's put Alexander Emmerich Jones, a great fan, by the way, like six, seven years ago, set up like 30 Facebook pages for me.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  I knew nothing about it then. I was an idiot. And he said, I set up all these big pages. I'd like to work for you.
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  And I said, sorry, I don't have the money to do that. Thank you for the sites.
[2:44:32.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  I want to, whoever that guy was, I couldn't find his number. I want to hire you.
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  And I want to apologize for the great work you did, because we wouldn't even be where we were if it wasn't for you.
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  Just a couple of our pages have a million and a half, two million people on them. They're very effective.
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  They're trying to kick us off, they're trying to curtail us, but it's been very useful.
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  But it is spelled with the wrong Emmerich. That's why I mentioned somebody else made it.
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:45:02.000]  The proper way to spell Emmerich is with our health care products or our personal care products, Emmerich Essentials, that Alexander Emmerich page.
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:10.000]  If you had to scroll down, it says, Comey caught committing perjury to Congress.
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  Full report. That needs a million likes.
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:19.000]  That needs to be sent to the four corners of the galaxy. The embedded video needs to be sent everywhere.
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  It just went up like 30 minutes ago. It's only got 32,000 viewers on it.
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:29.000]  Now that sounds like a lot. It's not. And he's 35 million and will change the course of the country and the world.
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:37.000]  It's Comey right there contradicting everything they're saying. It's powerful. Why do they want to shut down InfoWars?
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:46.000]  Because they know we'll remember common sense. Our listeners will send us a show tip saying, Hey, here's Comey.
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:53.000]  At minute, you know, 57 in the full testimony, the full testimony up there too saying this never happened.
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:56.000]  And here he is saying it did. This is a big deal.
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:46:05.000]  800-25-99231, 800-25-99231. This is a big, big, big, big, big, big deal.
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  That's for all my foibles and all my problems and Lord, I'm obnoxious sometimes and I know it. I love the truth.
[2:46:13.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  I'll tell the truth. I will come out with the truth. And that's why they hate InfoWars.com. That's why they hate DrudgeReport.com.
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  Because we're one of the few outlets out there that when it's being censored, it's being blocked, we will put it out and they say, Oh, you're fake news.
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:33.000]  They say that because we're so accurate. They say that because we'll show you a clip of Gruber saying, Thank God, you're so dumb.
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  And then saying you never said it, or Obama saying healthcare is free under Obamacare, then show you five years later saying it doubles your prices.
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:45.000]  We will bring back the memory whole info that was supposed to be put into a furnace and never seen again.
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  That's why they don't like us. And if you'll just start doing it, when you see them make a claim, start your own YouTube channel, your own Facebook, whatever, or your own system,
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:47:00.000]  and go show where they said one thing five years ago and another thing today, or one thing three months ago and another thing today.
[2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:05.000]  It's cold having a memory. These tyrants cannot exist if there's a free press.
[2:47:06.000 --> 2:47:13.000]  And with the internet today, everybody can have their own press. I want to be transcended. I want to be made obsolete. Believe me. Believe me.
[2:47:14.000 --> 2:47:19.000]  I'm either so obsessed with this, I do it 20 hours a day, or I want to just quit and never do it again.
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  This is a total war. It's not fun having them come after your kids and have the whole media lie about you during a jury trial for your kids,
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:35.000]  trying to take your kids away from you to make you some failure, or all the other crap that the big foundations and law firms pull behind the scenes against us.
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  Then the lies the media puts out about it that I'll be saying more about the next few days.
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  It's incredible. But just know this, I'm not bitching. Most people think if you avoid problems, you're a winner.
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:55.000]  No, when you can't avoid things and you finally deal with it, that's when you're a leader. I expect to be attacked.
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  I'm proud to do what I do. Just know this, an epic war for everything is happening now.
[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  Now, I haven't gotten to this clip yet. This is Dennis Kacenich talking about how the deep state's trying to take down Trump and how it's horrible.
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  Jonathan Turley's come out and said it's very, very dangerous as well. He's a big liberal. Those are the old liberals I liked.
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  They, they, they meant well. They were smart. They were informed. They didn't like stuff Bush was doing. Neither did I, but I didn't like the Democrats either.
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  Now it's just like, whoa.
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  Because it's a bandwagon, but here is Kacenich.
[2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  You have a politicization of the agencies that is resulting in leaks from anonymous, unknown people, and the intention is to take down a president.
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  Now this is, this is very dangerous to America. It's a threat to our republic.
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  It constitutes a clear and present danger to our, our way of life.
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  So we have to be asking, what is the motive of these people? Who's putting these leaks out?
[2:48:58.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  Why doesn't somebody come forward and make a charge and put their name and a reputation behind it instead of attacking through the media and not substantiating their position?
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  Sir, you agree with me. This is a real danger when you have the intelligence community in an election season under the guise of national security.
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  That are spying on an opposition party and transition team at a 600% increase rate from the years prior to the election season.
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  Well, we have to remember this. You know, our first allegiance is to our country. This isn't about one president.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  This is about the political process of the United States of America being under attack by intelligence agencies and individuals in those agencies.
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:56.000]  Yes, as you said, there might be some good people in there, but there are certain individuals who are the lifers who want to be able to direct the policy of the country.
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  That's right. They're on a power trip. If a president stands in their way, whether it's a Democrat or a Republican, they'll just try to run them up.
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  You're saying President Trump is under attack by the deep state intelligence community. Fair statement?
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  Well, I believe that. Not only that, Sean, but it has to be pointed out in October of 2016 that same deep state overrode the decision of President Obama and Secretary Kerry to come to an agreement with Russia in a ceasefire in Syria.
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  That's right. They overrode it and launched an attack against a Syrian military base. So this is a problem in our country. We've got to protect our nation here.
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  People have to be aware of what's going on. You've got to stand up for America now. This isn't about Democrat-Republic.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  Exactly. This is about getting what's going on in the moment and understanding that our country itself is under attack from within.
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  And folks, it doesn't matter whether you're a liberal conservative, who it is, if you're a smart and intellectual like dissent, he's saying everything I'm saying because we're looking at the same deal.
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  You understand? This is an internal takeover by globalists. This is the end of the country, folks.
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:14.000]  Think about this. Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds and antidepressants.
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  They know water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  sign up for auto, ship and additional, 25% off. That's 45% off retail at infowarstore.com. The mouthwash, the sunscreen, the bug spray, it's all natural, highest quality.
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  Very, very excited about this. Introductory offer out of the gate. It's very close to loss leader to get introduced to it.
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  We also have a lot of other specials running on nutraceuticals right now at infowarstore.com or CRIPLA 2533139.
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  Look at the important work we're doing. We want to expand in the face of the globalist, trying to shut us down.
[2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  Again, thank you all for your prayers and your support. Whatever you do, share the articles, share the videos, like the ones up on infowarstore.com.
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:55:04.000]  Come he caught perjuring himself according to his other testimony, claiming that Trump never or anyone else ever tried to influence this investigation.
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  Now he's using this memo against Trump and claiming he did. This is unbelievable.
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  And the MSM is going to try to hide this. It is so important that you get this out. It's at infowarstore.com that you retweet it at real Alex Jones.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  Okay, let's talk to Matt in Pennsylvania. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  Hello, Matt.
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  Good, brother.
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:40.000]  Hey, I have a little blog that I run. I always repost and I always share stuff and I just kind of want to call on everyone listening to just do more because we elected Trump.
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  We chose Trump. We didn't choose any of these other people who are just crazy for lack of better words and just completely ridiculous.
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  I mean, it's just, it's so-
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  Well, I think you just said it. This is an attack on the American people trying to bring our government back, not wanting NAFTA and GATT and TPP and the Arab Spring.
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  This is the deep state saying screw you, America.
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  All right, we just need to do more. Everyone needs to do more.
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  Oh, listen, we have millions of listeners. We're on over 200 commercial radio stations. If everybody listening just went and emailed the article at infowarstore.com or retweeted it or whatever, it would break through and it would absolutely sink Comey and all of them.
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:24.000]  But it's up to everybody. God bless you, Matt. Thank you so much. Anything else?
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:29.000]  Do you mind if I share my blog?
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  Please do.
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  It's TheDailyInformer.net.
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  I love that.
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:44.000]  And I just thank you. I just always shared, like, you've inspired me tenfold and I just always share everything relevant to this, but everyone can do it. It's not difficult.
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:51.000]  It's really simple. It just takes focus and consistency and just do more, do more, do more. I mean, we're all...
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  It's a war. These globalists want to run our lives, run our kids. It's fun to fight them.
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:57:00.000]  I think everybody should call C-SPAN too. That has a big effect when half the callers are saying infowars.com or whatever it is.
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  We want to keep shaking them up. Thank you, Matt. Great points.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  We've got Dean and we've got Jay and we've got Sam and Chris and others. Let's go to a caller in Wisconsin. Let's talk to Dean.
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  What should Trump's game plan be? What is the battle strategy?
[2:57:15.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, give me a minute. I know you talked real fast in that, but listen to me.
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  I said before and I'm glad that guy came on and said just fire everyone, bring everyone up. That's another step.
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:34.000]  You're doing what you're doing with the bottom line. I'm telling you, the curtain has to be lifted.
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:42.000]  I think he needs it. You're right. He needs to go online. He can go on once a week. He doesn't need to go on more than that because I want him at work busting the mouth of these people.
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:52.000]  Get on and say, hey, this is what I'm for. Nationalism, sovereignty. This is what the sabotage is.
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  And you've elected me. You've elected me. Go ahead.
[2:57:57.000 --> 2:58:03.000]  You guys want this. You want that. Get on there. That's the first. Can I swear online?
[2:58:04.000 --> 2:58:10.000]  I'll let you go. I appreciate your call, but I hear what you're saying. We're going to come back and talk to Sam and Chris and Jay and others.
[2:58:11.000 --> 2:58:16.000]  That's it. We elected Trump. He's allowed to share intelligence. He's the president. He didn't, though.
[2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:30.000]  It's all lies by scum like Dana Bash and scum like Chuck E. Schumer and scum, just scum like Rachel Maddow and trash like Hardball and all these nobodies.
[2:58:31.000 --> 2:58:37.000]  They're just all and these scummy Republican people. They are just, they hate trying to bring America back.
[2:58:38.000 --> 2:58:39.000]  They've all gotten rich selling the country off.
[2:58:39.000 --> 2:58:45.000]  Fourth hour, infowars.com, forward slash show. Spread that link. Tell folks about your local stations. I'll be back with Paul Watson.
[2:58:46.000 --> 2:58:50.000]  Warrior calls in 70 seconds, but retweet our article about Kwome.
[2:58:50.000 --> 2:59:11.000]  Kwome.
[2:59:21.000 --> 2:59:23.000]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[2:59:24.000 --> 2:59:30.000]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor. It works.
[2:59:31.000 --> 2:59:38.000]  Defender body armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[2:59:39.000 --> 2:59:48.000]  Defender body armor is now available through infowars.com so you can defend yourself, your family and finance the info war against the globalist all at the same time.
[2:59:48.000 --> 2:59:50.000]  A total 360 win.
[2:59:54.000 --> 2:59:56.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:59:56.000 --> 3:00:21.000]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  Paul Watson's coming up. We're taking your phone calls right now.
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:37.000]  Jay in New York wants to chime in and Paul's coming up in the next segment from London.
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  Jay wants to talk about Komi Perjury, Clintons and Soros. Wow.
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:47.000]  Do we have Komi on May 3rd months after the supposed memo saying nobody tried to influence the FBI or him?
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  He'd never heard anything about that from anybody.
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  An omnibus total 360 statement that he has now perjured himself if his memo is true.
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:01:00.000]  But we all know that's a fraud from Scott the Recordings. What do you think Jay?
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  His hands must be perfectly clean. I'm sure of that right Alex?
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  Yes.
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:14.000]  Alex I don't know what we would do without you. I don't know what we would do without you.
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  I do agree with the two previous callers with the gentleman who said do more, do more.
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:28.000]  We must as citizens do more. As a citizen and as a patriot personally I refuse to take this crap any further.
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  I don't personally feel we have any issues of any relevance with Russia. I think it's all crap.
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:40.000]  I don't care about Donald Trump's tax returns personally. I think the more he saves the more it reflects on as a businessman.
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:46.000]  I think he could pass that information on as far as tax laws and all that go. I think that's going to be a hat trick for him.
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:50.000]  But ties with Russia is BS. I don't think there's any such thing.
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  Incidentally have you heard Roger Ailes passed away at 77, architect of conservatives?
[3:01:56.000 --> 3:02:02.000]  He had a lot of health problems so I'm not saying it's foul play but I might talk about it the next few days.
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:06.000]  It was interesting that he died now but lost some inside baseball behind the scenes.
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  Look here's all I'm saying is, Comey has been caught saying that Trump never tried to influence things months after he supposedly wrote this down.
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  He's done. It's over. This is the biggest thing ever and only our audience seems to care.
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  But like you say the animating contest of liberty being involved, being informed Jay.
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  It's like people go play paintball because they want competition or touch football or baseball.
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:36.000]  This is a real war for our future. It's exciting. We're fighting a bunch of degenerate pedophiles.
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:40.000]  I mean it's exciting to fight them. It's not work. It's exciting.
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  God bless you Jay. Love you to death. Appreciate you calling.
[3:02:44.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Virginia. I want to talk about Kushner. Chris in Virginia. You're on the air.
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  I had to think. I was thinking back to right before the election when it seemed like in for wars you had exploded on the map.
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:08.000]  And then once he had got in, you know, you had been exploding, but it was like you was doing damage on both ends between what was going on in the White House and what you was doing.
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:13.000]  So it looked to me like the globalist had to figure out a way to stop a momentum on your side.
[3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  So I believe that they kind of did that disinformation about putting things out there about Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump to get you all to say something bad to try to tear up the support that it was getting.
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  And I had got me thinking to myself, now what incentive would Jared Kushner have to turn on Trump?
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  From the details that Trump has said himself, he looked at every aspect of things.
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  So I would think that the guy that's marrying his daughter, Donald Trump, would do the due diligence on.
[3:03:42.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  And I believe that he learned a valuable lesson after the debates about going nice with them through Ivanka and Jared and then getting slapped in the back.
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  So I believe he deployed them in a way that you could keep this ear into what the globalists are doing, your thoughts.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:00.000]  I think you ought to be hosting this show.
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  A lot more articulate and focused and crystallized than I am.
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  Absolutely great points, my friend. Other points.
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:14.000]  I was just saying, you know, it looks to me that there's a whole bunch of smoke and mirrors that's going on.
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  Because with the transparency that Trump is displaying right now, he's slowly pulling the wall back on everything.
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:32.000]  I think his only mistake is that he didn't, from his tweet this morning, it indicates to me that he's having regrets about not inviting Hillary with a special counsel.
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:34.000]  Soon as Jeff Stesson got sworn in.
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:37.000]  You know what? You are so on target. Chris, give us your name and number.
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:40.000]  I almost want to pick certain callers that are really on target.
[3:04:40.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  I almost want to have a show that's hosted by like six or seven callers once a week that are really, and then like, expand from there.
[3:04:48.000 --> 3:04:50.000]  Give us your name and number, Chris. I want to get you on the show more often.
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:52.000]  He absolutely crystallized the whole deal.
[3:04:53.000 --> 3:04:55.000]  Alright, I'm going to punch out of here, sorry the other callers.
[3:04:56.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  Paul Watson from her Britannic Majesties London, England will join us on the other side. Please spread the word.
[3:05:02.000 --> 3:05:04.000]  Earlier this week, President Trump met with the President of Turkey.
[3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:10.000]  When protesters took the streets outside the Turkish Embassy in DC to protest President Erdogan's policy towards free speech and dissonance,
[3:05:11.000 --> 3:05:16.000]  the Turkish President's security detail began brutally attacking them, beating them to the ground, ambush style attacks,
[3:05:17.000 --> 3:05:22.000]  kicking them while they were down, in the body and the head, aggressively running to the scene just to get a licking on the American.
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:29.000]  Nine people were injured and required a visit to the hospital, and two people have been arrested for aggravated assault on a police officer.
[3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:32.000]  The DC police say they intend on pursuing more charges.
[3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:37.000]  This is professional Turkish security in America, oppressing free speech just as their leader has in Turkey.
[3:05:38.000 --> 3:05:42.000]  This is a Turkish president who supports, even threatens nations with, open borders.
[3:05:43.000 --> 3:05:47.000]  If supposed high standing individuals and professionals representing Turkey behave like this,
[3:05:48.000 --> 3:05:52.000]  imagine what kind of dregs may be infiltrating this country and other countries with open borders,
[3:05:53.000 --> 3:05:56.000]  and how they might treat American men, women and children on the streets.
[3:05:57.000 --> 3:05:58.000]  Just check out how they behave in Europe, and you'll understand.
[3:05:58.000 --> 3:06:01.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Troyer.
[3:06:29.000 --> 3:06:31.000]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:34.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:39.000]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength,
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  for the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors,
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:47.000]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:50.000]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were,
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:06:54.000]  but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were,
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:07:00.000]  and this is a big part of it. I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself at Infowars.com today.
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:04.000]  Electrify your day with Secret 12. It's like lightning in a bottle.

[3:07:21.000 --> 3:07:27.000]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:35.000]  Secret 12 by Infowars Live is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:39.000]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.

[3:07:45.000 --> 3:07:52.000]  but it also assists with many other functions of the body. Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[3:07:52.000 --> 3:08:15.000]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfowarsLife.com. That's InfowarsLife.com.
[3:08:23.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  Alright, Paul Watson's taken over.
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:32.000]  Military Strikes on Syrian Forces on a Convoy by U.S. Forces.
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:38.000]  ISIL Faraz warns EU Britain could walk away from negotiations and bullying continues.
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:45.000]  There is just so much for Paul Watson to cover, but I gotta tell you, it is so big.
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:09:01.000]  The Comey said under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3rd that he had not had anybody from the Trump Administration or Trump
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  try to get him to drop their investigation and they put out this memo that no one's seen might be completely made up.
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:15.000]  So there's Comey told the truth and the memos fake or he perjured himself. And again, we're down three hours in dust breaking this.
[3:09:16.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  It's on Infowars.com. It's on PrisonPlanet.com. It's gone viral on Facebook and Twitter. Real Alex Jones.
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:30.000]  But it's not getting the attention it should, even from conservative sites because there's this worship of the FBI that goes on with us.
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:33.000]  We'll get Paul's take on this here in a moment.
[3:09:33.000 --> 3:09:41.000]  Briefly, we have developed, and InfowarsLife.com, a lot of new products.
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:49.000]  And one of them that goes well with the X-2 survival shield, the Good Halogen, is Z-Shield Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[3:09:50.000 --> 3:09:53.000]  It's so important to try to get the chemicals and toxins out of your body.
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:10:00.000]  And with Chilogy and with concentrated zeolites and with the other concentrated herbs, it's a great product.
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:09.000]  It's discounted out of the gates right now, 30% or 33%.
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  You can sign up for auto-ship and additional 10% off because I want you to see how great it is.
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  But whether it's Z-Shield or X-2 or Super Mill Vitality or DNA Force or Lung Cleanse, these are all amazing products.
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:29.000]  Our Selenium is the best product out there for Selenium. Just take Knockout.
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:34.000]  About three years ago, I was taking Valerian Root and Melatonin. I noticed each bottle was $19.
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:39.000]  And I went to a big manufacturer, a big organic producer. We don't just use a group, we use three companies total.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:46.000]  That's four now. And I said, it's $19.95. I want the same dose of Melatonin but organic based.
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  But I want to add L-Tryptophan and Valerian Root and Lemon Balm and Camomile and all the rest of it to it and sell it for $19.95.
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  It would cost you $50, $60 for all those things, but it costs $19.95.
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:04.000]  When it's discounted even better, our colloidal silver is the same one they sell at Whole Foods, except it's $19.95, not $24.95.
[3:11:05.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  It's just a private label. All of our stuff is the very best. Living Defense is amazing.
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:14.000]  Biome Defense, our probiotic caveman. Is caveman back in stock? I was told that was sold out. Is that back? Wow.
[3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  That is a popular product. And I guess it's back in stock. Wow. No, that's back.
[3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:30.000]  It's not for auto-ship with additional 10% off, but get 25% off our new personal care product line, Emmerich Essentials, the shampoo, the bug spray.
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  It's all natural. The sunscreen, the body wash, the 10-to-1 mouthwash, and more.
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:44.000]  mfolwarslife.com, mfolwarsstore.com, our AAA-253-3139. And yes, your purchases make it all possible. So thank you.
[3:11:45.000 --> 3:11:50.000]  Paul, you got 50 minutes left in transmission. I want to thank you. So without further ado, please take over.
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:56.000]  Okay, thanks, Alex. We are in the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show on this May 18th edition.
[3:11:57.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  And Alex played the video earlier, and we're going to play it again for the purposes of context, because one of the biggest newspapers in Germany right now
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:14.000]  is smearing yours truly in a clear example of libel, this is defamatory, claiming that I'm calling for violence.
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:24.000]  You heard the video earlier in which I was talking about the potential for riots if the mainstream media and the establishment continues to delegitimize
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  Trump and push for his impeachment. Riots that have already happened before Trump was inaugurated on inauguration day itself afterwards on many separate occasions.
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:44.000]  So I made a video talking about the potential for that. And by the way, police are stocking up on riot gear themselves preparing for this civil unrest.
[3:12:44.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  Made a video about it. The next day, Germany's biggest newspaper or one of the two biggest, I believe, comes out and says that I'm basically calling for violence.
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:13:06.000]  This is Frankfurter Alamein. I'm going to go through their ridiculous hit piece. But first, for the purposes of context, which they didn't actually use
[3:13:07.000 --> 3:13:12.000]  and they completely misunderstood my video and then smeared me, they got it completely wrong. It's blown up in their face.
[3:13:12.000 --> 3:13:19.000]  They didn't misunderstand their liars. They arrest you in Germany. If you say Muslims are raping people, Paul, they're lying scum.
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:28.000]  You should see this article. I love the German people. I'm part German. But after Hitler, they're domesticated. They believed his lies. They believe Merkel's lies.
[3:13:29.000 --> 3:13:34.000]  They're domesticated. They love Hitler. They love Merkel. They love Islam. They love lies. They hate freedom, Paul. Sorry.
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:45.000]  In the video, Alex, I say Trump needs to strike back in the context of replacing his media team and having better messaging.
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:48.000]  You said purge his staff and hire a better media team.
[3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:56.000]  And they said that I was calling to strike back against people in the streets, that I was calling for war and violence.
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:14:05.000]  When I said in the video, look what happened with the Syria attack last month. He went to war briefly and the deep state left him alone for a few weeks.
[3:14:06.000 --> 3:14:08.000]  Will he make that mistake again? That's what I said in the video.
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  You said violence was the mistake.
[3:14:11.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  Yeah. And in this article, they say I call for war and violence.
[3:14:15.000 --> 3:14:18.000]  That's because they are the great inverters. They are the great inverters.
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:26.000]  This is one of the worst things. I mean, it could only be down to poor translation. But again, this is not just some fringe blog.
[3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:30.000]  It's Frankfurter Allermain, probably the biggest newspaper in Germany.
[3:14:31.000 --> 3:14:35.000]  And the intro, we'll play the video in a second again, but the intro says,
[3:14:36.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  Donald Trump seems to be no longer just a desire for the left wing media, but many of his fans do not want to accept it.
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:47.000]  So again, this is a rough translation, but they're saying we don't want to accept that he might be impeached.
[3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  Some even call for violence if the establishment overthrows their idol.
[3:14:53.000 --> 3:14:58.000]  So they go on to say that I put out a video in which I call for violence.
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  I call for violent riots on the streets of America when that's what I said the left would do as they've done on numerous other occasions.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  Let's play the clip. Let's play the full video in context and then I'll get back into the article. Here's the video.
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  Trump's impeachment.
[3:15:15.000 --> 3:15:26.000]  The relentless hysterical six month long media campaign to delegitimize Trump was firmly based around setting the narrative that he's an illegitimate dictator.
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:29.000]  They're radicalizing the violent all left.
[3:15:29.000 --> 3:15:36.000]  We've seen the attacks on Trump supporters. We've seen the crazies trying to scale the White House fence over and over again.
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:39.000]  This summer, the situation could explode.
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  The drive to impeach Donald Trump will lead to either war abroad or war on the streets of America.
[3:15:47.000 --> 3:15:57.000]  Sources close to the White House indicate to us that sleeper cells within the administration, turncoats, will be the leading voices in the push to impeach Donald Trump.
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:16:07.000]  The same traitors responsible for the leaks in alliance with never Trump Republicans are feverishly working with the Democratic Party establishment to sabotage Trump.
[3:16:08.000 --> 3:16:13.000]  And thanks to the media bought and paid for by the deep state, the propaganda is working.
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:16.000]  But clearly we're on the trail there to an impeachment.
[3:16:17.000 --> 3:16:21.000]  Are we getting closer and closer to the possibility of yet another impeachment process?
[3:16:21.000 --> 3:16:30.000]  I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to call for the impeachment of the President of the United States of America.
[3:16:31.000 --> 3:16:33.000]  Are well on our way to impeachment.
[3:16:34.000 --> 3:16:38.000]  Odds of Trump being impeached by the end of 2017 have shot up past 30%.
[3:16:39.000 --> 3:16:42.000]  48% of Americans want to see it happen.
[3:16:43.000 --> 3:16:47.000]  And that's because the media has engaged in blitzkrieg-like onslaughts of deception.
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:50.000]  We're told this Comey memo is, quote, deeply troubling.
[3:16:51.000 --> 3:16:54.000]  So troubling that Comey sat on it for three months.
[3:16:55.000 --> 3:17:01.000]  So troubling that he kept it quiet for all that time and only released it days after he was fired.
[3:17:02.000 --> 3:17:03.000]  What a coincidence.
[3:17:04.000 --> 3:17:08.000]  So Trump tells Comey that he hopes he'll be fair to Flynn because he thinks he's a good man.
[3:17:09.000 --> 3:17:12.000]  And the media calls this obstruction of justice.
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:18.000]  Even CNN admits that this is part of the deep state's revenge against Trump.
[3:17:19.000 --> 3:17:21.000]  We know that this is, you know, they talk about the deep state.
[3:17:22.000 --> 3:17:27.000]  Well, these are communities that have a lot of loyalty within and know how to get back.
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:29.000]  And you're ugly.
[3:17:30.000 --> 3:17:37.000]  The same revenge that Chuck Schumer promised with an evil glint in his eye before Trump even took office.
[3:17:38.000 --> 3:17:40.000]  Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community.
[3:17:40.000 --> 3:17:43.000]  They have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[3:17:44.000 --> 3:17:46.000]  Oh, domestically in America, huh?
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:48.000]  He legal dumbass.
[3:17:49.000 --> 3:17:50.000]  The leak to the Washington Post.
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:56.000]  Trump tells Russia how to protect innocent people from being blown up on a plane by ISIS.
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:18:00.000]  And he's the monster for trying to save lives.
[3:18:01.000 --> 3:18:07.000]  Not a single shred of evidence has ever been presented to prove Trump colluded with Russia to influence the election.
[3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:09.000]  But that doesn't matter to these people.
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:11.000]  The end justifies the means.
[3:18:12.000 --> 3:18:16.000]  And the end game is the elimination of Trump at whatever cost to the country.
[3:18:17.000 --> 3:18:19.000]  Isn't it rich how they still grandstand?
[3:18:20.000 --> 3:18:21.000]  Like they've got the moral high ground.
[3:18:22.000 --> 3:18:26.000]  Keith Algerman begging foreign countries to launch a coup d'etat.
[3:18:27.000 --> 3:18:31.000]  You're literally trying to incite the overthrow of a democratically elected president.
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:34.000]  You don't have the moral high ground.
[3:18:34.000 --> 3:18:38.000]  These people are perfectly willing to see the country fail.
[3:18:39.000 --> 3:18:42.000]  If it means they can claim they were proven right about Trump.
[3:18:43.000 --> 3:18:47.000]  They're quite happy to see the plane go down even though they're on it.
[3:18:48.000 --> 3:18:50.000]  Just to soothe their butthurt about losing the election.
[3:18:51.000 --> 3:18:53.000]  Difference is they've got parachutes.
[3:18:54.000 --> 3:18:57.000]  The middle and working class Americans who voted for Trump don't.
[3:18:58.000 --> 3:19:00.000]  And they're the ones who are going to suffer.
[3:19:01.000 --> 3:19:02.000]  There are two courses of action for Trump.
[3:19:02.000 --> 3:19:07.000]  Either he initiates a massive purge of fifth columnists within his administration.
[3:19:08.000 --> 3:19:13.000]  As well as completely replacing his communications team which steadfastly refuses.
[3:19:14.000 --> 3:19:18.000]  Or is too incompetent and weak to fight back on any of these issues.
[3:19:19.000 --> 3:19:21.000]  The deep state has declared war on Trump.
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:23.000]  It's time to fight back.
[3:19:24.000 --> 3:19:25.000]  The other option is war.
[3:19:26.000 --> 3:19:28.000]  You saw what happened after the airstrike on Syria.
[3:19:28.000 --> 3:19:33.000]  The deep state left him alone for a few weeks and his approval rating recovered.
[3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:41.000]  Trump could launch a massive war and rally the country around that last refuge of scoundrels patriotism.
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:44.000]  But that's exactly what the deep state wants.
[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:48.000]  And once it's over they'll just keep undermining Trump anyway.
[3:19:49.000 --> 3:19:50.000]  Where's this all heading?
[3:19:51.000 --> 3:19:54.000]  If the media intensifies this effort to portray Trump as illegitimate.
[3:19:54.000 --> 3:19:58.000]  Which it will the situation will explode onto the streets.
[3:19:59.000 --> 3:20:03.000]  You'll see massive riots in major American cities this summer.
[3:20:04.000 --> 3:20:06.000]  And I'm not talking about protests that boil over.
[3:20:07.000 --> 3:20:13.000]  I'm talking full blown LA style riots, deaths and destruction of property.
[3:20:14.000 --> 3:20:16.000]  It may be triggered by something unrelated to Trump.
[3:20:17.000 --> 3:20:20.000]  But the frenzy will all feed into this collapse narrative.
[3:20:20.000 --> 3:20:24.000]  That's where it's heading and that's where they want it to go.
[3:20:25.000 --> 3:20:26.000]  The collapse of the Trump presidency.
[3:20:27.000 --> 3:20:33.000]  If it cannot be stopped will make the collapse of Venezuela look like a walk in the park.
[3:20:34.000 --> 3:20:40.000]  That's right it's the trigger for every brainwashed socialist globalist mental patient to go completely insane.
[3:20:41.000 --> 3:20:46.000]  Paul, we haven't prescripted this and I'm going to let you take over here but I really want your view on this.
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:50.000]  How big is it that our listeners sent us clips?
[3:20:51.000 --> 3:20:53.000]  It seemed like nobody else had pointed this out.
[3:20:54.000 --> 3:20:56.000]  That coming back in May said nobody tried to get him.
[3:20:57.000 --> 3:21:00.000]  I mean he said in the letter to Trump, you haven't tried to stop our investigation.
[3:21:01.000 --> 3:21:02.000]  You're not under investigation.
[3:21:03.000 --> 3:21:05.000]  So we already know that in writing but it's video of him saying it.
[3:21:06.000 --> 3:21:08.000]  Months after he puts this out, this is perjury.
[3:21:09.000 --> 3:21:11.000]  And you know I tweeted it at real Alex Jones.
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:13.000]  It's only got like three, four thousand retweets.
[3:21:13.000 --> 3:21:15.000]  So it sounds like a lot. It needs a lot more. We can click on that.
[3:21:16.000 --> 3:21:17.000]  I'll show folks also send some other tweets out.
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:21.000]  But I mean am I wrong or is this not really important to get out to people?
[3:21:22.000 --> 3:21:27.000]  No it's absolutely huge and I saw it circulating briefly yesterday but you're right.
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:29.000]  It's got nowhere near the attention it deserves.
[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:34.000]  Of course the other thing is you know it wasn't obstruction of justice even if this memo is true.
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:36.000]  And by the way nobody's seen it yet.
[3:21:37.000 --> 3:21:39.000]  Somebody told the New York Times that they'd seen it.
[3:21:39.000 --> 3:21:44.000]  Comey sat. It was such a bombshell shocker that Comey sat on it for three months.
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:48.000]  Oh somebody told me maybe once somebody saw a leprechaun riding a unicorn too.
[3:21:49.000 --> 3:21:51.000]  Exactly. And of course I'm glad you mentioned they told me later.
[3:21:52.000 --> 3:21:53.000]  Matt found this just in some email.
[3:21:54.000 --> 3:21:55.000]  We learned the great Cernovich was talking about it last night.
[3:21:56.000 --> 3:21:57.000]  That's why I love him so much.
[3:21:58.000 --> 3:21:59.000]  So people have finally found this clip.
[3:22:00.000 --> 3:22:01.000]  We're trying to push it big now.
[3:22:02.000 --> 3:22:03.000]  It's not about credit but even though we're pushing it big now,
[3:22:04.000 --> 3:22:05.000]  it's not going viral like it should.
[3:22:05.000 --> 3:22:11.000]  Comey said Trump never tried to influence him under oath two months after the White House meeting.
[3:22:12.000 --> 3:22:16.000]  The memo's either fake and Comey's letting the lie be there or he purging himself.
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  Oh it's absolutely huge.
[3:22:19.000 --> 3:22:21.000]  And the other thing even if you believe the text of this memo,
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:23.000]  it says like oh Flynn's a good guy.
[3:22:24.000 --> 3:22:25.000]  Hopefully you can you know let him off go easy on him.
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:29.000]  There's no direct order to stop an investigation anyway.
[3:22:30.000 --> 3:22:32.000]  And even in that clip that you're talking about of Comey,
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:36.000]  he says that even if Trump wanted to do that, he could do it.
[3:22:37.000 --> 3:22:38.000]  That's what Comey said.
[3:22:39.000 --> 3:22:40.000]  It's a larger clip.
[3:22:41.000 --> 3:22:42.000]  He's the president.
[3:22:43.000 --> 3:22:44.000]  Yeah, it's a total nothing.
[3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:46.000]  What do you make though?
[3:22:47.000 --> 3:22:48.000]  He has the Russian Foreign Minister like they're planning microphones.
[3:22:49.000 --> 3:22:50.000]  He's giving them.
[3:22:51.000 --> 3:22:52.000]  They're acting like the president can't even meet with a dog catcher.
[3:22:53.000 --> 3:22:54.000]  It's absolutely insane.
[3:22:55.000 --> 3:22:59.000]  The original conversations between Flynn and the evil Russians were about,
[3:22:59.000 --> 3:23:02.000]  oh let's try and work out how we don't go to nuclear war.
[3:23:03.000 --> 3:23:05.000]  And for that Flynn is absolutely dreadful.
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:07.000]  Yeah, maybe it should have been on record.
[3:23:08.000 --> 3:23:11.000]  But just the basic nature of it is not even shocking.
[3:23:12.000 --> 3:23:13.000]  Can you imagine the things that Obama got up to?
[3:23:14.000 --> 3:23:17.000]  Nobody's blowing the whistle on him of course because these people
[3:23:18.000 --> 3:23:20.000]  are within the National Security Advisory Board.
[3:23:21.000 --> 3:23:23.000]  There's 60% of them who are Obama holdovers.
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:25.000]  They're the ones who are sabotaging Trump.
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:28.000]  Let me ask you this and I'm going to cover the stuff you got lined up.
[3:23:29.000 --> 3:23:31.000]  A lot of them are saying it's hurting Democrats but it's also hurting Trump.
[3:23:32.000 --> 3:23:34.000]  But they just get more frantic, more crazy.
[3:23:35.000 --> 3:23:36.000]  We know the deep state wants to overthrow Trump.
[3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:38.000]  They want to kill him.
[3:23:39.000 --> 3:23:40.000]  I think they've got a good chance of either killing him or bringing him down.
[3:23:41.000 --> 3:23:42.000]  Then there'll be a civil war as you said in the country.
[3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:44.000]  These people are crazy.
[3:23:47.000 --> 3:23:49.000]  Alex, you've seen the number of people who try to infiltrate the White House.
[3:23:50.000 --> 3:23:52.000]  One of them basically got in the White House recently.
[3:23:52.000 --> 3:23:57.000]  This is all inspired by hysterical mainstream media propaganda.
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:23:59.000]  He should never be in the White House now.
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:04.000]  Listen Alex, you've got Maxine Waters today and I'm going to play the clip.
[3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:07.000]  They ask her what's the evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia.
[3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  She says that Vladimir Putin invented the phrases Crooked Hillary and lock her up.
[3:24:14.000 --> 3:24:15.000]  And that's the evidence.
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:21.000]  She claims that with absolutely no evidence whatsoever.
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:23.000]  It's like MSNBC even their shot.
[3:24:24.000 --> 3:24:25.000]  They're like, yeah, but what's the actual evidence?
[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:27.000]  She admits there isn't any.
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:31.000]  Not a single shred has ever been presented apart from a deluge.
[3:24:32.000 --> 3:24:38.000]  So what does it say though that crazy old ladies like Pelosi that thinks Bush is in office and all these clips are ruling us?
[3:24:39.000 --> 3:24:40.000]  It kind of says we're pathetic.
[3:24:40.000 --> 3:24:52.000]  Well, I mean, she's in another clip from 98 where she talks about the very process of impeachment and says that it's a coup d'état and that impeachment shouldn't even be allowed of any.
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:54.000]  I'm going to let you take over and play those clips.
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:25:03.000]  Great job, Paul, but I hope the listeners spread the word and retweet it from at Prison Planet and at Alex Jones and just Paul, you know how to get stuff out big on Twitter.
[3:25:04.000 --> 3:25:08.000]  How do we make the video in the article by Kit Daniels where I break this down?
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:10.000]  How do we make that go super viral and the video are coming?
[3:25:12.000 --> 3:25:19.000]  I would upload the video to Twitter then with the link to the Info Wars article and, you know, I can do it and then you can retweet it or the other way around.
[3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  Yeah, I don't care how you do it.
[3:25:22.000 --> 3:25:22.000]  Just tell us what to do because I know you're the master at Twitter.
[3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:23.000]  Okay, Paul, take over.
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:24.000]  I'm going to stop now.
[3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:25.000]  That unplugger.
[3:25:26.000 --> 3:25:26.000]  I'll keep talking.
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:27.000]  Go ahead.
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:28.000]  All right.
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:29.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[3:25:30.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  Yeah, I'll do that straight after the show.
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:33.000]  We're going to get to the Maxine Waters clip.
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  Just to round up on the German newspaper, Frank Fertileme, you heard the video.
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:37.000]  We just played it.
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:45.000]  Clearly, I was talking about striking back in the context of he needs to purge his media team in my opinion to strike back.
[3:25:46.000 --> 3:25:47.000]  I talked about him declaring war.
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:57.000]  He could declare war to get the deep stay off his back to please them in the context of patriotism being the last refuge of scoundrels.
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:25:59.000]  So I was saying war is bad.
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:02.000]  I then went on to talk about riots.
[3:26:02.000 --> 3:26:05.000]  What did I show when I was talking about riots?
[3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:11.000]  I showed Antifa leftist rioting protesting on the day of Trump's inauguration.
[3:26:12.000 --> 3:26:16.000]  Clearly, I wasn't talking about right wing Trump supporters rioting.
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:22.000]  I wasn't encouraging Donald Trump to launch a war to get the deep stay off his back.
[3:26:23.000 --> 3:26:28.000]  I was saying that will be the temptation given that it kind of happened before in April with the Syria strike.
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:37.000]  Absolutely clear context, yet Frank Fertileme says that I'm calling for violence if the establishment overthrows Trump.
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:39.000]  I'm calling for the exact opposite.
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:43.000]  I'm saying that's the threat we should prevent violence and riots.
[3:26:44.000 --> 3:26:45.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:26:46.000 --> 3:26:48.000]  You can go and read the translation of that article.
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:50.000]  I tweeted it out. Absolutely amazing.
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:53.000]  We have a few minutes left here in this segment.
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:57.000]  Let's go to Maxine Waters on, I think it was MSNBC.
[3:26:58.000 --> 3:27:02.000]  It was claiming she's asked what's the evidence for Russia, Trump collusion.
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:07.000]  She literally says Putin invented the phrase, lock her up and crooked Hillary.
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:09.000]  Here's the clip.
[3:27:10.000 --> 3:27:16.000]  I wanted to find what you mean by collusion because what you're talking about seems more circumstantial to me.
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:20.000]  Bank records, perhaps context that were of nebulous nature.
[3:27:20.000 --> 3:27:23.000]  Who knows why Flynn was talking to the Russian ambassador.
[3:27:24.000 --> 3:27:25.000]  It could have been, it seems to have been about sanctions.
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:27.000]  Collusion to me is very specific.
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:32.000]  It means that the Russian government or actors within were trying to elect Donald Trump.
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:37.000]  But I want to know what collusion means to you because that seems to be the standard by which you're saying he should be impeached.
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:39.000]  Yes, absolutely.
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:44.000]  I am talking about strategies that were developed working with the Trump campaign.
[3:27:44.000 --> 3:27:51.000]  I really do believe that much of what you saw coming out of Trump's mouth was a play from Putin's playbook.
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:59.000]  I think that when you saw him absolutely calling Hillary crooked, the lock her up lock her up.
[3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:01.000]  It was my playbook you dumb witch.
[3:28:02.000 --> 3:28:07.000]  I think that was developed strategically with people from the Kremlin, with Putin.
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:09.000]  Called the truth dumbass.
[3:28:10.000 --> 3:28:11.000]  Bank records.
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:18.000]  I think that you can see that visit to Moscow were made during the campaign by Manafort and others.
[3:28:19.000 --> 3:28:21.000]  I think it's a lot more absolute.
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  So you think the Russian government developed the talking points for the Trump campaign?
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:34.000]  I think that there was a cooperation in developing strategy about how they could ensure that Hillary Clinton was not elected.
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:36.000]  They need Trump.
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:38.000]  Trump will be there.
[3:28:38.000 --> 3:28:40.000]  That's what they wanted to happen.
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:42.000]  That's pretty much the end of it, Alex.
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:28:45.000]  Then they ask if there's any actual evidence of real collusion.
[3:28:46.000 --> 3:28:47.000]  She admits there's no evidence.
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:51.000]  She claims that Putin came up with crooked Hillary and lock her up.
[3:28:52.000 --> 3:28:53.000]  He doesn't even speak English.
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:28:55.000]  It's absolutely insane, Alex.
[3:28:56.000 --> 3:28:57.000]  And this is on MSNBC.
[3:28:58.000 --> 3:29:00.000]  You came up with a lot of this and so did I, Paul.
[3:29:01.000 --> 3:29:02.000]  I mean, we came up with the truth.
[3:29:03.000 --> 3:29:04.000]  Oh, exactly.
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:06.000]  I mean, you printed the t-shirts.
[3:29:06.000 --> 3:29:07.000]  I mean, we came up with that.
[3:29:08.000 --> 3:29:11.000]  There's another clip where she's talking about impeachment and probably get to that after the break.
[3:29:12.000 --> 3:29:16.000]  But again, this is the woman who's the prominent voice for wanting to impeach Trump.
[3:29:17.000 --> 3:29:24.000]  And her evidence is completely Louise Mench-level, crazy conspiracies about Putin inventing things.
[3:29:25.000 --> 3:29:27.000]  And let's be clear, she's the enemy of America, not Putin.
[3:29:28.000 --> 3:29:29.000]  Not that we love Putin.
[3:29:30.000 --> 3:29:31.000]  It's just the fact.
[3:29:32.000 --> 3:29:33.000]  This is the woman wants our guns.
[3:29:33.000 --> 3:29:35.000]  This is the woman bringing the Muslims.
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:37.000]  This is the woman lying constantly.
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:40.000]  This is the idiot that thinks Putin invaded Korea.
[3:29:41.000 --> 3:29:42.000]  She doesn't even know there's a North or South.
[3:29:43.000 --> 3:29:45.000]  This woman's a clear and present danger, as Cassini's already said.
[3:29:46.000 --> 3:29:47.000]  Jonathan Turley's come out.
[3:29:48.000 --> 3:29:49.000]  All the real liberals are horrified.
[3:29:50.000 --> 3:29:51.000]  Glenn Greenwald, Paul, you're taking over.
[3:29:52.000 --> 3:29:53.000]  We're on the march.
[3:29:54.000 --> 3:29:55.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.000 --> 3:30:03.000]  For the love of money, the Democrat theme song.
[3:30:04.000 --> 3:30:09.000]  Barack Obama making millions of dollars giving speeches immediately after the conclusion of his big money out of politics presidency.
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:14.000]  Al Gore trying to produce another global warming flick even after the miserable failure that was his first.
[3:30:15.000 --> 3:30:20.000]  Hillary Clinton starting a new super pat since the Clinton Foundation hasn't made enough money to raise money to fight President Trump.
[3:30:21.000 --> 3:30:23.000]  Now the Democrats are smashing records in online donations.
[3:30:23.000 --> 3:30:26.000]  The Democrats should be thanking Trump for making them so much money.
[3:30:27.000 --> 3:30:33.000]  To put the rush of cash into perspective, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised $19.7 million in 2015,
[3:30:34.000 --> 3:30:39.000]  but have raised $20 million so far this year with contributions averaging $18, chomping the chumps.
[3:30:40.000 --> 3:30:43.000]  Compare that to the $1.7 million raised by the National Republican Congressional Committee.
[3:30:44.000 --> 3:30:45.000]  And well, it doesn't compare, does it?
[3:30:45.000 --> 3:30:53.000]  This is all in a desperate push to win back the 24 seats needed to control the House of Representatives to put Nancy Pelosi back as majority House leader.
[3:30:54.000 --> 3:30:58.000]  But just like the 2016 presidential election, Democrats will waste their money and come out on bottom.
[3:30:59.000 --> 3:31:00.000]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[3:31:04.000 --> 3:31:06.000]  Let's go to Devin and Florida. Devin and Florida, you're on the air.
[3:31:07.000 --> 3:31:13.000]  Great. Hey, thank you so much. Listen, I have bought your product and I gotta say they're amazing.

[3:31:21.000 --> 3:31:22.000]  I've got the body armor.
[3:31:23.000 --> 3:31:23.000]  Wow, thank you.
[3:31:24.000 --> 3:31:27.000]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible. Which nutraceutical does you like best?
[3:31:28.000 --> 3:31:32.000]  I really like the vitamin mineral fusion, to be honest. That's really incredible.
[3:31:33.000 --> 3:31:36.000]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible. I haven't felt sweet.
[3:31:36.000 --> 3:31:48.000]  My morning was fantastic and I love you guys. I love the Infowars through and I just want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[3:31:49.000 --> 3:31:51.000]  You will love it. I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.

[3:32:06.000 --> 3:32:13.000]  Research across the board is clear. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[3:32:14.000 --> 3:32:20.000]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[3:32:20.000 --> 3:32:27.000]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[3:32:28.000 --> 3:32:34.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[3:32:35.000 --> 3:32:42.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[3:32:43.000 --> 3:32:47.000]  Due to requests from lifters who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children,
[3:32:47.000 --> 3:32:51.000]  we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint free.
[3:32:52.000 --> 3:32:56.000]  Learn more about the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue toothpaste and more at Infowarslife.com

[3:33:34.000 --> 3:33:41.000]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting Worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:47.000]  It's Paul Joseph Watson in for the fourth hour of the show.
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:57.000]  Today we are going to get back into the crazy world of Maxine Waters here in a second, but first I want to talk to you about an exciting new line of products at Infowarsstore.com.
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:03.000]  You've seen the attacks against us on a daily basis, talked about another one earlier, this is why we need your support.
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:08.000]  And these are the new EmRick's Essentials line of organic household products.
[3:34:09.000 --> 3:34:12.000]  So again, it's another one of those things where you're going to want to buy these products anyway.
[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:17.000]  They're everyday products that everybody uses, you know, sunscreen, body wash, bug spray.
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:21.000]  So why not buy them from us and support this network?
[3:34:22.000 --> 3:34:32.000]  After 23 years, we found a company run by a fellow patriot that was dedicated to producing high quality organic products that were even better and cost far less than other leading brands.
[3:34:33.000 --> 3:34:39.000]  So we have the non-nano SPF 30s ink oxide sunscreen, deep free herbal bug spray.
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:43.000]  And again, you're going to buy these products anyway, so get them from us.

[3:34:47.000 --> 3:34:53.000]  Again, this is all organic, unlike the crappy mouthwash that you can buy that's linked to cancer and all these other horrible things.
[3:34:54.000 --> 3:34:55.000]  The cheap stuff.
[3:34:56.000 --> 3:34:59.000]  We've got pure tea tree shampoo, long lasting natural deodorant.

[3:35:19.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  You know, Patreon has now started de-listing people, started banning them for hate speech because they have, God forbid, a different opinion.
[3:35:29.000 --> 3:35:34.000]  So people reliant on donations now or even being banned, censored off the Internet.
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:37.000]  Remember PayPal banned WikiLeaks.
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:40.000]  We're reliant only on you getting the products.
[3:35:41.000 --> 3:35:44.000]  That's why they can never take us down in that kind of manner.
[3:35:45.000 --> 3:35:49.000]  They're still going to attack us on a daily basis, but we rely on you and that is our strength.
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:52.000]  We don't rely on the establishment for our income.
[3:35:53.000 --> 3:35:55.000]  Please get the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:36:10.000]  Let's get back into Maxine Waters now who claims that proof of collusion between Russia and Trump is the claim that Putin invented the phrase lock her up and crooked Hillary.
[3:36:11.000 --> 3:36:21.000]  Yes, she actually said that even though Vladimir Putin doesn't even speak English, but that's the bombshell evidence of collusion between Putin and Trump.
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:25.000]  No evidence for it whatsoever, but you know, that's kind of the standard by now, isn't it?
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:27.000]  So should we really be that surprised?
[3:36:28.000 --> 3:36:35.000]  Now there's also another video which has re-emerged today from 1998 where she talks about impeachment of Bill Clinton.
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:42.000]  In the context of impeachment representing a coup d'etat, let's go to that video now.
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:53.000]  Mr. Speaker and members, how must our American soldiers feel to have their commander-in-chief under attack while they are engaged in battle?
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:56.000]  They have the right to field betrayed and undermined.
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:37:10.000]  Today we are here in the People's House debating the partisan impeachment of the President of the United States of America while the commander-in-chief is managing a crisis and asking world leaders for support.
[3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:13.000]  This is indeed a Republican coup d'etat.
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:25.000]  Mr. Speaker and members, Americans all, the Republicans will couch this extremist radical anarchy in pious language which distorts the Constitution and the rule of law.
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:37.000]  Bill and Hillary Clinton are the real targets and the Republicans are the vehicles being used by the right-wing Christian coalition extremists to direct and control our culture.
[3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:47.000]  The rule of law has been violated in denying the President notice of charges by the abuse of power in the collecting of so-called evidence.
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:53.000]  Okay, let's leave it there. That's Maxine Waters in 1998.
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:37:56.000]  Not such a big fan of impeachment then, was she?
[3:37:57.000 --> 3:38:01.000]  Calling it a coup d'etat, you'll notice she used the term pious language.
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:07.000]  She accused Republicans of using pious language to justify the impeachment of Bill Clinton.
[3:38:08.000 --> 3:38:11.000]  That's exactly what they're doing right now. I mean, have you watched Keith Olberman?
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:15.000]  It's this big thing like, oh, he's preventing the subversion of the country.
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:28.000]  It's that exact kind of pious language when in fact the only person subverting the country is him and his ideologues with all this hysteria backed up by absolutely nothing.
[3:38:28.000 --> 3:38:34.000]  Reuters admitted that today. Again, this is another story like the Comey video that nobody's really picked up on.
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:36.000]  It's on infowars.com.
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:40.000]  Headline Reuters admits no evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia.
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:49.000]  Of course, it was presented as this big scoop that Trump campaign advisors have spoke with Russian officials in the last seven months of the campaign.
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:57.000]  It's actually to try and prevent war with Russia and have peace and cooperation. God forbid we can't have that, can we?
[3:38:58.000 --> 3:39:01.000]  Hillary Clinton actually wanted war with Russia based on cyber security.
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  If they merely suspected Russia of attacking the US in the context of cyber security, she wanted war.
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:10.000]  That's good. That's progressive.
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:16.000]  We can't have the two major nuclear superpowers talking to each other and striving towards peace, can we?
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:18.000]  No, deep state doesn't like that.
[3:39:19.000 --> 3:39:20.000]  So it was introduced as this big scoop.
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  The actual meat of it is buried in paragraph six where it says quote.
[3:39:27.000 --> 3:39:30.000]  This is quoting anonymous intel sources again.
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:45.000]  The people who described the contact between Russia and the Trump administration to Reuters said that they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing or collusion between the campaign and Russia.
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:53.000]  So there you have it. They admit no collusion between Russia and Putin, between Russia and the Trump administration.
[3:39:53.000 --> 3:39:59.000]  Nothing. Another big fat nothing burger. They've got absolutely no evidence.
[3:40:00.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  Apart from Maxine Waters insane rambling conspiracy theories about Vladimir Putin inventing phrases for the Trump campaign that Alex Jones literally invented in one case.
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:15.000]  Putin doesn't even speak English.
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:22.000]  She's pulled that out of absolutely nowhere. She continues to make gaffes on television day after day after day.
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:26.000]  And they still put her up there as the credible voice of impeachment.
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:28.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:32.000]  Of course, we had the death of Roger Ailes announced today.
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:37.000]  When this was when this news broke, of course, a drudge report broke it first.
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:39.000]  I tweeted Roger Ailes is dead.
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:46.000]  Thousands of leftists on Twitter will now insult his grieving family by celebrating the news.
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:48.000]  Lo and behold, that's exactly what happened.
[3:40:49.000 --> 3:40:54.000]  Now, bear in mind, I would never celebrate the death of my worst enemy.
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:40:58.000]  It shows absolute a complete lack of class.
[3:40:59.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  It's vicious.
[3:41:01.000 --> 3:41:02.000]  It just reflects back on the person doing it.
[3:41:03.000 --> 3:41:05.000]  And that's exactly what's happened throughout today.
[3:41:05.000 --> 3:41:12.000]  You know, during World War Two, British soldiers fighting in a war against Nazis.
[3:41:13.000 --> 3:41:16.000]  If the Nazis were killed, they would give them respectful burials.
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:22.000]  Even Nazis would be respected in death, but not Roger Ailes.
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:24.000]  And I've tweeted some of these out today.
[3:41:25.000 --> 3:41:33.000]  A verified account on Twitter called May Fatigue tweeted a response to Alex Jones's tweet about Roger Ailes where he said,
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  you know, announced that he had died.
[3:41:35.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  She said, quote, hey, I guess both of you won't be seeing your kids.
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:43.000]  So she's not only insulting his memory.
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:45.000]  She's insulting his grieving kids.
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:47.000]  Very classy.
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:49.000]  Very, very classy indeed.
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:51.000]  Jank you go.
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:53.000]  Young Turks.
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:59.000]  This is what he said about Roger Ailes, quote, glad Roger Ailes lived long enough to get caught and died lonely and humiliated.
[3:41:59.000 --> 3:42:03.000]  That extra year of life cost him dearly.
[3:42:05.000 --> 3:42:13.000]  He's talking about someone who literally just died, who has grieving children, grieving family members.
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:16.000]  That's what Jank you go had to say about it.
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  Yeah, real classy, Jank real classy.
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:21.000]  Now, bear in mind.
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:24.000]  What happened after Ted Kennedy died?
[3:42:24.000 --> 3:42:27.000]  Did conservatives make fun of it?
[3:42:28.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  Probably a few of them did.
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  Did they celebrate it in such vast numbers?
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:36.000]  Were verified Twitter accounts celebrating it?
[3:42:37.000 --> 3:42:38.000]  Were pundits on the news celebrating it?
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:40.000]  No.
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:45.000]  Ted Kennedy, this is a guy who left a woman for dead in the Chappaquiddick incident.
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:47.000]  You've probably read about it.
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:49.000]  He drives off a bridge into the water.
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  He manages to escape.
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:53.000]  His partner at the time doesn't.
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:55.000]  He leaves her to drown.
[3:42:56.000 --> 3:43:00.000]  Doesn't report the accident for 10 hours to authorities.
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:06.000]  Leaving a woman to drown to death is significantly worse than anything Roger Ailes did.
[3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:12.000]  Allegedly assaulting women, which is bad, but you want to compare that to what Ted Kennedy did?
[3:43:13.000 --> 3:43:14.000]  Not on the same level, is it?
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:17.000]  Oh, but what happened when Ted Kennedy died?
[3:43:18.000 --> 3:43:19.000]  They all adored him.
[3:43:19.000 --> 3:43:20.000]  Of course they did.
[3:43:21.000 --> 3:43:23.000]  Nobody was talking about a Chappaquiddick incident.
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:28.000]  Certainly nobody on the right, nobody prominent, was celebrating his death
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:35.000]  and taunting his grieving family members like the classy leftists are doing today.
[3:43:36.000 --> 3:43:37.000]  Absolute disgrace.
[3:43:38.000 --> 3:43:44.000]  There's no level to which they won't stoop every single time.
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:50.000]  This is another article. Feminists attack Kimberly Guilfoyle for sending prayers to Roger Ailes family.
[3:43:51.000 --> 3:43:55.000]  She sent a tweet in memory of Roger Ailes and his grieving family members.
[3:43:56.000 --> 3:43:58.000]  She was viciously attacked by feminists.
[3:43:59.000 --> 3:44:03.000]  He, of course, reserved their most virulent hatred for smart, conservative women.
[3:44:04.000 --> 3:44:09.000]  Slate editor Sam Adams rejoices over death of Roger Ailes, then deletes tweet.
[3:44:09.000 --> 3:44:15.000]  Roger Ailes was an evil man who made the world a dramatically worse place on the bright side.
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:17.000]  He's dead now.
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:19.000]  They just can't resist.
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:21.000]  They cannot resist.
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:24.000]  They're vicious, vicious individuals.
[3:44:25.000 --> 3:44:32.000]  Again, even if my worst enemy politically died, if anyone died, you don't celebrate their death.
[3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:37.000]  You don't, I just, I just can't believe it.
[3:44:37.000 --> 3:44:40.000]  Yes, you don't have to worship them after they've died.
[3:44:41.000 --> 3:44:50.000]  You can still point out what was wrong with them, but you don't flagrantly celebrate their death when their family members are still mourning over it or ever.
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:57.000]  Again, the British used to give Nazis that they were fighting in a war with respectful burials.
[3:44:58.000 --> 3:45:01.000]  Yet these people can't even put out a respectful tweet.
[3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:05.000]  They can't even shut up about it for 24 hours.
[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:08.000]  They have to glow over the death of somebody.
[3:45:09.000 --> 3:45:10.000]  What does that say about them?
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:13.000]  Vicious, vicious, nasty people.
[3:45:15.000 --> 3:45:16.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[3:45:17.000 --> 3:45:19.000]  Moving on to cultural enrichment news now.
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:22.000]  We had the article up on infowars.com about an hour ago.
[3:45:22.000 --> 3:45:36.000]  Austrian town refuses to accept more refugees after migrants rape, gang rape, 15 year old girl, another European country enjoying the cultural enrichment that this mass refugee wave has brought.
[3:45:37.000 --> 3:45:43.000]  A town in Austria has refused to accept any more refugees after three migrants gang rape to 15 year old girl.
[3:45:43.000 --> 3:45:51.000]  She was walking home on April 25th, she was grabbed, she was brutally raped by two men from Somalia and one from Afghanistan.
[3:45:52.000 --> 3:45:57.000]  The police sat on it for nearly a month, refused to tell the public about it in this small town.
[3:45:58.000 --> 3:46:00.000]  Look at the picture there, look how nice that little town looks.
[3:46:01.000 --> 3:46:04.000]  This isn't even in a major city, this is just a quiet little town in Austria.
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:16.000]  Invited these people in, now you've got 15 year old girls being gang raped and the police said nothing about it for nearly a month putting the other citizens at risk.
[3:46:17.000 --> 3:46:20.000]  But now the mayor has basically told the government in Austria that's it.
[3:46:21.000 --> 3:46:26.000]  Zero tolerance, we're not taking in any more refugees until further notice because of this incident.
[3:46:26.000 --> 3:46:35.000]  Now it's interesting that it's in Austria because of course they were subjected to another act of cultural enrichment I think it was about 18 months ago now.
[3:46:36.000 --> 3:46:43.000]  When an Iraqi refugee raped a 10 year old boy at a swimming pool in Vienna and after he did it he didn't even try to flee.
[3:46:44.000 --> 3:46:49.000]  He thought it was perfectly normal natural behavior to rape a 10 year old boy.
[3:46:50.000 --> 3:46:54.000]  Oh and by the way he hadn't had sex for four months so it was a quote sexual emergency.
[3:46:54.000 --> 3:46:57.000]  That's literally what he told the police.
[3:46:58.000 --> 3:47:05.000]  These are the people we're inviting in, people who think it's normal to rape boys at swimming pools.
[3:47:06.000 --> 3:47:09.000]  Like the police are going to show up and they're just going to believe him.
[3:47:10.000 --> 3:47:11.000]  It's just normal, okay it's just normal.
[3:47:12.000 --> 3:47:21.000]  Maybe normal where you come from, it's not normal in Austria but the kicker was that his conviction is going to be reduced.
[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:34.000]  He originally got convicted but it's now going to a retrial because the judges found that he believed the child, the 10 year old boy had consented to be raped.
[3:47:35.000 --> 3:47:42.000]  So because this rapist claims that he thought the child wanted it, that means he's going to get off with a lighter sentence.
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:45.000]  Can you believe it?
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:53.000]  Again this is happening over and over again in swimming pools, you know men exposing themselves, grabbing on women, harassing women.
[3:47:54.000 --> 3:47:59.000]  In Germany and sometimes they had to ban quote refugees from using swimming pools altogether.
[3:48:00.000 --> 3:48:10.000]  They were called racist for that by the same frigging feminist that whine all day about a rape culture which doesn't exist while inviting a natural rape culture to take over their country.
[3:48:10.000 --> 3:48:18.000]  So now Austria is enjoying more cultural enrichment, migrants gang rape 15 year old girl, the police sat in it for nearly a month.
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:21.000]  Now they're saying we're not taking any more in.
[3:48:22.000 --> 3:48:29.000]  Over in Sweden, my favourite country, asylum seeker masturbated next to the wrong woman.
[3:48:30.000 --> 3:48:32.000]  What a headline that is out of Spicer, Spicer.
[3:48:32.000 --> 3:48:40.000]  An Iraqi asylum seeker sat next to 21 year old Hannah on the train and began to masturbate something he would soon regret.
[3:48:41.000 --> 3:48:43.000]  So she basically smacked him over the head.
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:46.000]  He fleed the train conductor, let him go.
[3:48:47.000 --> 3:48:48.000]  He fled.
[3:48:49.000 --> 3:48:50.000]  Thankfully they found him.
[3:48:51.000 --> 3:48:55.000]  Of course the thing here is that he thought it was natural.
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:49:05.000]  He thought it was perfectly acceptable to just go on an empty train where a woman sat on her own with her headphones on half asleep and to just start masturbating over her.
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:08.000]  He just thought that was completely acceptable.
[3:49:09.000 --> 3:49:21.000]  And I guess given previous examples where this has happened, where women have actually been raped on trains in Sweden in Germany and they've said well I didn't want to report it to the police because that might make me racist.
[3:49:21.000 --> 3:49:28.000]  We've seen women in Paris talking about how they're groped, sexually molested, harassed on the street.
[3:49:29.000 --> 3:49:33.000]  And they say well we have to be tolerant now, we have to be tolerant of this.
[3:49:34.000 --> 3:49:40.000]  They've brought their behaviour in, it's acceptable in their country, we just have to be tolerant of that because we're progressive.
[3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:45.000]  No you don't have to be tolerant of men grabbing on your breasts and trying to rape you.
[3:49:46.000 --> 3:49:47.000]  You frigging idiot.
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:50:01.000]  This is what the left is inviting in, the most regressive anti-woman, pro-rape culture belief system on the planet and they're stood there with the refugee welcome signs.
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:05.000]  Oh Paul, not all refugees, yeah absolutely terrible argument.
[3:50:06.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  Can you imagine if for example United Airlines had five planes crash on the same day and what would people's response to that be?
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:24.000]  The natural normal response would to be to say let's find out what the hell is going on, why five planes from the same company crashing on the same day.
[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  The normal response would not to be to say oh but there are a thousand United Airlines that didn't crash today so then we must not have a problem.
[3:50:34.000 --> 3:50:38.000]  Why are you obsessing about these five planes that crash when a thousand didn't?
[3:50:38.000 --> 3:50:47.000]  That's literally the argument they have when they say not all migrants, not all Muslims, not all refugees, yeah no one's debating that.
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:54.000]  That's not the argument, the argument is this is a problem, women are being molested and raped, we have to address it.
[3:50:54.000 --> 3:51:08.000]  We have to stop inviting in this rape culture, we'll be back on Alex Jones Show live info wars dot com, don't go away.
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:33.000]  Before the 60 days are up, I know that you will feel Extendivite working for you and will want to take another bottle.

[3:52:16.000 --> 3:52:18.000]  Research across the board is clear, in fact it's certified.
[3:52:19.000 --> 3:52:23.000]  When bacteria infect your gums it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.

[3:52:31.000 --> 3:52:37.000]  Super Blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodide so the bad halogen fluoride.

[3:52:59.000 --> 3:53:07.000]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[3:53:08.000 --> 3:53:17.000]  But the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[3:55:44.000 --> 3:55:47.000]  Let's hit some final news stories here in the last three minutes.
[3:55:48.000 --> 3:55:52.000]  Police departments stocking up on riot gear in preparation for summer of rage.
[3:55:53.000 --> 3:55:57.000]  Now, if you check the year by year amount spent on riot gear,
[3:55:57.000 --> 3:56:03.000]  baton, shields, pepper spray, whatever, it's going up significantly every single year.
[3:56:04.000 --> 3:56:09.000]  It's clearly designed to deal with demonstrations, protests that get out of hand.
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:16.000]  So people have crunched the numbers through Freedom of Information Act requests and they've found that across the country,
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:21.000]  police departments are spending more and more year on year on riot gear.
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:27.000]  Of course, this ties into the collapsed narrative I talked about in that Trump impeachment video,
[3:56:28.000 --> 3:56:37.000]  where you have the attempt by the media, by the establishment to delegitimize Trump to venerate, to legitimize riots against his administration.
[3:56:38.000 --> 3:56:44.000]  So that could very well happen and police across the country are definitely preparing for the worst.
[3:56:44.000 --> 3:56:51.000]  Now we have the BBC threatening to tell your bosses if you post offensive comments online, they actually say this.
[3:56:52.000 --> 3:57:02.000]  They actually vow and promise to contact people's employers if they post offensive or inappropriate content on BBC websites,
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:09.000]  which of course, according to them is any dissenting opinion in most cases, especially when it comes to immigration.
[3:57:09.000 --> 3:57:15.000]  You've seen the comment boards, for example, on other left-wing media outlets in the UK, like The Guardian, where it's just literally,
[3:57:16.000 --> 3:57:19.000]  your comment has been deleted, your comment has been deleted, your comment has been deleted.
[3:57:20.000 --> 3:57:23.000]  Everything's offensive to a regressive leftist.
[3:57:24.000 --> 3:57:32.000]  Now they're threatening to contact people's employers if they committed a thought crime or screw you BBC.
[3:57:32.000 --> 3:57:39.000]  This is, again, a taxpayer-funded body in the United Kingdom. You don't pay their mafia charge.
[3:57:40.000 --> 3:57:42.000]  They send goons around your house.
[3:57:43.000 --> 3:57:51.000]  Now they're threatening to report people, again, for leaving offensive comments on their news articles. Absolutely incredible.
[3:57:52.000 --> 3:57:58.000]  Also in Europe, Sweden's facing a chronic housing shortage, nearly a quarter of young people in Sweden still live at home,
[3:57:58.000 --> 3:58:03.000]  according to the Swedish Union of Tenants. That number's going up and up and up.
[3:58:04.000 --> 3:58:07.000]  As is the number of migrants who they invite into the country.
[3:58:08.000 --> 3:58:17.000]  163,000 people migrated to Sweden last year, 100,000 more people than the number who did so in 2000.
[3:58:18.000 --> 3:58:19.000]  So those numbers continue to rise.
[3:58:20.000 --> 3:58:26.000]  And what a surprise, the numbers of Swedish young people living with their parents continues to rise as well.
[3:58:26.000 --> 3:58:31.000]  It's a terrible situation economically, culturally. It's not working. It has to stop.
[3:58:31.000 --> 3:58:56.000]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour breaking news at infowars.com. Thanks for joining us.
