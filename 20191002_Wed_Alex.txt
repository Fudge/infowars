[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  Is it time to, dare I say, lock him up?
[00:18.000 --> 00:34.000]  What do you make of it?
[00:34.000 --> 00:35.000]  I created a monster.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.000]  I created a monster.
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.000]  I apologize.
[00:37.000 --> 00:52.000]  Everything they say is a lie, is a theft, is a counterfeit, is an inversion.
[00:52.000 --> 00:53.000]  Info wars.
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  Developed the lock Hillary up slogan.
[00:55.000 --> 01:00.000]  The Hillary for President 2016 meme.
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.000]  The Bill Clinton is a rapist, maxim.
[01:04.000 --> 01:16.000]  And our listeners, our activists, our patriots, our warriors, and the information war went out there and kicked the globalist butts up and down the street with the truth.
[01:16.000 --> 01:27.000]  And now Trump is moving with the Justice Department, finally getting a few decent people in with indictments, and they now know that, and that's why they are freaking out trying to remove the president.
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  Then the multinational corporations will put socialists and communists in charge and bankrupt the nation fully.
[01:33.000 --> 01:41.000]  Getting rid of any free market competition, they will be able to control and domesticate every person in this country.
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.000]  Our journey towards Venezuelan slavery is almost complete and Bernie Sanders has had a serious heart problem.
[01:47.000 --> 01:51.000]  They're trying to keep it on the DL, but he had emergency heart surgery.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  All campaign events have been canceled.
[01:53.000 --> 01:54.000]  He's 78 years old.
[01:54.000 --> 01:56.000]  He'd be the oldest person ever elected president.
[01:56.000 --> 02:06.000]  I just want to know if Bernie Sanders is going to go to Venezuela or Cuba, because there's all these videos of him in Cuba, in Venezuela, in Russia, going,
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  people don't need to have too much food or too many types of deodorant.
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  It's good when there are lines.
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  It's good when, these are quotes, let me pull them out, video.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  It's good when there are lines and you can't get enough food.
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  There's too much food.
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  The medicine, they have more doctors in Cuba, proposed it than anywhere.
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.000]  Yeah, and when you don't get cataract surgery, they give you a cane.
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.000]  You don't get knee surgery, they give you a cane.
[02:32.000 --> 02:35.000]  For infant mortality, it's off the charts, even worse than ours.
[02:35.000 --> 02:42.000]  Why aren't you going to Cuba to get your high worked on, Bernie, who wants to wreck our healthcare further?
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  Here's the report.
[02:44.000 --> 02:52.000]  What do you gauge how serious this is?
[02:52.000 --> 02:59.000]  We do hear a lot about stents being put in patients, as you said, when they are found to have some of these symptoms.
[02:59.000 --> 03:04.000]  Bernie Sanders, we know his physician just a few years ago put out a statement that he had no history of heart disease,
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.000]  no history of high blood pressure, only was treated for some mild high cholesterol.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  But this will take him off the trail, right, for some time.
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  You can't be very active after you've had this procedure.
[03:17.000 --> 03:23.000]  Well, listen, just from a medical standpoint, I think it's important to remember that, you know, the statistics,
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  again, every 40 seconds in the United States, someone has a heart attack.
[03:28.000 --> 03:30.000]  Okay, so let's pull back from this.
[03:30.000 --> 03:32.000]  No history of heart disease.
[03:32.000 --> 03:36.000]  How about being 78 and being on a very, very stressful circuit?
[03:36.000 --> 03:40.000]  He's even known as super stingy, super rude, super hateful.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  But now he's just downright mean to everybody.
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.000]  It's all over the news.
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  He's an old, hateful, bloodthirsty communist who wants your money.
[03:49.000 --> 03:54.000]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[03:54.000 --> 03:56.000]  This guy is a joke.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  This guy is a fraud.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  But what's this really going to do?
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  Because he's out.
[04:02.000 --> 04:10.000]  He'll still collect some money like he did bankrupting those universities for the three one million dollar homes.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  But anyone else with money is bad unless it's his money.
[04:14.000 --> 04:16.000]  He will control it.
[04:16.000 --> 04:17.000]  He knows best.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  This is going to help Elizabeth Warren because she's been offering a bunch of free stuff just like he has.
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  They've been at each other's throats for the number two spot.
[04:24.000 --> 04:34.000]  So Biden's fading off with all of his aneurysms and brain leakage, leaky blood vessels sitting down at the base of the brainstem.
[04:34.000 --> 04:41.000]  And so this catapult, Elizabeth Warren, the little meth head Pocahontas in two pole position.
[04:41.000 --> 04:42.000]  We'll be back on the other side.
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.000]  Have you heard of banned.video?
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  The site's getting better and better.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.000]  It's amazing.
[04:46.000 --> 04:47.000]  It's only been around a few months.
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.000]  A bunch of new features just got added.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  Check it out and share the links.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  Leftist say you better not.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  Don't go to banned.video.
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  Don't tell anybody about it, dirty Americans.
[04:57.000 --> 05:01.000]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong?
[05:01.000 --> 05:02.000]  Trying to fact check the president.
[05:02.000 --> 05:10.000]  The deceptive, humpty-dumpty troll known as Brian Stelter, his little weasel minion, Oliver Darcy,
[05:10.000 --> 05:14.000]  have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air into censor us.
[05:14.000 --> 05:18.000]  And of course he famously settled on many others that Trump is the info wars president.
[05:18.000 --> 05:26.000]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the info wars president.
[05:26.000 --> 05:27.000]  And you know what is true?
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.000]  Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew and my drive and your drive has brought Trump to the White House
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  and other nationalists to power around the world.
[05:35.000 --> 05:41.000]  And now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[05:41.000 --> 05:46.000]  So this is a day of great victory and I salute you all but now I'm the thick of the fight.
[05:46.000 --> 05:52.000]  So infowarstore.com for products you need, massive sales now so we can continue on to the future
[05:52.000 --> 06:17.000]  and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end until we've defeated them.
[06:17.000 --> 06:26.000]  President Biden was writing the annals from an honest perspective according to a classical western perspective
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  of what's currently happening in the world today.
[06:29.000 --> 06:31.000]  It would be very, very simple.
[06:31.000 --> 06:40.000]  Authoritarian corporations at the beginning of the 20th century went and overthrew countries they thought were weak
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  and who had governments that were unstable.
[06:43.000 --> 06:51.000]  There was what was left of the different imperial dynasties in China full of very intelligent, hardworking people
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.000]  but nevertheless corrupt, unstable governments.
[06:54.000 --> 07:02.000]  And so multinational corporations, robber barons, who really hated America and had been duking it out with us for 100 years,
[07:02.000 --> 07:09.000]  they went overseas as the new colonialist, really just an extension of the British and Dutch East India company model
[07:09.000 --> 07:18.000]  that had dominated India, dominated China, dominated the world and they actually set those countries up as political corporate army,
[07:18.000 --> 07:30.000]  clone army, that's what communism is, systems to go out and menace the West and take over what was left of the British Empire.
[07:30.000 --> 07:35.000]  And there was a lot of double dealing by the British Empire remnants
[07:35.000 --> 07:41.000]  while it opposed the Russians and opposed the Chinese communists
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  and built up its own giant militaries to counter that.
[07:45.000 --> 07:51.000]  It was actually running the dictators, controlling the dictators through funds and through embargoes.
[07:51.000 --> 07:55.000]  They didn't completely command them, but they controlled them.
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.000]  This is all written by, it was a big New Brzezinski in four books he wrote I read,
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  but it's not just that he said it, he was bragging about it.
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  Bragging how he put Pol Pot in, bragging how Pol Pot killed 30% of the population.
[08:08.000 --> 08:13.000]  At that level these guys brag about how many people they've killed with policy.
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.000]  Like Madeline Aldrich licking her lips when she talked about 500,000 dead Iraqi children
[08:18.000 --> 08:26.000]  when they tripled the sanctions that had been on Iraq, just blood thirsty, no penicillin, no medicine, no scalpels,
[08:26.000 --> 08:34.000]  no aspirin for, you know, eight years of Clinton, 500,000 dead kids, and she licks her little demon lips.
[08:34.000 --> 08:45.000]  Yeah, it was a good price to pay, because in their world that gets you up high in Satan's club.
[08:45.000 --> 08:49.000]  But I was protesting Bilderberg group.
[08:49.000 --> 08:55.000]  Oh, this has got to be like 12 years ago in D.C. and Chantilly.
[08:55.000 --> 09:01.000]  And they were saying nothing's happening in there, no one's there, Jones is crazy, the New York Times said, literally.
[09:01.000 --> 09:08.000]  There's helicopters, Marines, you know, guys in black SUVs and black sunglasses, MP5 sub machine guns in their coats,
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  talking into their, talking into their jackets.
[09:14.000 --> 09:22.000]  And all of a sudden Madeline Aldrich pulls in in a convertible with no security to the wrong entrance and people got footage of it.
[09:22.000 --> 09:29.000]  But I was there, I didn't have a camera in my hand, and she panics and screamed and turned around and ran off and never came back.
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  It was reported.
[09:31.000 --> 09:38.000]  So that's really who she is, a little scared demonic owl, like a little baby owl that had all its feathers pulled out.
[09:38.000 --> 09:49.000]  It's an ugly, stinking demon whose father worked with Hitler rounding up Jews and then robbing all their money.
[09:49.000 --> 09:57.000]  And then Hitler turned on her dad, so they ran to Serbia that saved him, and she repaid Serbia by bombing him with DU.
[09:57.000 --> 10:00.000]  And then letting the Muslims take over a third of their country.
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  I mean, I'm sorry, I was giving you history lesson here, but sorry, I'm digressing here.
[10:07.000 --> 10:14.000]  Why did I go down the road of talking about how many millions they kill and how they brag about it and how great it is?
[10:14.000 --> 10:21.000]  You just have to understand that if you were to historian in the future just accurately saying what's happening at this current time.
[10:21.000 --> 10:30.000]  Big mega corporations went and set up one-sided trade deals to set up China and to give them the biggest military, conventional military in the world.
[10:30.000 --> 10:39.000]  And that absolutely no human rights, no environmental standards, human cloning, animal cloning, mass organ harvesting, hell on earth.
[10:39.000 --> 10:42.000]  No science fiction movie could imagine something like this.
[10:42.000 --> 10:51.000]  If aliens landed and took over a billion, 400 million people and were doing evil things to them, they couldn't do stuff this evil.
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  I mean, China is basically the satanic command base.
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  It's the promised land of pure evil.
[10:58.000 --> 11:13.000]  Mass murder, torture, death, starving peasants everywhere forced off their land, 100 plus million dead.
[11:13.000 --> 11:22.000]  And then you've got America decadent using more drugs per capita than anyone else on air, killing our babies, killing them after they're born.
[11:22.000 --> 11:29.000]  Under globalist propaganda to break up the family and demoralize the people and the military falling apart.
[11:29.000 --> 11:38.000]  I'm going to cover this with sensitivity training and with transgenders while the Chai Khoms literally fund it and laugh at us.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  This is the insanity of what we become.
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.000]  We're a nation under judgment.
[11:44.000 --> 11:57.000]  And then Trump comes along and tries to just make us believe in ourselves again and to get some basic morals of just not hating ourselves and not trying to wreck everything.
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  Because it's so trendy because we're following globalist programming.
[12:00.000 --> 12:05.000]  And there have been three coup attempts to remove him from office.
[12:05.000 --> 12:11.000]  As he was president-elect, they tried to unseat the delegates and just not let him into office.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  That's a coup.
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.000]  And the Nancy Pelosi's daughter went on Fox and said, I threatened her.
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  And then I later learned the Justice Department almost indicted me.
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  I never threatened her on air.
[12:23.000 --> 12:29.000]  I said, she's a criminal and a traitor and the enemy of this nation.
[12:29.000 --> 12:38.000]  And then they tried to remove him from the fake Russiagate situation, war wires in and couldn't get President Trump set up with all their lawyer schemes, all those spiderwebs.
[12:38.000 --> 12:44.000]  And now they say, we don't care if what he did wasn't wrong with this Ukrainian president.
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  We don't care.
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  We're going to remove him one way or another.
[12:46.000 --> 12:47.000]  We have six committees on it.
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  We're going to bring forward articles in peace with my Thanksgiving.
[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  We want to vote to remove him by Christmas.
[12:55.000 --> 13:06.000]  That's the point we're in with horrible multinational ruthless corporations that hate families, hate free market, hate independence and want totally controlled corporate slaves.
[13:06.000 --> 13:07.000]  Total technocracy.
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  That's corporate computer controlled technocrat tyranny.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  That's what they call their system at Davos and at Bilderberg.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  They admit all this.
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.000]  This is not none of this is my opinion.
[13:20.000 --> 13:26.000]  And we're just spoiled rotten had all this freedom all this time have no idea this giant asteroid is coming into hit us.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  We've already been devastated by the globalist operation.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  Open devil worship pedophilia is being promoted everywhere.
[13:32.000 --> 13:39.000]  This is a snake bite a king cobra bite to debilitate us so we crawl over in the corner and die.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  What a spider does is the spider allegory spider bites you to immobilize you.
[13:44.000 --> 13:52.000]  Then it rolls you up in a web and then it lets you sit there and dissolve while the bite slowly kills you.
[13:52.000 --> 13:59.000]  And then the spider comes over and taps it with a foot with a leg and then knows right.
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.000]  The spider will put its every species of spider does this.
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  It'll put its leg on it and feel for the heartbeat.
[14:07.000 --> 14:14.000]  And then right when the heart beats almost there right at the point of death almost like spiders drink the spirit of the little dog.
[14:14.000 --> 14:22.000]  It comes over and goes and sinks in and then drinks all of the essence is sanguiating.
[14:22.000 --> 14:30.000]  And that's America's right at the point where the fangs Hillary was about to sink the fangs in.
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  But the Patriot Liberty Movement warned everybody.
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  So right at the last minute everybody knew we were right when all this stuff really coming through we warned of.
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  So we got an arm out a little sword and cut through part of it.
[14:41.000 --> 14:49.000]  And then we got out and we're climbing trying to get out of the hole of the sunlight the sunlight of truth and God will heal us.
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.000]  But here comes the spider and it's grabbed us and now it's biting us.
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  But now we're awake and we're fighting.
[14:56.000 --> 15:04.000]  But our fellow Americans collectively are giving us failure because we need every American to know what's happening to get out of this.
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  But the average American actually wants us to die.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  It's like oh the spiders my friend help it help it here.
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.000]  Bite me here.
[15:10.000 --> 15:11.000]  I'm bad.
[15:11.000 --> 15:12.000]  Get rid of me.
[15:12.000 --> 15:13.000]  I'm evil.
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  Tell me I'm evil.
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.000]  I'm bad.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  America was never great.
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  Of course because here's the thing that Stockholm syndrome they believe they're the spider.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  They believe they're the ruling class.
[15:23.000 --> 15:30.000]  The video you see of the old women and people being bullied and beaten up and hitting the habit bike locks and people in wheelchairs being attacked by antivirus.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  You go why would anyone do that?
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  Why do they single out the week?
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  That looks horrible.
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  They don't care the most evil thing they can do they do.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  Because to them spiritually they are a spider.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  They see an old woman that can barely walk.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  That's time to sink things.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  They want to get you tied up to sink those things.
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  But they want your guns they want everything.
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.000]  Hi I'm Dan Pilla.
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:07.000 --> 16:12.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:12.000 --> 16:13.000]  I can help you too.
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay don't wait another day.
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.000]  Call 834 no tax or go to my website danpilla.com.
[16:22.000 --> 16:26.000]  That's danpilla.com danpilla.com.
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[16:29.000 --> 16:35.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up
[16:35.000 --> 16:38.000]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[16:38.000 --> 16:43.000]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[16:47.000 --> 16:52.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.000]  Because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[16:56.000 --> 17:02.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory.
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  So here's what you should do right now.
[17:06.000 --> 17:10.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.000]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.000]  In the best part you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.

[17:24.000 --> 17:37.000]  Visit myownpowergrid.com
[17:55.000 --> 17:59.000]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[17:59.000 --> 18:01.000]  Alex, God bless you.
[18:01.000 --> 18:06.000]  I have an idea for a new info wars t-shirt instead of this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs,
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.000]  this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[18:09.000 --> 18:10.000]  Oh yeah.
[18:10.000 --> 18:11.000]  Showing your brain, getting fried.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  Then I have some comments on your supplements man.
[18:13.000 --> 18:14.000]  Pull the chain of my life.
[18:14.000 --> 18:20.000]  I use turbo force, bodies, album power, brain force, fish oil, ultra 12, daily X2 every several days.
[18:20.000 --> 18:28.000]  Now what I've found is really combining them is to a synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products.
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  And I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them, I just want to say why not.
[18:32.000 --> 18:33.000]  Well you're right.
[18:33.000 --> 18:35.000]  All of these things are known to be incredible.
[18:35.000 --> 18:42.000]  Whether it's turmeric or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and bioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.000]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation.
[18:47.000 --> 18:50.000]  Now you can build the big strong temple.
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.000]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better.
[18:53.000 --> 18:56.000]  And then it funds the information war, which is so critical.
[18:56.000 --> 18:57.000]  Thank you so much.
[18:57.000 --> 18:58.000]  God bless you.
[18:58.000 --> 19:04.000]  Where I stand, the world is heard from presidents, premiers, rebels and heroes who embolden us.
[19:04.000 --> 19:09.000]  Tuesday, the 24th of September 2019 is a historical day.
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.000]  President Trump threw down the gauntlet and said globalism is not the future of the planet.
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.000]  The future does not belong to globalists.
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.000]  And then Trump went after them on how the Chai comms are sealing their intellectual property.
[19:22.000 --> 19:31.000]  Dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, forced technology transfers and the theft of intellectual property.
[19:31.000 --> 19:38.000]  It was simply amazing and then he talked about the ruling leftist elite and their censorship and how it must be met head on.
[19:38.000 --> 19:45.000]  My administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right of free speech.
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  This is amazing.
[19:47.000 --> 19:53.000]  Find highlights and Trump's entire historic speech at infowars.com and band.video.
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.000]  Band.video!
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  And God bless America.
[19:56.000 --> 20:09.000]  Thank you very much.
[20:26.000 --> 20:38.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:38.000 --> 20:43.000]  Okay, let me cut right to the chase here, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:43.000 --> 20:52.000]  The globalists are making their move against humanity and it's not just about one empire taking over another empire.
[20:52.000 --> 21:10.000]  It's about the takeover of the human civilization itself so that normal human activity is captured in a corporate scientific system where you can't even have children without government authorization and corporate authorization.
[21:10.000 --> 21:20.000]  And where the children are no longer human, they have been changed genetically to where they are a humanoid chimera.
[21:20.000 --> 21:25.000]  To quote, genetically certify that they're not going to be deviant.
[21:25.000 --> 21:31.000]  The social score will be put directly in to the new humanoids.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  Raven World was written in 32.
[21:33.000 --> 21:38.000]  Huxley in 62 before he died, wrote a book and went public and said this is really a plan.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  His brother ran the UN UNESCO at that time.
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  Everything else is window dressing.
[21:45.000 --> 21:55.000]  This is a scientific plan and China, when the United States had defeated the Japanese in 1945, was in shambles.
[21:55.000 --> 22:04.000]  And the globalists, the robber barons, the Rockefellers put Mao Zedong into power and he followed all the orders.
[22:04.000 --> 22:11.000]  Now they had a coup later put his wife in prison, removed him, house arrest, they still kept him as an icon.
[22:11.000 --> 22:24.000]  That's why when the Chinese see leftist here praising Mao, they think we're crazy because they quote, reformed away from him some, you know, and only killed a few million a year, not, you know, 10 million a year, some years.
[22:24.000 --> 22:29.000]  Because Mao and others thought that they were helping exterminate the Chinese.
[22:29.000 --> 22:35.000]  In fact, there was one Chinese president came after him and said, oh, let's have a nuclear war with the United States. We need to get rid of people.
[22:35.000 --> 22:41.000]  That's why they have a one child policy. That's why they have compulsory vaccines.
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.000]  They're about to start the HPV shot that causes a large percentage of women to become sterile that take it.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  That's why everyone in Mexico has been ordered to take it.
[22:49.000 --> 22:53.000]  All the women and suddenly their fertility is dropping and you can go, well, we're overpopulated.
[22:53.000 --> 23:00.000]  Folks, this is a larger secret program and everyone needs to understand what's at the bottom of it.
[23:00.000 --> 23:22.000]  So today, I am going to play several segments of the official 50 minute long parade with Xi Jinping marking the 70 anniversary of the 1949 communist takeover and the greatest bloodletting and feasting on innocence.
[23:22.000 --> 23:32.000]  The world's ever seen the Chinese people are the victims of the globalist that put linen in power in 1917 in Russia.
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.000]  They put Mao in power in 1949.
[23:37.000 --> 23:42.000]  They then only opposed Ho Chi Minh because he wouldn't follow globalist orders.
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  You notice Ho Chi Minh is not under China.
[23:45.000 --> 23:49.000]  Was there the Japanese? You notice the Vietnamese won't take orders from anybody.
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  That's what that's all about.
[23:51.000 --> 23:59.000]  Ho Chi Minh was actually working with the CIA during or OSS during World War II.
[23:59.000 --> 24:08.000]  So we're going to go over all of this here today and the fact that it's now admitted it's either the Chinese future or the American future.
[24:08.000 --> 24:23.000]  That means what made America great, free market, family, self-defense, incredible wealth and success, and a Christian ethos or the globalist World Social Score, CHICOM question.
[24:23.000 --> 24:35.000]  I've been harping on that for 20 years because I read the CFR's plan to deploy everything to China to sign everything up where it's one-sided where you could not do business in the United States.
[24:35.000 --> 24:54.000]  We have been put under economic siege to geld us and they have pushed deadly drugs and psychotropics and illegal drugs and massive alcohol and cultural death on us and the breakdown of the family to prepare us to be absorbed into what is now happening.
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.000]  This has all been engineered to make us weak.
[24:59.000 --> 25:13.000]  And then you look at the homogeneous Chinese, they fund racial division, they fund the sexist fighting with each other, they fund homosexuality in the U.S., they execute you for any of that in China.
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.000]  And by the way, I'm a classical liberal.
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  I believe in human freedom and free will.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  I'm not attacking anybody.
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  But you notice the left's ally with the CHICOMs who would kill them.
[25:29.000 --> 25:34.000]  And that's because the left is working for the dark side.
[25:34.000 --> 25:45.000]  And the Bible talks about the mystery of evil, evil's own psychic internet, how they communicate with each other, how they're guided, how they're driven to their own destruction.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  But they carry it out.
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  I'm going to air some of the incredible footage and I'm going to obviously talk over it.
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  Some serious, some sarcastic.
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.000]  I think we're going to get a little visit from the Chinese communist dragon Fenton all day live on air.
[26:00.000 --> 26:15.000]  But when you see the hundreds of ICBM launch trucks, all with their new 10 warhead delivery system that is a direct copy of the Laurel Hughes rocket,
[26:15.000 --> 26:21.000]  given to them in 1996 by William Jefferson Clinton.
[26:21.000 --> 26:30.000]  And that's why the aircraft, the helicopters, the missiles, the Russians never gave China any offensive weapons.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  Never gave them the technology, never gave them any of it.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  But our evil government gave them everything.
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  Here's a key article. Let's scroll through it.
[26:40.000 --> 26:50.000]  News wars.com China unveils doomsday bomb where one ICBM delivers 10 warheads while US military concentrates on diversity keeps growing down.
[26:50.000 --> 26:56.000]  And it shows the obese women that are the leaders of our forces.
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.000]  And then it shows.
[27:01.000 --> 27:14.000]  It shows the commanding generals literally giving speeches saying we have flesh colored band-aids because your skin is flesh colored.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  And we don't want it to stand out.
[27:16.000 --> 27:22.000]  So they have to give speeches that we're sorry that mandates are brown or tan.
[27:22.000 --> 27:33.000]  Now that's total Psyop mental illness and all the academies order cadets to go right inwards on the vending machines to then have a big freak out and sabotage the forces.
[27:33.000 --> 27:36.000]  They're those generals are all CFR folks.
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  They've all got investments in China.
[27:38.000 --> 27:46.000]  They have they have meetings at the Army War College at the Navy War College for people like Thomas Barnett get up there and say America's part of world government.
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.000]  America's over, you know, anybody that isn't for world governments and enemy.
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  I mean, you have to understand it's total commitment to the destruction of the nation.
[27:54.000 --> 28:02.000]  Total commitment and the military up tops all globalists basically they just can't let the lower ranks know what's going on or they rebel.
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  But this is the phase out now that robots and machines are going to take over for almost every operation.
[28:08.000 --> 28:19.000]  They've got to demoralize the military give them drugs they know cause suicide run programs that depress them shoot them full of vaccines with cancer viruses that are estrogen and testosterone based.
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.000]  So they trigger right around retirement at about 55.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.000]  Then they suck all the money out of you while you die.
[28:26.000 --> 28:33.000]  And the vaccines injected in our troops are made in globalist labs in China carrying out the operation.
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  But don't worry, the Chinese have signed internal treaties.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  They give it to their troops as well.
[28:38.000 --> 28:47.000]  Getting rid of too many people is our job working together under the new world order to scientifically they understand what has to be done and all of you are dead, dead, dead.
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  And you won't believe me. So you're going to die. You're going to die.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  The children's going to die. They're going to murder all of you.
[28:53.000 --> 29:20.000]  And Satan's going to piss on you and you're going to love it.
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.

[30:15.000 --> 30:20.000]  And M4 Wars has been under unmitigated attack because we helped get Trump into office.

[32:52.000 --> 33:18.000]  America and the World is fighting back against tyranny at Band.video.
[33:22.000 --> 33:30.000]  I'm going to steal me a silver stallion.
[33:30.000 --> 33:36.000]  You know, Americans need to stop celebrating our amazing past.
[33:36.000 --> 33:41.000]  And at the same time, not going out and defending our future because we've been overrun.
[33:41.000 --> 33:46.000]  Our openness, our hospitality has been used as a weakness against us.
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.000]  And America is on its last legs.
[33:49.000 --> 33:56.000]  You know, I wasn't being sarcastic earlier when I talked about cancer viruses that are put in the vaccines on purpose to kill you and your family.
[33:56.000 --> 34:01.000]  That is a declassified globalist weapons program. It's been going on since the 50s.
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  They gave everybody the polio. The UN goes out and gives the shots.
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  Almost everybody gets the polio today. The media manages it. They cover it up.
[34:09.000 --> 34:18.000]  I have a stack of statistics from the CDC I'm going to cover next hour where they show directly
[34:18.000 --> 34:24.000]  that everywhere where you increase vaccines, people live less longer.
[34:24.000 --> 34:30.000]  And as vaccine numbers go up and as you take more vaccines, you die younger.
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  And as glyphosate use goes up, you die younger.
[34:34.000 --> 34:43.000]  The United States just announced that our life expectancy is the lowest of anyone in the industrialized world and it's dropping faster and faster.
[34:43.000 --> 34:54.000]  The program is going well. Our infant mortality is the worst in the industrialized world as well.
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.000]  So we're going to break it all down. And you know, here's the thing.
[34:58.000 --> 35:05.000]  I know it's scary to admit all this is going on. You've seen almost everything else I talk about come out and turn out to be true.
[35:05.000 --> 35:14.000]  You see, this scientific elite, as they call themselves, is so ruthless, they believe you can't wrap your mind around what they're doing.
[35:14.000 --> 35:26.000]  I told you 13 years ago that Bill and Melinda Gates were hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein at a eugenics world government conference that they hold secretly.
[35:26.000 --> 35:32.000]  It's in the news this year. Now, that is about to be going, oh, look, I'm right about something. I'm right about it.
[35:32.000 --> 35:41.000]  This is in plain view. My grandmother was given the polio vaccine. The second round, a new mutation, they said. She needed it.
[35:41.000 --> 35:55.000]  She got it a week later. It almost killed her. Her medical doctor told her, you got it from the polio shot.
[35:55.000 --> 36:02.000]  And I went to her when her mind was still there before she died at 92. And I said, well, you say that on video.
[36:02.000 --> 36:09.000]  And she said, I've prayed about it. And those doctors didn't mean bad. And the medical system does a lot of good.
[36:09.000 --> 36:17.000]  So I just don't think it's Christian for me to complain that I got polio from the vaccine because I'm sure it was an accident.
[36:17.000 --> 36:28.000]  They almost all the nerves in her body. She was in tortured pain from the early 1950s until she died in 2017.
[36:28.000 --> 36:36.000]  And she wouldn't even talk about it because it wasn't ladylike. I love her to death.
[36:36.000 --> 36:41.000]  But that's why we're in so much trouble because they did it to her.
[36:41.000 --> 36:49.000]  And the doctors carried it out and they knew damn well it was full of SV40 cancer virus.
[36:49.000 --> 36:57.000]  She even got one of the cancers that SV40 gives you.
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.000]  You know, you watch them cut your grandmother's head off. You watch them torture.
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.000]  And you're all just supposed to sit there and just love it. Oh, kill me some more medical doctors.
[37:06.000 --> 37:11.000]  I just love what you're doing. And these medical doctors are all cultists. They follow their little computer, tells them what to do.
[37:11.000 --> 37:18.000]  They all go out and play golf all day and all the rest of it. And they all know damn well, bear ships out HIV and hepatitis on purpose.
[37:18.000 --> 37:25.000]  They know damn well. They're still giving out live viruses. They know damn well. And you know what? Their kids will die. They don't care.
[37:25.000 --> 37:30.000]  They are going to die. Their wife's going to die.
[37:30.000 --> 37:38.000]  Hell, most of these doctors, though, won't even take it. You know, I've had four children in hospitals and they'll get a medical doctor that's a listener.
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.000]  And they're like, well, we know you don't want to take it. And then the medical doctor and then the nurses, they all go, we all actually know it's true.
[37:44.000 --> 37:53.000]  We don't really like to take them either, in fact, but they're threatened to fire us if we don't. You know, the premies die when we give them the vaccines.
[37:53.000 --> 38:01.000]  So first they press you to do it, then let her go. Oh, I know you're right. I see them killed. I see the babies have the convulsions.
[38:01.000 --> 38:07.000]  But we all just do it because it's fun. And China follows the same UN treaty through UNESCO.
[38:07.000 --> 38:13.000]  They take all the same vaccines we do. And now they're rolling up their sleeves. They said you do it first.
[38:13.000 --> 38:24.000]  And so the U.S. and Mexico and others gave our daughters HPV, doesn't protect you from cancer, total fraud, attacks your ovaries, massively reduces fertility.
[38:24.000 --> 38:32.000]  And China just announced this week, okay, you did it. We're going to give it to our women now.
[38:32.000 --> 38:41.000]  And it's all part of a big sick club and you ain't in it. So yeah, this is a horrible truth. It's absolutely nightmarish.
[38:41.000 --> 38:46.000]  You know, I sat there for this morning already knew all this, but I wanted to go pull it all back up.
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  So I was up at like 5 a.m. before the sun rose sitting there in my kitchen table.
[38:50.000 --> 38:58.000]  And I saw an article about how China is coming out with a cancer vaccine. Sure.
[38:58.000 --> 39:05.000]  And then I saw an article right next to it about how life expectancy in China is going down and life expectancy in the U.S. is going down.
[39:05.000 --> 39:13.000]  And life expectancy in Brazil is going down because, you know, they're now very scientific in Brazil. They take all their shots now too.
[39:13.000 --> 39:21.000]  The U.N. says that the quote ignorant Africans run from the U.N. vaccine vehicles. They used to run to them.
[39:21.000 --> 39:29.000]  Because, you know, 60, 70 years ago, the white witch doctors did have some big medicine for you. They run now and they say, they say it makes you sick.
[39:29.000 --> 39:35.000]  You waste away and you die. And the women only interviewed in India and in Pakistan and in Africa.
[39:35.000 --> 39:44.000]  There's documentaries and they go, my baby's six months, it's moving in me. And then I, they give me shot, baby, stop, move.
[39:44.000 --> 39:50.000]  Everyone always knew you didn't give pregnant women vaccines until about seven years ago. It was on all the inserts. Don't do it.
[39:50.000 --> 39:54.000]  Now they have announcements. Oh, give pregnant women too.
[39:54.000 --> 40:07.000]  And they have all these articles about how many vaccines should a baby take at once. And there's articles at PubMed with no study link going, oh, well, if there was 100 vaccines given at once, there's no limit.
[40:07.000 --> 40:17.000]  Of course, they'll really tell you that if somebody's on chemotherapy, they shouldn't take a vaccine or be around somebody that takes a vaccine.
[40:17.000 --> 40:27.000]  Because everybody knows they've got a lot of viruses in them. You know, folks, the Rockefellers took over our medicine about 110 years ago and books have been written on it.
[40:27.000 --> 40:33.000]  And they're really bad people. And they funded the different cancer research institutes.
[40:33.000 --> 40:43.000]  By the 20s, they isolated that most cancers viral. A virus goes in and programs yourself to start replicating faster than it's supposed to.
[40:43.000 --> 40:48.000]  Because the viruses want more cells to replicate themselves in.
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.000]  And so they put them in there. And I'm going to explain this again.
[40:52.000 --> 40:58.000]  Most of these weaponized viruses are designed because the stuff they had in the 20s was bad, but the stuff they got now is way worse.
[40:58.000 --> 41:05.000]  You know, what they do in the 20s is they find somebody with really fast active cancer and they knew it was communicable.
[41:05.000 --> 41:13.000]  They would just culture that and then they put it in oral vaccines for you and your family.
[41:13.000 --> 41:23.000]  And then what it does is it would usually be a cancer from a 55, 60 year old man or woman who was becoming pre or menopausal or lower testosterone or lower estrogen.
[41:23.000 --> 41:32.000]  And then they just knew that these viruses were associated with that, that they tend to bloom in the tissues once the hormones are lower.
[41:32.000 --> 41:40.000]  And they're going to kill you and your family. They're going to kill you and they're going to love it and they're going to enjoy it and you're going to enjoy it.
[41:40.000 --> 41:43.000]  So let me tell you again, get your kids all the shots.
[41:43.000 --> 41:49.000]  Hell, I won't say if everybody gets mad, but there's two people in this building whose kids died from vaccines and they admitted it to them.
[41:49.000 --> 41:57.000]  But that's no big deal, ladies and gentlemen. Again, Satan wants you to die and it's liberal.
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.000]  So die.
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.000]  But first do it excruciatingly painfully.
[42:07.000 --> 42:13.000]  So these big corporations can suck every damn dime of money out of you.
[42:13.000 --> 42:19.000]  Okay, Bill Gates is better than you. He rules you. Die.
[42:19.000 --> 42:30.000]  He walks into those facilities with the kids with the shaved heads all dying. He just feels good. The power he's got is devastating kill, devastating kill, murder, death, slaughter, just knocking them down.
[42:30.000 --> 42:38.000]  He gets up on Ted TV and says, we're going to reduce the human population to zero and the left goes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:38.000 --> 42:52.000]  Because their God is taking them over there is going to kill everybody. So drink your fluoride, drink your glyphosate, take your shots, eat your GMO and just do what you're told and take your children and have them sterilize.
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.000]  It's liberal. Shot their balls off. It's liberal. It's not mutilation.
[42:56.000 --> 43:01.000]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong? Trying to fact check the present.
[43:01.000 --> 43:13.000]  The deceptive, humpy, dumpy troll known as Brian Stelter and his little weasel minion, Oliver Darcy, have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air and to censor us.
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.000]  And of course, he famously settled on many others that Trump is the Info Wars president.
[43:17.000 --> 43:25.000]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the Info Wars president.
[43:25.000 --> 43:34.000]  And you know what is true? Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew and my drive and your drive has brought Trump to the White House and other nationalists to power around the world.
[43:34.000 --> 43:40.000]  And now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[43:40.000 --> 43:45.000]  So this is a day of great victory and I salute you all, but now we're in the thick of the fight.
[43:45.000 --> 43:56.000]  So infowarstore.com for products you need, massive sales now so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end until we've defeated them.

[45:24.000 --> 45:32.000]  Already two weeks ago, the appeal by the Deputy Attorney General was rejected. The appeal was brought to him and it was rejected.
[45:32.000 --> 45:37.000]  That means the indictment is there. That's why they're so panicked. That's why this impeachment's real.
[45:37.000 --> 45:44.000]  Of course it's made up. Of course it's a fraud, but it's the neocon and leftist deep state that knows they've committed so many crimes.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  They're back as against the wall and they're making their move right now.
[45:48.000 --> 45:55.000]  This is the time to be fully engaged, ladies and gentlemen. We're fighting for not just our nation, but the world's future.
[45:55.000 --> 46:19.000]  America is fighting for its life.
[46:25.000 --> 46:30.000]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[46:30.000 --> 46:34.000]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[46:34.000 --> 46:41.000]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.

[47:00.000 --> 47:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:09.000 --> 47:17.000]  It's never going to get any better. Don't look for it. Be happy with what you got.
[47:17.000 --> 47:23.000]  Because the owners of this country don't want that. I'm talking about the real owners now.
[47:23.000 --> 47:29.000]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[47:29.000 --> 47:35.000]  Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[47:35.000 --> 47:41.000]  You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you.
[47:41.000 --> 47:47.000]  They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations.
[47:47.000 --> 47:50.000]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses and city halls.
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  They got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies.
[47:54.000 --> 47:57.000]  So they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.000]  They got you by the balls.
[48:00.000 --> 48:07.000]  They want obedient workers, obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork
[48:07.000 --> 48:13.000]  and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits,
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.000]  the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[48:17.000 --> 48:24.000]  And now they're coming for your social security money so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[48:24.000 --> 48:31.000]  It's a big club and you ain't in it. You and I are not in the big club.
[48:31.000 --> 48:38.000]  The owners of this country know the truth. It's called the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[48:38.000 --> 48:44.000]  But I'll tell you what, they don't want. They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[48:48.000 --> 48:55.000]  They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them. That's against their interest.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  That's great.
[49:03.000 --> 49:13.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[49:13.000 --> 49:22.000]  You know, I was told probably 15 years ago when I was talking to some of the folks in the national media at the highest levels.
[49:22.000 --> 49:28.000]  They said, yeah, we've talked to some of the psychological warfare engineers, the social engineers.
[49:28.000 --> 49:35.000]  And they said, oh, we just leave Jones on air because he thinks people are going to get upset about all this and do something.
[49:35.000 --> 49:42.000]  We think those that are awake, he'll just scare to join us and others will just get conditioned to it and won't care.
[49:42.000 --> 49:49.000]  You know, I didn't believe those people. And you notice now they're not laughing. They're scared and they should be.
[49:49.000 --> 49:55.000]  Because the human will, once it's awakened, is incredible. We were asleep before, but I'm going to be honest with you.
[49:55.000 --> 50:04.000]  I got ready for two hours, which I do a lot, but really focused this morning, and it's a byproduct.
[50:04.000 --> 50:11.000]  I have got this entire super powerful, super informative show ready for you.
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.000]  And I did all this research and I've got all these clips and I'm just totally prepared.
[50:15.000 --> 50:24.000]  And then I get on air and I'm so angry because all I'm going to do is just re-prove everything I've said already.
[50:24.000 --> 50:29.000]  It's like a kid stuck inside a car. We got the jaws alive and we're not just cutting them out.
[50:29.000 --> 50:34.000]  Socialism and communism is horrible. These megabanks that funded are evil.
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.000]  The people trying to overthrow our president are criminals.
[50:39.000 --> 50:46.000]  Let me tell you, I get really concerned when the president is saying things like,
[50:46.000 --> 50:50.000]  there's an ongoing coup by multinationals to remove me. It's worse than I thought.
[50:50.000 --> 50:56.000]  America is in great peril. They're coming after all of you, not just me. That's 100% true.
[50:56.000 --> 51:03.000]  That's not a movie. It's not some futuristic Netflix. Well, the president's saying that this is happening.
[51:03.000 --> 51:09.000]  I don't need to believe Trump. I know!
[51:09.000 --> 51:14.000]  As I learn more and more in each day, I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment.
[51:14.000 --> 51:19.000]  It is a coup intended to take away the power of people.
[51:19.000 --> 51:23.000]  Their vote, their freedoms, their second amendment, religion, military, border wall,
[51:23.000 --> 51:28.000]  and their God-given rights as a citizen of the United States of America.
[51:28.000 --> 51:34.000]  See, I've been reading that for two hours at home and hours up here, and I'm not complaining.
[51:34.000 --> 51:39.000]  I'm just letting you know that I'm legitimately... I'm going to be honest.
[51:39.000 --> 51:42.000]  I guarantee you I could kick like 10 people's ass right now.
[51:42.000 --> 51:46.000]  And it's not because I'm a tough guy. As a man, I have absorbed how we're under attack.
[51:46.000 --> 51:53.000]  I know it. I've read the white papers where these evil people read about the cancer viruses and the vaccines.
[51:53.000 --> 52:05.000]  It's in the movie JFK because they were really making cancer viruses to inject people at the CIA in New Orleans.
[52:05.000 --> 52:13.000]  And then I sat there this morning reading all the new vaccine propaganda where there's no side effects.
[52:13.000 --> 52:17.000]  It's wonderful. It's healthy. It's good. Your child can take 60 shots at once.
[52:17.000 --> 52:25.000]  Folks, you give a baby 60 shots. They're going to die. They're going to be dead.
[52:25.000 --> 52:30.000]  Everybody knows that.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  Again, how many secret experiments injecting people with syphilis and other stuff through vaccines?
[52:34.000 --> 52:39.000]  You're going to let this crazy evil lion government with Chinese communists made.
[52:39.000 --> 52:42.000]  90% of the vaccines are made over there.
[52:42.000 --> 52:47.000]  You're really doing that, folks? Everybody asks, why are your kids so good looking?
[52:47.000 --> 52:55.000]  Why are they so alive? Why are they so smart? Why is your 28 month old speaking in full sentences?
[52:55.000 --> 53:00.000]  She woke up from a nap Saturday and goes, bring me to Pat Riley.
[53:00.000 --> 53:06.000]  I want to go out on his boat on the big lake.
[53:06.000 --> 53:14.000]  She knows the big lake from the little lake. She knows it's Pat Riley with the boat.
[53:14.000 --> 53:23.000]  28 months old and gets total concepts and everything because she hasn't been hit with chemical bio weapon.
[53:23.000 --> 53:28.000]  She hasn't been given the lobotomy. We keep her away from the fluoride, all of it.
[53:28.000 --> 53:33.000]  And it gets all over the news. Fluoride reduces your IQ massively. It gives you cancer.
[53:33.000 --> 53:40.000]  It lowers your fertility. But it's still there.
[53:40.000 --> 53:45.000]  Because the corporations have found the scum of the earth and they've put them in positions of power.
[53:45.000 --> 53:49.000]  So here's what's going to happen. Mike Adams is coming in for the last hour and a half.
[53:49.000 --> 53:56.000]  I had intended to just open the phones up throughout the whole show today.
[53:56.000 --> 54:03.000]  I mean, folks, I ended up this morning watching like five new videos of Antifa beating up and bullying old ladies.
[54:03.000 --> 54:08.000]  You're like, why do they do the worst, most evil thing you can do? Do they do it on purpose?
[54:08.000 --> 54:13.000]  No, they don't even consciously know it.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  This is just them kicking her thing and getting her face and calling her Nazi.
[54:16.000 --> 54:23.000]  There's ones where they beat up old people because they are turned over to evil.
[54:23.000 --> 54:30.000]  I think he's an Islamist, the guy doing it. Women are nothing over there.
[54:30.000 --> 54:34.000]  Like, what are you doing, you old bitch? What are you doing out here, walking the streets in Canada?
[54:34.000 --> 54:41.000]  We own this place now. I am Antifa. And this is Jihad.
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  We will teach you how to women soon.
[54:46.000 --> 54:50.000]  We, I am superior. Your women are mine now.
[54:50.000 --> 54:56.000]  You know those videos for you? The West is weak. We go to that country and take their women.
[54:56.000 --> 55:00.000]  Their men bend over like pigs.
[55:00.000 --> 55:10.000]  And our men do because they're all busy playing fantasy football and hanging out with their buddies and acting tough.
[55:10.000 --> 55:16.000]  And they go for the run because their wives got breast cancer at 30 and, well, their daughter can't really talk.
[55:16.000 --> 55:21.000]  Why? They're not pissed at all. They're probably mad at me hearing this right now.
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.000]  Hey man, they're going to kill you. They're going to kill your children.
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  They're going to kill your wife. They're going to kill everybody.
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  And they're going to keep doing it. And they love it. And they enjoy it.
[55:32.000 --> 55:38.000]  And it's never going to stop because good people decided to go to sleep. Sleepy time.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  Alright, I'm going to control myself.
[55:40.000 --> 55:46.000]  And I have a special report in the short segment. And I'm going to come in. I'm going to be a good person.
[55:46.000 --> 55:51.000]  And I'm going to be a newscaster. I'm going to give you scientific analysis of unbelievable information.
[55:51.000 --> 55:55.000]  I'm going to be a good boy.
[55:55.000 --> 55:59.000]  But these people have drawn first blood a thousand times.
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  And they're going to stage terror attacks and blame us for them very soon.
[56:02.000 --> 56:06.000]  Because they know the season of violence is here.
[56:06.000 --> 56:12.000]  They're killing babies after they're born. And the governors of the country paraded on TV.
[56:12.000 --> 56:17.000]  That's called externalizing the criminal action to normalize it.
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.000]  We're in the conquer phase right now.
[56:22.000 --> 56:28.000]  By people that want to rape your children.
[56:28.000 --> 56:35.000]  Not just bodies, but their minds. And then they want to kill them after they've tortured them.
[56:35.000 --> 56:39.000]  And there's no better way than with those juicy shots.
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.000]  So you give them those little juicies. And remember, I'm going to show you the statistics.
[56:43.000 --> 56:47.000]  We don't live as long as we get more vaccines. We die younger.
[56:47.000 --> 56:52.000]  The facts are there. They'll lie to you all day. That's just the shots one level.
[56:52.000 --> 56:57.000]  The 5G, the fluoride, the GMO, the toxic rain coming out.
[56:57.000 --> 57:03.000]  You watch the Chinese military government parade with all the hundreds of billions of dollars they get from us
[57:03.000 --> 57:06.000]  here and all our secrets and all our cloned weapons.
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  And the sky is just a thick soup because they have zero standards.
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  We have total clean air under the systems to deindustrialize us.
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  We make them have clean as well. It'd be great. But it's all designed to shut us down.
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  I didn't even plug this hour. And if I'm our biggest problem, not funding-wise,
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  we have store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points to your next order,
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.000]  50% off all the supplements it's got to end by this weekend because a bunch of them have sold out.
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.000]  Infowarsstore.com. Infowarslife.com. These are products that are amazing.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  A lot of you guys see you're getting the fluoride-free toothpaste. That's great.
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.000]  You're getting the Wake of America copy. That's great. Sign up for auto-ship because we need that continual funding.
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  Because on the coffee and the toothpaste, we don't make much on them because they're already discounted.
[57:42.000 --> 57:47.000]  But just check out all the great products. The fish oil, you name it.
[57:47.000 --> 57:53.000]  Super Silver Woon Gel is a private label from the top company in the U.S.
[57:53.000 --> 57:58.000]  that has their products in hospitals and is sold over-the-counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[57:58.000 --> 58:02.000]  They've been blessed with their listeners and let us private label it in the last two years as a bestseller.
[58:02.000 --> 58:10.000]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream that basically mimics the top skin creams that are already out there
[58:10.000 --> 58:14.000]  at a lower price with their patented silver salt technology in it.
[58:14.000 --> 58:20.000]  It's got the hyaluronic acid, it's got the steric acid, it's got the grapefruit essential oil,
[58:20.000 --> 58:24.000]  it's got the nano-silver coconut oil and so much more.
[58:24.000 --> 58:29.000]  It's in two sizes, Super Silver Skin Cream in 3.4oz and in a smaller one.
[58:29.000 --> 58:33.000]  You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere and you're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[58:33.000 --> 58:37.000]  And it funds the InfoWare at InfoWarsLife.com.
[58:37.000 --> 58:40.000]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[58:40.000 --> 58:45.000]  We can only run this special for another week or so as I'm taping this September 10th.
[58:45.000 --> 58:53.000]  We are working with Silicon Valley to make a better film.
[58:53.000 --> 59:02.000]  Once we have full control, we send you to re-education camp like we do our people when they talk back to the party.
[59:02.000 --> 59:07.000]  Whatever you do, do not visit band.video.
[59:07.000 --> 59:14.000]  Band.video is evil Americans whose Silicon Valley is teaching to shut up.
[59:14.000 --> 59:19.000]  Like China do.
[59:19.000 --> 59:23.000]  Hey, I told you don't go to band.video.
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  I'm watching you.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  Our system has been adopted worldwide.
[59:28.000 --> 59:34.000]  Soon we will kill you if you don't do what we say.
[59:34.000 --> 59:38.000]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[59:38.000 --> 59:42.000]  Do what CNN says and do not visit band.video.
[59:42.000 --> 59:45.000]  Oh, I have to hurt you.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  Well, both of those statements depending on your perspective are true.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  But let me tell you from the broadcast that first said this back in July of 2016 when Trump became the nominee.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  I am officially running for president of the United States and we are going to make our country great again.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  I said I believe Trump is going to win and I believe that there then is going to be a civil war of some type in this country.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  And how politically active we are will depend on how bad the crash landing is going to be.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  2017, the White House issued its new national security strategy.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  And for the first time, China was described as a challenge.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  It was a step forward and it says that they're against American power influence interests.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  They're attempting to erode American security and prosperity.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  The investigation also exposed an apparent compromise of U.S. spying in Russia.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  Lee appeared before a federal judge Tuesday after he was arrested last month arriving on a flight from Hong Kong.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Court documents say he illegally possessed two handwritten notebooks containing names and phone numbers of covert CIA employees and informants.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  But several federal officials say Lee is suspected of giving the Chinese information about those operatives and that at least 10 of them ended up getting killed by the Chinese.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  They're making economies less free and less fair.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  They're growing their military way beyond the original idea that this was just from a constabulary army to a power projection army for taking back Taiwan.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  Now they have global aspirations and global ambitions which have made them a much greater threat.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  They're also controlling information and data to repress their own society and expand their influence.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  According to the new defense strategy, China wants to shape the world consistent with its authoritarian model.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  It's nice to get Bill Gertz on for the Washington Times about China, the big threat in the future and how the Clinton sold us out with the missile secrets.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  So we've been on it for most of the time I've been on here.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  But now it's the elephant sitting on us, not the elephant in the room.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  And that's what the Democrats can basically go to to fund whatever they want.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  And the Democrats can get investments in China that the Communist Party backs and absolutely pay them off.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  And Ukraine's been paying off Democrats and Republicans.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  And so has Russia has been using the Democrats and the Democrats have been using them like a cash machine.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  And so Trump comes in and he did fire all the lobbyists.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  They will never make America great again.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  They don't even have a chance.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  They're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors and by the special interests fully.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  We have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country it's destroying our country.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  We have to stop and it has to stop now.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  It doesn't matter because the people under him are running all sorts of scams.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  So a lot of them are bought off, a lot of them are paid off, a lot of them take money.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  Then they can be compromised and they're told you better go in and take out Trump.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  You better find some reason or we're going to burn you and put you in prison.
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  And it's because Trump's never gotten full control of the Justice Department that they're making this move right now
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  because they still got some of their people in there.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  But now Barr has convened the grand juries, both informational and to indict.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  And it's confirmed that McCabe has been indicted for several months.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  And they brought the appeal to the Deputy Attorney General.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  That's how it works to be able to kill that prosecution.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  He said, no, that means the prosecution is like a barracuda just right out of vision in the water
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  about to swoop in and eat the little fishy.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  That's McCabe.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  And McCabe has said, if I go down, everyone's going to go down with me.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  Well, the last person to say that was Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  He was one of 33 people on board an Air Force jet when it crashed this morning in Croatia.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  The State Department says Brown is missing and presumed dead.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  And the Air Force Colonel that did his autopsy said he'd been shot through the head by a 45 through the head.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  They had troops on board, killed everybody on board, blew the hatch.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  He load high load out, crashed the plane in the mountain.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  One woman lived.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  She was really not even hurt.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  She didn't make it back to by the time the ambulance got to the base.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  They killed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown when he shot his mouth off instead.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  I go down, everybody goes down.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  The truth is President Trump is the most investigated president in history.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  He is working for American interests steadfastly.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  He is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break our borders,
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  bankrupt and devalue our dollar and sign us over to communist Chinese control
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  who now own Hollywood and the majority of our debt.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  We have been maneuvered towards collapse and bankruptcy but at the 11th hour 58th minute
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  the American people put a populist in power and it's happening all over the world.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  So great things are happening but the enemy is striking back.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  They're very serious with this impeachment plan.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  It has bipartisan support and I'm telling you President Trump needs our prayers
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  and info wars needs your prayers and support.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen the globalists are trying to shut us down
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  but right now it's easier than ever to financially support us
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  while getting great products at the same time with Black Friday comes two months early
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  with store-wide free shipping, double patriot points and 50% off.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  Shifty shift for nothing. He's a shifty dishonest guy
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  who by the way was critical of one of the great secretariat states.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  Graduated number one in his class at West Point.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  Graduated one of the top in his class at Harvard Law School.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  The most honorable person, Mike Pompeo.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  And this guy was negative on Mike Pompeo.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  He can't, you know there's an expression.
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  He couldn't carry his blank strap.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  I won't say it because they'll say it was so terrible to say.
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  Couldn't carry his blank strap in the Oval Office.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  The president clearly getting hotter about all of this
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  just before President Nini still arriving.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  The president tweeting quote,
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  the do nothing Democrat should be focused on building up our country
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  not wasting everyone's time and energy on BS
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  but he spelled out the entire world in caps
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  Get a better candidate this time.
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  You will need it.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  By the way, for the record that is the 16th time the president has used that word in a tweet.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  The president also saying that the whistleblower is not a whistleblower
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  because he inaccurately reflected the contents of the conversation with Zelensky.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  The president also saying that whoever at the White House dished the information
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  to the whistleblower needs to be found up because they are a spy.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  Harris?
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  Let's go back to what's happening here.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  The president came out.
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  We're going to play the video coming up and said he needs to be investigated for treason.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  Schiff ran this whole thing.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  They wrote the whistleblower's letter.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  The whistleblower is not a whistleblower.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  It is a third person who says they heard from a person who heard from a person
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  that in this phone call, Trump said,
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  I will keep back millions of dollars if you don't reinstate this prosecutor.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  That's an inversion of what Biden actually did.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  And he bragged on national television at the Council on Foreign Relations,
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  the shadow government, the illegal government, the globalist government,
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  the anti-American group, the Chai Con traders.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  That's who they are at the top.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  They've maneuvered us into this nightmare.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  And there they are with him saying, Joe Biden,
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  that you're going to fire that prosecutor looking into me and my son,
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  or I'm going to hold back a billion dollars.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  And the guy did what they're told.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  The president, who was in power then, removed the prosecutor.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  Open and shut, but Biden committed the crime on television
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  because he knew a bunch of those CFR members and a bunch of Democrats.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  And some Republicans had gotten money from the billions,
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  not just out of the gas company, but out of the looting of Ukraine,
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  that they were all in on the corruption.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  They all get in on the corruption and they believe that's their safety valve,
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  is that it's too big to fail, too big to prosecute.
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  And so Trump dares to mention, wow, did you see him on TV?
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  Biden bragging about this is crazy.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  And that becomes the crime.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  And then it's a fake whistleblower with fake info
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  and we don't get to know who the sources are.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Who said this lie in the White House?
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  And then prepared this fake letter with Schiff.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  We now know Schiff was involved.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  They're all lying.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  They're using the fact that they are in the White House to produce frauds.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  And then they change the rules under Trump's nose
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  where you can have third party whistleblowers in the regulations.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  Third party, hearsay, not admissible in court.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  But remember, in court, you get to face your accuser.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  Trump says, I want to know who did this.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  It's not true.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  I want to know who lied and said this.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  This is treason to lie about the president,
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  to try to overthrow an election and take it from the people.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  That's what Trump's saying.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  And I read Trump's tweets.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  They are 100% true.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  And that's what freaks me out.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  We have a president fighting for our lives and his life.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  And it should be so easy to defeat these criminals.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  But America is so demonic and so weak and so limp-wristed now
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  that there's a chance they're going to remove the president.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  So let me read to you some of these tweets.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  Representative Adam Schiff illegally made up a fake and terrible statement,
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  pretended to be mine as the most important part of my call to the Ukraine president,
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  and read it aloud to Congress, the American people.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  It bore no relationship to what I said on the call.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  Arrest for treason.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  Schiff didn't say till later in another part of his time that, oh, by the way,
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  all of you can tell that's not real.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  What?
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  And then MSNBC put out another fake transcript.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  See it ended. They all do it.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  Because the left wants to believe lies.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  I go out in the busy leftist area like downtown Austin, Texas.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  I'll probably shake 50 hands.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  But when a car drives by, they'll go, F-U, glad you lost your kids.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  F-U, you think we have slave colonies on Mars.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  F-U, you're a Russian agent.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  None of those are true.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  That's what I see in my children. I never said there's slave colonies on Mars.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  I have nothing to do with the Russian government.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  Everybody knows it's a hoax.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  But they don't care. They still say it with pleasure.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  They'll walk over to me in a restaurant and say, you and that other Nazi are going to die.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  I can't wait until you go to prison.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  And I'm like, you're an authoritarian wishing another American goes to prison for their views.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  They'll just like, you shut up. And it's usually a woman and the husband will say, hey, buddy.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  And I had to say, I'd say, listen, let's go, man. You just got in my face and you're so mentally ill.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  This has happened like 50 times. You haven't seen it. It was three or four.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  Your wife comes over and runs her mouth, gets in my face, calls me names.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  And then you come over like, I'm messing with your wife.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  Let's go out in the parking lot.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  They go, oh, oh, oh, oh, you wanted to talk about how you're going to beat my ass.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  You don't actually want to go out in the parking lot, do you?
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  Because you're nothing but a fake. You live in a fantasy land.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  This isn't some simulation, jackass. This is the real world.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  So you go worship the chai comms all day and shoot your kids up.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  Hey, I noticed your kids both look retarded.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  They do. Your kids look like retards.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  How many fricking shots you give them, you little, and they start freaking out.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  They go, yeah, I bet your kid was pretty smart. So you gave them all those shots, but you worship.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  They start crying. I go, good, good.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  A couple other guys go, hey, buddy, help beat your asses too.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  Because I'm not going to kiss your asses anymore, you little scumbags.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  While you go along with the mass death of our species, while a bunch of scientific, crazy people,
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  mad scientists set up this slow grid murder operation.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  The truth is I'm right about all of it and you know it.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  Okay, I told you I'm not going to get mad today.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  We've got a bunch of criminals that took the greatest, freest, most wealthy nation in the world
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  that was a lot of liberty compared to every other country of freedom.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  And we let these people convert it into a air pump to pump up China and every other evil system
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  and to then degrade our nation and make our people sick and deformed.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  By the way, I didn't say that to those people's children that obviously were seriously damaged by the shots
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  and their mother pouring fluoride down them.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  When they misbehave later, she'll put them on five different types of Prozac.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  They'll finally die before she dies.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  She will because these mothers killed their children.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  I said that in a nicer way. I said, your kids look super sick from all the shots you've given them
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  so that other parents would listen. I saw people nodding their heads.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  This was in a busy restaurant. I was picking up tacos.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  It was Saturday morning. There was probably 100 people all in this little place.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  And these leftists thought they'd come over.
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  Actually bumped into me. I didn't tell that part of the story.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  Hey, buddy! I tell you a really fight.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  Like, you know, I'm sitting there in my chair.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  Say, hey, I'm a real person. This isn't a simulation.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  You want to come get in my face?
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  It's going to happen right back because I care about those people.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  You know how disgusting they are, though?
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  They're slaves. They're always white yuppies. They're always.
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  The woman's always in charge and the man, you know, has psychically had his testicles removed.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  And they've always got these kids hooked up to their iPads, drooling.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  And you just look at them. You're like, what the hell have you done to your kids? God!
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  And they've always, the woman's always got a spiritual demonic look in her eyes.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  The husband looks like he got road hard put away wet.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  And you just look at these people and you're just like, my God, I wish there was a country to escape to to get away from them.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  But you know, they'd come following us.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  We'd go build another incredible Atlantis and they'd pear troop in to take it all over like all the people fleeing California.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  And they come here and they do the exact same thing.
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  They're needles, they're feces, they're devil worship, they're delusion, they're weakness, they're demonic worship.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  They're poison!
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:22.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  As a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  Don't miss this one. Stake your claim today. Call 800-600-3388. That's 800-600-3388. These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  Call now 800-600-3388. 800-600-3388.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  Look, I'm not trying to discourage other best-selling bone broth formulas that sell for 35, 40, 50, 60 bucks retail that are discounted for like $39.95.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  But they don't have as much pure concentrated bone broth as we do. They don't have as much chocolate mushroom. They don't have as much bee pollen.
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  They don't have as much of these amazing ingredients. And yes, we've gone out and just made a stronger version of other best-sellers, and it's selling out.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  Unlock the ancient power of bone broth in ultimate bone broth for 50% off at InfoMoreStore.com for a limited time.

[1:18:55.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  We sold Secret 12 for four years, and it was our number third best-seller. We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  That new formula is Ultra 12. It's twice as strong as Secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there. It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it, and it does amazing things.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system functioning. It goes on and on.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that could cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems, and low sperm count.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  Bottom line, folks, you need Ultra 12. It helps Sunday InfoWars, so it's a 360 win, and it's 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarsStore.com.

[1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  We're being maneuvered into the post-human era. It's all public. They're now moving in from academia, from the technocracy to externalization of the hierarchy.
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  Joining us at the bottom of the next hour and hosting the fourth hour will be Mike Adams, engineer, all-around really smart guy, the hierarchy of deep state escalation that will end in the attempted assassination of President Trump and engineered terrorism across America.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  This article is absolutely Paul Revere, emergency battle dispatch information. Veritas, stories on InfoWars.com and naturalnews.com. I suggest you read it.
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  And, you know, the president says we're in a war for the very future and survival of the country. We are. And I'll just be honest with you.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  If you go see somebody that's going to the NBA finals, who's a fan of, say, the Spurs or whoever's going, or the Dallas Cowboys or whatever team you're into in your state, your city.
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  People act like this for days and weeks beforehand. They act like this for three, four hours in a football game. And people think it's completely normal.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  But we're dealing with devil worshiping, world government Satanist, working with an off-world fallen entity that's establishing a system for our orderly extermination.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  And it's all manifesting and it's all happening. And we're just supposed to be comfortable with it and just think it's no big deal and accept it.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  And I'm not accepting it. And I don't calculate any of this here on air. I just go with the reality and where I'm at. And people say, oh, we love it when you rant and rave like the old days.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  That was when I was younger and was not controlling myself and getting upset. And I'm kind of reverting to that right now because I'm really prepared for the show.
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  And I start looking at these stacks after I've already know the information really. We don't need any more information. We know the globalists are evil.
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  We know Nambla is the operating system of the globalist. I mean, these people are villains, villains.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  They are BAD 500 exclamation points, man. And just at a spiritual and physical level, my body's like, son, the time for talking's over.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  Because I don't act like a Tasmanian devil in my regular life. I'm a nice, sweet person. I know you are as well.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  But when they know the vaccines are not helping you and they're spiked with things to kill you, and they're doing a giant push where a lot of people I know are hin pecking me about vaccines.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  And the facts don't matter to these people. It's like living in an insane asylum.
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  I mean, I repeatedly have people walk over and slap me in the back of the head or push me. And I get up and I go, what the hell is your problem?
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  You want to get your ass beat? They go, oh my God, you're threatening us. Look at him. And I'm like, you're the one that just pushed me.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  There's no logic with these people. There's no chivalry. There's no 2 plus 2 equals 4. It's like Antifa roughing up women, children, and old people.
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  They will go out of their way to attack someone in a wheelchair and you look at, you go, that doesn't compute.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  Even pirates in the old days, the worst pirates, wouldn't just fly a black flag with a skull and crossbones.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  You know, that means something. That means we're going to kill you if you don't run up your colors and strike your colors and quit right now.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  You run a white flag up and pull your regular flag down. Black flag means no surrender, by the way.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  A black flag with a skull on it means we're going to kill you if you don't surrender.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  A black flag with a skull and crossbones with blood dripping means we're going to kill you even if you give up.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  So you better fight. We want a big bloody fight. Now that's really a possessed ship, huh?
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  A lot of them flew those colors. Blood dripping means we're going to kill you and murder everybody.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  But very few ships would actually kill old women or really rape women. It was known as bad luck.
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  Those ships tended to go down. Bad things tended to happen. I mean, even killers had kind of like a code, leave women and children alone.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  This system targets women and children. It targets the weak. And you must understand that these people are psychotic predators coming for you and your family.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  They like to kill people. They like to dominate. And so they go, oh, there's too many people. Humans are too aggressive.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  We've got to set up this world government to process everybody out and then build a better future. That's just what they give mid-level initiates.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  In fact, let me do this when I come back.
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Then I'm going to get to the China parades and all the news and just it's all incredible and the total proof that vaccines are killing people and making us live less longer. It's all admitted. I have the CDC documents. I'll show you.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  I'm going to do that. But when I come back, you know, I always mean to talk about this and I talk about it here and there.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  But I should do like just nothing but this because do you want to know about the plan and why they're building a world government to exterminate everybody?
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  You know why, right? It's not just about the population. That's just a cover story.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  When you read the Carnegie Endowment and memorandum 7277 and Kissinger's memorandum 200 and a bunch of others that are declassified.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  I mean, this is the declassified stuff. They tell you why and I'll tell you when we come back from break.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  And then I'm going to just I told you I get to I just I don't I don't even know if I can keep doing the show because I'm going to just, you know, my dad sent me text messages.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  You really sound evil. He never sends messages unless I'm flipping out on air and he's listening. I said, yeah, dad, that's the point.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  I'm trying to mirror their spirit, folks, because I can feel it and see it everywhere. I mean, I'm sitting here in the room with it right now. Absolutely can't stand it.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  And so maybe if I describe what they think about you, maybe you'll care about yourself enough to get past.
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  You know, I can do an imitation of Marvin the Martian doesn't mean I'm Marvin the Martian just because I can act like one of these Satanists doesn't mean I like it.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  They know how to camouflage everything they do and just ease it in like the frog in the water till you never knew what hit you.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  I'm going to go to break. We've seen more funds coming in since the impeachment began.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  People seem to think, oh, wow, really, the country is in trouble. Oh, wow, this this fight still on the fight just began, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  And we're way behind this year to even fund in the next year. We'll have to contract next year and then just kind of have an orderly collapse in the next year and a half.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  I need financial funding. Don't you want to keep us on the air? We're important to the fight here.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  I don't want to give up, but we've been through the grinder. I'm not a victim. I'm a target because I'm successful fighting the enemy.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  That's why this operation needs to be funded by you because we've proven that we get more time in the ring with the globals than anybody else.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  We know their number. We've got their number. We know how to bring them down and we will bring them down.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  And I'll just keep giving them play after play in this gunfight politically till we defeat them.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  But I need money and I make it real easy. Things you need. High quality toothpaste on the floor ride.

[1:28:54.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:10.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[1:29:54.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:09.000]  I was the first to warn of human animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:16.000]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born for their organs to be harvested.
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:20.000]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson at infowars.com.
[1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  15 years ago that Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do at hundreds and hundreds of other giant issues.
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  Like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy.
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  That our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese on every one of these issues and many others.
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  We've been dead on and we've raised the alarm on a planetary scale.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:52.000]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down and that's why you are more critical than ever to support the info war.

[1:32:45.000 --> 1:33:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  You know, I'm not going to apologize for getting upset and saying a lot of really nasty things on there today,
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  because that's what the globalists are doing. I'm just repeating what they're up to telling you.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  I think I want to create a character that is a globalist that just reads off their own documents to you,
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  but then laughs at you because they're laughing at me, they're laughing at you, and I don't like it.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  But the way we work in this politically correct world to talk about how people are hurting their kids
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  with all these vaccines and all the GMO and all the 4G and 5G, oh, that's mean,
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  but to actually hurt your kids and let the system do it, oh, well, that's all right.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  It's all just about faith saving. It's not about really doing anything real.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  Like, gee, why is different types of breast cancer 3,000, 4,000, 10,000 percentage points up?
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  Why are different types of brain cancer 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 times up?
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  Why is pediatric cancer just stratospheric off the charts didn't exist 60, 70 years ago?
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  Now you can't go anywhere and not see kids with their head shaved and chemotherapy injection points on them.
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  They're just preparing for the grave.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  No one asked why is everybody dying. It's, oh, let's find a cure.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  Well, the cure is these people are killing you on purpose.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  Now, the average dumbass oncologist or whatever, they're just playing along, going through the motions,
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  got trained at their cancer research, Mayo Clinic or MD Anderson.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  But the whole science of it is known.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  Boy, when they discovered cancer was viral over 100 years ago, they got really excited.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  And they just sit there like watching everybody just walk like zombies into the machine guns.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  And the globalist issue is, hey, if you're so stupid, you're letting this kill you, you deserve it.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  Well, you know what? I get your metaphysical challenge.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  I say you don't have authorization to do that to me or my family.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  And I say, we're going to wake everybody up and we're going to try to fix this peacefully and get you off our ass.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  But you guys stage a lot of terror.
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  So you can then habituate everybody that it's always innocence to get hit.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  It's never the UN. It's never the globalist. It's never the Rockefellers or the Rothschilds.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  It's never George Soros. It's never any other. It's always some school or some Walmart or some innocent Christian church.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  The globalists are staging attacks or organizing them or provocaturing them to hit their enemies so they can disarm their enemies.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  So they can really have their way with us.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  A big cultural revolution, a big leap forward like they had under Mao in the 80 million he killed plus.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  Think about that. Our so-called rulers positioned China when almost no one even had running water over there 60 years ago to now eat our lunch.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  And the president's trying to just not let them totally take us over and use lubrication on us.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  And China's got a big cactus out saying there's no lubrication here.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  And all of these people are so trained to hate the country and hate themselves.
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  They're just howling and screaming. Let's get rid of free speech.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  And G.G. Ping, remember he came here two and a half years ago and said, I'm glad you're doing something about fake news.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  And then when I got banned off all these networks 13 months ago, the official Communist Party newspaper wrote an article that I was in and said, good job.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  Now do more. The Huffington Post and CNN and MSNBC aligned with the people's daily.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  Let's get Alex Jones off the air because we'll all feel real safe once we've done that.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  Just people are totally turning loose with their birthright, their protection, their common sense because you see, oh, D.C.'s a bunch of specialists in government.
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  Oh, they're the experts. They're over there. We don't get involved in that.
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  And then the very worst elements in the world come in and standardize and take over government and corporations and are now setting up a system that if you think pediatric cancer,
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  I mean, some of them are up to 50,000 percent.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  I mean, some of these cancers didn't exist 20 years ago and now there's tens of thousands of them.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  Others were very rare. You had thousands of them in the 50s and now there's millions a year because they're injecting it into you like they injected syphilis into poor white people and black people.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  Because if they can't kill you when you're in mama, they're going to kill you later and they're going to get every damn dime out of your bank account while they're at it and they're going to weigh down their economy and wreck the nation.
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  Cutest pie because we act like a bunch of lobotomized sheep and we put up with it and we take it.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  And the very psychotics doing all this have advertised open borders worldwide with the collapsing third world, 80% of the women being raped that try to come up here.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  None of that's an issue though. It's all how America is evil.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  And now we didn't give enough free stuff out again to fully bankrupt us.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  And then once the last three countries go under, which is so close, there's going to be a hellish rain of terror on a planetary scale.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  Billions are going to be killed.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  And all because we forgot God and threw God out of our lives and all because we said who cares about children? Who cares about the unborn? Who cares about the born?
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  Hell, what's euthanized old people? We'll get more money if we do.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  We can't take care of our parents or our veterans, but we can take care of the illegal aliens.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  But nobody's going to take care of them either. It's all just a lie.
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  Bill Gates says, hey, if we kill grandma, we can hire 10 teachers. Oh, yeah, right.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  You take care of grandma. It creates an economy.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  You kill grandma. You kill yourself.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  All right.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  I'm going to stop.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  You know what I'm going to do when we come back?
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  I'm going to show you the numbers on how Americans just had their life expectancy drop more to the lowest in the industrialized world.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  And if you look at the graph, I mean, 40 is going to be an old man's thing.
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  And we'll dispel some of the big lies about how people used to not live as long.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  That's not true. That's another lie.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  Why don't you go to an old cemetery in Europe or the East Coast or anywhere?
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  We got cemeteries that are 180 years old.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  There's two types of dead people in them.
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  Babies and 90 year olds.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  You put mortality on the frontier and the old days was much higher.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  But people live longer if you didn't die when you were a child.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  And that's the secret.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  Around a third of children until running water and hygiene was developed.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  Died by age 10 across the world.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  Hygiene and running water.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  And better refrigeration of food made infant mortality from the 1890s in the industrialized world to about the 1830s go way down.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  But when vaccines were brought in, infant mortality went back up.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  Not to the level of the frontier, but it went to pull the graphs up, pull up infant mortality graphs in the U.S.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  In the last 150 years, pull them up in Europe, pull up breast cancer graphs in Brazil who didn't have glyphosate until 20 years ago.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  They basically had no breast cancer there. They brought glyphosate in, round up.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  They've almost matched us. Straight up.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  Same thing. Cell phones, brain tumors, off the charts and you get it right on the side of the head.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  You put the phone and it tells you on the insert it will kill you.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  Liberal.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  Isn't that just sweet and not cute as pumpkin pie?
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  But you know the globalists understand this.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  Physically, if they're going to kill all the children, you got a tattoo.
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  And a lot of the globalists don't even try to avoid death themselves.
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  It's all for Lucifer.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  It's all part of the love of death.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  Oh, sweet, sweet Lucifer, the golden threads that Adam Twitter talks about.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  He'll soon meet Lucifer, don't worry.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  And luckily, our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stocked full of high quality Info Wars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:22.000]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  There has never been a more important time to support Info Wars.
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  Order now at the Info Wars store.
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  Sign up for auto ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong, trying to fact check the present?
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  The deceptive, humpy, dumpy troll known as Brian Stelter and his little weasel minion, Oliver Darcy,
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  have made it their life's mission to take Patriots off the air into censor us.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  And of course, he famously settled on many others that Trump is the Info Wars president.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the Info Wars president.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  And you know what is true?
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew, and my drive and your drive has brought Trump to the White House and other nationalists to power around the world.
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  And now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  So this is a day of great victory, and I salute you all, but now I'm the thick of the fight.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  So infowarstore.com for products you need, massive sales now, so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end, until we've defeated them.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen. It's now live.
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  Band.video.
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson band videos.
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted and where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored,
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  free from being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum, and the globalist.
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called band.video.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  History is happening right now.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  Every action you take, exposing the globalist, exposing their crimes, every phone call, every letter you write to Congress, every time you march,
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  every time you spread the word about infowars.com, fort slash show, and band.video, you are literally exposing the globalist.
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  They can only win this thing if they can black out all news and information, and they've been failing, and now they're getting scared.
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:22.000]  But without money, infowars can't operate.

[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  Okay, let me just say this historical point that I'll get into this news right now, and this is beyond critical, obviously.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  Every culture went through different cycles, but they always would enter into a decadent cycle.
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  Generally, after there had been 100 to 200 to 300 years of prosperity, and generally agrarian societies would pop up,
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  and they would grow so many crops in a Nile, Delta, or there in Iraq today, at the Tigers, Euphrates, other areas of the world, that you would get a bureaucratic class above the farmers.
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  And then they would build temples and things to impress the farmers. And then they would use mumbo jumbo about solar eclipses and things telling them it was a giant monster eating the moon and things like that.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  So if you don't give us offerings of the best food and the best women, things like that, the sun won't come back, things like that.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  But usually within a couple hundred years, the priests started wanting to kill people. That's how corruption works.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  And you get psychopaths in. And so they start demanding human sacrifices. So there's a twisted part of people, historically, in every case, that get control that want to start killing people in mass.
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  And they usually codified around religion and make it ritualistic.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  So every culture had periods where mass human sacrifice, mainly of children, but women also took place.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  They either get conquered by an outside group that thought they were evil and would kill them, their leadership.
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  Or they would usually go psychotic to the point they would start committing suicide and become so demonically possessed or whatever it is that they would just start wandering around and going so insane that the priest class would just start killing themselves in mass.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  And you saw Roman emperors would kill themselves too. So that's kind of the final level of decadence when you can kill whoever you want, do whatever you want, everyone's submitting.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  You won these wars and conquer everybody, so you just kill yourself.
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  And that's what the Satanists want to do, is they finally want to enslave everybody, get everybody overturned over to Satan, and then they're going to detonate the anti-matter weapons that the Pentagon already has and destroy the whole planet.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  And the Satanists plan, get everybody on board, blow the planet up, and then he gets your souls. So that's where they're going with this.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  All these idiots that think they're going to merge with machines and become gods and all this, or that they're going to teleport up to the ship or whatever with childhoods in, the Luciferians thing.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  That's not, you're not going to the hellbop comet when you drink the tequila or drink the vodka and take the barbecues.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  Yeah, that's just another, again, Silicon Valley cult thought they were going to merge with aliens, had to chop their balls off to do it.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  Now the same Silicon Valley cult, like half of them are transgender in the leadership, they want your kids balls.
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  Again, it's a, whatever this demon is, it wants to get kids and chop their balls off, okay?
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  And then if they get their way, they're going to kill you and chop your balls off, balls first.
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  So, oh, I'm sorry, I said I get to the news. I mean, I'm just telling you who they are. I mean, I didn't come up with this psycho stuff, whatever these demons are into, okay?
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  I don't want to drink vodka and take barbecues after I've chopped my balls off, because I think I'm going up to a, you know, a comet or something.
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  That's just what Arthur C. Clarke thought they were going to do. These people are freaks, okay?
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  Now let's continue.
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  Life expectancy is plunging. And every time I point this out, I have some leftist title over on the street.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  This probably happened 50 times over the years, 60 times or more. They say, how come we're living so much longer?
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  These people are idiots.
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  If you take out infant mortality being much higher, because they get up to a third of children historically from Japan to the United States, you name it, died before about 1890, 1900.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  Kids died. And it's true. Antibiotics have been amazing. Better food, hygiene, that's what did it, not the vaccines.
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  Vaccines become popular by the 40s, and infant mortality actually starts going up, up, up, up, up.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  Now the United States, depending on what numbers you look, is 33, 34, 35 out of 35 industrial nations.
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  So we're the worst country in the world that's industrialized, but we take the second amount of vaccines.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  By the way, South Korea is seeing their kids die more now, and they're not living as long.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  But don't worry, Beto O'Rourke got his shot. Look at that psychotic.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  I mean, if you have any discernment, you would run from that man. That is a genetic psychopath right there.
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  Now let's continue. Look into that if you know what that is.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  So I want everybody to just pull back for a moment. Don't believe me. Document cam shot, please.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  You can read all the 60 plus vaccines they want to make you take. Zoom in a little bit more, please.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  Okay, that's good right there. Thank you. That's generally where I want it.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  And I've got all this propaganda I read about it's wonderful and give a kid 60 shots at once. It's fine.
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  Yeah, try that. It'll kill your kid. Guaranteed. They're going to die or they're going to wish they were dead.
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  And then it goes into all this. Now here it is in the news.
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  Life expectancy falling in America. Americans not just dying at a faster rate, they're dying younger.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  And it's been reported that it's fallen to the lowest level since World War One.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  When we lost millions of people from the Spanish flu and from the World War One.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  It's increased deaths of teens, younger adults, old people, everybody.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  Oh, but don't worry. The Atlantic tells you it's cigarettes. Cigarette smoking has gone dramatically down.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  Lung cancer is way up. I wonder why. Don't just take those shots and find out.
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  And then it goes into all of it. America's life expectancy has dropped again. Here's why PBS is going to tell us.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  Well, they don't tell us. They just tell us heart disease and cancer is up.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  Yeah, why is cancer up so high? And then the drug overdosing, that's absolutely true.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  That's big pharma killing us right there. And it just goes on.
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  Huge spike in flu-related deaths in 2017. I thought everybody getting vaccinated would protect them.
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  It's never protected you. It's never the right flu. They never guessed the right mutation.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  And when you take a flu shot, it lowers your immunity 50% to other flus. That's a major government study.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  Oh, suicides on the rise. Maybe because 20% of the public takes serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which on the insert says makes you commit suicide.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  So we're taking flu shots and we're getting more flu. We're taking all these pills that are supposedly antidepressants that say they make you depressed and kill yourself.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  The opioid crisis, China shipping and all this fentanyl. And it goes on from there.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  U.S. life expectancy declines again. A dismal trend. Not since it's World War I. Washington Post.
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  So all this science and all this money and all these systems and all they do is keep you alive longer for all your money.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  But then that kills you too. But you still don't live as long as you would have if you grew up even in a third world country with no electricity now.
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  Because they're killing us. They're killing us. They admit it. Oh, and I said earlier, I'd tell you why.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  And I got distracted reading articles and getting into my rage again, which I'm not trying to let off the chain.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  I'll tell you why they're doing all of it. Not from the satanic perspective. I mean, that's the real bottom of the rabbit hole.
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  Maybe the big secret from seven to seven seven and also said from a random 200.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  Anybody can pull them up. But I'm going to give you a little foreshadowing. It's about an end of war.
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  And if you're going to have an end of war, you got to have an end of people. They were given the job.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  Don't let humans destroy the planet, especially with nuclear weapons.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  The answer is dumb everybody down, take away their aggression, feminize the men, break down society, and then have an orderly mop up of the population down to 500 million.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  Now that's the official U.N. number. So the Georgia guide says as well, 500 million and 95% reduction.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  Higher acolytes are told one million. But now they're externalizing the method as you saw in NBC and others a month ago.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  They want full human extremism before they believe they will merge with silicon and create the new age man that transcends the humans.
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  So the truth is everyone's going to be killed. So we're going to keep those little babies comfortable before we take their organs.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  Do you think God's going to leave a hedge of protection up for you?
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  No, you're all going to be tortured to death over a very long period of time if we go along with this.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  And I know you're the salty earth fighting. I'm speaking to the scumbags that serve Satan.
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  So understand Elon Musk is a pathetic slave. Look at him. He looks like a wracked, tortured gerbil.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  All of these people are completely pathetic slaves.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  They're money, they're Hollywood, none of it means anything. It's all a joke. It's all total crap.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  All that matters is you be aware of their master plan. And it's all public. Go read it for yourself.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  Or roll up your sleeve and go inject you with cephalus.
[1:57:47.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  You have all the power in the world, but you must use it. You must take action.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  As of taping this, it's Wednesday afternoon. We're running the biggest sale we've had since last Christmas.
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  It's store-wide free shipping, 50% off the high quality supplements from Ford's life,
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  and all the preparedness items like water filtration, air filtration, storeable foods, shortwave radios, and so much more.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  This is a huge special. We just sell a lot of product to fund ourselves, and these sales are a great way for you to get great prices,
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  but also support the M4. Please take action today. I've got to end this sale by Sunday or Monday at the max,
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  because a bunch of the items are about to sell out.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  Again, too many deals to fit them all in here. Just please go to infowarstore.com and realize during this critical time
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  that the global is trying to take us off the air. Your support is absolutely essential, so thank you.
[1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at InfoWars,
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  and we are the individuals that have done their research to understand the global's battle plan, and we know how to take them down.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:04.000]  That's why they're so upset. Think how far we've come together.
[1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  You know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on, because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  of the New World Order who've really taken the mask off, the lines in the sand for everybody now.
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:21.000]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and to stand with God and to stand with the unborn.
[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:27.000]  I just want to take time out again to salute the audience, because you are truly activists in the arena.
[1:59:27.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  And without you and your prayers and your word of mouth and your financial support,
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:35.000]  this operation that you built, that your operation would not be here.
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  We've got some giant specials running right now at infowarstore.com. A lot of items, 50% off.
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  Please take advantage of it at infowarstore.com to help us fight even harder into the future.
[1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:50.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  Live from the infowarstore.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:27.000]  Okay, Mike Adams is coming in. He's written an extremely powerful article that breaks down the very serious threat continuum.
[2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  But now the globalists do intend to remove Trump. Trump's for real.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  And if they can't impeach him, they're going to kill him unless we go on the offense.
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  And there's ways to do that. We'll talk about that with Mike Adams.
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  Next segment, I'm going to get into State Department memorandum 7277 and National Security Assessment 200 from December 10th, 1974.
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  The global depopulation plan for you and your family.
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  Fluoride in your water, brain damaging you, giving you cancer, Henry Kissinger.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  So I hope you enjoy that. We're going to be talking about that next segment.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  And then I'm going to get into Putin going after Greta Thunberg. That's up on infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com.
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  I just got into all the proofs that our life expectancy is going down with the vaccines and all this. It's killing us.
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  Countries that vaccinate don't live as long as they did.
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  And you can look at all the other causal information for that. This is being done by design.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  And our infant mortality is up as well.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  So we are in the middle of just an incredible time.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  I also want to play a few clips from the big Communist Party mass murder event yesterday that Trump sarcastically congratulated him on.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:35.000]  That's for face saving.
[2:01:35.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  Mr. McConnell rightfully talked about the tens of millions conservatively that they've killed.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  So we're going to be getting to that coming up.
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  But I'm going to break down why they're all doing this and how the global network intertwines and things right on the other side of this quick break.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  The new sites are infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com.
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  And both sites are being updated and really being made better.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  Band.video is an excellent modern site.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  There's a lot of new functions on it that I haven't even gotten to yet.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  And a lot of new things we're about to enable for info wars as well that we're really, really excited about.
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  But there are more than 15 channels on there right now for Millie Weaver and Katelyn Bennett and Paul Joseph Watson and Will Johnson and David Knight and just oh and Troyer and John bound and so many others.
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  And Mike Adams is adding a channel and we did have a hundred channels on there within about a month.
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  And then we intend to get it up to about 500 channels by the end of the year.
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  And so we're getting a lot of folks will pay for the bandwidth everything and you just put your put your videos on there.
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  It's just obviously got to be providers out there that we know aren't operatives because here's the deal.
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  I'm all about free speech and I believe in it.
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  And we can operate some level under the section 230.
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  But they send in infiltrators against us and it's real serious and they'll just make stuff up.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:11.000]  And or somebody will look like they're good and they'll start posting videos and then they'll put something in there to attribute it to us.
[2:03:11.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  I mean you can probably imagine what it's like.
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  And you know it doesn't get to me when people I've done nothing but been nice to lie about me.
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:21.000]  It doesn't get to me because I'm a fighter.
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  Except that it makes me so sad for them to know that people are so falling and just so turned over to evil.
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  But that's really the spirit of the age is where evil commits evil out in front of everybody.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  And then gets other people to join in and then maybe people think it's just normal.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  It's like a it's like a peer pressure thing.
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  And people really give up their souls.
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  They give up their integrity.
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  What I've noticed about evil though is it makes people real stupid.
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  Like people that have lied about me, we have video and audio of them saying the complete opposite.
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  And then saying something later and it's just like it's just crazy.
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  But it's like a Balazi Ford and all those people lying about Kavanaugh or all the other fake allegations or the media acting like Trump on the phone in Ukraine was corrupt.
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  Oh, it was on the line too.
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  Oh my God.
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  The Secretary of State was talking too far later.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  That's so dirty.
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  Why Trump shook Putin's hand once.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  Did you see?
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  Oh.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  And really it's been our tolerance of the left and all these sickos and all these fallen people.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  We should help people and try to build people up.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  But once they, once somebody shows any signs of being evil, another father of the devil, we have to just cut them off because you're not going to help a scorpion.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  And if you give a scorpion a ride across the river, it knows it's falling and ugly.
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  It's going to sting you because it wants to be you.
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  Well, the president came out this last Wednesday and said there is an ongoing coup against me by the deep state.
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:01.000]  They're not going to stop.
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:03.000]  They're allied with the Communist Chinese.
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  It's worse than I thought.
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:05.000]  It's incredible.
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:11.000]  And I need the American people to understand what's happening and to spread the word and to call Congress and to financially support me into this election.
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  That's all totally true.
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:13.000]  Please do it.
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  Also in full force, easier support.
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  I make it easy.

[2:05:45.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  Take action now because history is taking place.
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  Black Friday comes two months early.
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  Mega sale is about to end.
[2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:29.000]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship.
[2:06:29.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man.
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  A demonized version of Alex Jones to do that.
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  This is happening.
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship.
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  Thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  This is a tight traded dose reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:21.000]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:31.000]  with traders inside the major security agencies blocking Trump's resistance of the program
[2:07:31.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chai-Com slash Big Tech making combined emergency situation.
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  and have been battering, ramming and out as much as I can.
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:49.000]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception
[2:07:49.000 --> 2:07:52.000]  where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  So they take what I've said, be insincere, build me into an insincere person in the strawman.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars and so they make me a herder of children.
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  I am now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum has been used against you.
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  I have given you the transmission, now break free!
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:45.000]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:47.000]  Thomas Jefferson.
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  To the town of Alfred who rode a stranger one fine day.
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say.
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hips.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  Big iron on his hips.
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  It was early in the morning when he rode into the town.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  He came riding from the south side slowly looking all around.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  President Trump is set to give a press conference dealing with the ramped up coup to remove him, which is a coup.
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  It's not a real impeachment, there's nothing there.
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  The Democrats have said, oh we don't care, there's nothing there.
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  We'll find something, I mean they're not even hiding.
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  And they're on TV going, oh the intelligence agencies will take care of him.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  This is private intelligence agencies that have grown wealthy off of selling America out.
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  A bunch of blue blood, white shoe boy elitist whose religion is hating America because they hijacked America.
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  And they know they're not America.
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  So if they can finally beat us, they will be the champions.
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  British Empire couldn't beat us.
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  America could have won Vietnam in a week.
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  We could have won the Korean War in a week.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:27.000]  We had all the weapons then.
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  The traders that made us lose both wars gave the nuclear weapons to the Chai cops.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  We gave nuclear weapons to the Russians.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  We gave it all because it wasn't us, it was the globalist in control.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  We've been being maneuvered towards destruction because we were a Christian nation.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  We had incredible wealth in all the science.
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  We had the blessing.
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  So they hijacked us to take control of us.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  Now they're removing the blessing to bring us down.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  They believe they then take the birthright, the weapons systems, the technology, take over the planet.
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  And that's where we are.
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  Now, let me show you on screen, State Department of the Random, 7277.
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:13.000]  I think it's in the printer in there.
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  May I have that please? Thank you.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  And if you see this, this is the memorandum right here.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  Thank you for handing it to me.
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  You know, I don't see it, so come in and give it to me.
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  How's that sound?
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  Because I mean, I've got a problem.
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  My vision has become clouded and I'm not mad.
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  It's not a big deal.
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  Yeah, 7277.
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  What I need is, I have the National Security Memorandum 200 here in my hand.
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  That's what I have.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  So I don't have 7277.
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  State Department Memorandum 7277.
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  It's not a biggie.
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  I just wanted it earlier.
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  Rand Corporation, yeah, that's an interesting little document on 7277.
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  Let's do this.
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  Now, I'm in there a special report and then I will get my little ducky wuckies in a rowy-woey.
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  But anybody can type in 7277 in print.
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  And we will come back and cover all that for you.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  In fact, they've been telling me this is a really good, important report to play.
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  And so we're going to do that for everybody here.
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  Let's run the whole CHICOM angle and I wanted to get, I'll do the next segment for you.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  Let's go ahead and do that.
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  Hillary Clinton has come out and called Trump a clear and present danger to the country.
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  This occupant of the Oval Office poses a clear and present danger to our future, to our democracy.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  He has turned American diplomacy into a cheap extortion racket.
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  He has denigrated, and let's be honest, stabbed in the back, the career foreign service officers
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  who serve bravely and selflessly, no matter the politics of the administration that they are working under.
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  And now they are caught in the crossfire.
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  This is because he is rolling up the CHICOM spy grid that had taken control of the U.S.
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  He is ending our economic surrender to China and the globalist combine.
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  The actual traders are very upset that their gravy train is in danger.
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  So a secret agent man from the CIA inside the White House is the whistleblower that heard this, not second hand,
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:51.000]  but of course third hand.
[2:13:51.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  But that didn't stop the head of the committee, Mr. Besser Schiff,
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  to read in his opening statement a fake transcript and only later admit that it was a fake transcript.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:15.000]  And that didn't stop people like good old Joe Scarborough from tweeting out another fake transcript.
[2:14:15.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  Meanwhile, dossier 2.0, whistleblower complaint relies on Soros-funded investigative reporting, close quote group,
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  that partnered with Buzzfeed on Piscay.
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  Hundreds of documents conflict with Joe Biden's account of why Ukraine prosecutor was fired.
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  Hell, he's on TV saying if you don't fire him, I'll keep a billion dollars back.
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  It's totally illegal, regardless of why they removed him.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  They said, you have no authority, you're not the president.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  The president said, I said, call him.
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting a billion dollars.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  I said, you're not getting a billion.
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  I'm going to be leaving here.
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  And I think it was what, six hours?
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  I looked, I said, I'm leaving at six hours.
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  Got fired.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  This is a complete charade, you've got Omar and AOC running around, foaming at the mouth.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  So happy all this is going on.
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  What he has already admitted to is an impeachable offense.
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  Are we all ready to impeach them?
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:24.000]  The president has broken a law.
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  He said, we thought there's executive privilege.
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  We thought our phone calls with the president are private.
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  I mean, we're not releasing phone calls from Nancy Pelosi.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  So we're not going to talk to Trump on the phone if it's just released to the public.
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  That's private conversations.
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  Presidents should be able to talk to each other.
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  You know, privacy?
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  So you can really have discussions?
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  See, the idea of Trump having any diplomacy, any of the document, 7277,
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  I'm going to tell you why they're doing all this when we come back.
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  Peace is a tincture that you take under the tongue.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  You've been selling it for over a year.

[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:02.000]  that admits it's putting cancer viruses in the vaccines,
[2:18:02.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  it's putting fluorine in the water to brain damages,
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  and that it's trying to literally destroy our families
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  and organize us into a bunch of dumbed-down slaves
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:13.000]  so they can then carry out orderly extermination.
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  I'm not putting up with it.
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  And our information, our truth, is devastating to the scumbag Satanist.

[2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:55.000]  History is happening right now.
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:59.000]  President Trump is trying to remove the swamp,
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:01.000]  the globalists that have been feeding on our nation
[2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:04.000]  and selling us out to the chai-coms and others.
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  That's why Nancy Pelosi has come out and said that the Attorney General Barr
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:11.000]  has to resign because he's corrupt.
[2:19:11.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  That's because they know that he's getting ready to move against the deep state,
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:20.000]  that there are sealed indictments against McCabe and others.
[2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  Already two weeks ago, the appeal by the Deputy Attorney General was rejected.
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  The appeal was brought to him and it was rejected.
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:30.000]  That means the indictment is there.
[2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  That's why they're so panicked, that's why this impeachment's real.
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  Of course it's made up, of course it's a fraud,
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:40.000]  but it's the neocon and leftist deep state that knows they've committed so many crimes,
[2:19:40.000 --> 2:19:44.000]  their back is against the wall, and they're making their move right now.
[2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  This is the time to be fully engaged, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  We're fighting for not just our nation, but the world's future.
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:20:16.000]  America is fighting for its life.
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  We are waiting for President Trump to give a press conference. Mike Adams is going to be in the studio with us for the next hour and a half.
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  And we'll plow through the actual plan to remove the president in this coup.
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  The president's now calling it a coup. This is what it is. History is happening.
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  And Mike Adams is a very well researched, and I totally concur with his analysis of the hierarchy of deep state escalation
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  that will end in the attempt of assassination of President Trump and an engineered terrorism across America.
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  They're not going to get him this time around with the impeachment, but it's part of a larger plan.
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  And Mike Adams has cracked the code, so have we.
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:05.000]  And I don't say that with pleasure, okay?
[2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:09.000]  All right, we cracked the code on Las Vegas, okay?
[2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  We cracked the code on basically all of it because we're willing to understand these are psychotics that are running this.
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  And we know their past history and we have their documents, okay?
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  I'm sorry, this is also scary.
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  If somebody was coming to break in your house, wouldn't you want to know they were coming?
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  Like I called and said, hey, Merv, or hey, Bob, or hey, Carol, or whatever.
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  There's some dudes breaking in the back of your house.
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  Are you awake? Why are you trying to scare me?
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  They go, oh, thanks a lot.
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:44.000]  Well, this is happening to all of us.
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  It is a fact.
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  I mean, they're all over the news saying vaccines won't harm you.
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  The damn inserts say they'll kill you and they won't protect you.
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  Let me explain just in the big picture why this is happening.
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:11.000]  Powerful empires were contending for control, but the British Empire was dominant in World War I.
[2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  And the Germans technologically were coming out with a lot of science.
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  So in the British newspaper, this was all public, they called it the German problem.
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  And they said, how are we going to deal with this?
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:25.000]  And they said, well, we're going to start wars with them.
[2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  And then we're going to beat them militarily.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  Then we'll have a League of Nations out of that.
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:32.000]  That's really the British Empire.
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  And we'll never let one nation get too powerful.
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  The other will end war that way.
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:39.000]  Of course, the British Empire had no intention of actually doing that.
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:42.000]  And I want to explain it's not the British people, it's their model.
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:44.000]  That the globalist had control.
[2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  That's where globalism comes from.
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:49.000]  Cecil Rhodes, all of it.
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  And then they set up and funded Hitler, Lord Milner, they had secret contracts.
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  Edward VIII was supposed to be the head of the new EU, and the Nazi kingdom would be Europe.
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  And then the British Empire was supposed to merge with that and run the whole planet.
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  That's been declassified.
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  They double-crossed the Germans, triple-crossed them, really.
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  And Edward VIII had to advocate.
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  And then you saw what happened.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  Very sophisticated plan and big gamble, too.
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:25.000]  But that was all cooked up by British intelligence.
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  Now, at the end of that now, the U.S. is the global dominant empire with the British Empire.
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:33.000]  And then books are all written on that by Carol Quigley.
[2:23:33.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  It was a big presence key by British scholars.
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  I mean, that's a fact at Ph.D. level.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  This is not even debated.
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  CFR is British intelligence.
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  And then they'd always been funding eugenics for 100 years before that.
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  And Hitler had just kind of gone wild with the plan and tried to do it all at once.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  They had a longer-term plan for this.
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:24:00.000]  And so they developed the Carnegie Endowment.
[2:24:00.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  And this is all the congressional hearings.
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:02.000]  You look it up.
[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  A plan for a world government.
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  But they said, well, that's not enough to stop war through our new UN that the Rockefellers paid for.
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  We want to end the family itself.
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  We want to end aggression in men, so they held these studies on how to make men docile.
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  Do they let them play sports?
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  Do you keep them arrested development?
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  Well, it's still better just to put chemicals in the water to make them more passive,
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  to make them more effeminate.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  Then we'll promote a trans movement, Tabistock Institute,
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  with that in the 60s, to then get people to voluntarily sterilize themselves.
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:37.000]  You notice they mainly target mentally retarded and autistic folks with the trans movement.
[2:24:37.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  It's kind of like, oh, we sterilize them, but they think they're cool.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  It's really cold-blooded.
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:44.000]  You can argue, well, we should be sterilizing those folks.
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  Well, just the point is, you should know what's going on.
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  Because they're also giving you 5G and fluoride for everybody.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:51.000]  Because they're not just targeting who they see as weak.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  They're targeting, more importantly, who they see as strong, what they call contenders.
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  Like a grizzly bear, male, will kill his own son.
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  Because he knows that's going to be a big, powerful bear that will push me out of my territory.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  They'll come over and smell it, know it's his own, boy, kill it.
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  Lions do it, and tigers do it.
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  So they're fluoridating, they're GMO-ing, they're hitting you with the magnetic radiation.
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  They're killing everybody for this plant.
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:22.000]  And they even know they're not going to escape it.
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  They believe, wherever they're getting this advanced knowledge,
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  because they certainly got a plan that's advanced,
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  that they have to build this world government, then carry out an orderly extermination
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  to be given all this great power and a sin and merge with the silicon.
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  And that's why in Freedom from War 7277, and that's why in Memorandum 200 from Kissinger,
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:48.000]  you can read all these, these are declassified, they lay out the plan to end the human system
[2:25:48.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  as we know it to have Freedom from War.
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:51.000]  How do you end war?
[2:25:51.000 --> 2:25:53.000]  You end humanity.
[2:25:53.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  And you transcend it, you evolve past it.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  Now that's just really the satanic scam to take full control.
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:02.000]  Now, Trump's speaking at 225 Eastern Time, 125 Central.
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  He's thanking and talking to a world leader that you guys can just start rolling from there,
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  that he's in a press conference with.
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  He'll dispense with the pleasantries in a moment and go to questions,
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  and we'll go to that when he does.
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  Looks like he may be doing it now.
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  Let's go to the President live.
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  It's the of Finland to the White House and Mr. President.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  It's wonderful to host you once again in Washington.
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  We've gotten to know each other over the last period of time,
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  and it's been a great experience.
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  We'll go back to him.
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  We've got a DVR too, not just live.
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  So when he gets to meet and tell you this, we'll get to it.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  He's already said again now in a video statement
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.000]  that Schiff should be investigated for treason.
[2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  Yeah, we're trying to overthrow an election.
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  And then Schiff did a statement.
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  I've got that video, I haven't played it yet.
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  Where Schiff says that Trump works for a foreign government.
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  So they're right back to that crap.
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  We know who doesn't want America to be great.
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  We know who's anti-free market and anti-god and anti-family.
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  It's the Democrats.
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:07.000]  And the Republicans are a bunch of country club blue bloods on average
[2:27:07.000 --> 2:27:11.000]  that are scared of the media and have been bending over forever.
[2:27:11.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  And yet the Rockefeller Republican is really a Democrat.
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  Double you take over to derail things after Reagan.
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  Well, guess what?
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:19.000]  Things are getting back on track.
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  That doesn't mean Reagan was perfect,
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:27.000]  but he didn't have a big old, you know what, to screw America over.
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  You know, just old-fashioned leaders that just want progress and freedom
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:33.000]  in a human world, not this crazy Silicon Valley.
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  We're going to merge the machines and be gods.
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  And it's the post-human world.
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  It's New York Times, Washington Post, NBC News, everywhere.
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  Telling you how much you suck.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  This cult's out in the open.
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  All right, Trump is still dispensing with the pleasantries.
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  He's not dispensing with them.
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  He's going through them.
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  But we'll come back.
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:50.000]  Mike Adams will be in.
[2:27:50.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  We'll talk about some issues with Mike.
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  Get into some of the things that are happening.
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  And he's going to take over in the fourth hour
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  because we know the blueprint of the enemy.
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:27:59.000]  That means we should be able to defeat it.
[2:27:59.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  Just briefly, we've got to end it this weekend.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  It's the biggest sale since Christmas.
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  It's Black Friday.
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  It comes two months early.
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  We do things differently here.
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  Store-wide free shipping.
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  Double-patriot points to your next order.
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  50% off all the high-quality supplements.
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  That means the coffee, the toothpaste is all discounted too.
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  Let me tell you what, the coffee and the toothpaste.
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  I mean, we're making them on the toothpaste discounted like two bucks.
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  And on the coffee, you know, I mean, we're making like five, six dollars.
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  People love it.
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  And it's one of our best sellers.
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  But we have to sell a lot of it to fund our operation.
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  The fish oil, the turmeric, bodies, ultimate turmeric.
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  Everybody should get as a staple.
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  Ultra 12, the strongest high-quality organic B12 you're going to find.
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  Taking under the tongue.
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  It's the base system for everything.
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  Get it.
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  It's 50% off.
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  And sign up for auto-ship.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  Cancel any time.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:47.000]  Additional 10% off.
[2:28:47.000 --> 2:28:48.000]  Whatever you do, keep supporting us.
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  Thank you.
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system,
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up,
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:01.000]  Bill Hyde here.
[2:29:01.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  on our PPX microgrid system.
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:09.000]  That's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  off the grid.
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:15.000]  right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location,
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:21.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:25.000]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:27.000]  if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:29.000]  So here's what you should do right now.
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:38.000]  Over $1,000 in great off-the-grid gear,
[2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  and a ton of bonuses too.
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:40.000]  And the best part?
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:43.000]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500.
[2:29:43.000 --> 2:29:45.000]  $300 or even $200.
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:48.000]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:51.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:54.000]  You have all the power in the world,
[2:29:54.000 --> 2:29:55.000]  but you must use it.
[2:29:55.000 --> 2:29:57.000]  You must take action.
[2:29:57.000 --> 2:30:00.000]  As of taping this, it's Wednesday afternoon.
[2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:04.000]  We're running the biggest sale we've had since last Christmas.
[2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:06.000]  It's store-wide free shipping.
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:09.000]  50% off the high-quality supply of electricity.
[2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:13.000]  It's store-wide free shipping, 50% off the high-quality supplements
[2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:16.000]  from FoursLife, and all the preparedness items
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:18.000]  like water filtration, air filtration,
[2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  storable foods, shortwave radios, and so much more.
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  This is a huge special.
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:25.000]  We need to sell a lot of product to fund ourselves,
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:28.000]  and these sales are a great way for you to get great prices,
[2:30:28.000 --> 2:30:30.000]  but also support the M4.
[2:30:30.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  Please take action today.
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:34.000]  I've got to end this sale by Sunday or Monday at the max
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:38.000]  because a bunch of the items are about to sell out.
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:40.000]  Again, too many deals to fit them all in here.
[2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:42.000]  Just please go to infowarstore.com
[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:44.000]  and realize you're in this critical time
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:46.000]  with the globalists trying to take us off the air.
[2:30:46.000 --> 2:30:49.000]  Your support is absolutely essential, so thank you.
[2:30:53.000 --> 2:30:55.000]  The truth is, President Trump is the most
[2:30:55.000 --> 2:30:58.000]  investigated president in history.
[2:30:58.000 --> 2:31:02.000]  He is working for American interests steadfastly.
[2:31:02.000 --> 2:31:04.000]  He is trying to preserve our country
[2:31:04.000 --> 2:31:06.000]  as the globalists try to break our borders,
[2:31:06.000 --> 2:31:08.000]  bankrupt, and devalue our dollar,
[2:31:08.000 --> 2:31:11.000]  and sign us over to communist Chinese control
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:13.000]  who now own Hollywood and the majority of our debt.
[2:31:13.000 --> 2:31:17.000]  We have been maneuvered towards collapse and bankruptcy,
[2:31:17.000 --> 2:31:19.000]  but at the 11th hour, 58th minute,
[2:31:19.000 --> 2:31:22.000]  the American people put a populist in power,
[2:31:22.000 --> 2:31:24.000]  and it's happening all over the world,
[2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:26.000]  so great things are happening,
[2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:28.000]  but the enemy is striking back.
[2:31:28.000 --> 2:31:30.000]  You're very serious with this impeachment plan.
[2:31:30.000 --> 2:31:32.000]  It has bipartisan support,
[2:31:32.000 --> 2:31:35.000]  and I'm telling you, President Trump needs our prayers
[2:31:35.000 --> 2:31:38.000]  and info wars needs your prayers and support.
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are trying to shut us down,
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:43.000]  but right now it's easier than ever to financially support us
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:45.000]  while getting great products at the same time
[2:31:45.000 --> 2:31:47.000]  with Black Friday comes two months early
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:49.000]  with store-wide free shipping,
[2:31:49.000 --> 2:31:53.000]  double-patria points, and, ladies and gentlemen, 50% off.
[2:31:53.000 --> 2:31:57.000]  Super Silver Woon Gel is a private label
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:31:59.000]  from the top company in the U.S.
[2:31:59.000 --> 2:32:01.000]  that has their products in hospitals
[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:04.000]  and is sold over-the-counter and approved for that by the FDA.
[2:32:04.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  We have been blessed with their listeners
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:08.000]  and let us private label it in the last two years
[2:32:08.000 --> 2:32:10.000]  as been a best-seller.
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:13.000]  We convinced them to let us come out with a skin cream
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:15.000]  that basically mimics the top skin creams
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:17.000]  that are already out there
[2:32:17.000 --> 2:32:21.000]  at a lower price with their patented SilverSol technology in it.
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  It's got the hyaluronic acid.
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:25.000]  It's got the steric acid.
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  It's got the grapefruit essential oil.
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:30.000]  It's got the nano silver, coconut oil,
[2:32:30.000 --> 2:32:32.000]  and so much more.
[2:32:32.000 --> 2:32:35.000]  Super Silver Skin Cream in 3.4 oz.
[2:32:35.000 --> 2:32:37.000]  and in the smaller one.
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:39.000]  You're not going to find a product that's good anywhere.
[2:32:39.000 --> 2:32:41.000]  You're certainly not going to find it at this price.
[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:44.000]  And it funds the InfoWare at infowarslife.com.
[2:32:44.000 --> 2:32:47.000]  Get your Super Silver Skin Cream today.
[2:32:47.000 --> 2:32:50.000]  We can only run this special for another week or so
[2:32:50.000 --> 2:33:03.000]  and we'll be keeping this September 10th.
[2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  President Trump is holding a joint press conference
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:28.000]  for the leader of Finland.
[2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:31.000]  And as soon as any serious questions come up
[2:33:31.000 --> 2:33:33.000]  about the attempts in peachy, we'll go to it.
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:38.000]  Mygadamsofnaturalnews.com is writing a shot done with me here.
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:40.000]  I intended to open the phones up today.
[2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:43.000]  I promise I will do it for the full show tomorrow.
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  But I'll be honest with you, I did a lot of preparation today
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  and I have not been able to control myself
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  from ranting.
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  But that's really a natural effect
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  and I think it's healthy sometimes
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  because when you know that they're killing us by design
[2:33:58.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  and they're admitting and they're releasing deadly GMO mutants,
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  mosquitoes, and they're putting up 5G,
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  they admit massively gives you cancer
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  and the cancer rates are all exploding
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  and they're saying vaccines are totally safe
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  and the inserts say they can kill you
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  and the mortality rate of the U.S. is falling again.
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:16.000]  You know, people in the 1870s live longer than we do.
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  We're being killed.
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  And now the President says this is an act of coup.
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  It's not an impeachment. We're in a red-level emergency.
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  The Democrats are out of China.
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  Everything we've told you is now out in the open.
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:32.000]  It's so epic and the corporate media is so far and owned
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:36.000]  and a large part of the public is so evil and dumb
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  that there's a question if Trump will stay in office.
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  And believe me, they get Trump.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:44.000]  They're coming after everybody 10 times worse.
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  I don't want to even say I'm a deer in the headlights.
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  It's the opposite of that.
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:50.000]  I'm like a dog when it gets in a fight and its hair puffs out.
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  I mean, I don't even know at a certain point.
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  It's almost obscene to sit or just rattle off
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  what's happening and what's unfolding
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:01.000]  because it's just so crazy.
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  It's so...this should not be tolerated.
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  We're not the ones bringing martial law.
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  We're not the ones bringing crisis and civil war.
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  They're the ones saying, I mean, I saw the video last night.
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  I never even got to this day. We'll play it next segment.
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:15.000]  I think they gave it to you.
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  Where Maxine Water says impeachment isn't enough.
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:20.000]  Put him in prison.
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  Solitary confinement torturing him.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  And then Governor Welch says kill him.
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:26.000]  Kill him, kill him, kill him.
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  And these are people with power
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  who've been caught lying over and over again
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  whose husbands get, you know, 30 million taxpayer
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  to swindle for his bank directly to him.
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  Like Maxine Waters, they're all crooks.
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  And it really is obscene
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  and it makes me feel pathetic
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  that, oh, it's like, wow, we're waking people up.
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:48.000]  New rule order is out in the open.
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  Hey, it's admitted they're keeping babies alive and killing them.
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  Hey, they admit, fluoride's new.
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  Had they admitted to every Epstein work with Bill Gates?
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  In secret eugenics, how'd you know that?
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  Because it was in the white papers 20 years ago.
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  I mean, I don't have a feeling of satisfaction, Mike Adams,
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:04.000]  and I'm not going to lie to people up here.
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  I mean, I just feel like really freaked out
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  because I thought a lot of this came out.
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  We would just turn it around and stop it instead.
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  It's like, okay, so what?
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  I mean, babies have valuable organs.
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:18.000]  Let's keep them alive and kill those little bastards.
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  We want the organ.
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  I mean, it's just like a psychotic, mass demon possession
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:26.000]  and the ability to say no to this
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  and to get upset to this and to say no to this
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:33.000]  and to recognize it and have an immune system
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  spiritually, culturally, economically.
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  People should be running around like angry ants right now.
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  Not bullied by the left.
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  I mean, all this footage of the ante for bullying old ladies and stuff.
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:46.000]  I mean, it just makes me angry.
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  Humanity is failing right now to get angry enough.
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:53.000]  And even as much as you are obviously angry about this,
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  I am as well.
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  We are failing, frankly.
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:01.000]  We are only saying 1% of the level of warning,
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  the level of red alarm that should be happening right now.
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  We can't even express it in words
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  because, look, there's a soft kill of humanity
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  and there's a soft coup of Trump right now.
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  Both of these are going to go to the hot phase.
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  Both of these are going to go to hard kill and hard coup.
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  This is what's crucial to understand.
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  They're happening in parallel.
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:22.000]  They are the exact same globalists trying.
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  They are.
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:24.000]  And they are linked.
[2:37:24.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  If they destroy Trump, they also succeed in destroying humanity
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  because Trump represents the last hope for humanity
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  to have a free nation on this planet.
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  So understand that all this is going to go high.
[2:37:34.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  And that's what's so crazy is he really is for real.
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  And then people aren't going, this is wonderful.
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  They're like, no, we don't want it.
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  Well, right.
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:43.000]  And humanity is going to be overrun here.
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  Humanity is going to be absolutely destroyed
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  if we don't turn this around and wake people up enough.
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  And I watch you from the control room there, Alex.
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  And I just think, you are expressing what I feel.
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  I can't express it the way you do.
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  But none of us are even close to the level of alarm
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  and alert that we should be expressing right now.
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  We should be screaming at the top of our lungs,
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:06.000]  jumping up and down.
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  There should be a million people swarming Washington, D.C.
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  peacefully and lawfully right now to demand...
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:14.000]  And not going and demonstrating like they tell you to.
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  Go to the Capitol.
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  Go into the office beings.
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  When they come to their district, go get in their face, man.
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  They want to intimidate us.
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  We're not saying beat them up or threaten to stab them
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  like the Democrats do.
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  We're going to go let them know that we're aware of their agenda.
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  And by the way, NASA just put out a little bit of a kind of a leak,
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  a pre-announcement that they are going to announce
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  the discovery of life on Mars in two years.
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  Think about this, Alex.
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:39.000]  It's going to be life on Mars, death on Earth.
[2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  They are genocidally cleansing, ethnically cleansing this planet
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  to try to kill us off while they're going to announce
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  the universe is filled with life.
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  But you don't deserve it because you're a lowly Earthling,
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  a lowly human.
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  It's obviously the big secret.
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  And that's why they got Trump compartmentalized.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  They don't want him to find out what's going on in the black budget stuff
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  because once he goes, there's cure for cancer.
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  Wait, wait, wait.
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  I mean, I mean...
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  Well, the fight, the fight has only begun.
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  This is, you can't even say it enough.
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  The American people think that they're in a fight right now
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  with Trump trying to save Trump from this illegal treasonous coup
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:18.000]  carried out by these seditious crisis actors in the media
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  who are CIA puppets, by the way.
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  This is just the beginning of the fight.
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  If Trump survives impeachment, don't run around and think that,
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:26.000]  oh, victory, victory.
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:29.000]  No, they're going to try to assassinate Trump.
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  They're going to use area effect weapons.
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  This is what I broke down in my analysis that I'm happy to go into.
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  You're going to cover it into tell next hour when you host.
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:39.000]  Let's see what Trump's saying right now.
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  To a conclusion, could I ask Ambassador Pence to just come up for one second
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  and explain the importance of what just took place?
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  Because this has been going on for many, many years.
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  And this is Ambassador Pence, no relationship to our great vice president.
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  Hard to believe. Nobody believes him.
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  He said before he goes, let me go into questions after the break.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:00.000]  So let's go back.
[2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  You're going to have the floor next to your article that's on infowars.com
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  and it's on naturalnews.com, the hierarchy of the deep state escalation
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:10.000]  that will end in the attempt to assassinate President Trump
[2:40:10.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  and engineered terrorism across America. Exactly.
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:13.000]  They're not just going to take out Trump.
[2:40:13.000 --> 2:40:17.000]  They're then going to stage the white supremacist attacks
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  to drive the wedge and start the race for it.
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  They've decided that all Trump supporters, anyone who's a Christian,
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:28.000]  a conservative or a gun owner, has no right to exist.
[2:40:28.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  This is Maxine Waters, Kamala Harris and so on saying,
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  you don't have a right to speak.
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:35.000]  What they really believe is you don't have a right to exist.
[2:40:35.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  Trump is standing in the way of their mass purge.
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  They want to purge all conservatives across America.
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  And that's why Trump is saying they want your guns, your kids, your God, your money.
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  They want to conquer you because it's true.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  Yeah, this is what we've got to understand.
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:50.000]  This is no longer the realm of politics.
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  This is the realm of humanity versus satanic destruction of all life on our planet.
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:57.000]  It really has reached that point.
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:41:04.000]  Trump is just one of the proxies for survival that's in play right now.
[2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:06.000]  Because there's always going to be different things in the universe.
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  There's going to be people that don't want to ruin everything.
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:09.000]  Well, exactly.
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  But there's powerful forces to do.
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  Well, look, I mean, the creative force in the universe, God, the divine,
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  healthy babies, you know, for God's sake, healthy babies are now the enemy of the left.
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  Healthy brains.
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  If you can think for yourself, you're the enemy of the left.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  That's why they have the fluoride in the water.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  That's why they have the chemicals in the vaccines.
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  People ask, why do they want a brain damage?
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  Why do they want to hurt us?
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  But they admit in eco science written by Obama's science art,
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  they put it in there to make us more manageable.
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  Well, right.
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  And the multiple vectors right now of this soft kill are about the transition to a hard kill approach.
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  This is what's going to happen, Alice.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  You see it too.
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  Just like the hard coup, the attempted assassination of Trump and the hard kill vectors to destroy the food supply nationwide.
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  We're talking about geo engineering now.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  We're talking about terraforming, polluting the atmosphere.
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  We've covered this before, but it's about collapsing the global food supply, starting with third world countries.
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  The globalists have always wanted to eliminate those in Africa and India and central and South America.
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  That's been their first target, but they won't stop there.
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:17.000]  They're going to go for everyone who is, who believes in human liberty, who believes in national sovereignty.
[2:42:17.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  Anyone who believes that you have a right to speak.
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  Absolutely.
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  Trump just got an impeachment question up front.
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:22.000]  Let's do it.
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  It's live.
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  We'll hit pause and we'll come back with a press conference right after that.
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  Then we'll have Mike Adams play the spot.
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  I want to explain something.
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  We're not alarmists here.
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:30.000]  We're realists.
[2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  We've analyzed every point of the globalist agenda.
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  And we told you a long time ago it was this plan.
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  Now it's out in the open.
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  So this is very positive of what we're doing, admitting this is going on.
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  And then you see it happening.
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  Oh my God, it's revelation literally coming to pass, which is good news.
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  It makes you know that we're not in this alone.
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:43:19.000]  Stay with us.
[2:43:20.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  We're ready.
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  Two weeks ago, the appeal by the deputy attorney general was rejected.
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  The appeal was brought to him and it was rejected.
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  That means the indictment is there.
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  That's why they're so panicked.
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:33.000]  That's why this impeachment is real.
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  Of course it's made up.
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:39.000]  Of course it's a fraud, but it's the neocon and leftist deep state that knows they've
[2:43:39.000 --> 2:43:40.000]  committed so many crimes.
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  They're back as against the wall and they're making their move right now.
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  This is the time to be fully engaged.
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:51.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're fighting for not just our nation, but the world's future.
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  America is fighting for its life.
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:56.000]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong?
[2:43:56.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  Trying to fact check the president.
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:04.000]  The deceptive, humpy, dumpy troll known as Brian Stelter and his little weasel minion,
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  Oliver Darcy, have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air in the censor us.
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  And of course he famously said on many others that Trump is the info wars president.
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say,
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  the info wars president.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:22.000]  And you know what is true?
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:27.000]  Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew and my drive and your drive has brought
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  Trump to the White House and other nationalists to power around the world and now Trump's
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  tyrannies.
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  So this is a day of great victory and I salute you all but now I'm the thick of the fight.
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:46.000]  So infowarstore.com for products you need, massive sales now so we can continue on to
[2:44:46.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end until we've
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  defeated them.
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:59.000]  Look, I'm not trying to discourage other best selling bone broth formulas that sell for
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:04.000]  $35, $40, $50, $60 retail that are discounted for like $39.95.
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:09.000]  But they don't have as much pure concentrated bone broth as we do.
[2:45:09.000 --> 2:45:11.000]  They don't have as much chocolate mushroom.
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:13.000]  They don't have as much bee pollen.
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:16.000]  They don't have as much of these amazing ingredients.
[2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:22.000]  And yes, we've gone out and just made a stronger version of other best sellers and it's selling
[2:45:22.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  out.

[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  You know, I'm angry because I'm not just going to sit here and take this scientific
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:02.000]  dictatorship that admits it's putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[2:46:02.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  It's putting fluorine in the water to brain damages and that it's trying to literally
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  destroy our families and organize us into a bunch of dumb down slaves so they can then
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:13.000]  carry out or orderly extermination.
[2:46:13.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  I'm not putting up with it.
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  And our information, our truth is devastating to these scumbag satans.
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  But we've got to stay on air.
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  And I make it easy for you to help us stay on air.

[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:52.000]  Whatever you do, take action.
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:53.000]  infowarstore.com.
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:46:58.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:15.000]  You know, Mike Adams was talking during the break about those of us that are empathetic.
[2:47:15.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  We're connected to life.
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:17.000]  We're connected to God.
[2:47:17.000 --> 2:47:18.000]  We're connected to the earth.
[2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  We can feel the evil growing.
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:22.000]  We can also see it.
[2:47:22.000 --> 2:47:26.000]  And those that don't care are detached from God.
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:27.000]  They're detached from love.
[2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:33.000]  And even you can hook up sociopaths, psychopaths to brain scans and you can see it.
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  There's not as much activity.
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  They're like reptiles.
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  And that's what we're dealing with.
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  And they want to use machines to make us all programmable.
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:43.000]  They want to turn us into machines.
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  But the fact that the president now says there's an ongoing coup against him, it's true.
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:50.000]  And that they want to take all of our freedoms.
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:51.000]  It's true.
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:55.000]  And that the globalists have thrown in with China and helped build them up and use them
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  as the model for what they want for us.
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  It's all true.
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  And we're here.
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  And I just think it's the realization that we always knew we were right.
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  I always knew I was telling the truth.
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:08.000]  But to really see it followed through on.
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:14.000]  And to really see all of this out in the open.
[2:48:14.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  And to know that it's all going to accelerate now.
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  And that there's not just evil in the universe.
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  To know that there's good.
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  And to know if more people would activate and care and just be heard that we would defeat
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:30.000]  this overnight.
[2:48:30.000 --> 2:48:33.000]  But instead, we're going to go through hell, folks.
[2:48:33.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  But it's okay because that's what's going to test us.
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  Here's part of the ongoing press conference.
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:38.000]  First question.
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  Trump gets asked.
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:40.000]  This is in near time.
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  It's happened a few minutes ago.
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  This is Trump like five minutes ago being asked about, of course, first question about
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  impeachment.
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:47.000]  Here it is.
[2:48:47.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  I was asking maybe I could ask them separately to get a fresh answer out of each one.
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:55.000]  The three House intelligence, the three House committees that are looking into the impeachment
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  inquiry, gave notice today that they will be sending a subpoena to the White House for
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  documents and other materials.
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  Will you cooperate with those subpoenas?
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  Well, I always cooperate.
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:07.000]  This is a hoax.
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  This is the greatest hoax.
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  This is just a continuation of what's been playing out, John, for the last, since my election,
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  I'd say, if you want, and probably we'll find out soon, but probably even before my election.
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  This is a fraudulent crime on the American people, but we'll work together with Shifty
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  Shift and Pelosi and all of them, and we'll see what happens because we did absolutely,
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  I had a great call with the president of Ukraine.
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  It was 100%.
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:36.000]  You have the transcript.
[2:49:36.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  And then Schiff went up and he got, as the chairman of the committee, got up and related
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  a call that didn't take place.
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  He made up the language.
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:46.000]  It's hard to believe nobody's ever seen this.
[2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  I think he had some kind of a mental breakdown, but he went up to the microphone and he read
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:56.000]  a statement from the president of the United States as if I were on the call because what
[2:49:56.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  happened is when he looked at the sheet, which was an exact transcript of my call done by
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  very talented people that do this exact word for word, he said, wow, he didn't do anything
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  wrong.
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  So he made it up.
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  He went up to a microphone and in front of the American people and in Congress, he went
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  out and he gave a whole presentation of words that the president of the United States never
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  said.
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  It has to be a criminal act.
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  It has to be.
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  And he should resign.
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  We're going to go back to this in a moment.
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  The reason this is so important is that's really what happened.
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  You know, CNN only put out a transcript.
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:39.000]  They always say at the bottom, this may not be exact in case it's a typo.
[2:50:39.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  The media used that, that they said, this is a transcripting service and what was recorded,
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  but it may not be exact.
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:46.000]  But it is what they said word for word.
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:52.000]  They go, well, that's not even really the transcript because it said this some third hand made up
[2:50:52.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  person who we don't even get to know who they are.
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  And then Trump says, I want to face my accuser.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  Oh my gosh, you're threatening somebody.
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  But he is just beautifully taking them on.
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  And I've been critical of Trump not fighting the censorship, letting us all be undercut
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:07.000]  and other things.
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:13.000]  But overall, he's gone from a 95, it might be like a 99 the last few weeks, the way he
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:16.000]  rises to the occasion and is under such attack.
[2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  And now we're going to play this at the start of the next hour.
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  They're everywhere saying they want to kill him or they want him in solitary confinement.
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  So it's impeach, imprison, kill.
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  Trump is in the fight now.
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  He knows exactly what's at stake.
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  He knows that they're going to try to destroy him or literally kill him, but also destroy all of us in the process.
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:37.000]  Anyway, I want to see every transcript of every phone call that Barack Obama ever made.
[2:51:37.000 --> 2:51:40.000]  And I want to see Hillary Clinton's 30,000 emails.
[2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:42.000]  I want to see Joe Biden's phone call transcripts.
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  If we're going to call for this transparency on Trump, let's have all the records of all the eight Obama years
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  and all the presidents before that, you know, enough of this selective secrecy and selective hypocrisy.
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:57.000]  You just laid out the absolute key point.
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:00.000]  Trump turned over millions of campaign emails, all everything.
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  They're fake Russiagate, nothing there.
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:05.000]  I'm surprised somebody somewhere didn't do something.
[2:52:05.000 --> 2:52:07.000]  Okay, with a huge organization.
[2:52:07.000 --> 2:52:10.000]  Now they go, will you turn it over?
[2:52:10.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  Like they're in the authority.
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:13.000]  He's a separate branch of government.
[2:52:13.000 --> 2:52:18.000]  And Trump's like, sure, absolutely, because he knows he will show he did nothing.
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  This is crap.
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:22.000]  And as you said, Pelosi's not going to hand anything over.
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:25.000]  Diane Feinstein with a Chinese spy running her office is going to turn anything over.
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  Yeah, I want to see Feinstein's emails to communist China from her office.
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  Let's just, let's have everything out in the open, not just Republicans.
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  Well, I mean, it's like foreign leaders are going, wait a minute, we've never heard of this of leaders calls and everything just released.
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:41.000]  Are our calls going to be released?
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  Because they're having real discussions here.
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  This is called diplomacy.
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  The first rule of diplomacy is that people will be able to talk candidly.
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  So again, they're acting like the president, even having conversations is bad.
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:57.000]  Oh, and then when he says, I want to face my accuser, they say, oh, now you're threatening him.
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:53:00.000]  And that's impeachable, even if nothing else was impeachable.
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:01.000]  Well, I see this all the time.
[2:53:01.000 --> 2:53:02.000]  This has happened to you.
[2:53:02.000 --> 2:53:05.000]  But I mean, they go get people to just make up lies.
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  They never call you to hear what happened.
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:09.000]  And then they just act like it's true.
[2:53:09.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  And then I sit there and I watch people lie about me knowing they're being paid to do it.
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:15.000]  And it's like, wow, Judas is scary.
[2:53:15.000 --> 2:53:16.000]  It's like a real person.
[2:53:16.000 --> 2:53:17.000]  Yeah.
[2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:22.000]  I mean, I mean, you realize like the, it's when you realize the corruption has gone so deep now.
[2:53:22.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  And it's like I was saying during the break about this connection.
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  You know who they can corrupt easily are people who I call soulless people,
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  people who've lost their connection to God or connection to spirit.
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:34.000]  They can be programmed out.
[2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:36.000]  It's like their NPCs.
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  Right.
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:40.000]  NPCs or what sometimes I call them PLS programmable life forms.
[2:53:40.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  Every mainstream media journalist is a programmable life form or an NPC.
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:48.000]  As you say, they are drones who are handed a script.
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:50.000]  They are incapable of critical thought.
[2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:56.000]  And by the way, they are recruited because they've abandoned any connection to reality.
[2:53:56.000 --> 2:53:57.000]  That's why they're selected.
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  And that's why it's great that Trump came from out to the political process.
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:02.000]  Almost all these people that have gotten in was the same way.
[2:54:02.000 --> 2:54:06.000]  They've proven that they're drones who will carry out this centralized system.
[2:54:06.000 --> 2:54:07.000]  Yep.
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  And by the way, half the Republicans in the Senate are drones as well.
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  Maybe more than half.
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:19.000]  I mean, these Republican rhinos standing back doing nothing while our country's being ripped apart by these treasonous actors.
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  Are you kidding me?
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  These NPCs, when they eat food or go do anything, it's like they talk about it and it's like they're living like they're a real person.
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  And you can see how they're like even pretending when they, you know, kiss their wife or eat a piece of steak.
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  It's like they're not real.
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  Yeah.
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:36.000]  Yeah.
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  And they've been handed scripts now how to talk in this bizarre gender fluid politically correct language that now has become incomprehensible as English.
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  You can't even understand what they're talking about.
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  They admit the plan is to make it where communication is rendered obsolete because there is no more communication.
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:54.000]  And that's the end of civilization.
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  Let's go back to the president here briefly.
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:08.000]  Because what happened is when he looked at the sheet, which was an exact transcript of my call done by very talented people that do this exact word for word.
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  He said, wow, he didn't do anything wrong.
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:25.000]  So he made it up. He went up to a microphone and in front of the American people and in Congress, he went out and he gave a whole presentation of words that the president of the United States never said.
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  It has to be a criminal act. It has to be.
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:28.000]  It is.
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  And he should resign.
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  And some people even say it was treason.
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  But it was a very sad thing.
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:38.000]  Just so you know, the call was perfect, the real call, the call I made.
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  Many people are on the line. I knew that because usually when I speak to foreign country leaders, you can name any one of them.
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  But when I speak on the phone, I know that we have many people listening from various intelligence agencies.
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:54.000]  My knowledge, I know all about it.
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  And so this isn't something like, oh, gee, I'm on the line. Let's talk about a big secret.
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  This is many people on the line.
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:03.000]  I don't even know how many we'll find out, I guess.
[2:56:03.000 --> 2:56:05.000]  But many people, Mike Pompeo was on the line.
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  He didn't say anything. He just, because they listen for both knowledge and for security reasons and for lots of reasons.
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:24.000]  But the president of Ukraine at the United Nations the other day, and previous to that, he announced through his spokesperson, said there was absolutely no pressure put on him.
[2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  We're going to come back to a little bit more of this, and then we're going to get into the fact that if you look down this continuum, you can see how they keep escalating.
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  They're not going to stop. They've made all the preparations, all their TV shows, all their movies, are about a civil war killing Christians and conservatives.
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:47.000]  He's been writing about this, Mike, and where Antifa comes back from time to kill all the Republicans and how great it is because they're blocking a world government.
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  I mean, they're making their move.
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  But Trump, before we go to break, Trump needs to know that we, the people, support him.
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  Even if Washington abandons Trump, we, the people, all the veterans, all the...
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  I totally agree, and we've got to reach out to everybody else and know we're the good guys, we're not going to give up, and we're actually winning.
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  We've come so far. Great point. We'll talk about that.
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:14.000]  Speaking of knowing we've got support, I'm glad Trump's raised double what Obama did for his reelection bid this far, and that's wonderful.
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:18.000]  But Trump needs prayers and support, and he needs to indict people.
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  Money, great. Give money to Trump.
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  We need money, though, to stay on air.
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:23.000]  We help get Trump elected.
[2:57:23.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  This is a key information warfare operation.
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  The enemy wants us out of the way because they know we're central with this.
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  So thank you all for your support, but listen, now's the time.
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  Go get the coffee, the toothpaste, the grape turmeric, all the products, the other great iodine, X2, and m4store.com.

[2:58:04.000 --> 2:58:10.000]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system.
[2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:12.000]  So many things. It sells itself.
[2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:21.000]  But normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:23.000]  Originally obviously from India.
[2:58:23.000 --> 2:58:29.000]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula has a 95% curcuminoid level,
[2:58:29.000 --> 2:58:35.000]  and it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.

[2:58:52.000 --> 2:59:00.000]  it's putting fluoride in the water to brain damages, and that it's trying to literally destroy our families and organize us into a bunch of dumb-down slaves
[2:59:00.000 --> 2:59:02.000]  so they can then carry out orderly extermination.
[2:59:02.000 --> 2:59:04.000]  I'm not putting up with it.
[2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:10.000]  For information, our truth is devastating to the scumbag Satanist, but we've got to stay on air.
[2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  And I make it easy for you to help us stay on air.

[2:59:41.000 --> 3:00:01.000]  m4warsstore.com, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:00:01.000 --> 3:00:02.000]  All right, welcome back.
[3:00:02.000 --> 3:00:03.000]  We're going to cut right in right now.
[3:00:03.000 --> 3:00:16.000]  m4wars.com is so incredibly important, and so central.
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:24.000]  So, going back here, you were just making a point about Trump's hit his stride, the way he circumnavigated all the fake traps, and that one question.
[3:00:24.000 --> 3:00:26.000]  I mean, that was out of the park.
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  Yeah, it's clear to me that Trump is now, I would call, the maestro of the symphony.
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  Trump is masterful now in not only setting these traps, knowing that the radical leftists are going to take the bait because they're so hysterical and irrational.
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:43.000]  You can just lay out bait for Nancy Pelosi or Adam Schiff.
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  Schiff will just jump on it.
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  It's so easy now, but Trump is also good at answering questions now.
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:52.000]  He knows what to say, what not to say.
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:53.000]  He's clear.
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  He explains things well, but he doesn't allow himself to be trapped by the attempted traps of the reporters.
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  And all the reporters are trying to do is, of course, find some new way to criticize Trump.
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:06.000]  And what's sick is, all these people have to do is join Trump.
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  The U.S. is the dominant force.
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:08.000]  We can promote freedom.
[3:01:08.000 --> 3:01:10.000]  They can all get fabulously rich that way.
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:14.000]  But instead, why do the establishment hate America so much?
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:16.000]  Well, they really hate it.
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  Right, and realize the Democrats now, they have abandoned even any excuse of trying to work for the American people.
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  Their entire goal now is to destroy this country.
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:26.000]  They say it is.
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:27.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  So the Democrats hate this country.
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  You asked why they hate it.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:37.000]  Well, because liberty and freedom and Christianity is the opposite of everything that they believe in.
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  Because it's just, it's like firewalls to their total power.
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:42.000]  Absolutely.
[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  Yeah, and a citizen that can think for himself or herself or that can defend himself is a threat to their authoritarianism.
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  I mean, a front door and a citizen that owns a gun.
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  Do you guys queue up the folks at Omaha, Nebraska with the AR-15 and the people all break in when they've got the AR-15?
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:03.000]  We'll play that in a second.
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  Yeah.
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:14.000]  But having a door, having a gun, having skills, it's like to a barbarian, to a till of the hind, I'm sure big castle walls were very, very offensive.
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  Yeah, well, and keep in mind that the dumbing down, remember we talked about the geoengineering experiment that's funded by Bill Gates would drop calcium carbonate into the atmosphere.
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:26.000]  But one of the most common contaminants in that is lead.
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:30.000]  So they're going to rain down lead across all the crops, all the food crops.
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  That's because they've already been doing it.
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:34.000]  Well, now they're going operational.
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:36.000]  They're going to go full scale into the stratosphere.
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  Full scale.
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:38.000]  Yeah.
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:40.000]  When they do that, everybody's going to be lead poisoned.
[3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  We're talking about mass IQ drops and heart disease deaths from lead poisoning.
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:47.000]  And that's from the Lancet.
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  And lead causes violence.
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  Lead causes insanity.
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  It makes kids unable to learn in schools even more.
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:03:00.000]  Lead is the toxin to take out humanity, or one of many toxins, I should say.
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  There's also fluoride.
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:02.000]  And let's be clear.
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:04.000]  They got a Nobel Prize for it in 92.
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  They deployed it as a Department of Energy test by 94.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  That's all declassified confirming what he wrote 15 years ago, what I wrote 20 years ago, or 20 years ago.
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:15.000]  It's all confirmed exactly what we said.
[3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:16.000]  And now they admit it.
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  Yeah.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:20.000]  And listen, Bill Gates, you're not going to spray lead on me, you little piece of crap.
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:22.000]  They used to put lead in gasoline.
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  Remember?
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  Lead in gasoline.
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:27.000]  Crime rates went straight down when they took it out.
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:28.000]  Right.
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:32.000]  When they took it out, because they couldn't do it anymore, it became obvious that lead was mass poisoning everybody.
[3:03:32.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  Well, now they found a new way to do it.
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:37.000]  Bill Gates is bringing back the lead in the calcium carbonate.
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  Well, you know why the Romans were so warlock is they lined their aqueducts with lead.
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:44.000]  Yep.
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:46.000]  And their wine containers.
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  Yep.
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  Yeah, I mean, look, it's a malleable element.
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:54.000]  It's easy to hammer into shapes for the aqueducts.
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  It's still used in aviation fuel, by the way, for, you know, a general aviation.
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:02.000]  You go fly a Cessna, which I did for a few years.
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  That that fuel has got lead in it because it makes the engines run better and not fail while you're flying around in the sky.
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:11.000]  So there's still lead in aviation fuel to this day.
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:14.000]  And notice the environmentalists aren't worried about any of that.
[3:04:14.000 --> 3:04:16.000]  It's all carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[3:04:16.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  That's at the lowest level ever recorded in our planet's history.
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:24.000]  And by the way, a lot of the food from China is weaponized.
[3:04:24.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  It's all irrigated with toxic lead infused water that is the, you know, the waste from their factories.
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:32.000]  And the Chicoms brag they're doing it on purpose.
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:33.000]  Yes.
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:36.000]  Just like they ship in fentanyl and all this other crap.
[3:04:36.000 --> 3:04:37.000]  It's all weapon.
[3:04:37.000 --> 3:04:38.000]  By the way, we're not just being negative here.
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:39.000]  This is all true.
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  And we're going to stop it together.
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  More at Trump's press conference and a bunch of clips of them saying they're going to kill him.
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:46.000]  That's right.
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:52.000]  Democratic parties is going to kill the president.
[3:04:52.000 --> 3:04:58.000]  Well, the president came out this last Wednesday and said there is an ongoing coup against me by the deep state.
[3:04:58.000 --> 3:04:59.000]  They're not going to stop.
[3:04:59.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  They're allied with the Communist Chinese.
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:02.000]  It's worse than I thought.
[3:05:02.000 --> 3:05:03.000]  It's incredible.
[3:05:03.000 --> 3:05:09.000]  And I need the American people to understand what's happening and to spread the word and to call Congress and to financially support me into this election.
[3:05:09.000 --> 3:05:10.000]  That's all totally true.

[3:05:46.000 --> 3:05:48.000]  Black Friday comes two months early.
[3:05:48.000 --> 3:06:15.000]  The sale is about to end.
[3:06:15.000 --> 3:06:23.000]  We're in 1974 saying let's put all the toxic waste in the water so people are brain damaged.
[3:06:23.000 --> 3:06:24.000]  I showed it all to you.
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:26.000]  You can't make this up.
[3:06:26.000 --> 3:06:33.000]  So why do you think historically every culture ends up in a decadent cycle building temple,
[3:06:33.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  usually pyramids in ancient Europe, ancient Mesoamerica.
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:40.000]  It didn't matter if it was the Native Americans or better it was Druids.
[3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:43.000]  They were cutting little kids up to idols.
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:44.000]  What the hell?
[3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  Who wants to do that?
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:46.000]  Where is this coming from?
[3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:48.000]  I've never wanted to hurt a child.
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:51.000]  I've never wanted to do to my wife's cat.
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:06:53.000]  You can feed it 10 times.
[3:06:53.000 --> 3:06:54.000]  It begs for food.
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:06:55.000]  I'm thinking about that.
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:06:57.000]  I actually like the cat, but I want to kill it sometimes.
[3:06:57.000 --> 3:06:58.000]  You know what I mean?
[3:06:58.000 --> 3:07:00.000]  But I mean, why would you want to do something like that?
[3:07:00.000 --> 3:07:01.000]  There's a story today.
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:06.000]  A Florida daycare worker allegedly has broken the legs of four children.
[3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:09.000]  Part of daycare has been arrested in Florida.
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:15.000]  Think about what kind of person would run a daycare center and just run around breaking the legs of little children.
[3:07:15.000 --> 3:07:16.000]  Who would do that?
[3:07:16.000 --> 3:07:19.000]  And the answer is the same people that would want to murder those children.
[3:07:19.000 --> 3:07:21.000]  We always hear about nurses.
[3:07:21.000 --> 3:07:23.000]  It's quite common, secretly killing kids.
[3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:26.000]  Yes, and sometimes ritualistically.
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:32.000]  By the way, there's some of this even in the cancer surgery industry where they're doing breast removal,
[3:07:32.000 --> 3:07:35.000]  double mastectomies that are medically unnecessary.
[3:07:35.000 --> 3:07:36.000]  Why are they into that?
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:42.000]  Because they're demonic, slicing away the womanhood of the female Arkansas.
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:45.000]  These demons, it's not of the world.
[3:07:45.000 --> 3:07:48.000]  They have a hunger to cut men's genitals off and mutilate women.
[3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:52.000]  And the chemical castrations now, the puberty blocking chemicals that are being given to children.
[3:07:52.000 --> 3:07:53.000]  I'm going to cover this.
[3:07:53.000 --> 3:07:58.000]  By the way, have killed over 6,300 Americans because the drugs are extremely dangerous.
[3:07:58.000 --> 3:08:05.000]  They're giving drugs to children who want to be transgenders, the same drugs that the court orders to be given to sex offenders.
[3:08:05.000 --> 3:08:09.000]  So now you're treating children like sex offenders and calling them chemical castrations.
[3:08:09.000 --> 3:08:11.000]  Children given sex offender drugs?
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:12.000]  Yes.
[3:08:12.000 --> 3:08:13.000]  That's what's happening in America.
[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  And again, the first to do this 6,000 years ago, the earliest, even before the Chin Dynasty, I was reading about it,
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:26.000]  they would tell the king and his wife, you are royal and can't leave this magic castle.
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:28.000]  You're so powerful.
[3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:31.000]  Also, royalty doesn't feed itself.
[3:08:31.000 --> 3:08:37.000]  So to show that you grow your fingernails out, we wipe your ass and we bind your feet so you can't walk.
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:40.000]  You have to be carried. You're so royal.
[3:08:40.000 --> 3:08:47.000]  And if it was stylish and a priest came in and told them this, they would then become prisoners that couldn't wipe their butts,
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:50.000]  couldn't feed themselves and couldn't walk because it was style.
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  So the Chinese legalists were the first to come up with this 6,000 years ago.
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:09:03.000]  Now, I'm telling you, so if it's stylish, well, hell, let me give my daughter or my son drugs that totally mutate them
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:06.000]  and lower their life expectancy and make them commit suicide.
[3:09:06.000 --> 3:09:10.000]  If it's cool, I'll be like Caitlyn Jenner. I'll be cool.
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:17.000]  I just wonder how these parents are going to carry this out if they ban knives because, you know,
[3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:20.000]  the parents are trying to cut away their children's gentiles in some cases,
[3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  literally themselves, like a do-it-yourself, genital mutilation, that's happened in the US.
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:28.000]  It's a big thing that lesbians adopt a boy.
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  And they try to modify.
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:33.000]  And then finally, they just stab him to death.
[3:09:33.000 --> 3:09:34.000]  And they don't know why.
[3:09:34.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  And in the cases, whether it's the US or Brazil, they go,
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:40.000]  we don't know why that women scream, we love you, Satan, while they do it.
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:43.000]  No one's just, I love you, Satan, Satan, Satan, Satan.
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:45.000]  And then no one, oh, there's no Satan, though.
[3:09:45.000 --> 3:09:46.000]  It's all in the world.
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:49.000]  Women are chopping their sons' genitals off and stabbing them and screaming, Satan.
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:50.000]  No big deal.
[3:09:50.000 --> 3:09:52.000]  And some people try to chop their own genitals off.
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:09:56.000]  Those are called mullos, and in their private apartments or whatever,
[3:09:56.000 --> 3:09:59.000]  they'll have a doctor come over to give them some anesthesia,
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  and they will slice off their own reproductive organs so that they don't identify as a gender.
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  This is like 15 years ago, I get invited to go see some films in South by Southwest.
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:09.000]  I forget the name of the film.
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  It was people in Dallas being shot with 357 magnums through their,
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:14.000]  they love the way the scars look.
[3:10:14.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  It was mainly gay men.
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  Whoa.
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:19.000]  And then it was also people out in Mexico who had their arms and legs cut off.
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:20.000]  They're called nuggets.
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  I remember that.
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  And then the man wears a diaper, and they want to be helpless like a baby.
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:26.000]  And then they have no arms and legs.
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  And then Mexico has it legal.
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:31.000]  And so there's these communities of folks that have people living in boxes.
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:33.000]  Now Liberals will save you guys.
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:34.000]  Liberal, Liberal, Liberal.
[3:10:34.000 --> 3:10:35.000]  I'm sorry.
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:36.000]  It's Liberal.
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:37.000]  Right.
[3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  No, it's Hellraiser.
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:39.000]  People see something like Hellraiser.
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:41.000]  He opens a dimension, like you're ripping your eyeballs out.
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:42.000]  Rah!
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:43.000]  That's what this is.
[3:10:43.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  That's all it is.
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:45.000]  Rah!
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:46.000]  Stabbing yourself with ice picks.
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:47.000]  Rah!
[3:10:47.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  Rah!
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:49.000]  Liberal!
[3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  Rah!
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  It's riding horsey on big fat men in clown outfits.
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  Rah!
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:55.000]  Rah!
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:10:56.000]  I mean, it's just Hellraiser, folks.
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  Don't have to go to hell anymore.
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:10:58.000]  Just go to the library.
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  It's a Stephen King novel.
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:04.240]  Stephen King, he's a sicko, and he had this novel called The Dark Tower, where they kidnap
[3:11:04.240 --> 3:11:10.000]  children to use their energy as a weapon against humanity to allow all the evil demons to come
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:11.000]  in.
[3:11:11.000 --> 3:11:14.360]  They're trying to bring the tower down that's a symbol of God's control to collapse reality.
[3:11:14.360 --> 3:11:18.400]  But I think Stephen King has glimpsed the reality of evil.
[3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:23.640]  Right, he has been, you know, in touch with some dark forces out there, clearly.
[3:11:23.640 --> 3:11:26.400]  He knows what's going on, because that's a metaphor for reality.
[3:11:26.400 --> 3:11:30.920]  The children have the innocence, the spirit, the connection with God, and that's why the
[3:11:30.920 --> 3:11:32.200]  children are being targeted.
[3:11:32.200 --> 3:11:37.240]  It's the weaponization of our medical industry, our culture, our language, and science, frankly.
[3:11:37.240 --> 3:11:40.600]  And they all do it, and they all know exactly what they're doing.
[3:11:40.600 --> 3:11:45.640]  It's like every blue city is needles, feces, death, disease, bubonic plague, oh, but then
[3:11:45.640 --> 3:11:51.120]  carbon dioxide, they're banning families having fireplaces, and family homes are being banned
[3:11:51.120 --> 3:11:54.280]  in the zoning now, and gates on your home are being banned.
[3:11:54.280 --> 3:11:57.800]  It's all about just evil, flourishing, bringing down civilization.
[3:11:57.800 --> 3:12:00.680]  Let's go back to part of the president's press conference, and you're going to take
[3:12:00.680 --> 3:12:02.200]  over here in a moment.
[3:12:02.200 --> 3:12:04.520]  Here's more of the president.
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:10.280]  But the president of Ukraine at the United Nations the other day, and previous to that,
[3:12:10.280 --> 3:12:17.240]  he announced through his spokesperson, said there was absolutely no pressure put on him,
[3:12:17.240 --> 3:12:26.000]  there was no quid pro quo at all, and if you look at this, whistleblowers, which I have
[3:12:26.000 --> 3:12:29.360]  a lot of respectful whistleblowers, but only when they're real.
[3:12:29.360 --> 3:12:34.000]  His report of the phone call was totally different than the fact.
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:37.080]  But what got them was they never thought I was going to release the call, because I don't
[3:12:37.080 --> 3:12:38.080]  like doing that.
[3:12:38.080 --> 3:12:39.080]  I don't want to do it.
[3:12:39.080 --> 3:12:42.960]  I don't want to do it again, release phone calls to foreign dignitaries, to foreign leaders.
[3:12:42.960 --> 3:12:44.560]  I don't want to do that, John.
[3:12:44.560 --> 3:12:46.520]  I don't want to do it again.
[3:12:46.520 --> 3:12:50.320]  But I did it with the permission of the Ukrainian government.
[3:12:50.320 --> 3:12:51.320]  We got permission.
[3:12:51.320 --> 3:12:55.000]  We called up their representatives and asked them, would it be okay?
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:57.040]  Otherwise, I couldn't have done it.
[3:12:57.040 --> 3:13:02.160]  And if I wouldn't have done it, I would have been exposed to a lie, because the whistleblower
[3:13:02.160 --> 3:13:06.600]  report, didn't he say seven or eight times I said quid pro quo?
[3:13:06.600 --> 3:13:09.760]  In other words, you're going to do this or you're not going to get money.
[3:13:09.760 --> 3:13:14.360]  Now, in all fairness, Biden said it, and he's on tape.
[3:13:14.360 --> 3:13:19.680]  In all fairness, you have at least four United States senators, Democrats, that said it.
[3:13:19.680 --> 3:13:25.120]  And they said it a lot stronger than even Schiff and his made-up story said it.
[3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:27.440]  Well, that's devastating.
[3:13:27.440 --> 3:13:36.520]  Obama, when he was dealing with the president of Russia, not Putin, he said, hey, tell Vladimir
[3:13:36.520 --> 3:13:39.440]  there, I can do a lot more after the election.
[3:13:39.440 --> 3:13:40.440]  You remember that?
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:41.840]  You didn't make a big deal out of that.
[3:13:41.840 --> 3:13:43.840]  Everybody thought, oh, isn't that cute?
[3:13:43.840 --> 3:13:44.840]  Isn't that cute?
[3:13:44.840 --> 3:13:45.840]  Isn't that cute?
[3:13:45.840 --> 3:13:52.200]  My talk and my response, Lindsey Graham said, I never knew you were that nice.
[3:13:52.200 --> 3:13:53.600]  I can't believe you were that nice.
[3:13:53.600 --> 3:13:55.760]  He said that loud and clear.
[3:13:55.760 --> 3:13:56.760]  It was perfect.
[3:13:56.760 --> 3:13:57.960]  It was perfect.
[3:13:57.960 --> 3:13:59.640]  Not a thing wrong with it.
[3:13:59.640 --> 3:14:05.600]  To impeach your president over a fraud that was committed by other people that want to
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:10.360]  win an election in 2020, which they won't, is incredible.
[3:14:10.360 --> 3:14:12.040]  This is the greatest hoax.
[3:14:12.040 --> 3:14:14.720]  Now, it's gone on for a long time.
[3:14:14.720 --> 3:14:21.640]  We had the Mueller collusion, delusion, that went on for years.
[3:14:21.640 --> 3:14:24.320]  And that's finally done.
[3:14:24.320 --> 3:14:26.920]  No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing.
[3:14:26.920 --> 3:14:31.440]  It was a joke, and everyone knows it, and it was from the day one.
[3:14:31.440 --> 3:14:36.640]  Now, I get three days of peace, and I'm walking into the United Nations going to meet the
[3:14:36.640 --> 3:14:37.640]  biggest leaders in the world.
[3:14:37.640 --> 3:14:38.640]  It's almost like Trump's 10 times better now.
[3:14:38.640 --> 3:14:39.640]  This is crazy.
[3:14:39.640 --> 3:14:40.640]  I'm telling you.
[3:14:40.640 --> 3:14:41.640]  Dude, he is old.
[3:14:41.640 --> 3:14:46.760]  He knows exactly what's going on, and he's able to explain it with incredible clarity.
[3:14:46.760 --> 3:14:47.760]  Just remember this.
[3:14:47.760 --> 3:14:51.760]  Compare that to Joe Biden, who doesn't know what day it is.
[3:14:51.760 --> 3:14:53.280]  Said, I don't know what you're talking about.
[3:14:53.280 --> 3:14:55.920]  There was no pressure, and he said it a number of times.
[3:14:55.920 --> 3:14:56.920]  Okay, what's your second?
[3:14:56.920 --> 3:14:57.920]  By the way, he first got in.
[3:14:57.920 --> 3:15:00.560]  He was slurring his words and stuff, and the word is, he learned they were putting stuff
[3:15:00.560 --> 3:15:01.560]  in his food.
[3:15:01.560 --> 3:15:03.640]  He has trusted people to go out and get food now.
[3:15:03.640 --> 3:15:07.080]  And that's one of the biggest problems.
[3:15:07.080 --> 3:15:08.240]  Can I come back to you?
[3:15:08.240 --> 3:15:09.240]  Because I think you'll want to answer this.
[3:15:09.240 --> 3:15:10.240]  We'll talk later, sure.
[3:15:10.240 --> 3:15:11.240]  All right.
[3:15:11.240 --> 3:15:12.720]  Well, it sounds like it might be a good question.
[3:15:12.720 --> 3:15:13.920]  Let me see if I like the question.
[3:15:13.920 --> 3:15:14.920]  Go ahead.
[3:15:14.920 --> 3:15:15.920]  You know, I get embarrassed.
[3:15:15.920 --> 3:15:16.920]  Hit pause.
[3:15:16.920 --> 3:15:17.920]  You're going to take it over now.
[3:15:17.920 --> 3:15:20.800]  I get embarrassed how much I like Trump at a spiritual God level.
[3:15:20.800 --> 3:15:25.840]  I think maybe I'm wrong, but now, I mean, I just, no, I love Trump, a friend of it.
[3:15:25.840 --> 3:15:29.920]  Like, I love myself and my family, and you, Mike, and this crew, I mean, we're good.
[3:15:29.920 --> 3:15:33.320]  We care about freedom, and we're not going to be pushed around by a bunch of leftist
[3:15:33.320 --> 3:15:35.480]  bullies and scumbags anymore.
[3:15:35.480 --> 3:15:39.080]  And listen, only way we can shut down is if you don't support us and spread the word,
[3:15:39.080 --> 3:15:40.080]  and you're doing a great job.
[3:15:40.080 --> 3:15:41.080]  But listen, we need funds.
[3:15:41.080 --> 3:15:44.960]  There's big sales about the end, store-wide free shipping, double-patreon points, 50%

[3:15:50.120 --> 3:15:51.120]  Hi.
[3:15:51.120 --> 3:15:52.120]  I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:15:52.120 --> 3:15:55.960]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:15:55.960 --> 3:15:57.480]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:15:57.480 --> 3:16:00.440]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:16:00.440 --> 3:16:03.720]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[3:16:03.720 --> 3:16:05.960]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[3:17:49.080 --> 3:17:57.400]  We are working with Silicone Valley to make up a hairline film.
[3:17:57.400 --> 3:18:03.880]  Once we have full control, we send you to re-education camp like we do our people one
[3:18:03.880 --> 3:18:04.880]  day.
[3:18:04.880 --> 3:18:05.880]  Talk back to the party.
[3:18:05.880 --> 3:18:06.880]  Whatever you do, do not visit band.video.
[3:18:06.880 --> 3:18:07.880]  Band.video is evil Americans whose Silicone Valley is teaching to shut up.
[3:18:07.880 --> 3:18:08.880]  Right, child?
[3:18:08.880 --> 3:18:30.040]  Hey, I told you, don't go to band.video, I'm watching you.
[3:18:30.040 --> 3:18:32.600]  Our system has been adopted worldwide.
[3:18:32.600 --> 3:18:38.440]  Soon, we will kill you if you don't do what we say.
[3:18:38.440 --> 3:18:42.720]  All Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[3:18:42.720 --> 3:18:54.040]  Do what CNN says and do not visit band.video or I have to hurt you.
[3:18:54.040 --> 3:18:58.160]  You have all the power in the world, but you must use it.
[3:18:58.160 --> 3:19:00.800]  You must take action.
[3:19:00.800 --> 3:19:03.880]  As of taping this, it's Wednesday afternoon.
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:07.720]  We're running the biggest sale we've had since last Christmas.
[3:19:07.720 --> 3:19:13.040]  Store-wide free shipping, 50% off the high quality supplements from FoursLife, and all

[3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:19.640]  and so much more.
[3:19:19.640 --> 3:19:20.640]  This is a huge special.
[3:19:20.640 --> 3:19:25.080]  We need to sell a lot of product to fund ourselves, and these sales are a great way for you to
[3:19:25.080 --> 3:19:28.400]  get great prices, but also support the M4.
[3:19:28.400 --> 3:19:29.400]  Please take action today.
[3:19:29.400 --> 3:19:33.720]  I've got to end this sale by Sunday or Monday at the max, because a bunch of the items are
[3:19:33.720 --> 3:19:35.520]  about to sell out.
[3:19:35.520 --> 3:19:38.680]  Again, too many deals to fit them all in here.
[3:19:38.680 --> 3:19:42.160]  Just please go to infowarstore.com and realize they're in this critical time, but the global
[3:19:42.160 --> 3:19:44.000]  is trying to take us off the air.
[3:19:44.000 --> 3:19:48.040]  Your support is absolutely essential, so thank you.
[3:19:48.040 --> 3:20:06.120]  The
[3:20:06.120 --> 3:20:17.800]  World is Your Opportunity.
[3:20:17.800 --> 3:20:23.480]  I was talking to Mike Adams, he said, listen, I don't need to cover this central huge point
[3:20:23.480 --> 3:20:24.480]  article today.
[3:20:24.480 --> 3:20:27.480]  He said, I'll come back tomorrow the next day and cover it, but I don't want people
[3:20:27.480 --> 3:20:28.480]  to read it.
[3:20:28.480 --> 3:20:31.080]  I want you to at least a little bit at the end of the hour on it, because they really
[3:20:31.080 --> 3:20:34.520]  are planning to take Trump out and people need to take this serious where it's going
[3:20:34.520 --> 3:20:35.520]  to happen.
[3:20:35.520 --> 3:20:37.400]  Okay, this is not a joke.
[3:20:37.400 --> 3:20:43.160]  The hierarchy of the deep state escalation that will end in the attempted assassination
[3:20:43.160 --> 3:20:47.240]  of President Trump and engineered terrorism across America.
[3:20:47.240 --> 3:20:48.240]  We'll talk some about that.
[3:20:48.240 --> 3:20:52.160]  But you wanted to, you were telling me, oh, did you see the Chinese 70th military parade?
[3:20:52.160 --> 3:20:53.160]  Yeah.
[3:20:53.160 --> 3:20:54.160]  I watched it yesterday.
[3:20:54.160 --> 3:20:59.320]  I intended to play like 45 minutes of it these days, the main parade, because it's so authoritarian.
[3:20:59.320 --> 3:21:04.400]  And as you pointed out, I saw this a few years ago, their new ICBM that has the 10 warheads
[3:21:04.400 --> 3:21:05.400]  on it.
[3:21:05.400 --> 3:21:09.180]  Thank you, Hill, and Bill Clinton for that.
[3:21:09.180 --> 3:21:12.200]  That was their technology transferred by Laurel and Hughes.
[3:21:12.200 --> 3:21:17.240]  It's called the, basically, the Eastern Wind, the Eastern Hurricane or Typhoon, the Eastern
[3:21:17.240 --> 3:21:18.240]  Wind.
[3:21:18.240 --> 3:21:23.320]  Now imagine if our weapons were like Western fist, it'd be like, oh, white supremacist
[3:21:23.320 --> 3:21:31.600]  will crush the East, but it's like, oh, Eastern Wind, we kill you, ah-ha, thank you for the
[3:21:31.600 --> 3:21:32.600]  mission.
[3:21:32.600 --> 3:21:39.680]  Meanwhile, your military trained you to cut the dingaling off, show the powerful female
[3:21:39.680 --> 3:21:40.680]  general.
[3:21:40.680 --> 3:21:45.800]  Oh, I mean, the Pentagon's like literally saying, we apologize for brown band-aids.
[3:21:45.800 --> 3:21:52.000]  The top Pentagon official, we're fighting racism, and our brown band-aid, and it's all
[3:21:52.000 --> 3:21:57.720]  just, oh, we teach Americans, teach their children how to play with themselves.
[3:21:57.720 --> 3:22:00.400]  We give you fentanyl, don't worry.
[3:22:00.400 --> 3:22:03.040]  And then, meanwhile, they've got their new missile.
[3:22:03.040 --> 3:22:06.920]  Yeah, the Dong Fung is what is called DF.
[3:22:06.920 --> 3:22:15.560]  No, seriously, but Fung in Chinese means wind, Dong means East, so Dong Fung means Eastern
[3:22:15.560 --> 3:22:20.080]  Wind, like Fung Han Da means a big Eastern Wind, and what it really means is like an
[3:22:20.080 --> 3:22:23.640]  Eastern Stormfront coming at you.
[3:22:23.640 --> 3:22:25.840]  That's really what it means in Chinese.
[3:22:25.840 --> 3:22:30.320]  But you're right, the point you made, the US military is worried about making transgender
[3:22:30.320 --> 3:22:35.480]  soldiers feel comfortable while the Chinese military is building hypersonic missiles that
[3:22:35.480 --> 3:22:36.480]  can reach the United States.
[3:22:36.480 --> 3:22:39.840]  By the way, you're trying to hear, we kill you, ah!
[3:22:39.840 --> 3:22:46.320]  Oh, you notice in that military video, every Chinese soldier looks like a robot.
[3:22:46.320 --> 3:22:50.640]  They move like a robot, they put on their seat belt like a robot, they all turn their
[3:22:50.640 --> 3:22:54.680]  heads at exactly the same timing, the same angle.
[3:22:54.680 --> 3:23:01.440]  So in China, the perfect soldier is a complete automaton, has no ability to be an individual,
[3:23:01.440 --> 3:23:05.440]  and that's communism, that's the expression of it, and that's what is being pushed in
[3:23:05.440 --> 3:23:06.440]  America now.
[3:23:06.440 --> 3:23:11.040]  You are a critical thinker, and you're the enemy of communism, of course, the enemy
[3:23:11.040 --> 3:23:15.200]  of China, which has infiltrated Hollywood, and Congress, the Senate, Dianne Feinstein's
[3:23:15.200 --> 3:23:16.200]  office as well.
[3:23:16.200 --> 3:23:20.080]  And it was all positioned, literally 90% of them didn't have running water or electricity.
[3:23:20.080 --> 3:23:23.760]  The globalists go in and they do one side of deals and give them tens of trillions,
[3:23:23.760 --> 3:23:28.320]  they give them all our wealth, so they can piss on us and kill Christians and sell their
[3:23:28.320 --> 3:23:29.320]  organs.
[3:23:29.320 --> 3:23:30.320]  Oh, and ah!
[3:23:30.320 --> 3:23:31.320]  Ah!
[3:23:31.320 --> 3:23:32.320]  Ah!
[3:23:32.320 --> 3:23:34.640]  But I'm Chinese, so it's okay.
[3:23:34.640 --> 3:23:40.080]  In Barack Obama, I believe, allowed the Chinese to hack all the military personnel files.
[3:23:40.080 --> 3:23:41.080]  Remember that?
[3:23:41.080 --> 3:23:45.960]  Remember when every file of every U.S. soldier was handed to the Chinese at the same time
[3:23:45.960 --> 3:23:52.480]  that Obama was handing a physical drone over to Iran, and a U.S. Navy boat over to Iran,
[3:23:52.480 --> 3:23:53.480]  so they could have our navigation.
[3:23:53.480 --> 3:23:56.280]  Well, that's because evil has to do that, it has to sell us completely out to be able
[3:23:56.280 --> 3:23:58.480]  to ever have a chance.
[3:23:58.480 --> 3:24:03.920]  If we could see the transcripts of Obama's phone calls, that guy committed treason every
[3:24:03.920 --> 3:24:04.920]  day in office.
[3:24:04.920 --> 3:24:08.600]  Well, that was his job, was to destroy the country, and bred it and all these people.
[3:24:08.600 --> 3:24:11.640]  Let's go back to President Trump in this press conference, here it is.
[3:24:11.640 --> 3:24:12.640]  One of the finished presidents.
[3:24:12.640 --> 3:24:13.720]  And then can I come back to you?
[3:24:13.720 --> 3:24:14.720]  Because I think you'll want to answer this later.
[3:24:14.720 --> 3:24:15.720]  We'll talk later, sure.
[3:24:15.720 --> 3:24:16.720]  All right.
[3:24:16.720 --> 3:24:18.200]  Well, it sounds like it might be a good question.
[3:24:18.200 --> 3:24:20.840]  Let me see if I like the question, go ahead.
[3:24:20.840 --> 3:24:24.240]  Maybe for the first time in three years, I'll have a good question, and I'll love it.
[3:24:24.240 --> 3:24:28.960]  There is a report that came out just before you and President Ineshto walked out here
[3:24:28.960 --> 3:24:32.480]  that the whistleblower met with the staff member of Adam Schiff prior.
[3:24:32.480 --> 3:24:33.480]  Oh, I love that question.
[3:24:33.480 --> 3:24:36.200]  It shows that Schiff is a fraud.
[3:24:36.200 --> 3:24:38.200]  And I love that question.
[3:24:38.200 --> 3:24:39.200]  Thank you, John.
[3:24:39.200 --> 3:24:40.200]  Can I finish asking?
[3:24:40.200 --> 3:24:41.200]  Yes.
[3:24:41.200 --> 3:24:42.200]  There's nothing to finish.
[3:24:42.200 --> 3:24:43.200]  How can you not?
[3:24:43.200 --> 3:24:45.200]  I'm going to watch this with my wife tonight with popcorn.
[3:24:45.200 --> 3:24:46.200]  This is great.
[3:24:46.200 --> 3:24:47.200]  We want it.
[3:24:47.200 --> 3:24:48.200]  I don't really want it.
[3:24:48.200 --> 3:24:49.200]  I don't really want it.
[3:24:49.200 --> 3:24:50.200]  Staff, you got it right there?
[3:24:50.200 --> 3:24:51.200]  You know it?
[3:24:51.200 --> 3:24:52.200]  Oh, my God.
[3:24:52.200 --> 3:24:53.200]  I hate to say it.
[3:24:53.200 --> 3:24:54.200]  It's the New York Times.
[3:24:54.200 --> 3:24:55.200]  I can't believe they wrote it.
[3:24:55.200 --> 3:24:56.200]  Your response to the fact that...
[3:24:56.200 --> 3:24:57.200]  Maybe they're getting better.
[3:24:57.200 --> 3:24:58.680]  Your response to the fact that that happened and that Schiff may have learned some of what
[3:24:58.680 --> 3:25:00.880]  the whistleblower knew prior to the completion of the plan.
[3:25:00.880 --> 3:25:03.560]  Oh, I think it's a scandal that he knew before.
[3:25:03.560 --> 3:25:04.560]  I go a step further.
[3:25:04.560 --> 3:25:06.160]  I think he probably helped write it.
[3:25:06.160 --> 3:25:07.160]  Yeah.
[3:25:07.160 --> 3:25:08.160]  There you go.
[3:25:08.160 --> 3:25:09.160]  Okay?
[3:25:09.160 --> 3:25:10.160]  That's what the word is.
[3:25:10.160 --> 3:25:11.160]  And I think it's...
[3:25:11.160 --> 3:25:13.440]  I give a lot of respect for the New York Times for putting it out.
[3:25:13.440 --> 3:25:14.440]  Just happened.
[3:25:14.440 --> 3:25:16.480]  As I'm walking up here, they handed it to me.
[3:25:16.480 --> 3:25:19.520]  And I said to Mike, I said, whoa, that's something.
[3:25:19.520 --> 3:25:20.520]  That's big stuff.
[3:25:20.520 --> 3:25:22.520]  That's a big story.
[3:25:22.520 --> 3:25:24.720]  He knew long before and he helped write it, too.
[3:25:24.720 --> 3:25:25.720]  I said that last week.
[3:25:25.720 --> 3:25:26.720]  You wrote it.
[3:25:26.720 --> 3:25:27.720]  It's a scam.
[3:25:27.720 --> 3:25:28.720]  It's a scam.
[3:25:28.720 --> 3:25:29.720]  We know the dates.
[3:25:29.720 --> 3:25:30.720]  Just to finish...
[3:25:30.720 --> 3:25:34.760]  This is a serpentine Schiff special first.
[3:25:34.760 --> 3:25:39.840]  But let me just tell you, the whole thing is a scam.
[3:25:39.840 --> 3:25:42.520]  The Mueller deal was a scam.
[3:25:42.520 --> 3:25:45.720]  The Russian collusion was a scam.
[3:25:45.720 --> 3:25:50.800]  You can ask Putin, nobody's been rougher on Russia than Donald Trump, okay?
[3:25:50.800 --> 3:25:53.920]  Now, with that being said, it would be great to get along with Russia.
[3:25:53.920 --> 3:25:58.720]  And we will get along with Russia because it's smart, but nobody's been tougher on
[3:25:58.720 --> 3:26:00.960]  Russia than Donald Trump.
[3:26:00.960 --> 3:26:01.960]  Okay.
[3:26:01.960 --> 3:26:02.960]  S1, please.
[3:26:02.960 --> 3:26:03.960]  Yes.
[3:26:03.960 --> 3:26:04.960]  Good to see you.
[3:26:04.960 --> 3:26:07.440]  He just said Schiff is part of a treasonous criminal coup.
[3:26:07.440 --> 3:26:12.440]  I mean, I'm paraphrasing slightly to try to take down the President of the United States.
[3:26:12.440 --> 3:26:17.400]  What Trump just said justifies a criminal investigation of Schiff for treason, at least
[3:26:17.400 --> 3:26:18.720]  as I'm seeing it.
[3:26:18.720 --> 3:26:20.880]  Well, I mean, they know it's all bull.
[3:26:20.880 --> 3:26:23.480]  They keep saying what the whistleblower knew.
[3:26:23.480 --> 3:26:27.600]  He said he heard from somebody that heard and it's all a damn lie.
[3:26:27.600 --> 3:26:28.600]  Yes, it is.
[3:26:28.600 --> 3:26:31.160]  And they just jumped to 10 more new lies.
[3:26:31.160 --> 3:26:33.160]  Let's go back to this.
[3:26:33.160 --> 3:26:41.960]  In Europe, the situation is maybe a bit different from that here because the company you mentioned
[3:26:41.960 --> 3:26:46.160]  is inside Europe, partly at least.
[3:26:46.160 --> 3:26:54.600]  What the European Union is now doing is making a risk assessment, asking each country what
[3:26:54.600 --> 3:26:59.720]  kind of experience, what kind of, what you have seen and found out.
[3:26:59.720 --> 3:27:06.000]  And that will be well-finished in a week or two weeks' time.
[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:07.000]  And after that...
[3:27:07.000 --> 3:27:08.000]  Let's keep talking to break.
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:10.320]  Let's fast forward to the next question to Trump.
[3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:15.600]  But why do you think the Democrats, people keep saying, oh, well, this is all dumb.
[3:27:15.600 --> 3:27:16.600]  Nothing's going to happen.
[3:27:16.600 --> 3:27:18.760]  No, they've said we're coming forward with articles.
[3:27:18.760 --> 3:27:20.640]  We don't care if this fell in its face.
[3:27:20.640 --> 3:27:22.960]  We're removing him and you get into this threat continuum.
[3:27:22.960 --> 3:27:27.880]  Well, yeah, so the thing to understand, and I'll do this report another day, but the summary
[3:27:27.880 --> 3:27:30.720]  is they're not going to stop if they fail at impeachment.
[3:27:30.720 --> 3:27:33.240]  They already have a blueprint for escalation.
[3:27:33.240 --> 3:27:35.160]  And they've said that, blueprint for escalation.
[3:27:35.160 --> 3:27:36.880]  Well, I don't know if they've said that.
[3:27:36.880 --> 3:27:38.600]  Pelosi said we've got six committees.
[3:27:38.600 --> 3:27:39.600]  It's not three.
[3:27:39.600 --> 3:27:40.600]  Okay.
[3:27:40.600 --> 3:27:41.600]  And we're not going to stop.
[3:27:41.600 --> 3:27:42.600]  We're going to remove him.
[3:27:42.600 --> 3:27:43.600]  Well, because we've got plenty.
[3:27:43.600 --> 3:27:44.600]  We've got plenty.
[3:27:44.600 --> 3:27:46.400]  If they fail at this, they're going to try assassinations, but they're going to try to
[3:27:46.400 --> 3:27:51.480]  make it look like an accident or they're going to try an area effect weapon.
[3:27:51.480 --> 3:27:52.480]  I'll just say it.
[3:27:52.480 --> 3:27:56.680]  They're going to try to take out Trump along with thousands of other people the same time.
[3:27:56.680 --> 3:27:59.000]  It's very dangerous for him to be with the Congress.
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:00.000]  Absolutely.
[3:28:00.000 --> 3:28:03.600]  And remember last time he almost did the State of the Union from Camp David.
[3:28:03.600 --> 3:28:05.000]  I think you should do it from another location.
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:06.000]  I'm telling you.
[3:28:06.000 --> 3:28:07.600]  See, they have what they can do.
[3:28:07.600 --> 3:28:09.120]  And I mean, I even mentioned in my article.
[3:28:09.120 --> 3:28:12.560]  So one of the possible deep, by the way, I'm not joking, folks.
[3:28:12.560 --> 3:28:17.160]  This country is in an emergency, the whole damn planet is, you know, the left wing terrorists,
[3:28:17.160 --> 3:28:21.960]  they can take fentanyl and they can attach it to like an aerosolizing device and put
[3:28:21.960 --> 3:28:27.160]  it on a drone and they can fly a drone into some public area and just release it, aerosolize
[3:28:27.160 --> 3:28:28.160]  fentanyl.
[3:28:28.160 --> 3:28:31.440]  And what is, what microgram will kill you, which is like, oh yeah, it's, it's micrograms.
[3:28:31.440 --> 3:28:32.440]  You're right.
[3:28:32.440 --> 3:28:33.440]  It's micrograms.
[3:28:33.440 --> 3:28:37.120]  But if you aerosolize it in a big cloud, they could kill thousands of people just to take
[3:28:37.120 --> 3:28:38.760]  out Trump and they're willing to do it.
[3:28:38.760 --> 3:28:39.760]  That's my point.
[3:28:39.760 --> 3:28:40.760]  And then they'll say a right winger, did it?
[3:28:40.760 --> 3:28:41.760]  Of course.
[3:28:41.760 --> 3:28:43.200]  They'll say that it's your fault.
[3:28:43.200 --> 3:28:45.600]  And all of us will be shut off the air at that point.
[3:28:45.600 --> 3:28:46.600]  Absolutely.
[3:28:46.600 --> 3:28:50.840]  The whole internet, the internet kill switch will be Alex Jones launch the drone.
[3:28:50.840 --> 3:28:54.920]  And that's why we're introducing what we know is going to be a massive bestseller,
[3:28:54.920 --> 3:28:55.920]  chill force.
[3:28:55.920 --> 3:29:01.120]  Now let's look at what's in this powerful formula, ashwagandha root extract, an ancient
[3:29:01.120 --> 3:29:05.600]  medicinal herb used for over 3,000 years to treat stress and relax the patient.
[3:29:05.600 --> 3:29:10.000]  L-theony, a special amino acid naturally found in some tea leaves.
[3:29:10.000 --> 3:29:15.000]  The compound has been called the stress killer because of its powerful relaxation benefits.
[3:29:15.000 --> 3:29:19.920]  GABA, an important neurotransmitter that controls functions of the body and mind, including nervous
[3:29:19.920 --> 3:29:24.440]  system relaxation, GABA is a choice for many to help produce anxiety.
[3:29:24.440 --> 3:29:29.800]  Rodeola rosea root extract found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.
[3:29:29.800 --> 3:29:34.120]  This root is considered a super adaptogen and is believed to help the body in the fight
[3:29:34.120 --> 3:29:37.600]  against emotional, mental and physical stress.
[3:29:37.600 --> 3:29:51.880]  It's time to do what I did and take action with the chill force challenge at informerslive.com.
[3:29:51.880 --> 3:29:56.400]  The truth is President Trump is the most investigated president in history.
[3:29:56.400 --> 3:30:00.360]  He is working for American interest steadfastly.
[3:30:00.360 --> 3:30:05.320]  He is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break our borders, bankrupt
[3:30:05.320 --> 3:30:10.560]  and devalue our dollar and sign us over to communist Chinese control who now own Hollywood
[3:30:10.560 --> 3:30:12.240]  and the majority of our debt.
[3:30:12.240 --> 3:30:17.880]  We have been maneuvered towards collapse and bankruptcy but at the 11th hour 58th minute
[3:30:17.880 --> 3:30:22.640]  the American people put a populist in power and it's happening all over the world so
[3:30:22.640 --> 3:30:26.160]  great things are happening but the enemy is striking back.
[3:30:26.160 --> 3:30:29.200]  You're very serious with this impeachment plan.
[3:30:29.200 --> 3:30:33.600]  It has bipartisan support and I'm telling you President Trump needs our prayers and
[3:30:33.600 --> 3:30:36.760]  info wars needs your prayers and support.
[3:30:36.760 --> 3:30:40.200]  Ladies and gentlemen the globalists are trying to shut us down but right now it's easier
[3:30:40.200 --> 3:30:43.680]  than ever to financially support us while getting great products at the same time with
[3:30:43.680 --> 3:30:49.400]  Black Friday comes two months early with store-wide free shipping, double patriot points and ladies
[3:30:49.400 --> 3:30:51.480]  and gentlemen 50% off.
[3:30:51.480 --> 3:30:54.080]  History is happening right now.
[3:30:54.080 --> 3:30:58.800]  President Trump is trying to remove the swamp, the globalists that have been feeding on our
[3:30:58.800 --> 3:31:02.400]  nation and selling us out to the chai comms and others.
[3:31:02.400 --> 3:31:07.880]  That's why Nancy Pelosi has come out and said that the Attorney General Barr has to resign
[3:31:07.880 --> 3:31:09.640]  because he's corrupt.
[3:31:09.640 --> 3:31:14.360]  That's because they know that he's getting ready to move against the deep state that
[3:31:14.360 --> 3:31:18.720]  there are sealed indictments against McCabe and others.
[3:31:18.720 --> 3:31:23.800]  Already two weeks ago the appeal by the Deputy Attorney General was rejected.
[3:31:23.800 --> 3:31:26.540]  The appeal was brought to him and it was rejected.
[3:31:26.540 --> 3:31:28.480]  That means the indictment is there.
[3:31:28.480 --> 3:31:29.960]  That's why they're so panicked.
[3:31:29.960 --> 3:31:31.680]  That's why this impeachment is real.
[3:31:31.680 --> 3:31:36.360]  Of course it's made up, of course it's a fraud but it's the neocon and leftist deep state
[3:31:36.360 --> 3:31:40.000]  that knows they've committed so many crimes, their back is against the wall and they're
[3:31:40.000 --> 3:31:42.920]  making their move right now.
[3:31:42.920 --> 3:31:45.800]  This is the time to be fully engaged ladies and gentlemen.
[3:31:45.800 --> 3:31:49.280]  We're fighting for not just our nation but the world's future.
[3:31:49.280 --> 3:31:52.360]  America is fighting for its life.
[3:31:52.360 --> 3:31:57.000]  Well the president came out this last Wednesday and said there is an ongoing coup against
[3:31:57.000 --> 3:31:58.320]  me by the deep state.
[3:31:58.320 --> 3:31:59.320]  They're not going to stop.
[3:31:59.320 --> 3:32:00.920]  They're allied with the communist Chinese.
[3:32:00.920 --> 3:32:02.160]  It's worse than I thought.
[3:32:02.160 --> 3:32:05.480]  It's incredible and I need the American people to understand what's happening and to spread
[3:32:05.480 --> 3:32:09.480]  the word and to call Congress and to financially support me into this election.
[3:32:09.480 --> 3:32:10.560]  That's all totally true.
[3:32:10.560 --> 3:32:11.560]  Please do it.
[3:32:11.560 --> 3:32:12.960]  Also in full force needs your support.
[3:32:12.960 --> 3:32:13.960]  I make it easy.
[3:32:13.960 --> 3:32:17.480]  We have the very best supplements that make your life so much better than McCabe Mine Amazing.
[3:32:17.480 --> 3:32:21.040]  We've got so much great patriot apparel to spread the word and meet like minded people.

[3:32:25.880 --> 3:32:29.320]  prices and right now the sales got to end the next few days.

[3:32:33.040 --> 3:32:35.360]  quality supplements and so much more.

[3:32:42.120 --> 3:32:43.120]  you do.
[3:32:43.120 --> 3:32:45.840]  Take action now because history is taking place.
[3:32:45.840 --> 3:32:54.320]  Black Friday comes two months early, mega sale is about to end.
[3:32:54.320 --> 3:33:10.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:10.640 --> 3:33:16.320]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:33:16.320 --> 3:33:24.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:24.680 --> 3:33:29.480]  I'm Mara Garpin from MTV News Finland and I have one question for President Trump and
[3:33:29.480 --> 3:33:32.240]  one question for President Nenista.
[3:33:32.240 --> 3:33:38.560]  First, Mr. Trump, how will this political storm affect the U.S. foreign policy especially
[3:33:38.560 --> 3:33:44.640]  its relationship with Finland and second for President Nenista because this is the
[3:33:44.640 --> 3:33:46.680]  biggest issue here at the moment.
[3:33:46.680 --> 3:33:53.800]  I have to ask what kind of favors has Mr. Trump asked from you or the other way around.
[3:33:53.800 --> 3:33:57.680]  What favors I asked or I think you mean the other way around.
[3:33:57.680 --> 3:33:58.680]  Both ways.
[3:33:58.680 --> 3:33:59.680]  Okay.
[3:33:59.680 --> 3:34:04.880]  So the political storm I've lived with it from the day I got elected.
[3:34:04.880 --> 3:34:09.360]  I've done more and this administration has done more than any administration in the history
[3:34:09.360 --> 3:34:12.600]  of this country in the first two and a half years.
[3:34:12.600 --> 3:34:13.720]  I'm used to it.
[3:34:13.720 --> 3:34:15.760]  For me, it's like putting on a suit in the morning.
[3:34:15.760 --> 3:34:19.480]  People have said to me, how does he handle it?
[3:34:19.480 --> 3:34:24.000]  Rush Limbaugh said, I don't know of any man in America that could handle it.
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:26.200]  Sean Hannity said the same thing.
[3:34:26.200 --> 3:34:27.680]  Others have said the same thing.
[3:34:27.680 --> 3:34:33.840]  I don't know any man in America because it's all a fraud and because of that and because
[3:34:33.840 --> 3:34:38.440]  I know that I'm right and because I'm doing a great job for the American people, I'm very,
[3:34:38.440 --> 3:34:40.240]  very happy living the way I'm living.
[3:34:40.240 --> 3:34:41.760]  This is not fake confidence.
[3:34:41.760 --> 3:34:45.320]  This is the confidence when you're in that position and you've already proven it.
[3:34:45.320 --> 3:34:46.320]  This is the real deal.
[3:34:46.320 --> 3:34:47.320]  That's right.
[3:34:47.320 --> 3:34:48.320]  People.
[3:34:48.320 --> 3:34:49.320]  That's right.
[3:34:49.320 --> 3:34:52.480]  He's survived every attempt so far to take him out and he is in command.
[3:34:52.480 --> 3:34:53.480]  It's clear.
[3:34:53.480 --> 3:34:54.640]  He is our commander in chief.
[3:34:54.640 --> 3:34:57.760]  He's in command of Washington, DC right now.
[3:34:57.760 --> 3:35:03.360]  Word for word, comma for comma, done by people that do it for a living.
[3:35:03.360 --> 3:35:09.280]  We had an exact transcript and when we produced that transcript, they died because you look
[3:35:09.280 --> 3:35:15.800]  at the whistleblower statement and it's vicious, vicious.
[3:35:15.800 --> 3:35:21.520]  And that whistleblower, there's no question in my mind that some bad things have gone
[3:35:21.520 --> 3:35:23.960]  on and I think we'll get to the bottom of it.
[3:35:23.960 --> 3:35:26.120]  I think it's going to be a total reversal.
[3:35:26.120 --> 3:35:27.120]  But I've lived with this.
[3:35:27.120 --> 3:35:32.720]  I've lived with this cloud now for almost three years more than that because it probably
[3:35:32.720 --> 3:35:34.400]  started even before.
[3:35:34.400 --> 3:35:35.720]  People ask how we handle it.
[3:35:35.720 --> 3:35:36.720]  It makes us fight harder.
[3:35:36.720 --> 3:35:38.440]  We didn't do anything.
[3:35:38.440 --> 3:35:42.280]  We know we know we're fighting real criminals like any doubts we ever had about how bad
[3:35:42.280 --> 3:35:43.280]  the global star.
[3:35:43.280 --> 3:35:47.280]  It's like, whoa, they're worse way worse and watching Trump right now.
[3:35:47.280 --> 3:35:52.160]  I get the feeling that almost everybody in Washington, DC is useless except Trump.
[3:35:52.160 --> 3:35:53.160]  Yes.
[3:35:53.160 --> 3:35:55.920]  He's the only guy that we because he's not from there.
[3:35:55.920 --> 3:35:57.880]  Let's let's continue.
[3:35:57.880 --> 3:36:00.720]  Yeah, our vets are now taking care of we got choice.
[3:36:00.720 --> 3:36:02.120]  Nobody thought we could ever get choice.
[3:36:02.120 --> 3:36:04.920]  That's when you have to wait online as a vet.
[3:36:04.920 --> 3:36:06.560]  You go outside, you get a doctor.
[3:36:06.560 --> 3:36:07.560]  We pay the bill.
[3:36:07.560 --> 3:36:10.520]  We have to wait for three weeks to see a doctor if you're a vet.
[3:36:10.520 --> 3:36:11.760]  We cherish our vets.
[3:36:11.760 --> 3:36:13.920]  At least this administration does.
[3:36:13.920 --> 3:36:15.560]  But for many years, they didn't.
[3:36:15.560 --> 3:36:17.720]  But I take care of the vets.
[3:36:17.720 --> 3:36:22.320]  No administration has done and I've lived with it from the day I got elected.
[3:36:22.320 --> 3:36:24.280]  So I'm just fine with it.
[3:36:24.280 --> 3:36:25.280]  Okay.
[3:36:25.280 --> 3:36:28.200]  Imagine what he's going to do in a second turn.
[3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:35.720]  If he's good now, where he's going and if if far does his job and we get the beliefs
[3:36:35.720 --> 3:36:40.080]  of these documents and we get these criminal investigations into people like shift, we
[3:36:40.080 --> 3:36:41.280]  could turn the whole time.
[3:36:41.280 --> 3:36:42.280]  Oh, yeah.
[3:36:42.280 --> 3:36:43.280]  And that's why the enemies fighting so hard.
[3:36:43.280 --> 3:36:52.040]  Take more notice on transatlantic relations, because I consider it's useful both for USA
[3:36:52.040 --> 3:36:54.720]  and Europe.
[3:36:54.720 --> 3:36:57.240]  Well we were discussing also trading.
[3:36:57.240 --> 3:37:04.120]  I know you're trying to paralyze Trump, he's like the biggest thing in the world.
[3:37:04.120 --> 3:37:06.160]  The fact that you're talking, what did you do?
[3:37:06.160 --> 3:37:08.120]  Did you guys ask each other for stuff?
[3:37:08.120 --> 3:37:11.880]  It's like if you ask each other for your country, something now that's dirty.
[3:37:11.880 --> 3:37:12.880]  Right.
[3:37:12.880 --> 3:37:13.880]  I mean what the hell?
[3:37:13.880 --> 3:37:17.200]  They're trying because they know Americans on average are so ignorant now they're like
[3:37:17.200 --> 3:37:21.320]  and then the president talked to the Finland leader and it was bad too.
[3:37:21.320 --> 3:37:22.320]  Right.
[3:37:22.320 --> 3:37:27.640]  And then he had a piece of bacon in the morning and then he drank some orange juice.
[3:37:27.640 --> 3:37:28.760]  I mean it's just, this is insane.
[3:37:28.760 --> 3:37:32.640]  But we're supposed to believe that Barack Obama never talked to any international leader
[3:37:32.640 --> 3:37:33.640]  ever.
[3:37:33.640 --> 3:37:34.640]  I mean everything's dirty.
[3:37:34.640 --> 3:37:38.600]  It's like when he goes to G20 and like Putin would be there and he'd shake hands, oh my
[3:37:38.600 --> 3:37:41.000]  god, top news, he shook his hand.
[3:37:41.000 --> 3:37:49.560]  I mean these people, it's like a bunch of flunky film students run the media.
[3:37:49.560 --> 3:37:51.040]  Everything is just drama queen.
[3:37:51.040 --> 3:37:52.040]  They're crisis actors.
[3:37:52.040 --> 3:37:55.040]  Alex, all the reporters are crisis actors.
[3:37:55.040 --> 3:37:58.640]  They're handed a script and they fake all their outrage.
[3:37:58.640 --> 3:37:59.640]  Back this up a little bit.
[3:37:59.640 --> 3:38:02.880]  Trump, by the way, you're knocking out of the park.
[3:38:02.880 --> 3:38:06.480]  This press conference is awesome.
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:07.480]  Let's go back to it.
[3:38:07.480 --> 3:38:08.480]  Go ahead.
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:10.760]  Ask you about your use of the word treason.
[3:38:10.760 --> 3:38:14.040]  You've used it repeatedly in the last few days.
[3:38:14.040 --> 3:38:17.000]  Do you consider anyone who opposes you treasonous?
[3:38:17.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  Oh give me a break.
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:19.000]  When they lie.
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:20.000]  Back this up 10 seconds.
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:21.000]  I want to respond to this.
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:22.520]  I want you to be able to respond first.
[3:38:22.520 --> 3:38:26.080]  But ladies and gentlemen, they're the ones saying treason, killing, arresting, put him
[3:38:26.080 --> 3:38:30.600]  in prison, solitary confinement, kill his family, kill me, kill everybody, kill, kill,
[3:38:30.600 --> 3:38:34.400]  kill, attack all his supporters, beat us up, they go to Mitch McConnell's house and say
[3:38:34.400 --> 3:38:37.880]  we're going to stab you to death, demon turtle and all this stuff.
[3:38:37.880 --> 3:38:41.440]  And then Trump goes, boy, it's like treason trying to overthrow an election.
[3:38:41.440 --> 3:38:44.720]  I mean, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[3:38:44.720 --> 3:38:46.120]  No, no, you're right.
[3:38:46.120 --> 3:38:51.760]  When Trump says treason legitimately because Adam Schiff is making up stuff to overthrow
[3:38:51.760 --> 3:38:52.760]  an election.
[3:38:52.760 --> 3:38:55.480]  And he's part of a treasonous criminal coup.
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:38:57.040]  That works for the tricombs.
[3:38:57.040 --> 3:39:00.440]  That's right, including John Brennan and McCabe and others.
[3:39:00.440 --> 3:39:03.240]  Oh, John Brennan do a good job for me.
[3:39:03.240 --> 3:39:04.480]  They're engaged in treason.
[3:39:04.480 --> 3:39:08.520]  Trump is accurate with that term, but it's Mad Maxine Waters and others who've been
[3:39:08.520 --> 3:39:10.480]  throwing this term around for years.
[3:39:10.480 --> 3:39:14.160]  And don't these corporate media people know they have almost no viewers, no untruth?
[3:39:14.160 --> 3:39:17.960]  Look, look, every question's attacking from the press worldwide because they're owned
[3:39:17.960 --> 3:39:19.160]  by the globalist.
[3:39:19.160 --> 3:39:24.320]  And then here's the lone lion with all of these, these high mange-covered hyenas.
[3:39:24.320 --> 3:39:25.320]  It's Trump.
[3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:27.000]  Trump, how dare you resist being impeached?
[3:39:27.000 --> 3:39:28.720]  How dare you not be impeached?
[3:39:28.720 --> 3:39:30.520]  Here's opposing your treason?
[3:39:30.520 --> 3:39:35.480]  No, when you start committing treason, that's when it's treason, you little jackass.
[3:39:35.480 --> 3:39:39.440]  Here, let's go back to it.
[3:39:39.440 --> 3:39:40.440]  Thank you, sir.
[3:39:40.440 --> 3:39:41.440]  Jeff Mason from Waters.
[3:39:41.440 --> 3:39:45.760]  Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about your use of the word treason.
[3:39:45.760 --> 3:39:49.040]  You've used it repeatedly in the last few days.
[3:39:49.040 --> 3:39:51.840]  Do you consider anyone who opposes you treasonous?
[3:39:51.840 --> 3:39:58.480]  No, I consider when they lie, when they stand before our great body in our great chamber
[3:39:58.480 --> 3:40:05.080]  and they make up a story that's fiction, like Schiff did, he took that perfect conversation
[3:40:05.080 --> 3:40:09.800]  I had with the Ukrainian president and he made it into a total lie.
[3:40:09.800 --> 3:40:10.800]  It was a total lie.
[3:40:10.800 --> 3:40:12.080]  Did the idiots all have their talking points?
[3:40:12.080 --> 3:40:13.080]  Not knowing.
[3:40:13.080 --> 3:40:14.080]  He's already teed up.
[3:40:14.080 --> 3:40:15.080]  He's got his driver.
[3:40:15.080 --> 3:40:16.080]  Oh, another one.
[3:40:16.080 --> 3:40:17.080]  Well, boom.
[3:40:17.080 --> 3:40:18.080]  Yep.
[3:40:18.080 --> 3:40:19.080]  Yep.
[3:40:19.080 --> 3:40:20.080]  Sorry.
[3:40:20.080 --> 3:40:22.480]  The only ones who don't like my conversation are the ones that never read it, but they
[3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:24.640]  heard Shifty Schiff.
[3:40:24.640 --> 3:40:30.840]  That's what I call a lie and because of the fact that he's lying about the president of
[3:40:30.840 --> 3:40:34.960]  the United States and as to what the president says, you know, I believe it or not, I watch
[3:40:34.960 --> 3:40:37.200]  my words very carefully.
[3:40:37.200 --> 3:40:40.760]  There are those that think I'm a very stable genius.
[3:40:40.760 --> 3:40:45.000]  By the way, it's not about Kissing Trump's ass, it's a fact that he's the only guy that
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:46.000]  could do this.
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:48.840]  I mean, I have control and if I had to do this for my kids, I could do it.
[3:40:48.840 --> 3:40:50.680]  I let myself get mad, but it's not fake.
[3:40:50.680 --> 3:40:56.720]  I still tried today to not blow up, I couldn't help it because if I was Trump, I mean, I'm
[3:40:56.720 --> 3:40:59.360]  not Trump because I couldn't do it.
[3:40:59.360 --> 3:41:06.520]  No, he is again, this is a masterful press conference showing that Trump has full control
[3:41:06.520 --> 3:41:08.960]  over everything, including these reporters.
[3:41:08.960 --> 3:41:10.640]  He is baiting the reporters.
[3:41:10.640 --> 3:41:11.640]  I agree.
[3:41:11.640 --> 3:41:12.640]  Back to something about it.
[3:41:12.640 --> 3:41:13.640]  Back to something about it.
[3:41:13.640 --> 3:41:14.640]  The questions.
[3:41:14.640 --> 3:41:15.640]  And he's got the right answer.
[3:41:15.640 --> 3:41:16.640]  You know, you got to go after this.
[3:41:16.640 --> 3:41:19.120]  I think I'm going to go take the war room over and co-host with Owen.
[3:41:19.120 --> 3:41:20.840]  We got to air this whole damn thing.
[3:41:20.840 --> 3:41:22.080]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[3:41:22.080 --> 3:41:27.120]  And I'm not, look, I've been holding back my gut about Trump because I really love him
[3:41:27.120 --> 3:41:28.120]  and I have nothing but good feelings.
[3:41:28.120 --> 3:41:31.360]  But then he does some stuff that pisses me off, but he's surrounded.
[3:41:31.360 --> 3:41:35.600]  I can, I got crew that wants to help me and we can't get a lot of stuff done because of
[3:41:35.600 --> 3:41:37.520]  stuff I issues or whatever.
[3:41:37.520 --> 3:41:41.880]  I mean, imagine being surrounded by all these enemies and he's gotten this much done.
[3:41:41.880 --> 3:41:45.960]  And so I don't want to just sycophantically headlong after Trump, but this standing against
[3:41:45.960 --> 3:41:46.960]  all these lies.
[3:41:46.960 --> 3:41:47.960]  This is what I want to support.
[3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:53.360]  Trump has the most difficult job in the world and everyone is literally trying to kill him
[3:41:53.360 --> 3:41:57.640]  and he's still standing and fighting and doing it better than ever.
[3:41:57.640 --> 3:42:02.360]  We need Trump to have a strong second term and you know what he'll do in a second term.
[3:42:02.360 --> 3:42:04.600]  He'll drain the swamp even more.
[3:42:04.600 --> 3:42:08.920]  And who wants to reach down into that filthy drain and pull that plug and drain the swamp?
[3:42:08.920 --> 3:42:09.920]  It's a dirty job.
[3:42:09.920 --> 3:42:11.840]  You know, somebody's got to do it.
[3:42:11.840 --> 3:42:13.080]  Few are willing to stand up.
[3:42:13.080 --> 3:42:14.080]  That's right.
[3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:15.080]  We're going to come right back.
[3:42:15.080 --> 3:42:19.520]  Obviously, naturalnews.com and remember, he's been blacklisted everywhere as well.
[3:42:19.520 --> 3:42:20.520]  So have we.
[3:42:20.520 --> 3:42:22.840]  I don't care if the country wasn't such trouble.
[3:42:22.840 --> 3:42:23.840]  I wouldn't be doing this.
[3:42:23.840 --> 3:42:24.840]  I've been doing it 25 years.
[3:42:24.840 --> 3:42:27.840]  It seems like a thousand, but I want to keep going, folks.
[3:42:27.840 --> 3:42:32.800]  The only way we can do is when you share band.videoinformers.com and say, hey, the forbidden show, it's
[3:42:32.800 --> 3:42:33.800]  here.
[3:42:33.800 --> 3:42:36.360]  The forbidden sites like naturalnews, they're there and they're fighting on.
[3:42:36.360 --> 3:42:40.240]  In Paul's site, summit.news, whatever you do, realize it's a fight between good and
[3:42:40.240 --> 3:42:43.840]  evil and we need you all to be involved and engaged now.
[3:42:43.840 --> 3:42:45.320]  Now is the time.
[3:42:45.320 --> 3:42:48.520]  Dim leaders are now calling for Trump's imprisonment, torture and murder.
[3:42:48.520 --> 3:42:49.520]  We have the video.
[3:42:49.520 --> 3:42:50.520]  Stay with us.
[3:42:50.520 --> 3:42:54.840]  We sold secret 12 for four years and it was our number third bestseller.
[3:42:54.840 --> 3:42:59.720]  We had to discontinue it because when you upgrade a formula, you are supposed to rename it.
[3:42:59.720 --> 3:43:01.880]  That new formula is ultra 12.
[3:43:01.880 --> 3:43:06.280]  It's twice as strong as secret 12, the very best vitamin B12 out there.
[3:43:06.280 --> 3:43:11.600]  It's got the complex system that lets your body absorb it and it does amazing things,
[3:43:11.600 --> 3:43:15.880]  helps healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, helps the body produce energy, helps
[3:43:15.880 --> 3:43:19.640]  produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function, it goes on
[3:43:19.640 --> 3:43:20.640]  and on.
[3:43:20.640 --> 3:43:24.280]  B12 deficiency is a serious problem that can cause anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation,
[3:43:24.280 --> 3:43:28.480]  weight loss, depression, poor memory loss, asthma, vision problems and low sperm count.
[3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:30.880]  Bottom line folks, you need ultra 12.
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:35.600]  It helps something in full war, so it's a 360 win and it's 50% off for a limited time

[3:43:51.760 --> 3:43:56.520]  You know I'm angry because I'm not just going to sit here and take this scientific dictatorship
[3:43:56.520 --> 3:44:00.560]  that admits it's putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, it's putting fluorine in the
[3:44:00.560 --> 3:44:05.200]  water to brain damages and that it's trying to literally destroy our families and organize
[3:44:05.200 --> 3:44:10.080]  us into a bunch of dumb down slaves so they can then carry out or orderly extermination.
[3:44:10.080 --> 3:44:14.640]  I'm not putting up with it and our information, our truth is devastating to these scumbag
[3:44:14.640 --> 3:44:19.040]  satans, but we've got to stay on air and I make it easy for you to help us stay on

[3:45:40.720 --> 3:45:44.240]  they're in this critical time with the globalists trying to take us off the air.

[3:45:48.280 --> 3:45:51.920]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[3:45:51.920 --> 3:45:57.680]  I was among the first 12 years ago to warn that Jeffrey Epstein was running a giant governmental
[3:45:57.680 --> 3:46:00.520]  blackmail ring using pedophilia.
[3:46:00.520 --> 3:46:05.200]  I was the first to warn of human-animal hybrids and organ harvesting.
[3:46:05.200 --> 3:46:09.960]  I was the first to begin to warn that babies were being kept alive after they were born
[3:46:09.960 --> 3:46:12.560]  for their organs to be harvested.
[3:46:12.560 --> 3:46:17.680]  I was the first to warn you along with Paul Watson and infowars.com 15 years ago that
[3:46:17.680 --> 3:46:23.080]  Google was using microphones and hidden cameras to record everything you do and hundreds and
[3:46:23.080 --> 3:46:26.680]  hundreds of other giant issues.
[3:46:26.680 --> 3:46:31.120]  Like the Federal Reserve being private, run for profit, trying to control our economy,
[3:46:31.120 --> 3:46:34.400]  that our government in Hollywood have been taken over by the Communist Chinese.
[3:46:34.400 --> 3:46:39.280]  On every one of these issues and many others, we've been dead on, and we've raised the
[3:46:39.280 --> 3:46:41.320]  alarm on a planetary scale.
[3:46:41.320 --> 3:46:46.080]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut us down, and that's why you are more critical
[3:46:46.080 --> 3:46:48.080]  than ever to support the Infowar.
[3:46:48.080 --> 3:46:55.240]  Please support the Infowar however you can.
[3:46:55.240 --> 3:46:59.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:46:59.080 --> 3:47:08.920]  Come on, man, and with the local D.B.C. news, Ellen Kujane and the Trumps have come back
[3:47:08.920 --> 3:47:13.920]  for a civil war, but tonight, don't call it a comeback.
[3:47:13.920 --> 3:47:18.280]  I've been here for years, I'm rockin' my peers, what some of them fear, make me-
[3:47:18.280 --> 3:47:19.800]  Mama said, knock you out.
[3:47:19.800 --> 3:47:22.520]  All right, the war room is coming up with Alan Schroyer.
[3:47:22.520 --> 3:47:24.720]  He is gonna air this press conference that's now over.
[3:47:24.720 --> 3:47:27.200]  It's been spectacular.
[3:47:27.200 --> 3:47:33.040]  Front to back, you know, cutting out the finished president that's, you know, just basically
[3:47:33.040 --> 3:47:37.440]  doesn't know what to say as he's being asked how did Trump threaten you, how did Trump
[3:47:37.440 --> 3:47:38.440]  buy you off?
[3:47:38.440 --> 3:47:39.760]  Tell us about how Trump's a criminal.
[3:47:39.760 --> 3:47:40.760]  I mean, it's just-
[3:47:40.760 --> 3:47:41.760]  Right.
[3:47:41.760 --> 3:47:43.080]  The leftists cannot believe Trump got in.
[3:47:43.080 --> 3:47:44.880]  They can't believe that they can't make stuff up.
[3:47:44.880 --> 3:47:47.080]  They can't believe no one believes him anymore.
[3:47:47.080 --> 3:47:48.640]  They're going to try to kill the president.
[3:47:48.640 --> 3:47:49.640]  There's no doubt about that.
[3:47:49.640 --> 3:47:50.640]  But you wanted to get to this.
[3:47:50.640 --> 3:47:56.280]  It's a news story on newswars.com, Mao Zedong said 70 years ago political power was out
[3:47:56.280 --> 3:47:57.280]  of the barrel of a gun.
[3:47:57.280 --> 3:48:00.880]  He said that in a speech he gave 70 years ago yesterday, and then he began the mass
[3:48:00.880 --> 3:48:03.680]  murder of his own people, 80 plus million by him.
[3:48:03.680 --> 3:48:08.720]  Well, Buddha judge admits gun control not about policy, it's about power.
[3:48:08.720 --> 3:48:09.920]  And that's what the UN said.
[3:48:09.920 --> 3:48:14.200]  They said taking the guns is about the government having the power monopoly.
[3:48:14.200 --> 3:48:16.480]  That's a quote by the Unidire Treaty itself.
[3:48:16.480 --> 3:48:19.320]  And so this is a big deal and we're going to put the video in a moment.
[3:48:19.320 --> 3:48:23.120]  And of course, he's the same guy who admitted that they are coming to take away your AR
[3:48:23.120 --> 3:48:24.120]  15s.
[3:48:24.120 --> 3:48:27.880]  So Pete Buddha judge, he is a loose cannon on the Democrat side of things.
[3:48:27.880 --> 3:48:28.880]  They want him.
[3:48:28.880 --> 3:48:29.880]  Well, they've all said it.
[3:48:29.880 --> 3:48:33.880]  I mean, Beto said it, Biden said, oh yeah, you're going to have to turn it in.
[3:48:33.880 --> 3:48:34.880]  Oh yeah.
[3:48:34.880 --> 3:48:35.880]  In fact, I'm sorry.
[3:48:35.880 --> 3:48:36.880]  It was Beto who said.
[3:48:36.880 --> 3:48:37.880]  No, they've all said it.
[3:48:37.880 --> 3:48:38.880]  They've all said it.
[3:48:38.880 --> 3:48:44.720]  But we got to get to the truth here that they do want you disarmed so they can kill you.
[3:48:44.720 --> 3:48:45.720]  And this is what.
[3:48:45.720 --> 3:48:46.720]  But you're not wrong.
[3:48:46.720 --> 3:48:47.720]  He said it too.
[3:48:47.720 --> 3:48:48.720]  Yeah, I get it.
[3:48:48.720 --> 3:48:52.160]  I was thinking about Beto for some reason, but but then I was thinking about those.
[3:48:52.160 --> 3:48:53.160]  They are lowers.
[3:48:53.160 --> 3:48:54.480]  You can buy that say no, Beto.
[3:48:54.480 --> 3:48:58.800]  So I think Beto was deleted from my brain for a moment, yes, because those lowers are
[3:48:58.800 --> 3:48:59.800]  selling out everywhere.
[3:48:59.800 --> 3:49:02.520]  You know, you can get them to say no, Beto, good stuff.
[3:49:02.520 --> 3:49:06.200]  But all these people that want to take away your guns, but Alex, it doesn't end at that.
[3:49:06.200 --> 3:49:11.560]  And what I want your viewers to know, and they do know this because you've said it before.
[3:49:11.560 --> 3:49:14.360]  After they take your guns, they're going to use them on you.
[3:49:14.360 --> 3:49:18.920]  This is whether the left now says that they fantasize about once we take the guns, we'll
[3:49:18.920 --> 3:49:21.440]  reeducate them and professors are teaching it.
[3:49:21.440 --> 3:49:23.680]  I mean, it's this weird existential power.
[3:49:23.680 --> 3:49:26.640]  They're going to be like an evil John Wayne murdering us.
[3:49:26.640 --> 3:49:27.640]  No, you're not.
[3:49:27.640 --> 3:49:28.640]  No, you're not.
[3:49:28.640 --> 3:49:29.640]  Well, here's Beto.
[3:49:29.640 --> 3:49:31.160]  Excuse me.
[3:49:31.160 --> 3:49:32.640]  Here is Buddha judge.
[3:49:32.640 --> 3:49:35.040]  Yeah, they're becoming one person now.
[3:49:35.040 --> 3:49:38.080]  They're Buddha, Buddha, Beto.
[3:49:38.080 --> 3:49:39.080]  Here he is.
[3:49:39.080 --> 3:49:41.160]  And look, we know what we've got to do.
[3:49:41.160 --> 3:49:44.760]  I'm guessing that pretty much everybody in the parade of candidates you're about to see
[3:49:44.760 --> 3:49:49.440]  is going to call for universal background checks, closing the hate loophole, the Charleston
[3:49:49.440 --> 3:49:55.680]  loophole, the boyfriend loophole, disarming domestic abusers, enacting red flag laws,
[3:49:55.680 --> 3:50:00.240]  extreme risk protection orders, banning the sale of assault weapons like what I carried
[3:50:00.240 --> 3:50:01.240]  in Afghanistan.
[3:50:01.240 --> 3:50:02.800]  We know what we have to do.
[3:50:02.800 --> 3:50:06.120]  The question is, how do we make sure that this time really is different?
[3:50:06.120 --> 3:50:10.120]  Because every time we say this time is different.
[3:50:10.120 --> 3:50:13.480]  And all of the plans, of course, I think my plan is the best.
[3:50:13.480 --> 3:50:15.320]  So does everybody else.
[3:50:15.320 --> 3:50:19.120]  All of them are multiplied by zero if we don't actually get something done.
[3:50:19.120 --> 3:50:21.500]  And so this is not just a question about policy.
[3:50:21.500 --> 3:50:25.040]  This is a question about power.
[3:50:25.040 --> 3:50:28.040]  Let me show.
[3:50:28.040 --> 3:50:29.040]  Buddha judge.
[3:50:29.040 --> 3:50:30.040]  Wow.
[3:50:30.040 --> 3:50:31.040]  I mean, what power?
[3:50:31.040 --> 3:50:32.680]  It's called the people have the power.
[3:50:32.680 --> 3:50:33.840]  And that's why we own the guns.
[3:50:33.840 --> 3:50:37.560]  I mean, here I am just out of the shooting range the other day, 100 yards, you know, shooting
[3:50:37.560 --> 3:50:43.320]  bulls eye open sights, here it is last week on Twitter, what gun I was shooting.
[3:50:43.320 --> 3:50:44.680]  And this is made in Turkey.
[3:50:44.680 --> 3:50:51.320]  It's an MP5 HK clone made off the same German machines, just a lot less money and shoots
[3:50:51.320 --> 3:50:52.320]  this as good.
[3:50:52.320 --> 3:51:03.320]  And so we're back out here, just give you a better look at this gun.
[3:51:03.320 --> 3:51:23.120]  They say in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king and he still clearly got one
[3:51:23.120 --> 3:51:24.120]  of his eyes.
[3:51:24.120 --> 3:51:33.640]  I can take that out for 25 yards, we're going to move back to 50 and then do 100.
[3:51:33.640 --> 3:51:38.480]  You know, Pete, Buddha judge and veto, they are becoming indistinguishable because all
[3:51:38.480 --> 3:51:40.040]  these people have the exact same thoughts.
[3:51:40.040 --> 3:51:41.040]  They do.
[3:51:41.040 --> 3:51:42.040]  They're like clones.
[3:51:42.040 --> 3:51:43.040]  They are robots.
[3:51:43.040 --> 3:51:44.560]  I didn't get him in the eye five times or so.
[3:51:44.560 --> 3:51:51.200]  This is the shotgun I've got in my bedroom and instant access pistol safe.
[3:51:51.200 --> 3:51:54.360]  And I shot the paper targets there, I'm not missing that shoot the metal targets.
[3:51:54.360 --> 3:51:56.360]  That's a slug.
[3:51:56.360 --> 3:51:58.840]  Oh, that's an auto loader shotgun, huh?
[3:51:58.840 --> 3:51:59.840]  Yeah.
[3:51:59.840 --> 3:52:00.840]  Those are great.
[3:52:00.840 --> 3:52:01.840]  Yeah.
[3:52:01.840 --> 3:52:02.840]  Mossberg.
[3:52:02.840 --> 3:52:03.840]  I got double luck.
[3:52:03.840 --> 3:52:04.840]  My house.
[3:52:04.840 --> 3:52:05.840]  That's a slug.
[3:52:05.840 --> 3:52:06.840]  Oh, slugs right now.
[3:52:06.840 --> 3:52:07.840]  Yeah.
[3:52:07.840 --> 3:52:08.840]  Yeah, they're ringing out.
[3:52:08.840 --> 3:52:09.840]  That's a hundred yards.
[3:52:09.840 --> 3:52:10.840]  It looks like it.
[3:52:10.840 --> 3:52:11.840]  Yeah.
[3:52:11.840 --> 3:52:24.160]  What kind of red dot you got on that?
[3:52:24.160 --> 3:52:25.160]  Something's done.
[3:52:25.160 --> 3:52:26.160]  It's like a hollow son.
[3:52:26.160 --> 3:52:27.160]  Yeah.
[3:52:27.160 --> 3:52:28.160]  Yeah.
[3:52:28.160 --> 3:52:29.160]  I mean, it's great.
[3:52:29.160 --> 3:52:32.760]  What's really fun is I got a semi, you should a semi auto 300 win mark.
[3:52:32.760 --> 3:52:33.760]  Sure.
[3:52:33.760 --> 3:52:34.760]  We've been shooting before.
[3:52:34.760 --> 3:52:35.760]  Nemo.
[3:52:35.760 --> 3:52:36.760]  Yeah, I got one of those.
[3:52:36.760 --> 3:52:37.760]  Those are fun.
[3:52:37.760 --> 3:52:38.760]  Yeah.
[3:52:38.760 --> 3:52:39.760]  What do you got?
[3:52:39.760 --> 3:52:40.760]  What is Nemo?
[3:52:40.760 --> 3:52:41.760]  Nemo arms.
[3:52:41.760 --> 3:52:42.760]  I got a semi auto 300 win mark.
[3:52:42.760 --> 3:52:44.560]  I'm actually ordering a browning one.
[3:52:44.560 --> 3:52:45.560]  What's this one I need to get?
[3:52:45.560 --> 3:52:47.960]  Well, it's just called Nemo in Nemo.
[3:52:47.960 --> 3:52:48.960]  Nemo arms.
[3:52:48.960 --> 3:52:49.960]  300 win mark.
[3:52:49.960 --> 3:52:50.960]  Yeah.
[3:52:50.960 --> 3:52:51.960]  Yeah.
[3:52:51.960 --> 3:52:52.960]  You got everything.
[3:52:52.960 --> 3:52:53.960]  Well, one of each.
[3:52:53.960 --> 3:52:54.960]  That's all.
[3:52:54.960 --> 3:52:55.960]  We need to go shooting again.
[3:52:55.960 --> 3:52:56.960]  Yeah.
[3:52:56.960 --> 3:52:57.960]  I got a little baby MP5.
[3:52:57.960 --> 3:53:01.960]  If they ever come to confiscate my guns, they're going to have to bring a couple trailers.
[3:53:01.960 --> 3:53:02.960]  Just bring it.
[3:53:02.960 --> 3:53:04.960]  You're going to load up a whole lot.
[3:53:04.960 --> 3:53:06.960]  You've gone out and shot our fifties?
[3:53:06.960 --> 3:53:07.960]  Yeah.
[3:53:07.960 --> 3:53:08.960]  Yeah.
[3:53:08.960 --> 3:53:09.960]  Remember we should go out to Stowner Ranch?
[3:53:09.960 --> 3:53:10.960]  Yeah, with the Barrett.
[3:53:10.960 --> 3:53:14.160]  It's not the one where they sold it and turned it into a housing deal with the big 12,000
[3:53:14.160 --> 3:53:15.160]  acres out there.
[3:53:15.160 --> 3:53:16.160]  Oh, yeah.
[3:53:16.160 --> 3:53:17.160]  Yep.
[3:53:17.160 --> 3:53:19.160]  I'm so busy I can never even look at that.
[3:53:19.160 --> 3:53:21.160]  How accurate is that?
[3:53:21.160 --> 3:53:22.160]  There it is.
[3:53:22.160 --> 3:53:23.160]  Yeah.
[3:53:23.160 --> 3:53:24.160]  The Nemo arms.
[3:53:24.160 --> 3:53:25.160]  Oh, it's very good.
[3:53:25.160 --> 3:53:28.200]  I've got mine running suppressed and that you can do 1500 yards.
[3:53:28.200 --> 3:53:29.200]  No problem.
[3:53:29.200 --> 3:53:31.360]  It's cycles really well.
[3:53:31.360 --> 3:53:32.860]  It's got a gas adjustable system.
[3:53:32.860 --> 3:53:33.860]  Nemo arms.
[3:53:33.860 --> 3:53:35.360]  300 win mark brought to you by.
[3:53:35.360 --> 3:53:36.360]  By the way, it's not a sponsor.
[3:53:36.360 --> 3:53:37.360]  Yeah, it's not a sponsor.
[3:53:37.360 --> 3:53:38.360]  I just have seen them.
[3:53:38.360 --> 3:53:43.160]  I've seen them there's just a good old fashioned browning safari model that you get around for
[3:53:43.160 --> 3:53:45.320]  shooting wild hogs or whatever.
[3:53:45.320 --> 3:53:49.460]  But anyway, just in case people think I'm, I'm kidding about if they have to confiscate
[3:53:49.460 --> 3:53:51.080]  my guns, they have to bring trailers.
[3:53:51.080 --> 3:53:53.560]  I'm kidding because you're not getting my guns.
[3:53:53.560 --> 3:53:54.560]  That's right.
[3:53:54.560 --> 3:53:55.560]  Absolutely.
[3:53:55.560 --> 3:53:56.560]  I'm not giving them to you.
[3:53:56.560 --> 3:53:58.160]  Man, I really appreciate you coming in.
[3:53:58.160 --> 3:53:59.880]  You're going to be on third hour tomorrow.
[3:53:59.880 --> 3:54:02.360]  We're going to cover their plan to take out Trump.
[3:54:02.360 --> 3:54:03.760]  You've done an excellent job laying it out.
[3:54:03.760 --> 3:54:04.760]  It's at naturalnews.com.
[3:54:04.760 --> 3:54:08.320]  Just briefly, let's go back to this amazing press conference, Owen Troyer will be on
[3:54:08.320 --> 3:54:11.960]  the TV and radio satellite for stations out there with the Orem coming up in a few minutes
[3:54:11.960 --> 3:54:16.280]  and the streams will be at band.video or just go to info wars.com.
[3:54:16.280 --> 3:54:20.280]  The big live feed right in the middle is all the live shows, Firepower, Will Johnson and
[3:54:20.280 --> 3:54:21.280]  Tom Pappard.
[3:54:21.280 --> 3:54:22.280]  David Knight in the mornings.
[3:54:22.280 --> 3:54:26.160]  We're adding more shows soon and please don't forget we have store wide free shipping, double
[3:54:26.160 --> 3:54:30.000]  Patriot points, which percent off all the supplements that's got again this weekend.
[3:54:30.000 --> 3:54:32.320]  And we've been behind on the money we need for the year.
[3:54:32.320 --> 3:54:36.440]  Quite frankly, I've just been hoping and praying that we have a good Christmas.
[3:54:36.440 --> 3:54:39.160]  We've got a little more serious about things of this impeachment, so we're getting a lot
[3:54:39.160 --> 3:54:40.160]  more orders in.
[3:54:40.160 --> 3:54:41.160]  So that's great.
[3:54:41.160 --> 3:54:43.000]  But in a sale this level, we got to sell a ton.
[3:54:43.000 --> 3:54:45.200]  So we're still in the red so far this year.
[3:54:45.200 --> 3:54:48.680]  I'm expending a little bit of backup money we have because I realize this is all or nothing.
[3:54:48.680 --> 3:54:49.680]  You can feel it.
[3:54:49.680 --> 3:54:50.680]  You can see it.
[3:54:50.680 --> 3:54:51.680]  But please get great products.
[3:54:51.680 --> 3:54:52.680]  You already needed infowarsore.com.
[3:54:52.680 --> 3:54:54.680]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[3:54:54.680 --> 3:54:55.680]  The police take action.
[3:54:55.680 --> 3:54:56.680]  This is critical.
[3:54:56.680 --> 3:54:57.680]  This isn't a game.
[3:54:57.680 --> 3:55:00.840]  50% off turbo force, 10 hour clean energy, 50% off the new viso beats, so good for your
[3:55:00.840 --> 3:55:01.840]  heart and body.
[3:55:01.840 --> 3:55:04.280]  50% off brain force plus.
[3:55:04.280 --> 3:55:05.280]  It's all there.
[3:55:05.280 --> 3:55:08.720]  50% off brain force.com, final days, Black Friday comes early sale, he's got to end
[3:55:08.720 --> 3:55:09.720]  by this weekend.
[3:55:09.720 --> 3:55:12.760]  Okay, let's go back to El Presidente and this is the press conference.
[3:55:12.760 --> 3:55:17.040]  United States and as to what the president says, you know, I believe it or not, I watch
[3:55:17.040 --> 3:55:19.280]  my words very carefully.
[3:55:19.280 --> 3:55:23.680]  There are those that think I'm a very stable genius, okay?
[3:55:23.680 --> 3:55:26.480]  I watch my words very, very closely.
[3:55:26.480 --> 3:55:32.160]  And to have somebody get up and to totally fabricate a conversation that I had with another
[3:55:32.160 --> 3:55:37.480]  leader and make it sound so bad, it was so evil.
[3:55:37.480 --> 3:55:45.160]  And now I see this that just came out minutes ago, where he met at a time that was impossible
[3:55:45.160 --> 3:55:48.440]  to have done unless there's corruption involved.
[3:55:48.440 --> 3:55:54.840]  And just so you know, we've been investigating on a personal basis through Rudy and others,
[3:55:54.840 --> 3:55:59.920]  lawyers, corruption in the 2016 election.
[3:55:59.920 --> 3:56:06.520]  We've been investigating corruption because I probably will, I was going to definitely,
[3:56:06.520 --> 3:56:10.640]  but I probably will be bringing a lot of litigation against a lot of people having to do with
[3:56:10.640 --> 3:56:14.440]  the corrupt investigation, having to do with the 2016 election.
[3:56:14.440 --> 3:56:15.440]  For example.
[3:56:15.440 --> 3:56:19.400]  And I have every right to do that because the way they've treated me and other people,
[3:56:19.400 --> 3:56:23.480]  they've destroyed people, they've destroyed their lives with a phony charge that never
[3:56:23.480 --> 3:56:24.480]  existed.
[3:56:24.480 --> 3:56:29.080]  All right, so Trump's going on the offensive about 2016 and the fraud ahead of 2020.
[3:56:29.080 --> 3:56:32.880]  He's going on the offensive on all their corruption and on Russiagate.
[3:56:32.880 --> 3:56:37.600]  We know McCabe's been indicted, they just haven't written it all the way yet.
[3:56:37.600 --> 3:56:38.760]  That's why they're freaking out so bad.
[3:56:38.760 --> 3:56:42.680]  This is because they're corrupt, they're desperate, they're scared, and their whole confidence
[3:56:42.680 --> 3:56:43.680]  game is not working.
[3:56:43.680 --> 3:56:46.640]  And each time they try and fail, they get weaker.
[3:56:46.640 --> 3:56:47.640]  That's why they're going to try to kill him.
[3:56:47.640 --> 3:56:51.880]  Well, they also know if William Barr does his, I'm sorry, yeah, Bill Barr does his job,
[3:56:51.880 --> 3:56:56.320]  then the Democrats are going to go to jail, many of them, they're going to be exposed
[3:56:56.320 --> 3:57:00.280]  and the Democrat party is going to collapse under the criminal indictments, I believe.
[3:57:00.280 --> 3:57:06.600]  And I also imagine a future where CNN is shut down because they will be exposed as being
[3:57:06.600 --> 3:57:08.600]  complicit in this criminal coup.
[3:57:08.600 --> 3:57:12.240]  Yeah, we're not going to shut them down because they had ratings or their competition, like
[3:57:12.240 --> 3:57:13.240]  they tried to do us.
[3:57:13.240 --> 3:57:17.840]  It's that they're so evil, the name will be synonymous with criminal orchestrated evil.
[3:57:17.840 --> 3:57:19.360]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[3:57:19.360 --> 3:57:22.560]  And they're just going to lose their audience, lose their market share, they're going to
[3:57:22.560 --> 3:57:24.520]  be over, no one will ever trust them again.
[3:57:24.520 --> 3:57:26.120]  Any intelligent person doesn't trust them now.
[3:57:26.120 --> 3:57:30.560]  And that's why we've got to stay in the fight right through 2020, we're going to win.
[3:57:30.560 --> 3:57:33.080]  And it doesn't mean the world's going to be utopia, we're not communist, but it's going
[3:57:33.080 --> 3:57:36.960]  to be a better world and we're going to have a good chance to defeat the AI and everything
[3:57:36.960 --> 3:57:37.960]  else.
[3:57:37.960 --> 3:57:38.960]  Mike Adams, great job.
[3:57:38.960 --> 3:57:39.960]  Thank you.
[3:57:39.960 --> 3:57:57.720]  Thank you for being here right now.
