[00:00.000 --> 00:26.400]  We play the songs that sound more like everyone else than anyone else.
[00:26.400 --> 00:33.000]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, that El Castro took the
[00:33.000 --> 00:42.880]  guns, Hugo Chavez took the guns, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:42.880 --> 00:59.560]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[00:59.560 --> 01:03.960]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:03.960 --> 01:10.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:10.200 --> 01:16.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the 25th day of January 2018, hard to believe.
[01:16.600 --> 01:19.440]  The first month of this year is almost gone.
[01:19.440 --> 01:25.160]  We have amazing exclusive footage of the president arriving in Davos and a lot of other amazing
[01:25.160 --> 01:29.720]  stuff coming up that our great reporter, Dan Lyman, is there shooting and reporting
[01:29.720 --> 01:34.160]  on that's posted on infowars.com and more going up as we speak.
[01:34.160 --> 01:39.760]  We have just the wheels coming off, the car blowing up, the walls closing in on the deep
[01:39.760 --> 01:45.480]  state on the secret society, Clinton, crime cabal inside the Justice Department and the
[01:45.480 --> 01:50.200]  FBI that's been ruling over this country since the mid-1990s as the Clintons committed
[01:50.200 --> 01:54.960]  massive crimes in front of everybody as the public and journalists and patriots in the
[01:54.960 --> 02:00.400]  government and people across the board realize the globalist are at war with the American
[02:00.400 --> 02:04.400]  people through their shadow government, through their deep state.
[02:04.400 --> 02:09.840]  Now that it's identified and that it's run by the Communist Chinese, the EU and others,
[02:09.840 --> 02:12.280]  there's no putting it back together again.
[02:12.280 --> 02:17.920]  We have crossed the point of no return, the event horizon.
[02:17.920 --> 02:19.800]  Here's what Lou Dobbs had to say last night.
[02:19.800 --> 02:21.560]  Good evening, everybody.
[02:21.560 --> 02:26.960]  It may be time to declare war outright against the deep state and clear out the rot in the
[02:26.960 --> 02:30.560]  upper levels of the FBI and the Justice Department.
[02:30.560 --> 02:32.400]  Yes, I said the rot.
[02:32.400 --> 02:38.720]  The FBI and the DOJ have broken the public trust by destroying evidence, defying oversight
[02:38.720 --> 02:42.120]  and actively trying to bring down the Trump presidency.
[02:42.120 --> 02:49.000]  Tonight, there are new concerns that anti-Trump FBI officials formed even a secret society
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.960]  at the FBI to subvert the president after his election.
[02:53.960 --> 02:58.680]  That's according to two Republican lawmakers who've seen some of the thousands of texts
[02:58.680 --> 03:03.880]  between the FBI's Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.
[03:03.880 --> 03:09.520]  And we have the full then 10-minute segment where he annihilates them posted on infowars.com
[03:09.520 --> 03:13.320]  an article we wrote about the report on Fox Business last night.
[03:13.320 --> 03:17.840]  You asked my opinion, some of the best, most hard-hitting information is on Fox Business
[03:17.840 --> 03:21.680]  and Lou Dobbs is a total patriot, wouldn't even know about the globalist in mainstream
[03:21.680 --> 03:24.760]  media if it wasn't for him and many others.
[03:24.760 --> 03:28.200]  But I just have to thank Lou Dobbs for his courage.
[03:28.200 --> 03:33.000]  It is time to declare war because they've already declared war on us and now they're
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.500]  cornered rats.
[03:34.500 --> 03:39.440]  As I keep saying, we've reached the most dangerous point right now because the walls are closing
[03:39.440 --> 03:43.160]  in.
[03:43.160 --> 03:44.160]  This story hits close to home.
[03:44.160 --> 03:46.440]  It's a miscalculator with legal reaction.
[03:46.440 --> 03:52.040]  Now also tonight, the walls are closing in on those responsible for this massive corruption,
[03:52.040 --> 03:57.520]  abuse of power at the top levels of government in what we are now calling state-sponsored
[03:57.520 --> 03:58.520]  sabotage.
[03:58.520 --> 04:03.400]  Now with this flood of damning news exposing all this malfeasance, the special counsel
[04:03.400 --> 04:07.680]  Robert Mueller and his spokespeople in the media are now working overtime.
[04:07.680 --> 04:13.440]  They want to create as many distractions as possible and discredit anybody that's telling
[04:13.440 --> 04:18.040]  the truth like us here on the Fox News channel for daring to report on the truth.
[04:18.040 --> 04:23.400]  Now to be perfectly clear for those that don't pay attention and want to advance lies and
[04:23.400 --> 04:24.840]  false narratives.
[04:24.840 --> 04:30.880]  We are not and never have been and never will be talking about rank and file members of
[04:30.880 --> 04:33.960]  the FBI, the DOJ and the intelligence community.
[04:33.960 --> 04:34.960]  That's right.
[04:34.960 --> 04:35.960]  We'll be right back.
[04:35.960 --> 04:38.960]  And the reason that's critical is they keep saying, oh, you hate all the FBI or by the
[04:38.960 --> 04:39.960]  federal government.
[04:39.960 --> 04:44.640]  It's mainly FBI agents, former and current that are speaking out against this and exposing
[04:44.640 --> 04:45.640]  it.
[04:45.640 --> 04:50.840]  So this is a criminal Clinton cabal, globalist cabal hooked in with all these foreign powers
[04:50.840 --> 04:54.040]  that had been taking control of America and it's being rooted out.
[04:54.040 --> 04:56.720]  That's what the whole Trump presidency is about.
[04:56.720 --> 05:00.400]  And you heard it here first.
[05:00.400 --> 05:05.040]  Feel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[05:05.040 --> 05:09.000]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.840]  nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[05:12.840 --> 05:16.600]  They also help prevent discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[05:16.600 --> 05:18.440]  particles in the gut.
[05:18.440 --> 05:20.880]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[05:20.880 --> 05:25.000]  Food is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.560]  You can eat protein heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[05:32.560 --> 05:35.360]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[05:35.360 --> 05:39.560]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption
[05:39.560 --> 05:43.560]  of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[05:43.560 --> 05:48.000]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.600]  can fully digest all types of meals.
[05:50.600 --> 05:54.600]  Let a meal go to waste, use carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[05:54.600 --> 05:58.080]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now.
[05:58.080 --> 06:28.040]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[06:29.080 --> 06:34.120]  The video is also being posted as we speak to InfoWars.com.
[06:34.120 --> 06:39.320]  Our HD footage, that I think is better than the other footage I've seen, a lot of it exclusive
[06:39.320 --> 06:45.120]  of Marine One, all three of them, because they used two of them as decoys with anti-missile
[06:45.120 --> 06:53.960]  systems on board, landing up at the plateau beneath the mountain in Davos, Switzerland.
[06:53.960 --> 06:58.880]  And then of course the president getting out and then traveling into Davos.
[06:58.880 --> 07:05.440]  That happened obviously earlier today because they are what's eight hours ahead of us there
[07:05.440 --> 07:06.440]  in Switzerland.
[07:06.440 --> 07:14.880]  I guess eight hours ahead of Texas time, seven hours ahead of New York time, Eastern time.
[07:14.880 --> 07:23.160]  There's an amazing new graph and new spreadsheet that goes into more detail about the deep state
[07:23.160 --> 07:30.960]  secret society insurance policy group that the folks at the Epoch Times have put together.
[07:30.960 --> 07:38.720]  They're the mainly Buddhist run world newspaper that exposes communist China harvesting their
[07:38.720 --> 07:40.480]  organs and selling them.
[07:40.480 --> 07:44.920]  And so that's one big reason they keep exposing other communist Chinese basically run this
[07:44.920 --> 07:48.560]  country on the last 20 years until Trump showed up.
[07:48.560 --> 07:54.280]  And so the communist Chinese are being evicted out of running Harvard, UT, you name it, that
[07:54.280 --> 08:00.920]  was in the Washington Post last week, Hollywood, you name it, the communist Chinese intelligence.
[08:00.920 --> 08:09.480]  And this basically breaks down how the insurance policy set everybody up in stunning detail.
[08:09.480 --> 08:15.160]  So I'm going to be tweeting this out at real Alex Jones very, very soon.
[08:15.160 --> 08:19.600]  And coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to go through it piece by piece.
[08:19.600 --> 08:26.720]  But how the whole operation through Hillary Clinton ran through fusing GPS through the
[08:26.720 --> 08:32.960]  Justice Department, through the FBI, through political operatives, who they then pointed
[08:32.960 --> 08:38.920]  their fingers at, and then into who they tried to set up and who they tried to destroy with
[08:38.920 --> 08:40.280]  Obama coming in.
[08:40.280 --> 08:45.520]  This is very well done, double teaming, giving governmental power in between the political
[08:45.520 --> 08:51.400]  operatives of Hillary, Hollywood, Republican allies, the Democratic Party, between Obama
[08:51.400 --> 08:58.800]  and the intelligence agencies in a pincer attack with John Brennan, the CIA and others,
[08:58.800 --> 09:04.280]  one of the Robert Mueller, Comey and others, Loretta Lynch, all working in tandem, as well
[09:04.280 --> 09:10.240]  as Jay Johnson, to engage in one of the biggest criminal conspiracies the world has ever seen
[09:10.240 --> 09:17.560]  that has now been blown absolutely, completely, and totally wide open.
[09:17.560 --> 09:23.280]  Now, there is a FISA memo that chronicles the last two and a half years activity that
[09:23.280 --> 09:29.840]  was posted to the Director of National Intelligence website and got almost no attention.
[09:29.840 --> 09:35.080]  William Benny, former technical head of the NSA, was contacted and said, this is the main
[09:35.080 --> 09:41.400]  body, the 98, a nine page memo that Nunes has the secret parts of, and that is going
[09:41.400 --> 09:46.600]  to be in a larger summary and report he's going to put out, but there's four pages
[09:46.600 --> 09:56.080]  he's alluding to that is the blacked out areas of the document that is still classified,
[09:56.080 --> 10:03.120]  the whole document was classified, and that it shows the perjury of Justice Department,
[10:03.120 --> 10:09.040]  foreign current FBI and others on what they've testified to versus what's in the document.
[10:09.040 --> 10:13.680]  That then connects into the secret society, it connects into the insurance policy, it connects
[10:13.680 --> 10:18.480]  into the offsite secret meetings, it connects into the erased text messages, and they have
[10:18.480 --> 10:25.000]  text messages where they said we're now going to all erase our text messages, but that got
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.920]  picked up in the dragnets, so they've been caught, and right now, because we have people
[10:30.920 --> 10:41.760]  that have courage like Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy and Jim Jordan and others, because of
[10:41.760 --> 10:49.920]  this the whole house of cards is coming down, so first the media said there is no memo,
[10:49.920 --> 10:57.040]  and they came out and said, here's the headline, did Devin Nunes invent his own smoking gun?
[10:57.040 --> 11:03.560]  We already have the smoking guns with the head, deputy head of the FBI, meeting in secret
[11:03.560 --> 11:08.560]  to organize the insurance policy, we already have them saying we can't let Trump get in
[11:08.560 --> 11:12.560]  when he was president-elect, we've got to stop him, we have the whole chain of events
[11:12.560 --> 11:19.880]  from when he was a candidate to the nominee to the president-elect, and they just didn't
[11:19.880 --> 11:25.280]  know what to do with themselves, and so now they lied to Congress, Comey lied, Mueller
[11:25.280 --> 11:33.360]  lied, McCabe lied, they all lied over and over again, so their insurance policy, the
[11:33.360 --> 11:38.640]  whole they dug for American voters to kill our will and the restoration of our republic,
[11:38.640 --> 11:42.800]  at least getting control of our country back in the hands of the states and the Congress
[11:42.800 --> 11:47.640]  and the president and the courts, that's all this is, is a second American revolution
[11:47.640 --> 11:57.160]  against the new modern form of globalist colonialism taking our country back, and they don't know
[11:57.160 --> 12:03.920]  what to do, and that's why we're at the critical juncture right now, because the walls are
[12:03.920 --> 12:08.160]  closing in, as Sean Hannity said last night, as I've been saying for the last few weeks,
[12:08.160 --> 12:14.400]  they're cornered rats, and the best way to say it is the walls are closing in, I describe
[12:14.400 --> 12:21.240]  it as water, like in a movie, you're trapped in a submerged boat or something, and the
[12:21.240 --> 12:27.160]  water is coming in, it's an upside down capsized boat, or it's one of those old movies where
[12:27.160 --> 12:31.920]  you're in the Egyptian temple, and all of a sudden the sand starts pouring in, and a
[12:31.920 --> 12:39.640]  big stone blocks the door, that is exactly the analogies I've used, and Hannity's boiled
[12:39.640 --> 12:46.800]  it down excellently, the walls are closing in, so what are they going to do?
[12:46.800 --> 12:52.840]  Now the walls are closing in, now that we know there's a war on America, a war on sovereignty,
[12:52.840 --> 12:57.640]  the New York Times has gone from saying globalism doesn't exist, Ron Paul's insane, Trump's
[12:57.640 --> 13:04.480]  insane, Jones is insane, Drudge is insane, to okay, there's a fox in the globalist henhouse
[13:04.480 --> 13:11.800]  in Davos, and our world government's falling apart, and now the Indian president just joined
[13:11.800 --> 13:19.280]  Trump saying globalism's done, that clip's coming up, and now more and more governments
[13:19.280 --> 13:24.640]  are saying we're not handing our power over to you anymore, this is the collapse of the
[13:24.640 --> 13:28.560]  New World Order, doesn't mean some utopias on the other side, doesn't mean everything's
[13:28.560 --> 13:33.480]  going to be perfect, but the arrogance of the mega corporations who thought they would
[13:33.480 --> 13:37.760]  create private corporate governments that are authoritarian, transfer all our power
[13:37.760 --> 13:42.920]  to them, and exempt themselves from all the regulations and taxes that they foist on us,
[13:42.920 --> 13:49.920]  this is the beginning of the world awakening to that fraud, and the fortunes of Google,
[13:49.920 --> 13:57.320]  Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, especially Apple, all of it is based on this rigged system,
[13:57.320 --> 14:02.680]  set up by the globalist, by the Rockefellers, and really expressed by the Clintons through
[14:02.680 --> 14:08.200]  George W. through Obama, and it has destroyed the nation state, it has destroyed wealth,
[14:08.200 --> 14:22.720]  it has savage societies, and now, in office only 340 days, no, 370 days, 370 days, only
[14:22.720 --> 14:28.440]  in office 370 days, President Trump is in Davos, just as we told you he was going to
[14:28.440 --> 14:35.360]  do, going in and saying, you're going to listen to me or leave, you're lucky I'm here, I'm
[14:35.360 --> 14:40.480]  here to talk about a future for your companies, not screwing people over, and all of a sudden
[14:40.480 --> 14:43.480]  they're all saying, we like Trump, we like what he's done the last year, he's right,
[14:43.480 --> 14:46.880]  we all got even richer, but see, they don't want to just get richer, they want to run
[14:46.880 --> 14:52.320]  it and control it all, so suddenly Lloyd Blank fine and Bezos, and all of them are rolling
[14:52.320 --> 14:58.000]  over and showing their bellies right now, because the United States of America isn't
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.880]  under their full control, but believe me, they will stab the President in the back as
[15:03.880 --> 15:08.480]  soon as they can, they'll stab us in the back, it's the nature of these scumbags that would
[15:08.480 --> 15:14.160]  want to make everybody else poor, an ally with the communist Chinese, so that they could
[15:14.160 --> 15:21.040]  take control of our world, think about that, allied with the worst authoritarian regimes
[15:21.040 --> 15:28.200]  in the world, and Trump's already outflanked China with his India move, and his South Korea
[15:28.200 --> 15:32.760]  move, he's already outflanked the EU with his support of Brexit and everything else,
[15:32.760 --> 15:37.760]  it's already happening, because their system is authoritarian, tenuous and based on lies,
[15:37.760 --> 15:43.080]  it will be easy to destroy it and build something much better, because it's parasitic, but first
[15:43.080 --> 15:47.760]  we've got to beat Hollywood, the mainstream media stay behind networks that are trying
[15:47.760 --> 15:52.640]  to kick off a civil war in this country, and trying to bully the resistance with all these
[15:52.640 --> 15:59.920]  fake sex assault charges, we've got to make it through this final minefield.
[15:59.920 --> 16:04.440]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[16:04.440 --> 16:09.680]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood
[16:09.680 --> 16:14.600]  sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these

[18:09.440 --> 18:13.480]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[18:13.480 --> 18:17.840]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[18:17.840 --> 18:23.160]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[18:34.080 --> 18:36.800]  heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[18:36.800 --> 18:41.120]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[18:41.120 --> 18:43.840]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[18:43.840 --> 18:48.520]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[18:58.280 --> 19:00.480]  At InfowarsLife.com.
[19:00.480 --> 19:03.960]  InfowarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[19:03.960 --> 19:08.520]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[19:08.520 --> 19:14.080]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health
[19:14.080 --> 19:15.480]  and normal breathing.
[19:15.480 --> 19:16.480]  This is pollen block.
[19:16.480 --> 19:21.840]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[19:21.840 --> 19:26.800]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like running nose, itchy
[19:26.800 --> 19:29.600]  watery eyes and excessive mucus production.
[19:29.600 --> 19:34.360]  They began studying the effects in public trials, in their public trials.
[19:34.360 --> 19:40.480]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets
[19:40.480 --> 19:45.280]  at the first sign of seasonal distress and fast-acting pollen block starts working in
[19:45.280 --> 19:49.080]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[19:49.080 --> 19:52.320]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block.
[19:52.320 --> 19:56.400]  Available now at InfowarsLife.com or by calling toll free.
[19:56.400 --> 20:03.600]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[20:03.600 --> 20:21.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:21.960 --> 20:41.880]  So, the mainstream corporate enemy media has already collapsed.
[20:41.880 --> 20:42.880]  They're all bankrupt.
[20:42.880 --> 20:46.520]  Every single one of them from the New York Times, the Washington Post, they're all propped
[20:46.520 --> 20:54.040]  up by kingpins like Bezos and Carlos Slim to the richest men in the world.
[20:54.040 --> 20:59.400]  And some of the messages came out from the union negotiation with the Washington Post,
[20:59.400 --> 21:05.120]  where the employees are having their promise pay increases and things taken away.
[21:05.120 --> 21:09.280]  And Bezos' representative actually told them, sit down and shut up.
[21:09.280 --> 21:11.080]  That was in the news yesterday.
[21:11.080 --> 21:13.320]  You're lucky to even have a job.
[21:13.320 --> 21:16.680]  You're taking the promises away.
[21:16.680 --> 21:17.880]  See how that works?
[21:17.880 --> 21:18.880]  And they don't care.
[21:18.880 --> 21:23.880]  They're in their lion 24-7, proud to destroy this country as much as they can.
[21:23.880 --> 21:29.600]  And when they're done and Bezos is won, if he's successful, you'll get rid of all of them
[21:29.600 --> 21:34.360]  because Bezos is all about using people up and throwing them in the gutter.
[21:34.360 --> 21:35.360]  There it is.
[21:35.360 --> 21:40.640]  WAPO staffers fighting for better wages, told to sit down, shut up and be grateful for Bezos.
[21:40.640 --> 21:46.080]  Yeah, it said that they were getting $8 increases a year.
[21:46.080 --> 21:50.680]  Now he says they're not going to get pay increases and other people are going to have their pay
[21:50.680 --> 21:52.640]  cut if you actually go read what it says.
[21:52.640 --> 21:54.400]  So that headline's not even strong enough.
[21:54.400 --> 21:58.040]  But again, that's just a side issue.
[21:58.040 --> 22:04.140]  Under Trump, hundreds of companies have given $1,000 to $5,000 bonuses to even their lowest
[22:04.140 --> 22:05.880]  level employees.
[22:05.880 --> 22:10.840]  And the average family's gotten a $13,000 tax decrease.
[22:10.840 --> 22:13.200]  And the stock market's at $26,000.
[22:13.200 --> 22:15.200]  And there's millions of new jobs.
[22:15.200 --> 22:18.440]  And we've got the highest increases in wages ever recorded.
[22:18.440 --> 22:20.400]  And the lowest black unemployment ever recorded.
[22:20.400 --> 22:25.600]  But CNN, The Washington Post and everybody, they have endless articles telling you, oh,
[22:25.600 --> 22:28.480]  well, black unemployment is the lowest ever, but here's what's behind it.
[22:28.480 --> 22:30.960]  Or wages are up, but here's what's behind it.
[22:30.960 --> 22:34.120]  It's not Trump, it's Obama.
[22:34.120 --> 22:35.120]  That's right.
[22:35.120 --> 22:37.240]  Obama did it all.
[22:37.240 --> 22:39.920]  Obama got Apple to move back.
[22:39.920 --> 22:42.480]  Obama called thousands of companies.
[22:42.480 --> 22:44.920]  No, Trump got the tax cuts.
[22:44.920 --> 22:47.760]  Trump got the corporate tax cut.
[22:47.760 --> 22:50.640]  So that's their talking points.
[22:50.640 --> 22:52.280]  First off, they'll never be prosperity.
[22:52.280 --> 22:56.320]  You'll never get above 3%.
[22:56.320 --> 23:00.920]  And then they said, OK, it is going to probably go to 7% or 8%, 9% in the next couple of years.
[23:00.920 --> 23:01.920]  You're right.
[23:01.920 --> 23:02.920]  It's about 3.3% right now.
[23:02.920 --> 23:03.920]  OK.
[23:03.920 --> 23:06.840]  It's Obama, he did it.
[23:06.840 --> 23:08.720]  Obama did it.
[23:08.720 --> 23:11.240]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:11.240 --> 23:15.320]  And getting back to the memo, and I want to open the phones up, just as this department
[23:15.320 --> 23:24.520]  makes last ditch effort to block release of FISA memo, Peter Schiff and all the usual
[23:24.520 --> 23:29.800]  suspects running the fraud at the congressional level, Hamont said, it's a conspiracy theory.
[23:29.800 --> 23:30.800]  There's nothing there.
[23:30.800 --> 23:36.080]  Devin Nunes made it up, those are the quotes, that was about two weeks ago, about all these
[23:36.080 --> 23:37.080]  documents.
[23:37.080 --> 23:46.160]  Then they said, OK, it's real, but you can't understand it, so we shouldn't release it.
[23:46.160 --> 23:50.120]  And now they're saying, don't release it, period.
[23:50.120 --> 23:53.280]  But the Democrats are going to release their own memo.
[23:53.280 --> 23:59.600]  It's not quotes and texts and documents and secret societies and all this other garbage.
[23:59.600 --> 24:04.120]  No, no, ladies and gentlemen, it's just their opinion.
[24:04.120 --> 24:10.000]  Meanwhile, MSNBC, FBI secret society, is a dangerous conspiracy theory, even though
[24:10.000 --> 24:16.920]  it's FBI agents telling Congress this and text messages, talking about secret meetings
[24:16.920 --> 24:20.200]  and insurance policies, all that's confirmed.
[24:20.200 --> 24:23.840]  But don't worry, it's a conspiracy theory.
[24:23.840 --> 24:30.240]  And then let's have an old neocon on there to tell everybody that everything is actually
[24:30.240 --> 24:31.760]  OK.
[24:31.760 --> 24:35.200]  So just department makes last ditch effort to block release of the FISA memo.
[24:35.200 --> 24:37.640]  That's up on infowars.com.
[24:37.640 --> 24:44.240]  And here's the big one, Comey Rosenstein McCabe, all named in FISA memo, according to First
[24:44.240 --> 24:46.760]  Leak.
[24:46.760 --> 24:51.200]  Now again, that's the first leak being reported by the Daily Beast, because mainstream media
[24:51.200 --> 24:53.120]  is giving that attention saying it's the first leak.
[24:53.120 --> 24:55.240]  You know, we've gotten leaks.
[24:55.240 --> 24:57.560]  Jack Pasobak's gotten leaks.
[24:57.560 --> 25:03.960]  Roger Stone has talked to four members of Congress, some of them that you see on television.
[25:03.960 --> 25:08.680]  And as of last night, he still wasn't ready to say what they told him, and he asked me
[25:08.680 --> 25:10.280]  not to say yet.
[25:10.280 --> 25:14.560]  But he does just tell me all this incredible stuff, just so I know how good his sources
[25:14.560 --> 25:15.560]  are.
[25:15.560 --> 25:21.000]  And then 99% of the time, we wait too long and we get scooped.
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.960]  That didn't really happen in this Daily Beast.
[25:22.960 --> 25:26.240]  It's just reporting what we've always known.
[25:26.240 --> 25:32.800]  Much of what Nunez talks about when he says the secret FISA court memo is the FISA court
[25:32.800 --> 25:37.640]  99 page memo that gives you the dates of when they were spying, the FISA court saying this
[25:37.640 --> 25:43.680]  is illegal over and over again.
[25:43.680 --> 25:49.400]  So the Daily Beast spends it, Devin Nunez's anti FBI memo named James Comey, Rod Rosenstein
[25:49.400 --> 25:50.920]  and Andrew McCabe.
[25:50.920 --> 25:57.920]  Because they're the ones involved back before Trump was even in office during the campaign.
[25:57.920 --> 26:03.120]  And when he was president-elect, they're the ones running the FISA operation.
[26:03.120 --> 26:11.600]  They're the ones taking the Fusion GPS baloney package in.
[26:11.600 --> 26:12.680]  They're the ones.
[26:12.680 --> 26:17.920]  That's why that document's important is because it shows the blueprint.
[26:17.920 --> 26:22.800]  And yes, there's secret parts we haven't released that are the blocked out parts, but they play
[26:22.800 --> 26:24.040]  semantical games.
[26:24.040 --> 26:27.200]  Just like the talking point is, Devin Nunez has nothing.
[26:27.200 --> 26:28.200]  There is nothing.
[26:28.200 --> 26:29.200]  He made it up.
[26:29.200 --> 26:30.560]  Alex Jones made it all up.
[26:30.560 --> 26:31.560]  It's all fake.
[26:31.560 --> 26:32.560]  It's all fake.
[26:32.560 --> 26:33.840]  Hillary won.
[26:33.840 --> 26:34.840]  She's Madam President.
[26:34.840 --> 26:36.840]  Like, where is my Madam President?
[26:36.840 --> 26:40.440]  I guess they've hung it back on the wall by my office.
[26:40.440 --> 26:42.840]  This is how they play these games.
[26:42.840 --> 26:47.160]  Oh, and of course, I'm sure we all believe this, CBS News.
[26:47.160 --> 26:55.040]  Those of FBI issued phones had a glitch that failed to save text.
[26:55.040 --> 26:57.040]  Total made up crap.
[26:57.040 --> 27:03.840]  That particular Samsung Galaxy phone hardcodes the text.
[27:03.840 --> 27:09.880]  Oh, but they're saying that's what glitched, but you still have to manually erase them.
[27:09.880 --> 27:11.400]  And everybody knows that.
[27:11.400 --> 27:17.120]  So oh my goodness, the FBI says we wouldn't do that.
[27:17.120 --> 27:23.040]  And again, the New York Times said 99% chance Hillary was going to win, Madam President.
[27:23.040 --> 27:25.560]  So they never engage in fake news.
[27:25.560 --> 27:29.400]  No, they only tell us the truth.
[27:29.400 --> 27:35.000]  Again, did Nunez invent his own smoking gun?
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.440]  That's the talking point when we have the smoking guns.
[27:39.440 --> 27:45.560]  We have the fraudulent warrants they got, which the court says in the memo, you guys
[27:45.560 --> 27:51.120]  aren't following the law doing this until the president orders them to do it.
[27:51.120 --> 27:52.360]  And that's what's blacked out.
[27:52.360 --> 28:00.520]  And that's what Daily Beast isn't telling you is Barack Obama's name is in these documents.
[28:00.520 --> 28:03.760]  POTUS, president of the United States.
[28:03.760 --> 28:05.960]  And that's what no one is supposed to ever say.
[28:05.960 --> 28:10.600]  They have the talking point now for over a year and a half that President Obama has never
[28:10.600 --> 28:15.160]  been involved in any political action against Trump.
[28:15.160 --> 28:20.880]  President Obama has never been involved with the FISA court against anybody who's a U.S.
[28:20.880 --> 28:21.880]  citizen.
[28:21.880 --> 28:23.480]  President Obama is above reproach.
[28:23.480 --> 28:29.720]  And what did Nunez and what did all the other congressional Republicans that have the courage
[28:29.720 --> 28:36.440]  to tell the truth tell you is going to happen, what did Congress from Gates say?
[28:36.440 --> 28:42.520]  They've all said what's in the memo exposes Obama running it and will destroy his legacy
[28:42.520 --> 28:44.000]  as Mr. Goodie Two Shoes.
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.320]  Mr. Goodie Two Shoes, he persecuted the press.
[28:47.320 --> 28:50.840]  He persecuted whistleblowers like no one we've ever seen.
[28:50.840 --> 28:56.600]  So that's what's really in the memo is that Obama ran this and used illegal fake info
[28:56.600 --> 29:00.000]  to get a fake warrant to surveil his political enemies.
[29:00.000 --> 29:01.000]  Hear that?
[29:01.000 --> 29:06.480]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[29:06.480 --> 29:09.440]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[29:09.440 --> 29:12.960]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[32:08.840 --> 32:09.840]  It just gets old, man.
[32:09.840 --> 32:12.760]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[32:12.760 --> 32:15.040]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[32:15.040 --> 32:19.120]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[32:19.120 --> 32:22.480]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[32:22.480 --> 32:24.800]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[32:24.800 --> 32:27.480]  I mean, what's it going to take us being shut down?
[32:27.480 --> 32:28.480]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[32:28.480 --> 32:29.480]  You know what, Alex?
[32:29.480 --> 32:30.480]  I put him on pause again.
[32:30.480 --> 32:36.000]  Hey, Frank, do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're
[32:36.000 --> 32:37.880]  under attack, we need your help.
[32:37.880 --> 32:42.240]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[32:42.240 --> 32:45.240]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[32:45.240 --> 32:46.240]  Do you understand?
[32:46.240 --> 32:47.480]  I need your help, Frank.
[32:47.480 --> 32:49.760]  I need your help, Frank.
[32:49.760 --> 32:55.400]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and help fund the info.
[32:55.400 --> 32:56.400]  Do you understand?
[32:56.400 --> 32:57.760]  I need your help, Frank.
[32:57.760 --> 33:03.560]  Free press needs your help, Frank.
[33:03.560 --> 33:20.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:20.840 --> 33:36.160]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind.
[33:36.160 --> 33:50.360]  Folks, we have a ton of economic news, political news, a ton of tectonic news dealing with
[33:50.360 --> 33:56.360]  volcanoes and earthquakes massively increasing, especially on the US East Coast with top seismologists
[33:56.360 --> 33:59.240]  believing that the really big one could hit any day.
[33:59.240 --> 34:03.240]  We've already seen 8.2s off the coast of Alaska.
[34:03.240 --> 34:07.280]  We've already seen Mount St. Helens coming back to life like it hasn't done since it
[34:07.280 --> 34:08.280]  erupted in the early 1980s.
[34:08.280 --> 34:10.960]  So we're going to be looking at all of that as well.
[34:10.960 --> 34:17.480]  But I want to open the phones up on this Thursday edition to take a ton of your calls specifically
[34:17.480 --> 34:27.120]  on the secret Nunez memo that, again, he talks about the four pages in the memo that is from
[34:27.120 --> 34:32.000]  the classified FISA court memo.
[34:32.000 --> 34:35.880]  Those we've been told by high-level sources, including the former head of operations of
[34:35.880 --> 34:46.240]  the NSA, is the blacked out portions that are in that document.
[34:46.240 --> 34:52.240]  And the media uses this distraction process to say this is not the secret part Nunez has.
[34:52.240 --> 34:54.800]  We made that clear.
[34:54.800 --> 35:01.480]  This is the document that's been hiding in plain view that no one's covered that shows
[35:01.480 --> 35:06.480]  the illegal surveillance and the FISA court at least twice coming to Obama and saying,
[35:06.480 --> 35:07.880]  this is illegal.
[35:07.880 --> 35:10.280]  What are you doing?
[35:10.280 --> 35:18.200]  And it's got the names blacked out of Comey, of McCabe, of Loretta Lynch, of all the usual
[35:18.200 --> 35:19.200]  suspects.
[35:19.200 --> 35:20.680]  And that's what members of Congress have said.
[35:20.680 --> 35:24.040]  They've said this is going to embarrass Obama big time.
[35:24.040 --> 35:28.320]  This is going to hurt his legacy as Mr. Goody-Tushes.
[35:28.320 --> 35:31.520]  He's not Mr. Goody-Tushes.
[35:31.520 --> 35:34.640]  Incredible persecutor of the press and whistleblowers and you name it.
[35:34.640 --> 35:40.400]  So now after they said, oh, there is no memo, now Peter Schiff and now the Democrats and
[35:40.400 --> 35:45.320]  now the operatives in the Justice Department have changed their tune and they say, we do
[35:45.320 --> 35:47.960]  not want this released.
[35:47.960 --> 35:51.280]  Justice Department makes the last ditch effort to block release of FISA memo saying it will
[35:51.280 --> 35:53.760]  damage national security.
[35:53.760 --> 35:58.640]  And of course, there's other information, tons of other information.
[35:58.640 --> 36:06.720]  We get so focused on this memo, you've got thousands and thousands of texts that members
[36:06.720 --> 36:11.880]  of those committees, the intelligence committees, the armed services committees, the judicial
[36:11.880 --> 36:17.040]  committees are able to see and it is a love fest.
[36:17.040 --> 36:20.240]  They've already released.
[36:20.240 --> 36:21.880]  We're meeting in secret.
[36:21.880 --> 36:23.280]  We're creating insurance policies.
[36:23.280 --> 36:24.480]  We hate this guy.
[36:24.480 --> 36:27.200]  We can't let him get an office.
[36:27.200 --> 36:32.480]  You got to meet with McCabe and all that's been confirmed.
[36:32.480 --> 36:39.040]  And now more and more and more and more comes out and oh, now 50,000 texts or whatever have
[36:39.040 --> 36:42.560]  come up missing and oh, it's just a glitch in the phone.
[36:42.560 --> 36:49.400]  This is a giant cabal inside our government that covered for the crimes of the Clintons,
[36:49.400 --> 36:53.160]  that covered for the crimes of Obama, that covered for the crimes of the people around
[36:53.160 --> 36:54.160]  Bush.
[36:54.160 --> 36:55.160]  It's all the same group.
[36:55.160 --> 36:56.160]  They all vacation together.
[36:56.160 --> 37:01.760]  This is the good old boy secret society that Trump isn't part of.
[37:01.760 --> 37:06.040]  He's not part of that good old boy group.
[37:06.040 --> 37:09.520]  And they now understand that that whole thing is being destroyed.
[37:09.520 --> 37:13.720]  So they're now in a very, very dangerous position.
[37:13.720 --> 37:18.040]  They're in a dangerous position and they're willing to do anything right now to try to
[37:18.040 --> 37:23.280]  stop Trump, try to stop the reassurgence of Americanism, showing that we had artificial
[37:23.280 --> 37:29.360]  economic restraints on us to hold us down, that within one year we've already seen dramatic
[37:29.360 --> 37:30.880]  improvement.
[37:30.880 --> 37:32.600]  They're being destroyed by prosperity.
[37:32.600 --> 37:36.000]  Just like I said on inauguration day, I said Trump must deliver.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.320]  His name is bound to our success.
[37:38.320 --> 37:41.460]  His dynasty is bound to us, even if he was a sociopath.
[37:41.460 --> 37:48.240]  If he wants true historical victory and power, he would be the man to turn America around
[37:48.240 --> 37:52.880]  and to lead other countries out of globalist bondage and it's happening.
[37:52.880 --> 37:57.440]  Macron says the EU is on the verge of collapse if there was a referendum today, it would
[37:57.440 --> 37:58.440]  fall.
[37:58.440 --> 38:01.520]  Well, most nations never had a referendum to enter the EU.
[38:01.520 --> 38:08.560]  They were brought in just like NAFTA and GATT, just like WTO, just like the TPP, the Transpacific
[38:08.560 --> 38:15.360]  Partnership, into these global trade combines that are binding world governance in their
[38:15.360 --> 38:16.560]  own words.
[38:16.560 --> 38:20.760]  And the Indian leader, who's been a guy working with Trump, he's playing both sides, saying
[38:20.760 --> 38:25.440]  I like globalism, I want to work with a globalist, but you know, it's losing its luster.
[38:25.440 --> 38:27.240]  Trump is right.
[38:27.240 --> 38:34.080]  Well, globalism is the globalist system of world technotronic, technocracy government.
[38:34.080 --> 38:40.240]  Global and global connections is just part of the next development of the human species.
[38:40.240 --> 38:45.320]  They just want to package the inevitability of the move into that world system to make
[38:45.320 --> 38:49.480]  it undemocratic and command and control from the beginning.
[38:49.480 --> 38:52.560]  So this is a huge time to be alive.
[38:52.560 --> 38:57.360]  I want to give you the toll-free number to join us to talk specifically about Davos,
[38:57.360 --> 39:01.600]  what's happening there with Trump, what you think is going to come out in the memo, when
[39:01.600 --> 39:03.160]  you think it's going to come out.
[39:03.160 --> 39:09.520]  I was told that they are looking to release the secret portions of the memo and their
[39:09.520 --> 39:13.700]  report Monday or Tuesday of next week.
[39:13.700 --> 39:18.200]  But because it looks like the Justice Department is so rogue and that Trump doesn't control
[39:18.200 --> 39:23.040]  but only maybe the first layer that they may trust him in junctions or something or some
[39:23.040 --> 39:27.880]  type of congressional battle to block it, and the Democrats are rushing to put out their
[39:27.880 --> 39:33.440]  own fake memo that they admits just hyperbole and opinion.
[39:33.440 --> 39:37.080]  And so they may release it tonight or tomorrow.
[39:37.080 --> 39:41.880]  I've been talking to a lot of people that are talking to these congressmen and some
[39:41.880 --> 39:46.160]  of them women, and I'm just going to leave it at that, you know, we probably should just
[39:46.160 --> 39:52.080]  get Roger Stone on Dan Lyman from Switzerland and FullWars.com reporters on at the middle
[39:52.080 --> 39:53.080]  of the next hour.
[39:53.080 --> 39:56.680]  We should probably just shoot to get Roger on the start of the next hour if he can.
[39:56.680 --> 40:03.200]  Or when Tyler Nixon's in studio or one of our legal analyst, Roger, can come on at 1.30,
[40:03.200 --> 40:07.040]  because I want to see if he'll go ahead and talk about what his source has told him.
[40:07.040 --> 40:12.200]  Because I understand why he doesn't want all of this out now because they don't want it
[40:12.200 --> 40:13.200]  out now.
[40:13.200 --> 40:17.200]  You know, I really don't want to sit here and sit on top of this while the mainstream
[40:17.200 --> 40:22.120]  media tries to spin all of this.
[40:22.120 --> 40:23.480]  So we'll see what unfolds.
[40:23.480 --> 40:27.080]  I mean, some headlines say it's going to come out in the next two weeks.
[40:27.080 --> 40:31.920]  It's all up in the air right now, but more and more it's looking like early next week.
[40:31.920 --> 40:33.600]  And again, why is it so important?
[40:33.600 --> 40:35.640]  It exposes the shadow government.
[40:35.640 --> 40:36.960]  It exposes the deep state.
[40:36.960 --> 40:38.880]  It exposes the cabals.
[40:38.880 --> 40:46.880]  The secret societies that we know are the bane of any successful culture.
[40:46.880 --> 40:52.960]  That's right, Sarah Carter is saying it could be released this week.
[40:52.960 --> 40:58.600]  So we're going to continue to look at every angle of this, but this is a journey about
[40:58.600 --> 41:05.960]  us restoring our republic, rediscovering our own system and taking control of our own destiny.
[41:05.960 --> 41:08.560]  What's the process happening here?
[41:08.560 --> 41:17.960]  And it's the process of breaking the unconstitutional covert ties where global government is codified
[41:17.960 --> 41:26.880]  in legislative edict to be authoritarian, to be secret, and to be anti-human.
[41:26.880 --> 41:34.440]  And when you realize that, you realize that the quandary that decent people have that
[41:34.440 --> 41:38.400]  people, I don't want to run things and things aren't perfect and boy, things are a mess,
[41:38.400 --> 41:40.120]  they're trying to make it worse.
[41:40.120 --> 41:41.840]  They're trying to consolidate power.
[41:41.840 --> 41:42.960]  They're trying to make you poor.
[41:42.960 --> 41:46.200]  They're trying to poison you culturally and physically and spiritually.
[41:46.200 --> 41:51.400]  They're very, very nasty people that want a population of dumbed down serfs they can
[41:51.400 --> 41:53.560]  feed on.
[41:53.560 --> 41:58.000]  And so we have a job to remove them because we know they're a clear and present danger.
[41:58.000 --> 41:59.000]  We know they're bad.
[41:59.000 --> 42:05.280]  By the way, I'm very excited that the listeners are excited about bodies, our newest nutraceutical
[42:05.280 --> 42:11.480]  supplement, which for my research is the ultimate turmeric concentrate blend because it has
[42:11.480 --> 42:16.480]  a bunch of other known super antioxidants, the turbo charge that studies show accelerates
[42:16.480 --> 42:17.480]  its upload.

[42:28.920 --> 42:32.960]  Big brother and folks don't want us to obviously be able to even tell you or get into all that,
[42:32.960 --> 42:38.040]  but turmeric is something that every man, woman, and child should be taking every single
[42:38.040 --> 42:41.800]  day and the other compounds in bodies only make it stronger.

[47:13.400 --> 47:32.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[47:32.400 --> 47:40.840]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, thank you for joining us, two little corrections here.
[47:40.840 --> 47:45.120]  I should probably give the phone number out so people can call in when I said the phones
[47:45.120 --> 47:56.240]  were open 20 minutes ago, 877-789-ALAX, 877-789-2539 is the number to call in specifically on
[47:56.240 --> 48:00.520]  the secret memo, why the Democrats are so scared.
[48:00.520 --> 48:06.480]  The Congress folks that have told us that it will really expose Obama, it's a very
[48:06.480 --> 48:11.240]  sinister individual, how long is it going to take till they bring this out?
[48:11.240 --> 48:17.000]  Because I'm really worried that the cornered rats, as the walls are closing in, as Sean
[48:17.000 --> 48:23.240]  Hannity said last night, are going to really get even more aggressive.
[48:23.240 --> 48:28.000]  And you see Hollywood and the media saying kill the President, kill his supporters, attack
[48:28.000 --> 48:34.880]  his supporters, burn things down, bring down the government, shut down the government,
[48:34.880 --> 48:39.160]  they are really upset, this cabal, that it hijacked the nation.
[48:39.160 --> 48:44.320]  And they really thought we would accept the evil political corpse of Hillary Clinton running
[48:44.320 --> 48:45.820]  our lives.
[48:45.820 --> 48:50.120]  But everything they touch turns to absolute failure.
[48:50.120 --> 48:53.120]  877-789-ALAX.
[48:53.120 --> 49:00.040]  And the other correction, I don't have a teleprompter in here and I go from memory and I know it's
[49:00.040 --> 49:04.960]  Adam Schiff is the leader of the Democratic leader in the House of the Judiciary Committee
[49:04.960 --> 49:13.520]  and his counterpart is Nunez, the chairman, and he is going after the truth and first
[49:13.520 --> 49:18.080]  saying it isn't real and then saying it is real, don't release it, you're too stupid
[49:18.080 --> 49:19.080]  to understand it.
[49:19.080 --> 49:24.000]  So I'm going in Peter Schiff who is a great economist and researcher and was on with us
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.560]  last week or maybe it was Monday, so it's Adam Schiff, not Peter Schiff, so thanks
[49:29.560 --> 49:32.080]  for the crew pointing that out.
[49:32.080 --> 49:35.120]  Someday I guess I'm going to have to get like all the other talk shows and have my notes
[49:35.120 --> 49:40.080]  and just follow them, but I just go literally from a memory and research and we are getting
[49:40.080 --> 49:45.760]  this graphic posted on info wars.com as we speak and we are going to tweet it at real
[49:45.760 --> 49:51.500]  Alex Jones, it's hard to find on the epoch time website, it is their map of the insurance
[49:51.500 --> 49:59.800]  policy and the Clinton slash Obama secret society that had basically hijacked the government.
[49:59.800 --> 50:04.200]  So that is going to be coming up in the next hour as well.
[50:04.200 --> 50:09.840]  The toll free number again is 877-789 Alex and I don't normally screen your calls, it's
[50:09.840 --> 50:14.360]  a free for all, but we are screening them in that I want to specifically talk about
[50:14.360 --> 50:22.200]  this topic and or Trump in Davos because we were told he was going to screw us on DACA,
[50:22.200 --> 50:26.360]  didn't do it, but people that I know they're conservatives are still mad at him because
[50:26.360 --> 50:33.280]  they decided that that was happening and they won't admit they got conned by neocon media.
[50:33.280 --> 50:37.320]  That's the same thing here, he's going there to try to recruit companies back to the US,
[50:37.320 --> 50:45.920]  he's going there as a nationalist to cut unilateral deals to help the United States but also help
[50:45.920 --> 50:50.040]  the companies and or countries they're from so it's a two way street so you build up both
[50:50.040 --> 50:51.040]  economies.
[50:51.040 --> 50:52.040]  How do I know that?
[50:52.040 --> 50:57.560]  Trump told us his philosophy, he's been following through and he is as constant as the North
[50:57.560 --> 51:04.600]  Star and so I told you a week ago what he did with Davos, now it's already happened today.
[51:04.600 --> 51:09.480]  I'm here to cheerlead for America, I'm here to talk about nation states and how we need
[51:09.480 --> 51:13.520]  to control our own governments and have our people in charge and the value of human workers
[51:13.520 --> 51:18.880]  and not replacing them with robots and I'm here to talk about how this global order is
[51:18.880 --> 51:22.760]  unelected in the authoritarian and if you don't like it get out of the room, I've got the
[51:22.760 --> 51:25.600]  quotes here.
[51:25.600 --> 51:28.760]  They said you want a bitch, you want to complain as a CEO, you want to act like you're going
[51:28.760 --> 51:35.920]  to protest me being here, you're lucky I'm here and if you don't like it get out, if
[51:35.920 --> 51:39.920]  you don't like it don't go hear me when I speak, leave the room like everybody else
[51:39.920 --> 51:45.920]  does, you want to hear this speaker, that speaker, fine, leave the room.
[51:45.920 --> 51:51.120]  It's called free speech, I'm the head of the United States, I'm coming, I'm speaking to
[51:51.120 --> 51:52.120]  you.
[51:52.120 --> 51:58.080]  Dramatic HD footage from Dan Lyman, our reporter who's doing an amazing job writing articles,
[51:58.080 --> 52:04.840]  writing reports and also joining us live, Chow and Davos, those who don't want to listen
[52:04.840 --> 52:11.080]  to Trump can leave, yes that's his spokesperson that's there with him, as I just told you
[52:11.080 --> 52:16.760]  that is what the president said and boy they've desperately tried to get, oh the Muslim Union
[52:16.760 --> 52:25.080]  that they put the Islamist mayor in London, they voted to say Trump's not welcome in England.
[52:25.080 --> 52:32.640]  Just think about the mindset and how these people are operating but I want to get to
[52:32.640 --> 52:37.840]  some of these clips real fast because they're so important because it signifies something
[52:37.840 --> 52:42.640]  earth shattering, earth shaking, it'll change the world if you grasp it, if I grasp it,
[52:42.640 --> 52:48.200]  if we all continue to grasp it, as I've been saying for at least 15 years, globalism's
[52:48.200 --> 52:55.200]  criminal, it's unelected, it's authoritarian, it's anti-human, it's exempt from taxes and
[52:55.200 --> 53:01.200]  regulations and it operates by stealth and if we just have a public debate about it,
[53:01.200 --> 53:06.680]  keep exposing the IMF, the World Bank, the WTO, the TPP, all these groups that they're
[53:06.680 --> 53:11.840]  unelected transferring power to world government corporations and that they're giving us a
[53:11.840 --> 53:17.680]  bad deal as well, the nation states will turn against it and we will remove ourselves from
[53:17.680 --> 53:20.040]  this system before it ever gets off the ground.
[53:20.040 --> 53:24.000]  I said it's when they finally admit it's a global government and try to set up the
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.600]  world currency and the world tax and the world control and they try to lower the borders
[53:28.600 --> 53:32.400]  completely that the world will turn against them.
[53:32.400 --> 53:38.120]  That's common sense and so I hammered it and I hammered it with you the listeners and many
[53:38.120 --> 53:44.440]  other great people that understood history like the New American magazine and like Ron
[53:44.440 --> 53:50.600]  Paul and others knowing that we were making inroads with the public mind worldwide and
[53:50.600 --> 53:55.440]  that when they announced the world government, people would go, wait a minute, I've seen
[53:55.440 --> 54:04.840]  Nightline, I've seen Dateline, I've seen CBS, I've seen CNN, I've seen CNBC, I've seen
[54:04.840 --> 54:11.440]  the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, for 30 years say there's no world government,
[54:11.440 --> 54:18.120]  there's no global cabal, for 50 years the CFR isn't taking your sovereignty for 40 years.
[54:18.120 --> 54:25.160]  The Trilateral Commission is secret but don't worry about it.
[54:25.160 --> 54:28.360]  And we hammered it and hammered it and if you talked about it, you got black bald, you
[54:28.360 --> 54:37.560]  got kicked off talk radio, you got publishers will shut you down but now the fact that Bilderberg
[54:37.560 --> 54:42.600]  and all these things are the very same couple hundred billionaires who meet at Davos and
[54:42.600 --> 54:47.760]  meet at Bilderberg and meet at these events and their people are in key positions everywhere
[54:47.760 --> 54:52.760]  and they're setting up a system of total control and if we just kept hammering it, the truth
[54:52.760 --> 54:57.680]  would come out, they'd have to debate us face to face about their authoritarian activities
[54:57.680 --> 54:59.000]  and they would lose.
[54:59.000 --> 55:04.120]  We have now reached the point where they're having to debate us and going, listen, we need
[55:04.120 --> 55:07.040]  globalism, we need world government.
[55:07.040 --> 55:12.040]  We don't want a fractured world, well it's not fractured when we just simply don't let
[55:12.040 --> 55:18.480]  you screw us over and you exploit the workers and you lower wages and so their authoritarian
[55:18.480 --> 55:26.280]  nightmare is coming to an amazing crashing confrontation.
[55:26.280 --> 55:32.880]  They're not defeated yet but the very nature of a world transnational secret tax exempt
[55:32.880 --> 55:39.280]  group with diplomatic immunity running everything, they're never going to sell that and they're
[55:39.280 --> 55:45.600]  going to use third world populations in reverse colonialism to come in and drive down wages
[55:45.600 --> 55:55.960]  and be brainwashed into neo-leftist, anti-western, anti-European racist and now the left in
[55:55.960 --> 56:00.680]  major publications like The Economist says, we miscalculated demographics, we've got to
[56:00.680 --> 56:05.280]  get even more non-whites in and we'll defeat the West.
[56:05.280 --> 56:09.480]  And it's not really defeat the white thing, it's defeat nation states that can stand up
[56:09.480 --> 56:14.440]  for itself that had wealth that were first world that aren't a big third world population,
[56:14.440 --> 56:17.960]  you can dictate the terms of surrender to.
[56:17.960 --> 56:24.120]  They want us poor neo-futalistic fascism and I've had top economists on, you name it and
[56:24.120 --> 56:28.160]  they go, that's the best term I ever heard, that's exactly what it is, that is what it
[56:28.160 --> 56:29.160]  is.
[56:29.160 --> 56:34.800]  Yes, I've coined many of the terms today that are now used in the fight against the enemy,
[56:34.800 --> 56:41.880]  not because I'm that smart, it's neo-futalistic fascism, using socialism at the grassroots
[56:41.880 --> 56:42.880]  level of control.
[56:42.880 --> 56:46.800]  I didn't get to those clips, I'm going to come back, start going to calls, then I'm
[56:46.800 --> 56:51.720]  going to get to all the clips, Lou Dobbs says, we must declare war on the deep state, Sean
[56:51.720 --> 56:55.640]  Hannity gets it right, he says the walls are closing in on the globalist, on the secret
[56:55.640 --> 57:01.080]  societies, they're panicking, this is so important because the fact that everything we talk about
[57:01.080 --> 57:07.680]  is being mainlined now means they can never, no amount of censorship, no amount will ever
[57:07.680 --> 57:10.200]  put the genie back in the bottle.
[57:10.200 --> 57:16.440]  We have passed an incredible point of no return, an amazing milestone that is historical and
[57:16.440 --> 57:21.680]  that is incredible and that we should all hit our knees and thank God for the providence
[57:21.680 --> 57:25.880]  that's taking place and then be a little positive about you.
[57:25.880 --> 57:30.120]  I was brushing my teeth this morning, I just thought I got to get on air and thank the

[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:33.200]  The article has gone live on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:41.600]  Real collusion, graphic illustrates Dem's ties to phony Russian dossier and how they
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.720]  formed their own secret society.
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:52.160]  Obama deep state behind secret Trump coup attempt, Mueller witch hunt.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.280]  It's the most amazing graphic of many graphics we've seen.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:01:04.120]  They're excellent, exposing the insurance policy and it's all in their own words, their
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:09.160]  own admissions, how they have Trump and the American people in a pincer attack between
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.440]  Obama when he was still in office, Hillary, the Democratic Party, Republican allies, the
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:17.320]  corporate media and so much more.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:25.320]  So this powerful graphic is on infowars.com right now.
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:27.600]  It's very important to tweak that out.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:35.280]  It's very important to basically let people know this is what the Nunez secret FISA four
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.960]  pages out of the original FISA investigation.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:46.160]  We're going to put out a 99 page memo that says we were told to do illegal things.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.320]  The court did.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.680]  And that's the memo that the media goes, all that memo is already out, Jones.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:53.680]  Nobody look at that.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:57.520]  By the way, you can't look at WikiLeaks if you're not seeing in.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.160]  If you do, you're going to jail.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.160]  Como said that.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:06.480]  Well, now they just go, listen, don't look at any of that.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.080]  Look, those text messages you're hearing, that's fake.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.080]  There was no meeting with McCabe.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.280]  Now they go, okay, they're real text messages.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.080]  We met with McCabe and all the others got erased.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:20.760]  They're caught red handed folks and they're trying different distraction games with people,
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.320]  but it's not working.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.760]  So I'm asking the questions of listeners.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:36.080]  What's going to happen as these cornered rats begin to realize that nothing they've done
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.960]  has worked, nothing they've done has gotten them out of the trouble they're in.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:45.600]  So I'm going to go to break and come right back, go to Brendan, Mark, John, Candace,
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:52.120]  Josh, Jason, and many, many others on the other side of this short segment.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:56.000]  And then I'm going to read the article because it's excellent article and show some of the
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.040]  documents and tweets that are embedded in it from zero hedge.com that's on info wars.com.
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:09.040]  According to first leak, and again, this really isn't the first leak, they're daily beast
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.240]  is saying they have the first leak.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:15.200]  Everything you've been seeing with text messages that Congress is putting out are leaks.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.640]  Everything that Jim Jordan's been saying a week before and the next week it comes out
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.320]  is a leak.
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:24.320]  He's got him testifying in front of him going, I kind of feel like this might have been what
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.320]  happened.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:30.520]  And then they won't answer his questions, Ron Rosenstein or McCabe or any of them because
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:38.360]  they know they've got all the classified garbage of what they've done.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.600]  So if you know how to read between the lines, you know what's in there.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.240]  It's a bombshell four page memo.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:51.120]  The first started making waves last week and a half after it was made available for the
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.640]  full House representatives for viewing.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:00.120]  That's the full memo with over 60 GOP lawmakers calling for its release.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:04.600]  The Hill sources on both sides of the aisle tell the daily beast that it's only a matter
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.720]  of time before the general public is allowed to view the document.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.720]  Oh, thank you, daily beast.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.880]  That's like telling me the sun came up this morning, which is likely to stoke already
[01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:20.200]  inflamed tensions between GOP lawmakers and the individuals named in the league.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.800]  And then it gets into what's in there.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:27.480]  McCabe, Comey, Rosenstein.
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.240]  We already know through the Clinton cabal.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.160]  It's Rosenstein told Trump, hey, let's get McCabe.
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.640]  He really likes you.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.880]  He's the guy that was running the cabal for Comey and Mueller.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.000]  He's the stay behind network.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.280]  They're like, oh, sir, he's against what happened.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.280]  He's your man.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.400]  All right, Mr. McCabe, you're the head of the FBI, just get confirmed by the Congress.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.400]  You're my nominee.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:52.280]  Mr. President, they've really screwed you over.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:56.720]  Just turn around for me so I can pull this dagger out and stab you in the back immediately.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.720]  Yeah.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:02.200]  You know, I've got some talking points here about caveman from infowarslife.com.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:06.000]  But instead of going with those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  personally.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.800]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.440]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:19.600]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:25.000]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:32.480]  the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:41.600]  your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this ladies and gentlemen
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:46.640]  is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.560]  And it's amazing.
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:52.120]  Find out for yourself today at infowarsstore.com, what I can do for your family.
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:55.960]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support, you are funding the Information
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:06:16.560]  War in 2018.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:23.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.160]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.760]  All right, we're going to your phone calls right now.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:37.960]  We're talking about the secret FISA memo that is secret excerpted parts out of reportedly
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:44.000]  multiple memos and the proof that Obama was directing illegal spying against the Trump
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.480]  campaign, president-elect, and right up until the time that the president was sworn in.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:56.640]  And we saw incredible hubris by Brennan, by Clapper, by Schumer, and others saying, oh,
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.920]  the intelligence agencies are going to get you.
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.280]  You're never going to make it into office, or you're going to be out very, very soon.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:05.560]  And they've been all over TV saying, we're going to remove him in the next few months
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:11.400]  outside of impeachment, and Wolf Blitzer says to Brennan and to Clapper, well, how?
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.480]  And they go, oh, extrajudicial.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:20.120]  And then Phil Mudd goes on air two days later and says, the government's going to kill this
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.920]  guy, President Trump.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:27.560]  And then, of course, he saw Scalise shot in the attempt to take out the Republican Freedom
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.800]  Caucus leadership.
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.080]  So these guys aren't playing around.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:36.520]  And I told you back when all that happened last year, this is the stay behind networks
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:45.360]  at the FBI, at the CIA, at the NSA, at the Justice Department, and other agencies.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:49.080]  They were saying this in the Washington Post, New York Times, hold on, he'll be gone in
[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.080]  a few months.
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:51.080]  Don't follow orders.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:53.080]  It's your duty to be mutinous, sabotage.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:56.520]  I mean, they were in the news.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:59.320]  And so they got more shrill saying, we're going to kill you.
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.720]  You're going to be out by November.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:08.240]  You're going to be out by December because they knew their stay behind networks were
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.720]  on burner phones by then.
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:13.960]  They were meeting secretly already for six, seven, eight months.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.880]  Once the president had gotten into office, they were scared.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.720]  They were being watched now.
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.400]  Oh, yes.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:26.920]  And so they had to send McCabe out to go, that piece of crap will be gone in a few weeks.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.480]  We're going to kill him.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:31.560]  And have him all go on TV and say, he's dead.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.560]  He'll be gone.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:39.080]  I told you that was desperate, desperate disinfo to get their criminals to continue to man
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.080]  the post.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.720]  And we now have the emails.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:46.400]  We now have the text messages as Congress has them, they're going to release them.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:52.800]  These five congressmen, every time they say they've got this, they release it a week later.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.040]  And now they're saying, we've got FBI agents that blew the whistle to us.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:59.000]  Of course, that probably happened a year ago or more.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.560]  We've got all the documents.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.120]  We've got all the emails.
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.320]  We've got everything that this whole house of cards is coming down that they're scared,
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:13.120]  that they're using burner phones, that they're hiding out.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:17.040]  You don't think Congress wanted to bring all this out if they didn't have to, right?
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.760]  You think they wanted to really damage the FBI this much?
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.320]  You think they really wanted to bring it to this point?
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.440]  You think Trump wanted that?
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:25.040]  This isn't good for the stock market.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.920]  It's not good for the economy.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:27.920]  It's good.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:28.920]  It'd be good if Hillary goes to prison.
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:33.400]  Some people need to go to prison, but this is going to be huge now because they pushed
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.800]  it all the way.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:40.520]  And so now they're just watching the Democrats continue to perjure themselves, and they brought
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:44.080]  in McCabe, and they brought in Comey, and they brought in all these people, and they
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:50.120]  all perjured themselves, and they've got them all dead to rights.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.280]  And the congressman would look right at Rosenstein, who wouldn't answer questions, but he perjured
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:10:00.360]  himself, and say, I kind of feel like this is how it happened, and then of course, it's
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.960]  exactly how it happened.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:07.080]  I kind of feel like Rosenstein, this is how it might have happened, and Rosenstein sat
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:14.400]  there and squirmed around in his chair and wouldn't answer anything but with bizarre
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:20.360]  sideways activities, talking out of both sides of his mouth because they don't know what
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.360]  to do.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:29.280]  And the $4 trillion question is also your answer.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:32.760]  Program A was to stop the nomination and then steal the election or stop the president
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.520]  from being seated.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.040]  Program B was the whole fake Russiagate and try to get some dirt.
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.040]  That didn't work.
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:45.440]  So now plan C is obstruction, and then that kind of moves on into 25th Amendment, you're
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:47.680]  a lunatic, but that's gone nowhere.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:54.080]  So plan D is kill the president, which they've already been kind of trying to get to happen
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:58.960]  behind the scenes and trying to kill the congressman to send a message, and I mean, I'll give
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:10:59.960]  it to them.
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:01.920]  There's some really evil people.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:03.760]  They've already done a lot.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.720]  I'm surprised they're walking around right now.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:10.880]  I'll tell you, if I was the president, I guess I'd do what he's done.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:14.360]  He's given them a long game, letting them hang themselves, but it's dangerous because
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.800]  you know they got people in the White House.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.120]  You know they got people in the Secret Service.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.560]  So folks should be praying for the president.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.800]  This is beyond a thriller, beyond a movie, beyond anything.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.800]  This is sudden death over time for this country right now with these people, because let me
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:32.160]  tell you, if they're able to kill the president or able to get him out of there, they have
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:36.240]  said they're going out for everybody.
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.400]  And that's going to cause a civil war right there.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:42.800]  I mean, they've had their butts handed to them on every crime they've committed, every
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:50.880]  dirty trick they've played, every scam they've run, every fraud they've engaged in, everything
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:12:00.640]  they've pulled so far has blown up.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:03.520]  So I'll ask you again, what are they going to pull now?
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:08.280]  Because now they're cornered like a bank robber that the cops run in, so he grabs the kid
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:12.960]  and says, I got an hostage, I'll blow his head off, I'll blow his head off, and that's
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:18.960]  Comey, and that's Mueller, and that's all of them, and oh, and then there's this, I forgot
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.080]  this, guys, get the audio.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:27.920]  I didn't see her on the list, it's CNN's got it, it's all over, it's audio, Trump says
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.320]  he will go under oath with Comey.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.000]  He says, oh, I'll love to meet with him the next two to three weeks, and I love to go
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  under oath, but you know Hillary didn't go under oath when she met with Comey, no, no,
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.920]  Comey already gave her a letter absolving her, saying you're not under criminal investigation,
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.840]  but we're going to go to the media and say you are in the next six months, but it's
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:49.760]  all fake, and you're going to get to meet with Strock and everybody, and it's not a
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.640]  real investigation.
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:56.480]  She wasn't under oath, and Tar Mac meetings with Bill Clinton, the Attorney General on
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:01.040]  and on and on, so Trump says, oh, I'll meet with him, and I'll go under oath, and I've
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:06.480]  said this a hundred times, Mr. President, the only way this is going to work, and you're
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:10.880]  all literally, he's always a couple of steps ahead of me, so I'm guessing this is what
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.880]  he's going to do.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:21.360]  Have live cameras in there, bring that Mularin, that arrogant SOB, and set down that monster
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:27.920]  in front of you and say, all right, you got five minutes, buddy boy, and then I'm going
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.760]  to do the talking, and then lay into him with his whole history in uranium one and the criminal
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:39.080]  activity and McCabe and everything, and it will be the giant nail in their fraud you've
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:44.280]  ever seen in your life.
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:52.480]  It will be beyond devastating, and I said that a week ago, and a little bird told me
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:57.200]  that Trump is intending to just say, come on in, it's under oath, and he's going to
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:01.360]  sit right there with Mular in the ultimate stair down.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:06.800]  I should have led the show with this, there's just so much news.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:15.680]  The ultimate showdown, and then he's going to chew him out and say, in case you don't
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:22.440]  know, former director, this person, this person, this email, this document, what do you say
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.440]  about that?
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.240]  What do you say about Hillary meeting the secret?
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.240]  What do you say about all that?
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:27.960]  What do you say about not being under oath?
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:34.120]  What do you say about, you guys saying you weren't surveilling us, but you were?
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.080]  Because when Mular sits down in front of the president the next three weeks, it's after
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:42.280]  they've timed all this out with the freedom caucus.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:50.080]  When he, I'll be surprised if Mular even goes, because you talk about walking into the Dragon's
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:57.200]  Den, the Lion's Den, I mean, you are walking in there, buddy, here's the president.
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.880]  I'm looking forward to it, actually.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:14:59.880]  You have a date set?
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:03.720]  Here's the story, just so you understand, there's been no collusion whatsoever, there's
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:06.920]  no obstruction whatsoever, and I'm looking forward to it.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:11.800]  I do worry when I look at all of the things that you people don't report about with what's
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:17.440]  happening, if you take a look at the five months worth of missing texts, that's a lot
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:21.800]  of missing texts, and as I said yesterday, that's prime time.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:25.400]  So you just sort of look at that and say what's going on.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:30.280]  You do look at certain texts where they talk about insurance policies or insurance, where
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:34.440]  they say the kinds of things they're saying, you gotta be concerned, but I would love to
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.400]  do that, and I'd like to do it as soon as possible.
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.400]  What will you do, Mr. President?
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.400]  Do you have a date set?
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.400]  Do you have a date set?
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.400]  So here's the story.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.400]  Do you have a date set?
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.400]  Do you have a date set?
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.000]  I don't know, I guess they're talking about two or three weeks, but I would love to do
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  it.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.040]  And of course, you know, again, I have to say, subject to my lawyers and all of that, but
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.040]  I would love to do it.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.440]  Do you do it under oath, Mr. President?
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.080]  We'll be right back, and I'm going to your call, but then he finishes up, he says,
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:57.560]  oh yeah, I'll go under oath, but, but, but Hillary didn't.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:02.120]  Here's a special message for those of you who owe the IRS at least 10,000 or more in
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:03.240]  back taxes.

[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.480]  thousands of dollars.
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:15.880]  Call the federal tax management helpline that has been set up for you, 800-503-8625.

[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.920]  against you.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:27.840]  Those unique programs have been allocated to help the economy and significantly reduce
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:29.960]  or eliminate your tax burden.
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:34.840]  The IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements and other favorable programs.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:39.360]  You may qualify for substantial savings, so get the help you need.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:44.920]  If you owe more than 10,000 in taxes, call for free information and to see if you qualify.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:54.240]  Write down the number now for the federal tax management hotline, 800-503-8625.
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.480]  That's 800-503-8625.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:59.160]  Non-attorney paid spokesperson.
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.880]  Could your house go into foreclosure?
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.720]  Are you behind on your mortgage payments?
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:06.320]  Does it seem like the bank has no interest in helping you save your home and you feel
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.360]  like you have nowhere to turn for help?
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:10.680]  Then we have good news for you.

[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:15.640]  assistance.

[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.720]  If you're behind on your mortgage payments, being threatened with foreclosure, have been

[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.360]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:01.360]  Go ahead.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:03.680]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:07.360]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:14.320]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:20.520]  As a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force, Anthroplex.
[01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.240]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex, too.
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:24.240]  Thank you.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.920]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big, normal
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.920]  toothpaste fans.
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.000]  The Super Blue is awesome.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.640]  Thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.880]  They are quality.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.960]  I can't wait to get some more, and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:39.960]  healthy.
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:40.960]  Absolutely.
[01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:46.600]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:51.160]  that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:58.880]  to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:02.240]  Introducing Cell Force by InfoWars Life.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:06.320]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:09.080]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:11.640]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:16.400]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.880]  like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.360]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.800]  reactive oxygen species.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.960]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage, resulting from
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:33.840]  these reactive oxygen species.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:38.880]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.680]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:46.440]  species and other free radicals.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:51.480]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWars Life.
[01:19:51.480 --> 01:20:02.280]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:18.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:37.200]  Alex Jones, The Cure to Fake News, coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.400]  Let's finish up with the president since I was starting to get into the audio of him
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.520]  in the Oval Office yesterday.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:51.240]  I'll meet with Mueller and I'll go under oath, unlike Hillary Clinton did, but it was worse
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.240]  than that.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:55.000]  They told her, you're not under investigation, but we're going to say you are.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  We're going to stage it.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  You won't be under oath.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  That came out.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:03.120]  They gave her a memo saying, you're not under investigation, we're not coming after you.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.880]  You're not under oath before she'd do it.
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:11.840]  Oh, but Mueller wants him under oath, so imagine if Trump brings him in live video cameras
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:16.120]  and says, okay, you asked your questions, and I'm going to ask mine, and then use it
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:19.880]  to destroy him, to turn the tables.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:23.680]  Within three weeks when this meeting supposedly is going to come up subject to lawyers, that
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:28.200]  gives the president an ounce, it's all going to be out there, the memos, everything, they'll
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.720]  be lucky if they're not indicted by them.
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.320]  Let's go ahead and play this clip and then I'm going to your calls.
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.320]  Mr. President.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.480]  You mean like Hillary did and under oath?
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.480]  Who said that?
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:38.480]  I said that.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:39.480]  Did you do it under oath?
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.480]  Oh, you said it.
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.480]  You did say a lot.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.480]  Did Hillary do it under oath?
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.480]  I have no idea.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:44.480]  I'm not asking.
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:45.480]  I think you have an idea.
[01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:46.480]  Don't you have an idea?
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:47.480]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.480]  Do you not have an idea?
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.480]  Do you really not have an idea?
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.680]  I'll give you an idea.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:53.680]  She didn't do it under oath.
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.680]  I would do it under oath.
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:55.680]  But I would do it under oath.
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:59.640]  Listen, I would do it, and you know she didn't do it under oath, right?
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:02.640]  If you didn't do it under oath, if you didn't know about Hillary, then you're not much
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.640]  of a reporter.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.640]  You're going to do under oath.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.640]  Say it.
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:07.280]  To reach a higher standard, you would do it under oath.
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.280]  Oh, I would do it under oath.
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.280]  Absolutely.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.280]  Do you trust the FBI?
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:11.280]  Do you trust the FBI?
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.280]  I'm not going to say.
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:18.120]  I mean, I am very disturbed, as is the general, as is everybody else that is intelligent.
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:25.880]  When you look at five months, this is the great Rosemary Woods, right, with a step,
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:26.880]  right?
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.080]  This is a large-scale version.
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.080]  18 minutes.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.080]  That was 18 minutes.
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.080]  This is five months.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:36.640]  They say it's 50,000 texts, and it's prime time.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.640]  That's disturbing.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.640]  Say hello to each other.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.640]  Good bye, everybody.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.640]  Should McCabe go?
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:50.240]  Well, McCabe got more than $500,000 from, essentially, Hillary Clinton, and is he investigating
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.240]  Hillary Clinton?
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:52.240]  So should he go?
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.240]  Do you remember?
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:58.160]  Did anybody here, many of my speeches where I talked about McCabe, he was the star of
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.160]  my speech.
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.160]  This isn't now.
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:07.160]  And I said, a man who was more or less in charge of her, the wife's got $500,000 from
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.160]  Terry.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.800]  But Terry is Hillary.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.800]  And yeah, I mean...
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:14.480]  Do you regret having him as your acting FBI director then?
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:15.480]  You know what?
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.480]  I keep out of it.
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:18.280]  You'd find that hard to believe.
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:19.780]  I keep out of it.
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:21.280]  That's the way it fell.
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:22.280]  He's been there.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.280]  It's one of those things.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:28.760]  But he was the star of many of my speeches, because he got from $500,000 to $700,000, whatever
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.760]  the number was.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.760]  Got that money for the wife.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:37.640]  And you know, in Virginia, in Virginia, very interesting way, in Virginia, you don't have
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:39.240]  to spend the money.
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.160]  So I never checked as to whether or not they spent the money on the campaign.
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:45.520]  How much of the money did he spend on the campaign, you know?
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.520]  How much was it?
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.520]  Wait.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.520]  How much of the money was spent?
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.520]  Did you ask who he voted for?
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:50.520]  You know.
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:51.520]  I know.
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.520]  How much...
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:53.520]  Did you ask McCabe who he voted for?
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:54.520]  Did you ask him that?
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:55.520]  I don't think so.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.520]  No.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:57.520]  You don't think yet?
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.520]  No, I don't think I did.
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:23:59.520]  You did not.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:01.520]  I don't know what's the big deal with that, because I would ask you who you, who did you
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:02.520]  vote for?
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.920]  I don't think it's a big deal.
[01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:05.920]  But I don't remember that.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:08.480]  You know, I saw that this morning, I don't remember asking him that question.
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:09.480]  Is it possible you do?
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:10.480]  Is it possible?
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:11.480]  I don't remember asking him the question.
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:12.480]  You don't remember.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:17.280]  I think it's also a very unimportant question, but I don't remember asking him that.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:23.440]  Now, that's bombshell audio, and imagine what else CNN decided to not give you, okay?
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.680]  That's what they allowed you to hear.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:31.160]  By the time it was on CNN last night, I was watching Wolf Blitzer, just to tune in for
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.520]  like 10 minutes, and I go, that sounds edited.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:37.360]  That's why I went and searched out the audio last night, because he was like going, I'll
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:38.360]  go under oath.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.360]  It's prime time.
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.360]  You know what?
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:41.360]  That doesn't make sense.
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:42.760]  They were literally editing stuff.
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.480]  He says one minute in with another minute to make him sound crazy.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:53.160]  Now, CNN's website at least had a limited edit, three-minute audio chunk we just played.
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:58.640]  But see, at every level, they're manipulating, they're lying, and then look at this headline.
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:01.680]  They made it, oh, Trump will go under oath.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:06.360]  You know, like he's a criminal, when in the real news there is that the president's pointing
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:12.600]  out that McCabe got $500,000 from Hillary, which is on record, and then, of course, he
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:18.640]  got the head of the operation at the Justice Department transferring millions of dollars
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.080]  to his wife at Fusion GPS, I mean, this is crazy.
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.080]  Okay, enough of that.
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:25.120]  I'm going to your calls now.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.760]  I just forgotten about that bombshell, and it was very, very important to actually hear
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:33.560]  from the president before he got on an airplane and flew to Switzerland, where he's fighting
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:35.960]  for U.S. interest right now.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:46.040]  Jason, Black Thumper, Kevin, Dan, Candace, Mitch, John, Mark, Brendan, we need to go to
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.040]  all your calls here.
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:51.520]  I'll probably get to one or two in this little segment, but let's go ahead and go to Black
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.960]  Thumper calling from Washington.
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:54.960]  Go ahead, Black Thumper.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.880]  Hey, it's Black Thumper, Alex, great to be on with you.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:07.160]  I just wanted to say that as damning as this memo that's about to come out may be, I really
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.680]  don't have much faith in Jeff Sessions to actually do something about it.
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:16.400]  He's going to sleep at the wheel the entire Trump administration and hasn't done anything.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:23.280]  Hasn't done anything to go after Hillary or any of the major crimes that were committed.
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:27.160]  By the way, Black Thumper is kind of a new Disney movie, like Little Black Rabbit, that'd
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:28.160]  be cute.
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.600]  I apologize that the monitor so far away in the bright light look like Thumper.
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:32.600]  It is Trumper.
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:36.640]  Look, everybody's pointed that out thousands of times about Sessions, and he's got to
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.800]  be compromised.
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:38.800]  Everybody agrees.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:43.400]  Why in the world would he go along with McCabe to be the new FBI director, Rosenstein, this
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.200]  whole rogue group?
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:49.240]  It's clear that he's been intimidated, but who is doing a good job is the Inspector
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:54.160]  General of the Justice Department, and that's where the only sunshine's been coming from.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.760]  What do you think's going on?
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:56.760]  Yeah.
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:59.600]  All right, your phone's breaking up.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.600]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.600]  Let's go ahead and go to Jason in Florida.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.600]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:05.600]  Welcome.
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:06.600]  Hey, Alex.
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.600]  Love you.
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:08.600]  Love you, Joe.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:09.600]  Thank you.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.600]  Go ahead.
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:11.600]  Hey, I wonder if you saw the latest post by QAnon.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.960]  I guess it was two, three days ago.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:19.040]  He said something to the effect that the missing text may have something to do with an assassination
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:20.040]  plot.
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:23.160]  I've got one more point, too.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:29.880]  I've been in there at 4chan probably the last two, three months, and there's a lot of criticism
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:32.400]  of you on there.
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:39.680]  Most of the centers around the Israel haters, of course, and I just thought maybe if you
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:46.920]  could spend a little more time debunking the Israel runs of the world BS, you might be
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:52.000]  able to rope some of these guys in that are on there that's pretty fanatical, and I don't
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.160]  know if some of them are even that serious about it.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.640]  They might just be disinformation.
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:56.640]  Yeah.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.640]  Look, exactly.
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:02.080]  Most of that's bots in sock puppets in Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL people.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:05.760]  I mean, they admit half the folks at one of those clan rallies or whatever, ADL or Southern
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:09.400]  Poverty Law Center, or anti-fub sheep dip groups.
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:11.240]  I just ignore all that made up stuff.
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:13.400]  They're corrupt groups in every society, in every group.
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:17.600]  I promote free market capitalism and Western civilization, and that's why the globalists
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.880]  hate me and use a pincere attack of left-wing and right-wing attacks, but as for your point
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:28.200]  about QAnon, our story was on DrudgeReport.com yesterday, actually dealing with the reports
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.200]  that that is.
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:34.720]  Some of what is in the secret text that Congress has that we've not seen, some of these thousands
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:40.560]  and thousands of texts that is that plan report, missing FBI text messages include threats
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:43.280]  of violence against Trump.
[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:44.760]  This is Dangerous Territory.
[01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:45.760]  Thank you, Jason.
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:46.760]  Great points.
[01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:51.480]  I'm going bam, bam, bam, through your calls on the other side, then live from Switzerland,
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:53.800]  Dan Lyman, and much more.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:57.520]  We'll be back.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.520]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.800]  A big, burky water filter is the one you need, period.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:04.880]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other
[01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:08.920]  endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:10.920]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:15.560]  The original, most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Burky, and now GCN listeners
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:19.320]  receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:23.800]  Call or click 1-877-99-Burky or BigBurkyWaterFilters.com.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:27.600]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.560]  Hawaii was a wake-up call.
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:31.880]  Don't be caught without a disaster shelter.
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:36.880]  Atlas makes an all-disaster shelter that will protect your family from fallout, tornadoes,
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:42.440]  and hurricanes for only $99.99. That also includes the NBC air filtration system, solid
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:46.160]  steel construction with an airtight, bulletproof door.
[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:48.280]  That's right for $99.99 and up.
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:55.120]  Call 1-855-4-Bunker or go to IWantThatShelter.com, Atlas Survival Shelters, the world leader
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:56.760]  in fallout shelters.
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:01.840]  Not a group you develop living defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:03.560]  Why is this so good?
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:08.160]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:12.920]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:18.600]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:21.920]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:27.040]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:28.280]  going on everywhere.
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:29.280]  These are all parasites.
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:32.000]  Tell us about all the stuff you said that there's so many things that are in it.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.360]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:39.640]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:42.800]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.000]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.

[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:02.760]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you

[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:31.920]  Customers have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder

[01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:01.760]  Infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:06.360]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:11.880]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:13.280]  and normal breathing.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.280]  This is pollen block.
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:19.640]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:25.680]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:27.320]  and excessive mucus production.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:32.120]  They began studying the effects in their public trials.
[01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:38.280]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast acting chewable tablet, just two tablets
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:43.080]  at the first sign of seasonal distress and fast acting pollen block starts working in
[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:46.680]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:53.160]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast acting pollen block available now at infowarslife.com
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:33:19.560]  or by calling toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:47.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're watching on television, you can see our HD footage shot
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:53.960]  today on the plateau right beneath the mountain there in Davos, the town of Davos, Switzerland
[01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:59.320]  with their own Dan Lyman shooting Marine One coming in for a landing, the president getting
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:04.840]  out, military on the roofs with sniper rifles, Dan Lyman's coming up.
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:09.640]  In the next segment, we'll continue with your calls right in to the next hour as well and
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.080]  I'm going back to your calls as we speak right now.
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:17.880]  You can see a very clear, beautiful sunny day there in Davos, a little bit better than
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:23.160]  it was with all the global warming, the record snow that I guess just stopped falling yesterday,
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:29.240]  but it's gotten nice and sunny for the presidents to arrive and again, am I gloating?
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:31.240]  Am I very thankful for Trump?
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.320]  Yeah, we don't have Hillary Clinton.
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:35.360]  The globalists are pulling their hair around.
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:39.880]  We're exposing deep state criminal cabals that protected the Clinton crime network.
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:45.160]  Yeah, they want to make everybody secretly support the president, you know, those of
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:50.120]  us that do, they want to make us secretly do it so they can run around terrorizing everybody
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.560]  and intimidating everybody.
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:57.320]  So the more they attack, the more they bully, the more I support the president.
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:01.720]  All right, let's go right back to your phone calls here.
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:04.360]  Let's talk to Brendan in New Jersey.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.360]  Brendan, thank you so much for calling today.
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:09.000]  Hey Alex, how are we going today?
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  Good, brothers.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  Thanks for calling.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.200]  Yeah, I just wanted to call and talk about the memo.
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:19.000]  The other day when you, I think it was Monday or something, when you had that, when you
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:27.600]  leaked the full 99 page memo, I probably took about a good 20, 30 minutes out of my day.
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.600]  Go ahead and read that.
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:34.040]  I only read about halfway through it and now I also heard you report on certain news
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:40.480]  networks or certain congressmen are saying that, you know, the public isn't educated
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:44.040]  enough to understand what's in the memo.
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.840]  I don't have high school diploma.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.840]  I don't have any type of degree at all.
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:52.520]  Reading through that memo, man, are you right dead on?
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:36:00.240]  It definitely doesn't uncover who did what, but definitely uncover some shadiness where
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:05.080]  defy the courts are saying, hey, you know, there's certain things you can't be doing
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:09.800]  and people are just turning away blind eye and by God, I really hope something comes
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:14.720]  out of it because, you know, Trump's doing a wonderful job in office.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:19.280]  You know, you can't, you can't take shots at him where you want, but what he's doing
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:24.400]  for the economy, what he's doing for the country itself is incredible, incredible, man.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:27.120]  I just love every second of it.
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:32.080]  You know, the, the surgeon coming back in the economy, you can just, you just feel walking
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:38.120]  around, you know, you go to a shopping center, it feels like we're coming back to life.
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:39.120]  Absolutely.
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.280]  God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:42.640]  This is just out.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:46.320]  DOJ says the release of the memo would be reckless and dangerous.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.160]  They're already saying don't release it this morning.
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:53.680]  This is new and they're announcing representative King says memo will be voted on Monday.
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:56.040]  What did I say first hour for my sources?
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:58.520]  They said it looked like there'd be a vote on Monday.
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:05.320]  That's what I got from my congressional source and I've got to get, I've got to get Roger
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.320]  Stone on today.
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.800]  He wasn't scheduled today, but he's, he's got a meeting.
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.560]  I'm trying to get him to cancel to come on and get into the news he has on this front.
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:18.400]  But to be specific, we came on and said he's got a compitium of info from secret Pfizer
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:25.320]  memo and other things to expose Obama's involvement, McCabe's involvement, the holy legal thing.
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:28.200]  And that's not come out in the news.
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:31.320]  Then Benny goes, I just got a call.
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:35.440]  They're saying the secret parts are the excise parts of this memo, but this is the general
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:41.120]  memo and he said, look at page 15, look at page 19, like the caller said by the time
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:45.400]  he, you know, got 20 pages in, it's, it's, it's Pfizer court saying, Hey, this is illegal.
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:48.880]  What you're doing and you're doing, this is illegal with the warrant doesn't say you can
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:49.880]  do this.
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:52.360]  And the way you got the warrants bad, that's the point.
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.880]  It was illegally done.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:56.640]  So we know what's in the memo.
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:01.920]  It just further dams them with all the text messages and all the coverups and the secret
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:05.800]  society and the insurance policy and everything.
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:07.840]  So what do they do?
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:10.160]  They go noon as doesn't have anything.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:12.920]  That was Monday.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:18.400]  Then on Tuesday, Adam shift goes, okay, but it's too complex for you to understand it.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:21.680]  And now on Wednesday, they say, don't release it on Thursday.
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:22.920]  It's, it's damaging.
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:23.920]  It's deadly.
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:24.920]  It's horrible.
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:25.920]  No, no, no.
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:26.920]  Don't, don't release it.
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:27.920]  Whatever you do.
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:28.920]  No, no, no.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:33.400]  And that's what I was told from my sources and I'm talking Fox news sources.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:35.320]  I'm talking congressional sources.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.600]  They've been told Monday, probably that's what I said at the start of the show today.
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:40.600]  So there you go.
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.760]  And there's an article just came out.
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:45.080]  Who is that out from?
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:46.080]  That's out of that.
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:47.080]  I WB.
[01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:48.080]  Okay.
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:52.320]  So we'll look at those statements and, and, and that video report and check into that.
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:57.960]  That's the same information that we're getting and it's open and shut folks because they
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:05.640]  testified before Congress, the opposite of what is in the memo and what is in the excise
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:13.080]  memo and the, and the declassified portion is 90% of it or more, but 90% of the non blacked
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:15.740]  out area says it was basically illegal.
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:19.600]  So the FISA court was saying what Obama did for Hillary was illegal.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:22.080]  That's pretty bombshell.
[01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:23.480]  I mean that's in this memo.
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:26.120]  They go, Oh, that's not in Alex or that's not the secret part.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:27.440]  Everybody don't look at that.
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:32.920]  He's fake news and half the right-winger libertarian media jumped on board because it's fun.
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:34.960]  You know, Oh, Alex must be our competition.
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:35.960]  Let's tear him down.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:39.880]  Let's say he's full of crap and William Bennett, he just ran the NSA.
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:42.680]  He's like the top whistleblower ever screw him.
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:45.400]  He just got swat teamed over at all.
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.080]  You don't, he doesn't know anything.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:49.080]  Okay.
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:51.440]  Whatever floats the boat.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:55.560]  All I know is that's what Benny got told and he meets with Pompeo at the CIA.
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:57.760]  I'm going to stop right there.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:02.880]  We're told that that's where the pieces come from in this memo.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:06.240]  He says that is the secret FISA memo.
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:11.600]  Well that's the big report that's got the whole file of what Obama did to Trump in it.
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.080]  So the excise black parts are the part that's in it.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:17.840]  But again, they do this Jedi mind trick.
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:19.680]  Oh, that's been out for a while.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:22.040]  Just shut up, Jones.
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:23.040]  Okay.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:24.040]  Fine.
[01:40:24.040 --> 01:40:28.200]  Watch and see what comes out in the memo.
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.400]  And then Nunes is going to have a glossary reportedly.
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:35.800]  Like I said a few days ago, we were told by congressional sources, they got it ready.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:38.920]  This is what they put out to Congress to show folks what's going on.
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:42.400]  And now they've given the Democrats time to produce a new memo that they're going to counter
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:43.560]  this one with.
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:45.680]  But this is going to be documents and snapshots.
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:49.200]  And then this person did this and that person did that and they control this person with
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:55.080]  their own admissions and then them perjuring themselves before Congress.
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:59.560]  But I mean, I tell you, I've noticed the bigger the news, the more it isn't a big deal.
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:02.440]  If I put some room around, it'd be the top story.
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:07.160]  But if I've got bonafide document that admits they illegally surveilled Trump during the
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:15.320]  campaign and when he was president-elect, no one even talks about it or cares.
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:20.520]  And it's the memo.
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:21.520]  Who's up next here?
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:23.920]  I love taking these calls.
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:29.440]  Let's talk to Josh and Colorado Springs where the Defense Department shadow government's
[01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:30.440]  located.
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:31.440]  Go ahead, Josh.
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:33.960]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:38.960]  This memo stuff sounds like something out of a Marvel Comics Hydra.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:39.960]  You know?
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:40.960]  It does.
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:45.920]  But anyways, these people seem to be backed into a corner.
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:48.680]  They're running out of room.
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:49.680]  People are paying attention.
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:53.240]  I think they're going to use some sort of secret technology.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.000]  I think they're going to try and do a magician.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.080]  They're going to distract everybody with one hand.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:05.080]  Well, it was a Secretary of Defense, Cohen, that said in 1997 in April to Army Times and
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:08.560]  a press conference that governments have tectonic weapons.
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:12.880]  I mean, what do you think they might set off on an earthquake or something?
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:20.240]  I'm thinking possibly more lines, maybe like a Tesla directed energy or maybe a bio weapon,
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:24.080]  something where they could use their eugenics control population.
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.080]  I mean, these people are dead.
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:28.560]  They use the anthrax scare to cover up the criminal involvement in 9-11.
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:29.560]  You're absolutely right.
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:30.920]  In fact, I think you're right.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:36.240]  A biological false flag would be a great way to keep the deep state in place.
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:41.960]  Yeah, and think about what Kim Jong-un just used to kill a stepbrother, that chemical
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:44.400]  act, that stuff was designed by us.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:46.680]  So who knows what they could use.
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:49.880]  We've made both of the stuff.
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:51.560]  Josh, do you have more to add?
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:52.560]  No, that's all.
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:53.560]  Thank you, sir.
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:54.560]  God bless you.
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:55.560]  That's amazing.
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:58.400]  We'll go take you to Switzerland and straight ahead.
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:03.120]  Introducing FloraLife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLife.
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:07.760]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:12.440]  FloraLife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:16.560]  and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:21.040]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted
[01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:25.200]  delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:30.120]  FloraLife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity,
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:32.560]  immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:36.600]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:41.200]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:45.920]  FloraLife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:49.240]  probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:53.520]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of FloraLife probiotics today.
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:55.520]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:59.400]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:00.400]  Go ahead.
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:04.760]  Well, I just have to say something, man, it seems like every time I turn on your broadcast,
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:05.760]  you're bragging.
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:06.760]  It just gets old, man.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:10.040]  I'm going to shut you down right now, okay?
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:12.280]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:16.520]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:18.920]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:22.080]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:23.640]  I mean, what's it going to take?
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:24.760]  Us being shut down?
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.760]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:26.760]  Yeah, you know what, Alex?
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:27.760]  I put him on pause again.
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:28.760]  Hey, Frank!
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:34.240]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack,
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:35.240]  we need your help?
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:39.520]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:42.520]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:43.520]  Do you understand?
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:44.760]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:47.040]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:52.680]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:53.680]  Do you understand?
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:55.000]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.800]  Free press needs your help, Frank!
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:44:59.800]  I'm so excited.
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:05.280]  The new product at InfoWarsLife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled to
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:09.920]  the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:15.400]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:18.400]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:24.320]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:30.960]  but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:36.040]  and I came up with our own formulae, working with scientists and developers, non-GMO, made
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:42.680]  right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:47.120]  which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:48.840]  hormones in your glands.
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.600]  It is amazing.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:46:00.400]  Red pill, now available at infowarsstore.com and your purchase of the operation.
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:04.480]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:08.960]  if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm going to speak for hours, this is on the
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:13.640]  files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this.
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:18.840]  This is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year, but
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:25.040]  the immune wall is incredible and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70-80.
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.600]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:32.720]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf, and so much more, it is concentrated, you need
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.320]  to go read what is in here.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:39.280]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:43.280]  accelerate a citrus peel blend, I mean, this is the next level.
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:47.480]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, immune wall, I think is beyond seasonal.
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:53.120]  Click, look, and olive leaf and more, immune wall, M4WareStore.com, M4WareLive.com or triple
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:47:01.720]  eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:19.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:36.400]  Alex Jones, back live, coming to you from the ATX, Austin, Texas.
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:42.200]  On screen, you see a Fox News camera inside the World Economic Forum as President Trump
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:47.680]  meets with world business leaders, and we've got the HD footage of your TV viewer that Dan
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:53.920]  Lyman shot earlier today as President Trump with three Marine-1 helicopters, Blackhawks,
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:58.320]  arrived there in Davos to put in another 18-hour workday.
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:03.160]  Works about 15 hours a day when he's regularly back in the U.S. 18 hours a day, according
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:04.160]  to sources.
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:13.280]  And just as I have been telling you, the four-page memo is only redacted parts of the FISA memo,
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:18.000]  and I'm told there could be several as well, but that part of the memo we have is the part
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  that's in there.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.960]  And we've talked to Congressman, and Matt, one of the producers said, oh, yeah, Congressman
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:30.200]  Gates of Florida was on CNN today with Como and said, listen, it's not just the four-page
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:32.520]  stuff out of the FISA memo.
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:38.840]  That's what's damning because it shows Clinton running it with Obama.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:42.360]  It's all the supporting documentation we're going to put out, and that's what I've been
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:47.480]  saying since last week, is that it's not just a four-page memo.
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:53.920]  They're just talking about super-damning stuff in the four-page memo, okay?
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:59.400]  That is out of the larger, previously classified report that the FISA court put out saying
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:01.160]  we found wrongdoing.
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:02.640]  Here's what happened.
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:08.280]  The court reported on what happened because it was criminal activity, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:12.680]  and that's what Nunes is getting at, and then the perjury about what the FBI and Justice
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:15.680]  Department testified about, what they did at FISA.
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:16.800]  That's why it's critical.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:26.120]  But there's all this other accompanying, as I said, breakdown of other accompanying document
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:28.520]  just like you have a bibliography at the back of a book.
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:32.120]  And I was saying that last segment because that's what our congressional sources said
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:35.320]  and some at Fox News.
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:39.480]  But Roderstone, you see him on Fox News, other people, he talks to those folks, they're his
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:40.480]  friends.
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:42.840]  They're getting the same stuff we're getting.
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:47.480]  That's how he knew about, you know, so many of these firings or so many of these hireings
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:52.920]  or that's how he knew about how they were planning to get rid of certain people was
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:53.920]  from Fox News.
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:59.240]  And then they try to spend the fact that, oh, he got it from the Russians, no.
[01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:01.600]  You get news from the U.S. news sources.
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:06.440]  You don't get it from the Russians, but they do this over and over and over again.
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:10.520]  So I got a lot of other news other than the memo, I want to get into Davos, what Trump's
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:11.520]  doing there, what's unfolding.
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:15.280]  I'm going to get back your calls, Mark and John and Mitch and Candace and Kevin and
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.280]  Dan.
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:17.280]  Candace will be up next.
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:22.600]  But for this segment and the next, the next 10, 15 minutes or so, Dan Lyman, infowars.com,
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:25.120]  reporter is on the ground in Davos.
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:30.000]  We haven't talked to him for 24 hours, so a lot has transcribed, you can follow his
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.120]  amazing tweets and information, not just retweeted at real Alex Jones, but also on
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:38.880]  his Twitter account that we'll put up on screen for TV viewers.
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:43.360]  And again, if you're a radio listener, you want to see all the video, the things we're
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:50.040]  talking about, infowars.com, forward slash show, and it's totally free, but please support
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:51.040]  our local affiliates.

[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:56.120]  it.
[01:50:56.120 --> 01:51:00.680]  We're using a real hardcore news organization here that gives the whistleblowers a place
[01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:02.360]  to get their information out.
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:10.400]  So please, infowarsstore.com, we have our new bodies, ultimate turmeric formula way stronger
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:13.560]  and purer than any other stuff on the market that we know of.

[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:22.360]  It's 50% off out of the gates, $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification system,

[01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:32.880]  This is 200 bucks is a great deal, 149, it's unbelievably good.
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:39.160]  It's got 4.9 stars by power reviews, 97% reviews.
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:45.040]  Nobody gets that infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple eight two five three three one three
[01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:46.040]  nine.
[01:51:46.040 --> 01:51:51.800]  And again, you cannot find a media organization and believe me, I know I'm obnoxious, but
[01:51:51.800 --> 01:51:55.680]  the guests, everything we do, that's more effective than infowars.
[01:51:55.680 --> 01:51:57.240]  So thank you for your support.

[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:05.400]  of our new pollen block that people are just loving.
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:06.680]  It's all natural.
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:11.120]  Take advantage of the bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:16.400]  Take advantage of the specials at infowarsstore.com and make this information war continue to
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:17.400]  be possible.
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:18.400]  Thank you.
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:19.400]  All right, Dan Lyman.
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:20.400]  Wow, a lot's happened.
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:23.560]  This HD footage in the background, while you give us a briefing, where do you want to start
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:26.680]  on day one of Davos as President Trump arrives?
[01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:27.680]  Good evening, Alex.
[01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:29.480]  Good to be back with you.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:32.000]  It was definitely an interesting day with Trump's arrival.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.320]  The helipad was a lot more crowded than it has been on the other days, which is kind of
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:40.800]  a slap in the face to the other leaders that have been showing up in the past days that
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:45.360]  people I guess weren't as interested in was very crowded out there, but it was great to
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:46.360]  see him come in.
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:48.480]  It was magnificent to behold.
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:53.480]  Man, the footage you've shot, you must be a professional photographer on top of all your
[01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:55.480]  other skills.
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.600]  What's the mood?
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:01.160]  What are you hearing from locals?
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:05.120]  The thing about Trump and the thing about what I'm hearing from people around here is
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:09.280]  that I would say that even the people who don't like him are still fascinated by the
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:10.800]  prospect that he's in town.
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:13.360]  There's kind of an aura that he brings with him.
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:17.960]  When I was trying to seek the best vantage point for the helipad, I happened to bump
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:21.760]  into an Australian woman who does live in the area.
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:24.840]  She was walking with me and she happened to know the lay of the land, so I was kind of
[01:53:24.840 --> 01:53:25.840]  sticking with her.
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:29.200]  She was very nice, and then eventually she asked me what I think about Trump.
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:32.520]  I said, well, I'm an American, but I live here in Switzerland.
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:34.880]  She said, oh, well, then that tells me everything I need to know.
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:36.840]  I said, actually, it doesn't.
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:37.880]  She was very surprised.
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:42.240]  She just assumed I was one of these expats trying to get away from Trump's America, but
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:46.000]  in reality, I'm one of his biggest supporters.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:51.520]  And we kind of went back and forth a little bit, and she called him extremely destructive.
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:54.200]  And I kind of left it off there because I didn't want to get into it with her.
[01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:59.160]  She was very nice, but I just don't understand how people can still call Trump destructive.
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:01.160]  It blows my mind.
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:09.080]  Plus, if you actually look at the real numbers, it's globalism that's destructive.
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:11.360]  It's globalism that's authoritarian.
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:13.720]  It's globalism that drives down wages.
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:15.960]  It's globalism that impoverishes the third world.
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:18.280]  It's globalism that's tax-exempt.
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:24.120]  And so it's just always such an ignorant, nittying statement from pseudo-intellectuals
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:30.280]  that might pick up a Rothschild-published Economist magazine once or twice a year, and
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:34.480]  they just restate these talking points over and over again because Trump doesn't want
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:40.160]  to give a bunch of multinational corporations complete carte blanche to overrun nation-states
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:41.800]  and the voters.
[01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:43.840]  Absolutely.
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:50.000]  And to follow up with that, she did praise Australia and Switzerland for their little
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:54.440]  bit set aside from the globalism in general, especially Switzerland being in the midst
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:55.440]  of the EU.
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:00.200]  But she said that's the strengths of these countries, that they're a little bit separated
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:03.400]  from the globalist enclave.
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:06.600]  And I was just thinking in my head, well, that's exactly what Trump wants for the United
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:07.600]  States.
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:13.120]  He doesn't want to do business with these countries and do bilateral agreements, it's
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:17.960]  just that he doesn't want us interwoven into this globalist economic web that is clearly
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:21.680]  taking so many first-world countries down to a second-world status.
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:23.480]  You know, that's the funny thing.
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:27.360]  Most Democrats I know that do have a business will not pay taxes, and the conservatives
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:32.080]  all know, pay them religiously even though they don't like them, and it's the same thing.
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:36.040]  Leftists will be trying to hide out in the middle of nowhere, and then they never liked
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:40.440]  the policies of globalism, but then here comes Trump destroying it, and then they hate him,
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:43.240]  and they're only doing it to virtue signal, you see.
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:47.600]  Even though his ideas actually probably line up with theirs more than the Barack Obama,
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:50.920]  they just feel good that they're bandwagoning with the media.
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:55.720]  Don't they get mainstream media's a joke?
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:55:57.040]  Groupthink is very powerful.
[01:55:57.040 --> 01:55:59.600]  There's a collectivism, there's a powerful drug.
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:04.320]  So I think that that still has a hold on a lot of people's minds, but as we spoke about
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:09.080]  last night, there is definitely an awakening, and it's happening even at the highest levels,
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:10.080]  even within Davos.
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:15.960]  You have the defectors here and there, and this video that you're airing right now,
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.560]  I watched that earlier today.
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:22.080]  The awe that Trump puts everyone in, he silenced the room, someone called it that he had turned
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:28.040]  Davos into Versailles, and it was an incredible reception that he received there, and I think
[01:56:28.040 --> 01:56:31.960]  they all know they're in the presence of a lion, a true alpha male.
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:36.440]  Just because he's going against the grain, they're a bunch of followers following something
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:41.320]  set up by the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers at the end of World War II.
[01:56:41.320 --> 01:56:44.840]  They tried to launch the same thing at the end of World War I, and it failed.
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:49.720]  They're all just following along, putting their money and power into this thing to build
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:54.760]  this big, unelected world government that no one's ever going to accept, Dan.
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:56.200]  I think it's just easier for them.
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:59.840]  They'd rather have someone else do these things for them and then either be employed
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:05.160]  by them or just be in the hierarchy somehow above all the plebs and the peasants.
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:09.200]  Even on the ride in, we're staring at feet of snow, and I overhear people talking about
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:12.320]  global warming on the way in, and they're attributing it to that.
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:16.560]  I find that shocking, but as I said, collectivism is a hell of a drug.
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:17.560]  Well, it is.
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:22.560]  I've got articles on nfullwars.com where a guy tweeted out there are only two genders,
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:25.760]  and he got fired from his job, and people are calling for more.
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:27.520]  I mean, there are only men and women.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:32.320]  Doesn't matter if you describe yourself as a golden dragon or a beautiful ornate building
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:35.520]  or if I describe myself as Colonel Sanders.
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:41.800]  It's just not true, but it's all about them making us accept what they want us to accept.
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:43.680]  It's not about being nice to somebody.
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:45.280]  It's about being in a cult.
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:46.280]  We'll be back.
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:47.360]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:53.720]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first, just encouraging
[01:57:53.720 --> 01:58:00.120]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books

[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:57.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:57.920 --> 02:00:14.240]  We now take you live to the Central Texas
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:20.640]  Command Center and the heart of the resistance is Alex Jones.
[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:24.440]  So Dan Lyman is in Switzerland, he got Trump's arrival, all of it amazing.
[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:26.000]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.640]  Mark, John, Mitch, Candice is up first, Kevin, Dan and many others as we look at the release
[02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:34.520]  of the memo supposedly coming on Mondays, what I've been told, but we'll see.
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:40.880]  You were describing how the press is saying he silenced the room, people were in awe,
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:45.760]  it was like being at Versailles, which I mean, I guess the royal court of the Sun King
[02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:49.560]  at Versailles because it's Macron calling himself the Sun King.
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:53.480]  Looks like that's starting to happen with Trump without him saying it, Mr. Lyman.
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:57.720]  In a way, it was just a video that I caught coming back on the train and it was just so
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:02.560]  powerful that the caption had said something to the effect of this is true power.
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:07.200]  Trump silence is a room full of media journalists and globalists and it's true.
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:09.080]  I mean, these people, they don't shut up.
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:12.320]  If I hear them talking constantly, they're always on the phone, they're talking to each
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:16.080]  other and then when you see Trump coming in the room, it's just like every cell phone
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:23.320]  is out, everyone's in awe, Trump brings that Trump aura, which translates so great to just
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:29.560]  the American aura, the power, confidence through strength and peace as well and he just brought
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:33.480]  that into the room and you could see that in that video in his entrance in general.
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:42.400]  Then you see all the followers looking at the Maverick and Trump and they said the man
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:44.560]  they said that they couldn't couldn't beat the establishment.
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:45.720]  He couldn't beat the globalists.
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:49.600]  They were all against them and now they they worship the ground that he walks on, whether
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:51.320]  they want to admit it or not.
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:53.040]  That happened yesterday.
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:54.840]  Suddenly the heads of Davos said, we love Trump.
[02:01:54.840 --> 02:01:55.840]  I had the headline here.
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:57.240]  It was like, we love them.
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:01:58.240]  It's been a great year.
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:01:59.800]  They actually, the world economy is better.
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:03.120]  Thank God for Trump and it's like suddenly they've all been attacking him.
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:04.640]  And then now they all start saying, we love Trump.
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:05.640]  We love Trump.
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:09.880]  I mean, this just shows how Rockefellers and people were able to bully all these guys into
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:10.880]  line.
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:11.880]  Trump's not even bullying it.
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:14.360]  He's just leading.
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:15.360]  No question.
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:18.320]  You had a, you probably covered it earlier in the show, but the Heritage Foundation is
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:22.680]  saying that Trump's first year was better than Reagan's and, you know, we'll take that
[02:02:22.680 --> 02:02:23.920]  all with a grain of salt.
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:28.000]  But for, you know, the Heritage Foundation would definitely be, you know, Reagan is the
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:33.000]  greatest man ever and for them to put Trump on a pedestal above him, it speaks volumes
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.000]  even some of these never, never Trumpers are coming around and, you know, he's changing
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:38.480]  the world at this, at this moment.
[02:02:38.480 --> 02:02:39.480]  No, you're right.
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:42.880]  The Heritage Foundation did not support Trump that, you know, they pitched this quote free
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:43.880]  trade.
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:49.440]  That means let China have huge tariffs on you with lower taxes and screw us and not have
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:50.440]  a two way street.
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:51.440]  And you're right.
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:52.440]  They're all starting to get in line.
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:57.800]  You know what I did find interesting and I wanted to ask you about it actually, John
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:03.200]  Claude Junker, the head of the, of the EU basically, he canceled at the last second and he cites
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:05.160]  a stomach flu as the reason for that.
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:10.000]  Now, if you recall not too long ago, a few months ago, Junker was all out of warfare
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:14.680]  against Trump and he said he would, he would back Texas it against the, if there was a
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:16.880]  Texas exit, he was going to get behind that.
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:19.640]  But of course he couldn't possibly back Brexit.
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:23.200]  So I was going to ask you, do you think he bowed out because of out of cowardice or do
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:24.640]  you think he really is sick?
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:30.000]  Oh, no, Junker is, is, is literally the greatest heir of the Nazis.
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.160]  His family was the first or second most rich, depending on the history books.
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:37.520]  The main armories were Junker bombers, Junker munitions.
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:39.360]  That was his grandfather.
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:44.600]  His father was a top Nazi and Junker's family, paratrooped into Luxembourg, the richest country
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:46.640]  in the world per capita, stole the country.
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:50.440]  He said 13 months ago, we will crush Trump.
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:51.960]  We control America.
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:58.000]  We're going to show America economic war and you can pull that up.
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:02.760]  In fact, the videos I shot about it were, you know, heir of the Nazi fortune pledges
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:05.000]  to stop Trump and stop America.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000]  And so he's an absolute joke.
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:14.200]  Why should that piece of Nazi scum, anti-American globalist that opened Europe up to the Islamists?
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:16.480]  I mean, he is the head of the unlucky to you.
[02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:17.720]  He is the enemy.
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:23.960]  So why would Hitler show up to face Churchill, basically?
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:29.320]  Essentially, I do wonder if this was a moment of cowardice on his part or another moment
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:34.360]  of Trump incurs divine providence where Junker goes down with the flu right when Trump comes
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:35.360]  into town.
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:36.360]  Wow.
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:38.360]  This will be a day long remembered.
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:40.480]  I love it.
[02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:41.480]  God.
[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:43.200]  He watched Junker in the speeches he gives.
[02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:51.040]  He is such an inbred mental deficient.
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:52.040]  Your whole thing's going to hell.
[02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:53.040]  We'll be back.
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:54.040]  We've got huge news, by the way.
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:55.040]  The biggest news.
[02:04:55.040 --> 02:04:56.040]  I just got it.
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:57.040]  They just found the text messages.
[02:04:57.040 --> 02:05:01.400]  Feel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by Info Wars Life.
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:05.880]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients
[02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:08.680]  by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:13.000]  They also help prevent discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food
[02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:14.800]  particles in the gut.
[02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:17.240]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:05:17.240 --> 02:05:21.360]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:24.360]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:28.920]  You can eat protein heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:31.720]  commonly associated with high meat diets.
[02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:35.920]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption
[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:39.880]  of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:05:39.880 --> 02:05:44.360]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you
[02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:46.960]  can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:48.320]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:51.000]  Use carnivore by Info Wars Life.

[02:05:54.520 --> 02:06:09.520]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:36.120]  This is an amazing war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:41.200]  This is a tactic that's absolutely key that people absolutely must be aware of.
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:46.040]  Just like Trump said, if you've been here 20, 30 years, you've got a degree, you're
[02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:49.440]  working hard, you don't have a big criminal record, whatever, you have a misc vina or
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:52.040]  something, then we're going to let you stay in the country.
[02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:55.160]  That would be a fair dream act and I agree with that myself.
[02:06:55.160 --> 02:06:58.680]  But then the media said he wants to kill all the Mexicans, hates them, blah, blah, blah,
[02:06:58.680 --> 02:07:02.360]  wants to ban everybody, period.
[02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:06.560]  And then when Trump doesn't do that, the right wing goes, oh my God, he was supposed to throw
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:08.440]  everybody out who wasn't born here.
[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:10.320]  Well, it's the same thing with Davos.
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:13.480]  I saw headlines everywhere in the London Guardian and the New York Times.
[02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:15.400]  Trump sells out his base last week.
[02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:16.880]  He's going to Davos.
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:19.400]  He's going to kiss the hand of the elite.
[02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:21.440]  He walks in, they fall on their faces.
[02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:26.400]  The head of the thing, the dictator of the EU, unelected, yunker, doesn't show up.
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:31.000]  The heir to the main Nazi fortune, his family was the first or second richest family in
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:32.000]  Germany.
[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:35.440]  Again, the history books vary, but they're the top Nazis, okay?
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:40.520]  I mean, they still control European countries that they just own through fraud.
[02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:46.360]  So he doesn't show up and Donald Trump is guaranteed to betray his base.
[02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:47.360]  Yeah.
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:48.840]  I mean, this has been going on for a long time.
[02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:53.840]  And then he doesn't betray and he kills TPP and delivers on the economy and they still
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:58.080]  keep flipping out saying that he's going to sell us out.
[02:07:58.080 --> 02:08:00.640]  I'm glad he went for a victory lap.
[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:05.560]  I'm glad he went to talk to the companies that want to move to the United States.
[02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:06.560]  There it is.
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:07.720]  Trump's ready to pull another fast one.
[02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:12.040]  The President's trip to Davos has three serious issues and it goes on from there.
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:16.680]  Oh yeah, he sure pulled a fast one with our economy coming roaring back and with veterans
[02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:20.600]  getting double the amount of visits that they had just a year ago and the border is 70%
[02:08:20.600 --> 02:08:22.680]  secure and the border wall starting to go in.
[02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:25.240]  Yeah, sure pulled a fast one and now this big breaking news.
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:30.480]  We're going to your calls with Dan Lyman, who's in Davos.
[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:31.480]  This is the Hill.
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:32.480]  It's breaking.
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:34.440]  I just tweeted it out at Real Alex Jones.
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:42.520]  DOJ office says it has found the missing text messages of FBI officials.
[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:46.400]  Months of missing text messages between two FBI officials have been located.
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:52.000]  According to a letter obtained by the Hill Justice Department Inspector General Michael
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:58.040]  Horowitz told Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and John Ron Johnson of Wisconsin in a letter
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:04.280]  of the messages spanning from December of 16 to 17, see nobody bought this, previously
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:09.320]  thought missing that he's hit one button that was in the NSA due to technology glitch affecting
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:11.760]  FBI phones have been found.
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:12.760]  Really?
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:14.760]  You think so?
[02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:16.880]  By the way, Congress has all of it.
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:17.880]  Trump has all of it.
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:22.360]  The Office of the Inspector General has been investigating this matter and this week succeeded
[02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:26.280]  in using forensic tools to recover text messages from FBI devices.
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:31.040]  Oh, of course, yes, yes, it's always hard-coded.
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:37.400]  From the Telecommunications Act of 96, all phones, all printers, all these communication
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:43.640]  devices shave the material, and it's why they've got internal hard drives that things
[02:09:43.640 --> 02:09:47.680]  just stop working in a few years because it fills up.
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:51.640]  And that's the stuff I told you about a long, long time ago.
[02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:53.080]  There it is.
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:58.080]  Using text messages, anti-Trump FBI agents uncovered by DOJ.
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:01.040]  They found them, infowars.com, now live.
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:06.800]  We are in a minute-by-minute, play-by-play, Second American Revolution war with the Deep
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:07.800]  State.
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:11.520]  Lou Dobbs comes out and says, it's time to declare war on the Deep State.
[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:12.800]  The walls are closing in.
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:16.520]  Sean Hannity, this isn't rhetoric you've been hearing from me.
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:18.200]  We're in extraordinary times.
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:22.040]  This is happening, literally, and I agree with an earlier caller.
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:25.960]  I want to ask Dan Lyman, and then we're going to let him go and ask the callers this.
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:30.120]  Then we've got Tyler Nixon coming in, who's a very interesting lawyer and political analyst,
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:31.120]  really smart guy.
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:33.960]  Just so out of you related to Richard Nixon, but we won't get into that part, good friends
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:37.840]  with Roger Stone.
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:41.280]  This is all happening, but I'm telling you, I think they'll release a bio-weapon like
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:42.600]  the earlier caller said.
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:45.880]  They did that after 9-11 when the Globals were involved with the Jihadis and wanted
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:47.680]  to cover it up when stuff started coming out.
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:51.080]  They did the anthrax to intimidate Congress into a bunch of stuff.
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:56.400]  I'm really concerned, as I keep saying, that we not be too celebratory here because they're
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:57.400]  going to strike back.
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:59.640]  What do you think, Dan Lyman?
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:02.800]  I think that there's no question anything is on the table at this point.
[02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:06.080]  I'm honestly surprised things haven't gotten worse in the last year.
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:09.920]  I thought that there would be more drastic measures taken, although I think that we did
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:15.360]  see something strange go down in Las Vegas as we've covered in depth.
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:16.360]  I don't know.
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:17.360]  It's very interesting.
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:22.000]  I'm so optimistic now at this point, now that we're a year in, but I know not to get
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:25.800]  my hopes up too high because anything can happen at any given moment, especially with
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:29.480]  the economy doing so well and the stock market doing so well.
[02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:33.920]  You hear all financial advisors and traders, they say they've never seen a market like
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:34.920]  this.
[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:36.600]  It's going on longer than they ever thought it would.
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:42.360]  I wonder, is the Trump effect going to break this cycle that the globalists have this
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:46.560]  chokehold they've had on the markets where there's a catastrophic event every eight years
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:50.280]  or whatever, and then it sends the market into a spiral, hasn't happened this time around.
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:54.800]  So I'm wondering what the dams are holding back right now, and it's probably pretty
[02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:55.800]  ugly.
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:11:56.800]  Well, I know this.
[02:11:56.800 --> 02:11:58.280]  They haven't given up on me.
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:02.440]  They are still throwing stuff at us that is directly from Hillary, directly from Soros.
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:04.840]  I'll soon be able to reveal the details of it.
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:08.600]  I mean, I've even got to go to DC in a couple of weeks.
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:13.200]  I'm not supposed to get into this yet, so just believe me, when I do, we have caught
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:14.680]  them red-handed, okay?
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:21.640]  And you can argue I got a tiger by the tail or vice versa, but these are just crazy times.
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:23.480]  Because I mean, I wasn't going to put up with their crap.
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:29.480]  I put counter-surveillance on their people, spent a lot of money, and did a lot of stuff
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:30.480]  and had a lot of help.
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:36.600]  We'll just leave it at that, and let me tell you, these people are sick, and they're going
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:37.600]  after everybody.
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:41.160]  They're going after thousands of prominent people, and you see these congressmen up there?
[02:12:41.160 --> 02:12:44.080]  They already tried to kill them.
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:45.360]  So you think about that, folks.
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:48.240]  They're trying to kill everybody right now.
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:52.000]  So I mean, we kind of smile about this in Texas, and yeah, we're in a fight, yeah, it's
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:55.600]  all crazy, but we're not like SJWs that are considering crying about it.
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:56.600]  It's actually quite exciting.
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:12:58.280]  I'm having a great time.
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:01.400]  It's just, we're not in Kansas anymore, folks.
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:02.960]  This is the real deal.
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:04.480]  Let's go to Kansas in Tennessee.
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:05.480]  Thanks for holding Kansas.
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:06.480]  You're awesome.
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:08.320]  You're on the air worldwide with a Dan Lyman from Switzerland.
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:09.320]  Go ahead.
[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:10.320]  Hey, Alex and Dan.
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:11.320]  How are you doing?
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:12.320]  Good.
[02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:17.600]  First, real quick, I would just like to ask a quick question before I get to my comment.
[02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:20.920]  I know you were very busy, but have you and your crew had a chance to pick the winners
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:22.480]  of the People's Choice Awards?
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:26.760]  You know, I'm like a guy in a bunker giving orders on that, and I have said, these are
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:27.760]  the winners.
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:31.680]  They have been picked, and you know what, I'm going to announce them at the end of the
[02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:32.840]  show next hour.
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:34.680]  One way or the other is going to happen.
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:35.680]  Okay, great.
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:41.240]  I mean, also, I agree with the other caller that these people are just so cornered that
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:44.640]  you know, I think that there's going to be a false flag attack for sure.
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:50.040]  Well, that's what everybody's group collective mind is saying, and I think you're on target.
[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:51.040]  Keep going, Candice.
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:56.680]  Yeah, I mean, I just, you know, their darkest secrets are getting exposed, so, you know,
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:00.680]  they're just like a dog in a corner, and I just think they're going to pull something
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:01.680]  major.
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:06.720]  And they're such arrogant whenever you watch Comey or Mueller walk into Congress bugging
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:11.440]  their eyes out like they're God, all these guys behind them, all these lawyers is going
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:16.080]  like they're just the best people in the world when they're the those guys are the Clinton
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:17.720]  scum or the trash of the earth.
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:22.160]  They're like cancer inside the FBI, and they are so arrogant.
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:25.400]  Imagine all that hubris is getting wiped away, Candice, right now.
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:27.120]  Yeah, that's great.
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:31.840]  They're just stinging, so it's good to see them be put in their place.
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:32.840]  Absolutely.
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:36.240]  But don't think they're the types that will blow themselves up to stop the recovery.
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:37.240]  What do you think, Dan?
[02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:38.720]  What's your gut tell you?
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:39.720]  No question.
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:43.600]  And I think that it's not even just the U.S. crisis at this point for them.
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:45.080]  It's on the international scale.
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:49.640]  So we should be prepared for anything anywhere, to be honest, not just in the United States.
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:53.880]  That is the smartest thing I've heard all day, and I've heard a lot of really intelligent
[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:54.880]  statements.
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:55.880]  You're right.
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:15:01.120]  North Korea, we know the global's behind the scenes are winding up rocket man.
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:02.120]  No question.
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:03.560]  We definitely have to keep an eye on everything.
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:08.600]  I mean, there's actually Turkey just invaded Syria last week.
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.400]  That could kick back up again.
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:16.400]  I have a Syrian bartender, actually, I'm sorry, a barber, not a bartender, a barber.
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:21.720]  He's a Syrian Kurd, and he was asking me what I thought about the invasion of Syria by Erdogan,
[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:24.640]  and he even said Erdogan equals ISIS to him.
[02:15:24.640 --> 02:15:27.280]  And so, I mean, we have to even keep an eye on that situation.
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:31.240]  You have Trump's basically eradicated ISIS in the span of a year, just like you promised,
[02:15:31.240 --> 02:15:36.080]  and all of a sudden, there's a new conflict in Syria, so let's keep an eye on that for
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:37.080]  sure.
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:38.080]  That's right.
[02:15:38.080 --> 02:15:41.400]  And they are attacking U.S.-backed Kurds, and the whole war started there, and that's
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:42.400]  in my stack.
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:43.400]  I need to get to that.
[02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:44.400]  Absolutely.
[02:15:44.400 --> 02:15:48.040]  All right, look, you get back on the street, Dan Lyman from FullWars.com.
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:50.680]  Great job with all the work you're doing, we'll be following everything you do.

[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:18.080]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:24.120]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:25.720]  and excessive mucus production.
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:30.560]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials.

[02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:33.960]  He never gives up, he's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[02:20:33.960 --> 02:20:44.200]  Roger Stone has got big inside intel on the vaunted secret FISA memo coming up in the
[02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:45.200]  next segment.
[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:46.200]  We'll continue with your calls as well.
[02:20:46.200 --> 02:20:50.640]  We've got a very clear picture of what's in it, and now if you look at Congressman Gates
[02:20:50.640 --> 02:20:56.760]  and Congressman Jordan and Congressman Nunes and Congressman, or Chairman Nunes and Congressman
[02:20:56.760 --> 02:21:02.000]  Gowdy and everybody else, and how panicked Adam Schiff is, the head of the judiciary
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:05.440]  committee on the Democrat side in the House, you know what's in it.
[02:21:05.440 --> 02:21:10.200]  And we've already know the pieces of the puzzle, so we're going to put them together coming
[02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:11.200]  up.
[02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:14.960]  And as I heard last night, Monday's the target date, well now that's being reported that
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:17.560]  they're looking to have a vote on Monday, but they're not sure yet.
[02:21:17.560 --> 02:21:18.560]  So that's coming up.
[02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:19.560]  I want to go back to your calls.
[02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:23.040]  But Kit Daniels, I haven't seen him smile on this big, well he smiles all the time,
[02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:24.040]  but he's an happy guy.
[02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:28.480]  But one of our great writers, Kit Daniels, came in here with this article, he said this
[02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:34.120]  is like, Trump and Davos is like George Washington getting on a ship in the middle of the Revolutionary
[02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:38.760]  War and going into King George III's court and just basically getting right in his face.
[02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:40.480]  And that's what's happened.
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:45.240]  And Trump is delivering on everything he said he would do yet again, and it's not a love
[02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:46.240]  fest.
[02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:49.960]  They're trying to destroy him with secret cabals because he's returning sovereignty
[02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:50.960]  to the country.
[02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:55.880]  I don't like how he's been bullied into escalating conflict with Russia.
[02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:58.800]  I don't like that he's not going after the vaccines and all that kind of stuff.
[02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:01.920]  I've got some big issues, but let me tell you, he's really our president.
[02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:03.560]  This is wild.
[02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:08.440]  Vox reporting, why Trump is going to Vavos, the world's biggest party for globalist elites
[02:22:08.440 --> 02:22:09.440]  explained.
[02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:16.680]  He was attending to both boast and confident and confront the crowd that disdains him.
[02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:17.680]  Absolutely.
[02:22:17.680 --> 02:22:21.360]  Trump is tending to both boast and confront the crowd that disdains him.
[02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:25.920]  That is a report came out a few days ago and that is exactly what I'm saying and that is
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:28.160]  exactly what we are now seeing.
[02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:33.400]  So there you go, didn't go to Davos, didn't sell us out.
[02:22:33.400 --> 02:22:34.400]  Very, very exciting.
[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:37.080]  Here's from the article that Kit Daniels wrote.
[02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:42.520]  But now, thanks to Trump, Brexit and the ongoing migrant crisis, average Europeans are starting
[02:22:42.520 --> 02:22:47.600]  to question why they're losing their cultures and identities to the EU.
[02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:54.960]  And they look to Trump as the Howard Rourke style American cowboy who's undeterred rebellion
[02:22:54.960 --> 02:23:00.560]  against a legion of doom inspires their own individual thoughts and opinions.
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:02.200]  So there you go.
[02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:04.320]  Right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:07.480]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:10.040]  Mark in Iowa, thanks for holding it on the air worldwide.
[02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:11.040]  Go ahead.
[02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:12.040]  Hi, Alex.
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:13.560]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:23:13.560 --> 02:23:17.200]  I want to thank God bless you, your crew and your family.
[02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:18.200]  Thank you, sir.
[02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:19.200]  You too.
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:20.200]  Turn the radio on and get the truth.
[02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:21.200]  Thank you.
[02:23:21.200 --> 02:23:22.200]  Yes, sir.
[02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:23.200]  Welcome.
[02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:31.640]  I was wondering, well, thanks, I was wondering in a nutshell, if in 1776 our forefathers were
[02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:38.440]  in a room put a pen to paper and coming up with the Declaration of Independence, in short,
[02:23:38.440 --> 02:23:42.480]  it was because the government came and asked to govern.
[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:47.600]  Our forefathers wrote this down, said, if you'll govern this way, you can govern in
[02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:49.560]  a nutshell, I guess.
[02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:56.200]  So if now today we're finding out that every single three-letter agency of the federal
[02:23:56.200 --> 02:24:06.560]  government, the DOJ, CDC, you name it, FDI, CIA, all of these entities, all of them, have
[02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:12.640]  screwed over the American people, couldn't we, cancel our contract and fire them all?
[02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:14.840]  And what is the government so worried about?
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:15.840]  Why do they think we're newborns?
[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:18.800]  Well, sure, we've got a major broken social contract.
[02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:20.960]  I'm trying to fix the country and restore the republic.
[02:24:20.960 --> 02:24:24.600]  We're still going to have major problems and ongoing fights.
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:29.000]  It's just the current, embedded, arrogant group of criminals that have gotten away with
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:32.600]  anything you can imagine are now finding out they're not invincible.
[02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:38.080]  But if we successfully remove these crooks, I intend to see more integrity come back in.
[02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:43.440]  And if we don't see that, then we need to continue to hold their feet to the fire regardless.
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:44.440]  Regardless.
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:46.560]  That's what eternal vigilance is all about.
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:48.440]  And I want to see the government shrunk in size.
[02:24:48.440 --> 02:24:49.960]  I don't want to just see tax cuts.
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:52.000]  I want to see deficits paid down.
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:53.320]  I want to see a lot of things.
[02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:55.920]  And Trump's just stabilizing things right now.
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:59.160]  He's got to use a bubble so we don't stall out.
[02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:00.640]  China's got bubbles much bigger than ours.
[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:05.960]  But I certainly hope that down the road, we then put pressure to stabilize the country.
[02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:06.960]  Great.
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:07.960]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:08.960]  I agree.
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:11.880]  One more quick question, if you would, Alex.
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:14.280]  I'm originally, I grew up in Illinois.
[02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:19.240]  And in Illinois, if I had a birthday yesterday, I got caught driving today, I would go to
[02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:20.240]  jail.
[02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:27.960]  But I don't know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are committing treason by sedition.
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:29.520]  Why are they not picked up?
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:36.160]  Because in Illinois, if I got caught driving on a one day license that has expired by just
[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:41.840]  one day, they hauled my car, tow it, that's $400-some-odd dollars, and I'd go to jail
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:42.840]  for three years.
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:43.840]  Now, I totally understand.
[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:48.600]  This is the issue people have with illegal aliens.
[02:25:48.600 --> 02:25:51.840]  Illegal aliens, when they have wrecks and hit people, the judges just let them go.
[02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:54.640]  That's it, met it on the news.
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:58.680]  Citizens get the book thrown at them because citizens are seen as cash cows.
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:26:02.560]  I don't care if you're white, black, Hispanic, Asian, old, young.
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:05.040]  You get the book thrown at you.
[02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:09.200]  Illegals don't, because the judges all over the country, including Republican districts,
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:10.680]  just tell people, oh, leave them alone.
[02:26:10.680 --> 02:26:11.920]  They're kind of the underclass.
[02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:17.400]  They're the permanent worker class going back to when they were brought in to pick the fields
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:20.840]  or whatever, and being used to drive down everybody else's wages.
[02:26:20.840 --> 02:26:24.400]  I want to bring folks in and then raise the wages up, not use that model.
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:29.920]  So ever since they've been brought in to some areas as migrant workers, before they were
[02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:33.680]  made a permanent underclass of the Democrats, back when they were just seasonal farmers
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:39.200]  that came through and they went back to Mexico, they had to be ignored and above the law then.
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:40.200]  Because we weren't using them.
[02:26:40.200 --> 02:26:45.440]  Well, they're still being used, but it's being used to undermine everything and is discriminatory
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:47.480]  to citizens that have the book thrown at them.
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:50.680]  I mean, I was talking to judges and people and others.
[02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:53.240]  They let illegal aliens off for drunk driving, you name it.
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:55.440]  Because again, our days have faded.
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:26:58.400]  The former Austin police chief, now the Houston police chief, he's been in this studio and
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:04.120]  said, Alex, if we arrest illegal aliens for stuff or whatever, then they won't trust us
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:06.920]  when there's a crime and we're needed.
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:14.480]  Okay, so basically for non-really serious aggravated felonies then, you're saying illegal aliens
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:16.240]  are above the law.
[02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:20.920]  And then it creates a vacuum where there's no law enforcement and no law and then criminals
[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:28.800]  come in and prey on those communities and they know they can prey on the Asian and Hispanic
[02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:34.080]  communities that are homogeneous and contained.
[02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:37.440]  And then that's where the majority of the crime is committed against those people and
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:38.960]  then nothing's done.
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:43.760]  And it creates criminal zones within the cities, within the counties and a permanent underclass.
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:48.240]  So I absolutely agree with you, sir, your inspection stickers out, you get pulled over,
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:54.640]  you get a ticket, maybe you get your car code and if you're a single mom with three kids
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:59.080]  in the back of the car, the cops will be told, go ahead and write her tickets.
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:02.000]  But if you're a person here illegally, that doesn't happen.
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:07.480]  But if I'm in Mexico and I'm the foreigner, it's well known that a lot of the police are
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:11.760]  corrupt and I've watched my dad, those people many times, give him a $20 bill, $100 bill
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:15.160]  or whatever saying you were speeding, even though my dad wasn't speeding, he drives
[02:28:15.160 --> 02:28:16.160]  like an old lady.
[02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:17.160]  It's incredible.
[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:20.600]  I've saw it five, six times when I was a kid and I said, dad, I don't want to come down
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:21.600]  here anymore.
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:24.920]  So by the time I was about 12, he said, fine, stay with your grandparents when you go out
[02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:28.320]  of town because they love southern Mexico and I like it too.
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:29.760]  It's very pretty and a lot of cool stuff.

[02:31:24.680 --> 02:31:30.480]  of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.

[02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:37.440]  Alright, I want to try to be calm here because this is so important and I tend to get too
[02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:39.360]  excited as everybody knows.
[02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:46.520]  Walk through what we know is already known about illegal spying on candidate Trump, President
[02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:52.080]  Elect Trump, and then right at the time that he was actually inaugurated, plus surveillance
[02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:57.640]  and harassment, lawsuits against myself, Roger Stone, you name it, by the Hillary law firm,
[02:33:57.640 --> 02:34:03.480]  by the Soros groups, by Obama's law group that he set up to quote, battle Trump once
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:04.480]  he was in office.
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:09.200]  That's CNN, that's Politico, I mean this is all admitted.
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:14.800]  But it's all coming to a head now as we learn the real collusion, the real secret societies,
[02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:19.720]  the real stuff that was going on were a bunch of FBI agents and Justice Department people
[02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:25.560]  inside of the Obama administration who've been appointed by the Clintons engaging in
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:26.560]  this massive crime.
[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:33.040]  And now Chairman Devin Nunez and others are each week rolling out what's going to be released
[02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:34.520]  the next week.
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:41.320]  The collusion, the secret meetings, the insurance policies, the deputy director getting money
[02:34:41.320 --> 02:34:42.920]  from Hillary directly.
[02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:48.520]  It goes on and on and on and shifts gone from this isn't real to desperately saying don't
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:52.840]  release it to we're putting our own memo out and I know Roger has given me a lot of intel
[02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:57.280]  from folks that have seen the memo and it's basically what they've already said but more
[02:34:57.280 --> 02:35:02.680]  damning text messages and more collusion and more secret meetings and of course this stuff
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:09.520]  is all recoverable by the NSA but it's very embarrassing with all this illegal spying
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:13.640]  to admit where they're really getting it but we knew this was coming when senators and
[02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:18.480]  others started saying yesterday, oh don't worry we'll just get that out of the NSA database
[02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:23.600]  missing text between anti-Trump FBI agents uncovered by the DOJ.
[02:35:23.600 --> 02:35:28.520]  People didn't buy that, there was a glitch on the phones that made them all disappear
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:29.520]  50,000.
[02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:34.520]  DOJ office says it has found missing text messages of FBI officials they were able to
[02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:43.120]  pull it off of the phones between Strach and his girlfriend Paige and so the rabbit hole
[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:45.840]  just gets deeper and crazier.
[02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:50.600]  So Roger let's encapsulate what we're seeing the cornered rat scenario the walls closing
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:35:55.360]  in the deep states war against America and the electric now exposed I think we've reached
[02:35:55.360 --> 02:36:02.440]  the point of maximum danger with these people cornered as Trump dominates at Debo's how
[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:05.920]  are they going to strike back what's the intel you've got of what's in the memo how much
[02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:11.080]  can you tell folks and how accurately from your research have I gotten stuff here.
[02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:17.160]  Well Alex so let's try to summarize this because it's all coming at us so quickly it can be
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:26.360]  somewhat confusing the hundred page FISA document that we put up at info wars essentially
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:33.280]  was summarized in the four page memo the basic underlying information is essentially
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:42.160]  the same and here's how it goes in essence the the dirty dossier the dossier which falsely
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:50.720]  accused Donald Trump of dallying with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room a complete and total
[02:36:50.720 --> 02:37:00.480]  fabrication was used as the fake rationale to go to the FISA court and get permission
[02:37:00.480 --> 02:37:08.440]  for the wholesale surveillance of Donald Trump and some of his closest associates including
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:15.680]  yours truly the problem for the deep state is that when the FISA court initially denied
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:24.560]  their requests they went ahead with the surveillance anyway so this entire investigation Mueller
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:31.360]  the House and Senate Intelligence Committee investigations the FBI investigation into
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:39.640]  so-called Russian collusion is all based on a willful fabrication and the reason you
[02:37:39.640 --> 02:37:47.520]  see the rats scrambling today is because it is not credible that the entire frontline
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:55.960]  of the Obama NSA the Obama Justice Department the Obama FBI did this without authority from
[02:37:55.960 --> 02:38:04.080]  the highest possible level you notice that President Barack Obama lawyer up today why
[02:38:04.080 --> 02:38:10.960]  because we are beginning to ask the obvious question what did the president know and
[02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:20.800]  when did he know it the deep state was in such a tizzy to stop Donald Trump that they fabricated
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:28.840]  the initial piece of evidence on which everything afterwards is based oh we have to spy on him
[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:35.360]  because he's in bed with the Russians that was a falsehood from the get-go and it is
[02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:43.600]  on that thin read that all collapses the credit Alex in my opinion really goes to Matt Gates
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:51.240]  congressman Ron DeSantis congressman Jim Jordan congressman Trey Gowdy while the country
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:58.400]  club Republicans were all out at a cocktail party these four brave individuals stayed
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:05.280]  the course and kept pounding for the truth and I've mentioned this quite a bit but but
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:09.800]  you're absolutely right this morning I was just sitting back thinking about the American
[02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:16.160]  people waking up about the real press we've got in this country our great crew all of
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:20.400]  us together but I really sat back and I thought why is it different now it's not just that
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:25.080]  Trump showed up on the scene or that nationalism is popping everywhere it's like the spirit
[02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:29.440]  it's the times we're in historians always marked that you know there were times of tyranny
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:34.240]  times of enlightenment times of awakening times of war times of peace I guess his proverb
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:39.200]  says a time to live a time to die a time to sow a time to reap and right now we suddenly
[02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:46.600]  have this wonderful crop of congressmen and women but but mainly men that are doing bold
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:51.120]  things that a lot of congressmen have had their planes blow up you know you got killed
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:55.120]  during the 70s and 80s we had some good people back then too a lot of them ended up you know
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:40:01.760]  dying being assassinated and so this is a big big deal and of course you know we have
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:07.680]  QAnon saying that he's hired counsel but but the word is they're all luring up and that's
[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:12.200]  in the mainstream news so we don't I don't go off what QAnon says you know a lot of what
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:16.240]  QAnon says is he's really accurate stuff it is obviously some intelligent sources in the
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:22.320]  government that are patriots but we can see them all luring up in in the real world Roger
[02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:28.560]  can you speak to that a little bit more well also there are some ominous clouds on the
[02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:36.560]  horizon as you know when Paul Manafort was indicted indicted with him was his longtime
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:43.520]  associate Rick Gates Manafort and Gates are a pawn in Mueller's game they could get off
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:48.320]  the hook easily if they would simply agree to bear false witness against the president
[02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:55.040]  which they both resolutely refused to do but is it coincidental that Rick Gates spokesperson
[02:40:55.040 --> 02:41:03.440]  was killed in his hotel room only two days ago as reported by CNN is this a warning shot
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:12.080]  for those who would question the deep state that report I can tell you sent chills up my spine
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:20.640]  upset my wife very substantially now we learn that some of the text messages that were missing
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:29.600]  related to discussion of bumping off the president yes I just said it the a word assassination
[02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:36.320]  I have said two things from the beginning here at info wars first of all that the FISA court
[02:41:36.880 --> 02:41:44.160]  disclosures last November that 30,000 people had been illegally and unconstitutionally surveilled
[02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:52.080]  was the key to this entire scandal and then secondly that the deep state had a four stage
[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:59.840]  program stage one the electoral college and a recount stop trump there it failed we now know
[02:41:59.840 --> 02:42:06.640]  that general James Clapper a criminal a traitor a man now treating teaching ethics at Roanoke
[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:11.520]  college who should be in prison based on the fact that he perjured himself in front of the
[02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:18.880]  congress about the existence of the metadata program actually was plotting to use a supreme
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:26.240]  court justice to somehow delay Donald Trump's inauguration and his actual swearing in on
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:31.760]  the bible that's how desperate these criminals were alex stay wait a minute wait a minute
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:37.520]  stay right there I didn't know that that must be something new or something I missed wow
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:40.640]  tell us about that when we come back because we know they were talking about delaying the
[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:45.600]  inauguration and and Clapper was involved uh it's the same guy that that caught line of
[02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:50.720]  congress that's just insane this this started to make my head spin and then I've got a whole

[02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:28.000]  hour i'll host some of that with him and then Owen shroyer and roger stone coming back in for
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:33.440]  the war room three to six p.m you got david night of course so with the david night transmission
[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:39.440]  that is eight a.m central every weekday morning and i do the sunday broadcast four to six p.m as well
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:46.480]  well i wanted to hit this but then now more news just broke first off three or four days ago they
[02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:51.360]  started sending out tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of emails a couple of our crew got it
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:57.440]  poll Watson got it saying russian bots run you during the election and a lot of people said
[02:47:57.440 --> 02:48:01.120]  wait i didn't have my account till after and then they went and looked at their tweets it was them
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:10.960]  so then we have all these peoples like like adam schiff and others of the house history committee
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:20.880]  the head democrat telling twitter yes ban all these people they are basically russian agents
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:26.960]  everybody backlashed and twitter actually sent out a public statement saying no we've looked
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:35.920]  they're americans adam schiff knows that the boldness now of moving from roger stone alex
[02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:40.800]  jones and matt drudge and tucker carlson and ran pauler agents of putin those are quotes remember
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:47.040]  mccain on that senate floor you're an agent of putin ran paul and i guess the next step is we'll
[02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:52.080]  get you at the baseball game next time i mean this is what they told themselves these are crazy people
[02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:56.560]  and now they're saying hundreds of thousands of people of americans are see we're all evil
[02:48:56.560 --> 02:49:05.680]  meanwhile this just broke at the hill newspaper g.o.p panics as signs point to eminent mewler block
[02:49:05.680 --> 02:49:11.440]  buster the scores are the tax against the fbi by a growing number of house and senate republicans
[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:22.240]  demonstrate a high degree of fear the special counsel robert mewler swan mewler sass us should
[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:25.680]  up and then i guess there's a blurb there should applaud the choice of mewler to lead the russian
[02:49:25.680 --> 02:49:31.920]  probe more will make block buster moves that's their weird typo jumbled insanity doesn't make sense
[02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:39.920]  moves to the coming days and weeks that will define the fate of ongoing investigations
[02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:44.960]  of the russian attack against america so they just state this hoax again
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:50.320]  and then it says oh the republicans are doing this because they're desperate
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:55.760]  no they're not desperate that we've caught them red-handed we have struck in in text messages
[02:49:55.760 --> 02:50:00.720]  saying there's no evidence of any russian collusion what are we going to do roger this is just
[02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:07.520]  insane when you look at all this i mean they're not giving up no alex i think that they're that
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:13.760]  they're capable of great great violence we saw that in the uh in the attack on congressman's
[02:50:13.760 --> 02:50:21.040]  khalise i myself in the wake of the murder of rick gates spokesman have taken on personal
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:27.040]  security i know some on some occasions you have to use it i really did it for my wife's piece of
[02:50:27.040 --> 02:50:32.400]  mind they aren't going to silence us we're not going to stop we're going to keep pushing for the
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:38.320]  truth now suddenly adam schiff and diane feinstein those great liberals who normally like full
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:44.000]  disclosure and transparency oh no the american people can't see this information it's it's too
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:49.760]  complicated for them they won't understand it that's because it is a blueprint of treachery
[02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:56.480]  that's because it is a roadmap of treason that's why they have violated as i said yesterday
[02:50:57.280 --> 02:51:04.880]  on the one room show multiple federal laws including laws against sedition treason conspiracy
[02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:11.120]  plotting to take down the government now muller and his cohorts are the ones who must face prison
[02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:15.440]  in my opinion uh just first off for people watching on skype this is some really good
[02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:22.560]  product placement uh tell me about uh the new athletics program you're involved in well i have
[02:51:22.560 --> 02:51:30.560]  a yesterday i had a mean a lie who's a personal trainer who i've been associated with for 20 years
[02:51:30.560 --> 02:51:37.440]  come on the war room show and talk about both caveman which he uh highly advocates in a program
[02:51:37.440 --> 02:51:43.200]  with the high quality weight protein that we sell at info wars and and he has had enormous
[02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:50.080]  success with this program i'm really trying to stick to it one body part of day cardio every
[02:51:50.080 --> 02:51:56.800]  other day sticking to the info wars format and he came on give a little testimonial to our
[02:51:56.800 --> 02:52:03.280]  products which he's a big big fan of and in the meantime he is providing some personal security
[02:52:03.280 --> 02:52:10.320]  for me and my family i like that it's almost like like we're sedan who's saying we using two guys
[02:52:10.320 --> 02:52:16.240]  behind you but well but with volatiles and machine guns i wish this was something to
[02:52:16.240 --> 02:52:22.480]  laugh about alex but the number of death threats every time i do the alex jones show every time
[02:52:22.480 --> 02:52:28.880]  i'm on fox news they just spike i was on with laura ingram last night on fox talking about
[02:52:28.880 --> 02:52:34.720]  why it's a mistake for the president to give this interview to miller it's a perjury trap it's a set
[02:52:34.720 --> 02:52:41.680]  up the death threats against me immediately spike it's really for my wife and my family's piece of
[02:52:41.680 --> 02:52:49.440]  mind well that's awesome um roger you are something else uh getting back to all this other news here
[02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:56.000]  do do do you think they have anything else up their sleeve any other fake bomb shells because
[02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:00.880]  i mean they are getting torn to hell right now and this is their spin that the gop is panicking
[02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:08.800]  alex here's the game plan for miller i've laid it out before but now i think both pieces of it
[02:53:08.800 --> 02:53:16.320]  are obvious miller's going to indict the president's son-in-law on some phony trumped up charge of lying
[02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:23.200]  to an fbi agent they're going to claim that he was the one who instructed general flinn a great
[02:53:23.200 --> 02:53:30.960]  patriot a man who was unjustly and unfairly discharged in my opinion uh with uh setting up a
[02:53:30.960 --> 02:53:38.240]  meeting with the russians well within the purview of general flinn's job part of his responsibilities
[02:53:38.240 --> 02:53:44.240]  as the national security advisor in my opinion it's smart to be talking to the russians they have
[02:53:44.240 --> 02:53:49.680]  thermonuclear weapons they can blow the entire world to hell we know i totally agree with you
[02:53:49.680 --> 02:53:53.920]  let's shift gears quickly then what else are they going to do is they're cornered rats because
[02:53:53.920 --> 02:53:59.440]  that's what everybody's spidey since it's concerned about a b uh look at trump in debos they're like
[02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:06.880]  in awe and it looks like another big coup for america it's the one-two punch the indictment of
[02:54:06.880 --> 02:54:14.320]  kushner followed by some effort to entrap the president uh who thinks he's going to an interview
[02:54:14.320 --> 02:54:19.280]  to talk about russian collusion look i sympathize with the president i know why he's willing to
[02:54:19.280 --> 02:54:25.600]  get this interview he knows in his heart he's done nothing wrong he knows in his heart that there was
[02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:32.080]  no russian collusion what he doesn't understand is that miller and his pack of partisan hacks are
[02:54:32.080 --> 02:54:38.960]  weasels uh and they're going to try to euker him box him into some obstruction of justice charge or
[02:54:38.960 --> 02:54:45.600]  some perjury charge that's what they have coming those are the bomb shells that the hill is referring
[02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:52.320]  to that's right and you told me before trump was even elected he said kushner's not a bad guy he's
[02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:58.160]  a good guy but you know the uh business dealings real estate that the fbi couldn't die to ham sandwich
[02:54:58.160 --> 02:55:02.160]  and kushner doesn't think he's anything wrong so he's been blabbering to everybody as well and
[02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:06.400]  miller's gone and interviewed all these people now so they're going after kushner because he was nice
[02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:12.400]  to them no i couldn't agree with you more alex there's no jared kushner's done nothing wrong
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:18.240]  that i'm aware of other than try to help his father-in-law make america great again we disagree
[02:55:18.240 --> 02:55:23.920]  politically but i do think his heart's in the right place and he strongly favors the success of
[02:55:23.920 --> 02:55:30.000]  the trump administration what he doesn't understand is that miller is not a buy the book prosecutor
[02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:38.080]  this is not an unbiased process this is a small nest of partisan rats that seek to box the president
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:44.320]  so that they can remove him all they want to do is undo what they couldn't do in the election last
[02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:48.320]  november by the way i do like the fact you have security there we have security as well i'm just
[02:55:48.320 --> 02:55:52.880]  i'm just making the joke because he was a muscle guy behind you but seriously you can also hold up

[02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:01.120]  that you're heavily armed so i think that's the real reason that you and your wife everybody are
[02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:06.320]  safe plus uh this fellow here i wouldn't start anything with him either well it's look it's for

[03:01:06.480 --> 03:01:13.840]  for two plus years nothing found and on the other side all the illegal wiretaps and all the spying
[03:01:13.840 --> 03:01:19.280]  and all the lying and and all the deleting text and all the secret societies and all the insurance
[03:01:19.280 --> 03:01:27.680]  policies and then joe scarborough goes on television and says just stop your conspiracy theories because
[03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:35.440]  you are making america less safe that's what they get down to now and just nebulous conspiracy theories
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:43.920]  when they're the ones putting out the conspiracy theories we told everybody samsung galaxy phones
[03:01:43.920 --> 03:01:50.400]  of that type i even knew this when i heard it but then all the tech experts came out and said you
[03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:57.680]  cannot erase them without burning them the governments have demanded the u.s government
[03:01:57.680 --> 03:02:04.400]  mainly in telecommunication acts going back to 96 that they have encryption keys i'm not the tech
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:09.840]  guy the point is they never really erased the data it's how it's organized it just rewrites it to say
[03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:17.760]  you can now write over this but it's still there and so of course the justice department then
[03:02:17.760 --> 03:02:22.880]  announced today oh we were able to get in the 50 000 emails because no one bought it they had to back
[03:02:22.880 --> 03:02:32.560]  off okay it's a conspiracy theory to say it's erased because the fbi knows about everybody
[03:02:32.560 --> 03:02:36.960]  going back the first thing was like 35 years ago they were scared of counterfeiting so they got the
[03:02:36.960 --> 03:02:41.360]  printer companies to put secret codes in the ink so they could tell when you bought it and who you
[03:02:41.360 --> 03:02:45.200]  were and all that and of course now that's known so let's go to scarborough man you talk about
[03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:52.000]  conspiracy theories this guy is the biggest discredited joke in the galaxy here he is talking
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:58.000]  about who is the informant to run johnson's the McCarthy accusation like accusation i mean
[03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:01.840]  you know one of the worst things about this incidentally the fbi does make mistakes and there
[03:03:01.840 --> 03:03:06.880]  aren't problems the fbi and you do want congressional oversight of our executive branch institutions
[03:03:06.880 --> 03:03:11.680]  and this discredits sort of i think legitimate efforts to say wait a second let's take a look
[03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:18.640]  at this or that at all this dirty pool that is being played by members of uh that that neocon
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:25.120]  they have on his father was the head of the trotskyites and reported directly william
[03:03:25.120 --> 03:03:33.440]  crystal to trotsky who Stalin had killed in mexico with an isax he is third in command
[03:03:34.320 --> 03:03:39.440]  from trotsky and they said we got to take the republicans over if we're going to have communism
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:44.400]  be successful and there it sits thought i'd just add that he's not going to tell you that uh go
[03:03:44.400 --> 03:03:48.960]  ahead even the new york times though admits that very proud of it though that is that is the the
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:55.760]  heir to trotsky let's continue that is being played by members of uh of the senate and the house
[03:03:56.480 --> 03:04:03.280]  and the administration you're undercutting the foundation of this democracy okay that's enough
[03:04:03.280 --> 03:04:08.240]  he gets into conspiracy very crap i want to add this her dad was the head architect of
[03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:12.400]  wanting world war three with the russians who had bragged that he helped have genocide
[03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:17.040]  by manipulating the situation uh in cambodia that killed 30 percent of the population
[03:04:17.040 --> 03:04:20.320]  this is big to brazil's key i mean i could just keep hitting you and hitting you and hitting you
[03:04:20.320 --> 03:04:24.560]  see when you know who these people are and then you got scar bro with the dead intern
[03:04:25.600 --> 03:04:32.240]  and the autopsy they wouldn't do and you just are looking at a bunch of scum i mean it's just i
[03:04:32.240 --> 03:04:36.560]  can go through every one of these people on tv man it's like north korea where you have a third
[03:04:36.560 --> 03:04:42.720]  generation dictator these scumbags then their kids end up ruling over us i mean i guess meek

[03:06:13.200 --> 03:06:29.600]  alex jones show john rapaport here in the fourth hour sitting in for alex at info wars
[03:06:31.120 --> 03:06:38.160]  i was talking on a show earlier today and i just want to kind of finish up on a theme that i think is
[03:06:38.160 --> 03:06:45.360]  in line with what alex was talking about and what's really going on here there's a little item called
[03:06:46.320 --> 03:06:56.000]  achievement know that word achievement it's not taught anymore it's not elevated anymore in schools
[03:06:57.200 --> 03:07:07.600]  the idea that great achievements can be made especially launched by an individual or
[03:07:07.600 --> 03:07:18.320]  who can't have that but achievement in general has taken a very far backseat to the idea of
[03:07:19.360 --> 03:07:29.040]  some kind of giant cheese glob of collectivism in our society oh we're all in this together and so
[03:07:29.040 --> 03:07:37.600]  and so and it's all we're all the same and the thing and the glob and the floating around and oh yes
[03:07:37.600 --> 03:07:45.760]  and and uh just you know be part of uh of the group and the collective and and just uh for the sake
[03:07:45.760 --> 03:07:54.800]  of utopia that's coming right around the corner all of this preposterous crap has been floated now
[03:07:54.800 --> 03:08:01.520]  now seriously floated now for the last 30 or 40 years and achievement where did that go
[03:08:02.720 --> 03:08:10.240]  achievement the great achievements i came of age in new york city i used to stand out there at night
[03:08:10.240 --> 03:08:17.120]  on rooftops go up to the top of the empire state building you look out new york city at night
[03:08:17.120 --> 03:08:27.920]  what an incredible sensation that this has been built that this all was made
[03:08:28.640 --> 03:08:37.120]  that this all came up out of the ground by human effort it wasn't lowered from a spaceship
[03:08:37.120 --> 03:08:45.600]  somebody didn't just snap their fingers and it appeared it was created and designed and built
[03:08:47.760 --> 03:08:48.560]  up to the sky
[03:08:51.040 --> 03:08:59.920]  it just marches out to the horizon at night this fantastic sense of expansion achievement taking
[03:08:59.920 --> 03:09:09.760]  wing and maybe you've seen the old photographs in black and white high steel workers sitting up there
[03:09:09.760 --> 03:09:17.680]  on way above the ground on girders in the middle of the day eating their lunch casually
[03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:28.080]  they built them they built them and when they came down finally for the end when it was all
[03:09:28.080 --> 03:09:32.880]  done they looked up there and they said we built this we built this achievement
[03:09:34.960 --> 03:09:45.040]  and now you have all kinds of globalist front groups little diabolical creatures
[03:09:45.040 --> 03:09:52.320]  scurrying along that want to tear it all down tear it all down get rid of the whole thing
[03:09:52.320 --> 03:09:58.640]  let's tear it all down because that'll be righteous that will be payback
[03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:05.600]  for what for what what are you going to put in this place
[03:10:07.520 --> 03:10:15.920]  people looking across the land for tubers and roots and living in trees is that what you want
[03:10:15.920 --> 03:10:26.080]  is that going to be final social justice there are so many fantastic places around the world
[03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:35.040]  when you see them and you look at them and you stand there and you realize how they have
[03:10:35.040 --> 03:10:49.440]  been built by people created invented designed labored over constructed fantastic things you
[03:10:49.440 --> 03:10:54.800]  go to the Frick Museum a little museum in New York City and you see two or three magnificent
[03:10:54.800 --> 03:11:02.160]  paintings by Vermeer you go to the Metropolitan Museum you look at a few fantastic paintings
[03:11:02.160 --> 03:11:10.000]  by Van Eyck you begin to get a sense of achievement achievement that takes wing
[03:11:11.440 --> 03:11:19.760]  that is still at the heart and the root of what the future is all about if it's not about that
[03:11:20.480 --> 03:11:26.720]  it's not about anything except destruction tearing it all down and of course that's what
[03:11:26.720 --> 03:11:36.640]  what the arch globalists want to do that's where they want to go because then they can rebuild it
[03:11:36.640 --> 03:11:49.760]  in their image that is the image of the machine where the humans are machines and the machines
[03:11:49.760 --> 03:11:56.320]  are machines and everything is run like clockwork technically everything is on schedule
[03:11:56.320 --> 03:12:02.800]  everything is on time everything is measured out by small drips and drafts people are in slots
[03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:16.240]  people are units ciphers non-entities of no concern no regard except as ant colonies of the future
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:26.000]  that is their version of achievement and for that they do not need people
[03:12:27.600 --> 03:12:33.280]  they do not need people and they certainly don't need people to be inspired to want to achieve
[03:12:34.080 --> 03:12:41.520]  you want to achieve if you can't see that or find it it's covered up and you need to
[03:12:41.520 --> 03:12:50.800]  to get the draw out of the way and clear down to that river of creative energy that is achievement
[03:12:50.800 --> 03:13:00.160]  that is the basis of freedom the reason for freedom to achieve in this world
[03:13:00.160 --> 03:13:13.920]  the eerie canal ever hear of it in the early 19th century new york city which was the major
[03:13:13.920 --> 03:13:22.000]  center of commerce certainly in the new world was blocked off from the interior of the country
[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:29.280]  where there were you know endless resources there was no possibility of trade you had mountains in
[03:13:29.280 --> 03:13:37.760]  the way and you had pack animals and how were you going to build any kind of market free market
[03:13:37.760 --> 03:13:48.080]  economy impossible but the governor of new york d whit clinton an individual who was all about
[03:13:48.080 --> 03:13:57.600]  achievement said guess what we're going to build a 363 mile canal from albany new york
[03:13:57.600 --> 03:14:03.600]  connecting to the great lakes and thereby into the interior of america so that we can ship
[03:14:04.400 --> 03:14:10.960]  goods trade back and forth by water people thought he was completely crazy
[03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:20.400]  clinton's folly clinton's ditch this was not with technology of present day this was
[03:14:20.400 --> 03:14:28.400]  people grabbing the guts of the land and saying we are going to build with what we have
[03:14:31.200 --> 03:14:38.960]  363 miles of canal from albany through mountains across mountains
[03:14:40.880 --> 03:14:45.200]  to the great lakes and thereby opening up the whole interior of the united states
[03:14:45.200 --> 03:14:52.400]  well you can't do that that's ridiculous all the little diabolical demons nipped at his heels
[03:14:52.960 --> 03:14:57.440]  you know because that's all they can do they can't do anything themselves they can't create
[03:14:57.440 --> 03:15:03.200]  anything all they can do is know away like little rats he paid no attention to that instead of
[03:15:03.200 --> 03:15:08.880]  course we're going to do it and he did it and they did it all the people who worked on that did it
[03:15:08.880 --> 03:15:17.280]  it was completed in 1825 this was the same d witt clinton who said
[03:15:19.600 --> 03:15:26.560]  at a time when most of the people living in manhattan in new york city lived at the bottom

[03:21:43.440 --> 03:21:53.520]  so i was talking about d whit clinton before the break and how he masterminded and envisioned and
[03:21:53.520 --> 03:22:00.160]  pushed forward this fantastic thing called the eerie canal in 1825 well he did something else in
[03:22:00.160 --> 03:22:08.320]  new york if you've ever been to Manhattan you know it's a grid it's laid out as a grid the avenues
[03:22:08.320 --> 03:22:14.000]  go north and south first avenue second avenue third avenue fourth so forth some with names most
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:23.360]  with numbers and the streets across 14th street 15th 16th 17th 23rd etc etc all the way up to the
[03:22:23.360 --> 03:22:31.440]  top of Manhattan well in the early days of Manhattan most people lived at the bottom and
[03:22:31.440 --> 03:22:42.400]  when you look north what did you see hills valleys forests and so on and so forth how would you
[03:22:42.400 --> 03:22:53.600]  build a city there a metropolitan city such as new york became d whit clinton said this is what
[03:22:53.600 --> 03:23:01.520]  this is what we're going to do we're going to take the area the uninhabited area north of where
[03:23:01.520 --> 03:23:10.320]  people are living and we're going to flatten it what yeah we're going to flatten it we're going to
[03:23:10.320 --> 03:23:15.200]  carve away all those hills everything and we're going to make it flat and we're going to build a
[03:23:15.200 --> 03:23:20.400]  giant city there now some people say oh my god that's horrible whatever whatever whatever but this
[03:23:20.400 --> 03:23:27.840]  is how the magnificent achievement called new york city Manhattan developed that's how it was done
[03:23:27.840 --> 03:23:34.080]  and again all the little scurrilous creatures were trying to nip at his heels and say this was
[03:23:34.080 --> 03:23:39.760]  insane and you couldn't do it it couldn't be done he said it's going to be done and it was
[03:23:40.560 --> 03:23:48.880]  and that's why Manhattan is pretty flat and that's why the city extended north of where it was
[03:23:48.880 --> 03:23:55.120]  and that's how this magnificent achievement called new york city came to being achievement
[03:23:57.520 --> 03:24:05.040]  the young do not hear this word the way it used to be heard it's not taught the way it used to be
[03:24:05.040 --> 03:24:13.120]  taught this is what comes out of freedom real freedom and this is what terrifies the controllers
[03:24:13.120 --> 03:24:21.120]  who want to make this planet into a machine in which the humans are machines achievement
[03:24:23.520 --> 03:24:32.960]  your achievement my achievement every individual's achievement okay so you've heard a great deal now
[03:24:32.960 --> 03:24:38.560]  about the secret house memo and what it contains and what it might contain and what happens if it's
[03:24:38.560 --> 03:24:47.360]  released and so forth and so on well there's a secret another secret memo which i call for
[03:24:47.360 --> 03:24:57.760]  purposes of discussion the secret medical memo this is a blockbuster but the funny thing about
[03:24:57.760 --> 03:25:04.160]  it is is that it's not secret at all it's open information the information is already been
[03:25:04.160 --> 03:25:17.680]  published in open journals it's there it accuses by implication one of the biggest agencies of the
[03:25:17.680 --> 03:25:27.840]  federal government several actually of mass murder and yet nothing has happened the medical memo
[03:25:27.840 --> 03:25:40.080]  story number two i'm going to read from my piece today why the fda should be charged with murder
[03:25:40.080 --> 03:25:44.640]  if you work for a federal agency that was killing people at the rate of a hundred thousand a year
[03:25:44.640 --> 03:25:50.880]  every year like clockwork and if you knew it wouldn't you feel compelled to say or do something about
[03:25:50.880 --> 03:25:58.960]  it i think i can assure that 99.999% of the people listening to this program would say you bet
[03:25:59.600 --> 03:26:07.440]  absolutely and yet the people who are committing these crimes do not feel that way at all they
[03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:23.120]  are not like you or me they are different smoking guns on the memo open secrets in the literature
[03:26:24.880 --> 03:26:29.440]  i don't usually make the citations on air but i'm going to just to show you that it's there
[03:26:29.440 --> 03:26:39.680]  bmj british medical journal online june 7th 2012 author gene lenzer
[03:26:41.360 --> 03:26:49.840]  refers to a report by the institution institute for safe medication practices quote it the report
[03:26:49.840 --> 03:26:56.480]  calculated that in 2011 prescription drugs were associated with two to four million people in the
[03:26:56.480 --> 03:27:06.000]  us experiencing quote serious disabling or fatal injuries including 128 000 deaths
[03:27:08.960 --> 03:27:18.160]  prescription drugs associated with that in 2011 the report called this quote one of the most
[03:27:18.160 --> 03:27:29.360]  significant perils to humans resulting from human activity and quote it's quite a smoking gun would
[03:27:29.360 --> 03:27:37.600]  you say and the final dagger the report was compiled by outside researchers who went into the fda's
[03:27:37.600 --> 03:27:48.480]  own database of serious adverse medical drug events otherwise known as death and destruction now
[03:27:50.400 --> 03:27:55.440]  therefore you can't say that the fda the food and drug administration was unaware of all of
[03:27:55.440 --> 03:28:03.760]  this of course they have been aware of all of this in fact they are the agency the only agency
[03:28:03.760 --> 03:28:13.040]  in america that approve medical drugs for public use if you don't get their seal of approval you
[03:28:13.040 --> 03:28:19.120]  can't sell your drugs in america they approve as safe and effective
[03:28:21.920 --> 03:28:29.600]  128 000 deaths a year from the drugs they approve we'll have more after the break this is john

[03:34:54.240 --> 03:35:02.000]  secret at all because it's been out in the open all this time for some reason the mainstream press
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:08.880]  just doesn't report on it wow what a shock huh and for some reason the federal government
[03:35:09.840 --> 03:35:14.560]  doesn't do anything about it even though they're responsible for what a shock right
[03:35:16.560 --> 03:35:20.800]  and isn't it interesting that the medical destruction that i'm talking about here
[03:35:21.520 --> 03:35:29.440]  is part and parcel of a cartel the medical cartel that is one of the strongest if not
[03:35:29.440 --> 03:35:40.320]  the strongest arm of that movement called globalism because if you are going and i never get tired of
[03:35:40.320 --> 03:35:47.680]  saying this to take over a planet you need to find a way to weaken the enemy from within
[03:35:47.680 --> 03:35:59.920]  to confuse disorient debilitate destroy weaken and that's what the effects of all of these
[03:35:59.920 --> 03:36:07.360]  medical drugs that i'm talking about are in the secret medical memo so let's go to the next
[03:36:07.360 --> 03:36:16.560]  citation dr barba starfield july 26 2000 journal of the american medical association she was at
[03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:22.560]  the time a revered health public health expert at the johns hopkins school of public health
[03:36:23.680 --> 03:36:30.080]  mainstream credentials up and down the line i like to quote these sources why i understand
[03:36:30.080 --> 03:36:39.200]  that independent researchers peg medical destruction even higher than here quite a bit higher but
[03:36:39.200 --> 03:36:50.480]  when i quote mainstream meticulous medical sources the government can no longer deny
[03:36:51.920 --> 03:36:56.240]  and say well it's just people on the fringe no they're not they're people in the heart of the
[03:36:56.240 --> 03:37:03.200]  establishment who blew the whistle dr barba starfield july 26 2000 journal of the american
[03:37:03.200 --> 03:37:10.080]  medical association her conclusion in a review called is u.s health really the best in the world
[03:37:10.080 --> 03:37:18.400]  that's the citation the medical system in the u.s fda approved pharmaceutical drugs kill
[03:37:18.400 --> 03:37:27.840]  106 000 people a year in the u.s or a million people per decade that's called destruction
[03:37:27.840 --> 03:37:31.360]  serious destruction
[03:37:36.960 --> 03:37:44.560]  so what's supposed to happen in order to get the fda to do something or to get a sitting president
[03:37:44.560 --> 03:37:53.440]  to simply say here are the crimes we are going to fire everybody there fumigate the buildings
[03:37:53.440 --> 03:38:01.360]  and start over because this is an ongoing riko murder machine that's what it is
[03:38:03.760 --> 03:38:11.440]  do people have to take the corpses of their families the hundred thousand a year and drag
[03:38:11.440 --> 03:38:20.640]  them to the door of the fda and say you approved the drugs that are that killed my mother father
[03:38:20.640 --> 03:38:25.360]  brother sister cousin child is that what it takes
[03:38:28.400 --> 03:38:39.840]  maybe maybe now as i write in this piece if instead of these medical drugs killing people
[03:38:39.840 --> 03:38:50.560]  suppose the hundred thousand deaths per year were led by ginkgo ginseng vitamin d niacin raw
[03:38:50.560 --> 03:38:55.760]  milk what do you think would happen i'll tell you what would happen seals delta four swat team
[03:38:55.760 --> 03:39:02.160]  snipers predator drones tanks and infantry would be lining up and hovering outside every
[03:39:02.160 --> 03:39:10.880]  health food store nutritional supplement company in america that's what would happen
[03:39:10.880 --> 03:39:20.240]  if instead of virtually zero deaths from any of those or any other nutritional supplements
[03:39:20.240 --> 03:39:28.320]  we're talking about a hundred thousand at minimum a conservative estimate killed by fda approved
[03:39:28.320 --> 03:39:37.600]  correctly prescribed medicines in america every year every year
[03:39:39.920 --> 03:39:47.280]  okay you think that's all no there's more there's more there's more to the secret medical memo
[03:39:48.720 --> 03:39:51.840]  and i'll give you the quotes first and then i'll give you the source
[03:39:51.840 --> 03:39:58.000]  appropriately prescribed prescription drugs are the fourth leading cause of death
[03:39:58.720 --> 03:40:06.720]  about 330 000 patients die each year from prescription drugs in the us and europe listening
[03:40:06.720 --> 03:40:15.040]  europe i know we've got lots of listeners there they the drugs cause an epidemic of about 20 times
[03:40:15.040 --> 03:40:25.040]  more that would be 6.6 million per year hospitalizations as well as falls road accidents and about
[03:40:25.040 --> 03:40:34.480]  80 million per year medically minor problems such as pains discomforts and dysfunctions
[03:40:34.480 --> 03:40:40.640]  that hobble productivity or the ability to care for others that's not minor
[03:40:40.640 --> 03:40:50.560]  deaths from over medication errors and self medication would increase these figures
[03:40:52.320 --> 03:41:01.200]  in other words and now i'm talking the 330 000 deaths per year the 6.6 million hospitalizations
[03:41:01.200 --> 03:41:09.760]  per year and the 80 million medically minor problems per year all of this stems from correctly
[03:41:09.760 --> 03:41:21.120]  prescribed medicines and these quotes come from the american sociological association
[03:41:21.120 --> 03:41:29.040]  publication called footnotes in its november 2014 issue the article is the epidemic of sickness
[03:41:29.040 --> 03:41:37.280]  and death from prescription drugs the author is donald w light donald w light is a professor
[03:41:37.280 --> 03:41:43.280]  of medical and economic sociology a founding fellow of the center for bioethics at the
[03:41:43.280 --> 03:41:50.720]  university of pennsylvania in 2013 he was a fellow at the edmund j sapra center for ethics at
[03:41:50.720 --> 03:41:57.600]  harvard he is a low key visiting professor at stanford university and a fellow of the royal
[03:41:57.600 --> 03:42:04.000]  society of medicine in other words this guy has mainstream credentials up and down the line as
[03:42:04.000 --> 03:42:11.520]  far as you want to go and that's what he's saying those are the deaths and destruction
[03:42:11.520 --> 03:42:19.840]  numbers of the medical cartel in the u.s and europe and he or any of the other sources i've
[03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:26.960]  just quoted none of them are talking about vaccines they are just talking about medical drugs
[03:42:26.960 --> 03:42:42.880]  more when we come back from the break john rapaport sitting in for alex

[03:47:20.960 --> 03:47:31.280]  jones show and now your host john rapaport here we go in the last segment here john rapaport
[03:47:31.280 --> 03:47:40.560]  sitting in for alex i want to just uh from the secret medical memo i just want to repeat a few
[03:47:40.560 --> 03:47:44.800]  figures here this is the last citation that i gave you from donald light
[03:47:44.800 --> 03:47:58.960]  they the drugs appropriately prescribed 330 000 patients die each year from prescription drugs
[03:47:58.960 --> 03:48:07.200]  in the us and europe do the math what does that turn out to be per decade 330 000 per year
[03:48:07.200 --> 03:48:14.960]  here sounds like uh three approaching three and a half million to you just move the decimal points
[03:48:16.320 --> 03:48:25.440]  quote they the drugs also cause an epidemic of about 20 times more that would be about
[03:48:25.440 --> 03:48:37.760]  6.6 million per year hospitalizations as well as falls road accidents and about 80 million per
[03:48:37.760 --> 03:48:47.760]  year medically minor problems such as pain discomforts and dysfunctions that hobble productivity
[03:48:47.760 --> 03:49:01.280]  or the ability to care for others that's like a roadmap to how do you destroy a country or a
[03:49:01.280 --> 03:49:11.840]  continent let's see how can we do this well we can say it's medicine i mean we've already invested
[03:49:11.840 --> 03:49:19.280]  billions in promotion pr and propaganda to assure the public that the medical people are only doing
[03:49:19.280 --> 03:49:26.560]  good and doing better at doing good all the time that that's all that's happening in the medical
[03:49:26.560 --> 03:49:38.800]  cartel so we can simply piggyback on that and we just say that we are building a better world well
[03:49:38.800 --> 03:49:47.840]  in fact and here we would be listening in at the highest levels of conversation we are actually
[03:49:47.840 --> 03:49:55.520]  infiltrating all of these countries and as you can see by these numbers wreaking havoc and
[03:49:55.520 --> 03:50:02.560]  destruction and death and maiming and turmoil emotional loss and so on and so forth on a scale
[03:50:02.560 --> 03:50:09.680]  that is just absolutely unbelievable under the noses of the public the press the government
[03:50:09.680 --> 03:50:16.480]  so what have you everybody and it's being completely ignored and yet it's right out in the open
[03:50:16.480 --> 03:50:24.320]  and we would even publish occasionally articles reviews that would indicate what the story is
[03:50:24.320 --> 03:50:34.080]  is that just disappear and go away that's what's happening
[03:50:36.240 --> 03:50:41.440]  that's what's happening that's what prompts some people to say the biggest secrets are out in the
[03:50:41.440 --> 03:50:51.120]  open so the secret medical memo that i just revealed to you as i said is from open sources
[03:50:51.120 --> 03:51:01.280]  right out there in the literature in the mainstream literature didn't have to go down into some
[03:51:02.000 --> 03:51:10.400]  subterranean cavern with goblins and present some kind of a amulet to secret sign to get the
[03:51:10.400 --> 03:51:22.640]  dusty volumes from past centuries medical journals sociological journal it's right out there right
[03:51:22.640 --> 03:51:30.640]  there majority people look at that and they say well i know what i just read i think but of course
[03:51:31.520 --> 03:51:38.160]  couldn't be true or i must have misread that or i don't even want to think about i what i just read
[03:51:38.160 --> 03:51:45.840]  imagine a doctor reading this right you know he's in the brotherhood he's in the society
[03:51:46.400 --> 03:51:56.000]  of Hippocrates from ancient times first do no harm and he reads this 300 thousand 330 thousand
[03:51:56.000 --> 03:52:02.560]  deaths from approved correctly prescribed medical drugs in the u.s and europe every year
[03:52:02.560 --> 03:52:12.480]  here and millions more maimings and destruction you know i didn't read he's gonna say i i i never
[03:52:12.480 --> 03:52:23.120]  saw it never saw it never read it never heard of it that's how secret it can become you just hold
[03:52:23.120 --> 03:52:29.040]  it up and say here it is and people go what happened i don't know let's you know
[03:52:29.040 --> 03:52:34.960]  no what's on television no here it is
[03:52:37.280 --> 03:52:44.640]  that's the secret medical memo now if you want something to do imagine what might happen
[03:52:45.280 --> 03:52:52.960]  if by say next week a million more people than right now knew the facts that i just presented
[03:52:52.960 --> 03:52:58.880]  to you if you participated in getting the information that i'm just giving you right here
[03:52:59.600 --> 03:53:04.960]  out in the open and a million more people became aware of it and some fraction of those
[03:53:04.960 --> 03:53:12.240]  million would pass that on to others and that ripple would keep on going and going and going
[03:53:12.240 --> 03:53:19.840]  and going and then the next time it's brought up the same thing and more another million people
[03:53:19.840 --> 03:53:27.680]  or so would become aware of it and of course some people say well it doesn't matter if they're oh yeah
[03:53:27.680 --> 03:53:34.880]  it does matter it does matter don't be so cynical it does matter how do you think we got to where
[03:53:34.880 --> 03:53:41.760]  we are now because people are waking up how do you think it happened that the major media are in
[03:53:41.760 --> 03:53:50.240]  such chaos and disarray and so desperate do you think that was just a ploy on their part
[03:53:50.240 --> 03:53:57.280]  let's pretend that we're completely insane for the next year or two you know there's a meeting
[03:53:57.280 --> 03:54:03.040]  and cnn i've got a great idea says jeff zucker the head of cnn and we're all going to pretend
[03:54:03.040 --> 03:54:08.640]  that we're insane and and then people will say these people are out of their minds i'm not going
[03:54:08.640 --> 03:54:16.240]  to watch them anymore no no no no all this happens because people get out the information
[03:54:17.440 --> 03:54:26.400]  and other people understand it and they go to true sources and they desert the fake sources
[03:54:27.600 --> 03:54:35.120]  this is real this is not some dream an illusion this is happening now so i've just given you
[03:54:35.120 --> 03:54:44.240]  you the secret info of the secret medical memo why not get it out there why not let people know
[03:54:44.240 --> 03:54:55.440]  what's actually happening in the words of mainstream medical doctors researchers investigators
[03:54:55.440 --> 03:55:02.480]  analysts those are the people i've been quoting here those are the people i've been quoting
[03:55:02.480 --> 03:55:09.120]  why not get that information out i've been writing about it for a long time
[03:55:13.360 --> 03:55:21.040]  it's there it's there the journal american medical association it's there in other journals
[03:55:21.040 --> 03:55:31.600]  british medical journal let's have a field day with it let's expose this arm of the globalist
[03:55:31.600 --> 03:55:41.600]  takeover for what it is the infiltration of societies in order to debilitate destroy and weaken
[03:55:41.600 --> 03:55:51.440]  and confuse the people and some of you say well it's just an accident you see it's not on purpose
[03:55:52.640 --> 03:55:59.520]  okay you want to say that but what happens if the medical professionals the medical leaders
[03:55:59.520 --> 03:56:06.320]  the medical bureaucrats the medical chiefs in charge become aware of this accident and do nothing
[03:56:06.320 --> 03:56:13.440]  about it not just for a day or week or a month or a year but decades they do nothing about it
[03:56:13.440 --> 03:56:20.880]  what does that tell you they know it and they do nothing where did i start all this i said
[03:56:20.880 --> 03:56:27.040]  suppose you were the head of this agency that was approving a safe and effective medical drugs
[03:56:27.040 --> 03:56:33.040]  year after year after year that we're killing like clockwork hundred thousand thousand people
[03:56:33.600 --> 03:56:40.400]  a year or a million people a decade and you became aware of it what would you do well you know what
[03:56:40.400 --> 03:56:46.560]  you would do but the people who actually are in charge are aware and they have done nothing
[03:56:46.560 --> 03:57:01.360]  and that tells you that they're guilty as charged and they continue to be a protection
[03:57:01.360 --> 03:57:09.840]  racket for murder and destruction what else would you call it try to tap dance around this if you
