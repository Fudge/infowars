[01:19.000 --> 01:23.960]  Dallas for that event as well it's only about a mile and a half away from the grassy Noel Dealey
[01:23.960 --> 01:34.920]  Plaza did coast-to-coast AM last night for an hour that was interesting as usual good to see
[01:34.920 --> 01:41.320]  George Norrie actually growing that show was reading in the newspaper it is the only premiere
[01:41.320 --> 01:48.280]  radio network show national show that is now making money you know that all the others are
[01:48.280 --> 01:55.160]  imploding basically but radio across the board is in deep trouble because every other industry is
[01:55.160 --> 02:03.240]  not just media it's the recession leading into depression but again because George has myself
[02:03.240 --> 02:09.480]  and others on and took that show in a new direction five years ago to about 30 percent
[02:10.120 --> 02:14.120]  neural order news and information when you didn't basically get any of that before
[02:14.120 --> 02:21.960]  it has actually grown but a side issue just wanted to plug that and also say we want
[02:22.920 --> 02:28.360]  George Norrie to have his new national TV show picked up permanently that's been airing all
[02:28.360 --> 02:32.600]  this week the last one airs tonight at different times across the country in the world on the
[02:32.600 --> 02:40.840]  sci-fi channel find out more at coast-to-coastam.com why do we want that well you know they're doing
[02:40.840 --> 02:50.600]  some of the fun topics right now vampires aliens at lanus there's nothing wrong with entertainment
[02:52.120 --> 02:57.320]  and george will tell you that himself on air but that show gets picked up folks you're gonna see
[02:57.320 --> 03:04.120]  some more serious topics and serious gas on it so we definitely want that to happen blush
[03:04.120 --> 03:10.760]  george is a great guy so be sure and tune into that this evening on the sci-fi channel
[03:12.440 --> 03:16.600]  and let them know you appreciate it because we need a friend in high places that's why I hope
[03:18.040 --> 03:32.440]  Ventura and his time Warner show true tv but he will not compromise on the show exposing
[03:32.440 --> 03:39.240]  9-11 and JFK and other things so he's you know said to me here on air on other
[03:40.920 --> 03:44.360]  places that uh he doesn't even know if it will be picked up but that pilot
[03:45.080 --> 03:50.040]  has been shot and should be airing the next three or four months or so so that's exciting on that
[03:50.040 --> 03:57.160]  front as well but I already digress into tertiary issues here kind of inside baseball stuff but
[03:57.160 --> 04:06.520]  but you know I said I'd get into mark cuban yesterday and uh the securities and exchange
[04:06.520 --> 04:14.120]  commission charging him civilly but then sending out with martha steward it then led to criminal
[04:15.080 --> 04:19.160]  and uh my involvement in the story loose change final cuts involvement in the story
[04:19.800 --> 04:23.640]  and so I'm going to write a note here today and try to get into that I mean I got into some of it
[04:23.640 --> 04:29.560]  yesterday but not as much as I had wanted to it it is an important story of persecution
[04:30.200 --> 04:37.240]  and attacks on free speech but uh when we get back I I haven't even gotten into the news and I'm
[04:37.240 --> 04:44.520]  going to cover it it is staggering you know uh the Chinese government is looking at buying up the
[04:44.520 --> 04:51.720]  big three u.s automakers oh yes we'll be right back and the communist Chinese governments running
[04:51.720 --> 04:56.360]  many of the ports in the united states we'll be right back stay with us
[05:00.600 --> 05:04.520]  hello friends this is alex jones I've told you for a long time it's important to be
[05:04.520 --> 05:08.760]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food
[05:08.760 --> 05:13.240]  and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[05:13.240 --> 05:18.040]  never have to go to the super dome and beg for femur to take care of your family in any emergency
[05:18.040 --> 05:22.440]  if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for a special
[05:22.440 --> 05:26.840]  interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email
[05:26.840 --> 05:31.640]  they voted to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now
[05:31.640 --> 05:36.760]  owns the america and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[05:36.760 --> 05:42.200]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans
[05:42.200 --> 05:47.880]  reach in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it
[05:47.880 --> 05:53.160]  reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may
[05:53.160 --> 05:58.280]  be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores
[05:58.280 --> 06:03.240]  enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business
[06:03.240 --> 06:08.360]  whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food
[06:08.360 --> 06:12.520]  one third of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities
[06:12.520 --> 06:17.640]  my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there
[06:17.640 --> 06:21.480]  listening it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the
[06:21.480 --> 06:26.120]  government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of
[06:26.120 --> 06:30.680]  self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation

[13:58.520 --> 14:04.440]  uh and then took him to jail and then they took him out in a coma out of the jail cell
[14:05.160 --> 14:09.800]  this is a sports illustrated i don't think these cops will get away with this though because

[14:15.400 --> 14:20.520]  percent probably are and uh every couple days i read about him beating somebody to death in
[14:20.520 --> 14:27.800]  houston or new york or la you know on video camera and uh they don't get in trouble and the public
[14:27.800 --> 14:32.840]  sees this and so it makes the public hate all police and uh when you've got troops serving
[14:32.840 --> 14:39.320]  three four five tours they completely lose their minds and uh they're coming back and becoming
[14:39.320 --> 14:43.880]  cops and they're killing their families and other cops and going postal every day
[14:46.120 --> 14:49.800]  and statistically it's the cops families and other cops that have got to worry so

[14:54.920 --> 14:59.240]  with it well you are going to get away with it you are going to get away with everything you do

[24:00.120 --> 24:02.120]  Democracy don't rule the world
[24:02.120 --> 24:05.120]  You better get down in your head
[24:08.120 --> 24:11.120]  This world is moved by violence
[24:11.120 --> 24:17.120]  But I guess that's better than I said
[24:17.120 --> 24:20.120]  From the far away, it's a milky way
[24:20.120 --> 24:23.120]  That's a lot of territory and deal
[24:23.120 --> 24:26.120]  And a man's gonna do what a man's gotta do
[24:26.120 --> 24:29.120]  And a man's gonna do what his has to do

[24:43.120 --> 24:47.120]  We'll talk about solutions and getting active on the streets
[24:47.120 --> 24:50.120]  Got the in the fed folks on tomorrow
[24:50.120 --> 24:56.120]  It is the 45th anniversary of the shadow government really taking over fully and saying
[24:56.120 --> 25:00.120]  President, you don't run a jack squat paying your debt
[25:03.120 --> 25:06.120]  Alright, I went over a lot of the news
[25:07.120 --> 25:09.120]  That is grazed over it
[25:10.120 --> 25:13.120]  But I'm gonna get into more detail now
[25:14.120 --> 25:21.120]  It's a big deal to have the worst consumer confidence
[25:21.120 --> 25:27.120]  And the worst price drop on record
[25:27.120 --> 25:29.120]  I mean every record's being broken
[25:29.120 --> 25:31.120]  You see in the last year of World War II
[25:31.120 --> 25:33.120]  Millions of men were out of the country
[25:33.120 --> 25:36.120]  Millions and millions more men and women were in the factories
[25:36.120 --> 25:38.120]  That was rationing
[25:39.120 --> 25:44.120]  People could barely afford milk and sugar and butter, it was all rationed
[25:45.120 --> 25:48.120]  No new cars were being made except for the military
[25:48.120 --> 25:52.120]  The economy was on hold other than the war effort
[25:54.120 --> 25:57.120]  And that's the last time a Christmas was this dead
[25:57.120 --> 25:59.120]  The sales, they're dead
[26:00.120 --> 26:06.120]  I mean I can tell you this, in the last year we've seen video and book sales go down massively
[26:07.120 --> 26:10.120]  To what they were five years ago
[26:10.120 --> 26:14.120]  You know it's gone all the way back to when this was a much smaller operation
[26:14.120 --> 26:18.120]  And I thought that was bad at infowars.com
[26:18.120 --> 26:20.120]  And you know the online video and book store
[26:21.120 --> 26:22.120]  But then
[26:24.120 --> 26:28.120]  In the last month or two it's even dropped below that
[26:28.120 --> 26:32.120]  And I'd say it's about half of what we were selling just three months ago
[26:33.120 --> 26:36.120]  Normally in the late summer early fall that's a dead time
[26:36.120 --> 26:40.120]  That was bumper crop for us and you know we need the money to operate
[26:40.120 --> 26:46.120]  We actually have 15 people working for me now, 15 people
[26:46.120 --> 26:49.120]  That doesn't sound like a lot for some but that's a lot for me
[26:49.120 --> 26:52.120]  That's a big nut to crack and you know it's all about the mission
[26:52.120 --> 26:57.120]  But I mean we're doing fine because we have President Planet.TV, we have advertisers, we have a lot of things we're doing
[26:57.120 --> 27:01.120]  The point is that this is really going to start compounding
[27:01.120 --> 27:05.120]  And imagine what it's like in other areas of the economy, other businesses, other systems
[27:05.120 --> 27:12.120]  Media is hard hit, radio, TV, newspapers, shutdowns, just things closing their doors
[27:12.120 --> 27:16.120]  Newspapers are trying to sell out right now, the awesome American statesman
[27:16.120 --> 27:18.120]  But not for sale for a year, can't find a buyer
[27:20.120 --> 27:24.120]  And it's not just the internet overtaking it, it's all being compounded by the economy
[27:26.120 --> 27:32.120]  So a lot is happening and into this gap comes the Chinese government
[27:32.120 --> 27:38.120]  That backed and funded and controls SAIC and Dong Fing
[27:38.120 --> 27:41.120]  The two big companies said to buy GM Chrysler assets
[27:41.120 --> 27:45.120]  This is all over the largest Chinese newspapers, government newspapers
[27:45.120 --> 27:48.120]  Under the sway of the global financial crisis, shouldn't use their term
[27:48.120 --> 27:53.120]  The globalist criminal consolidation by design, the economic warfare of the elite
[27:53.120 --> 27:57.120]  So under the sway of the global financial crisis, the globalist economic warfare
[27:57.120 --> 28:01.120]  The US auto giants, General Motors, Chrysler, LLC are tottering on the brink of collapse
[28:01.120 --> 28:05.120]  Japan's Toyota Motor was previously rumored to buy the mount
[28:05.120 --> 28:09.120]  But now Chinese car makers, SIC and Dong Fing
[28:09.120 --> 28:13.120]  Are also said to have plans to acquire the two US auto companies
[28:13.120 --> 28:18.120]  It reports the 21st century business herald today
[28:18.120 --> 28:21.120]  On November 15th, the senior official in China's Ministry of Industry
[28:21.120 --> 28:25.120]  And Information Technology and state regulator of China's auto industry
[28:25.120 --> 28:28.120]  Told reporters that the auto manufacturer giants in China
[28:28.120 --> 28:33.120]  Such as Shanghai Automotive Industry Cooperation or SAIC
[28:33.120 --> 28:38.120]  And Dong Fing Motor Corporation have the capability and innovation to buy
[28:38.120 --> 28:43.120]  The assets of the two crisis plagued American automakers
[28:43.120 --> 28:45.120]  Let's break down what's really happening here
[28:45.120 --> 28:48.120]  And what this is a larger part of when we get back
[28:48.120 --> 28:52.120]  Then Henry Paulson, he was the one threatening Marshall law
[28:52.120 --> 28:58.120]  According to Senator Innoff of Oklahoma
[28:58.120 --> 29:02.120]  We're on the march, the empires on the run
[29:02.120 --> 29:08.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:08.120 --> 29:11.120]  The holidays are right around the corner

[30:12.120 --> 30:17.120]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[30:17.120 --> 30:20.120]  It's known as the Builder Bird
[30:20.120 --> 30:23.120]  Is that their objective being world domination?
[30:23.120 --> 30:26.120]  For thousands of years their dark order grew
[30:26.120 --> 30:29.120]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[30:29.120 --> 30:34.120]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand
[30:34.120 --> 30:42.120]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open
[30:42.120 --> 30:46.120]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda
[30:46.120 --> 30:49.120]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government
[30:49.120 --> 30:52.120]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need

[31:39.120 --> 31:42.120]  The price of Survival Seed Bank has been drastically reduced

[31:48.120 --> 31:50.120]  And the supply is definitely limited

[32:33.120 --> 32:44.120]  Music
[32:44.120 --> 32:48.120]  So what does this mean that the Chinese automakers
[32:48.120 --> 32:50.120]  I know at the beginning of this is by accident
[32:50.120 --> 32:52.120]  This is all happening right now
[32:52.120 --> 32:57.120]  See the big foreign banks that leveraged the dollar
[32:57.120 --> 33:00.120]  That devalued the dollar while they bought real assets
[33:00.120 --> 33:11.120]  Created 1.5 or 1,500 trillion or 1.5 quadrillion dollars in fiat
[33:11.120 --> 33:15.120]  They went over and dumped hundreds of billions into Chinese automakers
[33:15.120 --> 33:19.120]  Hundreds of billions into third world countries all over the world
[33:19.120 --> 33:21.120]  To leverage out the United States
[33:21.120 --> 33:23.120]  It's a long-term strategic plan
[33:23.120 --> 33:25.120]  They handed over old military bases to the Chinese
[33:25.120 --> 33:29.120]  They handed over old US bases and British bases and French bases in Africa to the Chinese
[33:29.120 --> 33:33.120]  In Latin America, the Panama Canal in 2000
[33:33.120 --> 33:40.120]  The Long Beach port, the LA port, the Boston ports
[33:40.120 --> 33:42.120]  Just all of it, just everything
[33:42.120 --> 33:44.120]  Then 20-something ports
[33:44.120 --> 33:46.120]  They were going to hand over to the UAE
[33:46.120 --> 33:49.120]  People got upset about it so they had a holding company do it
[33:49.120 --> 33:51.120]  And UAE now runs it all
[33:51.120 --> 33:56.120]  The 83 interstate highways being handed over to foreign consortiums
[33:56.120 --> 34:01.120]  In Germany, in Spain, in Australia
[34:01.120 --> 34:06.120]  That's globalism, making sure you're totally controlled by outside systems
[34:06.120 --> 34:09.120]  Outside corporations
[34:09.120 --> 34:12.120]  And they have to get you in debt and destroy the economy
[34:12.120 --> 34:16.120]  So they can buy it up at fire sale prices
[34:16.120 --> 34:20.120]  And if you don't like it, militarized police have been trained to eat their own guts
[34:20.120 --> 34:21.120]  And ask for seconds
[34:21.120 --> 34:25.120]  Who are destroying their own futures while they go along with the system
[34:25.120 --> 34:28.120]  Squeezing and taxing and the bureaucrats
[34:28.120 --> 34:32.120]  And all the new assessments and taxes and property taxes
[34:32.120 --> 34:36.120]  All of that money that's put into the caffers
[34:36.120 --> 34:38.120]  The comprehensive annual financial reports
[34:38.120 --> 34:40.120]  60 plus percent of the money put in there
[34:40.120 --> 34:43.120]  All of that money is taken offshore
[34:43.120 --> 34:45.120]  And then it comes right back
[34:45.120 --> 34:46.120]  But that's not enough
[34:46.120 --> 34:51.120]  Americans then have to buy the cheap Chinese stuff
[34:51.120 --> 34:54.120]  Or the Japanese
[34:54.120 --> 34:56.120]  Because it's better
[34:56.120 --> 34:58.120]  In that case
[34:58.120 --> 34:59.120]  They have to
[34:59.120 --> 35:01.120]  Early on they could have demanded quality, but they didn't
[35:01.120 --> 35:04.120]  And American companies, strategically, by design, were already moving overseas
[35:04.120 --> 35:07.120]  So why make something good?
[35:07.120 --> 35:15.120]  And so now all those VCRs, all those DVD players, all those video games
[35:15.120 --> 35:23.120]  All those bobbles and ice chests and clothes that you bought from China
[35:23.120 --> 35:26.120]  Or Indonesia
[35:26.120 --> 35:27.120]  Or Mexico
[35:27.120 --> 35:33.120]  It's all coming back here to buy factories and roads
[35:33.120 --> 35:39.120]  And infrastructure and mines and timber
[35:39.120 --> 35:42.120]  And you're reading the LA Times
[35:42.120 --> 35:48.120]  That not only are the big two Chinese automakers basically government controlled
[35:48.120 --> 35:52.120]  They're going to the government saying, hey, cut the gas tax
[35:52.120 --> 35:54.120]  So we can sell more cars
[35:54.120 --> 35:58.120]  And give us big tax breaks and tax incentives
[35:58.120 --> 36:03.120]  And government money to build more factories here in China
[36:03.120 --> 36:06.120]  And over in the United States to buy them out
[36:06.120 --> 36:09.120]  You know what the government's saying? Absolutely
[36:09.120 --> 36:13.120]  You want 500 to something bill, go buy them up
[36:13.120 --> 36:16.120]  We want factories, we want infrastructure
[36:16.120 --> 36:20.120]  We want Ford and GM, we want Chrysler
[36:20.120 --> 36:22.120]  Chinese car makers also seek government aid
[36:22.120 --> 36:25.120]  Reporting from Shanghai, America's big three aren't the only car makers
[36:25.120 --> 36:29.120]  Turning to government with a hat in hand
[36:29.120 --> 36:33.120]  Hit by a dramatic slowdown in sales, Chinese auto executives are cutting production
[36:33.120 --> 36:39.120]  Shelving plans to export to the US and all of Detroit looking for Beijing for a little help
[36:39.120 --> 36:43.120]  Unlike the heads of General Motors Corps, Ford Motor Corps and Chrysler
[36:43.120 --> 36:47.120]  Who are in Washington this week pleading for 25 billion in aid, it's loans
[36:47.120 --> 36:50.120]  Chinese automakers generally aren't in dire financial straits
[36:50.120 --> 36:54.120]  Rather, they're begging for cash on loans Chinese managers say
[36:54.120 --> 36:58.120]  They're pushing for policy changes such as lower consumption taxes, pump prices
[36:58.120 --> 37:00.120]  That might help jumpstart sales
[37:00.120 --> 37:02.120]  And then it goes on for more money for factories and things like that
[37:02.120 --> 37:06.120]  So see, now let me explain something
[37:06.120 --> 37:09.120]  Do I like Ford and GM, you know, my whole life
[37:09.120 --> 37:14.120]  Well, I didn't buy that many over my life, I guess, but like three cars
[37:14.120 --> 37:17.120]  I didn't even try to buy used cars that were American
[37:17.120 --> 37:22.120]  But they constantly break, I mean, you buy a new car, it's broke down in a year
[37:22.120 --> 37:26.120]  Then I watched my parents driving, and my dad had learned this by the 80s
[37:26.120 --> 37:29.120]  He always bought Fords and Chevys, they always broke down
[37:29.120 --> 37:31.120]  So he sort of bought Japanese in the same car
[37:31.120 --> 37:34.120]  You almost forget to put oil in it, it just keeps running forever
[37:34.120 --> 37:36.120]  So I buy Japanese now
[37:36.120 --> 37:41.120]  Because Ford and Chevy and Chrysler, they're already globalists, they're already offshore
[37:41.120 --> 37:45.120]  They already have the majority of their parts made overseas
[37:49.120 --> 37:56.120]  But so to be clear here, it's not like I'm saying don't bail out or do bail out the automakers
[37:56.120 --> 37:59.120]  It's not like I'm saying it's a great thing to bail them out
[37:59.120 --> 38:06.120]  What I'm saying is $25 billion in loans to Chrysler and Chevy who are about to go bankrupt
[38:06.120 --> 38:13.120]  $25 billion, that's two or three B2 bombers
[38:13.120 --> 38:19.120]  That's not even one nuclear submarine, that's not even half of an aircraft carrier
[38:19.120 --> 38:21.120]  What are those things like?
[38:21.120 --> 38:26.120]  $60 billion, $70 billion, they got a new superclass coming out
[38:26.120 --> 38:35.120]  I mean, the defense contractors just got a $1 trillion on budget, $1 trillion
[38:35.120 --> 38:37.120]  It's going to be more, it always is with simple models
[38:37.120 --> 38:42.120]  Trillion plus dollar defense budget, the previous biggest one was $600 billion
[38:42.120 --> 38:50.120]  I mean, they're raping us like never before for all that junk and $500 hammers and $800 toilet seats
[38:50.120 --> 38:56.120]  And that course in the military controls the $500 billion a year in narcotics coming in, they laundered that
[38:56.120 --> 39:07.120]  It's the Army, mainly, the Navy and the CIA that laundered all that, so that's not enough for them
[39:07.120 --> 39:14.120]  But I mean, you guys are all going to have big houses in Maui and even your mercenaries and million dollars in the bank
[39:14.120 --> 39:18.120]  Even your minions, but everything's going to collapse around you and you're going to destroy your whole society
[39:18.120 --> 39:25.120]  But you don't care, you get up and thump your chest and like a gorilla and say, I don't care, we're going to dominate you
[39:25.120 --> 39:33.120]  Watch this, we're going to ship in the Yeho and the Schmack and your kids are going to use them, we're going to throw them in our prisons
[39:33.120 --> 39:39.120]  I mean, it is so sick
[39:39.120 --> 39:47.120]  Meanwhile, we're getting our lunch eaten and you have destroyed America and it is being consumed, absorbed by the New World Order
[39:47.120 --> 40:01.120]  Then strip-mind, just being looted, gang-raped, just like 150 years ago, the 10 European powers with the US went in and divided and raped China
[40:01.120 --> 40:05.120]  Go read about it, it comes around, goes around
[40:05.120 --> 40:16.120]  And there's all these well-meaning fools that salute the flag and wear their uniform and cry about the government and put their hand to their chest
[40:16.120 --> 40:19.120]  That doesn't exist anymore, Baba
[40:19.120 --> 40:24.120]  So you say, I don't want to hear that Alex Jones, he puts down America
[40:24.120 --> 40:27.120]  No, I tried to save America
[40:27.120 --> 40:33.120]  But as long as they stick an American flag on tyranny, you will salute it and do whatever it says
[40:33.120 --> 40:40.120]  See, they just can't believe it's all true, they're the schmucks, the suckers, the chumps
[40:40.120 --> 40:45.120]  They love being conned, they love the sappy propaganda, they love the delusion
[40:45.120 --> 40:49.120]  Okay, well you and your family are going to get hurt real bad and it didn't by me
[40:49.120 --> 40:53.120]  That you've been taught to hate so much and been taught to fear the patriot movement
[40:53.120 --> 40:59.120]  It's by your masters, you're sitting in their lap, but it ain't your mommy or your daddy
[40:59.120 --> 41:05.120]  It's a big, mean creature and it likes blood of societies
[41:07.120 --> 41:14.120]  Chinese car makers also seek government aid, so they're coming in and buying things up
[41:14.120 --> 41:19.120]  I'm going to go to your calls
[41:25.120 --> 41:28.120]  I'm going to go to your calls and then I'm going to get into Paulson
[41:30.120 --> 41:34.120]  Coming out and saying, hey, we're going to have martial law
[41:34.120 --> 41:37.120]  If you don't do this, that's now confirmed by Senator Inhofe
[41:37.120 --> 41:40.120]  Paulson was behind a bailout martial law threat
[41:40.120 --> 41:47.120]  But just in closing on the cars, it is a national security issue
[41:47.120 --> 41:52.120]  You see, national security is only used to destroy America, destroy the family
[41:52.120 --> 41:55.120]  Tax the middle class chumps out of existence
[41:55.120 --> 42:00.120]  It's only used to put sodium fluoride in the water and force vaccines on kids to give them autism
[42:00.120 --> 42:05.120]  It's only used to ram through GMO crops that kill most of the rats and getting pigs
[42:05.120 --> 42:07.120]  It's fed to and are killing us right now
[42:07.120 --> 42:11.120]  It's only used to carry out the narcotics trafficking
[42:11.120 --> 42:14.120]  The government controlled narcotics trafficking
[42:14.120 --> 42:17.120]  It's only there to protect their criminal activity
[42:17.120 --> 42:23.120]  Imagine, since 47, tens of trillions of dollars in secret operations
[42:23.120 --> 42:28.120]  Powerful men doing whatever they want with total anonymity and total power
[42:28.120 --> 42:31.120]  Gee, are you surprised we're going into total corruption?
[42:31.120 --> 42:33.120]  Total looting
[42:33.120 --> 42:34.120]  Because they can
[42:34.120 --> 42:39.120]  This is the final fruit of that
[42:39.120 --> 42:43.120]  But if we had real national security
[42:43.120 --> 42:51.120]  We'd say, you know what, we're not going to buy five B2 bombers for 100 billion bucks
[42:51.120 --> 42:56.120]  Plus, we're going to give 100 billion to the automakers
[42:56.120 --> 43:03.120]  Or we're going to give 100 billion to two new startup companies
[43:03.120 --> 43:06.120]  Or whoever will sign the contracts and do the deals to build it
[43:06.120 --> 43:08.120]  Now, obviously, that's not a free market
[43:08.120 --> 43:11.120]  Okay, but we don't have a free market
[43:11.120 --> 43:14.120]  I mean, if they're going to give five trillion dollars in five weeks to the bankers
[43:14.120 --> 43:16.120]  To go invest it in China
[43:16.120 --> 43:19.120]  And by the way, Kurt Nemo just sent me an article he just posted
[43:19.120 --> 43:22.120]  Bank of America by stake in China construction
[43:22.120 --> 43:24.120]  You see, that's in the news
[43:24.120 --> 43:26.120]  I see it every day, just buried
[43:26.120 --> 43:30.120]  Do you understand? They're taking the five trill
[43:30.120 --> 43:35.120]  And they're not just leveraging and buying other healthy banks and insurance companies in the US
[43:35.120 --> 43:41.120]  They're buying not just the roads and the ports
[43:41.120 --> 43:52.120]  They are taking your money and sending it to China to come back and buy Ford and Chevy and Chrysler
[43:52.120 --> 43:55.120]  Bank of America by stake in China construction
[43:55.120 --> 43:56.120]  Right there
[43:56.120 --> 43:57.120]  It's happening everywhere
[43:57.120 --> 44:00.120]  They are taking the five trillion and cornering the world market
[44:00.120 --> 44:03.120]  They depress the economy, they blow out the economy
[44:03.120 --> 44:04.120]  They badmouth it
[44:04.120 --> 44:07.120]  They say we're going to have a depression, the government destroys confidence
[44:07.120 --> 44:09.120]  They knew when they settled it would destroy confidence
[44:09.120 --> 44:13.120]  The economy dies, everybody gets scared and stops buying
[44:13.120 --> 44:17.120]  The economy is basically a zombie right now
[44:17.120 --> 44:22.120]  The blood ain't flowing
[44:22.120 --> 44:24.120]  And then they come in and buy it all up
[44:24.120 --> 44:26.120]  I mean, it's so simple
[44:26.120 --> 44:28.120]  So it's a national security issue
[44:28.120 --> 44:32.120]  And because it is a real national security issue, they're not going to save them
[44:32.120 --> 44:35.120]  The government isn't the government
[44:35.120 --> 44:39.120]  It's a giant garbage disposal chopping the country up
[44:39.120 --> 44:40.120]  You understand?
[44:40.120 --> 44:43.120]  So go ahead and watch your SWAT team cop shows cops and feel powerful
[44:43.120 --> 44:47.120]  And go ahead, FBI, feel powerful and train to confiscate our guns
[44:47.120 --> 44:49.120]  Go ahead and do everything you do, because it's all going to collapse
[44:49.120 --> 44:51.120]  You're not going to have jobs
[44:51.120 --> 44:54.120]  When they're done with this, we're going to be a giant third world cesspool
[44:54.120 --> 44:57.120]  And the cops are going to be in giant gun fights with criminal gangs
[44:57.120 --> 45:01.120]  Because once societies go banana republic, like Argentina has already done
[45:01.120 --> 45:03.120]  Or Brazil or Mexico
[45:03.120 --> 45:06.120]  Once it happens, the gangs don't respect you anymore
[45:06.120 --> 45:09.120]  They're going to move in and take over
[45:09.120 --> 45:12.120]  And the cops are going to hide out in their police stations
[45:12.120 --> 45:16.120]  I mean, there have been days in Brazil where a hundred and something cops get killed
[45:16.120 --> 45:20.120]  There's days in Mexico where twenty or thirty get killed
[45:20.120 --> 45:23.120]  You have destroyed yourselves, you have destroyed your country
[45:23.120 --> 45:27.120]  So go ahead, pull over somebody with a smart mouth, you beat the beat them up, knock their teeth out
[45:27.120 --> 45:30.120]  And you won't get in trouble, because tyranny rules
[45:30.120 --> 45:34.120]  But remember, the bankers aren't going to get in trouble taking everything you got
[45:34.120 --> 45:36.120]  You just remember that too
[45:36.120 --> 45:38.120]  That's how evil works
[45:38.120 --> 45:41.120]  It races through a country like cancer
[45:45.120 --> 45:48.120]  Okay, let's go to some calls
[45:48.120 --> 45:54.120]  Alright, the caller from Pennsylvania, Marteros, hung up
[45:54.120 --> 45:57.120]  So we'll go to David in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead David
[46:00.120 --> 46:02.120]  Come ahead David
[46:02.120 --> 46:06.120]  I don't understand why the callers never come to the line, it's a little weird
[46:06.120 --> 46:08.120]  Alright David, thanks for the call
[46:08.120 --> 46:10.120]  Garrett in Mississippi, you're on the air
[46:10.120 --> 46:12.120]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[46:12.120 --> 46:13.120]  Good
[46:13.120 --> 46:18.120]  Well, you're right about that, the blood's fixing the flow
[46:18.120 --> 46:23.120]  And I wrote up something this morning for my friends about Christmas shopping
[46:23.120 --> 46:29.120]  And they should think outside the box for a purchase in Christmas gifts this year
[46:29.120 --> 46:37.120]  And I for one am going to go through your store and get a water filter for my in-laws
[46:37.120 --> 46:41.120]  Just things like that, you know, a multi-tool
[46:41.120 --> 46:46.120]  Some rugged outdoor clothing like some car harts or something like that
[46:46.120 --> 46:49.120]  Besides you're going to use that, you never use all the other junk people give you
[46:49.120 --> 46:56.120]  Yeah, I've asked just for, you know, things of this sort that I need to fill my gaps
[46:56.120 --> 47:00.120]  But I also wanted to give you a gun show report
[47:00.120 --> 47:06.120]  I was in Jackson, Mississippi this past weekend at the show and it was a madhouse
[47:06.120 --> 47:09.120]  It took 30 minutes just to get in
[47:09.120 --> 47:14.120]  The firearms that are slated to be banned very soon
[47:14.120 --> 47:19.120]  We're running $200 to $300 above what they cost five weeks ago
[47:19.120 --> 47:21.120]  When the last show come through
[47:21.120 --> 47:26.120]  They are 15s, M1s, Grans, everything's semi-autom
[47:26.120 --> 47:30.120]  Everything was $200 to $300 or more than what it should have been
[47:30.120 --> 47:36.120]  So I'll caution people, this is some tips I give for Christmas shopping
[47:36.120 --> 47:41.120]  Go to the internet and save some gas, a lot of stuff is free shipping
[47:41.120 --> 47:46.120]  Don't buy gift cards, because I've got a story circulating today
[47:46.120 --> 47:49.120]  I don't know if it's absolutely true or not, but it makes sense
[47:49.120 --> 47:53.120]  If these companies go bankrupt or shut their stores down, how are you going to use gift cards?
[47:53.120 --> 47:56.120]  No, that's already happening everywhere, like linens and things
[47:56.120 --> 47:59.120]  I saw a report about, you know, they're closing all their stores
[47:59.120 --> 48:02.120]  I mean, it's hundreds of chains are going under
[48:02.120 --> 48:05.120]  Or vastly reducing stock
[48:05.120 --> 48:10.120]  And again, this was all publicly done when the President and Obama
[48:10.120 --> 48:13.120]  During the campaign and the Treasury Secretary and the Fed Chairman
[48:13.120 --> 48:15.120]  All said we're going to have a depression
[48:15.120 --> 48:17.120]  That was it, they killed us right there
[48:17.120 --> 48:22.120]  Yeah, and another thing too, what I'm doing is there's some things that
[48:22.120 --> 48:27.120]  I mean, when you're into the Patriot Movement or preparedness, it never ends
[48:27.120 --> 48:29.120]  And that's what scares a lot of people away
[48:29.120 --> 48:34.120]  It's a lot of investment, but it's buying insurance for your future security
[48:34.120 --> 48:42.120]  There's calculators out on the web where you can calculate your tax refund
[48:42.120 --> 48:45.120]  That's a little bit the government dribbles back to you
[48:45.120 --> 48:51.120]  And if you have a credit card, if you still have credit, use it to get what you need now
[48:51.120 --> 48:57.120]  And then, you know, use your tax refund in February to pay off those debts
[48:57.120 --> 49:00.120]  I hate to tell people to go out and max out credit cards
[49:00.120 --> 49:06.120]  I hate to do that too, but guess what? There's not going to be any bill collectors when this comes around
[49:06.120 --> 49:09.120]  Well, there's a good chance that could be the case
[49:09.120 --> 49:12.120]  But the bottom line is they're going to come after the little guys for debts
[49:12.120 --> 49:14.120]  But the big guys can do whatever they want
[49:14.120 --> 49:18.120]  I mean, if you're going to steal folks, the moral is shoot for the moon
[49:18.120 --> 49:23.120]  Yeah, well, I just encourage everybody, Alex, to get prepared
[49:23.120 --> 49:28.120]  This is the same game time, you know, it'll reference in your movie as you put out
[49:28.120 --> 49:31.120]  The locals in your area, Garrett and Mr. Simpsons, are they starting to wake up?
[49:31.120 --> 49:32.120]  Oh, yeah
[49:32.120 --> 49:37.120]  When I started working at this major company three years ago, tomorrow
[49:37.120 --> 49:43.120]  People thought while I was nuts when I started telling them about 9-11 road deteriorating and different things like that
[49:43.120 --> 49:47.120]  You know, this guy's a head case
[49:47.120 --> 49:52.120]  Now, you know, I've kind of moved up in the office society and I have an office
[49:52.120 --> 49:56.120]  And people come in and shut the door and ask what they need to do, you know
[49:56.120 --> 49:59.120]  Because you told them beforehand, great to hear from you, we're out of time
[49:59.120 --> 50:04.120]  More calls straight ahead, David, Bob, Robert, Bruce, stay with us
[50:04.120 --> 50:08.120]  Bruce disagrees with me, we'll go to him first, stay with me
[50:08.120 --> 50:13.120]  With food prices soaring to all time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value
[50:13.120 --> 50:19.120]  What can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[50:19.120 --> 50:20.120]  Garden in a can
[50:20.120 --> 50:24.120]  Garden in a can is your source for premium long-term storable seeds
[50:24.120 --> 50:29.120]  Garden in a can is ready when you are, plant them now or store them for when you really need them
[50:29.120 --> 50:34.120]  There are 16 large hermetically sealed non-hybrid open pollinated packets of seeds
[50:34.120 --> 50:39.120]  Along with detailed planting instructions sealed in a can for ultimate long-term protection
[50:39.120 --> 50:44.120]  Garden in a can, it's that simple, fresh, healthy, easy

[51:07.120 --> 51:14.120]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country
[51:14.120 --> 51:18.120]  The enemies struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[51:18.120 --> 51:20.120]  Ben Laden. This is his MO.
[51:20.120 --> 51:23.120]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Ben Laden
[51:23.120 --> 51:30.120]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States
[51:30.120 --> 51:37.120]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[51:37.120 --> 51:41.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[51:41.120 --> 51:48.120]  Ben Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network
[51:48.120 --> 51:52.120]  Warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much much more, fabled enemies

[52:00.120 --> 52:07.120]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
[52:07.120 --> 52:16.120]  Imagine feeling totally helpless. Imagine thinking and hearing clearly, but unable to move as the ground rises to meet you
[52:16.120 --> 52:26.120]  Imagine the pain of a thousand needles as your body is invaded, locked, and hammered by 50,000 volts of the latest in Taser technology
[52:26.120 --> 52:34.120]  If this sounds scary, imagine how it would feel for anyone attempting to victimize a friend, loved one, or even yourself

[53:29.120 --> 53:37.120]  Fortrestactical.com is not my sponsor. I wish they were. It's a Genesis sponsor
[53:37.120 --> 53:50.120]  You got the wrong show. You're confused. I don't blame a Taser. I don't blame a 357 Magnum. I don't blame a Samurai sword for murder or mayhem or crime
[53:50.120 --> 54:01.120]  I'm not against the police having tasers, but they should only use them when they truly are under threat
[54:01.120 --> 54:09.120]  And it should be, you know, when somebody takes a swing at you, you know, where you don't in that threat continuum and want to shoot them, or when somebody's attacking somebody and won't get off of them
[54:09.120 --> 54:17.120]  And then you taser them one time, but instead the cops are mentally ill, at least the ones we see on video, where they taser some guy on the ground for an hour
[54:17.120 --> 54:23.120]  I mean, I've seen videos where they just taser the guy for no reason. He's on the ground. They keep tasering him. That's in road to tyranny
[54:23.120 --> 54:32.120]  Then they let the dog bite him. All those cops should have gone to prison. The guy never did anything. They got out. They tasered him because they got buck fever. They want to shoot something
[54:32.120 --> 54:38.120]  They want to, so it allows cops that are trigger happy who want to kill people to go ahead and do something less lethal
[54:38.120 --> 54:47.120]  But it'll kill you. It's killed over 400 people now. So I'm against the misuse of it. I am absolutely for citizens having tasers
[54:47.120 --> 54:54.120]  In fact, I've thought about, I don't want my wife carrying a gun around her purse because I got little kids and they've been taught not to be around guns and they're locked up
[54:54.120 --> 55:02.120]  But kids come over to the house and I just, you know, I want to keep them out of reach, but what about a taser?
[55:02.120 --> 55:09.120]  I know she's got, you know, some pepper spray in her car and we don't live in fear, so we don't really keep that stuff on us. We should
[55:09.120 --> 55:16.120]  We should be living in some fear. Fear is meant to make you take action. You know, like you're leaning over a cliff. Hey, get back
[55:16.120 --> 55:24.120]  But just to be clear, I think everybody needs a taser. We need more weapons. The citizens do
[55:24.120 --> 55:34.120]  So, yeah, this isn't a gun control show folks. We believe in self-defense. And, you know, if somebody takes a swing at a cop, it's better than them gunning them down
[55:34.120 --> 55:42.120]  Better for them to take a belly club to them or taser them. Not just be such cowards where they pull the gun and shoot them, you know, because the person pulls away from them
[55:42.120 --> 55:49.120]  I've seen videos of a person pulls their arm out of a cop's grasp and so the cop shoots them. That's horrible
[55:49.120 --> 56:01.120]  You know, taser them. That's what that is for, but it's being misused. Okay, Bruce in Connecticut disagrees on auto industry. Go ahead
[56:01.120 --> 56:13.120]  Hi, Alex. Good. Yeah, this is with respect to the auto industry comment. I agree that cars are designed to have engineered obsolescence
[56:13.120 --> 56:20.120]  I mean, but I think that's across the board, you know, because I've seen a lot of problems with foreign or domestic, you know, it's just a
[56:20.120 --> 56:28.120]  Japanese are not as good as they were 10 years ago in my experience and mechanics I talked to and as soon as Ford and GM and Chevy go out
[56:28.120 --> 56:39.120]  Ford, Ford, GM, Chevy, and of course Chrysler, Ford and GM, I mean, GM and Chevy, same thing. Then, of course, the Japanese will become crud, but go ahead
[56:39.120 --> 56:49.120]  Yeah, but I've had Ford now since later nineties and I've never really had a problem with them. You know, they run good, I get over 100,000 miles
[56:49.120 --> 56:52.120]  and I'm getting a lot of mileage for the dollar
[56:52.120 --> 56:58.120]  Well, my friend, I'm glad that that's been your experience. It's not been my experience
[56:58.120 --> 57:10.120]  I'm sorry to hear that. And I agree with you on the other comment about self defense. I agree 100%. It's just too bad. Please don't use a discretion like they used to, you know
[57:10.120 --> 57:17.120]  Well, cars were more macho and they were never perfect. I mean, the industry itself has always had problems for thousands of years.
[57:17.120 --> 57:28.120]  That's very nature. It's power corrupts absolutely, power corrupts absolutely. But yeah, I mean, cops were too macho to, you know, wet themselves and shoot somebody because they, you know, made a fist at them
[57:28.120 --> 57:35.120]  Now, I mean, I see cops pulling old ladies over and it's like they're shaking, walk them to the car. It's just the wicked fleas when none pursue it
[57:35.120 --> 57:43.120]  And the cops ought to be scared of those cars flying past them. Statistically, that's what they really should be afraid of, but see, nobody tells them to be afraid of that, so they're not
[57:43.120 --> 57:48.120]  Alright, we'll come back, take more calls and get our guests on.
[58:13.120 --> 58:16.120]  David Rockefeller that for a lateral commission to see a car
[58:18.120 --> 58:25.120]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of just criticism to grow at our own door
[58:25.120 --> 58:31.120]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place
[58:31.120 --> 58:35.120]  An inside job? How dare you?
[58:35.120 --> 58:41.120]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself
[58:41.120 --> 58:44.120]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue
[58:44.120 --> 58:49.120]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of November 11
[58:49.120 --> 58:53.120]  Truth rise, download the film at PrismPlanet.tv right now
[58:53.120 --> 58:55.120]  Or get the DVD at infowars.com
[58:55.120 --> 58:58.120]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level
[58:58.120 --> 59:08.120]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[59:29.120 --> 59:36.120]  We've got two of the leading JFK researchers with the 45th anniversary coming up this weekend
[59:36.120 --> 59:43.120]  Joining us in the next hour, then continue on open phones and all this other important world news like
[59:43.120 --> 59:50.120]  Senator Inhofe identifying who threatened the Congress with martial law five weeks ago to pass the bailout
[59:50.120 --> 59:52.120]  Now almost six weeks ago
[59:52.120 --> 59:57.120]  Right now, let's go to Sun in Chicago, a first time caller, go ahead Sun
[59:57.120 --> 59:58.120]  Hi Alex
[59:58.120 --> 59:59.120]  Hi
[59:59.120 --> 1:00:00.120]  How are you?
[1:00:00.120 --> 1:00:04.120]  Pretty good, other than watching my country be consolidated by a bunch of crooks
[1:00:04.120 --> 1:00:11.120]  Alex, I apologize, this doesn't necessarily have to do with anything in particular
[1:00:11.120 --> 1:00:12.120]  There's no topic to...
[1:00:12.120 --> 1:00:20.120]  Okay, I am a new listener, I've just started listening to you in the last two, three weeks
[1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:28.120]  And well, I'm sort of coming out of the grieving process, if you will
[1:00:28.120 --> 1:00:36.120]  In terms of, I guess, realizing a lot of the things that, as everybody else has been told
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:40.120]  And finding out that much of it is false
[1:00:40.120 --> 1:00:46.120]  And it sort of gives you a sense of not being attached to something
[1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:54.120]  But having said that, there's an awful lot of information that you guys have been sharing with us
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:59.120]  And having said that, I started talking with other people
[1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:04.120]  But naturally, there seems to be some obvious resistance
[1:01:04.120 --> 1:01:14.120]  And I guess what I'm trying to find out is, is there a site or a resource where a person or a group
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:20.120]  You know, regional places where people can meet
[1:01:20.120 --> 1:01:27.120]  Or communities where they can talk and interact and share ideas and so on
[1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:35.120]  You've always got to beware, and by that, just be dubious
[1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:40.120]  Don't be trusting, because of the nature of the web, but you can find great people
[1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:46.120]  There are the Ron Paul meetups around the country, there are a lot of other organizations
[1:01:46.120 --> 1:01:50.120]  They're going to have the in the fed group, going out and protesting the fed
[1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:56.120]  Coming up, that's going to be in Chicago as well, where you live in 38 other locations
[1:01:56.120 --> 1:02:00.120]  Or 37 other locations around the country
[1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:04.120]  There are 9-11 truth groups in every major city
[1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:09.120]  There are all sorts of organizations and groups where you can meet like-minded people
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:13.120]  And then go to a group setting and find out who you'd like to work with
[1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:16.120]  Or who you'd like to be involved with, it's kind of like looking for a church
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:18.120]  I mean, you've got to go and check them out
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:22.120]  Okay, all right, fair enough, thank you
[1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:25.120]  Hey, thank you, good to hear from you, son, appreciate it
[1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:28.120]  Dave in Wisconsin, you're on the air, David
[1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:30.120]  Alex
[1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:32.120]  Hi
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:38.120]  Okay, is it true when I looked on the internet that oil is $50 a barrel now?
[1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:40.120]  Yeah, I think it's below 50
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:44.120]  Yeah, it's below, Lindsay Williams is reliable, obviously
[1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:47.120]  Well, he really did work for Atlantic Ridgefield
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:56.120]  Well, yeah, I'm old enough where I read that book in the 70s, and it's so weird how it goes around
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:02:59.120]  Comes around again, you know, you weren't even alive or whatever
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:02.120]  And now you're talking about that and everything
[1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:09.120]  And I just wanted to tell you that now is the time for everybody to just go out to their neighbors
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:15.120]  And their family and stuff and say the things that they've learned from you and others
[1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:19.120]  And they'll be credible because it's all coming true
[1:03:19.120 --> 1:03:23.120]  And their credibility is going to go sky high right now
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:25.120]  Now is the time to go public
[1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:26.120]  I agree
[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:29.120]  And then there's one more thing, just for you personally
[1:03:29.120 --> 1:03:37.120]  It's to stay pure, you know, and be in the power of God like you are
[1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:40.120]  You know, there's other Christians that talk a bunch of nonsense, you know
[1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:45.120]  But like, we're not supposed to stand up for human rights and the things that you do
[1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:48.120]  But stay pure and the power will flow
[1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:51.120]  The evil guys who are superiors and all that
[1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:57.120]  Yes, we're going to reap something that they sow but we're going to stand
[1:03:57.120 --> 1:04:03.120]  Isn't it better to die than to stand up or live in that control world?
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:29.120]  Absolutely, absolutely, God bless you my friend
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:38.120]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air
[1:04:38.120 --> 1:04:41.120]  This money now owns the American and European banks
[1:04:41.120 --> 1:04:45.120]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing
[1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:50.120]  And blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond many Americans' reach
[1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:55.120]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:57.120]  Until it reached over 4 billion marks
[1:04:57.120 --> 1:05:02.120]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight
[1:05:02.120 --> 1:05:07.120]  The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves
[1:05:07.120 --> 1:05:11.120]  The stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business
[1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:14.120]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready
[1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:16.120]  Everything is zeroing in on food
[1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:20.120]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities
[1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:24.120]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food
[1:05:24.120 --> 1:05:29.120]  And for everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food
[1:05:29.120 --> 1:05:32.120]  The government, the new-old order, has a lot less control over you
[1:05:32.120 --> 1:05:36.120]  And so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[1:05:36.120 --> 1:05:39.120]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:46.120]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports
[1:05:46.120 --> 1:05:49.120]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices

[1:06:15.120 --> 1:06:22.120]  leursishes
[1:06:22.120 --> 1:06:23.120]  Big brother
[1:06:23.120 --> 1:06:24.120]  mainstream media
[1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:26.120]  Government coverups
[1:06:26.120 --> 1:06:30.120]  You want answers?
[1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:31.120]  Well so does he
[1:06:31.120 --> 1:06:35.120]  He's Alex Jones
[1:06:35.120 --> 1:06:36.120]  on the GCN Radio Network
[1:06:36.120 --> 1:06:39.120]  and now, live from Austin, Texas
[1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:41.120]  Alex Jones
[1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:47.360]  on separately, but never had them on together, so for this hour and a little bit of the next
[1:06:47.360 --> 1:06:52.960]  I thought we'd have them on together, kind of like we had Professor David Ray Griffin
[1:06:52.960 --> 1:06:58.840]  and Professor Stephen Jones on together yesterday, and we will continue with your phone calls
[1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:03.400]  and a host of issues because both of these men can speak to them, but it is the 45th
[1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:14.360]  anniversary of the shadow government, the COG killing Robert F. Kennedy in Dealey Plaza.
[1:07:14.360 --> 1:07:19.800]  That's coming up in just a few days, and Robert Groden and Jim Mars will both be there.
[1:07:19.800 --> 1:07:24.760]  Jim has a cold, but he's still doing the show today and he's having a bad connection on
[1:07:24.760 --> 1:07:30.520]  his phone line, so we're bringing him up here in just a few minutes, but so much is happening
[1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:32.320]  for the 45th anniversary.
[1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:36.080]  There's all these different hit pieces on Discovery Channel, History Channel coming
[1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:39.160]  out that are really becoming comical.
[1:07:39.160 --> 1:07:46.120]  Robert Groden and Jim Mars, I can't think of two people more prominent than these two
[1:07:46.120 --> 1:07:51.560]  men when it comes to the JFK investigation movement.
[1:07:51.560 --> 1:07:57.200]  People that have brought four more information, done more research and investigated as long,
[1:07:57.200 --> 1:08:05.080]  and intimately involved with the case itself than Robert Groden and Jim Mars.
[1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:09.720]  I mean, Robert Groden brought out the Subruder film and a bunch of other key information.
[1:08:09.720 --> 1:08:10.720]  The list goes on and on.
[1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:14.120]  So, bringing up Robert Groden, I look forward to seeing him up there this weekend at the
[1:08:14.120 --> 1:08:17.360]  grassy knoll, and we're going to stay over Monday and interview him there, so we'll be
[1:08:17.360 --> 1:08:21.200]  rebroadcast on Monday for the JFK film we're making.
[1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:23.040]  Mr. Groden, good to have you on with us.
[1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:24.600]  Great to be on, Alex.
[1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:25.600]  Thank you.
[1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:27.440]  Did you have a good experience last time you were on?
[1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:29.440]  Have a big response?
[1:08:29.440 --> 1:08:30.440]  Absolutely.
[1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:37.560]  You have a good listenership and they're open-minded and they understand that it's excellent.
[1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:40.440]  I meant to ask you this when we first got you online, but I didn't have a chance to
[1:08:40.440 --> 1:08:41.440]  talk to you.
[1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:48.000]  Did you see the inside the shooter car program put out by this Erickson fellow?
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.560]  What a total phony that whole show was.
[1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:55.560]  I was actually there in the plaza when they were filming it, and they were making so many
[1:08:55.560 --> 1:08:56.560]  mistakes.
[1:08:56.560 --> 1:09:01.040]  I went up to them and I told them, I pointed out, showed them the photographs of the at
[1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:03.840]  the angles and positions all wrong.
[1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:04.840]  They wouldn't listen to me.
[1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:05.840]  They said, oh, it's not important.
[1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:06.840]  It doesn't matter.
[1:09:06.840 --> 1:09:09.280]  Of course it matters.
[1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:14.320]  Well, yeah, with forensics, that's what jumped out at me is they said that if they would
[1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:18.440]  have fired from the knoll, it would have gone through Kennedy's head on the side and
[1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:24.440]  hit Jackie, but the knoll was firing diagonally more from the front.
[1:09:24.440 --> 1:09:26.560]  I mean, they were way off there.
[1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:31.000]  Also, they acted like all the Secret Service testimony about the car, which they grabbed,
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.040]  hid, tore out, refurbished, acted completely guilty.
[1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:39.000]  All that's based on fraud, specifically because you're one of the leading experts on this.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:40.360]  We're going to talk to Mars in a moment.
[1:09:40.360 --> 1:09:44.360]  Now, since you've seen the program, I refuse to be interviewed by him, by the way, for
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:51.680]  a 9-11 truth film he's making because what his specialty is, is doing quack scientific
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:59.520]  reenactments to try to flim flam the public along the CSI line.
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:03.320]  But there were hundreds of comments within minutes of the show ending on the Discovery
[1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:08.720]  Channel website, and literally 97% of them, it was over 100 comments I saw, and three
[1:10:08.720 --> 1:10:11.120]  of them were agreeing with the show.
[1:10:11.120 --> 1:10:13.320]  People were like, this is so unsighted.
[1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:19.000]  I never really thought that it was more than a lone gunman, but now I do.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  You're covering up.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:25.320]  It was so obvious, so Robert Gruden break down inside the shooter car.
[1:10:25.320 --> 1:10:32.520]  Well, the whole thing was a fraud to begin with, but you just mentioned about Jackie
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:36.040]  would have been hit based on what they showed.
[1:10:36.040 --> 1:10:40.920]  First of all, they had the bullet hit nearly four inches too far to the front from where
[1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:44.320]  it actually did hit, number one.
[1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:49.440]  They had the president's head angled about 30 degrees too far.
[1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:54.080]  If you were looking at it from the top, from up above, it was leaning over, it was leaning
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:55.080]  way forward.
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:11:01.080]  Yeah, it was way too far forward, but they also had Jackie sitting too far back.
[1:11:01.080 --> 1:11:04.160]  The actors playing Jackie, they had everything wrong.
[1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:05.160]  Nothing was right.
[1:11:05.160 --> 1:11:09.360]  But then again, considering they've done three other shows in the past that were even just
[1:11:09.360 --> 1:11:16.240]  as dishonest as this, perhaps even more so, it's not surprising.
[1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:23.240]  Well go over the car, because they ran off and refurbished that and hid that and there
[1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:26.720]  were reports of bullet holes all over it, the windshield.
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:30.600]  Right, absolutely.
[1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:35.320]  One thing that they said, one line that they used in the show is a shot would have had to
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:39.120]  go through the windshield and we know that didn't happen, but we don't know that it didn't
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:40.120]  happen.
[1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:42.920]  There's a half a dozen witnesses that said it did happen.
[1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:48.320]  One person actually stuck a pencil through the hole itself.
[1:11:48.320 --> 1:11:53.320]  So there's just lots and lots of problems with it, grossly dishonest, and this is basically
[1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:55.840]  an Empire Strikes Back type situation.
[1:11:55.840 --> 1:12:02.000]  It's the government through these idiots trying to convince us of another lie.
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:09.280]  Well let's go over the car, what they did with the President's limousine.
[1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:13.800]  Well yeah, as soon as the car was in Parkland Hospital, the Secret Service gave orders
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:16.200]  to swab out the car.
[1:12:16.200 --> 1:12:19.880]  They got a bucket, they got sponges, and they were cleaning out the car, destroying the
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:20.880]  crime scene.
[1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:23.000]  And they even admit that on the TV show.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:28.640]  Yeah, but it didn't seem to bother them.
[1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:36.080]  They take the testimony of two witnesses that saw some of the evidence, but not all of it,
[1:12:36.080 --> 1:12:39.320]  and they only deal with the stuff that makes them happy.
[1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:41.960]  It's exactly what the Warren Commission did.
[1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:46.440]  Well, the whole way they took the Chrysler back to the factory, the way they refurbished
[1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:51.080]  it in a week, the way they were so secretive about that, I mean right there is the guilt.
[1:12:51.080 --> 1:12:58.000]  Going to Jim Mars, Jim, when I called you Sunday night with my mouth hanging open halfway
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.680]  through the TV show, I said, are you watching this?
[1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:04.280]  You said, no, I'm taping and I'm watching the cowboys get their butt kicked.
[1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:09.880]  Have you had a chance to see inside the shooter car produced by Laurel and Hardy?
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:15.120]  Yes, I haven't, and it's just as bad as I thought it was going to be, and that's why
[1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:20.600]  I didn't even bother to watch it, because I have, through my own personal experience,
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:25.520]  having co-produced a program for Discovery, and having dealt with several producers who
[1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:27.840]  have tried to sell programs to Discovery.
[1:13:27.840 --> 1:13:33.480]  I hate to say this, but there's so many people who think that if it's on the Discovery Channel,
[1:13:33.480 --> 1:13:37.960]  it must be right, and yet I'm here to tell you when it comes to kidney assassination,
[1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:43.720]  when it comes to UFOs, when it comes to other strange things, the Discovery Channel will
[1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:46.760]  not run the truth.
[1:13:46.760 --> 1:13:53.360]  Their attitude is, for example, on UFOs, we'll buy a program from you if you ridicule people
[1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:55.360]  who see UFOs.
[1:13:55.360 --> 1:14:01.000]  The kidney assassination will buy a program from you if you'll support the Warren Commission.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.160]  That's basically their attitude.
[1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:12.120]  And this show was just, well, it's so ludicrous, and as Robert has said, nothing they did was
[1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:20.000]  correct, but the main thing is, and without getting into technicalities, they built this
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:25.680]  wooden frame and put some seats in it and said, this represents the car, and they said,
[1:14:25.680 --> 1:14:31.240]  we've got these dummies and we've got this jello for brains, and we're going to take
[1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:38.640]  a shot, and we're going to see if this doesn't prove Oswald did it, and they said everything
[1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:48.080]  is exactly the way it was in November of 1963, except we're going to use a modern telescopic
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:49.640]  sight for accuracy.
[1:14:49.640 --> 1:14:52.520]  Well, that blows the whole thing.
[1:14:52.520 --> 1:14:55.480]  Oswald didn't have a telescopic sight for accuracy.
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:15:01.120]  He had a cheap 12-point sight, and he was not shooting in a stationary target.
[1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:05.920]  He was shooting at a target moving laterally downhill away from him with a tree intervening
[1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:12.520]  in the line of sight, and yet we're told he hit twice out of three shots within six seconds.
[1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:13.680]  It's just ludicrous.
[1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:19.160]  Well, Jim, and they also kept saying, we have conclusively proven it was Oswald from the
[1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:22.280]  school book, a depository building.
[1:15:22.280 --> 1:15:23.880]  He did it, and we have proven it.
[1:15:23.880 --> 1:15:24.880]  It's incredible.
[1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:26.440]  This is the greatest discovery ever.
[1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:27.440]  We're geniuses.
[1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:28.920]  It didn't prove anything.
[1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:33.640]  Well, while they keep talking about their sharpshooter, absolutely, why couldn't he
[1:15:33.640 --> 1:15:38.160]  make the shot with the piece of junk, a little five-and-dime scope?
[1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:39.760]  Well, here's the thing.
[1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:40.760]  Here's the thing.
[1:15:40.760 --> 1:15:47.320]  Their shooter was shooting from a crane that pushed him up there approximately six floors.
[1:15:47.320 --> 1:15:49.760]  He had all the time in the world to take a shot.
[1:15:49.760 --> 1:15:53.120]  I'm sure they probably did it several times.
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:59.840]  His rifle is braced, and he's using a modern, accurate scope, and he's shooting at a stationary
[1:15:59.840 --> 1:16:00.840]  target.
[1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:08.600]  Hey, I could make that shot, but the point is, is that just because they can set up everything
[1:16:08.600 --> 1:16:15.080]  and take all day to do it and make a shot that hits the side of the dummy's head, that
[1:16:15.080 --> 1:16:16.320]  was that proof.
[1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:18.360]  That just proves they could do that.
[1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:23.240]  It doesn't mean Oswald made two hits out of three shots in six seconds.
[1:16:23.240 --> 1:16:26.720]  What about what Robert Groden just brought up?
[1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:31.880]  I mean, I'm no master poo ball like you guys that know every inch of this thing and study
[1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:38.280]  it continually, but I mean, I'd been at the knoll many times, and I knew that the grassy
[1:16:38.280 --> 1:16:43.080]  knoll shot was coming more from the front than it was from the side, but they say in
[1:16:43.080 --> 1:16:47.640]  the show the guy was basically straight on at the side and then would have blown Jackie's
[1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:48.640]  head off.
[1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:49.760]  I mean, that is just ridiculous.
[1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:56.280]  No, it is ridiculous, and it does not even match the known medical evidence, which was
[1:16:56.280 --> 1:17:02.720]  apparently, and by all of the best evidence, Kennedy was struck in the right temple area
[1:17:02.720 --> 1:17:09.240]  in the hairline as he was leaning to the left with his chin down, which then took out the
[1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:12.440]  right rear portion of his head.
[1:17:12.440 --> 1:17:17.560]  Every doctor at Parkland said he had a huge gaping exit when Robert Groden was in the
[1:17:17.560 --> 1:17:18.560]  rear portion of his head.
[1:17:18.560 --> 1:17:21.520]  Robert Groden is new book, and I think he should put it out even quicker.
[1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:23.360]  I've seen the photos, folks.
[1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:26.080]  You know, Groden gets out with the subruggery, gets out with these.
[1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:27.080]  He's got the sources.
[1:17:27.080 --> 1:17:32.520]  I mean, the whole backside of his head's blown off, and it's clearly he's been shot in the
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:34.040]  front of the head, Robert.
[1:17:34.040 --> 1:17:35.040]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:17:35.040 --> 1:17:39.600]  Shot from the front, no question about it, but one thing I've got to say, and everyone
[1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:45.240]  seems to be walking on eggshells with this one here, and I'll mention it.
[1:17:45.240 --> 1:17:48.680]  I know that you would, I know you'd have no objection to this.
[1:17:48.680 --> 1:17:57.360]  The man who the producers picked is their so-called expert on the assassination was Gary Mack,
[1:17:57.360 --> 1:17:59.360]  the archivist of the sixth floor.
[1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:00.360]  All right, stay there.
[1:18:00.360 --> 1:18:01.360]  Stay there.
[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:02.360]  We've got a break, Robert.
[1:18:02.360 --> 1:18:07.160]  We'll hear about this when we get back on the other side of this quick break.
[1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:08.160]  Stay with us.
[1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:11.040]  And then we'll also ask the question, they wouldn't even show this reader film.
[1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:13.040]  They showed computer simulations.
[1:18:13.040 --> 1:18:17.160]  Why did they do that?

[1:21:11.640 --> 1:21:16.840]  This message has been brought to you by RadioCreditSecrets.com Honey have you seen the remote?
[1:21:16.840 --> 1:21:18.960]  Sweetie have you seen my car keys?
[1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:21.240]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:21:21.240 --> 1:21:22.240]  Sound familiar?
[1:21:22.240 --> 1:21:26.120]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead introducing our
[1:21:26.120 --> 1:21:30.760]  patent and find one find all key finders or FOFAXD for short.
[1:21:30.760 --> 1:21:35.120]  Once a FOFA key finder is attached to each of those easy to lose things it can find and
[1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:36.920]  be found by all the rest.

[1:21:50.880 --> 1:21:52.880]  Got the remote!
[1:21:52.880 --> 1:21:54.960]  Oh my keys.

[1:22:22.120 --> 1:22:30.120]  Robert Grotin, Jim Mars, the two Twin Peaks of the JFK investigation movement, both of
[1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:37.120]  these men have powerlessly contributed to exposing the inside job of the assassination.
[1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:40.400]  Okay, Robert you got interrupted by the break there.
[1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:44.080]  You were talking about who they use as their expert in this film.
[1:22:44.080 --> 1:22:45.080]  Please continue.
[1:22:45.080 --> 1:22:52.720]  Yes, they use Gary Mack who is the archivist for the Six Four Museum and the Six Four
[1:22:52.720 --> 1:23:00.520]  Museum is in all probability the strongest mouthpiece for the Warren Commission that
[1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:04.320]  exists in the world today.
[1:23:04.320 --> 1:23:05.320]  It's unbelievable.
[1:23:05.320 --> 1:23:10.360]  Here's a man who has done nothing in the history of the case to try to solve it.
[1:23:10.360 --> 1:23:15.560]  He used to be a great spokesman on our side until they offered him the job there and then
[1:23:15.560 --> 1:23:18.080]  he sold out to the other side.
[1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:20.400]  It's very, very sad.
[1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:22.160]  I was there for crying out loud.
[1:23:22.160 --> 1:23:25.800]  I was showing them that they were wrong and they absolutely ignored me.
[1:23:25.800 --> 1:23:26.800]  They knew who I was.
[1:23:26.800 --> 1:23:28.480]  There's no question about that.
[1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:29.480]  They admitted it.
[1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:34.560]  Now, where you offered the job at the book building too?
[1:23:34.560 --> 1:23:37.560]  I was actually offered a higher job than he has.
[1:23:37.560 --> 1:23:41.480]  He's the archivist, I was offered the job as director.
[1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:45.200]  They made it very, very clear to me that I would have to sell out and I could not talk
[1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:46.200]  about the conspiracy.
[1:23:46.200 --> 1:23:47.960]  Folks, that's when you know this is real.
[1:23:47.960 --> 1:23:50.280]  I have been approached many times.
[1:23:50.280 --> 1:23:52.160]  This is real, folks.
[1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:53.160]  Please continue.
[1:23:53.160 --> 1:23:54.160]  Well, that's it.
[1:23:54.160 --> 1:23:58.160]  I just absolutely refuse to do it.
[1:23:58.160 --> 1:24:02.720]  My integrity meant more to me than the money that they offered me, which at the time, I
[1:24:02.720 --> 1:24:06.280]  believe, if I'm correct, it was $180,000 a year.
[1:24:06.280 --> 1:24:07.280]  Unbelievable.
[1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:08.280]  I didn't offer you that.
[1:24:08.280 --> 1:24:10.560]  Oh, gosh, those about 20 years ago.
[1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:13.240]  Jim, your take on all of this and on this individual.
[1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:14.240]  Yeah.
[1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:15.360]  Well, let me tell you this.
[1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:25.240]  I'm looking at a copy of a publication called Cover-Ups October 1982 and the editor and
[1:24:25.240 --> 1:24:30.200]  publisher is Gary Mack, the same Gary Mack who was on the program Sunday night and who
[1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:36.760]  is now a curator at the 6-4 Museum and on the front page of Cover-Ups edited and published
[1:24:36.760 --> 1:24:37.760]  by Gary Mack.
[1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:43.560]  We have a picture of what we have become known as the Badge Man and this is a figure firing
[1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:49.240]  a rifle or some weapon that is taken from the Mary Mormon photograph and which he published
[1:24:49.240 --> 1:24:59.200]  right here on the cover of Cover-Ups and the figure is to the north of the southwest corner
[1:24:59.200 --> 1:25:04.280]  of the picket fence on the grassy knoll and this was his own publication.
[1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:11.440]  Now, on Sunday night's program, he takes us far to the west of the corner of the fence,
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:16.680]  the totally opposite direction of where this Badge Man photograph is and makes a big deal
[1:25:16.680 --> 1:25:19.240]  out of saying there's nothing here, folks.
[1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:22.800]  We've checked and there was no shot from the grassy knoll.
[1:25:22.800 --> 1:25:23.800]  Let me just say this.
[1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:29.400]  He's forgotten that it was his own work and his own story that points out to Badge Man
[1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:33.280]  who's in the opposite direction of what he pointed out Sunday night.
[1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:34.280]  Absolutely.
[1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:39.240]  I mean, just watching his body language, they all had guilty smiles on their faces, Cheshire
[1:25:39.240 --> 1:25:45.000]  Cat smiles, just oozed and that's why the people commenting on the Discovery Channel
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:46.640]  website were throwing up.
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:50.040]  A great point that Jim makes, Robert.
[1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:55.440]  Well, hey, let me add something here too that you probably don't know, Alex, and I'm not
[1:25:55.440 --> 1:26:01.680]  even sure if Robert knows this, but the point is that any time you do a study of what happened
[1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:10.360]  in Dealey Plaza, you've got to have absolutely 100% accurate data about the topography of
[1:26:10.360 --> 1:26:11.360]  Dealey Plaza.
[1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:13.520]  You've got to have the distances right.
[1:26:13.520 --> 1:26:15.920]  You have to have the elevations right.
[1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:21.520]  If it's off even an inch somewhere, then a few feet out, you're going to be off by
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:22.520]  mile.
[1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:24.080]  You know, it's got to be accurate.
[1:26:24.080 --> 1:26:28.880]  So how do we know what the topography and what the numbers are for Dealey Plaza?
[1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:36.440]  Well, in May of 1964, the Dallas County Surveyor, Robert West and his associate, Chester Bruneman,
[1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:42.560]  were hired by the Warren Commission to do survey work in Dealey Plaza based on every
[1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:48.080]  frame from the Zapruder film and they did their job and they did all the distances and
[1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:55.120]  they did all the elevations and both of those men years ago told me, and I can verify this
[1:26:55.120 --> 1:27:03.200]  because I have a copy of their original Platmap that the Warren Commission altered their numbers.
[1:27:03.200 --> 1:27:05.200]  They changed the frame numbers.
[1:27:05.200 --> 1:27:06.960]  They changed the numbers.
[1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:13.520]  So anybody doing a computer simulation or a reenactment in Dealey Plaza using the numbers
[1:27:13.520 --> 1:27:16.720]  from the Warren Commission, it's going to be off.
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:20.280]  They are not going to be correct and you can't pay any attention to it.
[1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:22.200]  Robert, comment on that.
[1:27:22.200 --> 1:27:29.640]  Chester Bruneman, the man who was just mentioned by Jim a moment ago, testified that his numbers
[1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:36.280]  and his measurements were changed and he was scared out of his wits because he was afraid
[1:27:36.280 --> 1:27:39.800]  that something was going to happen to him if he were to speak out about it.
[1:27:39.800 --> 1:27:44.320]  Eventually he did and what Jim says absolutely correct.
[1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:51.240]  One thing that is for sure too that the way they positioned the model in the show the
[1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:57.920]  other night was way off, absolutely way off both for angle and for position.
[1:27:57.920 --> 1:27:58.920]  Robert, stay there.
[1:27:58.920 --> 1:27:59.920]  Long segment coming up.
[1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:03.200]  We'll come right back to you to continue along that line of discussion.
[1:28:03.200 --> 1:28:06.680]  Right now we're dissecting this incredibly disgusting piece.
[1:28:06.680 --> 1:28:07.960]  We're on the march.
[1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:10.400]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:14.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:20.080]  Do you take nutritional supplements but don't notice any benefits?
[1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:24.840]  The problem is today supplements contain things like DL-alpha tachyferol, a synthetic form
[1:28:24.840 --> 1:28:30.440]  of vitamin E derived from petroleum or ferrous fumarate, an inorganic form of iron that can
[1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:32.360]  actually damage your body.
[1:28:32.360 --> 1:28:37.040]  Most of today's vitamin and mineral supplements are actually stressing your liver and kidneys.

[1:29:12.960 --> 1:29:21.600]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:29:21.600 --> 1:29:23.100]  against this country.
[1:29:23.100 --> 1:29:27.040]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[1:29:27.040 --> 1:29:28.040]  Bin Laden.
[1:29:28.040 --> 1:29:29.040]  This is his M.O.'s.
[1:29:29.040 --> 1:29:32.440]  We have to look to the Middle East, we have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:29:32.440 --> 1:29:37.080]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:29:37.080 --> 1:29:39.680]  networks inside the United States.
[1:29:39.680 --> 1:29:44.120]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:46.320]  in and on the U.S.
[1:29:46.320 --> 1:29:49.880]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:29:49.880 --> 1:29:55.480]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:29:55.480 --> 1:29:59.640]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[1:29:59.640 --> 1:30:00.640]  much more.

[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:26.240]  Jim Mars and Robert Rodin are our guests, if I can twist their arm just another 20-30 minutes
[1:31:26.240 --> 1:31:30.360]  and in the next hour we'll take your calls, but I forgot to ask them during the break so
[1:31:30.360 --> 1:31:36.360]  we'll ask them next break if they want to do that.
[1:31:36.360 --> 1:31:41.280]  George, start over, you got cut off by the break again with the line that you were discussing
[1:31:41.280 --> 1:31:49.320]  about how they had altered how the Warren Commission had gone in and changed and altered
[1:31:49.320 --> 1:31:51.760]  the surveys that they commissioned.
[1:31:51.760 --> 1:31:57.360]  Well, Jim had brought up the subject and he's absolutely right.
[1:31:57.360 --> 1:32:05.520]  The Chester Brenerman went on record and actually there are Warren affidavits by him saying how
[1:32:05.520 --> 1:32:13.880]  they changed the numbers, they altered the directions, they altered the measurements,
[1:32:13.880 --> 1:32:16.120]  which throws everything off.
[1:32:16.120 --> 1:32:21.320]  You'd think that, say, a quarter of an inch difference in back of the President's head
[1:32:21.320 --> 1:32:27.320]  might not be so much, but it really is because, as Jim pointed out again, when you go backwards
[1:32:27.320 --> 1:32:32.560]  the farther away you get from the target, the greater the distance becomes.
[1:32:32.560 --> 1:32:40.960]  Now when they fired the shots, they fired three shots at the dummy's head on the show.
[1:32:40.960 --> 1:32:48.800]  The first one was from the front and it was a soft-nosed bullet and it literally ripped
[1:32:48.800 --> 1:32:50.920]  the entire head off.
[1:32:50.920 --> 1:32:54.320]  That never happens in real life, no matter what.
[1:32:54.320 --> 1:32:58.440]  You might have a great deal of damage, but it never blows the entire head completely
[1:32:58.440 --> 1:32:59.440]  off.
[1:32:59.440 --> 1:33:05.080]  Because the skin is all bound and connected with tissue to the bone, so it may be like
[1:33:05.080 --> 1:33:08.560]  a big pop balloon, but still the head doesn't completely blow off.
[1:33:08.560 --> 1:33:09.560]  Exactly.
[1:33:09.560 --> 1:33:10.560]  That was the first one.
[1:33:10.560 --> 1:33:17.040]  The second one fired from the front was a carcano-type bullet and it entered the head
[1:33:17.040 --> 1:33:23.200]  approximately three and a half to four inches too far to the front of the head at a head
[1:33:23.200 --> 1:33:30.240]  that was angled far more to the counter-clockwise than it should have been.
[1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:34.400]  That's why when it exited it exited from the side instead of the back.
[1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:38.240]  The President was hit much farther to the rear of the head, although it came from the
[1:33:38.240 --> 1:33:42.600]  front, it hit on the side and that's the semantics of the whole thing.
[1:33:42.600 --> 1:33:46.160]  He wasn't hit in the front, he was hit from the front.
[1:33:46.160 --> 1:33:49.480]  The third shot that they fired was from behind.
[1:33:49.480 --> 1:33:57.800]  They hit four inches too high and the damage on the prosthetic dummy that they were using
[1:33:57.800 --> 1:34:01.680]  was totally dissimilar to the actual autopsy evidence.
[1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:06.400]  The autopsy photographs and the description of the Dallas doctors does not match at all
[1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:08.840]  what happened to the dummy in their show.
[1:34:08.840 --> 1:34:11.600]  And then they would never bother to mention that.
[1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:16.680]  And then they, and I'm about to comment on this, they wouldn't show the subreder film,
[1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:21.200]  they would show a computer rendering of it, which in reality, because I wouldn't pull
[1:34:21.200 --> 1:34:24.040]  up the film, was different.
[1:34:24.040 --> 1:34:25.560]  You're absolutely right.
[1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:29.240]  Can you speak to that?
[1:34:29.240 --> 1:34:35.480]  Well, what they claim is they claim that the subreder film is too gory and it would offend
[1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:40.360]  the sensitivities or sensibilities of the audience.
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:41.360]  That's absurd.
[1:34:41.360 --> 1:34:43.120]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:48.720]  We see more gruesome stuff than that on TV every day and in movies every day.
[1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:52.760]  And here we're talking about the single most important piece of evidence that we've got
[1:34:52.760 --> 1:34:56.200]  and they pretend that it's not important enough to show.
[1:34:56.200 --> 1:34:57.200]  That's absolutely absurd.
[1:34:57.200 --> 1:35:03.080]  They know darn well that when you compare the subreder film or the Mormon photograph
[1:35:03.080 --> 1:35:07.600]  to their recreation, that they don't match at all.
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:08.600]  Jay Alex?
[1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:09.600]  Yeah.
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:17.600]  Number one, we don't even have to trust the statements of Chester Brenman and which, by
[1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:22.720]  the way, was confirmed to me also by the Dallas County Surveyor, Robert West.
[1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:28.200]  He also told me that they had altered their numbers, but we don't have to trust their
[1:35:28.200 --> 1:35:29.200]  testimony.
[1:35:29.200 --> 1:35:34.120]  Chester Brenman allowed me to make a copy of their original plat map and all you have
[1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:42.960]  to do is compare their graph numbers with the Warren Commission Exhibit 884 and you
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:45.480]  can tell that they're not the same.
[1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:47.840]  They altered it, but here's something else.
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:55.720]  Also on their map, they took note of the two yellow marks on the curb.
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:36:00.720]  That's a whole interesting thing which happened to bracket right where the head shot was and
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:07.880]  many people, particularly the sniper experts, feel like that these two yellow paint marks
[1:36:07.880 --> 1:36:13.680]  were distance indicators for shooters to know exactly where the distance was, where
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:15.600]  the head shot was to take place.
[1:36:15.600 --> 1:36:21.640]  They also marked the area of a bullet shot on the curb on the south side of Elm Street.
[1:36:21.640 --> 1:36:28.720]  They also made a notation that where the first shot struck in the limousine up on Elm Street,
[1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:35.320]  they said this area hid behind a tree for any shot from the depository as of this date,
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:38.000]  May 1964.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:43.320]  All of these notations were deleted by the Warren Commission when they published their
[1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:44.320]  map.
[1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:49.920]  I mean, that's evidence of guilt right there is the continual ongoing cover up at thousands
[1:36:49.920 --> 1:36:50.920]  of different points.
[1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:54.960]  I mean, it's just one huge saga, but going back to the psychology, and I want to ask
[1:36:54.960 --> 1:36:59.760]  both of you this, both Robert Groden and Jim Mars, probably the two most knowledgeable
[1:36:59.760 --> 1:37:04.040]  people on the JFK assassination and the ensuing cover up.
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:07.640]  Going back to one of your former colleagues, how did they get him to join the dark side?
[1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:10.760]  I mean, Robert was talking about Empire Strikes Back.
[1:37:10.760 --> 1:37:14.960]  It's like this guy was Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader.
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:18.440]  Show him the money.
[1:37:18.440 --> 1:37:20.240]  Show him the money.
[1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:23.200]  I don't know what made him sell out, but he did.
[1:37:23.200 --> 1:37:30.480]  I mean, here's a guy who literally has done nothing on his own on this case.
[1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:35.480]  He carried a message from one researcher to the House of Assassinations Committee.
[1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:40.800]  He took credit for the work of two other people, and he claims to have discovered the badge
[1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:43.920]  man that Jim just mentioned before.
[1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:50.000]  In fact, it was President Carter's sister, Ruth Stapleton, who found the badge man initially,
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  and that was in Denver.
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:52.480]  I was there when she did it.
[1:37:52.480 --> 1:37:57.080]  Well, he's one of the top guys now at the Little Brainwashing Museum, where they teach
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:38:00.480]  the official story there and bring the school kids through every day, and the college students
[1:38:00.480 --> 1:38:04.840]  and the police and the rest of them in the police academy.
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:09.560]  And then Robert, you're out there, Rain or Shine, generally, on the grass, you know.
[1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:14.920]  When you run into him, what do you say to him over the years?
[1:38:14.920 --> 1:38:16.720]  We rarely do run into each other.
[1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:24.400]  When we do, I guess we're as courteous as we can be, but that's changing very rapidly
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:30.280]  because the Sixth Floor has done everything that they can through the years to try to
[1:38:30.280 --> 1:38:35.280]  get people on the other side of the issue out of Dealey Plaza.
[1:38:35.280 --> 1:38:41.520]  I mean, I've been arrested, I've been thrown in jail, I've been ticketed 80 times, harassed
[1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:46.080]  over 400 times, one time they even sent in Homeland Security with machine guns to try
[1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:48.320]  to get rid of me.
[1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:53.200]  And you know, it hasn't worked, and they haven't stopped trying.
[1:38:53.200 --> 1:38:57.760]  Can you imagine what the founding fathers would say if they could see all of this, this
[1:38:57.760 --> 1:38:58.760]  country?
[1:38:58.760 --> 1:39:00.760]  I mean, look how guilty they act.
[1:39:00.760 --> 1:39:05.520]  And of course, you're a major researcher, you know, you and Jim, we're the big advisors,
[1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:08.880]  and of course, yourself there on the ground for the JFK film, you've written all these
[1:39:08.880 --> 1:39:12.480]  books, and you're the guy that brought up the Subruder film and all of this, but nope,
[1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:14.960]  the cops are, sorry, we're just going to arrest you.
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:20.680]  Everybody else can stand out here saying what they want, but you, Robert Groden, you can't.
[1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:23.080]  Jim Mars, have you ever been harassed out there?
[1:39:23.080 --> 1:39:26.760]  No, I can't say that I have.
[1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:31.760]  Of course, I don't make, I don't go and hang around Dealey Plaza much myself.
[1:39:31.760 --> 1:39:35.040]  I did that enough years and years ago.
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:41.880]  In fact, I have a photograph that I took from the 6th floor window before they built the
[1:39:41.880 --> 1:39:44.240]  6th floor up there.
[1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:48.280]  If you go to the 6th floor museum, you'll notice that they claim that we're not trying
[1:39:48.280 --> 1:39:49.800]  to make any statement here.
[1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:55.560]  We don't take a position on what happened to Kennedy, but they have Plexiglas off that
[1:39:55.560 --> 1:40:00.520]  whole corner there and put boxes up and left the window a little bit open and they've set
[1:40:00.520 --> 1:40:05.800]  the whole Sniper's Nest stage there, as is to say, well, here's where it happened, folks,
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:07.360]  and here's what it was.
[1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:13.520]  But of course, nobody from the public, in fact, they wouldn't even let Oliver Stone
[1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:19.080]  go up and film from the 6th floor window because when you stand in that window and you look
[1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:24.920]  down to the street, you realize that there's a tree blocking the line of sight.
[1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:26.880]  You can't see what's going on.
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:27.880]  But let me tell you one story.
[1:40:27.880 --> 1:40:30.840]  Well, let me just throw something in real fast.
[1:40:30.840 --> 1:40:35.720]  Back 20-something years ago, that's what woke up Colonel Craig Roberts as a Sniper bestowing
[1:40:35.720 --> 1:40:38.560]  author on the subject, and you know, a SWAT team guy.
[1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:41.600]  He went and looked in the window and was like, that's ridiculous.
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:44.960]  You couldn't make that shot in six seconds, you know, you couldn't shoot three times,
[1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:51.280]  you couldn't shoot through that tree, and that happened to thousands of shooters, you
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:54.280]  know, police military who sat there, but please continue.
[1:40:54.280 --> 1:41:02.600]  Well, I don't know of any firearms expert, an expert in sniping who buys the idea that
[1:41:02.600 --> 1:41:09.000]  Oswald was able to squeeze off three shots in six seconds with this really bad Italian
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:12.200]  war rifle that had a misaligned scope.
[1:41:12.200 --> 1:41:14.720]  People don't pay any attention to that either.
[1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:19.160]  Ronald Simmons of the Army's Ballistic Test Center told the Warrant Commission they had
[1:41:19.160 --> 1:41:25.200]  to put three metal shims under the scope of the Oswald rifle just to make it accurate
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:26.200]  enough to test.
[1:41:26.200 --> 1:41:28.160]  All right, let me stop you right there.
[1:41:28.160 --> 1:41:32.640]  That brings up, you know, to both of you, but first Robert, the Dallas Morning News
[1:41:32.640 --> 1:41:37.680]  a month ago came out and said, oh, evidence, you know, that this isn't the bullet that
[1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:43.440]  did it, or we've now had Los Alamos Laboratories come out and the Army did test, and so we're
[1:41:43.440 --> 1:41:48.760]  seeing sectors of the government coming out and overturning what had done previously,
[1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:54.600]  A, what do these new developments mean, and then, B, how is this coming from the government
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:41:55.600]  of all places?
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:42:03.280]  Well, you know, people like Jim and myself have always realized that the issues of the
[1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:08.960]  ballistics evidence were invalid, the way they were testing, the type of testing they
[1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:13.880]  were doing could prove a negative, but could never prove a positive.
[1:42:13.880 --> 1:42:18.320]  That's the whole point, yet the Warrant Commission claimed that it did, in fact, prove a positive,
[1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:20.200]  and it never did.
[1:42:20.200 --> 1:42:28.080]  What they dealt with was the makeup of bullet fragments, and of the makeup, they tested for
[1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:33.960]  something like 20-odd different pieces of metal, types of metal.
[1:42:33.960 --> 1:42:40.600]  The only one of all of them that came even close was antimony, and it wasn't even right
[1:42:40.600 --> 1:42:41.600]  on.
[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:46.920]  They said that since one of all of these different elements matched, close enough, they said
[1:42:46.920 --> 1:42:48.640]  it came from the same bullet.
[1:42:48.640 --> 1:42:51.760]  In fact, nothing could be farther from the truth.
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:56.200]  If they found nothing, they could prove that it did not, but the test itself never proves
[1:42:56.200 --> 1:43:02.440]  that it did, but now the government is finally admitting that, and people that have been
[1:43:02.440 --> 1:43:06.480]  convicted on that kind of evidence are now having their cases totally reviewed all over
[1:43:06.480 --> 1:43:07.480]  the place.
[1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:11.440]  Well, I was bringing this up to the director of the film, as you said, who specializes
[1:43:11.440 --> 1:43:17.680]  in these fraudulent science hit pieces on the JFK researchers, and he would just kind
[1:43:17.680 --> 1:43:20.840]  of laugh at me, and he'd giggle, and I'd say, what about bullet fragments?
[1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:24.720]  He'd say, oh, there weren't any bullet fragments, and I'd say, but they admit there were, and
[1:43:24.720 --> 1:43:29.760]  then he would giggle, and then I'd say, well, it heads too far forward, and you didn't have
[1:43:29.760 --> 1:43:34.240]  it aligned right, and he'd giggle, and I guess it's just kind of funny to these people.
[1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:37.360]  Well, I think, Alex, you're missing the point here.
[1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:43.080]  I think the point of a program like this on the Discovery Channel goes back to one of
[1:43:43.080 --> 1:43:45.640]  the basic maxims of debate.
[1:43:45.640 --> 1:43:47.400]  It's an appeal to authority.
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:50.160]  Oh, it's on the Discovery Channel.
[1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:52.120]  They use scientific methods.
[1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:53.840]  It's got to be correct.
[1:43:53.840 --> 1:43:55.920]  And of course, it's not.
[1:43:55.920 --> 1:44:01.480]  But programs like this are not designed to convince thinking people, people like you
[1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:05.040]  and like Robert, and people who know the case.
[1:44:05.040 --> 1:44:10.400]  They know that's not going to sway our opinions, what they're hoping to do, and it's the same
[1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:15.640]  thing they do with their control over the corporate mass media, which is to put out
[1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:24.320]  sound bites and headlines and these special channel programs, hoping to keep the controversy
[1:44:24.320 --> 1:44:25.320]  going.
[1:44:25.320 --> 1:44:30.720]  They're going to have a whole new generation of Americans who don't know squat about the
[1:44:30.720 --> 1:44:35.520]  assassination, and they watch the Discovery program, and they go, oh, well, I guess it
[1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:41.880]  is possible that Oswald did it all by himself, and the case continues in controversy, which
[1:44:41.880 --> 1:44:46.000]  has been the method of cover-up from the get-go.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.360]  There's never been a lack of evidence.
[1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:50.040]  There's simply been obfuscation.
[1:44:50.040 --> 1:44:55.360]  They throw so much crap out there that the average person finally says, oh, man, I don't
[1:44:55.360 --> 1:44:57.240]  want to look at this anymore.
[1:44:57.240 --> 1:44:58.240]  No, I understand.
[1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:02.640]  They put it into a process of debate and discussion where you're always, well, it's the same thing
[1:45:02.640 --> 1:45:04.160]  with the North American Union.
[1:45:04.160 --> 1:45:05.160]  It's the official government document.
[1:45:05.160 --> 1:45:06.160]  Same thing in 9-11.
[1:45:06.160 --> 1:45:11.360]  Well, just briefly fleshing this out, it's in the official documents.
[1:45:11.360 --> 1:45:12.360]  They signed it.
[1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:14.240]  It's in the Canadian papers.
[1:45:14.240 --> 1:45:16.160]  They're merging our militaries.
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:20.040]  Bush gets up and has press conferences on C-SPAN saying we're already merging with Europe,
[1:45:20.040 --> 1:45:22.240]  the Trans-Atlantic Treaty Agreement.
[1:45:22.240 --> 1:45:25.520]  But then when they go on our news, they say it doesn't exist, and then we always have
[1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:29.800]  a debate about whether it exists or not, instead of having a debate about do we want to be
[1:45:29.800 --> 1:45:31.800]  under this North American Union.
[1:45:31.800 --> 1:45:32.800]  Robert Groden.
[1:45:32.800 --> 1:45:33.800]  Well, absolutely.
[1:45:33.800 --> 1:45:40.080]  You know, it's propaganda and disinformation, and what they do is they just confuse the
[1:45:40.080 --> 1:45:44.480]  average member of the public.
[1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:48.960]  But in spite of all that they do, in spite of the power that they have over the press,
[1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:55.680]  the control over the press, the disinformation they put out, still 90% of the American people
[1:45:55.680 --> 1:46:00.320]  or greater always believe that there was, in fact, a conspiracy.
[1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:05.240]  The biggest part of the debate, the biggest part that people are not really sure of for
[1:46:05.240 --> 1:46:09.960]  the people out there is whether Lee Oswald is part of this conspiracy or not.
[1:46:09.960 --> 1:46:12.600]  But they understand that there was a conspiracy.
[1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:20.120]  Even the government admitted it in 1979, I'm sorry, you know, when the House committee,
[1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:24.440]  when the House assassination committee wrote their report, the last official word on this,
[1:46:24.440 --> 1:46:26.960]  they said that there was a conspiracy.
[1:46:26.960 --> 1:46:33.480]  And in fact, that stands to this day, yet the national news media just avoids it like
[1:46:33.480 --> 1:46:34.480]  crazy.
[1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:35.480]  Well, that's what they do.
[1:46:35.480 --> 1:46:41.520]  They buy omission, and that's why I refuse to do the interview.
[1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:46.120]  But of course, you offered to be interviewed by me, I mean, you tried to warn them, Robert,
[1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:49.640]  and obviously they didn't want to hear from you, as you said earlier, but I guess they
[1:46:49.640 --> 1:46:52.240]  thought that, how do you think they were going to come at me?
[1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:54.000]  I mean, I'm interested at that.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:47:02.680]  Well, you know, their concept is to ridicule anyone who tries to tell the truth.
[1:47:02.680 --> 1:47:11.880]  You know, I was a witness at the Second O.J. Simpson trial, and I testified as to specific
[1:47:11.880 --> 1:47:15.720]  photographic evidence, not to whether O.J. was guilty or not, that had nothing to do
[1:47:15.720 --> 1:47:16.720]  with it.
[1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:21.400]  Yet, an element of the Sixth Floor Museum constantly brings up, well, Grotin testified
[1:47:21.400 --> 1:47:22.400]  for O.J.
[1:47:22.400 --> 1:47:24.240]  Simpson, he's got to be crazy.
[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:31.040]  Well, you know, I wasn't paid for it, the Sixth Floor says, oh, Grotin did it for money,
[1:47:31.040 --> 1:47:32.040]  he did it for money.
[1:47:32.040 --> 1:47:33.040]  He didn't.
[1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:36.040]  I never got paid for it, and that wasn't the issue.
[1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:41.000]  The issue was that here's a guy who was in the same position that Lee Harvey Oswald appeared
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:45.960]  to be in, and I thought, well, you know, I've got proof that one particular photograph is
[1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:46.960]  a fake.
[1:47:46.960 --> 1:47:50.160]  I don't know whether O.J. did it or not, I never testified to that.
[1:47:50.160 --> 1:47:54.160]  What I testified to was that they had a phony photograph, which was created by the National
[1:47:54.160 --> 1:48:01.320]  Enquirer, accorded it to his own lawyers, and paid $18,000 for what it had done in Europe
[1:48:01.320 --> 1:48:04.240]  and made millions selling their rag.
[1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:08.680]  And then, of course, the cops also got caught with the blood additive in the blood sample,
[1:48:08.680 --> 1:48:10.840]  showing that they had planted blood.
[1:48:10.840 --> 1:48:15.400]  So, I mean, we're not weighing in for O.J. folks, the guy's obviously out of his mind.
[1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:19.320]  The point is, they tried to frame him, and so that's why he ended up getting off.
[1:48:19.320 --> 1:48:23.320]  You know, even if you think somebody's guilty, you can't frame them, folks, and so all Grotin
[1:48:23.320 --> 1:48:26.440]  did was go and document that that was a fake photo.
[1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:32.960]  Right, well, you're right about the EDTTA that was in the blood samples.
[1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:35.960]  There's also blood spatter evidence there, too, which proved to be untrue.
[1:48:35.960 --> 1:48:42.360]  Oh, by the way, as far as blood spatter evidence goes on the show that they used, they were
[1:48:42.360 --> 1:48:46.880]  talking about blood spatter, which they never actually got a chance to really test.
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:47.880]  Let me give you a quote.
[1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:52.320]  This quote is from a book, it's the textbook on blood spatter.
[1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:53.320]  Stay there.
[1:48:53.320 --> 1:48:54.320]  Stay there.
[1:48:54.320 --> 1:48:55.320]  We'll get it after the break with Robert Grotin and Jim Mars.
[1:48:55.320 --> 1:49:01.800]  It'll be both of them's websites, books, videos, all available there, just the premier experts
[1:49:01.800 --> 1:49:02.800]  on this.
[1:49:02.800 --> 1:49:07.640]  Forty-five years since the shadow government killed JFK, and they are striking back with
[1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:13.120]  all manner of flimsy propaganda, that if you know where to look, you find out that it's
[1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:14.120]  literally a facade.
[1:49:14.120 --> 1:49:17.840]  We'll be right back.
[1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:20.960]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty?
[1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:23.880]  What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[1:49:23.880 --> 1:49:28.120]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:33.560]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.
[1:49:33.560 --> 1:49:39.080]  Getseeds.net is offering an amazing special on 100 different varieties of heirloom vegetable
[1:49:39.080 --> 1:49:41.840]  seeds with a complete range of crops.

[1:50:13.880 --> 1:50:16.880]  Or go to Getseeds.net.
[1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:22.600]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Grounds Hero,
[1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:26.000]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:31.280]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:32.880]  to tell their story.
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:41.880]  Whitman, EVA director on the AG made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:46.640]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[1:50:46.640 --> 1:50:48.920]  take action against their global masters.
[1:50:48.920 --> 1:50:52.080]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:57.880]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:50:57.880 --> 1:51:01.400]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[1:51:01.400 --> 1:51:07.240]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide, or order
[1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:09.880]  the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:51:09.880 --> 1:51:13.560]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[1:51:13.560 --> 1:51:16.600]  and bring in martial law.
[1:51:16.600 --> 1:51:20.040]  America knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[1:51:20.040 --> 1:51:24.040]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way
[1:51:24.040 --> 1:51:25.720]  to get your daily intake?
[1:51:25.720 --> 1:51:30.000]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.480]  Nature's Gem, Premium Omega-3.
[1:51:32.480 --> 1:51:37.400]  Unlike other flaxseed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota, providing
[1:51:37.400 --> 1:51:42.720]  cooler temperatures and longer summer hours, producing the highest quality premium golden
[1:51:42.720 --> 1:51:43.880]  flaxseed around.
[1:51:43.880 --> 1:51:48.960]  In addition, we selectively harvest and sort flaxseeds by size and weight, keeping only
[1:51:48.960 --> 1:51:52.600]  the best seeds that can produce the highest abundance of omega-3.
[1:51:52.600 --> 1:51:55.960]  The result is a delicious, nutty, buttery flavor.
[1:51:55.960 --> 1:51:58.040]  Nature's Gem golden flax is pure.

[1:52:39.960 --> 1:52:45.960]  Jim, Jim first, plug your website, your books, your videos, your materials.
[1:52:45.960 --> 1:52:51.920]  Well, you can go to jimmars.com, that's J-I-M-M-A-R-R-S dot com.
[1:52:51.920 --> 1:52:57.880]  I've got a brand new book out right now, just hit, and it's already rising up the charts
[1:52:57.880 --> 1:53:01.480]  at amazon.com called Above Top Secret.
[1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:07.680]  And in there, I tackle 25 of the biggest mysteries, conspiracies going on right now, and including
[1:53:07.680 --> 1:53:10.440]  a whole chapter on who killed JFK.
[1:53:10.440 --> 1:53:15.080]  Now, if you want to get behind and get to the highest levels of who's behind the Guindy
[1:53:15.080 --> 1:53:20.680]  assassination, you need to read my also recent book, The Rise of the Fourth Reich, which
[1:53:20.680 --> 1:53:24.560]  I believe is available on Alex Jones' site.
[1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:32.080]  And then for those of you listening who have a copy of my book, Crossfire, I am going to
[1:53:32.080 --> 1:53:37.960]  do the conference in Dallas this weekend, and I'm going to have a number of new subject
[1:53:37.960 --> 1:53:41.120]  and name index for Crossfire.
[1:53:41.120 --> 1:53:44.240]  And once you have this, you'll be able to move through there.
[1:53:44.240 --> 1:53:47.960]  You'll find out things that you either forgot or never knew.
[1:53:47.960 --> 1:53:54.800]  For example, there was an attorney who overheard Jack Ruby and Lee Harvey Oswald plotting
[1:53:54.800 --> 1:54:02.200]  to kill Governor Connolly and reported this to the Texas authorities weeks before the
[1:54:02.200 --> 1:54:03.200]  Kennedy assassination.
[1:54:03.200 --> 1:54:04.200]  Who knew that?
[1:54:04.200 --> 1:54:05.200]  It's all there.
[1:54:05.200 --> 1:54:10.600]  It's in Crossfire, and with the new index, you can find everything you want to find.
[1:54:10.600 --> 1:54:11.600]  Absolutely.
[1:54:11.600 --> 1:54:16.640]  And folks, do go to infowars.com and get his Rise of the Fourth Reich book.
[1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:20.040]  Because if you want to understand, we're not saying they're German, Nazis running America.
[1:54:20.040 --> 1:54:25.680]  We're saying those ideas came from England and the United States, that COG form of shadow
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:26.680]  government.
[1:54:26.680 --> 1:54:31.480]  That is who is in control today, and that's why they're setting up this fascist system.
[1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:34.680]  So please get the Rise of the Fourth Reich at infowars.com.
[1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:38.920]  It's discounted, and I hope that you will give it to your friends and family this Christmas
[1:54:38.920 --> 1:54:42.960]  season because people need to know this is not a joke or a game, and this book will blow
[1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:43.960]  you away.
[1:54:43.960 --> 1:54:49.520]  You've also got a lot of great books and videos as well, Robert Groden, over at your website.
[1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:55.880]  Well my website is jfkmurder.com.
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:55:01.080]  Virtually everything that I've got is on there, and that which is still available.
[1:55:01.080 --> 1:55:03.360]  But the big thing isn't out yet.
[1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:07.720]  The new book is called JFK Absolute Proof.
[1:55:07.720 --> 1:55:12.920]  The book itself is finished, but it's not indexed and it's not proofread yet.
[1:55:12.920 --> 1:55:17.360]  So it'll be quite some time until it's ready, but when it is, it will be available.
[1:55:17.360 --> 1:55:21.280]  Now my website is a free website, you can go there anytime you want to, there's no
[1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:25.280]  charge, and as soon as it's available, it'll be announced on the site.
[1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:28.720]  By the way, I've seen some of the stuff that's in it that people have.
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:32.680]  I mean, I hope you got your door locked at night, bud, with the photos you've got.
[1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:34.720]  Oh, they're not here, believe me.
[1:55:34.720 --> 1:55:36.720]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[1:55:36.720 --> 1:55:37.720]  My goodness.
[1:55:37.720 --> 1:55:40.480]  Jim, I know you've probably seen those photos too.
[1:55:40.480 --> 1:55:41.480]  Oh yeah.
[1:55:41.480 --> 1:55:46.960]  I mean, it's just, Robert, last time you wouldn't answer us, but where on, I mean, how do you
[1:55:46.960 --> 1:55:47.960]  get all this?
[1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:48.960]  How do you get the subruder?
[1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:52.640]  How do you get the other photos and, I mean, all the others?
[1:55:52.640 --> 1:55:54.760]  I guess you just have the sources?
[1:55:54.760 --> 1:55:59.640]  Well, there's absolutely no single point for all of these things.
[1:55:59.640 --> 1:56:02.840]  The different things came from different places.
[1:56:02.840 --> 1:56:09.120]  And through the years, when I became known as the photo guy in the Kennedy case because
[1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:15.520]  of my release of the subruder film on Good Night America, people started coming to me.
[1:56:15.520 --> 1:56:20.120]  They wanted to see if I could find more stuff in their photographs and their films.
[1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:21.960]  And I always did the work for them for free.
[1:56:21.960 --> 1:56:24.840]  I never charged them a penny for it.
[1:56:24.840 --> 1:56:29.840]  But the deal was that I would have to be able to keep copies and release them when the time
[1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:30.840]  was right.
[1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:32.840]  And that's what I've done.
[1:56:32.840 --> 1:56:39.560]  I've released the films of the assassination and through these three books, well, I wrote
[1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:46.400]  High Treason, well, High Treason had 186 photographs in it, but then I did the killing
[1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:48.840]  of a president which had 600 photographs.
[1:56:48.840 --> 1:56:52.960]  Okay, back in one minute, back in one minute, with Robert Rowden and Jim Marsh, stay with
[1:56:52.960 --> 1:56:56.440]  us, your phone calls straight ahead.
[1:56:56.440 --> 1:56:57.440]  Hello, friends.
[1:56:57.440 --> 1:56:58.440]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:01.960]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[1:57:01.960 --> 1:57:02.960]  important than ever.
[1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:05.920]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[1:57:05.920 --> 1:57:08.800]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:12.760]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[1:57:12.760 --> 1:57:16.880]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, our elected representatives wanted a good old
[1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:20.880]  boy bailout for a special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[1:57:20.880 --> 1:57:22.720]  They turned off the telephones and emailed.
[1:57:22.720 --> 1:57:26.760]  They voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air.
[1:57:26.760 --> 1:57:29.520]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[1:57:29.520 --> 1:57:33.840]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and
[1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:38.640]  blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond many Americans' reach.
[1:57:38.640 --> 1:57:43.280]  In pre-Nancy Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[1:57:43.280 --> 1:57:45.820]  until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[1:57:45.820 --> 1:57:50.160]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[1:57:50.160 --> 1:57:54.200]  The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan grocery stores enough
[1:57:54.200 --> 1:57:55.840]  money to restock their shelves.
[1:57:55.840 --> 1:57:59.320]  The stores have less food, but jack up prices to stay in business.
[1:57:59.320 --> 1:58:02.720]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[1:58:02.720 --> 1:58:04.280]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[1:58:04.280 --> 1:58:08.320]  One-third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:12.520]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[1:58:12.520 --> 1:58:15.760]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having
[1:58:15.760 --> 1:58:19.680]  a supply of storeable food, the government, the new-old order has a lot less control over
[1:58:19.680 --> 1:58:23.960]  you, and so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:27.200]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[1:58:27.200 --> 1:58:31.440]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from E.coli,
[1:58:31.440 --> 1:58:35.280]  salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the
[1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:37.520]  cost of last year's grocery prices.
[1:58:37.520 --> 1:58:42.640]  For 1-800-409-5633, or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.

[1:58:55.200 --> 1:59:00.320]  Again, 800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:59:00.320 --> 1:59:01.320]  Take action today.
[1:59:01.320 --> 1:59:06.840]  The first step is getting storeable food.
[1:59:06.840 --> 1:59:11.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:59:11.640 --> 1:59:12.640]  You want answers?
[1:59:12.640 --> 1:59:14.840]  Well, so does he.
[1:59:14.840 --> 1:59:24.840]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:59:24.840 --> 1:59:32.600]  We've got him with us for another 20 minutes or so.
[1:59:32.600 --> 1:59:41.680]  Robert Rodin and, of course, Jim Mars, top experts in their own fields of the JFK assassination.
[1:59:41.680 --> 1:59:46.760]  Both of them, documentary filmmakers, both of them, authors, both of them worked intimately
[1:59:46.760 --> 1:59:52.760]  on the JFK film by Oliver Stone.
[1:59:52.760 --> 2:00:00.200]  I do want to start going to the phone calls here in just a few minutes, but where do you
[2:00:00.200 --> 2:00:02.480]  see this going?
[2:00:02.480 --> 2:00:07.080]  Both men, briefly, as 90-plus percent in every major poll know that there's a cover-up, a
[2:00:07.080 --> 2:00:09.280]  conspiracy to kill Kennedy.
[2:00:09.280 --> 2:00:14.880]  No amount of shoddy hit pieces are going to convince anybody otherwise.
[2:00:14.880 --> 2:00:16.320]  But not just with the JFK assassination.
[2:00:16.320 --> 2:00:19.720]  It probably started there, but with everything else now, the people know the government is
[2:00:19.720 --> 2:00:22.080]  a private group of criminals looting us.
[2:00:22.080 --> 2:00:24.160]  Where do you see this going in the future?
[2:00:24.160 --> 2:00:30.200]  Well, for me, yeah, this is Jim Mars.
[2:00:30.200 --> 2:00:37.520]  Unfortunately, I see that the Kennedy assassination is showing us a template for what's going
[2:00:37.520 --> 2:00:40.240]  to happen with 9-11.
[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:42.840]  There was a period of time, and Robert knows this, too.
[2:00:42.840 --> 2:00:43.840]  He lived through it.
[2:00:43.840 --> 2:00:48.400]  There was a period of time for 15, maybe 20 years after the assassination, when it was
[2:00:48.400 --> 2:00:53.000]  not considered socially acceptable to bring that up as a topic in public.
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  We just don't talk about that.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:57.720]  And then new generations came along.
[2:00:57.720 --> 2:01:01.920]  They were very inquisitive and curious, and all of a sudden, it became okay to talk about
[2:01:01.920 --> 2:01:02.920]  it.
[2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:08.240]  And all of a sudden, all this information that people like Robert and I and others had
[2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:10.040]  would begin to stumble out.
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:16.200]  And now, everybody, the polls show that 85-90 percent of the population now knows, understands
[2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:21.280]  and believes that Kennedy was killed as a result of a conspiracy.
[2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:27.480]  But it's still not an accepted thing, although, as Robert pointed out, the last word of the
[2:01:27.480 --> 2:01:31.440]  federal government was the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and they said there was
[2:01:31.440 --> 2:01:38.000]  probably a conspiracy, because there was one, excuse me, somebody's shooting at him from
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  the grass.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  He knows.
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  Well, they said 95 percent chance.
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  95.
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.080]  Yeah, way up there.
[2:01:46.080 --> 2:01:52.600]  And today, what we're in that, we're right back into that mode, it's not socially acceptable
[2:01:52.600 --> 2:01:56.480]  to speak out publicly about 9-11 and polite company.
[2:01:56.480 --> 2:02:01.520]  And so, they'll wait 20 years, and then all the information will come out, and in 40 years,
[2:02:01.520 --> 2:02:07.960]  we'll all know that 9-11 was an inside job, perpetrated by people within the Bush administration,
[2:02:07.960 --> 2:02:14.280]  and it'll just be accepted, but it still won't be officially acknowledged by leaders, nor
[2:02:14.280 --> 2:02:16.600]  will it be in the history books.
[2:02:16.600 --> 2:02:19.680]  Robert, your comments on what he was just saying?
[2:02:19.680 --> 2:02:24.720]  Well, I pretty much agree with what Jim said, you know, the American people has never been
[2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:26.680]  fooled by this, for the most part.
[2:02:26.680 --> 2:02:35.560]  I'm in daily plaza, hundreds and hundreds of days a year, virtually every day.
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:42.280]  And I can tell you, without doing an actual account, that approximately 99 percent, 99
[2:02:42.280 --> 2:02:46.400]  plus percent, don't believe the Warren Commission fairytale.
[2:02:46.400 --> 2:02:48.440]  They just don't buy it.
[2:02:48.440 --> 2:02:53.720]  And when they see the plaza itself, they just shake their heads, and can't believe that
[2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:57.880]  the other side tried to convince us of this incredible lie.
[2:02:57.880 --> 2:03:02.640]  But unfortunately, they do seem to control the national news media.
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:05.400]  They control their broadcast licenses.
[2:03:05.400 --> 2:03:09.600]  The head of CBS at the time of the assassination was Bill Paley, one of the founders of the
[2:03:09.600 --> 2:03:11.160]  Central Intelligence Agency.
[2:03:11.160 --> 2:03:13.400]  Now, what do we expect from him?
[2:03:13.400 --> 2:03:18.200]  He gave the order, and nobody would dare challenge him from Walter Crockide on down.
[2:03:18.200 --> 2:03:23.160]  So they just arbitrarily started backing the Warren Commission, and that became what we
[2:03:23.160 --> 2:03:24.520]  got to hear.
[2:03:24.520 --> 2:03:31.440]  And if you talk to people on the street, if you find somebody who does believe that there
[2:03:31.440 --> 2:03:37.400]  was a, that the Warren Commission was right, you'll ask them why, they'll quote the Warren
[2:03:37.400 --> 2:03:38.400]  Commission.
[2:03:38.400 --> 2:03:40.960]  I mean, that's totally convoluted reasoning.
[2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:45.080]  It has, if there's no basis in fact there, there never was.
[2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:48.880]  For crying out loud, the Warren Commission had seven members.
[2:03:48.880 --> 2:03:53.720]  Three of those seven members, virtually half of them, did not believe that Oswald acted
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:03:54.720]  alone.
[2:03:54.720 --> 2:03:55.720]  All right.
[2:03:55.720 --> 2:03:57.560]  Robert, Jim, stay there.
[2:03:57.560 --> 2:04:01.080]  On the Internet at prisonplanet.tv, we're going to talk behind the scenes during this
[2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:02.800]  break about this weekend.
[2:04:02.800 --> 2:04:03.800]  Now.
[2:04:03.800 --> 2:04:04.800]  All right.
[2:04:04.800 --> 2:04:06.960]  We're not on the MNFM right now, but we are on the web.
[2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:11.360]  So we are on the air transmitting, just not broadcasting right now, guys.
[2:04:11.360 --> 2:04:18.000]  I've been so busy, you've been so busy, I haven't really conferred with both of you about when
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  we're hooking up.
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:23.280]  Jim, we're going to meet, I mean, I'll see you around, but we're going to meet Sunday,
[2:04:23.280 --> 2:04:24.280]  right?
[2:04:24.280 --> 2:04:27.520]  And go eat lunch and then do some interviews then, right?
[2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:28.520]  Right.
[2:04:28.520 --> 2:04:30.840]  Well, I also arrange with your people, I think.
[2:04:30.840 --> 2:04:35.920]  I told them I'd be at the grassy knoll about an hour earlier, about 11 o'clock.
[2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:37.880]  If you're going to be there, we could talk some then.
[2:04:37.880 --> 2:04:38.880]  Okay.
[2:04:38.880 --> 2:04:40.120]  So we'll talk Saturday too then.
[2:04:40.120 --> 2:04:41.120]  Right.
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:42.120]  Okay.
[2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:43.120]  Perfect.
[2:04:43.120 --> 2:04:46.600]  And maybe I'll tag along to the little convention event you're going to, because I'd like to
[2:04:46.600 --> 2:04:48.120]  get some shots of you talking to a crowd.
[2:04:48.120 --> 2:04:49.120]  Is that okay?
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:50.120]  It's fine with me.
[2:04:50.120 --> 2:04:54.440]  If they'll let you in, you may have to pay door admission.
[2:04:54.440 --> 2:04:57.840]  Maybe you can give me their name and number, who's running that?
[2:04:57.840 --> 2:04:59.280]  This is JFK Lancer.
[2:04:59.280 --> 2:05:00.280]  Okay.
[2:05:00.280 --> 2:05:01.280]  Well, that shouldn't be a problem.
[2:05:01.280 --> 2:05:02.680]  I'll call you this afternoon.
[2:05:02.680 --> 2:05:04.320]  Are you going to be there after the show?
[2:05:04.320 --> 2:05:05.320]  Yes.
[2:05:05.320 --> 2:05:06.320]  Okay.
[2:05:06.320 --> 2:05:13.080]  Also, Mr. Groden, we're going to get together, I guess, Monday morning, right?
[2:05:13.080 --> 2:05:14.080]  Yes.
[2:05:14.080 --> 2:05:20.960]  So we're due to see each other Saturday in the plaza, and Monday we have an appointment
[2:05:20.960 --> 2:05:21.960]  for the filming.
[2:05:21.960 --> 2:05:22.960]  Absolutely.
[2:05:22.960 --> 2:05:25.320]  And I guess Sunday you're going to be in the plaza too.
[2:05:25.320 --> 2:05:26.320]  Yes, absolutely.
[2:05:26.320 --> 2:05:27.320]  Okay.
[2:05:27.320 --> 2:05:29.880]  Well, I'm going to be filming some of you interacting with folks because that's also
[2:05:29.880 --> 2:05:30.880]  important.
[2:05:30.880 --> 2:05:37.240]  And then I think in the film, I also just want to mention what you brought up about the individual
[2:05:37.240 --> 2:05:42.600]  who now runs the schoolbook building there, formerly being one of your colleagues.
[2:05:42.600 --> 2:05:46.080]  And I think that's really interesting because they never want to mention that in these TV
[2:05:46.080 --> 2:05:48.080]  shows, do they?
[2:05:48.080 --> 2:05:49.080]  Never.
[2:05:49.080 --> 2:05:50.080]  Never.
[2:05:50.080 --> 2:05:51.080]  All right.
[2:05:51.080 --> 2:05:53.200]  Well, I look forward to seeing you both there.
[2:05:53.200 --> 2:05:54.600]  I think this is going to be a big year.
[2:05:54.600 --> 2:05:59.840]  I mean, it's so far out away from the killing, but also it's, you know, people love 25s,
[2:05:59.840 --> 2:06:02.440]  45s, 55s, 75s.
[2:06:02.440 --> 2:06:05.000]  I think there's going to be a lot of folks there.
[2:06:05.000 --> 2:06:06.000]  Well, we can only hope.
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:07.000]  You know, the people care.
[2:06:07.000 --> 2:06:15.600]  I see people in the plaza all year long, and they don't always just wait for the assassination
[2:06:15.600 --> 2:06:19.960]  anniversary, but it usually is a lot heavier then.
[2:06:19.960 --> 2:06:24.000]  Do you ever have folks come up and get in your face and call you a traitor?
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:26.480]  No, just the opposite.
[2:06:26.480 --> 2:06:27.480]  The exact opposite.
[2:06:27.480 --> 2:06:29.520]  They think that the government are the traitors.
[2:06:29.520 --> 2:06:33.840]  Well, no, I mean, I understand the majority, but 90 plus percent know it's an inside job,
[2:06:33.840 --> 2:06:37.760]  but, you know, blackout, but there'll be there still those Kool-Aid drinkers.
[2:06:37.760 --> 2:06:40.680]  Jim, have you ever run into those?
[2:06:40.680 --> 2:06:49.040]  No, not particularly because I don't get into the accusation mode or the judgment mode.
[2:06:49.040 --> 2:06:55.000]  I simply present the facts and the information, and occasionally I hear somebody say, I don't
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  believe that.
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:57.800]  Well, you know, that's fine.
[2:06:57.800 --> 2:07:03.800]  They're welcome to their belief, but I don't believe that is not a valid argument.
[2:07:03.800 --> 2:07:04.800]  Absolutely.
[2:07:04.800 --> 2:07:05.800]  Here we go.
[2:07:05.800 --> 2:07:06.800]  Back to the full audience.
[2:07:06.800 --> 2:07:10.560]  On any lines, the information war continues.
[2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:14.040]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:07:14.040 --> 2:07:15.540]  Okay.
[2:07:15.540 --> 2:07:19.720]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob in Florida.
[2:07:19.720 --> 2:07:22.080]  You're on the air with our guests.
[2:07:22.080 --> 2:07:23.080]  Welcome.
[2:07:23.080 --> 2:07:24.080]  Hello.
[2:07:24.080 --> 2:07:25.080]  Hello.
[2:07:25.080 --> 2:07:26.080]  Alex.
[2:07:26.080 --> 2:07:27.080]  Hi.
[2:07:27.080 --> 2:07:28.080]  This is Bob.
[2:07:28.080 --> 2:07:30.080]  I got a question about JFK.
[2:07:30.080 --> 2:07:39.640]  It seems like he was too naive in the sense that he thought he could abolish the Federal
[2:07:39.640 --> 2:07:42.120]  Reserve without anything happening to him.
[2:07:42.120 --> 2:07:46.760]  Just by reading his history, he should have known that anything he did to go around the
[2:07:46.760 --> 2:07:48.760]  bankers would have caused his death.
[2:07:48.760 --> 2:07:52.560]  Is there something else he could have done to lessen the power of the Federal Reserve
[2:07:52.560 --> 2:07:59.360]  without actually abolishing it or printing notes so that maybe today we could actually
[2:07:59.360 --> 2:08:02.000]  abolish it or just abolish it immediately?
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:05.480]  Alex, can I respond to that?
[2:08:05.480 --> 2:08:06.480]  Sure.
[2:08:06.480 --> 2:08:07.480]  Okay.
[2:08:07.480 --> 2:08:08.480]  Yes.
[2:08:08.480 --> 2:08:10.960]  There was things he could have done and he was doing.
[2:08:10.960 --> 2:08:16.160]  He had his Treasury Secretary, but they were beginning to alter Federal regulations
[2:08:16.160 --> 2:08:23.240]  rules, allowing power to be drawn back from the Federal Reserve system and back into the
[2:08:23.240 --> 2:08:24.880]  private banking system.
[2:08:24.880 --> 2:08:26.480]  He signed the executive order.
[2:08:26.480 --> 2:08:28.360]  He was pulling the troops out of Vietnam.
[2:08:28.360 --> 2:08:31.440]  He said he was going to abolish the CIA.
[2:08:31.440 --> 2:08:36.040]  He'd learned they were planning to stage terror attacks like 9-11.
[2:08:36.040 --> 2:08:41.280]  Just to expand on that, that's why even if Barack Obama was a wonderful person, nothing's
[2:08:41.280 --> 2:08:42.440]  going to change.
[2:08:42.440 --> 2:08:44.800]  That's why he's appointing all the same people.
[2:08:44.800 --> 2:08:50.720]  That's why he's going back on all the promises because presidents are puppets, period.
[2:08:50.720 --> 2:08:55.920]  George Bush, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Ronald Reagan early on got
[2:08:55.920 --> 2:08:56.920]  out of line.
[2:08:56.920 --> 2:08:58.120]  The Secret Service lit him up.
[2:08:58.120 --> 2:08:59.640]  Do you want to talk about that, Jim?
[2:08:59.640 --> 2:09:05.640]  Well, I will simply say that on all three network cameras that we're filming, Ronald
[2:09:05.640 --> 2:09:13.480]  Reagan's exit from that hotel when the assassination attempt happened recorded seven shots very
[2:09:13.480 --> 2:09:14.480]  clearly.
[2:09:14.480 --> 2:09:18.880]  And yet, Hinckley's revolver was a six-shot revolver.
[2:09:18.880 --> 2:09:24.960]  So nobody has ever bothered to try to determine where that seventh shot came from.
[2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:25.960]  But let me finish with...
[2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:30.520]  Well, the Bushes were also big buddies with the Hinckley's and had dinner with them the
[2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:31.520]  night before.
[2:09:31.520 --> 2:09:32.520]  That's true.
[2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:37.960]  And it's funny because the Bushes are also the closest business and social friends to
[2:09:37.960 --> 2:09:39.360]  the Bin Laden family.
[2:09:39.360 --> 2:09:40.360]  No.
[2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:41.360]  Wait a minute.
[2:09:41.360 --> 2:09:42.360]  It gets a little thick there.
[2:09:42.360 --> 2:09:43.360]  Go ahead.
[2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:50.320]  In June of 1963, Kennedy even went farther than trying to curtail the power of the Federal
[2:09:50.320 --> 2:09:51.600]  Reserve system.
[2:09:51.600 --> 2:09:59.560]  He actually issued $4.2 billion in currency that he issued through the Treasury Department
[2:09:59.560 --> 2:10:02.240]  rather than through the Federal Reserve.
[2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:08.480]  I have a $5 bill, 1963, it has red ink on it and at the top instead of saying Federal
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:11.840]  Reserve note, it says United States notes.
[2:10:11.840 --> 2:10:16.040]  Now the difference is, is that if we issue money through the Treasury, we don't have
[2:10:16.040 --> 2:10:23.240]  to pay interest on it to those international bankers and Bob DeCaller was quite correct.
[2:10:23.240 --> 2:10:26.520]  I think Kennedy was a bit naïve.
[2:10:26.520 --> 2:10:27.520]  Yes.
[2:10:27.520 --> 2:10:31.640]  He really thought he was President of the United States, leader of the free world, and
[2:10:31.640 --> 2:10:36.280]  he thought that he could make decisions in the best interest of the public, namely issue
[2:10:36.280 --> 2:10:38.320]  money that's interest-free.
[2:10:38.320 --> 2:10:44.400]  And he did not probably stop to realize that the only other U.S. president to issue interest-free
[2:10:44.400 --> 2:10:51.120]  money was Abraham Lincoln, who issued greenbacks to support the war between the states.
[2:10:51.120 --> 2:10:56.800]  And both of those men, and I don't think this is a coincidence, both of those men were shot
[2:10:56.800 --> 2:10:58.800]  in the head in broad daylight.
[2:10:58.800 --> 2:10:59.800]  Absolutely.
[2:10:59.800 --> 2:11:01.520]  Thank you for the call, Bob.
[2:11:01.520 --> 2:11:06.760]  Any comments on why the establishment wanted Kennedy dead, Robert Groden?
[2:11:06.760 --> 2:11:12.120]  Well, the President was ending the Vietnam War, which was big business and a lot of money
[2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:17.080]  to very, very powerful people, including Lyndon Johnson.
[2:11:17.080 --> 2:11:22.720]  Johnson was a major stockholder in, I believe, seven, perhaps more, at least seven companies
[2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:25.320]  that had Vietnam War contracts.
[2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:29.840]  He made billions off the war himself, and it's not the only reason why the President
[2:11:29.840 --> 2:11:30.840]  was killed.
[2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:34.600]  It was certainly one of the major reasons.
[2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:35.600]  It's unbelievable.
[2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:39.280]  Another major reason was he and his brother Bobby, the Attorney General, were fighting
[2:11:39.280 --> 2:11:44.480]  the only effective war in this nation's history against organized crime.
[2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:46.640]  Whereas Richard Nixon's closest friend was B.B.
[2:11:46.640 --> 2:11:53.120]  Roboso, a mobster, President Kennedy and his brother Bobby were fighting a very effective
[2:11:53.120 --> 2:11:58.680]  war against people like Carlos Marchello, Santos Traficante, Johnny Roselli, Jimmy Hoffa.
[2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:01.840]  Who all were contracted by the mob for opium cocaine.
[2:12:01.840 --> 2:12:03.560]  You name it, gambling prostitution.
[2:12:03.560 --> 2:12:04.560]  That's the CIA.
[2:12:04.560 --> 2:12:11.000]  The CIA was gutting out American servicemen in Vietnam, filling their bodies with heroin
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:13.520]  and sending it back to the United States.
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:18.800]  And Kennedy had vowed to destroy the CIA.
[2:12:18.800 --> 2:12:27.240]  He said he was going to splint it apart into a thousand pieces and cast it to the winds.
[2:12:27.240 --> 2:12:30.080]  So what is the strongest motivation for murder?
[2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:31.080]  Self-defense.
[2:12:31.080 --> 2:12:35.680]  So the mafia, it was self-defense, to the CIA, it was self-defense.
[2:12:35.680 --> 2:12:39.680]  Well, let's go further there.
[2:12:39.680 --> 2:12:44.160]  This is part of what governments do throughout history and to be childlike and say it doesn't
[2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:45.160]  exist.
[2:12:45.160 --> 2:12:46.160]  That's what's brought us to this point.
[2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:50.320]  We are now being openly raped by the bankers, five trillion stolen in five weeks right in
[2:12:50.320 --> 2:12:51.920]  front of everyone.
[2:12:51.920 --> 2:13:00.320]  But it is a great tragedy because that's when the shadow government really was able to fully
[2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:01.720]  take over this nation.
[2:13:01.720 --> 2:13:03.200]  Let's go to John N. Wyoming.
[2:13:03.200 --> 2:13:05.200]  John, you're on the air.
[2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:06.840]  Hi, Alex.
[2:13:06.840 --> 2:13:10.440]  I want to follow up on what Jim said just a while ago.
[2:13:10.440 --> 2:13:21.560]  That, yes, it was on June 4th, 1963, when JFK issued executive order 1110, which recall
[2:13:21.560 --> 2:13:23.280]  the Federal Reserve notes.
[2:13:23.280 --> 2:13:25.720]  And I have one of those United States notes.
[2:13:25.720 --> 2:13:27.600]  It's a series, 1963.
[2:13:27.600 --> 2:13:30.080]  It's a $2 bill.
[2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:35.160]  And indeed, this is what got him to $5 bill.
[2:13:35.160 --> 2:13:39.480]  I have a $2 bill that's a series, 1963.
[2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:44.080]  And it's also debt-free currency like that $5 bill that Jim has.
[2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:49.480]  But also, when I was living in Houston about 30 to 35 years ago, Channel 13, the ABC affiliate
[2:13:49.480 --> 2:13:56.400]  in Houston, showed an uncut copy of the Zapruder film, which, by the way, E. Howard Hunt's
[2:13:56.400 --> 2:14:01.840]  son was discussing with George Norrie shortly after E. Howard Hunt passed away, what a couple
[2:14:01.840 --> 2:14:08.160]  of years ago, that shows that Corsican assassin on the grassy knoll hiding in the bush, they
[2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:10.320]  stopped the frame.
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:15.560]  You could see the bush halfway between Zapruder and Kennedy's Lincoln limousine.
[2:14:15.560 --> 2:14:19.200]  And they readjusted the focus to where the bush was in sharp focus.
[2:14:19.200 --> 2:14:24.080]  And you could see that well-dressed Corsican assassin wearing a suit, a tie, and a fedora.
[2:14:24.080 --> 2:14:25.840]  OK, I'm going to let you go, John.
[2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:26.840]  I appreciate the calls.
[2:14:26.840 --> 2:14:31.000]  We're almost out of time with our guests, but we have the photo expert.
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:34.560]  We have the person who released the uncut Zapruder film.
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:38.000]  We have the person that enhanced it and looked at it.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:40.600]  Is what he was just saying accurate, Robert?
[2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:43.760]  It's a matter of interpretation.
[2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:45.400]  Yes, he's correct.
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:50.120]  There is somebody on the grassy knoll in the closing frames of the Zapruder film behind
[2:14:50.120 --> 2:14:51.120]  the fence.
[2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:56.320]  But it's not sharp enough, and it's not close enough to draw any kind of a determination
[2:14:56.320 --> 2:15:01.640]  as to whether or not you cannot make an identification.
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:08.160]  There is somebody there, but as far as that goes, whether he shows in the film or not,
[2:15:08.160 --> 2:15:13.160]  he was there because the medical evidence proves it, the eyewitness testimony proves
[2:15:13.160 --> 2:15:17.160]  it, and certainly the acoustics evidence proves it.
[2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:18.160]  Absolutely.
[2:15:18.160 --> 2:15:24.880]  OK, let's go ahead now and take another call from Ronnie in Texas.
[2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:25.880]  You're on the air, Ronnie.
[2:15:25.880 --> 2:15:26.880]  Go ahead.
[2:15:26.880 --> 2:15:27.880]  Thank you, sir.
[2:15:27.880 --> 2:15:33.440]  Briefly, me and Oswald and Ruby all lived in Oak Cliff at the time, and I've made it
[2:15:33.440 --> 2:15:38.160]  my business to try to learn as much as I could all these many years, and I really appreciate
[2:15:38.160 --> 2:15:42.920]  your guests there, and it's not no disrespect to them, but there's another great expert.
[2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:47.240]  That is, of course, Michael Collins Piper from the American Free Press who wrote Final
[2:15:47.240 --> 2:15:51.720]  Judgment, the book that shook up my world and changed my life, and added up the real
[2:15:51.720 --> 2:15:52.960]  evidence from others.
[2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:57.600]  He didn't add any evidence of his own, but it points the finger of guilt directly to
[2:15:57.600 --> 2:16:01.960]  Israeli founder and First Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion and the Israeli organized crime
[2:16:01.960 --> 2:16:06.880]  family, Godfather of all Godfathers, Meijer Lansky and his gang.
[2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:11.680]  And so no involvement, well, hold on just a second, but no involvement, though, about
[2:16:11.680 --> 2:16:16.680]  the president or the U.S. government or anybody that covered it up.
[2:16:16.680 --> 2:16:18.720]  It's just all only Israel, then.
[2:16:18.720 --> 2:16:24.680]  No, no, my mind about that is not who was involved, well, who wasn't involved?
[2:16:24.680 --> 2:16:25.680]  They involved everybody.
[2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:30.320]  They had the Dallas cops, they had, you know, Jonathan was probably involved, who knows,
[2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:35.360]  but there's so many fingers of guilt on that thing, and one of the main points that's been
[2:16:35.360 --> 2:16:39.920]  left out of everybody's book is that JFK smoked pot.
[2:16:39.920 --> 2:16:40.920]  He smoked pot.
[2:16:40.920 --> 2:16:45.400]  One of his early girlfriends, one of those girlfriends, made testimony about that, and
[2:16:45.400 --> 2:16:46.880]  it was just kind of ignored.
[2:16:46.880 --> 2:16:49.080]  Okay, let me just stop you right there.
[2:16:49.080 --> 2:16:54.400]  I believe I've even heard Jim, we're all friendly here, but I think I've even heard
[2:16:54.400 --> 2:16:58.720]  Jim attacked before by other people for not saying it's all Israel or something.
[2:16:58.720 --> 2:17:02.400]  Jim and Robert Gruden, what's your take on this whole Israel thing?
[2:17:02.400 --> 2:17:06.360]  I'm certainly not saying that Israel didn't do a lot of bad things, but how much evidence
[2:17:06.360 --> 2:17:09.760]  is it that Israel ran the killing of JFK?
[2:17:09.760 --> 2:17:12.520]  Well, go ahead, Robert.
[2:17:12.520 --> 2:17:13.520]  None at all.
[2:17:13.520 --> 2:17:14.520]  Right.
[2:17:14.520 --> 2:17:21.200]  This is an athletic situation that began ago and detracts from where the real evidence
[2:17:21.200 --> 2:17:22.200]  is.
[2:17:22.200 --> 2:17:29.720]  The thing is Israel did not have the power to subvert the Secret Service, the CIA, the
[2:17:29.720 --> 2:17:37.360]  FBI, the US military, although I will say this, people, when you talk about Israel involvement
[2:17:37.360 --> 2:17:42.680]  in the King assassination, if you're looking at it at a lower level, that's really not
[2:17:42.680 --> 2:17:48.320]  even possible, as I just said, but if you look at it from the highest level, the people
[2:17:48.320 --> 2:17:55.160]  who created the state of Israel, Lord Rothschild is considered the father of modern Israel,
[2:17:55.160 --> 2:18:00.120]  and when you look at the people who created Zionism, who then created the state of Israel,
[2:18:00.120 --> 2:18:05.720]  who then created communism in Russia, who then created national socialism or the Nazis
[2:18:05.720 --> 2:18:11.760]  in Germany, then you realize these are the same people who are the power structure, the
[2:18:11.760 --> 2:18:18.640]  true power structure of the United States, and yes, they at least had to acquiesce in
[2:18:18.640 --> 2:18:20.360]  the assassination of President Kennedy.
[2:18:20.360 --> 2:18:25.560]  And there's claims that he wouldn't give, there's claims he wouldn't give nukes to Israel, and
[2:18:25.560 --> 2:18:27.080]  that's what happened.
[2:18:27.080 --> 2:18:30.400]  You know, I would interview those people, it's just, folks have been too nasty to me
[2:18:30.400 --> 2:18:33.520]  when I'm just open and friendly, like if it's a Tex-Mars or somebody would just have
[2:18:33.520 --> 2:18:39.640]  mugs, they're friendly, you know, it'd be like a neighbor ran up and threw paint on
[2:18:39.640 --> 2:18:42.760]  your face and said, you didn't invite me over for tea, and I'm like, well, if I didn't
[2:18:42.760 --> 2:18:46.000]  know you wanted to come over for tea, I would have had you over for tea, but you've thrown
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:48.720]  paint on me, I'm not going to have you on now.
[2:18:48.720 --> 2:18:53.440]  Okay, you know what, guys, I'm going to twist your arms, go to the bottom of the hour, one
[2:18:53.440 --> 2:18:57.120]  more five-minute segment with both of you, because I want to go to David, Tim, and Josh
[2:18:57.120 --> 2:18:58.120]  and others.
[2:18:58.120 --> 2:18:59.120]  We'll be right back.
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:06.160]  In fact, I'm going to talk behind scenes right now with them for everybody watching
[2:19:06.160 --> 2:19:11.480]  at presentplanet.tv, gentlemen, we're still on the web right now, your game to come in
[2:19:11.480 --> 2:19:13.040]  and do five more minutes, right?
[2:19:13.040 --> 2:19:14.040]  Yes, sir.
[2:19:14.040 --> 2:19:15.680]  No, I'll leave it right this minute.
[2:19:15.680 --> 2:19:20.800]  Well, Jim, I know you're a busy guy, you've got your mom to take over, what, she's 94
[2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:21.800]  now?
[2:19:21.800 --> 2:19:27.760]  Uh, yep, 94, and I know how it is to have places to go and people to see and things
[2:19:27.760 --> 2:19:28.760]  to do, my friend.
[2:19:28.760 --> 2:19:33.600]  No, I'll hang on, my voice seems to be holding out, so I'll give it a go.
[2:19:33.600 --> 2:19:39.160]  Whatever's in the air, I mean, I've had a chest call for like two weeks, and everybody
[2:19:39.160 --> 2:19:43.840]  else I know, so it's just why I'm constantly pausing and can't seem to be as articulate
[2:19:43.840 --> 2:19:49.160]  or silver-tongued as I normally am, because I'm fighting hacking every five seconds.
[2:19:49.160 --> 2:19:56.840]  In fact, that feels better, there we go, but I do appreciate both of you coming on today.
[2:19:56.840 --> 2:20:00.080]  We're on the web right now, and of course it's a fraction of our audience, but in the
[2:20:00.080 --> 2:20:04.440]  aggregate, it turns out I think overall being bigger than even the live radio show, so why
[2:20:04.440 --> 2:20:09.160]  don't you guys take a few minutes out to talk more about your books and videos right now?
[2:20:09.160 --> 2:20:18.120]  Well, from my book, my new book, maybe I'm being self-centered with this, but I think
[2:20:18.120 --> 2:20:23.200]  that virtually everybody who wants the older books already has them, when the new one comes
[2:20:23.200 --> 2:20:31.520]  out, it's going to be all brand new stuff, 800 photographs, and all the information about
[2:20:31.520 --> 2:20:34.840]  it will be on my website, JFKmurder.com.
[2:20:34.840 --> 2:20:36.400]  So it's going to be the Rosetta Stone.
[2:20:36.400 --> 2:20:39.720]  I'll take the time away from Jim right now, I'll just leave it with that.
[2:20:39.720 --> 2:20:43.320]  So it's going to be the Rosetta Stone.
[2:20:43.320 --> 2:20:48.840]  I certainly think so, there's a lot of stuff in there, we've got tons of new photographic
[2:20:48.840 --> 2:20:54.760]  evidence that no one even suspected existed before, and it's going to open up a lot of
[2:20:54.760 --> 2:20:55.760]  people's eyes.
[2:20:55.760 --> 2:21:00.360]  If anyone can look at the new book, and doubt the fact that it was a conspiracy, they're
[2:21:00.360 --> 2:21:03.680]  so close-minded, nothing will get through.
[2:21:03.680 --> 2:21:04.680]  Jim?
[2:21:04.680 --> 2:21:05.680]  Right.
[2:21:05.680 --> 2:21:11.960]  Well, I've already plugged from my book, The Rise of the Fourth Rack.
[2:21:11.960 --> 2:21:14.800]  If you'll read that, I have a whole section in there.
[2:21:14.800 --> 2:21:20.440]  When I began writing about these displaced Nazis who were run out of Europe thanks to
[2:21:20.440 --> 2:21:27.440]  World War II and the heroic and courageous service of our fathers and uncles and grandfathers
[2:21:27.440 --> 2:21:34.160]  who fought to restore freedom in the world, we just simply forced the Nazis to move.
[2:21:34.160 --> 2:21:39.560]  We only defeated the Germans, and they were brought over here by the same people on Wall
[2:21:39.560 --> 2:21:45.080]  Street and in the Eastern establishment who had funded Hitler before during the war.
[2:21:45.080 --> 2:21:46.640]  Well, that's what I'm going to say.
[2:21:46.640 --> 2:21:50.240]  Your book actually even exposes some of the Zionist connection to all of that, and then
[2:21:50.240 --> 2:21:52.880]  people that haven't even read it are attacking you.
[2:21:52.880 --> 2:21:56.960]  I'm sure you're aware of this saying, you're covering up, you're saying it's all a Germanic
[2:21:56.960 --> 2:21:57.960]  thing.
[2:21:57.960 --> 2:22:02.200]  When you're explaining it's a system of government and control by the international bankers.
[2:22:02.200 --> 2:22:03.640]  I'm just so tired.
[2:22:03.640 --> 2:22:07.800]  Well, they're not thinking past a certain level.
[2:22:07.800 --> 2:22:15.240]  When I talk about Nazis, Nazi is an acronym in the German language for National Socialism,
[2:22:15.240 --> 2:22:21.760]  and today for eight years now we've had National Socialism governing this country, and you see
[2:22:21.760 --> 2:22:22.760]  where it's gotten us.
[2:22:22.760 --> 2:22:27.280]  In fact, we're following right in the footsteps of Germany in the 1930s.
[2:22:27.280 --> 2:22:32.880]  They are wrecking the economy when the economy gets so bad and they push us into the amaro.
[2:22:32.880 --> 2:22:37.040]  They're going to say, well, give us the power, we'll straighten this out, and we'll be right
[2:22:37.040 --> 2:22:41.840]  into a Nazi type situation.
[2:22:41.840 --> 2:22:47.880]  The only thing we've done this year is swap National Socialism for Marxist Socialism,
[2:22:47.880 --> 2:22:55.840]  but at the very top, it's the same wealthy ruling bunch that runs both sides.
[2:22:55.840 --> 2:23:02.040]  But the establishment wants us to all in-fight about different branches of the same structure.
[2:23:02.040 --> 2:23:06.480]  We're fighting over whether there was somebody on the grassy knoll, or how many people were
[2:23:06.480 --> 2:23:07.480]  shooting at Kennedy.
[2:23:07.480 --> 2:23:08.480]  Here we go.
[2:23:08.480 --> 2:23:09.480]  Here we go.
[2:23:09.480 --> 2:23:10.480]  We're going back live.
[2:23:10.480 --> 2:23:11.480]  Here we go.
[2:23:11.480 --> 2:23:18.040]  Jim, we were talking behind the scenes at Prison Planet Dot TV.
[2:23:18.040 --> 2:23:20.720]  I want you to finish your point that we're going to take a few final calls.
[2:23:20.720 --> 2:23:23.760]  We've only got five minutes left with both of you, and I'll see you both this weekend
[2:23:23.760 --> 2:23:25.960]  up in Dallas for the 45th anniversary.
[2:23:25.960 --> 2:23:29.160]  You were talking about, we're still fighting about men on the grassy knoll, or did they
[2:23:29.160 --> 2:23:34.240]  go to the moon, when openly, World Bank system is setting up world government.
[2:23:34.240 --> 2:23:37.120]  They're openly announcing, and it's on the news.
[2:23:37.120 --> 2:23:38.120]  It's just incredible.
[2:23:38.120 --> 2:23:39.120]  Finish your point.
[2:23:39.120 --> 2:23:40.120]  Right.
[2:23:40.120 --> 2:23:43.040]  Well, in the case of the Kennedy assassination, here's the bottom line.
[2:23:43.040 --> 2:23:50.960]  I'll be the first to admit that no one can stay for absolute certainty with absolute proof
[2:23:50.960 --> 2:23:55.400]  how many people were shooting at Kennedy, who they were, who paid them, where they came
[2:23:55.400 --> 2:23:57.120]  from, where they went to.
[2:23:57.120 --> 2:24:02.760]  But what we can show and document beyond any reasonable shadow of a doubt is that the
[2:24:02.760 --> 2:24:07.760]  truth of the conspiracy to kill Kennedy has been covered up at the level of the federal
[2:24:07.760 --> 2:24:10.000]  government of the United States.
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:15.000]  We can prove that there was alteration of evidence, destruction of evidence, suppression
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:20.120]  of evidence, fabrication of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses, all of which are
[2:24:20.120 --> 2:24:23.640]  crimes under our legal system.
[2:24:23.640 --> 2:24:30.600]  And Alex, Robert, folks, that's what transforms, which at that time was only another Texas
[2:24:30.600 --> 2:24:34.080]  homicide into a national coup d'etat.
[2:24:34.080 --> 2:24:35.080]  Absolutely.
[2:24:35.080 --> 2:24:37.880]  Let's take a few final calls here.
[2:24:37.880 --> 2:24:39.880]  Let's talk to Josh in Illinois.
[2:24:39.880 --> 2:24:40.880]  You're on the air.
[2:24:40.880 --> 2:24:41.880]  Go ahead, Josh.
[2:24:41.880 --> 2:24:46.640]  Alex, you had Jim earlier.
[2:24:46.640 --> 2:24:52.440]  If he knew of, or you asked him if there's, if he knew of any way they would come after
[2:24:52.440 --> 2:24:58.720]  you or potentially take you out, and I have a probable scenario in the event that our
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:07.160]  current president, in fact, Obama, is taken out in a similar fashion as JFK was, it would
[2:25:07.160 --> 2:25:15.160]  not be difficult to use sound bites from your show and air them on CNN and Fox News and
[2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:18.160]  place the blame on your show and effectively take you off the air.
[2:25:18.160 --> 2:25:19.160]  No, it's just crazy.
[2:25:19.160 --> 2:25:20.760]  I appreciate your call.
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:24.760]  And a meteorite could come through the ceiling and kill me from Planet Pop-Tart right now,
[2:25:24.760 --> 2:25:29.960]  or puff the magic dragon could come flapping by because, I mean, we're not on this show
[2:25:29.960 --> 2:25:32.680]  talking about hurting anybody or shooting anybody.
[2:25:32.680 --> 2:25:34.840]  Of course we're, hold on, hold on.
[2:25:34.840 --> 2:25:39.040]  Now we shouldn't even talk about the JFK assassination because they could edit us to
[2:25:39.040 --> 2:25:41.120]  make it sound like we're talking about Obama.
[2:25:41.120 --> 2:25:44.560]  I mean, this is the type of just fear everyone is locked in.
[2:25:44.560 --> 2:25:45.560]  Go ahead.
[2:25:45.560 --> 2:25:46.560]  Yeah, that's right.
[2:25:46.560 --> 2:25:52.400]  No, I'll tell you, over and above, they're not going to take you out because if you suddenly
[2:25:52.400 --> 2:25:59.240]  disappeared under any kind of unusual circumstances or a strange one-car accident or something
[2:25:59.240 --> 2:26:04.000]  like that, all that's going to do is add credibility to your message.
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:05.760]  So they're smarter than that.
[2:26:05.760 --> 2:26:06.760]  Let's take a final...
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:07.760]  Go ahead.
[2:26:07.760 --> 2:26:16.360]  What probably will happen to you, Alex, is that under the Obama-Marxist Socialist regime,
[2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:22.520]  they will push heavily to outlaw hate speech and, you know, in that way...
[2:26:22.520 --> 2:26:23.520]  And the fairness doctrine...
[2:26:23.520 --> 2:26:25.000]  They would be considered hate speech.
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:28.040]  And the fairness doctrine, absolutely, and that it's liberal, so you've got to be for
[2:26:28.040 --> 2:26:29.040]  it.
[2:26:29.040 --> 2:26:31.080]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Oklahoma.
[2:26:31.080 --> 2:26:33.680]  Chris, you're on the air with Jim Mars and Mr. Groton.
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:34.680]  Go ahead.
[2:26:34.680 --> 2:26:35.680]  Hi, Alex.
[2:26:35.680 --> 2:26:36.680]  Chris from Oklahoma City.
[2:26:36.680 --> 2:26:41.200]  I've had the opportunity to speak with you at presentations at Jim in Washington and
[2:26:41.200 --> 2:26:42.200]  Austin.
[2:26:42.200 --> 2:26:43.200]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:46.760]  I want to thank all of you gentlemen for the work you're doing because it's making it a
[2:26:46.760 --> 2:26:50.960]  lot easier for us here in Oklahoma City to continue to research the bombing, working
[2:26:50.960 --> 2:26:54.880]  closely with former state representative who's actually back in the state office.
[2:26:54.880 --> 2:26:59.520]  He was sworn back in three days ago, just FYI, and with Jesse Trenadu.
[2:26:59.520 --> 2:27:04.320]  And the question I had is, I was down at the Schoolbook of Auditory Library oddly enough
[2:27:04.320 --> 2:27:09.320]  this last Friday, and I see the same storyline, the same mode of operation happening at the
[2:27:09.320 --> 2:27:15.880]  National Memorial Museum here in Oklahoma City, do you think that we'll be able to crack
[2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:19.040]  the case and get the information out the way it should be?
[2:27:19.040 --> 2:27:23.440]  On the inside job that was the OKC government sponsored terror attack to try to shut down
[2:27:23.440 --> 2:27:29.400]  free speech, I mean they use these little museums as their official story brainwashing
[2:27:29.400 --> 2:27:30.400]  centers.
[2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:34.000]  Jim and Robert real fast finishing up.
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:36.760]  Well, yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:41.520]  Again, it's appeal to authority, they have all the money so they can build these museums
[2:27:41.520 --> 2:27:48.480]  and mount these very well presented exhibits to push their official storyline.
[2:27:48.480 --> 2:27:54.560]  All I can say is everyone who's listening, study, study, read, open your eyes and ears
[2:27:54.560 --> 2:27:57.800]  and your mind and think for yourself.
[2:27:57.800 --> 2:28:02.920]  Don't let somebody, we don't let the people with all the money do your thinking for you.
[2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:08.440]  Absolutely, and in closing, and I appreciate your call Chris, we're out of time, in closing
[2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:10.520]  Robert Groden, you've got the last word.
[2:28:10.520 --> 2:28:17.560]  Well, I'll simply quote two lines very quickly, one that I've used for years and years as
[2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:23.160]  may all the truth be known soon, and one that Jim has used as long as I've known him now,
[2:28:23.160 --> 2:28:30.960]  which is approaching 30 years I think, question authority, always question authority.
[2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:35.520]  Absolutely, well, guys, let me say bye to you when we end this segment and I'll see
[2:28:35.520 --> 2:28:41.520]  you this this weekend, and it's just a great working with Robert Groden and Jim Mars on
[2:28:41.520 --> 2:28:45.800]  this new JFK film I'm making.
[2:28:45.800 --> 2:28:49.480]  We'll basically conclude shooting coming up this weekend and then just finish the film
[2:28:49.480 --> 2:28:52.960]  up the next four or five months, we'll be right back.
[2:28:52.960 --> 2:28:54.560]  We're on the March.
[2:28:54.560 --> 2:28:56.120]  The Empire is on the run.
[2:28:56.120 --> 2:29:01.520]  Okay, guys, I just want to make sure we're still on air right now, Robert, did I ever
[2:29:01.520 --> 2:29:04.640]  get your cell phone so I can stay in contact with you when you're in Dallas or I guess
[2:29:04.640 --> 2:29:05.640]  I'll just see you at the Null?
[2:29:05.640 --> 2:29:09.480]  Well, when they first called me today, they called me on my cell phone, so you do have
[2:29:09.480 --> 2:29:10.480]  that.
[2:29:10.480 --> 2:29:11.480]  Okay, great.
[2:29:11.480 --> 2:29:14.480]  So I guess we need to make sure we have your other number on our computer.
[2:29:14.480 --> 2:29:19.800]  And Jim, we've got your cell phone, so I'll see you out there Saturday as well.
[2:29:19.800 --> 2:29:25.880]  Okay, I'm going according to your people, I'll meet you out there about 11 o'clock
[2:29:25.880 --> 2:29:26.880]  tonight.
[2:29:26.880 --> 2:29:27.880]  All right, buddy.
[2:29:27.880 --> 2:29:28.880]  We'll see you then.
[2:29:28.880 --> 2:29:29.880]  Okay, bye-bye.
[2:29:29.880 --> 2:29:30.880]  Thank you, Jim.
[2:29:30.880 --> 2:29:31.880]  Thank you, Robert.
[2:29:31.880 --> 2:29:32.880]  Take care.
[2:29:32.880 --> 2:29:33.880]  Thanks a lot.
[2:29:33.880 --> 2:29:34.880]  Bye-bye.
[2:29:34.880 --> 2:29:35.880]  All right, bye-bye.
[2:29:35.880 --> 2:29:36.880]  All right, I'm going to take a two-minute break.
[2:29:36.880 --> 2:29:40.640]  I haven't had one in about an hour and we'll be right back with more phone calls and more
[2:29:40.640 --> 2:29:41.640]  news.
[2:29:41.640 --> 2:29:42.640]  Stay with me.
[2:29:42.640 --> 2:30:00.160]  All right, I'm going to take a two-minute break and we'll be right back with more phone
[2:30:00.160 --> 2:30:02.320]  calls and more news.
[2:30:02.320 --> 2:30:16.440]  All right, I'm going to take a two-minute break and we'll be right back with more phone calls
[2:30:16.440 --> 2:30:17.440]  and more news.
[2:30:17.440 --> 2:30:29.440]  All right, I'm going to take a two-minute break and we'll be right back with more phone calls
[2:30:29.440 --> 2:30:30.440]  and more news.
[2:30:30.440 --> 2:30:36.280]  Thanks a lot and good-bye.
[2:31:00.440 --> 2:31:02.560]  the revolution of the next level.
[2:31:02.560 --> 2:31:08.320]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around
[2:31:08.320 --> 2:31:11.880]  the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[2:31:11.880 --> 2:31:16.240]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic
[2:31:16.240 --> 2:31:19.960]  diseases from these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[2:31:19.960 --> 2:31:24.720]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[2:31:24.720 --> 2:31:27.320]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[2:31:27.320 --> 2:31:32.040]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning and high cholesterol naturally
[2:31:32.040 --> 2:31:37.480]  and safely by mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder also known as FPP with your favorite
[2:31:37.480 --> 2:31:38.800]  beverage once a day.
[2:31:38.800 --> 2:31:44.360]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses and is now available to you from Freshwater
[2:31:44.360 --> 2:31:45.360]  Organics.
[2:31:45.360 --> 2:31:50.000]  FPP strengthens skin, hair and bones, lowers cholesterol and is an excellent source of
[2:31:50.000 --> 2:31:53.320]  natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.
[2:31:53.320 --> 2:31:55.480]  Order some today at FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[2:31:55.480 --> 2:32:03.160]  Again, that's FreshwaterOrganics.com or call 888-949-3570.
[2:32:03.160 --> 2:32:05.760]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[2:32:05.760 --> 2:32:13.600]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:32:13.600 --> 2:32:28.520]  Okay, coming up later, I'm going to play a few clips from in-game 1.5.
[2:32:28.520 --> 2:32:33.720]  The extras that we posted on PrisonPlanet.tv because one of the clips I played on a Sunday
[2:32:33.720 --> 2:32:39.160]  show, it's Dr. Michael Kaufman talking about, from government documents giving the source,
[2:32:39.160 --> 2:32:44.040]  how they plan to mass-drug us, dumb us down, control us, break up our families.
[2:32:44.040 --> 2:32:46.880]  And the other clip I'm only going to play part of, and there's a bunch more in the film
[2:32:46.880 --> 2:32:50.760]  and in the extras, where Daniel Oslin and others are talking about exactly.
[2:32:50.760 --> 2:32:58.080]  Now, this is two and a half years ago when oil was $65 a barrel.
[2:32:58.080 --> 2:33:05.760]  And he said they're going to drive it up to 150 in a year and a half from now.
[2:33:05.760 --> 2:33:10.640]  Really that happened, to get people out of their cars to have a post-industrial society.
[2:33:10.640 --> 2:33:12.680]  He talks more about that in the piece.
[2:33:12.680 --> 2:33:19.800]  He talks about how they're going to artificially drive the stock market back up to its, and
[2:33:19.800 --> 2:33:23.320]  he gives the year level when it was at, you know, $13,000.
[2:33:23.320 --> 2:33:24.320]  They did.
[2:33:24.320 --> 2:33:28.120]  They drove it to $14,000 to sucker everybody back in and then pop the subprime mortgage
[2:33:28.120 --> 2:33:30.240]  and he even gives the times.
[2:33:30.240 --> 2:33:35.240]  Now, that is exactly, that is not prophecy.
[2:33:35.240 --> 2:33:38.360]  That is not revelation.
[2:33:38.360 --> 2:33:44.920]  It is someone having eyewitness reports from the people that run the planet.
[2:33:44.920 --> 2:33:49.600]  That's how we could get on air and say they are going to devalue currencies worldwide.
[2:33:49.600 --> 2:33:51.480]  They are going to cut off liquidity.
[2:33:51.480 --> 2:33:55.080]  They are going to plunge the market so they can criminally consolidate and then propose
[2:33:55.080 --> 2:34:00.440]  after they started it, after they created it, after they destroyed the confidence by
[2:34:00.440 --> 2:34:02.760]  fair monitoring and saying we're going to have a depression.
[2:34:02.760 --> 2:34:08.120]  They will then say we need a world banking system run by us, small group of inter-banks,
[2:34:08.120 --> 2:34:12.600]  setting the value of the currencies worldwide, controlling stock markets, and paying global
[2:34:12.600 --> 2:34:16.880]  money transfer taxes and carbon taxes to the private banks.
[2:34:16.880 --> 2:34:18.400]  That has now all been proposed.
[2:34:18.400 --> 2:34:20.680]  That is all in, in game.
[2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:25.360]  Blueprint for global enslavement and its extra that's on the DVD and then the second extra
[2:34:25.360 --> 2:34:31.400]  that was for prisonplanet.tv members.
[2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:34.840]  So this is what we're dealing with here.
[2:34:34.840 --> 2:34:36.160]  This is reality.
[2:34:36.160 --> 2:34:38.400]  We understand what's going on in this show.
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:42.960]  We're telling you what's really going on in the world.
[2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:48.560]  So I want to go to David, Tim, John, Eric, and Max before the hour ends.
[2:34:48.560 --> 2:34:49.920]  I want to get into Paulson.
[2:34:49.920 --> 2:34:55.960]  Was behind bailout, martial law plan, and then I want to start airing these audio clips.
[2:34:55.960 --> 2:35:04.560]  And what we know the so-called government is doing, the global technocratic banking
[2:35:04.560 --> 2:35:13.200]  elite merged with its scientific social engineer elite, is hard for me to mentally face and
[2:35:13.200 --> 2:35:15.200]  deal with.
[2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:19.400]  So I don't blame a lot of you living in denial.
[2:35:19.400 --> 2:35:22.280]  Projecting what they've planned in the past, what they've done, what they're currently
[2:35:22.280 --> 2:35:28.840]  doing, what we, projecting into what we think they're doing, I don't even want to say.
[2:35:28.840 --> 2:35:32.520]  I mean, these people are bad.
[2:35:32.520 --> 2:35:34.320]  I mean, it's so low down.
[2:35:34.320 --> 2:35:44.200]  It takes evil to a level just that Hollywood, the culture, books, novels, and fiction couldn't
[2:35:44.200 --> 2:35:46.320]  take you.
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:53.680]  Hell, Lenin killing 20 million, Stalin killing 40 million, and Hitler killing tens of millions,
[2:35:53.680 --> 2:35:59.280]  and Mao killing tens of millions.
[2:35:59.280 --> 2:36:03.160]  Thousands of sports stadiums filled with 100,000 people per stadium, you know, that equivalent.
[2:36:03.160 --> 2:36:04.160]  Picture that in your mind.
[2:36:04.160 --> 2:36:10.000]  I mean, that's hard to deal with, but this is far past even that, what's going on.
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:13.840]  And the people living in denial is what has allowed this to happen.
[2:36:13.840 --> 2:36:17.720]  So we're going to get into all that before I go to your phone calls and all this other
[2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:19.920]  news.
[2:36:19.920 --> 2:36:29.480]  Don't forget this holiday season, this Christmas, you can get five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv

[2:40:41.880 --> 2:40:45.320]  Let's go ahead and go to some of your phone calls, again we're live at prismplanet.tv
[2:40:45.320 --> 2:40:49.080]  right now, David in Texas, you're on the air.
[2:40:49.080 --> 2:40:53.600]  I just want to give you an example here of how asleep a lot of people are, I work in
[2:40:53.600 --> 2:41:01.680]  the financial community and I was at a conference a few weeks back and most of these advisors
[2:41:01.680 --> 2:41:06.640]  that are actually advising clients and also product companies, they have no fundamental
[2:41:06.640 --> 2:41:11.280]  understanding of what's going on, two easy examples that people can see, I was talking
[2:41:11.280 --> 2:41:19.560]  to the people throughout the few days around me about carbon taxes implemented or coming
[2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:26.760]  soon and everyone said that's impossible, that'll never happen and I say well look,
[2:41:26.760 --> 2:41:32.680]  there already is established the Chicago climate exchange, the Montreal climate exchange, the
[2:41:32.680 --> 2:41:34.040]  European climate exchange.
[2:41:34.040 --> 2:41:40.640]  They've introduced bills to start taxing every pig and every cow, what for a cow it's
[2:41:40.640 --> 2:41:47.440]  $125 less with a pig for its methane, for its flatulence, creatures have always been
[2:41:47.440 --> 2:41:52.280]  passing gas but it's just pure bull.
[2:41:52.280 --> 2:41:59.680]  And these are already institutions and things set up ready to go and people thought I was
[2:41:59.680 --> 2:42:03.720]  crazy as like well look it up on your computer, I mean these things are out there but the
[2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:09.720]  more, the thing that's actually more scary is the manipulation in the financial reporting,
[2:42:09.720 --> 2:42:16.160]  let me give you a quick example, 10 years ago when companies or analysts or news agencies
[2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:21.200]  would report their earnings, they would always report a year over year, they would say our
[2:42:21.200 --> 2:42:31.160]  earnings are $1 a share, first quarter this year versus $0.90 last year, first quarter.
[2:42:31.160 --> 2:42:36.120]  With the internet boom, most of these companies had no history so in the financial reporting
[2:42:36.120 --> 2:42:40.920]  everyone's moved over to, they look at the analysts, what the analysts say and it's you
[2:42:40.920 --> 2:42:46.040]  know, JP Morgan, all these different companies, they've got all the analysts, well they totally
[2:42:46.040 --> 2:42:51.600]  manipulate their data and it's really easy to see, a simple example anyone can understand
[2:42:51.600 --> 2:43:00.200]  is look at the earnings for any company before they report, what happens is you can look
[2:43:00.200 --> 2:43:04.960]  back at Lehman Brothers, this is a perfect example, first quarter this year, these aren't
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:11.720]  the specific numbers but this is to show you how it works, the analysts estimate they say
[2:43:11.720 --> 2:43:17.720]  we think their earnings are going to be $1 per share, okay, pretty much on Wall Street
[2:43:17.720 --> 2:43:21.800]  a lot of the information gets thrown around before it's actually reported for the public
[2:43:21.800 --> 2:43:30.880]  so word gets out and they find out hey, their profits are actually only going to be $0.70
[2:43:30.880 --> 2:43:37.400]  a share so what do the analysts do, they drop their estimates very severe so that a couple
[2:43:37.400 --> 2:43:42.960]  of weeks from then it gets reported in the news hey, you know, this company's earnings
[2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:49.520]  were $0.70 a share versus the analysts estimate of $0.60 a share, they beat the estimates
[2:43:49.520 --> 2:43:54.800]  and everyone piles in and drives a stock up but what they didn't tell you was hey, two
[2:43:54.800 --> 2:44:02.360]  weeks ago the analysts were actually estimating $1 and now they're estimating $0.60 and the
[2:44:02.360 --> 2:44:08.080]  other thing is they never will tell you that they just typically don't report in the media
[2:44:08.080 --> 2:44:14.880]  they say look, the year previous the earnings were actually $1.40 so they haven't beaten
[2:44:14.880 --> 2:44:20.760]  anything, no I mean if you go through all the ways they cook the numbers it'll just
[2:44:20.760 --> 2:44:24.800]  make your head spin, I mean it's like now when cops kill people with tasers they just
[2:44:24.800 --> 2:44:28.640]  say it's a syndrome, people just magically die now and police custody, it's not being
[2:44:28.640 --> 2:44:33.960]  beaten, it's not being tasered, it's a new syndrome, I mean it's just, it's just made
[2:44:33.960 --> 2:44:37.360]  up bull, I appreciate your call, I could talk to you for hours, great caller but we need
[2:44:37.360 --> 2:44:43.840]  to get to everybody else here, let's go back to the calls, Tim in Florida you're on the
[2:44:43.840 --> 2:44:44.840]  air.
[2:44:44.840 --> 2:44:49.160]  Hello Alex, back in the 80s before there was a program like yours where people could call
[2:44:49.160 --> 2:44:54.440]  in and report terrible violations of civil liberties, I found out about some atrocities
[2:44:54.440 --> 2:44:59.440]  that I don't think have ever been reported in the general media, in those days I used
[2:44:59.440 --> 2:45:04.000]  to, my way of avoiding society was just going out and traveling around the country just
[2:45:04.000 --> 2:45:08.720]  hitchhiking around and I started to notice that the state troopers in Wyoming on the
[2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:13.920]  stretch of IAE between Laramie and Evanston were doing everything they could to provoke
[2:45:13.920 --> 2:45:18.800]  me in such a way that they would have an excuse to kill me and so when I got home to Tennessee
[2:45:18.800 --> 2:45:23.200]  I told my father who was a federal judge that I guarantee you the Wyoming Highway Patrol
[2:45:23.200 --> 2:45:28.400]  are murdering drifters and he said well I'll go over here across the hall to the US Marshals
[2:45:28.400 --> 2:45:34.160]  office and ask him to check into it for us and so later on in the day he comes back over
[2:45:34.160 --> 2:45:39.640]  to me and says well you're right there's five cases being investigated by the FBI right
[2:45:39.640 --> 2:45:47.120]  now of Wyoming Highway Patrol murdering drifters and I don't think that's ever come out I think
[2:45:47.120 --> 2:45:54.240]  if our family members have ever lost relatives who are misfits or mentally ill or whatever
[2:45:54.240 --> 2:45:59.240]  that they might want to know about that well I mean it's true the troops are coming home
[2:45:59.240 --> 2:46:04.160]  at three four five tours completely I mean you know World War two vets Korean war vets
[2:46:04.160 --> 2:46:09.000]  you know would go off and kill the neighbor from one tour you know their fuse gets very
[2:46:09.000 --> 2:46:13.160]  short and these guys are coming home and their cops and they're killing their families
[2:46:13.160 --> 2:46:17.640]  it's in the news every day they're killing us I mean you just back talk them they just
[2:46:17.640 --> 2:46:20.680]  pull their gun out and shoot you or beat you to death and they laugh about it and then
[2:46:20.680 --> 2:46:25.000]  they don't get in trouble and you know and then the banks don't get in trouble for taking
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:29.440]  all our money either that's what tyranny is they just go look we rule it's over we're
[2:46:29.440 --> 2:46:35.880]  king America's gone bye bye right I think people need to be careful how they pick their
[2:46:35.880 --> 2:46:42.360]  battles because that I think I've seen articles on your website that prepare people for this
[2:46:42.360 --> 2:46:46.200]  thought this regime is coming in because they will just blow your head off you know if you
[2:46:46.200 --> 2:46:53.040]  smart off to them you know they're just looking for you know I mean America is a big doormat
[2:46:53.040 --> 2:46:58.600]  or or or more like a toilet and and and if you don't sit there loving it falling on you
[2:46:58.600 --> 2:47:04.720]  you're bad you're a terrorist and a lot worse than people realize I believe because the
[2:47:04.720 --> 2:47:09.360]  only the poor people in poor black people put up with this for many years you know and
[2:47:09.360 --> 2:47:13.120]  people that live on the street you know they just get blown away and nobody knows about
[2:47:13.120 --> 2:47:17.720]  it but now it's coming into the yuppies and people like that are going to be feeling the
[2:47:17.720 --> 2:47:22.080]  same thing that just used to be doled out to the the unfortunate you know that's right
[2:47:22.080 --> 2:47:28.680]  I appreciate your call John in Illinois you're on the air welcome well you know I was looking
[2:47:28.680 --> 2:47:33.080]  at your first that first car talk about the market I think he's got a right in the spirit
[2:47:33.080 --> 2:47:36.080]  but I've worked in the financial industry for a couple years now and I've worked with
[2:47:36.080 --> 2:47:41.160]  some of the major brokerages like Lehman and it's it's similar to that but it's actually
[2:47:41.160 --> 2:47:45.120]  if you look at the financial reporting if you look at the way they value stock prices
[2:47:45.120 --> 2:47:51.840]  it's all based on assumptions of future cash flow and I can change the stock price by $20
[2:47:51.840 --> 2:47:58.240]  by changing one assumption on the internal rate of return by a company yeah I mean I
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:03.400]  mean they value it by how much it makes a year and then projected what market analysts
[2:48:03.400 --> 2:48:08.400]  are saying about that industry in the future and it's multiples of the price earnings ratio
[2:48:08.400 --> 2:48:12.800]  right and so they come back but you also look at like what happened the market most of time
[2:48:12.800 --> 2:48:17.760]  when they issue earnings great earnings you'll see it pop up for a second but then you know
[2:48:17.760 --> 2:48:24.400]  you did a study on Kramer and most of the time if you shorted his his stuff you know
[2:48:24.400 --> 2:48:30.120]  they would you'd make money but then two weeks later right if you were long you'd make the
[2:48:30.120 --> 2:48:34.200]  money because they're all looking for that short-term pop all the pros are selling into
[2:48:34.200 --> 2:48:40.440]  that yeah they tell the suckers staying for the long term so the pros can make money on
[2:48:40.440 --> 2:48:45.400]  the ups and downs and they also make money in the long term as well but if you look at
[2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:49.440]  the pits and you know because I worked with the board of trade and the market deal exchange
[2:48:49.440 --> 2:48:54.200]  they're so crooked and corrupt in the pits and they're insider trading all the time and
[2:48:54.200 --> 2:48:58.440]  making millions and a lot of times what you'll see is when they're when there's guys and
[2:48:58.440 --> 2:49:02.880]  they're making markets that even the locals on the floor get hosed by Morgan's failings
[2:49:02.880 --> 2:49:07.960]  of the world because what'll happen is they'll come in for a trade and they'll make the trade
[2:49:07.960 --> 2:49:12.240]  and the local will make a tick or two and you know the customer will have their giant
[2:49:12.240 --> 2:49:15.560]  order filled but then the guy will come back to them 10 minutes later and say hey you've
[2:49:15.560 --> 2:49:18.720]  got to make this change otherwise you know we're not going to trade with you again because
[2:49:18.720 --> 2:49:23.280]  our customer wants a better price even the locals on the floor they've changed guys making
[2:49:23.280 --> 2:49:27.960]  a lot of money or still can hose by the big banks I mean it's not that's right they make
[2:49:27.960 --> 2:49:32.680]  them turn deals in and change them that they had exactly and then what happened was a couple
[2:49:32.680 --> 2:49:37.720]  years ago the FBI did an investigation that after the bell trading because the bell sounds
[2:49:37.720 --> 2:49:42.120]  at three o'clock and then you've got to be done trading on the pit well what was happening
[2:49:42.120 --> 2:49:45.720]  was people might have made trades a couple minutes you know like 20 seconds later something
[2:49:45.720 --> 2:49:51.040]  like that and so they put a bunch of FBI guys down in the pits and they did this investigation
[2:49:51.040 --> 2:49:54.080]  to try to find you know what's going on what's going on well and I want to hear more about

[2:56:08.520 --> 2:56:12.320]  if we didn't do this if we didn't do this we were going to see something on the scale
[2:56:12.320 --> 2:56:15.800]  of the uh... the depression we were to do there were people that were talking about
[2:56:15.800 --> 2:56:20.520]  uh... you know marshal law being instituted uh... civil unrest all these kinds of who

[2:56:52.600 --> 2:56:56.400]  that we face it's far going to be far worse than the great depression of the thirties
[2:56:56.400 --> 2:57:01.080]  and uh... all these things he's very descriptive exactly what would happen if
[2:57:01.080 --> 2:57:06.640]  if we didn't buy out these toxic assets which he abandoned the the day after he got the

[3:01:28.920 --> 3:01:32.880]  he said calculations of the future and how to modify it or no longer considered
[3:01:32.880 --> 3:01:35.660]  to be an obscure academic pursuit
[3:01:35.660 --> 3:01:38.800]  long-range planning and implementation of plans will be made by a
[3:01:38.800 --> 3:01:40.960]  technological scientific elite
[3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:44.400]  this will strain the democratic fabric to the ripping point
[3:01:44.400 --> 3:01:48.760]  the protestant ethic will add to be as more and more enjoyed a very leisure and
[3:01:48.760 --> 3:01:50.440]  guaranteed sustenance
[3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:54.080]  work as a means to an end of living will be managed
[3:01:54.080 --> 3:01:56.160]  most people will tend to be hedonistic
[3:01:56.160 --> 3:01:59.800]  and a dominant elite will provide the bread and circuses to keep social
[3:01:59.800 --> 3:02:02.480]  dissension and disruption to add a minimum
[3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:05.680]  a small elite will carry society's burdens
[3:02:05.680 --> 3:02:09.080]  the resulting in personal manipulation of most people's lifestyles will be
[3:02:09.080 --> 3:02:12.400]  softened by provision for pleasure seeking and guaranteed physical
[3:02:12.400 --> 3:02:13.720]  necessities
[3:02:13.720 --> 3:02:17.400]  the controlling elite will engage in power plays largely without the
[3:02:17.400 --> 3:02:19.400]  involvement of most of the people
[3:02:19.400 --> 3:02:21.240]  and that is so true today
[3:02:21.240 --> 3:02:25.280]  most people have no idea what's going on in the international arena have none
[3:02:25.280 --> 3:02:28.200]  almost all of this is being done in secrecy
[3:02:28.200 --> 3:02:29.720]  going on with this report
[3:02:29.720 --> 3:02:33.760]  the society will be a leisurely one people will study play and travel some
[3:02:33.760 --> 3:02:37.640]  will be in various stages of the drug induced experiences
[3:02:37.640 --> 3:02:41.920]  each individual will receive at birth a multi-purpose identification which will
[3:02:41.920 --> 3:02:43.480]  have amongst other things
[3:02:43.480 --> 3:02:46.280]  extensive communications and control uses
[3:02:46.280 --> 3:02:49.840]  each individual be saturated with ideas of information
[3:02:49.840 --> 3:02:54.000]  each will be self-selected other kinds will be imposed overtly
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:57.300]  by those who assume the responsibility for the others actions
[3:02:57.300 --> 3:03:01.600]  relatively few individuals will be able to maintain control over their opinions
[3:03:01.600 --> 3:03:05.720]  most will be ponds of competing opinion molders
[3:03:05.720 --> 3:03:06.920]  it's amazing
[3:03:06.920 --> 3:03:10.640]  how back in the nineteen sixties they begin the process
[3:03:10.640 --> 3:03:14.200]  of getting us to where we are right now if you look at society today
[3:03:14.200 --> 3:03:17.320]  almost every one of the characteristics that i've read
[3:03:17.320 --> 3:03:20.280]  have come true we are living in a planned society
[3:03:20.280 --> 3:03:21.400]  we are living
[3:03:21.400 --> 3:03:22.880]  focused on leisure
[3:03:22.880 --> 3:03:24.200]  and recreation
[3:03:24.200 --> 3:03:26.360]  we live in a drug induced society
[3:03:26.360 --> 3:03:29.240]  all of the things that they talked about in the nineteen sixties have become a
[3:03:29.240 --> 3:03:31.960]  reality by the twenty first century
[3:03:31.960 --> 3:03:35.240]  this is the level of extent of control that they have
[3:03:35.240 --> 3:03:39.880]  most people's opinions are not done by through education and through knowledge
[3:03:39.880 --> 3:03:40.920]  they're done by
[3:03:40.920 --> 3:03:42.980]  molding your ideas
[3:03:42.980 --> 3:03:47.320]  and you and that's why it's very hard for the average person to understand
[3:03:47.320 --> 3:03:51.640]  the fact that we're moving into a global society that is totally controlled
[3:03:51.640 --> 3:03:52.880]  by puppeteers
[3:03:52.880 --> 3:03:54.520]  the global elite
[3:03:54.520 --> 3:03:59.520]  and moving towards our ultimate objective of having world government
[3:03:59.520 --> 3:04:03.320]  we'll be right back
[3:04:03.320 --> 3:04:05.160]  hello this is steve shank

[3:07:00.400 --> 3:07:01.720]  in the john
[3:07:01.720 --> 3:07:03.360]  uh... it's got about a minute left

[3:07:23.360 --> 3:07:26.480]  uh... some other news jam packed final hour here

[3:07:29.800 --> 3:07:32.920]  uh... i wanted to finish up the doctor michael kaufman clip and then another
[3:07:32.920 --> 3:07:35.600]  clip from in game so here it is
[3:07:35.600 --> 3:07:39.040]  they have created various crises along the way over the last one hundred years
[3:07:39.040 --> 3:07:42.800]  world war one as we've talked about was contrived world war two was contrived
[3:07:42.800 --> 3:07:45.600]  we got the united nations as a result of world war two
[3:07:45.600 --> 3:07:47.360]  which is one of their big goals
[3:07:47.360 --> 3:07:50.320]  even though they denied the fact that they ever intended to have the united
[3:07:50.320 --> 3:07:53.680]  nations as a world government some of the more esoteric documents show very
[3:07:53.680 --> 3:07:56.120]  clearly that's what they intended right from the start
[3:07:56.120 --> 3:07:59.600]  we're starting to see that now with the commission on global governance all
[3:07:59.600 --> 3:08:02.760]  the international treaties that we're looking at especially the environmental
[3:08:02.760 --> 3:08:03.600]  treaties
[3:08:03.600 --> 3:08:07.560]  basically are like these strands over gulliver and gulliver's travels
[3:08:07.560 --> 3:08:11.560]  one strand is not necessarily trappers but when you have hundreds of these
[3:08:11.560 --> 3:08:14.880]  international treaties and all of these regulations when you have
[3:08:14.880 --> 3:08:18.320]  the north american union where you give up your basic sovereignty to a group of
[3:08:18.320 --> 3:08:19.920]  international bureaucrats
[3:08:19.920 --> 3:08:21.120]  all of these things
[3:08:21.120 --> 3:08:25.400]  our strands that literally ties down to the point that we no longer have
[3:08:25.400 --> 3:08:26.080]  freedom
[3:08:26.080 --> 3:08:29.520]  to cause development we no longer have our economic freedom we no longer have a
[3:08:29.520 --> 3:08:32.480]  free market enterprise no longer have the ability
[3:08:32.480 --> 3:08:33.880]  to profit from
[3:08:33.880 --> 3:08:35.040]  innovation
[3:08:35.040 --> 3:08:39.480]  and that will ultimately destroy us now that we no longer have war
[3:08:39.480 --> 3:08:43.240]  to maintain stability within the population maintain control which is
[3:08:43.240 --> 3:08:44.760]  kings and queens and
[3:08:44.760 --> 3:08:48.520]  bureaucrats and tyrants and so forth through history of use war
[3:08:48.520 --> 3:08:53.120]  we have to have an alternative form of terror in order to maintain the
[3:08:53.120 --> 3:08:56.800]  stability of people in the elitist of people behind their government
[3:08:56.800 --> 3:09:01.000]  that is now taking the form of terrorism
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:03.560]  absolutely okay uh...
[3:09:03.560 --> 3:09:06.520]  we're also going to stream this video at prison planet dot tv but we're going to
[3:09:06.520 --> 3:09:07.880]  play from john zen
[3:09:07.880 --> 3:09:11.520]  uh... this is daniel estaline and then it cuts into some other people
[3:09:11.520 --> 3:09:13.800]  uh... myself jim tucker talking about
[3:09:13.800 --> 3:09:16.480]  the inside info from bill berg
[3:09:16.480 --> 3:09:18.160]  two-and-a-half years ago
[3:09:18.160 --> 3:09:21.280]  and he talks about how they were going to go up to a hundred dollars a barrel
[3:09:21.280 --> 3:09:23.160]  it had hit sixty dollars a barrel then
[3:09:23.160 --> 3:09:25.880]  he talks about how they're gonna sucker people back in the stock market by
[3:09:25.880 --> 3:09:27.880]  running it up to fourteen thousand
[3:09:27.880 --> 3:09:31.680]  i mean all of them in this year they they run things folks okay
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:33.520]  this is really happening
[3:09:33.520 --> 3:09:37.640]  so uh... here it is
[3:09:37.640 --> 3:09:40.680]  one of the things that you know we're getting from this morning's
[3:09:40.680 --> 3:09:42.520]  this morning also is a lot of the uh...
[3:09:42.520 --> 3:09:46.080]  via the energy price of the price of all this the afternoon conference started
[3:09:46.080 --> 3:09:47.080]  at four o'clock
[3:09:47.080 --> 3:09:48.160]  four four thirty
[3:09:48.160 --> 3:09:49.080]  we were talking about
[3:09:49.080 --> 3:09:53.200]  uh... one of the american delegates i i wasn't told who exactly it was
[3:09:53.200 --> 3:09:54.560]  was talking about the uh...
[3:09:54.560 --> 3:09:58.920]  uh... the concern that the american citizens have had with the housing prices
[3:09:58.920 --> 3:09:59.800]  going down
[3:09:59.800 --> 3:10:02.800]  so they're not investing that money so what they needed to do is a link to create
[3:10:02.800 --> 3:10:03.840]  the illusion
[3:10:03.840 --> 3:10:06.520]  that everything is going well so what they're going to do over the next year
[3:10:06.520 --> 3:10:07.520]  a year and a half
[3:10:07.520 --> 3:10:10.400]  is to bring the market back up to it nineteen ninety eight nineteen ninety nine
[3:10:10.400 --> 3:10:11.240]  levels
[3:10:11.240 --> 3:10:13.480]  they're gonna get all the suckers to invest whatever little money they have
[3:10:13.480 --> 3:10:15.200]  left over
[3:10:15.200 --> 3:10:17.640]  and that's what they're gonna make the economy
[3:10:17.640 --> 3:10:20.640]  bottom dropout they need to destroy the economy because as we're running our
[3:10:20.640 --> 3:10:21.360]  boil
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:23.840]  when people don't travel at least that's what they're saying
[3:10:23.840 --> 3:10:25.200]  when people don't travel
[3:10:25.200 --> 3:10:28.000]  when people don't have money they don't travel they don't spend the money
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:30.960]  which means they don't waste on that
[3:10:30.960 --> 3:10:32.320]  oil and natural gas
[3:10:32.320 --> 3:10:35.080]  that's what actually the true people who are members of the bill overclock
[3:10:35.080 --> 3:10:37.280]  there's actual members of the bill overclock
[3:10:37.280 --> 3:10:39.560]  for years and years and years
[3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:42.120]  they've been going on participating in all the conversations they've always been
[3:10:42.120 --> 3:10:43.360]  dead on always
[3:10:43.360 --> 3:10:46.240]  and last year they said the oil prices are going to be up to one hundred fifty
[3:10:46.240 --> 3:10:49.440]  at the time of thirty nine we're not to seventy six basically doubled
[3:10:49.440 --> 3:10:51.600]  if it doubles again it's going to be back to where these people are
[3:10:51.600 --> 3:10:53.640]  man's act i ran it will it on it
[3:10:53.640 --> 3:10:56.480]  well the uh... the ram thing is on the backboarder
[3:10:56.480 --> 3:10:59.880]  uh... it was very much on the agenda last year but from what uh... i'm getting
[3:10:59.880 --> 3:11:01.320]  at this year's lunch
[3:11:01.320 --> 3:11:02.400]  today's lunch
[3:11:02.400 --> 3:11:03.400]  today's lunch
[3:11:03.400 --> 3:11:05.200]  and uh... people playing golf
[3:11:05.200 --> 3:11:10.040]  he ran is definitely sour and they're not uh... exactly sure how to do this thing
[3:11:10.040 --> 3:11:13.120]  uh... there's just too many consequences too many of the questions
[3:11:13.120 --> 3:11:15.600]  anyway they told them they told them no
[3:11:15.600 --> 3:11:18.080]  i mean they said don't attack iraq half of them back in
[3:11:18.080 --> 3:11:21.160]  well i i think it's different i think uh... the new cons i think the bush
[3:11:21.160 --> 3:11:22.240]  administration is
[3:11:22.240 --> 3:11:25.480]  is not in the same position as they were two three four years ago
[3:11:25.480 --> 3:11:27.480]  as they're now so the whole point is that
[3:11:27.480 --> 3:11:28.840]  twenty-eight percent of all right
[3:11:28.840 --> 3:11:32.080]  we still have two days of of building a conference because it started late at
[3:11:32.080 --> 3:11:34.280]  the late it's going to go on till sunday
[3:11:34.280 --> 3:11:37.080]  afternoon i think it's going to go Sunday morning still enough
[3:11:37.080 --> 3:11:40.120]  uh... discussing something anyway it's all eternal day tomorrow
[3:11:40.120 --> 3:11:44.200]  so uh... uh... we'll find out a lot more about what we're going to be talking about tomorrow
[3:11:44.200 --> 3:11:46.920]  the first item on the agenda is eurasia russia
[3:11:46.920 --> 3:11:50.160]  uh... china and the relation that russians and chinese have with the american
[3:11:50.160 --> 3:11:52.600]  that's the first time on the agenda the first time in the morning
[3:11:52.600 --> 3:11:57.320]  and that's the uh... uh... that that that discussion for a little bit about it
[3:11:57.320 --> 3:12:01.320]  the new world order as we're seeing an evolve is exactly the opposite of what
[3:12:01.320 --> 3:12:04.520]  our founding fathers intended by developing the constitution
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:08.240]  the tripod form of government where you have division of powers between
[3:12:08.240 --> 3:12:11.720]  the legislative judicial and executive branches
[3:12:11.720 --> 3:12:14.880]  when our founding fathers established the constitution in the united states they
[3:12:14.880 --> 3:12:18.280]  intended to have the local government is being the superior government over the
[3:12:18.280 --> 3:12:20.400]  state government and the federal government
[3:12:20.400 --> 3:12:23.160]  unfortunately over the last fifty years
[3:12:23.160 --> 3:12:27.440]  the reverse has occurred now we have an all-powerful federal government
[3:12:27.440 --> 3:12:30.400]  jefferson said when that happens we will have a
[3:12:30.400 --> 3:12:31.320]  tyranny
[3:12:31.320 --> 3:12:34.720]  that is far worse than the one that they had just separated which was of course
[3:12:34.720 --> 3:12:35.760]  england
[3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:40.200]  we now have a government basically that is is a tyrannical form of government in
[3:12:40.200 --> 3:12:43.000]  the federal government will become more so in the future
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:46.560]  because they have no accountability to the actual local person
[3:12:46.560 --> 3:12:48.600]  the reason why we had
[3:12:48.600 --> 3:12:51.560]  local government as being the most powerful government in our constitution
[3:12:51.560 --> 3:12:54.840]  was the fact that these were people that were being elected by the people over
[3:12:54.840 --> 3:12:56.400]  which they had jurisdiction
[3:12:56.400 --> 3:13:00.240]  now we have jurisdiction by bureaucracy at the federal level that has no
[3:13:00.240 --> 3:13:02.680]  accountability whatsoever to the local person
[3:13:02.680 --> 3:13:07.480]  and that will always result in tyranny eventually bill bergs ultimate goal
[3:13:07.480 --> 3:13:10.080]  is a world government for the united
[3:13:10.080 --> 3:13:13.160]  united nations to evolve into a world government
[3:13:13.160 --> 3:13:14.560]  and they're making
[3:13:14.560 --> 3:13:16.120]  uh... progress
[3:13:16.120 --> 3:13:19.440]  and we must stop that progress
[3:13:19.440 --> 3:13:21.400]  the fact that the union is now
[3:13:21.400 --> 3:13:23.200]  the standing army
[3:13:23.200 --> 3:13:24.040]  of uh...
[3:13:24.040 --> 3:13:27.200]  i mean you know that the nato is now the standing army
[3:13:27.200 --> 3:13:31.120]  of uh... united nations that was established
[3:13:31.120 --> 3:13:32.160]  at the
[3:13:32.160 --> 3:13:33.560]  uh...
[3:13:33.560 --> 3:13:37.000]  fifty senate that anniversary celebration of nato
[3:13:37.000 --> 3:13:40.080]  pending before the uh... you know okay
[3:13:40.080 --> 3:13:43.160]  and then of course uh... jim later predicted that george bush was actually
[3:13:43.160 --> 3:13:45.160]  gonna say global warming was real
[3:13:45.160 --> 3:13:49.280]  so we need to the carbon tax which he indeed later did do
[3:13:49.280 --> 3:13:52.600]  i mean these guys this is the heads of the big banks this is the queens the
[3:13:52.600 --> 3:13:53.760]  kings
[3:13:53.760 --> 3:13:57.880]  this is the rough child this is the rock of fellas and they run it
[3:13:57.880 --> 3:14:01.600]  and they engineer the economic collapse we're in
[3:14:01.600 --> 3:14:04.120]  publicly they are stealing all the money
[3:14:04.120 --> 3:14:06.680]  and they're going to steal even more and they're going to take your houses and
[3:14:06.680 --> 3:14:08.000]  farms and ranches
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:11.480]  and businesses and they don't care about you having a free market they don't care
[3:14:11.480 --> 3:14:14.760]  about you living a good life they don't want you to
[3:14:14.760 --> 3:14:19.840]  that's what all this grid of control and all this enforcement's about
[3:14:19.840 --> 3:14:21.600]  it's about taking you down
[3:14:21.600 --> 3:14:23.800]  to slave level
[3:14:23.800 --> 3:14:26.720]  now i want to go to your phone calls for those that are holding
[3:14:26.720 --> 3:14:30.060]  uh... david and we're already gone to them uh... eric and maxon
[3:14:30.060 --> 3:14:31.220]  junas and
[3:14:31.220 --> 3:14:33.960]  abraham and everybody else will get to your on new york
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:35.200]  runs of other
[3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:37.880]  cops will go to him over here for now i think that's the new york cop we know
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:38.920]  from years back
[3:14:38.920 --> 3:14:41.600]  since a lot of good stuff i could go to him first a minute
[3:14:41.600 --> 3:14:44.680]  but i want to go over some of these headlines of me to do this for days
[3:14:44.680 --> 3:14:46.480]  the kind of stuff i get sent
[3:14:46.480 --> 3:14:51.280]  uh... from listeners
[3:14:51.280 --> 3:14:53.800]  this uh...
[3:14:53.800 --> 3:14:56.360]  is a report
[3:14:56.360 --> 3:15:00.160]  out of the new york times for everybody
[3:15:00.160 --> 3:15:03.600]  and you can see there on the screen that there is a tiny camera
[3:15:03.600 --> 3:15:07.720]  built-in uh... to the upper part of the windshield
[3:15:07.720 --> 3:15:10.320]  watching her
[3:15:10.320 --> 3:15:14.160]  and i'll back it out so you can see the full headlines in the nation section
[3:15:14.160 --> 3:15:17.520]  cameras keep an eye out
[3:15:17.520 --> 3:15:21.960]  now i remember in two thousand reading studies by Toyota chrysler and others
[3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:23.480]  where they said
[3:15:23.480 --> 3:15:26.920]  that they were going to condition the public to accept cameras
[3:15:26.920 --> 3:15:30.560]  in all the cars with the police dialing in when they wanted to
[3:15:30.560 --> 3:15:34.080]  just like on-star with the audio the cell phone listening to you
[3:15:34.080 --> 3:15:38.840]  uh... to quote uh... see if you're okay uh... for safety
[3:15:38.840 --> 3:15:42.080]  they also said it could be advertised and i put this in my films like police
[3:15:42.080 --> 3:15:44.200]  day three total enslavement
[3:15:44.200 --> 3:15:47.520]  uh... that the first parents would use it to track their children and parents
[3:15:47.520 --> 3:15:50.240]  would use the cell phone function that tracks you
[3:15:50.240 --> 3:15:53.520]  with a website down to a few feet of you know from where you are because
[3:15:53.520 --> 3:15:55.760]  under the ninety six telecommunications act
[3:15:55.760 --> 3:15:58.640]  uh... they built this in
[3:15:58.640 --> 3:16:01.280]  and sure enough here they are conditioning everybody get ready for
[3:16:01.280 --> 3:16:02.760]  this also toyota
[3:16:02.760 --> 3:16:06.200]  wants to have an infrared camera that if there's pressure on the seats when
[3:16:06.200 --> 3:16:07.720]  it's hot in the car
[3:16:07.720 --> 3:16:10.400]  you know this will save the thirty something kids a year that die with
[3:16:10.400 --> 3:16:11.880]  their parents leaving them in the car
[3:16:11.880 --> 3:16:14.120]  that that'll call the police and the police will
[3:16:14.120 --> 3:16:17.920]  dial in over a mobile modem and watch you
[3:16:17.920 --> 3:16:20.760]  and they're doing federal studies to get people to put
[3:16:20.760 --> 3:16:24.260]  tax by the mile tracker systems in their cars so
[3:16:24.260 --> 3:16:27.820]  everybody's being conditioned right now and it says
[3:16:27.820 --> 3:16:31.680]  i feel like i'm being babysits at stacey richardson
[3:16:31.680 --> 3:16:33.360]  seventeen
[3:16:33.360 --> 3:16:34.400]  of the camera
[3:16:34.400 --> 3:16:36.280]  installed in the fort escort
[3:16:36.280 --> 3:16:39.280]  uh... her father says it's for her own good
[3:16:39.280 --> 3:16:42.440]  and uh... the good of other drivers
[3:16:42.440 --> 3:16:46.760]  it says devices note when a teen makes an unwise move and let's parents know
[3:16:46.760 --> 3:16:49.180]  and see now it's going to be truck drivers
[3:16:49.180 --> 3:16:52.200]  and everybody else they're conditioning the public to accept
[3:16:52.200 --> 3:16:55.120]  a total big brother society this is how it happens
[3:16:55.120 --> 3:16:58.000]  but see this would be fine if we had angels running things we don't we have
[3:16:58.000 --> 3:17:00.360]  a corrupt elite a dangerous society
[3:17:00.360 --> 3:17:04.520]  very evil elite throughout history the stuff is always abuse abused and
[3:17:04.520 --> 3:17:06.640]  it is being abused
[3:17:06.640 --> 3:17:11.400]  it says uh... kevin uh... richardson does not have to ride his seventeen-year-old
[3:17:11.400 --> 3:17:12.920]  daughters for the escort
[3:17:12.920 --> 3:17:14.520]  to know
[3:17:14.520 --> 3:17:18.680]  when she takes a turn too fast the camera system installed in her car
[3:17:18.680 --> 3:17:20.880]  will email him about it so see
[3:17:20.880 --> 3:17:24.440]  that's just like the black boxes fifteen years ago they put in all the cars
[3:17:24.440 --> 3:17:27.920]  that track you and know how you rector what really happened and then is used
[3:17:27.920 --> 3:17:29.400]  against you in a court of law
[3:17:29.400 --> 3:17:32.680]  or the progressive insurance boxes they put in your car
[3:17:32.680 --> 3:17:35.400]  see it's all about surveillance
[3:17:35.400 --> 3:17:41.240]  the camera system stall in her car will be uh... will email him about it
[3:17:41.240 --> 3:17:45.120]  and it says she's at the age when she's a little rebellious said mr richardson
[3:17:45.120 --> 3:17:48.160]  see the public's a little rebellious we need to have this done by government
[3:17:48.160 --> 3:17:50.680]  it's our big brother it's our big daddy
[3:17:50.680 --> 3:17:53.160]  mr richardson fifty four of
[3:17:53.160 --> 3:17:54.520]  ludsby maryland
[3:17:54.520 --> 3:17:58.360]  said and i'm of the age where i'm not in a mood to take any crap
[3:17:58.360 --> 3:18:01.920]  richardsons are among the one hundred families in southern maryland
[3:18:01.920 --> 3:18:04.080]  enrolled in a state
[3:18:04.080 --> 3:18:06.520]  sponsored study to install camera systems
[3:18:06.520 --> 3:18:08.880]  that record the movements before and after
[3:18:08.880 --> 3:18:11.000]  an unusual driving maneuver
[3:18:11.000 --> 3:18:14.520]  such as a sudden breaking or a two-sharp return
[3:18:14.520 --> 3:18:17.760]  and state officials want to put these in everybody's cars i've read their
[3:18:17.760 --> 3:18:18.760]  studies
[3:18:18.760 --> 3:18:22.560]  uh... this tells the slaves they want to put in the cars of people
[3:18:22.560 --> 3:18:24.320]  sixteen to twenty
[3:18:24.320 --> 3:18:27.360]  and they're talking about you know not letting teens have but one person in the
[3:18:27.360 --> 3:18:28.200]  car
[3:18:28.200 --> 3:18:31.400]  not letting teens drive after night it's training them just how to be prisoners
[3:18:31.400 --> 3:18:32.400]  and when they grow up
[3:18:32.400 --> 3:18:36.080]  they'll still be prisoners so uh... there is big brother
[3:18:36.080 --> 3:18:39.560]  cameras and public schools everywhere
[3:18:39.560 --> 3:18:41.440]  cameras in the bathrooms
[3:18:41.440 --> 3:18:43.840]  and in the classrooms as they learn how to be
[3:18:43.840 --> 3:18:45.600]  good little prisoners in fact

[3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:12.280]  on putting cameras in our cars
[3:19:12.280 --> 3:19:15.040]  to watch us and track us and control us
[3:19:15.040 --> 3:19:17.760]  an amy goodman story
[3:19:17.760 --> 3:19:18.840]  uh... here
[3:19:18.840 --> 3:19:21.640]  out of the athens daily review
[3:19:21.640 --> 3:19:25.120]  and uh... this story makes a joke
[3:19:25.120 --> 3:19:28.120]  uh... the headline does invasion of the sea smurfs
[3:19:28.120 --> 3:19:31.760]  that was not her headline then you read it it admits that the army is going to
[3:19:31.760 --> 3:19:33.760]  be used against the american people

[3:19:43.400 --> 3:19:47.080]  uh... you know more palatable by acting like it's friendly and
[3:19:47.080 --> 3:19:48.000]  and uh...
[3:19:48.000 --> 3:19:49.320]  fun
[3:19:49.320 --> 3:19:51.040]  to be surveilled by the military
[3:19:51.040 --> 3:19:54.200]  and have the military preparing to wage war on the american people
[3:19:54.200 --> 3:19:57.200]  when the military is trained to kill people and break things
[3:19:57.200 --> 3:20:00.320]  uh... speaking of roads and cameras they want to
[3:20:00.320 --> 3:20:02.760]  put in all the cars to track the american people
[3:20:02.760 --> 3:20:05.680]  in the taxes that's already been done in england and germany

[3:20:21.360 --> 3:20:22.800]  hand these over
[3:20:22.800 --> 3:20:25.960]  uh... the foreign corporations and then we've detailed that we cover that

[3:20:34.640 --> 3:20:36.360]  show you this
[3:20:36.360 --> 3:20:40.000]  article right now but there it is road operators
[3:20:40.000 --> 3:20:44.080]  bank on future tolls
[3:20:44.080 --> 3:20:48.400]  here is a uh... another report fb i struggles to cover cases
[3:20:48.400 --> 3:20:50.640]  because you see under
[3:20:50.640 --> 3:20:54.440]  bill clinton and president bush they got read
[3:20:54.440 --> 3:20:59.160]  the vast majority of agents that investigate real white-collar crime
[3:20:59.160 --> 3:21:01.720]  actually beefed up to the treasury
[3:21:01.720 --> 3:21:03.440]  and the iris itself
[3:21:03.440 --> 3:21:06.560]  investigators to squeeze the common middle class
[3:21:06.560 --> 3:21:08.520]  for non-crime related stuff
[3:21:08.520 --> 3:21:12.040]  uh... so so again squeeze the slave squeeze the milk cows
[3:21:12.040 --> 3:21:16.120]  uh... run them into submission
[3:21:16.120 --> 3:21:17.960]  for the
[3:21:17.960 --> 3:21:21.520]  real white-collar criminals the n-ron types of the treasury department types
[3:21:21.520 --> 3:21:25.080]  the goldman sex types of the actually just basically took all oversight off
[3:21:25.080 --> 3:21:25.920]  of them
[3:21:25.920 --> 3:21:29.640]  fb i struggles to cover cases focused on terrorism has been fewer agents
[3:21:29.640 --> 3:21:31.640]  to handle financial crime
[3:21:31.640 --> 3:21:34.360]  and that's the bush family specialty uh...
[3:21:34.360 --> 3:21:37.200]  jeb bush and marvin bush's will rating s and ls and
[3:21:37.200 --> 3:21:39.000]  silverado
[3:21:39.000 --> 3:21:40.400]  savings and loan
[3:21:40.400 --> 3:21:44.320]  and now uh... uh... uh... obama is uh... now admitting he's the architect of the
[3:21:44.320 --> 3:21:49.240]  bailout he's all for it unlimited cash to the foreign banks nothing for
[3:21:49.240 --> 3:21:51.320]  american uh... automakers
[3:21:51.320 --> 3:21:53.880]  which i'm not even for bailing them out except for the fact that the chinese
[3:21:53.880 --> 3:21:56.360]  governments announcing they're planning to buy
[3:21:56.360 --> 3:21:59.080]  at least chrysler gm
[3:21:59.080 --> 3:22:01.920]  twenty five billions two or three b2 bombers
[3:22:01.920 --> 3:22:05.280]  uh... so this is a national security infrastructure issue but because the
[3:22:05.280 --> 3:22:07.240]  globalist to care less about our infrastructure
[3:22:07.240 --> 3:22:09.640]  and because they actually want to destroy our national sovereignty
[3:22:09.640 --> 3:22:11.760]  you know they're gonna go for it so fb i struggles
[3:22:11.760 --> 3:22:12.960]  to cover cases
[3:22:12.960 --> 3:22:14.560]  there is that headline
[3:22:14.560 --> 3:22:17.080]  uh... right there for you and then here's another one i mean i probably see
[3:22:17.080 --> 3:22:19.360]  ten of these a day and don't even cover
[3:22:19.360 --> 3:22:23.360]  uh... mexico's top federal police official
[3:22:23.360 --> 3:22:25.560]  caught involved in all this
[3:22:25.560 --> 3:22:28.280]  criminal activity in narcotics trafficking
[3:22:28.280 --> 3:22:32.000]  and uh... the u.s. pays them tens of billions a year to make sure that u.s.
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:33.240]  drugs make it in
[3:22:33.240 --> 3:22:36.840]  and other cartel drugs don't so there is a drug war but it's a fight over the
[3:22:36.840 --> 3:22:37.760]  market
[3:22:37.760 --> 3:22:41.200]  uh... with the criminal banks we have and then in the stack people mailed me
[3:22:41.200 --> 3:22:43.120]  there are two other articles
[3:22:43.120 --> 3:22:45.680]  that i didn't bring in here because i was busy digging through a giant statin
[3:22:45.680 --> 3:22:46.560]  couldn't find them
[3:22:46.560 --> 3:22:50.960]  that i saw this week of texas sheriffs caught dealing drugs
[3:22:50.960 --> 3:22:54.480]  i mean just in one week i mean it's just wall to wall evil wall to wall
[3:22:54.480 --> 3:22:55.520]  corruption
[3:22:55.520 --> 3:22:58.760]  uh... that is your criminal new world order so there that is
[3:22:58.760 --> 3:23:00.880]  here we go back to the full audience
[3:23:00.880 --> 3:23:07.880]  today
[3:23:07.880 --> 3:23:14.880]  okay
[3:23:18.120 --> 3:23:19.480]  you know what
[3:23:19.480 --> 3:23:22.520]  i forgot i've had ten answers in the fifteen minutes
[3:23:22.520 --> 3:23:25.800]  we will go to your calls and i'll run this is on with us i promise
[3:23:25.800 --> 3:23:27.720]  ted are you still in the studio
[3:23:27.720 --> 3:23:30.640]  yeah right here alice you are a real trooper you know i called you now are
[3:23:30.640 --> 3:23:31.920]  going to come in
[3:23:31.920 --> 3:23:34.560]  tell us where gold is it's up today
[3:23:34.560 --> 3:23:37.840]  uh... the uh... major newspapers are reporting that
[3:23:37.840 --> 3:23:41.920]  governments worldwide are out of gold can't keep up with demand
[3:23:41.920 --> 3:23:43.000]  how can
[3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:45.880]  and again we have total manipulation going on here
[3:23:45.880 --> 3:23:47.960]  uh... when the comics
[3:23:47.960 --> 3:23:49.920]  you know says gold is seven fifty
[3:23:49.920 --> 3:23:53.160]  but when people are paying a thousand or more an ounce all over the world and
[3:23:53.160 --> 3:23:54.640]  the gold is selling out
[3:23:54.640 --> 3:23:58.560]  uh... again you're not adding some huge premium on this gold ted
[3:23:58.560 --> 3:24:01.520]  uh... you're selling it up because you bought it a week ago or more than we go
[3:24:01.520 --> 3:24:02.760]  when it was less
[3:24:02.760 --> 3:24:06.080]  you're passing on that fifty plus dollars an ounce savings
[3:24:06.080 --> 3:24:07.040]  two people
[3:24:07.040 --> 3:24:09.520]  and that's why you're so competitive because you've been in the business thirty
[3:24:09.520 --> 3:24:10.080]  years
[3:24:10.080 --> 3:24:13.480]  yeah you're right i mean i did buy this stuff between seven hundred and seven
[3:24:13.480 --> 3:24:14.280]  ten
[3:24:14.280 --> 3:24:18.000]  gold is up another ten dollars from yesterday when we had talked my prices
[3:24:18.000 --> 3:24:19.560]  are exactly the same
[3:24:19.560 --> 3:24:21.920]  as they were yesterday so you know
[3:24:21.920 --> 3:24:25.760]  you're you're getting a one great bargain and the reason why i'm able to do
[3:24:25.760 --> 3:24:28.280]  this is because you're right i did buy this stuff
[3:24:28.280 --> 3:24:30.200]  and until i run out of stock
[3:24:30.200 --> 3:24:32.560]  i don't know i'm not going to raise the prices
[3:24:32.560 --> 3:24:36.280]  i do have the frank still it's one eighty seven anybody who listened yesterday
[3:24:36.280 --> 3:24:38.880]  knows that i was offering them at one eighty seven
[3:24:38.880 --> 3:24:40.240]  i also have
[3:24:40.240 --> 3:24:44.760]  the uh... british sovereign right now two twenty eight i'm sorry the u.s. seagulls
[3:24:44.760 --> 3:24:48.720]  are sold out i'm not u.s. seagulls the canadian maple leaf sold out
[3:24:48.720 --> 3:24:51.720]  they're they're done i'm gonna have to go out and buy them again
[3:24:51.720 --> 3:24:55.120]  and probably gonna be close you know the nine hundreds now
[3:24:55.120 --> 3:24:56.280]  but they're gone
[3:24:56.280 --> 3:24:59.280]  uh... the uh... thing that i'm thinking right now alex i mean there's a lot of
[3:24:59.280 --> 3:25:02.320]  people right now that when this when everything backs up that they call things
[3:25:02.320 --> 3:25:04.160]  are getting better again thank god
[3:25:04.160 --> 3:25:08.120]  it's not getting better things are getting a lot worse unemployment numbers
[3:25:08.120 --> 3:25:09.040]  that are coming out
[3:25:09.040 --> 3:25:10.760]  are astronomical
[3:25:10.760 --> 3:25:14.120]  you know the auto makers right now are about to fail if they give them money
[3:25:14.120 --> 3:25:16.880]  it's the worst christmas shaping up
[3:25:16.880 --> 3:25:20.720]  since the last year of world war two in our economy was basically
[3:25:20.720 --> 3:25:24.640]  you know uh... no main street economy was all
[3:25:24.640 --> 3:25:26.200]  wartime economy
[3:25:26.200 --> 3:25:28.080]  uh... i mean to have this is
[3:25:28.080 --> 3:25:29.280]  this is scary
[3:25:29.280 --> 3:25:33.680]  it is it's it's it's it's terribly frightening and i can tell you right now
[3:25:33.680 --> 3:25:36.320]  people should be getting into gold and silver and they should have something
[3:25:36.320 --> 3:25:40.280]  that's real and hard that they can hold on to this paper currency is doomed
[3:25:40.280 --> 3:25:42.920]  uh... that the one thing that i was thinking you brought up christmas and
[3:25:42.920 --> 3:25:44.880]  there's a lot of people that are thinking about what they're gonna buy for
[3:25:44.880 --> 3:25:46.840]  christmas
[3:25:46.840 --> 3:25:50.920]  all these all these uh... uh... store cards that you can buy the you know the
[3:25:50.920 --> 3:25:53.880]  merchandise cards so people come back and buy what they want
[3:25:53.880 --> 3:25:55.520]  i would suggest this
[3:25:55.520 --> 3:26:00.080]  walking liberty haves enrolls at twenty are sitting at one hundred and sixty eight
[3:26:00.080 --> 3:26:02.040]  dollars per roll of twenty
[3:26:02.040 --> 3:26:06.080]  they're at eight dollars and sixty cents apiece or one hundred and sixty eight
[3:26:06.080 --> 3:26:06.920]  dollars
[3:26:06.920 --> 3:26:08.520]  per roll of twenty
[3:26:08.520 --> 3:26:13.120]  by those and give those to your friends your relatives your kids
[3:26:13.120 --> 3:26:16.920]  man that i mean they're gonna need this stuff they might not know it right now
[3:26:16.920 --> 3:26:20.560]  because a lot of people are still under the impression that the united states
[3:26:20.560 --> 3:26:22.480]  economy is going to pull through
[3:26:22.480 --> 3:26:26.080]  but they're going to need this stuff this is the well ten i mean in case
[3:26:26.080 --> 3:26:28.760]  things completely collapse and i'm crossing my fingers
[3:26:28.760 --> 3:26:32.880]  hoping you know praying that it's only a deep long recession
[3:26:32.880 --> 3:26:36.360]  but even mainline analysts are all saying no it's it's the question will be
[3:26:36.360 --> 3:26:38.400]  how bad will the depression be
[3:26:38.400 --> 3:26:40.840]  uh... i just hope that people take advantage
[3:26:40.840 --> 3:26:43.920]  now you do have american eagles left when almost everybody else is sold out
[3:26:43.920 --> 3:26:46.840]  right well yeah we've got american eagles just the maple is right now at
[3:26:46.840 --> 3:26:51.360]  this point size is an american eagles i have one ounce half ounce quarter ounce
[3:26:51.360 --> 3:26:55.000]  and ten thousand whatever you decide and you have british sovereign you have
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:26:59.120]  frank's give people the prices on those in the price on the silver again one
[3:26:59.120 --> 3:27:01.080]  eighty seven on the frank
[3:27:01.080 --> 3:27:04.360]  and the uh... and the british sovereign right now is two hundred and twenty eight
[3:27:04.360 --> 3:27:09.720]  alex that is the same exact price when swan gold was at seven hundred and six
[3:27:09.720 --> 3:27:12.560]  right about the time i was walking in that's on this stuff
[3:27:12.560 --> 3:27:15.320]  and uh... and this and the walking liberty haves
[3:27:15.320 --> 3:27:19.960]  i mean that the coin right now is eight dollars and forty cents silver dollars
[3:27:19.960 --> 3:27:21.560]  are twenty five bucks
[3:27:21.560 --> 3:27:25.560]  you know this is a lot more silver for the money it's a better looking coin
[3:27:25.560 --> 3:27:28.160]  and that's the other the the main part about it is
[3:27:28.160 --> 3:27:31.400]  is that this is the kind of thing that's going to bail you out when things are
[3:27:31.400 --> 3:27:34.000]  you know we're we're heading towards the kind of economy
[3:27:34.000 --> 3:27:37.560]  you need gold and silver to buy goods and services
[3:27:37.560 --> 3:27:40.600]  well i know this i mean i can feel really good about this your sponsor the
[3:27:40.600 --> 3:27:42.480]  show you made the show possible
[3:27:42.480 --> 3:27:43.760]  you're selling gold
[3:27:43.760 --> 3:27:45.800]  cheaper than anywhere else i can find it

[3:33:13.080 --> 3:33:15.960]  to talk about ways to reach out to people ways to
[3:33:15.960 --> 3:33:17.560]  not run folks off
[3:33:17.560 --> 3:33:19.840]  when you come up and try to talk to him on the street about
[3:33:19.840 --> 3:33:21.240]  the new world order
[3:33:21.240 --> 3:33:23.240]  government-sponsored terrorism
[3:33:23.240 --> 3:33:26.680]  uh... the antichrist whatever we're talking about
[3:33:26.680 --> 3:33:29.920]  well alec thanks for having me and that's a pleasure to be here
[3:33:29.920 --> 3:33:31.760]  glad to share my time with you
[3:33:31.760 --> 3:33:36.760]  uh... you know i i broke down a very simple four-step procedure for people
[3:33:36.760 --> 3:33:38.520]  and i thought i thought
[3:33:38.520 --> 3:33:40.920]  i p o d it's an acronym
[3:33:40.920 --> 3:33:43.640]  but it helps people kind of get my guideline of
[3:33:43.640 --> 3:33:45.160]  how to effectively
[3:33:45.160 --> 3:33:48.640]  expressed their thoughts their ideas their message
[3:33:48.640 --> 3:33:51.840]  uh... what we know whatever it is they want to communicate to people
[3:33:51.840 --> 3:33:53.960]  and they do it in a way that makes
[3:33:53.960 --> 3:33:54.880]  uh... the i
[3:33:54.880 --> 3:33:58.360]  simply stands for icebreaker or introduction and uh...
[3:33:58.360 --> 3:33:59.040]  course you can
[3:33:59.040 --> 3:34:01.760]  our million-dollar bill to our little curve illusion
[3:34:01.760 --> 3:34:04.400]  pink and blue a couple tracks we use those
[3:34:04.400 --> 3:34:07.680]  as a way to open up that door conversation i e
[3:34:07.680 --> 3:34:10.320]  might have to be a million-dollar bill and then they had to ask you the
[3:34:10.320 --> 3:34:12.000]  million-dollar question and
[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:13.000]  so you know
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:16.800]  there's lots of things you can do at dvd you know flyers promotional
[3:34:16.800 --> 3:34:18.960]  material and if you really want to be successful
[3:34:18.960 --> 3:34:20.840]  it didn't people can
[3:34:20.840 --> 3:34:23.560]  you know what you can do it is that the question
[3:34:23.560 --> 3:34:25.680]  that no matter how they respond to you
[3:34:25.680 --> 3:34:27.880]  uh... they're gonna want one i i e
[3:34:27.880 --> 3:34:32.200]  i say hey alex do you live here in town you'd say
[3:34:32.200 --> 3:34:33.520]  yes i do
[3:34:33.520 --> 3:34:35.240]  all good you'll need that
[3:34:35.240 --> 3:34:37.840]  and then you say well no i don't know if they will hear you need that
[3:34:37.840 --> 3:34:40.000]  because either way they need that right so
[3:34:40.000 --> 3:34:42.680]  they are you happy with the way the government taking care of things today
[3:34:42.680 --> 3:34:44.960]  you know all here you'll what you want that
[3:34:44.960 --> 3:34:48.160]  and it's a great way to get about ninety percent of the people to take
[3:34:48.160 --> 3:34:51.320]  the literature of the dvd or whatever it is you're passing out at the top because
[3:34:51.320 --> 3:34:53.920]  i watch these videos we are changing on the truth
[3:34:53.920 --> 3:34:56.080]  about half the time folks won't take it
[3:34:56.080 --> 3:34:59.320]  you know because they see a nervous solicitor
[3:34:59.320 --> 3:35:02.120]  uh... no no that doesn't work they need to go hey i've got something truly
[3:35:02.120 --> 3:35:05.160]  important for you i have you know i've got some amazing stuff for you
[3:35:05.160 --> 3:35:06.440]  uh... but
[3:35:06.440 --> 3:35:10.200]  but uh... you have even better ways of doing that so so i tell us about
[3:35:10.200 --> 3:35:11.960]  yeah well you can even
[3:35:11.960 --> 3:35:16.040]  things or what what i think customise the approach in other words i might say if
[3:35:16.040 --> 3:35:17.880]  but you walk down the street i'd say
[3:35:17.880 --> 3:35:20.840]  hey all the handsome guys get one of these today you know of course you're
[3:35:20.840 --> 3:35:23.960]  going to laugh about okay great you'll take one
[3:35:23.960 --> 3:35:26.880]  if it's a mom with kids pushing a stroller may take something like hey
[3:35:26.880 --> 3:35:29.280]  everybody with cute kids get one of these today
[3:35:29.280 --> 3:35:32.200]  let go of thank you and and they take it
[3:35:32.200 --> 3:35:36.000]  you know it it's really a matter of just approaching people with dignity with
[3:35:36.000 --> 3:35:38.920]  respect and and being calm cool collected
[3:35:38.920 --> 3:35:41.080]  uh... about it if you think
[3:35:41.080 --> 3:35:44.440]  fanatical then they you know kind of gives you a give you the height of the
[3:35:44.440 --> 3:35:48.080]  move right you know they kind of put that on about they know thanks so
[3:35:48.080 --> 3:35:51.280]  you have to do it in a way that that allows you to to reach out to people
[3:35:51.280 --> 3:35:52.240]  moreover
[3:35:52.240 --> 3:35:56.880]  i p o d right the p stands for probing are asking questions and
[3:35:56.880 --> 3:36:00.520]  on all too often people are so eager to get their message out
[3:36:00.520 --> 3:36:03.520]  they never take time to connect with that person by asking
[3:36:03.520 --> 3:36:05.000]  probative questions
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:06.680]  you know questions like
[3:36:06.680 --> 3:36:09.480]  ideal around here what what do you think about our government what do you
[3:36:09.480 --> 3:36:12.720]  think about this financial crisis you know do you think we should avail them
[3:36:12.720 --> 3:36:15.760]  out what do you think what do you think that money's going
[3:36:15.760 --> 3:36:20.640]  use the initial icebreaker well here's an example are you glad that the war is
[3:36:20.640 --> 3:36:24.000]  going to continue for at least three more years and they're like no
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:26.160]  you know eighty percent american people say well
[3:36:26.160 --> 3:36:29.440]  did you know that obama says he's going to continue with then they instantly
[3:36:29.440 --> 3:36:31.480]  wake up the obama's bad instead of
[3:36:31.480 --> 3:36:34.160]  obama's bad i'm gonna tell you why
[3:36:34.160 --> 3:36:36.080]  then they're gonna argue with you
[3:36:36.080 --> 3:36:39.080]  right absolutely then initially they're just gonna put up a duke's right they're
[3:36:39.080 --> 3:36:41.320]  ready for a big debate or argument
[3:36:41.320 --> 3:36:45.480]  our job that you know at the christian i look at it and think well all these
[3:36:45.480 --> 3:36:48.880]  income properties that we see unfolding before our eyes
[3:36:48.880 --> 3:36:52.760]  we know that the day's going to come when there will be a new world order there
[3:36:52.760 --> 3:36:54.680]  will be a world government there will be
[3:36:54.680 --> 3:36:56.600]  a one-world currency there will be a
[3:36:56.600 --> 3:37:00.480]  uh... implant of a chip and you know that today on your website i read about
[3:37:00.480 --> 3:37:02.960]  microsoft working with their chip right so
[3:37:02.960 --> 3:37:06.000]  you know that the state is being set for all that to happen the bible that can
[3:37:06.000 --> 3:37:08.360]  happen before i believe it to be true
[3:37:08.360 --> 3:37:12.120]  but we can't really stop it from happening but what we can do
[3:37:12.120 --> 3:37:15.920]  is be faithful farmers and so that information for that seat of information
[3:37:15.920 --> 3:37:17.200]  of people and then
[3:37:17.200 --> 3:37:18.680]  once again remember that
[3:37:18.680 --> 3:37:22.600]  hey don't don't take it rejection if they think they know you were they're not
[3:37:22.600 --> 3:37:25.000]  rejecting you the rejected material and
[3:37:25.000 --> 3:37:28.400]  it's really not your job to wake them up your job is to give them good
[3:37:28.400 --> 3:37:29.800]  information and then
[3:37:29.800 --> 3:37:33.280]  but that's the record between them and god or their own culture well it's our
[3:37:33.280 --> 3:37:37.360]  responsibility to warn people and reach out to them in the bible
[3:37:37.360 --> 3:37:40.280]  is full of that common sense just states that
[3:37:40.280 --> 3:37:43.320]  that they're all breaking off for a minute as you've been involved you know
[3:37:43.320 --> 3:37:45.800]  you have a Christian ministries you've gotten
[3:37:45.800 --> 3:37:49.000]  you know uh... you know thrown out of public places uh... it's been the
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:51.880]  newspapers in dallas trying to give people tracks and then
[3:37:51.880 --> 3:37:54.760]  made big cases out of that to defend the first amendment
[3:37:54.760 --> 3:37:58.400]  uh... how did they take over the churches and and turn them from being the
[3:37:58.400 --> 3:37:59.560]  tip of the spear
[3:37:59.560 --> 3:38:02.680]  morally and in christians knew they were supposed to be active in
[3:38:02.680 --> 3:38:04.600]  new they were supposed to be out helping the poor
[3:38:04.600 --> 3:38:06.480]  to just going to these big listening
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:09.120]  mega mall churches in worshiping some
[3:38:09.120 --> 3:38:12.680]  some guy in a you know fancy suit with a pinkie ring
[3:38:12.680 --> 3:38:15.520]  well i think a lot of it just comes from the fact that uh...
[3:38:15.520 --> 3:38:16.840]  people are apathetic
[3:38:16.840 --> 3:38:19.840]  you know they're just plain apathetic they just don't care
[3:38:19.840 --> 3:38:21.440]  it's been back to
[3:38:21.440 --> 3:38:24.400]  love once again if they truly loved others and they would reach out to those
[3:38:24.400 --> 3:38:27.240]  people they help those people they couldn't turn a blind eye
[3:38:27.240 --> 3:38:29.840]  to the need that people have but yet
[3:38:29.840 --> 3:38:31.880]  but sometimes i wonder if they're even
[3:38:31.880 --> 3:38:35.400]  you know truly faith you know they may say they're christian but the fruit
[3:38:35.400 --> 3:38:37.080]  that that comes from their life
[3:38:37.080 --> 3:38:38.880]  they dictate otherwise so
[3:38:38.880 --> 3:38:41.160]  jesus said you'll know them by their fruit
[3:38:41.160 --> 3:38:44.280]  and in fact matthew twenty four twenty five when he talks about all the
[3:38:44.280 --> 3:38:45.400]  warning signs
[3:38:45.400 --> 3:38:48.520]  of the last day you know earthquake pestle and famine wars were
[3:38:48.520 --> 3:38:49.560]  working for it
[3:38:49.560 --> 3:38:53.080]  there's one warning finding starts with the end with it and he repeats it ten
[3:38:53.080 --> 3:38:53.800]  time
[3:38:53.800 --> 3:38:57.280]  there's a little bit of other warning signs but he repeats this one over and over
[3:38:57.280 --> 3:39:00.600]  it's be careful no one to feed you many will come in my name claiming i am the
[3:39:00.600 --> 3:39:01.360]  christian
[3:39:01.360 --> 3:39:04.320]  will be full profit fall features full-fledged and
[3:39:04.320 --> 3:39:05.920]  you know a lot of christian
[3:39:05.920 --> 3:39:10.040]  this guide for christianity uh... under roman thirteen they tell we got a
[3:39:10.040 --> 3:39:13.080]  commitment to authority we got a commitment to the people in all these
[3:39:13.080 --> 3:39:14.400]  pastors and people
[3:39:14.400 --> 3:39:17.600]  telling people when martial law comes to commit to authority but
[3:39:17.600 --> 3:39:19.480]  if that was true then
[3:39:19.480 --> 3:39:22.480]  jesus when what he stood for when he stood up to all the world
[3:39:22.480 --> 3:39:26.480]  leaders of the day column from the hell and brutal vipers and hypocrites and
[3:39:26.480 --> 3:39:27.560]  told them that they would
[3:39:27.560 --> 3:39:30.720]  uh... that that the drunkard in the prostitute that he was minister to
[3:39:30.720 --> 3:39:33.880]  would enter the king of heaven even before them
[3:39:33.880 --> 3:39:35.720]  they were they were religious
[3:39:35.720 --> 3:39:38.480]  but they didn't have any relationship and they were all about you know
[3:39:38.480 --> 3:39:41.720]  power and money and pain and control and
[3:39:41.720 --> 3:39:44.160]  you know we feel out of that in the church today they don't
[3:39:44.160 --> 3:39:47.080]  it reminds me of a whole book about these two guys that get printed on an
[3:39:47.080 --> 3:39:48.480]  island right in the guy
[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:49.800]  first guy looks around
[3:39:49.800 --> 3:39:52.560]  find out there's no food or water comes together guys and hey man we're going to
[3:39:52.560 --> 3:39:54.240]  die there's no food or water
[3:39:54.240 --> 3:39:57.440]  but i think they don't worry about it i make a hundred thousand dollars a week
[3:39:57.440 --> 3:39:59.440]  the other guy said hey wait a minute i don't think you understand that there's
[3:39:59.440 --> 3:40:00.360]  no food
[3:40:00.360 --> 3:40:01.320]  there's no water
[3:40:01.320 --> 3:40:04.080]  what good the hundred grand a week going to do it on a deserted island i mean
[3:40:04.080 --> 3:40:05.360]  there's no story
[3:40:05.360 --> 3:40:06.520]  he said look man
[3:40:06.520 --> 3:40:08.600]  i make a hundred grand a week and i'm a christian
[3:40:08.600 --> 3:40:13.240]  at faithfully give ten percent to the church i know my pastor will find it
[3:40:13.240 --> 3:40:15.840]  ha ha ha ha ha ha
[3:40:15.840 --> 3:40:19.880]  oh i think that's a lot of it you know the pastors don't preach the truth today
[3:40:19.880 --> 3:40:21.760]  because they're afraid they're going to lose that money that people are given
[3:40:21.760 --> 3:40:24.480]  and then caught into the things of the world now they're little they're little
[3:40:24.480 --> 3:40:27.380]  glitter bugs and then people like they're buying an indulgence from the
[3:40:27.380 --> 3:40:29.440]  catholic church five hundred years ago
[3:40:29.440 --> 3:40:31.240]  go and then they
[3:40:31.240 --> 3:40:34.480]  they give that money and so they think oh it's all handled meanwhile there's
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:35.320]  people
[3:40:35.320 --> 3:40:37.680]  and families falling apart all around them
[3:40:37.680 --> 3:40:40.040]  the government's abusing people all around them
[3:40:40.040 --> 3:40:42.560]  and i'm sorry folks if you're not putting yourself up against evil and
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:44.560]  tyranny if you're not being persecuted
[3:40:44.560 --> 3:40:46.440]  you're not in the right spot this is not
[3:40:46.440 --> 3:40:48.120]  supposed to be fun
[3:40:48.120 --> 3:40:51.640]  uh... and it's not supposed to know just all be a bed of roses but it's it's
[3:40:51.640 --> 3:40:52.540]  rewarding
[3:40:52.540 --> 3:40:55.360]  you know not that i'm some higher might hear good person i'm terrible
[3:40:55.360 --> 3:40:58.340]  uh... but but uh... you know growing up
[3:40:58.340 --> 3:41:00.080]  i never understood you know
[3:41:00.080 --> 3:41:02.440]  going to the church or whatever
[3:41:02.440 --> 3:41:06.800]  why they said you'll be persecuted was a blessing but but but then you know
[3:41:06.800 --> 3:41:08.940]  you're doing the right thing and and and
[3:41:08.940 --> 3:41:12.560]  uh... it's such a blessing to be fighting evil and and saving people and
[3:41:12.560 --> 3:41:13.880]  waking people up and
[3:41:13.880 --> 3:41:15.800]  and and and doing that that
[3:41:15.800 --> 3:41:18.200]  that it's a blessing when you're attacked because
[3:41:18.200 --> 3:41:20.600]  you see the anger in the enemy you see them
[3:41:20.600 --> 3:41:22.120]  hopping up and down
[3:41:22.120 --> 3:41:25.560]  realizing that you're over the target bombing the hell out of them
[3:41:25.560 --> 3:41:28.840]  but right if you're not getting flack you're not over the target right so
[3:41:28.840 --> 3:41:32.480]  when you i think people mock me make fun of me you know persecuting
[3:41:32.480 --> 3:41:35.920]  i rejoice he just has rejoiced in that day and leap for joy because great is
[3:41:35.920 --> 3:41:39.120]  your reward in heaven just as a crucified him
[3:41:39.120 --> 3:41:42.400]  you know they're going to do other things uh... to to his servant so and
[3:41:42.400 --> 3:41:45.000]  it's not even even if you're not a christian if you have one thing in a
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:47.280]  lot of any compassion for the people
[3:41:47.280 --> 3:41:51.200]  and and the fact are are the fact coming to things you report on your show
[3:41:51.200 --> 3:41:54.200]  are accurate you're not a profit you're not predicting the future you're just
[3:41:54.200 --> 3:41:56.040]  doing your homework and you know history
[3:41:56.040 --> 3:41:58.400]  and you know if we repeat itself and you see
[3:41:58.400 --> 3:42:01.360]  the way the new world order for the team themselves and
[3:42:01.360 --> 3:42:04.000]  so once again even if you're not a christian you should care about about
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:05.400]  your fellow man
[3:42:05.400 --> 3:42:09.320]  to try to wake them up now what again it's not your responsibility
[3:42:09.320 --> 3:42:12.080]  whether they wake up or not if your responsibility to give them the
[3:42:12.080 --> 3:42:16.200]  information i agree and and and share daryl i want to talk more
[3:42:16.200 --> 3:42:19.160]  uh... about that in future shows and more before you leave us today

[3:42:42.480 --> 3:42:43.640]  to really be effective
[3:42:43.640 --> 3:42:45.040]  and we appreciate you uh...
[3:42:45.040 --> 3:42:45.840]  uh... doing that
[3:42:45.840 --> 3:42:48.880]  uh... run in new york ron you're on the air welcome
[3:42:48.880 --> 3:42:50.560]  yes hello alex
[3:42:50.560 --> 3:42:54.640]  alex that one of the things i want to speak about today is the nomination of
[3:42:54.640 --> 3:42:57.920]  eric holder fraternity general united states
[3:42:57.920 --> 3:42:59.660]  and the way the
[3:42:59.660 --> 3:43:03.400]  mainstream press or establishment press is treated
[3:43:03.400 --> 3:43:04.600]  i find it
[3:43:04.600 --> 3:43:05.920]  rather ironic
[3:43:05.920 --> 3:43:06.600]  that the
[3:43:06.600 --> 3:43:09.200]  uh... only thing that they could mention about him
[3:43:09.200 --> 3:43:11.040]  was his involvement with
[3:43:11.040 --> 3:43:15.240]  the pardon of mark richard who is at the justice department under bill clinton
[3:43:15.240 --> 3:43:16.880]  now well that is certainly
[3:43:16.880 --> 3:43:20.040]  something that should be examined in a transgression
[3:43:20.040 --> 3:43:22.000]  by comparative analysis
[3:43:22.000 --> 3:43:26.120]  it's the least of his transgressions and the greater ones are not mentioned
[3:43:26.120 --> 3:43:27.320]  eric holder
[3:43:27.320 --> 3:43:29.280]  was instrumentally involved
[3:43:29.280 --> 3:43:33.240]  in the incineration or what i prefer to call the murder at waco
[3:43:33.240 --> 3:43:36.880]  those children he was an upper echelon member of the justice department at that
[3:43:36.880 --> 3:43:40.680]  time they're they're appointing the worst people not just people from the
[3:43:40.680 --> 3:43:44.360]  clinton administration the very worst from that administration
[3:43:44.360 --> 3:43:46.280]  and the bush administration
[3:43:46.280 --> 3:43:51.600]  uh... in slum lords and gangsters i mean folks they're gonna hurt us bad
[3:43:51.600 --> 3:43:52.600]  holders record
[3:43:52.600 --> 3:43:54.820]  it's even worse than that
[3:43:54.820 --> 3:43:56.120]  holder uh...
[3:43:56.120 --> 3:43:59.640]  he's a funny guy he made a statement a few days ago
[3:43:59.640 --> 3:44:03.400]  about how he wants to restore the united states to a level of respect for
[3:44:03.400 --> 3:44:05.160]  human civil rights
[3:44:05.160 --> 3:44:09.640]  yet as a stooge for the bush administration in two thousand and five
[3:44:09.640 --> 3:44:14.760]  he came up with strategies to help them have the infamous patriot act renewed
[3:44:14.760 --> 3:44:17.040]  so this man is like totally mercenary
[3:44:17.040 --> 3:44:21.440]  in addition any of your listeners who are over fifteen years of age
[3:44:21.440 --> 3:44:24.760]  should remember holder going before congressional committees in the
[3:44:24.760 --> 3:44:27.840]  early nineties nineteen ninety three ninety four
[3:44:27.840 --> 3:44:28.960]  to defend
[3:44:28.960 --> 3:44:31.760]  the behavior at waco and at ruby rich
[3:44:31.760 --> 3:44:35.320]  i'll never forget this man's testimony he was dripping with indifference in
[3:44:35.320 --> 3:44:37.920]  arrogance to the murder of children
[3:44:37.920 --> 3:44:41.240]  and well well well i mean hold on your retired new york cops and it's a lot of
[3:44:41.240 --> 3:44:42.600]  good info over the years
[3:44:42.600 --> 3:44:46.000]  what do you think about everything that's unfolding and happening right now
[3:44:46.000 --> 3:44:49.320]  well what i think about is that it's everything that anyone with a logical
[3:44:49.320 --> 3:44:51.640]  and dialectic mind could have predicted
[3:44:51.640 --> 3:44:55.880]  that like you call it in the world order the globalist had their plan in effect
[3:44:55.880 --> 3:44:59.720]  and it's unraveling now when it's coming to its complete fruition
[3:44:59.720 --> 3:45:03.080]  that's what i think it's something that you saw i saw many people who had their
[3:45:03.080 --> 3:45:04.360]  eyes open
[3:45:04.360 --> 3:45:08.480]  should have seen uh... at least ten or fifteen years ago
[3:45:08.480 --> 3:45:11.640]  and uh... i think that what they're trying to do basically is collapse
[3:45:11.640 --> 3:45:14.280]  the republic and they're just about there
[3:45:14.280 --> 3:45:16.600]  uh... i think also in part
[3:45:16.600 --> 3:45:19.720]  i have to blame largely and i always done i do this and i've done it before
[3:45:19.720 --> 3:45:21.040]  you broadcast
[3:45:21.040 --> 3:45:23.000]  why blame the evil
[3:45:23.000 --> 3:45:26.400]  leader and i want to call them leaders let's say evil powers
[3:45:26.400 --> 3:45:28.000]  alright for doing this
[3:45:28.000 --> 3:45:32.320]  i into some portion blame the american people for being apathetic
[3:45:32.320 --> 3:45:35.400]  and uh... pursuing as was said earlier on a tape
[3:45:35.400 --> 3:45:36.880]  he missed the pleasures
[3:45:36.880 --> 3:45:40.760]  well they should have been concerned with their survival and their nation and
[3:45:40.760 --> 3:45:42.600]  their self-respecting dignity
[3:45:42.600 --> 3:45:45.120]  i blame them in part for that too
[3:45:45.120 --> 3:45:47.640]  now the next thing i want to move on to was
[3:45:47.640 --> 3:45:49.400]  these bailouts
[3:45:49.400 --> 3:45:53.440]  well i do agree that we shouldn't just give the auto industry a bailout
[3:45:53.440 --> 3:45:58.160]  okay it's correct
[3:45:58.160 --> 3:45:59.120]  loan
[3:45:59.120 --> 3:46:00.560]  how come such
[3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:04.040]  a level of concern about a twenty five billion dollar loan but they handed the
[3:46:04.040 --> 3:46:07.200]  banks at least seven hundred billion dollars
[3:46:07.200 --> 3:46:09.000]  no questions asked
[3:46:09.000 --> 3:46:10.960]  with a blindfold on
[3:46:10.960 --> 3:46:15.360]  i mean that something is wrong when you do the comparative analysis there
[3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:17.280]  i have my theories
[3:46:17.280 --> 3:46:19.400]  uh... as to why they did that
[3:46:19.400 --> 3:46:23.080]  but uh... i'm surprised that the strike most people is strange
[3:46:23.080 --> 3:46:26.160]  make a big hollow blue over twenty five billion and it's correct that they
[3:46:26.160 --> 3:46:27.640]  should i'm not against that
[3:46:27.640 --> 3:46:32.800]  but nothing over seven hundred billion
[3:46:32.800 --> 3:46:33.560]  hello
[3:46:33.560 --> 3:46:37.000]  yes ron i'm just i'm uh... i mean once i started up and you'll never be able
[3:46:37.000 --> 3:46:38.720]  to get a word out uh...
[3:46:38.720 --> 3:46:41.800]  uh... but but listen i appreciate your call and i want to go to some other
[3:46:41.800 --> 3:46:42.960]  collars before
[3:46:42.960 --> 3:46:45.520]  uh... the show has to end but i darel run this
[3:46:45.520 --> 3:46:48.760]  uh... your comments i mean it's a culture of corruption
[3:46:48.760 --> 3:46:51.000]  once you work
[3:46:51.000 --> 3:46:54.360]  absolutely alex in fact you know we you know we're talking about this and i
[3:46:54.360 --> 3:46:55.000]  mean this is
[3:46:55.000 --> 3:46:57.120]  economics one-on-one if you
[3:46:57.120 --> 3:47:00.360]  have a liquidity crisis with the bank they have money because people are
[3:47:00.360 --> 3:47:02.200]  defaulting on the mortgages and
[3:47:02.200 --> 3:47:04.720]  they uh... had written all this bad paper
[3:47:04.720 --> 3:47:06.440]  you really want to you know
[3:47:06.440 --> 3:47:09.240]  in the if you don't get cash back into the system
[3:47:09.240 --> 3:47:10.760]  what you don't take
[3:47:10.760 --> 3:47:13.960]  three hundred fifty billion seven hundred billion a trillion whatever it is
[3:47:13.960 --> 3:47:15.920]  and just give it to the same bank
[3:47:15.920 --> 3:47:18.360]  that squandered the money that the equivalent of me
[3:47:18.360 --> 3:47:21.880]  saying hey alex give me ten grand i'll hold it up i'll hold it for y'all take
[3:47:21.880 --> 3:47:24.360]  care of it and when you need it i'm gonna give it back to you plus ten
[3:47:24.360 --> 3:47:26.960]  percent when you come to get the money i think
[3:47:26.960 --> 3:47:28.440]  alex i'm sorry
[3:47:28.440 --> 3:47:32.520]  i made some bad choices i made some bad investments i squandered your money
[3:47:32.520 --> 3:47:34.840]  those are really bad i tell you what
[3:47:34.840 --> 3:47:39.000]  go take out a loan for ten grand give it to me and then and then i'll give it
[3:47:39.000 --> 3:47:39.720]  back
[3:47:39.720 --> 3:47:43.640]  all ridiculous nobody nobody would stand for that but all they had to do
[3:47:43.640 --> 3:47:46.280]  would give the money to the people because if i give you a check for twenty
[3:47:46.280 --> 3:47:49.080]  grand where's the first place you're going to take that check and take it to
[3:47:49.080 --> 3:47:51.800]  the bank you're going to deposit it there's a liquidity issue
[3:47:51.800 --> 3:47:55.160]  crisis fault right and they can loan that out ten times
[3:47:55.160 --> 3:47:57.480]  through fractional reserve banking but instead
[3:47:57.480 --> 3:47:59.960]  they're investing in china they're investing in europe
[3:47:59.960 --> 3:48:02.760]  they're investing in infrastructure buying it up
[3:48:02.760 --> 3:48:05.640]  uh... that's in the news today that some of the bailout money
[3:48:05.640 --> 3:48:08.840]  uh... for make of america's being invested in china i mean these uh...
[3:48:08.840 --> 3:48:10.520]  it's incredible
[3:48:10.520 --> 3:48:12.360]  well that's because i don't care
[3:48:12.360 --> 3:48:15.240]  about the people i mean i think it's time and that's why we need to do this
[3:48:15.240 --> 3:48:18.360]  boot camp because i think that the american people
[3:48:18.360 --> 3:48:21.880]  and the politicians have forgotten who they work for
[3:48:21.880 --> 3:48:25.000]  i mean personally if i were my business the way they run the government
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:28.120]  i've been broke a long time ago and i know i've been replaced i've been
[3:48:28.120 --> 3:48:29.320]  fired so
[3:48:29.320 --> 3:48:32.840]  you know why we don't rise up and say hey we're not going to take it anymore
[3:48:32.840 --> 3:48:34.200]  uh... you're fine
[3:48:34.200 --> 3:48:37.000]  you know we're bringing in some new people or a new system
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:40.120]  in fact the best system that i've i've ever thought of that i think would be
[3:48:40.120 --> 3:48:40.680]  great
[3:48:40.680 --> 3:48:43.800]  would solve all these problems but it'll never happen because they don't want to
[3:48:43.800 --> 3:48:44.840]  give up their power
[3:48:44.840 --> 3:48:48.360]  if they give the power truly back to the people you know maybe once a quarter
[3:48:48.360 --> 3:48:51.560]  uh... have everybody go vote on the issues do you do you think marijuana should
[3:48:51.560 --> 3:48:54.040]  be legal what the people vote on it should abortion be legal
[3:48:54.040 --> 3:48:55.880]  what the people vote on it and then
[3:48:55.880 --> 3:49:00.200]  have their politician their representative go back to congress and vote
[3:49:00.200 --> 3:49:04.200]  the ways well they can't let us do that because almost seventy percent against
[3:49:04.200 --> 3:49:05.720]  abortion it'd be banned
[3:49:05.720 --> 3:49:08.680]  eighty-seven percent are against marijuana being illegal it would be
[3:49:08.680 --> 3:49:09.720]  legalized
[3:49:09.720 --> 3:49:11.960]  uh... and i mean it's really weird if you come
[3:49:11.960 --> 3:49:16.440]  uh... the constitution and what's common sense and what the people want
[3:49:16.440 --> 3:49:20.600]  is uh... actually what's popular but they never allow it
[3:49:20.600 --> 3:49:23.960]  that's right because then they would have to relinquish their power see if the
[3:49:23.960 --> 3:49:27.400]  same reason why when the jews turned jesus over to be crucified that's why
[3:49:27.400 --> 3:49:28.120]  christians
[3:49:28.120 --> 3:49:31.000]  should believe in conspiracy i mean that they happen throughout the court of
[3:49:31.000 --> 3:49:34.600]  history the jews conspired to kill jesus in the middle of the night
[3:49:34.600 --> 3:49:38.120]  and uh... you know that but they did they did it and they lied about it and try to
[3:49:38.120 --> 3:49:40.840]  cover it up later because they didn't want to relinquish their power
[3:49:40.840 --> 3:49:43.960]  they were collecting all the taxes they had power they had authority over the
[3:49:43.960 --> 3:49:46.920]  you know of jerusalem and they didn't want to give that up and
[3:49:46.920 --> 3:49:50.520]  so when you examine people's motives it's pretty simple i mean come on use your
[3:49:50.520 --> 3:49:51.320]  common sense
[3:49:51.320 --> 3:49:52.280]  who spends
[3:49:52.280 --> 3:49:55.560]  i forget what the rock is meant to become president two billion million four
[3:49:55.560 --> 3:49:57.400]  hundred okay billions of dollars
[3:49:57.400 --> 3:50:00.440]  to get elected to a job that pays you three hundred thousand dollars a year
[3:50:00.440 --> 3:50:02.600]  hold on stay there here we go folks
[3:50:02.600 --> 3:50:06.120]  i'm gonna skip this break two i'm gonna skip this right now on the internet
[3:50:06.120 --> 3:50:08.120]  so we get some of these calls and then we'll come back
[3:50:08.120 --> 3:50:10.760]  the full audience with daryl so you can finish that
[3:50:10.760 --> 3:50:12.600]  thought so it's congruent daryl
[3:50:12.600 --> 3:50:16.200]  about the uh... two billion bucks while the special interest total
[3:50:16.200 --> 3:50:19.800]  uh... and uh... mccain spent about eight hundred million so
[3:50:19.800 --> 3:50:21.560]  uh...
[3:50:21.560 --> 3:50:25.320]  let's uh... go ahead and uh... go back to the calls
[3:50:25.320 --> 3:50:30.840]  eric in illinois and then maxi and others were still there eric go ahead
[3:50:30.840 --> 3:50:32.520]  well alex yes sir
[3:50:32.520 --> 3:50:36.920]  yes i had a question about uh... private mortgage insurance
[3:50:36.920 --> 3:50:40.920]  my understanding is uh... private mortgage insurance is uh... supposed to
[3:50:40.920 --> 3:50:42.760]  take care of your loan
[3:50:42.760 --> 3:50:46.200]  uh... if you default on it
[3:50:46.200 --> 3:50:48.920]  why big bailout
[3:50:48.920 --> 3:50:52.920]  well because uh... the insurance the insurers themselves
[3:50:52.920 --> 3:50:55.480]  uh... a i g and others
[3:50:55.480 --> 3:50:58.920]  uh... they have all been running scams and selling derivatives daryl you want
[3:50:58.920 --> 3:51:01.080]  to explain that
[3:51:01.080 --> 3:51:02.920]  well exactly they just don't have the money
[3:51:02.920 --> 3:51:07.000]  to protect the insurance and so in fact what we were talking about this alex on
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:08.840]  on on another kind of
[3:51:08.840 --> 3:51:12.680]  skamish kind of thing you have all these local government you know
[3:51:12.680 --> 3:51:15.960]  city government and county government the state government
[3:51:15.960 --> 3:51:19.560]  who have sold municipal bonds they sold tons of bonds that now they can't
[3:51:19.560 --> 3:51:22.440]  you know when these bonds come mature they can't pay them and so they're
[3:51:22.440 --> 3:51:24.280]  going to have to go deeper in debt to do it
[3:51:24.280 --> 3:51:27.640]  and if they don't get their loans they're going to go bankrupt and not only
[3:51:27.640 --> 3:51:30.680]  that what you're going to see and i've seen a ton of times already
[3:51:30.680 --> 3:51:34.840]  just uh... on the way to hawaii when we drove from dentin to uh... bfw airport
[3:51:34.840 --> 3:51:37.640]  i thought ten cops giving out tickets i mean you can have
[3:51:37.640 --> 3:51:41.400]  the iraq and people notice the thing you owe money even though you don't have
[3:51:41.400 --> 3:51:44.440]  local city counties and government i mean people check your
[3:51:44.440 --> 3:51:47.800]  housing appraisal your your house the value of your house has gone up as far
[3:51:47.800 --> 3:51:49.800]  as tax purposes purposes go
[3:51:49.800 --> 3:51:53.880]  even though all reports show that how the prices have cut in half in some
[3:51:53.880 --> 3:51:55.640]  absolutely challenging
[3:51:55.640 --> 3:51:57.240]  demand they lower it
[3:51:57.240 --> 3:51:59.640]  you're absolutely right and by the way there are a lot of what you're saying
[3:51:59.640 --> 3:52:02.360]  is in the news they the police are writing more tickets
[3:52:02.360 --> 3:52:05.960]  squeezing uh... now because property taxes are going down
[3:52:05.960 --> 3:52:08.920]  uh... even when they still try to rig them they're now just doing general
[3:52:08.920 --> 3:52:11.080]  assessments saying well our small town
[3:52:11.080 --> 3:52:14.200]  have to fix the roads twenty thousand dollars per family
[3:52:14.200 --> 3:52:17.240]  and people like we don't have it they go we'll just take your house then
[3:52:17.240 --> 3:52:20.920]  only what are they going to do just be like pigish government people
[3:52:20.920 --> 3:52:23.560]  sitting on top of thousands of empty houses
[3:52:23.560 --> 3:52:25.720]  i mean they're just such bastards
[3:52:25.720 --> 3:52:30.120]  well exactly in the fact that the matter is look if you're a scam artist
[3:52:30.120 --> 3:52:33.240]  okay and and and you give me ten grand i don't care
[3:52:33.240 --> 3:52:35.880]  you want your ten grand back i'm not going to give it to you
[3:52:35.880 --> 3:52:38.840]  and when i got all the power and authority and autonomy to do whatever i
[3:52:38.840 --> 3:52:39.400]  want
[3:52:39.400 --> 3:52:43.960]  no accountability what what recourse do you have to go tell the cops the cops are
[3:52:43.960 --> 3:52:46.040]  bought off Eric anything else
[3:52:46.040 --> 3:52:49.640]  yeah well i i was one of those crazy people i put ten percent down on my
[3:52:49.640 --> 3:52:51.000]  house when i bought it
[3:52:51.000 --> 3:52:53.880]  and then i called the bank and i said you know hey i looked at my escrow
[3:52:53.880 --> 3:52:55.560]  statement and i said hey uh...
[3:52:55.560 --> 3:52:58.840]  i understand that i'm paying principal i'm paying interest
[3:52:58.840 --> 3:53:03.240]  i'm paying taxes and and insurance for the house that you know if it burns down
[3:53:03.240 --> 3:53:05.560]  or something i said what's this pmi
[3:53:05.560 --> 3:53:07.720]  so they told me what it was so
[3:53:07.720 --> 3:53:11.000]  since then i went ahead and i paid the other ten percent so now i own twenty
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:12.280]  percent of my house
[3:53:12.280 --> 3:53:14.600]  i'm not for paying private mortgage insurance
[3:53:14.600 --> 3:53:18.040]  but most people are and even if you don't default you're still paying that
[3:53:18.040 --> 3:53:19.400]  insurance is just like
[3:53:19.400 --> 3:53:22.360]  if you're paying insurance i hear you listen it doesn't listen we're out of
[3:53:22.360 --> 3:53:25.480]  time we're out of time i need a five-hour show here we go
[3:53:25.480 --> 3:53:27.480]  you
[3:53:34.040 --> 3:53:37.720]  you know i want to go to max and abraham and nick but i just

[3:53:48.600 --> 3:53:51.160]  going to be out at the jfk uh... memorial
[3:53:51.160 --> 3:53:54.120]  uh... and uh... just a lot of other stuff going on
[3:53:54.120 --> 3:53:57.080]  and uh... we'll love videotape you know you talk in the crowds of people because
[3:53:57.080 --> 3:53:59.080]  you are very effective salesman that's why your
[3:53:59.080 --> 3:54:02.280]  company's made tens of millions of dollars and will show folks an example of
[3:54:02.280 --> 3:54:04.920]  using sales techniques to sell the truth
[3:54:04.920 --> 3:54:08.040]  and get people to pay attention it's really simple once you see it but
[3:54:08.040 --> 3:54:11.240]  you'll notice that most of us aren't using these techniques let's jam in
[3:54:11.240 --> 3:54:15.080]  another call here max in indiana you're on the air go ahead
[3:54:15.080 --> 3:54:18.200]  hey alex how's it going good hey i've been uh...
[3:54:18.200 --> 3:54:21.480]  i just want to compliment you for your great work i've been following you for
[3:54:21.480 --> 3:54:25.320]  uh... like seven years now thank you and uh...
[3:54:25.320 --> 3:54:28.440]  since you were talking about eric holder i just want to say something real quick
[3:54:28.440 --> 3:54:32.520]  it uh... i heard the other day on uh... i think it was democracy now is also
[3:54:32.520 --> 3:54:38.360]  defending the chiquita corporation for allegedly financing some paramilitary
[3:54:38.360 --> 3:54:41.800]  groups like 1.7 million dollars yes down in
[3:54:41.800 --> 3:54:45.960]  columbia so yeah that was just no no they want they want gangsters as the
[3:54:45.960 --> 3:54:50.680]  attorney general and uh... this is basically the clinton and bush
[3:54:50.680 --> 3:54:52.600]  administration merging
[3:54:52.600 --> 3:54:56.680]  you know daryl is that horrifying you to see what obama's doing
[3:54:56.680 --> 3:55:01.320]  oh yeah i think the truth i think the truth alex they're all a bunch of puppets
[3:55:01.320 --> 3:55:03.320]  whose strings are pulled by the power of the
[3:55:03.320 --> 3:55:07.160]  you know so i think in fact within the the the the power structure you really
[3:55:07.160 --> 3:55:10.600]  have two different classes you know you have like the builder burger socialist
[3:55:10.600 --> 3:55:12.600]  type of class and that's why you thought
[3:55:12.600 --> 3:55:15.880]  brock obama and hillary clinton get together in their little secret meeting
[3:55:15.880 --> 3:55:19.640]  earlier this year when obama abandoned the press on the airplane and
[3:55:19.640 --> 3:55:22.840]  it just so happened when you were there in town they were having builder burgers
[3:55:22.840 --> 3:55:24.760]  in virginia that that all happened but
[3:55:24.760 --> 3:55:29.080]  then i think you got the bush side of things which is more the you know uh...
[3:55:29.080 --> 3:55:32.680]  let's say you got the socialist on brock side and then you've got the more
[3:55:32.680 --> 3:55:35.960]  uh... fascist corporate you know type of side i think those
[3:55:35.960 --> 3:55:40.120]  those two factions kind of war against each other for power or or or you know
[3:55:40.120 --> 3:55:44.040]  to kind of have their agenda push but in the end it's it's all the same big
[3:55:44.040 --> 3:55:47.400]  group that's controlling everything absolutely anything else max
[3:55:47.400 --> 3:55:51.880]  oh yeah uh... i want to make a comment about uh... what you guys were talking
[3:55:51.880 --> 3:55:55.400]  about yesterday about war trade center number seven
[3:55:55.400 --> 3:55:58.840]  and uh... i've seen a lot of the i've done my own research i've seen all of the
[3:55:58.840 --> 3:56:00.920]  movies that are out there and everything
[3:56:00.920 --> 3:56:05.400]  and i was surprised that uh... nobody ever tried to connect
[3:56:05.400 --> 3:56:09.160]  um... the flight that went down in pennsylvania
[3:56:09.160 --> 3:56:11.880]  with the war trade center number seven because if you
[3:56:11.880 --> 3:56:14.840]  though though that's just my personal assumption yeah a lot of people thought
[3:56:14.840 --> 3:56:17.880]  that that was meant for that building and then we're going to blow it up
[3:56:17.880 --> 3:56:20.840]  but then it got shot down and it was in a beeline
[3:56:20.840 --> 3:56:24.600]  for that but it was also in a beeline for washington we appreciate your call
[3:56:24.600 --> 3:56:27.000]  i want to jam in abraham sorry to nick
[3:56:27.000 --> 3:56:30.280]  abraham in washington you're our tail gunner with uh... they'll run this in
[3:56:30.280 --> 3:56:32.120]  elix Jones
[3:56:32.120 --> 3:56:35.240]  hey alex how you doing uh... i just wanted to ask your advice about
[3:56:35.240 --> 3:56:38.360]  something i'm going to be going before the city council up here where i live to
[3:56:38.360 --> 3:56:39.720]  uh... get a
[3:56:39.720 --> 3:56:43.800]  piece of legislation block to have cameras in
[3:56:43.800 --> 3:56:47.800]  and uh... i want to know the best way to approach it because i've got uh...
[3:56:47.800 --> 3:56:51.320]  two of the councilman's ears you know they're pretty good friends of mine and
[3:56:51.320 --> 3:56:54.840]  i want to approach that they're also interested in stuff to uh... repeal the
[3:56:54.840 --> 3:56:57.720]  patriot act okay well i mean it's just a declaration
[3:56:57.720 --> 3:57:01.000]  the bill of rights it is still alive in their town eight hundred
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:03.560]  plus cities and seven states have passed it
[3:57:03.560 --> 3:57:07.560]  can google that pull it up uh... and i would just point out that it's going to
[3:57:07.560 --> 3:57:09.800]  be used to surveil and control the people
[3:57:09.800 --> 3:57:13.080]  that uh... they have studies in england nndc in new york
[3:57:13.080 --> 3:57:16.520]  the surveillance cameras do not deter crime
[3:57:16.520 --> 3:57:20.040]  uh... and that's associated for some strange reason with higher crime
[3:57:20.040 --> 3:57:23.000]  and so that's basically what i tell them you can google those terms and pull them
[3:57:23.000 --> 3:57:25.960]  up appreciate your call uh... abraham
