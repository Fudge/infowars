[00:00.000 --> 00:23.160]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:23.160 --> 00:27.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this very special emergency Saturday
[00:27.560 --> 00:29.400]  evening transmission.
[00:29.400 --> 00:40.640]  It is October 30th, 2021, and we have massive news to announce here on air that I was aware
[00:40.640 --> 00:47.440]  of years ago, but I did not know they were actually going operational, and indeed they
[00:47.440 --> 00:48.440]  have gone operational.
[00:48.440 --> 00:53.480]  I learned about this yesterday morning, did some research yesterday and today, and I'm
[00:53.480 --> 00:57.080]  ready to lay it out for you right now.
[00:57.080 --> 01:01.680]  This will just be the first of many reports on this because this isn't something that's
[01:01.680 --> 01:02.680]  around the corner.
[01:02.680 --> 01:07.240]  This is something that is now beginning to happen right now.
[01:07.240 --> 01:12.120]  So if we can, let me go ahead and just lay this out and then we'll hit the other big
[01:12.120 --> 01:13.820]  news as well.
[01:13.820 --> 01:19.200]  The Democrats have been caught engaging in a major false flag in Virginia, a racial false
[01:19.200 --> 01:24.720]  flag in an attempt to start a new Charlottesville like the first one they pulled off four years
[01:24.720 --> 01:31.440]  ago and they got caught red handed and it has blown up in their face.
[01:31.440 --> 01:37.640]  The full report is at Infowars.com false flag confirmed in Virginia governor race, and we
[01:37.640 --> 01:44.020]  have a special video report I just shot before I walked in here to go on air that will be
[01:44.020 --> 01:45.640]  ready to air coming up.
[01:45.640 --> 01:51.000]  I'm told in about 25, 30 minutes, we'll go to that exclusive breakdown.
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.640]  Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson vindicated.
[01:55.640 --> 02:00.220]  Democrats caught in Virginia gubernatorial false flag that is going to be coming up.
[02:00.220 --> 02:06.360]  Now this story isn't just important because it vindicates the information that we reported
[02:06.360 --> 02:12.320]  on four years ago concerning Charlottesville and the fact that there were deep state Democrat
[02:12.320 --> 02:19.420]  political operatives basically leading the right wing white nationalist event and that
[02:19.420 --> 02:23.300]  later came out and was confirmed.
[02:23.300 --> 02:27.180]  That's important, but not as important as the fact that right now there's mass branding
[02:27.180 --> 02:32.500]  all over the corporate news, all over the media, that anyone questioning elections,
[02:32.500 --> 02:36.620]  anyone questioning lockdowns, anyone questioning forced inoculations is a terrorist.
[02:36.620 --> 02:41.620]  Anybody protesting critical race theory at their school board is a terrorist.
[02:41.620 --> 02:46.820]  And they're actually trying to roll this out with the Capitol police departments, federal
[02:46.820 --> 02:53.140]  police departments all over the nation being set up and Homeland security branding a new
[02:53.140 --> 03:00.740]  war with the American people and Biden coming out in June and saying the main threat's not
[03:00.740 --> 03:02.060]  radical Islam.
[03:02.060 --> 03:03.060]  It's not Russia.
[03:03.060 --> 03:04.240]  It's not China.
[03:04.240 --> 03:05.740]  It's now the American people.
[03:05.740 --> 03:09.500]  That's the number one terror threat in America.
[03:09.500 --> 03:14.940]  And you can see on screen right there from even back in June, some of the reports and
[03:14.940 --> 03:17.700]  some of the Homeland security graphics they were putting out about opposition to COVID
[03:17.700 --> 03:22.540]  measures, claims of election fraud, believe Trump can be reinstated, 9-11 anniversary
[03:22.540 --> 03:23.820]  and religious holidays.
[03:23.820 --> 03:31.740]  So just incredible rollout of the Patriot Act and the CIA and the whole police state
[03:31.740 --> 03:36.420]  that's not supposed to be used on citizens under law against us, exactly what I and many
[03:36.420 --> 03:40.460]  other constitutional experts like Jonathan Turley warned of 20 years ago with the Patriot
[03:40.460 --> 03:41.460]  Act.
[03:41.460 --> 03:49.020]  And so they're getting ready to stage a bunch of false flags, violent false flags, Oklahoma
[03:49.020 --> 03:55.460]  city style false flags, not just the provocateur January 6th event that didn't go off as bad
[03:55.460 --> 03:56.460]  as they wanted it to.
[03:56.460 --> 04:00.700]  They wanted it to be really bad, but thank God it fizzled out and wasn't as bad as they
[04:00.700 --> 04:03.420]  were planning it to be.
[04:03.420 --> 04:07.600]  And so now they are in a total hysteria over Tucker Carlson coming out with this new three
[04:07.600 --> 04:11.340]  part documentary series that he's going to be covering all week next week titled the
[04:11.340 --> 04:16.720]  plot against the people, because this is a plot against the people and the American people
[04:16.720 --> 04:20.600]  understand how this is a divide and conquer operation and an attempt at race war.
[04:20.600 --> 04:22.080]  The globalists are launching.
[04:22.080 --> 04:26.840]  We can save our country and also bring the globalist to justice, but that's where we
[04:26.840 --> 04:27.840]  are.
[04:27.840 --> 04:28.840]  That's what's unfolding.
[04:28.840 --> 04:31.500]  And that's what we're facing right now.
[04:31.500 --> 04:36.760]  Now let's get to our top story here on this Saturday evening.
[04:36.760 --> 04:41.680]  And again, the only way this information is going to get out is if you share it.
[04:41.680 --> 04:45.700]  And if you do decide to share it, it's going to have a huge effect that we can stop this
[04:45.700 --> 04:51.720]  nightmare next phase of the great reset and of the transhumanist nanotech takeover of
[04:51.720 --> 04:52.720]  our bodies.
[04:52.720 --> 04:54.360]  And what do I speak of?
[04:54.360 --> 04:58.920]  I remember 20 plus years ago, reading about Bill Gates and press releases, he put out
[04:58.920 --> 05:03.960]  wanting to control the weather, wanting to have particulate added to jet fuel to create
[05:03.960 --> 05:07.800]  nuclei in the atmosphere, to create artificial clouds, to bounce solar radiation back out
[05:07.800 --> 05:09.120]  into space.
[05:09.120 --> 05:16.220]  I remember seeing Bill Gates proposing putting sterilants in vaccines and putting sterilants
[05:16.220 --> 05:23.400]  in mosquitoes so they could deliver sterilant vaccines into third world populations.
[05:23.400 --> 05:28.340]  I remember seeing Bill Gates talking about engineering strawberries and potatoes and
[05:28.340 --> 05:36.140]  tomatoes and bananas and papayas that would have, quote, different vaccines engineered
[05:36.140 --> 05:44.800]  biomechanically bio electrically into the very tissue of the plant where the plant would
[05:44.800 --> 05:47.880]  produce live viruses.
[05:47.880 --> 05:55.000]  And they had actually developed that and actually had it completed in several decades ago.
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.020]  But now they've gone operational with the weather control.
[05:58.020 --> 06:00.140]  Now they've gone operational with the virus release.
[06:00.140 --> 06:05.280]  Now they've got operational with the MRNA, genetic engineering revolution rollout.
[06:05.280 --> 06:09.540]  Now they've gone operational with the nanotech in the Pfizer and Moderna shots, both controlled
[06:09.540 --> 06:12.660]  by Gates and his combine.
[06:12.660 --> 06:19.700]  And so now we're sitting here on the precipice of this in every major Western country saying
[06:19.700 --> 06:23.420]  you will be fired, you won't be able to get on an airplane, you won't be able to travel
[06:23.420 --> 06:27.820]  around the world unless you accept a world medical ID controlled by the UN and the Davos
[06:27.820 --> 06:30.120]  group.
[06:30.120 --> 06:33.660]  It's not coming, it's here.
[06:33.660 --> 06:36.500]  Now you think that's bad enough, right?
[06:36.500 --> 06:42.540]  Well, the Davos group has officially come out in just the last month.
[06:42.540 --> 06:46.380]  This has gotten almost no coverage, but it's been at the UN level and the corporate university
[06:46.380 --> 06:47.380]  level.
[06:47.380 --> 06:51.860]  I've got a stack of news right here I'm about to show you and stated that they've engineered
[06:51.860 --> 06:58.460]  all of these nanoparticles that are microchips, microscopic microchips, some of what you can
[06:58.460 --> 07:06.260]  see with the naked eye, some of what you can't, that they spray onto all of the food to quote
[07:06.260 --> 07:08.020]  track it and make sure it's safe.
[07:08.020 --> 07:12.140]  So to make sure it's safe and not contaminated, they contaminate it.
[07:12.140 --> 07:17.100]  Remember the documents that came out a month ago or more, the plan by Peter Daszak and
[07:17.100 --> 07:23.820]  Fauci and Gates to spray live nanotech, open air China on the population to quote, give
[07:23.820 --> 07:27.060]  them COVID-19, remember that?
[07:27.060 --> 07:31.020]  And that's beyond gain of function, that's synthetic viruses.
[07:31.020 --> 07:33.860]  This is what's really going on.
[07:33.860 --> 07:39.660]  And the whole revolution is what they've been calling for over 20 years, smart dirt.
[07:39.660 --> 07:45.500]  You probably saw that transhumanist propaganda with Johnny Depp, transcendence, where he
[07:45.500 --> 07:53.380]  becomes the supercomputer and dissolves into dust that then goes into the atmosphere and
[07:53.380 --> 07:57.740]  impregnates all human bodies, all plants, all animals, and that the entire planet is
[07:57.740 --> 08:02.380]  now an AI dust and he is a guardian that will save the earth.
[08:02.380 --> 08:07.620]  That is Silicon Valley's Antichrist statement to you.
[08:07.620 --> 08:12.060]  So here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the rollout.
[08:12.060 --> 08:18.220]  If you think they're violating your bodily rights, if you think they're raping you with
[08:18.220 --> 08:22.500]  attempting to force deadly shots that are mRNA that change your whole makeup, that change
[08:22.500 --> 08:26.460]  the inside of your cells, that program your cells to create poisonous spike proteins for
[08:26.460 --> 08:30.420]  the rest of your life, that erase your immune system.
[08:30.420 --> 08:36.940]  If you think that's bad, imagine it being put in all the major food chain supply and
[08:36.940 --> 08:39.980]  then the companies just say, Hey, the UN legalized it.
[08:40.500 --> 08:46.180]  It wasn't even approved by the FDA, but we don't care just like these shots.
[08:46.180 --> 08:51.200]  We're now going to put all this nanotech on your food, whether you like it or not.
[08:51.200 --> 08:55.060]  So you thought it was bad to have GMO crops that in many of the studies are linked to
[08:55.060 --> 08:56.940]  infertility.
[08:56.940 --> 09:00.780]  You thought it was bad to be seeing all these illnesses and cancer cropping up in all the
[09:00.780 --> 09:04.460]  studies of lab rats that are fed the same stuff we're being fed.
[09:04.460 --> 09:05.460]  You thought it was bad.
[09:05.460 --> 09:12.980]  They might engineer into the very vegetables and fruits you eat, quote, live vaccine, which
[09:12.980 --> 09:17.340]  is really just a viral attack or reprogramming your body.
[09:17.340 --> 09:22.460]  Now they're announcing that they're rolling out with the UN and demanding starting with
[09:22.460 --> 09:30.100]  third world populations, that they take smart dust in to all of the products that then can
[09:30.100 --> 09:32.460]  be tracked and read and scanned.
[09:32.460 --> 09:39.140]  And that you then ingest that they claim are safe, that they then say, become part of your
[09:39.140 --> 09:40.140]  body.
[09:40.140 --> 09:44.940]  Remember I covered that a few days ago from the Davos group, the announcements that they
[09:44.940 --> 09:50.200]  made about how, if you are human, you'll be obsolete soon, and that they're going to put
[09:50.200 --> 09:55.020]  living entities into your bodies that are microscopic, that then take control of your
[09:55.020 --> 09:57.420]  brain.
[09:57.420 --> 09:59.260]  That's what Nobel prize winners are calling for.
[09:59.420 --> 10:02.380]  And they're saying it'll end all war, we'll all be one mind.
[10:02.380 --> 10:07.060]  Yeah, under their control in their nightmare, virtual reality now rolled out and launched
[10:07.060 --> 10:08.060]  by Zuckerberg.
[10:08.060 --> 10:15.080]  Yeah, that's the book, Homo Deuce, A Brief History of Tomorrow.
[10:15.080 --> 10:16.940]  That's what the Davos group is putting out.
[10:16.940 --> 10:20.280]  It's all there, already played the clips.
[10:20.280 --> 10:23.380]  So let's go through some of the background of this and then get into the latest developments
[10:23.380 --> 10:26.380]  right now.
[10:26.380 --> 10:29.420]  Replicating the nanotechnology and COVID-19 vaccines.
[10:29.420 --> 10:33.060]  That's from cas.org, major universities reporting it.
[10:33.060 --> 10:38.620]  It is nanotechnology, it is in the vaccines that are not vaccines, it is self replicating
[10:38.620 --> 10:39.620]  in the body.
[10:39.620 --> 10:42.380]  And we're going to list what is in there.
[10:42.380 --> 10:50.620]  Nanolipids and microscopic carbon based metal that then begins replicating off of your body's
[10:50.620 --> 10:55.740]  own enzymes and own nutrients and oxygen and chemicals.
[10:55.780 --> 10:56.780]  And then acid nanoparticles.
[10:56.780 --> 10:58.820]  Let's move on to the next one.
[10:58.820 --> 11:02.900]  Anybody can go read this for yourself.
[11:02.900 --> 11:08.340]  Here's one from patents at google.com.
[11:08.340 --> 11:16.380]  Nano coronavirus recombinant vaccines, graphite oxide as the carrier, which then goes through
[11:16.380 --> 11:17.380]  the blood brain barrier.
[11:17.380 --> 11:20.780]  Then it gets into how it's magnetic, controls you.
[11:20.780 --> 11:22.980]  And I'm going to show you the new stuff in a minute.
[11:22.980 --> 11:29.620]  Microsoft patents cutting edge human powered crypto mining system, blockchain.news.
[11:29.620 --> 11:33.980]  We reported this back when it was there and Bill Gates came out and said, it's not true.
[11:33.980 --> 11:36.940]  I'm not patenting anything to be put in your body, even though it's all admitted.
[11:36.940 --> 11:41.580]  Remember, he said with his wife on TV, oh, I promise, honey, we're not doing that.
[11:41.580 --> 11:45.420]  She found out he was a liar and left him.
[11:45.420 --> 11:55.940]  Remember, paramagnetic nanoparticle delivery of DNA vaccine, pub med, federal government.
[11:55.940 --> 11:58.060]  There's a direct link to it.
[11:58.060 --> 11:59.060]  NIH.gov.
[11:59.060 --> 12:02.340]  See that right there?
[12:02.340 --> 12:07.860]  Bill Gates chooses corporate patent rights over human lives.
[12:07.860 --> 12:11.540]  Here's some of the patents with the cryptocurrency that's tied to nanoparticles in your body
[12:11.540 --> 12:14.740]  that tracks and traces everything you do.
[12:14.740 --> 12:15.740]  This is the number on it.
[12:15.740 --> 12:19.580]  There's a whole bunch more of these two all by these folks.
[12:19.580 --> 12:27.460]  Here's another one, US10702600B1, similar systems tied into Bill Gates and the rest
[12:27.460 --> 12:30.700]  of them.
[12:30.700 --> 12:35.780]  Understanding the nanotechnology and COVID-19 vaccines.
[12:35.780 --> 12:43.080]  Food as production delivery vehicles for human vaccines.
[12:43.080 --> 12:49.280]  Grow and eat your own vaccines, University of California.
[12:49.280 --> 12:54.800]  Edible vaccines, Scientific American.
[12:54.800 --> 12:58.200]  Ten secrets that you didn't know about nano entities.
[12:58.200 --> 13:02.320]  Now let's go where the Davos Group went last week when they announced in their official
[13:02.320 --> 13:07.840]  statement that these nano entities are going to have rights and these nano entities are
[13:07.840 --> 13:11.920]  just going to be sprayed on you from the air and put in your food until they take over
[13:11.920 --> 13:12.920]  your bodies.
[13:12.920 --> 13:16.840]  And then you're not going to be able to live unless you get new nano injections all the
[13:16.840 --> 13:17.840]  time.
[13:17.840 --> 13:19.400]  And you're like, well, they'll all go to prison.
[13:19.400 --> 13:20.720]  I mean, they're all going to go to jail, really.
[13:20.720 --> 13:24.200]  They've already killed millions of people with the shots, ADEs already spreading around
[13:24.200 --> 13:25.200]  the world.
[13:25.200 --> 13:26.200]  Hospitals are already full of those.
[13:26.200 --> 13:29.640]  They're having horrible autoimmune response to the injections because now they have a
[13:29.640 --> 13:35.080]  bad autoimmune response to any virus they come in contact with.
[13:35.080 --> 13:40.480]  And they've put out these press releases that I'll show you from the Davos Group explaining
[13:40.480 --> 13:44.400]  how they're going to put these nanoparticles in you under the U.N. Food Council that's
[13:44.400 --> 13:46.320]  now suddenly in charge of everything.
[13:46.320 --> 13:49.880]  And the U.N. is in the news saying they'll decide what you can say and can't say about
[13:49.880 --> 13:50.880]  the shots.
[13:50.880 --> 13:54.400]  Oh, we don't let U.S. senators talk about natural immunity and how good it is.
[13:54.400 --> 14:01.240]  Yahoo said and Reuters said and CNN said and Google said because the U.N. said you can't
[14:01.240 --> 14:02.640]  say that.
[14:02.640 --> 14:05.040]  That's official.
[14:05.040 --> 14:08.360]  So here's a shepherd's heartbreak now that links to Davos Group and their actual statements.
[14:08.360 --> 14:10.160]  This is an excellent article.
[14:10.160 --> 14:14.880]  Ten secrets that you didn't know about nano entities.
[14:14.880 --> 14:15.880]  That's what they call them.
[14:15.880 --> 14:16.880]  They call them nano entities.
[14:16.880 --> 14:21.680]  And what did the Davos Group spokesman say last week?
[14:21.680 --> 14:22.680]  He's written a bunch of books about it.
[14:22.680 --> 14:28.640]  He said, we have nano entities that are going to take over your brain and there'll be nothing
[14:28.640 --> 14:31.080]  but peace.
[14:31.080 --> 14:34.200]  Nothing but peace, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:34.200 --> 14:38.640]  So let's read the article integration of nanomaterials into the entire food supply.
[14:38.640 --> 14:39.640]  That's a whole link.
[14:39.640 --> 14:46.320]  And that's Davos Group installation of artificial intelligent nanoparticles for agro food inspection,
[14:46.320 --> 14:53.460]  hybrid probes installed in foods that insert platforms into your body, injection of nanobodies
[14:53.460 --> 14:54.460]  into your food.
[14:54.460 --> 14:56.100]  You're like, this is over the top.
[14:56.100 --> 14:57.100]  They'll never do it.
[14:57.100 --> 15:01.080]  They'll never give five year olds and up the deadly shot that's killed so many.
[15:01.080 --> 15:05.700]  World Economic Forum informed us that our food supply was going to be disrupted beginning
[15:05.700 --> 15:06.920]  last year.
[15:06.920 --> 15:13.200]  Agro food inspection is going high tech with newly constructed hybrid micro nano entities.
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.900]  Yes, you read that correctly and there's links to all of it.
[15:17.900 --> 15:24.100]  Hybrid nanoparticles are micro nano entities and these nano entities are not only going
[15:24.100 --> 15:29.160]  into the food supply, but also into the pharmaceutical products and you can link there and there's
[15:29.160 --> 15:34.020]  articles everywhere about small chips to track pills.
[15:34.020 --> 15:37.980]  There is much speculation about what these entities are and what did Bill Gates announced
[15:37.980 --> 15:38.980]  last week?
[15:38.980 --> 15:40.240]  He said, what did the Davos Group announced last week?
[15:40.240 --> 15:43.140]  What did BlackRock type this in?
[15:43.140 --> 15:50.420]  BlackRock says the entire new future and the next 1000 billionaires will all be in nanotech
[15:50.420 --> 15:55.120]  biosensors in the economy.
[15:55.120 --> 15:57.460]  Biosensors in the sewage.
[15:57.460 --> 15:59.100]  Biosensors in the air.
[15:59.100 --> 16:00.800]  Biosensors in your house.
[16:00.800 --> 16:02.440]  Biosensors in the schools.
[16:02.440 --> 16:07.280]  All scanning you and telling you and just like the PCR test, all fraudulent to disappear
[16:07.280 --> 16:09.160]  you with the contact tracers.
[16:09.160 --> 16:11.640]  Total AI surveillance.
[16:11.640 --> 16:17.680]  You wonder where they go next whenever they have home assistants in your houses that you
[16:17.680 --> 16:20.120]  willingly brought in that listen and watch.
[16:20.120 --> 16:27.520]  Well now they're saying you won't have a choice.
[16:27.520 --> 16:35.780]  The definition of entities is something that exists as a particular and discrete unit.
[16:35.780 --> 16:40.580]  You know, like a ghost is an entity to the fact of its existence being three, the existence
[16:40.580 --> 16:43.500]  of something considered apart from its property.
[16:43.500 --> 16:46.780]  So they're going to put outside entities, creatures into you.
[16:46.780 --> 16:51.220]  For purposes of this article, nano entities are self associated aggregates that grouped
[16:51.220 --> 16:56.760]  together to provide a solid lattice from framework growing in your body and they tell you about
[16:56.760 --> 17:02.340]  the graphene oxide, other things that are in the shots now that are helping grow that
[17:02.340 --> 17:05.140]  matrix in your body that can be sensed and scanned.
[17:05.140 --> 17:08.580]  It's growing so well in you and people that have been abused by this, they're not going
[17:08.580 --> 17:10.860]  to want to see themselves as victims.
[17:10.860 --> 17:12.180]  They have Stockholm syndrome.
[17:12.180 --> 17:16.740]  They're they're going to announce their mutants like all the movies and TV shows how cool
[17:16.740 --> 17:19.780]  it is when you're a mutant.
[17:19.780 --> 17:24.840]  These entities are not merely physical surveillance arrays, but include multidimensional aspects
[17:24.840 --> 17:30.180]  they transmit that will be discussed in another article describing below are some of the entities
[17:30.180 --> 17:34.740]  names that you will see soon at your local grocery store, fulfilling the world economics
[17:34.740 --> 17:37.420]  promise to take over the food supply.
[17:37.420 --> 17:43.200]  These entities are not merely physical surveillance arrays, but include multidimensional aspects.
[17:43.200 --> 17:47.020]  Some entities names you're going to see at your local grocery store and it goes on from
[17:47.020 --> 17:49.800]  there.
[17:49.800 --> 17:54.780]  Molecular imprinting polymers integrated with quantum dots.
[17:54.780 --> 17:58.240]  That's already in the money and the food and a lot of the pills.
[17:58.240 --> 18:04.520]  Advanced tools for cell imaging are a great interest of this detection, localization and
[18:04.520 --> 18:09.400]  quantification of molecular biomarkers for infection.
[18:09.400 --> 18:15.020]  This is just the Thanos Thanos scam thousand times bigger.
[18:15.020 --> 18:22.120]  Molecular imprinting polymers integrated and up conversion luminescent nanoparticles.
[18:22.120 --> 18:24.440]  That's in the Pfizer shot.
[18:24.440 --> 18:29.180]  The luminescent jellyfish genes that grow in your body.
[18:29.180 --> 18:42.140]  The UCMPs are tumescent nanoparticles, MPs, that are doped, yes, doped with dyed silica,
[18:42.140 --> 18:49.020]  rare earth ions and fluorescent QDs providing an amazing array suite for food as it goes
[18:49.020 --> 18:53.580]  through the entire cycle, fork, food, body, that's the sewage.
[18:53.580 --> 19:01.280]  For sensing and imaging in analytical chemistry, bio, analytical chemistry, biomedical engineering
[19:01.280 --> 19:05.200]  and environmental science.
[19:05.200 --> 19:10.460]  So just raping and assaulting you with these poisons to protect you, of course.
[19:10.460 --> 19:18.000]  Up conversion luminescent nanoparticles combined with methyl organic frameworks.
[19:18.000 --> 19:24.220]  Metal organic frameworks, MOFs are a class of porous materials prepared by the self assembled
[19:24.220 --> 19:25.220]  metal ions.
[19:25.220 --> 19:30.960]  That's what's in the shots or clusters with organic little guns and again, they want to
[19:30.960 --> 19:31.960]  contaminate everybody with the shots.
[19:31.960 --> 19:35.320]  So when they start bombing the food with it, no one will know where it's coming from and
[19:35.320 --> 19:36.680]  one company won't get in trouble.
[19:36.680 --> 19:38.060]  That's why it's a revolution.
[19:38.060 --> 19:43.820]  They're hitting us all at once, just like in a war, a blitzkrieg to overwhelm you.
[19:43.820 --> 19:46.700]  They are tunable inside your body and controllable.
[19:46.700 --> 19:51.840]  That's from the DEBOS group, meaning they have the power to regulate things such as
[19:51.840 --> 19:55.960]  dispensing of nutrition of food products to comply with international mandates.
[19:55.960 --> 20:02.560]  Well, my goodness, these metal ions form nodes that yoke together repeating cage like structures,
[20:02.560 --> 20:07.940]  creating a fusion, a biological life with machine.
[20:07.940 --> 20:12.040]  Magnetic metal organic frameworks and then it goes on nanosized metal frameworks.
[20:12.040 --> 20:14.700]  You want me to keep going for you?
[20:14.700 --> 20:20.700]  Magnetic covalent organic frameworks, magnetic covalent organic frameworks, the endocrine
[20:20.700 --> 20:27.580]  disrupting or sensing food in the human animal body, which are used as an absorbent form
[20:27.580 --> 20:34.620]  of magnetic extraction of polar endocrine disrupting phenols and for sensing food in
[20:34.620 --> 20:35.620]  the human animal body.
[20:35.620 --> 20:38.300]  Oh, this sounds really loving and liberal.
[20:38.300 --> 20:42.120]  Covalent organic frameworks doped with quantum dots.
[20:42.120 --> 20:44.320]  I love things being dope.
[20:44.320 --> 20:46.320]  That's the term they use being drugged.
[20:46.320 --> 20:53.240]  Quantum dot dope covalent organic frameworks and it goes on were developed for the detection
[20:53.240 --> 21:00.560]  of toxins related insecticides in tap water.
[21:00.560 --> 21:05.680]  And this new system is a poison produced by organisms belonging and it goes on.
[21:05.680 --> 21:08.020]  But don't worry, we'll have sensors now that keep you safe.
[21:08.020 --> 21:11.580]  We've got to put sensors in you to keep you safe from all the stuff we're using on you.
[21:11.580 --> 21:12.700]  Okay, so that's just part of it.
[21:12.700 --> 21:17.620]  Let me show you some more actually from different medical publications, different studies.
[21:17.620 --> 21:24.460]  Here's one functional hybrid micro nanoparticles promote agro food safety inspection by four
[21:24.460 --> 21:29.820]  communist Chinese fellows that are UN commanders, basically.
[21:29.820 --> 21:34.220]  And it goes back into the edible vaccines and all the rest of it right here from science
[21:34.220 --> 21:39.760]  direct and there's just a lot of other ones here, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:39.760 --> 21:45.000]  And then somebody made a joke I thought I'd show on Twitter saying he's definitely a lizard
[21:45.000 --> 21:46.000]  person.
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.240]  Alex Jones was right with a selfie that Zuckerberg put out of the new name, meaning total takeover
[21:51.240 --> 21:56.040]  of all reality meta or infinity, infinity takeover, especially what they really mean
[21:56.040 --> 21:58.000]  by it.
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.380]  And I'm not the one that says everybody's reptiles.
[22:00.380 --> 22:01.380]  That's David Icke.
[22:01.380 --> 22:03.040]  But I mean, gosh, that's the least of our problems.
[22:03.040 --> 22:04.220]  I mean, probably is true.
[22:04.220 --> 22:05.220]  Who knows?
[22:05.220 --> 22:06.220]  I don't speculate.
[22:06.220 --> 22:08.420]  I just know they sure act like vicious crocodiles.
[22:08.420 --> 22:10.940]  They sure act like they're anti-human.
[22:10.940 --> 22:15.180]  And I even was talking to a lawyer yesterday and he goes, you're the guy that thinks reptoids
[22:15.180 --> 22:16.180]  run things.
[22:16.180 --> 22:18.060]  And I'm like, no, that's not me.
[22:18.060 --> 22:22.500]  And I'm not, that's not a bar, but David Icke, I really respect David.
[22:22.500 --> 22:23.620]  They do act like aliens.
[22:23.620 --> 22:25.900]  They are saying carbon-based life forms will be obsolete.
[22:25.900 --> 22:31.460]  In fact, I said I wouldn't play it, but I mean, you got the main spokes for the Davos
[22:31.460 --> 22:35.720]  group, their main future is saying the future won't be human.
[22:35.720 --> 22:37.200]  Nanoparticles will take over your brain.
[22:37.200 --> 22:38.200]  We're colonizing.
[22:38.200 --> 22:42.280]  You got Klaus Schwab saying the fourth industrial revolution will be changing you.
[22:42.280 --> 22:43.700]  We will take you over.
[22:43.700 --> 22:45.620]  We have captured your countries.
[22:45.620 --> 22:47.320]  We are now the only stakeholders.
[22:47.320 --> 22:49.200]  We do not want the people to have control.
[22:49.200 --> 22:51.360]  These are real quotes.
[22:51.360 --> 22:54.640]  And we just sit here while they're announcing, now we're going to inject your five-year-olds
[22:54.640 --> 22:55.640]  and up.
[22:55.640 --> 22:59.660]  And they have the FDA spokesperson saying, well, we don't know if these will hurt kids
[22:59.660 --> 23:00.960]  till we give them to them.
[23:00.960 --> 23:02.960]  I mean, that's a quote.
[23:02.960 --> 23:05.720]  I played that like four times this week.
[23:05.720 --> 23:09.720]  That's what they said in the lead up to things.
[23:09.720 --> 23:13.920]  So they're collapsing everything and they're telling you that a dystopia is a good thing.
[23:13.920 --> 23:18.040]  If you go to the UN building, they have Klaus Schwab Davos group posters hanging up outside
[23:18.040 --> 23:20.280]  of New York, where they were three months ago and shot video of it.
[23:20.280 --> 23:21.280]  It's on Band Out Video.
[23:21.280 --> 23:25.160]  And there's huge posters showing what looks like a concentration camp with like these
[23:25.160 --> 23:27.280]  concrete bunkers.
[23:27.280 --> 23:31.300]  And it says, you will soon not live in an apartment or a home or a city.
[23:31.300 --> 23:32.860]  You will live in a commune.
[23:32.860 --> 23:33.860]  You will own nothing.
[23:33.860 --> 23:34.860]  You will have nothing.
[23:34.860 --> 23:37.580]  And I'm there with the New York police.
[23:37.580 --> 23:41.260]  We had as our hired security great guys, they're like, we haven't been down here in a while.
[23:41.260 --> 23:42.640]  My God, this is insane.
[23:42.640 --> 23:45.720]  And it's all real folks.
[23:45.720 --> 23:46.720]  It's all real.
[23:46.720 --> 23:48.240]  And they're just rolling it out.
[23:48.240 --> 23:52.780]  Just like all the nanotech, just like what they're engaged in with the Pfizer and Moderna
[23:52.780 --> 23:58.180]  shots that aren't even vaccines.
[23:58.180 --> 24:03.220]  I mean, I remember 20 years ago reading the Pentagon's testing on troops on anti-depression,
[24:03.220 --> 24:05.220]  anti-PTSD shot.
[24:05.220 --> 24:09.820]  The shot goes in and takes out areas in the brain associated with depression.
[24:09.820 --> 24:17.900]  Well, those same receptors in the brain that are associated with depression and chemicals
[24:17.900 --> 24:23.900]  are also associated with higher spiritual consciousness, exaltation, exhilaration, feelings
[24:23.900 --> 24:26.980]  of completion, satisfaction.
[24:26.980 --> 24:28.700]  And you wonder why so many troops commit suicide.
[24:28.700 --> 24:33.500]  They've been spiking a lot of the injections they get with live viruses that actually go
[24:33.500 --> 24:36.480]  in and eat part of the brain.
[24:36.480 --> 24:40.660]  So when you hear the word vaccine, that just means some Franken shot that the system is
[24:40.660 --> 24:42.460]  trying to put into your body.
[24:42.460 --> 24:51.980]  So I thought tonight we would talk some about this situation and where we are and what we
[24:51.980 --> 24:55.560]  face as a society.
[24:55.560 --> 25:04.020]  And there was also a Japanese TV show called Vaxxile or exiled via the vaccines that we'll
[25:04.020 --> 25:09.780]  play here in a moment, just a few minutes from it that basically mirrors what's happening
[25:09.780 --> 25:10.780]  in the real world.
[25:10.780 --> 25:13.260]  And you ask yourself, how are they able to do that?
[25:13.260 --> 25:14.380]  Well, I know what happens.
[25:14.380 --> 25:15.380]  You get approached.
[25:15.380 --> 25:19.100]  It hasn't only happened to me, but happened to Chris Carter and a lot of others.
[25:19.100 --> 25:20.100]  Chris has talked about it.
[25:20.100 --> 25:23.460]  I told you about Chris talking about it before he ever went public about it.
[25:23.460 --> 25:33.260]  And I was told about the cast and then Carter reached out and the CIA would come to them
[25:33.260 --> 25:35.100]  and say, here's the script we want.
[25:35.100 --> 25:39.820]  And they just learned we get picked back up by Fox if we run the script again.
[25:39.860 --> 25:42.860]  And that's called predictive programming because they get your subconscious mind ready for
[25:42.860 --> 25:43.860]  it.
[25:43.860 --> 25:46.340]  So that when it actually happens, even though you saw it in a horror movie and didn't like
[25:46.340 --> 25:49.820]  what happened, your brain is made to make you overcome something.
[25:49.820 --> 25:53.600]  So you kind of get used to it and kind of subconsciously your brain gets you ready for
[25:53.600 --> 25:54.600]  it.
[25:54.600 --> 25:59.300]  You see how that works unless you consciously decide this is bad and that are conscious
[25:59.300 --> 26:00.500]  of the manipulation.
[26:00.500 --> 26:03.140]  If you're not conscious, my show hurts you.
[26:03.140 --> 26:07.420]  If you're not really focused on this and really getting it at a high cognitive level, then
[26:07.420 --> 26:10.240]  you just get more conditioned and prepared for all this, you understand?
[26:10.240 --> 26:13.300]  And that's what that globalist told me that time in that first class flight on American
[26:13.300 --> 26:15.300]  Airlines going to New York.
[26:15.300 --> 26:19.060]  I've told so many times, he said, you don't get it, Alex, people don't adapt and overcome
[26:19.060 --> 26:22.940]  like the Marines say, they adapt and succumb.
[26:22.940 --> 26:24.340]  They adapt and succumb.
[26:24.340 --> 26:25.340]  That was what he said.
[26:25.340 --> 26:29.360]  He laughed at me and said, you're on the wrong team.
[26:29.360 --> 26:30.860]  You will fail.
[26:30.860 --> 26:36.420]  Well, I know God's real, I know justice is real and you guys are not empowering humanity
[26:36.420 --> 26:37.420]  in doing this.
[26:37.420 --> 26:38.420]  And it's you that's going to fail.
[26:38.420 --> 26:45.420]  This is all a spiritual test, but I don't want to continue to be the person that breaks
[26:45.420 --> 26:49.560]  the big news.
[26:49.560 --> 26:53.820]  I know you probably get tired of having to fight to warn people, but you know, you should
[26:53.820 --> 26:57.380]  get excited about it because we got a good chance of stopping this fork.
[26:57.380 --> 26:58.380]  It's really bad.
[26:58.380 --> 26:59.380]  But regardless, God's watching.
[26:59.380 --> 27:00.980]  We've got a responsibility to expose this.
[27:00.980 --> 27:07.740]  And they're just rolling out on every front, a program of quote, blowing up the old system
[27:07.740 --> 27:13.140]  that has checks and balances and wasn't perfect, but that had some controls on evil.
[27:13.140 --> 27:16.860]  And we've seen the top scientists in the FDA, number one and number two quit a few months
[27:16.860 --> 27:18.740]  ago and say, these shots are poison.
[27:18.740 --> 27:19.740]  Don't get booster shots.
[27:19.740 --> 27:20.740]  Don't approve it.
[27:20.740 --> 27:24.060]  Below the age of 16, even that we should be pulling these vaccines.
[27:24.060 --> 27:27.420]  So they had to bring in whole new boards and whole new groups, and then they wouldn't vote
[27:27.420 --> 27:28.420]  for it.
[27:28.860 --> 27:32.580]  So we're in the third round to bring in a new board members, almost all of them from
[27:32.580 --> 27:39.460]  big pharma to finally, finally do this.
[27:39.460 --> 27:43.020]  And to finally say, we're coming at five-year-olds and up with something that doesn't even attack
[27:43.020 --> 27:45.100]  five-year-olds.
[27:45.100 --> 27:49.260]  And we know the shots with their incredibly alive immune system just absolutely triggers
[27:49.260 --> 27:52.900]  ADE even worse than in adults.
[27:52.900 --> 27:56.260]  And if you remember Fauci said in 2019, we need to blow up the old system using a new
[27:56.260 --> 28:00.980]  deadly virus as the pretext to totally take over so we can roll out any drug we want,
[28:00.980 --> 28:02.480]  anytime we want, anywhere we want.
[28:02.480 --> 28:03.820]  And it's not to empower us.
[28:03.820 --> 28:10.860]  They're not just testing, you know, deadly drugs on little African children just because
[28:10.860 --> 28:12.340]  they want to find some cure to help them.
[28:12.340 --> 28:15.140]  They're doing it because they like the power of killing.
[28:15.140 --> 28:19.540]  And they like the power of being able to get away with it with those doctors and scientists
[28:19.540 --> 28:24.500]  that take part in those very evil experiments to then recruit them into higher levels of
[28:24.500 --> 28:25.500]  the system.
[28:25.740 --> 28:29.540]  Preparing this army of mad scientists for the takeover, you're now witnessing.
[28:29.540 --> 28:33.860]  I tried to recruit my father when he was in high school and he figured out what was going
[28:33.860 --> 28:36.100]  on by the time he was in college.
[28:36.100 --> 28:42.660]  He was going to UT when he was 15, part of plan two, and they tried to recruit him into
[28:42.660 --> 28:43.940]  all this and he got out of it.
[28:43.940 --> 28:48.100]  He didn't tell me about it until I made the film Endgame now 15 years ago.
[28:48.100 --> 28:50.220]  I mean, I already knew about some of it for my grandma and stuff.
[28:50.220 --> 28:54.840]  And I knew he'd been involved in all these, you know, government programs and things as
[28:54.840 --> 28:58.760]  an intern when he was 15 years old at cancer research facilities and things like that.
[28:58.760 --> 29:04.680]  But they were recruiting people that would give lethal injections to people at cancer
[29:04.680 --> 29:06.960]  research facilities and things like that.
[29:06.960 --> 29:11.600]  So they've built this army over the last 50, 60 years.
[29:11.600 --> 29:17.000]  I guess that was like 60 years ago or almost 60 years ago with my dad.
[29:17.000 --> 29:23.720]  And that's why Fauci ran thousands of studies taking little black children, mainly they
[29:23.720 --> 29:26.840]  took some whites as well, but mainly black children.
[29:26.840 --> 29:30.820]  And they would take them who didn't even have HIV and they would test experimental drugs
[29:30.820 --> 29:31.820]  on them until they died.
[29:31.820 --> 29:36.400]  And when the mothers would complain, they'd say, well, take your baby if you don't shut
[29:36.400 --> 29:37.400]  up.
[29:37.400 --> 29:39.920]  I mean, that came out in the New York Times and Washington Post in the nineties.
[29:39.920 --> 29:46.680]  I remember covering and Bayer knew that millions of doses of factor eight had HIV and hepatitis
[29:46.680 --> 29:47.680]  in it.
[29:47.680 --> 29:50.440]  And it was in their corporate minutes out of Australia and France.
[29:50.440 --> 29:52.400]  They said, forget these hemophiliacs.
[29:52.400 --> 29:53.400]  There's too many of them.
[29:54.080 --> 29:55.080]  Let them die.
[29:55.080 --> 29:56.720]  Let's get rid of them.
[29:56.720 --> 30:01.280]  So they knowingly, not just for profit, knowingly put HIV in there.
[30:01.280 --> 30:04.000]  And that goes back to the Clintons and the Arkansas blood scandal.
[30:04.000 --> 30:08.320]  I mean, everything I say, or you could spend days researching it to blow you away, Arkansas
[30:08.320 --> 30:18.680]  blood scandal, CDC, FDA, NIH, illegally testing on foster children, drugs.
[30:18.680 --> 30:19.680]  That's all.
[30:19.960 --> 30:24.840]  You could spend weeks just reading all the stuff on that, but I'll tell you what's scary.
[30:24.840 --> 30:29.200]  25, 30 years ago, this stuff was all in the news and people were upset.
[30:29.200 --> 30:33.400]  When in Dallas, in Chicago, they were killing people that had car wrecks who weren't even
[30:33.400 --> 30:38.840]  hurt mentally, but who had a broken back and they were 18 years old and healthy.
[30:38.840 --> 30:42.280]  They'd kill your ass and make hundreds of thousands of dollars on your organs.
[30:42.280 --> 30:45.360]  That used to be on 60 minutes, by the way, I knew it was real.
[30:45.360 --> 30:48.040]  Cause my dad had people in Dallas that were, he didn't support it.
[30:48.040 --> 30:49.600]  He knew hospitals that were killing people.
[30:49.600 --> 30:54.280]  He told me, he told me about it.
[30:54.280 --> 30:55.280]  Now they don't even care.
[30:55.280 --> 30:56.280]  You don't hear a damn thing.
[30:56.280 --> 30:59.960]  Governor Northam goes on TV in Virginia and says, we keep babies alive and harvest their
[30:59.960 --> 31:02.840]  organs after they're born, but we keep them comfortable.
[31:02.840 --> 31:09.120]  You understand the bottom has dropped out and that's where we are as a society and as
[31:09.120 --> 31:10.120]  a country.
[31:10.120 --> 31:14.500]  So I'm going to go to break and I'm going to play a short little clip here from the
[31:14.500 --> 31:20.580]  Japanese TV show from 2007, and then we'll come right back with Tucker Carlson news and
[31:20.580 --> 31:21.580]  then Leo Zagami.
[31:21.580 --> 31:22.580]  I'm Alex Jones.
[31:22.580 --> 31:23.580]  Please stay with us.
[31:23.580 --> 31:30.300]  It was 10 years ago, just after the government instituted the whole isolation policy.
[31:30.300 --> 31:36.540]  We began hearing reports of a mass epidemic, some unknown disease sweeping the country.
[31:36.540 --> 31:41.740]  The details were vague at first, nothing on the cause or transmission of the disease.
[31:41.740 --> 31:47.820]  Only that it was highly contagious and in most cases fatal before the general public
[31:47.820 --> 31:52.260]  even had time to react, the government declared a state of emergency and ordered a mandatory
[31:52.260 --> 31:57.020]  vaccination program for our protection, they said.
[31:57.020 --> 32:02.940]  As it turns out, that was the beginning of our nightmare.
[32:02.940 --> 32:08.100]  The disease was a complete government fabrication and the supposed vaccine they were injecting
[32:08.100 --> 32:09.560]  into everyone.
[32:09.560 --> 32:16.820]  In reality, it was a cyber virus developed by Daiwa.
[32:16.820 --> 32:19.960]  The virus has a mutating effect on the cells of the body.
[32:19.960 --> 32:24.920]  It alters their molecular structure and converts them into biometal, essentially turning us
[32:24.920 --> 32:29.440]  into machines from the inside out.
[32:29.440 --> 32:31.320]  There's no way to stop it.
[32:31.320 --> 32:35.800]  And to make things worse, the cyber virus was still early in its experimental phase.
[32:35.800 --> 32:38.120]  What do you mean?
[32:38.120 --> 32:42.720]  Daiwa didn't even know if it would work, it had never been tested on a large scale.
[32:42.720 --> 32:47.920]  So they turned Japan into their own private laboratory.
[32:47.920 --> 32:52.080]  When it does work, the virus gradually progresses through the body until it finally reaches
[32:52.080 --> 32:53.400]  the brain.
[32:53.400 --> 32:59.480]  At that point, we become perfect androids under Daiwa's control.
[32:59.480 --> 33:03.160]  The speed of the process differs from person to person.
[33:03.160 --> 33:09.040]  Those of us who have yet to be fully assimilated, as best we can, we hold on to those fragments
[33:09.040 --> 33:12.000]  of our humanity that still remain.
[33:12.000 --> 33:17.720]  But even now, we can feel them slipping further and further away.
[33:17.720 --> 33:22.200]  Since the technology was still experimental, in the end most of us will basically be reduced
[33:22.200 --> 33:23.580]  to scrap metal.
[33:23.580 --> 33:24.580]  But it makes little difference.
[33:24.580 --> 33:29.360]  At best, we're still mindless machines with our memories erased.
[33:29.360 --> 33:36.320]  So either way, we're all just Daiwa's guinea pigs, trapped and waiting to die.
[33:36.320 --> 33:42.120]  Do you know how long you have?
[33:42.120 --> 33:43.520]  No.
[33:43.520 --> 33:48.000]  What we do know is, Daiwa won't stop when they're done with Japan.
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.480]  They'll target America next.
[33:52.480 --> 33:56.160]  They've already started planting androids in key positions.
[33:56.160 --> 34:01.960]  That politician...
[34:01.960 --> 34:09.640]  It...
[34:09.640 --> 34:15.200]  Scientists have been designing ways to put their so called vaccines in the food supply.
[34:15.200 --> 34:19.640]  And it seems they may have created an avenue to begin this.
[34:19.640 --> 34:25.740]  Brought to you by the American Chemical Society and four scientists from Communist China,
[34:25.740 --> 34:32.520]  functional hybrid micro-nano entities are being implemented to promote food safety.
[34:32.520 --> 34:39.060]  To detect hazardous substances in agricultural food products, they are putting in experimental
[34:39.060 --> 34:42.380]  hazardous substances.
[34:42.380 --> 34:48.460]  Molecular imprinting polymers integrated with quantum dots installs a surveillance platform
[34:48.460 --> 34:51.500]  into your food and body.
[34:51.500 --> 34:57.860]  Molecular imprinting polymers integrated with up-conversion luminescent nanoparticles conducts
[34:57.860 --> 35:01.140]  chemical analysis of your food and body.
[35:01.140 --> 35:07.740]  Up-conversion luminescent nanoparticles combined with metal-organic frameworks are tunable
[35:07.740 --> 35:13.880]  porous metals that have the power to regulate the dispensing of nutrition to comply with
[35:13.880 --> 35:16.700]  international mandates.
[35:16.700 --> 35:23.820]  Magnetic metal-organic frameworks are metal frameworks designed for targeting drug delivery.
[35:23.820 --> 35:30.140]  Magnetic covalent organic frameworks are used for sensing food in the human body.
[35:30.140 --> 35:37.980]  And covalent organic frameworks doped with quantum dots are used for detection of insecticides.
[35:37.980 --> 35:43.780]  If they wanted to regulate healthy food, they would promote organic growing, not inject
[35:43.780 --> 35:49.280]  a cocktail of metallic nanotech into the entire food supply.

[36:41.800 --> 36:42.800]  on.
[36:43.320 --> 36:44.320]  10 percent off.
[36:44.320 --> 36:45.800]  Last time of the year that deal's happening.
[36:45.800 --> 36:49.560]  It's all available now at Infowarsstore.com.
[36:49.560 --> 36:52.440]  The Black Friday sale comes early.
[36:52.440 --> 36:56.180]  It's going right now for the next two weeks and it supports the Infowar.
[36:56.180 --> 36:57.840]  Take action now and get prepared.
[37:04.180 --> 37:10.400]  Well the Democrat gubernatorial candidate is in a lot of trouble, McAuliffe.
[37:10.400 --> 37:15.040]  He's behind even in establishment polls in Virginia and they've thrown everything they
[37:15.040 --> 37:21.160]  can against the Republican businessman candidate and the state wants to say no to critical
[37:21.160 --> 37:25.400]  race theory and pedophile drag queen story time and all the rest of the brainwashing
[37:25.400 --> 37:26.400]  that's going on.
[37:26.400 --> 37:30.180]  They want to stop keeping babies alive after they're born and selling their body parts
[37:30.180 --> 37:34.620]  as Governor Northam or Governor Blackface is doing.
[37:34.620 --> 37:38.020]  And so they know that there's a huge landslide happening there and they're gonna have trouble
[37:38.140 --> 37:43.100]  with their electronic voting machines and their mail-in ballots stealing it.
[37:43.100 --> 37:47.060]  So what are they doing, ladies and gentlemen?
[37:47.060 --> 37:56.260]  Well they've been caught pulling a false flag and it's blown up completely in their face
[37:56.260 --> 37:59.020]  in a big, big, big way.
[37:59.020 --> 38:01.760]  And why is this so important?
[38:01.760 --> 38:06.860]  As I said earlier, this is a lot bigger than Alex Jones four years ago saying most the
[38:06.860 --> 38:12.140]  Tiki Torch guys are former Obama and Clinton staffers.
[38:12.140 --> 38:16.980]  And then I even went out and interviewed with my reporters and had them admit, well yeah,
[38:16.980 --> 38:21.500]  just a couple years ago I worked for Obama, but I don't like Obama now.
[38:21.500 --> 38:24.060]  Now I'm a white nationalist.
[38:24.060 --> 38:29.380]  And we sent reporters there to Charlottesville and we showed how a lot of the Tiki Torch
[38:29.380 --> 38:32.300]  leaders were leftists.
[38:32.300 --> 38:35.780]  Now some real people showed up and a lot of journalists showed up and Soros and others
[38:35.780 --> 38:39.860]  that were funding it were trying to collide using the state police, the right-wingers
[38:39.860 --> 38:40.860]  into the left-wingers.
[38:40.860 --> 38:43.380]  That's why Trump said there were good people on both sides.
[38:43.380 --> 38:46.580]  There were some liberals that came out who really think the statues are bad and that's
[38:46.580 --> 38:47.580]  their right to think that.
[38:47.580 --> 38:52.740]  There were some leftists that were Democratic Party operatives trying to create a crisis.
[38:52.740 --> 38:55.780]  There were some people just out there as journalists wanting to cover the statues, others that
[38:55.780 --> 38:59.180]  just thought it's part of heritage shouldn't get rid of them, I tend to agree with them.
[38:59.180 --> 39:04.540]  And then some that were actual real white supremacists and then a bunch of leftist provocateurs
[39:04.660 --> 39:06.980]  that had started the whole thing were trying to lead the thing.
[39:06.980 --> 39:09.500]  Yeah, that guy they just put on screen.
[39:09.500 --> 39:12.140]  I had that guy on the show, former Obama staffer.
[39:12.140 --> 39:13.460]  He came on my show.
[39:13.460 --> 39:18.500]  He didn't sue me for saying he was helping stir it up and really a Democrat operative
[39:18.500 --> 39:20.460]  because it's admitted.
[39:20.460 --> 39:25.540]  But they had a man who took the photo of the woman getting run over, sue me and say that
[39:25.540 --> 39:27.060]  I said he killed that woman.
[39:27.060 --> 39:28.620]  I never said that.
[39:28.620 --> 39:33.140]  I said the Democrats and the establishment knew they could have a big clash and hoping
[39:33.140 --> 39:37.540]  something bad would happen and then they would use that as a pretext to blame Trump
[39:37.540 --> 39:40.060]  and claim that all of us that supported Trump are racist.
[39:40.060 --> 39:41.220]  That's what I said.
[39:41.220 --> 39:49.540]  And Georgetown, the Vatican, the CIA, Georgetown Law Clinic, their free speech clinic has been
[39:49.540 --> 39:57.640]  suing me trying to bankrupt us for four years and falsely claimed that we said that a photographer
[39:57.640 --> 40:02.260]  murdered a woman when all we said was, hey, we had these guys on the show and they admit
[40:02.300 --> 40:07.100]  they used to work for Obama and I think they're still doing that because Soros got caught
[40:07.100 --> 40:14.620]  funding other tiki torch people as white supremacists in Ukraine.
[40:14.620 --> 40:17.780]  We're not saying the people in Charlottesville were the same ones.
[40:17.780 --> 40:19.620]  We're saying that was in the news too.
[40:19.620 --> 40:23.100]  So they conflated all that, sued us.
[40:23.100 --> 40:27.540]  We even showed all this in court and the judges said, then go ahead with it.
[40:27.540 --> 40:32.060]  But even the local paper had to admit in Charlottesville, they said, yeah, where did
[40:32.060 --> 40:33.700]  Jones ever say anything bad?
[40:33.700 --> 40:38.660]  Where did Jones ever say this guy did any of the things he Jones didn't, but they don't
[40:38.660 --> 40:42.100]  care you see, because the goal is to take us off air.
[40:42.100 --> 40:43.580]  The goal is to silence us.
[40:43.580 --> 40:54.900]  So this is a big deal for me because I remember Jesse Smollett came out one morning at like
[40:54.900 --> 40:59.420]  4 AM and said that he'd been attacked by men throwing bleach on him up in Chicago at two
[40:59.420 --> 41:02.700]  30 in the morning when it was 23 below zero when he went to subway.
[41:02.700 --> 41:07.020]  Well, I looked it up, subway wasn't opened then by his house.
[41:07.020 --> 41:10.060]  And I saw the police video, a little rope around his neck later and what a joke.
[41:10.060 --> 41:12.660]  Of course it was staged, but I came out the first person.
[41:12.660 --> 41:15.100]  I said, I don't care if I get sued to my right to say it.
[41:15.100 --> 41:16.100]  I think that was staged.
[41:16.100 --> 41:20.900]  And of course it was staged.
[41:20.900 --> 41:23.940]  And I've said the Bubba Wallace thing was, was more of that.
[41:23.940 --> 41:26.860]  And I said that the Jewish center is getting attacked in New Jersey.
[41:26.860 --> 41:29.980]  I bet that staged and it turned out it was staged.
[41:29.980 --> 41:35.980]  I mean, I said, when somebody drew the N word at the air force Academy candy machines, vending
[41:35.980 --> 41:39.740]  machines that it was staged and it was an officer ordered the guy to do it.
[41:39.740 --> 41:43.100]  So this is all part of having us divide and conquer each other.
[41:43.100 --> 41:47.980]  It's how empires control people, but that's not why this is important.
[41:47.980 --> 41:52.940]  That's secondary that Alex Jones has vindicated.
[41:52.940 --> 41:57.120]  The issue is here, ladies and gentlemen, is that they're never going to let me have
[41:57.120 --> 41:58.120]  a day in court.
[41:58.120 --> 42:03.260]  Just like in Texas, I was defaulted saying, I never gave them any evidence, never gave
[42:03.260 --> 42:04.260]  them what they subpoenaed.
[42:04.260 --> 42:07.900]  You're not even supposed to subpoena people's bank records and all their personal stuff
[42:07.900 --> 42:12.020]  and their phone records and everything in a, in a case of defamation or liable.
[42:12.020 --> 42:13.400]  You're supposed to say, what did they say?
[42:13.400 --> 42:14.400]  Is it true or not?
[42:14.400 --> 42:19.580]  And did they do it on purpose to be mean, but see, they can't let me have a jury trial
[42:19.580 --> 42:25.460]  because then the jury would know what the things they said about me were not true.
[42:25.460 --> 42:30.300]  And they'd see why I questioned things and how legitimate it was to question things and
[42:30.300 --> 42:33.140]  how it's all right.
[42:33.140 --> 42:36.660]  But you see, it's the same thing in Virginia.
[42:36.660 --> 42:39.340]  It's the same thing in Connecticut.
[42:39.340 --> 42:45.340]  They're trying to say, I'm going to be defaulted for giving them no of, of what they asked
[42:45.340 --> 42:49.820]  for when they asked for things that are impossible and do not exist because they can't let me
[42:49.820 --> 42:52.980]  get in front of a Virginia jury.
[42:52.980 --> 42:56.380]  When I never said any things they said, and I had the people on the show saying they'd
[42:56.380 --> 42:57.380]  worked for Obama.
[42:57.380 --> 43:01.580]  And it was my opinion and view that they were being funded to do this.
[43:01.580 --> 43:04.120]  And then we have a long history of this.
[43:04.120 --> 43:10.500]  So again, that's why I'm getting into this is they don't have cases.
[43:10.500 --> 43:14.060]  And so that's why they don't ever want me to get to a jury instead of the default, which
[43:14.060 --> 43:15.060]  is extremely rare.
[43:15.060 --> 43:18.300]  A lot of courts don't even argue that it's not even legal or lawful and that they don't
[43:18.300 --> 43:19.860]  really exist.
[43:19.860 --> 43:23.940]  If the person shows up to court, that's just my like runs off to Mexico.
[43:23.940 --> 43:27.900]  Then I guess you can have a default judgment.
[43:27.900 --> 43:33.940]  They can't allow me in there because they're now going to have in Texas, a jury trial of
[43:33.940 --> 43:35.140]  how guilty I am.
[43:35.140 --> 43:39.260]  So you're not just guilty until proven innocent.
[43:39.260 --> 43:40.600]  That's the opposite of American law.
[43:40.600 --> 43:42.320]  You're innocent until proven guilty.
[43:42.320 --> 43:47.680]  You're now guilty and we're going to decide how guilty you are.
[43:47.680 --> 43:52.840]  By claiming falsely, we never gave them any evidence or we never gave them what they asked
[43:52.840 --> 43:53.840]  for.
[43:53.840 --> 43:56.360]  I remember my lawyers are like, this is preposterous to give them everything.
[43:56.360 --> 43:58.080]  And I said, I have nothing to hide, do it.
[43:58.080 --> 44:02.620]  And their response was you've given us nothing.
[44:02.620 --> 44:08.260]  So again, yes, vindication for us yet again, that these things go on and it's right to
[44:08.260 --> 44:09.260]  question it.
[44:09.260 --> 44:10.260]  And it's, it's a good, healthy thing.
[44:10.260 --> 44:11.480]  And they're trying to silence that.
[44:11.480 --> 44:14.760]  And yet Goliath is attacking David here.
[44:14.760 --> 44:16.040]  And I wouldn't have changed anything.
[44:16.040 --> 44:17.040]  Folks.
[44:17.040 --> 44:18.040]  I've done the right thing.
[44:18.040 --> 44:19.520]  I've asked the right questions and I'm proud of what we've done.
[44:19.520 --> 44:21.860]  And now the world knows about false flags now.
[44:21.860 --> 44:24.320]  Now Tucker Carlson's got specials about false flags.
[44:24.320 --> 44:25.780]  Now people know what they're looking for.
[44:25.780 --> 44:29.920]  They're not just letting a bunch of Democrat party crisis actors like you're about to see
[44:29.920 --> 44:34.760]  in Virginia, march up there and try to frame the Republican candidate as being a white
[44:34.760 --> 44:40.200]  nationalist because their candidate is behind the polls.
[44:40.240 --> 44:45.720]  And so the system has tried with everything they've got to suppress us, but it's not worked.
[44:45.720 --> 44:48.040]  And I'm told now that the report is done and ready to air.
[44:48.040 --> 44:51.840]  In fact, it's just been posted to Bandot video.
[44:51.840 --> 44:55.800]  So after you're done watching here, you can go get the actual report and share it.
[44:55.800 --> 44:57.240]  But here it is dealing with this.
[44:57.240 --> 45:03.280]  But the reason this is so incredibly important is not because it vindicates Alex Jones.
[45:03.280 --> 45:05.120]  It vindicates all of us.
[45:05.120 --> 45:09.160]  And it just proves again that if we're watching and we're vigilant, we can expose these guys
[45:09.160 --> 45:14.880]  staging a lot of these events and that sometimes things aren't staged, but that it's our right
[45:14.880 --> 45:18.000]  and duty to check it out and make sure it wasn't because there's been so many false
[45:18.000 --> 45:24.080]  flags and so many staged events to get us into wars and, you know, just to pass laws
[45:24.080 --> 45:25.440]  and to do so many countless things.
[45:25.440 --> 45:32.160]  But the big reason that I'm getting around to now is that they're planning to stage physical
[45:32.160 --> 45:37.640]  false flags, Oklahoma city bombing type events in my view, the deep state Democrats are to
[45:37.640 --> 45:41.000]  further demonize the American people and list us as terrorists.
[45:41.000 --> 45:45.080]  And that's why the plot against the people that this corrupt capture just departments
[45:45.080 --> 45:49.560]  rolling out and the plot against the people they used hijacking our peaceful protest on
[45:49.560 --> 45:55.440]  January 6th is so critical to expose now because we're in the season of false flags.
[45:55.440 --> 45:58.960]  We're in the seasons of when they're going to try to pull all these scams.
[45:58.960 --> 46:03.580]  And so that's why being vigilant and being aware of this is so important because they're
[46:03.580 --> 46:09.020]  screaming louder than a stuck pig when it comes to us just looking at false flags and
[46:09.020 --> 46:14.580]  the idea that they even happen because most of the time it's this dirty, nasty group that
[46:14.580 --> 46:15.580]  we're talking about.
[46:15.580 --> 46:20.780]  Like the current attorney general was heavily involved in OKC and the fake militias and
[46:20.780 --> 46:25.100]  the fake white supremacy groups and taking over motorcycle gangs and turning them into
[46:25.100 --> 46:26.100]  militias.
[46:26.100 --> 46:30.340]  I mean, that's his specialty and he's trying to brand conservative Christian Americans
[46:30.340 --> 46:35.380]  as terrorists and is able to have an outright civil war against us in this country to outlaw
[46:35.380 --> 46:39.140]  dissent and take our guns and our free speech.
[46:39.140 --> 46:42.600]  They're trying to use me as the poster boy to do it with all these fake lawsuits funded
[46:42.600 --> 46:45.400]  by Soros and Bloomberg and Democrats.
[46:45.400 --> 46:46.980]  But you've seen through it.
[46:46.980 --> 46:48.820]  You've prayed for us and you've supported us.
[46:48.820 --> 46:52.500]  You've spread the word and we've gotten stronger in the face of this attack.
[46:52.500 --> 46:53.600]  Thanks to you.
[46:53.600 --> 46:55.260]  So thank you all for your support.
[46:55.260 --> 46:58.380]  Here is the report on this situation.
[46:58.420 --> 47:03.660]  The globalist deep state that controls the Democratic Party just got caught in a massive
[47:03.660 --> 47:06.020]  false flag in Virginia.
[47:06.020 --> 47:11.260]  Their plan to frame the Republican gubernatorial candidate as a white supremacist just blew
[47:11.260 --> 47:12.940]  up in their evil face.
[47:28.380 --> 47:33.260]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[47:33.260 --> 47:39.620]  The Democratic Party and their operatives have been caught yet again staging a political
[47:39.620 --> 47:45.420]  false flag against the Republican Party in the tightly contested gubernatorial race in
[47:45.420 --> 47:51.140]  Virginia where the Republican, even in their skewed establishment polls, is several points
[47:51.140 --> 47:52.140]  ahead.
[47:52.140 --> 47:56.820]  So desperate to discredit him, the Democrats do what they always do, dress up in white
[47:56.820 --> 48:01.500]  supremacist outfits and then go out and try to scare the general public into believing
[48:01.500 --> 48:05.340]  that the Republican Party is actually a bunch of white nationalists that want to kill all
[48:05.340 --> 48:06.740]  the brown people.
[48:06.740 --> 48:11.180]  And yet again, they got caught and the corporate media went into overdrive trying to cover
[48:11.180 --> 48:16.220]  this up and then in came the Lincoln Project saying, oh no, we're Republicans that staged
[48:16.220 --> 48:20.580]  this false flag because we believe Trump and his supporters are so racist.
[48:20.580 --> 48:22.180]  It wasn't the Democrats.
[48:22.180 --> 48:27.120]  The Lincoln Project is the worst of the worst of a bunch of Democratic Party operatives.
[48:27.120 --> 48:31.500]  So it's another attempted Jedi mind trick they're engaged in to say, oh, it's not the
[48:31.500 --> 48:32.780]  Democrats that did this.
[48:32.780 --> 48:34.820]  Oh no, it was actually Republicans.
[48:34.820 --> 48:37.000]  How stupid do they think we are?
[48:37.000 --> 48:38.860]  Just look at these headlines.
[48:38.860 --> 48:43.260]  Democrat operatives caught dressing up as white supremacists in desperate last ditch
[48:43.260 --> 48:45.220]  Virginia election stunt.
[48:45.220 --> 48:46.860]  Here's a Forbes headline.
[48:46.860 --> 48:52.060]  Lincoln Project says it planted white supremacist impersonators at event for Virginia Republican
[48:52.060 --> 48:53.240]  candidate.
[48:53.240 --> 48:55.860]  Why is this so incredibly important?
[48:55.860 --> 49:01.020]  Because hundreds and hundreds of times Democrat operatives have been caught engaging in all
[49:01.020 --> 49:06.060]  sorts of hate crimes and other stunts against themselves and then the corporate establishment
[49:06.060 --> 49:12.580]  press comes out and covers their story as if it's true even when the truth comes out
[49:12.580 --> 49:14.020]  that it was staged.
[49:14.020 --> 49:17.500]  And now we see info wars vindicated yet again.
[49:17.500 --> 49:19.840]  Remember four years ago in Charlottesville?
[49:19.840 --> 49:22.720]  We sent reporters there to neutrally cover what was happening.
[49:22.720 --> 49:25.380]  They were trying to take down a Confederate statue.
[49:25.380 --> 49:27.520]  We were there neutrally just to cover it.
[49:27.520 --> 49:31.800]  And we witnessed individuals dressed up in the brown pants and the white shirts with
[49:31.800 --> 49:36.360]  the tiki torches, many of which have been directly linked to the Democratic Party.
[49:36.360 --> 49:42.000]  And when we identified that they'd formally worked for President Obama's campaign and
[49:42.000 --> 49:48.080]  reelection campaign, they spun it that, yes, we were formerly Obama campaign staffers,
[49:48.080 --> 49:55.240]  but now we really are angry at the Democrats and now we really are white nationalists.
[49:55.240 --> 49:59.920]  So as punishment for exposing the fact that George Soros was directly connected to funding
[49:59.920 --> 50:03.920]  those groups, I was sued in Virginia and the case is ongoing.
[50:03.920 --> 50:10.580]  It goes to a jury trial coming up next summer for the crime of asking that question and
[50:10.580 --> 50:14.280]  pointing out that many of these people were known Democrat Party operatives.
[50:14.280 --> 50:16.580]  But they didn't sue me directly for that.
[50:16.580 --> 50:21.880]  They falsely claimed that I said that another man who took photos of the woman that died
[50:21.880 --> 50:23.020]  had killed her.
[50:23.020 --> 50:25.500]  I said no such thing.
[50:25.500 --> 50:29.420]  But despite that, it goes forward to a jury.
[50:29.420 --> 50:34.660]  I could sit here and rattle off hundreds of examples of Democrats staged and leftists
[50:34.660 --> 50:40.320]  staged false flags, not just in America, but in Europe, in Australia, in the UK, in Canada.
[50:40.320 --> 50:42.880]  This is their bread and butter.
[50:42.880 --> 50:47.000]  And so, of course, when we've caught Jussie Smollett staging an attack on himself and
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  Bubba Wallace and they caught the leftist Jewish man attacking Jewish cemeteries and
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.840]  blaming it on Trump, I mean, the list goes on and on and on.
[50:55.840 --> 51:00.600]  And it's being encouraged by the corporate establishment that wants to divide and conquer
[51:00.600 --> 51:06.600]  America and have us all at each other's throats in a civil war, too, instead of taking control
[51:06.600 --> 51:11.080]  of our country from the multinational corporations that have hijacked the nation and they're
[51:11.080 --> 51:17.040]  using the hysteria around COVID-19 to bring in a form of digital martial law.
[51:17.040 --> 51:24.160]  So yet again, Infowars is vindicated in pointing out that a large portion of the people claiming
[51:24.160 --> 51:28.400]  they're white supremacists at every event I've ever covered turn out to be connected
[51:28.400 --> 51:32.680]  to the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Democratic Party, and other organizations.
[51:32.680 --> 51:35.360]  And it's come out over and over again.
[51:35.360 --> 51:37.220]  That's why they're so upset.
[51:37.220 --> 51:41.540]  Back in 1995, it came out in federal court documents from federal informants that the
[51:41.540 --> 51:47.160]  Southern Poverty Law Center ran Elohim City, the white supremacist command base, and knew
[51:47.160 --> 51:51.620]  the bombing was about to take place and did not alert federal authorities.
[51:51.620 --> 51:54.980]  And then when federal informants told the truth about this, the feds tried to put them
[51:54.980 --> 51:55.980]  in jail.
[51:55.980 --> 51:58.420]  And who was in charge of all that back at the time?
[51:58.420 --> 52:00.980]  But of course, the current attorney general.
[52:00.980 --> 52:05.020]  So they are trying to start a war against the American people.
[52:05.020 --> 52:08.020]  They're trying to launch a plot against the Republic.
[52:08.020 --> 52:13.260]  And in closing, that's why the corporate media and the Democratic Party are so angry at Tucker
[52:13.260 --> 52:18.840]  Carlson right now with his new three-part series that starts airing next Monday on November
[52:18.840 --> 52:21.160]  1st, The Plot Against the People.
[52:21.160 --> 52:25.700]  Because Tucker has the federal documents, the court documents, the witnesses, and all
[52:25.700 --> 52:31.780]  the video, much of it that we actually got, proving that federal provocateurs were there
[52:31.780 --> 52:37.700]  trying to lead the million-plus peaceful protesters into the Capitol so that they could
[52:37.700 --> 52:41.960]  demonize the American people as this new terror threat.
[52:41.960 --> 52:45.840]  This is why they're so hysterically angry at Infowars.
[52:45.840 --> 52:49.620]  This is why they're so out of their minds when it comes to Tucker Carlson.
[52:49.620 --> 52:54.020]  Because if the public starts investigating these white supremacist attacks and other
[52:54.020 --> 53:00.060]  provocateur events and continues to prove and discover that it's the deep state Democrats
[53:00.060 --> 53:03.600]  and some of the Republicans aiding them, it's game over for the New World Order.
[53:03.600 --> 53:06.940]  If they're able to trigger a civil war between black and white, they win.
[53:06.940 --> 53:09.960]  But if we wake up and come together, it's game over for them.
[53:09.960 --> 53:15.400]  The most powerful card that the globalist social engineers have, their ace of spades,
[53:15.400 --> 53:17.920]  is the false flag event.
[53:17.920 --> 53:20.300]  It's how they launched the Iraq war.
[53:20.300 --> 53:23.800]  It's how they were able to set up the Patriot Act in this country.
[53:23.800 --> 53:27.360]  And it's how they are now trying to brand anybody that questions elections, anybody
[53:27.360 --> 53:32.260]  that questions lockdowns, anybody that questions vaccine passports as terrorists so they can
[53:32.260 --> 53:37.760]  bring in a real corporate fascist model in this country under the United Nations and
[53:37.760 --> 53:38.760]  the Great Reset.
[53:38.760 --> 53:43.440]  It's not just America, but the entire world that's at a crossroads right now.
[53:43.440 --> 53:48.860]  And if we help the general public have an epiphany or an awakening to these dirty tricks
[53:48.860 --> 53:53.080]  that the deep state plays and pulls, they're going to fail.
[53:53.080 --> 53:55.440]  But if we don't expose it, they're going to win.
[53:55.480 --> 54:00.320]  Thank God citizen journalists on the ground and on Twitter and Facebook and other places
[54:00.320 --> 54:06.040]  saw what was happening, did the investigation, and quickly, within hours, exposed these jokers.
[54:06.040 --> 54:11.840]  And again, that's the power of the people, spreading the word but always being ever watchful.
[54:11.840 --> 54:13.200]  You are the Paul Revere.
[54:13.200 --> 54:18.060]  No matter what color you are, no matter what your sex is, no matter where you live, if
[54:18.060 --> 54:22.540]  you love justice and freedom and you love God, you're on the good guy's team.
[54:22.540 --> 54:26.500]  And if you're against the globalists and their tyranny, well, again, God is definitely
[54:26.500 --> 54:28.860]  watching and very, very proud of you.
[54:28.860 --> 54:32.580]  So again, I'm very, very excited and blessed that this information is coming out.
[54:32.580 --> 54:33.580]  We're all blessed.
[54:33.580 --> 54:38.380]  And so let's just keep our eyes peeled and watch our six because major stuff is already
[54:38.380 --> 54:40.420]  going down and it's only going to get a lot crazier.
[54:52.540 --> 55:09.140]  The domestic war on terror is here, is coming after half of the country.
[55:09.140 --> 55:12.780]  The helicopters have left Afghanistan and now they've landed here at home.
[55:12.780 --> 55:19.260]  And the left is hunting the right, staking them in Guantanamo Bay for American citizens,
[55:19.260 --> 55:20.980]  leaving them there to rot.
[55:20.980 --> 55:24.020]  We are dealing with an insurgency in the United States.
[55:24.020 --> 55:28.700]  Terrorism for white supremacy is the most lethal threat to the homeless.
[55:28.700 --> 55:30.700]  I've been told that I'm a white nationalist.
[55:30.700 --> 55:31.700]  Me!
[55:31.700 --> 55:32.700]  FBI!
[55:32.700 --> 55:33.700]  Put all of your hands up!
[55:33.700 --> 55:40.900]  They've begun to fight a new enemy in a new war on terror, not al-Qaeda, white supremacy.
[55:40.900 --> 55:50.380]  False flags have happened in this country, one of which may have been January 6th.
[55:50.380 --> 56:00.780]  Truth is marching on.

[56:52.300 --> 56:55.180]  The Black Friday sale comes early.
[56:55.180 --> 56:59.100]  It's going right now for the next two weeks and it supports the info war.
[56:59.100 --> 57:01.420]  Take action now and get prepared.
[57:01.420 --> 57:05.140]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen, what you just saw with Tucker Carlson and myself
[57:05.140 --> 57:06.500]  is so important.
[57:06.500 --> 57:11.500]  Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones have been vindicated by the Democrats being caught in the act of
[57:11.500 --> 57:15.140]  staging a racial false flag in Virginia.
[57:15.140 --> 57:17.900]  This is so huge and they're trying to censor the truth of this.
[57:18.060 --> 57:22.180]  So let's cram it down their dirty race-baiting throats.
[57:22.180 --> 57:27.100]  Get the report at Bandot Video and share it and share this live feed as well and share
[57:27.100 --> 57:28.780]  the archive of this feed.
[57:28.780 --> 57:30.420]  That's how you override them.
[57:30.420 --> 57:33.900]  There's the actual headline of the video, Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson vindicated after
[57:33.900 --> 57:37.780]  Democrats caught staging false flag in Virginia.
[57:37.780 --> 57:39.780]  Unbelievable information.
[57:39.780 --> 57:46.900]  Now joining us is the Vatican expert, best-selling author, Vatican insider, highest levels of
[57:46.900 --> 57:51.780]  the P2 Lodge insider who defected out of it more than 15 years ago.
[57:51.780 --> 57:55.140]  And I remember reading some of his books and hearing them 15 years ago and knowing most
[57:55.140 --> 57:58.040]  of it was accurate, but some of it was above my knowledge.
[57:58.040 --> 58:03.100]  And years later, he was totally vindicated in just everything he said about there'll
[58:03.100 --> 58:05.820]  be a Vatican takeover by the Jesuits.
[58:05.820 --> 58:09.860]  It's going to be this Pope who it was, and then they're going to still have another Pope
[58:09.860 --> 58:10.860]  at the same time.
[58:10.860 --> 58:13.060]  They're going to bring in a one world religion and all of it.
[58:13.060 --> 58:19.100]  So we saw the G20 at the Vatican in the last few days going on today, and he's got his
[58:19.100 --> 58:20.420]  big contacts in Italy.
[58:20.420 --> 58:22.220]  He lived in Italy till just the last few years.
[58:22.220 --> 58:24.980]  In fact, I've been there reporting with him in Italy and Rome.
[58:24.980 --> 58:28.820]  He had to leave because he's been politically targeted just like we're now being targeted
[58:28.820 --> 58:29.820]  here.
[58:29.820 --> 58:33.240]  So Leo Zagami, I'm going to try to really give you the floor here to go over the huge
[58:33.240 --> 58:37.660]  data dump you've got because this is like the Bilderberg group on steroids, but they're
[58:37.660 --> 58:39.420]  now externalizing the method.
[58:39.420 --> 58:41.860]  This is just a incredible time to be alive.
[58:41.860 --> 58:44.060]  Leo Zagami of leozagami.com.
[58:44.060 --> 58:46.980]  Thank you so much for joining us on Saturday evening.
[58:46.980 --> 58:48.340]  Thank you for having me on.
[58:48.340 --> 58:53.820]  And it was definitely an historical day in Rome at the Lenovo, this building, which is
[58:53.820 --> 59:01.540]  based in the area of Roma, which was built once upon a time by Benito Mussolini.
[59:01.540 --> 59:07.240]  And in this building, the G20 with all the powerful leaders of the world met to get there.
[59:07.240 --> 59:13.560]  Of course, we had some notorious absence from China, and I will be talking about why
[59:13.560 --> 59:17.040]  China wasn't there, also Russia.
[59:17.040 --> 59:22.720]  But at the same time, we had all these world leaders, of course, meeting for the last time
[59:22.720 --> 59:26.360]  with Angela Merkel, who is on her way out.
[59:26.360 --> 59:32.200]  And then we had, of course, the usual rubbish from all these people talking about climate
[59:32.200 --> 59:38.760]  change and trying to find solutions, but they really didn't find anything consistent.
[59:38.760 --> 59:45.480]  At the same time, we have a lot of protests going on in Italy.
[59:45.480 --> 59:50.680]  In Rome, they actually limited the protest only to the communists, so only people with
[59:50.680 --> 59:57.360]  communist flags who are protesting for nonsense were allowed, while Milan at the same time
[59:57.360 --> 01:00:03.640]  still now we have protests that have been going on for weeks and weeks regarding the
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:09.440]  imposition of, the very stringent imposition of the vaccine passport for all workers in
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.520]  Italy.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.840]  So there was, of course, this meeting, and the first thing was that we all noticed was
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:15.840]  Joe Biden.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:22.900]  Joe Biden, who got lost, he was wandering around at one point amongst the world leaders.
[01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:30.820]  He turned to, also from the line, then he turned to, you can actually see it a little
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:36.740]  bit there, but it's quite incredible how Joe Biden constantly gets lost.
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:43.380]  And he then talked with Erdogan, he treated Erdogan like a great friend.
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:48.520]  And of course, yesterday we had the meeting with Pope Francis, a meeting that for him
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.100]  was very important.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:54.940]  When he came out of the meeting, the first thing he said, oh, the Pope told me I'm a
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:59.620]  good Catholic, but we didn't discuss abortion.
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:03.460]  Of course, we all know that he did discuss abortion.
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:09.380]  Some media outlets eventually said that they hinted on the subject.
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:17.700]  But the fact is that neither him or Nancy Pelosi, who claimed to be very good Catholics,
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:19.700]  are good Catholics.
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:24.380]  And he can now receive communion, yes, he can continue to receive communion.
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:32.700]  The Pope blessed him, gave him a copy also of Fratelli tutti, the Masonic encyclical.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:40.580]  So the Pope basically has completely forgotten about this support for abortion that continues
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:49.360]  to go on from the left, which is absolutely crazy to think that the Catholic can support
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:55.660]  something and then even be blessed by the Pope and claim that he can still receive communion
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:02:01.040]  when he's endorsing such murderous activity.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:07.160]  Because of course, we know that abortion is a human sacrifice and a murderous activity.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.160]  That's what it is.
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.420]  Let's not fool ourselves.
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:17.360]  On top of that, we have, of course, a lot, like I said, a lot of protests in Italy.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:24.600]  But we have the absence today of the G20 of Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:28.720]  And this is very important that we discuss the reason why he's not there.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:35.080]  Because for 21 months, Xi Jinping has not got out of China.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.960]  He didn't go out of China in any way.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:42.000]  He has been staying firmly in China.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.600]  He actually almost doesn't think that the G20 nations are good enough for him.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600]  That's the real reason.
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:56.840]  He's actually making a show out of it, a standoff by not showing up in Rome.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:03.720]  He's claiming, some of the people close to him claim that he didn't want to go back in
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:08.880]  China and go through the quarantine, that all the Chinese people have to go through
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.000]  when they come back from abroad.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.960]  But that's, of course, an excuse.
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:21.560]  The real reason why Xi Jinping is not going is because at the moment he is in a position
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.800]  of dominance.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:29.960]  And there is also this whole thing going on with Joe Biden trying to talk with him.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:35.740]  Joe Biden claimed that he will have a virtual meeting before the end of the year with Xi
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:36.740]  Jinping.
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:39.960]  So there's also that going on.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:46.600]  But we have to understand that at the moment, of course, Taiwan is under the threat of China.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:55.160]  China is working very much on having a firm grip on this new world order and building
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.160]  their image.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.080]  But at the same time, Xi Jinping is not going out of China because he doesn't really need
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.400]  to go out of China.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:09.240]  They are all going also to the Glasgow gathering on climate change.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:16.560]  But also we know that China is not very strong in taking stringent measures to fight the
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.720]  climate change.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:22.600]  They are the number one polluters in any case.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:29.420]  But what's happening in China is also that Xi Jinping fears, fears for his own even political
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:34.340]  future and he doesn't want to leave China at this moment of time, in which there is
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:37.300]  a big energy crisis.
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:41.420]  There is no diesel being pumped into the cars.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.980]  You can't find any diesel.
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:48.260]  There is a lot of energy crisis going on in China.
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:52.820]  So China is having their own internal problems.
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:59.040]  But at the same time, they still have this strength towards the United States of America.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.560]  They want to be in a position of strength.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.320]  And then we have Russia.
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:04.840]  Vladimir Putin wasn't there.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.560]  I think maybe his foreign minister was there.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:17.320]  Vladimir Putin is another person that is now going to blackmail the whole of the EU using
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:27.180]  his gas, because suddenly today we start having hints that the energy crisis with gas in Europe
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:34.300]  is going to grow and that Russia is going to use the gas and the natural reserves of
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:41.340]  gas that they of course give to the rest of Europe, because Europe doesn't have many natural
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:42.340]  resources.
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:48.580]  So they really lean a lot towards Russia for warming themselves up in the wind.
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:53.220]  And Leo, I want to continue going down that line with you and your briefing on G20, because
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:56.900]  this is, again, the minions of the globalists that run the planet and these different power
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:57.940]  fissures are important.
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:03.180]  But since you mentioned abortion and depopulation, as you know, Mao Zedong was put into power
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:07.460]  by the CIA and OSS MI6 in 49.
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:08.460]  That's now declassified.
[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:13.540]  John Birch Society said that back in the late fifties, they've been proven right.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:17.020]  But now Xi Jinping has broken with the globalists.
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:18.020]  I'm not defending him.
[01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:19.020]  I'm not saying he's good now.
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.460]  He's just at least at one level broken with them.
[01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:25.540]  He's now saying three child policy, paying people to have three children.
[01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:30.380]  He's now promoting masculine men, outlawing sissy men, saying that America is poisoned
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.580]  and evil.
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:33.220]  Putin says that we're anti-Christ now.
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.260]  We should get Jesus.
[01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:38.300]  So Russia is saying we need Jesus and that America is now satanic.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:44.020]  You've got China that's godless, but saying we're rejecting the globalist depopulation
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:46.300]  pedophile agenda.
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.900]  So here's my question, because you have a lot of inside sources and you're also really
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:52.620]  smart and do a lot of research.
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:07:00.980]  Are those, is the splintering or the rift between the Chai Coms and the globalists real
[01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:01.980]  or what's really going on?
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:06.700]  Because we know the Putin Russian split with the globalists is real, right?
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:10.100]  No, I think that is all staged.
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:13.100]  Russia and China are in bed together.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:18.820]  Also military since the time they were both communist countries, because as you know,
[01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:23.100]  the Soviet Union was the past of Vladimir Putin.
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.100]  Leo, start over.
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:26.660]  You misunderstood because I'm talking fast trying to get this out.
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:31.180]  I know that Russia is fighting with the globalists and is its own power block.
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:36.620]  I'm saying China has acted like it's with the globalists, but it looks like it's totally
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:37.620]  breaking away.
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:39.340]  What's really going on?
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:45.380]  What's really going on is that China is actually showing that they don't need the rest of the
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:52.060]  world by not going to Rome and participating to this charade of the G20 or being there
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:57.460]  in presence in Glasgow for the climate summit and all that BS.
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:58.940]  I mean, I agree there.
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:07:59.940]  Exactly.
[01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:01.460]  They're not just saying we're going to have three children.
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:03.500]  They're saying we're not going to cut carbon for another 10 years.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.180]  They just pledged it.
[01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:06.180]  Of course.
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:11.980]  And then you have really nailed it down when it comes down to their will to build up again
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:13.460]  a brilliant society.
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:19.220]  They have the big problem that for decades they prohibited more than one child for each
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.000]  family unit.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:28.020]  And this until 2015, they created an enormous problem by doing that because now they don't
[01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:32.500]  actually have enough women for the male population.
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:40.420]  There is like a disproportionate, they screwed up with the natural levels of what, you know,
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:43.940]  the balance that you have between men and women in a race.
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:46.920]  And they have basically screwed it up.
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:55.560]  So now they are encouraging desperately Chinese to procreate, but it's maybe a bit late.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.380]  They need manpower.
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:02.860]  They need manpower for their military, for their industries.
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:07.380]  But they seem to have now a crisis in that sector.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:17.400]  Because a lot of the men following the Western trends, they have gone a little bit too feminine.
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:27.260]  So that's why then China has suddenly censored all these artists, like musical groups, actors
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:31.020]  that propose the Western way.
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:39.660]  And they are pushing instead for free child policy becoming law and maintaining, of course,
[01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:41.340]  their grip on society.
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:45.020]  They are doing all this by imposition.
[01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.020]  Sure.
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:48.660]  So I wanted to see if you agreed that that's going on.
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:50.300]  It clearly is.
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:55.460]  What does that signify for the Anglo-American Vatican Combine?
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:58.100]  How is Henry Kissinger's New World Order doing then?
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:05.780]  Well, Kissinger, as you know, was the gatekeeper of the opening of China to the rest of the
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:15.660]  world in the 70s, as well as George H. Bush with Barbara Bush.
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:21.000]  They were in Beijing for a long time before he became head of the CIA.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.100]  And then they opened up China to the rest of the world.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:29.700]  But you have to understand that China is linked to the Vatican, is linked to the Jesuits.
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:36.340]  And this link with the Jesuits is much more than a link only with Catholicism, but is
[01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:40.100]  a link with what we call here the deep state.
[01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:46.200]  People like Joe Biden, people like Nancy Pelosi, and all the peoples in San Francisco where,
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:52.500]  by the way, there is also the main lodge of Chinese Freemasonry because they have also
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:58.180]  their own brand of Chinese Freemasonry, which is very strong and which has one of the most
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:01.180]  important lodges in San Francisco.
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:08.540]  And most of their members are connected with the Democratic Party here in the U.S.
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:17.140]  So you have this situation going on whereby Kissinger, of course, is still a trendsetter.
[01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:23.200]  And when the people in Silicon Valley need to do something in China, often they go directly
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.700]  to him to have some connections.
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:26.700]  Exactly.
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:30.460]  So he's the wise man that Xi Jinping brags, control America, that Xi Jinping thinks he's
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:35.040]  still in control of that Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger also brag about.
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.880]  So we have Charlie Munger and Buffett saying we need to live under a Chinese dictatorship.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:44.420]  I'm saying with the China file worship of the CFR going on, is the New World Order model
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:49.380]  of Kissinger still dominant or is Russia getting out of the New World Order causing
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:50.380]  them a big problem?
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:54.040]  And how do you see the globalist trying to counter that now that it looks like China
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.140]  is starting to pull out as well?
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:12:05.560]  Well, Russia has a problem now with the bacteriological warfare that China started with this virus
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.980]  because it's a bacteriological warfare attack on the rest of the world.
[01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:14.100]  And it seems like Russia is having a problem with that.
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:19.420]  However, I want to go back to the fact that China and Russia have always had very strong
[01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:20.900]  relationship.
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:30.780]  And recently they have also showed that their military, their naval military are doing exercises
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.780]  together.
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:36.460]  They are basically in the South Pacific and whatnot.
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:40.980]  So it means that they are still very strongly connected.
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:48.420]  I think that China, Russia, and the Vatican are working together and that is going to
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:52.340]  become more clear in the coming years.
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:13:01.060]  But there is a link, unfortunately, between, within the power structure in Russia and the
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:02.060]  Vatican.
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:08.740]  However, fortunately, there is also Kirill, the patriarch of the Orthodox Church that
[01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:14.100]  is still not bowing down completely to this one world religion project.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:19.580]  That's why he has not yet gone to Astana to meet the Pope, which was supposed to happen
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:21.140]  this year.
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:29.300]  I still have some hope because Kirill is the one who has been very critic about the vaccine
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:33.060]  passports, even before they were created as vaccine passports.
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:41.100]  He's being really critical of all these modern IDs, digital IDs.
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:50.140]  There was a big criticism by the Orthodox Church in 2019 when they started to implement
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:55.180]  this pin number for pensioners and so on.
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:14:02.980]  So I mean, I think that in Russia we have fortunately still a very strong Orthodox Church.
[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.620]  That has a very strong Christian belief.
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:06.940]  I totally agree with you.
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:11.600]  So I mean, I've heard the right wing propaganda in the last 20 years that Putin's not really
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.600]  a Christian.
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:13.600]  It's all fake.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.680]  But Christ said, you judge a tree by its fruits and I'm not lionizing Putin, but my God, he's
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.380]  probably the greatest Christian leader in the world right now.
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:22.500]  It's not the Pope.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.060]  It's not Billy Graham Jr.
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:26.180]  I mean, I got to say.
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:30.700]  We have to be a little bit careful there, Alex, because I think that Vladimir Putin
[01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:40.820]  knows also that he can still rely on some of his old alliances when he was still involved
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:41.820]  with the Soviet Union.
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:44.820]  Like I said, I'm not lionizing Putin.
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:49.720]  I'm saying for what he says and paying Russians to have children and supporting Christianity
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.020]  and saying we need Jesus and saying America needs Christ, as he said last month, I go
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:55.900]  all people's actions.
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:15:00.900]  And all I'm saying is who else is doing more for Christianity than Vladimir Putin?
[01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:08.260]  I think that the key person behind Vladimir Putin for preserving such values is Kirill,
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:14.540]  the patriarch of Moscow, one of the leaders of the free leaders of the Orthodox Church
[01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:19.100]  in the world, because the Orthodox Church is not a centralized power like the Vatican.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:24.500]  It has three patriarchs, the one of Constantinople, the one in Romania and the one in Russia,
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:26.300]  which are the main ones.
[01:15:26.300 --> 01:15:28.100]  I totally agree with you.
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:32.180]  So I'm saying, was he always secretly a Christian as he says he was?
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:33.860]  Or has he really converted recently?
[01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:35.180]  Or is there a double game by Putin?
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:36.180]  Is he really a bad guy?
[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:37.340]  Because I respect your view.
[01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:38.340]  Tell me.
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:42.380]  Well, I've been in Russia many times.
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:49.500]  I was even guested by the patriarch of Russia in the Interreligious Dialogue Center in Bolshoi
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:52.680]  Street, which is close to the Bolshoi in Moscow.
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:16:00.640]  So I mean, I had direct experience of this change that Russia took after the fall of
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:01.640]  the Soviet Union.
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:04.800]  I never went to Russia when it was the Soviet Union.
[01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:10.640]  I started to go to Russia for a number of years in the middle of the 90s.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:12.900]  And I saw a great change.
[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:16.720]  Even Vladimir Putin, he was the mayor of St. Petersburg.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.280]  Russia was in great crisis.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.640]  People were shooting themselves in the street.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:23.680]  Yeltsin was a complete drunk fool.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:30.360]  And fortunately, at one point, he came into power and changed things for the better of
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:31.360]  the Russian people.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:35.980]  But let's remember that his priority is the Russian people.
[01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:43.600]  So he's still ambivalent in some of his alliances and choices, like his alliance with China,
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:48.240]  because that is only for the benefit of the Russian people.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:49.760]  And let's expand on that.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:51.960]  Trump, I think, genuinely worked for America.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:54.360]  Doesn't mean he didn't make mistakes, but he worked.
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:58.360]  And that's why they hate Putin and they hate Trump, is they're actually trying to be presidents.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:16:59.360]  Yeah.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:04.640]  It's like he puts Russia first, just like Donald J. Trump put America first.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.640]  You can't blame him.
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:11.440]  I mean, but if you think that Putin will ever do the interests of America, no.
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.760]  To be clear, I was never lionizing Putin.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:15.760]  I'm not naive.
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:20.000]  I'm just simply saying it appears the globalists genuinely hate Putin.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.560]  And I don't think that he is in league with them.
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.600]  And it looks like Xi Jinping now has broken off.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:32.640]  From my own personal experience in Russia, I know that since the 90s, America and George
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:36.840]  Soros tried to find an alternative to Putin.
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.720]  They really tried.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:43.400]  But every time they infiltrated the Russian system, started in the 90s, they even created
[01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:47.040]  a party that was called Apple at one point.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:50.880]  Well, they tried, they tried and they tried.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:58.960]  But the Russians will always discover their infiltration games, will actually brutally
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.600]  kill those people who tried to enact them.
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:07.320]  So they didn't have the same possibilities like in other countries.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:10.560]  And in the end, they had to accept the rise of Vladimir Putin.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.560]  Sure.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:15.600]  The other thing is, is that the same globalists that want to run Russia want to run us.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:20.480]  And I wish that, you know, Trump would have been more hardcore like Putin and moved early
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.480]  against him.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:22.480]  Instead, they moved against Trump.
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:28.960]  Yeah, but I think still that Vladimir Putin has done some compromises along the way because
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:34.640]  otherwise he will not be still alive or in power.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:42.400]  And one of the compromises that he has done probably is under deals that he does through
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:47.120]  the Knights of the Holy Sepulcher, which is a specific group of knights, very active in
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:54.160]  Russia and of course, in Italy, in Rome, around the world, because they are one of the official
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:55.600]  knights of the Vatican.
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:02.240]  He uses this channel of the Knights of the Holy Sepulcher to have a privileged contact
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:08.280]  with the Jesuits, because you have to understand that historically the Jesuit order and the
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:18.120]  Pope of today is a Jesuit, were actually managed to survive thanks to Russia, when in 1771
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:22.000]  they were kicked out of the Vatican, the Jesuit order.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.400]  They went under the protection of the Empress of Russia.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:33.320]  And basically Russia was not even a Catholic country, as we all know, is an Orthodox country.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:42.080]  But they made a deal with the Jesuits and said, OK, we can place a Russian Jesuit general
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.640]  for a period of time.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.280]  We will protect you.
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:49.160]  And so you will be able to not be exterminated.
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.160]  Sure.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:54.720]  There's a lot of old alliances and I don't mean to get you down a rabbit trail on Putin
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:58.600]  on Xi Jinping, but definitely.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:05.400]  After Napoleon came, finished his period in 1815, the Jesuits went back into the Vatican
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.400]  at that point.
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.760]  Then the Jesuit general, of course, was changed.
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.320]  It wasn't Russian anymore.
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:16.280]  But this link that was established back then still somehow survives.
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:17.280]  Sure.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.280]  I've asked a lot of questions.
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.540]  We're almost out of time.
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:20.540]  We got into G20.
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:21.660]  We got into everything.
[01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:27.020]  How is it going for this Jesuit globalist that calls himself a pope?
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.820]  Any big moves at the Vatican?
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:34.260]  Other key tidbits of news you'd like to impart to folks, Leo Zagami, leozagami.com?
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:38.380]  Well we touched on it just when we talked the last time.
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:45.420]  Yes, the Vatican is focusing very much on artificial intelligence and transhumanism.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:53.360]  It seems, of course, they are creating a whole group of Jesuits that is actually specialized
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:58.280]  on these subjects and that they are focusing on these subjects because they know they are
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.280]  of great importance.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:09.320]  They are even creating a metaverse Catholic missionary body, already ready to go into
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:19.540]  Mark Zuckerberg's newly created metaverse to convert people through virtual missionaries.
[01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:25.680]  And they will be virtual missionaries that have taken the fourth vow of the Jesuits.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:30.360]  Because when you take the fourth vow of the Jesuits, you can go into special missions
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:38.280]  for the pope and you have the possibility of bypassing any known law.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:45.000]  So the metaverse that is now just considered a joke is not really a joke, it's something
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.200]  that even the Vatican takes very seriously.
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:51.400]  Well that's right because they're going to force us, like they did with the lockdowns,
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:55.320]  into this virtual prison and that's why they're trying to advertise this as a wonderful place.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:22:00.520]  It's a way to lock you up in your house or in one of these coffin high-rises and then
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:04.320]  make you work and live there or you're not given your carbon credits.
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.040]  So this is very, very cold-blooded, they admit under the carbon tax it will be too expensive
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.080]  for anybody to even leave their house.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:14.400]  This is a true global prison they're building and this is just the window dressing of that
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.880]  prison.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:22.640]  And of course the Jesuits of the fourth vow are the ones that control the Illuminati and
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:23.640]  the Freemasons.
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:31.640]  It's not true that Ignacio Loyola fought secret societies like somebody tries to say or that
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:39.360]  Ignacio Loyola's spiritual exercises are a Christian way of fighting evil to the ultimate
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.360]  level.
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:45.000]  No, the spiritual exercise of Ignacio Loyola, they're actually opening the gates of hell
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:51.240]  for you and they're practiced by a lot of important and famous people because they are
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:57.520]  a way in which the society of Jesus can manipulate and control people further.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:02.600]  So don't give in to the Jesuit propaganda, let's say.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:06.440]  Leo, what would you call this period of time we're in right now?
[01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:09.880]  Because I mean, it's just world government, mark of the beast, what the coming out of
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.600]  the beast system, because this is just an incredible time and not just the corrupting
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:18.440]  Catholic Church, most of the big churches, Protestant, you name it, are not fighting
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:19.440]  this, they're not speaking up.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:25.220]  It seems to really only be the Orthodox Church around the world that I see really speaking
[01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:26.220]  up and fighting.
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:29.580]  There are a lot of conservative Catholic groups that are fighting as well, but as for
[01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:34.980]  leaders or patriarchs, we're really only seeing the Orthodox Church.
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:41.900]  In fact, I want to really point out on the fact that the moment in which we see Kirill
[01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:47.220]  bowing down to this pope and going to meet him for an interreligious dialogue with all
[01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:52.180]  the other religions, that will be the end because that means that the one world religion
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:57.420]  has got the last element that is resisting to it.
[01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:02.660]  You see, Kirill is very much fixated with the book of Revelation, with the mark of the
[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:09.980]  beast, and many Orthodox believers are fixated with the mark of the beast being its...
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:12.540]  Well, Leo, shouldn't all Christians be fixated on it?
[01:24:12.540 --> 01:24:13.540]  It's starting to happen.
[01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:14.540]  Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:22.340]  That's what I'm saying in the contest, of course, that we just discussed of Russia.
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:24.560]  They have actually made a war.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:30.940]  They made the prayer groups when they tried to force some of these controls.
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:35.980]  If they were forcing vaccine passports in Russia, the Orthodox Church already said they
[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:37.140]  are against it.
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:44.620]  So that's the big problem for the New World Order now, is to defeat this Russian Orthodox
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:48.860]  Church, which I cherish very much in my family.
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:54.500]  My great-grandmother married into a second wedding with a guy called Leo, who was an
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:55.620]  Orthodox Russian.
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:25:00.980]  So I'm very close to the Russian Orthodox Church, and I think they are very close to
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:02.740]  real Christianity.
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:06.100]  So I hope that they can resist.
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:10.940]  We all know, you know, temptation is always there, corruption is always there.
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:16.580]  We just have to hope that these people stay firm, as well as we Christians here in America
[01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:18.580]  stay firm, Alex.
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:25.500]  Because the threat now that we are facing here in America is a threat that we might
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:28.820]  be able to fight for another two or three years.
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:36.300]  Let's remember that in Europe now, they are starting massive programs for microchipping
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:41.820]  the population, first with a series of experiments that have already been conducted in Sweden,
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:42.820]  in Germany.
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:49.020]  But then they're going to start substituting the vaccine passport, the green pass, with
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:50.020]  the microchipping.
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:51.020]  And at that moment…
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:54.660]  That's right, and Klaus Schwab has said that, and for those who don't know, in Sweden
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:58.260]  for like three years, people are getting chips for the tens of thousands to be able to ride
[01:25:58.260 --> 01:25:59.260]  on the train or bus.
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:01.300]  Soon they're saying, you'll have to have one.
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:03.420]  This is just insane.
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:04.420]  It's all happening.
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:08.660]  But I cut you off, you were saying, and then soon, you were saying, and soon?
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:15.540]  Well, I assume we will be seeing exactly what the book of Revelation, what the visions of
[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:17.300]  John of Patmos saw.
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:19.380]  So it's the apocalypse unfolding.
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:24.700]  I mean, we don't really have to have a great imagination to see what's happening when
[01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:27.300]  it's happening in front of our eyes.
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:29.820]  What we have to do is to resist.
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:36.460]  Because you see, the majority of the people are starting to realize that maybe the Hamish
[01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:43.780]  were right, that we are the Hamish of tomorrow, because we are becoming the ones who are constantly
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:47.140]  critical of this society, but we are shrinking.
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:53.220]  Because each day there is a category of people that for convenience is giving up to Satan
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:54.220]  and to the market.
[01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:55.220]  Absolutely.
[01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:56.220]  The Hamish look better and better every day.
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.420]  None of them basically got COVID or died.
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:26:59.500]  They don't get autism.
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:01.260]  They don't take vaccines.
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:05.180]  The Hamish are looking really good about now.
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:08.940]  And I got to tell you, I was in Florida and saw an Amish community, because they go to
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:10.460]  the beach and stuff too.
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:14.700]  And I saw the men and the women and the children, and they looked super healthy compared to
[01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:15.860]  everybody else.
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:16.860]  They were radiant.
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:17.860]  Yeah.
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:18.860]  Yeah.
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:25.860]  Well, it was the best policy really to do the herd immunity concept following the Hamish
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:31.700]  advice, which is basically to get everybody to just front the virus openly.
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:34.820]  And then you build a resistance.
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:38.300]  The natural immunity is the best immunity.
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:43.860]  So of course there is no vaccine or no medicine that can compare to that.
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:44.860]  That's right.
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:48.860]  Isolating people is the worst thing you can do, unless somebody's got like bubonic blood
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:49.860]  or something.
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:51.860]  It's the preparatory stage Alex.
[01:27:51.860 --> 01:28:00.860]  We said it, locking them down in their houses, serving them outside more and more with drones
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:07.860]  and other robots that will be patrolling the street, Robocops, Robodogs.
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:16.860]  We are literally facing the reality that was showcased in movies like Terminator or The
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:17.860]  Matrix.
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:18.860]  You're right.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:19.860]  Out of the open invasion.
[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:23.860]  Now they're talking about smart dust that the UN is going to put in all the food that
[01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:24.860]  quote, takes over our bodies.
[01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:25.860]  It's incredible.
[01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:27.860]  Leo Zagami, thank you so much for the time.
[01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:29.860]  People can find all your books on your website.
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:31.860]  Tell us about your latest book.
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:32.860]  Yes.
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:33.860]  Thank you so much.
[01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:36.860]  You can of course find the links to my latest books.
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:41.860]  And I'm also working on a new one that I hope to present to your audience before the end
[01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:42.860]  of the year.
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:47.860]  So thank you very much for having me on and God bless you all and God protect us from
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:48.860]  this great evil.
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:49.860]  Please resist.
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:50.860]  Don't give in.
[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:51.860]  Don't give in.
[01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:52.860]  Thank you.
[01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:53.860]  Leo Zagami.
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:54.860]  Wow.
[01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:55.860]  Really smart guy.
[01:28:55.860 --> 01:28:56.860]  Knows what he's talking about.
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:57.860]  Okay.
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:01.360]  I'm going to end this special Saturday transmission with a very important report that John Bowne
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:07.640]  put out dealing with Fauci and his biological warfare attack Titanic.
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:08.640]  His whole agenda is sinking.
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:11.140]  I'm going to throw this out right now.
[01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:15.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're under massive attack because we're warning about the plot
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:19.880]  against humanity, the plot against the people that Tucker Carlson talks about.
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:20.880]  And we are the tip of the spear.
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:22.080]  You were the tip of the spear.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.480]  The crew up here working seven days a week is the tip of the spear.
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:25.480]  So I want to thank them.
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:31.520]  And I want to encourage all the listeners before we end this broadcast to not procrastinate
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:35.440]  and to support the transmission because with supply chain breakdowns and all the craziness,

[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:39.120]  over your body I mean they're announcing this that's the first thing we cover I think
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.800]  that's the most important it ties in everything Leo Zagami was saying we started off the most
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:46.200]  important thing the rollout of the mark of the beast the preparatory phase is ending
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:50.680]  now the real rollouts here it's happening and we ended with that today but the whole
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:56.100]  false flag event being caught red-handed they want you where you don't question when democrats
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:32:00.400]  dress up like white supremacists and show up at your event to make you look bad or to
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:05.160]  cause a race riot but we are going to continue to expose these monsters no matter how many
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:08.920]  damn lawsuits they file on us or what they do and at the end of the day because your
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:12.440]  prayers and financial support were stronger than we've ever been and they're not going
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:17.800]  to be taking anybody off the air not as long as you are supporting us that's what we're

[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:19.960]  we worked through this pandemic over a year we worked we worked we worked tirelessly long
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:25.640]  hours without fear boldly took care of us the citizens of the city of this new york
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:32.040]  we answered countless calls countless efs emergencies and other emergencies to keep
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:36.000]  the city safe let's just stop it's like a mexican standoff let's just all this is put

[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:48.320]  this right now because this is a bioweapon war if the point that you are making is that
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:57.440]  the grant that was funded as a sub-award from eco-health to wuhan created sars-cov-2 that's
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:02.120]  where you are getting let me finish we don't know well wait a minute it did come in the lab
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:06.560]  but all the evidence is pointing that it came from the lab you there will be responsibility
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:12.080]  for those who funded the lab including yourself i totally this committee will allow the witness
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:19.560]  to i totally resent the lie that you are now propagating the nih has not ever and does not
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:28.760]  now fund gain of function research in the wuhan institute anthony fauci has spent listen to this
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:42.240]  number 191 billion dollars not 3.7 million not 30 million 191 billion dollars of audited funds
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:48.120]  for the bioweapon ization of viruses against humanity despite the fact that we have every
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:54.840]  grant recipient every person their address their phone number their laboratory we literally have
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:35:00.480]  the entirety of where that money went and not a single investigation agency in this country is
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:08.520]  willing to look this is a bioweapons program designed to kill us that's what it is and it's
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:14.080]  not just designed to kill us it's designed to kill massive numbers of the population Wednesday's
[01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:19.600]  letter to Congress admits if not obscurely that gain-of-function research was in fact funded by
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:26.320]  the nih through eco health the question remains is this latest revelation testament to an nih that
[01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:32.480]  knowingly lied about its involvement in dangerous covert research in wuhan or was its involvement a
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:38.880]  snapshot into a deadly form of reckless disregard the issue of whether nih funded risky research
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:44.280]  resurfaced last week after the health agency said in a letter to Congress that a contractor
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:50.360]  performing experiments at wuhan did not share all its data hall cited the letter as further
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:55.440]  evidence that Fauci and other public health officials had lied when they denied the nih
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:01.280]  funded such studies he called for Fauci to be fired over the admission even if you don't agree
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:05.400]  with the latest headlines that Fauci lied to Congress about whether or not the nih funded
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:10.600]  gain-of-function research or the heart-wrenching headlines regarding experiments on puppies much
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:15.000]  of the public has lost confidence in Fauci and his ability to lead the nation out of this
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.360]  pandemic he's admitted to lying at times for noble reasons he's been accused of blatantly lying
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:25.800]  during others he's flip-flopped on what he considers to be indisputable science and backpedaled on what
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:31.360]  it will take to allow us to get back to normal yet Fauci who turns 81 at the end of the year is
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:37.480]  still the guy at the helm why directed by major corporations to bring in world government and all
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:42.320]  their greedy crazy crap in their world ID and all this stuff and and it's prophesied it's gonna
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:48.720]  happen sometime in the future I'd like it not to happen maybe in my lifetime maybe now Harari says
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:54.400]  the countries and companies that control the most data will in the future be the ones that control
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:59.560]  the world today in the world data is worth much more than money ten years ago you had these big
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:05.680]  corporations paying billions and billions for whatsapp for Instagram and people wondered are
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:12.400]  they crazy why do they pay billions to get this application that doesn't produce any money and
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:20.360]  the reason why because it produced data the world is increasingly kind of cut up into spheres of
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:27.320]  data collection of data harvesting in the Cold War you had the Iron Curtain now we have the Silicon
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:34.040]  Curtain and where does the data go California or does it go to Shenzhen and to Shanghai and to
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:38.840]  Beijing Harari is concerned the pandemic has opened the door for more intrusive kinds of data
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:45.280]  collection including biometric data what is biometric data it's data about what's happening
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:50.600]  inside my body what we have seen so far it's corporations and governments collecting data
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:59.560]  about where we go who we meet what movies we watch the next phase is the surveillance going under our
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:05.040]  skin are you really into child sacrifice because that's what this is and is that what you want to
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:18.280]  be part of people have now reached that point watch the American Journal weekday mornings 8 to 11
