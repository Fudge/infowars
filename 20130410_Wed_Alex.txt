[01:05.680 --> 01:09.760]  confiscate them because that's the blueprint we've got them handing out the
[01:09.760 --> 01:14.400]  fake signs that the news then claims are grassroots they point at the signs and
[01:14.400 --> 01:19.440]  say look it's grassroots once you know the formula the man behind the curtain
[01:19.440 --> 01:24.600]  it's so creepy that we've got a city councilman that looks like the Hispanic

[03:20.480 --> 03:25.080]  present but I want to say a couple of words and I'll be brief first of all to
[03:25.080 --> 03:29.320]  the gentleman who's dying for attention someone needs to inform him that there
[03:29.320 --> 03:36.720]  is no gunman currently because of the work we're doing here today we will make your

[03:48.760 --> 03:52.560]  on that in the next segment because I show clips of where they admit the
[03:52.560 --> 03:56.800]  plan is a total gunman of course it is Chicago New York every other country the
[03:56.800 --> 04:00.760]  globalist control they armed to the teeth paramilitary police surveillance
[04:00.760 --> 04:09.080]  helicopters drones just total pre-crime domestic tattletale brigades I mean
[04:09.080 --> 04:16.640]  direct scripting of 1984 but as long as you call it liberal it's a okay now the
[04:16.640 --> 04:21.120]  legislature of New York is calling for and it's already happening but they
[04:21.120 --> 04:25.080]  they're calling for anyone who's ever been on any type of antidepressant drug
[04:25.080 --> 04:28.720]  period which they basically forced the military on will have your guns taken
[04:28.720 --> 04:33.080]  that's linked up in the middle column under a Ken Weiner rise again police
[04:33.080 --> 04:37.320]  confiscating firearms from people taking anti-anxiety medication and then Time
[04:37.320 --> 04:41.680]  Magazine warning others about government oppression is anti-American crap I
[04:41.680 --> 04:45.480]  thought it was the essence of America and so I thought I dovetail that with all
[04:45.480 --> 04:49.760]  the real government oppression and then we've got Jakari Jackson in studio along

[08:01.640 --> 08:17.640]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[08:17.640 --> 08:36.440]  don't you know it's out around history there have been many
[08:36.440 --> 08:42.640]  cases where authoritarians take the restraint of the armed population as
[08:42.640 --> 08:51.760]  weakness instead of restraint especially by the real warrior class in this
[08:51.760 --> 08:55.840]  country not the fake warrior class that likes to oppress men women and
[08:55.840 --> 08:59.920]  children like North Korean soldiers and the globalist are trying to convert
[08:59.920 --> 09:05.040]  America over to a system where the supposed warrior class does not protect
[09:05.040 --> 09:09.120]  the peace and defend the republic but instead usher's in the enslavement of
[09:09.120 --> 09:13.680]  the people and by any historical yardstick they had a major university
[09:13.680 --> 09:18.240]  study last year showing the united states the six worst police state in the
[09:18.240 --> 09:22.640]  world though the united states has a paradox because there's still so many
[09:22.640 --> 09:26.880]  time-honored basic liberties and freedoms that were hard won by the
[09:26.880 --> 09:30.720]  founders of this country and our veterans and others since then there's
[09:30.720 --> 09:33.520]  always good and evil there's always the control freaks there's always the
[09:33.520 --> 09:37.920]  usurpers trying to take over just because they're always trying to take
[09:37.920 --> 09:42.240]  over because they live off our tax money they live off the monopolies that
[09:42.240 --> 09:45.840]  they can create for big business just because they're always pushing you
[09:45.840 --> 09:52.880]  don't give up that's the eternal fight that every generation goes through and
[09:52.880 --> 09:56.400]  this is going to be an unprecedented broadcast today it is a very important
[09:56.400 --> 09:59.280]  broadcast we're going to be focusing on the second amendment
[09:59.280 --> 10:05.040]  because the second wave since obama's reelection of the attempt to butcher
[10:05.040 --> 10:11.600]  the second amendment is on right now we are at a razor thin margin in the senate
[10:11.600 --> 10:14.960]  with them being able to pass a national gun registration
[10:14.960 --> 10:19.280]  shutting down private sales felonies if you give your son or daughter a gun or
[10:19.280 --> 10:25.200]  they give you a gun all sorts of harassment the atf being able to
[10:25.200 --> 10:28.160]  to to shut down gun shops and factories
[10:28.160 --> 10:32.720]  via color of law the enemy is coming in
[10:32.720 --> 10:36.000]  with their greatest assault ever and will probably
[10:36.000 --> 10:42.880]  provocateur or stage another mass shooting very very soon in one of the
[10:42.880 --> 10:45.680]  victim disarmament zones that they've created where no one can protect
[10:45.680 --> 10:49.200]  themselves and the children are trained to get in a fetal position to be
[10:49.200 --> 10:52.560]  executed to help the shooter get the maximum death rate
[10:52.560 --> 10:57.200]  while the SWAT team stands down outside so the mercenary group can exfiltrate
[10:57.200 --> 11:00.080]  out the back even if you catch them exfiltrating it's
[11:00.080 --> 11:03.760]  it's in the video of it it's or even if the department of defense is
[11:03.760 --> 11:09.840]  running the shooter uh in in in in colorado
[11:09.840 --> 11:14.160]  you know the general public just cannot get how criminal this operation is
[11:14.160 --> 11:18.800]  we're facing this is a foreign banking takeover of america
[11:18.800 --> 11:22.880]  and if you capture the united states completely
[11:22.880 --> 11:26.320]  you've got all the drones all the weapons all the troops
[11:26.320 --> 11:30.480]  all the aircraft carriers all the cruise missiles the new cruise missiles
[11:30.480 --> 11:34.720]  the icbms are basically worthless folks the new cruise missiles that are the
[11:34.720 --> 11:38.400]  ultimate weapon in the arsenal on the record
[11:38.400 --> 11:43.360]  i mean we are the big enchilada it's all and they've got lots of collaborators
[11:43.360 --> 11:47.280]  lots of arrogant egomaniac yes men that are ready
[11:47.280 --> 11:51.280]  to sell out and they really think they can win a protracted war
[11:51.280 --> 11:54.640]  they really think you're going to roll over and turn your guns in
[11:54.640 --> 11:58.960]  or they can just do like new york and 15 other states have done
[11:58.960 --> 12:02.320]  start banning semi-autos banning high-capacity mags
[12:02.320 --> 12:06.320]  and then swat teaming and persecuting gun owners veterans
[12:06.320 --> 12:10.400]  setting up checkpoints on highways and doing knocking talks
[12:10.400 --> 12:14.240]  to to catch gun owners uh with guns they haven't turned in
[12:14.240 --> 12:18.560]  to then fill the horrible private prisons with the patriots of america
[12:18.560 --> 12:21.680]  it's not going to work let me tell you what's going to happen
[12:21.680 --> 12:24.880]  okay you and it's already happening and and they know this
[12:24.880 --> 12:27.920]  you're going to have cops dead all over the place
[12:27.920 --> 12:31.520]  it's already happening you're going to have cops with people that are fed up
[12:31.520 --> 12:34.880]  when you try to take their guns uh people aren't just going to wait any
[12:34.880 --> 12:37.200]  more in their house for you to come get the guns
[12:37.200 --> 12:41.040]  okay these are combat trained people everybody knows it
[12:41.040 --> 12:44.000]  okay and it's going to start a civil war and that's the plan
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.200]  that's the false flag we we but and look we've got now
[12:47.200 --> 12:50.400]  over a thousand sheriffs coming out and saying it's tyranny it's evil
[12:50.400 --> 12:54.320]  so they introduce a bill that the secret service will have law enforcement power
[12:54.320 --> 12:57.600]  in the state of colorado they've introduced it in other states
[12:57.600 --> 13:01.600]  to arrest sheriffs that civil war right there
[13:01.600 --> 13:05.360]  but it's not even a civil war the federal government has been taken over by
[13:05.360 --> 13:08.960]  foreign banks the sheriffs and some of the states realize that
[13:08.960 --> 13:12.880]  that's why you've got judges in texas state judges county judges
[13:12.880 --> 13:16.240]  coming out and saying they're setting up martial law they're preparing a takeover
[13:16.240 --> 13:19.520]  to civil war before obama got reelected
[13:19.520 --> 13:22.160]  if you're not getting chills you don't have a heartbeat out there ladies and
[13:22.160 --> 13:26.320]  gentlemen so all of this is going on all of this
[13:26.320 --> 13:29.280]  is happening and look at these headlines i want to
[13:29.280 --> 13:33.120]  show tv viewers this radio listeners go to info wars dot com
[13:33.120 --> 13:38.800]  time columnist warning others about government oppression is anti-american
[13:38.800 --> 13:43.120]  crap that's a quote there is no oppression there is no tyranny
[13:43.120 --> 13:46.240]  of course they now admit tsa on the streets warrantless wiretapping the
[13:46.240 --> 13:50.560]  police state the persecution of patriots
[13:50.560 --> 13:53.760]  but see they're scared of talking about the two billion bullets the armored
[13:53.760 --> 13:56.240]  vehicles or the fact that well you want our guns while you're
[13:56.240 --> 13:58.800]  arming to the teeth that's the elephant in the room
[13:58.800 --> 14:04.960]  that's why they're selling 30 plus guns on the instant check
[14:04.960 --> 14:09.360]  registration system a minute that's why they're having 70 million guns bought
[14:09.360 --> 14:12.160]  every two years now on record it's more like a hundred million
[14:12.160 --> 14:15.680]  because it's over folks don't you get it this isn't russia
[14:15.680 --> 14:18.800]  with a bunch of poor peasants that never had freedom under the czars
[14:18.800 --> 14:22.560]  and then a bunch of commies come in and take over and just have a slaughterhouse
[14:22.560 --> 14:25.520]  not that the russians aren't tough people but they were always under bondage
[14:25.520 --> 14:28.320]  so they never had a leg up this is not nazi germany
[14:28.320 --> 14:31.600]  with sure the germans were tough and smart but they were subservient
[14:31.600 --> 14:36.320]  it's a german thing to do what you're told to get in line
[14:36.320 --> 14:39.840]  this is not nazi germany this is not the chinese peasants who'd been under
[14:39.840 --> 14:43.280]  5 000 years of tyranny strong smart people but always
[14:43.280 --> 14:47.840]  enslaved this is america this is the republic and you haven't
[14:47.840 --> 14:51.760]  chopped all of our way those off you haven't destroyed this country completely
[14:51.760 --> 14:56.480]  yet there's over a hundred million people who know who you are
[14:56.480 --> 14:59.840]  this isn't just a republic ladies and gentlemen
[14:59.840 --> 15:05.120]  this is sparta if you want to use the 300 analogy but it's not 300
[15:05.120 --> 15:09.120]  it's hundreds of thousands in every state
[15:09.120 --> 15:14.640]  who are sitting back watching what's happening and everything's being confirmed
[15:14.640 --> 15:17.760]  for them and they are locked and they are loaded
[15:17.760 --> 15:20.800]  and i want to tell the federal reserve in the new world order something
[15:20.800 --> 15:24.880]  you are not going to get away with this you may be able to kill ron paul
[15:24.880 --> 15:27.840]  or kill alex jones and wipe out the leadership
[15:27.840 --> 15:30.960]  and the reason you haven't done that yet is because you know what that'll do
[15:30.960 --> 15:37.440]  that'll energize us 110 percent okay we're powering up
[15:37.440 --> 15:42.080]  against your revolution against our republic we're energizing we're rising
[15:42.080 --> 15:45.360]  that's why you desperately went for the guns it's why you staged aurora it's
[15:45.360 --> 15:49.280]  why you stage sandy hook it's your gulf of tonkin
[15:49.280 --> 15:52.720]  you think you're going to get away with this just because you've got

[24:34.000 --> 24:34.800]  report
[24:34.800 --> 24:41.520]  austin city council member mike martinez
[24:41.520 --> 24:45.360]  thank you so much i've got a proclamation on
[24:45.360 --> 24:48.400]  the afro-marin city council that we want to present but i want to say a couple of
[24:48.400 --> 24:52.160]  words um and i'll be brief first of all to the gentleman
[24:52.160 --> 24:56.320]  who's dying for attention uh someone needs to inform them that there is no
[24:56.320 --> 25:02.480]  gunband currently but because of the work that we're doing here today
[25:02.480 --> 25:07.440]  we will make your side legitimate shortly so you hang on to that
[25:07.440 --> 25:12.240]  alex jones here for info wars nightly news with a gun owner emergency
[25:12.240 --> 25:18.320]  alert we sent our reporters out to the texas capital here in austin to
[25:18.320 --> 25:24.960]  film the mayor bloomberg sponsored event with the austin police chief calling
[25:24.960 --> 25:28.480]  for the restriction of the second amendment shutting down the gun shows
[25:28.480 --> 25:32.080]  not having private sales restricting quote high capacity
[25:32.080 --> 25:36.880]  magazines and city councilman mike martinez who's set to be
[25:36.880 --> 25:42.080]  the next mayor came out and pointed at a man in the audience
[25:42.080 --> 25:47.760]  who had a sign saying stop the gunband and he said listen buddy you're trying to
[25:47.760 --> 25:50.960]  make attention yelling over there we're gonna play the clip here in a moment
[25:50.960 --> 25:54.800]  he says that's not happening yet but once we do this
[25:54.800 --> 25:58.240]  that is going to happen to thunderous applause
[25:58.240 --> 26:01.360]  everywhere these collectivists have been in control
[26:01.360 --> 26:05.520]  not just worldwide but chicago new york and other areas they've banned the guns
[26:05.520 --> 26:11.520]  but first they register them first they register them and he says to them hey
[26:11.520 --> 26:15.360]  we're not banning your guns right now we're gonna do what we're doing now
[26:15.360 --> 26:18.880]  which is registration and then we're gonna take them
[26:18.880 --> 26:22.240]  and that's what they've done everywhere and that's what's so frustrating about
[26:22.240 --> 26:25.360]  this we have the clip of the attorney general
[26:25.360 --> 26:28.560]  back when he was deputy attorney general saying we're going to brainwash the
[26:28.560 --> 26:32.800]  public against guns in the media and what we need to do is change the way in
[26:32.800 --> 26:35.760]  which people think about guns especially young people one thing
[26:35.760 --> 26:39.040]  that i think is clear with young people and with adults as well
[26:39.040 --> 26:42.560]  is that we just have to be repetitive about this it's not enough to simply have
[26:42.560 --> 26:47.040]  a catchy ad on a monday and then only do it every monday we need to do this
[26:47.040 --> 26:50.960]  every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[26:50.960 --> 26:54.960]  about guns in a vastly different way and then of course we have the clip of
[26:54.960 --> 26:58.400]  diane feinstein on 60 minutes saying if she had the votes
[26:58.400 --> 27:01.600]  mr and mrs america turn in your simmy autos
[27:01.600 --> 27:07.520]  if i could have gotten 51 votes in the senate of the united states for an
[27:07.520 --> 27:11.920]  outright ban picking up every one of them
[27:11.920 --> 27:15.760]  mr and mrs america turn them all in i would have done it
[27:15.760 --> 27:18.880]  and after they've gotten those they're going to take all the rest
[27:18.880 --> 27:22.640]  the truth is they're buying millions of bullets they're buying armored vehicles
[27:22.640 --> 27:27.200]  this is an authoritarian takeover and when obama was a state senator he was for
[27:27.200 --> 27:30.800]  the total abolition of firearms ownership the un treaty they're trying to
[27:30.800 --> 27:35.840]  ratify right now in the senate does the same thing and they admit it in our
[27:35.840 --> 27:41.200]  face even deep in the heart of texas mr martinis gets up and says
[27:41.200 --> 27:46.080]  basically after we register your guns we are going to confiscate them
[27:46.080 --> 27:49.120]  i've got a proclamation on the afro-marin city council that we want to
[27:49.120 --> 27:53.040]  present but i want to say a couple of words um and i'll be brief
[27:53.040 --> 27:56.240]  first of all to the gentleman who's dying for attention uh
[27:56.240 --> 27:59.840]  someone needs to inform them that there is no gun ban currently
[27:59.840 --> 28:04.480]  but because of the work that we're doing here today
[28:04.480 --> 28:10.400]  we will make your side legitimate shortly so you hang on to them
[28:10.400 --> 28:15.040]  mexico has a total gun ban and has had 60 000 gun deaths the last six years
[28:15.040 --> 28:18.320]  because only the government and criminals have guns
[28:18.320 --> 28:22.800]  this second amendment is a right of all americans and it's despicable
[28:22.800 --> 28:25.600]  that these authoritarians creep around on the news
[28:25.600 --> 28:28.960]  and say we just want reasonable restriction
[28:28.960 --> 28:34.000]  register when they're on record all of them saying they plan to confiscate all
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.280]  our guns as part of a total government takeover of society
[28:37.280 --> 28:39.760]  please get this video out to everyone you know because they want to act like
[28:39.760 --> 28:42.800]  they're being reasonable and oh it's no big deal
[28:42.800 --> 28:45.920]  when on record they really want to confiscate all our firearms
[28:45.920 --> 28:49.040]  alex shone's reporting for m4 wars nightly news
[28:49.040 --> 28:56.720]  yes these men have been hypnotized followers for this a new one
[28:56.720 --> 29:02.400]  it is not new and it is not honor
[29:02.400 --> 29:06.800]  ladies and gentlemen people like mike martinez and mary blumberg and others
[29:06.800 --> 29:10.400]  are conscious of the fact that it's about state control he lives behind
[29:10.400 --> 29:14.880]  armed guards he is behind incredible security at the
[29:14.880 --> 29:20.000]  huge edifice to government worship that is the austin city council
[29:20.000 --> 29:24.240]  and they crave power they crave uniforms and guns and they want your guns
[29:24.240 --> 29:29.600]  you're right as a free human i burn with a desire for liberty
[29:29.600 --> 29:34.320]  for north korea and mexico i love those people
[29:34.320 --> 29:39.680]  and i burn with defiance against kim jong-un and mike martinez
[29:39.680 --> 29:44.720]  i burn with defiance and at least you're honest though that you do plan to

[33:41.280 --> 33:44.800]  our enemy is weak that's why they creep around and lie
[33:44.800 --> 33:48.960]  and deceive and then only in private moments that you get caught on c-span
[33:48.960 --> 33:53.280]  cerebrating more than 15 years ago saying we've got to get the registration
[33:53.280 --> 33:57.920]  before the confiscation before we can create a socialist
[33:57.920 --> 34:04.320]  america that's a quote and that's the battle plan i mean bloomberg
[34:04.320 --> 34:11.200]  has taken all of the guns in new york he is financing people to run for
[34:11.200 --> 34:16.320]  office to take guns in texas he is financing tv ads he is
[34:16.320 --> 34:21.600]  taking mike martinez and and and the and the awesome police chief and you know
[34:21.600 --> 34:24.560]  flying him up to dc flying him up to new york
[34:24.560 --> 34:28.800]  a lot of its taxpayer money paid for as well while bloomberg has at least 15
[34:28.800 --> 34:32.160]  guards at any one time and while all these guys have guns
[34:32.160 --> 34:36.160]  there's our day saveta with a gun on his side at the capital
[34:36.160 --> 34:41.120]  that clearly holds 15 rounds a clock maybe even more
[34:41.120 --> 34:43.920]  and he's saying you shouldn't be able to have that
[34:43.920 --> 34:47.280]  when you've done nothing wrong he goes you're either with us the police or with
[34:47.280 --> 34:50.480]  the criminals see that's saying you do what we say or your criminals that's
[34:50.480 --> 34:54.160]  the psychology he's giving exact white house talking points and again your
[34:54.160 --> 34:58.400]  mayor probably doing it in your town as well
[34:58.400 --> 35:01.920]  because that's what this is all about total domination and and to have mike
[35:01.920 --> 35:04.880]  martinez up there you know make it a joke hey
[35:04.880 --> 35:08.080]  we're not going to take your guns right now
[35:08.080 --> 35:10.880]  we're going to take them after we finish the work we're doing today
[35:10.880 --> 35:14.320]  which is not letting you have a gun that isn't registered not letting you
[35:14.320 --> 35:17.840]  buy a gun where it doesn't go through the database and
[35:17.840 --> 35:23.120]  i've got a clip we're going to play later in the next hour
[35:23.120 --> 35:27.120]  adan solazar did a report on it where cnn
[35:27.120 --> 35:30.480]  says that no guns are being taken in california from anyone
[35:30.480 --> 35:34.320]  and they have larry pratt on the show and the guys sitting there going we've
[35:34.320 --> 35:36.880]  never taken any guns no one's taking your guns
[35:36.880 --> 35:41.200]  and and and larry pratt didn't even know how to respond
[35:41.840 --> 35:46.560]  so we're going to be playing a clip of that i mean this is how crazy it's gotten
[35:46.560 --> 35:50.960]  with their incessant lying and remember oh their followers aren't really
[35:50.960 --> 35:54.640]  authoritarians the minions really think that guns come out and kill
[35:54.640 --> 35:57.760]  children these are people that have never been in a
[35:57.760 --> 36:02.000]  fistfight never gone hunting uh think being a man is a bad thing
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.200]  the men are all beyond effeminate the women are all these
[36:05.200 --> 36:09.760]  shrieking weirdos anti-man feminist i've been to these million mom marks
[36:09.760 --> 36:14.080]  things they'll be like 15 of them they're all government people all of them

[36:18.320 --> 36:21.760]  the state they worship the uniform like when buzz
[36:21.760 --> 36:24.160]  bissinger said we ought to kill alex jones and
[36:24.160 --> 36:28.160]  here's more he goes yeah i can wear my brother's uniform
[36:28.160 --> 36:31.440]  well the ambassador's daughter goes you need to wear a uniform and you do it

[37:04.320 --> 37:08.480]  that's why you're so afraid to die it's why you're such a degenerate
[37:08.480 --> 37:11.600]  it's why you're because you're not tuned into everything
[37:11.600 --> 37:15.920]  you're a joke and i want to tell mike martinis in bloomberg and
[37:15.920 --> 37:19.840]  feinstein and all of you something i come from a good family
[37:19.840 --> 37:24.400]  my listeners come from good people and real adversity
[37:24.400 --> 37:29.040]  and we know the truth and we know what you are and you may crave all the power
[37:29.040 --> 37:32.960]  cuddling up to the globalist competing who can be the slimyish who can deceive
[37:32.960 --> 37:35.760]  the best who can get up there like a pentecostal
[37:35.760 --> 37:39.920]  you know preacher and uh like the police chief going nobody's gonna take
[37:39.920 --> 37:42.160]  your guns we just want the psychiatrists to be
[37:42.160 --> 37:45.680]  able to do whatever they want and you know you can't have high capacity mags
[37:45.680 --> 37:48.640]  we're gonna arrest you for those see they don't tell you all that
[37:48.640 --> 37:52.240]  it's all reasonable we just don't want killers to get guns
[37:52.240 --> 37:55.920]  adam lanza who supposedly got the guns from his mother
[37:55.920 --> 37:59.280]  who went through all these background checks and registry to get it and so now
[37:59.280 --> 38:03.200]  they're just gonna ban those guns in connecticut
[38:03.200 --> 38:07.040]  what are you gonna ban exacto knives in the sick culture where every show is
[38:07.040 --> 38:10.560]  about a serial killer every shows about murder and death and all these weak
[38:10.560 --> 38:14.080]  people get into it you're fascinated by it
[38:14.080 --> 38:16.880]  and always notice they're just these arrested people
[38:16.880 --> 38:20.560]  if you'd ever been around real violence real death you wouldn't think it was so
[38:20.560 --> 38:23.200]  cute anymore
[38:23.840 --> 38:26.960]  but don't worry though whatever civilizations visualize
[38:26.960 --> 38:30.720]  they end up manifesting and we're going to manifest
[38:30.720 --> 38:34.480]  hell on earth because we've let the worst people get control and then sit there
[38:34.480 --> 38:38.640]  and lecture us and tell us that we
[38:39.280 --> 38:47.520]  are the ones responsible for the deaths of the children
[38:47.520 --> 38:51.120]  there and they personalize those children while hundreds of thousands get
[38:51.120 --> 38:54.400]  brain damaged every year thousands die from the vaccines
[38:54.400 --> 38:57.600]  the fluoride in the water that i mean the tap water you can almost light it on
[38:57.600 --> 39:00.640]  fire if it's lit on fire before in houston i mean you're just drinking
[39:00.640 --> 39:03.840]  that the cancer rates going straight up but none of that's personalized
[39:03.840 --> 39:07.600]  none of that's brought out on the news unless it's oh look at the cancer victim
[39:07.600 --> 39:10.160]  the young child why are all the kids getting cancer
[39:10.160 --> 39:13.440]  gee we don't know give money to the bill and melinda gates foundation they'll
[39:13.440 --> 39:17.920]  find a cure by the way here's a polio vaccine full of the
[39:17.920 --> 39:21.120]  five or six different deadly cancer viruses
[39:21.120 --> 39:26.320]  little bond to your child's dna with the RNA and kill them how's that sound
[39:26.320 --> 39:31.040]  and i mean this is the type of stuff we're talking about here so if i want to
[39:31.040 --> 39:35.760]  go over some articles and then to this kho u report because you just heard
[39:35.760 --> 39:38.320]  and next hour i got my reporters that are going to play more behind the scenes
[39:38.320 --> 39:42.400]  where they're handing out the fake signs to then say they were all grassroots
[39:42.400 --> 39:45.760]  where they're coming over and intimidating people saying they can't have a sign
[39:45.760 --> 39:49.920]  uh you know that's pro gun and then blaming them saying they're disruptive
[39:49.920 --> 39:53.040]  uh we and the police chief coming over and saying you tell alex to get it
[39:53.040 --> 39:57.360]  straight and get his story straight nobody wants to take his guns
[39:57.360 --> 40:03.200]  uh yeah and i'm a chinese jet pilot from pluto buddy boy
[40:03.200 --> 40:08.560]  don't you get it i see you you play your game how there's no armored vehicles
[40:08.560 --> 40:11.520]  the by the way guess who's on the cap metro board
[40:11.520 --> 40:15.840]  who authorized tsa no other cities except new york chicago
[40:15.840 --> 40:21.040]  la detroit you know collapsed globalist areas put tsa on the street
[40:21.040 --> 40:25.440]  they now sneak them out so i can't go confront them but every week they pop up
[40:25.440 --> 40:29.280]  somewhere downtown and just stop cars go to buses go to trains
[40:29.280 --> 40:32.880]  dig through bags without warrants mike martinis
[40:32.880 --> 40:35.840]  they want the guns folks you what you should be worried about they've been
[40:35.840 --> 40:38.960]  told by the higher ups you get those guns and you get them now what do you think
[40:38.960 --> 40:42.960]  they've got planned that they know that the drug doubt
[40:42.960 --> 40:47.280]  entertainment out america will wake up that they know and are saying to the
[40:47.280 --> 40:50.560]  military get ready for a civil war years ago
[40:50.560 --> 40:53.680]  gearing up spying on everybody trying to find out what military will follow
[40:53.680 --> 40:58.800]  orders they're running around like like people on the deck of a sinking ship
[40:58.800 --> 41:02.880]  trying to get to lifeboats right now most the elite are leaving and going to
[41:02.880 --> 41:06.560]  armored islands offshore that's been reported on a mainstream news
[41:06.560 --> 41:10.000]  they're acting like because they can't believe they're stealing 85 billion a
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.640]  month but they can't help themselves they can't believe
[41:12.640 --> 41:15.760]  that they're killing thousands of babies a month that are already born in
[41:15.760 --> 41:19.920]  america by dehydrating them they can't believe every hospital
[41:19.920 --> 41:23.680]  in the country that's government controlled is murdering people right
[41:23.680 --> 41:26.960]  now who are begging for water you're like well that sounds a little radical is
[41:26.960 --> 41:31.120]  it look up the wall street journal series weasley smith on it
[41:31.120 --> 41:34.160]  they can't believe they're getting on the way with this so of course they're
[41:34.160 --> 41:38.640]  arming the wicked flea when none pursue
[41:38.640 --> 41:42.160]  because they understand they can calculate and go
[41:42.160 --> 41:45.520]  the black uniforms don't intimidate them we're flooding the borders wide open
[41:45.520 --> 41:48.320]  bankrupting everything but but still they're they've got guns
[41:48.320 --> 41:51.600]  even if we vote to take them there they know we're tyrants what do we do
[41:51.600 --> 41:55.360]  and the elite are offshore giving their orders uh just just you
[41:55.360 --> 41:59.040]  take care of them you take care of them bloomberg you take care of them mike
[41:59.040 --> 42:03.520]  martinis you take care of them you take care of them
[42:03.520 --> 42:07.360]  and all the police manuals i was watching a southern poverty law center one
[42:07.360 --> 42:10.160]  last night in fact we may play later it's on youtube and they're like the
[42:10.160 --> 42:13.280]  police are like you need to know these people are ready to die
[42:13.280 --> 42:17.520]  they're not gonna turn their guns in i'm the police chief of west memphis
[42:17.520 --> 42:21.360]  and they kill the other officer and my son and they will kill you
[42:21.360 --> 42:24.960]  so you gotta get after them yeah that's what you need to do get after people
[42:24.960 --> 42:27.920]  that are willing to die start a fight with people that are
[42:27.920 --> 42:31.840]  that went real well for the mexican government in mexico didn't it
[42:31.840 --> 42:35.920]  who's got their clock completely cleaned by other cartels that want the money
[42:35.920 --> 42:38.960]  they're like hey you think you can kill people Mexican government you think
[42:38.960 --> 42:43.120]  you're the el jefe we're the el jefe's because we worship the grim reaper
[42:43.120 --> 42:47.840]  well you know who i worship the king of kings the lord of lords jesus christ
[42:47.840 --> 42:50.960]  and that's who our founders worship and they kicked the biggest empires but
[42:50.960 --> 42:54.480]  the world had ever seen that nobody could beat and they lost almost every
[42:54.480 --> 42:58.560]  battle but they persevered and were ready to die and ready to kill
[42:58.560 --> 43:02.240]  and so they couldn't be beaten the iraqis ladies and gentlemen
[43:02.240 --> 43:06.880]  are known for their courage but not for their shooting abilities
[43:06.880 --> 43:10.640]  okay that's a joke in the military but the whole point is
[43:10.640 --> 43:13.680]  a hundred thousand troops and bagdad couldn't hold it
[43:13.680 --> 43:18.240]  okay so here's the deal that's why you see biden and all of them always talking
[43:18.240 --> 43:20.960]  about all the weapons they've gotten how powerful they are
[43:20.960 --> 43:26.960]  you know and you got uh sharpton and uh wrangles saying we got drones now
[43:26.960 --> 43:29.760]  forget your second amendment yeah i know it's there to protect against a bad
[43:29.760 --> 43:32.720]  government doesn't matter we got the drones now oh like
[43:32.720 --> 43:37.920]  you're part of the establishment uh up there al sharpton
[43:37.920 --> 43:41.360]  wonder how many of your family died from vaccines they were given did you get a
[43:41.360 --> 43:44.160]  memo al not to drink the diet coke or the tap water
[43:44.160 --> 43:47.360]  the only time you mean something the only time you become somebody
[43:47.360 --> 43:53.360]  is when you join liberty and stop being a race-baiting pimp
[43:53.360 --> 43:56.880]  but these people are defeated they've already lost if their system comes in
[43:56.880 --> 44:02.640]  of the new order succeeds population reductions of at least 80
[44:02.800 --> 44:06.320]  bankrupted future people like mark martinez are going to have to look at the
[44:06.320 --> 44:08.880]  poverty around them don't you think all the lfa's in
[44:08.880 --> 44:12.560]  mexico who've strangled it for hundreds of years and not let their people
[44:12.560 --> 44:15.920]  ever get ahead do you do you think they recognize how they destroyed their own
[44:15.920 --> 44:18.240]  culture and are ensuring the destruction of their
[44:18.240 --> 44:21.200]  own projity down the road no they're thinking about how they can
[44:21.200 --> 44:24.960]  dominate and shut people down now because watching other people be
[44:24.960 --> 44:30.080]  successful is is is a burr in their saddle
[44:30.080 --> 44:33.600]  and so they think you're stupid they're gonna creep around and say we don't want
[44:33.600 --> 44:37.600]  your guns that's a conspiracy theory there's a new clip of biden saying the
[44:37.600 --> 44:40.880]  black helicopter crowd thinks you know we want their guns they're crazy
[44:40.880 --> 44:43.920]  oh no biden you just voted for the original salt weapons ban
[44:43.920 --> 44:47.280]  back in the early 90s that would confiscate all semi-autos
[44:47.280 --> 44:50.160]  and feinstein's on tape saying if i could have gotten that bill
[44:50.160 --> 44:53.760]  mr and mrs america turn them all in and then they'll take all the others like
[44:53.760 --> 44:56.640]  they always do
[44:57.200 --> 45:00.560]  so let me show you some articles here here it is columnist
[45:00.560 --> 45:05.440]  time columnist warning others about government oppression is anti-government
[45:05.440 --> 45:08.800]  crap it doesn't exist client supports democide
[45:08.800 --> 45:11.360]  but says you are paranoid if you question government
[45:11.360 --> 45:14.720]  that's right that it's anti-american to question government
[45:14.720 --> 45:17.280]  that's of course 180 degrees the opposite direction
[45:17.280 --> 45:21.200]  dhs contractor apologizes for selling shooting targets of children

[45:44.960 --> 45:48.160]  with the rebellion and we're going to get you that's a new article by kurt

[45:51.200 --> 45:55.200]  being assessed by an offshore bank mercenary that's not alex jones
[45:55.200 --> 45:59.840]  rhetoric that is 100 veritas being directly to you
[45:59.840 --> 46:02.800]  that's why the enemy with their fake memes all day
[46:02.800 --> 46:06.480]  says i'm not real hoping you don't go check into what i'm saying to find out
[46:06.480 --> 46:10.160]  it's real because the fact that i'm real gives you aid and comfort that you're
[46:10.160 --> 46:12.480]  real and we give each other strength to stand
[46:12.480 --> 46:16.640]  against this enemy that's why they can't have anybody
[46:16.640 --> 46:20.640]  believe alex jones isn't new world order or or or or or
[46:20.640 --> 46:24.240]  isn't cia or isn't with the coat brothers or any of this bull
[46:24.240 --> 46:27.840]  they have to do that the spirit of evil has to do that because
[46:27.840 --> 46:32.080]  it can't ever let anybody know there's other real souls out there
[46:32.080 --> 46:35.600]  but you know your soul's real you know you're good you know liberty

[47:30.320 --> 47:36.000]  invoking using the deep luciferian terms for lucifer
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.320]  we got that clip coming soon too ladies and gentlemen the enemy is making its
[47:40.320 --> 47:44.400]  move as a desperate battle of the bolds counter offensive against us

[57:14.080 --> 57:17.040]  that's enough we'll play more later to show the lie with the report we've got
[57:17.040 --> 57:19.360]  about a minute and a half chicari jackson david night
[57:19.360 --> 57:23.440]  you were at this rally a few days ago what is it like to see the media spin
[57:23.440 --> 57:26.560]  like that and lie like that i thought it was incredible just
[57:26.560 --> 57:29.600]  that's my first time seeing that clip i didn't know that they had that type of
[57:29.600 --> 57:33.040]  spin on it because if you show the the whole clip which we do here at info
[57:33.040 --> 57:37.040]  wars you clearly see the guys out there peacefully protesting
[57:37.040 --> 57:40.320]  silently for the most part now the taller gentleman who was with him when
[57:40.320 --> 57:43.120]  martinez addressed him he addressed martinez back
[57:43.120 --> 57:46.320]  and i do believe we have a clip will show our viewers here in a little bit
[57:46.320 --> 57:50.800]  where a guy started cussing and yelling at the two guys who were standing
[57:50.800 --> 57:53.760]  you know peacefully with their sign but the media spin is
[57:53.760 --> 57:57.360]  they were out there interrupting and and barging in on this protest when they
[57:57.360 --> 58:00.560]  were doing nothing other sort but i mean what about saying no one wants to take
[58:00.560 --> 58:04.000]  your guns when martinez basically said yeah we're going to register now and
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.560]  then get them you'll need your you'll need that sign
[58:06.560 --> 58:10.160]  oh yeah just like the lady said they showed the lady and maybe that was her
[58:10.160 --> 58:13.120]  view but you know they show the clip of martinez
[58:13.120 --> 58:15.920]  was saying yes i'm going to take your guns and you're going to need that sign
[58:15.920 --> 58:19.120]  very soon because we're going to take your guns well they edited his comments
[58:19.120 --> 58:22.960]  to make it sound that way it's just incredible
[58:22.960 --> 58:26.080]  yeah no no no one wants your guns and then they spin the martinez clip to
[58:26.080 --> 58:29.200]  deceive their viewers right i mean do you have to you guys work in news
[58:29.200 --> 58:34.640]  you had they had to work to be deceptive yeah we try to tell the truth i mean i

[1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:31.520]  live from austin texas alex jones
[1:00:31.520 --> 1:00:35.360]  all right folks i've got my reporters david night and jacari jackson in studio
[1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:39.200]  with us i know that x7 some other stations join us in this first
[1:00:39.200 --> 1:00:43.040]  hour but also in the second and third so some stations are joining us now
[1:00:43.040 --> 1:00:46.400]  and uh gentleman how would you recap for people that just tuned in
[1:00:46.400 --> 1:00:49.520]  the state of the all-out war on the second amendment
[1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:52.720]  and then watching the microcosm of how the bloomberg
[1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:56.080]  uh wall street it's the corporation's trying to take our guns so they can get
[1:00:56.080 --> 1:00:59.680]  all the corporate welfare that watching the bloomberg machine here in austin
[1:00:59.680 --> 1:01:03.280]  is a microcosm for the rest of the country and the solid wall
[1:01:03.280 --> 1:01:07.840]  of deception and then martinis gets off script the the mayor proteam and says
[1:01:07.840 --> 1:01:10.720]  well we're going to register now then we'll get your guns later david night
[1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:14.480]  yeah there's a lot of deception with this the whole thing is based on deception
[1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:18.640]  and saying if you believe this you're a conspiracy theorist and you're paranoid
[1:01:18.640 --> 1:01:21.840]  but uh when you really scratch them when you get them really upset when you get
[1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:24.320]  them fired up they say something like martinis did
[1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:27.040]  and what you can see with this crowd shot that we've got there is something
[1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:30.080]  that's exactly the opposite of what khou had
[1:01:30.080 --> 1:01:34.240]  khou was saying that it was these uh two second amendment activists who were
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:37.840]  disrupting the crowd but they were just silently standing there and it was the
[1:01:37.840 --> 1:01:41.440]  the crowd that was crowding around them and holding signs in front of them and
[1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:44.800]  in back of them we got a clip of that and uh we got a clip of the guy talking
[1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:48.720]  he was very calm and it was a guy in the back that started screaming profanities
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:52.720]  in a really loud voice and at that point arcevado and the other cops converged
[1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:56.160]  on these two guys and they were watching them they weren't watching to protect
[1:01:56.160 --> 1:01:59.360]  them from the other crowd and this just happened to me
[1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:02.400]  and this whole bloomberg group is just all under you know globalist control and
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:05.280]  city control it's happening all over the country where they have somebody come
[1:02:05.280 --> 1:02:08.320]  over and yell and scream and then the cops come in on you and then later you
[1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:11.360]  see that person leave with them well it's very telling because you know you
[1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:15.360]  have bloomberg with his demanded plan and these are moms who demand an action
[1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:18.800]  i mean it's all coming from the same people it's the same attitude and it's
[1:02:18.800 --> 1:02:22.640]  the nanny state first you get the women yeah then you've got the children so
[1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:26.480]  follow the man adolf hitler they're making demands on us and it's the nanny
[1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:29.360]  state this kind of nanny attitude and of course they're going to be natural
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:33.120]  allies with moms you know we're going to kind of fit into that whole nanny
[1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:34.720]  state name well there's another name they're called
[1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:39.040]  house slaves yeah yeah so yeah exactly that's the roman model i mean i've got
[1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:42.080]  the manuals these are house slaves they're there the government's their
[1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:43.760]  buddy and they're going to tell them in what to do
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:46.160]  right right right i mean the bible says the ultimate
[1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:49.280]  tyranny women will be set on top of you and that's what this is
[1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:52.320]  nothing against women the women get totally enslaved in it look at where
[1:02:52.320 --> 1:02:56.640]  women are in this society totally depressed pure sex objects now the
[1:02:56.640 --> 1:02:58.720]  opposite of what they claim they didn't want to be
[1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:01.360]  jacar we're going to break tell us about some of the clips we've got coming up
[1:03:01.360 --> 1:03:04.480]  at the great cruise in there running well coming up we have the clip uh
[1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:08.080]  david was just alluding to where the crowd starts yelling at the two guys who
[1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:12.080]  were peacefully protesting and asavado and some other police officers come in
[1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:16.320]  and also we'll show you some crowd comparisons to this most recent mom's
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:19.680]  demand action rally versus some of the other that is banker
[1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:23.680]  collaborators demand we be their slaves yeah they're saying that they don't
[1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:27.360]  want your guns but when martina says yeah we're going to take your guns everybody
[1:03:27.360 --> 1:03:31.200]  starts cheering and clapping and we have more we have asavado view on
[1:03:31.200 --> 1:03:35.040]  registration and asavado also criticizing constitutional
[1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:39.040]  sheriffs i think that's going to be uh oh but and and then after we do that
[1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:42.880]  we'll play biden saying oh the secret service is coming to get you
[1:03:42.880 --> 1:03:46.080]  the bill says they'll have law enforcement power in the states
[1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:49.440]  and go after people sheriffs that don't do what they're told and then they just
[1:03:49.440 --> 1:03:52.640]  hope you don't in fact i had that in yesterday's stack and somebody from the
[1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:55.920]  crew get me the uh the article about i think it was a curtain
[1:03:55.920 --> 1:03:59.600]  memo article secret service prepares you know i think it's colorada up in arms
[1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:03.360]  over bill to send secret service after sheriffs and the sheriffs are speaking
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:07.680]  up it's hickenlooper in colorado governor hickenlooper
[1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:10.880]  is pushing yeah is on side of that bill but i mean what do you call that when
[1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:16.000]  they just lie about everything deception that's the only term i could
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:19.360]  i could come up to describe that well it's propaganda
[1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:22.960]  you know it is the sort of thing where you tell it doesn't matter what you say
[1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:26.400]  as long as you repeat it enough and loudly enough and you ridicule the other
[1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:30.160]  song that's another hitler quote yeah right right and so it doesn't matter
[1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:33.200]  that we link to the documents right doesn't matter it's on the federal
[1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:36.160]  government's own side doesn't matter it's a bill being debated in colorada
[1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:39.200]  biden gets up and goes that doesn't exist they did the same thing the mom said
[1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:41.920]  they hold their signs up in front of it to say something else
[1:04:41.920 --> 1:04:44.800]  but the same thing they did to the second amendment well they yell at you and
[1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:46.800]  bump into you and the cops come over on to you
[1:04:46.800 --> 1:04:49.920]  right pretty much yeah can you imagine how they're gonna act once they get our

[1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:48.160]  and tyranny i don't want to live under it but the fact is asaveta knows what he's
[1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:50.720]  doing and and he may have lied to himself or
[1:09:50.720 --> 1:09:53.440]  whatever well this is the way it's going i'll just go along with it
[1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:57.680]  but my crew was there and this is a guy being brought in by bloomberg

[1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:05.760]  city ladies and gentlemen fastest growing wealthiest in the country per capita
[1:10:05.760 --> 1:10:08.640]  the heart of texas it's part of the unigen 21

[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:21.280]  we've got eight clips here and in eight different angles of deception
[1:10:21.280 --> 1:10:24.320]  uh but uh david night who was there with jacari jackson
[1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:28.080]  this was this weekend and we finally got around to looking at the footage
[1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:31.760]  a few days ago as the guys have been busy with other news break down
[1:10:31.760 --> 1:10:34.480]  well first let's play the clip and then we'll get david night jacari jackson's
[1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:38.000]  take on it and then walk through these other clips but but here is the
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:41.200]  austin city council member to a guy that has a sign
[1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:45.520]  for new listeners saying stop gun ban and he says hey we're not gonna
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:49.280]  ban guns right now this is not an assault this is not a
[1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:53.440]  don't run we are your friends this is not an assault at the weco compound
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:10:57.280]  but after we do this which is gun registration
[1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:00.400]  you will need that sign because we are gonna do that you'll need that sign
[1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:04.320]  to which the crowd roars and martin has already said shut down the gun shows
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:08.560]  you know ban the guns before so this is their plan they say it all the time
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:12.880]  but then they tell you oh that's not our plan so they're not trying to
[1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:15.920]  take our rights or trying to steal them under the radar which just shows the
[1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:20.720]  despicable nature but martina's loved to brag who loves to brag scum
[1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:23.840]  they always love to tell you and it's just like in the cartoons with a bad guy
[1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:26.800]  you know what i'm gonna do to you now and they give the plan

[1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:35.840]  yeah so you saw the the guy these idiots have no idea because they're not
[1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:38.000]  going to stop they're already announcing our kids are theirs
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:41.040]  they just want a war i tell you they're going to get it too
[1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:43.440]  exactly i mean i'm telling you i'm sorry go ahead
[1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:47.520]  no you saw the uh the two guys the uh the pro-gun guys were out there
[1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:51.600]  peacefully protesting now when martinez addressed them they addressed martinez
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:54.960]  back and then you saw the younger guy behind them started yelling and cussing
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:58.560]  and we had to bleep it out for our viewers but they were saying you know
[1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:02.560]  f words and you a-hole and all this stuff to the go out oh yeah real loud yeah
[1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:05.680]  and then the cops come converge on the two guys who are minding their own
[1:15:05.680 --> 1:15:08.560]  business not the young guy who's yelling well you've seen people that have gone
[1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:12.480]  out to these illegal immigration rallies where millions of illegals it was
[1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:15.200]  somebody's hundreds of thousands but millions total are marching i've got it
[1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:18.560]  in in in game the extra and the guy is simply there
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:22.080]  protesting himself peacefully and the cops beating bloods coming out his
[1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:25.840]  face and the illegals come over and taunt and join in and the cops are like
[1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:29.440]  high-fying them i mean this is a takeover folks
[1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:32.800]  and again it's not to empower the illegals either it's just all a takeover
[1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:36.000]  when you look at this you see what their attitude toward the first amendment is
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:39.280]  you see what their tolerance is i mean they're making demands on everybody
[1:15:39.280 --> 1:15:41.840]  and they don't have anything for the first amendment in when they have
[1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:44.320]  respect for the second amendment and what they're doing with this guy in terms
[1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:47.680]  of standing in front of him and blocking him front and back is the same thing
[1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:50.560]  that biden and these other guys are doing when we try to get the truth out
[1:15:50.560 --> 1:15:53.360]  there about the ammunition purchases and everything they just hold up
[1:15:53.360 --> 1:15:56.240]  more signs in front of us and say oh you're you're crazy maybe like if you
[1:15:56.240 --> 1:15:59.440]  came up to the bank an old lady came up and saw guys in mask with bags of money
[1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:02.320]  and she said are you robbing the bank and you're like he's wearing a mask because
[1:16:02.320 --> 1:16:05.600]  no man we're not i mean it's that level jacari
[1:16:05.600 --> 1:16:10.320]  yeah it just it it shows that they want their their voice to be heard their
[1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:13.360]  angle to be heard but if you have a differing opinion
[1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:17.360]  they just completely shut them down you're absolutely right what's the next
[1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:20.160]  clip well the next one we got is kind of a
[1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:23.600]  thing about go ahead it's how you talk about oh well this one the next clip is
[1:16:23.600 --> 1:16:27.040]  about uh somebody asked asavado or he brings up the statement
[1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:30.320]  well about the gun crime in chicago and he said i'm tired of people
[1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:33.680]  bringing up gun crime in chicago as you know a reason
[1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:36.160]  why they need their gun so if we have that clip ready we can go ahead and this
[1:16:36.160 --> 1:16:46.160]  is amazing
[1:16:46.160 --> 1:17:00.160]  violence in chicago
[1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:04.480]  david with regard to guns we need to take away the reason
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:08.240]  that people are shooting one another that's right and that's because chicago
[1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:13.040]  the superintendent of police says 80 percent of the of the killings are
[1:17:13.040 --> 1:17:17.280]  from uh from gangs fighting over the control of
[1:17:17.280 --> 1:17:20.400]  drugs exactly doesn't that tell us something so
[1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:24.320]  if you want to talk about the control of drugs or you want to talk about
[1:17:24.320 --> 1:17:27.200]  guns you need to take away the reason that the
[1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:32.000]  people are using the drugs and and why the people are buying and using
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:35.040]  the guns and that's a former prosecutor you interviewed but i just want to say
[1:17:35.040 --> 1:17:38.160]  this about asavado why don't we have that crime
[1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:41.680]  right here because loophole guns could come here that's it's because it's a
[1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:45.280]  month go ahead jacari that's the exact point like david brought up the point
[1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:48.720]  that if let's say they are getting their guns from texas or wherever else
[1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:51.440]  then we should have at least the same amount of crime that they have in
[1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:54.080]  chicago every one of these liberal cities is not
[1:17:54.080 --> 1:17:57.920]  liberal these are mafia families they bring in the drugs the whores the
[1:17:57.920 --> 1:18:01.200]  corruption and then that's all that can and the criminals all move there
[1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:03.680]  because less than half the murders get solved there
[1:18:03.680 --> 1:18:07.040]  chicago's the place to go bust in houses and rape women
[1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:10.560]  by his argument we should have a high crime rate because we have free access
[1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:14.080]  to guns so it should be higher higher but the other thing is is that he wants
[1:18:14.080 --> 1:18:18.800]  to invoke chicago we've got a former prosecutor who was there for 43 years
[1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:22.880]  as a cook county prosecutor in chicago in chicago and he quotes the current
[1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:26.800]  chicago police chief saying that 80 percent of the shootings in chicago
[1:18:26.800 --> 1:18:30.000]  are because of drug and you interviewed him last week and people his name his
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:34.560]  name is jim gearock and he's with law enforcement against prohibition
[1:18:34.560 --> 1:18:38.160]  it's a former prosecutors and former and you can just see in his eyes
[1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:42.320]  he's a caring loving good person and then you look at the eyes of martinis
[1:18:42.320 --> 1:18:45.920]  or bloomberg these are evil power tripping villains i mean you know a
[1:18:45.920 --> 1:18:49.600]  bad guy when they're that bad they don't want to hide it i mean these are bad
[1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:52.800]  people i mean it's just like come on when we look at the gun statistics that
[1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:57.680]  piers morgan puts out there uh it needs to be said that the majority like he
[1:18:57.680 --> 1:19:01.520]  said in chicago 80 percent of these gun shootings are because of drug prohibition
[1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:05.120]  and then they say well you don't care because it's the gangs no but gangbangers
[1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:09.200]  killing each other over government shipped in drugs don't take my guns
[1:19:09.200 --> 1:19:12.800]  that's right that's right but they want to turn it against a legitimate
[1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:16.160]  peaceful gun well we've also got the statistic of the 49 drop
[1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:19.040]  in violent crime the last 20 years that's the big secret where the guns are
[1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:22.320]  jacari tell us what's coming up after the break the other clips after this break
[1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:26.720]  we'll have a comparison of crowds to the moms to some other events and also
[1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:29.280]  asavado as he criticizes constitutional sheriffs
[1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:32.960]  and asavado's view on gun registration and much more
[1:19:32.960 --> 1:19:37.520]  and continuing with guns we've got the head uh of the uh
[1:19:37.520 --> 1:19:41.120]  amazing of the rock stars to me the veritas project
[1:19:41.120 --> 1:19:44.800]  uh you know the folks that blew up acorn politically they went
[1:19:44.800 --> 1:19:48.160]  they went out to say politically yeah absolutely well they blew them up i
[1:19:48.160 --> 1:19:51.680]  said yeah uh they they absolutely destroyed them
[1:19:51.680 --> 1:19:55.840]  now they've gone to the house of piers morgan and guess what he's got armguards
[1:19:55.840 --> 1:20:00.720]  i mean these hypocrites make me want to throw up

[1:24:09.200 --> 1:24:17.040]  mind alex jones here back live you know i wanted to believe in chief art a survey that i think he's
[1:24:17.040 --> 1:24:23.200]  been in studio with me three or four times over the years but i was like if this guy's an operative
[1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:27.520]  he's going to go to the top this guy may be deep cover and i'd said that to a lot of people behind
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:33.360]  the scenes here and they all agreed but now i mean he's like in the bosom of obama and he came out
[1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:37.600]  of the justice department as you know as a state police officer as one of their operatives spying
[1:24:37.600 --> 1:24:42.480]  on the police there and i'm not against checks and balances federal state it's just there's no checks
[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:47.600]  now it's the feds only taking over the state uh jacari uh david night you guys were at this uh
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:53.440]  15 bureaucrat march a million mom march 15 bureaucrat march uh you know the wives and
[1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:57.760]  husbands of city council people and state bureaucrats and federal bureaucrats get into the fake
[1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:01.680]  signs i've seen this at the u.m. where they have all the fake signs they hand them out that's the
[1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:07.520]  next clip isn't it yeah tell us about that well as we got there uh my wife was there and she just
[1:25:07.520 --> 1:25:11.440]  recorded some of it with her iphone and basically they had handwritten signs that they were handing
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:16.160]  out to people uh and we wanted to contrast that with a day of resistance which was a pro second
[1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:20.880]  amendment rally that was really a grassroots organization and you know when they start doing
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:24.560]  things like this the first thing that comes to mind is astroturf you know and quite frankly
[1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:30.480]  this mom's demand a plan is very well financed their website is really top notch i mean it you
[1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:33.440]  know the obviously when you look at the day of resistance it was something that was thrown to
[1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:37.680]  you know it's a known bloomberg front mm-hmm so we want to take a look at this we've got a clip
[1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:42.080]  of them handing out let's go to that this was fantastic i have to tell you we really missed
[1:25:42.080 --> 1:25:48.240]  alex here today it was a great crowd uh maybe two or twenty five hundred people correct uh it was
[1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:53.520]  just jammed back with uh people as sheriff mack yes sheriff mack dedicated to the holy cause of
[1:25:53.520 --> 1:25:58.560]  liberalism you can recall it this is the day of resistance and you can see the real signs right
[1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:02.960]  there real people that looks like a thousand or more i wasn't there how many thousands they showed
[1:26:02.960 --> 1:26:06.560]  up with their own signs i mean they had them in the back of their trucks here's a grandmother
[1:26:06.560 --> 1:26:12.640]  mother and a life member now this is the most recent a staggering figure that surpasses other
[1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:22.240]  people and listen here thank you for making them thank you so they're they're handing out signs
[1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:28.000]  and they're all done looking different yeah i mean it's just yeah it's something you know if you go
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:32.320]  to a romney rally or a ron paul rally they've got signs they hand out to people and so obviously
[1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:35.440]  that they're printed up right people holding that that's yeah they're all uniform then it's not
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:39.760]  deceptive it's ron paul boom you know right but you you know make up a lot of different but if ron paul
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:43.680]  had a whole bunch of different ones that looked like they were grassroots and was fake i mean it'd
[1:26:43.680 --> 1:26:47.360]  be a scandal yeah you can see like that's the you can see all the signs they have on the table right
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:52.480]  there for radio listeners you can watch this right now streaming video at prism planet dot tv
[1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:56.480]  this will be archived later in the day at prism planet dot tv in the demara at info wars dot com
[1:26:56.480 --> 1:27:02.000]  for radio listeners but this is powerful info because it shows it's all a fraud right well that's
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:06.080]  something that bears some more investigation about whether it's astroturfing exactly exactly we have
[1:27:06.080 --> 1:27:11.120]  more clips to get to uh our next clip is asavado as he criticizes constitutional sheriffs people
[1:27:11.120 --> 1:27:14.720]  like sheriff mac so the guys are ready with that clip we can uh get that rolling let's go to that
[1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:19.600]  club you can't say that you stand for the constitution as a elected sheriff law enforcement official
[1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:24.480]  as part of the executive branch in both the constitution in terms of the second amendment
[1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:30.160]  and turn around and absolutely ignore the rest of our 200 years of law that talks about the
[1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:36.480]  separation of powers you are an executive branch whether you like it or not your job is enforced
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:41.920]  the law as passed by the legislator branch as interpreted by the judicial branch as it's
[1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:46.800]  carried out by the executive branch and to say otherwise it's hypocrisy god bless you all thanks
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:52.400]  for doing that you analyze the statistics honestly i think you'll see that it is better to have a
[1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:59.520]  government however those are in material those arguments mean nothing when you live in a country
[1:27:59.520 --> 1:28:06.800]  where the supreme law of the land completely and entirely forbids gun control in this country
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:12.720]  because all forms of gun control are against the law here in my book uh the magic of gun
[1:28:12.720 --> 1:28:18.400]  control there's a country that has gun control in america so we're gonna need local officials
[1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:23.040]  especially sheriffs to tell the federal government there's just a few things you're not going to do
[1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:28.560]  in our county and one of them is gun control all right it's against the law all right again a lot
[1:28:28.560 --> 1:28:34.080]  of crowd noise there but uh i mean talk about what a savannah is saying there and and again
[1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:37.760]  we have a clip after the break biden is running around saying the black helicopter people think
[1:28:37.760 --> 1:28:42.160]  we're going to send the secret service into your states they've got bills introduced that they're
[1:28:42.160 --> 1:28:47.600]  trying to ram through where they will send them in to go after sheriffs i mean it's just the
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:51.520]  same it's a military tactic we're not trying to take your guns even though we are there are no
[1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:55.440]  bullets there is no bill for secret service to come into your state i mean they lie to you
[1:28:55.440 --> 1:29:00.640]  because you are seen as an enemy this standard military operation well it's very interesting to
[1:29:00.640 --> 1:29:05.360]  see what a suede is doing what he's doing is he's taking a system of checks and balances
[1:29:05.360 --> 1:29:09.360]  that wasn't just at the federal level there were checks and balances you know the people have a
[1:29:09.360 --> 1:29:12.880]  check and balance they have the second amendment they've got jury notification the states have a
[1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:16.640]  check and a balance against the federal government and what he's doing is he's taking away that system
[1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:22.720]  of checks and balances and he's trying to substitute a rigid hierarchy that is federally based and
[1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:26.560]  that's what his speech was about that's why he attacked the constitutional sheriff all right
[1:29:26.560 --> 1:29:29.920]  we've got our next guest coming up and i want you guys to stay over and finish that last
[1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:34.480]  clip and uh you know talk about what we're facing here but the big news is and the video's up at
[1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:39.600]  info wars dot com of the austin city councilman who's hooked in with bloomberg saying we're
[1:29:39.600 --> 1:29:45.200]  going to register then we're going to confiscate and the crowd sharing that video is coffin nails

[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:53.040]  biden as one of their poster people calling for restrictions of the second amendment and council
[1:33:53.040 --> 1:33:58.480]  men might martina said to people that had signed saying no gun ban stop gun ban he said hey we're

[1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:23.600]  back to the other three short clips and then go to the head uh of the uh the uh project veritas
[1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:29.200]  james o keith who sent reporters out to the home of pierce morgan who has an arm response sign
[1:34:29.200 --> 1:34:34.720]  meaning he has arm guards so he uses guns protecting himself but you shouldn't be able to the all-out
[1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:39.680]  assault by these kleptocrats is accelerating right now but but but here's biden saying he's used to
[1:34:39.680 --> 1:34:45.360]  disinformation campaign see forbs how the u.s military would crush a tea party rebellion
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:50.080]  dhs funded core sas cops and they'll confiscate guns from christians i mean that's in the
[1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:55.360]  colorado newspapers fox news army labeled evangelicals as religious extremists i mean
[1:34:55.360 --> 1:35:01.200]  the army's training to take on christians i told you this first i'm the crazy man because i actually
[1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:06.400]  am freaked out knowing we've got a bunch of authoritarians taking over this is how they
[1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:11.360]  don't build a new car or a new computer or write a book to be popular they take over and take your
[1:35:11.360 --> 1:35:17.040]  tax money okay and and and these are authoritarians these are not liberals so here's biden going he
[1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:22.480]  knows about disinformation there's no plan to use secret service on sheriffs there's no new
[1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:26.480]  world order he just gave a speech when ladies and gentlemen the bills are being introduced all over
[1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:32.880]  the place uh where the secret service operates now is your state police and goes after quote law
[1:35:32.880 --> 1:35:37.520]  enforcement i mean this is all and they're like it's not happening it's not happening let's go
[1:35:37.520 --> 1:35:44.400]  and go to that club now the nr a is engaging in a campaign which is i'm not unaccustomed to of
[1:35:44.400 --> 1:35:50.560]  disinformation to try to scare people let me read some of the things they're saying about
[1:35:50.560 --> 1:35:57.040]  background checks they say quote we the federal government want to put every private private
[1:35:57.040 --> 1:36:03.120]  firearms transaction right under the thumb of the federal government and keep all those names in a
[1:36:03.120 --> 1:36:09.360]  massive federal register they've been caught doing it before kind of scary man black helicopter
[1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:16.640]  crowd really is upset even blacksburg virginia but guess what they want to say that universal
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:23.280]  background checks are quote an unworkable universal federal nightmare of bureaucracy
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:29.040]  that law abiding citizens guess what they say the sun comes they say even if we get a true
[1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:35.920]  universal background check it will never keep criminals from buying guns none of this is true
[1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:41.040]  let me say something and i guess there's another club i saw last night where he was talking about
[1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:45.280]  the secret service stuff so they're just running around go ahead it's not the nr a that's saying
[1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:50.800]  that necessarily it's the aclu no friend of the second amendment is saying that these background
[1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:56.640]  checks and this registry that they're setting up is is really wrong unconstitutional it's the aclu
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:02.480]  that's saying that as well as the nr a i know it's but the thing is how long they're not getting
[1:37:02.480 --> 1:37:06.240]  away with this i was about to see how long can they get away with it everyone knows that they
[1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:11.520]  make bill clinton look honest i mean the lying level of this group it's just a bunch of criminals
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:18.560]  it's like a kern uh where the uh project veritas goes in and they all want to run underage kids
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:22.720]  as slaves sex slaves aren't oh wait we're here to help you and he goes to i mean it's just
[1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:28.240]  and he goes to group after group and they say that oh yeah i mean it's just full on criminals
[1:37:28.240 --> 1:37:31.760]  yeah they said we'll help you just don't tell anybody that we did you know it's completely
[1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:37.200]  ridiculous and because they're above the law yeah yeah and we'll get to these last uh couple
[1:37:37.200 --> 1:37:42.480]  clips we have now our next clip is number six is asavado's view on gun registration
[1:37:42.480 --> 1:37:46.080]  david knight asked in the question how would you feel about registering people who have
[1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:49.520]  never committed a criminal offense so if we have that clip we can go ahead and roll it
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:54.320]  registration uh people who have not been convicted of any crime you know what personally uh i won't
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:58.960]  have a problem with that because to me i registered my car for a reason uh that is so people know
[1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:04.080]  that's my vehicle belongs to me and if anybody's found with that vehicle and it gets run then they
[1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:08.320]  know there's a problem uh when i sell my vehicle i do what's called at least release of liability
[1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:14.400]  i transfer ownership again i know that folks uh really believe that if we had registration of
[1:38:14.400 --> 1:38:18.800]  firearms that that's the step right before confiscation and my response to that is the
[1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:23.600]  day the government wants to do something silly like go around to 300 or over 300 million americans
[1:38:23.600 --> 1:38:30.960]  and take guns 300 uh sets of homes with different people they'd go house to house anyway now as
[1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:34.960]  far as the registration we've seen the uh or should i say the confiscation we've seen that in
[1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:40.000]  hurricane Katrina hurricane Katrina but we also have this article california's gun repo men have
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:45.200]  a nerve racking job and i'll just read this short section many states lack the ability to confiscate
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:50.640]  firearms because they don't track purchases as closely as california which requires most sales
[1:38:50.640 --> 1:38:55.840]  to go through a licensed dealer to be and be reported this is a quote very very few states
[1:38:55.840 --> 1:39:00.960]  have an archive of firearm owners like we do says winmute who helped set up the program so
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:05.840]  they're saying if we knew who had i have seen an insane california has confiscated no guns
[1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:10.080]  and then adan salazar wrote an article for info works dot com with just them taking the guns and
[1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:13.680]  saying we use the database to get them yeah i mean that's what this is right here this is
[1:39:13.680 --> 1:39:17.920]  this article right here california gun repo men having no you know what this is so important i
[1:39:17.920 --> 1:39:23.680]  want to bring you all back into the next hour to play the first clip uh where martina says don't
[1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:28.320]  worry we're going to register then we'll get your guns i want to have you back to finish up on this
[1:39:28.320 --> 1:39:32.160]  at the bottom of the next hour guys i'm going to go to our guest okay amazing great job gentlemen
[1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:36.480]  and we'll have this all together in one big report on the nightly news tonight seven o'clock
[1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:39.440]  central that i'm hosting and one of you guys is doing the interview right here you're interviewing
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:44.800]  tonight i believe we're talking about the uh the paul revere interviews was my understanding oh good
[1:39:44.800 --> 1:39:48.160]  good that'll be awesome all right great job gentlemen we have the reporters back in here
[1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:52.400]  after we take calls for the first 30 minutes the next hour i want to bring up james oakief now of
[1:39:52.400 --> 1:39:57.520]  the project veritas dot org and in a minute we'll play him this clip of the awesome city council
[1:39:57.520 --> 1:40:01.440]  member saying first we're going to register then we're going to take your guns uh but when i was
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:05.600]  talking to them about a month ago i said somebody ought to go out to pierce morgan's house and see
[1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:10.160]  if you know he's got any uh bodyguards and sure enough he does and he has armed response which
[1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:15.120]  is a company that promises within five minutes to have an armored truck pull up with guys uh you
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:19.840]  know with semi-automatic assault rifles and handguns and sure enough he's got that sign that guns
[1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:25.200]  protect uh his home just amazing hypocrisy and of course none of the media picked it up info wars
[1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:29.440]  dot com covered it drudge report dot com covered at world net daily covered it drudge report of
[1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:35.040]  course uh you picked up our story but uh james good to have you back with us my friend great to be
[1:40:35.040 --> 1:40:40.080]  back with you alex what do you think of just the all-out hysterical assault on the second amendment
[1:40:40.080 --> 1:40:45.920]  and the unprecedented level of just lying about everything you're seeing and hearing i think it's
[1:40:45.920 --> 1:40:50.080]  as i was on your show last time we talked about how they would not put a gun on their lawn that says
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:56.240]  this home is proudly gun-free but now we're finding you know we're finding armed response
[1:40:56.240 --> 1:41:01.280]  security system signs on the property of pierce morgan's this is his beverly hills property
[1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:07.680]  and we actually confronted pierce morgan in the street outside of his cnn headquarters and asked
[1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:14.000]  him if he would be willing to help uh sign a pledge to remove guns from movies if movies if any movie
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:20.400]  led to the death of any young child so what i'm seeing is just that the people who want to take
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:26.720]  guns away are not willing to apply that to their own personal lives now we're going to roll some
[1:41:26.720 --> 1:41:31.680]  in this video for tv viewers out there that you guys shot it's up at your project veritas site
[1:41:31.680 --> 1:41:36.560]  that people want to see the whole thing which i suggest they do and share it but for radio listeners
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:42.640]  describe what your team did describe how you got the image of the fact that he has the sign saying
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:49.280]  he has an armed response security system i mean this this is classic over-the-top hypocrisy yeah
[1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:57.120]  this was this was it in a in a very very expensive area of beverly hills um and we called the armed
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:02.880]  security response systems company that's on this that's on the side to determine exactly what it
[1:42:02.880 --> 1:42:08.160]  means to be armed and she wouldn't give me too much information this is the spokesperson but she
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:15.200]  did say that there is the option to have private armed uh security show up if if there's if the
[1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:21.760]  response is triggered if the alarm is triggered so it is definitely the height of hypocrisy it's not
[1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:27.040]  a surprise you know most of these journalists are very anti-gun and they're messaging but in their
[1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:31.840]  personal lives they're they turn out to be pretty pro-gun actually so i think we need to be doing
[1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:36.720]  more of it's just exposing that the media is hypocrisy because it is the media that is that
[1:42:36.720 --> 1:42:41.600]  is doing this yeah i need to put you in contact with a group that has surveillance footage appears
[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:46.960]  morgan i have the footage but uh i haven't run it past legal legal is normally myself but i wanted
[1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:50.720]  to have it checked before i did anything what we've had it about a month it's pierce morgan behind
[1:42:50.720 --> 1:42:55.840]  the scenes shooting guns talking about how much he'd love to live in texas and have guns like this
[1:42:56.480 --> 1:43:02.240]  uh it's high def surveillance footage of him uh and i just uh i haven't released it yet i guess
[1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:07.360]  i've now released the fact that we have that footage there's no into it i'm sorry go ahead
[1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:13.440]  no it that the funny thing legal i mean you know we we deal with legal issues all the time we're
[1:43:13.440 --> 1:43:17.440]  very careful not to cross the line i mean we didn't release pierce morgan's personal address but we
[1:43:17.440 --> 1:43:23.440]  did look up property deeds and incidentally he's got it seems to be he's got a property in calabrasas
[1:43:23.440 --> 1:43:29.440]  california beverly hills california he works in new york um some of them are registered under
[1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:35.440]  different names but this isn't a very ritzy area of um of beverly hills but uh you know the paycheck
[1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:39.600]  is more important than the principles they're not willing to live up to the courage of their own
[1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:43.280]  of their own principles in fact personally in their own lives they're very pro-gun and then
[1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:49.520]  publicly they're anti-gun so they're not only hypocrites they're frauds it's pretty incredible
[1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:56.640]  to sit there and see this unfold uh do you think they're going to succeed they say it's razor's
[1:43:56.640 --> 1:44:00.880]  margin in the senate with this bill they've got but they've set up this idea that every time there's
[1:44:00.880 --> 1:44:06.480]  a new shooting it's gun owners fault like every time someone gets stabbed with an exacto knife
[1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:11.600]  like at lonestar college in texas 12 people it's the fault of anyone that owns butcher knives i mean
[1:44:11.600 --> 1:44:17.680]  it's just so asinine but that are they going to succeed with their war against reality well i
[1:44:17.680 --> 1:44:22.480]  think that one of the things that helps them is they say that it's for the children and there's a
[1:44:22.480 --> 1:44:30.320]  lot of um sort of uh propaganda in the news about being for the children they're always talking about
[1:44:30.320 --> 1:44:35.760]  children and that's one of the things i think that we frame the debate in a very interesting
[1:44:35.760 --> 1:44:41.040]  and different way this time around we actually went up to these people and actually said well
[1:44:41.040 --> 1:44:45.440]  it's for the children you know edit out guns from from movies we're trying to make a point
[1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:51.280]  about the absurdity but i think the fact that they frame it as for the children is really
[1:44:51.280 --> 1:44:56.000]  what what what takes it into a realm where you really can't disagree with them and i think we
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:45:01.360]  need to be saying you know what we want to do is for the children we need to be you know turning
[1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:09.520]  it on its head but uh it's it's definitely out of control our story is up at drudgereport.com
[1:45:09.520 --> 1:45:14.160]  right now for anybody that would like to go there under uh the image of the former congressman weiner
[1:45:14.960 --> 1:45:21.120]  police confiscating firearms from people taking anti-anxiety medication now they're saying and
[1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:25.520]  then and then the state house is talking about this and of course that's the model of the country new
[1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:32.240]  york for gun confiscation as they bragged that they are going to go after everybody's um guns
[1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:38.560]  who's ever been on any anti-anxiety uh if you've ever uh had a prescription for valium 30 years
[1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:42.880]  ago they're now digitizing those records like hey you know you're you're stressed out quit drink
[1:45:42.880 --> 1:45:47.440]  and take some valium you know a doctor recommends that uh or here you know you had a car wreck or
[1:45:47.440 --> 1:45:52.000]  your wife died here you know go on lou vox and then you don't like it you get off and then they're
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:57.280]  going to say everybody is mentally ill and take their guns are you concerned this could cause a
[1:45:57.280 --> 1:46:02.000]  civil war because i'm here to tell you homeland security is training for a civil war they're
[1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:08.160]  preparing for a civil war while biden is saying that they're not but they are i mean what do you
[1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:14.560]  i mean do they have dreams of grandeur that they could be like hitler or stalin you're asking me
[1:46:14.560 --> 1:46:21.760]  yes sir i don't i don't know what exactly they're preparing for but um i think the priority for us
[1:46:21.760 --> 1:46:28.800]  right now the priority for citizen journalists is to take it directly to the media take it directly
[1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:35.120]  to pierce morgan's front lawn take it directly outside of his office in time Warner in new york
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:39.440]  take the fight right to these journalists because they control the message because they're not
[1:46:39.440 --> 1:46:45.760]  journalists they're not journalists they were they were assaulting one or two pro gun guys in austin
[1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:50.080]  and then on the news said they caused a problem at the anti-gun rally and then they said we're
[1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:55.120]  going to register i'm sorry go ahead it's just they're so deceptive i mean they're the bad guys
[1:46:55.120 --> 1:46:59.360]  is my point that's what people don't seem to understand i mean yes there's a lot of government
[1:46:59.360 --> 1:47:06.000]  fraud and and lying going on but i think the priority is to take it directly to the journalists
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:10.640]  take it to their doorsteps take it to their companies point out the hypocrisy in their
[1:47:10.640 --> 1:47:16.400]  personal lives and that will ultimately discredit them and it will it'll have a huge impact on any
[1:47:16.400 --> 1:47:20.880]  legislative battle because the media owns the message so i think that the priority of project
[1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:26.240]  veritas is that is to highlight the hypocrisy of the journalists themselves i there needs to be more
[1:47:26.240 --> 1:47:31.040]  people doing that uh people don't i don't think they underestimate the power of our media the
[1:47:31.040 --> 1:47:36.560]  the power of the hypocrites at cnn and these other places well i mean seeing in and in all
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:42.000]  the media numbers that come in every month show this all of the dominant media is no longer
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:47.280]  dominant they're they're a shadow of their former self i mean larry king 15 years ago had 10 million
[1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:52.240]  viewers some nights when he left it was a million and a half and now pierce morgan's lucky if he gets
[1:47:52.240 --> 1:47:57.600]  a half mil and i guess we just don't put on airs your videos are seen millions of times
[1:47:57.600 --> 1:48:03.520]  my films have been seen hundreds of millions of times just on youtube alone uh i reach a million
[1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:07.760]  people an hour that by the way is a very conservative number because i want to be conservative
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:12.640]  three million a day 15 million a week one way or another i mean these maybe i should
[1:48:12.640 --> 1:48:17.840]  dress in a royal robes and wear a crown like these people basically do because they are the
[1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:23.920]  mouse that roared well they still have a lot of power abc nbc cbs news they still they still
[1:48:23.920 --> 1:48:30.080]  carry an apple phone and a megaphone and i think that you know a lot of people they do watch our
[1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:35.680]  videos they do get the message but a lot of other people are just sort of uh you know still still
[1:48:35.680 --> 1:48:41.120]  watching network news and what i'm saying is we yet you're right they still have power if they all
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:46.000]  gang up and say the same thing in the same order but even that's not working i mean you've seen the
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:51.920]  white house publicly admitting that quote drudge is is is quote causing them to not even be able
[1:48:51.920 --> 1:48:57.760]  to talk to anybody i mean one website has got them literally crapping their pants that's right and
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:01.040]  when they see but i think there's a lot of people are afraid you know there's a lot of citizen
[1:49:01.040 --> 1:49:05.840]  journalists you know drudge was a pioneer but a lot of them are afraid and i think we got to get
[1:49:05.840 --> 1:49:11.040]  just stick together and break stories that force that they got to force the media to talk and and
[1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:15.440]  the way that i found with our stories to force the media to talk about what we're doing and
[1:49:15.440 --> 1:49:21.040]  force them to cover it is to talk about the media is to expose the media and expose the fraud like
[1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:25.680]  we did at npr like we did with the catch a journalist series like we did with the recent
[1:49:25.680 --> 1:49:31.120]  signs on the lawns of journalists like pierce morgan go after investigate the journalists and
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:34.960]  you will i think you'll break through that media firewall and actually get onto some of these mainstream
[1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:40.240]  exactly exactly that's what they're afraid of is you exposing the man behind the curtain and that's
[1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:44.160]  what the white house in memos and in public statements that some of them came out last week
[1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:49.840]  i'm sure you saw that where the main you know chief advisor to obama said we can't control the
[1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:54.800]  narrative and then he used drudge as kind of a catch all is that as the top of the pyramid i mean
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:50:00.720]  it shows they're not all powerful they're not they're not all powerful there are cracks there are
[1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:05.760]  cracks in their messaging system but you what you have to do is you have to force a consequence
[1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:12.160]  you have to you're in and some of your reporting has uh reporting has got to force a government
[1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:16.400]  reaction and that government reaction we picked up in the wires that's what we do a project veritas
[1:50:16.400 --> 1:50:21.600]  we did voter fraud investigations all last year it forced investigate and they tried to put you in
[1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:26.320]  prison they tried to they issued criminal grand jury subpoenas against me for exposing the fact
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:30.880]  that the attorney general's ballot was offered to a complete stranger they've tried to issue criminal
[1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:35.680]  grand jury subpoenas when i exposed to exposed dead people were ballots were given out in the

[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:04.240]  of all their memos saying they're going to ban our guns once they register them they've done it all
[1:55:04.240 --> 1:55:08.720]  over the world they've done it new york chicago and then i send my crew out to the anti-gun
[1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:14.000]  bloomberg thing here in austin and they've got the mayor proteam up there that you know flies around
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:19.440]  with the globalist with the police chief who was with obama and biden yesterday saying to as they
[1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:26.000]  had people slap and hit and grab we showed the video earlier the reporters
[1:55:28.080 --> 1:55:34.560]  the citizen activists that are out there with a sign saying no gun ban and then the news says the
[1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:38.960]  pro-gun people cause the disturbance they lie about that and then they say no one wants your guns
[1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:43.920]  in the newscast and actually show martinis who said hey your sign that we're not taking your
[1:55:43.920 --> 1:55:51.760]  guns now but after we finish this work we are and then we're going to get your guns so you're
[1:55:51.760 --> 1:55:55.600]  going to need that sign here's the clip i want to get james o' keith's comment on this and talk
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:56:00.080]  about what's coming up next with the project veritas.org here it is
[1:56:00.080 --> 1:56:02.720]  austin city councilmember mike martinez
[1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:07.760]  thank you so much
[1:56:09.440 --> 1:56:12.960]  i've got a transformation on the african mayor and city council that we want to present but i
[1:56:12.960 --> 1:56:18.000]  want to say a couple of words um and i'll be brief first of all to the gentleman that's dying
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:25.280]  for attention uh someone needs to inform them that there is no gun ban currently but because
[1:56:25.280 --> 1:56:31.280]  of the work that we're doing here today we will make your sign legitimate shortly so you heard
[1:56:31.280 --> 1:56:35.760]  about that and he's the one that's here he's the one that's called for taking the guns so that's
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:40.240]  from a larger report i did james what do you say to that where they'll admit they want to get the
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:43.680]  guns but then they lie on the news and say oh we don't want your guns we come in peace
[1:56:44.320 --> 1:56:50.080]  i would i would i would go to that i mean that you know solinsky would say a tactic that drags
[1:56:50.080 --> 1:56:55.520]  on too long becomes a drag but when it comes to that guy i'd i'd love to go to his house and offer
[1:56:55.520 --> 1:57:01.920]  one of our this home is proudly gun free signs and see and see if he'd be willing to live up to
[1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:07.280]  his own book of rules i doubt he'd be willing to do that no i know a little bit about the uh
[1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:13.840]  martinez family from folks i know reportedly they packed the heat but but i guess i guess he just
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:20.080]  wants our guns he he wants to be on the guy with a gun he probably wants to you know a lot of these
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:24.960]  people they it's it's the guns for me but not for these so it's really about aristocracy and it's
[1:57:24.960 --> 1:57:32.400]  it's about um it's about the elites versus the people and exactly so we need to expose that we
[1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:38.960]  need to our reporters need to expose the aristocracy the elitism and the disconnect between the people
[1:57:38.960 --> 1:57:43.760]  in power and the people who aren't i know you're always doing big stuff what's coming next we've
[1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:48.960]  got about five major investigations we've got something on bloomberg we were working on some

[2:02:13.520 --> 2:02:18.960]  through but i mean i've been i've been detained i've been sued i've been slandered i've i've
[2:02:18.960 --> 2:02:23.200]  gotten defamation settlements from journalists i've been i've been through just about everything
[2:02:23.200 --> 2:02:27.840]  you can go through in your 20s and uh what i've learned is that the most important thing is to
[2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:35.680]  is to keep going is to not stop that's really i mean i mean i'm a christian guy so i mean i'm
[2:02:35.680 --> 2:02:41.520]  i'm i'm i'm not worried i'm just trying to expose things what we don't have enough of is we don't
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:48.320]  have fact finders and that's what you know drudge is is great he links to to new stories new information
[2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:52.960]  you put out one fact it seems like it gets consumed by so many different blogs so i'm
[2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:59.680]  my message is to get citizen journalists to go out there and and and not be afraid and and expose
[2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:06.000]  new information new content we need more content we have we have plenty of distribution platforms
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:10.880]  now we just need new new content and that's what my book is going to be about it's going to be about
[2:03:10.880 --> 2:03:16.080]  how to survive the machine and make a difference hey what do you all the things you've learned
[2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:20.720]  all the knowledge transferring it to others invaluable i'm telling you i'm excited to read
[2:03:20.720 --> 2:03:26.400]  the book that's why i'm i'm i'm foaming at the mouth exactly it's not like the the solinsky's
[2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:30.720]  rules for radicals you said he dedicated to lucifer in many ways i kind of you know
[2:03:31.440 --> 2:03:36.080]  half heartedly dedicate this book to solinsky because i've learned a lot from people like
[2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:43.040]  solinsky and and these community organizers they used to organize uh people for power you know to
[2:03:43.040 --> 2:03:48.960]  overturn the the the you know the republic the republic the democratic idea and what i'm doing
[2:03:48.960 --> 2:03:53.840]  is using the same community organizing tactics to organize like-minded citizen journalists
[2:03:53.840 --> 2:03:57.520]  for power and you're using the truth instead of lies well see i haven't read your book yet

[2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:11.040]  you still have time to change the forward you know make the joke about dedicated to solinsky but no
[2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:17.840]  not really he dedicated it to lucifer he used lies we're using truth i dedicate this to jesus christ
[2:04:18.640 --> 2:04:22.960]  that's a that's a very good idea i'm actually finishing the acknowledgments right now so i

[2:10:03.120 --> 2:10:08.240]  the content of the minds i don't care every californian moves to texas except they flee
[2:10:08.240 --> 2:10:13.120]  what they've done there because i'd say california is prettier than texas on average i'd love it if
[2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:17.920]  it was like texas i'd probably live there but it's a hellhole and then you come here you've already
[2:10:17.920 --> 2:10:23.040]  pooped in your pool there now i'm in the pool in texas and you're squatting crapping all over us

[2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:47.520]  you because you're weak idiots the useful idiots always open up the bridge the draw bridge and open
[2:10:47.520 --> 2:10:52.240]  the gate for the enemy to come in and you know the first people the enemy slips the throat surface
[2:10:52.240 --> 2:10:56.880]  they don't want a traitor they'll open the gate for the next person they despise you

[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:15.760]  bat-stabbing mafia crud dishonorable that's why they want to corrupt society so you're dishonorable
[2:11:15.760 --> 2:11:21.200]  because if you're not dishonorable then society will be strong and they can't overrun you
[2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:30.160]  and i'm not an honorable person because i've got some goody two shoes idea i'm honorable because
[2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:36.080]  it makes sense and let me tell you this is a dishonorable world now wickedness is spreading
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:39.520]  and i don't mean the wickedness the preacher talks about and he's a goody two shoes and a fake

[2:12:31.680 --> 2:12:41.200]  and you know it doesn't even matter it doesn't even matter the point is is that i don't want to live

[2:12:57.920 --> 2:13:02.560]  you it's exciting it's bold people play video games for adventure they go and jump out of
[2:13:02.560 --> 2:13:07.040]  airplanes for adventure they go and do all this stuff looking for the adventure the adventure
[2:13:07.040 --> 2:13:12.400]  is always about defending liberty and freedom so you can go out and write the books you want to
[2:13:12.400 --> 2:13:17.520]  write so you can go out and be the journalist you want to be so you can go out and worship the god
[2:13:17.520 --> 2:13:22.320]  you want to worship so you can go out and build the business or and the idea you want without
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:26.960]  some big cartel having government shut you down because you didn't go through the right process
[2:13:26.960 --> 2:13:31.920]  you know what you got to do to get drugs approved nowadays you got to go pay off u.s military generals
[2:13:31.920 --> 2:13:37.360]  to get them to fast track human testing on u.s troops for anything i don't know people in drug
[2:13:37.360 --> 2:13:44.000]  development okay you go pay off generals and it's all legal you pay them off and their advisory board
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:48.800]  that's got congressman on it and then they all get a piece of the drug and then it gets approved
[2:13:48.800 --> 2:13:53.920]  even if it kills people that's how america works you're oh we can't get the drugs approved they've
[2:13:53.920 --> 2:14:00.400]  got warehouses of treatments and near cures for everything they have found the cures for cancer
[2:14:01.360 --> 2:14:06.720]  99 percent of the time there's no 100 percent there's complications they've got all of it and
[2:14:06.720 --> 2:14:11.040]  they're going we've got all this we've got all this incredible technology we've got anti-matter
[2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:15.680]  power systems that's been leaked they've got everything and they're going well we don't need
[2:14:15.680 --> 2:14:20.560]  all these people look at their ugly eating hamburgers and stumbling around tattoos all over
[2:14:20.560 --> 2:14:25.120]  them but you're the ones that did that to them you're the ones that sold them a culture i'm not
[2:14:25.120 --> 2:14:31.040]  saying you're bad if you have tattoos you know my point to destroy you so that the you would be weak
[2:14:31.040 --> 2:14:37.120]  so that they could run over you eugenics isn't get rid of the bad build up the good which is evil
[2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:41.920]  in itself because you know where that goes you real eugenics when you get deep into it is about
[2:14:41.920 --> 2:14:48.240]  targeting the strong the beautiful the creative because you are a threat to them just like a lion
[2:14:48.240 --> 2:14:54.160]  will kill a baby male lion will come over and smell it and then he'll eat it grizzly bears do it every
[2:14:54.160 --> 2:14:58.560]  predatory species does it and make no mistake humans are predatory and so the globalists call
[2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:02.880]  themselves another species they're above us and they want us disarmed the toll-free number to
[2:15:02.880 --> 2:15:12.960]  join us after we go through these clips is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 you either wake up and get the
[2:15:12.960 --> 2:15:17.760]  fire of liberty burning in your heart or get ready to be a total techno slave and again the end of
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:22.160]  this road isn't just slavery the new rulers got all these little jobs where you can have petty
[2:15:22.160 --> 2:15:27.040]  power through the system but at the end of the day it's meant to be cycled down and shut down
[2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:35.120]  800-259-9231 what do you think of Mike Martinez what do you think of Bloomberg what do you think
[2:15:35.120 --> 2:15:42.480]  of these democrats openly saying with republican traders that they are going to ban our guns once
[2:15:42.480 --> 2:15:48.000]  they register well we already knew that it's the sneakiness of these people that should discredit
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  them but they always have these weak pathetic gibbering people that look like mental patients
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:58.320]  i mean i've gone to these anti-gun rallies and it just looks like like it doesn't matter they're
[2:15:58.320 --> 2:16:05.200]  black white hispanic these people all look like buzz bissinger i mean they are fundamentally
[2:16:05.200 --> 2:16:10.080]  weirdo people who hate you and want to pull you down i'm sorry i've said that gentlemen i'm ranting
[2:16:10.080 --> 2:16:13.840]  we're going to break here in a few minutes chicari david night hearing all this i just
[2:16:13.840 --> 2:16:18.000]  realized the full assault is now happening the enemy is putting their full weight on us this
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:23.280]  is the main assault it's just going to get worse and this is where we decide who we are and now i
[2:16:23.280 --> 2:16:26.720]  realize the gun owners aren't going to turn them in it's going to turn into a shooting war they're
[2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:30.960]  going to call gun owners terrorist and it's off to the races how do we stop that how do we avert
[2:16:30.960 --> 2:16:34.560]  that and recap some of the other clips before we play the clips we haven't gotten to yet because
[2:16:34.560 --> 2:16:39.120]  you were in here with us last hour for those that don't know well you talked about the big
[2:16:39.120 --> 2:16:43.440]  well go ahead you talked about the big picture we're going to talk about some of the details because
[2:16:43.440 --> 2:16:48.000]  our savannah was talking about registration versus confiscation he's talking about are we
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:52.560]  really on a slippery slope and so we want to talk about some of those issues and what he said there
[2:16:52.560 --> 2:16:56.320]  and where what he's calling for and what the democrats are calling for where that's going
[2:16:56.320 --> 2:17:02.000]  to lead immediately absolutely yeah and i don't know if the guys have the clip ready it's clip
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:06.800]  number six if we have time to play that now let's go ahead and he's queuing that up and we're going
[2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:12.480]  to what did you think when the news because i played that local kvue piece where they said
[2:17:12.480 --> 2:17:16.960]  no no one wanted to take the guns and then they edit martinas to make it sound like he wasn't
[2:17:16.960 --> 2:17:21.680]  going to take the guns when he said we're going i mean it's just and i guarantee they got a pal
[2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:25.680]  in the back good job lying to the viewers yeah it's definitely sleight of hand because they took
[2:17:25.680 --> 2:17:30.720]  the clip i wouldn't even can't say they took it out of context they just edited in a certain way
[2:17:30.720 --> 2:17:34.800]  that when the they played the lady saying well i'm not trying to take anybody's guns maybe she
[2:17:34.800 --> 2:17:39.200]  isn't she wants responsible gun restrictions whatever that means to her but then you play martinas
[2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:42.800]  who says yes i will take your guns i'm gonna make your sign legitimate because you see the guy with
[2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:47.920]  a sign that says in the gunband or no gunband oh i'll guarantee if she's the head of that group
[2:17:47.920 --> 2:17:52.000]  she wants total abolition i've run into these people behind the scenes yeah i mean i wouldn't
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:56.240]  be surprised at that myself because they may start with that we think we can get this today but i
[2:17:56.240 --> 2:18:00.480]  wouldn't be surprised if many of those people just wanted to complete abolition of firearms most of
[2:18:00.480 --> 2:18:05.600]  those people have been let out of mental institutions or they're in the government because i've been
[2:18:05.600 --> 2:18:10.560]  in i've been to dozens of those and i mean they're i mean they're all weirdos go ahead we need to stop
[2:18:10.560 --> 2:18:14.560]  this at registration and we're gonna talk about why we need to do that we got that clip ready let's
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:18.960]  let's run yeah let's go to that clip here it is registration uh people have not been convicted
[2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:23.520]  of any crime you know what personally uh i wouldn't have a problem with that because to me i registered
[2:18:23.520 --> 2:18:27.600]  my car for a reason this is awesome because that is so people know that's my vehicle belongs to me
[2:18:27.600 --> 2:18:32.960]  and if anybody's found with that vehicle and it gets run then they know there's a problem uh when i
[2:18:32.960 --> 2:18:36.960]  sell my vehicle i do what's called the release of liability i transfer ownership registration
[2:18:36.960 --> 2:18:41.520]  out of steal your car the government doesn't even uh really believe that if we had registration of
[2:18:41.520 --> 2:18:45.920]  firearms that that's that step right before confiscation and my response to that is the
[2:18:45.920 --> 2:18:50.800]  data government wants to do something silly like go around to 300 or over 300 million americans and
[2:18:50.800 --> 2:18:58.320]  take guns and 300 uh sets of homes with different people they'd go house to house anyway so i'm
[2:18:58.320 --> 2:19:03.280]  not exactly sure what he was implying no no the official new army manuals for house to house gun
[2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:07.600]  confiscation they did it in katrina and they're already taking guns in all these states that are
[2:19:07.600 --> 2:19:12.640]  banning them and arresting people for over 10 round mags with felonies i mean it's happening but they
[2:19:12.640 --> 2:19:18.720]  do want to know who has the guns of course they do they admit that yeah but but the thing listen
[2:19:18.720 --> 2:19:22.400]  to the analogy that he's making because this is all over a lot of people's signs that of course had
[2:19:22.400 --> 2:19:28.400]  been prepared for the crowd before they got there and that was this analogy of of automobiles to guns
[2:19:28.400 --> 2:19:33.040]  and registration of automobiles to registration of guns that's not the analogy we're talking about
[2:19:33.040 --> 2:19:37.200]  we're talking about a first amendment type of analogy you need to compare the second amendment
[2:19:37.200 --> 2:19:41.440]  to the first amendment the first amendment says you'll make no law the second amendment says you
[2:19:41.440 --> 2:19:44.560]  shall not infringe and the only difference between those two is they understood they're
[2:19:44.560 --> 2:19:49.600]  going to come after the second amendment gradually incrementally around their edges okay and that's
[2:19:49.600 --> 2:19:53.920]  exactly what this registration stuff is is an infringement and then they say at the rally we're
[2:19:53.920 --> 2:19:59.360]  going to ban your guns actually register them and the news spins it and says relax relax this isn't
[2:19:59.360 --> 2:20:05.040]  an assault lay down in the last two years alone the us has seen huge losses to our food supply
[2:20:05.040 --> 2:20:10.880]  in 2011 storms and floods raged across the us costing us 20 billion and lost crops alone in
[2:20:10.880 --> 2:20:16.240]  2012 we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years you may think out of sight out
[2:20:16.240 --> 2:20:22.000]  of mind and so you don't think you will be affected the fact is you are we all are food shortages
[2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:26.880]  drive prices up for everyone you might not be able to control mother nature but you can control
[2:20:26.880 --> 2:20:32.320]  your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with e-foods direct be

[2:24:14.800 --> 2:24:19.200]  night we will start going to your phone calls interspersed with some of the clips we played
[2:24:19.200 --> 2:24:23.840]  earlier but uh we were just getting into our day surveyed us saying hey don't worry about
[2:24:23.840 --> 2:24:28.960]  registration leading to confiscation that's ridiculous whoever heard of that meanwhile
[2:24:28.960 --> 2:24:33.440]  they just had a speech up there where the city councilman's like hey don't worry first we're
[2:24:33.440 --> 2:24:38.000]  going to register then you're signed about gun ban you're going to need that sign because that's
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:42.240]  what we're what we're going to do and then the crowd's all laughing and cheering and a woman
[2:24:42.240 --> 2:24:45.680]  comes up with her hand and kind of hits him in the back and they're grabbing at his sign and then
[2:24:45.680 --> 2:24:50.560]  the media's like look at that trouble making gun owner over there and we don't want your guns it's
[2:24:50.560 --> 2:24:56.080]  like folks this is military operations they found in world war one if you had speakers
[2:24:56.960 --> 2:25:01.280]  well you're blaring this is not an assault even though troops were coming over the french and
[2:25:01.280 --> 2:25:06.720]  germans did it back and forth on each other that people wouldn't fight us hard so they just it's like
[2:25:06.720 --> 2:25:12.000]  in saving private ryan where the german soldiers you know they're trying to stab each other and
[2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:17.440]  the american soldier starts getting the upper hand the guy's like oh no let's be friends let's be
[2:25:17.440 --> 2:25:21.840]  friends we're not fighting down the guy gives up many he's like slides that knife in we don't want
[2:25:21.840 --> 2:25:26.240]  your guns there's no bullets there's nothing going on there's no the fellow reserve it in private
[2:25:27.360 --> 2:25:32.000]  i'm sorry go ahead that's exactly right now i just want to talk about a little bit about their
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:36.080]  views uh you know these these people at this rally you know they just want to reasonable
[2:25:36.080 --> 2:25:41.520]  restrictions and one of those restrictions is to have people who uh have felony offenses
[2:25:41.520 --> 2:25:46.480]  you know not be able to have their right to bear arms now to many people that may sound reasonable
[2:25:46.480 --> 2:25:51.920]  they think about felonies as murder or heavy drug trafficking but we have the article on info wars
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:57.360]  dot com about a man who was arrested charged with felony offenses for releasing balloons
[2:25:57.360 --> 2:26:01.440]  and you think about this this is the new bar or should i say the the bar has been lowered
[2:26:01.440 --> 2:26:06.000]  you can see the yeah you can see it right there man faces five years in prison for releasing
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:10.720]  balloons and people say that's info wars dot com we'll go to the bottom then and click on the sun's
[2:26:10.720 --> 2:26:16.400]  sentinel newspaper he's facing five to seven years for releasing three heart-shaped balloons
[2:26:17.040 --> 2:26:21.600]  yeah so that's the new bar you know for environmental crimes yeah so if you really
[2:26:21.600 --> 2:26:26.000]  wouldn't be able to have guns because he let those balloons because he had he would have a felony
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:31.200]  if he's charged with that and on that same uh account we can go to clip number seven here
[2:26:31.200 --> 2:26:37.440]  and this is gun of asa bail talking about the slippery slope of gun registry gun registration
[2:26:37.440 --> 2:26:44.000]  there it is i would really like to see an anti-gun trafficking uh federal law to keep people from
[2:26:44.720 --> 2:26:49.520]  trafficking guns to folks that shouldn't have them you know i know that alex and a lot of his
[2:26:49.520 --> 2:26:54.880]  viewers are worried about that slippery slope um but like i've told alex before and this is i feel
[2:26:54.880 --> 2:27:00.320]  this to my heart of hearts the right to bear arms has been part of our nation's history i mean it was
[2:27:00.320 --> 2:27:05.680]  huge part of our nation's history it's something that we have to support but we protect it by by
[2:27:05.680 --> 2:27:10.080]  taking common sense steps to do a better job keeping guns out of the wrong people's hands
[2:27:10.080 --> 2:27:15.200]  over there in colorado in aurora where he's i mean that that guy would have been nice to be able
[2:27:15.200 --> 2:27:19.440]  to have something where we could at least take possession of those firearms for safekeeping
[2:27:19.440 --> 2:27:24.560]  until they can work through their issues so there you go he said i'd least like to have access to
[2:27:24.560 --> 2:27:31.920]  those guns temporarily pre-crime because he had but meanwhile he had a he was planning it he told
[2:27:31.920 --> 2:27:37.760]  everyone it's now come out in court he was on seven drugs right in a mind-controlled DARPA program
[2:27:37.760 --> 2:27:42.560]  gee wonder why the top air force psych warfare specialist didn't tell the police but now because
[2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:48.720]  it's on record goes oh well i did oh they never stop them i wonder why and adam lands they had
[2:27:48.720 --> 2:27:54.000]  his guns illegally he tried to buy guns five times oh yeah but look at what ossivate is doing
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:58.960]  he's on the typical democrat talking points he comes out and he says we want you to have
[2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:02.480]  we only want to take guns away from criminals people who are convicted felons we're going to
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:06.880]  give them due process and then they shouldn't have guns anymore because they've been judged to be
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:11.520]  dangerous to the community and like jacari just pointed out a felony is not what you think of
[2:28:11.520 --> 2:28:15.760]  as a felony it could be releasing a couple balloons on the beach and then getting hit with a felony
[2:28:15.760 --> 2:28:21.040]  charge it could be from the interview that you had earlier this week jacari with antonio beeler
[2:28:21.040 --> 2:28:26.720]  yeah and uh i let you know that situation he was arrested for filming police attacking somebody
[2:28:26.720 --> 2:28:31.360]  else here in austin yeah here in austin and then he was attacked by the police this is all on camera
[2:28:31.360 --> 2:28:35.360]  we've shown it on info he's backing away they say assault of them yeah and then they say that he's
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:39.520]  spit on them you can see the guy the police are wrestling him to the ground he has his hands up like
[2:28:39.520 --> 2:28:44.800]  this you know like i'm not resisting and they try to slam him to the ground a pretty pathetic attempt
[2:28:44.800 --> 2:28:49.680]  if i might add so myself but uh they're trying to slam the guy to the ground and he said i'm not
[2:28:49.680 --> 2:28:53.600]  resisting but you know now they're trying to charge him with felonies for filming police and
[2:28:53.600 --> 2:28:58.080]  then they'll get his guns don't worry and osaveta supported that he supported the officers who are
[2:28:58.080 --> 2:29:02.720]  lying okay and he pushed for maximum charges on this guy and it's always oh we love the veterans
[2:29:02.720 --> 2:29:07.840]  the truth is they hate him because he's an army ranger uh you know from iraq and kosovo
[2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:14.080]  yeah we'll show you yeah but it's exactly you know we're talking about they're taking a fundamental
[2:29:14.080 --> 2:29:18.400]  right and they're turning it into a government granted privilege and first he tells people don't
[2:29:18.400 --> 2:29:23.840]  worry we're only going to take rights away from convicted felons but then later he turns it to
[2:29:23.840 --> 2:29:28.320]  anybody that a psychiatrist points a finger at and that's what they're calling for they have a bill
[2:29:28.320 --> 2:29:32.560]  in the texas legislature where the police just say they think you're acting mentally ill and your
[2:29:32.560 --> 2:29:39.360]  guns are gone exactly i mean that's so the union that's okay because art is so nice and that's
[2:29:39.360 --> 2:29:45.200]  what he's a friendly guy he is a friendly guy i'll give him that he is a friendly guy just don't

[2:33:49.040 --> 2:33:53.040]  the question well basically we just wanted to see if he's having trouble getting ammunition you know
[2:33:53.040 --> 2:33:56.720]  there's reports uh it was actually linked to drudge i think uh two or three days ago where
[2:33:56.720 --> 2:34:00.880]  they're talking about police departments couldn't get ammunition the tennessee highway patrol couldn't
[2:34:00.880 --> 2:34:05.520]  get ammunition uh the lead story was uh uh some police department where they're putting off their
[2:34:05.520 --> 2:34:09.920]  qualification because they didn't get sufficient ammunition so i asked art us of eight oh if the
[2:34:09.920 --> 2:34:14.080]  austin police department was having any trouble getting ammunition here's what he said what one
[2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:21.040]  quick question are you having any trouble getting ammunition no actually no so when we heard that
[2:34:21.040 --> 2:34:25.120]  we went out and we looked around austin's to see if we could buy any ammunition from sporting good
[2:34:25.120 --> 2:34:30.320]  stores and we got every pickings yeah we got that pieces tonight uh no it'll be tomorrow night
[2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:36.880]  tomorrow night and to be clear uh i was in an academy about a month ago by an ammo and you have
[2:34:36.880 --> 2:34:41.440]  to go to the front register to get one box of two two three three or later 40 or nine all the
[2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:46.000]  government stuff and i was told by the guys behind the counter well trucks come in there's guys waiting
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:50.400]  sometimes it's the police we try to help them out you found one article out of east texas
[2:34:50.400 --> 2:34:55.680]  where the gun shop said they give cough preferential treatment so i sent you over there to see a let's
[2:34:55.680 --> 2:35:00.240]  show people there's real because i told watson about this like actually it's a month and a half ago
[2:35:00.240 --> 2:35:05.280]  before anybody had the news that they were rationing ammo and for whatever reason he's a great rider he
[2:35:05.280 --> 2:35:10.080]  had too much on his plate now it's news but i was there at academy and then i called around at other
[2:35:10.080 --> 2:35:14.160]  academies they go no you get one box you guys experience that same thing correct oh yeah we
[2:35:14.160 --> 2:35:19.520]  did some hidden camera stuff uh i believe we all went out i went to uh to one of the academies here
[2:35:19.520 --> 2:35:23.760]  in austin and i go to the front cattle first i go back to the gun bar and you know they're more
[2:35:23.760 --> 2:35:28.480]  than the uh desired ammunition your two two threes nine millimeters they kept those up front so go
[2:35:28.480 --> 2:35:34.080]  back up front to the customer service desk and i say hey do you have any two two threes they say
[2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:40.240]  yes but you can only buy one box i was like okay so i pull out my money and the guy behind the
[2:35:40.240 --> 2:35:45.200]  cashier girl he said well you can buy two if you have somebody else buy one but the cashier girl
[2:35:45.200 --> 2:35:50.080]  girl is telling me no this is our last box so i'm like okay do you have one box or can i buy two
[2:35:50.080 --> 2:35:54.720]  if i'm with somebody else then then the guy says okay okay just let the guy buy two i only had enough
[2:35:54.720 --> 2:36:00.480]  money for one so i just bought one and that was that remington bore killer yeah that's two three
[2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:05.280]  that's the one you saw we have back there in the office so i mean it definitely is bullet rationing
[2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:09.120]  and even they resort to the point of lying to you you know if you go in there do you want to get
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:12.640]  more than one box and just instead of saying sir you're going to get one box like no this is our
[2:36:12.640 --> 2:36:16.160]  last box well see i was told more because there was three guys and i bought a couple shotguns
[2:36:16.160 --> 2:36:20.880]  and one guy was shaking because it was me and they go don't worry he's just a weekend guy
[2:36:21.440 --> 2:36:26.160]  and of course all these listeners are shaking my hand and i go okay i want that shotgun and i want
[2:36:26.160 --> 2:36:30.640]  that shotgun because you can't ever have enough shotguns semi-autos and the guy's going you can't
[2:36:30.640 --> 2:36:36.240]  have two you can't have two and i'll and i'll get you buy two so he goes we got to fill out an
[2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:41.760]  ATF report you know that wherever you buy two rifles and the manager goes no we don't and then
[2:36:41.760 --> 2:36:46.160]  and i'm going well now tell me how do i get two to three more than just one boxing as well we were
[2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:50.160]  selling it right out of the truck to whoever got there first we try to help the police out first
[2:36:50.160 --> 2:36:54.560]  so i think ace of data maybe he's getting from the feds homeland security i mean i it's certainly
[2:36:54.560 --> 2:36:58.720]  got connections all right it's a ball week uh with talking to biden and he's not just standing
[2:36:58.720 --> 2:37:03.280]  behind him he's on the news with the vice president yeah he's very confident i have no problems getting
[2:37:03.280 --> 2:37:07.920]  ammunition hell diablo we've seen the articles in the other organizations police organization
[2:37:07.920 --> 2:37:12.560]  were they having uh trouble getting ammunition some gun stores even making their own now just
[2:37:12.560 --> 2:37:17.280]  to supply and we have to understand too we we touched on the very end of the uh just before
[2:37:17.280 --> 2:37:21.840]  the break but the argument that he's using the standard democrat talking points is don't worry
[2:37:21.840 --> 2:37:27.200]  we're only coming after dangerous felons and we're and they've had due process but then as they talk
[2:37:27.200 --> 2:37:33.120]  they spin it and say and anybody that a psychiatrist deems to be dodgy a little bit so it's now it's
[2:37:33.120 --> 2:37:38.720]  not a court it's the psychiatrist psychologist that are public drug raps pushing drugs on kids
[2:37:38.720 --> 2:37:44.480]  their answer is all our prosack heads keep shooting everybody up on so now let's put more people on it
[2:37:44.480 --> 2:37:49.520]  and you lose due process and not only does that person lose due process but everybody in the
[2:37:49.520 --> 2:37:54.080]  household loses due process remember there's that story that we covered uh i don't remember where it
[2:37:54.080 --> 2:37:58.480]  was but the kid had the water gun the water gun and then they went in and confiscated the dad's
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:03.120]  guns no well that was on monday the bullies are beating them up so they joke we could squirt
[2:38:03.120 --> 2:38:08.000]  them with water guns i brought water guns to school you name it we threw footballs at each other
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:11.120]  all day i mean you know whatever where's they banned dodgeball there it is right there on the
[2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:14.640]  side yeah there it is and they come to the house they go well when he moves out when he's 18 the
[2:38:14.640 --> 2:38:18.640]  kid's 10 you can have your guns back maybe yeah it took 6500 dollars worth of guns from him
[2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:24.560]  just confiscated him because there's no judge no jury no nothing just the police are gone
[2:38:24.560 --> 2:38:29.920]  because they had registration information on him they knew that he had a gun because there were
[2:38:29.920 --> 2:38:34.480]  other kids they didn't go after the other family and again that's a long island so so the issue
[2:38:34.480 --> 2:38:39.440]  here is they just do whatever they want now yeah i mean there's not even a law to do that and they
[2:38:39.440 --> 2:38:44.160]  want that nationwide just color of law folks tyranny is when they do whatever they want and
[2:38:44.160 --> 2:38:48.400]  it's here by the way you notice they're announcing we're going to take the federal pension funds to
[2:38:48.400 --> 2:38:52.960]  prop up the derivatives now and we're going to we're going to take your 401k now or part of it
[2:38:52.960 --> 2:38:57.440]  and you know what there is that new thing on investments that new extra tax and there is that
[2:38:57.440 --> 2:39:03.600]  payroll tax on poor people right and i mean how long can they get away with this level of con
[2:39:03.600 --> 2:39:07.600]  artist i mean i i just don't get why people can't see it because i used to work for the uh the city
[2:39:07.600 --> 2:39:12.080]  of talsel back when i still lived in oklahoma and when i was you know coming in and filling out all
[2:39:12.080 --> 2:39:17.120]  my paperwork they asked me would you like to invest in the retirement plan and i just seen on 60 minutes
[2:39:17.120 --> 2:39:21.040]  they had it was some town i can't remember where it was they just came in and took everybody's
[2:39:21.040 --> 2:39:25.520]  retirement plans who worked for the city for you know 30 plus years so ladies looking at me across
[2:39:25.520 --> 2:39:30.480]  the desk like do you want to sign a fire retirement month i can be a retirement you know why they think
[2:39:30.480 --> 2:39:34.000]  it's all about to collapse you got hundreds of cities even some big ones going under all of you
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:39.600]  not just in michigan but california you name it in the last three four years the city managers
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:43.360]  and three or four other key people some of them get paid $100,000 a year in even small towns it's
[2:39:43.360 --> 2:39:48.800]  come out california doesn't somebody in california make more money than obama no no there's a city
[2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:53.440]  manager in a small town that made 800,000 why not there i mean they do whatever they want guys type
[2:39:53.440 --> 2:39:59.920]  in california bureaucrats paid 800,000 the was like 844,000 but the point is they've quietly
[2:39:59.920 --> 2:40:05.600]  moved into other private pension funds that they know have been protected and they're gonna loot
[2:40:05.600 --> 2:40:10.720]  everybody else's i mean you cops following these criminals orders you really think you're going to
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:15.520]  take our guns and not have everything you've got taken i mean mexico has tripled the resources
[2:40:15.520 --> 2:40:21.920]  in major studies you can look up at the u.s does oil gold timber soils volcanic i mean the whole
[2:40:21.920 --> 2:40:27.360]  things except for a little bit of the north there's the best soil in the world and mexico
[2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:32.480]  mexico can't get anything going because the elf a's don't want people doing well
[2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:41.520]  yeah there it is um there it is who reportedly had a combined salary of 1.6 million oscar hernanda
[2:40:41.520 --> 2:40:45.840]  is the mayor of bell california and the city council accepted the resignation of the city manager
[2:40:45.840 --> 2:40:53.760]  robert rizzo assistant city manager angela how do you say that spa sisa and police chief randy
[2:40:53.760 --> 2:40:59.440]  adams who reportedly had a combined salary of 1.6 mil and see that that's not even the worst one
[2:40:59.440 --> 2:41:03.920]  people in california finally went you're taking my house for property taxes because i can't pay it
[2:41:03.920 --> 2:41:07.680]  if i have a medical issue or whatever and the insurance won't cover it you're taking my house
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:13.600]  and you make 800 000 a year in a town of 50 000 people yeah that's that's uh how it works
[2:41:14.720 --> 2:41:19.280]  that's exactly how it works and we've already seen precedents of this in illinois they had the
[2:41:19.280 --> 2:41:24.880]  teachers union and the teachers employees had a state pension and of course the state comes in
[2:41:24.880 --> 2:41:29.200]  and borrows against it to the hilt and that was one of the things that they came in and said let
[2:41:29.200 --> 2:41:33.840]  let's try to they actually voted the teachers actually voted to have private pensions so they
[2:41:33.840 --> 2:41:37.920]  would actually have an account with their name on it and they could and they had transparency to see
[2:41:37.920 --> 2:41:42.000]  what was there but now they're going to come after the private pensions and they're not going to borrow
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:46.400]  it there's just well look at europe in the final orgy they're going after the billionaires now who
[2:41:46.400 --> 2:41:50.240]  aren't on the inside group and taking all their money and it turns out the really insider guys
[2:41:50.240 --> 2:41:55.920]  are all tax exempt oh yeah because they're giving you a a haircut while they just rip money out of
[2:41:55.920 --> 2:41:59.520]  your account and it's amazing to me that people don't think that it can happen here notice the
[2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:04.800]  first week they reported on it and now you never hear about it again right and they took a hundred
[2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:09.840]  percent of some accounts yeah because why not they got away with 10% because there's no guns in
[2:42:09.840 --> 2:42:14.400]  cyprus only the government has them and well i've talked to folks that been to cyprus it's highly
[2:42:14.400 --> 2:42:18.800]  paramilitary you know soldier cops with machine guns but you don't have them and guess what you
[2:42:18.800 --> 2:42:23.200]  don't have your bank account either wow all right i want to go to some phone calls but we never got
[2:42:23.200 --> 2:42:31.120]  to clip number two which i guess is a repeat of of martinis and i guess art a saveta um
[2:42:31.760 --> 2:42:35.440]  yeah i think the biggest thing is they that they went out and intimidated the two guys with pro
[2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:41.840]  gun signs a lady hits them in the back it's weird i love women that they're heckling because we're
[2:42:41.840 --> 2:42:46.160]  not women will hit you they'll kind of just like like that you see like bow their fingers hits him
[2:42:46.160 --> 2:42:50.480]  and then and then they cuss at him and then he's bad because they did that yeah and they're heckling
[2:42:50.480 --> 2:42:54.080]  the guy and i don't know if it's in that clip but you can hear one the lady saying oh is this your
[2:42:54.080 --> 2:42:58.160]  bodyguard to the to the smaller guy and they're making fun of them and you can obviously see
[2:42:58.160 --> 2:43:03.680]  him they're covering his sign but they're the bad guys and then a saveta comes over and like leans
[2:43:03.680 --> 2:43:10.720]  into him what do you think this is america this is cuba well it's key to remember what martinis
[2:43:10.720 --> 2:43:15.600]  said you know when he got pushed and when he got his blood up he said we're going to make your gun
[2:43:15.600 --> 2:43:20.880]  band sign come true what's the one where a saveta says i want to confront alex i'm not taking the
[2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:25.600]  guns i don't know if we have that one we need that for the nightly news with that then cutting to all
[2:43:25.600 --> 2:43:29.120]  the gun grabbers saying once we register we're going to get them okay we'll get that and the
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:34.240]  registration and it's so fake he's like how dare alex say that it's just so fake oh it's like
[2:43:34.240 --> 2:43:38.160]  you catch your have you ever had your kids when they're stealing candy or something and they try
[2:43:38.160 --> 2:43:41.840]  that thing of acting angry and then and then you see the wrapper sticking out of their pocket i'm
[2:43:41.840 --> 2:43:49.040]  sorry well the registration that he's proposing that democrats are proposing is bad enough even
[2:43:49.040 --> 2:43:53.600]  without all out confiscation we understand it is a step to confiscation but it is going to have
[2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:57.360]  immediate effect on a lot of people when you look at the way they're going around and already
[2:43:57.360 --> 2:44:02.160]  using registration information to grab your guns if you're if they see something on facebook that
[2:44:02.160 --> 2:44:06.960]  your son put on there about a squirt gun or something right so you know that's a serious step
[2:44:06.960 --> 2:44:12.480]  right there it's changing a fundamental right into a privilege but but outside of law they're
[2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:18.720]  kicking kids out of school for their pastry looking like a gun right or a gi joe toy or a nerf gun
[2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:23.040]  they're i mean they're just doing it like he said brainwash turn people against guns you know when
[2:44:23.040 --> 2:44:27.600]  they locked down the school could you brought a brought your nerf gun i mean it's so ridiculous
[2:44:27.600 --> 2:44:32.320]  and we need to understand that these constitutional sheriffs that a savado attacked these are elected
[2:44:32.320 --> 2:44:38.000]  officials okay police chiefs are not elected they're appointed bureaucrats okay and like
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:44.320]  sheriff max said uh any gun law is illegal and he did go to the supreme court he did
[2:44:44.320 --> 2:44:48.800]  fight the brady bill and all the way to the supreme court and he won so they just changed it
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:53.600]  right you know it's just amazing that we've gotten to this point all right let's go to the phone
[2:44:53.600 --> 2:44:58.400]  calls here we're going to go to dean and paul kent mark john thanks for calling in today
[2:44:58.400 --> 2:45:03.200]  by the way info wars nightly news tonight we've got one of our reporters first pieces on the street
[2:45:03.200 --> 2:45:10.000]  it is incredible we got the majority of austinites we talked to did not know what the hydrogen monoxide
[2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:14.800]  was we've redone that piece that pen and teller did nine years ago and they said ban water and then
[2:45:14.800 --> 2:45:20.400]  you guys are going to go out and you're going to get them to say ban uh what sodium chloride and uh
[2:45:20.400 --> 2:45:25.760]  the carbon dioxide what you breathe out of course the epa is on board with that no they are yeah
[2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:30.000]  that's just as ridiculous as banning water if you stop and think about well the plants would die
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:33.440]  you know they've done the ice core samples the lowest ever recorded our carbon dioxide
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:38.320]  plants grow faster healthier there's more oxygen humans live longer absolutely it's almost like
[2:45:38.320 --> 2:45:42.480]  the earth's losing its atmosphere they think all those a bombs and stuff they detonated the
[2:45:42.480 --> 2:45:46.640]  the u.s. military in the 60s the upper atmosphere may have blown holes in the atmosphere but that's
[2:45:46.640 --> 2:45:51.680]  good just say the atmosphere is bad yeah i mean just kill everybody kill babies i mean your kids
[2:45:51.680 --> 2:45:57.840]  don't belong to you no and i i saw the tweet i i think we posted on info wars she goes jesus says

[2:46:03.520 --> 2:46:08.240]  kids belong to the collective now it's like like you're joining the borg and then you're not allowed
[2:46:08.240 --> 2:46:13.760]  to even criticize she goes i forgive my enemies that that is nothing new though that's a forward
[2:46:13.760 --> 2:46:18.240]  foundation deal they go i'm with jesus yeah but i mean that whole thing about you know your kids
[2:46:18.240 --> 2:46:22.240]  belong to the state that goes all the way back to play does republic oh yeah wanted absolute control
[2:46:22.240 --> 2:46:26.560]  everybody and he wanted to destroy the family he didn't want anyone to even know who their parents
[2:46:26.560 --> 2:46:30.320]  were so the state could completely control them that was his prescription and that's what north
[2:46:30.320 --> 2:46:34.160]  korea's done and then some guys accuse me for talking about the allegory of the cave that i'm
[2:46:34.160 --> 2:46:38.800]  that i support play though that's how dumb down even pseudo-intellectuals are if i go it's like
[2:46:38.800 --> 2:46:43.520]  play does allegory of the cave which is a really good allegory then i support play though i mean it's
[2:46:43.520 --> 2:46:48.720]  just like the i did never knew i was that smart you guys feel like you're super smart it's just
[2:46:48.720 --> 2:46:55.360]  normal it's the general public's a bunch of idiots i don't know do we have the calls absolutely

[2:47:35.360 --> 2:47:40.240]  keep scanning like we're air traffic controllers scanning scanning scanning well let's talk about
[2:47:40.240 --> 2:47:44.720]  this constitutional sheriff stuff i mean you know we need to get behind these sheriffs we need to
[2:47:44.720 --> 2:47:49.920]  have someone who is going to stand with the law and you know we don't need the supreme court to
[2:47:49.920 --> 2:47:55.280]  tell us what the meaning of not being fringed is we pretty well can understand that yeah and you
[2:47:55.280 --> 2:48:00.560]  know going all the way back to uh when this was first the first idea came out here marbury versus
[2:48:00.560 --> 2:48:05.520]  madison uh that's where they established the fact that uh they were going to have the supreme court
[2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:10.720]  uh review all the laws that was not an established fact jefferson attacked that from the very
[2:48:10.720 --> 2:48:15.920]  beginning and said if you do that you've turned the constitution into a suicide pack uh that's
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:21.600]  that's a let me read a quote from him he says right here uh and denying the right they usurp of
[2:48:21.600 --> 2:48:26.560]  exclusively explaining the constitution and he's saying that the supreme court should not exclusively
[2:48:26.560 --> 2:48:32.320]  explain the constitution says intending to establish three departments coordinate an independent
[2:48:32.320 --> 2:48:36.880]  that they may check and balance one another it's been given according to this opinion that is marbury
[2:48:36.880 --> 2:48:42.000]  versus madison to one of them alone that is the supreme court the right to prescribe rules for
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:47.120]  the government of the others and to that one too which is unelected by an independent of the nation
[2:48:47.120 --> 2:48:52.160]  in other words these are politically appointed judges that are going to stand over and have
[2:48:52.160 --> 2:48:57.920]  final say so over every law and jefferson said that was not the checks and balances that we had
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:02.800]  for the federal government certainly isn't the checks and balances that are there with the people
[2:49:02.800 --> 2:49:06.720]  and with the states and that's what the tenth amendment is about it says rights that have not
[2:49:06.720 --> 2:49:11.600]  been expressly or or powers that yeah hey hold on one second i gotta be engineer on there too
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:15.920]  hey guys i've lost connection to the network and i guess i need to get some intel on that what's
[2:49:15.920 --> 2:49:24.160]  going on network
[2:49:24.160 --> 2:49:25.680]  we're being hit by the novel service
[2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:31.120]  all right all right well i just want to get on the phone with you to make sure that was
[2:49:31.120 --> 2:49:35.440]  happening all right i'm engineer too all right thanks i wonder why we can't go to the phone calls
[2:49:36.480 --> 2:49:42.160]  go ahead sorry well the bottom line is is that you know uh what osaveta was saying when he attacked
[2:49:42.160 --> 2:49:46.880]  the constitutional sheriffs was he was saying you know you have to do everything that the supreme
[2:49:46.880 --> 2:49:52.080]  court says well the supreme court and everyone at the federal level is subordinate to the constitution
[2:49:52.560 --> 2:49:57.520]  and we got so what have we got a gang of nine what have a foreign government got kids like sleeper
[2:49:57.520 --> 2:50:01.120]  cells which is why we had said you had to be natural born here to be president that used to happen
[2:50:01.120 --> 2:50:05.920]  in europe what have you got a manchurian supreme court that then said you have to sacrifice your
[2:50:05.920 --> 2:50:11.360]  children on their fifth birthday oh well that's the supreme court let's do that i mean it's the
[2:50:11.360 --> 2:50:16.960]  bill of rights the constitution which never fully gotten forced i.e slavery and stuff until people
[2:50:16.960 --> 2:50:21.600]  did enforce it right you see people say the constitution bill of rights failed because they
[2:50:21.600 --> 2:50:25.520]  hate it because it's the best thing ever created in history and talking about the bill of rights
[2:50:25.520 --> 2:50:29.680]  there's a lady i'm not sure if we have it in our clips or not but she had a sign that said what
[2:50:29.680 --> 2:50:33.520]  amendment protects our children from the second amendment you know like how many times have you
[2:50:33.520 --> 2:50:37.280]  been saved or somebody in your family has been saved or even if you didn't know it just because
[2:50:37.280 --> 2:50:40.800]  let's say a police officer comes up they're not afraid of the police officer they're afraid of
[2:50:40.800 --> 2:50:44.640]  the gun on his hip you know that's why when the police officer pulls out the gun that the people
[2:50:44.640 --> 2:50:49.360]  start running but you know for some reason it's the second amendment's fault yeah all right folks
[2:50:49.360 --> 2:50:53.360]  we've got like triple redundancy backed up to the network of minnesota but occasionally one of the
[2:50:53.360 --> 2:50:57.360]  connections cuts down we're not aware of it so that caller was probably there on air going hello

[2:55:30.080 --> 2:55:38.320]  trying to you know show people just search engine operation northwood's gladio ajax etc the u n david
[2:55:38.320 --> 2:55:43.840]  spain were no one went into the new world order without taking a loose fairing pledge why can't
[2:55:43.840 --> 2:55:48.960]  people understand you know aka the new world order you know they're taking over the plan they
[2:55:48.960 --> 2:55:53.360]  i've gone to congressional records seeing these famous quotes and they're in there going we will
[2:55:53.360 --> 2:55:58.160]  have to pay for the new world order in blood we pledged to lucifer i mean i mean these people
[2:55:58.160 --> 2:56:03.120]  are crazy let's look at you know i'm just gonna say you made that montage uh i think it was last
[2:56:03.120 --> 2:56:06.480]  week of the week before and people keep saying there's no new world order and you lined up all
[2:56:06.480 --> 2:56:11.280]  these clips showing that all these people have called for a new world order or a world government
[2:56:11.280 --> 2:56:15.920]  which defines it as a world government yeah and then joe biden goes i want a new world order
[2:56:15.920 --> 2:56:20.320]  but it doesn't exist pretty much let's look at the u n arms trade treaty this is something
[2:56:20.320 --> 2:56:24.560]  that they've been planning for quite some time they had this coming up for a vote in july but
[2:56:24.560 --> 2:56:29.200]  they were still really getting hit with this fast and furious scandal right so they pushed that and
[2:56:29.200 --> 2:56:32.880]  they said we'll do that after the election and then they ran the false flags right what does
[2:56:32.880 --> 2:56:36.960]  your gut tell you about sandy hook and aurora i think it's false yeah i think they're false
[2:56:36.960 --> 2:56:42.160]  flags the timing was just too suspicious they did that one week exactly before they were
[2:56:42.160 --> 2:56:45.840]  going to have the u n vote well they should have gotten better actors too yeah it didn't
[2:56:45.840 --> 2:56:49.760]  it didn't really worst actors i've ever seen it didn't really overcome the the narrative and the
[2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:52.960]  news that was going on with fast and furious because republicans were really hitting that
[2:56:52.960 --> 2:56:56.080]  for political gain just before the election so they said we're going to come back after the
[2:56:56.080 --> 2:57:00.880]  election so abruptly i was up there at the u n we were filming uh just for this very issue with
[2:57:00.880 --> 2:57:05.920]  another group and uh they pulled it out abruptly like two days before they said that's it we're
[2:57:05.920 --> 2:57:10.400]  going to come back after the election they came back the very day of the election and they were
[2:57:10.400 --> 2:57:15.200]  ready to do this in the lame duck session if they needed to but because obama the democrats were
[2:57:15.200 --> 2:57:19.200]  having a good election they said we're going to revisit this in march when they've got even
[2:57:19.200 --> 2:57:24.960]  strong and magically what came next yeah and the thing about sandy hook is when we went out to the
[2:57:24.960 --> 2:57:30.000]  this recent rally now we're asking asavado even some other people and that's sandy hook was the
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:33.280]  thing that nobody really wanted to talk about every time we brought the question to someone's
[2:57:33.280 --> 2:57:37.120]  like well i don't know too much about that shooting i don't know too much about that shooting but i'll
[2:57:37.120 --> 2:57:40.320]  tell you about virginia tech i'll tell you about the uh the aurora shooting i was like why does
[2:57:40.320 --> 2:57:44.480]  anybody want to talk about sandy hook when it's the new thing that's pushing the the new agenda out
[2:57:44.480 --> 2:57:48.880]  there well i mean most those people out because i've been to literally the sun exaggerate 20 of
[2:57:48.880 --> 2:57:53.920]  the of the 10 bureaucrat marches and i mean it's it's all either kind of mental patients they bring
[2:57:53.920 --> 2:57:59.040]  along or it's government workers or it's actual globalist agents oh yeah and i think the reason
[2:57:59.040 --> 2:58:04.240]  they didn't want to talk about sandy hook when they're pushing their registration agenda i mean
[2:58:04.240 --> 2:58:09.680]  this is a guy who uh if regardless if you believe the official story the first story says that the
[2:58:09.680 --> 2:58:14.160]  guy purchased excuse me uh stole the firearm from his mother and they don't want to talk about that
[2:58:14.160 --> 2:58:17.680]  can you say well if you get stricter background checks how's it gonna stop a guy from stealing
[2:58:17.680 --> 2:58:22.160]  a gun you know they don't they don't want to bring that up i think that's incredible info wars nightly

[3:00:43.280 --> 3:00:47.280]  about one of our new reporters in the report that that's coming out tonight this is pretty
[3:00:47.280 --> 3:00:52.240]  pretty hilarious but also pretty scary pretty bombshell uh let's go to mark in pennsylvania
[3:00:52.240 --> 3:00:58.000]  you're on the air go ahead guys guys get your pen and paper pen and paper i'm calling you from
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:01:01.920]  philadelphia but i'm originally from missouri southern missouri springfield to be precise
[3:01:01.920 --> 3:01:08.400]  there's uh something happening in missouri right now uh a couple of guys put together a second
[3:01:08.400 --> 3:01:15.200]  amendment preservation act it's house bill 436 senate bill 325 and the tenth amendment center
[3:01:15.200 --> 3:01:20.480]  is calling it some of the most powerful legislation to come from any state in a long time concerning
[3:01:20.480 --> 3:01:26.240]  the second amendment but also related to the tenth amendment and here's why effectively if you read
[3:01:26.240 --> 3:01:32.800]  if you read the detail of the bills they it effectively nullifies the fire arms control
[3:01:32.800 --> 3:01:38.880]  acts of 1968 and 1934 i've been trying to get the word out to as many people as primarily
[3:01:38.880 --> 3:01:43.520]  missourians to let them know to call their representatives call their state senators
[3:01:43.520 --> 3:01:47.840]  and hammer this down because this could be breakthrough legislation not only for missouri
[3:01:47.840 --> 3:01:53.520]  but for the rest of the suit states to follow suit sounds good to me i mean look i called
[3:01:53.520 --> 3:01:57.600]  the second american revolution six months ago and i said it'd be a states rights movement
[3:01:57.600 --> 3:02:03.040]  not to destroy the republic but to recapture the republic and then re upload it it's like we got to
[3:02:03.040 --> 3:02:08.720]  kick the virus out and then re upload the software exactly is what we're just talking about before
[3:02:08.720 --> 3:02:12.320]  we've got to get behind constitutional sheriffs and we got to get behind state legislators
[3:02:12.320 --> 3:02:15.600]  we're going to stand for the constitution and more importantly are going to stand for our
[3:02:15.600 --> 3:02:19.920]  individual rights which transcend even the constitution the constitution recognizes it only
[3:02:19.920 --> 3:02:24.000]  points out like the ninth amendment says hey all rights not listed here doesn't mean they don't
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:29.280]  exist i mean it's yeah that's the thing they they want to make your your rights a privilege as
[3:02:29.280 --> 3:02:37.280]  david keeps alluding to absolutely man that's a great point caller a great point mark i hope
[3:02:37.280 --> 3:02:41.440]  that you'll uh and don't just count on us to know about something shoot a youtube video
[3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:46.880]  it's like the veritas project guy said you're very successful targeting the globalist
[3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:52.560]  and he said look we need other people to do this this is what's going to beat him right and we need
[3:02:52.560 --> 3:02:57.200]  to just get obama's like swarm them i need you to help me get the guns that's because they don't
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:03:02.560]  have the people i mean literally obama's supporters on average and again i'm not a republican republicans

[3:09:51.600 --> 3:09:56.240]  quote unquote felons okay people who let go balloon it's like oh just just felons and mother

[3:10:06.400 --> 3:10:10.800]  bueller yeah bueller from the ferris bueller i mean that's what it looks like if you look at
[3:10:10.800 --> 3:10:16.800]  the guy's name i know i everybody i know says you pronounce it bueller but he goes no it's bealer so
[3:10:16.800 --> 3:10:23.120]  it's like potato patata right but he got like red farve is really favverge or something but not that
[3:10:23.120 --> 3:10:27.840]  fancy but you're on the right right track but antonio bealer didn't cave and he started an
[3:10:27.840 --> 3:10:32.800]  organization here in austin too so i mean that that you know he's taking action i admire what he's

[3:10:36.720 --> 3:10:40.880]  in her teasing him but we need to realize that the guy that was the antagonist in this story

[3:10:45.840 --> 3:10:50.480]  got nothing to fear we can't know he's that's why the feds like him they're like wow look at this guy

[3:12:35.120 --> 3:12:38.640]  the u.s constitution bill rights thing it's the greatest document that the world has ever seen
[3:12:38.640 --> 3:12:43.920]  written by men and um yeah i i try to reach out to everybody i i tell all my friends i talk to
[3:12:43.920 --> 3:12:49.280]  my friends and everybody is just so close-minded trusting a naive and they just they cannot wrap
[3:12:49.280 --> 3:12:54.720]  their heads around the members zombies have never these are people brought up to television
[3:12:54.720 --> 3:12:59.200]  they just kind of they're in a daze literal brainwaves now and so they're tuned in to
[3:12:59.200 --> 3:13:05.280]  suspend disbelief so it's like it's it's like the light they're like uh scary they think of it is work
[3:13:05.840 --> 3:13:10.640]  they haven't taken it personal yet that they're being enslaved but it doesn't matter it's always a
[3:13:10.640 --> 3:13:15.600]  minority that doesn't want to be enslaved and that stands up so don't feel bad because some areas you
[3:13:15.600 --> 3:13:20.160]  run into it's the majority's awake and then you run into another area believe me you're not a public
[3:13:20.160 --> 3:13:25.680]  figure if europe if you were alex jones and it's not bragging ham a big shot everywhere i go people

[3:13:35.040 --> 3:13:39.600]  they're out there that's why you should wear an info wars dot com t-shirt because then you'll
[3:13:39.600 --> 3:13:43.920]  meet like-minded people plus it funds the operation go ahead gentlemen well one of the things is when
[3:13:43.920 --> 3:13:48.640]  you look at these articles from cnn other place they don't usually have a reference to the other
[3:13:48.640 --> 3:13:51.760]  documents when you look at an info wars article and we talk about something like ammunition
[3:13:51.760 --> 3:13:56.320]  purchases we're going back and we're linking directly to those purchases so you can see it
[3:13:56.320 --> 3:14:00.480]  for yourself you know you can google it you don't even you know you we've got the links there so
[3:14:00.480 --> 3:14:04.720]  people yeah and they still deny that every year in august they have articles in every local paper
[3:14:04.720 --> 3:14:10.720]  i read them this year or now i guess last year saying it's the law you must take the vaccines
[3:14:10.720 --> 3:14:18.000]  and there's no side effects no no links obviously the newspaper no bibliograph according to such
[3:14:18.000 --> 3:14:22.960]  and such you go online the same thing on the newspaper you go to our article hundreds of
[3:14:22.960 --> 3:14:28.800]  university links how it's going to kill you the copy of the insert right i mean i don't know they
[3:14:28.800 --> 3:14:32.560]  they just like to say stuff about it's like i believe it was a couple weeks ago somebody wrote
[3:14:32.560 --> 3:14:39.360]  a hit piece on you they said alex jones has reported that tsa hires defrock priests and like we have
[3:14:39.360 --> 3:14:44.240]  the article it's on info wars right now but they didn't link to that they just they say they claim
[3:14:44.240 --> 3:14:48.080]  that you made it you made that statement but did not link to it and that's the kind of things that
[3:14:48.080 --> 3:14:53.760]  they do well even patriot groups 10 years later go jones claims he has footage of fema teaching the
[3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:59.520]  founding fathers are bad i have where it was kansas city the video and the manual and news articles
[3:14:59.520 --> 3:15:04.560]  about it right yeah yeah we will post clips they want to call us paranoid they want to say we're
[3:15:04.560 --> 3:15:09.520]  making stuff up bring it on well i mean i mean look at this right here time columnist warning
[3:15:09.520 --> 3:15:14.080]  others about government oppression is anti-american crap they cannot have a debate about how this is
[3:15:14.080 --> 3:15:21.040]  an authoritarian takeover right they want to label cyanide mommy's milk uh shaw anything else um i just
[3:15:21.040 --> 3:15:27.520]  um i wanted to say that every single uh legislator involved in uh voting for these uh bills and and
[3:15:27.520 --> 3:15:32.080]  what not in trying to instute gun control is literally committing treason i was reading a
[3:15:32.080 --> 3:15:35.920]  an essay by a constitutional lawyer that i got off oathkeepers that i've joined them as well
[3:15:36.560 --> 3:15:42.080]  no i mean it is treason it is sedition i don't get up here look it's criminal to knowingly get up
[3:15:42.080 --> 3:15:47.440]  there and lie and try to register guns with a plan to confiscate them it is organized government fraud
[3:15:47.440 --> 3:15:54.480]  that has a name tyranny thanks for the call ron in new york then paul in new jersey uh ron you're on
[3:15:54.480 --> 3:15:59.840]  the air sir is this the retired cop that gives me so much good info yes it is and by the way i'm
[3:15:59.840 --> 3:16:03.680]  going to try to call you today i know i got your number and you've got some inside intel i've admitted
[3:16:03.680 --> 3:16:07.840]  to call you i've just run out of time uh what's your point on the orgy or evil you've been seeing
[3:16:07.840 --> 3:16:13.840]  well here case in point in the state of new york the other big shoe is dropped we've now had the
[3:16:13.840 --> 3:16:18.960]  first case in the state of new york where the state police have ordered a seizure of somebody's
[3:16:18.960 --> 3:16:25.920]  firearms who's a pistol permit holder because he has some months passed taken uh medication
[3:16:26.480 --> 3:16:31.920]  a psychotropic medication for anxiety even though the man was not deemed dangerous or a
[3:16:31.920 --> 3:16:36.080]  mental defective or anything of that nature has a complete background they push it on you like
[3:16:36.080 --> 3:16:40.400]  drug dealers at a schoolyard and now they're announcing uh that's our article you're talking
[3:16:40.400 --> 3:16:44.240]  about this on drudge that they're coming for our guns and thank god i've never been on anything
[3:16:44.960 --> 3:16:49.280]  i mean i had a con i had a surgery and didn't want to take the opiate pills because they made me sick
[3:16:50.080 --> 3:16:55.280]  you ain't got nothing on me dirt bag government sorry go ahead go ahead ron something they had
[3:16:55.280 --> 3:17:00.400]  absolutely no legal right to do this is the suspicion that the police cross-reference the
[3:17:00.400 --> 3:17:05.520]  list of pistol permit holders with what we have in new york state and you'll soon have in a nation
[3:17:05.520 --> 3:17:12.400]  with obama care a medical prescription uh database no that's in there and it was for the gun confiscation
[3:17:12.400 --> 3:17:17.840]  they're going to declare us all mentally defective and what what ron's just what ron just described
[3:17:17.840 --> 3:17:24.080]  is exactly what osservato wants to do here in austin in texas um but oh we're supposed to like it
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:29.840]  and we're conspiracy theorist even though the mayor proteam is up there saying we'll get your guns
[3:17:30.640 --> 3:17:34.880]  i'll get you registered in your little dog too pretty much i just got an email the other day
[3:17:34.880 --> 3:17:39.120]  from a guy i can't remember where he was but he said uh he called his mom talking about he was
[3:17:39.120 --> 3:17:44.000]  mildly depressed because he lost his job and then the swat team showed up at his house
[3:17:44.000 --> 3:17:47.840]  demanding that he come outside and turn in his fire this happened to g gordon leddie's producer
[3:17:47.840 --> 3:17:54.400]  like 15 years ago uh she like answered a survey or something that had her address on it and got
[3:17:54.400 --> 3:18:02.240]  put in for like a month you're gorgeous model producer you know famous and just you know they
[3:18:02.240 --> 3:18:06.400]  wrecked her life this is the secret police this is an industry that wants they're not just going
[3:18:06.400 --> 3:18:12.080]  to see ps little kids they're going to see ps adults exactly yeah well that's their cult
[3:18:12.080 --> 3:18:16.960]  they had a democratic party operative in in psychology today wrote a big cover story about
[3:18:16.960 --> 3:18:22.960]  how i'm insane yeah insanely free and sanely alive you're insanely politically dead you're
[3:18:22.960 --> 3:18:28.080]  you're a you're a you're a pathetic creature and he says i'm mentally ill well that was always a
[3:18:28.080 --> 3:18:32.560]  tactic of stalling and other dictators that say that people were insane and to commit them without
[3:18:32.560 --> 3:18:38.240]  any due process because people will stand for a lesser due process if you accuse somebody of being
[3:18:38.240 --> 3:18:41.840]  insane or you say that they're on a dangerous drug and yet we want to put the people who are
[3:18:41.840 --> 3:18:47.440]  prescribing these dangerous drugs in charge of determining who is saying well there is a cult
[3:18:47.440 --> 3:18:54.560]  of white robes you know the uh the the court you in your pleadings you worship to it you pray for
[3:18:54.560 --> 3:18:58.400]  the books that don't know you pray in the bleeding you start praying and pleadings you start winning
[3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:02.960]  all these modern lawyers don't know it's about worshiping you know the court uh it's a roman
[3:19:02.960 --> 3:19:07.440]  court basically is what they've superimposed over our common law so you worship the judge you pray to
[3:19:07.440 --> 3:19:11.040]  the judge you pray to the court you can even throw some more stuff in there and they'll really get
[3:19:11.040 --> 3:19:15.520]  excited uh because it's like it's like ancient commands but the whole point is i don't know why
[3:19:15.520 --> 3:19:19.840]  i even went off into that whole story uh is that now it's not even gonna be courts there's gonna take
[3:19:19.840 --> 3:19:24.640]  your guns yeah oh absolutely that's what they want ron anything else you want to add yes there's
[3:19:24.640 --> 3:19:31.360]  quite a bit also like that um there was now uh with the unarms treaty okay we're gonna skip this
[3:19:31.360 --> 3:19:35.920]  break go ahead we're gonna skip this break go ahead it's it's immaterial whether or not they
[3:19:35.920 --> 3:19:42.080]  ratify that treaty because the domestic laws that are presently being discussed in congress
[3:19:42.080 --> 3:19:46.800]  comport with what is called for in the unarmed that's why they're trying to get it through but
[3:19:46.800 --> 3:19:51.920]  i've read the treaty it points to the directives in other agreements we've done countless reports on
[3:19:51.920 --> 3:19:58.000]  this that says the state can have government the state can have guns not the people so it says we
[3:19:58.000 --> 3:20:03.760]  don't interfere with state rights to guns but state is defined as the united states go ahead go ahead
[3:20:03.760 --> 3:20:08.640]  debbie you want to say something about the fact no go ahead let ron go the fact the fact is gentlemen
[3:20:08.640 --> 3:20:13.760]  that whether they ratify that treaty or not if this legislation that's being proposed and supposedly
[3:20:13.760 --> 3:20:19.120]  going to be voted on the u.s senate tomorrow passes they get what they want it's all the same thing in
[3:20:19.120 --> 3:20:23.680]  the end and they know what they're doing now another thing too that i've just about had it with and
[3:20:23.680 --> 3:20:30.320]  i think it's time that we be brave enough to step up as men and say this we aren't insensitive beats
[3:20:30.320 --> 3:20:38.240]  but i believe five months of mindless emotionalism thrown at me constantly showing the families or
[3:20:38.240 --> 3:20:45.280]  so forth of newtown is a bit enough this is a social policy issue that should be thought
[3:20:45.280 --> 3:20:49.840]  through intelligently well it's not waving the bloody shirt i appreciate your call ron
[3:20:49.840 --> 3:20:55.840]  they're obviously a hundred percent shamelessly doing this i mean it's just it's it's about making
[3:20:55.840 --> 3:21:01.040]  us the bad guys hitler demonized groups for everyone after him every authoritarian does this
[3:21:01.040 --> 3:21:06.560]  we're being demonized yeah i mean and that's the you know that's the most ammunition they have is to
[3:21:06.560 --> 3:21:11.440]  just wave these kids to bring the kids on stage and hey kids what do you think about gun laws i
[3:21:11.440 --> 3:21:16.240]  would really like obama to ask hey kids what do you think about these drones killing other kids
[3:21:16.240 --> 3:21:20.320]  in the other parts of the world i really wish you'd ask those kids that well what ron was saying
[3:21:20.320 --> 3:21:25.680]  about the un arms trade treaty is exactly right i think that this has been the target all along
[3:21:25.680 --> 3:21:31.440]  is registration uh they talked about confiscation and feinstein is a master of misdirection you
[3:21:31.440 --> 3:21:36.240]  know she did that with the ndaa she told people uh that she came up with a feinstein lee amendment
[3:21:36.240 --> 3:21:40.880]  that said we're going to take out the bad sections of the ndaa that violate civil liberties and deny
[3:21:40.880 --> 3:21:44.640]  due process and turn this into a military court instead of a civilian court and then they just
[3:21:44.640 --> 3:21:49.440]  removed it arbitrarily you know mccain or then they come back and go this is the new ndaa we're
[3:21:49.440 --> 3:21:52.960]  going to restrict it and then it gets rid of positive commentators right so she's been involved
[3:21:52.960 --> 3:21:57.040]  in this kind of mystery let me treat that bullet word boom boom boom it's like she's been involved
[3:21:57.040 --> 3:22:01.040]  in this kind of misdirection before and this is about registration this arms trade treaty
[3:22:01.040 --> 3:22:05.840]  focuses on the transfer of weapons across borders and they said the only way that we can do that
[3:22:05.840 --> 3:22:11.200]  is if we identify and register guns and gun owners that's right the states have to agree
[3:22:11.200 --> 3:22:16.320]  to control the guns within their borders so just like a gender 21 the un comes up and they have
[3:22:16.320 --> 3:22:20.720]  this other uh i can't remember right off the top of my head legal framework yeah they they create
[3:22:20.720 --> 3:22:25.360]  these legal unity it's like yeah just like they do with agenda 21 and then they have the individual
[3:22:25.360 --> 3:22:29.680]  countries enact this so they're coming at it from both directions they're coming at it with domestic
[3:22:29.680 --> 3:22:33.440]  legislation and they're coming at it with the treaty because they're not going to take a chance
[3:22:33.440 --> 3:22:37.200]  that they're going to lose on this registration and if we say yeah that we won because we beat
[3:22:37.200 --> 3:22:41.200]  them back from confiscation and all we got was registration that was what they were after all
[3:22:41.200 --> 3:22:47.280]  absolutely and again it's too too cited they're not only trying to get us registered for confiscation
[3:22:47.280 --> 3:22:51.680]  a bunch of states already taking them and home inspections and all this internationally it's
[3:22:51.680 --> 3:22:56.320]  about not letting little countries get arms to protect themselves from the un death force right
[3:22:56.320 --> 3:23:01.200]  and the folks don't know the un is the greatest mass murderers over time the world's ever seen
[3:23:01.200 --> 3:23:06.400]  mal has the highest number than stalin and then hitler well i actually go stalin lin and hitler
[3:23:06.400 --> 3:23:14.080]  but the un continually just is murdering slaughtering raping lining people up shooting them
[3:23:14.080 --> 3:23:19.600]  but but angeline is joe lee says they love your kids let's go to a phone call paul in new jersey
[3:23:19.600 --> 3:23:24.640]  you're on the air paul welcome good afternoon gentlemen uh yeah well you're talking about
[3:23:24.640 --> 3:23:33.040]  fast and furious well that's that uh the guns for the drug dealers are drug dealers they give them
[3:23:33.040 --> 3:23:37.040]  as their supply they give them the guns and they shoot the people are trying to stop them down
[3:23:37.040 --> 3:23:42.960]  there that's when he shot the 200 mexicans and one of our i n s a well i mean it's it's actually
[3:23:42.960 --> 3:23:47.040]  it's it's it's actually in the thousands they they conservatively 400 it's thousands and thousands
[3:23:47.040 --> 3:23:52.080]  of dead mexicans with the fast and furious stuff hundreds here at least three cops border patrol
[3:23:52.080 --> 3:23:57.440]  in a cop uh you're absolutely right the imagine it's not about fast and furious anymore and all
[3:23:57.440 --> 3:24:02.960]  those dead kids it's about how we obama actually and holder and the rest of them ship the guns down
[3:24:02.960 --> 3:24:08.240]  there to blame the second amendment and now they flipped it around and gone oh you know the the
[3:24:08.240 --> 3:24:14.720]  congress won't even have a vote why are you doing that the family and it's so transparent i mean i
[3:24:14.720 --> 3:24:21.280]  watch the public and they are just so timid and weak i even see like big tough guys you know i'll
[3:24:21.280 --> 3:24:25.600]  sit there and watch people in public and they're even insecure people think about them i mean you
[3:24:25.600 --> 3:24:28.880]  guys aren't like that i guess because you're in the media and gotten over it or whatever i guess i
[3:24:28.880 --> 3:24:34.480]  got over it but it's just everybody's so pathetic i mean it's like it's so obvious a bunch of slime
[3:24:34.480 --> 3:24:38.160]  is using these dead kids and probably ran the whole thing and the magnitude of the people that
[3:24:38.160 --> 3:24:41.440]  have died and these other issues like you're talking about the fast and furious other places
[3:24:41.440 --> 3:24:46.480]  even obama's drone strikes i mean we point out the hypocrisy of all of this to yes it's it's
[3:24:46.480 --> 3:24:51.760]  terrible that these children have died but to to take these 20 children why are they why are
[3:24:51.760 --> 3:24:56.320]  their lives so much more special that we talk about that for months and months and sure and
[3:24:56.320 --> 3:25:02.080]  overturn our constitution and ignore these other children who have died orders of magnitude it's
[3:25:02.080 --> 3:25:07.600]  a giant psych warfare operation in its backfiring i can look at it politically but also in my gut
[3:25:07.600 --> 3:25:11.280]  tell they're freaked out and they're gonna do some more shootings that's the big problem
[3:25:12.400 --> 3:25:16.240]  they could stage one any day now and they've got all sorts of mental patients wound up
[3:25:16.240 --> 3:25:20.160]  right now with the guns trying to get them to go into school and they keep saying the kids the kids
[3:25:20.160 --> 3:25:25.360]  and you know remember last year the big uh kony kony 2012 the deal and we got to go in africa and
[3:25:25.360 --> 3:25:29.200]  save the kids from this guy who's probably been dead for 10 plus years now hadn't been seen for
[3:25:29.200 --> 3:25:33.840]  seven yeah and then uh i think it was last week the week before they had the kid for the uh free
[3:25:33.840 --> 3:25:39.280]  syrian army running around with the ak-47 throwing dynamite around and nobody seemed to care about
[3:25:39.280 --> 3:25:44.640]  that no no it's like it's like they're trying to everybody multiple personalities you have a
[3:25:44.640 --> 3:25:49.680]  personality that cares about violence and bad things but they but they trigger it when they want
[3:25:49.680 --> 3:25:55.520]  but then your other personality laughs at it it's like hey we killed a million iraqis over the last
[3:25:55.520 --> 3:26:00.000]  15 years is terrible and like shut up traitor well you know part of it might be that if you kill
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:05.280]  500 000 kids in iraq with your sanctions and you say it's worth it like madeline albright did
[3:26:05.280 --> 3:26:09.840]  people can't get their head around that but if you get them 26 kids and you show the parents and you
[3:26:09.840 --> 3:26:14.160]  show the faces and you do it over and over and over again now that's a tragedy you made me just
[3:26:14.160 --> 3:26:18.320]  think you ought to do a stand-up deal for the news tonight where you know like you point out her
[3:26:18.880 --> 3:26:26.080]  who was it on nbc going i think it was worth it 500 000 kids and and and she's admired when
[3:26:26.080 --> 3:26:30.240]  brazilian brazinski goes up on stage he's a rock star because he's killed so many people
[3:26:30.240 --> 3:26:35.840]  but what they admire is he did it by funding other groups he brags in his books i couldn't kill 30
[3:26:35.840 --> 3:26:42.560]  percent of the cambodians uh but i but i funded the groups to get it done and they're like oh that's
[3:26:42.560 --> 3:26:46.960]  really slick because then it's like english in um in pool or something you know it's like ooh
[3:26:48.160 --> 3:26:52.320]  they admire oh you're so manly it's like richard pearl known as the prince of darkness one time
[3:26:52.320 --> 3:26:56.000]  was in the new york times but they were saying how cool it was he walked up to a bunch of women
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:27:00.960]  good-looking women at a party they got always like 400 pounds you know giant black circles around his
[3:27:00.960 --> 3:27:06.160]  eyes we not do too but the point is he walks up and goes i order strikes i kill people and even
[3:27:06.160 --> 3:27:11.680]  these evil women saw nothing to order were turned off by the fact it's not cool to go i kill people
[3:27:11.680 --> 3:27:15.760]  and that guy couldn't kill anybody you know with his bare hands of his life dependent on it right
[3:27:15.760 --> 3:27:20.800]  i mean it's just a big fat wimp thinking killing people's cool and then we got his republican
[3:27:20.800 --> 3:27:27.520]  counterpart uh kissinger right yeah the counterpart to brazinski and and wiki leaks had a document
[3:27:27.520 --> 3:27:31.760]  leak this week that said the illegal we do immediately the unconstitutional takes a little
[3:27:31.760 --> 3:27:35.760]  longer that's why they're dragging this thing out they know it's unconstitutional and it is
[3:27:35.760 --> 3:27:40.560]  this register and plus when they change the original laws it wrecks societies i mean we're
[3:27:40.560 --> 3:27:44.640]  going to become like mexico or north korea very quickly they get rid of this nothing's going to
[3:27:44.640 --> 3:27:49.680]  work anymore yeah i don't think they realize that though yeah i mean you got so many people there
[3:27:49.680 --> 3:27:54.320]  they're going off emotion instead of common sense well sure the grassroots morons don't
[3:27:54.320 --> 3:27:57.600]  but the technocrats do they're all getting offshore islands with private security details
[3:27:58.560 --> 3:28:03.040]  i mean they're this is how you destroy civilization tyrants destroy civilization
[3:28:03.600 --> 3:28:10.080]  roam fell from within and it's just they have no vision i even if any people are out of control
[3:28:10.080 --> 3:28:14.240]  alex in illinois last call we have time for apologize to the loaded phones alex you're on
[3:28:14.240 --> 3:28:21.120]  the air take us out all right you can hear me yes sir okay hello mr jones and friends this is alex
[3:28:21.120 --> 3:28:28.000]  from shy rack transform and roll out sorry it's all good i spoke to you regarding the bottom of
[3:28:28.000 --> 3:28:32.320]  the rabbit hole and you gave a very eloquent passionate response yeah that's on prison
[3:28:32.320 --> 3:28:36.720]  planet dot tv if you want to see it again yeah i saw that under the uh ranch the ranch but i think
[3:28:36.720 --> 3:28:41.280]  the rabbit hole is akin to the piss when you look at the bottom of the piss or the rabbit hole you
[3:28:41.280 --> 3:28:47.520]  see yourself reflected and with the modernized genocide of the individual and the motives behind
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:53.760]  these banks their banksters and new world order members i think we must look to the problems within
[3:28:53.760 --> 3:28:59.600]  to solve the problems outside primarily when is enough enough is it ever going to be enough
[3:28:59.600 --> 3:29:05.360]  and what sins of human beings are causing this rot in the apple now you're a great caller uh
