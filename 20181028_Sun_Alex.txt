[00:00.000 --> 00:19.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is obviously a very important live global Sunday transmission.
[00:19.320 --> 00:27.080]  The last three quarters of the broadcast will be live, but I am taping this right now with
[00:27.080 --> 00:31.080]  Andrew Torba, because he's got to go back into meetings with the FBI and the Justice
[00:31.080 --> 00:32.080]  Department.
[00:32.080 --> 00:34.760]  So again, this is a live Sunday show, but this is taped.
[00:34.760 --> 00:36.600]  I'll be live in studio in 30 minutes.
[00:36.600 --> 00:41.720]  Andrew Torba is the head of GAB, the only independent free speech major social network
[00:41.720 --> 00:43.440]  out there that's gotten any traction.
[00:43.440 --> 00:46.520]  There's some other groups coming online, we're very supportive of everybody.
[00:46.520 --> 00:52.000]  I think Andrew Torba is a good guy, he's free speech, and you saw the terrible events in
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.200]  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania yesterday that are immediately being blamed on the First Amendment.
[00:56.200 --> 01:01.040]  I'm being blamed, Donald Trump's mainly being blamed, and they're trying to now totally
[01:01.040 --> 01:05.480]  no platform GAB.com.
[01:05.480 --> 01:12.360]  So very powerful interview that I just taped with him that we're going to air on the other
[01:12.360 --> 01:20.120]  side of this quick break, show that the person that's actually been accused, the person that's
[01:20.120 --> 01:24.440]  being lied about, the person that they're saying is guilty for all this, gets to speak
[01:24.440 --> 01:26.760]  up for himself.
[01:26.760 --> 01:27.840]  Think about that.
[01:27.840 --> 01:32.040]  When they do platform me and then lie and say that I'm calling for violence against
[01:32.040 --> 01:35.560]  the media, or when they say that Trump says all Mexicans are criminals, they never show
[01:35.560 --> 01:36.560]  the club.
[01:36.560 --> 01:41.040]  And then they say, oh, Andrew Torba and GAB allowed this Nazi on there to plan all this
[01:41.040 --> 01:42.040]  and do all this.
[01:42.040 --> 01:44.160]  None of that's on the account.
[01:44.160 --> 01:45.160]  We have copies of it.
[01:45.160 --> 01:50.640]  It's been since taken down, and the FBI has it, but he didn't make any threats on there.
[01:50.640 --> 01:55.160]  He said four minutes before he went in, I'm going in, going into what, confront people,
[01:55.160 --> 01:56.160]  going into...
[01:56.160 --> 01:59.400]  We're not even clear if the police would have known about that, if they would have responded
[01:59.400 --> 02:00.800]  to the term, I'm going in.
[02:00.800 --> 02:02.920]  Maybe they would have, but there's always been evil.
[02:02.920 --> 02:04.160]  There's always been murders in the world.
[02:04.160 --> 02:05.160]  There's always been bad things.
[02:05.160 --> 02:07.480]  There's suicide bombings every day in the Middle East.
[02:07.480 --> 02:09.480]  They don't have free speech over there.
[02:09.480 --> 02:12.680]  They don't have right to keep their arms in most countries over there, and they're much
[02:12.680 --> 02:14.760]  more violent, much more out of control than we are.
[02:14.760 --> 02:19.760]  Look at Mexico, highest crime rate in the world, 200,000 dead just the last few years
[02:19.760 --> 02:22.720]  in civilians in Mexico.
[02:22.720 --> 02:24.280]  No free speech, really.
[02:24.280 --> 02:26.280]  No second amendment.
[02:26.280 --> 02:29.600]  They've got a police state in place, and the police state makes them not safe.
[02:29.600 --> 02:33.920]  And so you've got national media criticizing Trump and others saying there should have
[02:33.920 --> 02:36.120]  been folks armed inside the synagogue.
[02:36.120 --> 02:37.120]  No kidding.
[02:37.120 --> 02:39.520]  A church, a synagogue, absolutely.
[02:39.520 --> 02:43.800]  As for the false conspiracy theory, it really is a ridiculous conspiracy theory, that there
[02:43.800 --> 02:51.560]  was a star of debut on one of the vehicles, flatbacks, and Mexican plates driving in the
[02:51.560 --> 02:56.000]  highway up to the U.S. from the alien caravan.
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.640]  That symbol is all over sheriff's badges.
[02:58.640 --> 03:00.920]  It's seen as good luck in Latin America.
[03:00.920 --> 03:02.800]  It's a multi-thousand-year-old symbol.
[03:02.800 --> 03:06.480]  And so this guy began to think because this group was involved bringing refugees in, but
[03:06.480 --> 03:08.160]  somehow they were involved.
[03:08.160 --> 03:13.880]  Because every major church in this country, via the Rockefeller Foundation, the World
[03:13.880 --> 03:18.000]  Council of Churches, the National Council of Churches, has been ecumenicalized and turned
[03:18.000 --> 03:19.000]  into leftist.
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.520]  Whether it's the First Methodist in Austin or Catholic Charities, they're all involved
[03:24.520 --> 03:29.280]  with the U.N., bringing in the illegal aliens and the rest of it.
[03:29.280 --> 03:30.480]  And it's a big problem.
[03:30.480 --> 03:35.000]  But it's not like a bunch of evil, sinister people rubbing their hands together.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.320]  They've been manipulated as Christians and as conservative Jews and others to think that
[03:39.320 --> 03:43.520]  it's their job to bring in all these third-world populations, having their heart-strunks played.
[03:43.520 --> 03:46.080]  Then they're turned into socialist leftist voters once they get here.
[03:46.080 --> 03:48.040]  So that's the reality of what happened there.
[03:48.040 --> 03:49.920]  It's very, very tragic.
[03:49.920 --> 03:54.800]  We're going to break it all down on the other side, but this is a world exclusive.
[03:54.800 --> 03:59.800]  And they don't want him to be able to respond and speak for himself and point out what really
[03:59.800 --> 04:04.080]  happened and what the FBI told him and what the investigation is showing and what was
[04:04.080 --> 04:06.400]  really said there on the site.
[04:06.400 --> 04:10.480]  They want to misrepresent, like he's not even a person, and then dehumanize everyone's
[04:10.480 --> 04:11.840]  free speech.
[04:11.840 --> 04:12.840]  That's what's going on here.
[04:12.840 --> 04:17.760]  So we're going to cover this all today, but the only way we get past the censors is for
[04:17.760 --> 04:20.720]  you to text message out the link to infowars.com.
[04:20.720 --> 04:25.160]  And text message out the link to the live feed on the front page to everybody you know.
[04:25.160 --> 04:29.320]  And to tell folks about local stations you're listening to or watching.
[04:29.320 --> 04:33.600]  That's the power of word of mouth, and that's the power that the globalists think by censoring
[04:33.600 --> 04:37.680]  social media they're going to shut down, but they cannot stop you nine days out from the
[04:37.680 --> 04:41.400]  election to get more involved and more focused than ever.
[04:41.400 --> 04:45.040]  So please, however you do it, tell folks to tune in right now to this world exclusive
[04:45.040 --> 04:48.760]  on the other side at infowars.com forward slash show.
[04:48.760 --> 04:49.760]  Stay with us.
[04:49.760 --> 04:50.760]  We'll be right back.
[04:50.760 --> 05:00.720]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[05:00.720 --> 05:06.040]  Folks could not describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[05:06.040 --> 05:10.280]  Infowars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[05:10.280 --> 05:14.440]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[05:14.440 --> 05:16.440]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[05:16.440 --> 05:19.800]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[05:19.800 --> 05:22.000]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[05:22.000 --> 05:24.760]  So we've already had incredible success.
[05:24.760 --> 05:29.680]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[05:29.680 --> 05:34.480]  why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, if you spread
[05:34.480 --> 05:40.200]  the word about our articles and videos, infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against
[05:40.200 --> 05:42.000]  these brutal scumbags.
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.000]  We'll win.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.600]  We have huge sales at infowars.com right now.
[05:45.600 --> 05:49.680]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite
[05:49.680 --> 05:53.240]  the fact of trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[05:53.240 --> 05:56.920]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globalist may win.
[05:56.920 --> 06:03.160]  This is InfoWars, Marcus Howard, with your support, I'm counting on you.
[06:03.160 --> 06:07.920]  It is Sunday, October 28th, 2018, I'm Alex Jones from Austin, Texas.
[06:07.920 --> 06:11.040]  We have a global exclusive right now.
[06:11.040 --> 06:17.360]  We have Andrew Torbott, the CEO and founder of the only independent pro-free speech libertarian
[06:17.360 --> 06:20.520]  site in the world that allows social media activity.
[06:20.520 --> 06:21.520]  And that's GAAP.
[06:21.520 --> 06:24.280]  Speak freely is their motto.
[06:24.280 --> 06:26.480]  Now we all know about the tragic events in Pittsburgh.
[06:26.480 --> 06:32.120]  11 innocent people were gunned down by a psychotic anti-Semite.
[06:32.120 --> 06:37.640]  But now Andrew Torbott, who set up GAAP so that everyone would have free speech, is being
[06:37.640 --> 06:43.480]  de-platformed, losing his server provider, losing PayPal, they're trying to take him
[06:43.480 --> 06:48.720]  offline and see an end is spending more time demonizing Mr. Torbott and the First Amendment
[06:48.720 --> 06:51.160]  than they are talking about the 11 that are dead.
[06:51.160 --> 06:52.640]  And why?
[06:52.640 --> 06:57.840]  Because four minutes before this monster went in, he said to the world that he was going
[06:57.840 --> 07:03.360]  in as if that means Mr. Torbott is bad, if somebody on a message board posted that.
[07:03.360 --> 07:04.360]  It's incredible.
[07:04.360 --> 07:07.080]  So he just got off the phone with the FBI, I think we're late doing the interview because
[07:07.080 --> 07:11.040]  he just got off the phone with the FBI, and I wanted you to be able to hear from him to
[07:11.040 --> 07:16.240]  speak for himself to the world about what GAAP really stands for and what's really
[07:16.240 --> 07:17.240]  happening.
[07:17.240 --> 07:20.920]  And then we're going to look at Twitter and Facebook and others who allow major professors
[07:20.920 --> 07:25.560]  to organize huge antifa groups that call for the murder of the president and the vice
[07:25.560 --> 07:29.280]  president who call for harassing people in the streets and for physical attacks.
[07:29.280 --> 07:33.320]  They're allowed to still operate officially on Twitter.
[07:33.320 --> 07:36.360]  Mr. Torbott has done nothing like this.
[07:36.360 --> 07:41.040]  So we've been de-platformed, he's being de-platformed, big media with big tech wants to silence their
[07:41.040 --> 07:42.040]  competition.
[07:42.040 --> 07:44.640]  They always say go build your own thing and then they come after it.
[07:44.640 --> 07:47.440]  So Mr. Torbott, thank you for giving us the time this Sunday.
[07:47.440 --> 07:49.640]  You've got the floor, please break down what's happened.
[07:49.640 --> 07:52.040]  Well, thank you for having me, Alex.
[07:52.040 --> 07:57.600]  First, I just want to say I'm heartbroken and disgusted by this awful attack, this awful
[07:57.600 --> 07:59.360]  showcase of violence.
[07:59.360 --> 08:03.440]  I've been praying, my family's been praying, our community has been praying for these victims
[08:03.440 --> 08:08.480]  and for their families and for their friends and for the community in Pittsburgh.
[08:08.480 --> 08:13.040]  With that said, we've also been working with the Department of Justice and with the FBI
[08:13.040 --> 08:14.040]  very closely.
[08:14.040 --> 08:15.880]  We've been fully cooperative.
[08:15.880 --> 08:20.280]  As soon as we discovered that this user was on our site, we immediately archived all the
[08:20.280 --> 08:24.760]  data and proactively reached out to the FBI before they even contacted us.
[08:24.760 --> 08:28.480]  We didn't require them to give us a subpoena or a search warrant or anything.
[08:28.480 --> 08:33.640]  We proactively gave them this data so that they could work on their investigation immediately.
[08:33.640 --> 08:37.800]  GAB stands for individual liberty and for free expression for all people.
[08:37.800 --> 08:42.520]  We have hundreds of thousands of users from all around the world, from all different backgrounds,
[08:42.520 --> 08:47.120]  races, religions, beliefs that express themselves on our site.
[08:47.120 --> 08:53.480]  I believe fundamentally that the answer to bad speech is always going to be more speech.
[08:53.480 --> 08:58.760]  In this case, the Department of Justice and the FBI now have concrete evidence for a motive
[08:58.760 --> 09:04.440]  that they can now use in a case to seek justice against this awful monster.
[09:04.440 --> 09:09.080]  We have always welcomed everybody and we will continue to fight for free speech on the Internet
[09:09.080 --> 09:14.200]  in the face of tyranny from the mainstream media smear attacks, because for some reason,
[09:14.200 --> 09:19.480]  instead of focusing on the victims, instead of focusing on what happened, instead of focusing
[09:19.480 --> 09:24.760]  on this monster, they're focusing on GAB as a scapegoat.
[09:24.760 --> 09:25.880]  GAB did not kill anybody.
[09:25.880 --> 09:30.400]  No social media post has ever killed anybody.
[09:30.400 --> 09:35.400]  The only person that is responsible here is the individual, and I just think it's disgusting
[09:35.400 --> 09:37.320]  that GAB is now being attacked.
[09:37.320 --> 09:42.840]  I am being smeared, my face is being put up next to this guy, as if I'm the terrorist.
[09:42.840 --> 09:47.960]  We're receiving death threats and enough hate on the Internet ourselves.
[09:47.960 --> 09:51.720]  We wish nothing but good for the world.
[09:51.720 --> 09:54.280]  We welcome all people, we always have.
[09:54.280 --> 09:57.800]  And we are all about individual liberty and free expression.
[09:57.800 --> 10:02.760]  We are fighting for the very things that those in the armed service fight to defend every
[10:02.760 --> 10:03.960]  day as well.
[10:03.960 --> 10:08.280]  I think that if people can give their lives to defend these freedoms and these liberties
[10:08.280 --> 10:12.160]  that we cherish, I think that we'll be able to stand tall and take these attacks from
[10:12.160 --> 10:17.280]  the mainstream media, this onslaught, and this coordinated collusion from Silicon Valley
[10:17.280 --> 10:19.880]  to no platform us from the Internet.
[10:19.880 --> 10:21.240]  GAB is not going anywhere.
[10:21.240 --> 10:22.680]  We are not afraid.
[10:22.680 --> 10:25.000]  We will not bow down to the mainstream media.
[10:25.000 --> 10:26.360]  We will not cower.
[10:26.360 --> 10:30.920]  We are going to continue to fight, and the power of the people will propel us.
[10:30.920 --> 10:34.200]  We will continue to build whatever it takes.
[10:34.200 --> 10:35.200]  We are going to stay online.
[10:35.200 --> 10:36.560]  I don't care how long it takes.
[10:36.560 --> 10:38.200]  I don't care what it takes.
[10:38.200 --> 10:42.200]  We're going to provide a place where people can speak freely under the protections of
[10:42.200 --> 10:46.360]  the First Amendment of the United States without the tyranny of big tech, without the tyranny
[10:46.360 --> 10:52.480]  of the media deciding what is real news and what isn't and who can speak and who cannot.
[10:52.480 --> 10:54.200]  I think that's very admirable.
[10:54.200 --> 10:58.880]  And again, I've been through this deplatforming and no platforming process where they lie about
[10:58.880 --> 11:03.800]  what you've said and done, then they take your platforms away so you can't then respond
[11:03.800 --> 11:08.160]  when they all gang up on you and say you're a white supremacist or Trump hates all Mexicans
[11:08.160 --> 11:11.760]  or saying you're a nationalist means you're a Nazi.
[11:11.760 --> 11:16.960]  And then that actually stirs up the real Nazis and people, and then the media basically
[11:16.960 --> 11:18.600]  then projects them onto us.
[11:18.600 --> 11:23.000]  But this would be like if this guy had called 911 and said, I'm going in, or if this guy
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.560]  had put on a message board, I'm going in, or this guy would have written on the side
[11:26.560 --> 11:31.720]  of a wall, I'm going in and then saying that the wall is to blame or the telephone is to
[11:31.720 --> 11:32.720]  blame.
[11:32.720 --> 11:38.640]  When you guys are basically a glorified message board where people can send messages to people
[11:38.640 --> 11:40.320]  that have signed up to get their messages.
[11:40.320 --> 11:46.240]  I mean, these are digital bulletin boards where you sign up and subscribe for a text
[11:46.240 --> 11:50.520]  podcast basically is what I would call it, you're the tech guy, and the idea that they're
[11:50.520 --> 11:55.280]  breathlessly on every channel, gab, gab, gab, it needs to be shut down, it needs to be shut
[11:55.280 --> 11:56.280]  down.
[11:56.280 --> 11:58.720]  And then Alex Jones, then they come for gab.
[11:58.720 --> 12:03.840]  And then they lie about who you are and they're giving almost no coverage of these poor people
[12:03.840 --> 12:06.560]  that were cold bloodedly murdered.
[12:06.560 --> 12:08.360]  That's one issue I want you to cover.
[12:08.360 --> 12:13.240]  And then secondarily, we've got Lewis Farrakhan with all of his followers on Twitter and everywhere
[12:13.240 --> 12:17.320]  else saying that Jews are bloodsuckers and Jews are termites and he has the right to
[12:17.320 --> 12:18.320]  say that.
[12:18.320 --> 12:19.320]  I don't agree with it.
[12:19.320 --> 12:22.760]  I've interviewed Lewis Farrakhan, but he hasn't been taken off and we're not calling
[12:22.760 --> 12:23.760]  for that.
[12:23.760 --> 12:28.960]  But the idea, I am calling for this New York professor and others that call for the murder
[12:28.960 --> 12:35.240]  of Pence, the vice president, the murder of police officers, the murder of all these people.
[12:35.240 --> 12:39.720]  And he's the guy directing people that are harassing Ted Cruz and others in restaurants
[12:39.720 --> 12:42.960]  and he gets promoted by Twitter.
[12:42.960 --> 12:44.560]  He doesn't get in trouble.
[12:44.560 --> 12:46.360]  That's calling for violence.
[12:46.360 --> 12:51.360]  Imagine if you let somebody say, let's murder people, let's kill people like this professor,
[12:51.360 --> 12:56.360]  founder of a group that harassed Ted Cruz, tweeted about dead cops assaulting Mike Pence.
[12:56.360 --> 13:00.240]  Here's his own personal Twitter showing people hung up in bed saying we should be done to
[13:00.240 --> 13:03.720]  the Republicans and it just goes on from there.
[13:03.720 --> 13:11.160]  So what in the world is happening here with the controlled Silicon Valley actually promoting
[13:11.160 --> 13:14.840]  violence and letting it go forward and then projecting it onto you?
[13:14.840 --> 13:21.160]  Well, Alex, every single day we see thousands of tweets calling for people to kill the president
[13:21.160 --> 13:22.640]  of the United States.
[13:22.640 --> 13:23.640]  And this is allowed.
[13:23.640 --> 13:27.160]  We see live streamed murders on Facebook.
[13:27.160 --> 13:32.100]  We see criminal activity in very high volumes across all of the mainstream social media
[13:32.100 --> 13:37.240]  platforms including ISIS terror cells and pedophiles preying on children.
[13:37.240 --> 13:39.920]  And nobody is calling for Facebook to be shut down.
[13:39.920 --> 13:42.000]  Nobody is calling for Twitter to be shut down.
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.680]  So to take the disgusting actions of one man and shut down an entire platform, we have
[13:48.680 --> 13:51.360]  nine million people that visit our site every month.
[13:51.360 --> 13:53.720]  We have 800,000 users from around the world.
[13:53.720 --> 14:00.160]  And to take the actions of one man and try to effectively remove us from the entire internet,
[14:00.160 --> 14:05.680]  demonize me and make me out to be some form of terrorist for allowing free expression
[14:05.680 --> 14:10.000]  and individual liberty online for all people, something that has always existed since the
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.160]  internet's inception is absurd.
[14:13.160 --> 14:16.720]  And I think that people need to start talking about these things because if it could happen
[14:16.720 --> 14:20.920]  to us, if it can happen to Alex Jones and Infowars, don't think it can't happen to you.
[14:20.920 --> 14:25.840]  Don't think they can't scrub your identity and every mention and every profile you have
[14:25.840 --> 14:28.600]  off the internet if they don't like what you're doing.
[14:28.600 --> 14:35.080]  And fundamentally, I believe that having more freedom, having more speech is always the
[14:35.080 --> 14:37.040]  answer to bad speech.
[14:37.040 --> 14:39.520]  Free speech is crucial to the prevention of violence.
[14:39.520 --> 14:46.200]  If people cannot express themselves with words and we push these people into the shadows,
[14:46.200 --> 14:49.080]  and they're going to express themselves through violence and nobody wants that.
[14:49.080 --> 14:54.000]  I mean, just two, three years ago, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, let the Nazis have their
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.280]  web pages and they let the black supremacists and the Hispanic supremacists have their websites
[14:58.280 --> 14:59.280]  as well.
[14:59.280 --> 15:00.280]  And they're paying.
[15:00.280 --> 15:01.280]  As long as you didn't call for violence, they could be there.
[15:01.280 --> 15:02.280]  I didn't agree with it.
[15:02.280 --> 15:04.280]  A lot of them attacked me for some reason.
[15:04.280 --> 15:10.960]  I'm a big target of the Nazis and what Hillary calls the alt-right that she calls me alt-right.
[15:10.960 --> 15:13.480]  And that's well known.
[15:13.480 --> 15:17.240]  And now they take those people off so that you can't go see that they're attacking me
[15:17.240 --> 15:21.240]  or attacking Donald Trump like this monster did, saying he was a globalist, the opposite
[15:21.240 --> 15:22.240]  of what he is.
[15:22.240 --> 15:24.160]  Or because he's friends with Israel, he's bad.
[15:24.160 --> 15:29.360]  But instead, you get blamed, I get blamed, Trump gets blamed for being Nazis when we're
[15:29.360 --> 15:30.440]  actually the opposite.
[15:30.440 --> 15:31.440]  It's just crazy.
[15:31.440 --> 15:35.560]  So just a few years ago, all these other platforms still allowed some free speech.
[15:35.560 --> 15:39.280]  Now they've gotten rid of it and they're acting like we are every form of speech that's on
[15:39.280 --> 15:40.280]  a message board.
[15:40.280 --> 15:43.240]  I mean, we have comments on enforcers and the news will say, look, somebody said something
[15:43.240 --> 15:44.240]  anti-Semitic here.
[15:44.240 --> 15:46.840]  Well, it's a comment section.
[15:46.840 --> 15:52.520]  Again, they are by extension trying to end the platforms where the debates can happen.
[15:52.520 --> 15:56.120]  We're going to go to break, come back with a few more minutes with Mr. Torb.
[15:56.120 --> 15:58.200]  I don't know how much you can get into the FBI investigation.
[15:58.200 --> 15:59.680]  He just got off the phone with them like 20.
[15:59.680 --> 16:05.760]  Stress is a natural part of life where family, friends and everyday accidents can put a lot
[16:05.760 --> 16:08.240]  of strain on the body and your mood.
[16:08.240 --> 16:13.520]  Don't let life weigh you down, HAPPYS is a powerful mood and stress support formula

[16:53.240 --> 16:59.080]  and pressure today with HAPPYS from InfowarsStore.com.
[16:59.080 --> 17:04.400]  X2, we were selling it for about three years and then they found out how big it was and
[17:04.400 --> 17:07.760]  how much we were buying and they said, oh, we want more money, more money and oh, this
[17:07.760 --> 17:08.760]  and that.
[17:08.760 --> 17:14.120]  And so I've broken my contract and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient
[17:14.120 --> 17:15.120]  that goes in next to it.
[17:15.120 --> 17:19.240]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot
[17:19.240 --> 17:23.200]  plate, it gasses like I dream of genie and it's purple gas.
[17:23.200 --> 17:26.760]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[17:26.760 --> 17:32.320]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it,
[17:32.320 --> 17:36.440]  ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm
[17:36.440 --> 17:37.440]  done, I'm breaking the contract.
[17:37.440 --> 17:42.160]  Well, I broke the contract last week and so this is potentially the last run.
[17:42.160 --> 17:43.880]  In fact, right now it is the last run.
[17:43.880 --> 17:48.520]  There's a viable shield X2 and we've got a good supply of it, it'll be gone in a couple
[17:48.520 --> 17:49.520]  of months.
[17:49.520 --> 17:51.520]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfowarsStore.com.
[17:51.520 --> 17:55.560]  If you have experienced it, don't have to grade it as, I suggest you stock up on it.
[17:55.560 --> 18:00.000]  It's available right now for a limited time, InfowarsStore.com right now.
[18:00.000 --> 18:05.240]  InfowarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:05.240 --> 18:10.560]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:10.560 --> 18:17.280]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[18:17.280 --> 18:23.160]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.160 --> 18:26.480]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.480 --> 18:31.400]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[18:31.400 --> 18:36.460]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.460 --> 18:37.960]  symptoms.
[18:37.960 --> 18:41.280]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.280 --> 18:46.040]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.040 --> 18:51.840]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:51.840 --> 18:54.560]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.560 --> 19:00.920]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[20:03.360 --> 20:06.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:11.680 --> 20:16.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[20:16.680 --> 20:21.160]  And we are back on this Sunday worldwide broadcast.
[20:21.160 --> 20:22.480]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[20:22.480 --> 20:25.880]  We have the founder of GAB and the CEO, Andrew Torba on.
[20:25.880 --> 20:30.960]  I've been having him on for two years since he launched the beta test of GAB and then
[20:30.960 --> 20:31.960]  I have him on routinely.
[20:31.960 --> 20:35.000]  I'd call him a libertarian, a free spirit, a Christian guy.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.680]  I wouldn't even call him extreme right wing.
[20:37.680 --> 20:44.280]  But the point is he created an independent system and all the other big tech companies
[20:44.280 --> 20:49.560]  have ganged up on him to shut him down in the last year because they don't want any
[20:49.560 --> 20:50.560]  competition.
[20:50.560 --> 20:52.080]  And now they've hung around his neck.
[20:52.080 --> 20:56.600]  Top news story in the country is not these poor dead people or not how this guy was a
[20:56.600 --> 20:59.760]  Trump hater, this monster, I'm not even saying his name, but we'll put him on screen just
[20:59.760 --> 21:00.760]  to document it.
[21:00.760 --> 21:03.440]  It's all about Andrew Torba and it's all about Infowars.
[21:03.440 --> 21:08.000]  It's a sub-level of like, Jones has been de-platformed because he's so evil and now we need to totally
[21:08.000 --> 21:09.320]  get rid of Mr. Torba.
[21:09.320 --> 21:13.160]  Let's take his credit cards away, let's take his PayPal away, let's take his servers away.
[21:13.160 --> 21:18.280]  To recap, again, what you've gone through with the persecution and now they've seized
[21:18.280 --> 21:23.680]  upon this that he said four minutes before he went into this horrible deed or deeds that
[21:23.680 --> 21:27.480]  I'm going in and then if you can, what the FBI has said to you?
[21:27.480 --> 21:28.640]  Sure, Alex.
[21:28.640 --> 21:34.240]  So for the past 24 hours, I've been working very closely with both the FBI and the Department
[21:34.240 --> 21:35.240]  of Justice.
[21:35.240 --> 21:39.520]  We've been fully cooperative in doing everything that we possibly can to help out with this
[21:39.520 --> 21:43.000]  investigation to see to it that justice is served.
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.160]  In the midst of doing this, in the midst of working directly with law enforcement and
[21:47.160 --> 21:53.880]  cooperating fully, we've been no-platformed by our hosting provider, by multiple payment
[21:53.880 --> 21:59.200]  processors, so we're also now handling that and trying to literally stay online.
[21:59.200 --> 22:03.600]  And Alex, the truth is, I didn't want to be the center of attention here.
[22:03.600 --> 22:06.720]  We don't want this to be about Gab, it's not about Gab.
[22:06.720 --> 22:11.840]  Eleven innocent people died for the acts of a terrorist and the media is focusing on
[22:11.840 --> 22:13.320]  me and focusing on Gab.
[22:13.320 --> 22:14.320]  This is disgusting.
[22:14.320 --> 22:18.080]  Now, my heart goes out to the families, my heart goes out to the victims, the friends
[22:18.080 --> 22:19.960]  of the victims, the whole community.
[22:19.960 --> 22:23.820]  This is just disgusting and heartbreaking to me, and I think that the media should be
[22:23.820 --> 22:24.820]  ashamed.
[22:24.820 --> 22:28.920]  They should be totally ashamed, and what they're trying to do now is a coordinated effort to
[22:28.920 --> 22:33.680]  demonize me, to demonize Gab, and to demonize free expression on the Internet.
[22:33.680 --> 22:38.320]  They're going to use this one person, the actions of this one person to now no-platform
[22:38.320 --> 22:42.360]  our entire website, our entire community of hundreds of thousands of people from around
[22:42.360 --> 22:43.560]  the world.
[22:43.560 --> 22:46.640]  It's disgusting and it's despicable, and we're not going to stand for it.
[22:46.640 --> 22:50.200]  We're going to continue to fight, we're going to continue to build, and Gab is not going
[22:50.200 --> 22:51.200]  anywhere.
[22:51.200 --> 22:52.800]  We are not afraid of you.
[22:52.800 --> 22:57.360]  We're going to continue doing what we are doing to defend free expression and individual
[22:57.360 --> 23:00.000]  liberty for all people.
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.440]  I follow your work.
[23:01.440 --> 23:04.520]  We have a popular page on your great platform.
[23:04.520 --> 23:09.040]  It allows us to tweet out to people, that's basically what your system does, and it gives
[23:09.040 --> 23:13.440]  you your own little message board, to be able to communicate, and it's a very, very diverse
[23:13.440 --> 23:14.440]  site.
[23:14.440 --> 23:16.800]  First, they try to get rid of you because people would post porn on there.
[23:16.800 --> 23:18.520]  Well, Twitter and Facebook do that too.
[23:18.520 --> 23:21.320]  You don't see their banks trying to shut them down.
[23:21.320 --> 23:23.360]  You don't see the feds trying to shut them down.
[23:23.360 --> 23:27.600]  You don't see PayPal going away from them.
[23:27.600 --> 23:30.240]  Speaking about Lewis Farrakhan, and I'm not calling for him to be censored, as long as
[23:30.240 --> 23:32.240]  he doesn't call for violence.
[23:32.240 --> 23:33.240]  I'm interviewing Lewis Farrakhan.
[23:33.240 --> 23:35.160]  He has some interesting points he makes.
[23:35.160 --> 23:36.160]  I agree with what he has to say.
[23:36.160 --> 23:38.000]  I disagree with some of the other things.
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.920]  But at the same time, I'm not saying remove him.
[23:39.920 --> 23:44.760]  But if they're going to blame you for what somebody does, that you've already removed,
[23:44.760 --> 23:45.760]  how do they do this?
[23:45.760 --> 23:50.480]  And then I talk about the founder of the group, Horasic Senator Kruse, at dinner is Dead Cops
[23:50.480 --> 23:54.440]  Tweet Professor, and I've got a bunch of reports on it right here.
[23:54.440 --> 23:59.520]  All the horrible things he calls for, specific people to be killed, and this professor doesn't
[23:59.520 --> 24:00.520]  get any trouble.
[24:00.520 --> 24:03.280]  Mike Isaacson, and he's par for the course.
[24:03.280 --> 24:09.160]  So it's so hypocritical when they're on national news saying Trump shut the climate of hate
[24:09.160 --> 24:13.160]  and all of this, when Trump has been loving compared to the corporate media, saying he's
[24:13.160 --> 24:21.600]  a Nazi, saying he's a white supremacist, saying he's sending coded white supremacist messages.
[24:21.600 --> 24:26.000]  Former GOP strategist reveals the covert message Trump sent to neo-Nazis, and then you read
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.080]  the article saying nationalists that we deserve a nation and we shouldn't have one-sided trade
[24:31.080 --> 24:32.080]  deals is Nazi.
[24:32.080 --> 24:38.600]  I mean, they're calling everybody Nazis and hyping all this up and hyping up violence
[24:38.600 --> 24:44.320]  and that Barron should be kidnapped and tortured Hollywood stars are saying that on Twitter.
[24:44.320 --> 24:49.080]  It's so, the New York Times' articles fantasizing about Trump's death, and then they sit back
[24:49.080 --> 24:50.720]  and say, I'm bad and you're bad.
[24:50.720 --> 24:54.520]  I mean, we're in this elite group to be banned first, but as you said, it's because we're
[24:54.520 --> 24:56.440]  popular and have good platforms.
[24:56.440 --> 24:59.720]  If they get rid of you, if they're able to shut you down, they're going to take everybody
[24:59.720 --> 25:00.720]  down.
[25:00.720 --> 25:02.680]  Absolutely, Alex.
[25:02.680 --> 25:06.400]  If we weren't threats, then they wouldn't be trying to know platform us, right?
[25:06.400 --> 25:12.080]  GAB is the single most censored social media platform ever in existence.
[25:12.080 --> 25:13.280]  And there's a reason for that.
[25:13.280 --> 25:16.280]  Because we're a threat to the mainstream big tech platforms.
[25:16.280 --> 25:20.800]  We're a threat to the mainstream media who controls the narrative through those platforms,
[25:20.800 --> 25:23.640]  through their partnerships and connections in those platforms.
[25:23.640 --> 25:25.960]  And if we weren't a threat, then they wouldn't be attacking us.
[25:25.960 --> 25:27.080]  And this is just disgusting.
[25:27.080 --> 25:30.520]  We know who committed this atrocity allegedly.
[25:30.520 --> 25:32.840]  They have someone in custody.
[25:32.840 --> 25:39.080]  They now have detailed evidence for a motive, thanks to GAB, thanks to the content that
[25:39.080 --> 25:43.720]  this disgusting individual was posting on GAB, and thanks to our cooperation with law enforcement
[25:43.720 --> 25:44.720]  agencies.
[25:44.720 --> 25:46.760]  So why are they pointing the finger at us?
[25:46.760 --> 25:48.560]  Why are they pointing the finger at me?
[25:48.560 --> 25:51.280]  Point the finger at the person who pulled the trigger.
[25:51.280 --> 25:53.880]  He's the only one who is responsible for the actions.
[25:53.880 --> 25:57.960]  Well, I mean, you can see all these other leftists that have engaged in violent acts
[25:57.960 --> 26:00.120]  as well, and they post stuff on Twitter and Facebook.
[26:00.120 --> 26:02.640]  I mean, it's again, like using a telephone or email.
[26:02.640 --> 26:07.440]  Let's say the person had Gmail, Google email, and they send an email saying, okay, I'm done.
[26:07.440 --> 26:08.440]  I'm going into the synagogue.
[26:08.440 --> 26:09.440]  I'm going to do it.
[26:09.440 --> 26:10.800]  Didn't say the specifics.
[26:10.800 --> 26:16.640]  But how is the email service to blank?
[26:16.640 --> 26:18.480]  Because we know Google reads the messages.
[26:18.480 --> 26:20.000]  How is it your liability?
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.920]  I mean, there are federal laws, international laws, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
[26:23.920 --> 26:27.520]  and other sections that protect third party sites.
[26:27.520 --> 26:33.240]  If I have a message board or I have a social network or I have something like gab.com,
[26:33.240 --> 26:36.800]  then I'm not guilty for what people do if they're committing crime.
[26:36.800 --> 26:40.680]  Then I have to, you know, take them off and give any subpoenaed information to the feds
[26:40.680 --> 26:43.160]  or local police, and we've complied with that ourselves.
[26:43.160 --> 26:47.800]  So the idea of prior constraint that you've got to go around and police everyone and control
[26:47.800 --> 26:50.720]  them is absolutely crazy.
[26:50.720 --> 26:51.720]  And now you're being persecuted.
[26:51.720 --> 26:54.200]  Well, Alex, here's the insane part.
[26:54.200 --> 26:58.640]  You know, he posted this post, I think it was four minutes before the shooting.
[26:58.640 --> 26:59.840]  And he said, I'm going in.
[26:59.840 --> 27:00.840]  What does I'm going in mean?
[27:00.840 --> 27:04.040]  It's not like he said, I'm going in to shoot up a synagogue.
[27:04.040 --> 27:07.640]  He could have meant I'm going in to the voting booth, you know, for all we know.
[27:07.640 --> 27:11.200]  What do people expect us to do in four minutes, right?
[27:11.200 --> 27:15.160]  With a post that is not a direct threat in any way that I could see.
[27:15.160 --> 27:18.640]  So I don't know what people expected us to do in that amount of time.
[27:18.640 --> 27:22.760]  And I don't know why people are placing the blame on us, a platform that welcomes everybody
[27:22.760 --> 27:25.920]  and it's about free expression and individual liberty.
[27:25.920 --> 27:27.320]  It just doesn't make any sense.
[27:27.320 --> 27:32.640]  We know we have an alleged person in custody.
[27:32.640 --> 27:33.640]  Point to him.
[27:33.640 --> 27:36.640]  He's the one who allegedly did it.
[27:36.640 --> 27:37.640]  That's right.
[27:37.640 --> 27:42.160]  And again, I'm going in back when I was on Twitter in places and we were going to go in
[27:42.160 --> 27:43.160]  and cover something.
[27:43.160 --> 27:44.160]  Right.
[27:44.160 --> 27:47.160]  I mean, I'd say I'm going in now to cover the event.
[27:47.160 --> 27:49.960]  We're going in and it's also a fun term to use.
[27:49.960 --> 27:51.400]  This guy was obviously deranged.
[27:51.400 --> 27:53.160]  I've seen copies of the messages.
[27:53.160 --> 27:57.400]  I didn't see anything there up to that point that said he was going to carry out violence.
[27:57.400 --> 28:01.720]  And again, law enforcement will tell you social media is great for them to actually catch
[28:01.720 --> 28:05.120]  a lot of people before they do stuff because they're out there talking about what they're
[28:05.120 --> 28:06.120]  going to do.
[28:06.120 --> 28:09.320]  And so I know you can't get into everything the FBI said, but you told me earlier today
[28:09.320 --> 28:12.040]  that they've actually been very thankful to you.
[28:12.040 --> 28:13.040]  Yes.
[28:13.040 --> 28:14.040]  Yeah.
[28:14.040 --> 28:16.840]  The FBI and the Department of Justice have been very thankful to us.
[28:16.840 --> 28:21.520]  They've been praising us for our direct cooperation, our speedy cooperation.
[28:21.520 --> 28:25.480]  I would on the phone with both of them and emailing back and forth, you know, for the
[28:25.480 --> 28:29.360]  past 24 hours, I didn't get much sleep last night and I'm happy to do so.
[28:29.360 --> 28:33.920]  If you're a terrorist, being on Gab is the last place you want to be because we are going
[28:33.920 --> 28:37.760]  to work directly with law enforcement immediately.
[28:37.760 --> 28:40.080]  So I, you know, this is the thing.
[28:40.080 --> 28:41.400]  We love law enforcement.
[28:41.400 --> 28:42.800]  We respect law enforcement.
[28:42.800 --> 28:46.280]  God bless everybody at the FBI and DOJ that is working on this case.
[28:46.280 --> 28:50.880]  And we pray that justice is served and we will do everything in our power, in our capacity
[28:50.880 --> 28:52.440]  to help them in this case.
[28:52.440 --> 28:55.160]  Well, look, I totally agree with that.
[28:55.160 --> 28:59.280]  And our hearts and prayers go out to those there in Pennsylvania, this is being used.
[28:59.280 --> 29:04.600]  They now know that Info Wars has the spirit, the program, the code to relaunch it all.
[29:04.600 --> 29:06.720]  And that's why they treat us like we're death.
[29:06.720 --> 29:10.400]  To George Soros and to Hillary Clinton, to Barack Obama and to Lord Rothschild.
[29:10.400 --> 29:13.560]  I'm the grim reaper come to their door.
[29:13.560 --> 29:16.760]  I'm death and they know it, I'm death of their system.
[29:16.760 --> 29:20.200]  Please don't forget that if you don't support this broadcast, we'll be shut down and we
[29:20.200 --> 29:22.400]  make it easy with the very best products.
[29:22.400 --> 29:26.760]  And we've had a 50% off sale, free shipping, the biggest sale in our history and it has
[29:26.760 --> 29:30.800]  got to end the next few days because we're selling out a lot of our best selling products
[29:30.800 --> 29:33.960]  and we are hurtling into the whole Christmas season.

[29:44.560 --> 29:45.560]  right now.
[29:45.560 --> 29:49.720]  You support the broadcast and that lets us stand against the enemy which infuriates them.
[29:49.720 --> 29:53.360]  You know how scared they were of all those live videos of 90% of the Trump supporters
[29:53.360 --> 29:55.200]  being huge Info Wars supporters.
[29:55.200 --> 29:56.320]  It scared them to death.
[29:56.320 --> 30:00.720]  It's why they want to extinguish us, but you won't let them.
[30:00.720 --> 30:04.520]  Please tell your neighbors, your friends, your family, your community, constantly this
[30:04.520 --> 30:05.720]  is the censored show.
[30:05.720 --> 30:07.120]  They want to shut it down.
[30:07.120 --> 30:08.520]  Don't let them do it.
[30:08.520 --> 30:10.680]  InfoWars.com or it's live show.
[30:10.680 --> 30:11.680]  We're in your hands.
[30:11.680 --> 30:16.200]  If you don't spread the word about Info Wars, if you don't spread the word about newswars.com,
[30:16.200 --> 30:19.960]  if you don't get the great Patriot t-shirts, all the beautiful designs, if you don't get
[30:19.960 --> 30:23.600]  the water filtration and air filtration, that's the best out there, very low prices.
[30:23.600 --> 30:25.760]  If you don't get the great supplements, we won't be here.
[30:25.760 --> 30:26.760]  It's up to you.
[30:26.760 --> 30:29.080]  And you've been responding, you've been supporting, so I want to thank you.
[30:29.080 --> 30:33.360]  But you're also getting really great products like X2, The Last Run of It, Secret 12, Amazing

[30:39.520 --> 30:44.680]  InfoWars.com and free shipping, but it's got to end by this weekend because so many
[30:44.680 --> 30:48.400]  of the great products are running low, like Knockout, The Great Sleep Aid, like Ultimate
[30:48.400 --> 30:52.360]  Bone Broth Formula, nobody can get it at that price, but you are the folks that have
[30:52.360 --> 30:53.360]  stood with us.
[30:53.360 --> 30:59.360]  So it's a 360 win-win at InfoWars.com or AAA-253-3139.
[30:59.360 --> 31:00.360]  Please take action.
[31:00.360 --> 31:04.960]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[31:04.960 --> 31:09.200]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[31:09.200 --> 31:13.360]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[31:13.360 --> 31:20.480]  lights every day, but thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfoWars.com, I still have that energy.
[31:20.480 --> 31:24.680]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[31:24.680 --> 31:28.840]  the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with
[31:28.840 --> 31:33.840]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[31:33.840 --> 31:41.040]  and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[31:41.040 --> 31:44.720]  So go to InfoWars.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.

[32:00.200 --> 32:07.560]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern
[32:07.560 --> 32:12.280]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[32:12.280 --> 32:17.600]  Faced off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've

[32:22.680 --> 32:23.680]  Blend Coffee.

[33:03.600 --> 33:22.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.280 --> 33:28.600]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:28.600 --> 33:34.760]  We're live folks, who's really violent?
[33:34.760 --> 33:35.760]  It's the left.
[33:35.760 --> 33:36.760]  You're a f***ing anti-American.
[33:36.760 --> 33:37.760]  I'm an anti-American.
[33:37.760 --> 33:38.760]  You're stupid, bastard.
[33:38.760 --> 33:39.760]  I'm a f***ing Patriot.
[33:39.760 --> 33:52.360]  I think we should classify them as a gang.
[33:52.360 --> 33:58.080]  You know, they come dressed in uniforms, they have weapons, they're almost a militia.
[33:58.080 --> 34:01.480]  I think we need to think about that in terms of our law enforcement approach.
[34:01.480 --> 34:08.800]  We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry
[34:08.800 --> 34:11.000]  and violence on many sides.
[34:11.000 --> 34:12.000]  On many sides.
[34:12.000 --> 34:13.000]  Wait.
[34:13.000 --> 34:14.000]  On many sides?
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.560]  This was a white nationalist rally.
[34:17.560 --> 34:19.640]  You have to call that out by name.
[34:19.640 --> 34:20.640]  Many sides?
[34:20.640 --> 34:27.840]  Mr. President, this is terrorism, not your order at KFC.
[34:27.840 --> 34:33.360]  Prior to the unrest, police banned sticks, masks, any other potential weapons, so ever
[34:33.360 --> 34:36.520]  dozens of anti-fascist protesters broke those rules and appeared.
[34:36.520 --> 34:40.640]  They also pepper sprayed the leader of the conservative group, one left-wing demonstrator
[34:40.640 --> 34:44.440]  attacked a photographer, and others reportedly threatened people who were trying to film
[34:44.440 --> 34:45.440]  the violence.
[34:45.440 --> 34:49.920]  What about the alt-left that came charging at the, as you say, the alt-right?
[34:49.920 --> 34:53.120]  Do they have any semblance of guilt?
[34:53.120 --> 34:55.120]  This is very interesting.
[34:55.120 --> 34:58.520]  Let me ask you this, what about the fact that came charging, that they came charging with
[34:58.520 --> 35:00.720]  clubs in their hands, swinging clubs?
[35:00.720 --> 35:02.640]  Do they have any problem?
[35:02.640 --> 35:03.640]  I think they do.
[35:03.640 --> 35:10.760]  And they are just beating people, ganging up, men and women, ganging up on lone individuals,
[35:10.760 --> 35:16.640]  and just beating them in a wanton, savage, brown shirt, Nazi operation.
[35:16.640 --> 35:22.560]  They don't want to mention ANTIFA and how ANTIFA literally came trained, militarized,
[35:22.560 --> 35:28.680]  doing war-like maneuvers, you know, they bring coolers and you think, oh, it's to stay hydrated.
[35:28.680 --> 35:33.200]  No, it's filled with water balloons, filled with feces, urine, just discussing things
[35:33.200 --> 35:35.080]  that will pop and explode on people.
[35:35.080 --> 35:37.200]  And water bottles filled with the same substances.
[35:37.200 --> 36:00.920]  Every time one of these situations happens, you know, you see the worst of people, sometimes
[36:00.920 --> 36:02.720]  I think we saw it out of the left.
[36:02.720 --> 36:07.800]  You just saw those videos of them chasing and beating people, people in black clothing,
[36:07.800 --> 36:12.000]  black masks, over 100 of them broke through the lines and attacked stragglers who were
[36:12.000 --> 36:13.000]  there.
[36:13.000 --> 36:14.560]  For the most part, the event was shut down.
[36:14.560 --> 36:18.000]  They couldn't find enough conservatives, so they started attacking the police after
[36:18.000 --> 36:23.440]  a while, but you saw them beating the conservatives, even as they come in carrying no hate signs.
[36:23.440 --> 36:29.440]  And the mayor said they made sure the themes of love and compassion dominated over hate
[36:29.440 --> 36:30.440]  speech.
[36:30.440 --> 36:39.400]  So what was the President Donald Trump vastly outnumbered by counter protesters at Martin
[36:39.400 --> 36:41.240]  Luther King Junior Civic Center Park?
[36:41.240 --> 36:43.440]  And then we saw that group with the masks on.
[36:43.440 --> 36:50.440]  They had their own, you know, shields that they made for lack of a better term, a huge
[36:50.440 --> 36:51.440]  crowd there now.
[36:51.440 --> 36:56.440]  And while we certainly don't know, certainly, and we'll try to find out, some of those protesters,
[36:56.440 --> 37:01.880]  the ones that showed up with the masks and the shields, may do this in other locations.
[37:01.880 --> 37:06.240]  They may do what you call professional protesters who do this a lot.
[37:06.240 --> 37:09.600]  That's an American flag that they have set on fire.
[37:09.600 --> 37:13.640]  This Trump supporter was the first casualty of the day with blood streaming out of his
[37:13.640 --> 37:14.640]  face.
[37:14.640 --> 37:17.160]  Well, they wanted to hit me with blasts and upgoes on the blind side, we're here for
[37:17.160 --> 37:18.160]  free speech.
[37:18.160 --> 37:23.920]  A mob chased him for a block and a half, took his flag, Trump hat and glasses, and spat
[37:23.920 --> 37:24.920]  all over him.
[37:24.920 --> 37:28.480]  You know, I'm okay with people making white supremacists feel unwelcome.
[37:28.480 --> 37:31.760]  I mean, excuse me, like, you're making me feel unsafe.
[37:31.760 --> 37:32.760]  But they were Christians.
[37:32.760 --> 37:33.760]  They were Christian march.
[37:33.760 --> 37:38.280]  Listen, everyone said, oh, yeah, you can't, you can't listen to CNN no more.
[37:38.280 --> 37:42.280]  You can't listen to the news anymore because it's all fake bullcrap.
[37:42.280 --> 37:45.160]  It wasn't fake before, so why is it fake now?
[37:45.160 --> 37:47.560]  The Russian story has kind of died down in those days.
[37:47.560 --> 37:54.200]  It's like, only because we're on the racism thing now.
[37:54.200 --> 38:01.720]  A little to do with it, if you take a look, if they had protection inside, the results
[38:01.720 --> 38:03.680]  would have been far better.
[38:03.680 --> 38:08.960]  This is a dispute that will always exist, I suspect, but if they had some kind of a protection
[38:08.960 --> 38:14.720]  inside the temple, maybe it could have been a very much different situation.
[38:14.720 --> 38:15.720]  They didn't.
[38:15.720 --> 38:19.240]  I think one thing we should do is we should stiffen up our laws in terms of the death
[38:19.240 --> 38:20.240]  penalty.
[38:20.240 --> 38:24.000]  When people do this, they should get the death penalty and they shouldn't have to wait
[38:24.000 --> 38:25.000]  years and years.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.160]  Now the lawyers will get involved.
[38:27.160 --> 38:32.160]  Anybody that does a thing like this to innocent people that are in temple or in church, we
[38:32.160 --> 38:37.680]  had so many incidents with churches, they should really suffer the ultimate price.
[38:37.680 --> 38:39.280]  They should pay the ultimate price.
[38:39.280 --> 38:41.160]  I felt that way for a long time.
[38:41.160 --> 38:46.200]  This is a case where if they had an armed guard inside, they might have been able to
[38:46.200 --> 38:48.000]  stop him immediately.
[38:48.000 --> 38:53.280]  So this would be a case for if there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would
[38:53.280 --> 38:54.720]  have been able to stop him.
[38:54.720 --> 38:57.600]  Maybe there would have been nobody killed except for him.
[38:57.600 --> 39:02.400]  I was standing by the company's decision to put info wars as Alex Jones on a seven-day
[39:02.400 --> 39:03.400]  suspension.
[39:03.400 --> 39:08.920]  This comes after Jones urged his Twitter followers to ready their battle rifles as he put it
[39:08.920 --> 39:10.160]  against the media.
[39:10.160 --> 39:11.160]  But none of that's true.
[39:11.160 --> 39:12.160]  It was posted to the site.
[39:12.160 --> 39:17.240]  Alex Jones on Twitter posted this week what essentially is a video calling for people
[39:17.240 --> 39:20.640]  to get their battle rifles ready against the media.
[39:20.640 --> 39:24.760]  People need to have their battle rifles and everything ready, their backsides, and you
[39:24.760 --> 39:25.760]  got to be ready.
[39:25.760 --> 39:30.640]  Saying it's time to act, it's got to be done now, move criminally against people.
[39:30.640 --> 39:38.000]  It's time politically and economically and judiciously and legally and criminally to move
[39:38.000 --> 39:39.000]  against these people.
[39:39.000 --> 39:40.840]  It's got to be done now.
[39:40.840 --> 39:42.640]  I said to chill up my spine.
[39:42.640 --> 39:43.640]  How about yours?
[39:43.640 --> 39:44.640]  It did.
[39:44.640 --> 39:52.800]  There's a number of actions that we believe help a call to incitement to violence and
[39:52.800 --> 39:56.400]  those are the things that we need to make sure that we're taking action on.
[39:56.400 --> 40:01.040]  Now is the time to act on the mainstream media and he says get the battle rifles ready.
[40:01.040 --> 40:02.560]  I didn't say that.
[40:02.560 --> 40:04.280]  That incites violence.
[40:04.280 --> 40:07.160]  Free speech does not protect inciting violence.
[40:07.160 --> 40:10.960]  This is an emergency message to President Trump, to Congress, and to anyone that supports
[40:10.960 --> 40:12.600]  free speech in this country.
[40:12.600 --> 40:16.680]  The Democratic Party is now calling for all Republicans, all patriots, including the President
[40:16.680 --> 40:20.960]  to be de-platformed from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, you name it.
[40:20.960 --> 40:24.720]  And Jones is hardly their only target, that's for sure, virtually every day the big tech
[40:24.720 --> 40:29.080]  companies censor someone else whose political opinions they disagree with.
[40:29.080 --> 40:34.440]  Facebook, censor our free speech and saying on the ones that don't even seem that we
[40:34.440 --> 40:35.440]  have been censored.
[40:35.440 --> 40:43.960]  This is a new, super political class that operate as a judiciary and as the police and
[40:43.960 --> 40:47.080]  as the prison guards to control our lives.
[40:47.080 --> 40:48.600]  This is classical authoritarianism.
[40:48.600 --> 40:53.200]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent
[40:53.200 --> 40:54.200]  them from speaking.
[40:54.200 --> 40:58.440]  You've taken action against him in this instance, can you tell us what it is?
[40:58.440 --> 41:00.680]  I believe we put him in a timeout.
[41:00.680 --> 41:04.800]  Alex Jones is not an eighth grader who got busted smoking in the bathroom.
[41:04.800 --> 41:05.800]  It's just not.
[41:05.800 --> 41:09.800]  I mean, he's the guy who is, you know, fueling alt-right conspiracy theories and saying-
[41:09.800 --> 41:15.040]  It's actually amazing that this is what caused the ban and not everything that Alex Jones
[41:15.040 --> 41:16.040]  has done before.
[41:16.040 --> 41:20.680]  It seems minor compared to the implications of someone suggesting a call to arms against
[41:20.680 --> 41:21.680]  a particular group in this case.
[41:21.680 --> 41:22.680]  Did you say that, liar?
[41:22.680 --> 41:25.680]  I didn't say use weapons on the media, I don't want them to have weapons used on them.
[41:25.680 --> 41:26.680]  That'll make them victims.
[41:26.680 --> 41:29.680]  I'm worried they're going to false flag and stage something on themselves.
[41:29.680 --> 41:32.920]  And then they're going to send anti-fouled dollar houses, which they're doxing everybody
[41:32.920 --> 41:33.920]  saying they are.
[41:33.920 --> 41:38.520]  And I said defensively, be prepared to defend yourself, and they say that is inciting violence.
[41:38.520 --> 41:39.520]  No, it's not.
[41:39.520 --> 41:40.520]  I said to chill up my spine.
[41:40.520 --> 41:42.000]  I'm getting chills right now.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  He said, come with the battle rifles, engage in criminal activity.
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.720]  And I said, use the judicial system legally and lawfully and go after them criminally.
[41:49.720 --> 41:51.680]  They have got to get a lid on this.
[41:51.680 --> 41:54.520]  And the idea of martyrdom, it's also probably interesting that it will be interesting to
[41:54.520 --> 41:56.480]  see who rallies around his cause.
[41:56.480 --> 41:59.000]  Let's remember, Donald Trump appeared on his show.
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.840]  President also entering the fray today, he said, quote, I won't mention names, but when
[42:02.840 --> 42:06.840]  they take certain people off of Twitter or Facebook, and they're making that decision,
[42:06.840 --> 42:10.000]  that is really a dangerous thing because it could be you tomorrow.
[42:10.000 --> 42:15.520]  And we're also standing up to social media censorship.
[42:15.520 --> 42:16.520]  That's the new thing.
[42:16.520 --> 42:21.040]  Trump's election and Alex Jones' popularity are merely symptoms of a corrupt and failed
[42:21.040 --> 42:22.160]  status quo.
[42:22.160 --> 42:23.160]  People know what's true.
[42:23.160 --> 42:24.680]  They can smell it.
[42:24.680 --> 42:26.240]  You can't stop them from knowing that.
[42:26.240 --> 42:29.240]  But this isn't about Alex Jones.
[42:29.240 --> 42:30.240]  This is about freedom.
[42:30.240 --> 42:33.960]  Mr. President, you don't want to look like you're after the press of the First Amendment.
[42:33.960 --> 42:35.960]  You're letting them butcher the press of the First Amendment.
[42:35.960 --> 42:40.000]  Oh, but you don't want to look authoritarian and stand up to them.
[42:40.000 --> 42:41.000]  They're authoritarian.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.640]  They're a clear and present danger.
[42:42.640 --> 42:44.640]  Do something about it.
[42:44.640 --> 42:48.280]  All right, folks, we're going to go to break.
[42:48.280 --> 42:49.360]  I am live.
[42:49.360 --> 42:52.600]  You heard that huge GABS CEO exclusive here.
[42:52.600 --> 42:57.240]  That's posted to infowars.com right now on the Paul Joseph Watson article.
[42:57.240 --> 42:59.600]  We're nine days out.
[42:59.600 --> 43:03.400]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[43:03.400 --> 43:07.920]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[43:07.920 --> 43:13.360]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[43:13.360 --> 43:18.720]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[43:18.720 --> 43:20.280]  to unhealthy levels.
[43:20.280 --> 43:26.800]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[43:26.800 --> 43:30.800]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[43:30.800 --> 43:32.160]  in the rainwater.
[43:32.160 --> 43:37.520]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[43:37.520 --> 43:43.600]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[43:43.600 --> 43:49.200]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[43:49.200 --> 43:54.560]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[43:54.560 --> 43:59.120]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[44:24.560 --> 44:29.000]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.440]  pesky in the future.
[44:30.440 --> 44:33.520]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[44:33.520 --> 44:34.520]  I want to keep going.
[44:34.520 --> 44:38.480]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[44:38.480 --> 44:40.480]  I want to push all the way.
[44:40.480 --> 44:41.760]  I've committed to do that.
[44:41.760 --> 44:44.680]  I've prayed for that, and I've been told that's going to happen.
[44:44.680 --> 44:47.360]  But you've got a back ash, and I promise you this.
[44:47.360 --> 44:48.720]  I will never falter.
[44:48.720 --> 44:51.040]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[44:51.040 --> 44:52.040]  I physically will.
[44:52.040 --> 44:56.880]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at infoworsewar.com to give you
[44:56.880 --> 45:00.320]  my absolute total commitment.
[45:00.320 --> 45:05.680]  InfoWorseLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[45:05.680 --> 45:11.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[45:11.000 --> 45:17.680]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[45:17.680 --> 45:23.560]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[45:23.560 --> 45:26.920]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[45:26.920 --> 45:31.560]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[45:31.560 --> 45:36.880]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[45:36.880 --> 45:37.880]  symptoms.
[45:37.880 --> 45:39.920]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[45:39.920 --> 45:41.920]  It is not an antihistamine.
[45:41.920 --> 45:46.480]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[45:46.480 --> 45:52.280]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[45:52.280 --> 45:54.960]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[45:54.960 --> 46:00.080]  Head to infoworselife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[46:00.080 --> 46:05.320]  They now know that InfoWorse has the spirit, the program, the code to relaunch it all,
[46:05.320 --> 46:07.480]  and that's why they treat us like we're death.
[46:07.480 --> 46:11.480]  To George Soros, and to Hillary Clinton, to Barack Obama, and to Lord Rothschild, I'm
[46:11.480 --> 46:13.680]  the grim reaper.
[46:13.680 --> 46:14.680]  Come to their door.
[46:14.680 --> 46:15.680]  I'm death.
[46:15.680 --> 46:17.280]  I'm death of their system.
[46:17.280 --> 46:20.960]  Please don't forget that if you don't support this broadcast, we'll be shut down and we
[46:20.960 --> 46:23.200]  make it easy with the very best products.
[46:23.200 --> 46:27.520]  And we've had a 50% off sale free shipping, the biggest sale in our history, and it has
[46:27.520 --> 46:31.560]  got to end in the next few days because we're selling out a lot of our best-selling products
[46:31.560 --> 46:36.520]  and we are hurtling into the whole Christmas season, so it's a great time to take advantage
[46:36.520 --> 46:41.440]  of these super sales right now, free shipping store-wide, 50% off on all the supplements,
[46:41.440 --> 46:46.040]  35% off on the highest-quality storeable foods at infowarstore.com right now.
[46:46.040 --> 46:50.160]  You support the broadcast, and that lets us stand against the enemy, which infuriates
[46:50.160 --> 46:51.160]  them.
[46:51.160 --> 46:54.200]  You know how scared they were of all those live videos of 90% of the Trump supporters
[46:54.200 --> 46:56.040]  being huge InfoWorse supporters?
[46:56.040 --> 46:57.160]  It scared them to death.
[46:57.160 --> 47:03.600]  That's why they want to extinguish us, but you won't let them.
[47:03.600 --> 47:29.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:29.600 --> 47:38.120]  Well, Lou Dobbs had a highly respected lawyer from Judicial Watch on that goes off documents
[47:38.120 --> 47:44.640]  on Thursday, and it didn't get any attention on Fox Business on Thursday, but it aired
[47:44.640 --> 47:47.640]  on regular Fox yesterday.
[47:47.640 --> 47:50.760]  That censored nine-minute interview is coming up next hour.
[47:50.760 --> 47:53.320]  We're going to play it here because they're taking it off the Internet.
[47:53.320 --> 47:54.320]  They're blocking it.
[47:54.320 --> 48:03.320]  The news apologized for it, and when you watch it, Judicial Watch got the documents.
[48:03.320 --> 48:11.120]  The George Soros' open society foundation gets U.S. taxpayer money, millions, to then
[48:11.120 --> 48:14.520]  fund these operations that have U.N. authority.
[48:14.520 --> 48:18.200]  So the U.N. has the treaties with the countries to set up the refugee camps, to bring the
[48:18.200 --> 48:23.600]  people in from all the world, to then unvetted bring them into the United States or Europe.
[48:23.600 --> 48:24.600]  That's a fact.
[48:24.600 --> 48:28.000]  Trump pulled out of the refugee agreement with the U.N. last year.
[48:28.000 --> 48:33.080]  Now, Austria, Hungary, Italy are all doing the same thing because the U.N. runs your
[48:33.080 --> 48:34.080]  border.
[48:34.080 --> 48:37.080]  Think about that.
[48:37.080 --> 48:38.680]  That's global government.
[48:38.680 --> 48:48.920]  But who runs it is the NGOs, those are the non-governmental organizations, and their filings are public.
[48:48.920 --> 48:55.960]  I've got a huge article from WorldNet Daily, border caravans called the George Soros Express,
[48:55.960 --> 49:02.320]  and it links to all the Judicial Watch documents, officially from lawsuits they got, from CARE
[49:02.320 --> 49:06.600]  and from the Carnegie Foundation and from the Rockefeller Foundation and the George Soros
[49:06.600 --> 49:12.000]  Open Society Foundation, it's federal filings.
[49:12.000 --> 49:17.160]  The leftist professors that run it, how they go and get the communists and socials out
[49:17.160 --> 49:21.680]  of the country to bring them here to be voters, they brag it's all.
[49:21.680 --> 49:25.280]  So why would Fox News apologize and pull the episode?
[49:25.280 --> 49:28.160]  Because it's true.
[49:28.160 --> 49:32.080]  And George Soros will sue you, he will infiltrate you, he will attack you.
[49:32.080 --> 49:36.040]  If you talk about him being a Nazi collaborator, like Ganesh DeSousa did in his last film,
[49:36.040 --> 49:40.080]  which he admitted, or if you expose that he's for open borders, hell, he used to be on
[49:40.080 --> 49:41.080]  the U.N.
[49:41.080 --> 49:44.200]  Board for migration.
[49:44.200 --> 49:50.800]  So that censored interview is coming up next hour, because I want you to see what they
[49:50.800 --> 49:53.040]  don't want you to see.
[49:53.040 --> 49:56.440]  And then we'll get into the attacks on Trump and the violence we predicted right before
[49:56.440 --> 49:59.640]  the elections, right on time.
[49:59.640 --> 50:00.640]  Very, very sad.
[50:00.640 --> 50:04.720]  But right now, let's go to some of the interview they don't want you to see, because Lou Dobbs
[50:04.720 --> 50:08.000]  had a guest on that got the documents that the sky's blue.
[50:08.000 --> 50:09.000]  Here it is.
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  Sure.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.720]  Look, this is a criminal involvement on the part of these leftist groups.
[50:12.720 --> 50:16.560]  It's a highly organized, very elaborate, sophisticated operation.
[50:16.560 --> 50:20.120]  I have that from the highest levels of the Guatemalan government.
[50:20.120 --> 50:24.480]  They're investigating those groups criminally, and I strongly urge President Trump and Attorney
[50:24.480 --> 50:26.280]  General Sessions to do the same here.
[50:26.280 --> 50:31.320]  A lot of these folks also have affiliates who are getting money from the Soros-occupied
[50:31.320 --> 50:34.120]  State Department, and that is a very great concern.
[50:34.120 --> 50:38.000]  When you start cutting money, start cutting money there.
[50:38.000 --> 50:43.160]  Here, seven, eight, nine years ago, before they fired Dobbs off CNN, when he had on average
[50:43.160 --> 50:47.440]  eight million viewers a night, Sean Hannity has four and a half million.
[50:47.440 --> 50:49.640]  CNN used to have huge audiences.
[50:49.640 --> 50:52.280]  They killed it because they got rid of Lou Dobbs.
[50:52.280 --> 50:54.320]  But that part doesn't matter.
[50:54.320 --> 50:58.320]  The point is, the vice president came out a week ago and yesterday and said, we have
[50:58.320 --> 51:01.000]  intel entirely organized on and on and on.
[51:01.000 --> 51:02.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've written about it.
[51:02.720 --> 51:04.120]  I've made films about it.
[51:04.120 --> 51:06.680]  The whole plan to use migrant waves to invade and take over.
[51:06.680 --> 51:15.160]  But look at this, Fox Business pulls Lou Dobbs' episode after guest Soros remarks.
[51:15.160 --> 51:20.960]  You just heard saying, this is criminal, and it is criminal.
[51:20.960 --> 51:26.440]  But it's not even a Fox pundit saying it, it's judicial watch, super respected.
[51:26.440 --> 51:28.520]  They have the documents.
[51:28.520 --> 51:34.520]  Yeah, it's criminal to organize hundreds of thousands of people, including children,
[51:34.520 --> 51:38.720]  who are unaccompanied in some cases, and it's been confirmed massive smugglers bringing
[51:38.720 --> 51:40.720]  kids through in these caravans.
[51:40.720 --> 51:43.560]  That's in the Associated Press to the Washington Times today.
[51:43.560 --> 51:48.320]  Migrant caravan halts after a report of abducted child.
[51:48.320 --> 51:53.560]  What do you think's going on with 50,000 people in one group and 10,000 in another and 5,000
[51:53.560 --> 51:54.840]  in another and a bunch of others?
[51:54.840 --> 51:58.880]  And it's just a bunch of coyotes or smugglers.
[51:58.880 --> 52:01.680]  But don't say it.
[52:01.680 --> 52:03.480]  Don't say it.
[52:03.480 --> 52:07.560]  Because Rupert Murdoch has dinner with George Soros.
[52:07.560 --> 52:09.640]  We just put up with this garbage.
[52:09.640 --> 52:10.640]  They talk about violence.
[52:10.640 --> 52:14.320]  You know, the amount of 200,000 dead in Mexico in the last couple of years and all the violence
[52:14.320 --> 52:15.320]  down there.
[52:15.320 --> 52:18.440]  And there are people just marching up out of Latin America, out of the middle of nowhere,
[52:18.440 --> 52:20.320]  just supposed to come on in and then, oh, you're here?
[52:20.320 --> 52:24.280]  We're not going to check IDs or find out why there's one man with six kids.
[52:24.280 --> 52:26.760]  That's, you know, a lot of cases are like that, or one woman.
[52:26.760 --> 52:28.640]  And then what was the Washington Post headline?
[52:28.640 --> 52:33.320]  Remember, Obama, five years ago, started letting last three years of administration, anybody
[52:33.320 --> 52:35.480]  come through.
[52:35.480 --> 52:41.000]  And then Washington Post headline, children allowed into the U.S. by Obama, given to Democrat
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.400]  aid groups, ended up in child trafficking.
[52:45.400 --> 52:50.120]  Now this white supremacist activated sleeper cell, whatever he was, right on time that
[52:50.120 --> 52:55.920]  shows up and kills 11 innocent people, he thought, oh, the Jews are bringing everybody
[52:55.920 --> 52:56.920]  up here.
[52:56.920 --> 53:00.360]  They've got the Methodist Church, the Catholic Church, the Baptist churches, all under the
[53:00.360 --> 53:04.720]  ecumenical movement, under the World Council of Churches set up with the Rockefellers,
[53:04.720 --> 53:10.080]  where the U.N. runs it, just like they run our borders until Trump got in, to get the
[53:10.080 --> 53:14.600]  churches all feeling sorry for the women and children who are a minority, it's 80% military
[53:14.600 --> 53:19.160]  aged men, and then they just, they're giving money and helping and housing them once they
[53:19.160 --> 53:20.160]  get here.
[53:20.160 --> 53:23.840]  It's not with some nefarious conspiracy by them, they're being manipulated.
[53:23.840 --> 53:27.720]  I was sitting there five years ago, four years ago, my mother's church, where she's
[53:27.720 --> 53:28.720]  been going for decades.
[53:28.720 --> 53:33.080]  I'm not gonna name the name of it, she doesn't go there anymore, and it was like, we're gonna
[53:33.080 --> 53:36.520]  take an offering for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation now, because they're helping
[53:36.520 --> 53:42.040]  children get vaccinated, you know, right, and oh, we're gonna help some migrants, and
[53:42.040 --> 53:45.160]  it was just like, that's all they are now, it was a Methodist Church.
[53:45.160 --> 53:49.200]  I mean, that's all that goes on now, okay?
[53:49.200 --> 53:52.520]  And she went, she was, I'm not gonna get into, she went and talked about it, the point is,
[53:52.520 --> 53:57.760]  the point is, is they use all these well-meaning people incrementally until they've got you
[53:57.760 --> 54:02.480]  literally pushing the globalist agenda, because they take over your religion.
[54:02.480 --> 54:06.520]  So I do not believe that people at the synagogue, you know, were hating America and talked to,
[54:06.520 --> 54:09.520]  no, they were like, we have to go out and do good deeds, we have to go out and bring
[54:09.520 --> 54:12.360]  these people in, we have to do this, but the globalists are manipulating it from behind
[54:12.360 --> 54:13.360]  the scenes.
[54:13.360 --> 54:16.840]  And so this white supremacist loon bag, if you believe the official story, you know,
[54:16.840 --> 54:22.320]  he's sitting here looking at all this, believing all this, and then he's, oh my God, look,
[54:22.320 --> 54:26.600]  it's finally, we've got proof of Jews doing something, they are bringing in these illegal
[54:26.600 --> 54:29.880]  alien invaders, blah, blah, blah, and then he goes and does this horrible deed.
[54:29.880 --> 54:35.280]  But look at the timing, as I said last Monday, we've got the clip, played it last week, I
[54:35.280 --> 54:39.440]  had some business guys here on Monday, one of them called me and he said, I was there
[54:39.440 --> 54:43.440]  in your studio watching Monday when you said they'll probably have a crazy guy in a van
[54:43.440 --> 54:46.920]  with a bunch of Trump stickers all over it that they'll bust.
[54:46.920 --> 54:47.920]  He goes, how did you know that?
[54:47.920 --> 54:50.040]  I just said, man, come on.
[54:50.040 --> 54:54.720]  It was 14 days out, now we're nine days out, and it's gonna get crazier if they're on every
[54:54.720 --> 54:59.840]  news channel saying there's about to be giant terror attacks, and that Trump and Alex Jones
[54:59.840 --> 55:01.560]  are the free presser to blame.
[55:01.560 --> 55:06.320]  A, we'd never do that, B, we have no history of it, C, the left has been constantly staging
[55:06.320 --> 55:10.520]  things and calling for violence, and so when it magically all begins, you gotta look at
[55:10.520 --> 55:15.720]  it a little, a little out of the corner of your eye and go, man, that really is convenient,
[55:15.720 --> 55:19.880]  and why would you know these attacks are coming and be parroting it up there over and over
[55:19.880 --> 55:20.880]  again?
[55:20.880 --> 55:25.720]  But let's go to Pence, as I mentioned, oh, I guess Fox News can't suspend this video.
[55:25.720 --> 55:30.520]  I guess they can't kick Mike Pence, the vice president, off the air because it's true.
[55:30.520 --> 55:33.200]  It's outside, leftist group, Soros is only part of it.
[55:33.200 --> 55:39.200]  If you wanna go read all the documents, border caravan, call it the George Soros Express,
[55:39.200 --> 55:44.520]  and it's got links to the judicial watch, photocopies of all of it, hundreds of pages
[55:44.520 --> 55:50.560]  of it, tens of millions of dollars of taxpayer money goes from the U.S. to the U.N. to George
[55:50.560 --> 55:53.640]  Soros and other foundations.
[55:53.640 --> 56:00.160]  You hear the NPR sponsors, Annenberg Foundation, Ford Foundation, Carnegie, Open Society, it's
[56:00.160 --> 56:01.880]  the same group.
[56:01.880 --> 56:02.880]  Okay?
[56:02.880 --> 56:05.880]  But anyways, let's go to the vice president and hear this.
[56:05.880 --> 56:11.160]  No, we've got a crisis at our southern border, but this caravan that was organized by leftist
[56:11.160 --> 56:16.360]  organizations in Honduras, it made its way through Guatemala, now thousands of people
[56:16.360 --> 56:22.280]  trying to come up the thousand mile journey through Mexico for the purpose of violating
[56:22.280 --> 56:26.280]  our laws and coming into this country illegally is just unacceptable.
[56:26.280 --> 56:29.880]  The president and I have made it clear we will not allow it, and we're going to take
[56:29.880 --> 56:34.400]  steps necessary to secure our border, enforce our laws, and our message to those in the
[56:34.400 --> 56:37.680]  caravan is return home.
[56:37.680 --> 56:43.120]  But our message to the American people is this caravan is a reminder of a crisis in
[56:43.120 --> 56:49.680]  illegal immigration that is driven by laws that human traffickers actually use to entice
[56:49.680 --> 56:56.440]  people to make the long and dangerous journey, which is admitted, which is confirmed, which
[56:56.440 --> 56:58.440]  is unbelievably criminal.
[56:58.440 --> 57:04.040]  And then you say that, that the U.N. and NGOs are forming bases all around Europe and all
[57:04.040 --> 57:10.160]  around the U.S. to open up corridors to flood us and cause a stampede, and then Fox News
[57:10.160 --> 57:14.440]  deletes that, next hour we're going to get to all of it.
[57:14.440 --> 57:17.880]  Millie Weaver joins us, she was already in Pennsylvania, made it to the scene an hour
[57:17.880 --> 57:21.640]  and a half after it happened, about incredible interviews that are up at infowars.com and
[57:21.640 --> 57:23.280]  newswars.com.
[57:23.280 --> 57:27.600]  Please don't forget, without you sharing the articles and videos, nobody sees them, because
[57:27.600 --> 57:30.240]  we're banned off all globalist social media.
[57:30.240 --> 57:34.760]  We're not banned off your email, we're not banned off you tweeting yourself or Facebooking
[57:34.760 --> 57:39.600]  yourself or text messaging at friends and family and saying, wow, hear what the head
[57:39.600 --> 57:42.800]  of the social media group, playing for the shooting, had to say, let's let him actually
[57:42.800 --> 57:43.800]  have a voice.
[57:43.800 --> 57:44.800]  You think he'd have a voice?
[57:44.800 --> 57:53.560]  The second hour coming up, we are the people's voice.
[57:53.560 --> 57:58.520]  Years ago, infowars life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal
[57:58.520 --> 57:59.520]  yeast.
[57:59.520 --> 58:03.080]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew
[58:03.080 --> 58:07.040]  we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.

[58:12.200 --> 58:15.800]  to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.

[58:50.400 --> 58:52.840]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[58:52.840 --> 58:56.920]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids

[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.120]  Think about this.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:30.000]  We're eight and a half days out from the election, all hell's breaking loose.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.960]  The chai comms are plunging the stock market trying to stop Trump.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:40.680]  They got white supremacists running around, shooting up synagogues who hate Trump because
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.680]  he's a globalist and a pawn of Israel.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.960]  It's just crazy.
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:51.560]  And ask yourself, what's coming next, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow on the weekday show,
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:55.280]  7 a.m. to 3 p.m., I'll be hoping the phone's up and having guests on asking that question.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.480]  On that stour, I'm going to focus on news and clips and Millie Weaver, one of our great
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.880]  reporters joining us.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:06.960]  And don't forget, 8 a.m. every day, the David Knight show, the David Knight broadcast, we'll
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:12.920]  be covering all the real developments in live time in the War Room with Owen Shroyer
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:16.680]  and Roger Stone doing a superlative job as well, 3 p.m. central.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:23.280]  And we've got weeknight coverage, 8 to 10 p.m. with myself and many others of the election.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.480]  And for the day before the election and the day of the election, we're going to have,
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.120]  you know, a few days before the election, we're going to go live until like midnight
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120]  every night.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.880]  We're just going to stay live from 8 a.m. to about midnight.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:38.000]  And then on election night, we're going to go until like 4 a.m., obviously.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.920]  And if the left pulls something or there's a truck bomb, God forbid, or like I said,
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.720]  a synagogue getting shot up, God forbid, or something like that, we'll be here covering
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.720]  it live.
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.680]  And we'll have reporters, I mean, incredible that Millie was like 2 hours away from the
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:56.200]  shooting and got there like 2 hours after and got amazing interviews.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.360]  And it was mainly a Jewish neighborhood and there's all these conservative, smart, super
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:03.960]  well-spoken, good-looking Jewish people.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:09.480]  And I just say our listeners are always, they're black, white, Mexican, whatever, there's always
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.960]  patriots who just have to fire their eyes, they're good-looking people.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.880]  Go to a leftist event and say, look, I'm sorry, I care what color they are, I look like hell.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.840]  I mean, most conservatives look better than me and I'm not some good-looking guy, you
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.840]  know what I mean?
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.640]  Like, I'm just saying, it's like their souls are sucked out, but she's just walking along
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:26.800]  randomly and almost everybody's a listener and a supporter.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:30.480]  And you can go to a black area, you can go to a Catholic area, you can go to a Christian
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.840]  area, you can go to, you know, wherever.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:38.560]  I was up in Omaha a few months ago with my wife visiting her family.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:43.160]  Her family's up there and we went to this Greek restaurant where, and these people had
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.480]  babies at her when she was a kid, so she grew up with their kids and she hadn't been there
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.480]  in like a decade.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:52.720]  This is a little side story and there's an Orthodox Greek church right next door that
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:58.880]  basically had let out and so we were there on a Sunday and went over there and ate and
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.840]  I got mobbed by Greek Americans who've been here most of them 100 years or so with their
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:08.040]  beautiful Orthodox church down the block and I met at the Greek place, eating the great
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:13.500]  Greek food and like half of them were listeners and I mean, again, that's the beauty of real
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:19.520]  diversity is that it brings all this flavor to America and all these different ideas and
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:23.880]  things in the melting pot, but globalism, once you all divided in your own little groups
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.440]  and fighting with each other, a divide and conquer.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:34.120]  So I'm just saying whether it's Greek, Greek Orthodox folks in Omaha or then I was talking
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:38.520]  to folks, ran people from a Buddhist temple that were listeners, a bunch of them in Omaha,
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:42.520]  that was another weird thing that happened and they were telling me how, look at that
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:43.520]  building over there.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.880]  That's where the CIA space, all the stuff, but the point was is that everybody loves
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:53.480]  freedom and they get it and they tune in here and they hear pretty reasonable stuff versus
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:58.120]  what you hear on the news that I want to kill the media, A, that would make us look bad
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:02.480]  and wouldn't be good and they're not the media, they're anti American saboteurs and
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.720]  B, I'd get put in prison.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.720]  And that's the thing.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:11.560]  I don't want to censor Lewis Farrakhan and they do cherry pick things he said and he's
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.040]  a big leader and that we can get him on the side of fighting the globalist.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.040]  It'd be a great thing.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.160]  So I went and talked to him to try to stop a race war.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.080]  He agreed and he's come out to be a Trump supporter.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:27.120]  So Farrakhan is kind of in flux and I'd like to see him like Darth Vader, you know, come
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:30.520]  over completely the Liberty movement before he kicks the bucket.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.000]  He definitely got more energy than I do it, however old he is, my God.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.320]  The point is, is that I just would rather get him to see, they put him in that pigeonhole.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.160]  The point is, I don't say take him off to him.
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.840]  He said some things I hate, things I disagree with.
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:48.080]  The point is though, cab didn't do any of that and they're being blamed for the shooting
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.000]  when they didn't didn't say or do anything.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.960]  You've got leftists on Twitter saying kill everybody and they're left out with millions
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.160]  of followers, but I've been taken off.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.880]  It's not fair.

[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:26.720]  I want to make a point here before I get into all this huge news in the second hour.
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.200]  Liberty is popular.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.680]  Freedom is popular no matter what melanin you have in your skin, whether you be from
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:40.960]  Japan or Greece or Mexico or Nigeria or Canada or the UK or Chile.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:47.560]  People genuinely in general want basic freedom and want justice.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.520]  And you've got a lot of big globalist corporations that have used leftist propaganda to create
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.520]  divide and conquer.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:57.360]  When I went to that Trump rally, first one I'd gone to because I don't want to cause
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.360]  a scene.
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:00.960]  And boy, it caused a scene in Houston.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.200]  20,000 inside, 100,000 tickets that went out, probably 50,000 outside conservatively.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.400]  Most folks came and went after an hour.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:11.560]  Couldn't even find parking for miles around it.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:16.560]  And we show up there and I got hours of just mobbed.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:22.640]  I couldn't, to go 100 feet would be like 30 minutes unless I was just rude to people.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:27.800]  And it was dizzy and the amount of, I mean, I've been to leftist events, I cover them.
[01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:36.040]  You go to leftist events, it's all white people that look like they're on meth and some Hispanics
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:40.240]  and then usually a few really sad looking old black ladies that look like bag ladies.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:44.840]  So I feel sorry for who are just desperate for the social security check and are just
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:45.840]  scared.
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:50.160]  And then you go to a Trump event and man, it's like the best looking black people, the
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.440]  best looking white people, the best looking Asians, the best looking Hispanics.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.920]  And by best looking, I mean, they're just alive.
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:01.840]  They might be overweight, they might be skinny, they just look alive.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.080]  And I was, my hand was sore.
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.760]  I was being hugged by everybody and the footage is up on infowars.com, it was viral on Twitter,
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:13.640]  they banned it because they don't want that image of unity.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:19.000]  But Owen Shroyer and others were just in DC for the big walk away thing this weekend,
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.640]  mobbed by high school kids, mobbed by white people, black people, Hispanics, mobbed by
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.640]  everybody.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:27.760]  Now there was a group of black folks brainwashed, it ran up and started getting his face and
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:28.760]  attacking.
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:34.800]  And that footage is up on infowars.com, it's very, very sad and these people look like
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.120]  they're idiots.
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:41.920]  I mean, you contrast those black folks versus a video of black folks at Trump rally talking
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:48.480]  to me and they're all more articulate than I am, better dressed than I am, that they're
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:49.480]  act together.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:52.960]  And then you look at these leftist victims and they literally act like morons.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:56.600]  And that's what I'm telling you is the globalists want to dumb down education, make people
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.440]  dependent because they want this type of climate.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:04.200]  Now we have the banned Lou Dobbs piece from Fox News that reared Saturday and they're
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.040]  all apologizing and everything.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:11.360]  It's pure truth from judicial watch that sued and got the documents proving Soros is in
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:16.560]  part, depending on which caravan you look at, he funds about 30% of it with your taxpayer
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:17.560]  money.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:21.040]  The big thing is Soros gets taxpayer money, it's not that he's a criminal.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.040]  That's a side issue.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:26.080]  What they're really scared of is through USA to the UN, he gets your money and he directs
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.080]  it.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:31.640]  That way they can, if the UN commits crimes through Soros, they don't get in trouble.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.800]  So they fence it through Soros.
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:38.080]  So that's coming up, but and I bring this up about leftist acting like zombies and being
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:44.000]  almost all white because they are, and it's important to let go, you know, it's like when
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.880]  you see somebody, I don't watch a lot of TV, but we watch sometimes the live cop shows.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.280]  They have a Friday and Saturday night, you know, when I'm laying there about my wife
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:55.240]  and sometimes one of my daughters is in there, you know, eating ice cream or whatever.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:58.560]  It was just like, I think this happened a couple nights ago, the point is, was that
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:02.680]  this week, those last week, and they have like these live cop shows and I go, oh, those
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:03.680]  are methods.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:08.040]  They can be black, they can be white, they got the meth mouth, they got the erectinal,
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:15.240]  I go, the cops are going to find meth in their purse and every time meth is found in the
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.240]  purse.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:23.880]  I mean, it's like you look at a leftist and they look like meth heads or something, something's
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:25.960]  wrong with them.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.560]  I don't care if they're white, I don't care if they're black, I don't care who they are,
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.560]  there's something wrong with them.
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:35.440]  There's even studies that conservatives look better all over the world.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.560]  It could be in Brazil, it could be in Africa, it could be, you know, in a continent, a country,
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:44.160]  conservatives look better, they're not really conservatives.
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:49.640]  The media means what is successful looks better and it's not just that you look good and that
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:56.800]  your looks are classical, it's that you have an innate strength in you that's pro-human.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:01.320]  I mean, how many videos have we seen the left beating up people at pro-life demonstrations,
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.920]  men beating up women and the media praises it, but I'm digressing.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.960]  Let's go ahead and get to them blaming Trump for everything.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:15.120]  Here is Schiff, the corrupt member of Congress, the Democrat deputy head of the judiciary
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:21.600]  committee, saying that Trump is guilty for the climate of, what's his quote here, Trump
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:25.640]  is guilty, he's set the tone of hatred and ensightment of violence.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:32.480]  I mean, I've got to think of where conservatives call for violence and count it up on one hand,
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:33.480]  okay?
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.840]  This latest white supremacist was a national socialist that hated Trump because he likes
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:43.200]  Israel and hates it, so that doesn't, see, hated Trump.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.120]  They're having to just blame the media and alternative media and try to ban that because
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.240]  they need to escape you.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:52.320]  But the left itself, all the violence, the shootings, police, tagging Rand Paul, on and
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:57.240]  on and on, and then all the talk of killing Trump and then raping Barron and raping Melania
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:12:04.400]  and raping blah, blah, blah, all the stuff we hear and then they say Trump is responsible
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:09.000]  for standing up to him is what he's responsible for, here it is.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.440]  The broader issue is what kind of climate are we creating in the country?
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:20.200]  This country is filled with amazing, beautiful, wonderful people who came here, many of them
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:23.680]  attracted by the idea this was a land of opportunity, no matter your religion, your
[01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:24.680]  ethnic.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:30.160]  The MS-13 are God's children, you mean that, like unvetted kids being child traffic, Washington
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:38.120]  Post that Obama brought in, loaded on, God knows whose charity disappearing forever.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.600]  And so Trump has added to this, the UN wants to overrun the borders, not let us have any
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:43.600]  borders.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:47.720]  Trump says we're not into the UN anymore and so you go on there and say he's responsible
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:53.000]  for the climate that you know you've been pushing continually, continue.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:01.800]  Origin your color, that idea is being tested by those who are preaching hatred and division
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:06.800]  and we have to overcome that and I think the president has a pivotal role there.
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:10.800]  No one sets the tone more than the president of the United States and the tone that he
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:15.600]  sets is one of division, often one of hatred, sometimes one of incitement of violence against
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:22.280]  journalists and there's no escaping our collective responsibility but there's no escaping the
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:27.880]  tone that he sets for the country, the tone that there should be a country what you call
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:28.880]  white supremacist.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:33.440]  He says we deserve a country and shouldn't be run by China or the UN or the EU bureaucrats
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:39.000]  which we were under, he killed the TPP all of it, I mean that is as the president says,
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.560]  fake news, fake news big time.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.160]  Okay, let's go to the next clip here.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:51.920]  This is Dana Bash on bomb suspect, Trump responsible for shocking CNN, suck chance, no CNN, your
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:57.720]  ratings suck, your known liars, you stir up war, you stir up division, you stir up anti-free
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.840]  speech crap, you suck because you suck.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.800]  When you drive into a town, you don't know the town, this restaurant's full of cars,
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.960]  that restaurant has nobody at it.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.240]  The woman no cars at it's got flies in the hamburgers, the one with the line around the
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.800]  block is delicious.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:17.760]  No one watches you because you suck.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:18.760]  Here is Dana Bash.
[01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:24.200]  Can I just say because we're putting this picture up, the image of what was on that
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:31.840]  van for an extended period of time, that image CNN sucks, of course the president didn't
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:38.360]  direct this, he's not technically responsible for this, but he is responsible for not just
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:45.200]  allowing the chance CNN sucks at his rallies, but stoking it, making clear that he likes
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:46.200]  it.
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.240]  Yeah, so that's enough, get her off.
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:53.200]  So CNN says Trump is literally Hitler and that he wants to destroy the country and kill
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:58.080]  all the minorities, he wants to murder the gay people, none of it's truth, and so people
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:03.480]  are sick of being lied to and so it's Trump's fault.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:10.800]  Got another clip, CNN's Brian Stelter calls GAB alt-right website, a Hillary Clinton invention
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:17.120]  on, no it's a social media site that has free speech like the rest of the internet had just
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.080]  two years ago.

[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.120]  them.
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:51.160]  You know how scared they were of all those live videos of 90% of the Trump supporters
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.000]  being huge M4 supporters?
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.360]  It scared them to death, that's why they want to extinguish us, but you won't let them.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:05.480]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:11.160]  Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.480]  Faced off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've

[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:21.600]  Blend coffee.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:25.680]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.880]  the world's finest coffee bean.

[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:02.960]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:07.660]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.160]  to detoxify the body.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:11.520]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield.
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:14.040]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.560]  It's made in the USA.
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:20.480]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:22.320]  the body and it supports the info war.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.560]  It is a classical 360 win.
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:28.120]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:33.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]  you can possibly get.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.920]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:42.960]  country in the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:48.200]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.880]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.200]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:20:02.120]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShieldInfoWarsLive.com.
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:20.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:26.400]  Welcome to ZShieldInfoWarsLive from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:58.240]  Show.
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.800]  I want to do something here in this segment that's really important.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:06.080]  Lou Dobbs had eight, 10 million viewers at a time back when he was on CNN.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:09.160]  And then Obama got elected and it was too upsetting for them, the number one thing in
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:14.040]  television, double the viewers that Sean Hannity has today.
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:18.400]  It was upsetting them that people were hearing the truth about the North American Union,
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:23.440]  about globalism, about the TPP, about all of this, which now Trump's gotten to office
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:27.680]  and Trump is killing foreign multinational corporations setting up systems around our
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:28.680]  country.
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:33.320]  So I'm going to play a little clip of the final show that got him banned off CNN for
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.320]  being number one.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.560]  Kind of like we're being banned off the internet for being number one.
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:40.320]  Well, they're trying to shut Drudge down for being the number one website.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:43.080]  Number two website in the world, number one, a new site.
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:48.920]  And I'm going to play the three minutes and 15 seconds of the banned part from Lou Dobbs's
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:53.920]  show this Thursday that reared Saturday on Fox that they're making such a big deal out
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:54.920]  of.
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:22:01.160]  Fox condemns rhetoric used by Lou Dobbs guest as channel star host faces growing criticism.
[01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.160]  Yes.
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:07.080]  As his ratings go up, just like Sean Hannity or just like Tucker Carlson, he needs to be
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.080]  taken off.
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.080]  Well, you can't.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:17.520]  And then you read the specifics, it's all in an article, border caravan.
[01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:21.040]  Call it the George Soros Express from WorldNet Daily.
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:26.280]  There's a bunch of other articles, but this is what judicial watch is talking about.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:31.120]  Judicial watch is talking about the documents they sued last year and this year to get
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:39.640]  where in Europe and here it is leftist groups that US taxpayer money through the UN.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:44.400]  He give the UN money through US aid and other groups and then it's given to the NGOs that
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.320]  run it.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:48.160]  And Soros doesn't pay for this himself.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.720]  He gets your tax money to build the refugee centers to advertise it to bring them in.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:55.760]  And then they manage them once they get here with the aid groups and they house them in
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:00.000]  churches and synagogues and Catholic charities and then the local let us get up to half the
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.280]  money and the welfare that each person brings in.
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:10.640]  This is a cash cow bonanza and they don't want that discussed.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.640]  But it's all true.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:16.080]  I've already been covering this for years, but you need to go read about the George
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:23.840]  Soros Open Society Foundation, CARE, the Annenberg Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:30.480]  Carnegie Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, all the groups you hear advertising on NPR.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:32.520]  And it's links in the WorldNet Daily article.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:35.160]  We've written about these as well, but this is the best article that just boils it all
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.160]  down.
[01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:42.160]  And it's got the bios of the professors at Berkeley and UT and Harvard that run the migrant
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:48.480]  studies and how they're going to say there's no borders, no wall, no USA at all, no borders,
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.560]  no wall, no USA at all.
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.560]  It's all here.
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:53.960]  But they think you're idiots.
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:56.560]  They think you won't go look this up.
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:03.560]  And we're paying for this, for leftists, not regular folks from Honduras or San Salvador
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:09.940]  or Venezuela, but the very ones waving their Honduran and Venezuelan flags saying they
[01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:12.680]  hate America.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:17.960]  And Trump's Hitler and Trump's the Antichrist and burning American flags and smuggling children.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.000]  That's in the news today.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.400]  Mexico stopped the caravan.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:25.280]  They're smuggled kids in there.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:27.680]  So it's the truth that can't be spoken.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:30.240]  See, they say, oh, Jones is saying kill the media.
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:31.240]  Where's the clip?
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:32.240]  Not saying that.
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:37.360]  No, Jones is showing you judicial watch documents and see they can't have Lou Dobbs do that
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:38.360]  either.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.760]  Why, he's too respected.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:42.200]  Why, he was number one in cable.
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.200]  He went against Fox.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:44.680]  He had twice the viewers they did.
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:51.120]  We can't allow that to CNN could have conservatives on and they'd be number one, but they won't
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:55.160]  do it because they are there to suppress the people.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:03.000]  So let's go to the section of the censored Lou Dobbs judicial watch interview with Chris
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.640]  Ferrell, director of judicial watch.
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:06.640]  Here it is.
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:11.560]  Caravan just north of the Honduran border joining us tonight, Chris Ferrell, director
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:13.920]  of investigations for judicial watch.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.240]  Chris good to have you with us.
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:21.440]  I know that this caravan was a subject of considerable interest for you for judicial
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:27.080]  watch and certainly for the American people, give us your first and I'm going to because
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:30.520]  we have limited time, ask you to be as succinct as possible.
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:33.920]  Your thoughts on what you witnessed and what you saw and heard.
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:38.040]  It's an overwhelmingly male caravan of mid teens to mid forties.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:41.680]  I'd say the women and children are super minority.
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:45.320]  There are certainly criminal elements rolled into the caravan.
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:50.480]  There were children that were recovered from a human smuggling operation today.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:55.080]  The Guatemalans are trying to hold them back and turn them back, but it's a very grave
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:56.400]  situation.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:03.640]  Leftist groups reported to be the organizers playing instrumental roles and financial roles.
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:04.640]  Tell us what you can.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:05.640]  Sure.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:08.720]  Look, this is a criminal involvement on the parties leftist groups.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:12.640]  It's highly organized, very elaborate, sophisticated operation.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.240]  I have that from the highest levels of the Guatemalan government.
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:20.680]  They're investigating those groups criminally, and I strongly urge President Trump and Attorney
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.480]  General Sessions to do the same here.
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:27.680]  A lot of these folks also have affiliates who are getting money from the Soros Occupied
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:30.520]  State Department, and that is a very great concern.
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:33.400]  When you start cutting money, start cutting money there.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:40.880]  Do you know anything about what we're seeing in this reports and pictures of USAID packages,
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:47.840]  bags containing what we know not, but obviously distributed by USAID?
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.840]  What is behind that?
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.320]  I don't have a clear answer off the top of my head.
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:54.880]  I can just tell you that there's all sorts of programs that these groups are affiliated
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:57.600]  with that we spend taxpayer money on.
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.240]  It needs to be cut off now.
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:02.680]  And where are we headed?
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:09.000]  We have another caravan of a thousand or more people forming up in Honduras ready to make
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:15.480]  the same trek through Guatemala to end of Mexico with a plan of getting to our southern
[01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:16.480]  border.
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:19.200]  Your thoughts about this and what we can expect.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:22.120]  It's really an intermittent river of humanity.
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:25.520]  It's not a caravan in the sense of a discrete group.
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:31.480]  And I also look, I don't have firm evidence yet, but my intelligence, my indicators are,
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.000]  look for something coming out of El Salvador in the next week.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:43.400]  And the president has ordered at least 800 troops, logistic primarily in mission to the
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.400]  southern border.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:51.280]  What's it going to take to take what appears to be now 14,000 migrants in this caravan
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:52.280]  way better than that?
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:55.960]  Shuttled by the Mexican government right into our border.
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:01.720]  If they get to the border and they make an asylum claim, remember 98% get through.
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:03.360]  Something fundamentals got to change here.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.120]  And then that triggers the next wave.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.960]  Chris Ferrell, good to have you back.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:07.960]  Thanks, Luke.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:11.680]  Okay, so everything he said is true.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:12.680]  It's on record.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:16.040]  They're making all these arrests and child smuggling right now.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:19.440]  Show the Washington Post article about Obama when he opened the border up these caravans
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.720]  were full of kids that were then smuggled and trafficked into prostitution.
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:23.960]  That's the Washington Post.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:24.960]  There it is.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.400]  So that's why they're so scared.
[01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:33.120]  That's why they're so upset is that the common sense of what is happening is waking people
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:36.440]  up so they can't have discussions about how this is criminal.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:39.720]  They can't have discussions about how this is illegal.
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:40.720]  There it is.
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:45.760]  Obama administration plays children with human traffickers, Washington Post, okay?
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:48.760]  So they're going all or nothing.
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:51.480]  Their strength is they're overshooting their weaknesses.
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:52.480]  They're doing that as well.
[01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:53.480]  It's a Hail Mary.
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:58.280]  It's unbelievably insane and criminal.
[01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:02.960]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by info wars life.

[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:06.280]  and you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with info wars.
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:09.960]  Yes, some of them are like little side accounts, they even know we had like info wars stores
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:14.280]  that just showed our products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:18.120]  I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:21.640]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:26.480]  and the world back from the break, but the globalists now want to target where the resistance
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.360]  came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:32.440]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:33.440]  I want to keep going.
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:37.400]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.400]  I want to push all the way.
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.680]  I've committed to do that.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:44.680]  I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen, but you've got a backish
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:47.640]  and I promise you this, I will never falter.
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:49.960]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:50.960]  I physically will.
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:55.800]  But I give you my commitment if you financially support us at infowarstore.com to give you
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:57.800]  my absolute total commitment.
[01:30:57.800 --> 01:31:02.600]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:06.880]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dogs for a walk.
[01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:11.040]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:17.080]  lights every day, but thanks to supermail vitality at infowarstore.com, I still have
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:18.080]  that energy.
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:22.320]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:26.480]  the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:31.480]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:38.720]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:42.720]  So go to infowarstore.com and get supermail vitality before it's gone.

[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:57.480]  Supermail vitality.
[01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:03.440]  Infowar's life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:08.640]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:15.480]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:21.320]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:24.640]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:29.560]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:36.040]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:39.560]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:44.200]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:50.040]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:52.680]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:33:21.680]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:29.680]  There must be some way out of here, say the joke or do the thing.
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:31.680]  Too much confusion.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:33.680]  There's too much confusion.
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.680]  I can't get no relief.
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:36.680]  I can't get no relief.
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:42.680]  Ms. Bob Dillon wrote this song, but Demi Hendrix plays it better and sings it better,
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:46.680]  but still it's good to hear the actual author sing it.
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:58.680]  All right, Millie Weaver, our amazing reporter and her amazing co-team, Gavin Wentz and others
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:33:59.680]  about to join us.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:01.280]  I want to get her back home with us this week.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:04.680]  She got there within two hours of the tragic events in Pittsburgh.
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:05.680]  Amazing interviews at infowars.com.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:09.840]  We're going to her in just a second, but first, I want to add an addendum on what I was just
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:12.360]  covering last segment.
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:19.960]  You think about Lou Dobbs, who's been number one on television, a great journalist and
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:25.240]  impeccable research, judicial watch, credible research, the documents that George Soros and
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:33.000]  the Ford Foundation and the U.N. and U.S. taxpayer money through USAID is funding the illegal
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.000]  alien invasion.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:38.680]  And there's child smuggling going on and the Washington Post admits it and Vice President
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:43.880]  Pence says they have that intel and then they have a huge Twitter war and a bunch of harassment
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:52.920]  of Fox News and their sponsors until Fox apologizes and condemns the segment and pulled it from
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:54.600]  their servers.
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:35:01.520]  Fox condemns rhetoric used by Lou Dobbs' guest as Channel's star host faces growing criticism,
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.520]  CNN.
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:05.160]  That's their job, is killing truth, killing other media.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:06.320]  They have no viewers.
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:09.080]  All they do is organize Democrats to engage in fraud.
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:14.640]  We're going to release footage very soon of undercover CNN stalking us.
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:15.640]  We ran their plates.
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:16.640]  We have it all.
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:21.520]  I'm really going to have to take action against them politically and economically and through
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:27.040]  the criminal justice system because they are a terrorist organization, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:28.040]  working against this country.
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:31.240]  They are the enemy of the people, period.
[01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:37.040]  So that's the truth, ladies and gentlemen, and it's just wild to see how these bullies
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:38.040]  work.
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.840]  And America must stand up against them.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:44.480]  Now, I want a Millie Weaver, but I wanted to show these short clips shot this morning
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:46.960]  before he took off to fly back to Austin just hours ago.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:51.800]  Our own Owen Schreuer covering the walk away, hashtag walk away movement that's so successful
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:55.240]  with Democrats saying, no, the Democratic Party in the big red wave, they're trying to suppress
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:56.240]  right now.
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:36:01.200]  But early voting shows huge Republican turnout everywhere, but Florida and a lot of Senate
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.680]  races are neck and neck while they're sampling 15 points more Democrats.
[01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:10.520]  So I wouldn't say that's the case, but barring massive total fraud, we're going to see hold
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.840]  on to the House and the Senate.
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:14.520]  But tomorrow's news today.
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:17.160]  Let's go to thearticleinfowords.com.
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:18.680]  You should share with folks.
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:24.160]  Infowords reporter, Acosta in DC reporting on Kanye black exit clothing line, set of
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:29.920]  Briggs it, Bliggs it, Candace Owens, what an amazing lady should get up with that.
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:34.240]  APC's triggered by Owen Schreuer pointing out rapper encourages hashtag walk away and
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:37.440]  free thinking from fashion culture.
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:42.360]  So he's a matrix breaker, the great Kanye West at every level, he calls me the matrix
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:45.000]  breaker, he's a matrix breaker.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.360]  And let's go to that clip and then to Millie Weaver.
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:51.600]  Here it is today where some folks are still on the plantation.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:57.640]  As Kanye West and Candace Owens are literally leading a brand new cultural revolution for
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:37:01.920]  African Americans in America right now, getting themselves off the Democrat plantation.
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:02.920]  You think I'm crazy, ma'am?
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:03.920]  Why do you think I'm crazy?
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:07.800]  Oh, a hip-hop is back to something I should have added.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:12.360]  He's at the Smithsonian talking in a regular voice, if you're a radio listener, aimed
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:15.280]  at a sign outside and people get pissed at him.
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:16.280]  Go ahead.
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.280]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:18.280]  Continue.
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:19.280]  They hear Kanye West and they get mad.
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:20.280]  Here it is.
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:23.080]  Off the Democrat plantation, you think I'm crazy, ma'am?
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:26.640]  Why do you think I'm crazy?
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.640]  I love that they're showing the hate.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.440]  Here's the hate.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.440]  Now he's coming up to me.
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.440]  Look at it.
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:33.440]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:34.440]  What is your deal, dude?
[01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:35.440]  Move away from me now.
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:37.640]  Dude, you literally came up to me.
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:38.640]  Here we go.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:39.640]  She just knocked my head off.
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:40.640]  Thanks, guys.
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:41.640]  No, no.
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:42.640]  Thank you guys for showing the hate.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:45.480]  Thank you guys so much for showing the hate out here.
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:47.040]  Thank you for showing the world how hateful you are.
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.040]  Notice how the left are.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.640]  They always attack and they say, isn't it perfect?
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:51.640]  It's fine.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:52.640]  No, it's fine.
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:54.920]  Thank you guys for showing the world how hateful you are.
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:38:00.080]  You guys are still in the cult, but you guys can get out of the cult.
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:02.200]  This is how cult people behave.
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:05.000]  So they choose not to be part of the African-American...
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.080]  And our audio is not cutting out.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:08.080]  We're cutting this.
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:09.080]  That's fine.
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:10.080]  No, I understand.
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:12.280]  You don't want to be on film showing the world how hateful you are, but you're too
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:13.280]  late.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:14.280]  You already did.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:15.280]  You already did.
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:16.280]  Yeah, they're in public.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:17.280]  Suck butt, she says.
[01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:18.280]  They came over and attacked him.
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:20.080]  That's always fun, folks.
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:24.880]  It's always fun to put your Superman cape on and let the left show their hate.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.280]  All right, I'm going to Millie Weaver, but I want to play one more clip.
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:33.000]  This is Owen at the same area, and a bunch of college students, or the high school students,
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.720]  the articles on m4s.com, they're fans.
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:39.120]  It's college students, and the professor comes over and goes, God, don't talk...
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:40.120]  But they know who Owen is.
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:45.200]  Owen's got hundreds of millions of views like Millie online, till they deleted them all,
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:47.320]  and probably billions, actually.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:49.960]  Some of Owen's videos have like 50 million views apiece.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:51.440]  And so, oh, we love Owen.
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:56.120]  Oh, no, the controller comes over to say, you don't talk to him.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:57.200]  That's a cult, folks.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:58.400]  Here it is.
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:02.080]  The people that don't like Trump and don't like m4s, they're mean, they're hateful, they
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:03.880]  call you names, they flick you off.
[01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:06.400]  Some of them even get aggressive and physically violent.
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:10.840]  Oh, but then you run into people that, you know, like us and like Trump.
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:11.840]  What are they?
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:12.840]  They're nice.
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:13.840]  They're loving people.
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:14.840]  They have a conversation.
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:20.840]  So, it's really just incredible, the dichotomy that can be exhibited in real time just by
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.800]  wearing this hat.
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:28.560]  And that's part of the Superman cape analogy, is that it gives you the power, when you put
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:31.640]  on this hat, to go into the matrix.
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:35.000]  It's almost like putting on the glasses and they live, right?
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:41.560]  You put on the glasses, and then you can see things for what they really are, and not how
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:43.600]  they're being presented.
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.160]  So that's amazing.
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:48.560]  So what if we got, look, you guys, are you guys lovers?
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:52.440]  Yes, sir, where are you guys from?
[01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.440]  Alex Jones.
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:54.440]  LA.
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:56.440]  Are you guys out here on vacation?
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:57.440]  No, I would.
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:58.440]  So what?
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.920]  So they shouldn't be on camera without parents permission?
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:01.920]  We're alone.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:02.920]  I'm 17.
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:04.920]  So I guess this guy, this guy must not be a fan.
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:05.920]  All right.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:06.920]  Hey, you guys have a blessed day.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:07.920]  You too, Owen.
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:08.920]  Say, hey, hey.
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:09.920]  Thank you, man.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:10.920]  So those are college students.
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:11.920]  Amen, brother.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:12.920]  Amen.
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:17.320]  You can see their college, high school, but they don't want to be on camera unless he
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:18.320]  says so.
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.320]  Okay.
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:20.320]  All right.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.320]  Well, that's good.
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:22.320]  Full video up on infowars.com.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.320]  Millie Weaver.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.320]  A lot going on.
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:26.440]  We'll have another segment to get more into things, but you were there.
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:31.480]  You were literally just feet away from where these poor people got murdered, having a baby
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:34.320]  naming ceremony, and all of this is going crazy.
[01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:37.880]  Millie Weaver, reporter for infowars.com, doing a great job.
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:38.880]  I keep saying great job.
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:41.480]  He's such an amazing job.
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:44.560]  What in the world do you think is going on with nine days out from the election?
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:50.480]  Well, I don't know if this necessarily has to do anything with the election, but I know
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:56.240]  that the Democrats are going to try to use it all they can for their own political agenda
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:03.100]  to try to demonize Trump supporters and conservatives when they won't report the fact that this
[01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:08.520]  gunman who went down there and gunned down these innocent Jewish people in this synagogue
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.040]  hated Trump.
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:11.240]  He didn't like Trump.
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:20.080]  He called Trump a globalist, apparently Trump was too pro-Jewish for an actual anti-Semite,
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:22.920]  and that's what the left doesn't want to acknowledge right there.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:29.120]  When we found out about the Boston bomber that that had a Trump supporter as the suspect
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:34.960]  who was going to be arrested in that, they went all day on their platforms and shouted
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:40.880]  from the rooftops that a Trump supporter was responsible for this, but they won't say
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:46.000]  that this person was a Trump hater that did this synagogue shooting.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.560]  That's something you won't hear from the mainstream media.
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:57.320]  And it gets crazier because the guy's saying Trump's a globalist, Trump's pro-Israel, he's
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:01.160]  controlled by the Jews and all this, so they kind of halfway blamed Trump and then dropped
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:05.920]  it and now they're blaming free speech and gab.com, who again, lets a lot of folks on
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:06.920]  it.
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:07.920]  People say, oh, well, whatever.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:08.920]  Let them get rid of that website.
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:11.120]  That's not for everybody's website.
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:16.320]  Well, yeah, I mean, they're going to go after free speech as a whole.
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:21.760]  And this kind of, if you remember back when I was talking about possible false flags,
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:25.640]  now, I'm not saying this is a false flag, but I was saying that there was a possibility
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:31.640]  of things happening that could be used to justify further censorship on social media
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:34.800]  and a social media ID.
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:37.280]  This could be used to try to push for that.
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:39.840]  Oh, I think everything's suspicious.
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:43.000]  The pipe bombs we predicted and that whole thing doesn't add up.
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.440]  All of this should be investigated.
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:48.120]  We'll come back when we were eight and a half days out.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.880]  What's going to happen next?
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:57.680]  Stay with us, infowars.com, news wars, newswars.com.
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:02.880]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:07.300]  News wars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:11.480]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:13.480]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:16.840]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:19.040]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:21.760]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:26.680]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:31.520]  why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us and if you spread
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:37.200]  the word about our articles and videos, infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:40.200]  these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:44.840]  We have huge sales, infowars.com, right now, and we're still able to operate the shopping
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:48.320]  cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:50.280]  and you're right to the market.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:53.960]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Global is going to win.
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:57.120]  This is infowars.com, we're your support, I'm counting on you.
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:01.760]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.

[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:56.040]  being huge infowar supporters, it scared them to death, it's why they want to extinguish
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:01.560]  us but you won't let them.
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:27.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:32.640]  Urban Weaver, infowars.com, host is riding Schock done with us, the article is up on
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:39.820]  infowars.com, let's put up the top infowars.com article for everybody please, for TV viewers
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:47.020]  and radio listeners, it is The World Exclusive, The Head Of Gab, dot-com who did not call
[01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:51.160]  for violence, who has a libertarian site, liberal conservative, everybody can be on
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:56.860]  it, and they're blaming him because this guy had an account, he had an Instagram, he had
[01:47:56.860 --> 01:47:59.460]  He had a Facebook, he had a Twitter.
[01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:04.740]  He had all of that and he didn't say I'm going to kill anybody on Gab, but even conservatives
[01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:08.380]  are saying they don't have a right to exist now, get rid of them.
[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:10.020]  Gab did not kill anybody.
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:12.300]  No social media post ever killed anybody.
[01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:17.180]  World exclusive Gab found a response to synagogue massacre and lashes out at lying MSM.
[01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:20.460]  None of them even called him for a quote or even have them on.
[01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:26.140]  They just lie about him to set the president to shut it down, but you can stop them.
[01:48:26.140 --> 01:48:29.860]  Everything we do here is free to air for radio host, TV host, I always get emails like from
[01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:31.300]  radio host, can I play a clip of your show?
[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:32.580]  It's fair use, play it all.
[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:36.060]  But yes, you have my explicit total license, use it all.
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:37.060]  We're all free to air.
[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:42.300]  That means air it, infowars.com, newswars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:44.780]  Get the articles, get them out, get the videos out.
[01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:47.100]  They're trying to ban Gab now, not just info wars.
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:48.100]  What's next?
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:50.300]  Lou Dobbs, Sean Hannity, Donald Trump.
[01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:53.060]  They want Donald Trump off Twitter.
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:56.980]  Not letting these people, it's like a lion and the lion tamer has a little whip, but
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:49:02.820]  he has that lion intimidated and I'm sick of it.
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:05.300]  Stop acting like they're God.
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:08.980]  Millie Weaver, I appreciate you joining us today.
[01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:13.260]  So just getting into your observations, eight days out now, eight and a half days out.
[01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:16.580]  What you saw in Pittsburgh, you know, talking to locals.
[01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:18.780]  What you think's coming next is you're a smart cookie.
[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:23.820]  Well, you know, Alex, I just want to say something on the situation where the media
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:29.620]  is trying to blame Gab somehow because this person used their social media network.
[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:31.060]  It's just not logical.
[01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:33.740]  The left likes to have double standards.
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:40.140]  Most of the shooters and bombers of past terror events all had various social media
[01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:43.380]  accounts on Twitter and Facebook and so on and so forth.
[01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:47.780]  And yet these social media accounts or social media platforms weren't blamed.
[01:49:47.780 --> 01:49:52.020]  So now they're trying to use this to justify blaming Gab AI and holding them responsible
[01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:58.380]  for something that they actually aren't under the Section 230 Communications Decency Act,
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:50:04.420]  which these social media platforms that are open, neutral public forums have protections
[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:07.980]  in so they aren't liable for something somebody necessarily says.
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:11.380]  Now it's a different story if they were actually plotting it on social media, but there's no
[01:50:11.380 --> 01:50:15.740]  indication that this individual was plotting it rather than they were just using the platform
[01:50:15.740 --> 01:50:21.540]  to say free speech, which theirs in this case was very anti-Semitic and very bigoted.
[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:26.260]  Now I want to point this out, many of the people that we talked to that were standing
[01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:32.220]  around that were residents of this neighborhood for the Tree of Life synagogue that recently
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:38.580]  was shot up with a mass shooting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:46.380]  These people said that, hey, if there had been armed security there, we could have minimized
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:47.860]  the casualties.
[01:50:47.860 --> 01:50:50.860]  There could have been less loss of life.
[01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:55.380]  And that was one of the interesting things that sparked up following this is that you
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:51:00.420]  had many members of this Jewish community talking about whether or not they should have
[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:05.620]  had guns to protect themselves, given that there are a lot of anti-Semitic, hateful people
[01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:09.460]  out there that would target the Jewish community.
[01:51:09.460 --> 01:51:17.500]  We know that Hitler, who was the biggest Jew-hater of all, knew how important it was to disarm
[01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:19.860]  people that you wanted to kill.
[01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:25.540]  We know that Hitler took the guns prior to shipping off all of these innocent Jewish
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:29.700]  people to concentration camps and then exterminating them.
[01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:36.340]  So of any group of people, the Jewish people have been persecuted very much so.
[01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:41.300]  So they saw the importance of having that right to protect themselves.
[01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:43.860]  And that was what kind of instantly sparked up in the neighborhood.
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:48.980]  Now, of course, you're going to have your liberals there that believe that more gun
[01:51:48.980 --> 01:51:50.620]  control is the answer.
[01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:56.180]  But a large amount of the community there was Orthodox Jewish people that are more conservative
[01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:57.180]  leaning.
[01:51:57.180 --> 01:51:59.180]  For example, like how Ben Shapiro is.
[01:51:59.180 --> 01:52:02.380]  A lot of them share more conservative viewpoints.
[01:52:02.380 --> 01:52:06.260]  And we had some interesting interviews with them, and hopefully we could get around to
[01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:08.260]  playing some of those clips, Alex.
[01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:12.660]  Well, we're out of time basically now, but we're going to have those tomorrow during
[01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:13.660]  the weekday show.
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:17.620]  They're all posted to infowars.com to newswars.com.
[01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:22.980]  And the only way any of this key stuff gets seen is if listeners, again, get excited,
[01:52:22.980 --> 01:52:27.500]  have that chain reaction, tell folks about the local stations or listener watching, or
[01:52:27.500 --> 01:52:34.380]  spread the word about infowars.com or newswars.com and get these articles out because it is amazing
[01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:40.060]  and what you're covering and what you're exposing, Millie, is not in the mainstream.
[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:41.780]  It's either right wing or left wing.
[01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:44.220]  It's not just America, one in common sense.
[01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:47.980]  But listen, we predicted the shootings at liberal facilities.
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:49.940]  We predicted the bombings.
[01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:53.500]  The left kept saying it's coming, it's coming before the election with no proof.
[01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:54.500]  Now it's happening.
[01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:59.060]  I don't know exactly what's going on, but it's very, very suspicious, the whole thing.
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:04.140]  And I really am cringing, Millie, in the next eight days before the election of what they're
[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:05.140]  going to pull.
[01:53:05.140 --> 01:53:06.140]  Oh, yeah.
[01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:07.500]  I mean, who knows what's next?
[01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:12.380]  We know that during October surprise season, anything is possible.
[01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:17.860]  One thing I will say that's very interesting, that did actually creep up into on a mainstream
[01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:21.380]  media site on Facebook, CBS was streaming.
[01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:24.580]  And there was an interview with one of the CBS reporters who was there.
[01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:28.740]  She interviewed the former president of the Tree of Life synagogue.
[01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:33.500]  And he was talking about how they were actually anticipating an event like this and that they
[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:39.060]  were working with the city of Pittsburgh's emergency management planning people and
[01:53:39.060 --> 01:53:41.900]  talking about how they could better mitigate a shooter type of situation.
[01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:43.180]  No, I saw that a month ago.
[01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:44.180]  They had how much security there.
[01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:48.140]  And I'm not, look, the poor liberals, I mean, I really feel sorry for them.
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:50.180]  Kerry, concealed Kerry, have guns.
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:54.660]  You've got a synagogue or you're what, I mean, you better have guns in Israel.
[01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:56.660]  The synagogues have guns.
[01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:58.100]  You're a target protect.
[01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:00.780]  You can't call 911 and wait five minutes.
[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:06.100]  God, the cops got there fast and they engage in like five minutes, but people were dead
[01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:07.100]  by there.
[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:08.940]  So just protect yourself.
[01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:09.940]  Good Lord.
[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:14.540]  And there are some synagogues in the area, according to some of the residents that do
[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:15.940]  actually arm themselves.
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:16.940]  I saw that.
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:17.940]  In fact, most of them do.
[01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:19.420]  Notice this guy didn't target that.
[01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:20.420]  Very suspicious.
[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:24.260]  We should look into this guy because I'm worried about liberals doing false flags.
[01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:27.820]  They figure out the way to get us now is to create an MO about themselves online and
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:28.820]  then do something.
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:32.620]  They hate Trump and America so much that they would go stage something, not the synagogue,
[01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:36.780]  not the Jewish folks, but, but, but this guy, there's this whole thing is so suspicious.
[01:54:36.780 --> 01:54:38.260]  Millie Weaver will be tracking it all.
[01:54:38.260 --> 01:54:41.780]  I know you're going to be on the campaign trail the next eight days and then the aftermath
[01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:45.020]  in DC in full wars.com tomorrow's news today.
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:46.020]  Thank you so much.
[01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:47.020]  Millie Weaver.
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:48.020]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:51.140]  And finally, again, just not south of the park every time.
[01:54:51.140 --> 01:54:52.140]  Okay.
[01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:56.420]  I covered most of it, but I'll go back to this NYC professor and all the rest of the same
[01:54:56.420 --> 01:55:01.500]  kill, pants, kill, Trump, he's behind the group, harassing Republicans and restaurants.
[01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:06.620]  They have their Twitters with hundreds and hundreds of thousands of followers calling
[01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:12.140]  for attacking people, calling for violence and then gab just allows people to have their
[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:16.500]  own Twitter and their own system and the guy didn't even call for violence on there.
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:22.180]  And then they are being de-platformed everywhere because big corporate tech and, and big media
[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:24.380]  don't want competition.
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:30.140]  Just like they don't want info wars.com or news wars.com or blue dobs or Sean Hannity
[01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:34.740]  or Rush Limbaugh or anybody else that isn't anti America, they're a bunch of bullies instead
[01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:35.740]  of kissing their butt.
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:36.740]  It's time to say no.
[01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:37.740]  Okay.
[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:39.340]  Counter think with Mike Adams.
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:41.020]  He tapes a new show every week for you.
[01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:45.060]  It's always hard hitting when this show ends on radio and TV on the satellite and on the
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:49.460]  streams at info wars.com, Ford's last show will be counter think with Mike Adams always
[01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:53.740]  informative and then tomorrow 8am will be here.
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:57.820]  But if I'm up at midnight and there's some big event or something happening, I'm going
[01:55:57.820 --> 01:55:58.820]  to drive in here.
[01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:01.780]  I'm going to call crew and we'll be live.
[01:56:01.780 --> 01:56:02.980]  Even though we don't have the crew to do this.
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:03.980]  I'm not complaining.
[01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:05.140]  I'm saying we're committed.
[01:56:05.140 --> 01:56:06.140]  We're here.
[01:56:06.140 --> 01:56:08.500]  That's why your financial support is so critical.

[01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:15.660]  case is.

[01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:33.820]  processors.

[01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:38.540]  We got backups now, but the sales things were selling out of so much.
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:40.300]  The X2 is the last run.
[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:45.380]  Female vitality is the last run, we're about to sell out of super female vitality.
