[00:00.000 --> 00:22.600]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance
[00:22.600 --> 00:38.280]  is Alex Jones. What is it that Jonathan Gruber said on C-SPAN and to college campuses,
[00:38.280 --> 00:47.520]  even on CNN? He said, thank God Americans don't have an attention span. That's how we get our
[00:47.520 --> 00:55.800]  agenda through over the people. That's the same thing. George Soros, Big Foundations,
[00:55.800 --> 01:05.400]  most of Fortune 100, have contributed over a billion dollars, conservatively the last six,
[01:05.400 --> 01:14.400]  seven years, to fomenting race war in America. They push all over the news that whites are
[01:14.400 --> 01:18.520]  inherently evil. The opposite of what Martin Luther King said, he said you judge people off
[01:18.520 --> 01:23.480]  of what they actually do and what they stand for. That makes sense. When he plays good music,
[01:23.480 --> 01:27.280]  I go listen to him. I don't care what color they are. Somebody's got good food, I go eat at their
[01:27.280 --> 01:34.600]  restaurant. I don't care what color you are. But double crossing the American movement to really
[01:34.600 --> 01:41.120]  be the global leader in being inclusive and open, they flipped it to teach America that
[01:41.120 --> 01:48.440]  we're the most closed, racist, backwards nation. Then they've double crossed the social compact
[01:48.440 --> 01:55.560]  that Christian whites mainly made to make this country free and open. The globalists used our
[01:55.560 --> 02:02.120]  strength of true diversity to bring in the quote minority groups and then to turn them into race
[02:02.120 --> 02:07.600]  based combines. But the minority groups overall have not bought into that. But they are led by the
[02:07.600 --> 02:14.240]  Antifa, by the Communist, by the Ford Foundation, by the Carnegie Endowment, by the George Soros
[02:14.240 --> 02:23.680]  groups. And it's all public. It's admitted. So when I say that this event yesterday in
[02:23.680 --> 02:28.600]  Charlottesville, Virginia was a false flag, we're going to lay out the proof today. A false flag
[02:28.600 --> 02:32.720]  doesn't mean it was purely staged, but the atmosphere, the preparation, the Antifa being
[02:32.720 --> 02:39.640]  shipped in, the police kettling the nationalists, white nationalists in a mix of groups to then
[02:39.640 --> 02:45.400]  force them out into a confrontation with the Antifa, who then viciously attacked them first.
[02:45.400 --> 02:51.640]  That's just the facts. And the media spins it that they quote, white nationalists did it. Then
[02:51.640 --> 02:56.280]  they connect the white nationalists to any conservative libertarian movement, thus demonizing
[02:56.280 --> 03:02.520]  conservatives in general. That's the false flag. But I decry the white supremacists that were there
[03:02.520 --> 03:07.440]  trying to lead it, trying to have publicity stunts, because they're just feeding into the whole
[03:07.440 --> 03:12.120]  thing and becoming what they claim they're fighting, which is pushed by George Soros and all
[03:12.120 --> 03:18.560]  these other groups. The White House really did a great job. The president and also his homeland
[03:18.560 --> 03:25.600]  security spokesman, Tom Bossard, have come out and saying both sides were complex groups,
[03:25.600 --> 03:31.760]  but both sides had groups in them that came looking for a fight. And we decry division,
[03:31.760 --> 03:35.800]  we decry all this racism, garbage, and we should love each other in America and come
[03:35.800 --> 03:43.320]  together. But this should also be investigated to see who is exacerbating this. That is absolutely
[03:43.320 --> 03:48.560]  on target. That's exactly what I'd already said in live video feeds, waiting for the
[03:48.560 --> 03:54.480]  president's statement. And then Bossard came out and said word for word, what I said, not
[03:54.480 --> 03:59.040]  they were getting it from me, but because they were studying what's going on and what's happening.
[03:59.040 --> 04:05.520]  They're also always beating this drum that Bannon is a white nationalist and that Breitbart
[04:05.520 --> 04:11.120]  is with no proof. And they're saying he should be removed because they know he's a key patriot
[04:11.120 --> 04:18.040]  in the White House because of that hoax. It's like Tom Brokaw with Megan Kelly saying I'm
[04:18.040 --> 04:25.840]  quote an unalloyed. That means a complete racist. You think if you were going to say
[04:25.840 --> 04:30.240]  that you'd show me saying the racist thing. Well, actually, you could just show hours
[04:30.240 --> 04:38.040]  of me protesting the KKK back when it wasn't cool 18, 19 years ago. So we're going to break
[04:38.040 --> 04:43.640]  it all down the other side. And our reporters were there, Gavin Wentz and Millie Weaver,
[04:43.640 --> 04:48.360]  lot of courage. They both got attacked with pepper spray, you name it, by the Antifa.
[04:48.360 --> 04:52.920]  And so did Hill reporters and others that were there on the side of Antifa. But if he didn't
[04:52.920 --> 05:01.520]  look like a communist, you would get attacked. Please listen carefully, because I'm about
[05:01.520 --> 05:05.560]  to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality
[05:05.560 --> 05:10.960]  products and fund the Info War, a 360 win. Number one, when you choose auto ship before

[05:20.760 --> 05:26.320]  back a surplus for auto ship customers. Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all
[05:26.320 --> 05:32.280]  orders above $50. Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget
[05:32.280 --> 05:36.480]  to reorder the products that you need each month. Just go to infowarestore.com, select

[05:56.520 --> 06:04.520]  are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[06:04.520 --> 06:19.840]  Number five, from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[06:19.840 --> 06:23.280]  You know, there's a lot of different types of people in the world. A lot of folks just
[06:23.280 --> 06:28.560]  go with the flow. Whatever they think is popular. Other people try to figure out how the world
[06:28.560 --> 06:35.920]  works, but are really too busy to spend the time to understand it. And of course, there's
[06:35.920 --> 06:41.240]  people out there trying to use this information to manipulate folks. Those folks think they're
[06:41.240 --> 06:48.880]  God. Like Jonathan Gruber, who helped write Obamacare. He said, thank God, the public's
[06:48.880 --> 06:53.840]  so stupid. Thank God, you don't pay attention. Thank God, you have the attention span of
[06:53.840 --> 07:00.440]  a goldfish. And I found real success in this world is about being determined, focused and
[07:00.440 --> 07:07.560]  having a memory. Even if you're a bad guy, focused, determined, have a memory, study
[07:07.560 --> 07:16.160]  history, and at least be loyal to those right around you. But most people are so self-centered
[07:16.160 --> 07:21.400]  that they're delusional and they lie to themselves about what's happening. When I lay out what
[07:21.400 --> 07:27.720]  happened in Charlottesville, Virginia, you're going to get the most focused, documented
[07:27.720 --> 07:35.560]  facts based in what happened yesterday, the aftermath and how they're using it to try
[07:35.560 --> 07:42.880]  to restrict free speech nationwide. And of course, the past. And that's why what I said
[07:42.880 --> 07:49.240]  yesterday before Trump ever spoke basically word for word, what he said. And then his
[07:49.240 --> 07:54.080]  spokesman from Homeland Security, Tom Bossett came out, Bossett said exactly the same thing
[07:54.080 --> 07:58.360]  as well. Not because I'm that smart or they're even that smart, but because they're actually
[07:58.360 --> 08:09.000]  studying history and reality. Remember what Gruber said, thank God, you're so effing dumb.
[08:09.000 --> 08:13.480]  Thank God you have no memory. Thank God you have the memory of a goldfish. Thank God you
[08:13.480 --> 08:18.720]  have low attention spans. Those are all exact quotes. I'm going to play the clips again.
[08:18.720 --> 08:27.120]  What are the two groups attacking each other have in common? Both groups believed that
[08:27.120 --> 08:34.680]  they were doing the right thing. Both groups were being led like useful idiots to the slaughter.
[08:34.680 --> 08:41.520]  I mean, it's a fact. George Soros is funding the Antifa, which is racist, anti-white, anti-America,
[08:41.520 --> 08:47.640]  anti-free market, anti-private property scum. And I've gone out and protested them just like
[08:47.640 --> 08:53.560]  I protested the KKK and other gang-related racist moron groups that are every time getting
[08:53.560 --> 08:59.680]  caught led by foundations, led by the Southern Poverty Law Center, led by other organizations
[08:59.680 --> 09:04.280]  that want to create the division that they can then control.
[09:04.280 --> 09:10.760]  So we're going to go through it all today. And we've got our reporters, Gavin Wentz and
[09:10.760 --> 09:15.360]  of course Millie Weaver joining us at the bottom of the hour. They were there yesterday as
[09:15.360 --> 09:25.080]  part of their traveling across the land, flyover country, dramatic hours of footage raw on infowars.com.
[09:25.080 --> 09:33.280]  I've got a staff of five people here on the weekend, but we can't air these tapes because
[09:33.280 --> 09:39.120]  all the Antifa's doing is cussing and screaming the entire time. It took many, many hours
[09:39.120 --> 09:42.680]  just to watch all the footage, much less bleep it. We're going to play some of it that's
[09:42.680 --> 09:47.880]  true. But it's the so-called anti-fascists who dress like fascists in black, who are
[09:47.880 --> 09:52.880]  anti-free speech. I mean, they are what they say they aren't, going over attacking women
[09:52.880 --> 09:59.920]  reporters, not just infowars, but the Hill and others. It's on video. The Hill is ravenously
[09:59.920 --> 10:07.240]  pro-sauros, ravenously anti-Trump. They don't care. If you look at the ne'er-do-well drooling
[10:07.240 --> 10:16.340]  scum, white, black, Hispanic, mainly white, of the Antifa, you will then see similar
[10:16.340 --> 10:23.880]  type scummy people in the white supremacist ranks. Who were the minority of the overall
[10:23.880 --> 10:29.400]  group that got lured there by the media running the headlines that this was an alt-right event?
[10:29.400 --> 10:37.320]  Hillary, nine months ago, about a month before the election, says Alex Jones as the leader
[10:37.320 --> 10:44.160]  of the alt-right. She created the name Democratic Party think tanks did. Podesta was on record.
[10:44.160 --> 10:52.440]  They said it's he's racist, he's evil. Then they start calling white supremacist groups
[10:52.440 --> 10:58.120]  alt-right so that when they have their rallies that they always have, you can call them all
[10:58.120 --> 11:02.560]  alt-right. This is simple, semantical games and it goes from there. That's why I'm saying
[11:02.560 --> 11:05.680]  it's a false flag. Not that the whole thing was completely staged. There's different
[11:05.680 --> 11:10.320]  types of false flags. You create the atmosphere, you fund the groups, you give it hype, you
[11:10.320 --> 11:17.760]  have the police order by the Democratic mayor, 80-plus percent vote for Hillary, Michael
[11:17.760 --> 11:23.640]  Singer of Charlottesville, Virginia. You have them order everybody, oh, you're not allowed
[11:23.640 --> 11:27.760]  to march. Then there's the federal lawsuit, the judge says, oh, you can march, but here,
[11:27.760 --> 11:32.000]  they kettle you, which is a riot police term where they march you down through barricades
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.240]  to a controlled area surrounded by police and fences. Then there's a few fights between
[11:38.240 --> 11:45.240]  Antifa and media they're beating up, you name it. Anybody wearing an American flag? Anybody
[11:45.240 --> 11:49.440]  that looks clean cut? Anybody that looks like they got their act together? You know, a Hill
[11:49.440 --> 11:57.320]  reporter out there lovingly demonizing the right-wing marchers, just worshipful, absolutely
[11:57.320 --> 12:02.240]  just Antifa is God, it's Horosus Lord, Trump is evil, just savaging and the reports are
[12:02.240 --> 12:05.920]  out there and then if you're going to get Antifa watched right over, just punch us right
[12:05.920 --> 12:14.920]  in the face. That footage is up on infowars.com. Headline, Antifa attacks are anti-racist.
[12:14.920 --> 12:21.800]  Oh, yes. Punches the woman in the face. Same thing happening to countless other reporters
[12:21.800 --> 12:27.640]  because they were white and it's white people doing most of it because they want to show
[12:27.640 --> 12:32.160]  off. My reporters and myself all over the country, I'll be out covering an event and
[12:32.160 --> 12:37.880]  white men and white women walk over. That's who does it and says, you are a white male
[12:37.880 --> 12:42.680]  and you have no right to be here or speak. And then they start attacking you. Everybody
[12:42.680 --> 12:47.240]  is seeing the famous footage. You're an effing white male and it's a white guy screaming at
[12:47.240 --> 12:53.440]  Rob Do. So they want to show off that they're not this racist, that they're the good guy.
[12:53.440 --> 12:56.920]  Same type of folks that buy lottery tickets, they're going to be a millionaire next week.
[12:56.920 --> 13:01.280]  It's just hype. They just watch mainstream media, they get out, they get into it and
[13:01.280 --> 13:10.840]  they go hop around and yell and scream. I mean, it is ridiculous. And then all the crazy,
[13:10.840 --> 13:17.760]  crazy videos of black folks with butcher knives. Let's grab that video. I forgot to say that
[13:17.760 --> 13:22.240]  there it is. Final warning to white people, those viral on Twitter after Charlottesville
[13:22.240 --> 13:26.920]  rally and just saying white people, we're just going to kill you period to see all white
[13:26.920 --> 13:33.160]  people are bad. Isn't that what the KKK saying about black people? It's the exact same mindless
[13:33.160 --> 13:38.440]  tribal garbage that the globalists want to instill into us for divide and conquer to
[13:38.440 --> 13:43.840]  make us fighting with each other. What happens politically instead of us organizing together
[13:43.840 --> 13:48.440]  against the elite that are ending America, bringing in globalism, driving down wages,
[13:48.440 --> 13:56.120]  trying to make us a permanent poor underclass. It truly is incredible. And then we have the
[13:56.120 --> 14:04.680]  backdrop of all this. We have the organizer who they call alt-right. Then the media lies
[14:04.680 --> 14:10.680]  and says that it was white supremacist violence. That's not defending some of the nerdy wells
[14:10.680 --> 14:15.800]  that were there and people I disagree with, but it was the antifa who started the fights
[14:15.800 --> 14:20.680]  attack the people. Then one person has run over and killed. Who knows what happened with
[14:20.680 --> 14:27.240]  that? But again, it's all about projecting 15 minutes into it starting. I said, you watch,
[14:27.240 --> 14:31.840]  they're going to say ban conservative and Republican public gatherings. They're going
[14:31.840 --> 14:37.960]  to say call for new laws that goes after the alt-right. Again, it's not the alt-right.
[14:37.960 --> 14:42.280]  As Paul Watson said nine months ago in tweets he put out, let's pull up Paul Watson's tweets.
[14:42.280 --> 14:47.400]  He retweeted today. He said the alt-right is Hillary's term to put on opposition to
[14:47.400 --> 14:53.920]  her and then they're going to tie the alt-right to white supremacists in a rabbit trick and
[14:53.920 --> 14:59.680]  fool everybody. That's what I said as well. And it's memorialized by videos and articles
[14:59.680 --> 15:06.880]  we put out because that's what they've always done. I mean, why do you think I didn't like
[15:06.880 --> 15:11.280]  the clan to begin with? But like 18, 19 years ago, they'd say on the news, you know, Alex
[15:11.280 --> 15:17.080]  Jones might be KKK because he's pro-gun. So when the KKK came to town, I'd go out and
[15:17.080 --> 15:21.920]  protest. It'll be very clear. I wasn't with them. They never show that when Tom Brokaw
[15:21.920 --> 15:29.880]  says I'm unalloyed racist. Scroll down a bit more. It's there where he condemns it.
[15:29.880 --> 15:35.560]  We're going to come back though. And that's Jack Passovic. It's Paul Watson. I'll show
[15:35.560 --> 15:39.960]  you during the break. Paul Watson retweeted. He put out from nine months ago on Prison
[15:39.960 --> 15:44.680]  Planet. That's his Twitter. I'm at real Alex Jones. But I'll get through all that evidence
[15:44.680 --> 15:48.640]  to play the video coming up. What I'm going to do right now is come back with Trump's
[15:48.640 --> 15:53.920]  statement, analyze it, and then what his homeland security spokesman said that's dead on. This
[15:53.920 --> 15:59.840]  was clearly a shaken bank to demonize the Make America Grading Agenda. Thousands of
[15:59.840 --> 16:05.800]  years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war,
[16:05.800 --> 16:11.320]  giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense. Sixty years
[16:11.320 --> 16:17.240]  ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their
[16:17.240 --> 16:24.440]  own air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war. Pathogens
[16:24.440 --> 16:29.480]  added to the food and water and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn
[16:29.480 --> 16:35.560]  off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter this onslaught
[16:35.560 --> 16:42.840]  with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create
[16:42.840 --> 16:49.360]  the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body. Discover why Anthroplex

[17:57.880 --> 18:02.880]  Today I'm excited to announce the new limited shipment of DNA Forces Finally Arrived, the
[18:02.880 --> 18:07.600]  M4 warehouse in Austin, Texas. We have thousands of listeners on the waiting list who've signed

[19:08.840 --> 19:13.120]  a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where
[19:13.120 --> 19:18.320]  the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans. We have now managed to secure
[19:18.320 --> 19:24.240]  the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend. Discover and try a bag of the Patriot

[19:40.040 --> 19:45.080]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers. Drop by the site today, order a bag or two
[19:45.080 --> 19:49.440]  and I don't think you're going to be disappointed. Available in original or with our immune support

[20:25.440 --> 20:32.040]  So everybody's seen the last seven, eight years, the Justice Department ordering stand-downs
[20:32.040 --> 20:42.160]  in major cities like D.C., like Baltimore, Maryland, other areas and actually having
[20:42.160 --> 20:47.120]  the Justice Department go out and finance radical black racist groups to go out and
[20:47.120 --> 20:53.080]  cause riots, CNN saying, well cops are getting killed, cops are bad, so cops deserve to be
[20:53.080 --> 21:00.080]  killed, shot in the back while they're pumping gas. This is an attempt to foment civil discord.
[21:01.840 --> 21:08.640]  So then the power structure can come in and call for controls and clampdowns on society.
[21:08.640 --> 21:13.680]  And whereas I'm not somebody to just bash police out of hand, I got this from Millie
[21:13.680 --> 21:18.520]  Weaver, I got it from Gavin Wentz, our reporters, I saw the footage, I've seen the footage from
[21:18.520 --> 21:24.800]  The Hill, I spent hours yesterday, live, and hours today just researching. I probably spent
[21:24.800 --> 21:30.920]  eight, nine hours the last day on this. And the police are on video and they're uploading
[21:30.920 --> 21:36.760]  it right now, they're still in Virginia, laughing at our reporters when they get pepper sprayed
[21:36.760 --> 21:50.080]  by the fascist, by the race-based leftist race pushers, the Soros KKK groups. And they
[21:50.080 --> 21:56.040]  wouldn't let anybody get out of the cordoned area and then force them into the antifa who
[21:56.040 --> 22:03.060]  was allowed to attack them and didn't get in trouble. And they would see our Info Wars
[22:03.060 --> 22:09.000]  microphone flag and say, ah, screw you, F.U. I mean, I'm showing some of this for TV viewers
[22:09.000 --> 22:13.360]  right now if you're watching us at infowars.com forward slash show. And literally there's
[22:13.360 --> 22:18.080]  dozens of videos we posted to Info Wars from YouTube, Facebook, you name it, raw feeds,
[22:18.080 --> 22:22.280]  live feeds, you name it. But I can't play these because the antifogists, they don't
[22:22.280 --> 22:31.920]  even talk, they go, eh, seriously, they go, eh, like Reavers or something. That's a
[22:31.920 --> 22:38.400]  old science fiction movie. Or they just go, F, F, screw, die white, die white, rule, destroy
[22:38.400 --> 22:44.520]  America, kill Trump, kill police. And then the cops are just like, yeah, yeah, like
[22:44.520 --> 22:54.640]  laughing because it's a leftist city. Just like when I tried for three hours to get through,
[22:54.640 --> 23:00.440]  to give my ticket to them, to go to the inauguration, and they had 100,000 plus leftists blocking
[23:00.440 --> 23:05.400]  the entrances to the mall. They had fences up around it. The cops would do nothing in
[23:05.400 --> 23:11.720]  DC. And I mean, I watched them beat up women. I watched them beat up families until I finally
[23:11.720 --> 23:16.640]  started rampaging over people and knocking them down. And the police came over, there's
[23:16.640 --> 23:21.840]  live feeds of all this and then did something. But I said to the police, and I had a security
[23:21.840 --> 23:26.840]  guys with me as well. I said, listen, you stop them now. We're going to hurt them because
[23:26.840 --> 23:32.960]  they were attacking women and children. Now that's the DC police at the time run by Obama.
[23:32.960 --> 23:36.840]  So here's the deal. The media is going to misrepresent what I say. They're going to
[23:36.840 --> 23:40.560]  misrepresent what Trump says. You've got to go watch the footage for yourself. And remember
[23:40.560 --> 23:46.720]  that Soros wound all this up, pushes all this anti white garbage to get white people paranoid
[23:46.720 --> 23:51.280]  to then there's some little couple hundred person rally of some nationalists, some folks
[23:51.280 --> 23:57.040]  just there to see a lot of media, most of them just citizen journalists. And then like 25
[23:57.040 --> 24:01.720]  white nationalists that kind of led it with the media, the leader of it's joining us,
[24:01.720 --> 24:07.880]  this Jason Kessler fellow in the next hour. And I don't decry them. So the media doesn't
[24:07.880 --> 24:12.520]  attack me. I decry the way they handled this and what they're doing because it walks right
[24:12.520 --> 24:17.760]  into a trap. And because I've already protested this white national stuff, because it just
[24:17.760 --> 24:21.280]  feeds into the globalist system of divide and conquer that everybody gets their own
[24:21.280 --> 24:25.560]  homeland and then the country's broken up into ethnic blocks, which is what the globalists
[24:25.560 --> 24:29.880]  want. Just like we're a prison. Everybody's in their own ethnic area. That's the globalist
[24:29.880 --> 24:36.640]  plan. Why are we absolutely not realizing that and rejecting antify and all them for
[24:36.640 --> 24:42.040]  saying the opposite of what Martin Luther King said. Yeah, here's I mean, there's hours
[24:42.040 --> 24:45.320]  of this online. There's so much cussing. I can't play it. Here's a little bit of audio
[24:45.320 --> 24:51.760]  of me like 18 years ago, protesting the KKK. There's no big crowd of antifa there supporting
[24:51.760 --> 24:56.920]  me and them threatening to kill me. Everything else because and it later came out that they
[24:56.920 --> 25:03.320]  were federal agents. Like I said, wasn't even real. I mean, quite frankly, I've been to
[25:03.320 --> 25:07.440]  these events. A lot of the KKK guys with their hats off look like they're from the cast of
[25:07.440 --> 25:12.640]  Seinfeld. Literally, they're just Jewish actors. Nothing gets Jews in general, but the left
[25:12.640 --> 25:18.200]  is Jews want to create this class and they go dressed up as Nazis at footage in Austin.
[25:18.200 --> 25:20.920]  We're going to find it somewhere here at the office where it literally looks like the cast
[25:20.920 --> 25:25.840]  of Seinfeld or like Howard Stern and the Nazi outfit. They all look like Howard Stern. They've
[25:25.840 --> 25:29.560]  almost got a little curly hair down and they're just up there. Highling Hitler. You tell they're
[25:29.560 --> 25:33.400]  totally uncomfortable. They're totally scared. And it's all just meant to create the clash.
[25:33.400 --> 25:38.120]  Please help us to understand what transpired that fateful day. Help us in our path. You're
[25:38.120 --> 25:43.240]  right. And again, just type in Alex Jones, protest is KKK. Now remember, I'm doing this
[25:43.240 --> 25:48.720]  18, 19 years ago before anybody really is doing it. Okay. Now you got Tom Brokoff saying
[25:48.720 --> 25:54.160]  I am an unalloyed total racist because that's all they've got. That's their weapon. They're
[25:54.160 --> 25:58.640]  the ones invoking race. They're the ones saying white people are inherently bad in the media.
[25:58.640 --> 26:03.120]  They're the ones saying reparations. They're the ones saying that white men are inherently
[26:03.120 --> 26:08.040]  evil. And it's a bunch of white people doing it as a bunch of elites on the 300 million
[26:08.040 --> 26:12.240]  dollar yachts trying to get us all fighting with each other. So let's go to President
[26:12.240 --> 26:17.680]  Trump's statement on this. And then the media said, oh, he didn't decry racism. And then
[26:17.680 --> 26:21.200]  he would show the full quotes of what he said about loving each other and decrying racism.
[26:21.200 --> 26:25.640]  Or they say he didn't respond quick enough. Within two hours of it starting, he was already
[26:25.640 --> 26:32.320]  on TV giving a statement. But everything he does, they invert, they turn it and that's
[26:32.320 --> 26:36.720]  up just defending Trump. Scarimucci, look at him. Trump isn't harsh enough on white
[26:36.720 --> 26:40.320]  supremacists. He's mad at Bannon for getting him out of the White House. And I don't want
[26:40.320 --> 26:44.960]  to just attack Scarimucci, but it's a load of bull. It's Scarimucci trying to score points
[26:44.960 --> 26:51.160]  in the news. Again, oh, they say Bannon's a white nationalist just like they say I am
[26:51.160 --> 26:58.360]  with no proof. Let's go to the footage. But we're closely following the terrible events
[26:58.360 --> 27:06.320]  unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this
[27:06.320 --> 27:14.200]  egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides. It's been going
[27:14.200 --> 27:21.720]  on for a long time in our country. Not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It's been going on
[27:21.720 --> 27:30.600]  for a long, long time. It is no place in America. What is vital now is a swift restoration of
[27:30.600 --> 27:36.840]  law and order and the protection of innocent lives. No citizen should ever fear for their
[27:36.840 --> 27:46.840]  safety and security in our society. And no child should ever be afraid to go outside and
[27:46.840 --> 27:56.040]  play or be with their parents and have a good time. I just got off the phone with the governor
[27:56.040 --> 28:03.280]  of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, and we agreed that the hate and the division must stop and
[28:03.280 --> 28:11.400]  must stop right now. We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation and
[28:11.400 --> 28:20.800]  true effect, really, and I say this so strongly, true affection for each other. Our country
[28:20.800 --> 28:29.400]  is doing very well in so many ways. We have record, just absolute record, employment.
[28:29.400 --> 28:36.720]  We have unemployment, we're going to come back with the rest of it and then we're going
[28:36.720 --> 28:40.720]  to get into the Homeland Security spokesman, just really getting into the facts. Because
[28:40.720 --> 28:47.160]  I mean, you can't have a more frothing, racist, dirty, evil group than the George Soros Antifa.
[28:47.160 --> 28:51.560]  And that's saying a lot because, I mean, some of these white nationalists and KKK people
[28:51.560 --> 28:56.480]  are like, you talk about trailer trash, you talk about mentally ill people, I mean, just
[28:56.480 --> 28:58.080]  it's a pack of morons.
[28:58.080 --> 29:03.200]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com
[29:03.200 --> 29:07.040]  is writing about it. But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and
[29:07.040 --> 29:11.960]  eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia
[29:11.960 --> 29:17.240]  division of preparedness. Well, the ants may have the last laugh on the grasshoppers, but
[29:17.240 --> 29:21.040]  the grasshoppers will still sing the tune if they can make money. But maybe you don't
[29:21.040 --> 29:24.800]  have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home
[29:24.800 --> 29:29.960]  theater into a radiation proof bunker. There are still very effective low tech, low cost
[29:29.960 --> 29:34.600]  things you can do to prepare. In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and
[29:34.600 --> 29:39.520]  doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival. Things
[29:39.520 --> 29:44.480]  that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb
[29:44.480 --> 29:48.880]  an economic shock, or to protect you from home invasion. Prepare for the worst case
[29:48.880 --> 29:54.000]  scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best case scenario. Get more

[32:03.780 --> 32:08.480]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[32:08.480 --> 32:14.880]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[32:14.880 --> 32:20.600]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated
[32:20.600 --> 32:25.560]  with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war. It is a classical 360 win. This
[32:25.560 --> 32:29.880]  is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe

[32:56.560 --> 33:25.560]  with ZShield InfoWarsLife.com.
[33:25.560 --> 33:53.560]  Welcome to ZShield InfoWarsLife.com.
[33:53.560 --> 34:15.560]  Welcome to ZShield InfoWarsLife.com.
[34:15.560 --> 34:29.480]  So, the media promotes the killing of cops that white people are inherently bad, pushes
[34:29.480 --> 34:34.800]  seven, eight years of a billion plus dollars for sorals and others, funding going out and
[34:34.800 --> 34:40.160]  attacking white people and they wonder then why a crowd of maybe a hundred or so white
[34:40.160 --> 34:46.880]  people show up, most of them reporters, literally half of them were reporters to cover the alt
[34:46.880 --> 34:52.320]  right and it's not even the alt right, it's white nationalist. But Hillary created the
[34:52.320 --> 35:01.800]  term alt right nine months ago in October of 2016 and she said anybody that opposes
[35:01.800 --> 35:07.560]  her was alt right and that it was racist and then she said my name, Stephen Bannon's
[35:07.560 --> 35:12.600]  name, Trump's name. And I said early on, I said this is a setup, every time they get
[35:12.600 --> 35:15.840]  these white nationalist groups that most of them are controlled by the feds or they're
[35:15.840 --> 35:19.600]  useful idiots, it's just a fact, it keeps it coming out in the news. Elohim City was
[35:19.600 --> 35:23.240]  run by the Southern Parvy Law Center. That was the group that carried out and was involved
[35:23.240 --> 35:27.920]  in Oklahoma City bombing according to the FBI. And the Southern Parvy Law Center was
[35:27.920 --> 35:31.640]  running the group. The white supremacists can't even get it together to have their
[35:31.640 --> 35:37.000]  own compound. It's the run by the Southern Parvy Law Center. So again, you can see this
[35:37.000 --> 35:45.440]  from a trillion miles away. And here it is. Oh, ban free speech. Oh, conservatives collectively
[35:45.440 --> 35:52.640]  did this. And even though I disagree with the KKK morons, the few like five guys in
[35:52.640 --> 35:57.560]  their little clown outfits that I've protested for many years, I will not take the guilt
[35:57.560 --> 36:02.160]  on of what they're doing. Any more than I'll take on Antifa running around beating up female
[36:02.160 --> 36:07.160]  reporters because they're such cowards from the hill and others that are groveling to
[36:07.160 --> 36:15.920]  Antifa. Antifa is so stupid, the Soros idiots are so dumb, they attack their own MSM folks
[36:15.920 --> 36:23.640]  because they're dirt balls. But this is what Paul Watson wrote on November 22nd, 2016,
[36:23.640 --> 36:29.080]  at present planet on his powerful Twitter account. The new right versus the alt right.
[36:29.080 --> 36:35.120]  There are two alt rights. One is more accurately described as the new right. Exactly the term
[36:35.120 --> 36:41.200]  we've coined. We are the new right. Not even they want to use the term right. We're renaissance.
[36:41.200 --> 36:46.440]  We're the new liberals, the old liberals, the true liberals, the Thomas Jefferson stuff.
[36:46.440 --> 36:51.040]  One is more accurately described as the new right. These people like to wear mega hats,
[36:51.040 --> 36:56.280]  create memes and have fun. They include whites, blacks, Asians, Latinos, gays, everyone else.
[36:56.280 --> 37:00.200]  These are the people who helped Trump win the election. But what did the Southern Poverty
[37:00.200 --> 37:06.120]  Law Center in ADL do when they were desperate? Well, they did what they always do. The other
[37:06.120 --> 37:11.880]  faction likes to fester in dark corners of subreddits and obsess about Jews and attack
[37:11.880 --> 37:18.600]  us all day and racially superiority of Adolf Hitler. This is a tiny fringe minority. They
[37:18.600 --> 37:22.680]  had no impact on the election. Yes, which faction the media is giving all the attention
[37:22.680 --> 37:32.600]  to. That's why Paul Watson is such a great part of Info Wars. He just gets it all. And
[37:32.600 --> 37:38.480]  he retweeted that today or yesterday from nine months ago, eight and a half months ago.
[37:38.480 --> 37:43.720]  So that's the reality. That's the fact. I don't care if you're some black racist nationalist
[37:43.720 --> 37:49.360]  or some white racist nationalist, you're both equally morons. And I decry it because the
[37:49.360 --> 37:53.400]  globalist you're playing you off against each other. Sure, are racist whites doing stuff
[37:53.400 --> 37:57.840]  to you? Yeah, are racist blacks doing stuff? Yes, it's real and that people don't like
[37:57.840 --> 38:05.480]  you because of what color you are. But it's a facsimile and a manipulation. An old Nazi
[38:05.480 --> 38:10.480]  collaborator Soros is laughing about it because he was never even a Nazi. He just teamed up
[38:10.480 --> 38:17.040]  with the power then, just like he does now. Now joining us is Millie Weaver and Gavin
[38:17.040 --> 38:21.240]  Wentz, who I told him about a month ago, I said, you guys are so good on the road, you're
[38:21.240 --> 38:25.080]  great here, but get out on the road for the next month if you can. And they did it. And
[38:25.080 --> 38:30.520]  they have just their flyover America has millions and millions of views just on YouTube and
[38:30.520 --> 38:35.200]  our Facebook. And then now their footage has millions of views as they got yesterday. But
[38:35.200 --> 38:38.480]  I told him, I said, listen, don't go to this if you don't want to. They said, no, we're
[38:38.480 --> 38:42.760]  going. So Millie Weaver's here. Gavin Wentz can pop in too. They're welcome to coast a
[38:42.760 --> 38:46.640]  little bit with us when Jason Kessler is coming on. And by the way, I'll give this to Jason
[38:46.640 --> 38:52.280]  Kessler. I disagree with him and his white nationalism. I understand his hatred of the
[38:52.280 --> 38:57.280]  anti white racist anti-fah George Soros groups, but that doesn't mean you become them. But
[38:57.280 --> 39:02.880]  I'll say this, he'll at least come on the show to defend his values that disagree with.
[39:02.880 --> 39:08.640]  But the anti-fah racist Soros groups will not because they are totally controlled. So
[39:08.640 --> 39:12.600]  but I've got some strong words and serious questions for Jason Kessler who organized
[39:12.600 --> 39:16.960]  this, ran this. Did he not see what he was walking into? Regardless. Millie Weaver was
[39:16.960 --> 39:21.320]  there. We have all the footage. It's on info wars.com, shot live, unedited. We've had to
[39:21.320 --> 39:27.120]  try to edit some things down that are shorter and bleeped all the cussing that's coming up.
[39:27.120 --> 39:34.160]  But she's there. She's a reporter. They're attacking her because she's got info wars,
[39:34.160 --> 39:38.840]  Mike, but Hill reporters, others got attacked this, even though they were pro Soros, pro
[39:38.840 --> 39:43.480]  globalist anti-Trump. And then they get pushed in over with the police because they're getting
[39:43.480 --> 39:51.760]  attacked. The police are over there by the mixed group that's over there that is there
[39:51.760 --> 39:56.600]  to cover what's happening that they call white nationalist. And the police start laughing
[39:56.600 --> 40:02.360]  at them as they get attacked. And then they force them to leave through the large crowd.
[40:02.360 --> 40:07.640]  It's incredible, the large crowd of anti-fah that had been shipped in. And it is just disgusting
[40:07.640 --> 40:12.440]  to watch the media cover this up, to watch the mayor who's a Democratic Party operative
[40:12.440 --> 40:16.320]  admittedly order a standout, which Millie was told on tape happened. Some cops were
[40:16.320 --> 40:22.480]  good. Some laughed as they were pepper spray. So Millie Weaver, incredible job, start walking
[40:22.480 --> 40:25.200]  through the basics of what you witnessed and what you saw.
[40:25.200 --> 40:31.840]  Well, basically it started out as a relatively peaceful protest. We got there pretty early
[40:31.840 --> 40:37.640]  because we knew things were likely to get crazy as the day progressed. But really and
[40:37.640 --> 40:44.640]  truly first you had the, I guess, unite the right rally attendees standing up on the hill
[40:44.640 --> 40:49.440]  in front of the General Lee Confederate statue. And then down below it started out with having
[40:49.440 --> 40:56.840]  like a couple counter protest groups out there. As soon as the anti-fah arrived, they came
[40:56.840 --> 41:04.800]  in a big, like a big crowd, a big gathering. And once they got there, they started screaming,
[41:04.800 --> 41:12.640]  kill fascists, kill Nazis, you know, and started getting everything to escalate. And by the
[41:12.640 --> 41:18.440]  way, that means reporters, women, children, everyone's a Nazi, not wearing black screaming.
[41:18.440 --> 41:20.200]  We want to kill whites.
[41:20.200 --> 41:25.080]  Pretty much. I mean, that encompassed anyone that didn't agree with them or that wasn't
[41:25.080 --> 41:28.920]  an anti-fah and it wasn't on, you know, standing with them and it wasn't a protest.
[41:28.920 --> 41:32.880]  Basically, if you weren't a methhead and black, you were in trouble.
[41:32.880 --> 41:40.680]  Pretty much. I mean, I was harassed. I was heckled. I even got pepper spray on my arm.
[41:40.680 --> 41:45.200]  They were spraying in our direction. Basically, the media and journalists were kind of trying
[41:45.200 --> 41:50.200]  to stand in the middle between the two different sides because we didn't want to be associated
[41:50.200 --> 41:52.200]  with either side. But what happened is-
[41:52.200 --> 41:55.080]  I've seen the footage. You're there and they're trying to pepper spray you. They hit your
[41:55.080 --> 42:00.600]  cameraman Gavin. They're just screaming, death to info wars, F you. It's just crazy.
[42:00.600 --> 42:06.600]  Yeah. They actually assaulted Gavin pepper sprayed him directly in the face. That was
[42:06.600 --> 42:12.120]  an anti-fah that sprayed him directly in the face. He was blinded for like 30 to 40 minutes.
[42:12.120 --> 42:16.920]  It was pretty bad. And here's, here's the important distinction here. You have the mainstream
[42:16.920 --> 42:23.880]  media depicting this as a violent white supremacist rally that, you know, they were the ones
[42:23.880 --> 42:29.680]  aggressing and they were the ones being the dominant aggressors out there. But in reality,
[42:29.680 --> 42:37.640]  all I saw was anti-fah and black lives matter, literally doing war game like maneuvers. They
[42:37.640 --> 42:44.600]  brought ice chest full of water balloons filled with urine, feces, paint, gel like chemicals
[42:44.600 --> 42:52.040]  that burned people's skin. They were deploying tear gas canisters at the people and the police
[42:52.040 --> 43:18.280]  run by the mayor. We're working with them in this false flag of them. We'll be right back.

[45:07.000 --> 45:12.520]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient
[45:12.520 --> 45:18.360]  ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do today. And our ancient ancestors
[45:18.360 --> 45:23.240]  sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[45:23.240 --> 45:29.320]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,

[46:58.360 --> 47:04.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:17.320 --> 47:23.400]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide from Austin, Texas broadcasting
[47:23.400 --> 47:30.520]  worldwide it's Alex Jones. Now Millie Weaver and our intrepid cameraman Gavin Winsome to get on
[47:30.520 --> 47:35.400]  screen as well are going to host with us the whole next hour and we have Jason Kessler and I guess
[47:35.400 --> 47:41.160]  Nico Acosta got set up for us our lead producer who's all over the news defending in the rally,
[47:41.160 --> 47:45.480]  defending he had it. Well I mean I guess you can defend the first amendment you're right to
[47:45.480 --> 47:50.680]  demonstrate. I mean I agree with that whether I agree with what you're saying or doing or not
[47:50.680 --> 47:55.400]  you have to agree with that and I knew the talking point was coming to ban free speech
[47:55.400 --> 48:00.440]  and then I saw Fox News even CNN saying oh it's time to try to arresting these right wingers you
[48:00.440 --> 48:06.840]  just all conservatives did this why why Trump did this why Stephen Bannon did this. We'll talk to
[48:06.840 --> 48:11.400]  Millie Weaver about that in a moment and play some of these clips for radio and TV audiences of
[48:11.400 --> 48:17.240]  our camera guy getting hit, her getting hit, other reporters getting hit and just the the hatred and
[48:17.240 --> 48:23.000]  then the police working to protect that. I tell you when you're under a Democrat city say which
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.160]  one about Republicans I experienced it being viciously attacked families being attacked
[48:28.040 --> 48:35.080]  by the fascist forces of sorrows and the police protecting it in DC it is it is truly sick but
[48:35.080 --> 48:41.800]  first BuzzFeed is a big enemy of this show kind of like they produce the fake PP gate dossier
[48:41.800 --> 48:47.400]  they're being sued for that's been confirmed to be a fraud about Trump and Russia with hookers
[48:47.400 --> 48:53.800]  and Yoda was there as well along with the Easter Bunny having sex with him but they they had a
[48:53.800 --> 48:58.200]  bunch of our products tested and by a big California firm at California levels they have the highest
[48:58.200 --> 49:02.520]  level laws in California and they said okay it's totally free of heavy metals and it is
[49:02.520 --> 49:08.120]  as advertised because they'd already made a big deal with them to do PR for the big lab in California
[49:08.120 --> 49:13.160]  that also sells supplements and it totally blew up in their face so we're calling it the BuzzFeed
[49:13.160 --> 49:17.560]  special the specials we had last month with the most popular ever some of the biggest with the
[49:17.560 --> 49:24.680]  new specials so we're combining the 1776 specials along with the July specials we're calling it the
[49:24.680 --> 49:30.520]  BuzzFeed mega specials because I noticed when they ran this hit piece suddenly massive new orders
[49:30.520 --> 49:36.120]  came in and then they even they even had a couple products that we buy from Dr. Group because when
[49:36.120 --> 49:40.200]  I went out and private labeled a bunch of stuff I get the cleanest best top-rated so I went with
[49:40.200 --> 49:45.880]  Group as one of our suppliers we got four suppliers and so two of the products that they sell separately
[49:45.880 --> 49:51.160]  they say the best five of them b12 is this vegan safe they sell for 35 bucks they say ours is what
[49:51.160 --> 49:56.840]  we say it is but it's only worth 10 really I buy it from like $12 a bottle I sell for 1776 right
[49:56.840 --> 50:03.880]  down special usually 25 to 30 but eat it regularly $5 under what they're selling it so BuzzFeed's lab
[50:03.880 --> 50:10.680]  is selling who we private label from saying it's the very best the cleanest but ours is overpriced
[50:10.680 --> 50:18.120]  when ours is $12 less now that's just one product I'm not going to go over at all this is what you
[50:18.120 --> 50:25.000]  call Providence I mean this is ridiculous because of course the plan in California with Prop 65 is
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.800]  nothing is clean enough to be passable with both products they pass it to lawyers because
[50:29.800 --> 50:34.440]  survivor that was the plan it just blew up so good it just blew up so sweet what you think I
[50:34.440 --> 50:39.560]  want to put out products knowing I'm going to be targeted and not go out and just pick the very best
[50:39.560 --> 50:48.680]  products the private label I mean so we've got brain force plus 55% off but a lot of these
[50:48.680 --> 50:53.240]  specials are going to end Wednesdays we're running out of some of them survival shield x2 the good

[51:54.920 --> 52:00.040]  them ride shotgun with us but millie weaver talking to her yesterday today is on fire with what she
[52:00.040 --> 52:05.960]  witnessed and everything she told me 10 minutes after they left she called me and said i'm getting
[52:05.960 --> 52:11.080]  out of there as the thing was really you know hitting its peak everything she later told me
[52:11.080 --> 52:15.960]  was all confirmed so millie just give us your data dump what you witnessed what you saw the next
[52:15.960 --> 52:20.920]  hour we'll play all the clips well i kind of want to give a little bit of surrounding information
[52:20.920 --> 52:27.720]  as i watch this i became increasingly suspicious that this was a deep state run operation you
[52:27.720 --> 52:31.800]  could see that the mainstream media outlets were already picking up this event prior to the event
[52:31.800 --> 52:37.000]  even they had the talking points ready it's all they were they were promoting it actually they
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.600]  were saying that the police were going to be there in full force as well as the national guard to
[52:40.600 --> 52:46.360]  keep the peace to make sure that everyone had their right to peaceful protest instead what happened
[52:46.360 --> 52:53.080]  was you know the police stood down and they allowed the antifa and these black lives matter
[52:53.080 --> 53:00.120]  and other extremist groups on the left to then attack and aggress the united right rally attendees
[53:00.120 --> 53:04.600]  now say what you want about their beliefs i personally do not agree with their beliefs i think
[53:04.600 --> 53:10.760]  racism is stupid i will say that not everyone there was a racist most people actually weren't
[53:10.760 --> 53:16.920]  racist they were like you said white nationalists but all in all they have a right to free speech
[53:16.920 --> 53:23.560]  just as much as people on the black lives matter side and the antifa have a right to peaceful assembly
[53:23.560 --> 53:28.520]  and free speech the problem is is when you have other groups coming out there to violently shut
[53:28.520 --> 53:33.640]  down free speech and then justify that by saying that you know demonizing their their points of
[53:33.640 --> 53:40.920]  view their ideology um we went to war patriots died so that people could have a first amendment
[53:40.920 --> 53:47.320]  so that people had the right to express uh ridiculous viewpoints even the aclu who is a
[53:47.320 --> 53:53.000]  leftist leaning organization has been backing and standing up for the people who held the united
[53:53.000 --> 53:58.520]  right rally because what had happened to them actually violated their rights and if we allow
[53:58.520 --> 54:03.480]  it to happen to people who we do not agree with because they have distasteful viewpoints then
[54:03.480 --> 54:09.320]  we're essentially opening up the gates to allow it to happen to us because these antifa and black
[54:09.320 --> 54:15.080]  lives matter they do not distinguish between those extremist people on the right and other people on
[54:15.080 --> 54:19.240]  the right exactly that's what i said the live video i did in the middle of it i said this is a
[54:19.240 --> 54:24.920]  false flag to be used to try to ban conservative demonstrations and speeches and then fox news
[54:24.920 --> 54:32.280]  cnn said all that two hours later very scripted but you were there as a witness yes and as far as
[54:32.280 --> 54:38.200]  this crash that happened it is a tragedy it's horrible i do not condone political violence i do
[54:38.200 --> 54:44.680]  not condone anything like this people died they lost their lives but i'm gonna say this i blame
[54:44.680 --> 54:51.160]  the police i blame the city officials the mayor the people that told the police to stand down
[54:51.160 --> 54:57.160]  to allow it to escalate to this and what i will say is that the police literally stood there and
[54:57.160 --> 55:06.360]  watched the antifa commit felony assault crimes on the united right attendees prior to this happening
[55:06.360 --> 55:12.600]  so this is what happens when you have um an injustice and you have police and city officials
[55:12.600 --> 55:16.920]  deciding they're not going to protect the rights of people because they don't agree with your ideologies
[55:16.920 --> 55:22.120]  i don't either but i agree with the fact that these police officers took an oath of office
[55:22.120 --> 55:29.400]  to uphold the constitution to protect free speech to um you know dispense equal protection under the
[55:29.400 --> 55:34.600]  law and they did not do so and then somebody decided to take the matter into their own hands
[55:34.600 --> 55:39.640]  and go out and commit a despicable despicable act and who knows if that was staged that that whole
[55:39.640 --> 55:43.960]  thing looks suspicious as well they've been caught staging stuff but millie i totally agree with you
[55:43.960 --> 55:49.240]  and we're looking at this i've watched all the i watch hours and hours of footage it's antifa
[55:49.240 --> 55:54.520]  it's the sorrows folks attacking reporters that are even on their side exactly and you were in
[55:54.520 --> 55:59.000]  the middle of this gabin's going to be joining us he got hit right in the face but i mean it's on
[55:59.000 --> 56:03.960]  tape where they attack you and go f you and like screw info wars to try to punch you and it's just
[56:03.960 --> 56:09.800]  yeah they were they were very aggressive toward us and we keep we kept having to run back into
[56:09.800 --> 56:16.280]  the united right rally side but that was only because the antifa and the black lives matter
[56:16.280 --> 56:21.320]  were trying to physically assault us they pepper sprayed my camera guy gavin in the face and i
[56:21.320 --> 56:25.000]  know you thought that that was gavin mckinnon's but you know they have the same name it's easy to
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.760]  make well i didn't know you were calling me saying they just got gavin and i knew he was
[56:28.760 --> 56:31.720]  going to go but canceled because of the white supremacist that we're going to be there and i
[56:31.720 --> 56:37.960]  got all that it's the live fog of war we get stuff wrong but but what i'm saying is it shows
[56:38.920 --> 56:45.320]  just how crazy it is that they knew you get there they march you in the press everybody else
[56:45.320 --> 56:51.000]  by standards they kettle you with the police let antifa come declare an emergency push you into
[56:51.000 --> 56:56.040]  them the whole thing was scripted which which which came out in maryland came out in dc came out in
[56:56.040 --> 57:02.120]  other cities that homeland security under obama was running it ordering the stand downs running it i
[57:02.120 --> 57:09.160]  mean this was staged again it was and you know some the governor has ties to the clintons and
[57:09.160 --> 57:14.520]  this was definitely a trap even the way they had the little cattle gates set up they had it so that
[57:14.520 --> 57:19.480]  the police were at the backs of the united ryan rally attendees and as they were being pushed back
[57:19.480 --> 57:26.120]  and cornered by the antifa who literally brought uh coolers full of weapons and pepper spray and
[57:26.120 --> 57:31.320]  water balloons full of chemicals that burn your skin and urine and feces and pepper spray then
[57:31.320 --> 57:36.280]  the police said if you guys don't move forward and walk through the antifa and dispense we're
[57:36.280 --> 57:40.680]  going to arrest you and charge you with crimes so they forced people to then dispense and walk
[57:40.680 --> 57:46.360]  through the antifa and the antifa literally started chanting shame shame like in game of thrones
[57:46.360 --> 57:50.360]  throwing things we'll be right back sold out for months our best-selling super blue fluoride

[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:12.520]  the truth is humanity is coming down fast but we're miles above them on our journey
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:24.440]  i'm coming down fast but a miles above you
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:30.840]  i'm too confident to want to feel powerful by looking down at other groups of humans
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:37.240]  but i won't sit there and watch government and corporations organize because 93 of the world's
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:42.680]  not quote white to turn them into race-based groups to attack whites but i don't say this to like make
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:46.680]  it sound like the quote minorities are the good guys it's mainly a bunch of white communists
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:51.160]  and people wanting to control minorities for a political overthrow that are pushing a race-based
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:57.400]  narrative and millie weaver was there and witnessed it what george soros and others of finance and the
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:03.480]  democratic mayor there in charlesville virginia all of it she saw it now she's gonna finish up in
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:08.200]  the next five minutes but ride shotgun with us and then gavin wintz our incredible cameraman
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:13.080]  who's part of this uh you know great reporters were doing with the flyover america as they
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:18.440]  travel around the country he got really pepper spray right in the face attacked it's all on video
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:23.640]  hours of raw footage make up your own mind see it for yourself info wars dot com but millie
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:29.160]  continue just putting a bow on this you you were kettled by police you were forced through
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:37.800]  uh the george soros just race baiters i mean the kukla clan meets liberal method
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:43.560]  combo i mean it's just scum of the earth uh and it's like no we don't support the white
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:48.680]  supremacist either it's just like it's the antifa attacking and then it's the media acting like
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:56.040]  they're little angels it's just not true yeah i mean definitely i got into debates with both the
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:01.960]  people at the unite the right rally and the people at the antifa and black lives matter side the
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:07.320]  difference was is that the people on the antifa black lives matter side even though you know
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:12.280]  we had differing opinions they wanted to attack me versus the people on the unite the right rally
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:16.600]  side they weren't attacking me even though we did have differing opinions and some of them
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:20.600]  were fascist that didn't think that the communists should have free speech and the communists didn't
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:25.240]  think that the fascists should have free speech so it kind of went both ways in the sense that they
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:29.800]  both don't think that they should have free speech and that's the problem with labeling something as
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:34.920]  hate speech because it's a matter of opinion it's subjective and i just wanted to announce right now
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:40.040]  right now there's a seattle march against hate going on right now as we speak i saw some live
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:48.120]  streams on it and you have these nazi um haters i guess uh saying say it loud say it clear nazis
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:55.240]  are not welcome here the problem is is these antifa i mean we all we don't like nazis i mean a very
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:01.960]  but they won't let my low a gay guy speak at berkeley they want all free speech they got caught
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:06.600]  being funded by the democrats in deep state to protest all the trump rallies and cause violence
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:13.640]  yes i feel like this whole thing was orchestrated by deep state i saw um oh there's no feel about it
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:19.800]  they were already as you said absolutely yeah there were agitators there that i recognized from the
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:26.760]  rnc from several other protests from both sides now i'm going there because i'm a reporter who's
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:30.920]  paying for these people to go there i mean that's i agree well you know they've been financed by
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:37.240]  soros over a billion dollars total but let me ask you this was soros's birthday yesterday i mean
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:41.960]  this is the guy that finances all this what do you make of that well i don't think it was a
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:47.880]  coincidence and i don't think it's a coincidence that um charlottesville is relatively close it's
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:54.120]  a short commute from virginia and dc where a lot of deep state operatives work out of so i don't
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.760]  think that that's a coincidence by the way i know you guys have been have been log jam which are you
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:02.760]  done more than i've done this weekend i've been working eight hours a day on the weekend you've
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:08.360]  got footage of the same folks at different rallies as you expose the professor that assaulted people
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:12.920]  at berkeley he's now been indicted because of the footage uh it's a good job to you and gavin you've
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:19.000]  also got said they're agitators they've said it they've said oh yeah i'm an agitator i'm i'm saying
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.800]  is you've documented that this is staged and you've got the footage that's coming out right after
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.880]  you guys are on air i mean i mean you've got the police laughing you've got them admitting that that
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:33.240]  it was staged there was a stand down you guys you guys deserve the public surprise i mean this is
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:37.960]  this is to attack free speech that's what this is all about that's right shut down free speech i mean
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:43.720]  i agree that uh people like mike sternum deserve to pull a surprise like donald jr said but show to you
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:48.120]  it's not taken away from him i'm just saying this is groundbreaking what millie weaver and gavin
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:57.800]  winster doing we'll be back with the organizer of this whole thing stay with us december 23rd 1776
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:02.920]  these are the times that try men's souls the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:07.160]  in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands by it now
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:13.000]  deserves the love and thanks of man and woman tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.800]  we have this consolation with us that the heart of the conflict the more glorious the triumph
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:23.880]  what we obtained too cheap we esteem too lightly it is dearness only that gives everything its value
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:29.640]  heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods and it would be strange indeed if so celestial
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:35.320]  an article as freedom should not be highly rated britain with an army to enforce her tyranny has
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:41.480]  declared that she has a right not only to tax but to bind us in all cases whatsoever and if being
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:46.600]  bound in that matter is not slavery then there is no such thing as slavery upon earth even the
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:54.200]  expression is impious for so unlimited a power can only belong to god thomas pain the american crisis
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:06:11.160]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:18.360]  close your habits your facts your fears give us your address your shoes size your years your
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:23.960]  digits milley weaver and gavin wintz both reporters for info wars dot com that we're in the theater
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:29.800]  of this event that you think is the end of the world band free speech all conservatives are
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:37.160]  nazis trumps a demon uh you know george soros is god we must absolutely you know destroy christian
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:42.520]  civilization milley is going to be back on with us in about 10 15 minutes and ride shotgun then i'm
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:49.320]  gonna add gavin wintz who was pepper sprayed attacked by the george soros anti-white uh
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:57.560]  super kkk of the left but that said the white nationalist the you know the people that okay
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:02.840]  you're being attacked as your white then you become the groups that are attacking you this is like
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:07.400]  groober saying thank god the public's so stupid but i'm gonna let him speak for himself because
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:14.280]  here's the deal i will say this for jason kesler who organized uh this whole event and then had to
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:19.320]  go through the federal judges and had to go through all of it uh then to have his quote
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:27.400]  demonstration and they marched him down to these cages where the cops were waiting uh and then they
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:34.280]  let the antifa attack them i mean that's a fact so they could then say that oh the white nationalists
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:41.480]  that are kind of like kkk light they caused it well that's all the fraud but i gotta tell you talk
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:47.320]  about walking into a trap um but we're gonna hear from him because let me tell you something i asked
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:54.360]  the george soros pro fascist you know on the antifa and they won't come on because most of them
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:08:02.920]  can't talk i mean methods can't talk at least jason kesler of jason kesler dot net came on to talk
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:08.280]  about this but i mean what do you think's gonna happen in a democrat city when they've been caught
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:13.400]  with homeland security funding white supremacist groups to go out and clash with groups to create
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.800]  division what is going to happen when they control the cops i mean i couldn't go to the inauguration
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.200]  it took me three hours to get through i had to finally run people over just to get in
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.680]  with the with the george soros groups attacking me calling me a racist and beating
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:33.720]  women and children up in front of me so what did he think was going to happen because now
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:38.520]  he can say well we don't apologize for a demonstration blah blah and you know i get what
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:42.680]  the spokesman for homeland security for trump we're gonna play come on the next segment said
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.680]  where there are a lot of diverse groups i think half the people in the you know
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:53.640]  demonstration against pulling down robert lee where reporters covering it the hill got attacked
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:58.600]  millie weaver got attacked gavin wince got attacked we have footage all this but again you're walking
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.840]  into this narrative you're giving them what they want and quite frankly
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:08.520]  i just got to say whether it's white supremacist or the black supremacist
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:16.520]  i think it's all idiocy but but the media only covers the white nationalist health they got
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.880]  tom brokaw saying i lead the white nationalist when i when i don't so clearly this is what the
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:29.080]  left wants to invoke why are people playing along with it uh let's talk to jason kessler
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:33.960]  jason you you set this up you're you're in 10 000 newspapers today and you're you're all over the
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:39.320]  news they say that you basically planned all this you're the guy behind it uh what do you say for
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:45.000]  what's happened here well i would say that the media reports are completely inaccurate they're
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:52.520]  crafting a narrative which has been a hit campaign on the alternative media including the alt right
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:59.240]  and they're trying to do a hit on donald trump they're trying to connect him to this act of
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.960]  your skype's breaking up let me just let me just give you a second i'll be a whole conspiracy
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:15.080]  from by somebody that i cut you off just so it gets back undoubtedly they're blaming trump
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:20.920]  if it rains they're blaming trump if somebody falls up an an appeal i'm not denying that i'm
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:26.920]  saying most of the time i study white nationalist groups going out they're run by feds and i'm not
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:32.280]  saying you're a fed a big fat federal agent like i once told a clan leader that was a federal agent
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:36.280]  later came out but what did you think was going to happen when this when you did this
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:41.720]  um can you hear me okay yes i decided
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:52.040]  you can hear me a little bit go ahead hello okay um what i thought was going to happen
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.560]  is that we were going to be able to have a peaceful demonstration because even if you're
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:01.160]  in a community where people do not agree with you we're supposed to have first amendment protections
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:07.000]  uh i thought we would be able to go in support of this robert e lee monument which
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:14.040]  is uh a historical monument and it's part of a trend of these politically correct uh neil
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:20.760]  marxist globalists who are taking down the statues of white historical figures all over the country
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:26.200]  so whether it's uh robert e lee in charlesville or these other confederate monuments in new
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:31.160]  orleans they're going after thomas jefferson and the founding fathers because they say they were
[01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:37.560]  not good men because they own slaves uh and you know they took down the busts of the white
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:45.080]  founders of king's college in london uh because it was insensitive to ethnic minorities we are in
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:51.480]  a serious uh bit of crisis right now it's true that the globalists are like trying to attack
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:56.600]  whites and pull down history and are anti white just to control the minority groups and it is
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:01.080]  true that they're banning uh the the name lynch they're saying you may be able to college your
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:06.040]  name's lynch it's an irish name it doesn't matter they're testing to ban words i get that but but
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:10.440]  what did you think was gonna happen when you marched in there with all of this with the
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:22.680]  antifa and the police cuddling you in yeah we're not we're not censoring what he's saying and doing
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:25.960]  we're gonna have to probably get him on his cell phone because i i want to be able to hear this but
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:33.160]  it's it's in and out with uh jason kessler jason can you hear me put it back on screen folks can
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.320]  see he can't he's talking i can't hear him put him on hold because i want this guy to have a say or
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.960]  they'll say i cut this off this is driving me crazy skype's an incredible technology but it's
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:47.400]  not you know it's it's not not not working completely yet so so let's see if we can just
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:57.560]  get him on a phone let's bring in millie weaver real quick if we can millie uh again it it's crazy
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:04.440]  to watch this unfold and it's crazy to see all this go on because they're penalizing this guy
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:11.560]  because he's saying one third of the racist stuff that i disagree with against the the Soros group
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:16.440]  it's a total cutout just make us fight with each other so how does media say he caused all the
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:23.160]  violence when clearly antifa was the ones attacking well you know it's pretty obvious that the media
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:29.480]  is doing everything they can because they really want to create an extremist right wing homegrown
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:35.560]  terrorist organization in order to justify censoring people that's really what they want to do that's
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:41.080]  what this is all about um i was suspicious from it from the beginning and really and truly i wasn't
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:46.840]  very interested in going to this event in charlottesville but i just knew in my heart that this was
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:52.680]  a setup it was going to go down and this is what they were going to try and do to justify censorship
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:58.600]  and to continue the censorship that we're even seeing now with youtube and twitter and facebook
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:04.760]  and so on and so forth this is what they're going to do they're going to create um a situation that
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:10.520]  gets out of hand have the police stand down so that people then want to take justice into their
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:17.480]  own hands and by no way am i saying that justice you know is plowing through people on the road
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:22.200]  or whatever protesters and killing them because when people take justice in their own hands it's
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:26.840]  not always just and in this case it absolutely wasn't really i agree with you what do you think
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:30.760]  this forebodes the the globalists have been spending at least eight years funding this race
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:36.200]  force scenario admittedly it's been declassified what is this bowed in what they're planning to do
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:45.080]  well i feel like it helps them in the sense that they can further try and get rid of free speech
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:50.760]  and freedom of protest you have these leftist progressive groups right now saying that hate
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:57.400]  speech needs to be banned hate speech groups need to be banned and really and truly it's a slippery
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:03.480]  slope because anyone can try to say something as hate speech now this is the the little analogy or
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:10.120]  metaphor i like to use imagine if you have progressives out there saying that you know all christian
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:16.440]  statues should be banned because you know the bible says that homosexuality is a sin therefore it's
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:23.720]  hate speech to transgender and homosexual people so if you had a group of african-american demonstrators
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:29.400]  out there preventing them from removing a martin luther king statue because martin luther king
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:36.840]  was a conservative and was christian would it be okay for antifa to then come and violently attack
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:41.800]  them exactly because as you know they've taken martin luther king down at what three universities
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:48.920]  saying he was an anti-training which is just some disorganizing program by the cia to break
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:55.080]  down society for population reduction so martin luther king has to be taken down you deserve

[01:17:53.560 --> 01:18:00.440]  they use their media to assassinate real news they use their schools to teach children that
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:06.280]  their president is another hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:11.800]  shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex-president to
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:18.920]  endorse the resistance all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:25.240]  and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:31.720]  bully and terrorize the law abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:38.520]  and stop the madness and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:46.440]  way we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:53.160]  with the clenched fist of truth i'm the national rifle association of america and i'm freedom's
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:59.880]  safest place as most of you already know i am a voracious consumer of news and information and
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:05.080]  in the last four or five years doing more and more research i came across the fact that the elite
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:10.920]  establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:17.080]  nutrition than we do today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:22.840]  were hunting killing and then processing and so i set out to develop caveman but to not just have
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:30.200]  concentrated bone broth from chicken but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:35.320]  and supercharging the body at the same time info wars isn't just fighting the globalist
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:41.400]  we're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning

[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:19.880]  it's like his life i don't want to go to war with it but the globalists are funding the radical
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:24.840]  elements of it to open our borders in to bring in 80 percent military age men 10 million of them to
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:36.280]  start a civil war so then i have to find them. Waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:45.480]  you live from the front lines of the info war. All right jason tesler that organized the rally
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:50.440]  of a couple hundred people most of them reporters that came to cover it joins us now via phone his
[01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:56.120]  skype was cutting out so so so let's actually hear uh from the individual we've reached out to the
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:21:02.600]  antifa folks funded by george soros the globalists all of us they won't come on but just i understand
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:06.600]  the reason you say you went and did the events and you can you say whatever you want i'm saying
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:12.600]  what do you make of the police kettling the demonstrators the the right wingers the white
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:18.600]  nationalists the reporters and then letting antifa attack i mean the whole thing clearly happened
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:24.520]  now they're blaming trump saying he didn't decry racism when he clearly did i mean can't you see
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:32.760]  the setup here yeah this was a coordinated setup on the alt right and on donald trump um and i guess
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:40.680]  the right wing in general uh this is a constitutional crisis uh that is not being talked about by the
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:48.840]  media essentially uh we wanted to do a rally in lee park in support of this monument that these
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:54.840]  neil marxist liberals are trying to tear down and we felt like it was an attack on white people
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:22:00.600]  because the vice mayor who was uh instigating this removal of the statue is a militant black
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:07.800]  who identifies with the black panthers and uh he said that thomas jefferson was next and he said a
[01:22:07.800 --> 01:22:13.000]  lot of things about my favorite thing about being down south is seeing the look on the face of little
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.800]  white men when they have to look up to a black man so a lot of people were offended and the rally
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:23.800]  was not about racism you know were there racist elements perhaps but most of the people who were
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:31.800]  there were trying to just stand up for themselves well jason i know this i know this they they claim
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:37.800]  like i'm in the kkk with no evidence and that trump is and all this stuff so clearly i know
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:42.520]  that's going on all i know is that killery creates the term alt right which means anybody
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:47.720]  that opposes globalism and then white nationalist groups that mix of groups show up and do stuff
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:52.840]  and then suddenly we're painted with the brush of these riots happening i understand it's synthetic
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:58.280]  i understand it's made up what did you think you were marching into the middle of i thought we were
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:04.200]  going to do a free speech rally i mean of course there were people who came uh prepared to defend
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:10.520]  themselves but i thought we were going to go into the park the police had led us to believe that
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:15.320]  they were going to escort our speakers to the event first of all they didn't do that they didn't show
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:22.200]  up at 8 30 in the morning when they were supposed to when we arrived at the event uh they were barricade
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:29.640]  blocking off the entrance ways uh the cops would not tell us where we could enter into uh so we had
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:36.440]  to walk through a mob there was a mob of anti-poly and black lives matter waiting for us clearly all
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:42.040]  set up just like democrats did in dc claiming that everyone that came to hear trump's inauguration
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:47.000]  was kkk uh and they attacked everyone that tried to get in and then said no one could make it in
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.400]  so no one was there to hear trump so this is the same old deal so i'm asking why did you walk into
[01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:58.760]  their trap i i thought that we had beaten them because i thought that their move was that they
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:06.280]  were going to shut down our event through uh a legal means right they tried to cancel our permit
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:12.120]  we took them to federal court and sued them because they were discriminating against our
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:17.320]  our the content of our speech and the federal judge found that that was the case so i thought
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:25.000]  that we had that resolved we had our guys ready to go and defend themselves we had uh oh oh guys
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:32.840]  we thought we're just going to stand in the park and be able to block the uh the antifa or whomever
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:37.000]  from coming into the park because we thought we were going to have police assistance we thought
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:43.000]  uh that they were going to help us remove the the bad elements and you know keep the counter
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.600]  demonstrators in an area where they could exercise their first amendment right and we sure but they
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:54.680]  orchestrated a clash the democratic uh mayor we understand okay so that's clear well all i'm
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:59.320]  asking you is i believe in ideology not what color somebody is i want to try to bring people together
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:04.360]  around free market open society people working together the globalists are pushing their own
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:08.360]  race narrative but just because they're pushing their own race narrative and then act like everybody
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:14.920]  else's racist i get people then kind of identifying with their own group to resist that but that's the
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:19.880]  trap i mean where where do you think this is going now because they're only going to use this
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:26.600]  for more division clearly they staged it they prepared it they did it but then you know how
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:31.080]  do you extricate yourself from that because i see you in the news saying you're glad you had your
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:38.120]  rally blah blah blah the police stood down that's true we saw the video uh it's just that how do you
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:43.480]  then now what do you say to george soros because you know he's it was his birthday yesterday they
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:50.680]  suckered you guys in i mean what are you gonna do now well i i'm gonna sue the city of charlesville
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:57.720]  they have to pay a heavy price for what they've done they put people in danger and lives were lost
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:03.640]  because of their inaction they they hated the content of our speech so much that they were
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:09.800]  willing to create anarchy to get their way well we have the footage we have the footage billy weaver
[01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:16.040]  and you have them uh uh you have the one scott that that shows the police laughing as their pepper
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:22.840]  sprayed and shows them saying we've been ordered to stand down that's on infowars.com so i don't
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:29.000]  want to just bash cops to bash cops but man i mean this mayor you want to blame don't blame even the
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.640]  communists or blame the white nationals or blame the reporters that were there the regular folks who
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:38.360]  to cover it i mean or the hill reporters that were there to cover it they're calling kkk or
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:43.160]  whatever now even though they like worship anti-fonds word soros which is a message to everybody
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:49.960]  what do you make of of the police and the government getting away with this well they haven't gotten
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:57.080]  away with it yet uh it's been just a short period of time since this has happened and i intend to
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:02.360]  uh continue litigating them in court the federal judges already found they discriminated against
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:07.800]  the content of the speech and i think that we can find that they refused to protect our rally
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:14.040]  and um led us to believe that they were going to protect the rally and keep everybody safe and
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:20.120]  then didn't do that so potentially this could be a multi-million dollar lawsuit i just know this
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:25.800]  even here in austin i mean in other areas they let people shoot cops and the cops
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:30.920]  so they get shot following orders they just they worship communism they worship antifa
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:36.280]  they're intimidated by it because they know the media is behind it msm is a joke when the police
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:40.840]  and the government everybody realize we're all being played off against each other all i'm saying
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:45.560]  is people can hate each other for what color they are all day long but don't folks understand there's
[01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:51.880]  a larger group manipulating those differences that's what i'm trying to say to you right now jason
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:56.440]  kessler you say you're not a white supremacist or white nationalist but i mean i'm not saying
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:28:02.680]  i'm a brainiac but i see inherent manipulation and being a puppet playing into this race game
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:09.880]  what do you say to that no i think that being a white identitarian in 2017 is a defensive
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:15.720]  posture right because we we do see the left playing these uh race games and they've been
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:22.760]  doing it for decades and decades and then i'll say 90 90 percent of the race baitings by the left
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:27.320]  90 percent 90 percent is the left i mean that's true so i'm just saying they can't demonize you
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:33.400]  if they're the biggest races out there but what i'm saying is that not only that but we have allowed
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:38.360]  them to continually erode the right the rights of white people they have groups that are specifically
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:44.520]  for identity groups like muslims with care or n double a cp with blacks and it makes it so you have
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:50.600]  these policies that are replacing us with uh i want to let you finish up and then and let

[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:19.240]  ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting killing and then processing and

[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:17.480]  bad member of the halogen family into the water they took the good halogen out and put the deadly

[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:00.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:10.520]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:41.240]  and i'm super bad i know this we're being played do people have beef people have problems with
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:45.960]  each other with did folks get screwed over here or there absolutely but it's being manipulated
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:52.520]  by the social engineers so i get discussed it by the white supremacist the black supremacist
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:57.640]  and all the rest of it but then if i was getting down at their level on the street i understand
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:02.760]  where it's coming from if i got thrown in shank wenton they got the black area the white area the
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:07.560]  Hispanic area the asian area and if you don't go be part of that area you're going to get killed
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:13.320]  or wish you were dead and the warden manages the whole thing that way and that's where we're going
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:21.400]  divide and conquer i want to just say the stela's are bright the stars are bright we can all see
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:27.800]  the heavens at night we can all have a bigger vision of actually what we stand for instead
[01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:34.040]  of being tribal but in a decadent dumbdown world that's not being turned around but you can pick
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:39.480]  a side all day long but the side that manipulated this is the deep state that's trying to create
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:46.200]  all the race war that covers up all the racial attacks on white people and vice versa to just
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:52.600]  continue to build this this division and this class war not between the general public calling for a
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:59.320]  better system based on free market but a class war the government can control and then order
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:04.040]  society according to that because we're too busy fighting with each other about what color we are
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:13.000]  versus the type of government we actually have so we are joined by jason chesler who all i know
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:19.240]  him by is what the news says white nationalist organize this uh you know he's out there blah
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:24.520]  blah blah then i hear what he says he just says oh i'm just tired of whites being bashed all day
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:29.320]  and they can have all the you know black entertainment television then we can have a group saying you
[01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:34.440]  know whites have rights and you know i see that but but the larger issue is do you not see what
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:41.240]  you're walking into uh and so i've got uh gavin wenz our great camera guy and also millie weaver
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:45.560]  here if you guys have any questions or comments but i want you to be able to finish your statements
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:51.880]  that you were making jason chesler when we went to break go ahead yeah i was just saying that it's
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:36:01.880]  not just about um well being a white identitarian in 2017 is in a defensive position and it's not
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:07.880]  just about people talking bad to us or whatever they are enacting policies which are tantamount to
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:12.760]  ethnic cleansing of white people so if you believe that every people on the planet has a right to
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:19.480]  exist then you have to be able to support uh white identity politics because whether white people
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:25.880]  try and have the moral high ground or not the about identity politics uh there are still going
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:32.280]  to be groups like muslims have care the NAACP and these are powerful political weapons and what
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:36.520]  they're being so what you're saying is the political system is organizing people into groups
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:41.720]  while telling whites you're not allowed to ever organize into a group yeah so you're not going
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:47.800]  to be able to maintain any kind of equilibrium within like i don't believe that united states
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:52.440]  should be all white what i believe is that it should be the traditional demographic to the
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:59.960]  country prior to 1965 just like i uh i believe that europe should be mostly white too and i believe
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:06.440]  that japan should be mostly japanese but but the major universities say white is inherently evil
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:10.920]  and must be exterminated that is official u.s government policy now and and but you're being
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:16.760]  a racist saying all whites should not be killed yeah that's all i'm trying to do is make sure that
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:22.520]  every race on the planet is able to survive but there's sure but expanding on that but no i mean
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:27.240]  i mean i get the fact that there's a double cross of christian conservatism and the civil rights act
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:31.960]  and the left is now engaged in race politics what i'm saying is if we engage in the race
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:38.120]  politic it feeds into that whole system instead of transcending it and exposing it because a very
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:45.320]  evil group replacing us with computers and robots and globalism is admittedly sabotaging the family
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:51.880]  and the sexes and in cia declassified documents admitting it's a plan to end humanity as we
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:57.320]  know it isn't that the message to unify humans together against the psychopathic globalist
[01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:04.120]  their technocracy well it's not just race as you say there's also a gender issue the traditional
[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:10.840]  families have been torn apart by feminism and that is uh i'm saying it's a scientific human
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:15.640]  extremism by the elites who are to your listening to ai and believing they're gonna merge with it
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:20.120]  i mean that's why elon musk is being honest and saying the big threat isn't north korea or race war
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:27.320]  it's the computers let me bring in gavin went to pick up our uh our own towards the carry for a
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:31.320]  certain issue if you're fighting for the traditional families do that but somebody
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:36.920]  has to stand up for white people and you face such enormous hatred but the universities i mean it's
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:41.560]  true do teach that white people are inherently bad that is a great racism how do folks expect
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:46.440]  you're not to be a response to that i get it i'm saying the manipulation is to create the clash
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:50.920]  so we're all fighting with each other when we're just humans while the globalist engineers come
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:55.400]  on bring in gabin when it's cameraman pepper sprayed attack videos are on info wars dot com
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:39:00.520]  with the reporter millie waver you have any questions or comments for the for the organizer
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:06.360]  of the event you want to cover that you've got a tact for being there well one thing i would like
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:12.440]  to mention is that part of the reason why i made the false flag reminder oklahoma city bombing video
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:18.280]  video is to remind all of us that they've been trying to push this white nationalist terrorist
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:25.640]  uh you mean for a very long time and you know with donald trump is president and stuff now
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:30.680]  we need to make sure that we don't slip into exactly what they want us to what they've wanted
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:38.040]  us to do exactly if they've tailored a suit for us let's not wear it that's exactly and i hear
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:45.640]  what i hear what kessler is saying but the problem is by doing some of these activities
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:54.520]  we're literally like you're saying wearing a p a pre frat a pre created uniform so that we can
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:00.200]  look exactly how they want us to look as part of their agenda rather than us transcending the whole
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:04.920]  thing and looking the way we want to look through our own but how do you transcend this kessler
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:11.160]  well first of all i want to thank you guys for coming out and uh covering the rally and i'm sorry
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.960]  you got attacked at my rally i i promised you i did everything within my power to make sure
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:24.840]  everybody was safe at the rally if they the police just stood down um so i i do believe that um
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:32.440]  what was your question sorry what were you asking jevin well i i really didn't ask him
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:38.280]  anything i can't say that i was targeted because i was starting to scratch at the surface as to why
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:44.280]  and how the black live matter group and the antifa were there and as soon as i started getting some
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:49.880]  intel about them being board foundation and jorb soros people that's when i got attacked
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:54.440]  and if you go back and watch the video you were making you were making the point about playing
[01:40:54.440 --> 01:41:00.200]  into the narrative of where the national media and the deep state is trying to push the white
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:06.520]  nationalist terrorist meme or whatever so first of all like there's a distinction between where i'm at
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:12.600]  and where some other people at there are some young men out there who have are so tired of being called
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:18.600]  the racist nazi whatever that they just dive into it uh headlong and they're like i know i get it
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:23.400]  you're calling me a nazi so i'm gonna be a nazi that yeah i know that doesn't look good that's not
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:28.760]  what i'm trying to do although there were people out there like that but but it's one thing i've
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:35.560]  learned about crowd dynamics is if you invite people out to an event you are going to be judged
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:40.760]  by the worst elements of it that's how it works all right thank you for joining us if you want to
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:45.480]  come back on tomorrow or in the weekday show jason kessler to have a longer time to put out your
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:49.960]  ideas i would have the antifa on i would have george soros on if they did they're there they won't
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:55.640]  do it but i appreciate you coming on and spending time with us jason kessler dot net we'll obviously

[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:16.760]  you're listening to the antidote for fake news it's alex jones
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:23.640]  you know i don't set up here and try to come up with the answer that i think is the most
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:28.360]  palatable of the public to make the general public happy to come up with what i believe we'll try to
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:33.880]  defeat the technocracy that openly wants to enslave humanity i mean here's an example
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:42.120]  i remember 20 years ago when they were trying to push these led light bulbs which i'm being bombarded
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:47.800]  with right now and other systems from incandescent that incandescent's just organic the way it flows
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:54.200]  light but with led it's like a particle beam it builds up the charge and then hyper pulses it at a
[01:47:54.200 --> 01:48:01.080]  rate your eye can't even differentiate and then that causes they admitted major studies brain damage
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:11.320]  headaches serious serious problems you can't even hardly buy studio lights that aren't led now
[01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:14.840]  i'm looking at trying to spend more money to get stuff that isn't just it's incredible
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:19.960]  but professor here's why eco-friendly lights bulbs are causing headaches i don't care if you black
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:24.840]  white is spanish what you are we should have a discussion about that why the government mandated
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:30.840]  well we got some documents on that artificial intelligence a greater threat than north korea
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:36.440]  says tech magnet elon musk absolutely not the technology is bad it's how it's being programmed
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:43.160]  so no one talks about the robots or the ai or the elites it's all like a white guy or a black guy
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:47.480]  and they can get some idiots to go fight with each other and then both groups have a reason
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:51.160]  they're there and a beef and you can listen to both groups and they've got an excuse
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:49:00.200]  but then my reporters go there and other reporters and get attacked by antifa and the media says it's
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:05.560]  the right wingers it's it's not about who did right or wrong i just report what's going on
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:09.800]  i'm not smart enough to sit here and look at something and then make something up about it
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:15.160]  there's too much happening i'm completely programmed to just tell you what's going on
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:20.840]  so gabin wins i want to play here in a few minutes a clip of you being attacked
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:24.840]  along with millie and pepper spray but just just your final takeaways from this
[01:49:26.840 --> 01:49:33.400]  i really think we need to stop playing in the terminology that the establishment has created
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:38.360]  to more or less use everybody in a pawn game exactly hillary calls everybody that doesn't like
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:42.600]  her all right then she has white supremacist march under the banner it's not hard to figure that out
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:48.280]  you know instead of white nationalist why can't this be called american traditionalist
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:55.320]  or something that they're not using so that they have to play a game as well of having to you know
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:50:00.760]  capture the language we're using you know exactly we should not adhere genius we should not play
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:06.120]  into the terms they're giving us definitely and my takeaway from this whole thing is that
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:12.440]  i do think that the the group jason kesler and them they should definitely sue um go about
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:18.600]  means by crowdfunding to sue over discrimination if you're you're worried that because you're
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:23.000]  white and you have progressive out there hating you that somehow you're going to be discriminated
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:28.760]  against sue do petitions exactly as a group of saying blacks were subhuman kill blacks they'd
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:34.200]  be sued and you'd win sue them exactly that's a good point for the universities out there who are
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:41.240]  doing like no white people days and stuff sue sue them in the bankruptcy get smart about it going out
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:45.320]  and protesting yes you have a right to protest and the but it's much smarter to sue millie you're
[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:49.720]  a genius and i'll be back back on tomorrow gavin but you haven't had as much time i'm sorry i was
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:56.520]  interrupting because it's so true what you're saying finish your point well it's just part of
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:51:02.440]  the motivation for going to these events because millie and i are both in danger doing it is the
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:07.960]  more times we show up at these the more video footage we get the more we realize it's the same
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:14.680]  people over and over again getting busted and it doesn't matter if we're in texas ohio virginia
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:20.360]  we're literally seeing the same players at each of these on both sides we even have video footage
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:25.960]  of people on the left and the right admitting that they're paid agitators professional protesters
[01:51:25.960 --> 01:51:32.200]  going to these things to help the establishment curtail it into exactly the direction they want
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:38.280]  it and that's basically what's going on and you guys never got the credit it's not about credit
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:43.480]  we put it out it got big news the cops busted them over this and what portain found like the guy
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:48.200]  hitting the lady in the head with a bike lock those stuff those were professors they're involved
[01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:52.440]  and that started with your investigation of them bailing out the attackers i mean you guys like
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:56.120]  you said you're just busy on the road you're about to put it out tonight tomorrow come on tomorrow
[01:51:56.120 --> 01:52:01.000]  you have the footage of the right wing and the left wing they're the same people it's all actors
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:08.200]  basically well and then you have individuals like cornell west who you know forever i thought he was
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:16.840]  a peaceful uh uh activist for for african-americans come to find out that what he's doing with others
[01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:24.120]  is they use the veil of peace to coordinate with the violent agitators so that you've got the quote
[01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:31.320]  unquote peaceful protesters locking themselves arm in arm behind the the white nationalist
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:35.960]  so that what ends up happening is is that the the violent protesters have their way with the
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:41.400]  white nationalist and the peace you know the so-called peaceful protesters get the walk away
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:46.600]  unscathed and then they get interviewed and woes me all these violent white supremacists
[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:52.280]  when really it was a very coordinated effort by the left where they use a sort of a duplet a
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:59.880]  double of both peaceful and violent together as it's all coordinated and they were um what what you
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:05.000]  forgot to say was that the peaceful ones that were singing and in church choir outfits with cornell
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:11.400]  west they were linked arm in arm so that when the antifa um attacked the united right rally
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:16.120]  attendees that were out in the street when they tried to run back to where the medic area was
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:21.480]  they actually were you know arm in arm blocking them from being able to do so so the antifa
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:26.440]  could continue to you know fight them and the antifa and the united the right rally people
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:30.920]  had to actually push through and bulldoze through those people and then they can go woes me you
[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:37.560]  know they they tackled me or rammed through me and you know you think it's peaceful but these were
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:42.200]  groups that were undoubtedly the stage and trump says i declare all hate let's come together let's
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:45.960]  love each other but we need to investigate this and there was both sides coming to fight
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:50.600]  it's totally true i mean like you said a couple hundred folks on the white you know white nationalist
[01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:55.640]  side most of our reporters covering it like you you're being attacked we have endless videos
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:54:00.760]  that i can't even get to here so they'll cut into your time they're all on info wars.com
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:05.400]  and i'm not complaining i'm very proud of this but folks we just so much good work we do doesn't
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:11.160]  get the coverage it needs it's all the listeners and viewers to appreciate the footage the raw hours
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:17.000]  of footage that you and Gavin shot that was so dangerous to you to see the proof and i just see
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.280]  the hill that others that are so pro soros being attacked themselves is that not a wake-up Gavin
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:27.800]  to them that they got physically attacked too just because they look like meth heads i don't know
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:33.160]  maybe it is maybe it isn't we were seeing a lot of friendly fire happening on the antifa side
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:39.240]  because they're so overly deploying for lack of a better term chemical weapons on everybody
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:44.920]  that both sides were getting hit and they seem to say so i mean i'm all the footage i've seen no one
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:51.000]  on the quote right attack say what you want it's all just left-wing frothing and they seem so wimpy
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.880]  that every woman you see the better looking they are the more they're attacked even if they're on
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:55:01.640]  the left it's like weird men that want to attack women well it's like the guy that is there was
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:07.560]  attacking me he literally was punching me and hitting me and attacking me twice but he's such
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:12.440]  a scrawny little i'm not a big guy myself but he's so scrawny i didn't even really notice it
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:16.200]  it's not until he actually sprayed me directly in the eyes of pepper spray
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:22.520]  that he was able to you know have me stop filming well great job both of you keep on the road with
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:26.760]  the flyover country tens of millions watching thank you so much i'm going to end this transmission
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:31.400]  before the weekday show begins tomorrow 11 am central with white house aid people showed up
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:36.520]  looking for trouble tom bossered absolutely nails that we're going to go out to the end of the
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:41.160]  transmission with this but millie weaver and Gavin great job we really appreciate you both
[01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:47.000]  you're amazing here it is oh thank you mr. bosser where we're near not no i don't i don't i don't
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:54.520]  paint all right and others yeah went to charlottesville virginia chanting anti-semitic anti-african
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:56:01.400]  american and other racist slogans provoking the people of charlottesville virginia making them
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:09.240]  feel intimidated yes violence did break out one person was killed by one of these alt-right clan
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:17.720]  nazi protesters and you just decried both sides of this and this is the issue no no i didn't and
[01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:22.200]  you're making this issue a little bit distorted so what i would decry is the individual that
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:29.160]  committed murder yesterday what i would do though is is quibble with this this notion that any of
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:35.320]  this is acceptable these groups showed up spewing hate these groups showed up looking for violence
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:39.160]  what i think it's just important for people to understand what groups are you referring to the
[01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:45.160]  groups that showed up well i i i referred to the groups that clashed yesterday i think it was pretty
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:50.360]  graphically evident are you talking about the neo-nazi neo-nazis are you talking about the counter
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:57.160]  protest one of the one of the things that i think the mayor will make clear to you and and probably
[01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:02.120]  stated earlier on your program i know he and i talked about this morning was the difficulty he
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:06.920]  had in planning for this event this was an event in which we anticipated violence in which he
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:13.480]  anticipated violence in which there was violence being rehearsed and planned for in events all right
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:17.400]  folks i don't have time to get the full clip we'll have more coverage tomorrow 11 am central
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:23.080]  bottom line it's staged doesn't matter who you are admit it's staged don't be part of the staging
