[00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.713]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-ups.
[00:00:09.713 --> 00:00:11.314]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.314 --> 00:00:12.254]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.254 --> 00:00:17.057]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.057 --> 00:00:32.246]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.246 --> 00:00:34.347]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome!
[00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:57.538]  It is the fourth day of May 2009 on this Monday edition of the worldwide broadcast against tyranny as we attempt to wake the people up to the private global corporate takeover of every sovereign nation on earth and the new tyrannical system that our once free countries is being replaced with.
[00:00:57.538 --> 00:01:00.099]  That is what we are fighting here.
[00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:02.300]  There can be no doubt that tyranny
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:16.023]  is growing across the planet that a world government is being set up for the administrative convenience of a group of international bankers in the words of David Rockefeller.
[00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:32.206]  We're going to have wide open phones today and then Dr. Jerome Corsi will be joining us in the third hour to cover the angle of the swine flu scare which now more and more appears to be a hoax as we said it probably would be day one.
[00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:51.245]  The international angle to all of this, how they openly have had drills through the SPP, North American Union body, to use the threat of and real, both real pandemics and the threat of pandemics, as a pretext to bring in the North American Union.
[00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:54.268]  You notice they talked about, and are still talking about, locking down U.S.
[00:01:54.268 --> 00:01:56.190]  cities, locking down some
[00:01:57.614 --> 00:02:06.744]  Hospitals and hotels, that's already happening, but quarantining whole cities, states if need be, but the border stays wide open.
[00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:07.925]  How ridiculous is that?
[00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:15.814]  Oh, the main threat is coming out of Mexico, but we're going to leave the border wide open and leave all the airplanes flying, but then we're going to have troops patrolling America and locking down cities.
[00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:21.520]  So that is coming up with Dr. Jerome Corsi in about two hours.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:33.683]  We've got a 15-minute interview coming up with a lady whose 16-year-old son is being held under terrorism charges in the Patriot Act because somebody over his Skype phone line supposedly made a bomb threat.
[00:02:33.683 --> 00:02:43.765]  Now, there is a practice, it has several different names, of making fake threats
[00:02:45.087 --> 00:03:12.648]  uh... bomb threats on innocent people in fact as i said here i had told rob do last week my producer that hey look at this guy in charge of the patriot act the mother says he was at church with them at the time this happened and i had even forgotten to make the point that i've seen a bunch of mainstream news articles and i can't remember the term
[00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:31.684]  I've got to Google it during the break, where people call in fake 911 calls to people's homes claiming there's a domestic dispute, someone's been killed, there's a hostage situation, and then the police show up and it's done over IP phone or Skype.
[00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:42.408]  And there's all these horrible SWAT team incidents where people get shot, officers get shot, citizens pull guns and get shot, and I forget what that's called.
[00:03:42.408 --> 00:03:43.008]  What is that called?
[00:03:43.008 --> 00:03:58.171]  It just popped in my head that this is her defense, and the article where it was claiming that she was saying it was a fake call, hacked over the Skype, didn't point out, when I was reading it last week, this is widespread and going on all over the place.
[00:03:59.076 --> 00:04:05.145]  And the government's using this as an excuse to make all IP phones traced and trackable as well.
[00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:07.047]  In fact, Rob, dude!
[00:04:07.047 --> 00:04:08.850]  No, he can't hear me out there.
[00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.931]  Hey, will somebody flag Rob?
[00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:12.455]  Anyways, that's a side issue.
[00:04:12.455 --> 00:04:14.036]  That's come up for about 15 minutes.
[00:04:14.036 --> 00:04:14.636]  Here's the deal.
[00:04:14.636 --> 00:04:22.198]  We've got massive new developments on the swine flu front, which is not really swine flu.
[00:04:22.198 --> 00:04:23.158]  It's a laboratory flu.
[00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:25.019]  The question is, how dangerous is it?
[00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:26.919]  Huge new developments.
[00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.321]  The World Health Organization is fear-mongering, saying that the flu will be back with a
[00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:34.222]  Vengeance is the headline.
[00:04:34.222 --> 00:04:42.686]  Huge developments on the Second Amendment front, not just the new treaty to ban reloading and importation or export of guns.
[00:04:42.686 --> 00:04:49.069]  Not just that, but we have massive martial law developments tied into everything that's happening.
[00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.771]  Very important transmission lined up today.
[00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:55.972]  Troops at the Kentucky Derby grabbing U.S.
[00:04:55.972 --> 00:04:57.052]  citizens, you name it.
[00:04:57.052 --> 00:04:58.093]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:58.093 --> 00:04:58.553]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.656 --> 00:05:02.817]  You are a rebel.
[00:05:02.817 --> 00:05:03.558]  Admit it.
[00:05:03.558 --> 00:05:06.521]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:08.924]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[00:05:08.924 --> 00:05:12.868]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[00:05:12.868 --> 00:05:14.911]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot.
[00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:16.152]  And you can count your real friends.
[00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:18.895]  We're good to go.
[00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:54.521]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:07.205 --> 00:06:13.090]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:19.514]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:19.514 --> 00:06:21.556]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:21.556 --> 00:06:24.018]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:06:24.018 --> 00:06:34.906]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:38.857]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:38.857 --> 00:06:40.719]  It's about a one world government.
[00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:47.623]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:06:47.623 --> 00:06:55.889]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:57.470]  The Obama Deception.
[00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.651]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.592 --> 00:07:10.317]  Hi, my name is MZ, owner of KSCO in Santa Cruz, California, and like Alex Jones, I'm passionate about talk radio, that great bastion of freedom of expression for us all.
[00:07:10.317 --> 00:07:24.124]  I'm also passionate about helping people know the joys, benefits, and surprisingly simple methods of becoming entrepreneurs who work for themselves and not as wage slaves for someone else, or even worse, for large companies with no heart and soul, nor loyalty to their employees.
[00:07:24.384 --> 00:07:43.572]  If you are tired of being dependent on others for a living and ready to start owning yourself, loving your work, and setting the sky as the limit for your earning potential, I want you to know about an exciting great business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that actually helps people lose weight and can help them make money, perhaps lots of it, just by helping us spread the word about this wonderful unique product.
[00:07:43.652 --> 00:07:43.972]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.656 --> 00:08:08.417]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.417 --> 00:08:10.177]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.177 --> 00:08:11.758]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.758 --> 00:08:13.318]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.318 --> 00:08:17.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.561]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.606 --> 00:08:39.671]  Alright, for nine days since last Saturday, Saturday before last, we've been on air saying that we believe this virus is manufactured.
[00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:49.017]  So that'll scare local virologists and people that look at it, because that's what's normally dangerous about a new flu, if it wildly mutates.
[00:08:49.017 --> 00:08:57.723]  This thing isn't wildly mutated, it is a fusion of four different viruses, completely new, with no pedigree anywhere in the world.
[00:08:57.723 --> 00:09:05.888]  And they have massive surveillance, private and public, institutional, governmental, you name it, studying flu viruses every year.
[00:09:05.888 --> 00:09:07.629]  This thing came out of the wrong hemisphere,
[00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:13.591]  Wrong time of year, absolutely engineered to scare the death out of people.
[00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:18.513]  And we kept saying since last Saturday that there were only a few deaths.
[00:09:18.513 --> 00:09:26.315]  So why were governments hyping this so much when normal flu kills between 200,000 and half a million people each year?
[00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:29.656]  You can Google global flu deaths yearly.
[00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:30.176]  You'll find 250,000, 400,000, 500,000.
[00:09:30.176 --> 00:09:31.116]  On average, it's 250-something thousand.
[00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:42.617]  It's like the United States on average they say is 36,000 but I've talked to doctors and many others who say that that number is hyped.
[00:09:42.617 --> 00:09:52.900]  Again, if an old person dies or something like that, they'll just mark on there that flu killed them if they happen to have flu when they died.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:59.141]  Now, that said, there are a lot of big developments on this front because we continue to break down the fact that
[00:10:00.117 --> 00:10:02.218]  Do they know something we don't know?
[00:10:02.218 --> 00:10:07.062]  Could this mutate into a more deadly, virulent form?
[00:10:07.062 --> 00:10:08.743]  Is that why they're so concerned?
[00:10:08.743 --> 00:10:11.585]  Do they know something we don't know?
[00:10:11.585 --> 00:10:13.586]  This thing is clearly engineered.
[00:10:13.586 --> 00:10:23.393]  The globalists are stated eugenicists in the 1996 United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment saying they want to get rid of at least 80% of us.
[00:10:23.393 --> 00:10:26.415]  State Department memorandum 200 saying get rid of half of us.
[00:10:26.415 --> 00:10:26.755]  That's from 73.
[00:10:26.755 --> 00:10:28.636]  See, the numbers grow.
[00:10:29.682 --> 00:10:32.344]  All the different Club of Rome statements, CFR statements.
[00:10:32.344 --> 00:10:34.907]  I'm going to read some of those on air today, by the way.
[00:10:34.907 --> 00:10:40.812]  So, we'd have to be crazy, out of our minds, to not take these eugenicists serious.
[00:10:40.812 --> 00:10:49.119]  Plus, the last few months we've seen an unprecedented build-up of drilling for mass graves for influenza in the U.S.
[00:10:49.119 --> 00:10:49.580]  and Europe.
[00:10:51.161 --> 00:10:55.908]  The federal government in FEMA contacting emergency management systems in other nations.
[00:10:55.908 --> 00:11:00.194]  Contacting private cemeteries saying we believe a huge influenza is coming.
[00:11:00.194 --> 00:11:02.979]  Can you bury a hundred thousand people on your back forty?
[00:11:04.008 --> 00:11:11.870]  We gave you the secret documents with the prison systems in the country getting ready for huge flus.
[00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:22.773]  We gave you the secret documents from New York State with the Feds directing them in private with the Bureau of Cemeteries to prepare for mass flu.
[00:11:22.773 --> 00:11:27.234]  We of course, and I called and confirmed here what the Daily Newscaster reported.
[00:11:27.734 --> 00:11:43.430]  With a emergency manager in Indiana on the border with Chicago saying FEMA came out and said harden your government buildings for basically them to be attacked and where can we have mass graves for millions dead out of Chicago?
[00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:58.237]  All of this, and then FEMA drills set for April and May nationwide, going back six months ago when we learned of them, for April and May, for mass grave, mass inoculations, breakdown of society.
[00:11:58.237 --> 00:12:03.479]  The clergy response team's documents we broke a year and a half before it was mainstream news.
[00:12:03.479 --> 00:12:06.280]  Hiring 16,000, then doubling to 26,000.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.001]  Since then we haven't gotten any new documents.
[00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:13.696]  But it was doubling, and 2008 it was to double again, so who knows what the numbers are.
[00:12:13.696 --> 00:12:28.212]  InfraGard, 55,000 people in private industry in quote, infrastructure, key infrastructure positions for infrastructure protection, would shoot to kill orders under martial law, any of their employees that don't follow federal orders.
[00:12:29.662 --> 00:12:31.363]  What is all of this?
[00:12:31.363 --> 00:12:33.245]  Why is all of this happening?
[00:12:33.245 --> 00:12:36.828]  Were they going to use a flu for the cover for martial law?
[00:12:36.828 --> 00:12:47.556]  Is this a beta test of federalizing local counties, cities, and states, setting up the mass death tents, the pandemic tents?
[00:12:47.556 --> 00:12:50.058]  I was watching CNN and Fox this morning, same script.
[00:12:50.678 --> 00:12:53.199]  Oh my gosh, they've set up the influenza tents.
[00:12:53.199 --> 00:12:54.800]  They're saying it could mutate.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.342]  It could be killing us all in the fall and winter.
[00:12:57.342 --> 00:13:00.883]  Exactly what I foresaw them doing last Saturday night on record.
[00:13:00.883 --> 00:13:02.104]  I know how they operate.
[00:13:02.104 --> 00:13:05.006]  I said, this is probably a beta test.
[00:13:05.006 --> 00:13:09.208]  But that is the true horror of this, is that we continue to be right here.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.945]  And now they're saying, oh yes, the fall, the winter, mass death, we're getting ready for it.
[00:13:15.945 --> 00:13:19.709]  You know, just five, six days ago, it was the greatest threat to face humanity.
[00:13:19.709 --> 00:13:21.611]  Tens of millions could die.
[00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:24.474]  Get ready, the worst threat in 90 years.
[00:13:24.474 --> 00:13:25.635]  Absolute bedlam.
[00:13:25.635 --> 00:13:30.420]  And I kept saying, folks, why are they hyping this for just a few deaths?
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.321]  What is the truth?
[00:13:32.486 --> 00:13:38.628]  Then we got secret State of Texas documents saying we were at level 4 but really at level 5 going to level 6.
[00:13:38.628 --> 00:13:42.929]  Then it came out days later, mainstream media, they were planning that.
[00:13:42.929 --> 00:13:45.530]  Are they lying to locals to hype them up for fear?
[00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:50.192]  Are they lying to the local constabulary to get them to roll over for federal and international control?
[00:13:50.192 --> 00:13:51.532]  We know they're under U.N.
[00:13:51.532 --> 00:13:51.992]  control.
[00:13:51.992 --> 00:13:53.433]  That's now confirmed.
[00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:56.514]  Under the executive orders, under the agreements, we're under treaty agreement.
[00:13:57.691 --> 00:13:59.512]  With the World Health Organization.
[00:13:59.512 --> 00:14:04.055]  That's why with NAFTA and GATT they're not allowed to use the stimulus money here domestically.
[00:14:04.055 --> 00:14:07.917]  Because NAFTA and GATT doesn't allow that.
[00:14:07.917 --> 00:14:11.279]  It doesn't allow only bids in the U.S.
[00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:18.443]  Just like we're under World Health Organization control and UNESCO control that Bush signed us back onto.
[00:14:18.443 --> 00:14:22.365]  That's why the people of Europe can be 85% against the Euro.
[00:14:22.365 --> 00:14:23.526]  They can't get out of it.
[00:14:23.526 --> 00:14:25.647]  Their criminal government signed them over to a treaty.
[00:14:29.181 --> 00:14:35.587]  Dr. Jerome Corsi coming up in an hour and 45 minutes to break that down with us today.
[00:14:35.587 --> 00:14:44.735]  So we have all of this going on, all of this happening, and it is a beta test for the total takeover.
[00:14:44.735 --> 00:14:52.862]  And you dovetail that with college football games, high school football games, hockey championships,
[00:14:53.561 --> 00:15:09.953]  Car shows, Bay Fest in Alabama, other city parties, Fiesta, year after year, going back ten years in San Antonio, they have regular Army, regular Air Force MPs out assisting police with citizens.
[00:15:09.953 --> 00:15:13.235]  Marines announcing they're running checkpoints all over the country.
[00:15:13.235 --> 00:15:16.318]  Army showing up at mass shootings, and now the Kentucky Derby!
[00:15:16.318 --> 00:15:18.800]  They've been there for eight years I know of, even before 9-11.
[00:15:23.018 --> 00:15:28.400]  The Super Bowl, everything, and this time some fans after the horse won the stupid race.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.421]  I don't usually watch horse races, though the horses are beautiful.
[00:15:31.421 --> 00:15:35.803]  I'm sitting there in Waterloo Ice House with my wife and children eating.
[00:15:35.803 --> 00:15:40.405]  They set us right in front of the big screen TV right as the race happens.
[00:15:40.405 --> 00:15:42.105]  And I look up.
[00:15:42.105 --> 00:15:49.989]  I don't even say anything to my wife to disturb her right after the jockey won, and I see troops running around on the field.
[00:15:49.989 --> 00:15:50.889]  Running around on the track.
[00:15:52.045 --> 00:15:53.586]  So I get home and I Google it.
[00:15:53.586 --> 00:15:58.669]  I look at Yahoo Photos and guess what I see?
[00:15:58.669 --> 00:16:08.814]  Regular army arresting US citizens that jumped onto the track with 45 sidearms on.
[00:16:08.814 --> 00:16:12.596]  Now, hours later I'm about to IM it to Kurt Nemo.
[00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:14.958]  Kurt Nemo must have been watching the Derby too.
[00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.038]  I haven't talked to him.
[00:16:16.038 --> 00:16:17.719]  He's out in New Mexico.
[00:16:17.719 --> 00:16:19.180]  Kurt Nemo wrote a story about it.
[00:16:20.984 --> 00:16:23.826]  That's who their track security was.
[00:16:23.826 --> 00:16:26.248]  Folks, that is a felony!
[00:16:26.248 --> 00:16:27.169]  And they do this on purpose.
[00:16:27.169 --> 00:16:28.690]  Remember three weeks ago?
[00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:44.763]  We find out from listeners in Tennessee, pointing out little local newspapers, that Regular Army, Homeland Security, State Police, Local Police, BATF, FBI, and a bunch of other agencies, I'm going to read them later, are out running warrantless checkpoints, shutting down highways, searching people.
[00:16:44.763 --> 00:16:46.725]  We got two great affiliates in Tennessee,
[00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.831]  One in Nashville.
[00:16:52.831 --> 00:16:57.354]  In fact, I keep forgetting it's owned by WWCR.
[00:16:57.354 --> 00:16:59.475]  Well, somebody call WWCR and give me the name of that affiliate.
[00:16:59.475 --> 00:17:00.535]  I've got to memorize these.
[00:17:00.535 --> 00:17:01.096]  Great affiliate.
[00:17:01.096 --> 00:17:02.256]  We're on there five days a week.
[00:17:02.256 --> 00:17:03.617]  Six days a week, excuse me.
[00:17:03.617 --> 00:17:05.438]  And we've got WBCR in Knoxville.
[00:17:05.438 --> 00:17:06.598]  Other great folks there.
[00:17:06.598 --> 00:17:07.299]  Harry Grothjohn.
[00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.914]  And so we had enough firepower on the air that Friday in the Infowar to get a ruckus going.
[00:17:13.914 --> 00:17:17.878]  The governor came out, we had a state rep on, and said, you're not going to do it.
[00:17:17.878 --> 00:17:19.259]  We thought, oh, we had a victory.
[00:17:19.259 --> 00:17:21.061]  You know what was in the newspaper Monday?
[00:17:21.061 --> 00:17:24.604]  Several local papers, they went ahead and did it!
[00:17:24.604 --> 00:17:34.273]  And then I got people emailing me and commenting in the message board at Prison Planet and in the articles at Infowars.com telling me I'm a fear monger about martial law.
[00:17:35.558 --> 00:17:37.759]  I told you this is incremental conditioning!
[00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:55.322]  It's what all the Army and Marine Corps drills are for, and now after over 12 years of me telling you this, it's now mainstream news they plan to use regular Army and Marines against the American people, and then it's not for Al-Qaeda, whether you believe that exists or not, it's for gun owners and vets!
[00:17:55.322 --> 00:17:57.983]  And landowners that don't hand it over to environmentalists.
[00:17:57.983 --> 00:18:02.864]  I was shown by a Marine in 1999 who would not let me have the tape.
[00:18:03.609 --> 00:18:15.540]  Because he said they would identify that it was him that shot it at an Air Force base in San Antonio, where they had over 200 role players screaming, you're not going to take our land, we're Americans, and they practiced mowing them down.
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.042]  And I said, listen, man, give me this tape.
[00:18:18.042 --> 00:18:20.544]  And he said, I can't do it, Mr. Jones.
[00:18:20.544 --> 00:18:21.025]  And he left.
[00:18:23.595 --> 00:18:26.776]  He drove up here, on leave, to show me the tape.
[00:18:26.776 --> 00:18:35.537]  Now, I've got similar footage I shot in Oakland, where they're screaming, I'm an American, no, not the camp, and watch this execution as they put the role player down and practice shooting him in the back of the head.
[00:18:35.537 --> 00:18:40.438]  So I've got, I mean, I've got cops walking up with Marines in Hebron, Maryland, saying, turn your cameras off.
[00:18:40.438 --> 00:18:45.439]  I got troops in Swansboro, North Carolina, running checkpoints in places in Alabama.
[00:18:45.439 --> 00:18:51.000]  And I got troops going door-to-door, telling people in Florida to not talk to me.
[00:18:53.513 --> 00:18:56.754]  But Brooksville, Florida, it's all in my police state films.
[00:18:56.754 --> 00:19:06.535]  There's the proof, but I wish I had that footage of them practicing with heavy caliber machine guns mowing the American people down.
[00:19:06.535 --> 00:19:11.596]  And he wouldn't give it to me.
[00:19:11.596 --> 00:19:14.557]  Somewhere around here, I've got the old TV show tape.
[00:19:14.557 --> 00:19:16.897]  Folks finally dug up the bribery caught on video.
[00:19:16.897 --> 00:19:18.437]  Folks didn't believe me when I said I had that footage.
[00:19:18.437 --> 00:19:21.898]  It'll pop back up even though I put it on TV a dozen times or more.
[00:19:21.898 --> 00:19:22.698]  Probably 50 times.
[00:19:24.226 --> 00:19:26.829]  That's how crazy stuff is in this office back in the days when it was just me.
[00:19:26.829 --> 00:19:28.891]  I had nobody to categorize it all.
[00:19:28.891 --> 00:19:31.353]  There's just warehouses of this crap.
[00:19:31.353 --> 00:19:39.080]  But I got footage of the Army and Air Force MPs before 9-11 in San Antonio searching citizens.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.682]  It's all a felony.
[00:19:40.682 --> 00:19:42.203]  It's all criminal.
[00:19:42.203 --> 00:19:43.605]  And I, for one, am sick of it.
[00:19:43.605 --> 00:19:45.426]  So we'll give you the latest flu news.
[00:19:46.308 --> 00:19:51.311]  When we get back, and it's big, more than 70 Mexicans quarantine in China in anti-flu measure.
[00:19:51.311 --> 00:19:55.433]  Swine flu could return with a vengeance, the World Health Organization's saying.
[00:19:55.433 --> 00:19:56.193]  And a lot more.
[00:19:56.193 --> 00:19:58.815]  Then we got the martial law news, the gun-grabbing news.
[00:19:58.815 --> 00:19:59.595]  It's all happening.
[00:19:59.595 --> 00:20:06.238]  Oh, and census.
[00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:07.899]  Health Lesson 101.
[00:20:07.899 --> 00:20:10.741]  Swine flu is the topic of news.
[00:20:10.741 --> 00:20:14.743]  Fear and panic seems to be at the top of our emotions.
[00:20:16.246 --> 00:20:21.531]  If your colon is cleansed of toxins, you are less susceptible to any flu virus.
[00:20:21.531 --> 00:20:25.794]  Viruses love unhealthy bodies and attack our system to make us sick.
[00:20:25.794 --> 00:20:28.116]  So get prepared before the attack.
[00:20:28.116 --> 00:20:29.458]  Drink your way to health.
[00:20:29.458 --> 00:20:32.400]  Order online at GetTheTea.com.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.683]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[00:20:35.683 --> 00:20:36.824]  Or call us at 928-308-0408.
[00:20:41.778 --> 00:20:42.219]  Again, 928-308-0408.
[00:20:42.219 --> 00:20:46.444]  No fear, no panic, just drink in the protection of Life Change Tea.
[00:21:00.672 --> 00:21:02.973]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:21:02.973 --> 00:21:03.534]  May 4th, 2009.
[00:21:03.534 --> 00:21:04.714]  Gold opened this morning at $8.90.70.
[00:21:04.714 --> 00:21:08.356]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.16.67, $4.58.34 for the half ounce, and $2.29.17 for a quarter ounce.
[00:21:08.356 --> 00:21:08.677]  That's $9.16.67, $4.58.34, or $2.29.17.
[00:21:20.243 --> 00:21:34.272]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes and servicing debt?
[00:21:34.272 --> 00:21:42.858]  Is this capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:43.118 --> 00:21:44.199]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:44.199 --> 00:21:48.604]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[00:21:48.604 --> 00:21:49.705]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:49.705 --> 00:21:50.666]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[00:21:50.666 --> 00:21:50.826]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.826 --> 00:21:51.066]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:51.066 --> 00:21:52.768]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[00:22:04.488 --> 00:22:07.110]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:14.696]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:22:14.696 --> 00:22:20.861]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:23.241]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:22:23.241 --> 00:22:25.742]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:22:25.742 --> 00:22:37.325]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:22:37.325 --> 00:22:39.005]  It's not about left or right.
[00:22:39.005 --> 00:22:40.866]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:22:40.866 --> 00:22:47.067]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:22:47.754 --> 00:22:56.023]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:56.023 --> 00:22:57.605]  The Obama Deception.
[00:22:57.605 --> 00:23:00.829]  The people strike back.
[00:23:00.829 --> 00:23:03.291]  Americans, do you know where your food comes from?
[00:23:03.291 --> 00:23:05.214]  Is it safe, secure, and healthy?
[00:23:05.214 --> 00:23:09.098]  Did you know most of our food is not contaminated with genetically modified ingredients?
[00:23:09.659 --> 00:23:18.665]  We at Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company have been helping people get pure garden seed for 12 years and carry over 1,200 varieties of GMO-free heirloom seed.
[00:23:18.665 --> 00:23:22.488]  Go to www.rareseeds.com for more information.
[00:23:22.488 --> 00:23:24.570]  That's rareseeds.com.
[00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:29.633]  Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company was started in 1998 by a 17-year-old as a hobby.
[00:23:29.633 --> 00:23:33.256]  It was developed out of a passion for preserving our vegetable heritage.
[00:23:33.256 --> 00:23:39.260]  The company now offers the largest selection of pure heirloom seeds, strive every year to bring back varieties like our forefathers grew.
[00:23:40.014 --> 00:23:44.175]  In times like these, we can't trust the government to keep our seeds safe.
[00:23:44.175 --> 00:23:48.717]  Every year at Baker Creek, we work to preserve the best of the oldest for future gardeners.
[00:23:48.717 --> 00:23:52.378]  We also offer affordable seed collections for long-term storage.
[00:23:52.378 --> 00:23:57.800]  Go to www.rareseeds.com and get your seeds from America's pure seed source.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.980]  That's rareseeds.com.
[00:24:05.288 --> 00:24:07.671]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:07.671 --> 00:24:20.686]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:20.686 --> 00:24:24.751]  Alright, on the legislative front coming up, Obama supports treaty outlawing gun possession.
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.121]  And that's how Lou Dobbs and a U.S.
[00:24:29.121 --> 00:24:33.823]  Senator put it, because you really read it, it does more than just ban black powder.
[00:24:33.823 --> 00:24:39.286]  It does more than just ban any type of changing barrels, or doing maintenance on any firearm, or importing or exporting.
[00:24:39.286 --> 00:24:48.931]  If you read the actual treaty, it gets into the UNIDEAR agreements, because UN laws are so corrupt, they say, oh, we pass this law, and then all of these other
[00:24:49.511 --> 00:24:53.694]  Treaties we've passed in the past or these conventions we've passed also apply.
[00:24:53.694 --> 00:25:02.602]  So you've got to go read those where it says all civilian ownership of any type of firearm will be banned because there has to be a legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[00:25:02.602 --> 00:25:04.163]  That's a quote by the way.
[00:25:04.163 --> 00:25:08.006]  So just, here's Obama after saying, oh don't worry I don't want your guns.
[00:25:08.006 --> 00:25:10.708]  I just want to do a few things, a few reasonable things.
[00:25:10.708 --> 00:25:12.610]  Those few things are completely taking your guns.
[00:25:15.862 --> 00:25:20.543]  I mean, it's not enough that they've... Oh, by the way, I've got the new headline here.
[00:25:20.543 --> 00:25:22.864]  Bloomberg is now reporting over $14 trillion.
[00:25:22.864 --> 00:25:26.705]  So it was $12.7 trillion, I'm sorry.
[00:25:26.705 --> 00:25:31.126]  Now it's $14 plus trillion.
[00:25:31.126 --> 00:25:33.566]  So just, it's getting absolutely amazing.
[00:25:33.566 --> 00:25:37.247]  That is coming up as well.
[00:25:37.247 --> 00:25:38.488]  Some good legislative news.
[00:25:38.488 --> 00:25:40.568]  Update, HR 1207 now has up to 112 co-sponsors.
[00:25:44.028 --> 00:25:53.456]  To imagine this actually audit the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve that says it's above the law.
[00:25:53.456 --> 00:25:54.476]  So that is coming up.
[00:25:54.476 --> 00:25:58.680]  Also, new news on Bilderberg meeting set coming up here very, very soon.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:03.684]  We'll have reports from Jim Tucker from Greece as that unfolds early next month.
[00:26:05.043 --> 00:26:08.867]  Okay, here's the flu news, and I'm going to get into the martial law news, okay?
[00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:09.909]  Here are the headlines.
[00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:13.393]  More than 70 Mexicans quarantined in China in anti-flu measure.
[00:26:13.393 --> 00:26:15.175]  They grabbed them out of their rooms at 4 a.m.
[00:26:15.175 --> 00:26:19.660]  in SWAT team style, so there wouldn't be any media attention, so they wouldn't resist, so they'd all be asleep.
[00:26:21.442 --> 00:26:23.263]  It's like in the Soviet Union, they come at 4 a.m.
[00:26:23.263 --> 00:26:23.944]  They come here at 4 a.m.
[00:26:23.944 --> 00:26:25.705]  It's all part of freedom.
[00:26:25.705 --> 00:26:29.649]  Swine flu can return with a vengeance, the World Health Organization says.
[00:26:29.649 --> 00:26:34.052]  Chan of the World Health Organization hits back at WHO critics.
[00:26:34.052 --> 00:26:35.473]  We'll get into that.
[00:26:35.473 --> 00:26:39.636]  Also, swine flu may merge with other flu viruses, CDC says.
[00:26:39.636 --> 00:26:48.564]  So, see, and the genetic engineers and virologists and doctors that we've talked to and had on say that's what's so interesting about this is it's made to mutate quickly.
[00:26:49.224 --> 00:26:51.486]  And it's such a novel super virus.
[00:26:51.486 --> 00:26:57.011]  It's super in how it's totally new and mixed.
[00:26:57.011 --> 00:27:01.615]  It has all these wild connectors on it so it can just tie into any genetics it wants.
[00:27:01.615 --> 00:27:04.357]  It's an amazing seed virus.
[00:27:04.357 --> 00:27:08.841]  So, are they going to release some new mutation of this and claim it naturally happened?
[00:27:08.841 --> 00:27:11.123]  Is this the setup, the gear up?
[00:27:11.123 --> 00:27:17.188]  I don't know, folks, but their whole architecture is built around using an influenza
[00:27:18.915 --> 00:27:22.017]  As their cover for total martial law takeover.
[00:27:22.017 --> 00:27:23.797]  And think of what a perfect plan it is.
[00:27:23.797 --> 00:27:27.539]  As they implode the economy, as they take over, as they announce the bank of the world.
[00:27:27.539 --> 00:27:30.901]  Right as resistance begins to mount, this happens.
[00:27:30.901 --> 00:27:37.604]  Getting all the real news out of the, off the front cover of the newspapers, magazines and TV.
[00:27:37.604 --> 00:27:43.307]  And then, also creating fear and testing the federal takeover, the globalist takeover.
[00:27:44.571 --> 00:27:45.111]  And the U.N.
[00:27:45.111 --> 00:27:45.552]  said that.
[00:27:45.552 --> 00:27:51.597]  Oh, this is great for the U.N., great for globalism, all of us coming together, testing the new global governance.
[00:27:51.597 --> 00:27:57.441]  Swine flu may merge with other flu viruses, CDC says.
[00:27:57.441 --> 00:27:59.883]  Senator proposes free flu shots for all Americans.
[00:27:59.883 --> 00:28:02.505]  He wants 600 million shots.
[00:28:02.505 --> 00:28:04.086]  That's two for every American.
[00:28:04.086 --> 00:28:10.311]  Democratic Senator proposed Friday setting up a free nationwide volunteer flu vaccination program to fend off future outbreaks and dangerous strains.
[00:28:10.311 --> 00:28:10.872]  We'll get into that.
[00:28:13.081 --> 00:28:16.864]  Swine flu a hoax, says Paul Watson, but martial law all too real.
[00:28:16.864 --> 00:28:19.026]  Key article I'm going to read in its entirety.
[00:28:19.026 --> 00:28:22.268]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:28:22.268 --> 00:28:25.270]  Also, just an interesting story about who these companies are.
[00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:30.935]  Merck that brought you Vioxx that caused all the heart attacks.
[00:28:30.935 --> 00:28:35.818]  Merck that brought you the Gardasil that's killed all the girls in Maine, so many others.
[00:28:35.818 --> 00:28:40.402]  It doesn't even protect you from the genital warts virus that sometimes can turn into cancer.
[00:28:41.465 --> 00:28:42.306]  Very easy to treat.
[00:28:42.306 --> 00:28:44.928]  This is out of the American Journal of Bioethics.
[00:28:44.928 --> 00:28:51.013]  And Merck got caught staging a bunch of fake peer-reviewed journals.
[00:28:51.013 --> 00:28:52.034]  Well, of course!
[00:28:52.034 --> 00:28:59.560]  When you hear Merck funds some government study with the government, saying mercury's good for your brain, it's not good for your brain, folks.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.702]  But of course they got journals that say this.
[00:29:01.702 --> 00:29:02.963]  I mean, they got journals.
[00:29:02.963 --> 00:29:07.186]  Other companies did what Searle and Monsanto in 1981 to get it approved in 1982.
[00:29:07.186 --> 00:29:07.767]  They got approval!
[00:29:12.142 --> 00:29:14.424]  They got approval.
[00:29:14.424 --> 00:29:15.465]  Say it again.
[00:29:15.465 --> 00:29:25.475]  They got approval with their own studies where more than half, what was it, 54% of the rhesus monkeys they fed aspartame to in their mother's milk, they mixed it, died.
[00:29:25.475 --> 00:29:29.179]  A bunch of the others that lived got brain tumors.
[00:29:29.179 --> 00:29:32.262]  And they used that and said, well, because a small percentage lived, it's okay.
[00:29:33.595 --> 00:29:34.816]  Gotta love it.
[00:29:34.816 --> 00:29:39.419]  Also, a reporter tries to get tested for swine flu after being held in quarantine.
[00:29:39.419 --> 00:29:42.821]  Wall Street Journal, get into all the martial law news and a lot more.
[00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:43.782]  It's all coming up.
[00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:45.203]  Massive news blitz.
[00:29:45.203 --> 00:29:46.704]  Key information.
[00:29:46.704 --> 00:29:50.947]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.947 --> 00:29:52.328]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.328 --> 00:29:54.870]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.572]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.848 --> 00:30:06.249]  Have you ever read the ingredients in your skin creams, personal hygiene products, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
[00:30:06.249 --> 00:30:14.811]  Did you know that most skin creams, body lotions, shampoos, and toothpastes contain chemical additives such as sodium lauryl sulfate, the same type of detergent used in dish soap?
[00:30:14.811 --> 00:30:18.372]  Did you know that many multivitamin supplements are made from synthetic vitamins?
[00:30:18.372 --> 00:30:21.592]  Do your herbal remedies have unwanted additives and fillers?
[00:30:21.592 --> 00:30:24.093]  Have you ever tested your body's pH level?
[00:30:24.093 --> 00:30:27.073]  Make the change to organic health and beauty products.

[00:30:54.057 --> 00:30:57.199]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:07.492 --> 00:31:13.374]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:31:13.374 --> 00:31:19.876]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:19.876 --> 00:31:21.857]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:21.857 --> 00:31:24.298]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[00:31:24.298 --> 00:31:35.182]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:31:37.483 --> 00:31:39.164]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:39.164 --> 00:31:41.025]  It's about a one world government.
[00:31:41.025 --> 00:31:47.929]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.929 --> 00:31:56.193]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:56.193 --> 00:31:57.754]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.754 --> 00:31:58.935]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.836 --> 00:32:02.137]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:02.137 --> 00:32:07.720]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:12.742]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:32:12.742 --> 00:32:18.305]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:32:18.305 --> 00:32:23.548]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:32:23.548 --> 00:32:25.409]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:32:25.836 --> 00:32:30.659]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:31.760]  And here's the best part.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.842]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:32:34.842 --> 00:32:38.465]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:32:38.465 --> 00:32:41.647]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:41.647 --> 00:32:43.869]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:43.869 --> 00:32:44.809]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:32:44.809 --> 00:32:45.009]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:32:45.009 --> 00:32:46.130]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[00:32:54.946 --> 00:32:57.487]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:32:57.487 --> 00:33:02.069]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:33:02.069 --> 00:33:05.551]  Man thinks, cause he rules the earth.
[00:33:05.551 --> 00:33:09.573]  He can do it as he please.
[00:33:09.573 --> 00:33:17.476]  And if things don't change soon, he will.
[00:33:17.476 --> 00:33:21.178]  Oh man has invented his doom.
[00:33:21.178 --> 00:33:23.819]  First step was touching the moon.
[00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:39.455]  Now there's a woman on my block She'll just sit there as the night grows still She'll say, who's gonna take away his license to kill?
[00:33:39.455 --> 00:33:52.260]  Now they take him and they teach him And they groom him for life And they set him on a path where his bounty
[00:33:56.104 --> 00:33:59.407]  We are back live.
[00:33:59.407 --> 00:34:01.668]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:34:23.248 --> 00:34:30.646]  He's afraid and confused and his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
[00:34:34.591 --> 00:34:46.179]  Yeah, that's a song about a mother in front of the White House for year after year who lost her son protesting against war.
[00:35:07.972 --> 00:35:09.954]  Alright, let me go ahead and break down the news.
[00:35:09.954 --> 00:35:13.938]  I went through the latest, at least the headlines with the flu.
[00:35:13.938 --> 00:35:18.343]  I'm going to go back over that.
[00:35:18.343 --> 00:35:28.213]  Then I have the financial news that the swine flu hysteria has been used as a cover for, as that intensifies.
[00:35:31.152 --> 00:35:36.094]  Let's go ahead and cover, there's so much important news today, I'm almost in overload mode.
[00:35:36.094 --> 00:35:43.456]  Let's go ahead and cover the Marshall Law facet first, because all of this has to be connected in together.
[00:35:43.456 --> 00:35:47.117]  All of this has to be taken as a whole.
[00:35:47.117 --> 00:35:59.401]  If you look at one part of it, whereas it's unconstitutional, police state, thuggish, still, to fully understand it, you've got to look at it as one big piece, and then analyze the sub-parts.
[00:36:00.592 --> 00:36:08.170]  You know, we get up here on air and we say year after year, the bankers in their own documents and here are their documents, A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
[00:36:09.352 --> 00:36:15.033]  Right down the line, stating they're going to bankrupt the world economy using fiat debt bubbles they create.
[00:36:15.033 --> 00:36:28.076]  Then they're going to make the world come to the very same bankers who, with the stroke of the pen, will bail the planet out with a new bank of the world that sets the currency rates, the interest rates, controls the nations, and that you pay your carbon taxes to.
[00:36:28.076 --> 00:36:31.017]  And now that has been announced everywhere.
[00:36:31.017 --> 00:36:32.857]  They've been pushing for it for more than a hundred years.
[00:36:36.707 --> 00:36:38.248]  Cecil Rhodes, the British Empire.
[00:36:38.248 --> 00:36:41.109]  They published scores of books bragging about how they would do it.
[00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:43.771]  And we're now under this system.
[00:36:43.771 --> 00:36:44.691]  Is it the British people?
[00:36:44.691 --> 00:36:50.655]  No, it's that model of control and the Bank of England setting up the Federal Reserve here in the United States.
[00:36:53.103 --> 00:36:56.826]  And so I get up on air and I say, listen, I went to an urban warfare drill.
[00:36:56.826 --> 00:36:59.829]  Here's the video where they're training to take your guns.
[00:36:59.829 --> 00:37:13.101]  And people see the video, and it's so shocking and so unbelievable, as they witness Marines training to kill Americans and take our guns, that people in 1998 and 99 would simply say, it's fake, those aren't real Marines.
[00:37:13.101 --> 00:37:17.685]  And I'd say, wait a minute, on the video we show you the local news articles on top of it.
[00:37:17.685 --> 00:37:18.866]  And they go, no, that's fake too.
[00:37:20.836 --> 00:37:27.249]  Now that was the level of denial that people were 10, 11, 12 years ago.
[00:37:27.249 --> 00:37:29.493]  I would go interview a police chief in South Texas.
[00:37:30.669 --> 00:37:36.731]  Jack D. Compton saying, yeah, foreign troops were here doing the drill, but we can't tell the locals what they were doing.
[00:37:36.731 --> 00:37:42.092]  And I'd show an emergency manager saying, yeah, they admitted to me it's for martial law, gun confiscation drill.
[00:37:42.092 --> 00:37:48.314]  You know, Thomas Sanchez, Kingsville, Texas, on video, good guy, telling you what really happened.
[00:37:48.314 --> 00:37:59.078]  Chief of Police in San Antonio, saying Delta Force came in, tried to bribe him and others with big bags of money to work covertly with the police.
[00:37:59.078 --> 00:38:00.138]  And I showed everybody that.
[00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:10.696]  Over and over and over and over and over again, I have done the best job I can.
[00:38:10.696 --> 00:38:13.519]  In fact, here I am two years ago.
[00:38:13.519 --> 00:38:18.782]  Folks, I forgot to give this to you.
[00:38:18.782 --> 00:38:21.805]  Pull up YouTube it, guys, because I want to play it.
[00:38:23.098 --> 00:38:25.140]  Alex Jones on San Antonio television.
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:25.660]  Here, I found it.
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:26.921]  I meant to play this today.
[00:38:26.921 --> 00:38:27.321]  Here it is.
[00:38:27.321 --> 00:38:28.022]  I printed it off.
[00:38:28.022 --> 00:38:29.082]  I forgot to give it to you.
[00:38:29.082 --> 00:38:32.165]  Alex Jones discusses martial law on CBS San Antonio.
[00:38:32.165 --> 00:38:39.570]  Cue that up, because I want people to hear me back in August of 2007, almost two years ago, breaking down.
[00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.591]  Homeland security is for the patriots.
[00:38:41.591 --> 00:38:43.653]  Homeland security is for the gun owners.
[00:38:43.653 --> 00:38:46.535]  This whole anti-terror thing is for the American people.
[00:38:46.535 --> 00:38:48.997]  They're going to announce they're going to have brigade homeland
[00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:51.873]  Northcom on the streets of America.
[00:38:51.873 --> 00:38:54.194]  And then a year and a half later, it's mainstream news.
[00:38:54.194 --> 00:38:55.956]  Come take it.
[00:38:55.956 --> 00:38:58.378]  And I remember when I did that on San Antonio TV.
[00:38:58.378 --> 00:39:00.740]  You can go read the thousands of comments on there.
[00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:02.901]  You know, the 100,000 views or whatever it is.
[00:39:02.901 --> 00:39:04.303]  And they're like, he's making it up!
[00:39:04.303 --> 00:39:05.664]  He's a fear monger!
[00:39:05.664 --> 00:39:07.025]  That's not gonna happen!
[00:39:07.025 --> 00:39:09.607]  They're not gonna announce Northcoms for America!
[00:39:09.607 --> 00:39:16.733]  And then they announce it and people say, okay, big deal.
[00:39:18.479 --> 00:39:34.607]  And I'm telling you, they're gonna try to use some type of hyped-up superflu, whether it really is a deadly flu or not, in the future, and I've been saying this for the last few months in earnest, because I can see their build-up, their propaganda, and everything you're seeing right now is just more of the build-up!
[00:39:34.607 --> 00:39:38.169]  And I said last Saturday, eight, nine days ago, I said, you watch.
[00:39:39.261 --> 00:39:45.367]  They're going to claim it's going to mutate with other viruses, and they're going to claim it's going to mutate into a deadly strain, and that this is only the beginning.
[00:39:45.367 --> 00:39:50.411]  And then Sunday, Janet Napolitano, the head of Homeland Security, comes out and says just that in Reuters.
[00:39:50.411 --> 00:39:56.617]  She says, yeah, well, this will probably peter out, but the next big one, super deadly, is sure to come soon.
[00:39:56.617 --> 00:39:58.639]  And then now that's all they're saying today.
[00:40:00.441 --> 00:40:06.584]  Reuters, AFP, AP headlines, swine flu could return with vengeance.
[00:40:06.584 --> 00:40:08.665]  Swine flu to return with vengeance.
[00:40:08.665 --> 00:40:10.846]  Who says swine flu to return with vengeance?
[00:40:10.846 --> 00:40:15.708]  Those are the three different headlines.
[00:40:15.708 --> 00:40:24.912]  They told local governments, they told national governments, the UN told China and everybody else this thing was super deadly and probably going to kill millions and the greatest threat to mankind in its history.
[00:40:25.768 --> 00:40:33.031]  And so of course China's freaking out and locking everything down, because they also are using it as a pretext to pose as the saviors and the rulers.
[00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:37.253]  Same thing in Mexico, on the verge of collapse, they're using it as a unifying effect.
[00:40:37.253 --> 00:40:41.995]  I know how these people operate.
[00:40:41.995 --> 00:40:47.277]  And you always hear me when I talk about troops at Super Bowl, troops at Kentucky Derby, troops here, troops there.
[00:40:47.277 --> 00:40:52.479]  There I am, eating dinner, Saturday night, five o'clock,
[00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:58.874]  My wife says, oh look, the Kentucky Derby, look at the pretty horses.
[00:40:58.874 --> 00:41:04.639]  She's looking away, sitting there eating her hamburger, and I'm looking up and see troops running around on the track.
[00:41:04.639 --> 00:41:12.427]  And I just go, oh man, I can't even come eat a hamburger.
[00:41:12.427 --> 00:41:16.671]  I can't even sit here without seeing troops run around on the big screen TVs in there.
[00:41:18.626 --> 00:41:22.929]  So I'm sitting there watching this, and I go home, and that night, guess what?
[00:41:22.929 --> 00:41:38.858]  When I get home late at night after working on a new secret film we're about to release, I'll tell you about it by the end of the week, and I see the headline, good old Kurt Nemo, Military Police at Kentucky Derby.
[00:41:38.858 --> 00:41:44.982]  You know, it was Kurt Nemo broke into national news that AFP had one photo, and he found it three days later.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:52.244]  After the mass shooting in Alabama, it was Kurt that noticed it.
[00:41:52.244 --> 00:41:55.466]  They'll always show it in the photos, but no news articles.
[00:41:55.466 --> 00:42:01.870]  Regular Army MPs running checkpoints in Alabama hours after the shooting was over.
[00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:11.016]  He does a story, a week later it's in AP, Reuters, Houston Chronicle, it comes out it's a felony, illegal, why were they there, why was NORTHCOM there?
[00:42:11.016 --> 00:42:12.277]  We have the Colonel on the show.
[00:42:14.375 --> 00:42:15.636]  Again, I'm not bragging.
[00:42:15.636 --> 00:42:17.417]  It actually freaks me out.
[00:42:17.417 --> 00:42:26.204]  I've got, like, four writers and myself, and we're breaking more news than, you know, that's important than really anybody else.
[00:42:26.204 --> 00:42:28.085]  And I am scared to hire more writers.
[00:42:28.085 --> 00:42:31.128]  I'm scared to bring more people in here because of infiltrators.
[00:42:31.128 --> 00:42:32.769]  Believe me, it hasn't been pretty in the past.
[00:42:34.421 --> 00:42:37.724]  And I live a cloak and dagger life, folks.
[00:42:37.724 --> 00:42:41.168]  I have to worry about a Fed coming in here and doing something illegal.
[00:42:41.168 --> 00:42:49.055]  Just like Tommy Chong went in their business, mailed out a bong to somebody where it was illegal just to get them busted, a pipe.
[00:42:49.055 --> 00:42:57.063]  I mean, we have to think about this and deal with this and I think I can't cover it all, I can't do it all.
[00:42:57.063 --> 00:42:58.164]  But the issue here is,
[00:43:00.532 --> 00:43:18.167]  Military police at Kentucky Derby, and you look at this photo, military police detain a fan who ran onto the track following the running of the 135th Kentucky Derby horse race at Churchill Downs, Saturday, May 2nd, 2009, Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:43:18.167 --> 00:43:25.793]  And it's all the big billionaires, and the Queen of England has even come before the Kentucky Derby, and all these elites, and all the rich Arabs, and what do they see?
[00:43:25.793 --> 00:43:26.694]  All over the world!
[00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:32.553]  They estimate that a billion people watch the Kentucky Derby.
[00:43:32.553 --> 00:43:33.674]  Same thing with the Super Bowl.
[00:43:33.674 --> 00:43:38.958]  Two billion people watching.
[00:43:38.958 --> 00:43:39.779]  What do they see?
[00:43:39.779 --> 00:43:40.459]  Troops.
[00:43:40.459 --> 00:43:43.181]  Regular Army.
[00:43:43.181 --> 00:43:47.584]  Same thing now at drunk driving checkpoints in Tennessee.
[00:43:47.584 --> 00:43:50.887]  Tennessee governor says stop doing illegal army checkpoints.
[00:43:50.887 --> 00:43:52.088]  They say, you know what?
[00:43:52.088 --> 00:43:53.269]  We're going to go ahead and do it with
[00:43:54.417 --> 00:43:57.938]  With not just the Army, with the Air Force MPs.
[00:43:57.938 --> 00:44:05.841]  And we're going to shut down, and the next week after that happened, the local newspapers, we have links in this article.
[00:44:05.841 --> 00:44:11.542]  That's what's powerful about Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com articles, is they give you the full picture each time.
[00:44:11.542 --> 00:44:13.323]  They go back through years of this crap.
[00:44:14.636 --> 00:44:18.778]  And here I am going, you know, years ago, they're going to have troops on the streets, they're going to condition you first.
[00:44:18.778 --> 00:44:23.060]  You know, they don't just show up with tens of millions of troops, day one, have them running around.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:27.042]  First they have foreign troops in drills with police and military to get you ready.
[00:44:27.042 --> 00:44:30.224]  Then they have them land and do gun confiscation drills in Florida.
[00:44:30.224 --> 00:44:34.006]  Then they have cooperative nugget drills for gun confiscations in Louisiana and Mississippi.
[00:44:35.162 --> 00:44:45.105]  We have all the footage of that, and they do it over and over, and then all the Mexican troops are here to help in Katrina with, you know, with soup kitchens, and all the regular armies out confiscating guns.
[00:44:45.105 --> 00:44:46.145]  All the guns will be taken.
[00:44:46.145 --> 00:44:47.345]  No one will be allowed to be armed.
[00:44:47.345 --> 00:44:50.946]  That's a quote from the mayor and the police chief.
[00:44:50.946 --> 00:44:52.727]  And they have the troops on ABC News.
[00:44:52.727 --> 00:44:56.848]  Yeah, I don't like confiscating guns and then shooting Americans, but we gotta do it.
[00:44:56.848 --> 00:44:58.368]  That's a quote.
[00:44:58.368 --> 00:44:59.609]  Then you shoot an American.
[00:44:59.609 --> 00:45:00.869]  Yeah, that's right, I shoot an American.
[00:45:04.045 --> 00:45:06.206]  I mean, you see how it's this slow boil?
[00:45:06.206 --> 00:45:07.046]  And oh, the flu!
[00:45:07.046 --> 00:45:08.307]  Remember how many years have I told you?
[00:45:08.307 --> 00:45:12.068]  They'll have lots of fake flu scares before the big one.
[00:45:12.068 --> 00:45:17.870]  And that way you'll sit there and sit tight when that stuff comes through your town and kills you deader than a hammer.
[00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:22.972]  They're not going to be able to take the guns, folks, without an overlying bioweapon attack on top of it.
[00:45:22.972 --> 00:45:26.753]  That is guaranteed going to be their move.
[00:45:26.753 --> 00:45:29.074]  Guaranteed!
[00:45:29.074 --> 00:45:30.014]  I know these people.
[00:45:30.014 --> 00:45:31.995]  This is all I do is study them.
[00:45:35.455 --> 00:45:36.396]  You can bank on it.
[00:45:36.396 --> 00:45:38.257]  You can set your watch and warrant by it.
[00:45:38.257 --> 00:45:39.278]  I know what they're going to do.
[00:45:39.278 --> 00:45:42.541]  I don't just know intellectually.
[00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:47.325]  I can study how they operate and what they're gearing up for and what their attack pattern is, what their architecture is.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:58.308]  A Google News search does not produce a story or even a brief mention of the fact that military police were on hand at the Kentucky Derby to keep restless plebes in line.
[00:45:58.308 --> 00:46:08.477]  However, an Associated Press photograph posted on the Yahoo News website shows two MPs in combat fatigues with sidearms restraining a man at the Derby.
[00:46:09.258 --> 00:46:18.541]  Military police detained a man who ran on the track following the running of the 135th Kentucky Derby Horse Race in Churchill Downs, Saturday, May 2, 2009, in Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:20.582]  The photo caption reads.
[00:46:20.582 --> 00:46:27.724]  The photo was also included in a slideshow on Yahoo's sports website, although the text of the article does not contain a mention of the military police at the event.
[00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:38.654]  The military has no business policing the citizens except during extraordinary exceptional times of national emergency by an executive order.
[00:46:38.654 --> 00:46:40.735]  This is very disturbing, completely un-American.
[00:46:40.735 --> 00:46:47.880]  Maybe even more disturbing is that no one seems to care how quietly and easily we have accepted the burgeoning police state.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:56.822]  That was a comment on Yahoo Sports.
[00:46:56.822 --> 00:46:57.323]  Good job.
[00:46:57.323 --> 00:46:59.024]  Yeah, you know what's going on.
[00:46:59.024 --> 00:47:05.690]  InfoWars has reported on numerous instances of military involvement with local law enforcement in violation of posse comitatus in March.
[00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:06.710]  We reported on U.S.
[00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:11.835]  Army troops dispatched to patrol the streets of Sampson, Alabama after a murder spree.
[00:47:12.867 --> 00:47:19.473]  On April 6th we reported DHS State, Federal State, and Air Force local law enforcement checkpoint in Tennessee.
[00:47:19.473 --> 00:47:30.302]  On April 3rd, InfoWars Instrumental and the cancellation of a seatbelt checkpoint, which was conducted in conjunction with the Department of Homeland Security and the 251st Military Police in Bolivar, Tennessee.
[00:47:30.302 --> 00:47:31.623]  But they still did it all over the state.
[00:47:31.623 --> 00:47:32.163]  We have a link.
[00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:36.731]  The mainstream news articles where they just did it.
[00:47:36.731 --> 00:47:38.252]  Local newspapers show them that.
[00:47:38.252 --> 00:47:40.012]  They just said, you know what, Governor?
[00:47:40.012 --> 00:47:42.333]  We're doing this under PDD 51.
[00:47:42.333 --> 00:47:45.854]  Sit down and shut up!
[00:47:45.854 --> 00:47:48.374]  Which is exactly what the John Ward Defense Authorization Act.
[00:47:48.374 --> 00:47:53.656]  I mean, our governors mean nothing now in this country.
[00:47:53.656 --> 00:47:55.376]  Our federal government is under total U.N.
[00:47:55.376 --> 00:47:57.357]  control, publicly under treaty.
[00:47:59.105 --> 00:48:00.106]  Oh, come on Alex!
[00:48:00.106 --> 00:48:01.187]  Stop fear mongering!
[00:48:01.187 --> 00:48:03.048]  There's no martial law coming!
[00:48:03.048 --> 00:48:04.910]  Yeah, they're just using the Patriot Act against U.S.
[00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:06.931]  citizens in non-terror related cases.
[00:48:06.931 --> 00:48:09.793]  Marijuana cases.
[00:48:09.793 --> 00:48:16.519]  They're just, uh... The NSA openly is reading all the text messages and emails and listening to the phone calls.
[00:48:16.519 --> 00:48:23.264]  In England and Canada and France, every week I see them busting people for joking text messages.
[00:48:25.933 --> 00:48:32.415]  People joke on a text message of their buddy, you know, when they're in an airport, going, Hey man, don't bomb the airport!
[00:48:32.415 --> 00:48:38.357]  And before they get on their flight, the NSA's already dialed in on their position and had the police come after them.
[00:48:38.357 --> 00:48:39.538]  That's in the news right now.
[00:48:42.281 --> 00:48:43.542]  They're reading everything!
[00:48:43.542 --> 00:48:45.483]  They're watching everything!
[00:48:45.483 --> 00:49:05.194]  I mean, the colleges now, the majority, you know, of the law enforcement graduates and people, I've heard them bragging, you know, on talk interviews and articles about how, you know, I'm now on Homeland Security stuff with insurance companies, you know, database mining, when you get a car, rent a car, get a bank account, cash a check, buy food, buy beer, it's all being tracked.
[00:49:05.194 --> 00:49:08.296]  That's why they try to make you scan an ID even when you pay for beer with cash.
[00:49:10.478 --> 00:49:11.979]  It's total control!
[00:49:11.979 --> 00:49:13.080]  Total police state!
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.001]  Oh, come on, Alex!
[00:49:14.001 --> 00:49:16.183]  I remember ten years ago, the NSA!
[00:49:16.183 --> 00:49:17.604]  There's no such thing as echelon!
[00:49:17.604 --> 00:49:20.707]  Quit fear-mongering!
[00:49:20.707 --> 00:49:21.388]  Oh, come on!
[00:49:21.388 --> 00:49:22.349]  It's not that bad!
[00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:27.834]  Because they incrementally do it, and I'm here upset about it, and the public's like, oh, come on.
[00:49:27.834 --> 00:49:29.715]  Come on, that's no big deal.
[00:49:29.715 --> 00:49:33.278]  Oh, the troops is having some fun at the Derby with their 45 sidearms.
[00:49:36.465 --> 00:49:46.017]  Running up, grabbing, tackling people with guns and arresting them because the citizens, you know, jumped out onto the field.
[00:49:46.017 --> 00:49:47.138]  I didn't even say anything to my wife.
[00:49:47.138 --> 00:49:52.064]  I see the troops running along and I just go, you know what, I'm going to let her have an hour here without hearing about this.
[00:49:52.064 --> 00:49:55.789]  That's just, you know... Hell in a handbasket!
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:58.602]  Oh Alex, you're just pointing out a few things.
[00:49:58.602 --> 00:50:02.025]  You know, really, I can't go eat dinner without seeing troops running around.
[00:50:02.025 --> 00:50:03.066]  I'm sick of it!
[00:50:03.066 --> 00:50:06.929]  I'm in New York, I've had troops come up and say, turn my camera off, don't videotape me.
[00:50:06.929 --> 00:50:09.251]  Run up screaming and cussing at me.
[00:50:09.251 --> 00:50:15.337]  You know, you videotape troops running around with sidearms on.
[00:50:15.337 --> 00:50:16.398]  Sidearms on.
[00:50:18.086 --> 00:50:22.008]  Talking 18, 19 years old, and they go, what are you doing, MF-er?
[00:50:22.008 --> 00:50:23.749]  And they run up and start screaming at you.
[00:50:23.749 --> 00:50:25.810]  Because you're an American slave!
[00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:27.931]  You're scum!
[00:50:27.931 --> 00:50:33.674]  That's an endgame.
[00:50:33.674 --> 00:50:38.717]  Now as long as he hates Americans and hates the Second Amendment, that trooper's okay in the New Orleans book.
[00:50:38.717 --> 00:50:44.160]  But that guy supports the Constitution Bill of Rights, he's now the number one terrorist.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.661]  According to the DHS report.
[00:50:47.824 --> 00:50:48.404]  So let me get back.
[00:50:48.404 --> 00:50:51.445]  I'm going to play the San Antonio news piece in this segment and the next.
[00:50:51.445 --> 00:50:57.788]  Then I'm going to have a guest on, briefly, whose son's a terrorist under the Patriot Act, according to the media.
[00:50:57.788 --> 00:50:58.208]  Stay with us.
[00:50:58.208 --> 00:51:00.849]  I'm going to get to all your phone calls, get into the flu, and a lot more.
[00:51:00.849 --> 00:51:04.251]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[00:51:04.251 --> 00:51:08.693]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:51:08.693 --> 00:51:11.214]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[00:51:11.214 --> 00:51:16.096]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[00:51:17.456 --> 00:51:25.041]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[00:51:25.041 --> 00:51:27.302]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.

[00:52:01.168 --> 00:52:06.413]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:52:06.989 --> 00:52:14.553]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:52:14.553 --> 00:52:21.156]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:52:21.156 --> 00:52:23.117]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:52:23.117 --> 00:52:25.638]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:52:25.638 --> 00:52:36.564]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:52:37.193 --> 00:52:38.854]  It's not about left or right.
[00:52:38.854 --> 00:52:40.715]  It's about a one world government.
[00:52:40.715 --> 00:52:47.640]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:52:55.906 --> 00:52:57.487]  The Obama Deception.
[00:52:57.487 --> 00:52:58.668]  The people strike back.
[00:53:00.629 --> 00:53:11.200]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value, what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make it to your dinner table?
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.622]  Garden in a can!

[00:54:13.802 --> 00:54:34.921]  Alright, this is from two years ago, myself on CBS News, San Antonio, and they show a clip from a film that was from five years ago, 2004, where I'm talking about the surveillance blimps.
[00:54:35.933 --> 00:54:37.374]  But you're now all over the news.
[00:54:37.374 --> 00:54:39.395]  That's one reason they're GPSing your front door.
[00:54:39.395 --> 00:54:40.695]  By the way, that's coming up.
[00:54:40.695 --> 00:54:49.960]  You want the straight and skinny scoop on why the Census Bureau is going to your door before they visit you and getting your GPS reading.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:52.481]  I'm going to break that down at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:54:52.481 --> 00:54:54.142]  This is a serious issue.
[00:54:54.142 --> 00:54:55.063]  I'm going to go over that.
[00:54:56.169 --> 00:54:57.370]  Let me write a note so I don't forget.
[00:54:57.370 --> 00:54:59.050]  I did all this research this weekend.
[00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:05.974]  I've already done most of it, but I wanted to re-up my research and went over it all, so that's coming up as well.
[00:55:05.974 --> 00:55:09.616]  Right now, let's go ahead and play this clip and this segment into the next.
[00:55:09.616 --> 00:55:12.717]  We'll just come right back in with the next hour with this straight ahead.
[00:55:12.717 --> 00:55:14.078]  I'm on CBS TV.
[00:55:14.078 --> 00:55:15.679]  Now, how much of this has come true now?
[00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:17.039]  Of course, it didn't come true.
[00:55:17.039 --> 00:55:19.681]  I was reading government documents, but to the public.
[00:55:19.681 --> 00:55:21.542]  How much of this has now been proven correct?
[00:55:21.542 --> 00:55:21.882]  Here it is.
[00:55:24.628 --> 00:55:26.570]  ...and gives the government a black and white image.
[00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:31.293]  We live in a post 9-11 world security high over in a country of war.
[00:55:31.293 --> 00:55:32.514]  I wanted to hear the blimp part.
[00:55:32.514 --> 00:55:34.776]  I want to start that video from the start.
[00:55:34.776 --> 00:55:35.376]  Okay?
[00:55:35.376 --> 00:55:36.017]  Here it is, folks.
[00:55:37.952 --> 00:55:48.222]  In the future, every major city will have a high-altitude blimp tethered to a cable with ground-penetrating radar that looks right through your walls and gives the government a black-and-white image.
[00:55:48.222 --> 00:55:49.744]  We live in a post-911 world.
[00:55:49.744 --> 00:55:50.705]  Security higher.
[00:55:50.705 --> 00:55:52.406]  We're a country at war.
[00:55:52.406 --> 00:55:57.812]  Not an ideal situation for anyone, but there are some that say if we have another terrorist attack on American soil, the U.S.
[00:55:57.812 --> 00:55:59.373]  will be under martial law.
[00:56:00.234 --> 00:56:07.941]  On the phone we have with us the man you just saw in the video, that is Alex Jones, a man who has set forth to expose these supposed indiscretions by the government.
[00:56:07.941 --> 00:56:10.703]  We also have with us terrorism law expert Jeff Atticott with us.
[00:56:10.703 --> 00:56:12.564]  Thank you both for joining me this morning.
[00:56:12.564 --> 00:56:13.625]  Thanks for having me.
[00:56:13.625 --> 00:56:14.146]  I appreciate it.
[00:56:14.146 --> 00:56:16.207]  Let's first talk with you, Alex, by phone.
[00:56:16.207 --> 00:56:21.172]  Alex, you feel America is going to be under some martial law pressure as soon as we get attacked again, is that correct?
[00:56:21.932 --> 00:56:22.573]  We're good to go.
[00:56:45.735 --> 00:57:02.623]  The details of PDD 51 signed May 9th of this year that literally makes the President a dictator and last year the President funded the John Warner Defense Authorization Act for domestic oppression of the American people.
[00:57:02.623 --> 00:57:06.065]  It actually says that it is for domestic insurrection
[00:57:06.665 --> 00:57:07.826]  I don't think so.
[00:57:07.826 --> 00:57:09.648]  He's a lawyer for the people that were there in 99.
[00:57:32.364 --> 00:57:35.809]  Um, presidential directives are nothing new.
[00:57:35.809 --> 00:57:43.939]  I mean, the Clinton administration had a continuity PDD itself, and this president has simply replaced that one with this one.
[00:57:43.939 --> 00:57:47.604]  It's interesting because a lot of the annexes to the document are classified,
[00:57:47.944 --> 00:57:52.466]  I don't know how this gentleman has had access to those where he can tell us about what it says.
[00:57:52.466 --> 00:58:04.352]  But basically, if you read section 9, paragraph 9, it indicates that the executive branch has a responsibility for continuity, and the judicial branch has a responsibility, and also the legislative branch.
[00:58:04.352 --> 00:58:06.013]  So it's really not the boogeyman.
[00:58:06.013 --> 00:58:08.454]  This is nothing new, nothing to get upset about.
[00:58:08.454 --> 00:58:11.716]  It's actually the responsibility of the government to do this.
[00:58:12.176 --> 00:58:19.082]  Well, Mr. Judge, you were just alluding to the cameras, and I think we heard a little bit at the top of the show about you talking about the blimps overhead.
[00:58:19.082 --> 00:58:20.903]  Do you really think we're going to get to that point?
[00:58:20.903 --> 00:58:22.745]  I have not seen any blimps in my neighborhood.
[00:58:22.745 --> 00:58:24.506]  I don't really fear my police force.
[00:58:24.506 --> 00:58:25.767]  Sure, let me break this down.
[00:58:25.767 --> 00:58:34.454]  That is a Pentagon announcement of 2004, and they do now have them over D.C., L.A., and other areas.
[00:58:34.454 --> 00:58:37.617]  And yes, they are mounting high-altitude blimps.
[00:58:37.617 --> 00:58:40.960]  These are so high, you can't even see them without a telescope.
[00:58:42.301 --> 00:58:45.562]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.562 --> 00:58:50.763]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.763 --> 00:58:51.383]  Hello, friends.
[00:58:51.383 --> 00:58:52.443]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:58:52.443 --> 00:58:57.184]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[00:58:57.184 --> 00:59:00.144]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[00:59:00.144 --> 00:59:03.185]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[00:59:03.185 --> 00:59:09.046]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[00:59:09.266 --> 00:59:12.509]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[00:59:12.509 --> 00:59:19.494]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[00:59:19.494 --> 00:59:22.777]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[00:59:39.947 --> 00:59:41.928]  The first step is getting storable food.
[00:59:53.590 --> 00:59:55.992]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.992 --> 01:00:05.317]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.317 --> 01:00:06.618]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.618 --> 01:00:08.399]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.399 --> 01:00:10.141]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.141 --> 01:00:11.722]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.722 --> 01:00:13.283]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.283 --> 01:00:17.465]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.465 --> 01:00:21.548]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.587 --> 01:00:27.188]  It's really not the boogeyman.
[01:00:27.188 --> 01:00:28.589]  This is nothing new.
[01:00:28.589 --> 01:00:29.630]  Nothing to get upset about.
[01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:33.372]  It's actually the responsibility of the government to do this.
[01:00:33.372 --> 01:00:40.277]  Mr. Judge, you were just alluding to the cameras and I think we heard a little bit at the top of the show about you talking about the blimps overhead.
[01:00:40.277 --> 01:00:42.098]  Do you really think we're going to get to that point?
[01:00:42.098 --> 01:00:44.180]  I have not seen any blimps in my neighborhood.
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.821]  I don't really fear my police force.
[01:00:55.627 --> 01:00:58.788]  And yes, they are mounting high-altitude blimps.
[01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:06.031]  These are so high, you can't even see them without a telescope, or at night you can see them because of the atmosphere and the sun going over the edge.
[01:01:06.031 --> 01:01:07.411]  But I already have Google.
[01:01:07.411 --> 01:01:10.712]  I can actually Google my own home, you know, and check out my home.
[01:01:10.712 --> 01:01:11.692]  Listen, listen.
[01:01:11.692 --> 01:01:13.293]  You know, Mr. Anaconda's not stupid.
[01:01:13.293 --> 01:01:14.373]  I looked into him.
[01:01:14.373 --> 01:01:15.034]  Okay?
[01:01:15.034 --> 01:01:16.214]  And he knows what he's doing.
[01:01:16.790 --> 01:01:25.773]  Uh, we have the memos written by John Yoo and the Attorney General, Alberto Gonzalez, saying they can torture children with pliers.
[01:01:25.773 --> 01:01:28.474]  That the President is- it says that with pliers.
[01:01:28.474 --> 01:01:38.637]  It says the President is above the law, and that all law flows from him, and in PDD 51, he is saying he is in command of continuity of government.
[01:01:39.548 --> 01:01:41.569]  Yes, I mean, obviously he is in command.
[01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:43.290]  That's what the executive does.
[01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:46.771]  All the administrative agencies are under the executive branch.
[01:01:46.771 --> 01:01:54.514]  I mean, all administrative agencies are under the executive branch, so why would that be surprising that he is issuing policy memos to agencies within his control?
[01:01:54.514 --> 01:01:55.675]  We would expect him to do that.
[01:01:58.871 --> 01:01:59.731]  That's not what it says.
[01:01:59.731 --> 01:02:02.712]  But he's a president on his way out as well.
[01:02:02.712 --> 01:02:04.933]  There's going to be a change in presidency here come November.
[01:02:04.933 --> 01:02:05.393]  I have a better idea.
[01:02:05.393 --> 01:02:08.774]  You could go to Google and pull up PDD 51 and read it for yourself.
[01:02:08.774 --> 01:02:13.356]  And read paragraph 9 which talks about the responsibility of each branch of government and not executive takeover.
[01:02:27.441 --> 01:02:38.730]  Those are the four members of the Homeland Security Committee in Congress who have been able to see part of it and then want to see the classified areas because they're saying that it looks like it's a martial law plan.
[01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:46.116]  That's members of Congress and you're counting on folks not going and seeing what the AP and the Oregonians and others have to say about it.
[01:02:46.116 --> 01:02:52.021]  Mr. Jones, does the mentality or what Mr. Jones is pushing here, does it incite maybe us?
[01:02:52.021 --> 01:02:55.804]  Is it a fear-mongering thing or does he have some validity to his points?
[01:02:56.264 --> 01:03:00.326]  Well, obviously, in time of conflict, and we're definitely in a conflict with Al-Qaeda.
[01:03:00.326 --> 01:03:03.448]  I mean, they want to kill tens of thousands of Americans if they can.
[01:03:03.448 --> 01:03:04.028]  That's a fact.
[01:03:04.028 --> 01:03:07.029]  And our government has a responsibility to protect its citizens.
[01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:10.951]  But I think Mr. Jones is correct in that that has to be balanced against civil liberties.
[01:03:10.951 --> 01:03:13.253]  And where you draw that line is something that we need debated.
[01:03:13.253 --> 01:03:17.034]  I think voices like his are important, but we need to put them in context.
[01:03:17.034 --> 01:03:20.076]  I mean, you need to look at the facts, take a deep breath,
[01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:20.937]  You know what?
[01:03:20.937 --> 01:03:21.457]  I can prove my facts.
[01:03:21.457 --> 01:03:23.920]  We have members of Congress who are concerned about this.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.001]  We have Republican and Democratic
[01:03:40.376 --> 01:03:45.737]  Liberal and conservative top lawyers across the country saying this country's going into martial law.
[01:03:45.737 --> 01:03:51.538]  Bob Woodward, last year, was in San Antonio and said he thinks we're going into a dictatorship.
[01:03:51.538 --> 01:03:53.559]  That was in the front of the newspaper.
[01:03:53.559 --> 01:03:55.819]  I'm not the only one that's worried about this.
[01:03:55.819 --> 01:04:01.240]  By the way, the borders are still wide open, but the American people are being harassed and controlled.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:03.521]  We have the federal documents.
[01:04:03.521 --> 01:04:08.302]  And by the way, Anaconda, if you want to come debate me for an hour, I'll be on the radio on KLBJ today for two hours.
[01:04:09.515 --> 01:04:17.623]  We are talking with Alex Jones from Infowars.com about the changes here in America, and he believes we're changing into a police state, and also joining me is Dr. Jeff Attica.
[01:04:17.623 --> 01:04:20.906]  He is our expert on terrorism law, and we thank you both for joining us.
[01:04:20.906 --> 01:04:22.407]  We're kind of continuing our conversation.
[01:04:22.407 --> 01:04:24.129]  Alex, you've got some films out there.
[01:04:24.129 --> 01:04:29.794]  You go to protests, and you complain we're gearing up for this police state, because you say cops are swarming the streets with guns.
[01:04:29.794 --> 01:04:33.878]  These are huge protests, like the one we just saw you in New York during the Republican National Convention.
[01:04:34.779 --> 01:04:45.128]  Of course there's some increased police presence in New York after it being attacked, but do you honestly think that we're getting to a place in time where nobody's going to have any freedom to do what they actually want to do?
[01:04:45.128 --> 01:04:49.572]  Yes, people are being arrested coast to coast for peacefully protesting or demonstrating.
[01:04:49.572 --> 01:04:53.635]  New York has banned independent news cameras on the streets.
[01:04:53.635 --> 01:05:00.021]  Some of my cameramen have now been arrested and told that they're terrorists for having video cameras.
[01:05:01.263 --> 01:05:04.785]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:05:04.785 --> 01:05:10.188]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:05:10.188 --> 01:05:15.151]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:05:15.151 --> 01:05:26.117]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[01:05:26.397 --> 01:05:32.140]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or 1 year whichever comes first.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:38.383]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:05:38.383 --> 01:05:39.244]  What about you?
[01:05:39.244 --> 01:05:41.165]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.

[01:05:49.791 --> 01:05:51.732]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[01:06:04.844 --> 01:06:07.487]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:06:07.487 --> 01:06:15.057]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:06:15.057 --> 01:06:21.225]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:23.607]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:06:23.607 --> 01:06:26.109]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:06:26.109 --> 01:06:37.699]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:06:37.699 --> 01:06:39.381]  It's not about left or right.
[01:06:39.381 --> 01:06:41.242]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:06:41.242 --> 01:06:47.448]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:06:56.376 --> 01:06:57.956]  The Obama Deception.
[01:06:57.956 --> 01:06:59.137]  The people strike back!
[01:07:01.132 --> 01:07:02.592]  So you want to stop smoking.
[01:07:02.592 --> 01:07:03.873]  Well, here's what I want you to do.
[01:07:03.873 --> 01:07:06.753]  Go to a drugstore and take a stop smoking product off the shelf.
[01:07:06.753 --> 01:07:10.735]  Go to the cashier, tell him you don't want to pay for the product, you just want to take it home and try it.
[01:07:10.735 --> 01:07:14.516]  And if, and only if, you stop smoking, will you then come back and pay for it.
[01:07:14.516 --> 01:07:16.516]  Most likely, if you try this, you'd be arrested.
[01:07:16.516 --> 01:07:20.837]  But as silly as this sounds, this is exactly what the Smokefree free trial offer is.
[01:07:20.837 --> 01:07:23.738]  Smokefree is a complete, all-natural stop smoking system.

[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:50.000]  This is a limited time offer, so call 1-800-426-6186 now.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.182]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:54.182 --> 01:07:55.942]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:13.186 --> 01:08:27.449]  For those just joining us, I was, at the end of the last hour and the start of this one, I was playing part of a 10-minute clip of when I was on CBS TV debating a former JAG officer who's now a law professor.
[01:08:29.226 --> 01:08:29.806]  Down there at St.
[01:08:29.806 --> 01:08:35.191]  Mary's University, telling us how wonderful the martial law situation is in this country.
[01:08:35.191 --> 01:08:46.520]  Now, since then, I've interviewed Atticott two or three times, and he's actually come around on air and said, I guess you're right, we are going into a police state, they are gearing up for martial law, and it's not good.
[01:08:48.168 --> 01:08:51.190]  First time I interviewed him, he kind of said, yeah, I looked into what you said.
[01:08:51.190 --> 01:08:52.630]  I guess part of it's true.
[01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:53.971]  This is a problem.
[01:08:53.971 --> 01:08:57.873]  And the last time I interviewed him, he was basically like Alex Jones.
[01:08:57.873 --> 01:08:59.494]  So that's the amazing thing about this.
[01:08:59.494 --> 01:09:00.774]  And I only played about half the clip.
[01:09:00.774 --> 01:09:02.555]  The rest of it is online.
[01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:06.297]  You can just Google Alex Jones discusses martial law on CBS.
[01:09:06.297 --> 01:09:17.283]  But no, PDD 51 is different than other continuing government plans because it says Congress takes a back seat and that the executive runs everything.
[01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:23.869]  When in truth, they always teach us that we have co-equal branches of government.
[01:09:23.869 --> 01:09:29.933]  Until the last 140-something years, the Civil War decided it.
[01:09:29.933 --> 01:09:36.377]  Congress, the legislature, was above the executive, and then below that was the courts.
[01:09:36.377 --> 01:09:37.878]  They were not co-equal.
[01:09:37.878 --> 01:09:40.219]  Because you had a greater separation of powers.
[01:09:40.219 --> 01:09:46.203]  I've had constitutional law scholars on scores of them that agree with us, because they've read the Federalist Papers and the history, and the precedents.
[01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:50.327]  Because you have the greatest separation of powers in the legislature.
[01:09:50.327 --> 01:09:55.610]  You got a bunch of House members, a bunch of Senate members, they come from the states.
[01:09:55.610 --> 01:10:04.414]  That's why until 1913, with the 17th Amendment, Senators were appointed by legislators of the state that were elected.
[01:10:04.414 --> 01:10:12.178]  So you vote for the legislature, but to make sure the Senators were creatures of the state, of the locals, they were sent to Washington.
[01:10:12.178 --> 01:10:14.720]  And then the House members were elected at large.
[01:10:16.786 --> 01:10:18.429]  But I digress into all of this.
[01:10:18.429 --> 01:10:27.586]  The point is, we've studied it, we know what's going on, and then now you hear them, oh, under executive order, with a flu outbreak, we can forcibly inoculate you, or arrest you, or lock down U.S.
[01:10:27.586 --> 01:10:29.450]  cities, but we're going to keep the borders wide open.
[01:10:32.372 --> 01:10:37.114]  So coming up, I'm going to break down the latest flu info, and I haven't gotten into the key areas of that yet.
[01:10:37.114 --> 01:10:38.635]  Big quarantines going on in the U.S.
[01:10:38.635 --> 01:10:39.776]  and around the world.
[01:10:39.776 --> 01:10:44.778]  They're saying a new, deadlier flu variant or mutation of this is going to come.
[01:10:44.778 --> 01:10:46.759]  Fear-mongering that.
[01:10:46.759 --> 01:10:51.821]  We'll break down what's really happening, and most importantly, I'm going to get into the census takers.
[01:10:51.821 --> 01:10:58.024]  Supposed to start next year, but we have the inside scanning detailed on what's happening, so we'll break that down.
[01:10:58.024 --> 01:10:59.145]  Coming up in the next segment,
[01:11:00.236 --> 01:11:11.610]  But I remember a few months ago, I kept seeing newscast called a, you know, a new deadly type of pranking tonight at, you know, five.
[01:11:11.610 --> 01:11:16.776]  And we played some of these news clips where people are hacking IP phones.
[01:11:18.154 --> 01:11:30.202]  Computer phones, internet phones, iPhones, Skype phones, and they hack your phone number, they then get your IP address, and they do the same thing, same two or three things.
[01:11:30.202 --> 01:11:35.866]  They call the local police and say, uh, hi, Austin 911, how may I help you?
[01:11:35.866 --> 01:11:45.472]  Yes, my husband, he just killed my children, and he's in the room, he says he's coming here, he's gonna knock on the door and kill me, he says he's gonna kill the police, please come fast!
[01:11:45.472 --> 01:11:47.574]  SWAT teams show up 15 minutes later,
[01:11:48.574 --> 01:11:51.576]  They go bust down the door, and the family's asleep.
[01:11:51.576 --> 01:11:53.958]  The husband grabs for a gun, not knowing what's happening.
[01:11:53.958 --> 01:11:55.219]  Cops gunning down.
[01:11:55.219 --> 01:11:55.819]  Can't blame them.
[01:11:55.819 --> 01:11:58.441]  Can't blame the man.
[01:11:58.441 --> 01:12:01.383]  Or, I mean, it keeps happening.
[01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:03.685]  And it's called sky-packing.
[01:12:03.685 --> 01:12:06.346]  And I've actually had something like this happen to me once.
[01:12:06.346 --> 01:12:08.648]  I had people program their fax machines.
[01:12:08.648 --> 01:12:09.709]  I know I'm giving you an idea.
[01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:10.469]  Go ahead.
[01:12:10.469 --> 01:12:10.969]  You're going to do it.
[01:12:10.969 --> 01:12:11.550]  It's criminal.
[01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:13.771]  It doesn't hurt us.
[01:12:13.771 --> 01:12:17.434]  And then they send threatening faxes around to police departments, news agencies.
[01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:25.146]  And then, you know, the cops are calling or showing up or, you know, are you sending these faxes?
[01:12:25.146 --> 01:12:27.387]  Well, he was at church with her, reportedly.
[01:12:27.387 --> 01:12:27.967]  It doesn't matter.
[01:12:27.967 --> 01:12:28.848]  The police came.
[01:12:28.848 --> 01:12:35.092]  They charged him with terrorism.
[01:12:35.092 --> 01:12:44.399]  And, uh, it's just amazing.
[01:12:44.399 --> 01:12:47.561]  You know, we've got, uh, Annetta Lundeby on the line with us.
[01:12:49.734 --> 01:12:54.497]  And so when I heard this, and I read this in the news, she didn't know about skypacking.
[01:12:54.497 --> 01:12:59.559]  Because when I saw the news articles, it didn't mention that.
[01:12:59.559 --> 01:13:01.640]  She just said this was some kind of prank.
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:03.441]  He was in charge with us.
[01:13:03.441 --> 01:13:04.282]  And I went, wait a minute!
[01:13:06.178 --> 01:13:10.740]  And then we talked to her and she's like, yeah, he's got an internet phone, he's got a Skype phone.
[01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:13.021]  And now she's heard it might have been a hack.
[01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:19.905]  And it's a homeschooler, you never hear about homeschoolers doing anything wrong, they have the highest test scores, geography Bs, spelling Bs, all of it.
[01:13:19.905 --> 01:13:20.725]  And I believe her.
[01:13:20.725 --> 01:13:23.787]  But there's another facet to this.
[01:13:23.787 --> 01:13:26.008]  There's another facet.
[01:13:26.008 --> 01:13:29.550]  And we're going to Mrs. Lundeby.
[01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:34.752]  And that is that they've charged him under the Patriot Act and haven't let him see lawyers or let him have any process.
[01:13:34.752 --> 01:13:35.673]  In fact, here's the article.
[01:13:37.987 --> 01:13:48.312]  Sixteen-year-old Ashton Lundeby's bedroom in his mother's Granville County home is nothing if not patriotic.
[01:13:48.312 --> 01:13:51.113]  Images of American flags are everywhere on the bed, on the floor, on the wall.
[01:13:51.113 --> 01:13:59.317]  According to the United States government, the 10th grade homeschooler is being held on criminal complaint that he made a bomb threat from his home on the night of February 15th.
[01:13:59.317 --> 01:14:01.038]  The family was at church function that night.
[01:14:01.038 --> 01:14:01.938]  His mother, Anita,
[01:14:04.844 --> 01:14:16.687]  Lundeby said, undoubtedly they were given false information or they would not have had 12 agents in my house with a widow and two children and three cats, Lundeby said.
[01:14:16.687 --> 01:14:17.388]  Around 10 p.m.
[01:14:17.388 --> 01:14:23.069]  on March 5th, Lundeby said the FBI agents, along with three local law enforcement officers, stormed her home looking for her son.
[01:14:23.069 --> 01:14:26.650]  They handcuffed him and presented her with a search warrant.
[01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:28.631]  I was terrified, Lundeby's mother said.
[01:14:30.558 --> 01:14:34.181]  There were guns, and I don't allow guns around my children.
[01:14:34.181 --> 01:14:36.242]  I don't believe in guns.
[01:14:36.242 --> 01:14:42.807]  Lundeby told the officers that someone had hacked into her son's IP address and was using it to make cranked calls connected to the internet.
[01:14:42.807 --> 01:14:44.409]  And it goes on and on from there.
[01:14:44.409 --> 01:14:50.113]  And then the whole point is they've now said, Lundeby said the USA Patriot Act stripped her son of his due process rights.
[01:14:50.113 --> 01:14:53.296]  No lawyer, they're allowed to spy on the lawyer if she gets one.
[01:14:53.296 --> 01:14:54.657]  Not allowed to get assistance.
[01:14:56.537 --> 01:14:59.739]  He now sits in a juvenile facility in South Bend, Indiana.
[01:14:59.739 --> 01:15:02.740]  His mother has had little access to him since his arrest.
[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:10.304]  She has gone to her state representatives, as well as attorneys seeking assistance, but she said there is nothing she can do to help.
[01:15:10.304 --> 01:15:16.167]  We have no rights under the Patriot Act to even defend him, because the Patriot Act basically supersedes the Constitution, she said.
[01:15:16.167 --> 01:15:20.209]  It wasn't intended to drag her 16-year-old, 120-pound son
[01:15:24.761 --> 01:15:29.524]  Out of the middle of the night, and charged that he can't even defend.
[01:15:29.524 --> 01:15:31.666]  And it goes on to say they are using the USA Patriot Act.
[01:15:31.666 --> 01:15:35.429]  Now, in this case, they can even halfway claim it's terrorism, but it obviously isn't.
[01:15:35.429 --> 01:15:41.153]  But with marijuana, you can Google, Patriot Act used in Tennessee in thousands of non-terror-related cases.
[01:15:41.153 --> 01:15:47.117]  Huffer belly toys visited for selling a toy that may have been patented, uh, you know, and threatened with terrorist arrest.
[01:15:47.117 --> 01:15:49.078]  You know, that was the, uh, Oregonian.
[01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:49.759]  We had the lady on.
[01:15:49.759 --> 01:15:53.322]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up and go to, uh, Mrs., uh,
[01:15:56.034 --> 01:15:57.475]  Thank you for coming on.
[01:15:57.475 --> 01:15:58.475]  Is your son out yet?
[01:15:58.475 --> 01:16:00.216]  I know this article is from last week.
[01:16:00.216 --> 01:16:01.577]  No sir, he's not.
[01:16:01.577 --> 01:16:06.100]  He's still being held in South Bend, Indiana.
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:11.403]  He's had one detention hearing and what they call a status hearing.
[01:16:11.403 --> 01:16:13.404]  He has not been charged as an adult.
[01:16:13.404 --> 01:16:16.947]  They're going to charge him on May 22nd as an adult.
[01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:23.671]  But in order to do that, they have to prove that this was a crime of violence, which
[01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:36.083]  In order to meet those criteria, he has to have been previously adjudicated as a delinquent, which he has not ever been.
[01:16:36.083 --> 01:16:38.425]  He's never been arrested.
[01:16:38.425 --> 01:16:41.629]  He said that he read from the complaint.
[01:16:42.395 --> 01:16:52.498]  That the school where he's being charged for the bomb threat was at Purdue University where he doesn't even know where that was at the time.
[01:16:52.498 --> 01:17:00.300]  Have you brought up to them that it's a big issue with these Skype and IP hackers doing this constantly?
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:08.643]  Well, we brought it up at the detention hearing and the FBI agent blatantly, there's no other word to use, but lied.
[01:17:09.441 --> 01:17:18.764]  to the Federal Magistrate, Judge Gates, and told him that you could not hack an IP address, that it was like a fingerprint.
[01:17:18.764 --> 01:17:19.764]  What is he talking about?
[01:17:19.764 --> 01:17:21.324]  This is all over the news!
[01:17:21.324 --> 01:17:22.004]  I know.
[01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:23.585]  They wanted my son.
[01:17:23.585 --> 01:17:27.906]  They wanted my son, and they wanted to set an example out of him.
[01:17:27.906 --> 01:17:31.307]  Well, I mean, what do they think happens in a denial-of-service attack?
[01:17:31.307 --> 01:17:37.028]  They go grab thousands of people's computers, hack their IP address, and they're not the ones hacking.
[01:17:37.028 --> 01:17:38.949]  Look, who was the name of this agent?
[01:17:40.203 --> 01:17:43.706]  Um, I really don't know because he would not give me his name.
[01:17:43.706 --> 01:17:47.829]  Oh, so you're at trials now and you don't even know the witnesses against your names?
[01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:51.672]  I don't, I'm not allowed to have any information concerning my son.
[01:17:51.672 --> 01:17:53.993]  So, well, it's obviously because you're a homeschooler.
[01:17:53.993 --> 01:17:57.836]  Look, that jackass at the FBI, excuse me ma'am, I apologize, that FBI agent.
[01:17:57.836 --> 01:17:58.837]  No, I agree with you.
[01:17:58.837 --> 01:18:01.419]  He, he knows it's a lie.
[01:18:01.419 --> 01:18:02.560]  Oh, they do.
[01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:08.204]  They hit him with numerous bomb threats and the judge down here, my understanding, wanted to let him go.
[01:18:09.187 --> 01:18:13.976]  And the probation officer because he had never had any kind of previous anything.
[01:18:13.976 --> 01:18:15.859]  He doesn't smoke, drink, do drugs.
[01:18:17.296 --> 01:18:18.217]  That's who they love.
[01:18:18.217 --> 01:18:20.678]  They hate him.
[01:18:20.678 --> 01:18:24.981]  He's kind of a poster boy of all-American good kid.
[01:18:24.981 --> 01:18:26.082]  Well, they hate that, ma'am.
[01:18:26.082 --> 01:18:28.583]  I'm sure you've seen the Department of Homeland Security report.
[01:18:28.583 --> 01:18:31.525]  Those reports list homeschoolers as potential terrorists.
[01:18:31.525 --> 01:18:35.467]  I have previous reports where they say homeschooling is some type of thought crime.
[01:18:35.467 --> 01:18:37.568]  Now, let me expand on that.
[01:18:37.568 --> 01:18:39.950]  Have you seen the federal drills they do in Michigan and places?
[01:18:40.330 --> 01:18:48.213]  Where they come in and take over schools with guns drawn, shang their homeschoolers, and it's really the police that are terrorizing and demonizing homeschoolers?
[01:18:48.213 --> 01:18:49.133]  I'm not kidding.
[01:18:49.133 --> 01:18:51.334]  You can't make this up, ma'am.
[01:18:51.334 --> 01:18:52.135]  I believe it.
[01:18:52.135 --> 01:18:55.776]  I believe anything now.
[01:18:55.776 --> 01:18:59.197]  Now, I'm not saying your son's innocent, though I believe in my gut he is.
[01:18:59.197 --> 01:19:00.058]  I can't prove that.
[01:19:00.058 --> 01:19:03.639]  What I can prove is he's not getting due process afforded to U.S.
[01:19:03.639 --> 01:19:04.299]  citizens.
[01:19:04.299 --> 01:19:06.060]  They promised the Patriot Act wasn't for U.S.
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:07.341]  citizens, but Section 802 says
[01:19:08.681 --> 01:19:13.363]  Any action that endangers human life is a violation of any federal or state laws and act of terror.
[01:19:13.363 --> 01:19:16.423]  And so that's why misdemeanor people are now being charged with it.
[01:19:16.423 --> 01:19:19.925]  But to expand on this, if they want to charge him with a felony, that's one thing.
[01:19:19.925 --> 01:19:22.705]  But they have a right to face their accuser.
[01:19:22.705 --> 01:19:24.386]  So we're going to go to break.
[01:19:24.386 --> 01:19:29.868]  I'm going to come back and hear more about the case and what you're facing, ma'am, and how folks can hopefully try to support you.
[01:19:30.828 --> 01:19:31.889]  But there's no due process.
[01:19:31.889 --> 01:19:34.610]  I guess he may go to a Supermax and that's the end of it.
[01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:40.814]  But you've somehow got to get the transcript to that court, but I guess it's Patriot Act so you can't, and point out that they're lying.
[01:19:40.814 --> 01:19:52.060]  What I know the lie is, is if this FBI agent said you can't hack an IP address, and that you can't take over Skype telephones and make bomb threats, I mean all you got to do is Google it.
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:54.342]  It's ABC, CBS, NBC.
[01:19:54.342 --> 01:19:57.023]  It's a huge issue out there with 911 systems alone.
[01:20:01.121 --> 01:20:03.802]  Are you concerned for the safety of your loved ones?
[01:20:03.802 --> 01:20:07.424]  Listen closely to this message from Pepperspray.com.
[01:20:07.424 --> 01:20:10.565]  Every 22 seconds a violent crime is committed.
[01:20:10.565 --> 01:20:14.987]  America has changed and your personal safety is your first priority.
[01:20:14.987 --> 01:20:15.807]  Be smart.
[01:20:15.807 --> 01:20:16.767]  Be safe.
[01:20:16.767 --> 01:20:19.368]  Trust Pepperspray instead of your luck.
[01:20:19.368 --> 01:20:25.611]  Pepperspray.com is the only website you'll ever need for all of your non-lethal self-defense supplies.

[01:20:38.662 --> 01:20:45.388]  Pepperspray.com also carries a large assortment of products for personal, home, child, and pet safety.

[01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:47.570]  I'm good.
[01:21:01.414 --> 01:21:05.477]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:21:05.477 --> 01:21:11.361]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:21:11.361 --> 01:21:12.482]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:21:12.482 --> 01:21:17.185]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:21:17.185 --> 01:21:30.434]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:21:30.974 --> 01:21:36.576]  For this reason Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:21:36.576 --> 01:21:43.239]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:21:43.239 --> 01:21:44.719]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:44.719 --> 01:21:49.701]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:21:49.701 --> 01:21:50.322]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.322 --> 01:21:52.222]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:21:52.222 --> 01:21:52.282]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:06.699]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:07.478 --> 01:22:13.360]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:19.841]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:22:19.841 --> 01:22:21.822]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:22:21.822 --> 01:22:24.282]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:22:24.282 --> 01:22:35.185]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:22:37.486 --> 01:22:39.148]  It's not about left or right.
[01:22:39.148 --> 01:22:41.009]  It's about a one world government.
[01:22:41.009 --> 01:22:47.916]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[01:22:47.916 --> 01:22:56.183]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:56.183 --> 01:22:57.765]  The Obama Deception.
[01:22:57.765 --> 01:22:58.946]  The people strike back.
[01:23:00.743 --> 01:23:01.624]  Attention, gardeners!
[01:23:01.624 --> 01:23:04.227]  This is an urgent GCN Self-Reliance Update.
[01:23:04.227 --> 01:23:08.773]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[01:23:08.773 --> 01:23:16.983]  It's called Proto-Grow, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:23:16.983 --> 01:23:19.806]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:27.728]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:23:27.728 --> 01:23:33.534]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:23:33.534 --> 01:23:39.380]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:42.624]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:23:42.904 --> 01:23:46.506]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:23:46.506 --> 01:23:51.568]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:23:51.568 --> 01:23:54.489]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:23:54.489 --> 01:23:54.730]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:24:22.755 --> 01:24:25.098]  Alright, Annette Lunderby, going back to you, ma'am.
[01:24:25.098 --> 01:24:25.899]  I know I'm ranting.
[01:24:27.523 --> 01:24:37.171]  I was just talking to my IT people and we found all these different newscasts and clips where they talk about people hacking Skype, hacking voice over IP.
[01:24:37.171 --> 01:24:38.392]  It happens constantly.
[01:24:38.392 --> 01:24:40.374]  It's a serious problem.
[01:24:40.374 --> 01:24:41.835]  And the FBI is saying no.
[01:24:41.835 --> 01:24:42.796]  They're not even looking at that.
[01:24:42.796 --> 01:24:44.957]  They told the judge it doesn't exist.
[01:24:44.957 --> 01:24:46.559]  There's no way this happened.
[01:24:46.559 --> 01:24:47.680]  Tell us what happened.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:50.542]  Tell us how he's not getting due process.
[01:24:50.542 --> 01:24:53.444]  One thing, under Galt versus US, he's not
[01:24:56.144 --> 01:24:56.625]  I don't
[01:25:10.515 --> 01:25:14.879]  Doesn't mean he needs to be held for 60 days without due process.
[01:25:14.879 --> 01:25:17.401]  Well, that goes back to eugenics, the family courts.
[01:25:17.401 --> 01:25:29.891]  They thought it was so important to sterilize people 80 years ago in this country, under the eugenics laws that Hitler learned from us, that the family courts are still there, so they also use that Patriot Act type code against families.
[01:25:29.891 --> 01:25:32.733]  They can do stuff against families they can't do to axe murderers.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:48.626]  I knew, blatantly knew, that my son had not done all these bomb threats.
[01:25:48.626 --> 01:26:02.954]  There were several people that did it, and my attorney had told me that his public defender had told him, and us, that the other people that were involved had already been charged.
[01:26:02.954 --> 01:26:04.435]  And that's not true.
[01:26:04.435 --> 01:26:07.957]  The people that actually did it are still on the internet.
[01:26:09.218 --> 01:26:09.678]  I don't know.
[01:26:21.912 --> 01:26:24.234]  That's pretty much what it looks like.
[01:26:55.534 --> 01:27:08.001]  Well, because my son is intelligent and he has an IQ of 140, that he firmly believes that his intelligence is going to be used against him instead of helping him.
[01:27:08.001 --> 01:27:12.343]  Because they're going to say, well, he was intelligent enough to do this or do this.
[01:27:12.343 --> 01:27:16.046]  But you can't make a call when you're not there.
[01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:21.887]  Well, one of the violations was that they wouldn't allow me to make a phone call that night to make a choice of attorney.
[01:27:39.992 --> 01:27:45.614]  Which is under the Fifth Amendment right, that you have a choice attorney that's already set precedence with U.S.
[01:27:45.614 --> 01:27:45.974]  Supreme Court.
[01:27:45.974 --> 01:27:47.834]  So they're telling you who your lawyer is?
[01:27:47.834 --> 01:27:49.655]  Okay.
[01:27:49.655 --> 01:27:57.217]  They did not allow me to make a call to my attorney that night, and I had to be at attention at 10 the next morning, which is an hour from here.
[01:27:57.217 --> 01:28:03.799]  The court appointed an attorney that he spoke to my son for less than 30 seconds.
[01:28:03.799 --> 01:28:09.661]  And I didn't want to get him, but I couldn't find an attorney at that little time.
[01:28:10.978 --> 01:28:12.940]  To defend my son.
[01:28:12.940 --> 01:28:14.501]  We weren't given that opportunity.
[01:28:14.501 --> 01:28:18.724]  And they say they are charging him under the Patriot Act, so where is this going?
[01:28:18.724 --> 01:28:21.326]  They're not saying that, but that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:28:21.326 --> 01:28:26.530]  I mean, because all those actions point towards that, but they don't deny it either.
[01:28:26.530 --> 01:28:31.414]  Okay, so they're basically, that's just the end of it then.
[01:28:31.414 --> 01:28:33.815]  So where does this go?
[01:28:33.815 --> 01:28:35.777]  I'm not really sure.
[01:28:35.777 --> 01:28:39.660]  I'm hoping that the listeners will bombard the
[01:28:40.848 --> 01:28:41.769]  The Assistant U.S.
[01:28:41.769 --> 01:28:46.294]  Attorney in South Bend, Indiana, with calls concerning this.
[01:28:46.294 --> 01:28:47.676]  Because I need to know the truth.
[01:28:47.676 --> 01:28:53.482]  I mean, I need, the truth needs to be out there that people are concerned about their constitutional rights.
[01:28:53.482 --> 01:28:57.587]  And with the Patriot Act, you have, in my understanding, you don't have any rights.
[01:28:59.692 --> 01:29:27.621]  I think the Feds want to burn your son because they want to set the precedent that even if it is clear... Because they used 30 agents and I was told that heads had to roll because they used so many agents on this case that they've got basically egg on their face to pull in a 16 year old that they didn't find any bomb materials, they didn't find anything and my son was asleep going to Raleigh when they were taking him and they were like, gosh,
[01:29:28.510 --> 01:29:33.112]  This is, um... We didn't find any bomb materials.
[01:29:33.112 --> 01:29:34.253]  Maybe we should... Well, they don't care.
[01:29:34.253 --> 01:29:36.974]  I mean, you know, the government brings in the narcotics, ma'am.
[01:29:36.974 --> 01:29:39.075]  Uh, so where is, uh... Well, stay there.
[01:29:39.075 --> 01:29:41.356]  We'll do it a few more minutes on the other side.
[01:29:41.356 --> 01:29:43.196]  By the way, have you ever heard of this radio show before?
[01:29:43.196 --> 01:29:46.838]  Uh, I've heard of it on the internet, yes.
[01:29:46.838 --> 01:29:52.661]  I have not heard your show, but I've heard... I wonder if your son... son had... We're on the march.
[01:29:52.661 --> 01:29:55.202]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.202 --> 01:29:57.883]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.583 --> 01:30:03.704]  Spring is here.
[01:30:03.704 --> 01:30:04.664]  Growing season.
[01:30:04.664 --> 01:30:06.866]  The economy is not getting any better.
[01:30:06.866 --> 01:30:08.587]  In fact, it's getting worse.
[01:30:08.587 --> 01:30:09.568]  Think about it.
[01:30:09.568 --> 01:30:13.650]  At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[01:30:13.650 --> 01:30:17.333]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[01:30:17.333 --> 01:30:20.174]  You need to get your seeds before it's too late.
[01:30:20.174 --> 01:30:32.042]  At OrganicaSeed.com, you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.
[01:30:32.262 --> 01:30:32.722]  I think so.
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:07.269]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:31:07.269 --> 01:31:14.240]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:31:14.835 --> 01:31:21.416]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:31:21.416 --> 01:31:23.397]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:31:23.397 --> 01:31:25.897]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:37.459]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:31:37.459 --> 01:31:39.140]  It's not about left or right.
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:40.500]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:31:40.999 --> 01:31:47.903]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:31:56.167 --> 01:31:57.748]  The Obama Deception.
[01:31:57.748 --> 01:32:01.050]  The people strike back.
[01:32:01.050 --> 01:32:03.651]  Companies continue to lay off thousands of people.
[01:32:04.272 --> 01:32:07.613]  Unemployment is the highest it's been in over 30 years.
[01:32:07.613 --> 01:32:11.373]  Statistics prove that in a recession, crime rates go up.
[01:32:11.373 --> 01:32:17.955]  Everyone needs something for that extra edge to prevent becoming a victim in these difficult and trying times.
[01:32:17.955 --> 01:32:23.176]  You need to prepare yourself with DPS pepper spray, available at MrDefense.com.
[01:32:23.176 --> 01:32:29.877]  DPS is the strongest pepper spray in the market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies from around the world.

[01:32:48.109 --> 01:32:48.949]  We've got a reporter down in
[01:33:11.778 --> 01:33:14.000]  Mexico City's been down there for three or four days.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.622]  He'll be popping in near the end of the show today.
[01:33:16.622 --> 01:33:30.854]  We've got Dr. Jerome Corsi coming on to break down the international nature, how under UN treaties they are in control of the global response to this flu, including here in the United States, setting the precedent for world government.
[01:33:30.854 --> 01:33:33.476]  That is coming up with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:33:33.476 --> 01:33:36.699]  In the next hour, we'll also get his perspective on Barack Obama.
[01:33:38.191 --> 01:33:42.756]  I want to break down the situation we are facing.
[01:33:42.756 --> 01:33:51.566]  We're a year out from the official census kicking off, but there are census takers everywhere with GPS's getting your doorstep address.
[01:33:52.537 --> 01:33:54.058]  This is freaking a lot of people out.
[01:33:54.058 --> 01:33:55.499]  I've done the research.
[01:33:55.499 --> 01:33:56.800]  I've got the background on this.
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:59.202]  Coming up in a few minutes, I'm going to break it down in detail.
[01:33:59.202 --> 01:34:02.285]  Then when Corsi leaves us in the last hour, we'll open the phones up and go over all that.
[01:34:02.285 --> 01:34:07.289]  We'll also have open phones on any issue you wish to discuss next hour with Dr. Corsi at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:07.289 --> 01:34:07.369]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:07.369 --> 01:34:07.769]  Annette Lundeby.
[01:34:07.769 --> 01:34:08.370]  Okay, Annette, look.
[01:34:19.261 --> 01:34:43.914]  You know, you need to get that transcript, because if indeed, you need to go to the media with that, because media attention will make them drop this, it's probably the only thing that will, because if you really got the FBI agent testifying, there's no such thing as IP hacking, when they're trying to pass laws in Congress over this, when it is just a huge, huge, huge deal,
[01:34:44.819 --> 01:34:49.881]  And everybody knows about it, and every major police department's getting these things sometimes every week.
[01:34:49.881 --> 01:35:02.205]  Because people will Skype call 9-1-1, or they will IP call 9-1-1 over an internet phone, and they will do it to the very house that they've hacked.
[01:35:02.205 --> 01:35:05.146]  I mean, this is so sick.
[01:35:05.146 --> 01:35:06.127]  This is so savage.
[01:35:06.127 --> 01:35:08.307]  This is why, because I knew about this years ago.
[01:35:08.307 --> 01:35:09.748]  I don't have an IP phone in my house.
[01:35:10.765 --> 01:35:15.069]  And IP phones are great, they're inexpensive, they work decent.
[01:35:15.069 --> 01:35:19.092]  But these bastards do this constantly.
[01:35:19.092 --> 01:35:21.234]  Constantly.
[01:35:21.234 --> 01:35:26.378]  And, you know, not only are you going to get SWAT team, you're going to go to prison.
[01:35:26.378 --> 01:35:30.402]  Imagine the cops going, no, it doesn't exist.
[01:35:30.402 --> 01:35:38.289]  Well, in the cases where the prank call is, everyone's been murdered, I'm here, I killed them, I'm covered in blood, I'm going to kill you when you come.
[01:35:40.513 --> 01:35:45.480]  And then the police show up, you know, at the house, and obviously nobody's dead.
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:46.981]  They know that's a prank.
[01:35:46.981 --> 01:35:48.904]  But if you got a kid in the house, it's over, folks.
[01:35:48.904 --> 01:35:49.945]  They're going to prison.
[01:35:49.945 --> 01:35:52.028]  Because they like an easy catch.
[01:35:52.028 --> 01:35:58.136]  They need fresh meat for these giant private prisons owned by the private defense contractor companies that bring in the narcotics.
[01:35:59.346 --> 01:36:00.668]  I mean, you know, these are drug dealers.
[01:36:00.668 --> 01:36:07.877]  The government deals the drugs, the big corporations launder the money, and if you don't think they'll throw you in a prison to make money off of it, you got another thing coming.
[01:36:07.877 --> 01:36:12.222]  They'll kill a million, three hundred thousand Iraqis, but they care about your life?
[01:36:12.222 --> 01:36:18.230]  No, they don't care about your life any more than they care about some Iraqi kid they're killing or some dog they're throwing off a cliff in Iraq.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:21.821]  It's time to grow up and admit that!
[01:36:21.821 --> 01:36:24.323]  Alright, finishing up with Annette Lundeby.
[01:36:24.323 --> 01:36:25.964]  Alright, we need to pray for your son, obviously.
[01:36:25.964 --> 01:36:41.352]  Tell us where you are, where he's located, your phone number, you know, some of the legal gumshoes out there that might want to volunteer to help you, but giving out your contact, you get a lot of great folks calling you, also a lot of kooks.
[01:36:41.352 --> 01:36:44.974]  But, you know, that's a danger, calling out for help, you go with.
[01:36:44.974 --> 01:36:48.196]  But if you want help, in what form do you want that, ma'am?
[01:36:48.638 --> 01:36:58.506]  Well, I actually need a federal pro bono prosecutor that's gonna actually work for my son instead of working for the government.
[01:36:58.506 --> 01:37:00.207]  You mean defense lawyer?
[01:37:00.207 --> 01:37:02.168]  A defense lawyer, yes.
[01:37:02.168 --> 01:37:17.520]  I also need for them to also, I've got phone numbers where they can bombard the Attorney General's office or the FBI's office and ask them to please release my son.
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:18.321]  They can call
[01:37:21.363 --> 01:37:22.284]  The U.S.
[01:37:22.284 --> 01:37:26.986]  Attorney's Office in South Bend, Indiana at 574-236-8287.
[01:37:26.986 --> 01:37:30.008]  And U.S.
[01:37:30.008 --> 01:37:46.677]  Assistant Attorney General Hayes is the one that's over my son's case, but I have not spoken with him.
[01:37:46.677 --> 01:37:48.338]  There's an agent at the FBI.
[01:37:51.685 --> 01:37:56.227]  Well, ma'am, the bigger issue here is these guys could care less about the American people.
[01:37:56.227 --> 01:37:58.728]  So, I mean, calling them, I guess, lets them know they're being watched.
[01:37:58.728 --> 01:38:04.691]  But their criminal activities being witnessed, if it is criminal, it may just be completely negligent.
[01:38:04.691 --> 01:38:06.232]  These guys, a lot of them are really stupid.
[01:38:06.232 --> 01:38:11.194]  You know, they do like one or two cases a month and kind of play golf all day and pick their nose and drink beer.
[01:38:11.194 --> 01:38:14.976]  And I'm sorry to talk like that, but that's what they're doing.
[01:38:14.976 --> 01:38:16.476]  Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
[01:38:17.717 --> 01:38:18.578]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:18.578 --> 01:38:33.431]  Ma'am, the key here is, if you have a transcript of that court proceeding where they say there's no such thing as IP hacking, that's very newsworthy and you need to get newspapers to cover that.
[01:38:33.431 --> 01:38:39.677]  I can't get them, they put that under a gag order where I couldn't get it.
[01:38:39.677 --> 01:38:40.978]  I'm not allowed to, um,
[01:38:42.085 --> 01:38:44.926]  Get any information concerning his case.
[01:38:44.926 --> 01:38:50.488]  Well, that's because they've got a court-appointed attorney that works for them, and they're just shutting you out, man, and railroading them.
[01:38:50.488 --> 01:38:51.808]  That's not true.
[01:38:51.808 --> 01:38:53.229]  That's absolutely right.
[01:38:53.229 --> 01:38:54.649]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:54.649 --> 01:38:58.650]  Now, you're a witness to this, so you just need to tell the news media about it.
[01:38:58.650 --> 01:39:09.974]  Well, it's in the... My attorney has agreed that that's exactly what was in the court proceedings, because I told them that they needed to get copy of the transcript, because this is what was said.
[01:39:10.492 --> 01:39:24.799]  That they held him based on a lie, on false information, and my son is taking criminology courses where he's at now, and he says that they can toss that out due to the fact that the FBI lied.
[01:39:24.799 --> 01:39:26.119]  Okay, well here's what I'm going to do.
[01:39:26.119 --> 01:39:27.040]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:29.561]  You want to give folks your email or contact?
[01:39:29.561 --> 01:39:30.341]  Yes.
[01:39:30.341 --> 01:39:33.203]  They took all my computers and everything.
[01:39:33.203 --> 01:39:39.486]  So, um, I can give you my home phone number.
[01:39:40.836 --> 01:39:41.797]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:39:41.797 --> 01:39:42.137]  Which is 919-693-5566.
[01:39:42.137 --> 01:39:44.678]  Alright, give that number out again.
[01:39:44.678 --> 01:39:44.718]  919-693-5566.
[01:39:56.457 --> 01:40:15.004]  Okay, ma'am, we will pray for your son, we'll watch this as it develops, and other talk show hosts I think should have you on, and people should contact the prosecutors and say, if it's true that you guys are saying, and you're not looking into the fact, that this could be an IP hack,
[01:40:16.075 --> 01:40:18.356]  You have engaged in a great crime.
[01:40:18.356 --> 01:40:26.380]  And you know, obviously, if there's a big string of prank calls going on and they finally go to this location, you're saying you have the YouTube videos?
[01:40:26.380 --> 01:40:30.342]  I would take those YouTube videos, show that to the media.
[01:40:30.342 --> 01:40:31.283]  I'd go to a Kinko's.
[01:40:31.283 --> 01:40:45.390]  If you don't have a computer as your evidence, I would print off the pages of YouTube that show the person's account, what they're saying, how they're laughing about it, and say, here are the perpetrators bragging about setting up my son
[01:40:46.921 --> 01:40:50.503]  And here they are, and then my son's being charged and tried.
[01:40:50.503 --> 01:40:52.184]  That's a great news story.
[01:40:52.184 --> 01:40:58.508]  The media will pick up on that, and the feds will be forced to let your son go, and then you're going to have one heck of a lawsuit.
[01:40:58.508 --> 01:40:59.228]  God bless you, ma'am.
[01:40:59.228 --> 01:41:02.210]  Good to hear from you.
[01:41:02.210 --> 01:41:03.351]  Oh, thank you.
[01:41:03.351 --> 01:41:05.172]  You know, I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:41:05.172 --> 01:41:09.534]  My gut tells me that her son is as pure as the driven snow, completely innocent.
[01:41:09.534 --> 01:41:10.395]  What's going on, Rob, dude?
[01:41:14.019 --> 01:41:17.880]  Well, come on over to the mic if you're going to, because I don't have dead air, but I'll just listen to you.
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:19.941]  If we do this live on air, you've got to talk into the mic.
[01:41:19.941 --> 01:41:21.102]  Alright, it won't make any sense.
[01:41:21.102 --> 01:41:25.904]  A guy just called in and said that basically the same thing happened about a year ago.
[01:41:25.904 --> 01:41:35.627]  There was this Mormon compound where they took 500 kids, and it was all started with a woman from Colorado making one phone call that launched the feds in.
[01:41:35.627 --> 01:41:40.889]  So basically, by one phone call, you know, they just come in and round you up and take you away.
[01:41:40.889 --> 01:41:42.610]  Well, wait, one phone call with a Skype?
[01:41:43.228 --> 01:41:47.411]  It wasn't with Skype, it was just a phone call to the Feds claiming, making a claim.
[01:41:47.411 --> 01:41:48.232]  I remember that, yeah.
[01:41:48.232 --> 01:41:49.953]  And they totally violated all due process.
[01:41:49.953 --> 01:41:50.373]  Right, right.
[01:41:50.373 --> 01:41:53.476]  So, I mean, I guess it's all it takes now, it's just a phone call.
[01:41:53.476 --> 01:41:55.577]  We've got to shorten that mic in there.
[01:41:55.577 --> 01:41:58.380]  Okay, hey, thanks for coming in, appreciate it.
[01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:05.945]  Okay, uh, got a lot of news here that I want to go over.
[01:42:05.945 --> 01:42:09.908]  Trying to find in my stack, here it is.
[01:42:09.908 --> 01:42:11.209]  Did some, uh, research.
[01:42:12.250 --> 01:42:23.139]  I'm going to get into the Census Bureau situation in a moment, but I wanted to hit on this first.
[01:42:23.139 --> 01:42:32.607]  Just to give you an example, remember about eight, nine years ago, I started telling you on air because I'd seen references to it in federal cases.
[01:42:32.607 --> 01:42:37.371]  It was never in a news article, but I saw references to it in federal cases.
[01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:47.442]  And that was that OnStar was being used to listen to people about warrants in their cars.
[01:42:47.442 --> 01:42:56.306]  All OnStar is, is a cell phone that has GPS triangulation in it, and that's why you hit the button and you're talking to the lady.
[01:42:56.306 --> 01:42:59.367]  Help me OnStar, you know, I'm locked out of my car.
[01:42:59.367 --> 01:43:02.709]  Or help me OnStar, I've crashed in a river.
[01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:06.770]  Or help me OnStar, you know, I've wet my diaper.
[01:43:06.770 --> 01:43:09.392]  Whatever the case may be.
[01:43:09.392 --> 01:43:09.932]  And it says,
[01:43:12.796 --> 01:43:21.102]  Here, man strip searched and held for 24 hours over friends joke text about sabotaging a train.
[01:43:21.102 --> 01:43:24.644]  And just two weeks ago or so I saw another article about a guy in the U.S.
[01:43:24.644 --> 01:43:36.132]  got a joke text message about, hey pal, don't blow up the plane and that ran through the NSA and within minutes they already grabbed him at the gate on the other side and arrested him.
[01:43:36.132 --> 01:43:40.155]  That's because all your text messages, all your emails, folks, under the
[01:43:41.769 --> 01:43:42.990]  Telecommunications Act of 96.
[01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:46.493]  It all goes through the NSA.
[01:43:46.493 --> 01:43:51.237]  The NSA has whole floors in every major IT or phone company telecom.
[01:43:51.237 --> 01:43:52.438]  That's on record.
[01:43:52.438 --> 01:44:02.105]  It didn't break last year or a year and a half ago on frontline with that whistleblower at AT&T in San Francisco.
[01:44:02.105 --> 01:44:03.807]  We've been covering it since 1996.
[01:44:03.807 --> 01:44:07.109]  It's nothing new.
[01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:08.370]  Oh, Alex, don't fear monger.
[01:44:08.370 --> 01:44:09.752]  The NSA isn't listening to us.
[01:44:09.752 --> 01:44:10.532]  And now they admit it.
[01:44:10.532 --> 01:44:11.213]  See, we're right again.
[01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:17.195]  They're just now introducing it to the slaves they're being listened to.
[01:44:17.195 --> 01:44:21.536]  Man strip searched and held 24 hours over friend's joke text about sabotaging a train.
[01:44:21.536 --> 01:44:23.396]  This is the mail online.
[01:44:23.396 --> 01:44:25.137]  This is out of Paris.
[01:44:25.137 --> 01:44:26.437]  Out of France.
[01:44:26.437 --> 01:44:32.638]  An innocent man was strip searched and held in a cell for 24 hours receiving a joke text message from a friend about sabotaging a train.
[01:44:32.638 --> 01:44:39.720]  The 29-year-old was arrested and his mobile phone provider passed on details of the message to police who accused him of not reporting a crime.
[01:44:43.527 --> 01:44:50.550]  The case, which happened in France, provoked widespread outrage among the sinister march of Big Brother State there.
[01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:58.993]  The man, referred to only as his first name, Stephen, received a message saying, Do you know how to derail a train?
[01:44:58.993 --> 01:45:04.676]  Last month, in Abbeville, in Soma region.
[01:45:04.676 --> 01:45:07.997]  The worker thought nothing of the text, but hours later he was arrested.
[01:45:10.046 --> 01:45:13.768]  Detective said the mobile provider had passed on the details of the text message.
[01:45:13.768 --> 01:45:15.690]  You have computers data mining that.
[01:45:15.690 --> 01:45:20.293]  They claim Steven had called the police as soon as he received the text.
[01:45:20.293 --> 01:45:35.543]  And we're also seeing this in the US, like 16, 17, 18 year olds will text, you know, a guy's girlfriend, the captain of the football team gets arrested because his 16 year old girlfriend text him a shot with her bra off.
[01:45:35.543 --> 01:45:39.686]  And, you know, think of how many of us in high school had girlfriends, folks,
[01:45:42.170 --> 01:45:44.253]  And think about how many of us were promiscuous.
[01:45:44.253 --> 01:45:47.276]  I mean, is it child porn?
[01:45:47.276 --> 01:45:51.721]  If you're 16 and your girlfriend's 16 and you have relations, according to the police it is.
[01:45:53.143 --> 01:46:04.931]  And they arrest people every week I see articles because the phone system looks at all of that and they admit they have AI software that recognizes skin.
[01:46:04.931 --> 01:46:15.138]  It recognizes the female body, the male body, it recognizes those patterns and it flags it and the perverts at the telecom sit there and pull it up and they hand it over to cops.
[01:46:17.534 --> 01:46:31.042]  So this is another high-tech version of, you know, you go to Walmart or Eckerd's or wherever, it's happened everywhere, and it's your 18-month-old baby sitting in the bubble bath in the tub, and it doesn't matter if it doesn't even show your daughter or son's private parts.
[01:46:31.042 --> 01:46:34.064]  If it shows the boy or girl's chest, that's child porn.
[01:46:34.064 --> 01:46:38.727]  You're arrested, your life's over, you're a sex offender.
[01:46:38.727 --> 01:46:44.410]  Meanwhile, Dyncor and Halliburton are all caught running giant child kidnapping rings, mainstream news, nothing happens to them.
[01:46:45.947 --> 01:46:49.610]  So the detective said his mobile provider had passed on details of the message.
[01:46:49.610 --> 01:46:56.676]  They claimed Stephanie should have called the police as soon as he received the text.
[01:46:56.676 --> 01:46:57.716]  So I keep calling him Stephanie.
[01:46:57.716 --> 01:46:58.497]  I can't read names.
[01:46:58.497 --> 01:47:06.824]  Stephan said, I was strip searched and forced to hand over the name of my colleague who had sent the message.
[01:47:06.824 --> 01:47:07.805]  Then the court gave
[01:47:08.934 --> 01:47:10.796]  An order that I could be held 24 hours.
[01:47:10.796 --> 01:47:11.876]  It was a real shock.
[01:47:11.876 --> 01:47:14.839]  In two seconds, I felt I'd become a vulgar criminal.
[01:47:14.839 --> 01:47:17.181]  I was held in a prison cell which smelled of urine.
[01:47:17.181 --> 01:47:18.902]  I felt I was being treated like a dog.
[01:47:18.902 --> 01:47:19.883]  Well, that's what this is.
[01:47:19.883 --> 01:47:24.607]  This is the takeover of normal society by the parasite government, making everybody a terror bro.
[01:47:24.607 --> 01:47:25.367]  You're a terrorist now.
[01:47:25.367 --> 01:47:26.608]  You own land, you're a terrorist.
[01:47:26.608 --> 01:47:27.589]  Got a gun, you're a terrorist.
[01:47:27.589 --> 01:47:28.730]  Love freedom, you're a terrorist.
[01:47:28.730 --> 01:47:29.731]  You're a veteran, you're a terrorist.
[01:47:29.731 --> 01:47:32.493]  This is the criminal Soviet Nazi takeover.
[01:47:34.161 --> 01:47:36.121]  He was released without charge for 24 hours.
[01:47:36.121 --> 01:47:37.702]  His friend was also over 24 hours.
[01:47:37.702 --> 01:47:42.543]  French law allows information, including text, to be handed over to authorities if there is concern about terrorism.
[01:47:42.543 --> 01:47:43.863]  But see, they're reading it.
[01:47:43.863 --> 01:47:48.264]  Security services here are not allowed to snoop on British citizens' text.
[01:47:48.264 --> 01:47:58.546]  But it is thought they sidestepped those restrictions by monitoring other countries' communications and then exchanged data with them.
[01:47:58.546 --> 01:47:58.986]  There you go.
[01:48:01.226 --> 01:48:02.047]  That's another lie.
[01:48:02.047 --> 01:48:04.768]  Security servers are not allowed to snoop on British citizens.
[01:48:04.768 --> 01:48:07.030]  Folks, they snoop on the entire Parliament.
[01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:08.271]  Everybody gets spied on.
[01:48:08.271 --> 01:48:09.412]  It's been in the BBC.
[01:48:09.412 --> 01:48:11.673]  They're tracking everybody's cell phone in Europe.
[01:48:11.673 --> 01:48:12.714]  Listening real-time.
[01:48:12.714 --> 01:48:13.554]  It's all under Interpol.
[01:48:13.554 --> 01:48:18.238]  It's all under the European Union, under treaty.
[01:48:18.238 --> 01:48:20.859]  The telecoms are all owned by the military-industrial complex.
[01:48:20.859 --> 01:48:22.400]  It's owned by the private banks.
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:26.023]  It's all one giant, stinking, criminal operation.
[01:48:27.481 --> 01:48:28.082]  Okay?
[01:48:28.082 --> 01:48:30.784]  They're listening and watching everything.
[01:48:30.784 --> 01:48:33.387]  They're criminal scum.
[01:48:33.387 --> 01:48:36.269]  The White House tried to claim it was legal to spy without warrants.
[01:48:36.269 --> 01:48:37.691]  First they lied and said they weren't doing it.
[01:48:37.691 --> 01:48:41.154]  Then it came out and they said, okay, we're allowed to.
[01:48:41.154 --> 01:48:44.758]  They have leaked it on purpose because they want to have a chilling effect.
[01:48:44.758 --> 01:48:45.378]  You know what?
[01:48:45.378 --> 01:48:48.701]  You listen to my phones, you dirtbags.
[01:48:48.701 --> 01:48:50.163]  You're criminals.
[01:48:50.163 --> 01:48:50.863]  And you know it.
[01:48:50.863 --> 01:48:51.904]  You work for narcotics.
[01:48:52.802 --> 01:49:00.044]  Trafficking, child trafficking, money laundering, international pot-bellied pedophile bankers.
[01:49:00.044 --> 01:49:02.544]  That's been proven.
[01:49:02.544 --> 01:49:08.505]  That's who runs things, a bunch of pot-bellied pedophiles.
[01:49:08.505 --> 01:49:16.387]  Literal buckets of demonic pus directly out of the scrofulous, worm-eaten, rancid maggot holes on the back of Satan.
[01:49:18.993 --> 01:49:19.894]  Oh, you think I'm joking?
[01:49:19.894 --> 01:49:29.461]  I can play congressional defense hearings where they admit that the defense contractors are running giant child kidnapping rings and Rumsfeld says they're allowed to.
[01:49:29.461 --> 01:49:30.501]  Oh, yeah.
[01:49:30.501 --> 01:49:30.962]  That's it.
[01:49:30.962 --> 01:49:33.664]  I'm playing it in the last hour and I have time.
[01:49:33.664 --> 01:49:43.250]  Google, uh, YouTube on YouTube, uh, Rumsfeld questioned about child kidnapping rings.
[01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:44.251]  YouTube it.
[01:49:44.251 --> 01:49:45.252]  We'll just play it for you.
[01:49:48.251 --> 01:49:52.076]  We'll just play it for you.
[01:49:52.076 --> 01:49:59.124]  I've walked up to the DynCorp headquarters, they got a new name here in Austin, and pointed it out to cops one time, and the cops just laughed, it was funny.
[01:49:59.124 --> 01:50:01.828]  They said, yeah, I know who they are, sometimes we work there.
[01:50:01.828 --> 01:50:05.172]  Like, like, cause you work there, it's now okay.
[01:50:05.172 --> 01:50:07.755]  By the way, I get death threats every time I talk about that, but I'll never shut up.
[01:50:17.418 --> 01:50:19.099]  Oh my goodness, it's just out of control.
[01:50:19.099 --> 01:50:20.640]  We're going to get Dr. Corsi on it right after.
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:27.363]  When I come back, I'm going to get into the... I'm going to get into the Census Bureau.
[01:50:27.363 --> 01:50:35.026]  Because I see comments on Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, people that don't know what they're talking about.
[01:50:35.026 --> 01:50:42.570]  Just like they weren't going to put troops on the streets, and just like they weren't going to have a police state, and just like they weren't going to have a new Bank of the World, everything I've talked about has come true.
[01:50:43.908 --> 01:50:45.090]  Or is coming true.
[01:50:45.090 --> 01:50:46.171]  And you know what?
[01:50:46.171 --> 01:50:47.733]  The denial needs to stop.
[01:50:47.733 --> 01:50:53.520]  You want to know the exact skinny on what's going on with the people coming to your door with GPS.
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:56.464]  We'll cover it when we come back for 10 minutes of airtime.
[01:50:56.464 --> 01:50:57.646]  Then we'll get Corsi on.
[01:50:57.646 --> 01:50:59.027]  I'm going to cover it more in the last hour.
[01:50:59.027 --> 01:50:59.368]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.610 --> 01:51:05.651]  Today, we cannot afford to ignore the current state of our country.
[01:51:05.651 --> 01:51:08.811]  The economy, job layoffs, mass foreclosures.
[01:51:08.811 --> 01:51:13.332]  And now, we are all at risk of being exposed to this new flu pandemic.
[01:51:13.332 --> 01:51:18.173]  The Center for Disease Control has declared a public health emergency across the United States.

[01:51:56.148 --> 01:52:08.158]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:08.158 --> 01:52:13.443]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:14.039 --> 01:52:20.540]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:22.501]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:22.501 --> 01:52:24.961]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.961 --> 01:52:38.164]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:52:38.164 --> 01:52:39.825]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.825 --> 01:52:41.185]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:41.681 --> 01:52:48.587]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:52:58.436 --> 01:52:59.617]  The people strike back.
[01:53:01.155 --> 01:53:03.336]  The world appears to be on the brink of collapse.
[01:53:03.336 --> 01:53:10.458]  Experts say a pinch of heirloom vegetable seed could soon be the most valuable resource on earth because it will provide healthy food now and every year after.
[01:53:10.458 --> 01:53:16.220]  Survivalistseeds.com now has the heirloom garden seed time capsule, allowing you to store your seeds for the future anyway.

[01:54:11.277 --> 01:54:18.046]  You know, the more I think about it, I can't do justice to this GPS thing at your doors, but I'll do it briefly now because I said I wouldn't in the last hour.
[01:54:18.046 --> 01:54:19.788]  I'm going to detail it.
[01:54:19.788 --> 01:54:22.852]  I've been talking to Dave that started the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[01:54:24.434 --> 01:54:29.918]  And we'd kind of gotten involved with a little bit some of the stuff that was posted lately.
[01:54:29.918 --> 01:54:40.905]  But they would do stuff like claim if I showed a news article that that was copyright, even to show a news article, say here's the Austin American Statesman, you know, they would file those complaints and things.
[01:54:40.905 --> 01:54:45.629]  In the case of the mass shooter up in Pennsylvania, you know, I showed the news article and they said, oh, you can't show that image.
[01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:48.091]  Just amazing.
[01:54:48.091 --> 01:54:50.471]  So they were looking for reasons to suspend that account.
[01:54:50.471 --> 01:54:52.492]  They used a year plus old thing.
[01:54:52.492 --> 01:54:57.534]  Because you're supposed to get three, you know, two strikes in a year.
[01:54:57.534 --> 01:54:59.594]  Well, he didn't have any strikes this year.
[01:54:59.594 --> 01:55:00.975]  So they were using old strikes.
[01:55:00.975 --> 01:55:02.976]  He was getting messages from YouTube.
[01:55:02.976 --> 01:55:08.317]  Dave was, we're going to suspend the Alex Jones Channel that had tens of tens of tens.
[01:55:08.317 --> 01:55:09.238]  We hadn't counted it up.
[01:55:09.238 --> 01:55:13.219]  I mean, it was millions and millions and millions and millions and millions.
[01:55:13.219 --> 01:55:15.300]  There were some videos in there that had a million views alone.
[01:55:16.545 --> 01:55:21.248]  And there were over, I think it was 2,000 plus videos he posted.
[01:55:21.248 --> 01:55:24.729]  Unbelievable amounts of work that he had done.
[01:55:24.729 --> 01:55:31.033]  And we would see comments on his page, the Alex Jones Channel, and I would get emails, you bastard, we're gonna shut your account down.
[01:55:31.033 --> 01:55:32.914]  Constant complaints, constant.
[01:55:32.914 --> 01:55:35.655]  So good job, whoever got it shut down, it doesn't matter.
[01:55:35.655 --> 01:55:40.037]  We're all over YouTube, there's hundreds of other channels that carry our stuff.
[01:55:40.037 --> 01:55:44.340]  And that's why we didn't just link to the Alex Jones Channel, we linked everybody else to build up their channels.
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:49.403]  He started about a month ago knowing this was coming, the Infowarrior channel for Burmas.
[01:55:49.403 --> 01:55:52.025]  Started trying to clone some of the stuff up there.
[01:55:52.025 --> 01:55:54.707]  He went to so much work to do that.
[01:55:54.707 --> 01:55:56.989]  And just know we're under attack, folks.
[01:55:56.989 --> 01:55:59.591]  I mean, you know, it says this account has been suspended.
[01:56:00.211 --> 01:56:14.179]  You know, people really should call YouTube and Google and the rest of them who act like they've got free speech, and this is all out in the open, because, you know, they just... And then they always post the amazing atheist and American Idol on their front page.
[01:56:14.179 --> 01:56:15.500]  They push what they want.
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:24.865]  They're already moving away from it being user content and kind of hiding everybody else's stuff on a sub-page, and then the crap they want to push on the main page is what they put out there.
[01:56:26.223 --> 01:56:33.809]  But, you know, we're on the aim and FM dial, shortwave, internet, satellite, Genesis, you know, we are diversified because we've been attacked so much.
[01:56:33.809 --> 01:56:40.834]  And so, shutting down one YouTube channel just lets everybody know we're the real deal.
[01:56:40.834 --> 01:56:50.101]  And, you know, there was 200,000 views of one of my swine flu videos, where I was in there.
[01:56:50.101 --> 01:56:53.724]  Aaron and Rob were up until two in the morning, so they're not into work yet.
[01:56:54.309 --> 01:56:56.171]  I need to get Aaron in here because he's got Dave's number.
[01:56:56.171 --> 01:56:59.914]  I want to get Dave on later to tell us exactly what happened.
[01:56:59.914 --> 01:57:02.397]  That started the channel about a year ago, a year and a half ago.
[01:57:02.397 --> 01:57:03.618]  I started linking to it.
[01:57:03.618 --> 01:57:11.866]  It had about 40,000 subscribers, tens of millions of videos that had been watched, and it's gone.
[01:57:11.866 --> 01:57:13.968]  But we can always tell folks to subscribe to another channel.
[01:57:13.968 --> 01:57:16.130]  People say, oh forget YouTube, Alex!
[01:57:16.130 --> 01:57:17.271]  Just leave YouTube!
[01:57:18.592 --> 01:57:20.974]  You know, go to the smaller channels.
[01:57:20.974 --> 01:57:23.137]  Our stuff is posted everywhere else.
[01:57:23.137 --> 01:57:26.800]  But we want to be on YouTube because it's the third largest site on the web.
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:32.867]  And because we can post one of our videos on a little site and get a thousand views in a month, we can post one on YouTube and get a million.
[01:57:32.867 --> 01:57:35.469]  We've been going mega viral on YouTube.
[01:57:35.469 --> 01:57:39.133]  Everything, you know, we put on there turns to solid gold and goes viral.
[01:57:39.133 --> 01:57:40.434]  We're reaching everybody.
[01:57:41.115 --> 01:57:53.386]  With this radio show, that's why we simulcast the last two hours every day at PrisonPlanet.tv so people can watch it in high quality live or archived at PrisonPlanet.tv and so they can't take everything down because we have our own video system.
[01:57:54.281 --> 01:57:57.583]  But so folks can also rip it from there and post it to the Four Winds.
[01:57:57.583 --> 01:58:02.326]  So understand, we are coming under attack, censorship, you name it, everywhere.
[01:58:02.326 --> 01:58:04.427]  I told you we got hacked last week.
[01:58:04.427 --> 01:58:06.288]  We had companies threatening to sue us.
[01:58:06.288 --> 01:58:07.709]  I don't want to get into that.
[01:58:07.709 --> 01:58:14.634]  You know, the point is, is that a lot of stuff has been going on around here and we try to not make that the focus.
[01:58:14.634 --> 01:58:23.059]  But 40,000 subscribers, tens of millions, tens of millions, tens and tens and tens of millions of views.
[01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:26.802]  And they're getting scared of us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:26.802 --> 01:58:28.483]  They're getting scared.
[01:58:28.483 --> 01:58:33.027]  They're getting scared in a big, fat way.
[01:58:33.027 --> 01:58:36.030]  And they should be, because the people are on the march.
[01:58:36.030 --> 01:58:46.118]  Dr. Jerome Corsi coming up, and then I will get into the... You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.118 --> 01:58:48.420]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.035 --> 01:58:52.735]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:52.735 --> 01:58:57.477]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[01:58:57.477 --> 01:59:00.438]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:59:00.438 --> 01:59:03.478]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:59:03.478 --> 01:59:09.320]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:12.804]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:59:12.804 --> 01:59:19.791]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[01:59:19.791 --> 01:59:23.075]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[01:59:23.075 --> 01:59:24.756]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.

[01:59:34.466 --> 01:59:38.090]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:59:38.090 --> 01:59:39.632]  Again, 1-800-409-5633 or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:59:39.632 --> 01:59:40.232]  Take action today.
[01:59:40.232 --> 01:59:42.054]  The first step is getting storable food.
[01:59:53.826 --> 01:59:56.227]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.227 --> 02:00:05.629]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:06.949]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.949 --> 02:00:08.710]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.710 --> 02:00:10.470]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.470 --> 02:00:12.051]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.051 --> 02:00:13.611]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.611 --> 02:00:17.792]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.792 --> 02:00:21.873]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.365 --> 02:00:25.546]  Yeah, I counted up.
[02:00:25.546 --> 02:00:28.768]  Just kind of scanning a rough scan.
[02:00:28.768 --> 02:00:31.469]  I think it was Friday.
[02:00:31.469 --> 02:00:33.990]  I spent like a couple minutes on the Alex Jones Channel.
[02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:39.313]  Checking out the comments, seeing the great videos he posted.
[02:00:39.313 --> 02:00:46.296]  And, um... I noticed there was over a million views just on one page of videos.
[02:00:46.296 --> 02:00:51.899]  Over a million views!
[02:00:51.899 --> 02:00:52.559]  And it's all gone.
[02:00:55.154 --> 02:00:57.196]  It's all gone.
[02:00:57.196 --> 02:01:01.979]  I mean, that sucker, in a year and a half, there was over 2,000 videos he'd posted.
[02:01:01.979 --> 02:01:05.822]  Absolutely gorgeous.
[02:01:05.822 --> 02:01:07.043]  And building, building.
[02:01:07.043 --> 02:01:12.407]  Instead of the average video, you know, getting about 10,000 views in a week, they were getting like 20,000.
[02:01:12.407 --> 02:01:15.009]  And he was posting like 10, 15 videos a day.
[02:01:15.009 --> 02:01:17.271]  Just bam, bam, bam, bam.
[02:01:17.271 --> 02:01:21.074]  I mean, that is a major shot, ladies and gentlemen, right to our gut.
[02:01:22.588 --> 02:01:32.553]  But it doesn't matter, because that which does not kill us only makes us stronger.
[02:01:32.553 --> 02:01:35.414]  So I ask enough respect to all the other great channels out there.
[02:01:35.414 --> 02:01:42.057]  I'm asking everybody, make a tribute video to the Alex Jones Channel and all the videos that were on it, because most of them got cloned and copied.
[02:01:42.057 --> 02:01:45.759]  And to the censorship, mix it in with all the videos I've done about web censorship.
[02:01:45.759 --> 02:01:48.661]  And let's just expose YouTube as the whores they are and Google.
[02:01:49.321 --> 02:01:51.602]  You know, totally NSA run.
[02:01:51.602 --> 02:01:56.105]  Mr. Steele, the CIA agent, has named names of the MIT scientists that set up Google.
[02:01:56.105 --> 02:01:57.846]  They're at the NASA campus.
[02:01:57.846 --> 02:01:59.787]  It's a total government operation.
[02:01:59.787 --> 02:02:05.250]  And they're busy phasing off the front page of the user videos to just their few pets they want to promote.
[02:02:05.250 --> 02:02:08.011]  But we were still kicking their butts, so they had to cheat!
[02:02:08.011 --> 02:02:11.213]  You know, they act like it's about what you, the users, want.
[02:02:11.213 --> 02:02:13.734]  But that's not what it's about.
[02:02:13.734 --> 02:02:16.076]  And they're relegating the users now to sub-pages
[02:02:17.711 --> 02:02:27.754]  And you know they're posting everything up on YouTube from all the old episodes of Gunsmoke to Star Trek and all the new TV shows and it's going to be a HuluTube.
[02:02:27.754 --> 02:02:29.995]  Instead of YouTube, it's Hulotube.
[02:02:29.995 --> 02:02:33.636]  Taking the U out of YouTube.
[02:02:33.636 --> 02:02:41.078]  And I know I said I'd cover the GPS stuff, but as soon as Corsi leaves us in about 55 minutes from now, I will go directly and cover that.
[02:02:41.078 --> 02:02:41.658]  It's just that
[02:02:44.178 --> 02:02:46.640]  Man, I tell you, I got the instincts, man.
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:50.683]  I knew when I was looking at that site this weekend, I said, bye-bye Alex Jones Channel.
[02:02:50.683 --> 02:02:51.803]  Because it's a good feeling.
[02:02:51.803 --> 02:02:56.427]  You're like, man, I'm reaching like a million people a week just over this little sucker.
[02:02:56.427 --> 02:03:04.432]  And there's literally hundreds and hundreds of YouTube channels that post my live TV show, the audio from the radio show.
[02:03:04.432 --> 02:03:06.074]  It's my radio show.
[02:03:10.253 --> 02:03:11.674]  They, uh, blew it away.
[02:03:11.674 --> 02:03:13.595]  Blew it completely out the door.
[02:03:13.595 --> 02:03:16.757]  Just, like, basically burned down a whole library with pleasure.
[02:03:16.757 --> 02:03:27.945]  Imagine them as vandals running around with gasoline and the Alexandria Library just pouring gasoline and everything, giggling and gibbering with pleasure.
[02:03:27.945 --> 02:03:32.668]  And then lighting it afire as they hop around like barbarians around it burning, like, ah ha ha!
[02:03:32.668 --> 02:03:33.008]  Yes!
[02:03:33.008 --> 02:03:33.529]  Oh, yes!
[02:03:33.529 --> 02:03:33.689]  Ah!
[02:03:35.905 --> 02:03:38.747]  Hey, New World Order, that isn't going to help you.
[02:03:38.747 --> 02:03:50.758]  And striking me down, or suing me into oblivion, or making stuff up about me in the media, that's not going to hurt the movement to put you in prison, you bunch of made-off criminals.
[02:03:50.758 --> 02:03:54.181]  Hey, we broke the federal reports about how patriots are terrorists.
[02:03:54.181 --> 02:03:56.263]  We snuck into the Bohemian Grove.
[02:03:56.263 --> 02:04:03.309]  We've brought on the big guests, the Willie Nelsons and the Charlie Sheens and the Jesse Venturas for 9-11 Truth, and so many others.
[02:04:04.841 --> 02:04:06.401]  Think about all the work we've done.
[02:04:06.401 --> 02:04:07.362]  Think about all the things we've done.
[02:04:07.362 --> 02:04:09.182]  Think about the success we've had.
[02:04:09.182 --> 02:04:19.524]  And we've always... I mean, I remember in 1999, they told me for months, they said, stop bashing the New World Order, stop talking about Bill Clinton, stop talking about how the Waco people were murdered, or you're off the air.
[02:04:19.524 --> 02:04:22.885]  And I said, my show's number one talk show in this time slot.
[02:04:22.885 --> 02:04:24.806]  You're paying me a couple hundred dollars a week.
[02:04:24.806 --> 02:04:28.166]  I make you all this money, and you all treat me like crap up here.
[02:04:28.166 --> 02:04:32.988]  Because the old general manager that hired me left and went to run the YMCA locally.
[02:04:32.988 --> 02:04:33.928]  They had this new guy in there.
[02:04:35.171 --> 02:04:38.913]  And they said, when they fired me, they laughed and said, you'll never be in radio again.
[02:04:38.913 --> 02:04:41.195]  They didn't know I'd already started my show on Genesis years before.
[02:04:41.195 --> 02:04:42.816]  They'd laugh about that.
[02:04:42.816 --> 02:04:44.557]  And I said, okay, Mac.
[02:04:44.557 --> 02:04:45.257]  We'll see.
[02:04:45.257 --> 02:04:45.878]  We'll see.
[02:04:45.878 --> 02:04:46.798]  Ha ha.
[02:04:46.798 --> 02:04:51.641]  So, again, you know they're coming after you when they're shutting down your material, trying to block it out all over.
[02:04:51.641 --> 02:04:52.742]  By the way, it's not just me.
[02:04:52.742 --> 02:04:57.404]  They've been banning anti-New World Order videos and other channels everywhere this weekend.
[02:04:57.404 --> 02:04:58.445]  I knew it was coming.
[02:04:58.445 --> 02:04:59.486]  It's the Night of the Long Knives.
[02:05:01.508 --> 02:05:07.071]  As the economy continues to plummet, many of us will have to make difficult choices and cut back on our expenses.
[02:05:07.071 --> 02:05:10.032]  One thing we cannot afford to cut back on, though, is our health.
[02:05:10.032 --> 02:05:17.136]  If you suffer from chronic illness, stress, weak immune health, or just feel tired, you need to visit Shentrition.com.
[02:05:17.136 --> 02:05:20.878]  Shentrition is an innovative supplement that stimulates the healing power of the body.
[02:05:21.458 --> 02:05:23.479]  Shentritian is made up of two parts.
[02:05:23.479 --> 02:05:27.121]  The first part is superfoods, alkalizing greens and hemp protein.
[02:05:27.121 --> 02:05:31.584]  The second half contains a powerful herbal formula to heal and detoxify the body.

[02:05:47.552 --> 02:05:50.594]  That's S-H-E-N-T-R-I-T-I-O-N.
[02:05:50.934 --> 02:05:54.218]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:06:07.888 --> 02:06:13.772]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:06:13.772 --> 02:06:20.256]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:06:20.256 --> 02:06:22.237]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:06:22.237 --> 02:06:24.698]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:06:24.698 --> 02:06:35.585]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:06:37.879 --> 02:06:39.540]  It's not about left or right.
[02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:41.400]  It's about a one world government.
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:48.323]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:06:48.323 --> 02:06:56.566]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at Infowars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:56.566 --> 02:06:58.146]  The Obama Deception.
[02:06:58.146 --> 02:06:59.327]  The people strike back.
[02:07:01.061 --> 02:07:02.743]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[02:07:02.743 --> 02:07:04.506]  What does humidity mean to you?
[02:07:04.506 --> 02:07:07.189]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:12.336]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[02:07:12.336 --> 02:07:15.520]  That's why I'd like you to visit acolablue.com.
[02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:18.985]  Acolablue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator.
[02:07:19.406 --> 02:07:31.953]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[02:07:31.953 --> 02:07:33.975]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[02:07:33.975 --> 02:07:35.696]  I use one every day.
[02:07:35.696 --> 02:07:38.157]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[02:07:38.437 --> 02:07:41.599]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:19.570 --> 02:08:23.681]  We are now simulcasting the last hour and 52 minutes at PrisonPlanet.TV
[02:08:26.209 --> 02:08:29.412]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:08:29.412 --> 02:08:35.557]  Next hour I will break down census takers getting GPS at every American's doorstep and how this ties in.
[02:08:35.557 --> 02:08:39.860]  I went and did the research and have the actual facts and it is not pretty.
[02:08:39.860 --> 02:08:42.162]  We're going to go to Dr. Jerome Corsi here in just a moment.
[02:08:42.162 --> 02:08:46.926]  First I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this radio slash TV show possible.
[02:08:46.926 --> 02:08:50.909]  First off, it's made possible by PrisonPlanet.tv subscribers, viewers like you.
[02:08:50.909 --> 02:08:52.450]  I want to thank all of you out there.
[02:08:53.471 --> 02:08:57.954]  Also, folks like Home Gain, a great sponsor that we have.
[02:08:57.954 --> 02:09:01.177]  H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N dot com.
[02:09:01.177 --> 02:09:07.501]  This is a great place to get you started buying or selling a home, finding a realtor, and getting any real estate questions answered.
[02:09:07.501 --> 02:09:09.443]  It's a wonderful way to monitor the value of your home.
[02:09:10.103 --> 02:09:17.288]  There is a feature called Street View where you can look at the house at street level and take a virtual walk through the neighborhood you're interested in.
[02:09:17.288 --> 02:09:18.389]  You've got to see it for yourself.
[02:09:18.389 --> 02:09:19.570]  There are tons of tools to help you.
[02:09:19.570 --> 02:09:30.738]  For instance, they have a home sale maximizer that will tell you on average what the most inexpensive home repairs or upgrades are that will increase the amount of sale value of your house the most.
[02:09:30.738 --> 02:09:34.100]  For ten years these folks have been helping home sellers and buyers.
[02:09:34.100 --> 02:09:36.462]  Now is no time to mess around with your largest asset.

[02:10:10.393 --> 02:10:14.557]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid and here's a good way to just to do just that.
[02:10:14.557 --> 02:10:18.461]  A solar power generator is now available from our longtime sponsor Solutions from Science.
[02:10:18.461 --> 02:10:23.626]  It's designed to provide 800 watts of power on demand in the event of any disaster or outage.
[02:10:23.626 --> 02:10:32.495]  You can get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the PowerSource 1800 power plant and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity
[02:10:33.703 --> 02:10:39.227]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but the blackout gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[02:10:39.227 --> 02:10:42.789]  The solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home.
[02:10:42.789 --> 02:10:44.931]  It's the perfect emergency backup for troubled times.
[02:10:44.931 --> 02:10:48.273]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move now.
[02:10:48.273 --> 02:10:50.634]  Their website is MySolarBackup.com.
[02:10:50.634 --> 02:10:52.696]  MySolarBackup.com.
[02:10:52.696 --> 02:10:53.436]  Or you can give them a call.
[02:10:53.436 --> 02:10:53.876]  It's all free.
[02:10:53.876 --> 02:10:53.937]  877-327-0365.
[02:10:53.937 --> 02:10:54.017]  877-327-0365.
[02:10:54.017 --> 02:10:54.517]  MySolarBackup.com.
[02:11:04.102 --> 02:11:12.829]  Okay, for the next 50 minutes we're joined by Dr. Jerome Corsi, here as we simulcast at PrisonPlanet.tv with a radio show.
[02:11:12.829 --> 02:11:15.971]  And he wrote an excellent article back in 2007 at WorldNetDaily.
[02:11:15.971 --> 02:11:23.677]  We're covering it simultaneously here from the SPP documents that Judicial Watch and others had sued to get of the North American Union body.
[02:11:23.677 --> 02:11:31.843]  And they kept saying, we're going to use pandemic flu, economic crises to bring in the North American Union, but this is secret from the public.
[02:11:31.843 --> 02:11:33.445]  We've got to keep this secret from the public.
[02:11:34.385 --> 02:11:40.031]  Uh, and they went over how the World Health Organization under this treaty agreement with Mexico and Canada would be in charge.
[02:11:40.031 --> 02:11:41.773]  Now we see that in the news.
[02:11:41.773 --> 02:11:45.496]  Mainstream news are now reporting what we reported and what Dr. Corsi's reporting.
[02:11:45.496 --> 02:11:51.422]  That this is the great time for the new world order and globalism because it is now out in the open.
[02:11:51.422 --> 02:11:56.347]  So to break this down and his overall take on this fear-mongering distraction
[02:11:57.248 --> 02:12:04.491]  It's been used to get all the other real news out of the headlines is Dr. Jerome Corsi, best-selling author and writes for WorldNetDaily.
[02:12:04.491 --> 02:12:06.071]  Doc, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:12:06.071 --> 02:12:06.552]  Hi, Alex.
[02:12:06.552 --> 02:12:07.632]  Great pleasure to be with you.
[02:12:07.632 --> 02:12:08.833]  Thank you.
[02:12:08.833 --> 02:12:09.233]  You bet.
[02:12:09.233 --> 02:12:16.295]  Okay, let's go back to that article you wrote in 2007, which is almost like prophecy with what actually happened.
[02:12:16.295 --> 02:12:24.959]  Well, in 2007, there was the Security and Prosperity Partnership up in Montebello in Quebec, Canada.
[02:12:24.959 --> 02:12:25.539]  I was there.
[02:12:26.403 --> 02:12:42.030]  And what came out of that agreement was a, out of that meeting was a new agreement that was signed by Canada, the United States, and Mexico, which was a North American plan for avian flu and pandemic influenza.
[02:12:42.030 --> 02:12:50.534]  And what the document agreed to was that if there was going to be an outbreak of avian flu or any pandemic influenza in North America,
[02:12:51.810 --> 02:12:59.253]  We, the United States, and the Canada and Mexico would handle that outbreak under the United Nations law.
[02:12:59.253 --> 02:13:11.778]  And I documented that there is, in fact, the United Nations has a coordinator, a UN System Influenza Coordinator, who's Dr. David Nabarro.
[02:13:11.778 --> 02:13:16.861]  I believe he still is Senior Policy Advisor to the UN Director General.
[02:13:16.861 --> 02:13:20.042]  And the United States has been moving in this direction for some time.
[02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:29.764]  In 2005, President Bush announced the new International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza.
[02:13:29.764 --> 02:13:35.447]  It was at a high-level plenary meeting at the UN General Assembly in New York, September 14, 2005.
[02:13:35.447 --> 02:13:44.851]  So, it's quite clear that North America has a plan for handling these health emergencies, and the plan is to go under the Blue Helmet rule.
[02:13:47.944 --> 02:13:58.149]  What it means, essentially, Alex, kind of breaking it down, is that the United States is no longer sovereign over health emergency situations.
[02:13:58.149 --> 02:14:00.710]  That's the bottom line.
[02:14:00.710 --> 02:14:01.490]  Are you there, Alex?
[02:14:01.490 --> 02:14:04.111]  Yes, I know it's rare for me to actually shut up and listen to you.
[02:14:04.111 --> 02:14:06.632]  I'm just listening to you go over it.
[02:14:06.632 --> 02:14:07.173]  Please continue.
[02:14:07.173 --> 02:14:11.835]  In fact, it's still, the agreement is still on the SPP website.
[02:14:11.835 --> 02:14:14.416]  If you take a look at the SPP, www.spp.gov.
[02:14:17.546 --> 02:14:23.709]  And you search for the Montebello Conference until very recently, and I think it's still there today.
[02:14:23.709 --> 02:14:25.710]  You can read the agreement that was signed.
[02:14:25.710 --> 02:14:33.513]  So, I mean, it's clear that this is an international agreement and that President Bush has made U.S.
[02:14:33.513 --> 02:14:37.255]  management of a true pandemic situation subservient to international law.
[02:14:40.416 --> 02:14:49.442]  Now, I want to expand on that because, I mean, it's one thing to read you writing about this a couple years ago from the documents, you know, you and I and others have researched it, we know it's true.
[02:14:49.442 --> 02:14:58.648]  It's another thing to see Reuters, you know, with UN in control of global pandemic, UN telling Mexico, US, Canada, Europe, China what to do.
[02:14:58.648 --> 02:15:08.834]  This is more just acclamation, and that's part one I want you to comment on, and part two, Fox, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, all, yes, Marshall Law,
[02:15:10.596 --> 02:15:12.277]  Is a good thing.
[02:15:12.277 --> 02:15:14.119]  Forced inoculation is a good thing.
[02:15:14.119 --> 02:15:15.620]  We may lock down U.S.
[02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:18.142]  cities, but we're going to leave the borders open.
[02:15:18.142 --> 02:15:19.984]  How ridiculous is that?
[02:15:19.984 --> 02:15:25.328]  Well, as I point out, by the way, it is on the SPP.gov website.
[02:15:25.328 --> 02:15:29.372]  I just found it under the Montebello Conference.
[02:15:29.372 --> 02:15:37.659]  So far, this whole swine flu outbreak has turned out to be completely a minor event.
[02:15:38.271 --> 02:15:39.852]  There's very few cases of it.
[02:15:39.852 --> 02:15:43.355]  The cases that are found in the United States are not lethal.
[02:15:43.355 --> 02:15:49.399]  They're able to be handled by various kinds of antibiotics that we have on the shelf.
[02:15:49.399 --> 02:15:58.425]  The cases that are in Mexico are occurring because Mexico is largely a third world country and there aren't even good sanitary conditions in much of Mexico.
[02:15:58.425 --> 02:16:04.970]  So Mexico is going to be more prone to having an outbreak like this, be a little bit more virulent.
[02:16:04.970 --> 02:16:07.151]  But even in Mexico there aren't very many cases.
[02:16:07.151 --> 02:16:07.852]  So, so far
[02:16:08.562 --> 02:16:10.923]  I'm categorizing this as just a scare.
[02:16:10.923 --> 02:16:12.803]  It's a hysteria.
[02:16:12.803 --> 02:16:27.607]  Now, what it does reflect, Alex, is when you look at it, look at the amount of media attention, the going to, you know, one of the top levels for the World Health Organization to declare that this is a pandemic.
[02:16:27.607 --> 02:16:37.650]  All the quarantining that's going on in Mexico, the preparations are clearly in place for the governments in North America to use a pandemic
[02:16:38.359 --> 02:16:39.821]  We're good to go.
[02:17:00.014 --> 02:17:04.517]  Well, Doc, I didn't know what your view on this would be, but it's identical to mine.
[02:17:04.517 --> 02:17:21.229]  Day one, I said, this is a hoax, this is a fraud, but they're using this as a beta test to prepare for martial law, and then they basically come out and said that, that, oh, well, we know a mega flu is coming in the next six months or so, the head of Homeland Security said, and others, and this was a good drill for us.
[02:17:21.929 --> 02:17:25.653]  You know, we are going to have to forcibly inoculate you in lockdown cities.
[02:17:25.653 --> 02:17:34.081]  This is perfect to have this while society collapse, while the offshore banks, and now Bloomberg reports, have stolen $14 plus trillion.
[02:17:34.081 --> 02:17:35.602]  It's now over $12 trillion.
[02:17:35.602 --> 02:17:37.143]  Last time it was $12 trillion.
[02:17:37.143 --> 02:17:40.406]  Every few months we learn the next, you know, horrible number, over a trillion a month.
[02:17:41.347 --> 02:18:09.325]  uh... in the last six months since the banker takeover it's now fourteen plus trillion uh... in in what they've committed to or spent and this is a perfect cover now every time a nation rebels or resists oh we gotta lock everything down a flu popped up whether it kills people or not i mean this is amazing well also Alex one of the other parts of this that is important to note is that it's been accepted in the mainstream media that all of this is just normal in other words the possibility of government
[02:18:09.744 --> 02:18:23.033]  Coming in and shutting down schools, issuing quarantines, even possibly martial law or sequestering people who show up as being, somehow or other, showing symptoms of this disease.
[02:18:23.033 --> 02:18:25.494]  No, they've been setting up the tent cities.
[02:18:25.494 --> 02:18:28.136]  They've been setting exactly and acting it's a dry run.
[02:18:28.136 --> 02:18:29.857]  Do you think this is a dry run?
[02:18:29.857 --> 02:18:37.582]  It certainly has the characteristics of being a dry run because, you know, this much hysteria, I know it's a hysteria at this point because
[02:18:38.055 --> 02:18:39.335]  The cases aren't developing.
[02:18:39.335 --> 02:18:49.757]  We've had everybody scared, and you know, including my own family, frightened to death that this is going to be something that, you know, we need to take exceptional measures over.
[02:18:49.757 --> 02:18:55.338]  And truthfully, what there's been one death in the United States for this entire outbreak.
[02:18:55.338 --> 02:18:57.338]  And that was somebody from Mexico City.
[02:18:57.338 --> 02:19:07.340]  From Mexico City, you know, we've got 300 million people now in the United States, and we have one death of someone who came from Mexico City, and yet we have
[02:19:07.856 --> 02:19:12.939]  Nightly news reporting and the White House coming out with special announcements.
[02:19:12.939 --> 02:19:15.160]  We have the military involved.
[02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:18.581]  Remember, I also, Alex, have done a series of reports on U.S.
[02:19:18.581 --> 02:19:19.822]  NORTHCOM.
[02:19:19.822 --> 02:19:20.262]  And U.S.
[02:19:20.262 --> 02:19:27.086]  NORTHCOM, which is a combatant military command that is tasked with handling U.S.
[02:19:27.086 --> 02:19:29.847]  emergency situations.
[02:19:29.847 --> 02:19:30.087]  U.S.
[02:19:30.087 --> 02:19:35.810]  NORTHCOM has drilled and done exercises on pandemic influenza outbreaks.
[02:19:36.853 --> 02:19:38.434]  Dr. Corsi's all there.
[02:19:38.434 --> 02:19:39.214]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:19:39.214 --> 02:19:41.135]  Recap that when we come back.
[02:19:41.135 --> 02:19:45.057]  I mean, you wrote the book on this two years ago and now it's happening.
[02:19:45.057 --> 02:19:48.979]  And then I said last Saturday, now eight days ago, I said, watch.
[02:19:48.979 --> 02:19:51.601]  They're going to say, oh, this thing's going to mutate.
[02:19:51.601 --> 02:19:52.881]  It's in the fall.
[02:19:52.881 --> 02:19:54.702]  We may need martial law.
[02:19:54.702 --> 02:19:56.463]  And that's now what they're saying.
[02:19:56.463 --> 02:19:58.324]  These guys are so predictable.
[02:19:58.324 --> 02:20:01.286]  Dr. Corsi, stay with us.
[02:20:01.286 --> 02:20:01.966]  You worry.
[02:20:01.966 --> 02:20:04.007]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[02:20:04.312 --> 02:20:04.855]  Hi.
[02:20:04.855 --> 02:20:07.308]  Summer's coming and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[02:20:07.642 --> 02:20:12.186]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[02:20:12.186 --> 02:20:14.648]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[02:20:14.648 --> 02:20:18.010]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[02:20:18.010 --> 02:20:19.952]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[02:20:19.952 --> 02:20:22.734]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[02:20:22.734 --> 02:20:26.457]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[02:20:26.457 --> 02:20:30.861]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[02:20:30.861 --> 02:20:34.604]  And her Wild Cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[02:20:34.944 --> 02:20:41.290]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[02:20:41.290 --> 02:20:43.632]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[02:20:43.632 --> 02:20:45.754]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[02:20:45.754 --> 02:20:50.419]  So go to offthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:20:50.419 --> 02:20:51.320]  Start now.
[02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:53.041]  Knowledge is power.
[02:20:53.041 --> 02:20:54.042]  Better take action.
[02:20:54.042 --> 02:20:55.003]  I think a storm's coming.
[02:21:02.017 --> 02:21:05.099]  Are you tired of losing your hard-earned savings in retirement?
[02:21:05.099 --> 02:21:12.145]  Does the continued loss of purchasing power through the hidden tax of inflation brought on by trillions of dollars in government bailouts bother you?
[02:21:12.145 --> 02:21:16.969]  Then please let me, Duane Daly, with Midas Resources, help you to protect what you have left.
[02:21:16.969 --> 02:21:26.496]  Call me at 800-686-2237, extension 115, and I will explain to you how to retain your wealth and purchasing power now and in the future with gold and silver.
[02:21:26.946 --> 02:21:37.014]  Gold and silver have been a form of currency for 6,000 years, compared to our present fiat currency, which has only been in existence for 38 years and failing fast.
[02:21:37.014 --> 02:21:44.380]  Call me, Duane Daly, at 800-686-2237, extension 115, to start your protection of wealth today.
[02:21:44.380 --> 02:21:48.343]  I will custom fit the protection package to your personal needs.
[02:21:48.343 --> 02:21:50.565]  No amount is too small, so start today.
[02:21:51.035 --> 02:21:54.316]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:54.316 --> 02:21:59.317]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[02:22:15.347 --> 02:22:21.932]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:22:21.932 --> 02:22:23.913]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:22:23.913 --> 02:22:26.415]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[02:22:26.415 --> 02:22:38.004]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:22:38.004 --> 02:22:39.665]  It's not about left or right.
[02:22:39.665 --> 02:22:41.046]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:22:41.528 --> 02:22:48.434]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:22:48.434 --> 02:22:56.701]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:56.701 --> 02:22:58.263]  The Obama Deception.
[02:22:58.263 --> 02:22:59.464]  The people strike back.
[02:23:01.491 --> 02:23:04.992]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[02:23:04.992 --> 02:23:06.913]  Now, going green can save money.
[02:23:06.913 --> 02:23:12.475]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[02:23:12.475 --> 02:23:20.499]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[02:23:20.499 --> 02:23:31.203]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bedini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[02:23:31.203 --> 02:23:31.583]  I think so.
[02:24:13.305 --> 02:24:31.949]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are under United Nations control via treaty during biological releases.
[02:24:31.949 --> 02:24:40.251]  And the executive is over the Congress under PD51, something Dr. Corsi has also reported on in depth, but that we cover in my films
[02:24:41.576 --> 02:24:48.507]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement and others.
[02:24:48.507 --> 02:24:56.579]  Now, Dr. Corsi, you were getting into the fact that NORTHCOM's role in they've signed deals with the Canadians and the Mexicans to jointly use each other's troops.
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:09.105]  During these pandemics, and you have the SPP and Pastor, as you've talked about on Lou Dobbs, saying, we're going to use crises, never waste a crisis, to bring this thing in.
[02:25:09.105 --> 02:25:10.185]  And you saw their response.
[02:25:10.185 --> 02:25:18.108]  They said, as a continent, we've got to respond to this, from Alaska to southern Mexico, the border of Guatemala.
[02:25:18.108 --> 02:25:19.629]  We're going to lock down U.S.
[02:25:19.629 --> 02:25:23.710]  cities, maybe, and Mexican cities, but not the borders.
[02:25:23.710 --> 02:25:24.771]  How ridiculous is that?
[02:25:25.387 --> 02:25:40.894]  Well, and I think this is, I think it again proves the point, Alex, and that is that the Security and Prosperity Partnership is designed as a, not just an economic, to advance the economic agreement that was NAFTA into a political agreement.
[02:25:40.894 --> 02:25:44.475]  And the political agreement advances international law.
[02:25:44.475 --> 02:25:53.939]  So that, of course they don't, you know, under SPP the border is going to be kept open, because that's a primary agreement of the Security and Prosperity Partnership Agreement.
[02:25:54.662 --> 02:26:04.624]  And then when you've got this avian flu and pandemic influenza SPP agreement, it puts everything under the United Nations.
[02:26:04.624 --> 02:26:10.986]  The North American plan is under United Nations and World Health Organization guidelines.
[02:26:10.986 --> 02:26:12.266]  And that's just clear.
[02:26:12.266 --> 02:26:21.208]  The standards and guidelines of the World Health Organization and the rules of the world are the rules that in North America would apply.
[02:26:21.892 --> 02:26:25.815]  To the management of any health pandemic or health crisis.
[02:26:25.815 --> 02:26:26.215]  And the U.S.
[02:26:26.215 --> 02:26:33.559]  military, which has agreements with the Canadian military, is ready to act in a capacity if there should be an emergency situation.
[02:26:33.559 --> 02:26:42.765]  Remember, Alex, I also reported that under the Homeland Security and National Security Directive that were issued by President Bush, I believe in 2007,
[02:26:44.802 --> 02:26:50.828]  I'd have to go and get the exact numbers, but Homeland Security Directive 51, and I can look those up here in a minute.
[02:26:50.828 --> 02:26:53.771]  John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[02:26:53.771 --> 02:27:04.482]  All of these, well these two specific directives that I wrote about give the President the opportunity to declare an emergency, including a health emergency, under the President's own authority.
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:08.281]  Without necessarily getting concurrence from Congress.
[02:27:08.281 --> 02:27:12.283]  No, in fact, Congress isn't allowed to see those agreements and that's why they're angry and upset.
[02:27:12.283 --> 02:27:24.208]  None of these agreements have gone through Congress, including the SPP document that agreed that there was a North American plan for avian and pandemic influenza.
[02:27:24.208 --> 02:27:26.909]  That did not go to Congress to get approved.
[02:27:26.909 --> 02:27:32.672]  Nor did these two presidential directives that were signed by President Bush go to Congress to get approved.
[02:27:33.266 --> 02:27:46.417]  So the President could declare a health emergency, could say the World Trade Organization rules apply and blue helmets are available if needed, and task through the Department of Defense, the U.S.
[02:27:46.417 --> 02:27:47.078]  NORTHCOM,
[02:27:47.717 --> 02:27:56.660]  To utilize military in situations that could be quarantine or martial law or whatever was else required for the health emergency.
[02:27:56.660 --> 02:28:06.484]  And Dr. Corsi, they've been saying this on the news, talking about foreign assets, NORTHCOM, forced inoculations, lockdowns of cities, but oh no, we'll never lock down the border.
[02:28:06.484 --> 02:28:08.325]  I'm not even saying lock it down for this.
[02:28:08.325 --> 02:28:11.346]  The point is they just say that is absolutely sacrosanct.
[02:28:11.886 --> 02:28:13.568]  You don't touch that, that's a taboo.
[02:28:13.568 --> 02:28:14.749]  But if you want to lock down U.S.
[02:28:14.749 --> 02:28:17.151]  cities, that's wonderful.
[02:28:17.151 --> 02:28:18.452]  And clearly the U.N.
[02:28:18.452 --> 02:28:23.516]  said greatest threat ever facing humanity in 90 years, could kill millions, could kill billions.
[02:28:23.516 --> 02:28:24.697]  Absolute fear-mongering.
[02:28:24.697 --> 02:28:26.539]  So, my family took it serious too.
[02:28:26.539 --> 02:28:27.540]  You said your family.
[02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:30.042]  People are like, you know, my wife's like, let's do something, let's be safe.
[02:28:30.042 --> 02:28:31.603]  And I said, okay, we'll play it safe.
[02:28:31.603 --> 02:28:37.709]  Because even though the government does cry wolf, you still have to take it serious when they say this could be the worst thing
[02:28:38.129 --> 02:28:40.631]  You know, since Adolf Hitler, basically.
[02:28:40.631 --> 02:28:45.794]  But clearly, they're now admitting this is a PSY-OPT, a beta test, martial law.
[02:28:45.794 --> 02:28:51.477]  Which they need to PSY-OPT test, because clearly we're going into this worldwide economic collapse.
[02:28:51.477 --> 02:28:54.019]  Well, here's the evidence that I know is the case, okay?
[02:28:54.019 --> 02:29:07.627]  So, first of all, now we're having the government coming out and saying, Mexico has announced that the H1N1 flu epidemic, they won't call it swine flu anymore, Mexico says it's past its peak.
[02:29:08.476 --> 02:29:09.057]  I don't
[02:29:26.669 --> 02:29:29.731]  N1H1 virus is going to kill all together worldwide.
[02:29:29.731 --> 02:29:30.051]  Stay there.
[02:29:30.051 --> 02:29:30.531]  No it does.
[02:29:30.531 --> 02:29:32.512]  We have 36,000 die a year.
[02:29:32.512 --> 02:29:35.854]  Some say it's really 15, but the government CDC says 36,000.
[02:29:35.854 --> 02:29:37.895]  More than that die in Mexico.
[02:29:37.895 --> 02:29:41.317]  A quarter of a million die worldwide on average each year from flu.
[02:29:41.317 --> 02:29:44.859]  And we've had less than 50 people die from this thing worldwide.
[02:29:44.859 --> 02:29:46.179]  And a couple thousand sick.
[02:29:46.179 --> 02:29:50.222]  So, clearly this is the model of global tyranny they're going to use.
[02:29:50.222 --> 02:29:51.602]  Stay there Dr. Corsi.
[02:29:51.602 --> 02:29:53.003]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.003 --> 02:29:54.504]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.510 --> 02:30:01.777]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.777 --> 02:30:05.161]  Hello, this is Tom with hempusa.org.
[02:30:05.161 --> 02:30:12.309]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months, and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.

[02:31:00.238 --> 02:31:07.061]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:31:07.839 --> 02:31:13.704]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:31:13.704 --> 02:31:20.210]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:31:20.210 --> 02:31:22.191]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:31:22.191 --> 02:31:24.654]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:31:24.654 --> 02:31:35.543]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:31:37.828 --> 02:31:39.489]  It's not about left or right.
[02:31:39.489 --> 02:31:41.349]  It's about a one world government.
[02:31:41.349 --> 02:31:48.252]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:31:48.252 --> 02:31:56.515]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:56.515 --> 02:31:58.095]  The Obama Deception.
[02:31:58.095 --> 02:31:59.276]  The people strike back.
[02:32:01.272 --> 02:32:03.252]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:32:03.252 --> 02:32:10.214]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:32:10.214 --> 02:32:18.616]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:32:18.616 --> 02:32:24.337]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:32:24.517 --> 02:32:26.359]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:32:26.359 --> 02:32:28.541]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:32:28.541 --> 02:32:33.085]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:32:33.085 --> 02:32:35.307]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:32:35.307 --> 02:32:43.074]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:32:43.114 --> 02:32:43.974]  We're good to go.
[02:33:19.696 --> 02:33:36.445]  We're talking to Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[02:33:36.445 --> 02:33:40.627]  We carry his book that's since been updated, The Late Great USA.
[02:33:40.627 --> 02:33:45.169]  It's great to give to friends and family that don't know about the North American Union, The Globalist Takeover.
[02:33:45.169 --> 02:33:46.030]  You know, Dr. Corsi,
[02:33:47.577 --> 02:33:55.840]  You write, I write about PDD 51, how they'll use flu pandemics to set up the North American Union and expand police state.
[02:33:55.840 --> 02:34:00.722]  They're openly saying forced inoculation, roundups, arrests, troops.
[02:34:00.722 --> 02:34:06.343]  The Kentucky Derby has regular army arresting fans that jumped on the track after the horse won.
[02:34:06.343 --> 02:34:08.384]  Saturday, that's in the news.
[02:34:08.384 --> 02:34:09.685]  The troops are on the streets.
[02:34:09.685 --> 02:34:12.866]  NORTHCOM, 20,000 troops, Homeland Brigade.
[02:34:14.435 --> 02:34:23.804]  All of this stuff that I particularly talked about 10, 12, 13 years ago is now openly out there and people then still email me saying, don't fear monger about the troops!
[02:34:23.804 --> 02:34:27.367]  You know, this is completely unnormal to have troops running around.
[02:34:27.367 --> 02:34:33.973]  Then, three weeks ago, you may not know about this, Tennessee governor found out because of this show about military checkpoints they were running in the newspapers.
[02:34:34.781 --> 02:34:39.566]  And the military, when the governor said, don't do it, the military said, we don't care.
[02:34:39.566 --> 02:34:40.807]  We're going to go ahead and do it.
[02:34:40.807 --> 02:34:43.070]  And they did it, Dr. Corsi.
[02:34:43.070 --> 02:34:45.312]  I mean, this is getting to be out of control.
[02:34:45.312 --> 02:34:50.077]  The two directives that I wrote about, and I wrote about these in May 2007.
[02:34:50.077 --> 02:34:57.204]  They were the National Security Presidential Directive 51 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20.
[02:34:58.413 --> 02:35:27.835]  Which established under this new Office of National Continuity Coordinator, Continuity of Government theme, that the President could declare an emergency, a catastrophic emergency, and assume control of the operation of all levels of government, federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal, as well as private sector organizations that would be to continue functioning under the President's directive in the event of a national emergency without going to Congress.
[02:35:28.757 --> 02:35:30.779]  So those are there.
[02:35:30.779 --> 02:35:36.263]  Those remain powers now that President Obama could exercise.
[02:35:36.263 --> 02:35:42.087]  And again, there was no congressional vote approving or affirming these presidential directives.
[02:35:42.087 --> 02:35:45.750]  They were done strictly on the signature of President Bush.
[02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:55.057]  I also like to remind everyone, if you do a very careful analysis, there's a lot of these issues where President Obama is identical to President Bush.
[02:35:55.057 --> 02:35:56.979]  The grabbing of power
[02:35:57.645 --> 02:36:08.634]  The willingness to have this North American Union, I've cautioned people that President Obama would break his campaign promises to renegotiate NAFTA.
[02:36:08.634 --> 02:36:22.785]  Those were just campaign promises that were issued when President, then candidate Obama, was campaigning in states like Michigan and Ohio, where he wanted the votes of people who had lost their jobs to outsourcing to foreign governments.
[02:36:24.881 --> 02:36:33.104]  You know, the foreign countries rather, under NAFTA and our World Trade Organization, other international free trade agreements.
[02:36:33.104 --> 02:36:51.131]  So now, Austin Goolsbee, you remember the candidate Obama was advised by this professor, Austin Goolsbee, who was fired by the campaign, when he was discovered to have gone to Canada and said, wink, wink, don't worry, when candidate Obama becomes President Obama,
[02:36:51.741 --> 02:36:53.643]  He will not renegotiate NAFTA.
[02:36:53.643 --> 02:37:00.148]  Well, Austin Goolsbee's now rehired, and he's working with the Council of Economic Advisors within the White House.
[02:37:00.148 --> 02:37:14.439]  So this has all been a wink-wink game, and everything that President Bush did, or more, to create open borders to integrate North America, as I said, like Great USA, is going to be done by President Obama.
[02:37:14.439 --> 02:37:20.303]  Including reintroducing comprehensive immigration reform, which was, again, President Bush's push.
[02:37:20.303 --> 02:37:21.464]  So I see no difference.
[02:37:22.299 --> 02:37:22.739]  Absolutely.
[02:37:38.220 --> 02:37:40.141]  You know, they are doing this incrementally.
[02:37:40.141 --> 02:37:45.044]  They are boiling us like a frog in a bucket of water.
[02:37:45.044 --> 02:37:47.425]  For those that don't know, it's true.
[02:37:47.425 --> 02:37:53.789]  I've talked to folks who eat frogs in Louisiana, Mississippi, and that's where these stories come from.
[02:37:53.789 --> 02:38:01.653]  You put a frog in cold water and slowly turn it up, he will sit there like it's a hot tub until it's boiling and die without jumping out.
[02:38:01.653 --> 02:38:04.175]  But you throw a frog into boiling water, he'll jump right out.
[02:38:04.895 --> 02:38:06.417]  And it's this incrementalism.
[02:38:06.417 --> 02:38:08.699]  People are like, where's the martial law, Alex?
[02:38:08.699 --> 02:38:10.301]  Where's the police state?
[02:38:10.301 --> 02:38:12.163]  Where's the North American Union?
[02:38:12.163 --> 02:38:12.744]  Where is it?
[02:38:12.744 --> 02:38:17.329]  I'm like, do you see the troops with sidearms arresting people at the Kentucky Derby?
[02:38:17.329 --> 02:38:18.470]  Regular Army.
[02:38:18.470 --> 02:38:19.912]  Do you see the Super Bowl with troops?
[02:38:19.912 --> 02:38:22.334]  Do you see troops at the shooting in Alabama?
[02:38:22.334 --> 02:38:24.537]  Do you see troops at DWI checkpoints?
[02:38:25.417 --> 02:38:29.839]  Now, do you see them with the jaws of life at car wrecks, all for PR?
[02:38:29.839 --> 02:38:35.301]  Do you see them using the Patriot Act in non-terror-related cases and violating due process everywhere?
[02:38:35.301 --> 02:38:43.024]  Do you see Obama saying he's going to sign a treaty and try to push it through Congress to literally ban guns in the words of CNN?
[02:38:43.024 --> 02:38:48.326]  I'd rather think it hadn't gotten that bad of an interpretation, though it does devastate the Second Amendment.
[02:38:48.326 --> 02:38:50.127]  All of this is going on!
[02:38:50.127 --> 02:38:52.508]  What this does, I mean, what this whole
[02:38:53.021 --> 02:38:53.481]  A hoax.
[02:38:53.481 --> 02:38:58.983]  This, I think, is clearly a hoax, this swine flu or N1H1 virus.
[02:38:58.983 --> 02:39:17.791]  What it does is it prepares people for being so scared that they are ready to accept military involvement, the UN's involvement, the World Health Organization's involvement is not questioned, and military involvement if the President declares it.
[02:39:17.791 --> 02:39:20.512]  Now, the fact that this is a hoax, you've got now
[02:39:21.334 --> 02:39:24.398]  The World Health Organization's scrambling.
[02:39:24.398 --> 02:39:32.510]  They're now, which I see absolutely no basis here in the science or the history of viruses.
[02:39:32.510 --> 02:39:37.517]  They're now trying to argue that, you know, going from person to pig, can it jump back?
[02:39:38.140 --> 02:39:41.382]  That's a story that's being reported right now by the Associated Press.
[02:39:41.382 --> 02:39:52.887]  They're also saying it may mutate with other viruses or mutate on its own and become hyper-deadly for the fall and winter, so you better take the vaccine they're going to have ready for that.
[02:39:52.887 --> 02:40:05.094]  And also, you know, if you take a look at the history of what's been done under the Security and Prosperity Partnership, all the preparedness for the last 10 years, it's all been on avian flu.
[02:40:05.094 --> 02:40:07.755]  The swine flu issue has not been considered
[02:40:08.294 --> 02:40:09.395]  to be a major threat.
[02:40:09.395 --> 02:40:11.095]  Now, they've revived swine flu.
[02:40:11.095 --> 02:40:13.096]  That's now in the public mind.
[02:40:13.096 --> 02:40:17.959]  And they're trying to get these viruses just to have numbers, not names.
[02:40:17.959 --> 02:40:25.323]  And it seems to me the next argument is going to be that they can go between birds, they can go between pigs, they can go between humans.
[02:40:25.323 --> 02:40:27.884]  And it's all largely a scare.
[02:40:27.884 --> 02:40:37.869]  We have not had, since 1918, at the end of World War I, a pandemic that has caused millions of deaths around the world.
[02:40:38.547 --> 02:40:47.815]  But yet, this preparedness for it seems to be all out of proportion to any reality of a health emergency that has ever occurred.
[02:40:47.815 --> 02:40:50.877]  Yeah, it's clearly... In fact, they're even admitting that between the lines.
[02:40:50.877 --> 02:40:59.604]  They're saying, well, even though this may not be that bad, it's still a good drill because a newer, deadlier one will come.
[02:40:59.604 --> 02:41:01.786]  I mean, Napolitano said that last Sunday.
[02:41:01.786 --> 02:41:03.607]  She said that seven, eight days ago.
[02:41:03.607 --> 02:41:08.051]  Well, the other two things that make absolutely no sense, Alex, are that if this were
[02:41:08.797 --> 02:41:13.619]  Truly a health emergency and the focus were to protect US citizens.
[02:41:13.619 --> 02:41:16.220]  The first thing you would do is close the border with Mexico.
[02:41:16.220 --> 02:41:21.182]  That'd be absolutely the first thing you'd have to do to make sure that it was contained.
[02:41:21.182 --> 02:41:22.643]  China has virtually done that.
[02:41:22.643 --> 02:41:25.124]  China is restricting flights to Mexico.
[02:41:25.124 --> 02:41:29.946]  China is evidently rounding up Mexicans and putting them in quarantine in China.
[02:41:29.946 --> 02:41:32.206]  People who have traveled from Mexico.
[02:41:32.206 --> 02:41:34.727]  But we're not doing it in the United States.
[02:41:34.727 --> 02:41:38.289]  So it's clearly in the United States not considered to be
[02:41:39.673 --> 02:41:45.015]  Something that is of US national security is not the first priority in our response.
[02:41:45.015 --> 02:41:47.775]  We're acting in a continental response.
[02:41:47.775 --> 02:41:48.255]  Stop, stop.
[02:41:48.255 --> 02:41:49.156]  Let me start over.
[02:41:49.156 --> 02:41:56.198]  You just hit the zeitgeist, Dr. Korsi, and that's the point I've been hammering, but say it in your own words and break down the different facets from your perspective.
[02:41:56.198 --> 02:41:57.338]  Again, I'm going to say this slowly.
[02:41:58.345 --> 02:42:14.653]  They said day one over a week ago, they said it's already spread everywhere so there's no reason to lock down the border even though the supposed main vector of something threatening the entire future of society was about to come up here.
[02:42:14.653 --> 02:42:18.114]  Now, their argument was it's already spread outside the country so it doesn't matter.
[02:42:18.114 --> 02:42:26.338]  But any new cases out of Mexico, if it was so deadly, would continue to cause entirely new spreads of it.
[02:42:26.738 --> 02:42:38.105]  So, day one, they said, it's already spread, forget it, border stays wide open, planes stay in the air from Mexico, the main vector, but we may have to lock down U.S.
[02:42:38.105 --> 02:42:47.271]  cities, and they did lock down some houses and homes and hotels and things, and airplanes, and grab reporters and wouldn't test them for it, but held them for a week.
[02:42:47.271 --> 02:42:53.235]  So think about this, they fear-mongered and hyped like it was the end of the world, the movie 28 Days Later,
[02:42:54.756 --> 02:43:01.658]  But, then at the same time, in their actions here in the United States, it was like it was no big deal.
[02:43:01.658 --> 02:43:03.438]  So, just amazing.
[02:43:03.438 --> 02:43:05.218]  Now, I mean, flesh that out.
[02:43:05.218 --> 02:43:22.502]  Well, clearly, if additional people were coming from Mexico with contamination that could be spread to others, which is the key component of how this virus is supposed to spread, person to person, well then you would want to block the border and keep
[02:43:22.995 --> 02:43:25.216]  Infected people from coming across.
[02:43:25.216 --> 02:43:31.679]  If national security in the United States and health security were the primary objective, it's not.
[02:43:31.679 --> 02:43:42.263]  Because by keeping the border open, it accepts the risk that others infected in Mexico will come into the United States, even as illegal immigrants, and spread the disease.
[02:43:42.263 --> 02:43:50.586]  So clearly, it's a lie that national security or health security in the United States is the number one objective of the U.S.
[02:43:50.586 --> 02:43:52.687]  government in responding to the health emergency.
[02:43:53.246 --> 02:43:57.409]  We're responding on a continental basis in which we keep the border open.
[02:43:57.409 --> 02:44:04.093]  Secondly, I'd like to have an estimate, Alex, of the economic damage done by this hoax.
[02:44:04.093 --> 02:44:07.055]  In other words, how many conventions were cancelled?
[02:44:07.055 --> 02:44:08.536]  How many trips were cancelled?
[02:44:08.536 --> 02:44:18.722]  What's the damage in terms of not only the vacation industry and the travel industry, but what's the damage overall to international business?
[02:44:18.722 --> 02:44:20.624]  Mexico has just about been shut down.
[02:44:21.542 --> 02:44:26.714]  I'm anticipating the very next thing we're going to see is that we need economic aid to Mexico.
[02:44:26.714 --> 02:44:29.340]  Suddenly, Mexico is going to become our responsibility.
[02:44:29.878 --> 02:44:33.800]  To have some kind of repayment to Mexico for the economic program.
[02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:34.701]  Already happened.
[02:44:34.701 --> 02:44:35.321]  Already happened.
[02:44:35.321 --> 02:44:42.465]  They're saying 47 billion IMF SDRs, the first money out of the new global currency.
[02:44:42.465 --> 02:44:47.768]  For those that don't know, you won't see these SDRs floating around at McDonald's or at your bank.
[02:44:47.768 --> 02:44:50.909]  These are interbank lending, governmental lending.
[02:44:50.909 --> 02:44:55.872]  47 billion SDRs already being drawn on by Mexico and talk
[02:44:56.352 --> 02:44:59.275]  Well, there you go.
[02:44:59.275 --> 02:45:08.243]  See, this also, the International Monetary Fund with these SDRs, I've been reporting on that extensively.
[02:45:08.243 --> 02:45:10.665]  It's also going to be very expensive.
[02:45:10.665 --> 02:45:19.973]  I'm reporting on it because this is the new international currency that China wants to replace the dollar as a standard of foreign exchange reserve.
[02:45:19.973 --> 02:45:22.656]  Now, they can be, if the SDRs can be used
[02:45:23.508 --> 02:45:32.131]  In Mexico, to handle the economic damage done by the swine flu, and there's no... That wasn't what China was proposing.
[02:45:32.131 --> 02:45:48.795]  But I see here, even Bloomberg is reporting, and has been reporting since April 28, that Mexico will draw $47 billion line of credit from the IMF on these SDRs to handle the swine flu.
[02:45:48.795 --> 02:45:49.796]  So, there you are.
[02:45:49.796 --> 02:45:50.676]  I mean, this is the...
[02:45:51.465 --> 02:46:03.128]  You know, there's an economic agenda here which advances the use of the International Monetary Fund as being an alternative to the World Bank for creating a new world currency.
[02:46:03.128 --> 02:46:05.328]  So there's a lot of agendas here.
[02:46:05.328 --> 02:46:18.671]  What's clear is if you look at just the number of illnesses and fatalities, they are so minimal that the cost should be going back on the Obama administration for having scared everyone
[02:46:19.597 --> 02:46:32.647]  And the fact that that's not happening just shows how convincingly this agenda of fear can be put forward even when there's no reaction, there's no disease, there's no like a less than a normal flu.
[02:46:32.647 --> 02:46:33.688]  It's inconsequential.
[02:46:34.190 --> 02:46:38.615]  So from the globalist perspective, Dr. Corsi, we have passed the test.
[02:46:38.615 --> 02:46:46.604]  The fear-mongering from something that killed thousands of times less what a regular run-of-the-mill flu does.
[02:46:46.604 --> 02:46:47.004]  Literally.
[02:46:47.004 --> 02:46:52.490]  We're talking conservatively 250,000 people die a year according to the World Health Organization.
[02:46:52.490 --> 02:46:53.771]  Globally, sometimes as much as 500,000.
[02:46:55.273 --> 02:46:59.315]  Now, if you go back to the old pandemics, 40 million in one year with the swine flu.
[02:46:59.315 --> 02:47:05.998]  But, in a normal year, a quarter million people die from the regular flu.
[02:47:05.998 --> 02:47:13.041]  This thing has killed literally one one-thousandth of a regular year, probably.
[02:47:13.041 --> 02:47:15.042]  And, meanwhile, they act like it was the end of the world.
[02:47:15.042 --> 02:47:18.483]  We've got to have global government, forced inoculations, lockdown U.S.
[02:47:18.483 --> 02:47:18.844]  cities.
[02:47:19.864 --> 02:47:21.405]  But the borders stay wide open.
[02:47:21.405 --> 02:47:23.726]  None of this makes any sense.
[02:47:23.726 --> 02:47:26.567]  So I guess we've passed the test, according to the Globalist.
[02:47:26.567 --> 02:47:29.969]  We are ready to really give up all of our liberty.
[02:47:29.969 --> 02:47:40.794]  If we'll give up all of our liberty for a fake flu, imagine if somebody in government, inside the New World Order, releases something real, Dr. Corsi.
[02:47:40.794 --> 02:47:46.617]  Well, the next time this happens, it's going to have to be... The public is just not going to react immediately.
[02:47:47.341 --> 02:48:01.527]  These kind of warnings, although these warnings are put out in a way that is very frightening, they're very frightening, and people immediately become, you know, they flash to plague ideas or the 1918 influenza.
[02:48:01.527 --> 02:48:05.609]  We have not had a pandemic since 1918.
[02:48:05.609 --> 02:48:13.472]  Even the SARS outbreak out of China was minor in terms of the world population or in terms of the number of people who were sick.
[02:48:13.959 --> 02:48:16.040]  This is not 1918.
[02:48:16.040 --> 02:48:19.021]  People are much more effectively inoculated.
[02:48:19.021 --> 02:48:22.963]  They're much more effectively exposed to flus.
[02:48:22.963 --> 02:48:35.968]  And I have believed from the beginning and suspected from the beginning that these avian and swine and other flus are largely a scare and a hoax, which has no basis in medical reality.
[02:48:35.968 --> 02:48:37.369]  I don't see any basis for it.
[02:48:37.944 --> 02:48:42.445]  Except to sell vaccines and antivirals and to set up police.
[02:48:42.445 --> 02:48:58.169]  To get new power grabs that governments can do on a transnational, international basis where the World Health Organization is more credible now than the UN because they're somehow or other the authorities.
[02:48:58.169 --> 02:49:06.171]  I don't see that the UN is going to protect Americans, not when the border is wide open and it's clear that the disease is
[02:49:07.937 --> 02:49:15.079]  The hypothesis is the disease comes from Mexico and it's transmitted person to person and yet the border is kept wide open.
[02:49:15.079 --> 02:49:17.299]  It makes absolutely no sense at all.
[02:49:17.299 --> 02:49:18.799]  Well, Doc, let's expand on that.
[02:49:18.799 --> 02:49:21.140]  There's got to be another explanation, Alex.
[02:49:21.140 --> 02:49:21.660]  Absolutely.
[02:49:21.660 --> 02:49:23.600]  Well, Doc, I mean, take the UN.
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:24.400]  You know how it works.
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:29.782]  For those that don't know how it works, the UN has its General Assembly that really doesn't have the power.
[02:49:29.782 --> 02:49:33.022]  And then you have the G8 within it that really do have the power.
[02:49:33.022 --> 02:49:36.443]  But then different subunits of the UN structure
[02:49:37.544 --> 02:49:46.272]  Uh, like, uh, the World Health Organization is quasi-private, and if you go research it, most of its funding is Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:49:46.272 --> 02:49:55.381]  They're eugenicists, they're globalists, they're population reductionists, uh, climate change, uh, you know, pushers of this new religion, and they brag it's a new religion.
[02:49:55.381 --> 02:49:57.644]  They say the public needs one.
[02:49:57.644 --> 02:49:59.426]  Uh, so, when you look at the
[02:50:00.026 --> 02:50:05.349]  Well, there's no doubt that the UN is right at the center of this, and it's a power grab on behalf of the UN.
[02:50:05.349 --> 02:50:13.954]  The UN is probably the last organization in the world I'd want to be involved if there really were a worldwide health epidemic.
[02:50:29.003 --> 02:50:29.684]  Because the U.N.
[02:50:29.684 --> 02:50:36.848]  would not necessarily make any decisions that would be in favor of protecting health of Americans.
[02:50:36.848 --> 02:50:38.729]  The perspective of the U.N.
[02:50:38.729 --> 02:50:43.633]  is worldwide and it has its own agenda, which is to grab power.
[02:50:43.633 --> 02:50:44.273]  Absolutely!
[02:50:44.273 --> 02:50:45.394]  I don't think the U.N.
[02:50:45.394 --> 02:50:50.577]  has ever made decisions within these various organizations where the primary interest is U.S.
[02:50:50.577 --> 02:50:51.958]  national security or U.S.
[02:50:51.958 --> 02:50:53.179]  economic or health security.
[02:50:53.678 --> 02:50:54.679]  Alright Doc, stay there.
[02:50:54.679 --> 02:50:58.303]  Final segment with Dr. Jerome Corsi, writes for WorldNetDaily.com.
[02:50:58.303 --> 02:50:59.844]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[02:51:01.636 --> 02:51:04.718]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:51:04.718 --> 02:51:10.243]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:51:10.243 --> 02:51:15.967]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:51:15.967 --> 02:51:17.449]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:51:17.449 --> 02:51:26.456]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:51:26.756 --> 02:51:28.598]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[02:51:28.598 --> 02:51:32.801]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[02:51:32.801 --> 02:51:37.825]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[02:51:37.825 --> 02:51:41.668]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[02:51:41.668 --> 02:51:42.769]  Keep it natural.
[02:51:42.769 --> 02:51:46.913]  Call Calbin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[02:51:51.136 --> 02:51:55.718]  Try Cal Bend Pure Soaps, and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[02:51:55.718 --> 02:52:01.881]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[02:52:01.881 --> 02:52:07.123]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:52:07.685 --> 02:52:15.270]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[02:52:15.270 --> 02:52:21.814]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:52:21.814 --> 02:52:23.815]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:52:23.815 --> 02:52:26.336]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:52:26.336 --> 02:52:37.303]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[02:52:37.896 --> 02:52:39.577]  It's not about left or right.
[02:52:39.577 --> 02:52:41.418]  It's about a one-world government.
[02:52:41.418 --> 02:52:48.341]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[02:52:56.605 --> 02:52:58.186]  The Obama Deception.
[02:52:58.186 --> 02:52:59.367]  The people strike back.
[02:53:01.830 --> 02:53:07.333]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[02:53:07.333 --> 02:53:08.114]  and the world.
[02:53:08.114 --> 02:53:11.996]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[02:53:11.996 --> 02:53:18.480]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:20.521]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[02:53:20.521 --> 02:53:28.466]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[02:53:28.726 --> 02:53:33.431]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[02:53:33.431 --> 02:53:39.256]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[02:53:39.256 --> 02:53:41.438]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[02:53:41.438 --> 02:53:45.122]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you, free of charge.

[02:53:53.570 --> 02:54:02.938]  Dr. Corsi, a hot-button issue with you because you've been attacked in the national media by President Obama just for even coming on this wicked radio show and talking about
[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:30.050]  The facts that sometimes governments do stage events or allow events to take place like the Gulf of Tonkin and things.
[02:54:30.050 --> 02:54:34.076]  We've now had a bunch of mainstream talk show hosts including Michael Savage.
[02:54:35.758 --> 02:54:45.384]  We've had Alan Keyes come out, and we can play the clip, saying they're concerned Obama will stage a terror attack or some type of other disaster.
[02:54:45.384 --> 02:54:47.565]  Ron Paul has said that here on the show.
[02:54:47.565 --> 02:54:50.687]  In case you haven't heard Michael Savage, let me just play a clip of this right now.
[02:54:50.687 --> 02:54:52.668]  Here's Michael Savage about a month ago.
[02:54:52.668 --> 02:54:54.409]  Now I'll make another prediction.
[02:54:54.409 --> 02:55:02.134]  I predict that very soon Obama will create a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag fire.
[02:55:02.134 --> 02:55:03.335]  I don't know what form it will take.
[02:55:03.911 --> 02:55:19.837]  But I believe that once the minions are seen for what they are, Rahm Emanuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country of some kind, and they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during the Civil War, when civilian suspects were arrested without warrant.
[02:55:20.547 --> 02:55:24.168]  I will tell you as I sit here, I fear that every night as I go to sleep.
[02:55:24.168 --> 02:55:28.210]  I put nothing past these agitators who have suddenly seen... Alright, let's stop right there.
[02:55:28.210 --> 02:55:43.094]  I mean, if you look at the military buildup, the police state, all of this, I mean, the federal reports that came out, Dr. Courtsey, saying the number one threat are veterans and gun owners that were terrorists, and the whole Homeland Security system was built for American patriots.
[02:55:43.094 --> 02:55:45.455]  What do you think about what Savage and others are saying?
[02:55:45.455 --> 02:55:47.676]  Well, it's a very frightening scenario, and I...
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:56:05.853]  What I know is that the military apparatus, the emergency powers of the presidency, through these Homeland Security and National Security Directives that President Bush put in place, now all available to President Obama, give an unprecedented level of authority for the U.S.
[02:56:05.853 --> 02:56:09.316]  military to be involved in domestic emergencies.
[02:56:09.316 --> 02:56:17.002]  And what this recent swine flu, I think hysteria, proves is that the American people will accept
[02:56:17.774 --> 02:56:27.822]  Any level of government control and military involvement, if the people are scared into thinking there's a health threat of a major proportion.
[02:56:27.822 --> 02:56:39.891]  Now, that we could get this far, this much news, this much attention, this much shutdown of society, when there's been no illness at all, indicates to me that this has been a politically contrived hysteria.
[02:56:40.816 --> 02:56:44.318]  That there's no basis for it in the medical reality.
[02:56:44.318 --> 02:56:56.486]  And yet very few people are holding the Obama administration to task for saying why all the alarmism, when in fact the reality was that this disease was inconsequential.
[02:56:57.105 --> 02:57:04.970]  Also, Doctor, there's a lot of blaming the American people that got upset and scared instead of the administration and the World Health Organization.
[02:57:04.970 --> 02:57:09.633]  You don't blame the people when you yell fire in a theater and they get up and start running out.
[02:57:09.633 --> 02:57:11.494]  You blame the guy that yelled fire, don't you?
[02:57:11.494 --> 02:57:12.734]  Well, absolutely.
[02:57:12.734 --> 02:57:25.082]  And the hysteria that was created, President Obama coming on television, repeatedly discussing this at nationally televised press conferences, making an issue of Janet Napolitano,
[02:57:25.700 --> 02:57:29.101]  Coming out with repeated press conferences, nationally televised.
[02:57:29.101 --> 02:57:41.023]  I mean, there has to be a basis of thousands of people sick and dying before any of this hysteria is in any way proportionate to the government's out-of-control response.
[02:57:41.023 --> 02:57:43.344]  And the government needs to be held accountable for this.
[02:57:43.344 --> 02:57:47.204]  And the government says, oh, we need to press the alarm button.
[02:57:47.204 --> 02:57:55.366]  No, just pressing the alarm button to show that it can produce a compliant population ready to submit to government and military authority
[02:57:56.104 --> 02:58:09.092]  is not justification enough for scaring this many people, scaring the entire population of the United States, and demonstrating that no one would object even when the border was kept wide open, which makes no sense whatsoever.
[02:58:09.092 --> 02:58:23.901]  So, you know, if the... if the powers that be want to see that the American people are already conditioned to accept martial law and continental or international control of a health emergency, this scare over swine flu proves the case.
[02:58:26.227 --> 02:58:26.988]  Absolutely.
[02:58:26.988 --> 02:58:30.230]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:58:30.230 --> 02:58:32.112]  Got a new book coming out soon.
[02:58:32.112 --> 02:58:34.434]  Look forward to having you on about that, sir.
[02:58:34.434 --> 02:58:35.615]  The America for Sale.
[02:58:35.615 --> 02:58:37.717]  It will be out in October.
[02:58:37.717 --> 02:58:38.617]  All right.
[02:58:38.617 --> 02:58:43.281]  Thank you so much, Dr. Corsi.
[02:58:43.281 --> 02:58:45.903]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.903 --> 02:58:48.866]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.360 --> 02:58:53.062]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.062 --> 02:58:57.807]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.807 --> 02:59:00.751]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.751 --> 02:59:03.814]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.814 --> 02:59:09.661]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.881 --> 02:59:13.124]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:13.124 --> 02:59:20.111]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:20.111 --> 02:59:23.394]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:23.394 --> 02:59:25.076]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go to efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:28.539 --> 02:59:34.784]  Visit efoodsdirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, pre-stride, dehydrated foods they have to offer.

[02:59:39.907 --> 02:59:40.548]  Take action today.
[02:59:40.548 --> 02:59:42.529]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:54.082 --> 02:59:56.484]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.484 --> 03:00:02.750]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:02.750 --> 03:00:08.835]  Okay, coming up in the next segment, I'm gonna go ahead and break down the GPS situation.
[03:00:19.875 --> 03:00:21.096]  This is a huge issue.
[03:00:21.096 --> 03:00:33.370]  People keep calling me for weeks and weeks and weeks saying, is it true that they have a GPS, that the census is going out GPSing people's front doors?
[03:00:33.370 --> 03:00:37.315]  Well, I already knew they were, but I googled it, and sure enough, there's hundreds of news articles.
[03:00:37.315 --> 03:00:39.277]  I've printed a few of them, where it's themed.
[03:00:41.158 --> 03:00:46.019]  Well, there's a lot more to the story.
[03:00:46.019 --> 03:00:50.600]  Not just the fact that it's going on, but you want the back story, the full picture.
[03:00:50.600 --> 03:00:57.281]  We will cover it, coming up in the next segment.
[03:00:57.281 --> 03:01:01.242]  We're also going to get a quick five minute report or so from Mexico City.
[03:01:01.242 --> 03:01:04.863]  There's a YouTube reporter I think has done a pretty good job out there.
[03:01:04.863 --> 03:01:09.124]  George for title is his YouTube channel name.
[03:01:10.486 --> 03:01:22.935]  We'll get a report from him down there, what he's been witnessing as well, but I do want to encourage the listeners and viewers of this show, at least one plug here while we're doing the radio program today.
[03:01:22.935 --> 03:01:29.659]  I don't want to call it my YouTube channel.
[03:01:29.659 --> 03:01:34.723]  The Alex Jones Channel was set up by a listener about a year and a half ago named Dave.
[03:01:35.956 --> 03:01:40.198]  And the thing had gotten 40,000 subscribers and tens of millions of views.
[03:01:40.198 --> 03:01:47.482]  I mean, it was getting... Last week, I counted it up, it had like a million plus views in one week with the different videos.
[03:01:47.482 --> 03:01:52.144]  Mainly of this radio show and when we stream live at PrisonPlanet.tv, he was grabbing it from there.
[03:01:52.144 --> 03:02:03.930]  There are a lot of other channels, there's scores of channels that post my videos, but that was one of the channels we linked to, and because it was called the Alex Jones Channel, folks thought that that was my channel, so they subscribed to it.
[03:02:06.587 --> 03:02:17.440]  There is a channel called The Info Warrior because they kept threatening him to suspend his account but never really telling him why when it's just my radio show that's on there.
[03:02:17.440 --> 03:02:24.047]  And then whenever we had shown the Pittsburgh shooter was actually
[03:02:25.709 --> 03:02:29.431]  Attacking me and didn't like me and the news was saying he was a fan of mine.
[03:02:29.431 --> 03:02:33.312]  We showed the front page of the newspaper and the newspaper filed a complaint.
[03:02:33.312 --> 03:02:35.553]  And they said, one more thing and you're out.
[03:02:35.553 --> 03:02:36.314]  Now that's free speech.
[03:02:36.314 --> 03:02:40.196]  Well, the New York Times has an article and they put it up on the nightly news.
[03:02:40.196 --> 03:02:42.737]  They don't have to go get permission to show it on the nightly news.
[03:02:42.737 --> 03:02:47.099]  I mean, that's how asinine, because we try to keep that channel very clean with copyright stuff.
[03:02:47.979 --> 03:02:50.761]  And they say they've suspended it again for another newspaper article.
[03:02:50.761 --> 03:02:51.241]  You know what?
[03:02:51.241 --> 03:02:53.383]  I'll show newspaper articles all day long.
[03:02:53.383 --> 03:02:57.685]  And somebody's got to start going after these companies for filing these false copyright claims.
[03:02:57.685 --> 03:02:59.366]  Just amazing.
[03:02:59.366 --> 03:03:02.588]  But YouTube is more than happy with its partners.
[03:03:02.588 --> 03:03:08.352]  If you're the atheist or you're some girl in a bikini, you can do whatever you want.
[03:03:08.352 --> 03:03:09.073]  They leave you alone.
[03:03:10.274 --> 03:03:16.636]  We also didn't take Google Ads on there, and they suspend a lot of folks that don't take their Google Ads.
[03:03:16.636 --> 03:03:20.738]  You know, if you don't opt in to having ads all over your videos, they suspend you.
[03:03:20.738 --> 03:03:24.599]  Maybe we should do what they want and make the Info Warrior take their stupid ads.
[03:03:24.599 --> 03:03:26.300]  I don't know.
[03:03:26.300 --> 03:03:28.940]  That's the backup channel we started a few months ago.
[03:03:28.940 --> 03:03:31.261]  If you want to subscribe, pull up the Info Warrior.
[03:03:31.261 --> 03:03:35.723]  Of course, all the enemies will try to go file complaints on it and get it taken down, but that's...
[03:03:36.684 --> 03:03:37.684]  Yeah, YouTube.
[03:03:37.684 --> 03:03:41.886]  And people say, well, why are you still on YouTube if they keep suspending you and cheating you and screwing you?
[03:03:41.886 --> 03:03:43.526]  Because that's where the people are.
[03:03:43.526 --> 03:03:46.347]  It's the number three website in the world.
[03:03:46.347 --> 03:03:53.210]  We can post one of my videos on BlipTV or LiveLeak or something else and it might, you know, get a thousand viewers.
[03:03:53.210 --> 03:03:56.451]  We're, you know, but you, in a week.
[03:03:56.451 --> 03:03:59.192]  We post something on there, it gets on average about twenty thousand.
[03:03:59.192 --> 03:04:01.473]  And everybody else is posting our stuff and
[03:04:02.393 --> 03:04:11.218]  In the market of ideas, in the marketplace of supposed digital democracy, we are absolute king daddies of YouTube and Google Video.
[03:04:11.218 --> 03:04:13.919]  You know, Endgame, number one on Google.
[03:04:13.919 --> 03:04:17.000]  Loose Change Final Cut, number one on Google over and over again.
[03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:21.443]  America Freedom to Fascism, separate film, number one on Google, on and on and on.
[03:04:21.443 --> 03:04:23.364]  Truth Rising, number one on Google.
[03:04:23.364 --> 03:04:24.944]  Obama Deception, number one on Google.
[03:04:24.944 --> 03:04:29.467]  So they just took the counters off and took the top hundred off their front page and nobody even knows about it anymore.
[03:04:29.467 --> 03:04:31.668]  So we go on YouTube, we become number one there.
[03:04:32.984 --> 03:04:36.286]  And they come in and do whatever they can to suspend us and knock us out.
[03:04:36.286 --> 03:04:48.515]  So I just tell folks, go absolutely crazy, post our videos and stuff everywhere, make videos about their censorship, and ask folks, what is it about Alex Jones they don't want you to see?
[03:04:48.515 --> 03:04:50.776]  Why is it we're number one every time?
[03:04:50.776 --> 03:04:53.458]  And why is it they knock us off and cheat?
[03:04:53.458 --> 03:05:01.264]  It's just like a race car race, we keep beating them, so Google and YouTube and go put plastic explosives in our race car, we're going down the road 200 miles an hour and we explode!
[03:05:03.939 --> 03:05:11.066]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[03:05:11.066 --> 03:05:26.962]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[03:05:27.262 --> 03:05:32.647]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[03:05:32.647 --> 03:05:39.152]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[03:05:39.152 --> 03:05:43.056]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[03:05:43.056 --> 03:05:45.738]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[03:05:45.738 --> 03:05:51.103]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[03:05:51.423 --> 03:05:54.085]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:05:54.085 --> 03:05:56.306]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[03:05:56.306 --> 03:05:58.807]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[03:05:58.807 --> 03:06:04.230]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[03:06:04.230 --> 03:06:10.054]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:06:10.054 --> 03:06:17.018]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:06:17.617 --> 03:06:24.203]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:06:24.203 --> 03:06:26.184]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:06:26.184 --> 03:06:28.686]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:06:28.686 --> 03:06:40.256]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:06:40.256 --> 03:06:41.938]  It's not about left or right.
[03:06:41.938 --> 03:06:43.299]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:06:43.777 --> 03:06:50.682]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:06:58.949 --> 03:07:00.530]  The Obama Deception.
[03:07:00.530 --> 03:07:01.711]  The people strike back.
[03:07:03.769 --> 03:07:06.232]  Hi, this is Peter Kronschnabel with Midas Resources.
[03:07:06.232 --> 03:07:10.036]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation is on the rise.
[03:07:10.036 --> 03:07:12.860]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[03:07:12.860 --> 03:07:20.068]  As the economy continues to deteriorate due to corporate greed and government intervention, more people will lose their jobs and worse, their life savings.
[03:07:20.188 --> 03:07:20.909]  We're good to go.
[03:07:36.647 --> 03:07:40.791]  If you've been thinking about investing in the physical possession of precious metals, I can help.
[03:07:40.791 --> 03:07:45.875]  Call me today, Peter Kranchnovel, at 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:07:45.875 --> 03:07:51.660]  And I will take the time personally to put together a portfolio designed to protect what you've worked so hard for.
[03:07:51.660 --> 03:07:56.104]  Call Peter, 800-686-2237, extension 108.
[03:07:56.104 --> 03:07:58.766]  You've worked hard your whole life, and I want to work hard for you.
[03:07:58.766 --> 03:07:59.006]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:08:01.608 --> 03:08:07.011]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:07.011 --> 03:08:09.292]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:37.692 --> 03:08:46.646]  All right, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm going to break down what's happening, what's really going on right now with the
[03:08:48.487 --> 03:08:52.831]  Census takers at your door getting a GPS reading of your front door.
[03:08:52.831 --> 03:08:59.557]  But just in closing on the Alex Jones Channel being suspended, here is the alternate backup channel.
[03:08:59.557 --> 03:09:05.123]  It is YouTube.com forward slash user forward slash The Info Warrior.
[03:09:06.255 --> 03:09:14.560]  And it has 1,718 subscribers versus the 40-plus thousand, but I never really promoted the Alex Jones Channel because it wasn't our channel.
[03:09:14.560 --> 03:09:16.761]  We had just now started getting involved with it.
[03:09:16.761 --> 03:09:22.024]  So there is the new channel that doesn't just feature our material.
[03:09:22.024 --> 03:09:23.504]  We try to promote everybody on YouTube.
[03:09:23.504 --> 03:09:25.025]  It's getting the truth out.
[03:09:25.025 --> 03:09:27.106]  Great volunteer Dave runs the channel.
[03:09:27.106 --> 03:09:29.367]  Go there and subscribe!
[03:09:29.367 --> 03:09:33.430]  And I would ask listeners out there who do have YouTube channels, enough respect.
[03:09:34.430 --> 03:09:43.035]  Another great channel is the fine folks over at Civilian 37's channel.
[03:09:43.035 --> 03:09:44.796]  I mean, there's so many great channels out there.
[03:09:44.796 --> 03:09:46.897]  I can't give them all credit.
[03:09:46.897 --> 03:09:47.638]  There's just too many.
[03:09:50.538 --> 03:09:57.842]  So we are going to attempt to get folks out there to make videos about the fact that our channel was taken down and sabotaged.
[03:09:57.842 --> 03:10:00.683]  But I want to be clear about all of this.
[03:10:00.683 --> 03:10:07.807]  It isn't just the Alex Jones Channel that was only my material up there that got deep-sixed.
[03:10:08.664 --> 03:10:11.086]  Okay, it wasn't just my channel.
[03:10:11.086 --> 03:10:21.795]  There is a purge going on all over the internet of alternative media and anti-New World Order material, especially on Google Video and YouTube Video.
[03:10:21.795 --> 03:10:22.876]  They're just going in and
[03:10:23.937 --> 03:10:26.139]  Knocking out accounts left and right.
[03:10:26.139 --> 03:10:28.080]  Anything that's anti-establishment.
[03:10:28.080 --> 03:10:32.664]  They're leaving all the bikinis and all the atheists and all the things the system likes.
[03:10:32.664 --> 03:10:34.965]  They only promote that on their main page.
[03:10:34.965 --> 03:10:38.348]  We have videos every week that are number one.
[03:10:38.348 --> 03:10:40.850]  Number one overall or number one in categories.
[03:10:40.850 --> 03:10:42.731]  Nowhere on front pages.
[03:10:42.731 --> 03:10:44.433]  Nowhere on main pages.
[03:10:44.433 --> 03:10:47.815]  They'll have some atheist talking bad about Christians who's literally got 5,000 views.
[03:10:49.076 --> 03:10:51.037]  And then we'll have 300,000 in one day.
[03:10:51.037 --> 03:10:51.698]  He's got 5,000.
[03:10:51.698 --> 03:10:53.939]  He's front page.
[03:10:53.939 --> 03:10:55.320]  And then meanwhile, we're nowhere.
[03:10:55.320 --> 03:10:57.902]  And look, I'm not there attacking the atheists.
[03:10:57.902 --> 03:10:58.963]  He's got his First Amendment.
[03:10:58.963 --> 03:11:02.446]  The point is, do you like the system being rigged for you?
[03:11:02.446 --> 03:11:03.446]  Do you enjoy this?
[03:11:03.446 --> 03:11:05.167]  Do you like this?
[03:11:05.167 --> 03:11:06.368]  It's just totally disgusting.
[03:11:06.368 --> 03:11:09.931]  And I say the atheists because that's all they put on the front page of YouTube.
[03:11:09.931 --> 03:11:13.714]  I mean, the guys that run YouTube just must love the atheist guy because it's him.
[03:11:14.534 --> 03:11:20.199]  And then you've got the TNA all around that and you've got, you know, just all of this.
[03:11:20.199 --> 03:11:20.900]  It's amazing.
[03:11:22.062 --> 03:11:22.903]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:11:22.903 --> 03:11:26.325]  They're not going to keep the truth from breaking out and getting out to the people.
[03:11:26.325 --> 03:11:30.928]  By the way, we're on XM three hours a day starting June 6th.
[03:11:30.928 --> 03:11:32.049]  It's going to be re-aired.
[03:11:32.049 --> 03:11:34.851]  They wanted me live, but it's going to be re-aired, I believe, or it may be live.
[03:11:34.851 --> 03:11:36.772]  They're not quite sure yet, but that's confirmed.
[03:11:36.772 --> 03:11:40.054]  We'll be on XM three hours a day coming up June 6th.
[03:11:40.054 --> 03:11:41.535]  And why is that important?
[03:11:41.535 --> 03:11:43.116]  Because XM reached out to us.
[03:11:43.116 --> 03:11:44.778]  We're not people paying to be on XM.
[03:11:45.558 --> 03:11:52.899]  It's because this show is becoming more and more mainstream, because the truth is becoming more and more mainstream, and people are demanding and asking for that.
[03:11:52.899 --> 03:12:04.021]  So I would ask folks, all the major YouTube channels who we've linked to, who we've promoted, who we've pushed, to please promote and push what we're doing, and the backup channel.
[03:12:04.021 --> 03:12:06.742]  But I almost don't even want to promote our backup, because it'll just suspend that.
[03:12:06.742 --> 03:12:07.982]  But we'll go ahead, whatever.
[03:12:07.982 --> 03:12:09.402]  There's one place to go.
[03:12:09.402 --> 03:12:14.723]  Just please, everybody on your channels, please point out they should subscribe to the Info Warrior Show, that we can do that.
[03:12:15.023 --> 03:12:27.186]  Now, I am going to go to Ted Anderson here for just a few minutes and then I'm going to get into what's really happening with the census takers coming up and getting your GPS reading.
[03:12:27.186 --> 03:12:30.387]  And I want to spend some time on this because it's important.
[03:12:30.387 --> 03:12:37.129]  But first off, we had that lady on last hour whose son says that he was IP spoofed.
[03:12:38.513 --> 03:12:39.473]  And he was at church.
[03:12:39.473 --> 03:12:47.216]  They have witnesses that when this third call of several happened from the family's IP phone.
[03:12:47.216 --> 03:12:49.297]  They had a Skype phone in this case.
[03:12:49.297 --> 03:12:51.538]  But they can spoof any IP phone.
[03:12:51.538 --> 03:12:56.760]  And this has been big news all over the country.
[03:12:56.760 --> 03:12:58.340]  SWAT teams are going to houses.
[03:12:58.340 --> 03:13:05.243]  They'll get a call there's been a whole family murdered or there's a hostage situation or a daycare full of kids has been held hostage and it'll be a daycare.
[03:13:06.465 --> 03:13:17.897]  And the cops show up and nothing's going on because the IP spoofers, they go in, get the IP of the address, they make a fake phone call off that IP, and the SWAT team shows up.
[03:13:17.897 --> 03:13:26.766]  Well that's what happened here and the Feds are arguing in court with this young man charging him under the Patriot Act that he doesn't have any rights and that there's no such thing as IP spoofing.
[03:13:26.766 --> 03:13:28.167]  But if you Google IP spoofing,
[03:13:29.408 --> 03:13:36.189]  You can say criminals have long employed the tactic of masking their true identity from disguises to aliases to caller ID blocking.
[03:13:36.189 --> 03:13:43.831]  And it should come as no surprise that criminals who conduct nefarious activities on networks and computers should employ such techniques.
[03:13:43.831 --> 03:13:45.511]  But it's more than just IP spoofing.
[03:13:45.511 --> 03:13:48.812]  It's this Skype spoofing.
[03:13:48.812 --> 03:13:50.692]  And this IP phone spoofing where they do this.
[03:13:50.692 --> 03:13:52.692]  It's just vicious crime.
[03:13:52.692 --> 03:13:56.453]  You know, sending the police to some family's house and people have been killed.
[03:13:57.628 --> 03:14:02.475]  I mean, I can't believe what scum are out there, but it's this internet culture.
[03:14:02.475 --> 03:14:07.223]  There's the good and the bad and the ugly of the internet, and I love the internet, but this stuff's getting worse and worse.
[03:14:07.223 --> 03:14:10.448]  Okay, I wanted to go ahead now and bring up
[03:14:12.076 --> 03:14:15.099]  Ted Anderson for a few minutes, because gold's up like 17 bucks today.
[03:14:15.099 --> 03:14:21.986]  Last time I checked, silver's up as well, and Ted happens to have gold and silver at the price it was two or three weeks ago.
[03:14:21.986 --> 03:14:24.809]  We're talking 40 bucks less or something.
[03:14:24.809 --> 03:14:31.196]  It's gone up that much, and regardless in this crazy world, China's dumping the dollar, buying gold and silver and copper.
[03:14:31.196 --> 03:14:31.976]  You can Google that.
[03:14:32.837 --> 03:14:36.358]  They're dumping dollars and buying real tangible assets.
[03:14:36.358 --> 03:14:46.281]  And I just think it's important for people to get off the grid and also cash in at least some of their paper dollars in IRA and stocks to hedge their bets in this crazy economy.
[03:14:46.281 --> 03:14:48.762]  And when you do buy gold and silver, it's great to get a good deal on it.
[03:14:48.762 --> 03:14:50.702]  So, Ted Anderson, tell folks about it.
[03:14:50.702 --> 03:14:51.462]  Yeah, sure.
[03:14:51.462 --> 03:14:52.843]  I'll come right up real fast with it.
[03:14:52.843 --> 03:14:59.345]  Of course, when silver was down in there at that $12 level, I was trading those Lakota Nation coins at $17.71.
[03:15:01.178 --> 03:15:02.418]  Now it's over 13.
[03:15:02.418 --> 03:15:04.699]  I still haven't met 1771.
[03:15:04.699 --> 03:15:07.520]  So that's obviously a great buy.
[03:15:07.520 --> 03:15:10.761]  The Franks right now at 214.
[03:15:10.761 --> 03:15:12.461]  Gold, what was it last Friday?
[03:15:12.461 --> 03:15:13.982]  It was about 286.
[03:15:13.982 --> 03:15:17.123]  I'm sorry, 286.
[03:15:17.123 --> 03:15:19.043]  Now it's over $900 an ounce.
[03:15:19.043 --> 03:15:20.403]  Still the same price.
[03:15:20.403 --> 03:15:21.984]  I have those at 214.
[03:15:21.984 --> 03:15:24.525]  The British Sovereigns are still 267.
[03:15:24.525 --> 03:15:25.765]  With gold and silver both up.
[03:15:27.044 --> 03:15:30.186]  And the prices on this stuff is going to go up too.
[03:15:30.186 --> 03:15:35.291]  It's just I've been able to accumulate stuff while the market was lower.
[03:15:35.291 --> 03:15:36.071]  It's summertime.
[03:15:36.071 --> 03:15:39.654]  I have a tendency to be able to buy a little better in the summer.
[03:15:39.654 --> 03:15:41.316]  Fall's coming real fast.
[03:15:41.316 --> 03:15:45.519]  If it's anything like last summer, we're going to have a big rush even in June and July.
[03:15:45.519 --> 03:15:53.666]  With the inflation figures coming out now, there's a much larger threat for inflation now with all that TARP money that came out.
[03:15:54.167 --> 03:15:58.048]  And all the stimulus packages that have been passed.
[03:15:58.048 --> 03:16:05.530]  I was just talking to an investment advisor at ING here on Saturday night, and he was saying it's inflation.
[03:16:05.530 --> 03:16:09.551]  He says he wants to know how he can get involved in the gold and silver market.
[03:16:09.551 --> 03:16:12.831]  And that's what I'm hearing from investment advisors all over the place.
[03:16:12.831 --> 03:16:19.533]  Everybody wants to get in on the gold and IRAs, and how they can get involved with that, and how they can sell physical gold and silver.
[03:16:21.134 --> 03:16:23.335]  It's a big market at this particular time, Alex.
[03:16:23.335 --> 03:16:36.939]  I would really suggest that people take advantage of the fact that the prices are a little softer right now, because before you know it, all that cash that's been created here, the trillions of dollars, it's going to come and flood the economy.
[03:16:36.939 --> 03:16:42.081]  Well, no, mainstream news admits China and the Arabs and everybody else are now dumping dollars.
[03:16:42.081 --> 03:16:46.202]  They've been doing it for two years, but it's accelerating the amount that they've been dumping.
[03:16:47.540 --> 03:16:48.641]  Yeah, it sure has.
[03:16:48.641 --> 03:16:51.383]  And so, you know, and I don't blame him.
[03:16:51.383 --> 03:16:55.085]  If I was China, I would get away from the United States dollar entirely.
[03:16:55.826 --> 03:17:06.708]  When you take a look at what the United States is doing from the perception of another country, they can tell that the United States dollar is being watered down by a whole bunch of new currency.
[03:17:06.708 --> 03:17:08.268]  They can see that happening.
[03:17:08.268 --> 03:17:14.009]  And if you're sitting there outside of this nation, you have no incentive to hold on to that asset.
[03:17:14.009 --> 03:17:15.710]  They would love to get out of their securities.
[03:17:15.710 --> 03:17:19.030]  They've got about 3.3 trillion dollars worth of U.S.
[03:17:19.030 --> 03:17:21.871]  government securities, cash, notes, and so on and so forth.
[03:17:22.341 --> 03:17:24.362]  And they want to liquidate their position.
[03:17:24.362 --> 03:17:30.386]  And they've increased their gold reserves by 76% just within the last year.
[03:17:30.386 --> 03:17:33.808]  So, I mean, obviously the Chinese are looking to get out.
[03:17:33.808 --> 03:17:36.409]  And they were our lender for about the last 10 years.
[03:17:36.409 --> 03:17:40.912]  They're the ones that allowed us to deficit spend and not create inflation at the same time.
[03:17:41.252 --> 03:17:45.497]  Okay, Ted, I want to tell folks the silver you have to offer.
[03:17:45.497 --> 03:17:50.142]  I want to tell people not just the silver you have to offer.
[03:17:50.142 --> 03:17:55.929]  I also want to tell the listeners and viewers out there the particular good deals you've got on gold today.
[03:17:56.331 --> 03:18:02.233]  Yeah, well right now, there's no question about it, if you're looking at gold at all, you should be getting into smaller pieces of gold.
[03:18:02.233 --> 03:18:10.416]  It makes a lot of sense to have fractional pieces of gold, because when the manure hits the fan, you're going to have to spend gold in small increments.
[03:18:10.416 --> 03:18:12.277]  That's why I like that frank coin.
[03:18:12.277 --> 03:18:15.258]  In addition to this, it's at $214.
[03:18:15.258 --> 03:18:20.680]  Now, I went out and I priced it, Alex, at this time, and buying it at today's market right now, that'd be about $225.
[03:18:22.591 --> 03:18:25.674]  For that same coin that you can buy right now at $214.
[03:18:25.674 --> 03:18:27.976]  And why can you buy it right now at $214?
[03:18:27.976 --> 03:18:35.602]  Because I bought it back when the market was lower at this $886 level, and now we're sitting at $900 an ounce.
[03:18:35.602 --> 03:18:37.824]  The same thing holds true for those Silver Lakotas.
[03:18:38.244 --> 03:18:44.433]  Last time I had silver over $13 an ounce, I had these things at $18.50.
[03:18:44.433 --> 03:18:47.517]  Right now I have them at $17.71.
[03:18:47.517 --> 03:18:52.744]  And if you Google that coin, you'll find out that on eBay right now, they're trading from $20 to $25 a piece.
[03:18:54.346 --> 03:18:54.886]  Absolutely.
[03:18:54.886 --> 03:18:57.987]  You cannot beat that deal, and I've actually bought a few of those from you the other day.
[03:18:57.987 --> 03:19:00.128]  So, Ted, give folks the toll-free number.
[03:19:00.128 --> 03:19:01.588]  It's 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237, or MidasResources.com.
[03:19:01.588 --> 03:19:02.828]  This deal will go through tonight.
[03:19:02.828 --> 03:19:05.009]  Again, this deal is available until tonight at midnight, 1-800-686-2237.
[03:19:13.831 --> 03:19:15.933]  6-8-6, 2-3-7.
[03:19:15.933 --> 03:19:18.574]  You cannot beat the deal on those Lakota rounds.
[03:19:18.574 --> 03:19:20.596]  Gorgeous silver coins.
[03:19:20.596 --> 03:19:25.620]  And again, on the gold, you have great deals on the Franks, great deals on the British Sovereigns.
[03:19:25.620 --> 03:19:26.520]  What other gold coins?
[03:19:26.520 --> 03:19:30.023]  Do you still have some of those Buffalos that are so hard to get left?
[03:19:30.023 --> 03:19:33.826]  You know, I mentioned last time that I was on the air, we sold out every single one of them.
[03:19:33.826 --> 03:19:34.886]  We're looking for them.
[03:19:34.886 --> 03:19:36.788]  And when I get them available, we'll make them available.
[03:19:36.788 --> 03:19:38.629]  Anything else you've got that's interesting, Ted?
[03:19:38.629 --> 03:19:39.090]  U.S.
[03:19:39.090 --> 03:19:39.570]  Eagles.
[03:19:39.570 --> 03:19:41.631]  We also have the Canadian Maple Leafs.
[03:19:41.631 --> 03:19:42.392]  I've had a great deal
[03:19:42.895 --> 03:19:49.298]  Now that you've planted your organic garden, how will you keep the bugs away without using toxic chemicals and poisons?
[03:20:10.060 --> 03:20:14.665]  Well, the answer is all natural insecticides from FreshwaterOrganics.com.
[03:20:14.665 --> 03:20:20.652]  These revolutionary insecticides start with the same organic product that we use in FPP to kill parasites.
[03:20:20.652 --> 03:20:28.941]  We then add a small amount of pyrethrin from chrysanthemum flowers and a mild attractant to offer you the most effective insecticide available anywhere.
[03:20:29.261 --> 03:20:32.245]  It can even be applied up to the day of harvest.
[03:20:32.245 --> 03:20:43.097]  Our natural insecticides work in the home, on plants, and in your garden, killing pests mechanically, not with poisons, so pests can't develop an immunity and they won't harm your children or pets.
[03:20:43.097 --> 03:20:46.521]  It's effective against white flies, moths, bedbugs, fleas,
[03:20:46.841 --> 03:20:48.222]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:21:06.653 --> 03:21:12.700]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[03:21:12.700 --> 03:21:13.521]  That's right.
[03:21:13.521 --> 03:21:16.365]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[03:21:16.365 --> 03:21:23.293]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[03:21:23.837 --> 03:21:31.979]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:21:31.979 --> 03:21:37.441]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[03:21:37.441 --> 03:21:43.262]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:43.262 --> 03:21:47.783]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[03:21:47.783 --> 03:21:48.023]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:50.629 --> 03:21:53.111]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[03:21:53.111 --> 03:21:55.614]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:21:55.614 --> 03:21:57.155]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:57.155 --> 03:22:09.928]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:22:09.928 --> 03:22:11.049]  We've got to give them a stake.
[03:22:11.525 --> 03:22:15.788]  In creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:22:15.788 --> 03:22:22.293]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:22:22.293 --> 03:22:24.255]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:22:24.255 --> 03:22:26.717]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:22:26.717 --> 03:22:37.465]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:22:39.910 --> 03:22:41.572]  It's not about left or right.
[03:22:41.572 --> 03:22:43.433]  It's about a one world government.
[03:22:43.433 --> 03:22:50.339]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:22:50.339 --> 03:22:58.606]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:58.606 --> 03:23:00.188]  The Obama Deception.
[03:23:00.188 --> 03:23:01.369]  The people strike back.
[03:23:04.113 --> 03:23:05.274]  You are a rebel.
[03:23:05.274 --> 03:23:06.015]  Admit it.
[03:23:06.015 --> 03:23:08.978]  You refuse to read the directions when assembling a new item.
[03:23:08.978 --> 03:23:11.380]  You won't ask for directions when you're lost.
[03:23:11.380 --> 03:23:15.324]  Once in a while, you drive in the carpool lane with only you in the car.
[03:23:15.324 --> 03:23:16.886]  Your neighbors call you a crackpot.
[03:23:18.387 --> 03:23:19.128]  We're good to go.
[03:23:52.742 --> 03:23:55.543]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are now back live.
[03:23:55.543 --> 03:23:57.364]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[03:24:21.047 --> 03:24:26.629]  I'm going to break down in this segment and a little bit in the next what's really happening with the census workers.
[03:24:26.629 --> 03:24:29.810]  There's several issues here.
[03:24:29.810 --> 03:24:34.291]  They're coming up to people's doors, like the video you see here we're rolling from YouTube.
[03:24:34.291 --> 03:24:41.073]  This has happened to me back ten years ago, nine years ago in the last census, in the year 2000.
[03:24:41.073 --> 03:24:43.694]  And they came to the door and demanded I fill it out.
[03:24:43.694 --> 03:24:45.054]  Actually, my girlfriend filled it out.
[03:24:45.054 --> 03:24:46.215]  She refused.
[03:24:46.215 --> 03:24:49.776]  Later when I was home, they came back and
[03:24:52.236 --> 03:24:53.998]  Banged on the door and I got in a big argument with him.
[03:24:53.998 --> 03:24:56.440]  And I said, look, I'm telling you how many people live here.
[03:24:56.440 --> 03:24:58.381]  Me and my girlfriend, now my wife.
[03:24:58.381 --> 03:24:59.142]  That's who lives here.
[03:24:59.142 --> 03:25:00.743]  That's all I got to answer under U.S.
[03:25:00.743 --> 03:25:01.504]  code.
[03:25:01.504 --> 03:25:02.785]  And I even grabbed the census.
[03:25:02.785 --> 03:25:06.649]  I happened to get one of the American community long form that had 49 questions.
[03:25:08.815 --> 03:25:15.179]  Some businesses and houses got questionnaires that had 100, 200, 300 questions.
[03:25:15.179 --> 03:25:19.421]  Going back from memory, one out of six homes got the 49 question.
[03:25:19.421 --> 03:25:22.963]  So I got the 49 question and it was, what type of toilet do you have?
[03:25:22.963 --> 03:25:24.784]  What type of stocks and bonds do you have?
[03:25:24.784 --> 03:25:27.645]  Then the news reported the other forms people were getting.
[03:25:27.645 --> 03:25:35.069]  Callers were calling about it, but later the news confirmed that, yeah, some people were being asked, what type of stocks and bonds do you have?
[03:25:35.069 --> 03:25:36.450]  Do you own firearms?
[03:25:36.450 --> 03:25:37.551]  If you do, what type?
[03:25:38.553 --> 03:25:41.615]  I mean, big, thick things you were supposed to fill out.
[03:25:41.615 --> 03:25:43.036]  And then I went and looked up the U.S.
[03:25:43.036 --> 03:25:47.658]  Code and federal court rulings, and it said you only have to answer how many people live there.
[03:25:47.658 --> 03:25:52.181]  And that's to decide how many members of Congress your state gets.
[03:25:52.181 --> 03:25:56.704]  Because that is apportioned, how many members of the House of Representatives you get.
[03:25:56.704 --> 03:25:59.886]  The Senate is two per state, but the House is done by population.
[03:25:59.886 --> 03:26:03.568]  That's why some states might have ten members, some states might have three members.
[03:26:03.968 --> 03:26:07.650]  You know, California has the most members because it has the biggest population.
[03:26:07.650 --> 03:26:09.551]  Texas is number two with the most members.
[03:26:09.551 --> 03:26:11.332]  That's done by the census.
[03:26:11.332 --> 03:26:15.674]  And now the feds say, well, we also do it for how much federal money your state gets and things.
[03:26:15.674 --> 03:26:18.396]  But the point is, if you're an axe murderer or a criminal,
[03:26:19.196 --> 03:26:30.523]  And you're caught with a carload full of people you've hacked up with an axe, and it looks like you're guilty, and the women's skin is under your fingernails, and you took Polaroid pictures of their dead bodies, you know, posing with them.
[03:26:30.523 --> 03:26:33.525]  You still don't have to incriminate yourself under the Fifth Amendment.
[03:26:33.525 --> 03:26:34.846]  You don't have to answer questions.
[03:26:34.846 --> 03:26:41.450]  So how then do bureaucrats come with no judge, no jury, no warrant, no indictment, no subpoena,
[03:26:42.665 --> 03:26:47.149]  And they say you must answer our questions under penalty of law.
[03:26:47.149 --> 03:26:50.152]  You must answer our questions or you're going to be arrested.
[03:26:50.152 --> 03:26:58.039]  But if you look at the long forms and the short forms you get, even the short form one has nine questions that everybody gets, and they're saying they're going to expand it.
[03:26:58.039 --> 03:27:01.403]  This GPS-ing is only a warm-up for next year.
[03:27:03.194 --> 03:27:10.843]  And so they are coming out now and saying to everybody that it's the law.
[03:27:10.843 --> 03:27:13.286]  You've got to fill out the question whether it's 9 or 49 or 100 or 200 or 300.
[03:27:13.286 --> 03:27:14.528]  Some businesses get even bigger ones.
[03:27:18.410 --> 03:27:22.874]  They're saying you've got to fill it out, even though you have a Fifth Amendment and a Fourth Amendment right to not do it.
[03:27:22.874 --> 03:27:27.057]  But how they do it is you get the forms, and I covered this on air years ago on local TV.
[03:27:27.057 --> 03:27:30.079]  I haven't gotten one in the mail yet, but if I get the long form, I'll show you.
[03:27:30.079 --> 03:27:31.801]  Even the short form has it.
[03:27:31.801 --> 03:27:36.024]  It'll be a piece of paper, and up in the corner, it'll have the U.S.
[03:27:36.024 --> 03:27:43.330]  Code, and under the law, you've got to do this, and then a dotted line with the nine questions they think they can make you answer.
[03:27:44.710 --> 03:27:46.833]  Which, there's eight too many there.
[03:27:46.833 --> 03:27:50.797]  But then under it, there'll be all these other questions.
[03:27:50.797 --> 03:27:52.479]  So it's a lawyer trick.
[03:27:52.479 --> 03:27:54.802]  And we're already getting these emailed to us.
[03:27:54.802 --> 03:27:55.823]  And this is it.
[03:27:55.823 --> 03:27:56.945]  I've seen them before.
[03:27:56.945 --> 03:27:57.045]  U.S.
[03:27:57.045 --> 03:28:00.048]  Department of Economics and Statistics.
[03:28:01.055 --> 03:28:02.716]  United States Census 2010.
[03:28:02.716 --> 03:28:04.517]  Your answers are confidential.
[03:28:04.517 --> 03:28:07.940]  And it says you're required by law to provide the information requested.
[03:28:07.940 --> 03:28:18.707]  These federal laws are found in United States Code, Title 13, Section 9-141-193-214 and 221, Title 42, Section 210.
[03:28:18.707 --> 03:28:26.912]  Please visit the website census.gov, 2010 Census, and click the Protecting Your Privacy to learn more about the privacy policy and data protection.
[03:28:26.912 --> 03:28:30.835]  Then under it, it says, same thing mine had nine years ago, in a little box,
[03:28:31.436 --> 03:28:39.006]  Respondents are not required to respond to any information collection unless it displays a valid approval number of the management and budget.
[03:28:39.006 --> 03:28:41.109]  Then it gives the code numbers OMB 0607-0809.
[03:28:41.109 --> 03:28:41.590]  See that's only
[03:28:46.246 --> 03:28:48.448]  And you only get this if you ask the question.
[03:28:48.448 --> 03:28:52.891]  It has this little blurb, only this part, on the forms that I've seen at the bottom.
[03:28:52.891 --> 03:28:54.152]  People don't know that, lawyer speak.
[03:28:54.152 --> 03:28:55.133]  It says, it's the law.
[03:28:55.133 --> 03:28:58.996]  It says right here, your answers are confidential, but it's the law.
[03:28:58.996 --> 03:29:00.757]  Punishable by jail time if you don't do this.
[03:29:00.757 --> 03:29:03.359]  So you're like, oh my God, honey, we all fill this out.
[03:29:03.359 --> 03:29:07.983]  Right under it is the asterisk, just like a fraudulent contract, as it is.
[03:29:07.983 --> 03:29:11.666]  Oh, and by the way, you don't have to do this, but you have to know how to go look up U.S.
[03:29:11.666 --> 03:29:12.667]  Code to find that out.
[03:29:14.246 --> 03:29:18.231]  Just like there's no law you gotta take vaccines, but they do the same damn things.
[03:29:18.231 --> 03:29:19.612]  Excuse me folks, I'm getting angry.
[03:29:19.612 --> 03:29:21.395]  They do the very same thing.
[03:29:23.444 --> 03:29:36.069]  They tell you it's the law, you gotta do it, when it's really a regulation and a policy, but then the law says if they try to enforce that policy in public schools to take shots to be there, that by law they have to give you the waiver.
[03:29:36.069 --> 03:29:37.269]  But there's no law to take the shot.
[03:29:37.269 --> 03:29:49.273]  When we come back, I'll tell you the next part of the story, what the census is turning into, and the multi-uses, some of them very draconian, for these census takers at your door with the GPS.
[03:29:49.273 --> 03:29:50.294]  Then we'll go to Mexico City.
[03:29:51.789 --> 03:29:55.722]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.722 --> 03:29:58.411]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.096 --> 03:30:05.798]  Hi, my name is MZ, owner of KSCO in Santa Cruz, California.
[03:30:05.798 --> 03:30:11.802]  And like Alex Jones, I'm passionate about talk radio, that great bastion of freedom of expression for us all.
[03:30:11.802 --> 03:30:25.611]  I'm also passionate about helping people know the joys, benefits, and surprisingly simple methods of becoming entrepreneurs who work for themselves and not as wage slaves for someone else, or even worse, for large companies with no heart and soul, nor loyalty to their employees.
[03:30:25.871 --> 03:30:45.026]  If you are tired of being dependent on others for a living and ready to start owning yourself, loving your work, and setting the sky as the limit for your earning potential, I want you to know about an exciting great business opportunity involving the marketing of healthful dark chocolate that actually helps people lose weight and can help them make money, perhaps lots of it, just by helping us spread the word about this wonderful unique product.
[03:30:45.126 --> 03:30:47.987]  Get on the web and go to chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:30:47.987 --> 03:30:50.167]  That's chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:30:50.167 --> 03:30:51.427]  And check out our opportunity.
[03:30:51.427 --> 03:30:52.788]  You'll know pretty quick if you're interested.
[03:30:52.788 --> 03:30:55.128]  If you are, we will connect with you and get you up and running.
[03:30:55.128 --> 03:30:58.609]  We don't want any money from you and you'll be amazed at how simple this system is.
[03:30:58.609 --> 03:31:02.170]  Remember, chocolate.ownmyself.com.
[03:31:02.170 --> 03:31:07.411]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:31:07.992 --> 03:31:15.558]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:31:15.558 --> 03:31:22.123]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:31:22.123 --> 03:31:24.125]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:31:24.125 --> 03:31:26.647]  He's fudged since day one of this election.
[03:31:26.647 --> 03:31:37.596]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:31:38.203 --> 03:31:39.884]  It's not about left or right.
[03:31:39.884 --> 03:31:41.726]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:31:41.726 --> 03:31:48.651]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:31:48.651 --> 03:31:56.918]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:31:56.918 --> 03:31:58.499]  The Obama Deception.
[03:31:58.499 --> 03:31:59.660]  The people strike back.
[03:32:01.454 --> 03:32:08.679]  You already know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.
[03:32:08.679 --> 03:32:13.222]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:32:13.222 --> 03:32:18.846]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline ingredients.
[03:32:18.846 --> 03:32:26.391]  Using Plasma pH Drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline, to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:32:26.391 --> 03:32:31.274]  Simply put 10 drops per liter of water you drink to raise the pH to the ultimate level.
[03:32:31.754 --> 03:32:37.599]  Alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:32:37.599 --> 03:32:43.403]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline, high pH environment.
[03:32:43.403 --> 03:32:49.347]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[03:32:49.347 --> 03:32:52.129]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[03:32:52.129 --> 03:32:52.870]  Or by calling 269-216-9767.

[03:33:02.023 --> 03:33:02.908]  We're good.
[03:33:13.220 --> 03:33:15.201]  There's a fellow who's got a YouTube channel.
[03:33:15.201 --> 03:33:16.542]  I've seen quite a few of his videos.
[03:33:16.542 --> 03:33:18.123]  I like the work he does.
[03:33:18.123 --> 03:33:24.286]  He went down to Mexico City to get a report from what's happening down there.
[03:33:24.286 --> 03:33:29.870]  We also had Sherry Tenpenny, a doctor who was in Mexico during this was going on, and quite a few other people that have been reporting for us.
[03:33:29.870 --> 03:33:32.311]  So I want to get his perspective coming up in a moment.
[03:33:32.311 --> 03:33:36.573]  He goes by his YouTube handle, George4Title.com.
[03:33:38.134 --> 03:33:42.718]  Or, that's the channel there at YouTube, is George for Title.
[03:33:42.718 --> 03:33:45.381]  Now, I don't know where you'll go if you put a .com on it.
[03:33:45.381 --> 03:33:48.904]  All these websites, all these numbers, so little time to keep track of it all.
[03:33:48.904 --> 03:34:00.314]  Now, I want to finish up with the Census news, then we'll go to George, and then I'm going to go back into the Census and open the phones up in the time we have left here at the show, but just briefly.
[03:34:01.158 --> 03:34:03.782]  And I'll do more on this tomorrow because people are so upset about it.
[03:34:03.782 --> 03:34:08.368]  Maybe we'll dig out some of the old videos I have of myself and others confronting the census takers.
[03:34:08.368 --> 03:34:15.357]  You have a 4th and 5th Amendment right to not have somebody cross your fence, your no trespassing sign, to come on your property
[03:34:16.458 --> 03:34:19.099]  And to demand, to ask, do you have a low flush toilet?
[03:34:19.099 --> 03:34:21.400]  What types of stocks and bonds do you have?
[03:34:21.400 --> 03:34:22.420]  How much money in the bank?
[03:34:22.420 --> 03:34:24.080]  This is in some of the census forms.
[03:34:24.080 --> 03:34:26.561]  They have different ones they give you, but that was on record from the year 2000.
[03:34:26.561 --> 03:34:27.882]  All over the news.
[03:34:27.882 --> 03:34:31.783]  Some census takers in 2000, quote, forced their way into homes.
[03:34:31.783 --> 03:34:35.564]  Others were killed by dogs climbing over fences into private property.
[03:34:35.564 --> 03:34:38.485]  I mean, it's crazy for 12 bucks an hour what these folks do.
[03:34:38.485 --> 03:34:44.807]  I'm not saying all census workers are bad, but the point is they haven't been trained in the Bill of Rights Constitution, and they go around
[03:34:45.507 --> 03:34:49.951]  With these sheets threatening to have people arrested if they don't answer all their questions.
[03:34:49.951 --> 03:34:58.278]  Now I was one of the unlucky people in 2000 to get the long form that a certain amount of households got that had 49 questions.
[03:34:58.278 --> 03:35:00.740]  Other forms ask what type of firearms do you own?
[03:35:00.740 --> 03:35:01.701]  Do you have children?
[03:35:01.701 --> 03:35:02.522]  Are they homeschooled?
[03:35:02.522 --> 03:35:03.323]  Are they public schooled?
[03:35:04.639 --> 03:35:08.322]  Now, ahead of next year's big census, it's already begun, and the feds have said this.
[03:35:08.322 --> 03:35:11.884]  They're just having yearly censuses, trying to use the U.S.
[03:35:11.884 --> 03:35:19.210]  Code, and the Constitution's very, you know, simple thing about enumerate the people for their congressional districts, to demand constant questions.
[03:35:19.750 --> 03:35:28.377]  You know, I guess every morning you'll line up in front of a drill sergeant in front of your house and they'll say, okay, census rules, tell me, you know, in confession, what you dreamed about last night.
[03:35:28.377 --> 03:35:37.584]  I mean, if they can force you to say what type of toilet you've got, how much money you've got in the bank, if you own firearms, if, you know, what you do for a living, then why not make them answer what your dreams are?
[03:35:38.963 --> 03:35:40.324]  No Fifth Amendment.
[03:35:40.324 --> 03:35:42.405]  In fact, pull up the Fifth Amendment for folks on screen.
[03:35:42.405 --> 03:35:43.365]  Fifth Amendment of the U.S.
[03:35:43.365 --> 03:35:45.306]  Constitution and we'll show people.
[03:35:45.306 --> 03:35:47.807]  In fact, I can just read it to people right now here on air.
[03:35:47.807 --> 03:35:50.468]  Let me just go to the Bill of Rights here from my pocket.
[03:35:50.468 --> 03:35:51.188]  Constitution.
[03:35:51.188 --> 03:35:52.369]  Let me go to Article 5.
[03:35:52.369 --> 03:35:59.752]  No person shall be held to answer for capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment of indictment of a grand jury except in cases
[03:36:00.612 --> 03:36:03.094]  Arising in land or naval forces or in the militias.
[03:36:03.094 --> 03:36:04.114]  That's during a war.
[03:36:04.114 --> 03:36:12.119]  When an act of service in time of war or public danger, nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be tried twice to put in double jeopardy of life and limb.
[03:36:12.119 --> 03:36:12.899]  They do that now.
[03:36:12.899 --> 03:36:13.800]  I like that.
[03:36:13.800 --> 03:36:26.007]  Nor shall he be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor to be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.
[03:36:26.007 --> 03:36:29.669]  Which now, under the new London Kelo decision, they say they can take your property
[03:36:29.909 --> 03:36:32.330]  For non-government reasons, without compensation.
[03:36:32.330 --> 03:36:33.290]  So there's the Fifth Amendment.
[03:36:33.290 --> 03:36:37.091]  So, it's illegal and unconstitutional what they're doing, but they send these poor people out.
[03:36:37.091 --> 03:36:46.234]  Now, they admit in the Pahrump Valley Times, the NPR has an article, Census Bureau adopts GPS to find Americans' homes.
[03:36:46.234 --> 03:36:48.695]  So, here are several mainstream news articles.
[03:36:48.695 --> 03:36:54.117]  And I already knew this, but last night, getting ready for this show, I went and I researched both of these.
[03:36:54.117 --> 03:36:58.298]  And then we're going to George for title, who is in Mexico City, YouTube reporter.
[03:36:59.744 --> 03:37:05.865]  Census workers face dogs, guns in verifying addresses.
[03:37:05.865 --> 03:37:12.986]  And it goes on from there to report on all of this.
[03:37:12.986 --> 03:37:26.149]  And it talks about how they're building up for a year from now, this is right now, this is April 17, 2009, and they have a handheld GPS to mark the front door of your house
[03:37:27.193 --> 03:37:36.259]  As part of the next wave of the census when they come and demand that you fill out the long forms, how many guns you own, what, I'm not kidding, this happened last time, we're going to do it this time.
[03:37:36.259 --> 03:37:37.820]  You go to the census website, they say it.
[03:37:37.820 --> 03:37:41.403]  What your stocks and bonds are, what your toilet does, you know, all of this.
[03:37:42.648 --> 03:37:52.233]  So, and then I also have mainstream articles with the ACORN people getting billions in funding, and this new usaservice.org, where they advertise as if it's federal, but it's really private Democratic Party.
[03:37:52.233 --> 03:37:59.916]  They admittedly go around with GPS, marking your home, and whether or not your name and your home, and if you support Obama or not.
[03:37:59.916 --> 03:38:02.457]  And they claim, oh, we're just finding out who Obama supporters are.
[03:38:02.457 --> 03:38:05.419]  Just incredible police state, done like it's no big deal.
[03:38:07.737 --> 03:38:16.643]  So, again, the average census worker just thinks, oh, I'm just confirming the person lives here so we can send the next wave of little Stasi bureaucrat out.
[03:38:16.643 --> 03:38:28.751]  Now, the problem is, they admit that they keep having problems with SWAT teams going to the wrong door, going to the wrong house, or double homes, you know, these homes that are duplexes.
[03:38:29.861 --> 03:38:31.282]  Where they SWAT team the wrong house.
[03:38:31.282 --> 03:38:32.363]  You hear about this all the time.
[03:38:32.363 --> 03:38:46.116]  And if you read in the federal documents, Homeland Security has said, through the census years ago, you can dig this out when you do an article on it, I remember reading it, that they want to discover where everybody lives in America so they know where to send SWAT teams or Homeland Security.
[03:38:46.116 --> 03:38:47.598]  That's then also shared with locals.
[03:38:48.629 --> 03:38:52.574]  They also under Homeland Security have stated they want you to have an ID card to get a job.
[03:38:52.574 --> 03:38:57.900]  But illegal aliens, by the way, are exempt from that under the stimulus package and other things you've noticed.
[03:38:57.900 --> 03:39:00.684]  So they're exempt, but citizens have to.
[03:39:00.684 --> 03:39:01.885]  And they have said that
[03:39:04.376 --> 03:39:11.961]  They want this total control grid over what we do in our everyday lives all across our society.
[03:39:11.961 --> 03:39:17.165]  And so by doing this, they're confirming where you live and what you're doing and that you do live there.
[03:39:17.165 --> 03:39:18.586]  Okay, they're finding out if people move.
[03:39:18.586 --> 03:39:21.107]  They're finding out if people are renting a house that aren't supposed to be.
[03:39:21.107 --> 03:39:24.530]  They're finding out about the underground economy.
[03:39:24.530 --> 03:39:30.314]  And expanding on that, remember that headline, in fact, Google this guys, scoff laws.
[03:39:30.314 --> 03:39:31.255]  Scoff laws
[03:39:32.421 --> 03:39:49.721]  get caught ordering pizzas or for scoff ordering pizzas scofflaws get caught scofflaws somebody that ignores like parking tickets and small things but when you read the article it it says the big three pizza companies deliveries they know when a felon or somebody who the law wants to know where they're at
[03:39:50.478 --> 03:40:09.563]  That your order, when it's entered in the computer, goes through the federal government first, and that the three companies get 25% of the money from any fines or fees or arrest, just from ordering a pizza, to give you an idea how they are tracking you for folks that aren't aware of this.
[03:40:09.563 --> 03:40:12.344]  And I'm just giving you a few little pieces of how massive this is.
[03:40:13.564 --> 03:40:19.509]  With the big surveillance blimps, they put it 90 to 110,000 feet in the atmosphere that they've now announced.
[03:40:19.509 --> 03:40:23.652]  They have ground penetrating radar, face scanners, infrared scanners.
[03:40:23.652 --> 03:40:29.797]  They use ground face scanning cameras off your digital photo to identify, yeah, that's Alex Jones walking down the street.
[03:40:29.797 --> 03:40:33.159]  The blimp then zooms in through integrated systems.
[03:40:33.159 --> 03:40:34.700]  This is all declassified now.
[03:40:35.561 --> 03:40:39.122]  And says, okay, we're going to get the live read right now of his thermal image.
[03:40:39.122 --> 03:40:41.764]  They don't have to send a team out with a scope.
[03:40:41.764 --> 03:40:42.644]  Okay, that's Alex Jones.
[03:40:42.644 --> 03:40:44.985]  Let's get his thermal image to get the reading.
[03:40:44.985 --> 03:40:49.987]  They've already got my face print from my digital photo when I went and got my driver's license and my fingerprint.
[03:40:50.845 --> 03:40:51.486]  Okay.
[03:40:51.486 --> 03:40:57.891]  And then companies that thumbprint and faceprint you to go to the tanning salon or get your school library books or to go to the gym.
[03:40:57.891 --> 03:41:00.933]  Those are all sold to databases, just like the big pizza places.
[03:41:00.933 --> 03:41:02.294]  It's big money.
[03:41:02.294 --> 03:41:05.456]  See, the private corporations lobby for this and work with the police state.
[03:41:05.456 --> 03:41:06.758]  Yeah, the hidden dangers of pizza.
[03:41:07.518 --> 03:41:11.219]  And it says, the extra cheese and pepperoni could give you a way to officials.
[03:41:11.219 --> 03:41:16.281]  And Missouri said they may track scofflaws by monitoring pizza delivery lists.
[03:41:16.281 --> 03:41:22.942]  David Copeland of the State Courts Administration said pizza databases could be used as an untapped resource.
[03:41:22.942 --> 03:41:24.563]  Yeah, that's not out of USA Today.
[03:41:24.563 --> 03:41:26.744]  That's another one about them doing it.
[03:41:26.744 --> 03:41:27.624]  They're already doing it.
[03:41:27.624 --> 03:41:29.024]  That's an article saying they might.
[03:41:29.024 --> 03:41:30.505]  The USA Today admitted they were doing it.
[03:41:30.505 --> 03:41:35.126]  But anyways, to finish up here, but good job finding that, guys.
[03:41:36.650 --> 03:41:42.713]  To finish up, so when we get up here and we talk about, they can send a SWAT team to your door with this.
[03:41:42.713 --> 03:41:44.054]  This is to track and control you.
[03:41:44.054 --> 03:41:45.354]  This is to track and trace you.
[03:41:45.354 --> 03:41:47.035]  This is all admitted.
[03:41:47.035 --> 03:41:50.757]  You walk out front of your house, they know where the GPS reading is, they've got the blimp ready.
[03:41:51.661 --> 03:41:56.668]  And it just takes a scan in a few seconds of your heat resonance, and now it knows where you're at.
[03:41:56.668 --> 03:41:57.749]  They have these over Iraq.
[03:41:57.749 --> 03:41:59.191]  That's the secret weapon.
[03:41:59.191 --> 03:42:01.394]  He said, well, it's not really secret, but I won't write about it in my book.
[03:42:01.394 --> 03:42:04.038]  Everybody said, oh, what's Bob Woodward talking about?
[03:42:04.038 --> 03:42:04.478]  It's this.
[03:42:04.478 --> 03:42:07.522]  It's this technology, MIT Magazine admits it.
[03:42:07.522 --> 03:42:09.024]  So they love to brag about what they've got.
[03:42:09.745 --> 03:42:11.806]  So, that's what all this is about.
[03:42:11.806 --> 03:42:12.827]  Do you own guns?
[03:42:12.827 --> 03:42:13.567]  What are you doing?
[03:42:13.567 --> 03:42:15.048]  Are you an Obama supporter?
[03:42:15.048 --> 03:42:17.050]  They're using this GPS reading.
[03:42:17.050 --> 03:42:21.012]  And I remember talking to people a decade ago in very rural areas in the last census.
[03:42:21.012 --> 03:42:22.673]  This began in 1999.
[03:42:22.673 --> 03:42:26.995]  People in rural areas, we went out and interviewed them in Johnson City and other areas in the Hill Country.
[03:42:26.995 --> 03:42:28.897]  There'd be a log cabin somebody built.
[03:42:29.697 --> 03:42:40.982]  Out on 20 acres they had that nobody even knew about that was for camping and they'd have notices on their door and then they'd be able and they'd catch people there with the satellite images of the house saying, okay, who lives here?
[03:42:40.982 --> 03:42:42.182]  They are tracking everything.
[03:42:42.182 --> 03:42:44.163]  They want to militarily dominate.
[03:42:44.163 --> 03:42:46.604]  That's what the global positioning system is.
[03:42:46.604 --> 03:42:51.426]  With the Pentagon satellites it was designed so they could shoot a cruise missile through your window or down your chimney.
[03:42:51.426 --> 03:42:56.989]  This is a control grid and people are denying that they're even using this for the census right now.
[03:42:57.529 --> 03:43:02.092]  They're even emailing me and saying we're making it up that census workers are at people's doors.
[03:43:02.092 --> 03:43:09.756]  Let me read to you from NPR and then we're going to our guest in Mexico City and the census worker faces dogs, guns to verify addresses.
[03:43:09.756 --> 03:43:10.617]  Pahrump Valley News.
[03:43:11.641 --> 03:43:21.203]  It's still a year before the 2010 Census, but already 60 Census workers have fanned out across southern Nye County, that's in the middle of the desert, Nevada, in an attempt to verify addresses.
[03:43:21.203 --> 03:43:31.244]  But in a sneak preview of some of the thorny situations Census takers could face in Pahrump, the address verification led to a few surprise property owners, including an incident where a gun was pulled.
[03:43:31.244 --> 03:43:33.545]  She was in their backyard and talks about that.
[03:43:33.545 --> 03:43:39.266]  It goes on, they're just driving up, checking the addresses outside, making sure the correct address, and it goes on to say,
[03:43:40.430 --> 03:43:41.653]  I want to read the whole article.
[03:43:41.653 --> 03:43:46.163]  Our guest is talking, I mean waiting, but it says in here that
[03:43:48.049 --> 03:43:49.730]  They're using GPS to track them.
[03:43:49.730 --> 03:43:53.872]  So I'll read that after we get a report from Mexico City.
[03:43:53.872 --> 03:43:58.295]  I guess he contacted us, or my producer pointed it out, I'm not sure, but I'd already seen his video.
[03:43:58.295 --> 03:44:02.077]  And up there it said George for title.
[03:44:02.077 --> 03:44:09.181]  And the only news he really reported from YouTube in Mexico City was that they were locking it down where food and water couldn't get in.
[03:44:09.181 --> 03:44:12.824]  People were demonstrating, so riot cops were going off to deal with that.
[03:44:12.824 --> 03:44:14.785]  So reporting from Mexico City,
[03:44:15.846 --> 03:44:23.893]  Hey Alex, pleasure to be on the show.
[03:44:23.893 --> 03:44:34.843]  Right now I'm on the streets of Mexico City and just what I'm seeing is a lot of people with masks on and the funny thing you're really seeing a lot down here is people are wearing the masks but
[03:44:35.424 --> 03:44:40.952]  They're either wearing them incorrectly, like over their necks or over their heads, and their nose are still exposed.
[03:44:40.952 --> 03:44:44.557]  And if you actually look at the mask that the governments give out here, they don't protect you at all.
[03:44:44.557 --> 03:44:45.579]  I got a video of it.
[03:44:45.579 --> 03:44:49.885]  They're just really thin material that wouldn't protect you from anything.
[03:44:49.885 --> 03:44:50.626]  It's a visual...
[03:44:52.288 --> 03:44:55.532]  Uh, art type of hysteria.
[03:44:55.532 --> 03:44:56.893]  It's all part of the play acting.
[03:44:56.893 --> 03:44:59.836]  Like when cops wear black uniforms, they act more aggressively.
[03:44:59.836 --> 03:45:03.600]  Or when Elmer Fudd puts on a hunting cap, he starts acting like a hunter.
[03:45:03.600 --> 03:45:08.404]  Uh, you know, or when a woman puts on, you know, lingerie, she on average becomes more sexually aroused.
[03:45:08.404 --> 03:45:09.866]  This is all psychology.
[03:45:10.706 --> 03:45:12.547]  Okay, explain to folks what you've seen.
[03:45:12.547 --> 03:45:18.968]  A lot of folks have seen the video of the masked paramilitary police marching off.
[03:45:18.968 --> 03:45:26.350]  To me, that's the story, is that it's the non-story and they're using this as a way to crack down on the population with the military.
[03:45:26.350 --> 03:45:29.211]  That's what a lot of Mexicans calling us for Mexico City have said.
[03:45:30.560 --> 03:45:34.202]  What I've seen here is a lot of military vehicles in the streets.
[03:45:34.202 --> 03:45:38.984]  We've even seen, uh, uh, patrol actually loading up.
[03:45:38.984 --> 03:45:43.186]  And the weird thing about it is they were loading up, it looked like, with their own personal gear.
[03:45:43.186 --> 03:45:47.828]  I mean, they had colored, uh, backpacks, and it was just really weird.
[03:45:47.828 --> 03:45:53.510]  I got a lot of, uh, information on my YouTube channel that they said, hey, this is a weird type of operation.
[03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:55.932]  They have riot gear, but they don't even have any weapons.
[03:45:55.932 --> 03:45:58.913]  And it looks like they have their own personal clothing.
[03:45:59.386 --> 03:46:01.788]  And their own personal tents that they're taking with them.
[03:46:01.788 --> 03:46:07.111]  So that was really strange and we got really close to that vehicle that was loading up for that operation.
[03:46:07.111 --> 03:46:11.014]  We had one gentleman, one of the soldiers that was actually approaching us.
[03:46:11.014 --> 03:46:15.637]  My taxi cab driver that I'm using is really, really smart guy.
[03:46:15.637 --> 03:46:18.099]  He took off right away and we were able to be, you know, okay.
[03:46:19.534 --> 03:46:20.194]  Absolutely.
[03:46:20.194 --> 03:46:24.077]  I've been shaken down more than once by Mexican police and troops in Mexico.
[03:46:24.077 --> 03:46:25.338]  Very corrupt.
[03:46:25.338 --> 03:46:27.419]  So, I mean, just an overall view.
[03:46:27.419 --> 03:46:28.840]  Are people still panicked?
[03:46:28.840 --> 03:46:33.682]  Are the streets still somewhat empty compared to what usually that mega city is, the biggest city in the world?
[03:46:33.682 --> 03:46:37.325]  When I first got here Friday, it was literally a ghost town.
[03:46:37.325 --> 03:46:45.369]  I had a hotel in downtown Mexico City, and I could swear to you, I was like one of three people that were staying at this hotel.
[03:46:45.369 --> 03:46:48.051]  That's the biggest story I'm getting down here.
[03:46:48.878 --> 03:46:54.000]  It's hard to imagine 20 to 25 million people on almost total lockdown.
[03:46:54.000 --> 03:46:55.821]  You can't get into a restaurant.
[03:46:55.821 --> 03:46:57.522]  I mean, they got special rules.
[03:46:57.522 --> 03:46:59.662]  If you, you know, you can only get takeout.
[03:46:59.662 --> 03:47:02.324]  You know, the taxi cab drivers have to wear gloves.
[03:47:02.324 --> 03:47:03.464]  They have to wear masks.
[03:47:03.464 --> 03:47:05.625]  I mean, there's all these regulations.
[03:47:05.625 --> 03:47:12.788]  And what I'm getting from this whole experience is, it's just the sheer authoritarianism that the people are willing to accept down here.
[03:47:12.788 --> 03:47:13.048]  It's just,
[03:47:13.647 --> 03:47:14.588]  Well, Mexico Applied!
[03:47:41.624 --> 03:47:54.274]  Yeah, Mexico applied to go under IMF global currency, SDRs, Reuters and AP reported and they're the first major nation to do this and so in a way it's like a bank holidays going on.
[03:47:54.274 --> 03:47:57.978]  We know this is a beta test for as revolution brews to a
[03:47:58.758 --> 03:48:00.781]  A paramount point.
[03:48:00.781 --> 03:48:02.183]  They know how to kill it.
[03:48:02.183 --> 03:48:06.630]  Kill these flashpoints of revolution with a fake flu drill.
[03:48:06.630 --> 03:48:12.519]  And I believe, and so does Dr. Jerome Corsi and many other experts that have studied this, that that's why they came out and said, end of the world.
[03:48:12.519 --> 03:48:14.362]  You know, people have to take this serious, you know.
[03:48:14.842 --> 03:48:19.725]  Uh, you know, the people getting scared in the theater when somebody yells fire, they're not the bad people, it's the guy that yelled fire.
[03:48:19.725 --> 03:48:23.207]  And the government came out and fear-mongered and did this, so I understand why folks got concerned.
[03:48:23.207 --> 03:48:28.429]  I got concerned, many others did, but my instinct from the day one was, this may be real, but I think it's a hoax.
[03:48:28.429 --> 03:48:42.317]  We had a lot of different perspectives here on air, but I always said, I believe it's a hoax to practice martial law as a smokescreen for a takeover, and the Mexicans calling for Mexico City and others, they all concurred and said that's what they were saying before they even heard me on the show saying it.
[03:48:42.317 --> 03:48:43.718]  So a lot of people are saying that.
[03:48:44.698 --> 03:48:52.483]  The Mexicans you're talking to though, they are saying, you're confirming, that they think this is all just a cover for police state?
[03:48:52.483 --> 03:49:07.132]  I've probably personally interviewed or talked to about 30 to 40 Mexican citizens, and they are, I would say the majority of them, 70% of them, know that this is basically fake.
[03:49:07.132 --> 03:49:12.295]  I don't know how to say it in any other words, but they know something's going on.
[03:49:12.295 --> 03:49:12.835]  And the 30% that do
[03:49:14.275 --> 03:49:14.675]  I think so.
[03:49:22.642 --> 03:49:24.104]  You know, they just go along, but...
[03:49:45.285 --> 03:49:51.547]  Aren't fooled, waking up the other 30% that have some chance of waking up and not being idiots.
[03:49:51.547 --> 03:50:01.489]  That other 30%, they'd march into death camps, you know, they'd run down into pits and be shot in the back of the head, you know, just like we saw in Nazi Germany.
[03:50:01.489 --> 03:50:02.890]  They will do what they're told.
[03:50:03.590 --> 03:50:07.852]  Well let me tell you something Alex, when I headed into Mexico, I crossed the Tijuana border,
[03:50:33.308 --> 03:50:34.229]  You're really scared.
[03:50:34.229 --> 03:50:39.632]  You're worried that you're going to catch the virus just from all the media propaganda that you're being fed.
[03:50:39.632 --> 03:50:44.755]  But as I went into Mexico City and I'm walking around, you know, it just hits you.
[03:50:44.755 --> 03:50:45.455]  It hit me one night.
[03:50:47.406 --> 03:50:49.327]  Three o'clock in the morning, I said, you know what?
[03:50:49.327 --> 03:50:51.167]  This is total lies.
[03:50:51.167 --> 03:50:52.847]  This is total fakes.
[03:50:52.847 --> 03:50:54.588]  You know what I did on one of my videos?
[03:50:54.588 --> 03:50:58.929]  I actually videotaped me going inside of an emergency room.
[03:50:58.929 --> 03:50:59.509]  Stop there.
[03:50:59.509 --> 03:50:59.949]  Stop there.
[03:50:59.949 --> 03:51:01.310]  I want to hear about this final segment.
[03:51:01.310 --> 03:51:01.950]  Stay with us.
[03:51:01.950 --> 03:51:05.391]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[03:51:05.391 --> 03:51:09.632]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[03:51:09.632 --> 03:51:10.492]  Utopia, Texas.
[03:51:10.832 --> 03:51:11.332]  I think so.
[03:51:27.379 --> 03:51:28.019]  We're good to go.

[03:51:55.776 --> 03:51:59.158]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.368 --> 03:52:14.252]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:14.252 --> 03:52:20.756]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.756 --> 03:52:22.737]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.737 --> 03:52:25.199]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:25.199 --> 03:52:36.086]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[03:52:38.371 --> 03:52:40.031]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.031 --> 03:52:41.892]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:41.892 --> 03:52:48.813]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[03:52:58.636 --> 03:52:59.836]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.451 --> 03:53:07.416]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground up shells?
[03:53:07.416 --> 03:53:08.176]  Think about that.
[03:53:08.176 --> 03:53:11.299]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[03:53:11.299 --> 03:53:14.521]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[03:53:14.521 --> 03:53:18.304]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Choose for Health.
[03:53:18.644 --> 03:53:24.772]  A delicious tasting chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables and antioxidants.

[03:53:30.599 --> 03:53:31.780]  The choice is yours.
[03:53:31.780 --> 03:53:37.387]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.

[03:54:02.644 --> 03:54:07.687]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:08.439 --> 03:54:10.560]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:54:25.964 --> 03:54:30.867]  I want to tell you about one final sponsor, then we're going to go back to our guest and close out this report.
[03:54:30.867 --> 03:54:34.489]  If he's still in Mexico City, we'll get another report from him tomorrow.
[03:54:34.489 --> 03:54:37.110]  George Ford Titles, the name of his YouTube channel.
[03:54:37.110 --> 03:54:40.612]  Let me guess, you work in title work with real estate or something.
[03:54:40.612 --> 03:54:41.733]  We'll find out in a minute.
[03:54:41.733 --> 03:54:43.374]  But I've seen his videos before, really good stuff.
[03:54:43.934 --> 03:54:48.196]  I want to tell you about Ecoloblue, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[03:54:48.196 --> 03:54:49.657]  Atmospheric water generator for the home.
[03:54:49.657 --> 03:54:52.178]  Pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store.
[03:54:52.178 --> 03:54:53.619]  Pure, clean water without the fluoride.
[03:54:53.619 --> 03:54:55.700]  Unlimited water from the humidity in the air.
[03:54:55.700 --> 03:54:57.660]  Know exactly what you're drinking.
[03:54:57.660 --> 03:55:00.662]  Machine produces up to 28 liters of water in 24 hours.
[03:55:00.662 --> 03:55:04.284]  The generated water is passed through seven filters, including reverse osmosis carbon.
[03:55:04.284 --> 03:55:05.024]  Simple to use.
[03:55:05.024 --> 03:55:06.965]  No chemicals, pollutants, or toxins.
[03:55:06.965 --> 03:55:08.245]  Neutral pH.
[03:55:08.245 --> 03:55:09.766]  Your own source of clean water.
[03:55:12.185 --> 03:55:15.147]  Grabs out of the air, then it goes through seven different filtration systems.
[03:55:15.147 --> 03:55:17.588]  Great folks, great products.
[03:55:17.588 --> 03:55:17.888]  It is 1-800-691-6043.
[03:55:17.888 --> 03:55:18.048]  1-800-691-6043.
[03:55:18.048 --> 03:55:18.449]  Or Ecoloblue.com.
[03:55:18.449 --> 03:55:19.269]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[03:55:30.096 --> 03:55:31.357]  Also, I've done the whole show today.
[03:55:31.357 --> 03:55:36.401]  I don't think I've plugged the Obama deception and Truth Rising and Terror Storm and Endgame.
[03:55:36.401 --> 03:55:38.483]  These aren't just great films on high-quality DVD.
[03:55:38.483 --> 03:55:40.785]  It's how we support our operation here.
[03:55:40.785 --> 03:55:42.147]  And there's so much we need to do.
[03:55:42.147 --> 03:55:44.429]  We need the financial support to continue what we're doing.
[03:55:44.429 --> 03:55:48.692]  So please visit the online video and bookstore at Infowars.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:55:48.692 --> 03:55:50.094]  We also have 11 or is it 12 new t-shirts
[03:55:54.898 --> 03:56:03.681]  You know, big Don't Tread On Me t-shirts, and Come And Take It t-shirts, and 1776 t-shirts, and Minutemen t-shirts, so the spirit is...
[03:56:05.046 --> 03:56:06.967]  And we just lost our guest from Mexico.
[03:56:06.967 --> 03:56:07.447]  Well, that's fine.
[03:56:07.447 --> 03:56:12.350]  We can get him back on tomorrow, because I know lines are bad down there.
[03:56:12.350 --> 03:56:17.033]  But regardless, it just confirms what we already knew going on down there.
[03:56:17.033 --> 03:56:18.253]  Maybe you can try to call him back.
[03:56:18.253 --> 03:56:22.536]  We have three minutes left, so we can get that final comment from him about going into the emergency room.
[03:56:22.536 --> 03:56:25.197]  Or folks, you just go to the channel and check it out.
[03:56:25.197 --> 03:56:28.939]  We've linked some of those videos up on InfoWars.com.
[03:56:28.939 --> 03:56:29.520]  Promote those.
[03:56:30.834 --> 03:56:31.014]  I don't
[03:56:47.933 --> 03:57:16.568]  Is that our YouTube channel, when I say our YouTube, Dave, a fan made it, but people thought it was the Alex Jones Channel, and that became a controversy, it wasn't an Alex Jones Channel, so I said, okay, I'll get involved with it and promote it, and so we'd been involved a little bit more with it, posting a few links and things, and we posted a few videos up there, some of the Obama deception videos, like the director, Alex Jones, reaches out to Obama supporters and things like that, and it was getting about a million views a week on average, conservatively.
[03:57:17.168 --> 03:57:20.651]  I mean, really a powerful channel, really waking people up.
[03:57:20.651 --> 03:57:28.258]  Just that channel alone, I would say was probably about five percent out of a hundred of who we reach.
[03:57:28.258 --> 03:57:31.120]  And it's now been shut down for no reason.
[03:57:31.120 --> 03:57:39.667]  I'm asking folks to please promote the show, PrisonPlanet.tv and other videos that we do, because this is a blow against truth and freedom.
[03:57:39.667 --> 03:57:42.209]  But we will never give up, we will never give in.
[03:57:43.130 --> 03:57:45.211]  And this only makes us stronger.
[03:57:45.211 --> 03:57:53.514]  There is a purge going on of all Patriot videos right now, so people need to be focused on that and expose it and fight back and ask, why is this information censored?
[03:57:53.514 --> 03:57:58.636]  George, we'll have you back up tomorrow, but at the last minute of the show, you said you went into this emergency room in Mexico City.
[03:57:58.636 --> 03:57:59.956]  Go ahead.
[03:57:59.956 --> 03:58:04.598]  Yeah, just being around here, Alex, and seeing what's going on, it just hits you like a brick wall.
[03:58:04.598 --> 03:58:08.079]  It's like total authoritarianism, total lies.
[03:58:08.624 --> 03:58:12.285]  And I said, you know what, instead of doing reports outside of these hospitals, I'm gonna prove a point.
[03:58:12.285 --> 03:58:16.786]  So I took off my mask, and I went inside of these emergency rooms, and I talked to the people.
[03:58:16.786 --> 03:58:24.107]  I even saw a doctor and asked her about, uh, the influenza, as they call it, or the padical, as they call it.
[03:58:24.107 --> 03:58:25.348]  You know, and you know what?
[03:58:25.348 --> 03:58:28.288]  I just was trying to make a point, and the point is, it's all lies.
[03:58:28.288 --> 03:58:32.129]  It's all a big mind-control situation here.
[03:58:32.429 --> 03:58:36.192]  Listen, we'll get a report from you tomorrow, George.
[03:58:36.192 --> 03:58:38.194]  I appreciate you doing it, you've got a lot of courage.
[03:58:38.194 --> 03:58:38.954]  God bless you.
[03:58:38.954 --> 03:58:42.777]  Retransmission starts now, absolutely jam-packed on the internet restreams, mfallwars.com.
[03:58:42.777 --> 03:58:43.918]  Good job, crew.

[03:58:51.718 --> 03:58:53.399]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.399 --> 03:58:58.140]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:58.140 --> 03:59:01.102]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:01.102 --> 03:59:04.143]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:04.143 --> 03:59:09.985]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you simply prepare.
[03:59:10.225 --> 03:59:13.468]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:13.468 --> 03:59:20.453]  You know efoodsdirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[03:59:20.453 --> 03:59:23.736]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[03:59:23.736 --> 03:59:23.996]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[03:59:23.996 --> 03:59:25.417]  Or on the web, go to efoodsdirect.com.
