[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:31.640]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.640 --> 00:40.960]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome it is the fourth day of May 2009 on this
[00:40.960 --> 00:45.320]  Monday edition of the worldwide broadcast against tyranny as we attempt
[00:45.320 --> 00:49.160]  to wake the people up to the private global corporate takeover of every
[00:49.160 --> 00:54.840]  sovereign nation on earth and the new tyrannical system that our once free
[00:54.840 --> 01:00.560]  countries is being replaced with that is what we are fighting here there can be
[01:00.560 --> 01:06.440]  no doubt that tyranny is growing across the planet that a world government is
[01:06.440 --> 01:11.280]  being set up for the administrative convenience of a group of international
[01:11.280 --> 01:17.360]  bankers in the words of David Rockefeller we're going to have wide open
[01:17.360 --> 01:23.440]  phones today and then Dr. Jerome Corsi will be joining us in the third hour to
[01:23.440 --> 01:29.640]  cover the angle of the swine flu scare which now more and more appears to be a
[01:29.640 --> 01:36.000]  hoax as we said it probably would be day one the international angle to all of
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.680]  this how they openly have had drills through the SPP North American Union
[01:40.680 --> 01:47.360]  body to use the threat of and real both real pandemics and the threat of
[01:47.360 --> 01:51.760]  pandemics is a pretext to bring in the North American Union you notice they
[01:51.760 --> 01:54.960]  talked about and are still talking about locking down the US cities locking
[01:54.960 --> 02:01.320]  down some hospitals and hotels that's already happening but quarantining
[02:01.320 --> 02:07.520]  whole city states of need be but the border stays wide open how ridiculous
[02:07.520 --> 02:10.280]  is that all the main threats coming out of Mexico we're gonna leave the border
[02:10.280 --> 02:13.800]  wide open and leave all the airplanes flying but then we're gonna have troops
[02:13.800 --> 02:18.440]  patrolling America and locking down cities so that is coming up with Dr.
[02:18.440 --> 02:22.920]  Jerome Corsi in about two hours and we've got a 15 minute interview coming
[02:22.920 --> 02:27.480]  up with a lady whose 16 year old son is being held under terrorism charges in
[02:27.480 --> 02:32.040]  the Patriot Act because somebody over his Skype phone lines supposedly made a
[02:32.040 --> 02:42.680]  bomb threat now there is a practice that has several different names of making
[02:42.680 --> 02:53.000]  fake threats bomb threats on innocent people in fact as I sit here I had told
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.880]  Rob do last week my producer that hey look at this guy getting charged with the
[02:59.880 --> 03:03.920]  Patriot Act the mother says he was at church with them at the time that this
[03:03.920 --> 03:10.320]  happened and I had even forgotten to make the point that I've seen a bunch of
[03:10.320 --> 03:14.160]  mainstream news articles and I can't remember the term I've got to Google it
[03:14.160 --> 03:21.440]  during the break where people call in fake 911 calls to people's homes
[03:21.440 --> 03:25.960]  claiming there's a domestic dispute someone's been killed there's a
[03:25.960 --> 03:30.960]  hostage situation and then the police show up and it's done over IP phone or
[03:30.960 --> 03:35.920]  Skype and there's all these horrible SWAT team incidents where people get shot
[03:35.920 --> 03:41.840]  officers get shot citizens pull guns and get shot and I forget what that's
[03:41.840 --> 03:45.480]  called what is that called it just popped in my head that this is her defense
[03:45.480 --> 03:50.120]  and the article where it was claiming that she was saying it was a fake call
[03:50.120 --> 03:54.920]  hacked over the Skype didn't point out when I was reading it last week this is
[03:54.920 --> 04:00.120]  widespread and going on all over the place and the government's using this as
[04:00.120 --> 04:07.080]  an excuse to make all IP phones traced and trackable as well in fact Rob do no
[04:07.080 --> 04:11.880]  we can't hear me out there and well somebody flag Rob anyways that's a
[04:11.880 --> 04:15.520]  side issue that's gonna for about 15 minutes here's the deal we've got massive
[04:15.520 --> 04:22.320]  new developments on the swine flu front which is not really swine flu it's a
[04:22.320 --> 04:26.280]  laboratory flu the question is how dangerous is it huge new developments
[04:26.280 --> 04:30.440]  the World Health Organization is fear mongering saying that the flu will be
[04:30.440 --> 04:36.640]  back with a vengeance is the headline huge developments on the second
[04:36.640 --> 04:40.400]  amendment front not just the new treaty to ban reloading and importation or

[08:19.840 --> 08:23.400]  alex jones
[08:29.680 --> 08:35.640]  all right for nine days since last Saturday Saturday before last we've been
[08:35.640 --> 08:41.520]  on air saying that we believe this virus is manufactured so that it'll scare
[08:41.520 --> 08:45.920]  local virologist and people that look at it because that's what's normally
[08:45.920 --> 08:50.400]  dangerous about a new flu if it wildly mutates this thing isn't wildly mutated
[08:50.400 --> 08:55.960]  it is a fusion of four different viruses completely new with no pedigree
[08:55.960 --> 09:00.880]  anywhere in the world and they have massive surveillance private and public
[09:00.880 --> 09:05.920]  institutional governmental you name it studying flu viruses every year this
[09:05.920 --> 09:10.560]  thing came out of the wrong hemisphere wrong time of year absolutely
[09:10.560 --> 09:14.680]  engineered to scare the death out of people and we kept saying since last
[09:14.680 --> 09:19.520]  Saturday that we only that there are only a few deaths so why were governments
[09:19.520 --> 09:24.240]  hyping this so much when normal flu kills between two hundred thousand and
[09:24.240 --> 09:29.760]  half a million people each year you can google global flu deaths yearly you'll
[09:29.760 --> 09:32.520]  find two hundred and fifty thousand four hundred thousand five hundred thousand
[09:32.520 --> 09:36.480]  on average it's two hundred and fifty something thousand just like the United
[09:36.480 --> 09:40.120]  States on average they say it's thirty six thousand but I've talked to doctors
[09:40.120 --> 09:45.760]  and many others say that that number is hyped again of an old person dies or
[09:45.760 --> 09:48.440]  something like that they'll just mark on there that flu killed them if they
[09:48.440 --> 09:51.600]  happen to have flew when they died
[09:52.040 --> 09:57.280]  now that said there are a lot of big developments on this front because we
[09:57.280 --> 10:02.400]  continued to break down the fact that do they know something we don't know could
[10:02.400 --> 10:08.800]  this mutate into a more deadly virulent form is that why they're so concerned do
[10:08.800 --> 10:13.640]  they know something we don't know this thing is clearly engineered the
[10:13.640 --> 10:18.720]  globalist are stated eugenicists in the nineteen ninety-six United Nations
[10:18.720 --> 10:21.960]  biological diversity assessments saying they want to get rid of at least eighty
[10:21.960 --> 10:26.120]  percent of us state Department of Random two hundred saying it rid of half of us
[10:26.120 --> 10:30.760]  that's from seventy three to the numbers grow all the different club of Rome
[10:30.760 --> 10:33.880]  statements CFR statements I'm going to read some of those on air today by the
[10:33.880 --> 10:39.480]  way so we'd have to be crazy out of our minds to not take these eugenicists
[10:39.480 --> 10:44.320]  serious plus the last few months we've seen an unprecedented build-up of
[10:44.320 --> 10:51.800]  drilling for mass graves for influenza in the u.s. in Europe the federal
[10:51.800 --> 10:55.480]  government in FEMA contacting emergency management systems and other nations
[10:55.480 --> 11:00.280]  contacting private cemetery saying we believe a huge influenza is coming can
[11:00.280 --> 11:05.080]  you bury a hundred thousand people on your back forty we gave you the secret
[11:05.080 --> 11:11.960]  documents with the prison systems in the country getting ready for huge flows we
[11:11.960 --> 11:17.320]  gave you the secret documents from the new york state with the feds directing
[11:17.320 --> 11:23.040]  them in private with the bureau of cemeteries prepare for mass flu we of
[11:23.040 --> 11:27.880]  course and I called and confirmed here with the daily newscaster reported with
[11:27.880 --> 11:33.560]  a emergency manager in indiana on the border with chicago saying FEMA came
[11:33.560 --> 11:38.240]  out and said harden your government buildings for basically them to be
[11:38.240 --> 11:43.360]  attacked and where can we have mass graves for millions dead out of chicago
[11:43.360 --> 11:50.680]  all of this and then FEMA drill set for april and may nationwide going back six
[11:50.680 --> 11:55.800]  months ago when we learned of them for april and may for mass grave mass
[11:55.800 --> 12:00.280]  inoculations breakdown of society the clergy response team's documents we
[12:00.280 --> 12:04.680]  broke a year and a half before it was mainstream news hiring sixteen thousand
[12:04.680 --> 12:07.440]  then doubling to twenty six thousand since then we haven't gotten any new
[12:07.440 --> 12:12.960]  documents but it was doubling in 2008 it was to double again so who knows what
[12:12.960 --> 12:17.600]  the numbers are in regard fifty five thousand people in private industry and
[12:17.600 --> 12:22.880]  quote infrastructure key infrastructure positions for infrastructure protection
[12:22.880 --> 12:27.080]  with shoot to kill orders under martial law any of their employees that don't
[12:27.080 --> 12:33.400]  follow federal orders what is all of this why is all of this happening where
[12:33.400 --> 12:38.240]  they're going to use a flu for the cover for martial law is this a beta test of
[12:38.240 --> 12:44.520]  federalizing local county cities and states setting up the mass death tense
[12:44.520 --> 12:49.640]  the that the pandemic tense i was watching cnn and fox this morning same
[12:49.640 --> 12:53.880]  script oh my gosh they've set up the influence of tense they're saying it
[12:53.880 --> 12:58.200]  can mutate it could be killing us all in the fall and winter exactly what i
[12:58.200 --> 13:03.000]  foresaw them doing last saturday night on record i know how they operate as a
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.200]  this is probably a beta test but that is the true horror of this is that we
[13:08.200 --> 13:13.720]  continue to be right here and now they're saying oh yes the fall the winner
[13:13.720 --> 13:17.840]  mass death we're getting ready for you know just five six days ago was the
[13:17.840 --> 13:22.680]  greatest threat to face humanity tens of millions could die get ready the worst
[13:22.680 --> 13:27.840]  threatened ninety years absolute bad women i kept saying folks why are they
[13:27.840 --> 13:33.800]  hyping this for just a few deaths what is the truth then we got secret state of
[13:33.800 --> 13:37.480]  texas documents with saying we were level four but really at level five going
[13:37.480 --> 13:41.320]  to level six then it came out days later mainstream media they were planning
[13:41.320 --> 13:46.200]  that are they lying to locals to hype them up for fear are they lying to the
[13:46.200 --> 13:49.760]  local and stabular to get them to roll over for federal international control
[13:49.760 --> 13:54.240]  we know they're under you in control that's now confirmed under the executive
[13:54.240 --> 13:58.400]  orders under the agreements were under treaty agreement with the world health
[13:58.400 --> 14:02.760]  organization that's why with naftan gap are not allowed to use the stimulus
[14:02.760 --> 14:08.480]  money here domestically because naftan gap doesn't allow that it doesn't allow
[14:08.480 --> 14:13.960]  only bids in the u.s. just like we're under world health organization control
[14:13.960 --> 14:19.480]  and you nisco control that bush signed us back on to that's why they can the
[14:19.480 --> 14:22.840]  people of europe can be eighty five percent against the euro they can't get
[14:22.840 --> 14:29.680]  out of it their criminal government signed them over to a treaty dr. Jerome
[14:29.680 --> 14:33.120]  coursey coming up in an hour and forty five minutes to break that down with us
[14:33.120 --> 14:40.680]  today so we have all of this going on all of this happening and it is a beta
[14:40.680 --> 14:47.880]  test for the total takeover and you dovetail that with college football
[14:47.880 --> 14:56.120]  games high school football games hockey championships car shows bayfest in

[18:00.040 --> 18:03.640]  in nineteen ninety nine who would not let me have the tape
[18:03.640 --> 18:06.920]  as he said they would identify that it was him that shot it
[18:06.920 --> 18:09.480]  at an air force base in san antonio
[18:09.480 --> 18:11.720]  where they had over two hundred role players

[24:07.600 --> 24:14.600]  alex jones on the gc and radio network
[24:20.600 --> 24:23.920]  all right on the legislative front coming up obama supports treaty outlawing
[24:23.920 --> 24:26.920]  gun possession
[24:26.920 --> 24:31.080]  and that's how lou dobs and a u.s senator put it because you really read it
[24:31.080 --> 24:33.760]  it does more than just ban black powder
[24:33.760 --> 24:36.960]  it does more than just ban any type of changing barrels are doing maintenance
[24:36.960 --> 24:38.040]  on a firearm
[24:38.040 --> 24:39.880]  or importing or exporting
[24:39.880 --> 24:43.200]  if you read the actual treaty it that gets into the unit here agreements
[24:43.200 --> 24:45.920]  because it is a u n laws are so corrupt they say
[24:45.920 --> 24:48.000]  all we pass this law and then
[24:48.000 --> 24:49.440]  all of these other
[24:49.440 --> 24:52.760]  treaties we pass in the past for these conventions we passed
[24:52.760 --> 24:53.960]  also apply
[24:53.960 --> 24:57.080]  so you gotta go read those were it says all civilian ownership of any type of
[24:57.080 --> 24:57.840]  firearm
[24:57.840 --> 24:59.200]  will be banned
[24:59.200 --> 25:02.560]  because there has to be a legitimate power monopoly of the state
[25:02.560 --> 25:04.040]  that's a quote by the way
[25:04.040 --> 25:07.920]  so just uh... here's obama after saying oh don't worry i don't want your guns
[25:07.920 --> 25:10.680]  i don't want to do a few things a few reasonable things
[25:10.680 --> 25:15.840]  those few things are completely taken your guns
[25:15.840 --> 25:19.480]  it's not enough that they both sold by the way i've got the uh... new headline
[25:19.480 --> 25:20.520]  uh... here
[25:20.520 --> 25:24.400]  bloomberg is now reporting over fourteen trillion so it was twelve
[25:24.400 --> 25:26.520]  point seven i'm sorry
[25:26.520 --> 25:31.040]  and now it's fourteen plus trillion
[25:31.040 --> 25:34.520]  so just uh... it's getting absolutely amazing that is
[25:34.520 --> 25:35.960]  coming
[25:35.960 --> 25:40.480]  as well some good legislative news update hr twelve oh seven
[25:40.480 --> 25:43.960]  now has up to one hundred and twelve cosponsors
[25:43.960 --> 25:47.840]  to imagine this
[25:47.840 --> 25:50.600]  actually audit the private
[25:50.600 --> 25:53.320]  run for profit federal reserve that says it's above the law

[26:13.360 --> 26:16.960]  they grabbed out of the rooms at four a m and swat team style so there would be
[26:16.960 --> 26:18.840]  immediate attention so they wouldn't resist
[26:18.840 --> 26:21.400]  so they'd all be asleep
[26:21.400 --> 26:24.560]  like a Soviet Union they come at four a m they come here at four a m
[26:24.560 --> 26:25.560]  all part of freedom

[26:35.280 --> 26:39.560]  also swine flu may merge with other flu viruses cdc says
[26:39.560 --> 26:40.560]  so see
[26:40.560 --> 26:45.320]  and the genetic engineers and virologist doctors that we've talked to and had on
[26:45.320 --> 26:49.160]  say that's what's interesting about this is it's made to mutate quickly
[26:49.160 --> 26:52.440]  and it's such a novel super virus it's super
[26:52.440 --> 26:56.960]  in how it's totally new and and and and and mixed
[26:56.960 --> 27:00.920]  it has all these wild connectors on it so we can just tie into any genetics at
[27:00.920 --> 27:01.640]  once
[27:01.640 --> 27:04.240]  some amazing seed virus
[27:04.240 --> 27:05.280]  so uh...
[27:05.280 --> 27:08.040]  are they gonna release some new mutation of this and claim it naturally
[27:08.040 --> 27:08.760]  happened
[27:08.760 --> 27:11.080]  is this the setup the gear up
[27:11.080 --> 27:15.120]  as they are i don't know folks but their whole architectures built around
[27:15.120 --> 27:16.320]  using a
[27:16.320 --> 27:18.680]  influenza
[27:18.680 --> 27:22.000]  as their cover for total martial law takeover
[27:22.000 --> 27:25.360]  and think of what a perfect plan it is as they implode the economy as they take
[27:25.360 --> 27:27.320]  over as they announced the bank of the world
[27:27.320 --> 27:32.120]  right as resistance begins to mount this happens getting all the real news

[34:53.120 --> 34:56.600]  kill yeah that's a song about a mother in front of the
[34:56.600 --> 35:00.080]  baby noise make a spirit make a white house for a year after
[35:00.080 --> 35:05.120]  year who lost her son protesting against war maybe an actor
[35:05.120 --> 35:08.480]  in a plot that might be all that you got all right let me go
[35:08.480 --> 35:12.720]  ahead and break down the news I went through the latest at
[35:12.720 --> 35:18.240]  least the headlines with the flu I'm gonna go back over that
[35:18.240 --> 35:24.000]  then I have the financial news that the swine flu hysteria has
[35:24.000 --> 35:31.680]  been used as a cover form as that intensifies let's go ahead
[35:31.680 --> 35:34.720]  and cover there's so much important news today I'm almost
[35:34.720 --> 35:38.880]  in overload mode let's go ahead and cover the martial law
[35:38.880 --> 35:42.880]  pass it first because all of this has to be connected in
[35:42.880 --> 35:47.440]  together all of this has to be taken as a whole if you look
[35:47.440 --> 35:51.280]  at one part of it uh whereas it's unconstitutional police
[35:51.280 --> 35:55.120]  state thuggish still to to fully understand you better look
[35:55.120 --> 36:00.800]  at it as one big piece and then analyze the subparts you know
[36:00.800 --> 36:04.400]  we get up here on air and we say you're after a year the
[36:04.400 --> 36:06.960]  bankers in their own documents and here are their documents
[36:06.960 --> 36:11.200]  A B C D E F G right down the line stating they're gonna
[36:11.200 --> 36:14.000]  bankrupt the world economy using fiat debt bubbles they
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.720]  create then they're going to make the world come to the
[36:16.720 --> 36:19.600]  very same bankers with the stroke of the pen will bail the
[36:19.600 --> 36:22.720]  planet out with a new bank of the world that sets the
[36:22.720 --> 36:26.080]  currency rates the interest rates controls the nations and
[36:26.080 --> 36:29.200]  that you pay your carbon taxes too and now that has been
[36:29.200 --> 36:32.160]  announced everywhere they've been pushing for it for more
[36:32.160 --> 36:38.320]  than a hundred years Cecil Rhodes the British Empire they
[36:38.320 --> 36:40.960]  publish scores of books bragging about how they would do it
[36:40.960 --> 36:44.880]  and we're now under this system is it the British people know
[36:44.880 --> 36:48.880]  it's that model of control and the Bank of England setting up
[36:48.880 --> 36:53.520]  the Federal Reserve here in the United States and so I get
[36:53.520 --> 36:56.720]  up on air and I say listen I went to an urban warfare drill
[36:56.720 --> 36:59.680]  here's the video where they're training to take your guns
[36:59.680 --> 37:02.640]  and people see the video and it's so shocking and so
[37:02.640 --> 37:05.280]  unbelievable as they witness Marines training to kill
[37:05.280 --> 37:10.000]  Americans and take our guns that people in 1998 99 would
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.440]  simply say it's fake those aren't real Marines and I'd say
[37:13.440 --> 37:15.680]  wait a minute on the video we show you the local news
[37:15.680 --> 37:20.720]  articles on top of it and they go no that's fake too
[37:20.720 --> 37:24.400]  now that was the level of denial that people were 10 11 12
[37:24.400 --> 37:30.560]  years ago I would go interview a police chief in south Texas
[37:30.560 --> 37:33.280]  Jack D. Compton saying yeah foreign troops for here doing the
[37:33.280 --> 37:36.560]  drill but we can't tell the locals what they were doing
[37:36.560 --> 37:39.200]  and I'd show an emergency manager saying yeah they admitted to me
[37:39.200 --> 37:42.240]  it's for martial law gun confiscation drill you know
[37:42.240 --> 37:47.200]  Thomas Sanchez Kingsville Texas on video good guy telling you
[37:47.200 --> 37:50.400]  what really happened Chief of Police in San Antonio saying
[37:50.400 --> 37:53.120]  Delta Force came in tried to bribe him and others with big
[37:53.120 --> 37:57.520]  bags of money to work covertly with the police
[37:58.880 --> 38:06.720]  and I showed everybody that over and over and over and over
[38:06.720 --> 38:12.720]  and over again I have done the best job I can in fact here I am
[38:12.720 --> 38:17.760]  two years ago folks I forgot to give this to you
[38:17.760 --> 38:22.880]  pull up YouTube it guys because I want to play it
[38:22.880 --> 38:25.840]  Alex Jones on San Antonio television here I found it I meant to
[38:25.840 --> 38:28.480]  play this today here it is I printed it off I forgot to give it
[38:28.480 --> 38:32.080]  to you Alex Jones discusses martial law and CBS San Antonio
[38:32.080 --> 38:36.480]  cue that up because I want people to hear me back in August of
[38:36.480 --> 38:40.560]  2007 almost two years ago breaking down homeland securities for
[38:40.560 --> 38:43.520]  the patriots homeland securities for the gun owners
[38:43.520 --> 38:46.400]  this whole anti-terror thing is for the American people
[38:46.400 --> 38:50.000]  they're going to announce they're going to abrogate homeland
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.440]  north com on the streets of America and then a year and a half later it's
[38:53.440 --> 38:57.040]  mainstream news come come take it and I remember when I did that on
[38:57.040 --> 39:00.560]  San Antonio TV you can go read the thousands of comments on there
[39:00.560 --> 39:03.440]  you know the hundred thousand views or whatever it is and they're like he's
[39:03.440 --> 39:06.880]  making it up he's a fear monger that's not going to happen
[39:06.880 --> 39:11.520]  they're not going to announce north coms for America
[39:11.520 --> 39:18.320]  and then they announce it and people say okay big deal
[39:18.320 --> 39:21.120]  and I'm telling you they're going to try to use
[39:21.120 --> 39:25.680]  some type of hyped up super flu whether it really is a deadly flu or not
[39:25.680 --> 39:28.640]  in the future and I've been saying this for the last few months in earnest
[39:28.640 --> 39:31.520]  because I can see their buildup their propaganda and everything you're
[39:31.520 --> 39:36.240]  seeing right now is just more of the buildup and I said last saturday
[39:36.240 --> 39:40.240]  eight nine days ago I said you watch they're going to claim it's going to
[39:40.240 --> 39:42.880]  mutate with other viruses and they're going to claim it's going to mutate
[39:42.880 --> 39:45.280]  into a deadly strain and that this is only the beginning
[39:45.280 --> 39:49.040]  and then sunday janet napolitano the head of homeland security comes out and
[39:49.040 --> 39:51.920]  says just that and writers she says yeah well this will probably
[39:51.920 --> 39:56.480]  peter out but the next big one super deadly is sure to come soon
[39:56.480 --> 40:00.320]  and then now that's all they're saying today
[40:00.320 --> 40:07.280]  Reuters afp ap headlines swine flu could return with vengeance swine flutter
[40:07.280 --> 40:10.720]  return with vengeance who says swine flutter return with vengeance
[40:10.720 --> 40:14.080]  those are three different headlines
[40:15.600 --> 40:19.360]  they told local governments they told national governments the un told china
[40:19.360 --> 40:22.080]  and everybody else this thing was super deadly and probably going to kill
[40:22.080 --> 40:25.600]  millions and the greatest threat to mankind and its history
[40:25.600 --> 40:28.880]  and so of course china is freaking out and locking everything down because they
[40:28.880 --> 40:32.880]  also are using it as a pretext to pose as the saviors and the rulers
[40:32.880 --> 40:36.320]  same thing in mexico and the verge of collapse they're using it as a unifying
[40:36.320 --> 40:40.880]  effect i know how these people operate
[40:41.840 --> 40:44.960]  and you always hear me when i talk about troops at super bowl troops at kandaki
[40:44.960 --> 40:48.240]  derby troops here troops there there i am
[40:48.240 --> 40:54.480]  eating dinner saturday night five o'clock

[41:14.320 --> 41:18.480]  run around on the big screen tv's in there
[41:18.480 --> 41:22.400]  if i'm sitting there watching this and i go home and that night
[41:22.400 --> 41:26.720]  guess what when i get home late at night after working on a new secret film

[41:31.840 --> 41:36.640]  and i see the headline good old curtain ammo
[41:36.640 --> 41:40.640]  military police at kandaki derby you know it's curtain ammo broke into
[41:40.640 --> 41:46.080]  national news that afp had one photo and he found it three days later
[41:46.080 --> 41:50.480]  after the mass shooting in alabama it was curt that noticed it
[41:52.080 --> 41:55.360]  they'll always show it in the photos but not no news articles
[41:55.360 --> 42:00.320]  regular army mps running checkpoints in alabama hours after the shooting was
[42:00.320 --> 42:04.320]  over he does a story a week later it's in ap
[42:04.320 --> 42:09.120]  roiders houston chronicle it comes out it's a felony illegal why were they
[42:09.120 --> 42:14.240]  there why was north com there we have the kernel on the show
[42:14.240 --> 42:18.800]  again i'm not bragging it it actually freaks me out i've got like four riders
[42:18.800 --> 42:21.600]  and myself and we're breaking more news
[42:21.600 --> 42:26.000]  than you know that that's important and then then really anybody else
[42:26.000 --> 42:29.440]  and i am scared to hire more riders i'm scared to bring more people in here
[42:29.440 --> 42:34.160]  because of infiltrators believing it hasn't been pretty in the past
[42:34.160 --> 42:38.080]  and uh i mean imagine i live a cloak and dagger life folks i have to worry
[42:38.080 --> 42:40.960]  about a fed coming in here and doing something legal
[42:40.960 --> 42:44.800]  just like tommy chong went in their business mailed out a bong to somebody
[42:44.800 --> 42:48.240]  where it was illegal just to get him busted a pipe
[42:48.240 --> 42:51.600]  you know i mean we have to think about this and deal with this and i and i
[42:51.600 --> 42:56.880]  think you know i can't cover it all i can't do it all
[42:56.880 --> 42:59.920]  but the issue here is
[43:00.400 --> 43:03.760]  military police at kentucky derby and you look at this photo
[43:03.760 --> 43:07.600]  military police to take a fan who ran on the track following the running
[43:07.600 --> 43:13.600]  of the 135th kentucky derby horse race at church hill downs
[43:14.320 --> 43:19.520]  saturday may 2nd 2009 louisville kentucky and it's all the big billionaires
[43:19.520 --> 43:22.560]  and the queen of england has even come before the kentucky derby and
[43:22.560 --> 43:26.240]  all these elites and all the rich Arabs and what do they see all over the
[43:26.240 --> 43:29.840]  world they estimate that a billion people watch
[43:29.840 --> 43:33.600]  the kentucky derby same thing with the super bowl
[43:33.600 --> 43:36.880]  two billion people watching

[43:57.360 --> 44:01.200]  mps and we're gonna shut down and the next week after
[44:01.200 --> 44:05.680]  that happened the local newspapers we have links in this article
[44:05.680 --> 44:09.280]  that's what's powerful about info wars dot com prison blood dot com articles
[44:09.280 --> 44:12.880]  is they give you the full picture each time they go back through years of this
[44:12.880 --> 44:15.840]  crap and here i am going that you know years
[44:15.840 --> 44:18.080]  ago they're gonna have troops on the streets they're gonna condition you
[44:18.080 --> 44:21.200]  first you know they don't just show up with tens of millions of troops
[44:21.200 --> 44:25.280]  day one have them running around first they have foreign troops in drills with
[44:25.280 --> 44:28.480]  police and military to get you ready then they have them land and do gun
[44:28.480 --> 44:32.000]  confiscation drills in florida then they have cooperative nugget drills for gun
[44:32.000 --> 44:36.400]  confiscations in louisiana mississippi we have all the footage of that and they
[44:36.400 --> 44:39.120]  do it over and over and then all the mexican troops are here to help in
[44:39.120 --> 44:42.320]  katrina with you know with soup kitchens and all the
[44:42.320 --> 44:46.480]  regular armies out confiscating guns all the guns will be taken no one will be
[44:46.480 --> 44:50.720]  allowed to be armed that's a quote from the mayor and the police chief
[44:50.720 --> 44:54.240]  and they have the troops on abc news yeah i don't like confiscating guns and
[44:54.240 --> 44:58.160]  then shooting americans but we got to do it that's a quote
[44:58.160 --> 45:02.800]  then you shoot american yeah that's right i shoot american
[45:03.840 --> 45:07.520]  i mean you see how it's this slow boil and oh the flu remember how many years
[45:07.520 --> 45:11.840]  have i told you they'll have lots of fake flu scares before the big one
[45:11.840 --> 45:15.200]  and that way you'll sit there and sit tight when that stuff comes through your
[45:15.200 --> 45:17.680]  town and kills your daughter in the hammer
[45:17.680 --> 45:20.880]  they're not going to be able to take the guns folks without an overlying
[45:20.880 --> 45:26.640]  bio weapon attack on top of it that is guaranteed going to be their move
[45:26.640 --> 45:34.080]  guaranteed i know these people this is all i do is study them
[45:35.280 --> 45:38.560]  you can bank on it you can set your watch and warrant by it i know what
[45:38.560 --> 45:42.720]  they're going to do i don't just know intellectually i can
[45:42.720 --> 45:45.840]  study how they operate and what they're gearing up for and what their attack
[45:45.840 --> 45:49.200]  pattern is what their architecture is
[45:49.840 --> 45:53.360]  a google news search does not produce a story or even a brief mention of the
[45:53.360 --> 45:56.800]  fact that military police were on hand at the kentucky derby to keep
[45:56.800 --> 46:00.960]  restless plebes in line however an associated press photograph posted on
[46:00.960 --> 46:04.080]  the yahoo news website shows two imps and combat
[46:04.080 --> 46:09.040]  fatigues with sidearms restraining a man at the derby
[46:09.040 --> 46:12.720]  military police detainment man who ran on the track following the running
[46:12.720 --> 46:15.840]  of the 135th kentucky derby horse race and church showdowns
[46:15.840 --> 46:20.400]  saturday may second 2009 in louis buccatucky the photo caption reads
[46:20.400 --> 46:23.920]  the photo was also included in a slideshow on yahoo's sports website
[46:23.920 --> 46:26.960]  although the text of the article does not contain a mention of the military
[46:26.960 --> 46:29.680]  police at the event
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.640]  the military has no business policing the citizens
[46:34.640 --> 46:37.600]  except during extraordinary exceptional times of national emergency
[46:37.600 --> 46:40.960]  by an executive order this is very disturbing completely unamerican maybe
[46:40.960 --> 46:44.640]  even more disturbing is that no one seems to care
[46:44.640 --> 46:49.680]  how quietly and easily we have accepted the burgeoning police state
[46:53.680 --> 46:58.880]  that was a comment on yahoo's sports good job yeah you know what's going on
[46:58.880 --> 47:02.480]  info wars is reported on numerous instances a military involvement with

[55:12.400 --> 55:15.920]  or i'm on cbs tv now how much of this has come true now
[55:15.920 --> 55:18.880]  of course it didn't come true i was reading government documents but to the
[55:18.880 --> 55:23.840]  public you know how much of this has now been proven correct here it is
[55:24.480 --> 55:28.240]  falls and gives the government a black and white limit in a post 911 world
[55:28.240 --> 55:32.560]  security high over a country of war not an ideal to hear the blimp part i want
[55:32.560 --> 55:37.840]  to start that video from the start okay here it is folks
[55:37.840 --> 55:41.680]  in the future every major city will have a high altitude blimp
[55:41.680 --> 55:45.360]  tethered to a cable with ground penetrating radar that looks right
[55:45.360 --> 55:48.240]  through your walls and gives the government a black and white image in a
[55:48.240 --> 55:52.240]  post 911 world security higher we're a country at war
[55:52.240 --> 55:55.280]  not an ideal situation for anyone but there are some that say if we have
[55:55.280 --> 55:58.560]  another terrorist attack on american soil the u.s will be under
[55:58.560 --> 56:03.040]  martial law on the phone we have us with us the man you just saw in the video
[56:03.040 --> 56:06.880]  that is alex jones a man who is set forth to expose these supposed indiscretions

[56:23.360 --> 56:27.120]  chief and we threw delta force out they brought in large bags of cash and tried
[56:27.120 --> 56:30.240]  to buy them off then i talked to emergency managers around the country
[56:30.240 --> 56:33.760]  when i was fighting this then and found out there was a covert plan
[56:33.760 --> 56:38.480]  to take over all of our major cities now that's been in the associated press
[56:38.480 --> 56:42.400]  the homeland security committee in congress with the highest level
[56:42.400 --> 56:49.200]  security clearances are not allowed to see the details of pdd 51 signed main
[56:49.200 --> 56:53.840]  9th of this year that literally makes the president a dictator
[56:53.840 --> 57:00.080]  and last year the president funded the john war defense authorization act for
[57:00.080 --> 57:04.720]  domestic oppression of the american people it actually says that it is for
[57:04.720 --> 57:09.680]  domestic insurrection and rebellion this has nothing to do with terror
[57:09.680 --> 57:12.640]  well let's talk to the military industrial complex waging war on the
[57:12.640 --> 57:15.760]  people well let's talk about that presidential directive number 51 that
[57:15.760 --> 57:18.720]  you're talking about mr adicott he's talking about the one that
[57:18.720 --> 57:22.880]  basically gives a the president some power to go in in case of an emergency
[57:22.880 --> 57:28.560]  and establish some sort of order right is it is it as bad as as mr jones calls it
[57:28.560 --> 57:32.560]  i don't think so um lawyer for the people that were there in 99
[57:32.560 --> 57:36.880]  presidential directives are are not are nothing new i mean the the clinton
[57:36.880 --> 57:40.640]  administration had a continuity pdd itself and this
[57:40.640 --> 57:44.720]  president has simply replaced that one with this one it's interesting because
[57:44.720 --> 57:48.560]  a lot of the annexes to the document are classified so i don't know how this
[57:48.560 --> 57:52.320]  gentleman has had access to those where he can tell us about what it says
[57:52.320 --> 57:57.440]  but basically it uh if you read section nine paragraph nine it indicates that
[57:57.440 --> 58:01.760]  the executive branch has a responsibility for continuity and the judicial
[58:01.760 --> 58:04.800]  branch has a responsibility and also the legislative branch so it's
[58:04.800 --> 58:07.280]  it's really not the boogeyman this is nothing new
[58:07.280 --> 58:10.240]  nothing to get upset about it's uh actually the responsibility of the
[58:10.240 --> 58:13.440]  government to to do this well mr judge you're just
[58:13.440 --> 58:16.080]  alluding to the cameras and i think we heard a little bit at the top of the
[58:16.080 --> 58:18.960]  show about you talking about the blimps overhead

[1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:37.280]  alluding to the cameras and i think we heard a little bit at the top of the
[1:00:37.280 --> 1:00:40.080]  show about you talking about the blimps overhead
[1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:43.040]  do you really think we're gonna get to that point i have not seen any blimps

[1:00:45.360 --> 1:00:48.720]  sure let me break this down that is a pentagon
[1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:52.800]  announcement of 2004 and they do now have them
[1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:56.800]  over dc la and other areas and yes they are
[1:00:56.800 --> 1:01:00.400]  mounting high altitude blimps these are so high you can't even
[1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:04.240]  uh see them without a telescope or a night you can see them because of the
[1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:08.000]  atmosphere and the sun going up but i already have google who can i can
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:11.520]  actually google my own home you know and so there's my home listen listen
[1:01:11.520 --> 1:01:14.240]  you know mr. adicott's not stupid i looked into him
[1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:17.680]  okay and again he knows what he's doing uh we have
[1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:21.440]  the memos written by john you and the attorney general
[1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:24.320]  albert reconcile us saying they can torture children
[1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:28.320]  with pliers that the president is says that with pliers
[1:01:28.320 --> 1:01:33.280]  it says the president is above the law and that all law flows from him
[1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:38.880]  and in pdd 51 he is saying he is in command of continuity of government
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:42.400]  and then congress i mean obviously he is in command that's what the executive
[1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:47.200]  does chief all the administrative agencies are under the executive branch
[1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:50.000]  i mean all administrative agencies are under the executive branch so why would
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.960]  that be surprising that he is issuing policy memos
[1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:56.880]  to agencies within his control we will expect him to do that he will he will
[1:01:56.880 --> 1:02:00.800]  command the entire infrastructure that's not what it is but he's a president on
[1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:04.080]  his way out as well there's gonna be there's gonna be a change in presidency
[1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:07.040]  here come over to the planet dot com rempo worse dot com
[1:02:07.040 --> 1:02:11.120]  you can see the body or the body of evidence or go to google and type in
[1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:15.280]  marshal law 9 11 rise the police state or terror storm you can watch my films
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:17.680]  for free i have a better idea you could go to google
[1:02:17.680 --> 1:02:22.160]  and pull up pdd 51 and read for yourself and read paragraph nine which talks
[1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:25.200]  about the the responsibility of each branch of government
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:28.800]  and not executive takeover why don't you remember the four members of the
[1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:31.840]  homeland security committee in congress
[1:02:31.840 --> 1:02:35.520]  who have been able to see part of it and then want to see the classified areas
[1:02:35.520 --> 1:02:38.560]  because they're saying that it looks like it's a marshal law plan
[1:02:38.560 --> 1:02:42.560]  that's members of congress and adicott you're counting on folks not going and
[1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:47.040]  seeing what the ap and the orgonia and others had to say mr mr jones does the
[1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:51.280]  mentality or what mr jones is pushing here does it incite maybe us
[1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:55.440]  it is is it a fear mongering thing or or does he have some valid validity to his
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:59.280]  points well obviously in in time of conflict and we're definitely in a
[1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:02.960]  conflict with al-qaeda i mean they want to kill tens of thousands of americans if
[1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:05.920]  they can that's a fact and our government has a responsibility
[1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:08.720]  to protect the citizens but i think mr jones is correct
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:11.440]  and that that has to be balanced against civil liberties and where you draw
[1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:14.960]  that line is something that we need debated i think voices like his are
[1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:18.480]  important but we need to put them in context i mean you need to you need to
[1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:22.880]  look at the facts take a deep breath and and make up your own mind but certainly
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:26.160]  you know this is america you have the right to say what you want to say
[1:03:26.160 --> 1:03:29.760]  mr anaconda you have a right to um to your own opinion but you don't have a
[1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:32.720]  right to your own facts and i think that's the case you see here
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:36.640]  you know what i can prove my facts we have members of congress
[1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:40.240]  who are concerned about this we have republican and democratic
[1:03:40.240 --> 1:03:43.360]  liberal and conservative top lawyers across the country
[1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:46.800]  saying this country's going into marshal law bob woodward
[1:03:46.800 --> 1:03:51.440]  last year was in san Antonio and said he thinks we're going into a dictatorship
[1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:54.880]  that was in the front of the newspaper i'm not the only one
[1:03:54.880 --> 1:03:58.080]  that's worried about this by the way the borders are still wide open
[1:03:58.080 --> 1:04:01.120]  but the america people are being harassed and controlled
[1:04:01.120 --> 1:04:05.200]  we have the federal documents and by the way anaconda you want to come to baby
[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:08.480]  for an hour i'll be on the radio on kehl beachhead today for two hours
[1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:12.080]  what are you doing we are talking with alex jones from info wars dot com about
[1:04:12.080 --> 1:04:15.360]  the changes here in america and he believes we're changing into a police
[1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:18.960]  state and also joining me as dr jeff adica and he is our expert on terrorism
[1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:22.240]  law and we thank you both for joining us we're kind of continue our conversation
[1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:25.680]  alex you've got some films out there you go to protest and you complain we're
[1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:28.880]  gearing up for this police state because you say cops are swarming the streets
[1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:32.400]  with guns these are huge protests like the one we just saw you in new york during
[1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:36.000]  the republican national convention of course there's some increased police
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.480]  prisons in new york after it being attacked but
[1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:42.800]  do you honestly think that we're getting to a place in time where nobody's going
[1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:45.920]  to have any freedom to do what they actually want to do yes people are being
[1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:50.240]  arrested coast to coast for peacefully protesting or demonstrating new york
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:54.080]  has banned independent news cameras on the streets some of my
[1:04:54.080 --> 1:04:57.760]  cameraman have now been arrested and and told that they're terrorist
[1:04:57.760 --> 1:05:01.120]  we'll be right back uh video cameras
[1:05:01.120 --> 1:05:04.640]  more than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water
[1:05:04.640 --> 1:05:07.760]  and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while
[1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:10.080]  taking hot showers than when drinking the water
[1:05:10.080 --> 1:05:13.600]  that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others
[1:05:13.600 --> 1:05:17.920]  are absorbed into the skin the kdf dual media shower filter works with both
[1:05:17.920 --> 1:05:20.800]  hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine

[1:08:08.720 --> 1:08:15.280]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network for those just joining us i was at
[1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:19.280]  the end of the last hour in the start of this when i was playing part of a 10
[1:08:19.280 --> 1:08:22.880]  minute clip of when i was on cbs tv
[1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:26.640]  debating uh a former jag officer who's now a
[1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:31.040]  law professor down there at st mary's university
[1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:35.040]  telling us how wonderful the marshal law situation is in this country
[1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:38.480]  now since then i've interviewed adicott two or three times
[1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:42.160]  and he's actually come around on air and said i guess you're right
[1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:46.000]  we are going into a police state they are gearing up for marshal law and it's
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:49.760]  not good first time interviewing he kind of
[1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:52.480]  said yeah i looked into what you said i guess part of it's true
[1:08:52.480 --> 1:08:56.240]  this is a problem and the last time i interviewed him he was basically like
[1:08:56.240 --> 1:08:59.760]  alex jones so that's the amazing thing about this and i only
[1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:02.400]  played about half the clip the rest of it is online
[1:09:02.400 --> 1:09:06.160]  you can just google alex jones discusses marshal law and cbs
[1:09:06.160 --> 1:09:11.680]  but uh no pdv-51 is different than other
[1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:15.920]  continued government plans because it says congress takes a back seat and the
[1:09:15.920 --> 1:09:20.720]  executive runs everything when in truth they always
[1:09:20.720 --> 1:09:23.760]  teach us that we have co-equal branches of government
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:29.920]  until the last 140-something years civil war decided it
[1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:33.920]  congress the legislature was above the executive
[1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:37.680]  and then below that was the courts they were not co-equal
[1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:41.120]  because you had a greater separation of powers i've had constitutional law
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:42.800]  scholars on scores i'm not great with us
[1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:45.360]  because they've read the federalist papers in the history
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:49.280]  and the precedents because you have the greatest separation of powers in the
[1:09:49.280 --> 1:09:52.480]  legislature you got a bunch of house members a bunch of senate
[1:09:52.480 --> 1:09:56.800]  members they come from the states that's why until
[1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:02.960]  1913 with the 17th amendment senators were appointed by legislatures of the
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:05.920]  state that were elected so you vote for the legislature
[1:10:05.920 --> 1:10:09.680]  but to make sure the senators were creatures of the state
[1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:13.600]  of the locals they were sent to washington and then the house members
[1:10:13.600 --> 1:10:18.400]  were elected at large but i digress into all of this the
[1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:21.760]  point is we've studied it we know what's going on and then now you hear them
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:24.800]  oh under executive order where the flu outbreak we can forcibly
[1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:28.560]  inoculate you or arrest you or lock down u.s cities but we're going to keep the
[1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:31.440]  borders wide open
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:35.920]  so coming up on a breakdown the latest flu info and haven't gotten into the key
[1:10:35.920 --> 1:10:39.600]  areas of that yet big quarantines going on in the u.s and around the world
[1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:43.680]  they're saying a new deadlier flu variant or mutation of this is gonna
[1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:48.000]  come uh fear mongering that uh we'll break down what's really happening and
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:51.680]  i'm most importantly i'm gonna get into the census takers
[1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:55.440]  supposed to start next year but we have the inside skinny detailed on what's
[1:10:55.440 --> 1:11:00.080]  happening so we'll break that down coming up in the next segment
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:05.840]  but i remember a few months ago i kept seeing newscast
[1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:10.080]  called a you know a new deadly type of pranking tonight
[1:11:10.080 --> 1:11:14.000]  at you know five and we played some of these news clips
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  where people are hacking ip phones
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:21.200]  computer phones internet phones iphone
[1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:25.200]  uh skype phones and they hack your phone number
[1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:28.800]  they then get your ip address and they do the same thing
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:32.240]  same two or three things they call the local police and say
[1:11:32.240 --> 1:11:38.880]  uh hi austin 911 i may help you yes my husband he just killed my children
[1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:42.000]  and he's in the room he says he's coming here he's knocked on the door he killed
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:45.360]  me he says he's gonna kill the police please come fast
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:50.240]  swat team show up 15 minutes later they go bust down the door
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:53.440]  and the family's asleep the husband grabs for a gun not knowing what's
[1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:56.320]  happening cops gunning down can't blame them can't blame the
[1:11:56.320 --> 1:12:01.200]  off the man or you know i mean it keeps happening
[1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:05.520]  and it's called sky packing and uh i've actually had something like this
[1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:09.120]  happened to me once i people program their fax machines i know i'm giving you
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:13.600]  an idea go ahead you're gonna do it it's criminal doesn't hurt us
[1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:16.800]  and then they send threatening faxes around the police departments news
[1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:20.320]  agencies and then the you know the cops are calling or
[1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:23.280]  showing up or you know are are you sending these
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:26.720]  faxes well he was at church with her
[1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:34.880]  reportedly doesn't matter the police came they charge him with terrorism
[1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:44.160]  and uh it's just amazing
[1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:49.440]  you know we've got aneta lundaby on the line with us
[1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:52.800]  and so when i heard this and i read this in the news
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:58.320]  she didn't know about sky packing is when i saw the news articles
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:01.920]  it didn't mention that she just said this was some kind of prank he was at
[1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:06.000]  church with us and i went wait a minute
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:09.360]  and then we talked to her she's like yeah he's got an internet phone he's got a
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:12.800]  skype phone and now she's heard it might have been a hack
[1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:15.600]  and it's a homeschooler you never hear about homeschoolers doing anything
[1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:18.720]  wrong they have the highest test scores geography beast spelling beast
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:23.600]  all of it and i believe her but but but there's another facet to this
[1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:29.360]  there's another facet and we're going to missus uh lundaby
[1:13:29.360 --> 1:13:32.640]  and that is that they've charged him under the patriot act and haven't let him
[1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:37.840]  see lawyers or let him have the process in fact here's the article
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:43.680]  16 year old ashton lundaby's bedroom in his mother's
[1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:49.200]  grandville county home is nothing if not patriotic images american flags are
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:50.880]  everywhere on the bed on the floor on the wall
[1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:54.000]  according to united states government the 10th grade homeschoolers being held
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:57.520]  in criminal complaint they made a bomb threat from his home
[1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:01.120]  on the night of february 15th the family was at church function that night his
[1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:06.960]  mother annetta anita lundaby said undoubtedly
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:10.800]  they were given false information or they would not have had 12 agents in my
[1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:13.440]  house
[1:14:13.440 --> 1:14:16.480]  with a widow and two children and three cats lundaby said
[1:14:16.480 --> 1:14:20.240]  around 10 p.m. on march 5th lundaby said the FBI agents along with three local
[1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:23.600]  law enforcement officers stormed her home looking for a son they handcuffed him
[1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:26.400]  and presented her with a search warrant
[1:14:26.400 --> 1:14:30.320]  i was terrified lundaby's mother said
[1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:34.720]  there were guns and i don't allow guns around my children i don't believe in
[1:14:34.720 --> 1:14:38.240]  guns lundaby told the officers that someone
[1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:41.520]  had hacked into her son's ip address and was using it to make crank calls
[1:14:41.520 --> 1:14:44.720]  connected to the internet and it goes on and on from there and then the whole
[1:14:44.720 --> 1:14:48.240]  point is they've now said lundaby said the u.s a patriot act stripped her son
[1:14:48.240 --> 1:14:52.160]  of his due process rights no lawyer uh they're allowed to spy on the
[1:14:52.160 --> 1:14:56.240]  lawyer if she gets one not allowed to get assistance
[1:14:56.240 --> 1:15:00.320]  uh he now sits in a juvenile facility in south in indiana his mother
[1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:03.600]  has a little access to him since his arrest she has gone to her state
[1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:06.400]  representatives as well as attorney seeking assistance but she said there
[1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:10.880]  is nothing she can do to help we have no no
[1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:14.160]  rights on the patriot act even defend him because the patriot act basically
[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:17.600]  supersedes the constitution she said it wasn't
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:21.440]  indeed it wasn't intended to drag her 16 year old
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:27.360]  120 pound son out of the middle of the night and charge that he
[1:15:27.360 --> 1:15:31.600]  can't even defend and it goes on to say they are using the u.s a patriot act
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:34.880]  now in this case they can even halfway claim its terrorism but it obviously
[1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:38.000]  isn't but with marijuana you can google patriot act used in
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.040]  tennessee in thousands of non-terror related cases
[1:15:41.040 --> 1:15:44.800]  huffer belly toys visited for selling a toy that may have been patented
[1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:48.240]  uh you know and threatened with terrorist arrest you know that was the
[1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:52.960]  oragonian we had the lady on all right i'm going to shut up and go to uh
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:58.720]  mrs uh lundaby uh thank you for coming on is your son out yet i know this
[1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:03.520]  article is from last week no sir he's not he's still being held
[1:16:03.520 --> 1:16:08.800]  uh in south bend indiana um he hasn't he's had one detention hearing
[1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:13.280]  and they what they call a status hearing he's not being charged as an adult
[1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:16.800]  they're going to charge him on maybe 22nd as an adult
[1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:20.640]  but in order to do that they have to um
[1:16:20.640 --> 1:16:24.640]  prove that this was a crime of violence which
[1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:29.840]  in order to meet those criterias he has to have had a previous
[1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:35.520]  uh he had been previously adjudicated as a ju as a delinquent which he has not
[1:16:35.520 --> 1:16:41.040]  ever been never been arrested um and and he said that he read from the
[1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:45.920]  complaint that the school where he's been charged for
[1:16:45.920 --> 1:16:49.520]  the bomb threat was at paddy university where he doesn't even know where that
[1:16:49.520 --> 1:16:53.840]  that was at the time he don't know i mean i mean have you brought up to them
[1:16:53.840 --> 1:16:58.240]  that it's a big issue with these skype and ip hackers
[1:16:58.240 --> 1:17:02.400]  doing this constantly well we brought it up at the detention hearing
[1:17:02.400 --> 1:17:09.360]  and that um fbi agent blatantly um but there's no other words used a lot to
[1:17:09.360 --> 1:17:14.000]  the the federal magistrate uh judge gate and told him that
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:18.640]  that you could not hack an ip address that it was like a fingerprint
[1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:21.920]  what is he talking about this is all over the news i know
[1:17:21.920 --> 1:17:26.640]  they wanted my son they wanted my son and they wanted to set an example out of
[1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:29.760]  him uh it was well i mean what do they think happens in a
[1:17:29.760 --> 1:17:33.040]  denial of service attack they go grab thousands of people's
[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:36.880]  computers hack their ip address and they're not the ones hacking
[1:17:36.880 --> 1:17:41.920]  look i who is the name of this agent um i really don't know because he would not
[1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:45.200]  give me his name oh so you're at trials now and you
[1:17:45.200 --> 1:17:47.600]  don't even know the witnesses against your names
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:51.600]  i don't i'm not allowed to have any information concerning my son
[1:17:51.600 --> 1:17:55.120]  so well it's obviously because you're a homeschooler look that jackass at the
[1:17:55.120 --> 1:17:58.720]  f excuse me ma'am i apologize that fb agent with you
[1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:04.000]  he knows it's a lie oh they do that they hit him with numerous
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:09.040]  bomb threats and the judge down here my understanding wanted to let him go
[1:18:09.040 --> 1:18:12.240]  and the and the probation officer because he had never had any kind of
[1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:16.480]  previous anything he doesn't smoke drink do drugs
[1:18:16.480 --> 1:18:20.480]  um that's who they love they hate him but they oh my god
[1:18:20.480 --> 1:18:24.880]  he's kind of a poster boy of all american good kid
[1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:27.840]  well they hate that man i'm sure you've seen the department of homeland security
[1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:30.960]  report those reports list homeschoolers as potential
[1:18:30.960 --> 1:18:33.680]  terrorist i have previous reports where they say
[1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:37.600]  homeschooling is some type of thought crime now let me expand on that well have
[1:18:37.600 --> 1:18:40.160]  you seen the federal drills they do in michigan in places
[1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:44.640]  where they come in and take over schools with guns drawn saying their homeschoolers
[1:18:44.640 --> 1:18:48.160]  and it's really the police they're to terrorize and demonize homeschoolers
[1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:51.120]  i'm not kidding you can't make this up ma'am
[1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:56.240]  oh i believe it i believe anything now well now now i mean but but now i'm not
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:18:59.040]  saying your son's innocent though i believe in my gut he is
[1:18:59.040 --> 1:19:03.200]  i can't prove that what what i can prove is he's not getting due process afforded
[1:19:03.200 --> 1:19:06.560]  to us citizens they promise the patriot act wasn't for us citizens
[1:19:06.560 --> 1:19:10.720]  but section 802 says any action that endangers human life it's a violation
[1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:13.200]  of any federal or state laws and act of terror
[1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:16.240]  and so that's why misdemeanor people are now being charged with it
[1:19:16.240 --> 1:19:19.360]  but to expand on this if they want to charge him with a felony that's one
[1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:22.560]  thing but they have a right to face their accuser
[1:19:22.560 --> 1:19:25.840]  so we're gonna we're gonna go to break i'm gonna come back and hear more about
[1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:27.600]  the case and what you're facing ma'am and
[1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:30.640]  how folks can hopefully try to support you and
[1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:33.920]  but there's no due process i guess he may go to a supermax and that's the end of
[1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:37.680]  it but you've somehow got to get the transcript of that court but i guess
[1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:41.520]  it's patriot act so you can't and point out that they're lying what i know the
[1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:45.280]  lie is is if this fb agent said you can't
[1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:49.760]  hack an ip address and that you can't take over skype telephones and make bomb
[1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:54.160]  threats i mean all you got to do is google it it's abccbs nbc

[1:24:27.280 --> 1:24:30.800]  i was just talking to my it people and we found all these different newscasts
[1:24:30.800 --> 1:24:35.520]  and clips where they talk about people hacking skype hacking
[1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:40.160]  voiceover ip it happens constantly it's a serious problem
[1:24:40.160 --> 1:24:43.840]  and the FBI saying no they're not even looking at that they told the judge
[1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:47.520]  it doesn't exist there's no way this happened tell us what happened
[1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:54.080]  tell us how he's not getting due process one thing under um galt versus us
[1:24:54.080 --> 1:25:01.360]  he's he's not uh being allowed his 14th 14th amendment right which the
[1:25:01.360 --> 1:25:05.840]  the u.s supreme court has ruled that neither the 14th amendment nor the bill
[1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:10.320]  alike is for gulf alone um just because he's a juvenile
[1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:15.200]  doesn't mean he needs to be held for 60 days without due process well that goes
[1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:18.880]  back to eugenics the family courts they thought it was so important to sterilize
[1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:22.480]  people 80 years ago in this country under the eugenics laws that hitler learned
[1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:26.000]  from us that the family courts are still there so they also use
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:30.640]  that patriot act type code uh... against families they can do stuff against
[1:25:30.640 --> 1:25:35.360]  families they can't do to axe murders
[1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:42.720]  the the FBI knew blatantly knew that my um
[1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:47.760]  that my son had not done all these bomb threats but
[1:25:47.760 --> 1:25:51.840]  um you know there were several people that did it and and my attorney had told
[1:25:51.840 --> 1:25:56.480]  me that um here's a public defender had told him that
[1:25:56.480 --> 1:26:00.880]  and us that he was that the people other people that were
[1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:04.000]  involved had already been charged and that's not true
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:09.120]  but there's people that actually did it or still on the internet
[1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:13.200]  uh... as we speak still doing the same thing and
[1:26:13.200 --> 1:26:16.480]  harassing other people and still in the skype address
[1:26:16.480 --> 1:26:20.720]  um they posted my son's ip address on youtube
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:26.000]  um and all my personal information and that's right they call it a lots i don't
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.880]  know what that means but the more people they torture
[1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:31.760]  it's like a subculture out there they call it lots
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:36.000]  and they claim they get personal power which it gets really bad karma folks
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.640]  uh those of you out there doing stuff like this i wouldn't want to be you
[1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:41.600]  really bad i don't believe in karma in the classical sense but
[1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:45.840]  you know by that i mean report you so okay so so that so the the feds don't
[1:26:45.840 --> 1:26:49.680]  care they just want to burn somebody and and get a caller i mean
[1:26:49.680 --> 1:26:52.080]  i mean that's pretty much what it looks like
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:58.240]  i mean they've got a and well my because my son is intelligent and he has an
[1:26:58.240 --> 1:27:02.720]  IQ of a hundred and forty that he firmly believes that
[1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:06.480]  his intelligence is going to be used against him
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:10.400]  instead of helping him because they're going to say well he was intelligent
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:14.880]  enough to do this to do this but you can't make a call
[1:27:14.880 --> 1:27:18.800]  when you're not there from from from your skype account
[1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:22.400]  unless you have an iphone or whatever my son like i said my son didn't have a
[1:27:22.400 --> 1:27:25.920]  cell phone he was at church you have witnesses but because it's the patriot
[1:27:25.920 --> 1:27:29.760]  act explain your violations of basic due process
[1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:33.760]  well they took well one of the one of our
[1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:37.360]  violations was that they wouldn't allow me to make a phone call that night to
[1:27:37.360 --> 1:27:42.400]  make a choice of attorney which is under the fifth amendment right that you
[1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:46.240]  have a choice attorney that's already set presidents with you so they're
[1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:50.400]  telling you who your lawyer is okay they they were not they did not allow me to
[1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:52.960]  make a call to my attorney that night and i had to be
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:57.120]  at attention at 10 10 the next morning which is an hour from here
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:01.520]  they appointed a court appointed attorney that he spoke to my son for
[1:28:01.520 --> 1:28:07.120]  less than 30 seconds and i i didn't want to get him but i couldn't find
[1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:10.480]  an attorney at that at that little time
[1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:14.400]  to to defend my son um we weren't given that opportunity
[1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:16.960]  and they say they are charging him under the patriot act so
[1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:20.080]  where does this go they're not saying they're not saying that but that's
[1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:23.040]  exactly what they're doing what's in the options
[1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:26.400]  point towards that and but they don't deny it either
[1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:31.520]  okay so so they're basically uh that's just the end of it then i mean so where
[1:28:31.520 --> 1:28:36.240]  does this go i'm not really sure i'm i'm hoping
[1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:42.480]  that the listeners will bombard the the assistant u.s attorney in south
[1:28:42.480 --> 1:28:47.840]  bend indiana with call's concern this uh because i need to know the truth i mean
[1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:51.280]  i need that the truth needs to be out there that people are concerned about
[1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:55.280]  their constitutional rights and and and with the patriot act
[1:28:55.280 --> 1:28:58.640]  you have my understanding you don't have any rights
[1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:02.240]  you know i think the feds want to burn your son because they want to set the
[1:29:02.240 --> 1:29:06.640]  precedent that even if it is clear because they use 30 agents and
[1:29:06.640 --> 1:29:11.360]  i was told that heads head to roll because they use so many agents
[1:29:11.360 --> 1:29:15.680]  on this case that they've got basically egg on their face
[1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:19.920]  uh to pull in a 16-year-old that they didn't find any bomb materials
[1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:24.080]  they didn't they didn't find anything and my son was asleep going toward
[1:29:24.080 --> 1:29:27.200]  to riley when they were taking him and they they were like
[1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:34.400]  gosh this is um we didn't find any bomb materials maybe we don't care i mean
[1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:36.640]  you know the government brings in the narcotics man

[1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:23.440]  you know the you you need to get that transcript
[1:34:23.440 --> 1:34:27.520]  because if indeed you go to the media with that
[1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:30.480]  because media attention will make them drop this it's probably the only thing
[1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:34.320]  that will because if you really got the fb age at testifying there's no such
[1:34:34.320 --> 1:34:38.000]  thing as ip hacking when they're trying to pass laws in congress over this
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:44.560]  when it is just a huge huge huge deal
[1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:47.840]  and everybody knows about it in every major police department's getting these
[1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:51.280]  things sometimes every week because people will
[1:34:51.280 --> 1:34:56.880]  skype call 9-1-1 or they will ip call 9-1-1 over an internet phone
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:35:02.800]  and uh... they will do it to the very house that they've hacked
[1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:08.080]  and this is so sick this is so savage this is why i knew about this years ago
[1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:12.640]  i don't have an ip phone in my house and ip phones are great they're inexpensive
[1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:16.960]  they work decent uh... but these bastards do this

[1:38:10.440 --> 1:38:11.400]  and drink beer
[1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:13.960]  i'm sorry to talk like that but that's what they're doing
[1:38:13.960 --> 1:38:14.920]  uh...
[1:38:14.920 --> 1:38:17.640]  you know that uh... ma'am ma'am ma'am for my son
[1:38:17.640 --> 1:38:21.960]  yeah yeah ma'am the key here is if you have a transcript
[1:38:21.960 --> 1:38:26.120]  of that court proceeding where they say there's no such thing
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:29.640]  as i p hacking that's very newsworthy
[1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:30.840]  and you need to get
[1:38:30.840 --> 1:38:33.240]  it newspapers to cover that
[1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:39.480]  i can't get them they they put that under a gag order where i couldn't get it
[1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:41.960]  i'm not allowed to um...
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:44.840]  get any information concerning his case
[1:38:44.840 --> 1:38:46.360]  well that's because they've got a
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:49.000]  one court appointed attorney that works for them and they're just shutting
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:50.360]  you out man on railroading them
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:53.080]  that's not true that's not absolutely right
[1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:54.040]  yeah yeah
[1:38:54.040 --> 1:38:58.520]  uh... now you're a witness to this so you seem to tell the news media about
[1:38:58.520 --> 1:39:00.280]  well it's in it's in the
[1:39:00.280 --> 1:39:02.920]  my attorney hasn't has agreed
[1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:06.040]  that that's exactly what was in the court proceedings because i told them

[1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:10.360]  because this is what was said
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:12.760]  that they held him based on the lie
[1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:16.280]  on false information and my son is taking criminology courses

[1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:22.280]  they can talk that out
[1:39:22.280 --> 1:39:24.600]  due to the fact that the fb i lied

[1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:12.280]  uh and and say if it's true that you guys are saying and you're not looking
[1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:13.160]  into the fact
[1:40:13.160 --> 1:40:18.120]  that this could be an ip hack you have engaged in a great crime
[1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:21.880]  and you know obviously if there's a big string of prank calls going on and they
[1:40:21.880 --> 1:40:26.120]  finally go to this location you're saying you have the youtube videos
[1:40:26.120 --> 1:40:30.040]  i would take those youtube videos show that to the media
[1:40:30.040 --> 1:40:33.240]  i'd go to a kinko's if you don't have a computer is your evidence i would print
[1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:34.200]  off
[1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:38.440]  uh the pages of youtube that show the person's account
[1:40:38.440 --> 1:40:40.840]  what they're saying how they're laughing about it
[1:40:40.840 --> 1:40:46.520]  and say here are the perpetrators bragging about setting up my son
[1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:50.280]  and here they are and then and then my son's being charged and tried
[1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:54.360]  that's a great news story the media will pick up on that and uh
[1:40:54.360 --> 1:40:57.000]  the feds will be forced to let your son go and then you're going to have one
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:01.800]  heck of a lawsuit god bless you ma'am good to hear from you
[1:41:01.800 --> 1:41:04.920]  oh thank you i you know i just can't handle it anymore
[1:41:04.920 --> 1:41:09.320]  my gut tells me that her son is as pure as the driven snow completely innocent
[1:41:09.320 --> 1:41:13.880]  what's going on rob do
[1:41:13.880 --> 1:41:16.200]  well come on over to the mic if you're gonna cause i'll have dead air but just
[1:41:16.200 --> 1:41:19.800]  listen to you if we do this live on air you've got to talk into the mic
[1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:23.080]  all right won't make any sense uh guy just called in and said that
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:27.000]  basically the same thing happened um about a year ago there was this Mormon
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:30.680]  compound where they took 500 kids and it was all started with a woman
[1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:35.400]  from colorado making one phone call that launched the feds in
[1:41:35.400 --> 1:41:38.600]  so basically by one phone call you know you can you can just they just come in
[1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:43.000]  and round you up and and take you away well like one phone call with a skype
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.600]  it wasn't with skype it was just a phone call to the feds claiming making a claim
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:49.400]  yeah and and and they totally violated all due
[1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:53.480]  process right right so i mean i guess it takes now it's just a phone call we've
[1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:58.200]  got to shorten that mic in there okay hey thanks for coming in appreciate it
[1:41:58.200 --> 1:42:05.800]  okay uh got a lot of news here that i want to go over

[1:42:35.720 --> 1:42:39.240]  in federal cases
[1:42:41.640 --> 1:42:46.120]  and that was that on star was being used to listen to people without warrants in

[1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:38.200]  on the other side and arrested him that's because all your text messages all

[1:44:06.840 --> 1:44:10.040]  oh alex don't share monger the nsa isn't listening to us and now they
[1:44:10.040 --> 1:44:13.240]  admit it see we're right again
[1:44:13.720 --> 1:44:17.080]  they're just now introducing it to the slaves they're being listened to
[1:44:17.080 --> 1:44:20.920]  man strip searched and held 24 hours over friends joke text about sabotaging
[1:44:20.920 --> 1:44:26.280]  a train this is the mail online this is out of paris out of france
[1:44:26.280 --> 1:44:29.720]  an innocent man with strip search and held in a cell 24 hours receiving a
[1:44:29.720 --> 1:44:32.440]  joke text message from a friend about sabotaging a train
[1:44:32.440 --> 1:44:35.560]  29 year old was arrested and his mobile phone provider
[1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:39.400]  passed on details of the message to police he accused him of not reporting a
[1:44:39.400 --> 1:44:41.720]  crime
[1:44:43.400 --> 1:44:46.760]  the case which happened in france provoked widespread outrage among the
[1:44:46.760 --> 1:44:50.840]  sinister march of big brother state there the man
[1:44:50.840 --> 1:44:55.160]  referred to only as his first name steven received a
[1:44:55.160 --> 1:44:58.920]  message saying do you know how to derail a train
[1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:05.080]  last month in abbey veal in soma region the worker
[1:45:05.080 --> 1:45:09.880]  thought nothing of the text but hours later he was arrested
[1:45:09.880 --> 1:45:13.640]  detectives said the mobile provider had passed on the tells of the text message
[1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:17.080]  he had computers data mining that they claimed steven
[1:45:17.080 --> 1:45:20.120]  had called the police as soon as he received the text
[1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:24.280]  and we're also seeing this in the u.s like 16 17 18 year olds
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:27.480]  will text you know a guy's girlfriend the captain of the football team gets
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:32.840]  arrested because his 16 year old girlfriend texting
[1:45:32.840 --> 1:45:37.720]  a shot with her bra and you know think of how many of us
[1:45:37.720 --> 1:45:41.560]  in high school had girlfriends folks
[1:45:41.960 --> 1:45:45.720]  and think about how many of us were promiscuous i mean is yet
[1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:49.640]  child porn if you're 16 and your girlfriend 16
[1:45:49.640 --> 1:45:53.000]  and you have relations according to the police it is
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:56.040]  and they arrest people every week i see articles
[1:45:56.040 --> 1:46:02.120]  because the phone system looks at all of that and they admit they have a i
[1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:06.120]  software that recognizes skin it recognizes
[1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:10.200]  the female body the male body it recognizes those patterns and it flags
[1:46:10.200 --> 1:46:13.480]  it and the perverts at the telecoms sit there and
[1:46:13.480 --> 1:46:17.320]  pull it up and they hand it over to cops
[1:46:17.320 --> 1:46:21.080]  so this is another high-tech version of you know you go to walmart or
[1:46:21.080 --> 1:46:23.000]  eckards or wherever it's happened everywhere
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:27.160]  and it's your 18 month old baby sitting in the bubble bath on the tub

[1:54:26.280 --> 1:54:29.720]  little bit some of the stuff that was posted lately
[1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:33.720]  but they would do stuff like claim if i showed a news article
[1:54:33.720 --> 1:54:37.080]  that that was copyright even to show a news article say here's the austrian
[1:54:37.080 --> 1:54:40.680]  american statesman you know they would file those complaints and things
[1:54:40.680 --> 1:54:43.640]  and the case of the mass shooter up in pennsylvania that we know i showed the
[1:54:43.640 --> 1:54:46.440]  news article and they said oh you can't show that image
[1:54:46.440 --> 1:54:50.360]  uh just amazing so they were looking for reasons to suspend that account
[1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:55.000]  they used a year plus old thing uh because you're supposed to get three
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:58.760]  you know you know two strikes in a year well he didn't have any strikes this

[1:55:07.560 --> 1:55:10.040]  tens i we hadn't counted it up i mean it was

[1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:21.080]  and there were uh over i think it was two thousand plus videos he posted
[1:55:21.080 --> 1:55:26.120]  unbelievable amounts of work that he had done and we would see comments on his
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:29.800]  page the elix jones channel and i would get emails you bastard we're going to

[1:55:37.320 --> 1:55:40.840]  hundreds of other channels that carry our stuff and you know that's why we
[1:55:40.840 --> 1:55:43.400]  didn't just link to the elix jones channel we linked everybody else to
[1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:46.840]  build up their channels and then he started about a month ago knowing this
[1:55:46.840 --> 1:55:49.240]  was coming the info warrior channel for bermas
[1:55:49.240 --> 1:55:51.720]  started trying to clone some of the stuff up there
[1:55:51.720 --> 1:55:57.000]  he went to so much work to do that and uh just know we're under attack folks i
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:00.040]  mean you know it says this account has been suspended
[1:56:00.040 --> 1:56:03.240]  you know people really should call youtube and google and the rest of them
[1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:06.040]  who act like they've got free speech and this is all out in the open
[1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:09.240]  because you know they just and then they always
[1:56:09.240 --> 1:56:14.280]  post the amazing atheist and an american idol on their front page they
[1:56:14.280 --> 1:56:17.400]  push what they want they're already moving away from it being
[1:56:17.400 --> 1:56:21.240]  user content and kind of hiding everybody else's stuff on a subpage and
[1:56:21.240 --> 1:56:26.040]  then the crap they want to push on the main page is what they put out there
[1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:29.800]  but you know we're on the aim and fm dial shortwave internet satellite
[1:56:29.800 --> 1:56:33.640]  genesis you know we are diversified because we've been attacked so much
[1:56:33.640 --> 1:56:38.040]  and so shutting down one youtube channel just lets everybody know
[1:56:38.040 --> 1:56:44.280]  we're the real deal and uh you know there was uh 200 000 views of one of my
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:51.160]  swine flu videos uh where i was uh in there
[1:56:51.160 --> 1:56:54.120]  erin and rob were up until two in the morning so they're not into work yet

[1:57:07.640 --> 1:57:13.240]  that have been watched and uh it's gone but we can always tell folks subscribe
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:18.440]  to another channel and people say oh forget youtube alex just leave youtube
[1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:22.920]  you know go to the smaller channels our stuff is posted everywhere else
[1:57:22.920 --> 1:57:26.600]  but we want to be on youtube because it's the third largest site on the web
[1:57:26.600 --> 1:57:29.560]  and because we can post one of our videos on a little site and get a thousand
[1:57:29.560 --> 1:57:32.680]  views in a month we can post one on youtube and get a million

[2:00:33.560 --> 2:00:39.160]  channel checking out the comments seeing the great videos he posted
[2:00:39.160 --> 2:00:46.120]  and um i noticed there was over a million views just on one page of videos
[2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:50.600]  over a million views
[2:00:51.720 --> 2:00:54.520]  and it's all gone

[2:01:39.400 --> 2:01:41.880]  videos that were on it because most of them got cloned and copied
[2:01:41.880 --> 2:01:44.520]  and to the censorship mixing them with all the videos i've done about web

[2:12:08.680 --> 2:12:12.360]  you bet okay let's go back to that article you wrote in 2007
[2:12:12.360 --> 2:12:16.200]  uh which is uh almost like prophecy with what actually happened
[2:12:16.200 --> 2:12:20.440]  well the in 2007 there was the security and prosperity
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:24.760]  partnership up in monabello high in quibet canada
[2:12:24.760 --> 2:12:28.840]  i was there and what came out of that agreement was a
[2:12:28.840 --> 2:12:32.120]  out of that meeting was a new agreement that was signed by
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:38.600]  canada the united states in mexico which was a north american plan for avian
[2:12:38.600 --> 2:12:43.800]  flu and pandemic influenza and what if the
[2:12:43.800 --> 2:12:47.560]  document agreed to was that if there was going to be an outbreak of avian
[2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:51.400]  flu or any pandemic influenza in north america
[2:12:51.400 --> 2:12:55.320]  a week united states and the canada mexico would handle that
[2:12:55.320 --> 2:13:01.080]  outbreak under the united nations law and i documented
[2:13:01.080 --> 2:13:05.880]  that there is in fact uh the united nations has a coordinator
[2:13:05.880 --> 2:13:09.400]  a un system influenza coordinator who's doctored
[2:13:09.400 --> 2:13:15.160]  dr david nabaro i believe he still is senior policy advisor to the un
[2:13:15.160 --> 2:13:18.120]  director general and the united states has been
[2:13:18.120 --> 2:13:22.360]  moving in this direction for some time in 2005
[2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:27.640]  our president bush announced a new international partnership on avian and
[2:13:27.640 --> 2:13:31.640]  pandemic influenza it was at a high level plenary
[2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:34.040]  meeting at the un general assembly in new york
[2:13:34.040 --> 2:13:38.280]  on september 14 2005 so it's quite clear that
[2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:43.000]  north america has a plan for handling these health emergencies and the plan
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:46.920]  is to go under the blue helmet rule
[2:13:47.720 --> 2:13:52.120]  what it means essentially alex kind of breaking it down
[2:13:52.120 --> 2:13:56.360]  is that the united states is no longer sovereign over health emergency
[2:13:56.360 --> 2:14:00.520]  situations that's the that's the bottom line
[2:14:00.520 --> 2:14:03.400]  are you there alex yes it's i know it's rare for me to actually shut up and
[2:14:03.400 --> 2:14:06.360]  listen to you i'm just uh listening to you go over it
[2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:11.080]  uh please continue in fact it's still the agreement is still on the spp
[2:14:11.080 --> 2:14:14.360]  website if you take a look at the spp doubt
[2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:21.400]  www.spp.gov and you search for the monabello conference until very
[2:14:21.400 --> 2:14:23.560]  recently and i think it's still there today
[2:14:23.560 --> 2:14:27.000]  you can read the agreement that was signed so i mean it's clear
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:30.920]  that this is an international agreement and that uh
[2:14:30.920 --> 2:14:35.560]  a president bush has made us management of a true pandemic situation
[2:14:35.560 --> 2:14:39.160]  subservient to international law
[2:14:40.280 --> 2:14:44.840]  now um i want to expand on that because i mean it's one thing to read you
[2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:47.960]  writing about this a couple years ago from the documents you know you and i
[2:14:47.960 --> 2:14:50.200]  and others of research that we know it's true it's another thing
[2:14:50.200 --> 2:14:54.280]  to see Reuters you know with un in control of global pandemic
[2:14:54.280 --> 2:14:58.440]  un telling mexico u.s canada europe china what to do
[2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:02.280]  this is more just acclimation and that's part one i want you to comment on the
[2:15:02.280 --> 2:15:07.880]  part two fox cnn uh msnbc cbs all yes
[2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:14.520]  martial law uh is a good thing forced inoculation is a good thing we may
[2:15:14.520 --> 2:15:18.120]  lock down us cities but we're going to leave the borders open how
[2:15:18.120 --> 2:15:21.720]  ridiculous is that well and it got you know
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:26.200]  as i point out by the way it is on the spp.gov website i just found it under
[2:15:26.200 --> 2:15:30.920]  the monabello conference uh so far this whole
[2:15:30.920 --> 2:15:36.360]  uh out of swine flu outbreak has turned out to be completely a
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:40.840]  a minor event and there's very few cases of it the cases that are found in
[2:15:40.840 --> 2:15:45.480]  united states are not lethal they're able to be handled by
[2:15:45.480 --> 2:15:49.000]  various kinds of antibiotics that we have on the shelf
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:53.320]  uh the cases that are in mexico are occurring because mexico is largely a
[2:15:53.320 --> 2:15:56.760]  third world country and there aren't even good sanitary conditions
[2:15:56.760 --> 2:16:01.000]  in much of mexico so mexico is going to be more prone to having an
[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:04.760]  outbreak like this uh be a little bit more virulent
[2:16:04.760 --> 2:16:08.360]  but even in mexico there aren't very many cases so so far
[2:16:08.360 --> 2:16:12.680]  i'm categorizing this as just a scare it's an hysteria
[2:16:12.680 --> 2:16:16.920]  now what it does reflect alex is when you look at it
[2:16:16.920 --> 2:16:20.120]  look at the amount of media attention the
[2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:24.280]  going to you know one of the top levels for the world health organization to
[2:16:24.280 --> 2:16:27.800]  declare that this is a pandemic all the
[2:16:27.800 --> 2:16:33.240]  quarantining that's going on in mexico the preparations are clearly in place
[2:16:33.240 --> 2:16:38.280]  for the governments in north america to use a pandemic
[2:16:38.280 --> 2:16:43.240]  fear say oh it's 1918 again there's going to be 30 million people that die
[2:16:43.240 --> 2:16:47.080]  worldwide like happened at the end of world war two with the flu that
[2:16:47.080 --> 2:16:51.080]  spread across the world at that time world war one young world war one
[2:16:51.080 --> 2:16:55.720]  sorry world war one 1918 but there's no evidence whatsoever
[2:16:55.720 --> 2:16:59.880]  that this current outbreak is any more than hysteria
[2:16:59.880 --> 2:17:03.080]  well doc doc i didn't know what your view on this would be but it's it's
[2:17:03.080 --> 2:17:07.480]  identical to mine yeah one i said this is a hoax this is a fraud
[2:17:07.480 --> 2:17:11.640]  but they're using this as a beta test to prepare for martial law
[2:17:11.640 --> 2:17:15.160]  and then they basically come out and said that uh that oh well we know a
[2:17:15.160 --> 2:17:17.720]  mega flu is coming in the next six months or so
[2:17:17.720 --> 2:17:21.800]  that homeland security said and others and this was a good drill for us and
[2:17:21.800 --> 2:17:25.560]  you know we are going to have to forcibly inoculate you and lock down cities
[2:17:25.560 --> 2:17:28.760]  this is perfect to have this while society collapse
[2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:33.160]  while the offshore banks and now bloomberg reports have stolen 14
[2:17:33.160 --> 2:17:36.200]  plus trillion it's now over 12 trillion last time
[2:17:36.200 --> 2:17:39.080]  it was 12 trillion every few months we learned the next you know horrible
[2:17:39.080 --> 2:17:42.840]  number over a trillion a month uh in the last six months since the banker
[2:17:42.840 --> 2:17:47.240]  takeover it's now 14 plus trillion uh in in what they've committed to or spent
[2:17:47.240 --> 2:17:52.200]  and this is a perfect cover now every time a nation rebels are resist oh we
[2:17:52.200 --> 2:17:56.600]  gotta lock everything down a flu popped up whether it kills people or not
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:00.040]  i mean this is amazing well also alex one of the other parts of this that is
[2:18:00.040 --> 2:18:04.360]  important to know law is that it's been accepted in the mainstream media that
[2:18:04.360 --> 2:18:07.320]  all of this is just normal in other words
[2:18:07.320 --> 2:18:11.560]  the possibility of government coming in and shutting down schools
[2:18:11.560 --> 2:18:16.360]  issuing quarantine um even possibly marshal law or
[2:18:16.360 --> 2:18:19.640]  sequestering people who show up as as being
[2:18:19.640 --> 2:18:23.960]  um somehow or other showing symptoms of this disease no they've been setting up
[2:18:23.960 --> 2:18:27.960]  all the ten cities they've been setting it exactly and acting it's a dry run
[2:18:27.960 --> 2:18:31.320]  do you think this is a dry run it certainly has the characteristics of
[2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:36.760]  being a dry rod because you know this much hysteria i i know it's an hysteria
[2:18:36.760 --> 2:18:40.120]  at this point because the cases aren't developing we've had
[2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:43.800]  everybody scared and you know including my own family
[2:18:43.800 --> 2:18:47.800]  frightened to death that this is going to be something that you know we need to
[2:18:47.800 --> 2:18:51.400]  take exceptional measures over and truthfully
[2:18:51.400 --> 2:18:55.160]  uh what there's been one death in the united states for this entire
[2:18:55.160 --> 2:18:58.840]  and that was somebody from mexico city from mexico city you know
[2:18:58.840 --> 2:19:03.480]  we've got uh 300 million people now in the united states and we have
[2:19:03.480 --> 2:19:06.440]  one death of someone who came from mexico city
[2:19:06.440 --> 2:19:10.520]  and yet we have nightly news reporting in the white house coming out with
[2:19:10.520 --> 2:19:15.800]  special announcements we have the military involved i remember
[2:19:15.800 --> 2:19:19.640]  also alex have redone a series of reports on u.s north com
[2:19:19.640 --> 2:19:24.040]  and u.s north com which is a combatant military command
[2:19:24.040 --> 2:19:29.160]  that is tasked with handling u.s emergency situations
[2:19:29.160 --> 2:19:33.480]  count u.s north com has drilled and done exercises on
[2:19:33.480 --> 2:19:38.280]  pandemic influenza outbreaks so that of course he's all there
[2:19:38.280 --> 2:19:42.440]  yeah stay there recap that when we come back i mean you wrote the book on this

[2:24:19.720 --> 2:24:25.560]  ladies and gentlemen we are under united nations control
[2:24:25.560 --> 2:24:31.240]  via treaty during biological releases

[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:39.560]  something dr. course he's also reported on in depth but then we cover in
[2:24:39.560 --> 2:24:47.160]  my films in-game blueprint for global enslavement and others
[2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:52.600]  now dr. coursey you were getting into the fact that north coms roll
[2:24:52.600 --> 2:24:55.480]  and they've signed deals with the canadiens and the mexicans to jointly
[2:24:55.480 --> 2:24:59.720]  use each other's troops during these pandemics and you
[2:24:59.720 --> 2:25:03.480]  have the spp and pastor as you talked about on lew dobb saying
[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:06.760]  we're going to use crises never waste a crisis
[2:25:06.760 --> 2:25:11.880]  to bring this thing in and you saw their response they said as a continent
[2:25:11.880 --> 2:25:16.440]  we've got a respond to this from alaska to uh southern mexico the border of
[2:25:16.440 --> 2:25:20.920]  guatemala we're going to lock down u.s cities maybe
[2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:25.240]  in mexican cities but not the borders how ridiculous is that
[2:25:25.240 --> 2:25:29.640]  well and i think this is i think it again proves the point alex and that is
[2:25:29.640 --> 2:25:32.760]  that the security and prosperity partnership is
[2:25:32.760 --> 2:25:36.840]  designed as a not just an economic to advance the
[2:25:36.840 --> 2:25:40.600]  economic agreement that was nafta into a political agreement
[2:25:40.600 --> 2:25:44.200]  and the political agreement advances international law
[2:25:44.200 --> 2:25:48.600]  so that of course they don't be you know under spp the border is going to be
[2:25:48.600 --> 2:25:51.400]  kept open because that's a primary agreement
[2:25:51.400 --> 2:25:55.080]  of the security and prosperity partnership agreement and then when
[2:25:55.080 --> 2:26:01.240]  you've got this avian flu and pandemic influenza spp agreement
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:06.360]  it puts everything under the united nation the north american plan
[2:26:06.360 --> 2:26:10.760]  is under united nations and world health organization guidelines
[2:26:10.760 --> 2:26:14.040]  and that's just clear the standards and guidelines of the world health
[2:26:14.040 --> 2:26:17.000]  organization and the rules of the world
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:21.720]  you know are the other rules that in north america would apply
[2:26:21.720 --> 2:26:25.640]  to the management of any health pandemic or health crisis
[2:26:25.640 --> 2:26:29.480]  and he was military which has agreements with canadian military
[2:26:29.480 --> 2:26:33.400]  is ready to act in a capacity if there should be an emergency situation
[2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:38.120]  remember alex i also reported that under these homeland security and
[2:26:38.120 --> 2:26:41.960]  national security directive that were issued by president
[2:26:41.960 --> 2:26:45.960]  bush i believe in 2007 it was i i'd have to go to get the exact
[2:26:45.960 --> 2:26:50.200]  numbers but homeland security directive 51 and i can look those up here in a
[2:26:50.200 --> 2:26:53.320]  minute john warner defense authorization act
[2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:56.920]  that all of these well these two specific directors that i wrote about
[2:26:56.920 --> 2:27:01.480]  give the president the opportunity to declare an emergency including a
[2:27:01.480 --> 2:27:05.000]  health emergency under the president's own authority
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:09.240]  without necessarily getting concurrence from congress no in fact congress isn't
[2:27:09.240 --> 2:27:12.760]  allowed to see those agreements and that's why they're angry and upset
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:16.520]  uh... and that's one agreement have gone through congress including the spp
[2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:21.480]  document that agree that there was a north american plan for
[2:27:21.480 --> 2:27:26.600]  avian and pandemic influenza that did not go to congress to get approved
[2:27:26.600 --> 2:27:30.440]  on order these two presidential directors that were signed by president
[2:27:30.440 --> 2:27:34.680]  bush go to congress to get approved so the president could declare a health
[2:27:34.680 --> 2:27:38.840]  emergency i could say the world trade organization rules
[2:27:38.840 --> 2:27:41.960]  apply and blue helmets are available if needed
[2:27:41.960 --> 2:27:47.640]  and task for the department of defense the uh... u.s. north com
[2:27:47.640 --> 2:27:52.760]  to utilize military in situations that could be quarantined or
[2:27:52.760 --> 2:27:56.520]  martial law or whatever was else required for the health emergency
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:00.040]  and dr corcy they've been saying this on the news
[2:28:00.040 --> 2:28:04.600]  talking about foreign assets north com forced inoculations lockdowns of cities
[2:28:04.600 --> 2:28:07.560]  but oh no we'll never lock down the border i'm not even saying lock it down
[2:28:07.560 --> 2:28:11.800]  for this the point is they just say that is absolutely sacrosanct
[2:28:11.800 --> 2:28:15.480]  you don't touch that that's a taboo but if you want to lock down u.s. cities
[2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:19.240]  that's wonderful uh... and and and clearly the u n said greatest threat
[2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:23.320]  ever facing humanity in ninety years could kill millions could kill billions
[2:28:23.320 --> 2:28:27.400]  absolute fair mongering so my family took it serious to use in your family
[2:28:27.400 --> 2:28:30.120]  people are like me on my wife's like let's do something let's be safe and i
[2:28:30.120 --> 2:28:32.280]  said okay we'll play it safe
[2:28:32.280 --> 2:28:35.800]  even though the government does cry wolf you still have to take it serious
[2:28:35.800 --> 2:28:38.040]  when they say this could be the worst thing
[2:28:38.040 --> 2:28:42.040]  you know since that all hitler basically uh... but clearly they're now admitting
[2:28:42.040 --> 2:28:48.200]  this is a psi op to beta test martial law which they need to psi op test
[2:28:48.200 --> 2:28:51.400]  because clearly we're going into this worldwide economic collapse
[2:28:51.400 --> 2:28:55.640]  well here's the evidence that i know is the case okay so first of all
[2:28:55.640 --> 2:28:58.760]  now we're having the government coming out and saying
[2:28:58.760 --> 2:29:02.520]  uh... mexico has announced that the end h one and one
[2:29:02.520 --> 2:29:08.280]  flu epidemic they won't call swine flu anymore the mexico says his past peak
[2:29:08.280 --> 2:29:12.680]  uh... the u.s. government the world health organization however says
[2:29:12.680 --> 2:29:17.240]  we shouldn't lower our guard okay yet at the same time
[2:29:17.240 --> 2:29:21.320]  it appears to be no more severe than the normal flu in fact the normal flu i
[2:29:21.320 --> 2:29:25.160]  mean if you have the statistics kill more people on average flu season that
[2:29:25.160 --> 2:29:29.080]  this n one h one virus is going to kill all together
[2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:32.840]  why stay there no it does we have thirty six thousand die a year some say it's
[2:29:32.840 --> 2:29:35.720]  really fifteen but the government cdc says thirty six thousand
[2:29:35.720 --> 2:29:40.120]  more than that died mexico uh... quarter of a million died worldwide on average
[2:29:40.120 --> 2:29:43.800]  each year from flu and we've had less than fifty people die from this thing
[2:29:43.800 --> 2:29:47.160]  worldwide and a couple thousand six so
[2:29:47.160 --> 2:29:50.440]  clearly this is the model of global tyranny they're going to use stay there
[2:29:50.440 --> 2:29:55.320]  dr corsey we're on the march the empires on the run

[2:33:47.480 --> 2:33:51.320]  you write i write about pdd-51 how they'll use
[2:33:51.320 --> 2:33:54.200]  flu pandemics to set up the north american union and
[2:33:54.200 --> 2:33:58.040]  expand police state they're openly saying forced inoculation
[2:33:58.040 --> 2:34:03.720]  roundups arrest troops the kentucky derby has regular army arresting fans that
[2:34:03.720 --> 2:34:07.560]  jumped on the track after the horse won saturday that's
[2:34:07.560 --> 2:34:11.240]  in the news the troops are on the streets north com 20 000
[2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:15.720]  troops homeland brigade all of the stuff that
[2:34:15.720 --> 2:34:19.640]  i particularly talked about 10 12 13 years ago is now openly
[2:34:19.640 --> 2:34:23.320]  out there and people then still email me saying don't fear longer about the
[2:34:23.320 --> 2:34:27.240]  troops you know this is completely normal to have troops running around
[2:34:27.240 --> 2:34:29.560]  then three weeks ago you may not know about this
[2:34:29.560 --> 2:34:32.760]  tennessee governor found out because of this show about military checkpoints
[2:34:32.760 --> 2:34:36.120]  they were running in the newspapers and the military when the governor said
[2:34:36.120 --> 2:34:39.400]  don't do it the military said we don't care
[2:34:39.400 --> 2:34:42.920]  we're going to go ahead and do it and they did it dr. Corsi
[2:34:42.920 --> 2:34:47.160]  i mean this is getting to be out of control the two directors i wrote about
[2:34:47.160 --> 2:34:51.160]  in and i wrote about the in may 2007 they were the
[2:34:51.160 --> 2:34:56.040]  on national security presidential directive 51 and homeland security
[2:34:56.040 --> 2:35:00.760]  presidential directive 20 which established under this new office
[2:35:00.760 --> 2:35:04.440]  office of national continuity coordinator continuity of government
[2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:08.440]  theme that the president could declare a
[2:35:08.440 --> 2:35:12.280]  an emergency a catastrophic emergency and assume
[2:35:12.280 --> 2:35:15.720]  control of the operation of all levels of government federal state local
[2:35:15.720 --> 2:35:20.920]  territorial and tribal as well as private sector organizations
[2:35:20.920 --> 2:35:24.440]  that would be to continue functioning under the president's directives in the
[2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:28.600]  event of a national emergency without going to congress
[2:35:28.600 --> 2:35:33.320]  so those are those are there those remain powers now that
[2:35:33.320 --> 2:35:38.440]  president obama could exercise and again there was no congressional vote
[2:35:38.440 --> 2:35:42.520]  approving or affirming these presidential directors they were done
[2:35:42.520 --> 2:35:46.920]  strictly on the signature of president bush i also
[2:35:46.920 --> 2:35:50.280]  like to remind everyone if you do a very careful analysis
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:53.720]  there's a lot of these issues where president obama is identical to president
[2:35:53.720 --> 2:35:57.560]  bush uh... the uh... the grabbing of power
[2:35:57.560 --> 2:36:01.320]  the willingness to have this north american union of caution people
[2:36:01.320 --> 2:36:04.120]  that uh... president obama would
[2:36:04.120 --> 2:36:08.440]  uh... break his campaign promises to renegotiate nafta
[2:36:08.440 --> 2:36:12.680]  uh... those were just campaign promises that were issued when president
[2:36:12.680 --> 2:36:16.040]  would have been candidate will bomb was campaigning in states like michigan
[2:36:16.040 --> 2:36:20.520]  and ohio where he wanted the votes of people who had lost their jobs to
[2:36:20.520 --> 2:36:23.320]  outsourcing the foreign government
[2:36:23.320 --> 2:36:27.320]  uh... and you know the foreign countries rather under nafta and our
[2:36:27.320 --> 2:36:30.120]  world trade organization other international
[2:36:30.120 --> 2:36:33.080]  correct error international free trade agreement
[2:36:33.080 --> 2:36:36.520]  so now austin ghoulsby you remember that the
[2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:40.360]  candidate obama was all advised by
[2:36:40.360 --> 2:36:44.200]  professor austin ghoulsby who was fired by the campaign
[2:36:44.200 --> 2:36:48.840]  when he was discovered to have gone to candidate said wink wink don't worry
[2:36:48.840 --> 2:36:51.720]  when candidate obama becomes president obama
[2:36:51.720 --> 2:36:56.320]  he will not renegotiate nafta well austin ghoulsby now rehired
[2:36:56.320 --> 2:37:00.120]  and he's working with the council of economic advisors within the white house
[2:37:00.120 --> 2:37:02.920]  so this is all but a wink wink game and
[2:37:02.920 --> 2:37:05.640]  uh... everything that president
[2:37:05.640 --> 2:37:07.600]  bush dead or more
[2:37:07.600 --> 2:37:10.520]  to create open borders integrate north america
[2:37:10.520 --> 2:37:14.320]  and i think like great u s a is going to be done by president obama
[2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:18.120]  including reintroducing comprehensive immigration reform
[2:37:18.120 --> 2:37:22.160]  which was again president bush's push so i see no difference
[2:37:22.160 --> 2:37:25.400]  whatsoever between president bush and president obama
[2:37:25.400 --> 2:37:28.240]  on north american integration they're both globalist
[2:37:28.240 --> 2:37:31.280]  and they're both on the agenda to create a north american union from all the
[2:37:31.280 --> 2:37:34.480]  evidence i can see
[2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:35.800]  absolutely
[2:37:35.800 --> 2:37:38.200]  uh...
[2:37:38.200 --> 2:37:42.720]  you know they are doing this incrementally they are boiling us like a
[2:37:42.720 --> 2:37:45.080]  frog in the uh... bucket of water
[2:37:45.080 --> 2:37:46.400]  for those that don't know you
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:51.040]  and it's true i've talked to folks uh... who eat frogs in louisiana mississippi
[2:37:51.040 --> 2:37:51.600]  and they
[2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:53.720]  and that's where the stories come from
[2:37:53.720 --> 2:37:57.240]  you put a frog in cold water and slowly turn it up
[2:37:57.240 --> 2:38:00.640]  he will sit there like it's a hot tub until it's boiling and die without
[2:38:00.640 --> 2:38:01.640]  jumping out
[2:38:01.640 --> 2:38:04.800]  but you throw a frog in the ball and water he'll jump right out
[2:38:04.800 --> 2:38:06.400]  and it's a synchronism
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:10.240]  people are like where's the marshal law alex where's the police state
[2:38:10.240 --> 2:38:13.360]  where's the north american union where where is it i'm like
[2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:16.160]  do you see the troops with side arms arresting people
[2:38:16.160 --> 2:38:18.440]  at the kentucky derby regular army
[2:38:18.440 --> 2:38:21.320]  do you see the super bowl with troops do you see troops at the shooting in
[2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:22.320]  alabama
[2:38:22.320 --> 2:38:25.000]  do you see troops at d w i checkpoints
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:25.920]  uh... now
[2:38:25.920 --> 2:38:29.480]  do you see him with the jaws of life at car wrecks all for p r
[2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:33.520]  uh... do you see them uh... using the patriot act in non-terror related cases
[2:38:33.520 --> 2:38:37.120]  and violating due process everywhere do you see obama saying he's gonna sign a
[2:38:37.120 --> 2:38:37.920]  treaty
[2:38:37.920 --> 2:38:41.040]  and i try to uh... push it through congress to literally ban guns in the
[2:38:41.040 --> 2:38:42.520]  words of seeing and
[2:38:42.520 --> 2:38:45.800]  uh... i'd read the thing that hadn't gotten that bad of interpretation though
[2:38:45.800 --> 2:38:48.160]  it does devastate the second amendment
[2:38:48.160 --> 2:38:50.040]  all of this is going on
[2:38:50.040 --> 2:38:53.000]  what this does i mean what the this whole
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:55.840]  hope to this i think it's clearly a hope this
[2:38:55.840 --> 2:38:58.960]  swine flu or n one h one virus
[2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:02.680]  what it does is it prepares people for being
[2:39:02.680 --> 2:39:04.340]  so scared
[2:39:04.340 --> 2:39:06.880]  that they are ready to accept
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:09.280]  uh... military involvement
[2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:13.240]  the u n involvement the world health organizations involvement is not
[2:39:13.240 --> 2:39:14.560]  questioned
[2:39:14.560 --> 2:39:18.320]  and military involvement if the president declares it
[2:39:18.320 --> 2:39:20.040]  the fact that this is a whole
[2:39:20.040 --> 2:39:21.360]  you've got now
[2:39:21.360 --> 2:39:24.480]  the world health organizations crambling
[2:39:24.480 --> 2:39:26.040]  they're now
[2:39:26.040 --> 2:39:29.200]  what would i see absolutely no basis here in
[2:39:29.200 --> 2:39:31.840]  the science of the history of
[2:39:31.840 --> 2:39:34.520]  viruses they're not trying to argue
[2:39:34.520 --> 2:39:38.160]  that you know it going from person to pick in a jump back
[2:39:38.160 --> 2:39:41.960]  that's a story that's being reported right now by the associated prayer also
[2:39:41.960 --> 2:39:46.560]  saying it may mutate with other viruses are mutated on its own and become
[2:39:46.560 --> 2:39:51.160]  hyper deadly for the fallen winners so you better take the vaccine they're
[2:39:51.160 --> 2:39:52.800]  going to have ready for that
[2:39:52.800 --> 2:39:57.040]  and also the you know if you take a look at the history of what's been done
[2:39:57.040 --> 2:39:59.880]  under the security and prosperity partnership all the preparedness for
[2:39:59.880 --> 2:40:00.960]  the last
[2:40:00.960 --> 2:40:04.760]  ten years it's all been on avian flu
[2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:08.320]  uh... the swine flu issue has not been considered
[2:40:08.320 --> 2:40:12.160]  to be a major threat now they've revived swine flu that's now
[2:40:12.160 --> 2:40:13.760]  the public mind
[2:40:13.760 --> 2:40:17.920]  uh... and they're trying to get these viruses just to have numbers not names
[2:40:17.920 --> 2:40:21.080]  and it seems to me the next argument is going to be that they can
[2:40:21.080 --> 2:40:25.240]  go between bird they go between pigs they go between humans
[2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:29.560]  and it's all largely a scare we have not had
[2:40:29.560 --> 2:40:33.080]  since nineteen eighteen at the end of world war one
[2:40:33.080 --> 2:40:34.760]  a pandemic
[2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:36.040]  that has caused
[2:40:36.040 --> 2:40:39.640]  billions of deaths around the world
[2:40:39.640 --> 2:40:43.920]  this preparedness for it seems to be all out of proportion
[2:40:43.920 --> 2:40:47.840]  to any reality of a health emergency that has ever occurred
[2:40:47.840 --> 2:40:50.960]  yeah it's clearly in fact they're even admitting that between the lines are
[2:40:50.960 --> 2:40:51.920]  saying well
[2:40:51.920 --> 2:40:54.200]  even though this may not be that bad
[2:40:54.200 --> 2:41:00.040]  uh... it's still a good drill because a newer deadlier one will come
[2:41:00.040 --> 2:41:03.640]  mean the pollutano said that last sunday she said that seven eight days ago
[2:41:03.640 --> 2:41:05.920]  well they are two things that make absolutely no sense
[2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:07.240]  alexa that
[2:41:07.240 --> 2:41:08.760]  if this were
[2:41:08.760 --> 2:41:13.640]  truly a health emergency and the focus were to protect u.s. citizen
[2:41:13.640 --> 2:41:16.920]  the first thing you would do is close the border with mexico
[2:41:16.920 --> 2:41:19.960]  that'd be absolutely the first thing you'd have to do to make sure that it was
[2:41:19.960 --> 2:41:21.160]  contained
[2:41:21.160 --> 2:41:25.120]  china has virtually done that china's restricting flights to mexico
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:29.960]  china is evidently rounding up mexicans and putting them in quarantine in china
[2:41:29.960 --> 2:41:32.200]  people traveled from mexico
[2:41:32.200 --> 2:41:34.700]  but we're not doing it in the united states
[2:41:34.700 --> 2:41:37.320]  so it's clearly in the united states not
[2:41:37.320 --> 2:41:39.560]  considered to be
[2:41:39.560 --> 2:41:43.320]  something that is about uh... u.s. national security is not the first
[2:41:43.320 --> 2:41:45.000]  priority in our response
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:49.080]  you've got a lot of mental response stop stop let me start over
[2:41:49.080 --> 2:41:51.920]  you just hit the zeitgeist doctor course enough the point i've been hammering
[2:41:51.920 --> 2:41:54.720]  but but i mean say it in your own words and break down the different facets
[2:41:54.720 --> 2:41:56.120]  from your perspective
[2:41:56.120 --> 2:41:58.280]  again i'm gonna say this slowly
[2:41:58.280 --> 2:42:03.080]  they said day one over a week ago they said that it's already spread everywhere
[2:42:03.080 --> 2:42:06.560]  so there's no reason to lock down the border even though the supposed
[2:42:06.560 --> 2:42:10.520]  main vector of something threatening the entire future
[2:42:10.520 --> 2:42:12.320]  of society
[2:42:12.320 --> 2:42:16.480]  uh... was about to come up here now now their argument was it's already spread
[2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:18.080]  outside the country so it doesn't matter
[2:42:18.080 --> 2:42:20.460]  but any new cases out of mexico
[2:42:20.460 --> 2:42:24.500]  if it was so deadly would continue to cause entirely new
[2:42:24.500 --> 2:42:26.620]  uh... uh... you know spreads of it
[2:42:26.620 --> 2:42:29.240]  so that's right so so so day one
[2:42:29.240 --> 2:42:30.160]  they said
[2:42:30.160 --> 2:42:33.840]  it's already spread forget it border stays wide open plane stand the air
[2:42:33.840 --> 2:42:36.360]  from mexico the main vector but
[2:42:36.360 --> 2:42:40.120]  we may have to lock down u.s. cities they did lock down some houses and homes
[2:42:40.120 --> 2:42:41.320]  and hotels and things
[2:42:41.320 --> 2:42:42.520]  and airplanes
[2:42:42.520 --> 2:42:46.200]  we may have and and grab reporters and wouldn't test them for it but held them
[2:42:46.200 --> 2:42:47.160]  for a week
[2:42:47.160 --> 2:42:49.200]  so so so think about this day
[2:42:49.200 --> 2:42:52.800]  they fear-mongered and hype like it was the end of the world
[2:42:52.800 --> 2:42:55.320]  the movie twenty eight days later
[2:42:55.320 --> 2:42:57.200]  then at the same time
[2:42:57.200 --> 2:42:58.920]  in their actions
[2:42:58.920 --> 2:43:02.380]  uh... here in the united states it was like it was no big deal so
[2:43:02.380 --> 2:43:05.220]  so just amazing i mean flesh that out
[2:43:05.220 --> 2:43:06.820]  well clearly
[2:43:06.820 --> 2:43:09.560]  additional people were coming from mexico with
[2:43:09.560 --> 2:43:11.480]  contamination that could be
[2:43:11.480 --> 2:43:13.880]  spread dollars which is
[2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:17.840]  key component of how this virus is post spread
[2:43:17.840 --> 2:43:19.600]  uh... person to person
[2:43:19.600 --> 2:43:21.040]  well then you would want to
[2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:22.920]  block the border and keep
[2:43:22.920 --> 2:43:25.840]  infected people from from coming across if
[2:43:25.840 --> 2:43:29.360]  national security united states were and health security with the primary
[2:43:29.360 --> 2:43:30.280]  objective
[2:43:30.280 --> 2:43:31.680]  it's not
[2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:35.080]  because by keeping the border open except the risk
[2:43:35.080 --> 2:43:39.160]  that others infected in mexico will come into the united states even if the
[2:43:39.160 --> 2:43:40.440]  legal immigrants
[2:43:40.440 --> 2:43:42.200]  and spread the disease
[2:43:42.200 --> 2:43:44.320]  so clearly it's a lie
[2:43:44.320 --> 2:43:48.400]  that national security or health security of the united states is the
[2:43:48.400 --> 2:43:52.020]  number one objective of the u.s. government responding to the health
[2:43:52.020 --> 2:43:53.160]  emergency
[2:43:53.160 --> 2:43:57.320]  we're responding on a continental basis in which we keep the border open
[2:43:57.320 --> 2:44:01.520]  secondly i'd like to have an estimate alex of the economic
[2:44:01.520 --> 2:44:04.040]  damage done by this whole
[2:44:04.040 --> 2:44:05.480]  in other words how many
[2:44:05.480 --> 2:44:09.720]  conventions were cancelled how many trips were canceled what's the damage
[2:44:09.720 --> 2:44:10.640]  in terms of
[2:44:10.640 --> 2:44:11.680]  not only the
[2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:14.440]  vacation industry in the travel industry
[2:44:14.440 --> 2:44:18.480]  but what's what's the damage overall to international business
[2:44:18.480 --> 2:44:21.440]  uh... mexico was just about been shut down now
[2:44:21.440 --> 2:44:24.960]  i'm anticipating the very next thing we're going to see is that we need
[2:44:24.960 --> 2:44:28.360]  economic aid to mexico suddenly mexico is going to become our
[2:44:28.360 --> 2:44:29.880]  responsibility
[2:44:29.880 --> 2:44:34.560]  to have some kind of repayment to mexico already happened already happened
[2:44:34.560 --> 2:44:37.680]  already happen they're saying forty seven billion
[2:44:37.680 --> 2:44:41.800]  i am a f s d r is the first money out of the new global
[2:44:41.800 --> 2:44:44.360]  currency if those that don't know you won't see
[2:44:44.360 --> 2:44:47.720]  these s d r's you know floating around at mcdonald's or your bank
[2:44:47.720 --> 2:44:50.320]  these are interbank lending governmental lending
[2:44:50.320 --> 2:44:54.160]  uh... forty seven billion s d r's already being drawn on
[2:44:54.160 --> 2:44:56.240]  by mexico and talk
[2:44:56.240 --> 2:44:59.040]  of the united states in europe paying for those
[2:44:59.040 --> 2:45:01.000]  because of the crisis
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:05.280]  well there you go see this also the international monetary fund with these
[2:45:05.280 --> 2:45:09.360]  s d r's i've been reporting on that expensive late extensively
[2:45:09.360 --> 2:45:13.080]  also be very expensive i've been pouring out that this is the new
[2:45:13.080 --> 2:45:17.080]  international currency that china wants to replace the dollar
[2:45:17.080 --> 2:45:19.960]  as a standard of foreign exchange reserves
[2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:23.120]  now they can be if the s d r's can be used
[2:45:23.120 --> 2:45:26.880]  uh... in in mexico to be handled economic damage
[2:45:26.880 --> 2:45:29.440]  done by the swine flu and there's no
[2:45:29.440 --> 2:45:32.080]  that wasn't what china was proposing
[2:45:32.080 --> 2:45:35.120]  but i see here even uh... even
[2:45:35.120 --> 2:45:37.320]  bloomberg is reporting
[2:45:37.320 --> 2:45:40.120]  and has been reporting to table twenty eight
[2:45:40.120 --> 2:45:43.640]  that mexico will draw forty seven billion line of credit from the
[2:45:43.640 --> 2:45:48.760]  i m f on these s d r's to handle the swine flu
[2:45:48.760 --> 2:45:51.480]  so there you are i mean this is the
[2:45:51.480 --> 2:45:55.280]  you know that there's an economic agenda here which advances
[2:45:55.280 --> 2:45:59.120]  the use of the international monetary fund is being a
[2:45:59.120 --> 2:46:03.180]  alternative to the world bank for creating a new world currency
[2:46:03.180 --> 2:46:07.440]  there's a lot of agendas here if the what's clear
[2:46:07.440 --> 2:46:11.360]  you look at just the number of illnesses and fatalities they are so
[2:46:11.360 --> 2:46:12.960]  minimal
[2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:17.120]  that the the cost should be going back on the obama administration
[2:46:17.120 --> 2:46:19.400]  for having scared everyone
[2:46:19.400 --> 2:46:24.400]  and the fact that that's not happening just shows how convincingly this agenda
[2:46:24.400 --> 2:46:27.800]  of fear can be put forward even when
[2:46:27.800 --> 2:46:31.400]  there's no reaction there's no disease there's so like a
[2:46:31.400 --> 2:46:34.120]  less than a normal fluid inconsequential
[2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:37.240]  so from the globalist perspective doctor court c
[2:46:37.240 --> 2:46:40.000]  we have passed the test the fear-mongering
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:41.960]  from something that killed
[2:46:41.960 --> 2:46:44.200]  thousands of times less
[2:46:44.200 --> 2:46:47.840]  what a regular round the mill flu does literally we're talking
[2:46:47.840 --> 2:46:51.380]  conservatively two hundred fifty thousand people die a year according to the
[2:46:51.380 --> 2:46:55.240]  world health organization globally sometimes much as five hundred thousand
[2:46:55.240 --> 2:46:58.680]  and you go back to the old pandemics forty million in in one year with the
[2:46:58.680 --> 2:46:59.720]  swine flu but
[2:46:59.720 --> 2:47:00.840]  in a normal year
[2:47:00.840 --> 2:47:02.360]  quarter million people
[2:47:02.360 --> 2:47:03.960]  died from
[2:47:03.960 --> 2:47:05.960]  the regular flu
[2:47:05.960 --> 2:47:07.000]  this thing
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:12.720]  has killed uh... literally one one thousand of a regular year probably
[2:47:12.720 --> 2:47:16.120]  and meanwhile that's like it was in the world we gotta have global government
[2:47:16.120 --> 2:47:17.520]  force inoculations
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:19.800]  locked down u s cities
[2:47:19.800 --> 2:47:23.400]  but the borders stay wide open none of this makes any sense
[2:47:23.400 --> 2:47:28.160]  uh... so i guess we've passed the test according to the globalist we are ready
[2:47:28.160 --> 2:47:31.800]  to really give up all of our liberty if we'll give up all of our liberty for a
[2:47:31.800 --> 2:47:33.480]  fake flu
[2:47:33.480 --> 2:47:36.680]  imagine if somebody in government side the new world order
[2:47:36.680 --> 2:47:40.760]  releases something real doctor corcy
[2:47:40.760 --> 2:47:44.280]  well the next time this happens it's going to have to be
[2:47:44.280 --> 2:47:47.280]  public is not going to react immediately
[2:47:47.280 --> 2:47:50.040]  these kind of warnings all of these warnings are put out in a way that is
[2:47:50.040 --> 2:47:52.400]  very frightening they're very frightening in there
[2:47:52.400 --> 2:47:54.280]  and people immediately
[2:47:54.280 --> 2:47:55.440]  become you know they
[2:47:55.440 --> 2:47:57.000]  flash to
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:01.360]  plague ideas or the nineteen eighteen fluent influenza
[2:48:01.360 --> 2:48:04.520]  we have not had a pandemic
[2:48:04.520 --> 2:48:06.080]  nineteen eighteen even the
[2:48:06.080 --> 2:48:08.720]  cars outbreak out of china
[2:48:08.720 --> 2:48:09.920]  was minor
[2:48:09.920 --> 2:48:13.080]  in terms of the world population or terms of the number of people who were
[2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:13.920]  sick
[2:48:13.920 --> 2:48:17.080]  this is not nineteen eighteen people are
[2:48:17.080 --> 2:48:19.560]  will talk more effectively inoculated
[2:48:19.560 --> 2:48:23.560]  other much more effectively exposed to clues
[2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:24.920]  uh... i i have
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:28.240]  believe from the beginning expected from the beginning that these
[2:48:28.240 --> 2:48:33.760]  uh... avian and swine and other flues are largely a scare and a hoax
[2:48:33.760 --> 2:48:37.800]  which has no basis in medical reality i don't see any basis for it
[2:48:37.800 --> 2:48:40.260]  except the cell vaccines antivirals
[2:48:40.260 --> 2:48:45.400]  and is that all of us to a great to get new power grab that the government can
[2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:47.400]  do on a
[2:48:47.400 --> 2:48:51.840]  transnational international basis where the world health organization is more
[2:48:51.840 --> 2:48:53.960]  credible now in the u n
[2:48:53.960 --> 2:48:57.880]  because uh... there somehow or other of the authorities
[2:48:57.880 --> 2:49:02.080]  i don't see that the u n is going to protect americans not when
[2:49:02.080 --> 2:49:04.760]  the borders wide open and it's clear
[2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:07.000]  that the disease
[2:49:07.000 --> 2:49:11.200]  you know i thought the hypothesis is that these comes from mexico and it's
[2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:13.480]  transmitted person to person
[2:49:13.480 --> 2:49:17.320]  and yet the borders kept wide open it makes absolutely no sense at all
[2:49:17.320 --> 2:49:21.040]  will talk about this and i thought there's gotta be another explanation
[2:49:21.040 --> 2:49:24.680]  absolutely will talk i mean take that the u n you know how it works for those
[2:49:24.680 --> 2:49:26.680]  that don't know how it works
[2:49:26.680 --> 2:49:29.760]  the u n has its general assembly that really doesn't have the power
[2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:33.040]  and then you have the g eight within it that that really do have the power
[2:49:33.040 --> 2:49:37.080]  but then different sub-units of of the u n structure
[2:49:37.080 --> 2:49:41.880]  uh... like uh... the world health organization is quasi-private
[2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:45.040]  and if you go research it most its funding is ford foundation rocker
[2:49:45.040 --> 2:49:46.240]  feller foundation
[2:49:46.240 --> 2:49:48.440]  their eugenesis their globalist their
[2:49:48.440 --> 2:49:51.480]  population reductionist uh... climate change
[2:49:51.480 --> 2:49:55.360]  uh... you know pushers of this new religion they brag it's a new religion
[2:49:55.360 --> 2:49:57.400]  they say the public needs one
[2:49:57.400 --> 2:49:58.780]  uh... so
[2:49:58.780 --> 2:49:59.960]  when you look at the
[2:49:59.960 --> 2:50:03.000]  the who now being the central commander
[2:50:03.000 --> 2:50:06.280]  this is really the private foundations in the n g o's
[2:50:06.280 --> 2:50:07.680]  private corporations
[2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:09.520]  using the u n
[2:50:09.520 --> 2:50:12.760]  uh... as their mechanism
[2:50:12.760 --> 2:50:16.520]  no doubt that the u n is right at the center of this and it's a power grab them
[2:50:16.520 --> 2:50:18.520]  on behalf of the u n
[2:50:18.520 --> 2:50:19.520]  the u n
[2:50:19.520 --> 2:50:24.560]  uh... is probably the last organization the world i'd want to be involved
[2:50:24.560 --> 2:50:27.200]  if there really were a worldwide
[2:50:27.200 --> 2:50:28.800]  health epidemic
[2:50:28.800 --> 2:50:32.040]  uh... because the u n would not necessarily make any decisions that
[2:50:32.040 --> 2:50:32.840]  would
[2:50:32.840 --> 2:50:35.320]  be in favor of protecting health
[2:50:35.320 --> 2:50:36.800]  of america
[2:50:36.800 --> 2:50:41.840]  the perspective of the u n is worldwide and it has its own agenda which is to
[2:50:41.840 --> 2:50:43.440]  grab power
[2:50:43.440 --> 2:50:47.160]  i don't think that the u n has anything has ever made decisions within these
[2:50:47.160 --> 2:50:48.800]  various organizations
[2:50:48.800 --> 2:50:52.720]  for the primary interest is u s national security or u s economic or health

[2:54:19.360 --> 2:54:24.400]  just for even coming on this wicked radio show and uh... talking about
[2:54:24.400 --> 2:54:27.520]  the facts that sometimes governments do stage events are allowed us to take
[2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:29.880]  place at the Gulf of Tonkin and things
[2:54:29.880 --> 2:54:33.520]  uh... we've now had a bunch of mainstream talk show host including michael
[2:54:33.520 --> 2:54:35.560]  savage
[2:54:35.560 --> 2:54:39.080]  uh... we've had alan keys come out we can play the clips saying
[2:54:39.080 --> 2:54:42.520]  they're concerned obama will stage a terror attack or
[2:54:42.520 --> 2:54:44.920]  some type of other disaster
[2:54:44.920 --> 2:54:47.520]  uh... ron paul has said that here on the show
[2:54:47.520 --> 2:54:50.160]  in case you haven't heard michael savage let me just play a clip of this right
[2:54:50.160 --> 2:54:50.640]  now
[2:54:50.640 --> 2:54:52.600]  here's michael savage about a month ago
[2:54:52.600 --> 2:54:56.800]  now i'll make another prediction and i predict that very soon
[2:54:56.800 --> 2:55:00.760]  obama will create a crisis along the lines of the right stock for a right
[2:55:00.760 --> 2:55:02.080]  stock fire
[2:55:02.080 --> 2:55:03.880]  i don't know what format will take
[2:55:03.880 --> 2:55:07.320]  but i believe that once the minions are seen for what they are
[2:55:07.320 --> 2:55:11.160]  rama manuel and his gang will set off a right stock fire in this country of
[2:55:11.160 --> 2:55:12.440]  some kind
[2:55:12.440 --> 2:55:15.800]  and they will recall the military dictatorship of lincoln and stand and
[2:55:15.800 --> 2:55:17.080]  during the civil war
[2:55:17.080 --> 2:55:20.360]  when civil civilian suspects were arrested without warrant
[2:55:20.360 --> 2:55:24.080]  i will tell you as i sit here i fear that every night as i go to sleep
[2:55:24.080 --> 2:55:26.360]  i have nothing past these agitators
[2:55:26.360 --> 2:55:28.560]  who have suddenly stop right there
[2:55:28.560 --> 2:55:32.360]  i mean if you look at the military build up the police state all of this i mean
[2:55:32.360 --> 2:55:35.640]  in the the federal reports that came out doctor court see
[2:55:35.640 --> 2:55:38.440]  uh... shangha number one threat are veterans and gun owners that were
[2:55:38.440 --> 2:55:39.520]  terrorist
[2:55:39.520 --> 2:55:43.000]  and the whole home was pretty system was built for american patriots
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:45.400]  what do you think about what savage and others are saying
[2:55:45.400 --> 2:55:48.680]  well if it's a very frightening scenario and i think the
[2:55:48.680 --> 2:55:53.080]  what i know is that the military apparatus the emergency
[2:55:53.080 --> 2:55:56.120]  uh... powers of the president c through these
[2:55:56.120 --> 2:55:59.080]  homeland security national security directive the president bush put in
[2:55:59.080 --> 2:56:02.440]  place now all available to president obama
[2:56:02.440 --> 2:56:07.160]  given unprecedented level of authority for the u.s. military to be involved in
[2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:09.200]  domestic emergency
[2:56:09.200 --> 2:56:10.840]  and what this
[2:56:10.840 --> 2:56:12.600]  recent swine flu
[2:56:12.600 --> 2:56:14.360]  i think hysteria
[2:56:14.360 --> 2:56:17.680]  proves that the american people will accept
[2:56:17.680 --> 2:56:19.200]  any level of
[2:56:19.200 --> 2:56:22.120]  government control military involvement
[2:56:22.120 --> 2:56:26.120]  if the people are scared into thinking there's a health
[2:56:26.120 --> 2:56:27.840]  of a major proportion
[2:56:27.840 --> 2:56:31.640]  now that we could get this far this much news this much attention as much
[2:56:31.640 --> 2:56:33.760]  shut down the society
[2:56:33.760 --> 2:56:36.280]  when there's been no illness at all
[2:56:36.280 --> 2:56:40.820]  indicates to me that this has been a politically contrived hysteria
[2:56:40.820 --> 2:56:45.080]  that there's no basis for it in the medical reality but yet
[2:56:45.080 --> 2:56:48.320]  yet very few people are holding the obama administration
[2:56:48.320 --> 2:56:52.160]  to task for saying why all the alarmism
[2:56:52.160 --> 2:56:53.240]  when in fact
[2:56:53.240 --> 2:56:57.000]  the reality was that this disease was inconsequential
[2:56:57.000 --> 2:56:59.440]  also dot there's a lot of blaming
[2:56:59.440 --> 2:57:03.360]  the american people that got upset and scared instead of the administration
[2:57:03.360 --> 2:57:07.200]  and the world health organization you don't blame the people when you yell
[2:57:07.200 --> 2:57:10.680]  fire in a theater and they get up start running out you blame the guy that you'll
[2:57:10.680 --> 2:57:11.840]  fire don't you
[2:57:11.840 --> 2:57:13.360]  well absolutely and
[2:57:13.360 --> 2:57:17.680]  the hysteria that was created president obama coming on television
[2:57:17.680 --> 2:57:22.360]  uh... repeatedly discussing this nationally televised press conferences
[2:57:22.360 --> 2:57:23.680]  making an issue old
[2:57:23.680 --> 2:57:25.680]  with janitor palatano
[2:57:25.680 --> 2:57:30.280]  coming out with repeated press conferences nationally televised
[2:57:30.280 --> 2:57:32.080]  there has to be a basis of
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:36.320]  those of the people sick and dying before any of this hysteria
[2:57:36.320 --> 2:57:39.360]  is in any way proportionate to the government out of
[2:57:39.360 --> 2:57:41.000]  control response
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:43.960]  and the government needs to be held accountable for this and
[2:57:43.960 --> 2:57:47.160]  the government is all we need to press the alarm button
[2:57:47.160 --> 2:57:50.960]  no just pressing the alarm button to show that it can
[2:57:50.960 --> 2:57:54.800]  produce a compliant population ready to submit to government and military
[2:57:54.800 --> 2:57:56.000]  authority
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:57:59.280]  is not justification offer scaring this many people
[2:57:59.280 --> 2:58:02.000]  scaring the entire population of the united states
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:04.600]  and demonstrating that no one would object
[2:58:04.600 --> 2:58:09.040]  even when the border was kept wide open which makes no sense whatsoever
[2:58:09.040 --> 2:58:10.480]  so you know if the
[2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:13.720]  if the powers that they want to see that the american people are already
[2:58:13.720 --> 2:58:14.960]  conditioned
[2:58:14.960 --> 2:58:16.040]  to accept
[2:58:16.040 --> 2:58:17.440]  martial law
[2:58:17.440 --> 2:58:21.520]  and continental or international control of the health emergency
[2:58:21.520 --> 2:58:26.080]  this care over swine flu proves the case

[3:00:30.960 --> 3:00:36.000]  people's front doors well I already knew they were but I googled it and sure enough
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:40.520]  there's hundreds of news articles I printed a few of them where it's the
[3:00:40.520 --> 3:00:45.080]  census doing it you know people denying that that's going on well there's a lot
[3:00:45.080 --> 3:00:48.800]  more to the story not just the fact that it's going on but you want the back
[3:00:48.800 --> 3:00:57.560]  story the full picture we will cover it coming up in the next segment we're also
[3:00:57.560 --> 3:01:01.400]  going to quit get a quick five-minute reporter so from Mexico City there's a
[3:01:01.400 --> 3:01:07.120]  YouTube reporter I think said a pretty good job out there George for title is
[3:01:07.120 --> 3:01:12.040]  the is his YouTube channel name we'll get a report from him down there what
[3:01:12.040 --> 3:01:18.360]  he's been witnessing as well but I do want to encourage the listeners and
[3:01:18.360 --> 3:01:22.400]  viewers of this show at least one plug here while we're doing the radio program
[3:01:22.400 --> 3:01:32.280]  today I don't want to call it my YouTube channel the Alex Jones channel was
[3:01:32.280 --> 3:01:36.400]  set up by a listener about a year and a half ago named Dave and the thing had
[3:01:36.400 --> 3:01:40.920]  gotten 40,000 subscribers and tens of millions of views I mean it was getting
[3:01:40.920 --> 3:01:45.600]  last week I counted it up it had like a million plus views in one week with a
[3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:49.920]  different videos mainly of this radio show and when we stream live at
[3:01:49.920 --> 3:01:53.840]  prisonplanet.tv he was grabbing it from there a lot of other channels there's
[3:01:53.840 --> 3:01:57.200]  scores of channels that post my videos but that was one of the channels we
[3:01:57.200 --> 3:02:00.520]  linked to and because it was called the Alex Jones channel folks thought that
[3:02:00.520 --> 3:02:08.200]  that was my channel so they subscribed to it there is a channel called the
[3:02:08.200 --> 3:02:12.560]  info warrior because they kept threatening him to suspend his account
[3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:16.040]  but never really telling him why when it's just my radio show that's on there
[3:02:16.040 --> 3:02:26.200]  and then whenever we had shown the Pittsburgh shooter was actually attacking
[3:02:26.200 --> 3:02:29.800]  me and didn't like me and the news was saying he was a fan of mine we showed
[3:02:29.800 --> 3:02:33.480]  the front page of the newspaper and the newspaper filed a complaint and they
[3:02:33.480 --> 3:02:36.600]  said one more thing and you're on that no that's free speech when the New
[3:02:36.600 --> 3:02:40.400]  York Times has an article and they put it up on the nightly news they don't
[3:02:40.400 --> 3:02:43.800]  have to get permission to show them the nightly news I mean that's how ass and
[3:02:43.800 --> 3:02:48.240]  I because we try to keep that channel very clean with copyright stuff and they
[3:02:48.240 --> 3:02:51.160]  say they've suspended it again for another newspaper article you know what
[3:02:51.160 --> 3:02:54.560]  I'll show newspaper articles all day long and somebody's got to start going
[3:02:54.560 --> 3:02:59.480]  after these companies for filing these false copyright claims just amazing but
[3:02:59.480 --> 3:03:03.800]  YouTube we it was more than happy with its partners if you're the atheist or
[3:03:03.800 --> 3:03:06.880]  you're some girl in a bikini you know you can you know you can do whatever you
[3:03:06.880 --> 3:03:13.480]  want they leave you alone we also didn't take Google ads on there and that they
[3:03:13.480 --> 3:03:16.960]  suspend a lot of folks that don't take their Google ads if you know if you
[3:03:16.960 --> 3:03:21.120]  don't opt in to have an ads all over your videos they suspend you maybe we
[3:03:21.120 --> 3:03:24.640]  should do what they want and make the info warrior take their stupid ads I
[3:03:24.640 --> 3:03:29.400]  don't know that's the backup channel he started a few months ago if you want to
[3:03:29.400 --> 3:03:33.720]  subscribe that pull up the info warrior of course all the enemies will try to go
[3:03:33.720 --> 3:03:37.920]  file complaints on it get it taken down but that's you yeah YouTube and people
[3:03:37.920 --> 3:03:40.800]  say well why are you still on YouTube if they keep suspending you and cheating
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:44.320]  you and screwing you because that's where the people are it's the number three
[3:03:44.320 --> 3:03:50.160]  website in the world we could post one of my videos on blip TV or live leak or
[3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:54.240]  something else and it might you know get a thousand viewers we're you know but
[3:03:54.240 --> 3:03:59.240]  you in a week we post something on there it gets on average about 20,000 and
[3:03:59.240 --> 3:04:04.760]  everybody else is posting our stuff and in the market of ideas in the marketplace
[3:04:04.760 --> 3:04:09.880]  of supposed digital democracy we are absolute king daddies of YouTube and

[3:05:20.440 --> 3:05:24.920]  push the grid over its edge creating a cascade of power outages across the

[3:08:54.200 --> 3:08:59.320]  alex jones channel being suspended here is the alternate backup channel

[3:09:09.720 --> 3:09:13.400]  40 plus thousand but i never really promoted the alex jones channel because
[3:09:13.400 --> 3:09:16.600]  it wasn't our channel we had just now started getting involved with it
[3:09:16.600 --> 3:09:22.200]  so there is the new channel that doesn't just feature our material we try to
[3:09:22.200 --> 3:09:24.840]  promote everybody on youtube it's getting the truth out
[3:09:24.840 --> 3:09:30.280]  great volunteer dave runs the channel go there and subscribe and i would ask
[3:09:30.280 --> 3:09:34.120]  listeners out there who do have youtube channels enough respect
[3:09:34.120 --> 3:09:43.080]  another great channel is the fine folks over at civilian 37s channel i mean
[3:09:43.080 --> 3:09:46.200]  there's so many great channels out there i can't give them all
[3:09:46.200 --> 3:09:53.320]  credit there's just too many so we are going to attempt to get folks out there
[3:09:53.320 --> 3:09:57.480]  to make videos about the fact that our channel was taken down and sabotaged
[3:09:57.480 --> 3:10:00.520]  but but i want to be clear about all of this
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:06.680]  it isn't just the alex jones channel that was only my material up there
[3:10:06.680 --> 3:10:11.000]  that got deep sixth okay it wasn't just my channel
[3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:17.960]  there is a purge going on all over the internet of alternative media and
[3:10:17.960 --> 3:10:21.640]  anti-new order material especially on google video and youtube video
[3:10:21.640 --> 3:10:25.960]  they're just going in and knocking out accounts left and right
[3:10:25.960 --> 3:10:29.880]  anything that's anti-establishment they're leaving all the bikinis and all
[3:10:29.880 --> 3:10:32.520]  the atheists and all the things the system likes
[3:10:32.520 --> 3:10:36.840]  they only promote that on their main page we have videos every week that are
[3:10:36.840 --> 3:10:40.680]  number one number one overall or number one in categories
[3:10:40.680 --> 3:10:44.280]  nowhere on front pages nowhere on main pages
[3:10:44.280 --> 3:10:47.480]  they'll have some atheists talking about about christians who's literally got
[3:10:47.480 --> 3:10:52.200]  5,000 views and then we'll have 300,000 in one day he's got 5,000
[3:10:52.200 --> 3:10:56.120]  he's front page and then meanwhile we're nowhere and look i'm not
[3:10:56.120 --> 3:10:59.640]  there attacking the atheist he's got his first amendment the point is
[3:10:59.640 --> 3:11:05.000]  do you like the system being rigged for you do you enjoy this do you like this
[3:11:05.000 --> 3:11:08.040]  it's just totally disgusting and i say the atheists because that's all they
[3:11:08.040 --> 3:11:11.320]  put on the front page of youtube i mean the guys that run youtube just must
[3:11:11.320 --> 3:11:16.200]  love the atheist guy because it's him and then you've got the tna all
[3:11:16.200 --> 3:11:20.040]  around that and you've got you know just all of this it's
[3:11:20.040 --> 3:11:23.160]  it's amazing but it doesn't matter they're not
[3:11:23.160 --> 3:11:26.200]  going to keep the truth from breaking out and getting out to the people
[3:11:26.200 --> 3:11:31.480]  by the way we're on xm three hours a day starting june 6 well it's a it's going
[3:11:31.480 --> 3:11:34.120]  to be re-air they want to be live but it's going to be re-air and i believe
[3:11:34.120 --> 3:11:36.600]  or maybe live they're not quite sure if that's confirmed
[3:11:36.600 --> 3:11:41.400]  we'll be on xm three hours a day coming up june 6 and why is that important
[3:11:41.400 --> 3:11:45.400]  because xm reached out to us we're not people paying to be on xm
[3:11:45.400 --> 3:11:48.520]  it's because this show is becoming more and more mainstream
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:51.240]  because the truth is becoming more and more mainstream and people are
[3:11:51.240 --> 3:11:54.200]  demanding and asking for that so i'd ask folks
[3:11:54.200 --> 3:11:57.400]  all the major youtube channels who we've linked to who we've promoted who we've
[3:11:57.400 --> 3:12:01.080]  pushed to please promote and push what we're doing
[3:12:01.080 --> 3:12:05.320]  and the backup channel but i've been almost only want to promote our
[3:12:05.320 --> 3:12:07.800]  backup because we'll just suspend that but we'll go ahead whatever
[3:12:07.800 --> 3:12:11.080]  so there's one place to go just please everybody on your channels please
[3:12:11.080 --> 3:12:13.480]  point out they should subscribe to the info warrior
[3:12:13.480 --> 3:12:18.040]  show that we can do that now i am going to uh go

[3:12:59.480 --> 3:13:03.720]  family murder there's a hostile situation or a daycare full of kids has been
[3:13:03.720 --> 3:13:08.040]  held hostage and it'll be a daycare and the cops show up and nothing's going on
[3:13:08.040 --> 3:13:13.720]  because the the the ip spoofers they go in get the ip of the address they
[3:13:13.720 --> 3:13:17.720]  make a fake phone call off that ip and the swat team shows up
[3:13:17.720 --> 3:13:20.360]  well that's what happened here and the feds are arguing in court with this
[3:13:20.360 --> 3:13:22.840]  young man charging him under the patriot act
[3:13:22.840 --> 3:13:26.520]  that he doesn't have any rights and that there's no such thing as ip spoofing
[3:13:26.520 --> 3:13:31.560]  but if you google ip spoofing uh you can uh say criminals have long employed the
[3:13:31.560 --> 3:13:35.320]  tactic of masking a threat entity from disguises to aliases to collar id
[3:13:35.320 --> 3:13:39.080]  blocking and it could come as no surprise that criminals who conduct
[3:13:39.080 --> 3:13:42.680]  who conduct their nefarious activities on networks and computers should employ
[3:13:42.680 --> 3:13:46.440]  such techniques but it's more than just ip spoofing it's this uh
[3:13:46.440 --> 3:13:50.920]  skype spoofing and and and this ip phone spoofing where they do this it's just
[3:13:50.920 --> 3:13:53.800]  vicious crime you know sending the police to
[3:13:53.800 --> 3:13:58.840]  some family's house and people been killed i mean this is i just i can't
[3:13:58.840 --> 3:14:02.680]  believe what scum are out there but it's it's this internet culture there's the
[3:14:02.680 --> 3:14:05.240]  good and the bad and the ugly of the internet i love the internet
[3:14:05.240 --> 3:14:08.840]  but this stuff's getting worse and worse okay i wanted to go ahead
[3:14:08.840 --> 3:14:14.680]  now and bring up ted anderson for a few minutes because gold's up like 17 bucks
[3:14:14.680 --> 3:14:18.520]  today last time i checked silvers up as well and ted happens to have golden
[3:14:18.520 --> 3:14:21.800]  silver at the price it was two or three weeks ago
[3:14:21.800 --> 3:14:25.400]  we're talking 40 bucks less or something you know it's it's it's gone up
[3:14:25.400 --> 3:14:29.960]  that much and regardless in this crazy world china's dumping the dollar buying
[3:14:29.960 --> 3:14:34.040]  gold and silver and copper you can google that uh they're dumping dollars and
[3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:38.520]  buying real tangible assets and i just think it's important for people
[3:14:38.520 --> 3:14:42.280]  to get off the grid and also cash in at least some of their paper dollars and
[3:14:42.280 --> 3:14:46.120]  IRA and stocks to hedge their bets in this crazy economy
[3:14:46.120 --> 3:14:49.000]  and when you do buy gold and silver it's great to get a good deal on it so ted
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:52.760]  anderson tell folks about it yeah sure i'll come right up real fast with it
[3:14:52.760 --> 3:14:57.240]  of course when gold when silver was down and they're at that 12 dollar level i
[3:14:57.240 --> 3:15:01.000]  was trading those Lakota nation coins at 1771
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:04.520]  now it's over 13 i still have them at 1771
[3:15:04.520 --> 3:15:11.640]  so that's obviously a great buy the francs right now at 214 uh gold what was
[3:15:11.640 --> 3:15:15.960]  it last friday it was about 286 i'm sorry 288
[3:15:15.960 --> 3:15:20.200]  886 now it's over 900 dollars an ounce still the same price
[3:15:20.200 --> 3:15:24.360]  i have those at 214 the british sovereigns are still 267
[3:15:24.360 --> 3:15:29.080]  with gold and silver both up and uh and uh the the prices on this stuff is going
[3:15:29.080 --> 3:15:32.440]  to go up too it's just i've been able to accumulate stuff
[3:15:32.440 --> 3:15:36.920]  while while the market as was lower uh it's summertime i have a tendency to be
[3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:41.320]  able to buy a little better within the summer uh falls coming real fast if
[3:15:41.320 --> 3:15:44.280]  it's anything like last summer we're gonna have a big rush even in june of
[3:15:44.280 --> 3:15:48.040]  july uh with the inflation figures coming out now
[3:15:48.040 --> 3:15:52.440]  there there's a much larger threat for inflation now with all that
[3:15:52.440 --> 3:15:56.920]  tarp money that came out and all the stimulus packages that have been passed
[3:15:56.920 --> 3:16:01.080]  that uh i was just talking to an investment advisor at
[3:16:01.080 --> 3:16:05.400]  ing here on saturday night and he was saying it's inflation
[3:16:05.400 --> 3:16:09.320]  he says he wants to know how he can get involved in the gold and silver market
[3:16:09.320 --> 3:16:12.680]  and uh and that's what i'm hearing from investment advisors all over the place
[3:16:12.680 --> 3:16:15.880]  everybody wants to get in on the golden ira is and
[3:16:15.880 --> 3:16:19.160]  and how they can get involved with that and how they can sell physical gold and
[3:16:19.160 --> 3:16:23.560]  silver uh it's it's it's a big market at this particular time elix i would
[3:16:23.560 --> 3:16:27.000]  really suggest that people take advantage of the fact that the prices
[3:16:27.000 --> 3:16:30.600]  are a little softer right now because before you know all that cash that's
[3:16:30.600 --> 3:16:34.280]  been uh created here the the trillions of dollars
[3:16:34.280 --> 3:16:38.360]  is just it's going to come and flood the the economy no mainstream news admit
[3:16:38.360 --> 3:16:41.960]  china and the arabs and everybody else are now dumping dollars
[3:16:41.960 --> 3:16:45.640]  they've been doing it for two years but it's accelerating the amount that they've
[3:16:45.640 --> 3:16:50.120]  been dumping yeah it sure has and so you know
[3:16:50.120 --> 3:16:54.040]  and i i don't blame them if i was china i would get away from the united states
[3:16:54.040 --> 3:16:58.120]  dollar entirely uh when you when you take a look at
[3:16:58.120 --> 3:17:01.800]  what the united states is doing from the perception of another country
[3:17:01.800 --> 3:17:05.640]  they can tell that the united states dollars being watered down by a whole
[3:17:05.640 --> 3:17:08.120]  bunch of new currency they can see that happening
[3:17:08.120 --> 3:17:11.720]  and if you're sitting there outside of this nation you have no
[3:17:11.720 --> 3:17:15.640]  incentive to hold on to that asset they would love to get out of their securities
[3:17:15.640 --> 3:17:18.920]  they've got about three point three trillion dollars with the u.s.
[3:17:18.920 --> 3:17:22.200]  government securities cash and notes and so on and so forth
[3:17:22.200 --> 3:17:25.800]  and they want to liquidate their position and they're they've increased their
[3:17:25.800 --> 3:17:30.280]  gold reserves by 76 percent just within the last year
[3:17:30.280 --> 3:17:33.640]  so i mean obviously the uh chinese are looking to get out
[3:17:33.640 --> 3:17:36.920]  and they were our lender for about the last 10 years they're the ones that
[3:17:36.920 --> 3:17:41.080]  allowed us to deficit spend and not create inflation at the same time
[3:17:41.080 --> 3:17:47.080]  okay ted i want to tell folks the silver you have to offer i want to tell people
[3:17:47.080 --> 3:17:50.600]  uh not just the silver you have to offer
[3:17:50.600 --> 3:17:54.280]  i also want to tell the listeners and viewers out there the particular
[3:17:54.280 --> 3:17:58.280]  good deals you've got on gold today yeah well right now there's no question
[3:17:58.280 --> 3:18:01.320]  about it if you're looking at gold at all you should be getting into smaller
[3:18:01.320 --> 3:18:05.960]  pieces of gold it makes a lot of sense to have fractional pieces of gold because
[3:18:05.960 --> 3:18:09.880]  when the manure hits the fan you're going to have to spend gold and small
[3:18:09.880 --> 3:18:15.080]  increments that's why i like that frank coin in addition to this it's at 214
[3:18:15.080 --> 3:18:17.720]  now i went out and i priced it alex at this time
[3:18:17.720 --> 3:18:22.440]  and buying it at today's market right now there'd be about 225
[3:18:22.440 --> 3:18:25.560]  for that same coin that you can buy right now at 214
[3:18:25.560 --> 3:18:30.040]  and why can you buy it right now 214 because i bought it back when the market
[3:18:30.040 --> 3:18:34.440]  was lower at this uh 886 level and now we're sitting at 900
[3:18:34.440 --> 3:18:37.160]  dollars an ounce the same thing holds true for those silver
[3:18:37.160 --> 3:18:41.160]  Lakotas last time i had silver over 13 dollars an ounce
[3:18:41.160 --> 3:18:44.280]  i had these things at 18 dollars and 50 cents
[3:18:44.280 --> 3:18:50.360]  right now i have them at 1771 and if you google that coin you'll find out that
[3:18:50.360 --> 3:18:54.200]  on ebay right now they're trading from 20 to 25 dollars a piece
[3:18:54.200 --> 3:18:57.320]  absolutely you cannot beat that deal and i've actually bought a few of those for

[3:24:26.520 --> 3:24:31.720]  there's several issues here they're coming up to people's doors like the
[3:24:31.720 --> 3:24:34.120]  video you see here we're rolling from youtube
[3:24:34.120 --> 3:24:37.880]  this has happened to me back ten years ago nine years ago in the last census
[3:24:37.880 --> 3:24:43.480]  in the year 2000 and they came to the door and demanded i fill it out
[3:24:43.480 --> 3:24:47.240]  actually my girlfriend fill it out she refused later when i was home
[3:24:47.240 --> 3:24:53.080]  they came back uh and banged on the door and i got in a
[3:24:53.080 --> 3:24:56.040]  big argument with them and i said look i'm telling you how many people live
[3:24:56.040 --> 3:24:59.560]  here me and my girlfriend now my wife that's who lives here that's all i got
[3:24:59.560 --> 3:25:03.240]  to answer under u.s code and i even grabbed the census i happened to get
[3:25:03.240 --> 3:25:08.680]  one of the american community long form that had 49 questions
[3:25:08.680 --> 3:25:14.040]  some businesses and houses got questionnaires that 100 200 300 questions
[3:25:14.040 --> 3:25:17.160]  uh but going back from memory one out of six
[3:25:17.160 --> 3:25:22.360]  homes got the 49 question so i got the 49 question and it was what type of toilet
[3:25:22.360 --> 3:25:24.680]  do you have what type of stocks and bonds do you have
[3:25:24.680 --> 3:25:27.560]  then the news reported the other forms people were getting
[3:25:27.560 --> 3:25:31.240]  callers were calling about it but later the news confirmed that yeah some people
[3:25:31.240 --> 3:25:34.200]  were being asked what type of stocks and bonds
[3:25:34.200 --> 3:25:38.440]  do you have do you own firearms if you do what type
[3:25:38.440 --> 3:25:41.480]  i mean big thick things you were supposed to fill out
[3:25:41.480 --> 3:25:44.920]  and then i went and looked up the u.s code and federal court rulings
[3:25:44.920 --> 3:25:48.040]  and it said you only have to answer how many people live there and that's to
[3:25:48.040 --> 3:25:52.040]  decide how many members of congress your state gets
[3:25:52.040 --> 3:25:55.160]  because that is apportioned how many members of the house representatives
[3:25:55.160 --> 3:25:57.960]  you get uh the senate is to per state but the
[3:25:57.960 --> 3:26:02.120]  house is done by population that's why some states might have 10 members
[3:26:02.120 --> 3:26:05.640]  some states might have three members you know california has the most members
[3:26:05.640 --> 3:26:08.760]  because it has the biggest population texas is number two
[3:26:08.760 --> 3:26:12.440]  with the most members that's done by the census and now the feds say well we
[3:26:12.440 --> 3:26:15.480]  also do it for how much federal money your state gets in things
[3:26:15.480 --> 3:26:19.000]  but the point is if you're an axe murderer or a criminal
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:22.760]  and you're caught with a carload full of people you've hacked up with an axe
[3:26:22.760 --> 3:26:26.120]  and it looks like you're guilty and the women's skin is under your fingernails
[3:26:26.120 --> 3:26:30.360]  and you took polaroid pictures of their dead bodies you know opposing with them
[3:26:30.360 --> 3:26:33.320]  you still don't have to incriminate yourself under the fifth amendment
[3:26:33.320 --> 3:26:37.400]  you don't have to answer questions so how then do bureaucrats come with no
[3:26:37.400 --> 3:26:42.520]  judge no jury no warrant no indictment no subpoena
[3:26:42.520 --> 3:26:47.000]  and they say you must answer our questions under penalty of law
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:26:49.960]  you must answer our questions or you're going to be arrested
[3:26:49.960 --> 3:26:53.160]  but if you look at the long forms and the short forms you get even the
[3:26:53.160 --> 3:26:56.440]  short form one has nine questions that everybody gets and they're saying
[3:26:56.440 --> 3:27:03.000]  they're going to expand it this gpsing is only a warm up for next year
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:09.720]  and so they are coming out now uh... and saying to everybody
[3:27:09.720 --> 3:27:12.920]  uh... that it's the law you've got to fill out the question whether it's nine
[3:27:12.920 --> 3:27:15.640]  or forty nine or a hundred or two hundred or three hundred
[3:27:15.640 --> 3:27:18.280]  some businesses get even bigger ones
[3:27:18.280 --> 3:27:21.000]  they're seeing how to fill it out even though you have a fifth amendment and
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:24.520]  a fourth amendment right to not do it but how they do it is you get the forms
[3:27:24.520 --> 3:27:27.400]  and i covered this on air years ago on local tv i
[3:27:27.400 --> 3:27:29.960]  haven't gotten one in the mail yet but if i get the long form i'll show you but
[3:27:29.960 --> 3:27:33.560]  even the short form has it it'll it'll it'll be a piece of paper
[3:27:33.560 --> 3:27:37.880]  and up in the corner it'll have the us code and under the law you've got to do
[3:27:37.880 --> 3:27:41.960]  this and then a dotted line with the nine questions
[3:27:41.960 --> 3:27:44.600]  they think they can make you answer
[3:27:44.600 --> 3:27:48.680]  which there's eight too many there but then under it there'll be all these
[3:27:48.680 --> 3:27:52.280]  other questions so it's a lawyer trick
[3:27:52.280 --> 3:27:55.880]  and we're already getting these emailed to us uh... and and and this is it i've
[3:27:55.880 --> 3:27:58.920]  seen them before us department of economics

[3:29:09.560 --> 3:29:14.120]  but you have to know how to go look up us code to find that out
[3:29:14.120 --> 3:29:18.120]  just like there's no law you gotta take vaccines but they do the same damn things
[3:29:18.120 --> 3:29:23.320]  excuse me folks i'm getting angry they do the very same thing
[3:29:23.320 --> 3:29:27.000]  they tell you it's the law you got to do it when it's really a regulation and a
[3:29:27.000 --> 3:29:31.320]  policy but then the law says if they try to enforce that policy in public
[3:29:31.320 --> 3:29:35.800]  schools to take shots to be there that by law they have to give you the waiver
[3:29:35.800 --> 3:29:38.040]  but there's no law to take the shot when we come back

[3:34:06.840 --> 3:34:10.600]  the census takers you have a fourth and fifth amendment right
[3:34:10.600 --> 3:34:13.960]  to not have somebody cross your fence you're no trespassing sign
[3:34:13.960 --> 3:34:18.600]  to come on your property uh and to demand to ask do you have a low flush
[3:34:18.600 --> 3:34:22.520]  toilet what types of stocks and bonds do you have how much money in the bank this
[3:34:22.520 --> 3:34:25.160]  is in some of the census forms they have different ones they give you but that
[3:34:25.160 --> 3:34:29.000]  was on record from the year 2000 all over the news some census takers in
[3:34:29.000 --> 3:34:33.480]  2000 quote forced their way into homes others were killed by dogs climbing
[3:34:33.480 --> 3:34:37.400]  over fences into private property i mean it's crazy for 12 bucks an hour what
[3:34:37.400 --> 3:34:40.520]  these folks do i'm not saying all census workers are bad
[3:34:40.520 --> 3:34:43.800]  but the point is they haven't been trained the bill of rights constitution
[3:34:43.800 --> 3:34:48.600]  and they go around with the sheets threatening to have people arrested if
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:51.160]  they don't answer all their questions now i was one of the unlucky people in
[3:34:51.160 --> 3:34:55.400]  2000 uh to get the long form that a certain amount of
[3:34:55.400 --> 3:35:00.040]  households got that had 49 questions other forms ask what type of firearms do

[3:37:20.760 --> 3:37:24.680]  and they have handheld gps to mark the front
[3:37:24.680 --> 3:37:30.040]  door of your house as part of the next wave of the census when they come and
[3:37:30.040 --> 3:37:33.800]  demand that you fill out the long forms how many guns you own
[3:37:33.800 --> 3:37:36.280]  what i'm not kidding this happened last time we're gonna do it this time you
[3:37:36.280 --> 3:37:39.160]  know the census website they say it what your stocks and bonds are what your
[3:37:39.160 --> 3:37:42.520]  toilet does you know all of this
[3:37:42.520 --> 3:37:46.040]  so and then also mainstream articles for the acorn people getting billions in
[3:37:46.040 --> 3:37:48.200]  funding and this new u s a service
[3:37:48.200 --> 3:37:51.080]  dot org where they advertise as if it's federal but it's really private
[3:37:51.080 --> 3:37:54.360]  democratic party they admittedly go around with gps
[3:37:54.360 --> 3:37:58.520]  mark in your home and whether or not your name in your home and if you support
[3:37:58.520 --> 3:38:02.360]  obama or not and they claim over just finding out who obama supporters are
[3:38:02.360 --> 3:38:07.640]  just incredible police state done like it's no big deal
[3:38:07.640 --> 3:38:11.240]  so again the average census worker just thinks oh i'm just confirming the person
[3:38:11.240 --> 3:38:16.520]  lives here so we can send the next wave of of little stasi bureaucrat out
[3:38:16.520 --> 3:38:20.520]  now the problem is they admit that they keep having problems with swat teams
[3:38:20.520 --> 3:38:23.080]  going to the wrong door going to the wrong house or or
[3:38:23.080 --> 3:38:29.720]  double homes you know uh uh these uh homes that are duplexes
[3:38:29.720 --> 3:38:32.520]  where they swat team the wrong house you're about this all the time and if
[3:38:32.520 --> 3:38:35.400]  you read in the federal documents homeland security has said
[3:38:35.400 --> 3:38:38.200]  through the census years ago you can dig this out when you do an article i
[3:38:38.200 --> 3:38:41.960]  remember reading it that they want to discover
[3:38:41.960 --> 3:38:45.000]  where everybody lives in america so they know where to send swat teams or
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:48.440]  homeland security that's then also shared with locals
[3:38:48.440 --> 3:38:50.920]  they also under homeland security of state of they want you to have to have an
[3:38:50.920 --> 3:38:55.560]  id card to get a job but illegal aliens by the way are exempt from that uh
[3:38:55.560 --> 3:38:58.680]  under the stimulus package and other things you've noticed so they're exempt
[3:38:58.680 --> 3:39:03.480]  but citizens have to and they have said that
[3:39:03.480 --> 3:39:07.720]  uh they want this total control grid over what we do
[3:39:07.720 --> 3:39:11.800]  in our everyday lives all across our society
[3:39:11.800 --> 3:39:14.600]  and so by doing this they're confirming where you live and
[3:39:14.600 --> 3:39:18.200]  what you're doing and that you do live there okay they're finding out of people
[3:39:18.200 --> 3:39:20.600]  move they're finding out people are running a house that aren't supposed to
[3:39:20.600 --> 3:39:23.880]  be they're finding about about the underground economy
[3:39:23.880 --> 3:39:27.960]  uh and expanding on that remember that headline in fact google this guys
[3:39:27.960 --> 3:39:34.680]  scoff laws scoff laws get caught ordering pizzas
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:40.200]  or for scoff ordering pizzas scoff laws get caught scoff law somebody that
[3:39:40.200 --> 3:39:43.320]  ignores like parking tickets and small things but when you read the article
[3:39:43.320 --> 3:39:46.600]  it says the big three pizza companies deliveries
[3:39:46.600 --> 3:39:50.360]  they know when a felon or somebody who the law wants to know where they're at
[3:39:50.360 --> 3:39:53.400]  that your your order when it's entered in the computer goes through
[3:39:53.400 --> 3:39:58.280]  the federal government first and that the three companies get 25 percent
[3:39:58.280 --> 3:40:02.440]  uh of of the of the money from any fines or fees or arrest
[3:40:02.440 --> 3:40:06.280]  just from ordering a pizza to give you an idea how they are
[3:40:06.280 --> 3:40:10.040]  uh tracking you for folks that uh aren't aware of this and i'm just giving you a
[3:40:10.040 --> 3:40:13.480]  few little pieces of how massive this is now
[3:40:13.480 --> 3:40:17.640]  with the big surveillance blimp's they put at 90 to 110 000 feet in the
[3:40:17.640 --> 3:40:20.760]  atmosphere that they've now announced they have ground penetrating radar
[3:40:20.760 --> 3:40:24.520]  face scanners uh infrared scanners they use ground
[3:40:24.520 --> 3:40:28.200]  face scanning cameras off your digital photo to identify yeah that's alex
[3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:31.480]  jones walking down the street the blimp then zooms in
[3:40:31.480 --> 3:40:35.400]  and three integrated systems is all declassified now
[3:40:35.400 --> 3:40:39.640]  and says okay we're going to get the live read right now of his thermal image
[3:40:39.640 --> 3:40:42.840]  then i have to send a team out with a scope okay that's alex jones let's get
[3:40:42.840 --> 3:40:46.440]  his thermal image to get the reading they've already got my face print for
[3:40:46.440 --> 3:40:49.000]  my digital photo when i went and got my driver's license
[3:40:49.000 --> 3:40:53.240]  and my fingerprint okay and then companies that thumb print and face print
[3:40:53.240 --> 3:40:57.240]  you to go to the tanning salon or get your school library books or to go to
[3:40:57.240 --> 3:40:59.480]  the gym those are all sold to databases
[3:40:59.480 --> 3:41:03.240]  just like the big pizza places it's big money see the private corporations
[3:41:03.240 --> 3:41:05.240]  lobby for this and work with the police state
[3:41:05.240 --> 3:41:09.320]  yeah the hidden dangers of pizza and it says the extra cheese and pepperoni
[3:41:09.320 --> 3:41:12.920]  could give you a way to officials in missouri said they may track scoff
[3:41:12.920 --> 3:41:16.120]  laws uh by monitoring pizza delivery list
[3:41:16.120 --> 3:41:20.200]  david kopal under the state courts administration said pizza databases
[3:41:20.200 --> 3:41:24.760]  could be used as an untapped resource yeah that's not out of usa today that's
[3:41:24.760 --> 3:41:28.120]  another one about them doing it they're already doing it that's an article
[3:41:28.120 --> 3:41:32.600]  saying they might that the usa today meant they were doing it but but anyways
[3:41:32.600 --> 3:41:36.520]  to finish up here but good job finding that guys
[3:41:36.520 --> 3:41:40.200]  to finish up um so when we get up here and we talk about
[3:41:40.200 --> 3:41:43.800]  they could send a swat team to your door with this this is to track and control
[3:41:43.800 --> 3:41:47.880]  you this is to track and trace you this is all admitted you walk out front your
[3:41:47.880 --> 3:41:51.480]  house they know where the gps reading is they've got the blimp ready
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:41:55.400]  and it just takes a scan in a few seconds of your heat residence
[3:41:55.400 --> 3:41:58.280]  and now it knows where you're at they have these over iraq that's the secret
[3:41:58.280 --> 3:42:01.080]  weapon he said well it's not really secret but i won't write about it my
[3:42:01.080 --> 3:42:03.880]  book everybody said oh what's bob what we're talking about
[3:42:03.880 --> 3:42:07.320]  it's this it's this technology mit magazine admits it
[3:42:07.320 --> 3:42:11.640]  so they love to brag about what they've got so that's what all this is about
[3:42:11.640 --> 3:42:14.920]  do you own guns what are you doing are you an obama supporter
[3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:18.440]  they're using this gps reading and i remember talking to people a decade ago
[3:42:18.440 --> 3:42:22.520]  in very rural areas in the last census this began in 1999
[3:42:22.520 --> 3:42:25.800]  people in rural areas we went out and interviewed them in johnson city and
[3:42:25.800 --> 3:42:29.480]  other areas in the hill country there'd be a log cabin somebody built
[3:42:29.480 --> 3:42:33.240]  out on 20 acres they had that nobody even knew about that was for camping
[3:42:33.240 --> 3:42:36.920]  and they'd have notices on their door and then they'd be able and they'd catch
[3:42:36.920 --> 3:42:40.840]  people there with the satellite images of the house saying okay who lives here
[3:42:40.840 --> 3:42:44.600]  they are tracking everything they want to militarily dominate that's what the
[3:42:44.600 --> 3:42:48.360]  global positioning system is with the pentagon satellites it was designed so
[3:42:48.360 --> 3:42:51.320]  they could shoot a cruise missile through your window or down your chimney
[3:42:51.320 --> 3:42:55.800]  this is a control grid and people are denying that they're even using this
[3:42:55.800 --> 3:42:59.160]  for the census right now they're even emailing me and saying we're
[3:42:59.160 --> 3:43:03.240]  making it up that census workers are at people's doors let me read to you from
[3:43:03.240 --> 3:43:07.320]  npr and we're going to our guest in mexico city and the census worker
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:11.400]  faces dogs guns to verify addresses perump valley news
[3:43:11.400 --> 3:43:15.320]  it's still a year before the 2010 census but already 60 census workers have
[3:43:15.320 --> 3:43:18.120]  fanned out across southern nigh county that's in the middle of the desert
[3:43:18.120 --> 3:43:22.760]  nevada and an attempt to verify addresses but in a sneak preview of some
[3:43:22.760 --> 3:43:26.360]  of the thorny situations census takers could face and perump the address
[3:43:26.360 --> 3:43:30.120]  verification led to a few surprise property owners including an incident
[3:43:30.120 --> 3:43:33.960]  where a gun was pulled she was in their backyard and talks about that it goes on
[3:43:33.960 --> 3:43:37.160]  they're just driving up checking the addresses outside making sure
[3:43:37.160 --> 3:43:40.120]  the correct address and it goes on to say
[3:43:40.120 --> 3:43:44.440]  oh i want to read the whole article our guest is talking i mean waiting but but
[3:43:44.440 --> 3:43:49.880]  it says in here that um they're using gps to track them so i'll
[3:43:49.880 --> 3:43:53.160]  read that after we get a report from mexico city
[3:43:53.160 --> 3:43:56.520]  um i guess he contacted us from our producer pointed out i'm not sure but
[3:43:56.520 --> 3:44:00.520]  i'd already seen his video and uh up there it's a george
[3:44:00.520 --> 3:44:04.280]  for title and uh the only news he really reported
[3:44:04.280 --> 3:44:08.360]  from youtube in mexico city was that they were locking it down where food and
[3:44:08.360 --> 3:44:11.480]  water couldn't get in people were demonstrating so riot cops were going
[3:44:11.480 --> 3:44:15.160]  off a deal with that so reporting from mexico city
[3:44:15.160 --> 3:44:18.440]  uh with what's happening uh the youtube channel george for title
[3:44:18.440 --> 3:44:21.640]  george what's going on there in mexico city
[3:44:21.640 --> 3:44:25.560]  hey alex pleasure to be on the show um right now i'm on the streets of
[3:44:25.560 --> 3:44:30.920]  mexico city and uh just what i'm seeing is a lot of people with masks on
[3:44:30.920 --> 3:44:34.360]  and the funny thing you really see in a lot down here is people are wearing the
[3:44:34.360 --> 3:44:37.800]  mask but they're either wearing them incorrectly like over there over their
[3:44:37.800 --> 3:44:40.760]  necks or over their heads and their nose are still exposed
[3:44:40.760 --> 3:44:43.400]  and if you actually look at the math that the government give out here
[3:44:43.400 --> 3:44:46.440]  they don't protect you at all like i got a video that they're just really
[3:44:46.440 --> 3:44:49.720]  thin uh material that wouldn't protect you from anything
[3:44:49.720 --> 3:44:54.520]  it's a visual sub uh art type of hysteria
[3:44:54.520 --> 3:44:58.760]  it it's all part of the play acting like when cops wear black uniforms they
[3:44:58.760 --> 3:45:02.120]  act more aggressively or when elmer fudd puts on a hunting cap he starts
[3:45:02.120 --> 3:45:06.200]  acting like a hunter uh you know or when a woman puts on you know lingerie she
[3:45:06.200 --> 3:45:10.200]  on average becomes more sexually aroused this is all psychology
[3:45:10.200 --> 3:45:13.320]  explain okay explain to folks what you've seen i mean we uh
[3:45:13.320 --> 3:45:16.840]  a lot of folks have seen the video of the masked paramilitary police
[3:45:16.840 --> 3:45:20.440]  marching off uh you know to me that's the story
[3:45:20.440 --> 3:45:24.520]  is that it's the non-story and they're using this as a way to crack down on the
[3:45:24.520 --> 3:45:27.960]  population with the military that's what a lot of mexicans calling us
[3:45:27.960 --> 3:45:33.480]  for mexico city of said what i've seen here is a lot of military vehicles
[3:45:33.480 --> 3:45:39.320]  in the streets we've even seen uh patrol actually loading up and the weird
[3:45:39.320 --> 3:45:41.800]  thing about it is they were loading up it looked like
[3:45:41.800 --> 3:45:44.920]  with their own personal gear i mean they had color
[3:45:44.920 --> 3:45:49.080]  uh backpacks and it was just really weird i got a lot of
[3:45:49.080 --> 3:45:52.120]  information on my youtube channel that they said hey this is a weird type of
[3:45:52.120 --> 3:45:55.400]  operation they're there they have riot gear but they don't even have any
[3:45:55.400 --> 3:45:58.360]  weapons and it looks like they have their own personal
[3:45:58.360 --> 3:46:01.640]  clothing and their own personal pets that they're taking with them
[3:46:01.640 --> 3:46:05.720]  so that was really strange and we got really close to that vehicle that was
[3:46:05.720 --> 3:46:08.440]  loading up for that operation we had one gentleman
[3:46:08.440 --> 3:46:10.840]  one of the soldiers that was actually approaching us
[3:46:10.840 --> 3:46:15.480]  my taxi cab driver that i'm using is really uh really smart guy
[3:46:15.480 --> 3:46:19.400]  he took off right away and we were able to be you know okay
[3:46:19.400 --> 3:46:23.160]  absolutely i've been shaking down more than once by mexican police and trips
[3:46:23.160 --> 3:46:26.760]  in mexico very corrupt so i mean just an overall
[3:46:26.760 --> 3:46:30.600]  of you are people still panic are the streets still somewhat empty compared
[3:46:30.600 --> 3:46:34.120]  to what usually that mega city is the biggest city in the world when i first
[3:46:34.120 --> 3:46:38.360]  got here friday it was literally a ghost town i had a hotel
[3:46:38.360 --> 3:46:41.880]  in downtown mexico city and i could swear to you
[3:46:41.880 --> 3:46:45.240]  i was like one of three people that were staying at this hotel
[3:46:45.240 --> 3:46:48.520]  that's the biggest story i'm getting down here
[3:46:48.520 --> 3:46:52.520]  it's hard to imagine 20 to 25 million people
[3:46:52.520 --> 3:46:55.640]  on almost total lockdown you can't get into a restaurant
[3:46:55.640 --> 3:46:59.560]  i mean they got special rules if you you know you can only get takeout
[3:46:59.560 --> 3:47:03.640]  you know the taxi cab drivers have to wear gloves they have to wear a mask
[3:47:03.640 --> 3:47:07.160]  i mean there's all these regulations and what i'm getting from this whole
[3:47:07.160 --> 3:47:10.760]  experience is it's just the sheer authoritarianism
[3:47:10.760 --> 3:47:14.200]  that the people are willing to accept down here it's just totally
[3:47:14.200 --> 3:47:17.800]  blows my mind i you know it's just incredible i mean literally
[3:47:17.800 --> 3:47:20.360]  the people are starting to come out because they're just getting tired of
[3:47:20.360 --> 3:47:23.960]  staying indoors but many businesses are closed down i would say like
[3:47:23.960 --> 3:47:27.720]  80 of the businesses are closed down i mean people are hurting they're losing
[3:47:27.720 --> 3:47:31.000]  money if you own a small business you're not allowed to open
[3:47:31.000 --> 3:47:34.760]  uh till may fifth there's so many restrictions they find you
[3:47:34.760 --> 3:47:38.280]  thousands and thousands of pixels if you try to engage in business here
[3:47:38.280 --> 3:47:43.320]  because of the well mexico applied yeah mexico applied
[3:47:43.320 --> 3:47:47.960]  to go under imf global currency s dr's reuters and ap reported
[3:47:47.960 --> 3:47:52.120]  and the first major nation to do this and so
[3:47:52.120 --> 3:47:55.560]  in a way it's like a bank holiday is going on we know this is a beta test
[3:47:55.560 --> 3:48:02.120]  for as revolution bruise to a a paramount point they know how to kill it
[3:48:02.120 --> 3:48:05.560]  kill these flash points of revolution with a fake
[3:48:05.560 --> 3:48:09.400]  flu drill and i believe in so does dr's rum course you many other experts have
[3:48:09.400 --> 3:48:12.760]  studied this that that's why they came out and said into the world
[3:48:12.760 --> 3:48:15.320]  you know people have to take this serious you know uh that you know the
[3:48:15.320 --> 3:48:17.960]  people getting scared in the theater when somebody yells fire they're not the
[3:48:17.960 --> 3:48:21.000]  bad people it's the guy that yelled fire and the government came out and fear
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:23.960]  monitored and did this so i understand why folks got concerned i got concerned
[3:48:23.960 --> 3:48:27.400]  many others did but my instinct from the day one was this may be real but i think
[3:48:27.400 --> 3:48:30.520]  it's a hoax we had a lot of different perspectives here on air but i always
[3:48:30.520 --> 3:48:33.480]  said i believe it's a hoax to practice martial law
[3:48:33.480 --> 3:48:37.240]  as a smoke screen for a takeover and the mexicans calling for mexico's city and
[3:48:37.240 --> 3:48:39.800]  others they all concurred and said that's what they were
[3:48:39.800 --> 3:48:43.240]  saying before they even heard me on the show saying it so a lot of people are
[3:48:43.240 --> 3:48:46.680]  saying that uh... of the mexicans you're talking to though they
[3:48:46.680 --> 3:48:50.120]  they are saying you're confirming that uh... they think this is all just a
[3:48:50.120 --> 3:48:54.040]  cover for police state i've probably personally interviewed or
[3:48:54.040 --> 3:48:58.120]  talked to about thirty to forty uh... mexican citizens
[3:48:58.120 --> 3:49:01.240]  and they are i would say at the majority of them
[3:49:01.240 --> 3:49:04.440]  seventy percent of them uh... you know that this
[3:49:04.440 --> 3:49:08.920]  is basically fake i don't know how to say it in any other words
[3:49:08.920 --> 3:49:14.200]  but they know something's going on uh... and the thirty percent that do
[3:49:14.200 --> 3:49:17.720]  think something's going on and they're wearing their mask a lot of it is
[3:49:17.720 --> 3:49:21.240]  it's kind of like a trend i mean they're drawing designs on their map it's kind
[3:49:21.240 --> 3:49:25.480]  of like you know they just go along but yeah these are these are the thirty
[3:49:25.480 --> 3:49:29.000]  percent these are the thirty percent in mexico the u.s germany
[3:49:29.000 --> 3:49:33.240]  it doesn't matter marketers have documented thirty percent will buy
[3:49:33.240 --> 3:49:37.560]  any bull any fad their their their total followers
[3:49:37.560 --> 3:49:41.240]  and then another thirty percent are kind of in between and thirty percent
[3:49:41.240 --> 3:49:45.160]  are very hard to fool you know this show is all about the thirty percent that
[3:49:45.160 --> 3:49:48.200]  aren't fooled waking up the other thirty percent that
[3:49:48.200 --> 3:49:51.400]  have some chance of waking up and not being idiots
[3:49:51.400 --> 3:49:54.920]  that other thirty percent they'd march into death camps
[3:49:54.920 --> 3:49:57.720]  you know they'd run down into pits and be shot in the back of the head
[3:49:57.720 --> 3:50:01.400]  you know uh... just like we saw in nazi germany
[3:50:01.400 --> 3:50:05.080]  they will do what they're told and and and we need to break through that
[3:50:05.080 --> 3:50:08.040]  mindset uh... but you know it's hard to not get into that
[3:50:08.040 --> 3:50:11.800]  mindset when the u n saying this is the greatest threat to humanity ever
[3:50:11.800 --> 3:50:14.680]  millions to you know are probably going to die
[3:50:14.680 --> 3:50:18.520]  it's the end of the planet and then it turns out it's all a complete dirty
[3:50:18.520 --> 3:50:23.400]  hoax but i believe a beta test for something bigger and perhaps more real
[3:50:23.400 --> 3:50:28.360]  in the future these are you genesis we're talking about

[3:56:31.880 --> 3:56:35.960]  i got an email from someone saying how dare you link to uh yet
[3:56:35.960 --> 3:56:39.480]  i thought was a favor to some people to watch the video but i was to george but
[3:56:39.480 --> 3:56:43.160]  obviously not somebody else a lot of craziness going on out there folks
[3:56:43.160 --> 3:56:47.720]  uh but uh the larger issue here
[3:56:47.720 --> 3:56:51.720]  is that uh our youtube channel i see our youtube
[3:56:51.720 --> 3:56:54.680]  a day of a fan made it but people thought it was the alex jones channel and
[3:56:54.680 --> 3:56:57.720]  that became a controversy wasn't alex jones channel so i said okay
[3:56:57.720 --> 3:57:01.560]  i'll i'll i'll get involved with it and promote it and so we've been involved
[3:57:01.560 --> 3:57:04.360]  a little bit more with it posting a few links and things and we posted a few
[3:57:04.360 --> 3:57:09.480]  videos uh up there some of the obama deception uh videos like uh the
[3:57:09.480 --> 3:57:12.760]  director alex jones reaches out to obama supporters and
[3:57:12.760 --> 3:57:15.800]  things like that it was getting about a million views a week on average
[3:57:15.800 --> 3:57:19.240]  conservatively i mean really a powerful channel
[3:57:19.240 --> 3:57:22.520]  really waking people up just that channel alone
[3:57:22.520 --> 3:57:26.440]  i would say was probably about five percent
[3:57:26.440 --> 3:57:29.960]  out of a hundred of who we reach and it's now been shut down
[3:57:29.960 --> 3:57:34.200]  for no reason i'm asking folks to uh please promote
[3:57:34.200 --> 3:57:37.240]  the show prism planet dot tv and other videos that we do
[3:57:37.240 --> 3:57:41.080]  because this this is a blow against truth and freedom but we will never give up
[3:57:41.080 --> 3:57:45.080]  we will never give in and this only makes us stronger
[3:57:45.080 --> 3:57:49.080]  there is a purge going on of all patriot videos right now so people need to be
[3:57:49.080 --> 3:57:52.280]  focused on that and expose it and fight back and ask why is this
[3:57:52.280 --> 3:57:55.400]  information censored george will have you back up tomorrow but the last minute
[3:57:55.400 --> 3:57:59.800]  of the show you said you went into this emergency room in mexico city go ahead

[3:58:03.000 --> 3:58:07.080]  it just hits you like a brick wall it's like total authoritarianism
[3:58:07.080 --> 3:58:10.680]  total lies and i think you know what instead of doing reports outside of these
[3:58:10.680 --> 3:58:14.280]  hospitals i'm gonna prove a point so i took off my mask and i went inside of

[3:58:25.160 --> 3:58:28.680]  i just was trying to make a point and the point is it's all lies
