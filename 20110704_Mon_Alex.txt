[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:27.880]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones we are now into
[00:27.880 --> 00:36.560]  our number two the last 30 minutes or so I have been covering just the tip of the iceberg
[00:36.560 --> 00:44.800]  or the top molecule of ice at the tip of the iceberg of the thousands of videos thousands
[00:44.800 --> 00:50.400]  just a police arresting camera people in fact jaren there's one I forgot to send you or
[00:50.400 --> 00:55.760]  I think I sent it to you but I don't see it the printouts here it's the one in Texas where
[00:55.760 --> 00:59.840]  there's the overturned 18 wheeler and the main line news trucks there and the cop comes
[00:59.840 --> 01:06.240]  over and they're totally polite and they flip out on them and they and the people start
[01:06.240 --> 01:14.200]  trying to leave but and the cop goes ahead and arrest both the cameraman and the reporter
[01:14.200 --> 01:19.480]  and there's just countless of those including cops beating up main line TV there'll be a
[01:19.480 --> 01:26.200]  big wreck and in one of the videos the news trucks there they're probably a hundred yards
[01:26.200 --> 01:30.240]  away to get the whole shot in the background on the nighttime one I think that was in
[01:30.240 --> 01:37.320]  Utah forget and the cops just come running over and they say get out of here and they
[01:37.320 --> 01:42.680]  go almost do my job I'm here to film the right for the news and they go no you're not and
[01:42.680 --> 01:51.400]  just grab them and tackle them it's just like crazy these are crazy people and the police
[01:51.400 --> 01:59.840]  in most the cases try to defend this and why are the social engineers telling cops to defend
[01:59.840 --> 02:04.480]  this and and go along with it to make the public hate you well at the same time turning
[02:04.480 --> 02:08.640]  you into a bunch of goons but but but this has got to be of all the videos I've seen
[02:08.640 --> 02:12.280]  the worst this is out front building seven the new building seven Larry Silverstein owner
[02:12.280 --> 02:17.440]  of the World Trade Centers yeah there it is insane cop arrest ABC News reporter for

[02:28.800 --> 02:34.600]  in the film Truth Rising and guys that could literally walk right on to a Hollywood set
[02:34.600 --> 02:41.440]  and play you know good fellas come over and say don't film me but they're on the sidewalk
[02:41.440 --> 02:46.120]  legally protesting they've even had the little special permits and they say well I'm gonna
[02:46.120 --> 02:51.240]  say you got a bomb and I'm gonna say you got a gun and we know you don't have one but
[02:51.240 --> 02:55.280]  you'll go to jail first the cops come they they they tell them that the cops grab the
[02:55.280 --> 03:01.760]  video camera and say yes this is a gun and start laughing and say leave or we're gonna
[03:01.760 --> 03:11.360]  arrest you for a bomb and a gun and looks like you're serious this is police on camera
[03:11.360 --> 03:19.240]  with with the security thugs of Larry Silverstein and they say Larry don't like you being here

[05:07.680 --> 05:12.920]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[05:12.920 --> 05:18.120]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name
[05:18.120 --> 05:23.480]  of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[05:23.480 --> 05:28.640]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[05:28.640 --> 05:33.880]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[05:33.880 --> 05:38.440]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[05:38.440 --> 05:43.040]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators

[08:11.360 --> 08:20.480]  well our guest is coming up here in a few minutes his bio would take an hour to go over as a lawyer
[08:21.680 --> 08:25.600]  nightly tv host in new york city syndicated radio host
[08:26.640 --> 08:35.360]  wabc w o r premiere radio network i mean you name it court tv air america everybody knows
[08:35.360 --> 08:39.200]  who linel is that's why when i got to the new media seminar at talkers be the keynote speaker
[08:39.200 --> 08:44.800]  and they're like he's like hi i'm linel i'm a big fan like i wanna who you are but it gave me a
[08:44.800 --> 08:48.480]  pretty good introduction but i've asked him to come on today with a little light entertainment to
[08:48.480 --> 08:53.360]  roast me but he wants to talk about serious issues but uh he says he doesn't want to make the audience
[08:53.360 --> 08:58.640]  mad i actually like it it's a sick thing i've admitted it now his stuff is lighthearted and
[08:58.640 --> 09:03.760]  friendly but but i actually people that really make up outrageous lies about me that's why i'm
[09:03.760 --> 09:08.560]  not going to sue the dallas blog saying i work for obama when they have no proof just they just say
[09:08.560 --> 09:15.680]  it's funny so at a certain level i really like it uh so we're going to be uh it's it's it's
[09:17.200 --> 09:21.440]  i i guess something's wrong with me but but uh it's fun to be roasted we're going to be talking
[09:21.440 --> 09:27.600]  to linel of linel media dot com here in just a moment but for stations that just joined us
[09:27.600 --> 09:32.720]  earlier there's this big controversy it out of the thousands of videos out there it's become a
[09:32.720 --> 09:40.400]  national story uh with the woman in rochester and the cops saying you know it's not just get back
[09:40.400 --> 09:45.360]  and she's on her own property front yard videotape and a cop stopping people and searching their car
[09:45.360 --> 09:51.520]  and she says she's observing they tell her go and get back in your house and she says no but
[09:51.520 --> 09:55.360]  starts backing up as they've said and they still arrest her so i thought i'd play clips where they
[09:55.360 --> 10:01.280]  arrest news people or threaten to arrest my camera crew or do arrest them in pittsburgh uh totally
[10:01.280 --> 10:05.360]  polite on a hill videotaping demonstrations cops come up in riot gear and say put the
[10:05.360 --> 10:11.920]  camera down you're going to jail and uh and then the media is always well what was on the camera
[10:11.920 --> 10:18.400]  before that happened just just any excuse to rationalize this and the point is when your police
[10:19.680 --> 10:24.480]  cease to be servants of the people become thugs you're living in a tyranny it's very elementary
[10:25.520 --> 10:28.400]  now going back to this clip from truth rising this is lucrodowski
[10:28.400 --> 10:35.440]  uh with a few we are change members out there with a sign saying uh larry silverstein you know
[10:35.440 --> 10:40.080]  said pull building seven and they've already been out there before they've been harassed
[10:40.080 --> 10:45.040]  the cops have come before they're it's legal and lawful for them to be there they even go and
[10:45.040 --> 10:51.280]  get the permit like they're supposed to and here come private security people saying we're going
[10:51.280 --> 10:55.840]  to say you have a bomb we've called the police the police get there and the police agree they say
[10:55.840 --> 10:59.280]  yes we're going to say your backpacks a bomb and we're going to say your camera's a gun and
[10:59.280 --> 11:05.360]  they grab it away and say look you know uh we found a gun and then they said now leave or
[11:05.360 --> 11:09.600]  we're going to charge you so here are the cops involved in a fake bomb threat that's a violation
[11:09.600 --> 11:15.120]  of federal law in the patriot act here are the silverstein people at least the one guy saying
[11:15.120 --> 11:19.360]  i know you don't have a bomb but i'm going to say you do and it's going to be 30 days in the whole
[11:19.360 --> 11:24.400]  we'll finish the clip go to winel but here is the audio and video folks want to see the video
[11:24.400 --> 11:29.120]  become a prison planet dot tv subscriber you can see the whole film or hey go to youtube it's free
[11:29.120 --> 11:34.240]  at youtube but you might want to buy the dvd and support us at info wars dot com as i said earlier
[11:34.240 --> 11:36.960]  you know sometime we've got to get some funds into this operation to continue
[11:37.600 --> 11:43.040]  so we can continue to expose things like this so so what's so important about this is now the
[11:43.040 --> 11:48.800]  new york police at least this this this gaggle port authority police have gotten so corrupt
[11:48.800 --> 11:57.280]  that they involve themselves in in in in literal official oppression threatening to
[11:57.280 --> 12:03.440]  frame someone with private security goons that look like they came out of a goodfellas movie
[12:04.320 --> 12:08.800]  on video and then don't even take the camera away so so they think this is just standard
[12:08.800 --> 12:14.880]  procedure do it in front of god and everybody else here it is it's a public sidewalk though
[12:14.880 --> 12:22.000]  so why are you taking my picture i have every right so you're in a public sidewalk i'm a
[12:22.000 --> 12:27.840]  citizen hey buddy we're out here before so i don't mean over some disrespect can you take
[12:27.840 --> 12:32.640]  your camera out of my face because you disrespect me by doing that so i'm not doing anything legal
[12:32.640 --> 12:38.560]  and he's in his place right now you politely can you take the camera out of my face that's all right
[12:38.560 --> 12:46.640]  all right come on you have every right to know we're not doing anything legal we have every right
[12:53.360 --> 12:59.680]  when ricky comes i think he's got a bomb in his bed exactly i saw why it's
[12:59.680 --> 13:05.440]  in pause right there now if you just joined us earlier i played the clip where they say
[13:05.440 --> 13:09.760]  larry didn't like your larry silverstein and and now they're saying i think he's got a bomb
[13:09.760 --> 13:13.920]  and the other guy goes oh yeah there is a bomb let's continue i'm in his bed
[13:15.920 --> 13:19.840]  the guy even admitted you know i know you're not a terrorist but i'm gonna say you're a terrorist
[13:19.840 --> 13:22.640]  and you're gonna spend 30 days in a hole before they really find out
[13:24.400 --> 13:28.800]  terrorist attack i guess they go away for about 30 days we're we're americans sir we're
[13:28.800 --> 13:35.280]  by the time you're right by the time the government figures it out you'll be in a hole for 30 days i mean
[13:35.280 --> 13:39.600]  just understand just don't record what he's saying don't record what i'm saying hey please
[13:39.600 --> 13:44.160]  give me that favor are you still recording me come on man you have every right to sir i'm i'm sorry
[13:44.160 --> 13:51.760]  but constitutionally illegally we have every right to guess who's going to jail guess who's going to jail
[13:54.960 --> 13:58.080]  all right that's enough as it goes on in the cops come
[13:58.080 --> 14:02.800]  they go along with the fake bomb scare grab the camera say it's a gun but then they have
[14:02.800 --> 14:07.680]  another camera up down the street 20 yards away that catches all that i mean this is insanity
[14:09.200 --> 14:13.440]  now this is probably the most evil video i've ever caught with police and private security
[14:13.440 --> 14:19.200]  working together out in the open trying to frame somebody and he says i know you don't have a bomb
[14:19.200 --> 14:25.200]  but by the time they figure it out you'll be in the hole for 30 days i mean like a gangster from
[14:25.200 --> 14:31.600]  a loony toons cartoon hey bugsy look what we did to him hey get the cops over here they work for the
[14:31.600 --> 14:37.120]  boys hey cops give him we're gonna say they got bomb how's that sound oh that sounds good louis

[18:27.760 --> 18:33.520]  people to the am dial am dial prior to them was known for two things at least the most
[18:33.520 --> 18:39.680]  jurisdictions one was and the other one was i'm also got a difficult order to go and it was like
[18:39.680 --> 18:46.080]  Spanish radio or it was static or you could tell when the lightning was coming in they were integral
[18:46.080 --> 18:51.280]  add to the mix you and what you've done and i mean it from the heart you have redesigned
[18:51.280 --> 18:56.800]  and re-implemented a delivery system that the mainstream media folks better pay attention to
[18:56.800 --> 19:02.480]  because this is not the future this is the present disguised as a future well line on what do you
[19:02.480 --> 19:06.560]  want to get into first you want to roast me first or you were saying you wanted to talk about the
[19:06.560 --> 19:12.160]  talkers conference in the aftermath of uh of that i gotta tell people i gotta tell people you you've
[19:12.160 --> 19:17.680]  got to imagine this now again i in fact i i spoke about this on a line linealmedia.com and and
[19:18.400 --> 19:22.320]  saturday morning new york it's its first thing in the morning folks you don't understand this
[19:22.320 --> 19:27.760]  people are quiet they're wiping the web from their eye and perhaps it is a late night i get
[19:27.760 --> 19:31.600]  the bite and do my introduction and they're sitting there with their bagels you notice the
[19:31.600 --> 19:36.400]  people who are around the the bagels and refreshment table the the snores as they're called you're
[19:36.400 --> 19:40.480]  getting it for free so they walk and they sit down and they'll yell it's no yeah okay
[19:40.480 --> 19:47.920]  i've heard of them and all of a sudden it was elmer gantry on speed meet howard bill
[19:47.920 --> 19:55.200]  meets whatever and they didn't know what to make out of it and i said that's my boy that's alex
[19:55.200 --> 20:00.320]  that's the way to do it so anyway as we were talking people said you know i and and let me
[20:00.320 --> 20:04.560]  tell you something and this is curious and and michael harrison of talkers and others are paying
[20:04.560 --> 20:10.320]  attention to this you know how much as i get older my my hearing is getting bad and i don't mean my
[20:10.320 --> 20:15.760]  auditory hearing i mean i get bored real easy so i need something to rev me up and i'm going to
[20:15.760 --> 20:20.560]  say something i have not listened to conventional talk radio in maybe 20 something years seriously
[20:20.560 --> 20:27.120]  a whole show from anybody it bores me to death in fact do not waterboard me should you ever
[20:27.120 --> 20:32.960]  want to torture me janey don't waterboard me or stress the positions just put on any conventional
[20:32.960 --> 20:38.400]  mainstream media talk show and i will tell you anything you want to know within five minutes
[20:38.400 --> 20:46.800]  just turn that off it's white noise it's blather it's rope repetition it is mind-bearing mind-numbing
[20:46.800 --> 20:52.400]  audio white noise and it but you come along and like i said i'm i'm as you can see what it's done
[20:52.400 --> 20:57.040]  to me right now so anyway so here you come along and i told people i said what you have to do is

[21:59.920 --> 22:06.080]  and and and i wasn't thinking that i was even on radio was like that was on radio and i guess he's
[22:06.080 --> 22:14.640]  like it's midnight alex i'm in bed alex midnight for you but the info war has never stopped and i've
[22:14.640 --> 22:20.320]  gotten seriously let me tell you another another example of why you are you are story is so important
[22:21.120 --> 22:27.200]  and i have told people about this stuff and what you have done is you are believe it or not almost
[22:27.200 --> 22:33.040]  like a NASCAR even talk to somebody who's never heard of NASCAR they think it's i don't know some
[22:33.040 --> 22:38.240]  good old boy goat roper in the middle of nowhere or like smoking a bandit and then they become aware
[22:38.240 --> 22:45.360]  of the enormity of it and they say to themselves where have i been you're like that and this other
[22:45.360 --> 22:52.240]  media are like that you came along a while back with dsa gropey all right so i said this is not
[22:52.240 --> 23:00.320]  there now i am as i said as you said a the next prosecutor that scared me more when i saw what people
[23:00.320 --> 23:06.880]  could do alex in the name of us in the name of the flag in the name of a government in the name
[23:06.880 --> 23:12.400]  of law and order the subjugation little by little the systematic subjugation of people's right
[23:12.960 --> 23:19.280]  and almost applauded to by people who don't know any better who think they're they're supporting
[23:19.280 --> 23:24.720]  you know andy from mayberry who think that they're supporting something and cops are not bad i mean
[23:24.720 --> 23:29.920]  i was a part of that system but anyway but you came along with this dsa thing now sure enough my
[23:29.920 --> 23:35.680]  wife and i were in uh kappa my hometown and everything was fine we left we're going to camp
[23:35.680 --> 23:42.560]  on my left uh newark and everything was fine coming through sure enough they look at my wife who
[23:42.560 --> 23:49.600]  was most attractive yes i met your wife she is she's she's quite the number she certainly is
[23:49.600 --> 23:54.800]  and and and and believe me i'm the luckiest man on the world or in in the world or on the world
[23:54.800 --> 24:00.320]  anyway so he looks at me i'm going through the magnetometer and he's going through the magnetometer
[24:00.320 --> 24:05.440]  uber by everybody's going through it all of a sudden this fellow looks at her and says you
[24:06.400 --> 24:11.920]  we want to give you this scan now we had talked about this and you had alerted me to this and
[24:11.920 --> 24:18.160]  i'm thinking wait a minute this is a backscatter radiation this is rapid scan this is chartoff
[24:18.160 --> 24:25.920]  baby this is this is not some mild passive little this is radiation uncalibrated uncertified
[24:25.920 --> 24:31.040]  virtually unknown i don't know what you're blasting at me and they're recording the images of her
[24:31.040 --> 24:38.080]  naked body yes i mean you know we do all about that thanks to alex joe at least you have never
[24:38.080 --> 24:44.400]  would ask her and pay her money to be in there well especially now because as you know lou uh
[24:44.400 --> 24:49.440]  he was not doing too well in his personal life anyway so sure enough they do this well
[24:49.440 --> 24:55.680]  when she dares to say i'm not going to go through that he again all of a sudden it's like uh
[24:56.560 --> 25:03.360]  sheriff the boss hog it's like the milgram experiment alex to stand for prison all of a
[25:03.360 --> 25:12.320]  sudden this glorified skycap federalize i don't know who he is all of a sudden this guy's authority
[25:12.320 --> 25:17.680]  is being contested by some little lady and he talks into it with me we've got an opt out
[25:20.080 --> 25:27.040]  i mean i said i cannot believe it's like in stars it's like a star trek whenever the engine room
[25:27.040 --> 25:36.160]  is blowing up they're like running around alert and people look at it what has she done and she
[25:36.160 --> 25:41.280]  says why are you doing this to me what are you doing now understand something this is the most
[25:41.280 --> 25:46.880]  amazing i said now let me get this straight sparky let me get this straight which is a great way to
[25:46.880 --> 25:53.360]  start off all cross examination you're telling me that because she has opted out for this particular
[25:53.360 --> 26:01.440]  type of inspection the very inspection of magnetometer which you prefer in 99.9 percent of the time
[26:01.440 --> 26:10.720]  that is not good you must physically grow per to look for what now of course i'm taking picture
[26:11.600 --> 26:16.560]  i'm taking pictures with thank god for the iphone alex steve jobs gets a hold of that
[26:16.560 --> 26:21.680]  and ruins that little ability to record life i think it's called the first amendment they're
[26:21.680 --> 26:28.640]  now trying to have little spy systems that blocky being able to record continue and alex thanks to
[26:28.640 --> 26:34.320]  you and i mentioned this on linealmedia.com i mentioned this on my 90 commentary people don't
[26:34.320 --> 26:40.320]  and and you you must run into this as well people think you're making this up what are you you're
[26:40.320 --> 26:46.560]  making this up making it up it's true i wish i was making it up so anyway now later on to give you
[26:46.560 --> 26:54.480]  an idea i sent this to my friend have you ever been to israel alex i know i haven't okay i've been
[26:54.480 --> 27:01.440]  twice now let me tell you something when you talk about real good at this stuff at the bengurian
[27:01.440 --> 27:08.320]  airport in tel Aviv they could do alex anything they wanted and believe me most people would say
[27:08.320 --> 27:14.000]  you know they've got every right in the world they could physically search you i mean they
[27:14.000 --> 27:20.320]  could do internal searching if they want it but they don't even they don't do it because they put
[27:20.320 --> 27:26.240]  their emphasis on intelligence but think about that when you have somebody who used to be in
[27:26.240 --> 27:33.360]  charge of the department of homeland security this mega robbing naggy and huge governmental
[27:33.360 --> 27:39.520]  collapse who goes into private practice or private the lobby and all of a sudden has this
[27:39.520 --> 27:46.000]  the unique ability to introduce these rapists can't by the way there was a i believe it was a
[27:46.000 --> 27:51.680]  columbia university medical professor who said that especially areas of the head which are very
[27:51.680 --> 27:56.800]  very sensitive to this type of ionized radiation which we don't know how strong it is how how we
[27:56.800 --> 28:02.240]  don't know anything about it but this is this is very very carcinogenic very or or has depended
[28:02.240 --> 28:06.320]  that's even been in the new york times is 20 to 50 times what they first said they're not
[28:06.320 --> 28:11.120]  calibrating them or even following federal law to have radiation tests in every month and they
[28:11.120 --> 28:17.040]  gave congress fake tests and then of course on top of it what about the workers that are around it
[28:17.040 --> 28:22.080]  they're the ones that are really being fried but hey why do they care let me tell you something i
[28:22.080 --> 28:25.280]  told this guy one time i said let me tell you something my friend believe it or not i said
[28:25.280 --> 28:29.680]  these people those don't you're a young man i don't blame you because you couldn't you know
[28:29.680 --> 28:36.240]  how much you look at these people and i don't think they go into this one team to to to
[28:36.240 --> 28:41.120]  bees you know the storm trooper s i don't want to bring in nazi imagery i don't think they start
[28:41.120 --> 28:46.720]  off like this but what happens is that let me tell you something my friend it is a word agent
[28:46.720 --> 28:54.400]  orange mean anything to you what does the lidomized what how how mission how comatose are you what
[28:54.400 --> 28:59.280]  are these days you're going to find some walnut growth in your axilla your armpit and they're

[29:05.440 --> 29:10.000]  x-ray at the dentist they put something on your lap they don't care about you and what's
[29:10.000 --> 29:16.640]  happening i like that this is the most important i i it's it's tragic but it's true there is this
[29:16.640 --> 29:26.080]  thing it's almost it's almost canary the systematic habituation the ratcheting up of more and more
[29:26.080 --> 29:33.920]  control more and more submission subjugating your rights relinquishing your rights for a
[29:33.920 --> 29:40.400]  comatose for a better good terrorism for for this notion of being safer and what happens is never

[35:47.520 --> 35:53.520]  first at prism planet dot tv and it's important with the internet kill switch and the open calls
[35:53.520 --> 35:58.960]  the censor alternative information and youtube saying we were racist and that they were going to
[35:58.960 --> 36:05.280]  shut our account down and we showed the letter because the obama poster of him as a joker is
[36:05.280 --> 36:09.920]  racist according to youtube i threatened legal action against them for violations of terms of

[36:26.960 --> 36:30.720]  get at me and saying he was going to kill her and cops wouldn't do anything so i just sued him that
[36:30.720 --> 36:36.560]  dealt with it real quick um you know somebody says i'm a drug dealer when i don't even use drugs i
[36:36.560 --> 36:42.160]  sue him you know i mean sometimes i got to do it and uh because some things are not entertaining
[36:42.160 --> 36:45.920]  when when you're saying i'm a criminal and now if you're saying i work for obama that's funny
[36:45.920 --> 36:53.120]  uh but we need to have our own media system and so people are always well so what of youtube

[38:15.440 --> 38:20.240]  prison planet dot tv membership now going back to lineal i i know you've been exposing as a former
[38:20.240 --> 38:26.160]  prosecutor the fraudulent drug war i know you're also concerned about this rash of police not just
[38:26.160 --> 38:32.800]  arresting folks in their own front yards but beating reporters up to a pulp uh when they try to videotape
[38:32.800 --> 38:38.800]  them even from 100 yards away or private security guards coming up at city parks and saying we're
[38:38.800 --> 38:45.040]  going to arrest you if you don't stop videotaping i mean they're acting like that the new al-qaeda
[38:45.040 --> 38:50.800]  is anybody with a video camera well see that that's exactly why you know um a alex just a couple of
[38:50.800 --> 38:55.520]  things that i wanted just if i could just to piggyback on what you were saying you know you're
[38:55.520 --> 39:01.840]  excuse me you're you're um your your whole sentiment back i watch it i i i love what you do
[39:01.840 --> 39:06.160]  you inspired me since 88 i was involved in conventionals arrest for your talk radio
[39:06.160 --> 39:10.720]  plain old talk radio and i thought to myself and i'm and i'm serious about this is it i i want to
[39:10.720 --> 39:17.360]  do my own uh podcasting to say what i want not that i've been censored so much but you'd be
[39:17.360 --> 39:22.720]  surprised just when you can talk without having somebody in the other room uh let's say a program
[39:22.720 --> 39:26.640]  director stare at you or somebody on a class tour there's something like when you're in the middle
[39:26.640 --> 39:31.360]  of an impassioned speech is a girl scout troop walks through or you've got a salesman or you
[39:31.360 --> 39:35.520]  have to stop just in the middle of what you're doing because you're going to take a break which
[39:35.520 --> 39:41.120]  is fine i love commerce i love tropicalism that's great so what you did was when i formed lineal
[39:41.120 --> 39:46.560]  media dot com you inspired me and i could do my podcast again it's a nominal effect the cost of a
[39:46.560 --> 39:53.120]  i think it's a maybe a starbucks a month but this is this is what's happening and what i was saying
[39:53.120 --> 39:59.840]  by the way just quickly before we if i could what i did mention about you in our talkers
[39:59.840 --> 40:05.200]  uh introduction at the new media seminar which believe me i don't think in its history
[40:05.920 --> 40:12.960]  since michael harrison did this and he it is the preeminent talk radio talk spoken word journal
[40:12.960 --> 40:17.680]  on the market but what you've done is they said it's kind of impassing it's not a like a joke
[40:17.680 --> 40:22.960]  but you have literally figured every means of communication if smoke signals could ever be
[40:22.960 --> 40:29.840]  tapped you're going to be doing smoke signals if nano technology if if goldfish play this somehow
[40:29.840 --> 40:38.080]  gave out a message you're going to conquer that you you do the dbd's carrier pigeon um tapping on
[40:38.080 --> 40:45.040]  cell walls in prisons if two people can communicate the two cups in the spring and i say that because
[40:45.040 --> 40:52.720]  you have saturated this thing and people say how does this guy do it and i'm saying this is the most
[40:52.720 --> 40:59.360]  important thing this isn't an act but people have to understand about what you're doing and i know
[40:59.360 --> 41:05.520]  this sounds like i'm i'm not being praiseworthy this is true you can't do alex what you're doing
[41:06.160 --> 41:13.520]  unless you really believe it because you're the veneer will come off and you'll be able to see
[41:13.520 --> 41:20.640]  through the transparency so quickly if you don't literally eat sleep breathe what you're saying
[41:20.640 --> 41:26.400]  and that's something which is a key i want everybody to talk radio industry to to listen
[41:26.400 --> 41:31.120]  to what you're saying if you ever met somebody alex who says oh hell i can do what you're doing
[41:31.120 --> 41:36.880]  you just talk for three hours that's easy really sparky really think it's easy
[41:36.880 --> 41:43.760]  okay what you do you go into a bathroom right now and you start talking and do not miss a beat
[41:43.760 --> 41:48.960]  don't bore them don't have them click away because they've got nine million channels
[41:48.960 --> 41:55.760]  that i suppose with more apps than you can imagine lure them compel them pardon me hold them over
[41:55.760 --> 42:03.680]  hour after hour never bore them be sincere and you do it and alex only you would notice have you ever
[42:03.680 --> 42:09.840]  felt when you're done doing it three hour broadcast and you are at you are at to use spinal
[42:09.840 --> 42:16.080]  tabling go at 11 from the get go do you ever find yourself feeling like you like your brain
[42:16.080 --> 42:24.640]  has been cord you are emotionally spent you it is a feeling of almost mental emotional
[42:24.640 --> 42:29.200]  no that's why no that's it's almost every day that's why i went from i got greedy because
[42:29.200 --> 42:33.600]  once i'm on air i have all these points i want to make and i get mad that i didn't cover this
[42:33.600 --> 42:41.120]  issue i didn't my biggest drive is people being conned i get upset by it and and i don't like
[42:41.120 --> 42:45.840]  snakes and con artists and all of their fakery so i want to show people the magic trick
[42:45.840 --> 42:50.160]  but then i realized that i didn't do it properly i didn't tell them all of it and then i feel
[42:50.880 --> 42:55.680]  guilty and so then i'll all do a fourth hour and then it's gotten to where over the years i have
[42:55.680 --> 43:00.560]  to go lay down on a couch for like 30 minutes and on the way to the couch there's salesmen popping
[43:00.560 --> 43:04.480]  up and your wife's on the phone and you're she just dropped the children off and by the way
[43:04.480 --> 43:11.040]  there's a city inspector here and uh and you know two employees are fighting in the back and uh i
[43:11.040 --> 43:18.080]  mean absolutely and uh and and paul watching on his honeymoon paul get up paul but i gotta tell
[43:18.080 --> 43:23.840]  you something there is something about this business if you do it right it's something that
[43:24.480 --> 43:30.640]  it is so important i want to be corny for a moment i i think corny because i'm afraid of of of two
[43:30.640 --> 43:35.680]  things i think you and i are very alike in this respect first of all have you ever done a perfect
[43:35.680 --> 43:41.200]  show i bet you'll say no no they're horrible buddy if you if you ever think you think how did i do
[43:41.200 --> 43:45.680]  that how did i leave that out because that's a perfection you've only got this amount of time
[43:45.680 --> 43:51.120]  and you treat each broadcast like it's your last i get the only one oh does this happen every time
[43:51.120 --> 43:56.960]  i'm gonna go on a trip i'm not afraid of death i get afraid i can die in a plane crash so i always
[43:56.960 --> 44:01.760]  do a whole bunch of extra stuff right before i leave i know well you know one of the things uh you
[44:01.760 --> 44:06.400]  and i share uh and by the way another thing i tell people uh you could always tell a lot about a
[44:06.400 --> 44:11.360]  show by the bumper music and you and i didn't share an affinity for uh the poet lorry de texas
[44:11.360 --> 44:17.360]  towns van zandt and i thought how appropriate when i think of you i think you know all the federales
[44:17.360 --> 44:23.200]  say we could have had him any day and even how it's how interesting how prescient and vatic
[44:23.200 --> 44:29.120]  and titanic that is that poncho and lepti and how that is in many respects correlates to what you're
[44:29.120 --> 44:35.600]  doing because i keep thinking and i don't mean this please i don't mean this uh uh i don't
[44:35.600 --> 44:42.080]  mean to be cute about this because god only knows what you let go through that the public doesn't
[44:42.080 --> 44:48.240]  know about how your beloved wife and family must say could you just could you baby just sound
[44:48.240 --> 44:53.600]  insurance alex please you know could you you please you know this is a great calling but
[44:53.600 --> 45:01.280]  we don't know not being very serious the the uh sacrifices you make to do this because
[45:02.000 --> 45:06.960]  because i i keep telling people you know when you know like you've said many times you can
[45:06.960 --> 45:14.800]  tell you over the target when you start taking black and as long as you hear alex jones on the air
[45:15.360 --> 45:22.720]  you know he hasn't hit pager yet when he does you won't hear him anymore so your success
[45:22.720 --> 45:27.840]  is when we hear a dial tone if we even have dial tones anymore you know i'm saying it's a weird
[45:28.480 --> 45:34.240]  the government but it's not by the way this not obama it's not bush it's the government it's
[45:34.240 --> 45:41.200]  this superstructure it's this it's this amalgam this gordon not this hodgepodge this this this
[45:41.200 --> 45:50.800]  almost supernal superstructure they cannot let this get too popular and ruffle stutters because
[45:50.800 --> 45:56.000]  i gotta tell you something alex this is what i say on linealmedia.com and this twitter i love
[45:56.000 --> 46:02.640]  i'm a twitter fanatic another addiction i've got at linealmedia this is my dream not to to in any
[46:02.640 --> 46:10.400]  way steal from dr king but i have a dream and that dream alex is that one day the government
[46:10.400 --> 46:13.760]  says that when i see the government it could be 20 years from now whoever can charge it
[46:13.760 --> 46:18.880]  doesn't matter state local city austin city council doesn't matter i want people in offices
[46:18.880 --> 46:24.720]  say oh no no we can't do this they'll never stand for this they'll be out in the streets
[46:25.440 --> 46:32.720]  we will kick these people off you don't understand them they breathe they know they vote oh no no i
[46:32.720 --> 46:40.640]  want the government to be afraid of us i want them to tremble at the idea of making not alex
[46:40.640 --> 46:50.960]  jones or not lineal but but anybody upset because it's the opposite we quake we live in fear we're
[46:50.960 --> 46:56.320]  sheeple we're habituated well i think that's the most successful thing i've done not even consciously
[46:56.320 --> 47:01.040]  because i'm just outraged and mad and and and it's not that i even have courage it's in in the face
[47:01.040 --> 47:09.280]  of a bully i tend to attack not run uh flee forward really is what it is um is that i've
[47:09.280 --> 47:14.480]  not been fearful and i think that's been an example of people to stop being cowed and i think the
[47:14.480 --> 47:20.400]  founding fathers said it vifer vendetta repeated it but george washington said it when the government
[47:20.400 --> 47:25.360]  fears the people there is liberty when the people fear the government there is tyranny
[47:25.360 --> 47:31.280]  and it's really just that simple uh and and and government has gotten on a power trip control
[47:31.280 --> 47:38.080]  freaks have filled government now with bad folks they're trying to kick out the good people and
[47:38.080 --> 47:43.680]  uh raising that point uh specifically as a former prosecutor what's your view of the attack on the
[47:43.680 --> 47:49.120]  video camera uh what's your view because you were saying god drug war well this is the first
[47:49.120 --> 47:54.480]  poll as far as this you know years ago alex there was a there was this uh kind of a firewall
[47:55.280 --> 48:02.960]  but there was a time when people actually paid lip service to this bia is international fbi is
[48:02.960 --> 48:09.040]  national uh ns thing is this and so that was this it was an illusory that there was this firewall
[48:09.040 --> 48:16.240]  this compartmentalized your jurisdiction ends here today some very smart people again think
[48:16.240 --> 48:22.400]  15 20 year increments you know this this is that they've got whoever they is but their things plan
[48:22.960 --> 48:30.320]  the idea is that hey guys i don't have to worry anymore about wiretaps when i was a prosecutor
[48:30.320 --> 48:37.040]  we actually had wiretaps this is before technology i used to prosecute alex this is in the in the 80
[48:37.040 --> 48:45.040]  the early well mid 80s obscene phone calls well guess what took care of that one caller id
[48:45.040 --> 48:52.800]  hey isn't that great look at this electronics are good it's electronic keyhole people hey i like that
[48:52.800 --> 48:57.520]  that's terrific surveillance is your friend what's happening too very quickly about i went to the

[54:32.800 --> 54:39.280]  i flew to new york here in austin and coming back through newark uh there at liberty or whatever
[54:39.280 --> 54:46.320]  the name of it is uh we need to get this added as an update to the drudge linked article tsa set
[54:46.320 --> 54:51.440]  to take legal action against texas groping bill they already had perry's minion behind the scenes
[54:51.440 --> 54:56.960]  killed it when an anonymous vote in the house and near unanimous in the senate i had one vote one
[54:56.960 --> 55:03.280]  vote against it they had lined up and uh now because of perry being put on the hot seat
[55:03.840 --> 55:08.880]  it's set to be voted on today no no tomorrow excuse me friday feels like friday because i don't ever
[55:08.880 --> 55:15.680]  have a day off uh so every day is friday lusting after saturday but uh to make a long story short
[55:15.680 --> 55:21.440]  they're threatening a blockade in a lawsuit kind of like the feds always do uh they couldn't pass the
[55:21.440 --> 55:28.560]  epa carbon tax so they just have the um they have the epa do it and then states are suing that and
[55:28.560 --> 55:32.880]  the federal courts are ruling for the epa people thought that ruling earlier in the week was a
[55:32.880 --> 55:37.680]  good thing that oh uh you know some states were calling for more carbon taxes people had oh the
[55:37.680 --> 55:42.480]  feds say only the epa can decide that oh that's terrible they're saying the states have no authority
[55:42.480 --> 55:48.080]  why even have states then but i digress whinal it's awesome having you i'd like to have you uh you
[55:48.080 --> 55:52.320]  know someday uh when i kind of have a smorgasbord of different hosts that fill in over the three
[55:52.320 --> 55:58.160]  hours perhaps have you ride shotgun with watson so you can tease him uh the entire time you know
[55:58.160 --> 56:05.360]  he's the filling host uh how do you like it when watson fills in i'll tell you what i i i like it i've
[56:05.360 --> 56:12.240]  i've i certainly you you cannot replace you um but may i may say something very quickly about
[56:12.240 --> 56:17.280]  why this is very important why this tsa thing is it is very important for this particular and again
[56:17.280 --> 56:21.440]  not the obama administration the government whoever replaces them will do the same thing
[56:22.000 --> 56:31.520]  alex they cannot win there has to be the message sent out that any attempt to thwart to intercept
[56:31.520 --> 56:38.960]  to stop to to interrupt the systematic uh complete control of people their bodies their
[56:38.960 --> 56:44.560]  persons their communications their computers their apple everything will be fought viciously
[56:44.560 --> 56:49.280]  to give and whether it means something or not there might be people in the halls of justice
[56:49.280 --> 56:54.560]  somewhere that said we don't care about tsa it doesn't matter we're going to teach these people
[56:54.560 --> 57:02.480]  a lesson we are not going to let anything go how dare you question your government we're not a public
[57:02.480 --> 57:10.800]  servant we're in charge your minions your slaves how dare you question us well they call it anti
[57:10.800 --> 57:15.200]  government to even have an opinion about what you want in government when that's what freedom is
[57:15.200 --> 57:20.080]  all about uh in closing uh and again folks we're gonna i'm gonna put out some special reports
[57:20.080 --> 57:24.880]  today on a host of issues dealing with this big tsa development watch info wars and prison planet
[57:24.880 --> 57:29.520]  and prison planet dot tv but in closing next time you come back we'll talk about it more but uh
[57:29.520 --> 57:35.120]  briefly your view on the drug war is a former prosecutor it is absolutely the most ridiculous
[57:35.120 --> 57:41.920]  way of time it has resulted in right now a boom for lawyers and judges and jailers and the like
[57:41.920 --> 57:47.440]  the reason why the reason why people are involved in drugs is a very simple thing either to use or
[57:47.440 --> 57:51.680]  to sell and they sell to make money and the reason why they make money is because it's illegal
[57:51.680 --> 57:56.480]  so if you make something legal that is not an endorsement by the government of its use
[57:56.480 --> 58:01.440]  it just merely means alex that if you possess something you are not subject to criminal penalty
[58:01.440 --> 58:08.400]  you'll know that if one of your kids god forbid had sprick nine on them or or cyanide that may not
[58:08.400 --> 58:13.920]  be against the law that's not a schedule one drug because it's gonna get you high it'll kill you but
[58:13.920 --> 58:19.280]  it won't get you high now does that make any sense to you no there's stuff under every sink that'll
[58:19.280 --> 58:24.160]  kill you that are in a hammer but because they don't hype it up and make it a big deal it statistically
[58:24.160 --> 58:28.960]  it's not very dangerous uh look they made the drugs illegal because alcohol prohibition went out
[58:28.960 --> 58:32.880]  they had to have something else to give the corrupt system a cut of the laundered money
[58:32.880 --> 58:36.880]  and that's on record with the big banks caught doing it lionel awesome having a great job to the
[58:36.880 --> 58:47.120]  crew see you back tomorrow 11 am retransmission starts now thank you for listening to gcm visit gcm

[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:34.720]  the new book new york times best-selling author jesse ventura with dick russell
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:40.560]  63 documents the government doesn't want you to read available at info wars dot com we've
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:43.840]  got a deal where you get one of the films free when you get the book with big brother
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:47.280]  your welly and nightmare come true now now governor it's great to have you back
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:53.280]  you're down in mexico right now but we've got you for the full hour some stations don't carry
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:58.320]  this first five minutes so i want to cover some sub issues before we come back and get your take
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:04.480]  on the entire bin laden fable and they're telling us that we've got to give up even more rights now
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:09.760]  that bin laden's been reportedly killed they're announcing the government's going to have alerts
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:15.920]  over our cell phones they're going to have a no travel list now for trains you name it
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:21.840]  we're going to talk about all that with former minnesota governor jesse ventura but getting into
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:28.480]  the no travel thing first so we thought we'd escape the tsa by not flying on commercial
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:33.760]  jets but now they're announcing governor that they want to have these on the roads the highways
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:38.960]  the trains they've been beta testing those what's your view on that well it doesn't surprise me at
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:46.240]  all because alex you know i drive to and from mexico every year and uh after clearing customs
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:52.480]  at the border and it doesn't matter what border whether it's california or arizona when you
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:57.760]  clear customs you get about an hour under the freeway in the united states of america and this
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:03.120]  has been going on for the last six years because that's how long i've been living in mexico and
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:09.200]  minnesota you come to an immigration stop out the middle of the highway where you have to sit
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:15.520]  out there in the hot desert for an hour and a half and clear a second immigration stop so it
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:21.120]  doesn't surprise me because these stops have been going along and very illegal in my opinion
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:26.480]  because you've already shown your passport at the border why are you required to produce it again
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:31.920]  an hour into the united states so you know this is stuff that they've been setting up that i've
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:39.600]  been watching for six years now in my travels via mexico back to the us every year they're just
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:45.120]  expanding the control well let's say they want to protect us from terrorists terrorists they get a
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:48.640]  leak might want to attack a mall they're gonna put tsa in front of every mall well they're now
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:55.360]  announcing they want that uh are they going to their close to 200 000 miles of rails uh over
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:00.080]  two and a half million miles of roads i mean it's impossible to protect all this it's a joke
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:05.760]  uh alex are they expecting i mean the tap is that what they're is that what they're saying i mean
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.560]  i've been down in mexico are they priming us that we're going to get hit again and so they want
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.520]  to be preemptive and that's what they're telling us yes they they've just so have been training for
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:21.280]  years with real checkpoints at bus stations and train terminals but now they're rolling an ounce
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:26.160]  saying al qaeda it's inevitable they're gonna hit in a revenge for bin laden we're talking about
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:31.120]  after the break and so you got to give all your rides up now and we've got to basically have tsa
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:36.240]  train federalized police through the threat fusion centers just sticking their hands down our pants
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:42.160]  everywhere well you know it's it's it's like the old forefather i can't remember who's ben franklin
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.680]  or which one of them said it when when they made the great statement that if you're going to uh
[01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:53.840]  trade your liberty for security well then you have neither and it seems that that's what our
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:04:00.480]  country is willing to do now that we're willing to trade our liberty to be secure i mean alex i go
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:06.480]  crazy right now i mean i have to sue to prove that jessie ventura is not a threat just so i can fly
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:13.760]  commercially i mean what kind of nonsense is going on in this country it's amazing and and
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:18.560]  the more liberty we give up now they say the terror threat 10 years later is even worse we need more
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:23.120]  of your rides they spend trillions of dollars in the last 10 years in the domestic system
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.000]  there's close to a million domestic private contractor spies this is big business and the
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.800]  truth is it's not going anywhere just like the prison industry until we say no that's why they
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:37.920]  made drugs illegal so they could have a black market bring them in and arrest their competition
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:43.280]  for minnesota governor jessie ventura is our guest the book is 63 documents the government doesn't
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.680]  want you to read he'll be with us for the next 55 minutes we're going to get into the whole

[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:19.440]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network thank you for joining us it is tuesday the 10th day of
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:26.560]  may 2011 joining us from the baha in california is former minnesota governor jesse ventura's new
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:31.840]  book uh climbing up the new york times bestseller list jesse ventura 63 documents the government
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:38.160]  doesn't want you to read available at info wars dot com governor ventura out of the gates uh we're
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:45.360]  now nine days into uh the killing of ben laden we were told eight separate times he'd been killed
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:50.640]  we have that those articles up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com they told us buried at
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:55.200]  sea they won't show us the photo because quote conspiracy theorists the president said on 60
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.120]  minutes wouldn't believe it that means people that have been lied to so much they don't believe
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.720]  anything uh and i know talking to you privately that was your point uh but governor looking at this
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:10.720]  situation and the way they've changed the story so many times uh what's your taken view on this
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:16.160]  governor ventura well you know it's hard to have a taken view on it for me alex because as you said
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:22.320]  i'm down here in the baha and i get wind of stuff 48 hours or three days after it happens so you
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:27.200]  guys know certainly more than i do and you know i've been asked people have said to me well
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:33.360]  could we have taken him alive and dot it up i said i can't make any statement on that because
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:39.280]  you'd have to be there you'd have to be part of the operation uh if the navy seals indeed did kill
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:44.800]  bin laden well they're the best unit that doing that because that's their expertise and they
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:50.880]  could accomplish that mission if the mission were indeed true uh do i think it's true or not i don't
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:56.640]  know because my government has lied to me so often i mean look at when they lied about the
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:04.000]  death of pat tilman they lied about the jessica lynch recovery they lied about weapons of mass
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:10.160]  destruction they lied about ties to al-qaeda in iraq so really the government has no credibility
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:17.200]  with me so when i hear a story that they accomplish this and then there's so many other weird things
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:23.200]  about it like they buried them at sea 24 hours later well why and then they said it was muslim
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:29.760]  religion i might be wrong but i think isn't that jewish where you have to bury within 24 hours i'm
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:36.000]  not an expert on religions but uh i'm not sure that that's part of the muslim religion or not
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.400]  no the imams have come out and said that you need to be buried after you've been washed
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:47.520]  force uh facing mecca and that burial at sea is a big no no well okay then there you got it so why
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:53.920]  did they bury him at sea i guess because the navy caught him that's the only thing i could come up
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:59.920]  with but uh no i i you know they won't show us photos they're just telling us he's dead and
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:06.960]  i guess it's worked so many times before alex why wouldn't it work again well you you bring up
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:15.920]  the point of lies it came out last wednesday that white house did not watch uh the live killing
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:20.960]  then they said he fought back and the seals had to kill him and they said he didn't fight back
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:25.440]  and they took him out and then killed him then they said he used his wife as a human shield and
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:32.160]  they said that didn't happen uh and then they won't show us the body i mean this is very very very
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:38.880]  bizarre but but but i can tell you this alex as far as the operational end on the ground being the
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:47.040]  knuckle draggers the seals that did the op um it shows me that policy hasn't changed at all since
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:54.240]  vietnam because in vietnam our standard policy if we were going to do a kidnapping or going to do
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:12:00.960]  something of this order would be you offer the person one time and if the person doesn't fully
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:07.600]  cooperate you then take them out you you know eliminate them and it's that quick so whoever
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:15.120]  the operator if it indeed happened as as they said it went down whoever the operator operational
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:20.720]  leader on the ground was i fully could see why he would be taken out that quickly because that's
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:26.880]  no different than what it was in vietnam that you give one opportunity and if they so choose to not
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:32.560]  exercise that opportunity then you eliminate them well what's amazing is they showed this
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:37.680]  white house situation room and said that they were watching bin laden being killed then they said
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:43.280]  actually that the video cut out for 24 minutes and they didn't watch it and they lied about that
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:48.400]  and then and then jessica lynch for three days she's there at the hospital the iraqis have pulled
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:53.280]  out the doctors go and say please come here and get her jerry brokheimer gets on satellite feed
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:59.440]  the director scripts how to do this staged rescue turns out she didn't fight in the convoy the other
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:04.480]  guys did and then magically those guys all died in a week getting shot in the head or grounding
[01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:09.120]  or running off the road uh with pat tilman he writes letters home saying i'm coming home to be
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:15.360]  anti-war uh he gets shot three times in the head at close range they claim that he was killed by al-qaeda
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:20.880]  till the army corner report came out saying foul play was shown i mean you're at the gulf of tonkin
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:27.840]  the list goes on and on so so bottom line i mean this this looks like an election ploy stunt and i
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:33.040]  don't believe a word of it what's your view well again i i don't know i you know i i gotta delve
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:37.600]  into it i gotta start reading on it when i get back to the states and i'll make a few phone calls
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:43.040]  with people that i know and and see what i can tap on the behind the scenes you know i'm still a
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:48.880]  bit connected to the to the seal units and i can't believe they for that they would knowingly
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:53.920]  participate in a fraud but then again i guess if you're ordered to do something you have to do
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:00.240]  what you're ordered to do uh you know but i i can't see a seal platoon actively participating
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:05.520]  in a fraud unless they pulled a fraud on them too and maybe they had some guy there that looked
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:11.120]  like them lot and then did him in i don't know well that's exactly how they operate that's
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:17.040]  exactly they have decoys people that are set up and and now they released this video of the five
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:23.440]  videos four of them were previously released videos we've gone and shown the exact same video was
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:29.360]  released uh one of them four years ago and but they cut the audio out so it wouldn't be too obvious
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:35.520]  that the one video that's new is that old guy from the side whose ears don't even look like ben
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:41.760]  laudan supposedly watching ben laudan on tv yeah i saw i did see that photograph last night and i
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:47.600]  kind of chuckled at it and i thought that's him and then i thought to myself well then what they
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:51.760]  really did was just shot an old man in his bed right we're sitting there with his wives
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:59.360]  i don't know again i can't comment on what happened on the ground because i'm not privy to
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:04.960]  anything that went down with the actual platoon over there but they could do it make it certainly
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:10.720]  accomplish it if it was real whether it's real or not alex i have no way of knowing
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:17.360]  but you're saying that you do question the official story because you've been lied to so much
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:23.040]  yeah absolutely absolutely i mean for the last decade it's been nothing but lies whether it's
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:28.480]  the bush administration or the obama administration it's why after life like i said we're to the
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:35.040]  point now alex i have to go to court to be able to fly in my own country what kind of country is
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:42.400]  that when you got to go to court to be able to fly and not be searched to prove you're innocent
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:47.840]  every time you go to an airport it's amazing they've now announced today and it's actually set up
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:52.480]  months ago the new alert system was really integrated in years ago they're gonna be breaking out on
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:59.520]  smartphones cell phones computers radio tv with government alerts messages from the president
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:07.920]  forcing you to watch them 9 000 locations 800 walmarts walls are getting telescreens saying
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:13.920]  nobody's safe watch your neighbor trust no one but government i mean is that not 1984 governor
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:19.200]  i don't know why are they doing that alex what what are we supposed to do we're we're all supposed
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:24.800]  to go to walmart and watch them on tv when they come on well it's about them forcing their way
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:31.840]  into our lives uh chuckie schumer and now hamtracks looks like they're gonna agree uh as well as other
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:37.040]  terminals around the country to have tsa sticking their hands down our pants uh have you seen the
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:41.120]  new video the six-year-old having them stick their hands on her pants or the one-year-old baby
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:46.320]  with them pulling the diaper off no i didn't see the one-year-old baby with the diaper but i did
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:51.760]  see the young child i was on with lou dobs that particular day right before i left to go back
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:58.000]  to mexico on the book tour and uh you know lou lou was i raked over and he thanked me for bringing
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.040]  my lawsuit on behalf of millions of americans including himself for standing up for this stuff
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:09.440]  and uh but you know that's about all you can do i mean we we we just got to be vigilant alex and
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:16.480]  not accept this as as normal behavior and what's supposed to be a free country well how could tsa
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:23.040]  if there were real terrorists protect cornfields uh rural areas highways hundreds of thousands of
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:30.320]  miles of train uh they claim the al-qaeda documents that the uh boogie man bin laden had uh so they
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:36.480]  want to go up and derail trains so how is searching everybody that gets on trains and putting them
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.120]  through a no-ride list uh how is that going to stop al-qaeda i mean how are they going to stop
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:48.320]  anybody how many al-qaeda are there i mean i'm trying to figure out if they try to make us
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:52.640]  believe that there's like millions of them out there they claim there's less than a hundred
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:58.080]  in afghanistan uh less than a hundred in pakistan maybe uh a hundred well that means there's more
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:03.920]  health angels than there are al-qaeda right well also jessie let me ask you this question
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:08.400]  absolutely there's more health angels than there are al-qaeda then
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:15.040]  well well here's another question uh if they say he didn't resist and that the seals got him and
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:19.520]  then executed him why have he's the greatest intelligence asset in the world knows where
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:26.800]  all the al-qaeda bodies are buried knows the next attack why execute uh usama bin laden and they're
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:31.600]  telling us tortures great and tortures wonderful because it gets data well then why not take bin
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:36.720]  laden and torture him exactly well that again though that's a question that would happen in
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:42.400]  the field and i can understand the seal operative because if it was the same as vietnam that you
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:48.560]  give them one opportunity if they fail to do that you eliminate them pretty much and that's
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:54.560]  unconventional warfare and that's what the seals are about it's not conventional warfare and uh
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:59.520]  but i certainly would rather capture him absolutely this guy would know everything
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:04.960]  supposedly about al-qaeda why wouldn't you attempt to capture him first so that you could gain
[01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:11.200]  knowledge from this guy to war or to warrant off other attacks or whatever it might be it's it seems
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:17.280]  stupid to just a plane executed him without trying to at first capture him but again well jessie let
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:22.000]  me stop you they can't speak for the guys on the ground who actually did the op i don't know
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:28.080]  sure but my point is sir they changed the story first they said he resisted fired at them that the
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:32.000]  helicopter got hurt by being fired at then they changed that then he used his wife as a shield
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.440]  then they said no now they say he didn't resist they took him and executed him they had him they
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:42.640]  they executed him and the word is if you believe he was killed he had knowledge of being cia in
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:48.560]  the 80s and 90s clinton had a chance to get him in 96 uh in sudan and they didn't want that out so
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:53.040]  they were ordered to kill him then obama said no we didn't order him to be killed so the point is
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:57.280]  we're being lied to they've changed the stories we'll be right back with governor jessie ventura

[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:14.400]  show because there's a war on for your mind governor ventura and i were just talking during
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:20.080]  the break and he was having time to really cogitate on the whole bin laden situation he takes off
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:26.160]  part of the year and goes down and writes books and researches down in the bahá mexico and serfs
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:30.080]  but he was going didn't minister budo the president of pakistan come out and say he'd been killed
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:35.280]  and then she got killed a week later at execution style uh and pakistani intelligence former head
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:41.360]  told me here it was cheney had her killed and and wasn't it uh in 2003 in the election we had
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.440]  madeline albright come out and say he was dead and that bush was thinking about rolling him out
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:50.720]  then walter kronkite did it then teresa hines carry did it and so bush backed off i had steve
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:56.480]  pechenik the guy that co-wrote the books with uh with of course uh you know the very famous uh
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:02.400]  writer tom clancy he was the head of black op operations worked with the seals uh in psychological
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:08.000]  warfare of the delta force he told me in april 2002 governor that that he died a kidney failure
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.800]  and they were going to roll him out later claiming that we'd killed him uh so with all those high
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:17.920]  powered people saying that and then them changing the story so much what does your gut tell you i mean
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:26.000]  you said again it causes me concern over the fact that this guy supposedly was on a dialysis machine
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:32.560]  way back 10 years ago how could he survive that long if he needed dialysis treatments all the time i
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:38.640]  mean i don't know what too many people that are that overly active if they require dialysis treatment
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:46.160]  on a regular basis well he had several diseases uh that on average uh people die within two years
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:53.600]  the longest lived are six total renal failure uh that's why even cbs news reported he was at the
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:26:00.560]  american hospital in quote dubai being treated by american doctors and uh even dan rather went and
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:06.000]  interviewed him and this was just months before 9 11 i mean he was near death then yeah you know
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.520]  and so i don't know i don't know what to believe alex it's it's that's the disturbing thing about
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:17.200]  being a united states citizen today is the fact that you can't believe mainstream media because
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:22.480]  mainstream media is totally bought and sold and they're in bed with the government and you know
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:29.760]  that's their job now is to simply report what the government wants us told and in light of that fact
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:34.800]  you have to learn everything on shows like yours and and on the internet and all these other
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:40.320]  alternative places where you can attempt to get through them and learn the truth but again
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:46.640]  everyone's susceptible to being misled no matter where it is be it the internet or where else so
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:52.160]  it really boggles the mind i'm trying to figure it out that's why i don't like to make rash decisions
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:57.840]  on it i like to look at the thing take my time and do my own studying rather than just simply
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:03.840]  reacting to what media says to me well we're going to get a headline out at info wars dot com
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:08.640]  my writer was just in here during the break uh you know trying to get an answer from me with
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:14.160]  what to go with obviously it's big news your opinion is highly valued out there by independents
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:20.080]  and people that love liberty and i think the the fair headline is governor jesse ventura or jesse
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:28.080]  ventura uh i've been lied to so much uh i question uh or i need more information i mean what should
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:33.600]  the headline be i've been lied to so much i question everything the government tells me it's
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:39.760]  that simple alex and you went on to question they lied about lynch and did a jerry broughheimer
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:47.680]  production they lied about the the murder of pat tilman uh which is unconscionable when they
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:53.760]  tried to turn that into a political staged deal to support their war in political position
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:59.600]  unbelievable they they've lied so often about so many things wmd's i don't know what to believe
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:05.440]  wmd's fake documents on that it turned out they ordered uh the us did ordered england in the
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:10.080]  white house memo to fix intelligence along with us that we were going to go ahead and go to war
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:16.640]  yeah exactly i mean we've been getting lied to for for the most of the last decade it's unbelievable
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:22.560]  so the simple thing is i don't know what to believe because my government lies to me they
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:26.960]  have no credibility with me let me expand on that we're about to go to break with a long
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:34.480]  segment coming up but the new york post uh on may 7th ran a headline the truth hurts and they said
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:39.760]  that governor jesse ventura has since reversed his position uh that he believed ben laden was dead
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:43.360]  well you're just going off what even mainline news was saying that it was believed he was dead
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:48.000]  and they said he's since reversed his position i then searched and i knew you were in mexico there
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:54.640]  was no news on you in over a month since you've been in mexico and i looked for you doing a reversal
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:00.160]  on ben laden you never did it so here they are correct me if i'm wrong saying you reversed yourself
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:05.600]  when you never did it no i've never made it alex this is the first day i've done an interview
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:11.760]  since my book tour and you were on my book tour that's what three four weeks ago uh time magazine's
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:17.440]  out saying that i've reversed myself now that they've uh uh released these videos which a bunch of
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:22.800]  them are old already released it says well jones now has to basically admit he's wrong i did not
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:27.760]  do that i'm right i know it's totally fake i i predicted all this years ago but that's what
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:33.200]  they do they're they think their readers are a bunch of idiots and that's why the mainstream
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:37.600]  media is dying governor jesse ventura folks this book is really waking a lot of folks up available
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:42.400]  at info wars dot com the book is doing extremely well that's why he's back we'll talk about the
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:47.120]  huge success of 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read with governor jesse ventura on

[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.640]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:06.960]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:12.000]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.600]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:23.280]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:28.800]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:33.200]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:39.040]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.800]  i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:48.720]  oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my solar backup dot com that's my solar

[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:25.040]  okay ladies and gentlemen we are back live with former minnesota governor jesse ventura
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:31.760]  i'm alex jones and the website is we ain't got time to bleed dot com we ain't got time to
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:39.520]  bleed dot com our sites are info wars dot com and prison planet dot tv again i'm here reading from
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:48.560]  cbs news dot com uh where they admit that the white house uh issued a photo of them in the
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:54.880]  situation room watching the operation now it turns out they have to admit they watch nothing
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:59.040]  the whole thing was a stage fake but you can look at the photo with hillary with her hand over
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:05.360]  her mouth obama all looking tough they clearly scripted this entire thing and governor just
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:10.640]  going over more of the lies uh we've been told i mean government is constantly being caught
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:16.960]  in lies and and i think it's common sense to a question you know what bothers me here's what
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:25.760]  troubles me alex about the lying is that when we lie to them we go to jail it's that simple i mean
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:31.920]  look at right now in baseball you got very bonds he might go to jail you got roger clemens he might
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:38.640]  go to jail and of course martha steward did go to jail and she didn't go for insider trading she went
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:45.040]  to jail for lying to the government so that's one thing that really disturbs me the government can
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:52.800]  lie to us and there's no repercussions to them they do it all the time and yet when we lie to them
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:59.280]  we face jail time or when they say we lie i mean these new federal laws they've had the last decade
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.520]  have put hundreds of thousands of people in prison where you've actually done nothing wrong
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:09.600]  but then they claim uh that you lied on your finances and they find ten dollars more or ten
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:14.320]  dollars less than you said they go technically you lied it doesn't matter that it's really a
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:20.800]  mistake you go to prison well you know like i said you got the high profile cases like baseball
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:26.560]  and i always question go what what is steroid use in baseball have to do with the government nothing
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:33.120]  you know and and so and it's that whole premise that if we lie to them we go to jail
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:39.360]  and yet it seems every politician in this country lying must be the the major course they take in
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:46.000]  college i don't know i didn't go to college alex do they have a course on lying well what they've
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:51.120]  done is they've tried to break our will and just train us to accept total corruption i want to shift
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:57.440]  gears into another facet of this whole bin laden hoax that's being used to roll out even more
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:02.640]  tyranny they're now saying you've got to give up even more rights al-qaeda attacks are imminent
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:09.200]  they're going to attack everything they've got 160 buried nukes ksm who they've been torturing
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:13.440]  for what is it six years now who confessed to bombing buildings that were built after
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:22.880]  uh he was uh uh uh kidnapped or uh uh given rendition ksm two weeks before 9 11 they released
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:28.800]  a statement claiming ksm said there are buried nukes in europe in the us and bin laden will
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:35.440]  detonate them he has orders to detonate them if he is killed now the the associated press
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:40.960]  in fact let's pull that up on screen ksm nukes buried in america the the mainstream media
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:46.400]  is reporting nukes buried in europe and america from ksm bin laden knows where they're buried
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:52.080]  the navy seals uh are ordered not to kill him that's now the official story but then they do
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:56.560]  kill him as if they wouldn't follow their orders and dick chaney comes out and says
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:05.920]  obama should reinstate waterboarding he told fox sunday uh he told uh chris wallace uh that on
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:11.360]  fox former vice president dick chaney said sunday that president brock obama should be uh uh
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:16.160]  should put waterboarding back on the table and then i want to shift to this article by washington's
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:20.960]  blog us government used communist torture techniques specifically designed to produce
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:28.400]  false confessions and then he has links to the navy seal training and the army training uh and it
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:35.840]  says that they now have announced as of 2009 and that senator levin is commenting on the senate
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:42.000]  arm services committee report on torture declassified today drops the following bombshell
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:46.480]  that the survival evasion resistance this is when you said years ago you know you talk about how
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:51.120]  you've been waterboarded and it is torture and that you'd be happy to waterboard dick chaney
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:58.560]  that they're actually using the uh ser e techniques that seals under special forces are put through
[01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:04.800]  in the basic training now of advanced troops uh in this survival evasion resistance they're not
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:10.560]  teaching them how to take the torture they're teaching them how to torture now that was declassified
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:16.800]  last week governor what do you say about chaney pushing this and then now training the troops
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:22.080]  how to torture well like i said before dick chaney should be a man of his word and he should
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:29.200]  try it first before he recommends it it's that simple dick chaney needs to lie down and be
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:34.160]  waterboarded and that way he'll know what he's talking about because right now dick chaney
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:38.640]  speaks out of ignorance he doesn't know what he's talking about because he's never had it done to him
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:44.800]  so i think the first thing dick chaney should do is volunteer to have it done i just read in
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:51.040]  today's paper that he he's contemplating whether he needs a new heart or not well if he gets water
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:57.440]  boarded he won't have to make that decision anymore what do you make of them taking this training that
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:02.720]  you talked about going through survival evasion resistance school was required back when i was
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:07.680]  in the navy if you were going anywhere into a combat zone they required you to pass successfully
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:13.440]  complete sears school which was called survival escape resistance and evasion yeah now that's
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:20.480]  where you were essentially waterboarded everybody was and you spent the 24 hours at a mock pow camp
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:25.440]  and all of this stuff because he never knew i guess if you were going to face that as a
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:33.360]  reality after you deployed uh as far as teaching people how to do those techniques i think that's
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:40.080]  very very wrong because if you're involved in a war uh you're supposed to treat your enemy combatant
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:45.200]  with a certain amount of respect if they've surrendered to you and i think that as a country
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:51.680]  we should always be taking the high ground and for dick chaney to come out and advocate torture
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:58.400]  again well that means he's putting us on the low ground again because then when somebody tortures us
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:04.720]  or when somebody does something to us we will have no recourse or no high ground position to take
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:11.760]  anymore because the fact is we do it so therefore how can we be morally on high ground at all and
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:18.640]  i dig to ask the question here's a guy with five deferments from the military telling us how what
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:24.800]  foreign policy we should have and how we should operate with enemy combatants or enemy soldiers
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:31.760]  or everything like that a guy who he himself was a coward and got five deferments from the vietnam war
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:39.280]  or how dare him and how dare anybody even give this guy the to bother to listen to him is that bold
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:44.160]  enough for you alex yes sir it is bold and expanding on that bush wrote a book last year
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:49.280]  admitting he ordered torture he'd do it again the army's own report from abu grave admits small
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:54.720]  children were raped in front of their parents that's that's nbc news you want to pull the full report
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:59.120]  you got the will to read it listeners this is what the good guys supposedly do but they're not even
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:03.760]  worried about moral high ground when foreigners do torture it's horrible it's terrible they're
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:09.440]  dastardly they're evil but then simultaneously it's good when we do it they're trying to warp our
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:15.840]  minds but here it is it says with last week's release of department of justice legal counsel
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:20.320]  opinions it is now widely known that bush administration officials distorted survival
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:26.320]  of asian resistance and escape training a legitimate program used by the military to train our troops to
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:33.360]  resist abusive enemy interrogations by authorizing abusive techniques from the sc re sears training
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:38.240]  for use entertaining interrogations so the point is what was declassified last week is
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:44.320]  everybody getting sears training at special forces level now it's not how to resist it it's
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:50.880]  how to do it they're building an army of torturers well then we should be hanging our head in shame
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:57.040]  because that's not i don't care what happens that is not what the united states of america is supposed
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:04.160]  to be about alex and like i said if we if we lose all our moral high ground then uh then we certainly
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:10.080]  have lost the war on terror because uh you know when our constitution and our bill of rights don't
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:15.920]  exist anymore well that means the terrorists have won but i think that that happens internally it
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:20.800]  doesn't happen from the terrorists i think the terrorists are being used as an excuse well i think
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:25.360]  there's no doubt whoever the terrorists are we know it's black ops private corporate criminal
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:30.560]  networks that are doing the lion's share of it um that the terrorists have won and and and the
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:36.880]  government the media are terrorizing us what's your take governor on we were told bin laden's been
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:42.080]  killed after nine and a half years and now they say we got to take more rights the terror threats
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:47.040]  greater well then that means as they kill more than it makes more of a threat i mean when does this
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:53.040]  end well i think the big here's a question i want to ask it now that we've killed bin laden can't we
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:43:01.040]  bring all the troops home yes isn't it time for us to now pack up and come home isn't the war over
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:08.960]  if we indeed if this was indeed the man who masterminded nine eleven and we've now killed him
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:14.000]  like they told us that they have on may first or whatever the date was well then
[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.680]  shouldn't we be getting immediate withdrawal from both iraq and afghanistan and bring all our men
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:28.480]  and women home incredible incredible uh let me raise another point uh jim i mean is that unreasonable
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:33.920]  no it's not it seems to me now we won the war isn't this the ultimate thing was to get the guy that
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:38.720]  it allegedly did nine eleven well now they're saying that although you know i'll tell you
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:45.200]  something alex we needed to capture bin laden you know why we needed to find out how he achieved
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:52.880]  nine eleven because what happened on nine eleven i believe today it was not a controlled demolition
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:59.040]  it was not nano thermite and it certainly was not the pancake effect of two planes hitting a building
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:07.280]  there was something else in play there alex there was a weapon in play that day that i don't even
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:12.800]  know what it is but it's i can equate it to being like a microwave you know how you can take a piece
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:17.680]  of chicken and put it on a paper plate and stick it in the microwave and the chicken will burn but
[01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:25.360]  the paper plate won't yes well something happened that day equivalent to a microwave and by capturing
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:33.600]  bin laden maybe we could find out what weapon he truly has because i just learned there were 1400
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:38.640]  cars toasted that day all over the streets of manhattan no no that's right the cars that didn't
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:43.760]  have anything fall on them were were completely fried but expanding just like a secret helicopter
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:48.800]  reportedly crashed we know they're 30 years advanced what they really have but there's another area
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:53.840]  that if you look at it uh british physicist and others and it turns out the government did measure
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:45:01.680]  this you can confirm it radioactive isotopes used in small nukes were picked up in levels
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:08.720]  off the charts and around the towers no i don't buy that i don't buy that now nukes were not used
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:14.960]  well the radiation was picked up now no i don't buy it because when when those towers went down
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:24.880]  there was less less impact than when they brought down the super dome in seattle and there should
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:32.560]  have been way more those towers literally disintegrated they went into dust and nukes don't do that
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:38.240]  not at that level they would radiation would have been extremely high well i'll tell you tower one
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:42.880]  and two are very suspicious but when you look at seven that's a conventional control demolition
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:49.360]  no it isn't no it was not either because you've you got to read the book where did the towers go
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:56.240]  by dr judy wood the ps ms and p no i know who she is i know who she is i just finished her book
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:01.920]  it's very remarkable well i agree with you the tower one and two were exploded into pyrotechnic
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:09.120]  dust and uh you know things were being ejected long distances but seven you can see the boom boom
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:14.800]  boom boom boom and the and the symmetrical collapse into its own footprint yeah but you also see it
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:21.680]  lathering up a half hour soon where smoke started coming out of one side of the building and one
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:29.600]  side of the building only you had cases the dust was everywhere with with paper if things always
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:37.440]  remember there's a simple thing when megal is is when when when something is hot it will go
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:45.840]  but it doesn't have to go to be hot to go but not everything that blows is hot
[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:52.560]  well i know this they do have a lot of news that day alex but it's a weapon that's beyond
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:56.960]  anything that i know about well i'll tell you what i want to know i want to know why they killed
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:02.160]  bin laden if he knew how to make norad stand down he knew how to have aircraft to maneuvers
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:08.240]  at the best fighter pilots couldn't do at flight 77 at the pentagon uh he supposedly has these
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:13.920]  but we should have captured the guy that should have been the highest priority but again i understand
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:20.480]  if it if it truly went down and the seals made the call on the ground i understand why because
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:25.600]  that's the same policy that we had for the last 40 years here's my issue bin laden couldn't carry
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:31.440]  out 9 11 we know the hijackers were ordered to be led into the us via the u.s. embassy in uh riyadh
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:35.520]  saudi arabia we know the head of the defense language school went public and said atta was
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:40.320]  trained there even you know newsweek admits you know hijackers trained at us bases they were
[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:46.080]  decoys they were set up and following the mo of these people the seals probably thought if they
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:50.160]  did do this mission that they were killing bin laden and they had a lookalike in there who was
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:54.880]  playing part in some drill and then found out it was real and the seals shot him and they threw him
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:59.120]  in the ocean and told the seals good job you killed bin laden that's exactly how the global
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:04.400]  list operate but again that is theory you know that that is going through a theory all i know is
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:09.040]  that the official story of 9 11 doesn't fit into a guy in a cave being able to carry it out and
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:14.000]  regardless governor they've used 9 11 we got the homeland security mic reports two years ago
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.880]  to go after the american people and to take our liberty so it's it's been used i mean we know
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:25.600]  saddam wasn't involved and they tried to frame him for it oh absolutely you know again america
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:32.480]  changed that fateful day and it changed for the worse and and i just have a difficult time believing
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:39.520]  this bearded guy in a cave is responsible for all this i just have a very hard time accepting that
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:44.640]  as being the truth you're right uh i absolutely agree with you and we need to continue to investigate
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:48.800]  it's certainly been used to kill our republic something foreign terrorists couldn't do the
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:52.720]  government no matter what administration is in it energetically attacks the bill of rights
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:57.520]  by the way look at these they still don't admit that we did that show on my tv show alex
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:04.720]  the one on the police state that they pulled after one episode that's right and the network
[01:49:04.720 --> 01:49:08.960]  won't say anything governor you told me privately that what you think the future of the show is
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:13.360]  are you ready to tell folks more about the show getting censored with that particular episode
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:18.160]  well i'll talk about that episode of course it was last year we did the episode on the police
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:23.680]  state where we should produce the homeland security bill that said fema was to build no less than
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:29.120]  six internment camps throughout the country and what i inquired as to who was going in these and
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:34.400]  why these were being built you know we got stiff opposition in washington and of course they came
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:42.000]  down on the parent company of of uh of uh true tv and they pulled the show it were only aired once
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.280]  and now they won't even acknowledge that the show exists and unfortunately you can see it because it
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:52.560]  aired that one time so it's going to be out there on youtube but officially it's not part of the show
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:58.480]  anymore of the 15 episodes we did i guess there's only actually 14 now what about the future of
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:03.440]  conspiracy theory which came out last season as the number one new show then they put it in the
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:09.040]  dead zone friday night still the number one new show for second season uh record audience for
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:14.480]  those guys and uh now uh the you were telling me privately some things can you talk about that well
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:19.040]  just that you know the balls in their court whether it'll be renewed or not i can't say it
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:25.040]  this time i don't know if it will or will not be but uh they had to submit eight new conspiracy
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:30.400]  theories to them and uh so they will look them over and i guess make a determination of whether
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:35.200]  we're back on the air or not but they they haven't promoted us at all so that's not a good sign
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:41.120]  yeah well we should folks try to contact true tv or time warner and tell them put that good
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:48.000]  informative i i i don't do that alex if people want to do that that's up to them but that you
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.640]  know i i won't ask for people to do that at all i uh you know if the if the if people are inclined
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:59.600]  to want to do that they certainly you know i encourage them that they certainly can but i won't
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:04.800]  ask for that at all well i'll say this i mean i know you told me on the road well i'm gonna get
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:09.440]  into it it's not a lot of sweat off your back if they don't want to renew it it's a lot of work
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:14.720]  i mean you guys fly all over the country a lot of research and that that's another problem we
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:20.480]  have alex what do i do about my flying situation now well because i cannot fly commercial anymore
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:24.720]  that's right they don't want to pay for the private jet i know that's probably part of it so
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:30.320]  there is homeland security ruining your tv show yeah very well could be because of the fact that i
[01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:35.920]  you know i have the pending lawsuit therefore i cannot fly commercially so i can't go out on
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:40.880]  location anymore unless they fly me in a private jet and they certainly don't have the budget for
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:45.920]  that i can assure you of that well they're just like the jews in nazi germany first they wouldn't
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:51.760]  let them travel wouldn't let them do business now homeland security headed up by schumer and others
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:57.520]  are saying that you will be on a no-work list no travel list starting with trains aircraft no gun
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:02.240]  by list white house is pushing that just a magic list that they just put you on and they admit in
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:09.200]  the washington post anti-war people pro gun property rights people tea party people are now
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:13.920]  being barred over two million on the list the government just puts you on a list and now soon
[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:20.160]  it'll be how do you find out if you're on the list they you just they won't tell you why you're on it
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:25.200]  you just suddenly can't travel and boy that i mean that's nazi germany right there that's
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:30.880]  ridiculous i mean why can't you go and inquire whether you're on the list or not i mean it seems
[01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:34.880]  to me you should be able to do that well what do you think of them well you might be a terrorist
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:38.960]  governor and what do you think about everybody's a terrorist but the government crooks robbing us
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:44.720]  it's now been confirmed 27 trillion as we broke down two years ago or year and a half ago 27 trillion
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:49.840]  just up until about a year and a half into the bailout that the rest is secret 27 trillion to
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:57.040]  foreign banks and people like msnbc got federal reserve taxpayer money to push propaganda and
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:02.160]  and now we learn what's going on but let's not worry about the bankers robbing us and the dollar
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:07.200]  plunging let's all worry about terrorists under the table governor oh not only terrorists under
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:12.160]  the table but like these three gentlemen i ran into at the golf course the other day they were
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:18.560]  more worried about that we got to stop these unions you know these union benefits that these
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:24.000]  state workers have we got to get rid of that i looked at these guys and said oh you want to
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:31.200]  bust them but you don't want to do nothing about wall street huh oh man well i mean look look look
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:38.560]  they always talk about free market wall street is the main piglet on the uh teat of the hog and
[01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:44.160]  it's a piglet four or five times bigger than the mama hog and the rest of the population is starving
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:49.360]  runt piglets with our bones showing and wall street sitting there bigger than mama sucking
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:54.880]  everything out of the in mama basically it's a vampire pig sucking the blood out of mama i i
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:54:03.040]  got a good idea too alex let's stop benefits for elected officials yes let's truly make it public
[01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:09.200]  service that if you go there to get elected you do public service you don't get your own
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:15.520]  retirement fund you don't get your own medical health care that you have to have the same
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:20.000]  health care than any other government employee has that's a good point they make themselves
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.400]  exempt from the rules we're under and the system that they create for us just like you pointed
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:29.360]  out government can lie all day and never gets in trouble but if they claim we lie we go to the gulag
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:34.960]  yeah we go to jail for it no absolutely we should cut out all benefits for them make them survive
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:41.440]  the same way we have to you know like right now you know they're going to revamp social security
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:46.480]  and all that wasn't it interesting they don't get social security very well said governor we're
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:51.680]  almost out of time we have a deal at info wars dot com that when you get jessie ventura's 63
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:56.480]  documents government doesn't want you to read incredible hardcover wake up anybody out there
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:02.240]  it's only proven admitted crimes and outrageous terrorist events and government drug dealing
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:07.440]  it's an amazing book and you get big brother they're a welly and nightmare come true discounted

[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:33.360]  8882533139 the good news is governor my radio show and websites are exponentially growing
[01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:39.200]  uh your book is way up there on the bestseller list a week after week you know it's interesting
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:44.160]  about it though alex this is my second book way up on the bestseller list and again it hasn't been
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:51.920]  reviewed by any mainstream media to my knowledge absolutely the fix is in yeah no i mean they don't
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:57.520]  review my books at all they ignore them completely they completely ignore them no matter how long
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:02.080]  they stay on the new york times top 10 but here's the difference in the past if they did that with
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:07.120]  a book it would never even make it on the charts now the alternative media the real media is growing
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:12.400]  so fast they're panicking but here's the problem this isn't an internet kill switch that homeland
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:17.200]  security set up it's really an internet takeover system and the government's admitting now they
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:21.920]  may start shutting down alternative media and that they're going to start broadcasting government
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:28.000]  announcements over all media breaking in i mean doesn't that sound like the running man yeah it
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:35.120]  sounds like and boy look should get the truth then won't we alex my goodness i i'll just be it'll be
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:43.280]  just fountains of information and truth for us as steve buchemi said in fargo oh man so much

[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:26.640]  you know i really can't do justice to his amazing bio
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:32.640]  but perhaps i'll try later in the hour but we got so many things happening in the world
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:38.480]  i don't know if i always agree with lindl and russians solutions but i certainly know that he's
[02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:44.000]  got an incredible grasp on history and has been well while just doing a lot of amazing things
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:51.520]  over the last 50 years and of course uh larush pub dot com is just one of their websites
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:59.040]  he's been a presidential candidate um i don't know former ci director called him the best
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:04.480]  private intelligence network in the world uh he was well known back in the 80s for landing
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:09.760]  his helicopter at the cia base in lanley and being received by the director made a lot of
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:14.560]  folks jealous of him and that's when bush went after him and you know i meant to pull that up
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:18.960]  today before the interview um you know just so we could mention you know some of those stories
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:23.360]  we'll see if larush can talk about some of that today but i first wanted to get lindl and russ
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:28.160]  to uh you break down where the state of the world is right now this is a short segment
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:33.360]  long segment coming up in a moment uh but um joining us from germany is lindl and russ
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:40.560]  thank you for joining us good to join you again via video skype uh we see financial times of
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:45.840]  london talking about the end of dollar hegemony the chinese since you last joined us said that we
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:51.520]  are basically already have a technical default uh do you agree with that well it's worse than that
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:56.480]  we are in a general breakdown crisis of the international you know there's the transatlantic
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:04.080]  system everything is about to go down uh we there are remedies but as long as this president remains
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:11.280]  president there's no chance that these remedies will be supplied however as we know now he has
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:18.720]  committed an act with a lie which makes him impeachable now the question is whether the
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:24.480]  impeachment rage will be strong enough to put him out or not but an attempted impeachment of this
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:32.000]  time would cripple this guy and make him more accessible to control our legitimate institutions
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:39.200]  in the united states under those conditions we can be hopeful well i can ask a lot of questions
[02:02:39.200 --> 02:02:42.960]  here but just a preview of what's coming up in the next hour and again we appreciate your time
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:48.480]  and your busy schedule mr larouche what are some of the topics that that you would like to address
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:52.240]  for people out there because i have a lot of questions but what do you think is most important
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:59.600]  right now well first of all is we have a problem with the british uh they are in the sense controlling
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:05.760]  our destiny because we have a president who is nothing but a british asset he's not and he's not
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:12.000]  really a very stable person and he has some very bad policies so therefore that's one of our big
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:18.480]  problems another one is that the entire system a transatlantic system is now coming down we've
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:26.400]  reached a point at which the failure of the last attempt at bailout that this has created a situation
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:33.520]  which europe has not yet corrected which means that right now europe and therefore also the
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:41.600]  united states is on a slide down toward a breakdown as early as sometimes this coming month uh there
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:48.880]  are remedies of course but the question is if this guy remains president is it possible to apply any of
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:57.200]  those remedies which do do exist well when we come back we'll uh cover the waterfront uh
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:04:04.320]  geopolitically what's happening with the banks imploding um grease by design ireland and others
[02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:09.600]  and and i first like to get your analysis sir on because you i mean you do know the angle american
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:14.160]  establishment you're probably better than anybody what their in game is what the strategy your
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:22.320]  stratagem uh is and and and so we can know our enemy and and and then understand why they're
[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:29.200]  doing what they're doing and uh then i want to get uh your forecast on what you believe will happen
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:34.640]  versus what they're attempting to do and then we'll talk about uh solutions and a lot more and and
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:39.920]  then later i notice you never talk about yourself and over the years doing research on you you've
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:48.400]  had one of the fullest most interesting uh lives uh and uh so i think it's important for you to talk
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:55.120]  about your historical uh experiences as well linda larouche is our guest i'm alex jones gcnlive.com
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:05:01.680]  their site larouche pub.com hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:07.760]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling
[02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:12.960]  the rug from underneath americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence on our president
[02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:18.880]  in congress and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:18.880 --> 02:05:24.560]  as american citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:30.880]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:35.920]  government tem geithner bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress
[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:40.640]  is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:48.240]  washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on dvd

[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:05.040]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:10.080]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:15.680]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:20.800]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:26.080]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:30.720]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:36.080]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and

[02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:02.400]  right down the world crisis that you predicted and everything that's unfolding and uh why the
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:06.400]  system has come after you over the years uh will you please i know you like talking about
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:11.360]  yourself joining us via video connection from germany uh where you are right now but i mean
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:16.800]  can you please spend two or three minutes kind of chronicling your life and what you've done and
[02:09:17.840 --> 02:09:23.920]  you know from world war two i mean uh you're 90 years old correct now sir not quite i was born
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:33.040]  in 1922 so you're almost 90 i'm getting cooking it because you look like you're about uh 79 or
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:39.440]  something i'm fortunate in that respect i mean well i mean anyway you slice it you're one of
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:44.000]  the most interesting people that i've ever uh had the pleasure of interviewing i mean i just want
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:50.400]  to say that thank you well listen i know because you never do this uh you and your surrogates don't
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:56.000]  don't do it either please spend some time because i don't think i can adequately uh i mean mark some
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:01.520]  of the high points low points some of the incredible things you've seen and witnessed in your life
[02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:08.080]  well i think that my experience was became significant after world war two during the war
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:12.480]  i was there but i wasn't too significant that i had some experiences and kelp cut him in the
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:19.680]  immediate post war period while i was still in no service and at a later point uh i emerged as an
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:26.720]  economist and i of course i had the advantage that most of the economists are not competent
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:33.440]  in the major things that have to be done in forecasting because they believe in the current
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:40.800]  system of forecasting which is based on the dollar for example or on currencies and currencies
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:47.760]  do not necessarily correspond to the real physical economy and in my view and most of my work has been
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:54.960]  in this area is to force the issue to my forecasting of certain kinds of major events
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:01.680]  which have been always correct where my rivals have been failures because they insist on statistical
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:09.760]  forecasting based on monetarist considerations i based my forecasting on physical considerations
[02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:15.600]  that is what is what are we doing to increase the productivity of our nation per capita per
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:22.560]  square kilometer what are we doing to increase the energy flux density we have for making our
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:27.600]  nation more productive these are the factors i consider and when we have policies which are
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:33.600]  based on a monitor system leaving a wall street system sort of thing that people are worried
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:40.720]  about wall street i'm worried about the real economy and repeatedly wall street always fails
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:45.840]  because it's actually a thief and it's more interesting what they can extract from people
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:52.080]  than for fostering real production for example good example look at china today what is china doing
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:12:01.120]  china is absorbing the industries we have shut down inside the united states and this means that
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:07.280]  we are becoming more and more helpless because we no longer have the food supply we no longer
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:14.080]  have the production the actual production which we as a nation control on which our economy depends
[02:12:14.080 --> 02:12:19.840]  we're now in a very grave crisis and i fear that as long as this fellow remains president
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:25.760]  we're up for it as they say in brit we're going to speak to that and and get into the imminent
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:29.840]  collapse of the euro that you predicted many years ago that that now is mainstream news
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:34.720]  sorrows admitting that there's going to be some type of crack up i want to get into
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:41.120]  to obama and the british connection and where you see things going geopolitically but continuing
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:46.080]  for a few more minutes to talk about little aroush so new listeners out there most of them know who
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:51.040]  you are but you know only have seen a snapshot in the media characterizing you one way or the other
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:55.600]  what happened in the 1980s because you had breakthroughs then when you were actually
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:58.640]  i've talked to folks that were there at the time they say ronald reagan was reading
[02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:05.040]  your intelligence reports uh it was admitted that the director of the cia and the national
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:09.920]  security council people were listening to you and then later of course that's why george
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:16.240]  herbert walker bush came after you and tried to set you up for some things but uh what was happening
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:20.880]  in the power structure that the highest levels of the u.s government were listening to you in the
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:26.320]  1980s there were a number of reasons first of all i was involved in the formation of the fusion
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:33.520]  energy foundation during the 1970s which became a leading science institution in the united states
[02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:42.480]  and while i was doing that i uh ventured into uh other areas i came up with a proposal of what
[02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:48.960]  became known later as a strategic defense initiative it was initially my my own proposal
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:54.960]  based on evidence which i had this then at a later point some of the old boys from the
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:14:03.680]  uh former intelligence services of world war two came in to me and said we like what you're doing
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:12.560]  so i expanded it and then i went on in especially in the very beginning of the 1980s to extend this
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:20.080]  and i had a major part of the retired senior military figures of germany france idly and so
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:25.520]  forth and many in our own country of that same circle and they recognized that what i was doing
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:32.880]  in proposing this that this was the way we should go and we went in that direction except that uh
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:38.000]  bad wrote frankly of course was known that the president at that time wrote reagan endorsed
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:44.000]  this proposal we made a shot at getting it we were frustrated largely because of the liberals
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:51.280]  inside our political system they thought that this was terrible when obvious to us that we could have
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:58.880]  an arrangement in which the soviet union would change its policies to work with us on our side
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:06.080]  so to speak and it was a very good policy a number of soviet leaders agreed with me it really
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:11.840]  just was a good policy well you propose something a different form of sdi though from what it from
[02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:18.560]  the way it was uh sold though correct i mean what was your plan for sdi well the point was is to
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:26.960]  had negotiate which i did with the soviet government before uh the the uh you know a new head was put
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:34.960]  in and with those people we'd had this extensive discussion for several years and in this discussion
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:42.160]  we outlined what the problems were the danger of a nuclear war fought through the atmosphere and up
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:49.840]  unto space and how much better it would be to resolve our problems step by step first of all
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:55.920]  to realize that we cannot have a thermonuclear war therefore the idea and you cannot have a war that
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:02.240]  would not be thermonuclear among matronations therefore we had to find an agreement on modus
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:09.040]  operandi and there was a lot of agreement that's why we had the german french italian general
[02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:13.760]  officers and people like that in high ranking positions as well as in the united states who
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:19.680]  agreed with this uh but then as as you know that you need certain forces in the united states
[02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:24.880]  including the politicians killed it because they used all this alarmist nonsense and then
[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:30.320]  of course the head of the soviet union would come in then was a real problem he was a british
[02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:36.880]  asset ascension and govartroff his successful real succession was a mess and still is from the present
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:44.480]  day so that these we lost the fight and then people like george hw busch he'd done pretty much a
[02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:49.600]  slob I wouldn't want to give too much credit for him for intellect he's all whimpering windy old
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:56.480]  george and his son isn't any better so they moved in a different direction and it was decided to get
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:02.400]  rid of me it was actually an assassination plot was set up through the department of justice
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:11.920]  the president's circles then reagan killed that they kept at it and they went to frame me up and
[02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:17.600]  get me in prison they tried to find a court they could do it in and they got it now then after
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:22.000]  about five years of that incarceration I came back out and did the same old thing I always did
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:27.600]  and I'm still doing it today and I'm in a great time and building a youth movement
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:34.480]  which is science oriented and classical culture oriented and we're doing a good job
[02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:40.320]  with a limited number of people and I think we have the seeds of a good future coming out of
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:46.720]  that process now there's a demand for it throughout the world I think we can do it all right
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:53.520]  a decent present well very very interesting is the best website for folks to visit la ruche pub
[02:17:53.520 --> 02:17:55.440]  dot com because I know you have several
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:02.480]  what is the best website for folks to visit
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:09.920]  well I think we're running the best right now because we do have we don't we're not that prolific
[02:18:09.920 --> 02:18:17.200]  we produce about three to four products a day as which are broadcast and webcast as they say
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:23.120]  I think it's the best it's some of the best scientific work done today because one of our
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:31.120]  big functions is we have a science group which is a factor in science in the world today this is
[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:38.160]  what we work from largely we also specialize on music because my understanding is that the
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:44.640]  ability to perform physical science is typified by cases like Max Planck and Einstein that all
[02:18:44.640 --> 02:18:50.960]  the great scientists or most of them were involved in as classical musicians some with a professional
[02:18:50.960 --> 02:18:57.280]  quality like Einstein or Planck the classical musicians and so this idea of a classical culture
[02:18:57.920 --> 02:19:03.200]  as the foundation for physical science and its progress is the conception we work from
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:08.640]  therefore we do tend to recruit people as recruits who have some scientific background
[02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:12.000]  and we have a team that's made some very important discoveries
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:17.200]  in on their own in this brief field all right a little loose we've got to go to break
[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:22.880]  we come back we'll get into the hardcore issues here today the imminent collapse of the euro what
[02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:29.200]  that means what the Anglo-american establishment's goal is what they would do if they're unimposed
[02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:34.000]  uh what you believe is going to happen in your forecasting it's all coming up with
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:42.800]  Lyndon LaRouche straight ahead I'm Alex Jones of info wars.com and prisonplanet.tv stay with us
[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:48.320]  and then economist George Humphrey will be joining us in studio coming up today as well
[02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:53.520]  to talk about a host of issues not just the economy stay with us we'll be right back
[02:19:53.520 --> 02:20:01.680]  since 2007 the federal reserve and the US government have injected as much as 20 trillion
[02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:06.720]  dollars into the economies of the world and yet the globe's economies continue to contract
[02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:13.120]  our government is borrowing 58 000 per second if they stop spending the economy collapses if they
[02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:19.040]  continue spending the economy collapses and if they raise interest rates the economy collapses

[02:22:13.680 --> 02:22:18.800]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:24.080]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:22:24.080 --> 02:22:29.200]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:33.760]  lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:06.880]  some people will say hey why are you interviewing linden larouche well hey i've actually done
[02:24:08.240 --> 02:24:12.240]  15 16 years of research and got a lot of good information out of it i don't totally agree with
[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:19.600]  everything but that's what free and open debate in society is about uh is looking at all perspectives
[02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:26.320]  and that's why reading from the washington post january 15 2006 some officials find intelligence
[02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:31.760]  network useful norman mayle former national security council advisor recalls that's the real
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:36.720]  government that soon after he joined the national security council he received a call from nsc
[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:41.520]  officials asking him to talk to a group of uh followers of right wing presidential candidate
[02:24:41.520 --> 02:24:45.920]  notice they call him right wing and then they call him left wing uh larouche who was offering
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:50.560]  intelligence information to the agency bailey said the nsc senior director of international
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:55.680]  economic affairs said he found the visitors intelligence on economics and foreign affairs
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:25:00.480]  surprisingly on target and then the washington post goes through this whole saga and it was
[02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:05.600]  really going on before that so i just want new listers to understand uh that this guy um
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:11.200]  i mean just if you read the whole history it's it's amazing linden this is a short segment big
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:16.800]  long 18 minute one coming up but you've got the floor where are we right now economically in the
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:22.320]  world they're having to more and more admit we're really in a depression what is the banking cartel
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:27.280]  based in london in new york what is their goal what's happening to the euro what's happening in
[02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:33.520]  greece what's coming here well there's a long-term trend which is centered on certain people in the
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:41.440]  united kingdom which is the desire to reduce the human population to some people say two
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:52.080]  billion people some say one and recently the one is preferred the policy of the so-called
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:58.800]  green revolution people that is the anti-technology people is precisely that and for example the
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:06.640]  worst case right now happens to be in germany where the green change is heading and it means
[02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:13.120]  a disaster for the total population of germany it's a weaker in france where they do have a
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:18.960]  dependency upon nuclear power uh in lee does not yet have nuclear power they once did but
[02:26:18.960 --> 02:26:24.560]  let's take it away from them so we're in that kind of situation but the worst of it is that
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:31.760]  at this point with this president the who is nothing but a british public and i do
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:38.480]  it's no exaggeration whatsoever one knows his affinities for the british royal family
[02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:42.640]  and for their policies we've never seen such groveling by a president
[02:26:43.680 --> 02:26:50.880]  pardon me we've never seen presidents groveling like this bowing down to queenie they created him
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:57.760]  how do you think all the money was cooked up under very suspicious circumstances to overwhelm
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:06.000]  the presidential campaign with him with money behind it not my view is some of the people
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:10.720]  using this money should have gone to prison because the tactics who are being used by
[02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:17.120]  spreading a fund which is coming largely from drug money and similar kinds of sources and
[02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:22.320]  splitting it up into little pieces and then putting the pieces into the campaign of the
[02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:30.240]  presidential candidate they overwhelmed with sheer money overwhelmed the legitimate campaign
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:37.920]  which was being run for the president now on the basis of his debt to the british who put him
[02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:43.840]  into office inside the united states with his flood of money we now actually has got control
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:50.880]  over the presidency there are people in the united states particularly older people who are less
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:59.520]  political and more uh should we say institutional who understand this and we are prepared to dump
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:07.360]  this bum from office now we have the perfect ground for doing so we had a ground out of the 25th
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:13.280]  amendment on him earlier it should have been exercise it was not now we've caught him in an out raid
[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:21.040]  outrage of an impeachable offense against the united states in a fraudulent policy on warfare
[02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:26.640]  in the medium we have him there there's some weaklings in the united states who are afraid to
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:34.240]  close in on this guy but i know if he is not thrown out of office very soon and i mean in the weeks
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:41.440]  immediately ahead this united states cannot survive the kinds of conditions which we're
[02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:47.680]  going into in the month of july doesn't mean we're going to collapse in july but it means
[02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:52.240]  we're going through a process which will collapse somewhere a lot in the summertime we're already
[02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:58.960]  seeing bizarre flash mobs and riots popping up all over the united states right now that's
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:06.160]  there well you have two of them one has like twitter twitter operates a riot creating operation
[02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:12.880]  two just who it's normal operations but behind the what twitter does as just an organization
[02:29:13.760 --> 02:29:19.840]  twitter as an organization is control control from the top and you have a generation of youths
[02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:25.200]  who have a very poor orientation in life it wasn't their fault it was given to them
[02:29:25.200 --> 02:29:29.760]  mr louis stay there long segment coming up i want you to get into the euro what the angle
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:34.320]  american establishment goal is your ideas to fix it in fact i'm going to just give you the floor
[02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:38.640]  for 18 minutes when we come back i'll have a few questions i throw in but i want you to really
[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:43.760]  finish up with twitter and then flesh out to understand it what is the angle american goal

[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.960]  talking to linda louge 50 plus years uh you know researching all of this where is the world right now
[02:35:31.680 --> 02:35:35.280]  what is happening with the economy what's going on with the euro what's happening with greece
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:41.680]  what's happening with all the war clouds uh gathering uh where do you see the world right now
[02:35:41.680 --> 02:35:50.960]  well first of all we're headed toward a general collapse uh throughout the transatlantic region
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:57.440]  is centered of course in europe and centered in the united states but it's extended throughout
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:04.400]  the americas it's extended into africa and through parts of asia this is the area that's in trouble
[02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:10.160]  right now it's coming down one problem is you have europe that is continental europe
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:15.680]  which is part of a system called the euro system with its own currency or euro currency
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:21.440]  it's always this form of globalization in which the nation nations are losing their sovereignty
[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:28.560]  at a rapid rate in order to become a members of a blob of an assortment of nations this thing is now
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:34.640]  in the process of coming down the breakdown of the process was established in new york city
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:41.520]  by a gentleman called strauss kahn who was at that point the head of the imf the international
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:48.080]  monetary fund and he was caught in the attack attack which was considered rape of a woman
[02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:54.080]  and for that he was picked up on at the plane side before he could board the plane to france
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:59.360]  he then went some time in reikers island the famous prison in the york city area
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:04.320]  and he's now sitting on the roll with a little special attachment to his
[02:37:06.480 --> 02:37:13.200]  shoe and there he assists a wedding trial which would be in some duration the significance of
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:21.120]  this is that strauss kahn's elimination from the operation killed the bailout operation
[02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:28.480]  which had been intended now the effect of the inability of that crowd to get a bailout going
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:36.160]  again resulted in a deterioration because what you're getting is a bunch of money which is not
[02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:44.320]  money you're getting electronic money not even electronic electronic fake money which is out
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:51.680]  there which is a bailout this stuff has no redeemable value except to collect debts from
[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:58.240]  victims including countries that are victims including the united states we are being looted as a nation
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:04.400]  there's our people are being with it our industries are being moved our states the four states are
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:09.520]  working in the state of bankruptcy now because they can't meet the debt requirements to bail
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:17.200]  themselves out at the end of the sestral year all the parts of the nation are being crushed by an
[02:38:17.200 --> 02:38:22.640]  accelerating rate for example our military is on the threat right now the military of the united
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:29.600]  states is going to be slashed massively if that something is not done about it and that's going
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:35.920]  to leave us in a very strange degree of vulnerability not because of foreign wars as such but simply
[02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:42.640]  because our military is one of the final institutions which is still more or less functioning every one
[02:38:42.640 --> 02:38:50.320]  of our institutions is crumbling if we do not get this bum out of office now and the grounds existed
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:57.760]  under the 25th amendment for some time the grounds now are of course his violation of the war powers
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:03.920]  act for which he should be thrown out of office as a crime against the nation with other whatever
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:09.760]  penalties apart being thrown out of office go with that but he's not and as long as this bum
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:16.480]  with these practices as president remains in office he will continue to do everything to
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:22.400]  destroy the united states if we don't get him out you could kiss the united states goodbye
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:28.960]  will you still be able to kiss that's where it stands now there are many options we have
[02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:35.040]  wonderful options in the united states if we chose to use them we could rebuild our entire
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:43.120]  central model system in the united states we could create industry and create a agriculture
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:48.560]  where it does not exist or where it's being destroyed the destruction of agriculture by the
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:54.240]  storms which have hit during the recent period have destroyed the food supply of the united
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:40:00.240]  states to a critical degree in the immediate period ahead and there are no plans to restore it
[02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:05.040]  the farmers of bankrupt they have no credit available to meet the crimes they couldn't go
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:11.600]  with something now the whole region of the mississippi river the olympia basin the new
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:18.880]  Missouri basin the food supply is being destroyed again we're talking live to linden larouge who
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:25.920]  really needs no introduction of larouchepac.com and larousepub.com um linden uh 20 years ago you
[02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:32.320]  said nafta gata globalism would do this to us that was part of this deindustrialized program
[02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:38.720]  but but but what is the british model of of of this corporate imperium going to do when it's
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:44.480]  built up china and and russia and others are still standing and when their main command base
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:52.720]  their main uh titan the united states is is accelerating uh its debilitation i mean what is
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:59.760]  is what is the method to that madness uh and and a and then b uh you have a report out uh dealing
[02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:06.480]  with obama in violation of the war powers act why are they becoming so arrogant in his speech
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:11.920]  yesterday saying i don't even need to discuss the constitution anymore i mean this uh what is he
[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:16.720]  getting us ready for well what you have to remember our system of government was unique
[02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:24.800]  it went founded it was at the time we had won the revelatory war we had a great problem of debt
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:32.080]  the debt of what became the respective states of that period there was apparently no solution
[02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:40.400]  because the each of these states of the united states was vulnerable to this debt in danger of
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:44.800]  going in a bankruptcy and the british was just waiting to move back in and take us back over
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:51.600]  to that method alexander hamilton who was a protégé really a benefit fragment introduce the reform
[02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:58.080]  which established our republic on the constitutional system rather than a collection of states
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:06.640]  in other words we departed the european standard of states the maybe a centralized form of government
[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:11.840]  with the central government and went to a system which is based on a system of national credit
[02:42:11.840 --> 02:42:19.600]  this was this was the basis on which the constitution was written therefore our system in contrast to
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:27.360]  the european uh monetary systems our system is in his is horribly by virtue of our constitution
[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:34.720]  a credit system not a monetary system now whenever we uh rozel of course put us back on the monitor
[02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:41.120]  on the credit system in his presence it was undermined and then in 1990 it was destroyed
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:47.200]  by the repeal of the glass steel act which had been the bulwark of our entire recovery
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:54.640]  during the 1930s and thereafter so that destruction in 1999 of the glass steel act
[02:42:54.640 --> 02:43:00.480]  opened the gates for a complete takeover by the british international monitorist interests
[02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:09.280]  that today is our problem now we can get out of this mess all we have to do is an act re-enact
[02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:16.880]  the original glass steel act of 1933 which was functioning more or less up until about 1999
[02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:24.080]  once that's done then all the foley money the mall street money and the british money
[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:31.920]  goes into the a different department of banking is not a part of the federal debt it's a part of
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:39.120]  the market for speculative investment the wall street market therefore once we pass our stable
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:48.240]  if we do it and there's a strong movement for that now if we do that then we are able to get rid
[02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:56.000]  of several or tens of trillions of dollars of foley debt which the nation is now carrying
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:02.160]  which is ruining our states destroying our population we can reverse that process
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:09.680]  obama is the advocate of the british interest he's attuning the british they own him they control
[02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:16.640]  his mind he's just an agent who is bought whose presidency was bought by a vast influx of drug
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:23.680]  money and other corrupt currency but for this drug money flood which brought obama into the
[02:44:23.680 --> 02:44:29.440]  presidency he would not have been president and that's the situation so now we're deployed
[02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:35.760]  where the policies of obama are the enemy of the united states the enemy of our existence
[02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:40.640]  we're not talking about a long term enemy we're talking about a sharp term we could be destroyed
[02:44:40.640 --> 02:44:47.200]  irreparably within a few weeks of that explain the technicals of that because the the collapse
[02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:53.520]  uh by design i mean they're on record engineering it to to absorb uh greece ireland
[02:44:54.080 --> 02:45:02.080]  iceland is resisted uh they they now admit is inevitable into idly portugal i mean can you
[02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:08.000]  lay out the technicals of how you you're saying in a few weeks this could accelerate uh break down
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:14.720]  that chain of events we would the point is if you acknowledge if you try to recollect
[02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:22.560]  what the british essentially control which is a worthless debt the mass of many trillions of
[02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:29.680]  dollars and more they're actually quadrillions of phony value out there clamoring for being fed
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:37.200]  all we have to do is pass glass table again now with the understanding of what we've been through
[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:44.080]  if we do that these guys will go bankrupt their faint phony claims against the united states
[02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:48.240]  because that will further implode the current ponzi scheme they've gotten and to quantify it
[02:45:48.240 --> 02:45:53.440]  correct me if i'm wrong they've created 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives they bought off our
[02:45:53.440 --> 02:45:58.400]  governments to buy into the debt and it's a black hole if we don't pull out of it there's no hope
[02:45:59.360 --> 02:46:05.040]  exactly the point is the debt we have is not legitimate debt of our government under our
[02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:10.720]  constitution therefore that debt would go back to wall street and wall street would have to find
[02:46:10.720 --> 02:46:16.720]  its own resources to pay the debt the phony debt that it created okay what do we do when they hold
[02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:23.120]  this hostage as they openly do and implode the stock market uh do we then just arrest them for
[02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:28.720]  financial terrorism because they're on record in europe and the us threatening to implode things
[02:46:28.720 --> 02:46:35.920]  if they can't hold us hostage uh so so so what's the process there because it it is truly us or them
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:42.080]  and and they are the fraudsters and and uh but but any governor that goes after him any grand jury
[02:46:42.080 --> 02:46:47.200]  any congressperson as you know they get busted for something or their their plane blows up so
[02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:57.440]  so how do you how do you stop them very simply glastigal if we reenact the 1933 glastigal act
[02:46:57.440 --> 02:47:05.040]  which was canceled in 1999 if we do that we are immediately in a new situation in which the only
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:11.200]  currency the only credit system operating is the united states government's treasury system
[02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:19.440]  we then have to use the power of the treasury under those conditions to utter credit not money
[02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:25.600]  credit we give credit to the projects which we think are worth the public investment in them
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:31.600]  we support private industries and so forth which are going to do this like agriculture
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:37.440]  we have a crisis in agriculture in the united states we have a food supply which is insufficient
[02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:43.600]  for our total population right now we can get that back if we put the investment back into the
[02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:52.560]  Mississippi uh the Iowa and the Missouri river areas alone these areas will give us a growth
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:58.320]  in food supply we have major projects infrastructure projects not what they call infrastructure
[02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:04.560]  but real ones like no opera we can change the character and improve the character qualitatively
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:10.240]  simply by using public credit to loan it in the places where it will do the most good
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:16.400]  with the from a strategic standpoint for example take the state of of california the state of
[02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:23.520]  california is dying under these conditions we can rescue it we have other states three other
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:29.120]  states that are dying right now under this other terms of the president and that's what the bankers
[02:48:29.120 --> 02:48:34.480]  want because when we have the imf world bank documents when their policies implode things
[02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:39.600]  further they come in and buy things after putting on the dollar then they implode it more more more
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:45.680]  that's why they buy into the malthusian view and the social Darwinistic view that their their
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:52.480]  psychopathic activity is a favor for humanity of course they adopt these bankrupt uh you know game
[02:48:52.480 --> 02:49:01.280]  theory philosophies uh and ran corporation ideas uh because it feeds uh you know in as a rationale
[02:49:01.280 --> 02:49:06.880]  for what they're doing but at the end of the day they're destroying the very civilization uh that
[02:49:06.880 --> 02:49:12.160]  that they've been that they fed off of they're actually in danger of killing their host if they
[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:17.200]  are successful uh in the end won't they destroy their own system as well but they're but their
[02:49:17.200 --> 02:49:23.040]  predator instinct can't be stopped this is all intentional the intention is to reduce the world
[02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:30.320]  population from over seven million peoples to one in the shortest possible time if you understand
[02:49:30.320 --> 02:49:36.320]  that then you know what's going on if you don't understand that you really don't know what's going
[02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:43.680]  on this the point is you're looking at a whole system and the system was born with the founding
[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:49.120]  of the roman empire the roman empire the original one collapsed but then it was revived as Byzantium
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:55.760]  that collapsed it was revived as a crusader system that collapsed and then after a whole
[02:49:55.760 --> 02:50:03.040]  series of wars in europe it was established as a new empire with William of Orange who were
[02:50:03.040 --> 02:50:08.080]  carried the flag of the new Venetian party from the Netherlands into England and Ireland
[02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:17.840]  and did a lot of killing but his his outcome of his actions with the 70 years war which concluded
[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:26.000]  in 1763 established the British kingdom as an imperial power on the planet including his control
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:33.600]  of of India his control over what Nova Scotia Canada and so forth so that this was the fight
[02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:38.480]  we stay there stay there little illusion let's come back and finish up with that key area on
[02:50:38.480 --> 02:50:46.080]  the other side please continue so basically we're seen as weevils that have invaded their grain

[02:54:22.080 --> 02:54:28.400]  guest training is via video skype from germany now you were getting into their their plan for world
[02:54:28.400 --> 02:54:37.840]  population uh reduction i mean look at california going into the total implosion 30 plus percent
[02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:43.200]  unemployment even 60 minutes in an analysis that admitted that last year their answer is
[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:49.440]  ram through a 20 plus percent carbon tax on california i mean if that isn't proof
[02:54:49.440 --> 02:54:57.520]  of the economic genocide what is uh lindelrush well that's what you're getting you're getting that
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:03.760]  there is real genocide and it's intentional and the obama administration is an instrument of
[02:55:03.760 --> 02:55:09.680]  that policy of genocide if you look at the policies which are uttered by the obama administration
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:16.960]  itself is apart from many other sources inside the united states you find that only obama and
[02:55:16.960 --> 02:55:23.680]  what he represents and his immediate cronies are the people who are behind in the health care in
[02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:32.240]  other fields to increase the killing rate of what is considered an excessively large us population
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:39.680]  so we're not involved in a fillable quarrel we're involved in an existential issue are we
[02:55:39.680 --> 02:55:46.720]  going to be human or are we going to be cannibals that's where we are if you go with obama you're
[02:55:46.720 --> 02:55:52.000]  for the cannibal cult glides that's what we're headed for is that why they put him in because
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:57.040]  he's black and they thought that would give him political cover because it's admitted that the
[02:55:57.040 --> 02:56:02.800]  carbon taxes proposed at Copenhagen would kill at least a billion people if they were implemented
[02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:08.240]  within five years and that was just the first rollout and and they told the third world hey go
[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:12.880]  for this we're going to tax the west give it to you then they got the treaty and it was right at
[02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:18.960]  double the taxes that the west would pay on people making less than two dollars a day it was a death
[02:56:18.960 --> 02:56:25.440]  sentence i know i know i know you know but i mean how do we stop these people they're they're
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:33.520]  madmen they are criminals and we have to understand that we have to establish our government again
[02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:40.960]  free of the obama syndrome and also the george you know debbie bush jr he said which is almost
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:46.160]  as bad not quite as bad as obama what is your view of the political field right now uh in the united
[02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:53.920]  states barbie what is your view of the of the political candidates i think what we have now
[02:56:53.920 --> 02:57:01.760]  is we have among some senators and among members of the of the house representatives and in terms
[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:08.080]  of the leading institutions of the gubernatorial system has a lot of good people in it we have the
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:12.880]  ability and we're pushing for the glass tigger re-enactment and it's a very serious and it's a
[02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:17.440]  growing movement right now we're moving to reinstall glass tigger that'll change the whole game
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:25.360]  we in the united states with our government as long as we control it has a capacity to create
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:31.280]  credit we can put the united states back to work so it's policy they could turn this around
[02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:36.560]  anytime they wanted to but they don't want that to happen what happens if we don't i mean couldn't
[02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:42.080]  we impeach obama there's more than one way to skin a cat uh i mean couldn't we go after obama
[02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:46.800]  for the war powers issue i mean ron paul was on this two days ago he said it's absolutely impeachable
[02:57:47.520 --> 02:57:52.720]  he's impeachable on that ground he's impeachable because he's insane also and he couldn't be what
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:59.120]  he is if he weren't insane this man is a mental case of a certain type he thinks we have 57 states
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:04.800]  he doesn't even know the ages of his daughters now yet there's news today asking if obama was
[02:58:04.800 --> 02:58:12.960]  starting to have mental problems he's crazy but he's in it like like the uh famous nero emperor
[02:58:12.960 --> 02:58:19.840]  nero he's got the same syndrome of the emperor nero is psychologically but the point is he's
[02:58:19.840 --> 02:58:27.200]  used as a tool by the british monarchy personally that is he is not an agent of some conspiracy
[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:32.720]  he's an agent of one conspiracy an agent of the british monarchy all right we're back in one minute
