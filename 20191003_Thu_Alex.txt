[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:10.000 --> 00:27.000]  Well, it's well known that under Obama, the backman Joe Biden, the sellout to China was even more intense than it had been under the Clintons.
[00:27.000 --> 00:36.000]  Bush turned a blind eye to a lot of it, but the Clintons aggressively sold out basically all the secrets we had in the 90s.
[00:36.000 --> 00:45.000]  Missile secrets, technology transfers, one-sided trade deals, led them into the WTO as a developing country under different rules to totally screw us.
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  It's all one-sided.
[00:47.000 --> 00:58.000]  But when Trump came out in a speech today and said, oh, I might ask China about the corruption of the Bidens, the media's spinning it, that they mean Ukraine.
[00:58.000 --> 01:10.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's a threat to China that we know your backman is Biden, and Biden and his company's got over a billion dollars for it, and I'm about to bring down your spies.
[01:10.000 --> 01:19.000]  The media's trying to spin that that, oh, see, he's a traitor. He's putting pressure on foreign countries to go after Americans that he's running against.
[01:19.000 --> 01:25.000]  Biden isn't going to make it to election. Watch. He's had another stroke. He can't talk.
[01:25.000 --> 01:34.000]  But the big treason is transferring missile secrets and completing that, and Obama did that as high treason. Here's the report.
[01:34.000 --> 01:46.000]  While Congress engulfs itself in fantasy impeachment world, while the squad Hollywood, Silicon Valley and the media push racial guilt, totalitarianism and division deeper into our culture,
[01:46.000 --> 01:54.000]  while the U.S. border remains open to enemy infiltration and our bureaucracies protecting that border are demonized.
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  Close the camps now! Close the camps now!
[01:59.000 --> 02:07.000]  The U.S. Customs and Border Protection has apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years.
[02:07.000 --> 02:18.000]  The Texas Department of Public Safety has reported that border security agencies have arrested several Somali immigrants crossing the southern border who are known members of al-Shabaab,
[02:18.000 --> 02:24.000]  the terrorist group that launched a deadly attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya.
[02:24.000 --> 02:37.000]  While Chinese opioids pour into our country and while active-duty military suicides reach record highs and the U.S. military focuses on politically correct diversity,
[02:37.000 --> 02:44.000]  the Communist Chinese subtly announced that wiping democracies off the face of the earth is now a reality.
[02:44.000 --> 02:56.000]  During their 70th anniversary celebration of Communist rule, President Xi spoke of how Chinese Communist Party Leader Mao Zedong had stood in the same spot 70 years ago
[02:56.000 --> 03:05.000]  and declared the founding of the People's Republic of China paving the way for the country to embark on the path of the great rejuvenation of China.
[03:05.000 --> 03:14.000]  Xi said, no power can shake the status of our great motherland, no force can stop the progress of the Chinese people in the nation.
[03:14.000 --> 03:30.000]  As a parade displayed the Deng Feng 41, a 7,672-mile-per-hour intercontinental ballistic missile that is said to have the furthest range of any nuclear missile and could reach the U.S. in 30 minutes.
[03:30.000 --> 03:37.000]  Tell us about this missile, why it's such a national security nightmare for our country.
[03:37.000 --> 03:46.000]  Well, it's the idea that they have, they had 20 of these missiles, a very old-fashioned obsolete kind for most of the last few decades.
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.000]  Now suddenly they've got 90, they're able to reach any target in America in 30 minutes or less.
[03:53.000 --> 04:00.000]  Each one can carry 10 H-bombs, that big round sort of nose cone you saw.
[04:00.000 --> 04:10.000]  The shape of that nose cone is that the 10 H-bombs can fit inside and each one be separately targeted against an American city or a small town or an air force base.
[04:10.000 --> 04:22.000]  A hypersonic weapons arms race is now in full swing as U.S. company Lockheed Martin is developing a tactical boost glide weapon for DARPA and a hypersonic conventional strike weapon.
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  Thank you, Obama.
[04:24.000 --> 04:39.000]  Raytheon and Northrop Grumman are teaming up to build engines for hypersonic weapons. Raytheon is also working on defense capabilities against hypersonic weapons while Russia is developing a hypersonic glide vehicle.
[04:39.000 --> 04:51.000]  But back here in Cuckoo Land, fools like Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi weaken our defenses and set the U.S. on a course to submission to the communist infiltration of every asset.
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  No Americans, shut up!
[04:53.000 --> 04:59.000]  How do you envision working with Mr. President on the key democratic agenda items, lowering the crypto drug costs?
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  My friends, I've seen a lot of Donald Trump just like you have.
[05:03.000 --> 05:16.000]  And my goodness, yesterday's press conference, when they came in on him with all their garbage, the foreign reporters, the U.S. reporters, these little political sell-outs, these whores, he just tore them to bits.
[05:16.000 --> 05:23.000]  And it's one thing to hear it if you're a radio listener, it's powerful, but if you see it, it's all at band.video.
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  You've got the full press conference, we've got my boil-down of how epic it is, it's all at band.video.
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.000]  And I just, you've got to share this with people, because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  This was amazing, and he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[05:37.000 --> 05:46.000]  So in full wars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening, and we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at band.video.
[05:46.000 --> 05:53.000]  And I got to tell you, we've done great video work, we've done great films, we've done so much, but websites are not our thing.
[05:53.000 --> 06:08.000]  Now they are, I'm so proud of band.video folks, check it out, there's a lot of new features band.video.
[06:23.000 --> 06:40.000]  Here is a report that came out just before you and President Nenisch to walk out here, that the whistleblower met with the staff member of Adam Schiff.
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  I love that question.
[06:42.000 --> 06:46.000]  It shows that Schiff is a fraud, and I love that question.
[06:46.000 --> 06:47.000]  Thank you, John.
[06:47.000 --> 06:48.000]  Can I finish asking?
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  Yes, there's nothing to finish.
[06:50.000 --> 06:56.000]  So the whistleblower, according to this report, met with a member of Adam Schiff's staff.
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.000]  You got it right there, you know it?
[06:58.000 --> 07:01.000]  I hate to say it, it's the New York Times, I can't believe they wrote it.
[07:01.000 --> 07:02.000]  Your response to the fact that-
[07:02.000 --> 07:03.000]  Maybe they're getting better.
[07:03.000 --> 07:09.000]  Your response to the fact that that happened, and that Schiff may have learned some of what the whistleblower knew prior to the completion time.
[07:09.000 --> 07:12.000]  Well, I think it's a scandal that he knew before.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  I go a step further, I think he probably helped write it.
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  Okay, that's what the word is.
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.000]  And I think it's- I give a lot of respect for the New York Times for putting it out.
[07:21.000 --> 07:24.000]  It just happened, as I'm walking up here, they ended it to me.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  And I said to Mike, I said, whoa, that's something, that's big stuff.
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.000]  That's a big story.
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  He knew long before, and he helped write it too.
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  It's a scam.
[07:35.000 --> 07:36.000]  It's a scam.
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  Just to finish on this, I appreciate it.
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.000]  I love that second question, by the way.
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  Should have asked it first.
[07:42.000 --> 07:46.000]  But let me just tell you, the whole thing is a scam.
[07:46.000 --> 07:49.000]  The Mueller deal was a scam.
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  The Russian collusion was a scam.
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  You can ask Putin.
[07:54.000 --> 07:58.000]  Nobody's been rougher on Russia than Donald Trump, okay?
[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  Now, with that being said, it would be great to get along with Russia.
[08:01.000 --> 08:04.000]  And we will get along with Russia, because it's smart.
[08:04.000 --> 08:08.000]  But nobody's been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump.
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  I don't know, but Adam Schiff has never been afraid of a microphone.
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  He's never met a camera he didn't love.
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  And frankly, he's never met a camera he didn't lie to.
[08:17.000 --> 08:22.000]  Adam Schiff is basically the justy smolette of Congress on steroids.
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.000]  I've never seen anything so ridiculous.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  And if a Republican member of Congress tried to get away with this,
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  the media would be all over them.
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  They wouldn't just accept it.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  You had people, what was it, Buzzfeed today?
[08:34.000 --> 08:37.000]  Well, it doesn't really matter that Adam Schiff lied to us,
[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  because he's pushing our agenda.
[08:39.000 --> 08:41.000]  He's pushing our narrative.
[08:41.000 --> 08:44.000]  More importantly, Sean, the American people see it.
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  They get it. They see Nancy Pelosi.
[08:46.000 --> 08:49.000]  Oh, we'd like to maybe talk about health care and maybe USMCA.
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  They haven't done anything in three years, Sean.
[08:53.000 --> 08:56.000]  They haven't tried to do one single piece of legislation.
[08:56.000 --> 08:57.000]  The reality is this.
[08:57.000 --> 09:00.000]  They hate Trump more than they love America.
[09:00.000 --> 09:06.000]  And more importantly, they want to resist Trump more than they ever wanted to work for their constituency.
[09:06.000 --> 09:07.000]  It's disgusting.
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  This president has accomplished unprecedented things.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  Imagine what he could do with a little bit of cooperation from the Durham Democrats.
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.000]  Just a little bit.
[09:16.000 --> 09:17.000]  And he's got none of it.
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.000]  That he can do what he has done, despite unprecedented incoming,
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  unlike anything any president has seen before, is truly a miracle.
[09:26.000 --> 09:33.000]  Joe Biden promised Ukraine a billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company.
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[09:38.000 --> 09:39.000]  You're fired.
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  But when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption,
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  the Democrats want to impeach him, and their media laptops fall in line.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  They lost the election.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  Now they want to steal this one.
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  Don't let them.
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  I'm Donald Trump, and I approve this message.
[09:59.000 --> 10:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, October 3, 2019,
[10:05.000 --> 10:07.000]  worldwide transmission.
[10:07.000 --> 10:14.000]  I don't want to apologize to listeners, but I did yell and scream and say a lot of mean things yesterday,
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.000]  and I meant every word of it.
[10:18.000 --> 10:25.000]  But still, I really had a big, powerful, informative, professional show lined up for you.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  The problem is, I overprepared, and that is when I tend to blow up.
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  Over the years, I've learned these patterns.
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  Sometimes when I'm the most unprepared, I have some of the best, most in-depth broadcasts,
[10:36.000 --> 10:37.000]  because I'm already super prepared.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  I've already done a ton of research.
[10:39.000 --> 10:47.000]  It's just that when I sit here for three, four hours getting ready, it's almost, I don't want to say depressing,
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  but it's frustrating.
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  And I understand that it frustrates you as well.
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.000]  A lot of people tell me, tune in for years.
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  I know it's accurate, but then I just kind of give up.
[10:58.000 --> 11:03.000]  But then something really bad happens, and then I just realize I've got to tune back in,
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.000]  and then I've got to take action.
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  And listen, I totally get it.
[11:06.000 --> 11:13.000]  If I ever got off this horse, if I ever got off this treadmill, I'd probably never come back.
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  I used to run like six miles every other day, lift weights two hours a day.
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  I was addicted just to the endorphins.
[11:19.000 --> 11:25.000]  And when I was about 22, I was already successful in local TV and then talk radio,
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  and I needed to go full-time.
[11:27.000 --> 11:30.000]  So I basically quit working out.
[11:30.000 --> 11:37.000]  Just for a month or two, I was making a film, because I was working 18 hours a day to get that done and do all the other jobs,
[11:37.000 --> 11:40.000]  including my day job.
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.000]  I literally worked 20 hours a day a lot of days for weeks, would sleep four hours a night.
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  I mean, a lot of companies and medical degrees and, you know, things are done like that,
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  but I'm not the only guy that does that.
[11:51.000 --> 11:52.000]  Millions of Americans have done it.
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  In fact, behind most success, there's that type of work.
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  But somehow, after I didn't work out for a few months, I just never went back for 10 years,
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  and I gained almost 100 pounds.
[12:04.000 --> 12:11.000]  And I use that allegory of, I know why Americans are punched out of politics,
[12:11.000 --> 12:15.000]  because it just seems so daunting, so big, so out of control.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  But I'm here to tell you, you don't have a choice.
[12:20.000 --> 12:29.000]  If you submit to this, it's going to be a lot more hellish and a lot more hard work than actually fighting it.
[12:29.000 --> 12:33.000]  I mean, being a slave is not fun in a technocracy.
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.000]  And this isn't like, oh, you know, the time of our children is going to be really bad.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  People have been saying that for 50 years.
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  Well, it's the time of the children and their children.
[12:42.000 --> 12:47.000]  There's grandchildren out there since folks were saying, if we keep letting America go socialist,
[12:47.000 --> 12:53.000]  if we keep letting America go communist, if we keep letting the morals be taken out of society,
[12:53.000 --> 13:00.000]  we'll end up with a huge, decadent, evil system with pedophilia, bestiality, broken families,
[13:00.000 --> 13:07.000]  devil worship, killing of the already born, killing of the old, drug addicts, homeless everywhere.
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  It's here.
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  We have arrived.
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  And it's like arriving at the foothills.
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  You're kind of climbing up a foothill and it's kind of rough and tough until you go over that foothill
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  and you see a real mountain.
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  If you think stuff's bad now, these are the foothills.
[13:27.000 --> 13:28.000]  It's kind of like coming to the edge of a forest.
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.000]  There's a little three foot, five foot, 10 foot trees.
[13:31.000 --> 13:32.000]  You keep marching a couple hours.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  You're in 100 foot, 200 foot trees.
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.000]  If you want to use, you know, evil being trees or evil being mountains or how about evil being rat holes?
[13:39.000 --> 13:43.000]  We're a little bit down the rat hole, but we're in the rat hole.
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  We're in the spider hole.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  And just those three videos I played, there's a lesson to all of them.
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.000]  You know, I like Don Jr. He's a great guy, smart guy, but he's holding back.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  Some of the Democrats hate Trump more than they love America.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  They're globalist.
[13:59.000 --> 14:05.000]  They openly say they hate the country and then it sucks and it's the worst nation on earth and it was never great.
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.000]  It'll never be great.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  So see, stop sugarcoating.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  Well, that sounds extreme to say they hate America.
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  It's true. It's true. No more games.
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  Only admitting how bad it is will fix it.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  Stop it.
[14:20.000 --> 14:27.000]  An example is the video that the RNC put out has 100 million views as of this morning.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  Just the two copies I went and found.
[14:29.000 --> 14:30.000]  Well, guess what?
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  I went back before the show.
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  One of the videos was already gone.
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  Then there was another video that was viral that I saw last night that I was going to give the producers.
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  It had millions of views last night.
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  It's gone.
[14:41.000 --> 14:48.000]  They're taking the RNC videos down on Twitter and Facebook because Biden said so.
[14:48.000 --> 14:51.000]  Think we're down the rat hole a little bit here.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  Last year it's Alex Jones.
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  This year it's the RNC.
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  It's Mitch McConnell's Twitter and it's Donald Trump.
[14:59.000 --> 15:06.000]  That's why Kamala Harris is running around saying take Trump's Twitter away from him.
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000]  And all the reason they're taking these videos down is it shows Joe Biden two days ago going.
[15:11.000 --> 15:12.000]  I never met with Ukrainians.
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  I know nothing about my co-kid alcoholic son.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  Oh, he left that part out.
[15:17.000 --> 15:18.000]  He got washed out of the Navy.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  You got kicked out of the Navy.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  And then was given this job looting billions.
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  It's not millions.
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  He told you about it six years ago.
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  Yeah, six years ago we broke it.
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  So there's a lot of angles to all this, but those videos have been taken down because Biden's saying,
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  I know nothing.
[15:38.000 --> 15:39.000]  I never met Ukrainians.
[15:39.000 --> 15:40.000]  I've never been there.
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  All these photos with him, the Tucker Carlson guy, because there's more out now, not just the one.
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  Videos are reportedly about to come out.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, but you got to decide which side you're on.
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  Listen, I know our general audience has.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  I'm talking to all the folks that tune in that think this is funny.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  It's not funny.
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  My fellow freedom lovers, I'm very excited to bring you Vaso Beats.

[17:24.000 --> 17:29.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[17:33.000 --> 17:34.000]  I sued the IRS in one.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.000]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[17:43.000 --> 17:44.000]  I can help you too.
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com,
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.000]  that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[18:23.000 --> 18:30.000]  Now it is teaching to shut up like China do.
[18:30.000 --> 18:34.000]  Hey, I told you, don't go to ban that video.
[18:34.000 --> 18:37.000]  I'm watching you.
[18:37.000 --> 18:40.000]  Our system has been adopted worldwide.
[18:40.000 --> 18:45.000]  Soon, we will kill you if you don't do what we say.
[18:45.000 --> 18:50.000]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[18:50.000 --> 18:57.000]  Do what CNN says and do not visit ban that video, or I have to hurt you.
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  And all the preparedness items like water filtration, air filtration,
[19:24.000 --> 19:27.000]  storable foods, shortwave radios, and so much more.
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  This is a huge special.
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  We need to sell a lot of product to fund ourselves,
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  and these sales are a great way for you to get great prices,
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  but also support the M4.
[19:36.000 --> 19:37.000]  Please take action today.
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  I've got to end this sale by Sunday or Monday at the max,
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  because a bunch of the items are about to sell out.
[19:43.000 --> 19:46.000]  Again, too many deals to fit them all in here.
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.000]  Just please go to M4store.com and realize you're in this critical time,
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  but the global is trying to take us off the air.
[19:51.000 --> 19:55.000]  Your support is absolutely essential, so thank you.
[19:55.000 --> 20:01.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[20:01.000 --> 20:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:10.000 --> 20:23.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central,
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  the broadcast that the globalists of their chai come.
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  Minions have worked to shut down.
[20:28.000 --> 20:35.000]  You see your live on air in defiance of their eat-it that we've been taking off.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  I am in your hands.
[20:37.000 --> 20:41.000]  Infowars is your weapon of truth.
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  You decide how to share it.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  You decide how to promote it.
[20:45.000 --> 20:52.000]  You decide how to protect it and fund it and pray for it.
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.000]  If you have my commitment, then I'll never back down.
[20:55.000 --> 20:56.000]  I'll never give in.
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.000]  I can't be bought off and I can't be intimidated.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  I can be destroyed, though.
[21:01.000 --> 21:06.000]  That process is going to be extremely damaging to the globalist.
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  And I am extremely honored.
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.000]  But just to understand, the punch we throw with Infowars,
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  its might and its strength is your will and your support, your prayers.
[21:18.000 --> 21:25.000]  And you put your will and support into that fist, it will crush you and me like a hammer.
[21:25.000 --> 21:33.000]  We've already put a lot of strong blows into their ribs and into their eyes and into their kidneys.
[21:33.000 --> 21:39.000]  But when we get done with the globalists, we are going to rip their head from their shoulders
[21:39.000 --> 21:43.000]  and throw them into a pit politically.
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  Now let's get into it right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.000]  Let's break it all down.
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  President Trump threw down the gauntlet today,
[21:58.000 --> 22:02.000]  and his latest statement will play at the start of the next segment when I go over it all.
[22:02.000 --> 22:11.000]  But the media, again, did their best job to spin what was an open threat and a dropping of the hammer.
[22:11.000 --> 22:17.000]  Because Trump wouldn't trot that out unless he was about to use it.
[22:17.000 --> 22:21.000]  So we'll break that down to the hair, lips, the admiral, start of the next segment.
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  I'm going to get to it.
[22:23.000 --> 22:28.000]  But I need time to break it all down.
[22:28.000 --> 22:38.000]  This country is in a war, and it's important to analyze who the Axis powers are versus what America is and what America represents.
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.000]  And it's critical to understand there's forces from both sides inside each other's nations.
[22:43.000 --> 22:50.000]  But it's been set up by the globalists that China was to absorb and dominate what's left of Christendom
[22:50.000 --> 23:00.000]  that would then be overrun with Islamists to complete our journey into Balkanization and a divided and conquered great game strategy.
[23:00.000 --> 23:08.000]  Well, the globalist gambits have been failing because their plan is inherently authoritarian and inherently unfair
[23:08.000 --> 23:14.000]  and inherently devoid of paying attention to history.
[23:14.000 --> 23:17.000]  We'll talk about that as well next segment.
[23:17.000 --> 23:21.000]  And then I said I'd get to this yesterday, but I didn't. But I will.
[23:21.000 --> 23:29.000]  In fact, I'm going to get to it at the start of the next hour.
[23:29.000 --> 23:37.000]  I'm going to spend several segments playing video for the official Communist Chinese 70th anniversary that happened two days ago.
[23:37.000 --> 23:41.000]  One day ago here in the U.S.
[23:41.000 --> 23:48.000]  And just how ominous the whole situation is and how illustrative it is of the type of system we're facing.
[23:48.000 --> 23:54.000]  And then Communist Chinese adopted policy.
[23:54.000 --> 24:10.000]  Books written by the Communist Party adopted as their war college doctrine for unrestricted warfare.
[24:10.000 --> 24:17.000]  And they admit in the manuals that are public that I will show you.
[24:17.000 --> 24:22.000]  That are actually free online. It's on scribe.
[24:22.000 --> 24:26.000]  How they're shipping fentanyl in to kill us.
[24:26.000 --> 24:33.000]  And how Democrat Party cities are on Chinese mafia payrolls and are willfully delivering it.
[24:33.000 --> 24:42.000]  And that's why they're saying everyone can lay out on the streets. Everyone can do it because they've been paid to kill their constituents.
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  Now I'm going to read to you from the Chinese Pentagon.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  That's next hour.
[24:51.000 --> 25:03.000]  So remember when Nancy Pelosi says MS-13 are God's children, that's because they work for the Chinese mafia, which is the Communist Party.
[25:03.000 --> 25:08.000]  Same Chinese mafia that's attacking the folks in Hong Kong. It's interchangeable.
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  Chinese mafia just became the Communist Party.
[25:11.000 --> 25:17.000]  Most of their leaders were the grandpas in the Chinese triads.
[25:17.000 --> 25:22.000]  Democratic parties 100% against this country and Obama handed over the codes.
[25:22.000 --> 25:28.000]  Obama handed over everything and that's all confirmed be classified.
[25:28.000 --> 25:38.000]  This was all allowed. This was all prepared by Brennan and other America haters.
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.000]  And the Pentagon knows all this.
[25:41.000 --> 25:49.000]  You know, I could play you the Joint Chiefs of Staff expert on China, the expert, the Pentagon.
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  Would you like me to play an hour-long interview he did saying all this?
[25:53.000 --> 25:59.000]  Would you like me to, you know, I'll just read what the Communist Chinese Party military official doctrine is.
[25:59.000 --> 26:08.000]  It's to ship in thousands of tons of fentanyl enough to kill 100 billion people.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  You just caught 25 tons coming in, 50,000 pounds, that's enough to kill.
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.000]  I said 10 billion, 606 million.
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.000]  The epic times of the analysis said it's 11 billion.
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.000]  That's a Justice Department number. We rounded down.
[26:21.000 --> 26:27.000]  It's actually, if you use the actual medical number, it's 10 billion, 606 million, and change with who's counting.
[26:27.000 --> 26:34.000]  That's just one shipment. Just a couple of containers.
[26:34.000 --> 26:39.000]  So just remember, when you see Democrats, they're in on the human smuggling.
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.000]  They're in on the illegal aliens, who they keep as a slave class under them, who they make sign up for welfare,
[26:43.000 --> 26:49.000]  who they then skim off of, then make the illegals work three jobs.
[26:49.000 --> 26:57.000]  They're knowingly all in on the plan. You have to understand, they are in on the plan, even down to low-level leftists.
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.000]  Low-level Antifa, children of professors, children of government workers, children of time-warner executives.
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  We've infiltrated their groups in Austin. They're not even communists.
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.000]  They are Satanists who are into pure evil and wanting to hurt people and loving the evil plan,
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  and they're actually following the directives of Mao Zedong.
[27:16.000 --> 27:22.000]  Now, I've told you that a lot, but it's in mainstream news today, even the London Guardian is saying,
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.000]  but they're saying it's a good thing that Xi Jinping is a neo-Maoist,
[27:27.000 --> 27:34.000]  and is actually realizing the dream of Mao and David Rockefeller.
[27:34.000 --> 27:40.000]  So that's all coming up, but you really need to understand what's happening in the full evil.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  Even down to low-level Democrats, that's why they're so evil, why they're so hateful.
[27:44.000 --> 27:53.000]  They've been led on the plan, they've accepted the plan, and they believe they're going to rule.
[27:53.000 --> 27:58.000]  Because our elite opened the drawbridge for the Chai comms.
[27:58.000 --> 28:04.000]  The country's 99% gone, but 1% can turn it around any time we want.
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.000]  1% started the Revolutionary War, 3% won it. It's always been that way.
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  And we're going to defeat the Chai comms and the Democratic operatives,
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.000]  but you wonder why they fight so hard, why they're so vicious, why they're so hateful, why we can't.
[28:17.000 --> 28:24.000]  Because they're criminals whose backs are against the wall and who are going to go all out.
[28:24.000 --> 28:33.000]  But these are enemy combatants. Feinstein, Schiff, Hillary Clinton.
[28:33.000 --> 28:36.000]  These are actual enemies of the country.
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.000]  Consciously, under the Ford Foundation, Rockefeller, and Carnegie Endowment,
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.000]  their entire adult lives, they have been on the enemy team.
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  They're not traitors, they're enemy generals.
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  You understand that. We'll be right back with the big news.
[28:49.000 --> 29:18.000]  I'm Alex Jones. This is the Info War. Tell everyone we're live and the American Resistance is on fire.
[29:19.000 --> 29:23.000]  If you're drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[29:23.000 --> 29:26.000]  you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[29:26.000 --> 29:33.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.000]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.

[29:52.000 --> 29:59.000]  That's 800-506-6740.
[29:59.000 --> 30:04.000]  You know I'm angry because I'm not just going to sit here and take this scientific dictatorship
[30:04.000 --> 30:07.000]  that admits it's putting cancer, viruses in the vaccines,
[30:07.000 --> 30:12.000]  it's putting fluoride in the water to brain damages, and that it's trying to literally destroy our families
[30:12.000 --> 30:18.000]  and organize us into a bunch of dumb-down slaves so they can then carry out or orderly extermination.
[30:18.000 --> 30:24.000]  I'm not putting up with it. And our information, our truth, is devastating to these scumbag Satanists.
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  But we've got to stay on air. And I make it easy for you to help us stay on air.
[30:27.000 --> 30:30.000]  We sell products that are high-quality directly to you,
[30:30.000 --> 30:33.000]  so we have to worry about the globalists harassing our sponsors.
[30:33.000 --> 30:38.000]  And these are amazing supplements, amazing products, amazing books, films, t-shirts, you name it.
[30:38.000 --> 30:41.000]  All of it is about spreading the word and all of it's about being healthier.
[30:41.000 --> 30:45.000]  InfowarsStore.com, double-patriot points right now, store-wide free shipping,
[30:45.000 --> 30:49.000]  50% off all the high-quality supplements, and so many other big deals on apparel you name it.
[30:49.000 --> 30:51.000]  Just please take action during this critical time.
[30:51.000 --> 30:57.000]  InfowarsStore.com or AAA-253-3139, whatever you do, take action.
[30:57.000 --> 30:59.000]  InfowarsStore.com.
[30:59.000 --> 31:04.000]  The country is happening right now. President Trump is trying to remove the swamp,
[31:04.000 --> 31:09.000]  the globalists that have been feeding on our nation and selling us out to the chai comms and others.
[31:09.000 --> 31:17.000]  That's why Nancy Pelosi has come out and said that the Attorney General Barr has to resign because he's corrupt.
[31:17.000 --> 31:22.000]  That's because they know that he's getting ready to move against the deep state,
[31:22.000 --> 31:26.000]  that there are sealed indictments against McCabe and others.
[31:26.000 --> 31:31.000]  Already two weeks ago, the appeal by the Deputy Attorney General was rejected.
[31:31.000 --> 31:36.000]  The appeal was brought to him and it was rejected. That means the indictment is there.
[31:36.000 --> 31:39.000]  That's why they're so panicked. That's why this impeachment's real.
[31:39.000 --> 31:41.000]  Of course it's made up. Of course it's a fraud.
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  But it's the neocon and leftist deep state that knows they've committed so many crimes.
[31:46.000 --> 31:50.000]  They're back as against the wall and they're making their move right now.
[31:50.000 --> 31:53.000]  This is the time to be fully engaged, ladies and gentlemen.
[31:53.000 --> 31:59.000]  We're fighting for not just our nation, but the world's future. America is fighting for its life.
[31:59.000 --> 32:05.000]  Well, the President came out this last Wednesday and said there is an ongoing coup against me.
[32:05.000 --> 32:08.000]  By the deep state, they're not going to stop. They're allied with the Communist Chinese.
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  It's worse than I thought. It's incredible.
[32:10.000 --> 32:14.000]  And I need the American people to understand what's happening and to spread the word and to call Congress
[32:14.000 --> 32:18.000]  and to financially support me into this election. That's all totally true. Please do it.

[32:50.000 --> 32:53.000]  Take action now because history is taking place.
[32:53.000 --> 33:16.000]  Black Friday comes two months early. Mega Sale is about to end.
[33:23.000 --> 33:39.000]  We're back live broadcasting worldwide. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.000]  And President Trump has come out and called for China to investigate Biden's.
[33:43.000 --> 33:50.000]  No, that's not what he did. But it's the control corporate media to take something and completely turn it around into something different.
[33:50.000 --> 33:59.000]  There's a giant threat in the announcement that he's going after them for their sellout of America to the Chai comms.
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  I'm going to be covering that here in just one moment.
[34:02.000 --> 34:08.000]  And this China-file worship of the CFR and the media, you could show all the articles.
[34:08.000 --> 34:16.000]  How many senators it turns out have top Chinese spies running their offices, chiefs of staff, their valets, their drivers, their maids.
[34:16.000 --> 34:21.000]  I mean, they're managing their investment. You put our people in your home.
[34:21.000 --> 34:27.000]  You'll not get the money through our front company. We own you, bitch.
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.000]  That is all actually admitted about Feinstein and all these people.
[34:31.000 --> 34:36.000]  She's gotten billions, her and her husband, billions for the Chai Comm front companies.
[34:36.000 --> 34:41.000]  Billions, billions, billions, billions. But what is this, about 2 billion?
[34:41.000 --> 34:47.000]  That's what Washington Post tries to normalize it. Oh, oh, GZ Pink destroyed Trump for us.
[34:47.000 --> 34:53.000]  Oh, the CFR Davos worshipping him.
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.000]  China's infiltration of U.S. capital markets is a national security concern.
[34:57.000 --> 35:07.000]  Washington Post, you didn't learn any of this till Trump got in because this is a secret Pearl Harbor to the next level.
[35:07.000 --> 35:13.000]  I'm going to get to it in a moment. And you notice I've been harping on this for really 20 plus years.
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  And it was a big attack from the left and a big attack from the right.
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.000]  Jones makes up this China clashes. It's crazy because that's never in our news.
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  But if you read what the trilateral commission was saying, or you read the CFR, you read the Brookings Institute.
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.000]  I mean, it was all America's done. The whole plan. They're going to turn our coal plants off.
[35:31.000 --> 35:37.000]  Then China can build dozens a week. Literally.
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.000]  Their energy is three times cheaper. All of this to destroy us.
[35:41.000 --> 35:45.000]  And of course, I've been totally vindicated. But it's not about me being vindicated.
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.000]  I would have rather had people listen 20 years ago.
[35:50.000 --> 35:57.000]  Let's see. People say, well, China, how'd they do this from, again, 50, 60 years ago, 90% of them didn't have electricity.
[35:57.000 --> 36:03.000]  They didn't have indoor toilets. Still a lot of Chinese homes and places don't even have indoor toilets.
[36:03.000 --> 36:11.000]  Nothing wrong with that. I'm just saying, how do they now have enough ICBMs to blow up every town and city in America over and over again?
[36:11.000 --> 36:17.000]  Because this is the robber barons revenge 120 years ago.
[36:17.000 --> 36:24.000]  They were talking about leveraging China out to take down the U.S. 100 plus years ago.
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  And they finally did it. I'm going to give you that in a moment.
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  But first, listen, we've got the biggest sale we've done since Christmas.
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.000]  It's got to end this weekend because a lot of products are very close to selling out.
[36:36.000 --> 36:42.000]  In fact, some of the items have had to be taken off because every supplement more than 60 were 50% off.
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.000]  Now it's like 55 because five have sold out.
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.000]  DNA forces are already been sold out before this sale. People are shopping at the bit for that.
[36:49.000 --> 36:54.000]  Such a great formula, PQQ, CoQ10, and other key enzymes, amino acids for better upload of it.
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.000]  People get an amazing response. That should be back in a few weeks, folks.
[36:57.000 --> 37:05.000]  But we've got 55 items at 50% off that are in the, quote, supplement genre.
[37:05.000 --> 37:11.000]  I mean, we call the caffeine, the high quality coffee a supplement. No, it's a food.
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  It's an herb. It's from other nature. It's incredible. It works.
[37:15.000 --> 37:20.000]  I mean, it's like me saying, oh, plants don't work. They're a scam. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, sure.
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  Like aspirin and coffee and marijuana. I mean, give me a break, folks.
[37:23.000 --> 37:30.000]  The medicine cabinet is what the drug companies try to copy so they can own it and patent it and control it.
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.000]  But it's the final days of the Black Friday mega sale that came two months early.
[37:35.000 --> 37:38.000]  Store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, 50% off all the supplements,
[37:38.000 --> 37:46.000]  and the huge list of preparedness items from emergency radios to shortwave radios to all the high quality water filtration, air filtration,
[37:46.000 --> 37:52.000]  storeable food. It's all excellent. And things like protein bars.
[37:52.000 --> 37:59.000]  We went out to the top companies and said, what is the very best protein bar that has the most great ingredients and tastes great?
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  And they said, here is the protein bars. I said, I want it even stronger. I want it even better.
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.000]  I want no fillers. And quite frankly, our two types of protein bars are so good, though,
[38:08.000 --> 38:12.000]  but it takes like 20 minutes to eat them instead of two minutes because there's no filler.
[38:12.000 --> 38:17.000]  It's like coffee, but it's really good. But people love them.
[38:17.000 --> 38:22.000]  I'm almost tempted to come out with one that has a little bit of filler because for me, it's like, I guess I was used to fillers,
[38:22.000 --> 38:27.000]  but people like it. It's almost too much. It tastes great, though.
[38:27.000 --> 38:33.000]  Well, there are bars that are $6 or $7 apiece. These are normally $3 apiece. On sale, they're even less.
[38:33.000 --> 38:39.000]  We're barely making, I don't know, 50 cents a bar at this price, but they've been a big seller.
[38:39.000 --> 38:46.000]  They're still 50% off the vanilla and the, of course, there's the vanilla and coconut,
[38:46.000 --> 38:50.000]  and then there's the other one that is the chocolate and the peanut butter.
[38:50.000 --> 38:54.000]  And that's free shipping and double patriot points as well. Can't beat that.
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality B12 you're going to find. It's 50% off with free shipping, double patriot points.
[38:59.000 --> 39:04.000]  Your next order, bodies, amazing, ultra turmeric formula, free shipping, double patriot points, 50% off.
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.000]  The wound gel with free shipping, double patriot points, that is basically at cost.
[39:08.000 --> 39:12.000]  I told them when they did it, I said, that's not supposed to be on there because that's at cost.
[39:12.000 --> 39:17.000]  What have you done? But it's there. 50% off, super mail, vitality with free shipping and double patriot points.
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  That's incredible. 50% off, super blue toothpaste with free shipping and double patriot points.

[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  It's stronger per capita, but not cold pressed with free shipping, double patriot points.
[39:29.000 --> 39:34.000]  Biotrystallinium is amazing. You talk about boosting your hormones, your whole body, everything.
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  Just be careful because this is real selenium. This isn't synthetic. It's from the mustard seed.
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.000]  So just be careful. 50% off with free shipping and double patriot points.
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  50% off, chill force, which is our amazing new product with free shipping, double patriot points.
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  Look into it. 50% off, super silver skin cream with free shipping, double patriot points.
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.000]  That's an amazing deal. That's very close to cost.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  And there's just a bunch of other great items.
[39:56.000 --> 40:03.000]  M4warstore.com, M4warslife.com, or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[40:03.000 --> 40:09.000]  And one other product that's brand new, that is 50% off as well.
[40:09.000 --> 40:15.000]  You've seen all the big national ads for beets.
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  The powder of beets and doctors recommending it.
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.000]  And those are great and you should get them.
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  You see the ads on Fox News.
[40:24.000 --> 40:30.000]  I went to, again, we always do, go to two, three or four of the top manufacturers in the country that do private labeling.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  And we say, you got any beat products?
[40:32.000 --> 40:33.000]  And they go, do we have beat products?
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.000]  And we make like 10 of them. We make six of them. We make five of them.
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.000]  Would you like to private label one? And I said, uh, what's your best?
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.000]  And they go, well, it's this one or is that one? I said, well, what about something even stronger?
[40:45.000 --> 40:46.000]  Like if you're going to make something even better?
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  Because I'm like, what's in this best selling brand that everybody's buying?
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.000]  Well, there's $2 a product, but it still works really great.
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.000]  You sell it for 40 bucks. You got a, you know, 10 times markup.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  I go, no, I'm not going to do that.
[40:57.000 --> 41:04.000]  What if I put $9 in it and mark it up three times to find myself?
[41:04.000 --> 41:10.000]  So we have a super concentrated that doesn't just have all the vitamins and minerals are known in beats.
[41:10.000 --> 41:14.000]  It has all these cofactors and things that really it's hard to measure, but it's known for heart.
[41:14.000 --> 41:18.000]  It's known for the vascular system. It's great for the brain. It's great for the liver.
[41:18.000 --> 41:25.000]  Viso beats complete is concentrated essence of beats that's been cold processed so that you get the
[41:25.000 --> 41:33.000]  transference of whatever that little ring structures, cofactors, whatever it is in a natural cold press that makes it so much stronger.
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.000]  It's 1995 right now, ladies and gentlemen. That's a great deal.
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.000]  Products are out there that are 40, 50 bucks that aren't as good.
[41:42.000 --> 41:49.000]  This goes under the tongue so you get better absorption, put it under the tongue, hold it for a minute or two if you want to get the full effect.
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.000]  I get lazy after like five seconds and just slurp it down and then take, you know, three squirts in the mouth and set it one.
[41:54.000 --> 42:00.000]  It's more economical and works just as good because most of it doesn't get absorbed in your gut is through the blood vessels in the mouth,
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  hold it there for a minute and this will last you months. You'll get a great effect.
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.000]  You're like me. I just go squirt, squirt, squirt because I'm too lazy to do it.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  But again, Viso beats complete in FullWareStore.com. Super high quality.
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  We're very, very proud of it and it funds our operation.
[42:15.000 --> 42:18.000]  So thank you all for your support.
[42:18.000 --> 42:28.000]  I want to be able to expand in 2020. If we don't get massive funding, we'll have to contract or implode after the election.
[42:28.000 --> 42:34.000]  I mean, we can keep going until then, but we're spending all our back up money and I'm just doing everything I can.
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.000]  So I appreciate your support, but these are things you already need. Get your coffee, get your fluoride-free toothpaste,
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.000]  four to five o'clock little silver iodine, get your X2, get it all at FullWareStore.com and support the broadcast
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.000]  and also support our local AM and FM affiliates and TV affiliates, however you can as well.
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  Ties to them. You know, they're telling the truth and having this show on. That's really important.
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.000]  We're doing more of these fake churches. I can tell you right now.
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.000]  We've got my boil down of how epic it is. It's all about video.
[43:27.000 --> 43:32.000]  And I just, you've got to share this with people because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[43:32.000 --> 43:35.000]  This was amazing. And he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  So in full wars, America, Trump, all of us incredible things are happening.
[43:39.000 --> 43:45.000]  And we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at band.video.
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.000]  And I got to tell you, we've done great video work. We've done great films.
[43:49.000 --> 43:54.000]  We've done so much, but websites are not our thing. Well, now they are. I'm so proud of band.video, folks.
[43:54.000 --> 44:19.000]  Check it out. There's a lot of new features band on video.
[44:19.000 --> 44:25.000]  Our information, our truth is devastating to the scumbag Satanist, but we've got to stay on air.
[44:25.000 --> 44:30.000]  I make it easy for you to help us stay on air. We sell products that are high quality directly to you.
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  So we have to worry about the globalists harassing our sponsors.
[44:33.000 --> 44:37.000]  And these are amazing supplements, amazing products, amazing books, films, t-shirts, you name it.
[44:37.000 --> 44:41.000]  All of it is about spreading the word and all of it's about being healthier.
[44:41.000 --> 45:06.000]  The globalist and their Democrat minions are on the verge of taking this cold civil war hot.
[45:06.000 --> 45:13.000]  They have pushed and pushed and pushed and engaged in hoaxes and crimes and censorship and sabotage of the economy
[45:13.000 --> 45:18.000]  and attacks run by the UN on the border that are nothing short of war.
[45:18.000 --> 45:23.000]  And that's because it is a war by multinational corporations, allies with the chai comms and others,
[45:23.000 --> 45:29.000]  with the Hollywood, America hating, God hating filth to try to capture the United States.
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  This is 21st century war.
[45:31.000 --> 45:36.000]  And wars need money to be prosecuted and we're actually winning the war.
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  But the enemy is throwing their full weight at us right now.
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  That's why we need financial support. It's a total 360 win.
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  Double patriot points, 50% off, store-wide free shipping.
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  It's about to end with running out a lot of these products at infowarstore.com.
[45:48.000 --> 45:54.000]  And I need you to get in there, step to the plate, get high quality products you already need and fund the information war.
[45:54.000 --> 46:01.000]  infowarstore.com.
[46:24.000 --> 46:29.000]  I'm going to throw away wealthy successful countries and cultures just so you can say the communist Chinese,
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  the David Rockefeller put in power, are better than everybody.
[46:32.000 --> 46:35.000]  That is a sick freakish joke.
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.000]  And I will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these people.
[46:39.000 --> 46:45.000]  And I beg God for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat.
[46:45.000 --> 46:51.000]  And I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and God is delivering because God is great.
[46:51.000 --> 46:59.000]  God was on Jesus Christ. And now let's move forward against the N.W.O.
[47:02.000 --> 47:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:06.000 --> 47:13.000]  This is going to happen at the start of the next hour.
[47:13.000 --> 47:19.000]  I'm going to show you a communist Chinese book,
[47:19.000 --> 47:26.000]  adopted as the doctrine more than 30 years ago by the communist Chinese.
[47:26.000 --> 47:32.000]  And in the book is shipping heroin,
[47:32.000 --> 47:39.000]  into the United States, and of course now modern fentanyl, 50 times stronger than heroin,
[47:39.000 --> 47:44.000]  100 times stronger than morphine.
[47:44.000 --> 47:50.000]  I always hear different numbers, but it's studying this morning and looked it up.
[47:50.000 --> 47:59.000]  Pure fentanyl might even be stronger than that, but let's just say it'll kill you dead in a hammer, a microgram of it.
[47:59.000 --> 48:05.000]  And you have to understand when you hear about, oh, 300 people got killed in mass shootings.
[48:05.000 --> 48:10.000]  Oh, that's terrible. How about hundreds of thousands dying from the fentanyl?
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.000]  And if you see the old opium dens, people laying on the streets in China on opium,
[48:15.000 --> 48:21.000]  shipped in by the British intelligence, that's what the homeless crisis, most of it's that.
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.000]  But America never shipped opium into China.
[48:25.000 --> 48:31.000]  The globalists that set China up are doing it to us now to conquer us.
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  You see how that works? The globalists run China.
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  Isn't that sick? It's not the Chinese doing to us what we did to them.
[48:39.000 --> 48:44.000]  It's the British intel models, not the British people.
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  It's the British empire system, the Cecil road system. This is all history, by the way.
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  It's not debatable. I'm telling you what's admitted.
[48:51.000 --> 48:59.000]  To do this to us. So here's the big news. President Trump this morning will play a clip.
[48:59.000 --> 49:03.000]  Said, oh, you're brashing me at press conferences about Biden.
[49:03.000 --> 49:12.000]  And was that trying to make Ukraine do my bidding?
[49:12.000 --> 49:17.000]  Or I'd hold back a billion dollars quid pro quo.
[49:17.000 --> 49:25.000]  Because you know who I think I'll ask? I think I'll ask China to investigate the Bidens and what they did on trade deals.
[49:25.000 --> 49:31.000]  Because everybody knows Biden was the bag man for Obama and the Clintonistas and their foundation.
[49:31.000 --> 49:37.000]  And the amount of sellout under Obama was 50 times what happened under Clinton.
[49:37.000 --> 49:46.000]  Because the Clintons were still directing it, they could just get away with more in the 2000s.
[49:46.000 --> 49:50.000]  The office of personnel management hack, just everything.
[49:50.000 --> 49:56.000]  Wall way coming in, spying on everything. The Confucian societies.
[49:56.000 --> 50:01.000]  It's confirmed, took control of every major public university.
[50:01.000 --> 50:05.000]  But their Confucian clubs, UT got hundreds of millions a year from it.
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  They just bought the chairs of most of the major departments.
[50:09.000 --> 50:14.000]  The science departments, the psychology departments, the defense departments.
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  This is evil. But it's not the chai comms running us.
[50:17.000 --> 50:22.000]  It's the globalists put the chai comms in to then use them as the engine to destroy us.
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.000]  And so they can jump back and forth into their safe zone.
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.000]  Everybody always talks about people do corruption here and run to Israel. It's true.
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  Or you can do corruption if you're in the Vatican, run back to the Vatican.
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  That's child's play compared to China.
[50:35.000 --> 50:40.000]  And if Israel's doing bad stuff, get them too. I'm just saying it's a distraction from China.
[50:40.000 --> 50:47.000]  They own only what they own the debt. They're making their move, but with the globalists behind it.
[50:47.000 --> 50:50.000]  And if you read a communist Chinese party stuff, they admit all that.
[50:50.000 --> 50:56.000]  They go, oh, the Chinese comments go, oh.
[50:56.000 --> 50:59.000]  We're very smart. We pull this up.
[50:59.000 --> 51:03.000]  Well, they know how to do things in the communist speeches.
[51:03.000 --> 51:13.000]  And before Gigi Ping got in, the guy before him would give speeches and say, China is the ultimate example of capitalism.
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  Capitalism is communism.
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  People go, that doesn't make sense. Oh, yes, it does.
[51:17.000 --> 51:25.000]  Remember Obama before he left went to Argentina and Chile and gave weird speeches to graduate classes of the politicos.
[51:25.000 --> 51:33.000]  And he said, what we need is communism in the countries, but outside its free market and the two work together.
[51:33.000 --> 51:37.000]  And the students are going, what? He's explaining. No, no, no, no, no.
[51:37.000 --> 51:47.000]  And you'll be the management class. He's telling him, we'll have slaves outside, inside the countries.
[51:47.000 --> 51:52.000]  And then outside of that, you'll have the big multinationals above the law of tax exempt.
[51:52.000 --> 52:05.000]  So Trump is coming out and Trump is saying that just like they did with the Biden thing, they come out, they bring out the Biden thing.
[52:05.000 --> 52:08.000]  Everybody bites on it and then it blows up in their face.
[52:08.000 --> 52:12.000]  Well, now he comes out and says, oh, maybe China needs to look at the Bidens.
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  He's doing it publicly. It's not illegal.
[52:14.000 --> 52:19.000]  He's being sarcastic. He's dropping the hammer and letting him know he knows where the bodies are buried.
[52:19.000 --> 52:24.000]  The billions, the Clinton Foundation, the billions, the Obama's, the billions to the Bidens.
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.000]  Over a billion into different Biden companies.
[52:28.000 --> 52:32.000]  I mean, the Bidens and all these people have giant slush funds.
[52:32.000 --> 52:38.000]  So the media is going with the headline that Trump recruits China.
[52:38.000 --> 52:43.000]  It's like, whoa, he's telling them to give him dirt on Ukraine or whatever.
[52:43.000 --> 52:49.000]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's about China. He's telling China, I know who your agents are.
[52:49.000 --> 52:55.000]  I know who your operatives are and I'll bring out the 80 trillion pound gorilla in the living room.
[52:55.000 --> 53:00.000]  I'll bring it out and I'll have it sit on top of you.
[53:00.000 --> 53:06.000]  If you want to keep playing games with your operatives inside the U.S. because that's what America's fighting.
[53:06.000 --> 53:13.000]  Is the traders within, out of radical Islam, with the leftist globalist, with the Jesuits that have taken over the Catholic Church,
[53:13.000 --> 53:16.000]  and let world government into the family, everything.
[53:16.000 --> 53:23.000]  The Jesuits suing me right now out of Georgetown for exposing Soros' involvement in the riot in Charlottesville.
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  It'll all come out. They'll be defeated.
[53:25.000 --> 53:30.000]  But it's a combine of the Jesuits, the Chai Khoms.
[53:30.000 --> 53:35.000]  Those were the Jesuits who were the first to ever get into China and Japan.
[53:35.000 --> 53:45.000]  The Jesuits, the Chai Khoms, radical Islam, the Hollywood leftists that hate America, the EU, globalist trash.
[53:45.000 --> 53:50.000]  It's just, it's just a collection of evil.
[53:50.000 --> 53:58.000]  I mean, you hear this Pope, he comes out and says stuff that is 180 degrees from what Pope John Paul II said, or the Bible says.
[53:58.000 --> 54:02.000]  It's just pure evil. It's all out in the open. It's everywhere.
[54:02.000 --> 54:11.000]  And so President Trump is laying it all out and saying we're not going to wreck the West, we're not going to bankrupt America,
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  we're not going to have one-sided trade deals.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  Benjamin Jett and Yahoo did the same thing, ally with Trump.
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  Rothschilds are removing him right now.
[54:19.000 --> 54:22.000]  And that's officially the Rothschilds saying they're doing it.
[54:22.000 --> 54:26.000]  They own the economists. They've said for a year, we're going to remove BB. They do it.
[54:26.000 --> 54:32.000]  And then all the Israel haters aren't even sophisticated enough to know there's different factions in Israel.
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  It's just, it's just insane.
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  America is fighting for its life.
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  Israel knows there's a plan to detonate the New World War by destroying Israel.
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.000]  This is all biblical stuff, folks, and we better be on the right side of it.
[54:45.000 --> 54:49.000]  There's corruption in every government. There's problems everywhere.
[54:49.000 --> 54:58.000]  But there's a plan to remove the West and wealth and freedom because you can't have America and the rest of the world free.
[54:58.000 --> 55:05.000]  You can't have the rest of the free world free a few countries like Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., a few areas in Europe, the U.K.,
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  and then everybody else be slaves.
[55:09.000 --> 55:14.000]  And so that's really the question, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.000]  What type of world do we want to live in?
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  Because America's got its problems.
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.000]  But there is a conscious move to bring us down and take us down.
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's go ahead and play the president throwing down the gauntlet.
[55:29.000 --> 55:35.000]  Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, that sort of major investigation into the Biden.
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  It's a very simple answer.
[55:38.000 --> 55:45.000]  They should investigate the Bidens because how does a company that's newly formed and all these companies, if you look at,
[55:45.000 --> 55:51.000]  and by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Biden.
[55:51.000 --> 55:59.000]  Because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.
[55:59.000 --> 56:09.000]  So I would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.
[56:09.000 --> 56:15.000]  Now, that's what a president should do. They're going to claim, oh, that's your political rival. You can't do that.
[56:15.000 --> 56:20.000]  Oh, the Democrats all went and made up that fake dossier on Trump.
[56:20.000 --> 56:29.000]  Now they've made up this new one, and a lot of smart people now believe that Schiff is a Jesse Smollett.
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.000]  And I was saying that yesterday privately, so was Mike Adams, a smart guy.
[56:34.000 --> 56:41.000]  I made some phone calls last night. I didn't see Don Trump Jr. on Fox Business.
[56:41.000 --> 56:49.000]  And I didn't know that he was saying that Adam Schiff, the head of the House Intelligence Committee, is the new Jesse Smollett.
[56:49.000 --> 56:55.000]  But that's what we're all saying. And the word is that that's why they'll never bring forward the whistleblower, who, quote, heard it third hand,
[56:55.000 --> 57:02.000]  is because it's actually people around the president who just lied, but then they don't want to get burned.
[57:02.000 --> 57:10.000]  So now they're just saying it's a third person who was removed from it, three people.
[57:10.000 --> 57:17.000]  Just like Rosenstein said he never said he wore a wire. Now there's transcripts where he did tell people he wore a wire.
[57:17.000 --> 57:21.000]  He says it's a joke. Turns out it's not a joke. And now the phone calls are coming out.
[57:21.000 --> 57:30.000]  And the emails that he told, not just Mueller, but others that the boss doesn't know we're talking, keep this secret.
[57:30.000 --> 57:36.000]  So there's just all sorts of criminal activity by a permanent bureaucracy that sold the country out, that's total trash,
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.000]  that thinks they're invincible and godlike. No.
[57:40.000 --> 58:09.000]  By Johnny Cash comes. By Johnny Cash says sooner or later, God's going to cut you down.
[58:09.000 --> 58:15.000]  Trump got that and all these other populace get it. Why would you throw away wealthy, successful countries and cultures
[58:15.000 --> 58:21.000]  just so you could say the communist Chinese that David Rockefeller put in power are better than everybody?
[58:21.000 --> 58:28.000]  That is a sick freakish joke. And I will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these people.
[58:28.000 --> 58:34.000]  And I beg God for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat.
[58:34.000 --> 58:39.000]  And I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and God is delivering because God is great.
[58:39.000 --> 58:49.000]  Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ. And now let's move forward against the NW.
[58:49.000 --> 58:55.000]  Well, the president came out this last Wednesday and said there is an ongoing coup against me.
[58:55.000 --> 58:58.000]  By the deep state, they're not going to stop. They're allied with the communist Chinese.
[58:58.000 --> 59:04.000]  It's worse than I thought. It's incredible. And I need the American people to understand what's happening and to spread the word
[59:04.000 --> 59:09.000]  and to call Congress and to financially support me into this election. That's all totally true. Please do it.
[59:09.000 --> 59:14.000]  Also, in full force, need your support. I make it easy. We have the very best supplements that make your life so much better

[59:40.000 --> 59:43.000]  Take action now because history is taking place.
[59:43.000 --> 59:55.000]  Black Friday comes two months early. Megasale is about to end.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  Alright, I really, very rarely knew this. In fact, I never air a special report twice in the same show.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  And I've got like 15 incredible special reports here. I've got massive breaking news.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  But I'm going to play this report again that I played at the start of the show because I didn't play all of it.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  I only played two minutes of it. I didn't finish it. And it tees up when I'm going to cover next segment.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  So again, this is beyond critical.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  But we're about to lay out here the admitted battle plan to take down the United States and knowing is half the battle.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  So that's next segment. Then I'm going to get into the amazing second press conference the president gave.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  I'm going to open the phones up. Mike Adams is coming back in to get into his analysis of how they're going to escalate this towards assassination and how we can stop that.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  This is not a drill. This is not a game. This is the real deal. But I want to air this Chinese missiles can now annihilate America.
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  While Congress engulfs itself in fantasy impeachment world, while the squad Hollywood Silicon Valley and the media push racial guilt totalitarianism and division deeper into our culture,
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  while the U.S. border remains open to enemy infiltration and our bureaucracies protecting that border are demonized.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  Close the camps now. Close the camps now.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  U.S. Customs and Border Protection has apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  The Texas Department of Public Safety has reported that border security agencies have arrested several Somali immigrants crossing the southern border who are known members of Al Shabaab,
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  the terrorist group that launched a deadly attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  While Chinese opioids pour into our country and while active duty military suicides reach record highs and the U.S. military focuses on politically correct diversity,
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  the Communist Chinese subtly announced that wiping democracies off the face of the earth is now a reality.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  During their 70th anniversary celebration of Communist rule, President Xi spoke of how Chinese Communist Party Leader Mao Zedong had stood in the same spot 70 years ago
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  and declared the founding of the People's Republic of China paving the way for the country to embark on the path of the great rejuvenation of China.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  Xi said, no power can shake the status of our great motherland. No force can stop the progress of the Chinese people in the nation.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  As a parade displayed the Deng Feng 41, a 7,672 mile per hour intercontinental ballistic missile that is said to have the furthest range of any nuclear missile and could reach the U.S. in 30 minutes.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  Tell us about this missile. Why it's such a national security nightmare for our country?
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  Well, it's the idea that they have, they had 20 of these missiles, a very old fashioned obsolete kind for most of the last few decades.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  Now suddenly they've got 90. They're able to reach any target in America in 30 minutes or less.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  Each one can carry 10 H bombs, a big round sort of nose cone you saw.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  The shape of that nose cone is that the 10 H bombs can fit inside and each one be separately targeted against an American city or a small town or an Air Force base.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  A hypersonic weapons arms race is now in full swing as U.S. company Lockheed Martin is developing a tactical boost glide weapon for DARPA and a hypersonic conventional strike weapon for the Air Force.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  Raytheon and Northrop Grumman are teaming up to build engines for hypersonic weapons.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  Raytheon is also working on defense capabilities against hypersonic weapons while Russia is developing a hypersonic glide vehicle.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  Back here in Cuckoo Land, fools like Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi weaken our defenses and set the U.S. on a course to submission to the communist infiltration of every aspect of our country.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  How do you envision working with this president on these key democratic agenda items, lowering prescription drug costs, you know, ensuring tougher gun safety measures as you're actively considering whether to remove him from office?
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  John Bowne reporting.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  I'm up here with the crew, it's late at night, but I can't leave the office because history is happening right now.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  This is a battle of wills between those that want a free world and those that want tyranny, those who've bet against humanity and those who've bet on humanity.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  So I'm so thankful to you, the listeners, you are the salt of the earth, you're the people that understand what's happening and who've helped launch a worldwide revolution against tyranny.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  So I thank you again, but please understand how important you are and understand that your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support is absolutely more critical than ever.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  Not just for President Trump, but for M-Full Wars, who is President Trump's bullhorn of nationalism and patriotism. Please spread the word about M-FullWars.com.

[1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:10.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  So the media is trying to spin it that Trump-sicking China owned the Bidens, owns the Clintons, owns the Obamas.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  They have bought off our politicians, Diane Feinstein. It's all been in the news. The Washington Post calls for the Chinese dictators, usually pinging to, quote, destroy Trump.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  That's their headline. They're like, ah, you'll never stop our commie dictator. You think you're powerful? Bring forward our titan. He will defeat Godzilla.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  A literal three-headed dragon comes stomping up. One's got the head of Soros, the other of Xi Jinping, and the other of the New World Order. Sick.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  And there it is. Xi's choice, destroy Trump or save him and destroy America.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  Isn't that just cutesy, cutesy, cutesy? You guys do a great job getting those articles pulled up, lightning speed.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  Just wait a few more seconds. Then when the pop-up pops, you can kill the pop-up, and then we don't always have the pop-up.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  Which, the crews do a great job. It's just that's a perennial. So I've decided we're going to direct live on air.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  Because that's what's cool about this broadcast is we're really live. This is really teleprompter-free here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  And can we put the headline back up now? I want to show people. There is the Washington Post. Xi's choice, destroy Trump or save him and weaken America.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  Isn't it good we have a guardian that rounds up two million of his people right now in death camps, and there's video of them being taken to executions.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  Oh, he's a good guy. He'll stop that Trump that puts kids in cages. Oh, that's not true. He'll stop that Trump that wanted a moat around America with alligators in it and crocodiles.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  None of that was true. We'll cover that next segment. Trump responded to that, but let's hit the big issue now.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  Trump has come out and said, hey, China, investigate Biden. He's saying the Democrats, it's not illegal for me to expose your corruption.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  It's not a crime if I do that. You're not above the law, and I'm going to do more of it. I'm going to double and triple and quadruple down.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  Let's have a trial in the Senate. Let's bring it all out because they will then take the bait and be destroyed.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  But still, this is an epic time to be alive. Trump is in a lot of danger, but he's very fatalistic.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  I told you this when he first got elected. Trump is very fatalistic. He's already predicted all of this.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  And I was not told to not say this on air, but I was told this by three people very close to Trump.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  And one of the people was drunk when they told me. And they said it in front of people, and that was the third time I'd heard those exact things.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  And I said, Trump told you that? And they said, you're damn right, he did. And now I know those three people heard this from Trump.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  He never said this to me because I've seen him do it. Trump says he's going to do this no matter what. He doesn't care if they kill him.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  He didn't want to die, but he's just in the groove, in the zone. I mean, I'm in that same zone as well.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  I just can't be as relaxed as Trump is, poorly behind the scenes. He dumps over tables and screams at people and stuff, but when they make mistakes, really.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  And if you look at Trump, he doesn't make a lot of mistakes. They're always saying he's making mistakes.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  Now, he is in focus, ladies and gentlemen, and I really admire him because he is the man in the arena.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  And all of you supporting Trump and supporting him for worse, you are men and women in the arena.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  In fact, you guys are awesome. Will you print me that man in the arena? I can't ever read that enough, but I said I'd get to the big, big news while I'll do it.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  But let's play the clip of Trump right here, letting China know that he'll drop the hammer. And in fact, doing this, he just did drop the hammer.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens. It's a very simple answer.
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  They should investigate the Bidens because how does a company that's newly formed and all these companies, if you look at, and by the way,
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  So I would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  So there you go. Trump, in his inauguration on January 20, 2017, said that the long era of America surrendering to communist China and others is over.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  Now, that was rhetoric then. It was words like saying, I'm going to cut those trees down on top of that hill. I'm going to build a two-story log cabin.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  And I'm going to put a red rooster weather vane up on top of it. And I'm going to smoke cigars and drink coffee and shoot deer off the front porch at 1,000 yards.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  You know, I've sat in a house like that and shot deer at 800 yards. That's what the fence line was, but 1,000 sounds better.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  And you know what? Trump's now built the house, put up the rooster, smoking the cigar, drinking the coffee, and shooting the deer. I mean, he's delivered on what he said he'd do.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  The era surrenders over. Now, are we winning? Yeah, just barely. And that's my biggest frustration is you'd think more people would get on board for this.
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  I mean, it's for their own future, their own prosperity, but it's spiritual that they want to bring America down and they've sided with the evil.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  It's foolish, it's dumb, but they worship at the dark idol of raw power. It's self-destructive.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  It's like people that hurt babies for no reason or guys like to beat their wives up for no reason because they're punks. They don't have real power.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  People that get off on the evil of selling heroin to kids and then seeing their lives ruined and, you know, pimps dominating women and lording over people. It's disgusting.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  And it's good men not standing up for the innocence that allow this. Well, the era of surrender, the era of surrender is over.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  Oh, I feel so good not to surrender as you say. I don't know how this is going to end. Like I told the globalist for 20-something years, but you picked this fight and you're looking for one and you got one now.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  You want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  The era of America's long surrender is over. The end of World War II, we had all the power, all the money, all the inventions.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  We were the light of liberty worldwide and then the big Robert Barron foundations came in.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  There had already been program people leftist ideology where they tell all the college graduates selling America out, breaking the family up, doing all this is to help the rest of the world.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  So we don't become dominant fascists like the Germans. And so we're too good.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  And so it's the Christian thing to do to basically cut your legs off. And let me tell you that it's taught at major Christian universities that I don't even want to undermine, but I had family that went to them like Baylor.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  Both my grandmothers went there. And it is just all about having a guilt trip about yourself.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  That's where all the political correctness comes from is a sick twisted form of Christianity where you don't believe in your providence, you don't believe in your birthright, you don't believe in your power over Satan through Christ.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  But where you just run around as a goody two shoe but are directed by the government and it's a Christian or a leftist. And my grandmothers weren't leftist, they weren't bad.
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  I have just experienced the superiority guilt that these people had. And they were smart.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  And they were accomplished, but they had a guilt and there was a guilt that all the men have got to be controlled a little bit and not because they might start another war and that was taught to the women, you see.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  Oh, that's the same thing the Romans would do. They would take over a village that kill the leadership men and they'd say we're going to keep your boys alive, but you better make them domesticated or we'll kill them too.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  And the women, whether it was black slaves in the Caribbean or whether it was white Europeans as slaves for the Romans, that's the management system.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  And that's where the feminism comes from and all of it is we're going to take control of the men, we're going to make them weak for their own good.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  But it's a bunch of men programming that to bring down your culture in society because they can't beat you, but if they can get mommy.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  Hitler said first you get the women, then you've got the children and so follow the men. Of course Hitler told the women tell your sons to go out and kill, tell your sons to die, tell them never stop, tell them they're invincible.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  Like the Spartan women told their children, come home with your shields or on them. Come back dead or alive, but come back.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  Don't come back without your weapons. Don't drop your weapons and run or we'll never talk to you again. Come home with your shields or on them.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  Where my mom told me that when I was a kid.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong, trying to fact check the president?
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  The deceptive, humpty-dumpty troll known as Brian Stelter and his little weasel minion, Oliver Darcy, have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air into censor us.
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:16.000]  And of course he famously said along with many others that Trump is the info wars president.
[1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the info wars president.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  And you know what is true? Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew and my drive and your drive has brought Trump to the White House and other nationalists to power around the world.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  And now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  So this is a day of great victory and I salute you all, but now in the thick of the fight. So infowarstore.com for products you need.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  Massive sales now so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end, until we've defeated them.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  The gauntlet has been thrown down. Every major Democrat candidate has come out and said they want to confiscate all Cineado firearms.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  And now Buddha judge has come out and said that it's about political power. That's why they want the guns.
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  Well, finally they're being honest because all their lies haven't got them to the point they want.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  So now they're just trying to normalize all this tyranny. It shows what incredible followers these people are.
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  The globalists know they're not going to get this without a civil war and they know that the minions trying to carry this out are not going to be in a good position in that civil war.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  But it's up to us to understand the big picture, to carry the fight to the enemy in the information war before they can kick off a hot civil war.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  That's our mission. If you choose to accept it, so please spread the word about inforwars.com.
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  My friends, I've seen a lot of Donald Trump just like you have.
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  And my goodness, yesterday's press conference, when they came in on him with all their garbage, the foreign reporters, the U.S. reporters, these little political sell-outs, these whores, he just tore them to bits.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  And it's one thing to hear out of your radio listeners. It's powerful. But if you see it, it's all at band.video.
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  We've got the full press conference. We've got my boil down of how epic it is. It's all at band.video.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  And I just, you've got to share this with people, because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  This was amazing. And he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it. So inforwars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  And we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at band.video.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  And I got to tell you, we've done great video work. We've done great films. We've done so much. But websites are not our thing.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  Well, now they are. I'm so proud of band.video, folks. Check it out. There's a lot of new features band.video.
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:40.000]  Silent weapons for a quiet wars. Stealth war. Unconventional warfare.
[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  When we cover this news, the Pentagon would have you believe that China is the first country or nation to deploy things like this. Stealth war is as old as humanity.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  You knew somebody died of the plague. You would chop them up in pieces and throw them down the well so that it wouldn't be obvious right away that somebody with plague had been thrown into it.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  And then the people drinking the water would die.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  Poisoning is stealth war. Surrounding somebody's castle and starving them out is the oldest form as well. Siege, they both go together.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  And so there's a technocracy above the United States and China that is all about stealth war. The vaccines, the fluoride, the glyphosate, all approved, all agreed on by the UN.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  Just like the planetary spring, they have world treaties on that. Look them up. Look up. Treaty from 79, the treaty from 94 for geoengineering, which is not really geoengineering.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  They're poisoning you and the crops. But don't worry, Monsanto's got a seed that will grow in the lead and in the aluminum.
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  Yeah, they're more sophisticated than they were in the 60s when they would, you know, fly over Guatemala and release a million grasshoppers to eat the crops.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  There's a million would then replicate and lay eggs and you'd have 100 million and they'd replicate and you'd have a billion, two billion grasshoppers and just a quick six months or so.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  Central America, they can basically breed year round. A little side declassified issue. What I'm getting at is, oh, now they just spray everything with aluminum dioxide, barium salt.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  And it's all public now.
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  Obama went ahead and just doubled the spending on it. Department of Energy and they had Brennan come out and admit it all, but I'm sorry, I'm digressing.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  See, you start getting off into silent weapons for quiet wars and stealth war and all that. But the Chinese government has public policy going back.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  What is it? 29 years, 30 years where they said we will ship heroin into the United States. There are strategic enemy because they've been green lit by the same globalist that ran the British Empire.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  That for 200 years had taken over China and broken it in 14, 15 different parts, depending on the time.
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  You had the US sector, the British sector, the French sector, the Austrian, Hungarian sector, the Russian sector, the Finnish sector, the Dutch sector.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  But the British Empire ran the sectors. They ran all the ports.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  But they let different armies come in and run it all. The Chinese for hundreds of years, because they made opium illegal.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  What was it? 300 years ago, they had an edict from the emperor that anyone caught with opium would be executed because it was being shipped in from India and Pakistan.
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  That was India then as well and Kashmir. And the people didn't want to work anymore.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  They had enough money to get a little bit of opium and they would go lay on the side of the street and smoke it and then work enough until they ended up dying.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  We have opium dens now. They're all over the highways, all over the roads and any left of the city.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  And then the Chycom Triads ship it in about 90% of the opioids now. And then the left fences, it makes the money and then that's why they've got to have open air places.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  The mayors passed the exact same laws saying it because they're getting their pockets lined.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  These mayors all get cold hard cash. Now let's continue here.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  And see that they repeat history because it works so well. So the evil groups that ran the British did this to the Chinese.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  Now those same globalist groups put Mao Zedong on. He followed the one child policy, followed all their secret testing, all the evil stuff they wanted.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  So they're globalist partners and now they were maneuvered with Obama for our total destruction.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  But Trump got in last minute to stop that. At least partially, but you see all their operatives angry.
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  So deadly fentanyl brought home from China being shipped through the mail, CBS News.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  And the government creates these huge factories and they have the factory workers go home to their addresses and then mail it through different systems to the United States or to Mexico or to Canada and then it's mailed in here.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  And there's so much money they're buying off the postal services and the inspectors in many areas.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  And it's estimated thousands of tons are shipped in the U.S. alone.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  Now again, 25 tons is enough to kill 10,606,000,000 people up your fentanyl.
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  People are going to ask, well, how do you do that? It's enough to kill billions. How do you do it?
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Well, they're not taking it all at once, but it's still causing massive death right now in society. Instead of just shooting somebody and they die, they wound you with this and then it's a massive cost on society.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  But don't just believe me. Here, Dr. McCamshaw, please.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  Deadly fentanyl brought online from China being shipped through the mail.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  Fentanyl as a dark web profit center for Chinese labs to U.S. streets, NPR.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  China's using fentanyl chemical warfare against U.S. experts say zero edge.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  U.S. drug bust uncovers enough fentanyl to kill 14 million people.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  That was only 65 pounds to the translation over to the amount they caught in Mexico.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  10.6 billion plus. Fentanyl just goes on and on.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  How to win the U.S. trade war with Communist China's broader stealth war on America and Robert Spalding.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  And they interview the former head of the Pentagon's office on China Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  It's an excellent interview. It's an hour long. You should go watch it.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  Now, let's get to this.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  You can read it for free online. I've ordered the book itself.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  It's a reprint in the U.S. out of China.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  China doesn't deny this. This is their book by Colonel Kwai Wang and Colonel Wang Zinyu.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  I'm pronounced that probably wrong.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  Translated from the original People's Liberation Army documents.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  Unrestricted warfare. Now, I suggest you read this.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  It's only 100 pages or so. I got up again at 4.30 this morning.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  And went online and found most of the book published and read it.
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  I've ordered the book. I suggest you go read it.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  Right in here, they say, and this is from 30 years ago,
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  we're going to ship massive amounts of heroin into the U.S. to weaken them and break down their society.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  Now, that's a fact.
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  So, when your wife or your husband dies of fentanyl, I mean,
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  I know four people well and a lot of other folks a little bit who died from fentanyl.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  I was on airplane back from doing podcasts a few weeks ago.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  TI's podcast and others out in Los Angeles.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  I started talking about fentanyl to my security guy sitting next to me and a bunch of people around me go,
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  oh, hey, my mom just died of that. Hey, my girlfriend wasn't even on fentanyl,
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  but they laced at the Chinese mafia here in LA and the police were scared of them and she died.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  They laced her marijuana vape.
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  I don't know. I know all about it, sir, for talking to the guy.
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  So, then I get off the airplane, somebody else walks up to me and says,
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  oh, my daughter just died of fentanyl.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  I mean, I'm on an airplane and maybe only 10 people can hear me and three of them got dead, dead people.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  This is a holocaust, but you're not going to hear about a couple hundred killed in mass shootings
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  while millions are being put on the line, hundreds of thousands dying a year and it's getting worse.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  We have opium dens, open air everywhere, and it's all the Chinese government with the filthy Democrat deep state.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  These people are enemy combatant, murderer criminals.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  They're fluoridating you. They're murdering you. They hate you.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  China does not put fluoride in their water. Only enemies are hit with chemicals.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:09.000]  Didn't I say a thousand times that there's no way you're going to have an authoritarian corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes,
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  that has diplomatic immunity, that runs around saying it's communist and socialist, power to the people, but then meanwhile is tax exempt again offshore.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  Well, Trump got that and all these other populace get it.
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:30.000]  Why would you throw away wealthy, successful countries and cultures just so you can say the communist Chinese that David Rockefeller put in power are better than everybody?
[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  That is a sick freakish joke and I will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these people and I beg God for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat.
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  And I've been saying that prayer for 20-plus years and God is delivering because God is great. Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  And now let's move forward against the NW.
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:31:06.000]  You know, I'm angry because I'm not just going to sit here and take this scientific dictatorship that admits it's putting cancer viruses in the vaccines,
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  it's putting fluorine in the water to brain damages and that it's trying to literally destroy our families and organize us into a bunch of dumbed down slaves so they can then carry out or orderly extermination.
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:26.000]  I'm not putting up with it and our information, our truth is devastating to these scumbag satans, but we've got to stay on air and I make it easy for you to help us stay on air.
[1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  We sell products that are high quality directly to you, so we have to worry about the globalist harassing our sponsors.
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  And these are amazing supplements, amazing products, amazing books, films, t-shirts, you name it.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  All of it is about spreading the word and all of it is about being healthier.
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  You have all the power in the world, but you must use it. You must take action.
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  As of taping this, it's Wednesday afternoon. We're running the biggest sale we've had since last Christmas.
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  It's store-wide free shipping, 50% off the high quality supplements from FoursLife and all the preparedness items like water filtration, air filtration,
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  storeable foods, shortwave radios and so much more. This is a huge special.
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  We just sell a lot of product to fund ourselves and these sales are a great way for you to get great prices but also support the import.
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  Please take action today. I've got to end this sale by Sunday or Monday at the max because a bunch of the items are about to sell out.
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  Again, too many deals to fit them all in here. Just please go to infowarstore.com and realize you're in this critical time with the globalist trying to take us off the air.
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  Your support is absolutely essential, so thank you.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  From enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  Why would Communist China ship in thousands of tons of fentanyl a year and be allowed to do it under Obama, under Bush and under the Clintons?
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  Because George Herbert Walker Bush, former director of the CIA, Rockefeller anti-American globalist, son of the chief Nazi in North America, Prescott Bush, Democrat globalist,
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  was the first US ambassador to China and set up this whole agreement with Mao Zedong.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  And now you see the unrestricted warfare. You think George Herbert Walker just shipped in thousands of tons of cocaine to black neighborhoods?
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  They shipped it into everybody's neighborhood.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  But when they got caught, they went, oh, we're just doing it to the black people as if that matters.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  But it must have mattered to some of the old establishment in the Senate, the Democrats, most of them former clansmen. Seriously.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  Like when Tuskegee came out in 1979, let's see if my memory serves. I think it was being done since the 30s and it came out in 1979, Tuskegee.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  Where firstly it said 1,000 and 10,000 plus black people injected with live syphilis who then spread it to hundreds of thousands.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  Yeah, 1932 to 1972, my memory served, but it came out. It broke. I want to say in 78 or 79, I've done research on the point is just maybe I might show you here.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  I have them search what I say. I want you to know I'm not making this stuff up. OK, I make mistakes here and there from my memory. It's not perfect.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  But, you know, going home and giving us their wives, you go in, you think you're getting a vaccine or something because, you know, the doctor is going to help you.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  That's not what happens.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  They were doing it to white people all over the United States. Poor white people in the Bronx, poor white people in West Virginia and the Appalachians in Arkansas.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  They were doing it to poor white people in Northern California. They're doing it to poor white people in Illinois and Iowa and Michigan and Texas.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  It's all in there. But see when they got caught, when the scientists came out and said, we're not doing this, they went, OK, say it's just the blacks because if people find out it's everybody, they'll go crazy.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  But if it's, oh, just those black people. So here's the moral story to any racist out there, idiots out there.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  And I get tribalism and I know other groups are racist. I know everybody has come after white people. I get races real when a mob of people, another color, you are coming to hurt you. I get it.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  I know black folks have been ganged up on. I know white folks have. I know how gangs work. OK, I understand that.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  I'm not denying that we're tribal creatures. I'm saying it's manipulated against us.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  And it's manipulated to use our Christian ethos to not be tribal so none of us have any tribal defenses so the globalist can set up their own tribe and overtake us.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  So I'm saying tribalism is a survival instinct and is a good thing if you're conscious of it and use it wisely.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  Tribalism is to your family. You're number one tribalism to your children, isn't it?
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  I mean, I'll be honest with you. I love my wife a lot. And boy, I tell you, she's not street legal. If she was a car, she'd be a Ferrari.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  But I would cut her loose just like that for my kids. And she's the same to me. There's just no doubt that my children, the daughter I have with her, that I am default programmed, that my life, her life, that those kids go first.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  So that's a survival instinct. The fact they can get people to kill their kids and turn against that is what you call a great delusion.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  But I'm digressing. A lot of experts warn that the most deadly chemical weapon you could have now isn't even VX nerve gas.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  It's fentanyl, 50 times stronger than heroin, 100 times stronger than opium, one microgram, one little grain, up your nose, you're dead.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  You'll never know what hit you. That's why it got declassified in 2000 by the Federation of American Scientists and Marine Corps, asked for it to be reclassified.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  Under the Texas Sunshine Project, they discovered a Marine Corps plan under Bill Clinton.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  They even have the helicopters in underground bases for only 100 feet under, so it pops open.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  And a helicopter with weapons grade heroin takes off and they spray whole cities during riots.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  They found, though, that around 10% of people end up dying from falling and hitting their head or wrecking their cars.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  And then there's huge fires that come in some of the studies that were done.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  I'm just going to give you an example of this. It's not just the Chinese doing this, but they have found that weaponized heroin is the best way to kill people or knock them out.
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  So if a drone was sent over here with one pound of fentanyl, and let's say you detonated it over the Washington Monument on July 4th over a crowd of, say, 10,000 people,
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  you could clearly probably kill most of those people.
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  Now, if the Chinese did that, we'd go to war with them, because it's a big open thing, a drone flies in, they did it, it's got their flag on it, they do it.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  But if they just ship it in by the thousands of tons, and it slowly kills us, it's cutesy.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  And then we all get to make money off of it. The police make money off of it. The jails get full.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  The drug rehab people make money, but the society's collapsing.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  And the cops don't want it. You don't want it. Nobody wants it. It's just kind of the system we're given.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  So see, we have to learn to get mad about this, but oh, let me explain something.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  You don't just think it's the Chai comms green lit to ship thousands of tons a year of fentanyl into the United States.
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  They do that because any big facilities here in the U.S., most of the police aren't corrupt, and most of the people aren't.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  They would blow the whistle. You wouldn't get away with doing it here.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  People turn a blind eye to liquor being made illegally or marijuana, because people think, hey, it's like in the Godfather.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  Hey, you know, the church denies them, they're hookers, and they're gambling, and they're liquor.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  So I've been involved in that, the Godfather says.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  But this drug business, I tell you, it's going to bring down society, and it's true.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  So people turn a blind eye in America to hookers and liquor and gambling.
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  They're not going to turn a blind eye to fentanyl.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  So they just produce it in China and then ship it in.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  And then you got the big drug companies whose business plan is to get you a dick and selling stuff not as strong but close.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  I mean, what? Oxycontin's 10 times stronger than heroin? Fentanyl's 50?
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  I mean, Rush Limbaugh went deaf on Oxycontin. He eats your nerves.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  Not judging Rush Limbaugh, by the way. I mean, he had a hurt back. He got addicted. It happens to people.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  It's very dangerous. We've all had monkeys on our backs.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  Mine has been alcohol. I don't drink a drop.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  Joke around about it. Don't drink a drop.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  Some people can drink. It's good for you, not for me, because it just turns into a problem.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  All I'm telling you is, one drop of alcohol doesn't kill you. Fentanyl does. One grain of it.
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  And Trump's trying to fight it. So how do you oppose somebody like that?
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  Well, because you're making money off of it.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  And so everybody just sits back just that issue alone.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  But see, the very people that let China do that, they use China as the base to produce it safely and get it here.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  They're the same ones pushing the vaccines that hurt you and don't protect you by design, that are tainted by design.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  With all these allergen-causing systems and all these cancer viruses, and they admit in medical journals that,
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  at current rates, almost everyone will be so allergic that almost no food will be edible soon.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  See, the globalists can't take all the food away from us. We're too productive. They want to starve us, they admit.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  So they just make it where you can't eat any food. See how that works?
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  So you're being hit with the glyphosates. You're being hit with the vaccines, the fluoride, the lawyer IQ, and lawyer fertility on record.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  They admit it. Again, this is Ian Books, written by Obama ScienceR.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  Oh, talk about a jerk. But again, he says we're doing this to sterilize you and make you dumb, more manageable.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  And then the guy that wrote Obamacare says, thank God you're so stupid.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  See how they rub it in? I don't like it being rubbed in, and I don't want to take advantage of you and use you.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  See, there are a lot of smart people like me that know all this. They've just decided to join Satan.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  Well, guess what? They ain't that smart. I'm not doing it. Folks, we can beat these people, but we got to admit how bad it is.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  The gauntlet has been thrown down. Every major Democrat candidate has come out and said they want to confiscate all semi-auto firearms.
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  And now Buddha Judge has come out and said that it's about political power. That's why they want the guns.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  Well, finally they're being honest because all their lies haven't got them to the point they want.
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  So now they're just trying to normalize all this tyranny. It shows what incredible followers these people are.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  The globalists know they're not going to get this without a civil war.
[1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  And they know that the minions trying to carry this out are not going to be in a good position in that civil war.
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  But it's up to us that understand the big picture to carry the fight to the enemy in the information war before they can kick off a hot civil war.

[1:43:45.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  Well, the president came out this last Wednesday and said there is an ongoing coup against me by the deep state.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  They're not going to stop. They're allied with the Communist Chinese. It's worse than I thought. It's incredible.
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  And I need the American people to understand what's happening and to spread the word and to call Congress and to financially support me into this election.
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  That's all totally true. Please do it. Also, inforwars need your support. I make it easy.

[1:44:50.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  Black Friday comes two months early, mega sale is about to end.
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  We've got the full press conference. We've got my boil down of how epic it is.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  It's all about not video and I just, you've got to share this with people because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  This was amazing and he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  So Infowars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening and we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at band.video.
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  And I got to tell you, we've done great video work, we've done great films, we've done so much, but websites are not our thing.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  Well, now they are. I'm so proud of band.video folks. Check it out. There's a lot of new features band.video.
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  We have been maneuvered towards collapse and bankruptcy, but at the 11th hour, 58th minute, the American people put a populist in power and it's happening all over the world.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  So great things are happening, but the enemy is striking back. They're very serious with this impeachment plan.
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  It has bipartisan support and I'm telling you, President Trump needs our prayers and Infowars needs your prayers and support.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:48.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are trying to shut us down, but right now it's easier than ever to financially support us while getting great products at the same time.
[1:46:48.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  With Black Friday comes two months early with store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points and ladies and gentlemen, 50% off.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. That is a 12-year-old liner.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  We loaded this song on the computer 12 years ago and we're getting that liner cut.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide in defense of liberty. The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  And look how far we've come, but we have summoned the enemy. Newtonian physics for every action is an opposite and equal reaction.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  I've learned that that's true. That's not just gravity. That's not just kinetic force. That's a spiritual law.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  And not following the laws God's laid down is sin and God gives us free will and just says, hey, that won't go too well for you, but I need other conscious beings.
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:28.000]  It's kind of lonely, but I love you and I really don't want to see you stick your hand in that garbage disposal.
[1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  There's a little devil going, it's great in here. Don't let him lie to you. It's so much fun. Stick your hand in.
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  That's really what it comes down to.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  I said I'd get to the parade. It's epic footage. And I've got all this other news in the second press conference.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  He gave your stay on all the big developments and just stacks of incredible draconian censorship taking place, not just on the Internet, but in the real world.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  And I want to take your calls, but I want to play this compilation. This is only a small smattering of the Democrats in the last few years in this week calling for Trump's imprisonment.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  His death after they get their impeachment through. The Democrats call for impeachment, imprisonment, and the death of Donald Trump.
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  It makes the risk of going to trial and he's convicted that could be seen as an impeachable offense.
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  I don't see how that wouldn't be an impeachable offense.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  That tweet fits the Republican definition of an impeachable offense.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  Where do you see an impeachable offense?
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  It is grounds for impeachment.
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America. America will triumph over you. That apparently directed toward the president of the United States.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  Is it impeachable? 100% is impeachable.
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  Very substantial evidence that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanor.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  You take on the intelligence community. They have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  As former government official, government's going to kill this guy.
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  We're not here for articles of impeachment.
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  Absolutely. Already.
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  The president himself admitted that he had a telephone conversation with the president of Ukraine.
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  He also said he did talk to him about Biden.
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  He is with so many people knowing about this. It's interesting and I'm kind of proud to say this.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  It took a member of the intelligence community to step up and bring it forward.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  Imagine a set of circumstances that would have alarmed the founders more than what's on that call.
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  Where you have a president using the full power of his office to try to effectively coerce a foreign leader that is completely dependent on our country for military, economic, diplomatic...
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  Pause and back this up to the other guy before shift. These people are all so weak, so sycophantic, so not even shallow.
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  They're devoid of any substance and they all just try to have these gleams in their eye that all they look like is like a crustacean, a crab or something.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  And then they talk about the intelligence community, the secret guardians of the nation.
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  When they're all a bunch of America-hating trash, trained and put into power because they were soulless, heartless, cowardly pieces of filth.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  And I don't say that with hate towards these people.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  I say it because they are a disease and they know they don't have a soul.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  They know they don't have providence. I mean, you look at any of these guys, their families are trash, okay?
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  I mean, they come from trash, they are trash.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  And you have to understand, because they come from trash, they want to hurt you because you're not trash.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  And you could be old, you could be young, you could be black, you could be white, you could be rich, you could be poor.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  If you care about God and you're a good person, you aren't trash. These people are trash.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  Let's go back to these trash.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  He is with so many people knowing about this, it's interesting and I'm kind of proud to say this.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  It took a member of the...
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  Back in a moment.
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  I'm kind of proud to say this, so disingenuous, the opposite of authentic.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  I'm kind of proud to say this, because, you know, third world countries always get overthrown by their intelligence agencies
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  and generals that put like 18 stars on their hats.
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  I mean, you're a joke. You're a joke.
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  An absolute joke.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  I mean, put that former CIA deputy director up.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  I mean, you know that guy gets hung up by his toes and beaten with bullwebs and stuff.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  I mean, that's what that guy's into.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  And he's just a degenerate.
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  I mean, you wouldn't let your kids get near him for a trillion dollars.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  I mean, look at ship's eyes.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  If that isn't a pedophile's eyes, I don't know what are.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  I'm out to tell you.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile, but him and Brian Skelter, if I was a movie director,
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  making a movie about pedophiles, they'd grab kids out of the back of, you know, backyards
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  and take them to torture them to death.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  If I was going to put a guy in red pajamas as the devil torturing kids in a Satan movie,
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  I mean, that's who'd be wearing the red pajamas, baby.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  Let's go back to this filthy enemy of God.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  Go back to him.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  He is with so many people knowing about this.
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  It's interesting, and I'm kind of proud to say this.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  It took a member of the intelligence community to step up and bring it forward.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  It's hard to imagine a set of circumstances that would have alarmed the Founders' war
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  than what's on that call, where you have a person using the full power of his office
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  to try to effectively coerce a foreign leader
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  that is completely dependent on our country for military, economic, diplomatic, and other support
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  to intervene in our election to help his campaign.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election.
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  It couldn't be clearer, and that's not just undermining democratic institutions.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  That is treason. It's treason, pure and simple.
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  And the penalty for treason under the U.S. Code is death.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  That's the only penalty.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  There's the former governor of Massachusetts.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  Oh, you think Governor Weld's going to kill anybody himself? No, no, no.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  Hey, Weld, you're not worth killing, son.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  So why don't you shut your mouth about killing people, okay?
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  Just shut your mouth, you trash, you chai-com piece of filth.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  Sorry, go back to him.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  Pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S. election,
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  it couldn't be clearer, and that's not just undermining democratic institutions.
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  That is treason. It's treason, pure and simple.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  Back it up again. Penalty for death.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  They're running around how they're going to kill everybody, how they're going to kill the president,
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  and the president goes, hey, you're starting a civil war.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  Oh, you're mean. I mean, it's insane how they wage war on reality.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  And they want to start one, a race war.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  How about everybody not be stupid and not buy into that?
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  Well, guess what? We haven't been buying into it, and that's why they're freaking out.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  And I'm telling you, they're winding up mass shooters of black churches to get it going.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  And they don't want me on air to question these things when they stage them.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  That's why they're so pissed, because they know you don't buy any of it, either do you.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  Even if some of these shootings are real and some of them are, a lot of them are wound up nuts.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  They know and protect, and they're on Prozac and all those drugs, or they're Antifa,
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  and admit they're doing it dozens of times and no one stops them. That's all confirmed.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  But sometimes they stage this stuff out right, and everybody knows that.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  And they're so pissed, because you're not going to take the blame for what a psycho does.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  And they can't guilt you anymore.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  These fentanyl-pushing, abortion-pushing death lovers.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  And oh, by the way, the videos are pouring in of people confronting Biden and Pocahontas and the Clintons.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  So many videos, I can't even get to it.
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  Dujus showed me one earlier. He's got an old 12 minute.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  It was 11. He had another minute.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  A 12 minute clip will try to air on the war room, or...
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  They're in firepower tonight with Will Johnson and Papert.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  With all these new people going out and confronting, and they're going to Congress.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  People are going to Congress, and they're confronting them in the halls.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  It's beautiful. It's happening.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  I didn't plug this out. I'm going to plug this briefly.
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  The big supercells got it in this weekend.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  It may still have a sell after that, but a lot of the stuff's selling out.
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  Already five items have sold out.
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  It's store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points, 50% off all the great supplements.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  And that means the protein bars, and that means the coffee.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  I mean, just everything's massively discounted.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  And I get so busy, I just said 50% off double-patriot points, store-wide free shipping.
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  And they included the protein bars and the skin cream and the wound gel.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  That's at cost. I know what it cost us.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  So, I mean, the 25% off the skin cream we were making, like, $2 on the little tube
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  and $5 on the big tube.
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  I don't think we're actually making money on that.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  So buy something else while you're there, please.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  We got the best water filters, best air filters. They're all 50% off.
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  It's a giant cell, so we got to sell a lot to fund ourselves.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  And I put myself with this discount trap, so please take advantage of it, folks.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  Whatever you spread the word, please pray for us, because that's our shield.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  And I don't think it'd be a goody-tooth shield, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  I just know I hate to delve a little bit right back. Stay with us.
[1:57:45.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  The globalists and their Democrat minions are on the verge of taking this cold civil war hot.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  They have pushed and pushed and pushed and engaged in hoaxes and crimes and censorship
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:02.000]  and sabotage of the economy and attacks run by the UN on the border
[1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  that are nothing short of war.
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:08.000]  And that's because it is a war by multinational corporations,
[1:58:08.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  allies with the Chai comms and others,
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  with the Hollywood, America-hating, God-hating filth
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  to try to capture the United States.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:18.000]  This is 21st century war.
[1:58:18.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  And wars need money to be prosecuted,
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  and we're actually winning the war,
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  but the enemy's throwing their full weight at us right now.
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  That's why we need financial support. It's a total 360 win.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  Double Patriot points, 50% off.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  Storewide free shipping. It's about to end
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  with a running out of a lot of these products at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  And I need you to get in there, step to the plate,
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  get high quality products you already need,
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  and fund the Information War.
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  infowarstore.com.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:46.000]  No, no, no!
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:49.000]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:58:49.000 --> 1:58:53.000]  Alex, God bless you. I have an idea for a new info wars t-shirt instead of
[1:58:53.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs,
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:01.000]  Showing your brain, getting frat.
[1:59:01.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  Tool that changed my life. I use turbo force, bodies,
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  Albu power, brain force, fish oil, ultra 12, daily,
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  X2 every several days.
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  Now, what I've found is really combining them is
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  totally synergistic and transcendent feeling
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  that I get by combining all your products,
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  and I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them,
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  I just want to say why not.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible,
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:27.000]  whether it's turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil,
[1:59:27.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BiopeakyQ and all the rest of it.
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation,
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  now you can build the big strong temple.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:41.000]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them,
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  it makes my life so much better, and then it funds the information war,
[1:59:44.000 --> 2:00:11.000]  which is so critical. Thank you so much. God bless you.
[2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a purge at Fox News and on Fox Radio,
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:19.000]  and there's been a purge in Talk Radio and a purge on XM going on.
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  We're about five, six years, and they're just taking the shows off,
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  big sponsorship comes in, demands conservatives be taken off the air.
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  I've seen that done across the nation.
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  And now, Fox News contributor has been taken off the air
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  when he had a guest on saying that the Democrats' religion is mollic worship
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  in ancient Babylon and other areas.
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  It was seen as a bull, also can be seen as an owl.
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  They do a mockument sacrifice at Bohemian Grove, so too mollic.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  And he was fired for having a guest on telling it like it is.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  This is a spiritual battle. The children are there to sacrament,
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  and they're trying to take Tucker Carlson and others off the air right now as well.
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:11.000]  It's clear to me that the average American citizen loves his president,
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  and they're not buying into all of this impeachment nonsense.
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  They're not. And look, I heard it over and over again.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  Like you, I spoke to thousands of these people last week,
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  and the reason they support this president is not because they're religious hypocrites.
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  It's not because they think he is perfect.
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  They know he's not perfect, just like none of us is perfect.
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  But they appreciate the strong Christian stance he takes.
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:41.000]  He is without doubt the most pro-life, pro-religious liberty, pro-Israel,
[2:01:41.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  pro-conservative judiciary president we have ever had.
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  And they don't want to see this warrior, in a sense,
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  removed from his place of leadership in our country.
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  There is a fear that if the left ever regains control of this country again,
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  our nation is finished.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  Look, I believe that.
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:05.000]  I genuinely, based on some of the legislation,
[2:02:05.000 --> 2:02:09.000]  they've been trying to shove down the throats of the good people of California.
[2:02:09.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  And then with this Equality Act that Nancy Pelosi and her cronies are after,
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:19.000]  I have no doubt that they want to especially go after and target Christians in America, Dr. Jepers.
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  Oh, I believe that. I believe that the left ever gets in control again.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  It's not going to be incremental change, we see.
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  They have said they're going to undo everything this president has done
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  and think about what he has done in the pro-life area,
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  the sweeping religious liberty executive order he signed.
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  They are going to undo that and they are going to come after conservatives with a vengeance.
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  I wonder if that's why we are seeing these unrelenting attacks on President Trump,
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  more so than any other Republican in at least modern history.
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  Yes, I think it is. And look, I said this on Fox and Fringe yesterday
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:59.000]  and the president retweeted my comments last night.
[2:02:59.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  Look, the Democrats knew they couldn't beat him at the ballot box in 2016.
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  They are becoming increasingly aware of the fact that they can't beat him in 2020 either.
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  Impeachment is the only option they have to remove Donald J. Trump from office.
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  And look, I heard this sanctimonious Nancy Pelosi this weekend calling for prayer for our country
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  and praying for prayer.
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  Look, that reminds me of an arsonist, a pyro maniac with a match in his hand
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  about to set a building on fire saying,
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:37.000]  now pray with me that the destruction I'm about to cause isn't too severe.
[2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  I mean, if he's sincere, he'll put down the dang match.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  And if Nancy Pelosi is sincere about bringing this nation together,
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  she will drop this impeachment effort,
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  let the American people decide one year from now at the ballot box.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:57.000]  But she is uncomfortable. She's scared to death at what the American people will choose to do,
[2:03:57.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  and that is to keep Donald J. Trump in office.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  You know, we just assume they're praying to God.
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:03.000]  I'm not quite sure. I don't know, Dr. Jepers.
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  I mean, they booed God, tried to vote him out of the party platform.
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  I mean, well, apparently the God they worship is the God of the pagan God of the Old Testament,
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  Malik, who allowed for child sacrifice.
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  I mean, the God of the Bible doesn't sanction the killing of millions and millions of children in the womb.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  I think the God they are worshiping is the God of their own imagination.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  Now, you know why that was taken off the air.
[2:04:27.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  It's powerful, Paul Revere. It's the truth that strikes the heart.
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  And Trump tweeted it.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  And so anyone that Trump supports must be punished because they're supporting Trump.
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  This is pure mafia tactics. I looked up the show this morning, had great ratings.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  I was a powerful preacher, a powerful host.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  Hell, I ought to tune into that show.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  Oh, sorry, you can't. It's been taken off the air.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  We should invite that guy to have a show here.
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  Well, they're right back.
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  Infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video.
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  Well, the president came out this last Wednesday and said,
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  There is an ongoing coup against me by the deep state.
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  They're not going to stop. They're allied with the Communist Chinese.
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:06.000]  It's worse than I thought. It's incredible.
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  And I need the American people to understand what's happening and to spread the word and to call Congress
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:13.000]  and to financially support me into this election.
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  That's all totally true. Please do it.
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:17.000]  Also, Infowars needs your support. I make it easy.

[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:51.000]  Black Friday comes two months early.
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  The mega sale is about to end.
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  We have entered a major jump point in human civilization, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  Amazing things are happening all around us.
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  Mike Adams is going to be joining us coming up in the next segment.
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  Together to that central report that we never got to yesterday,
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  that breaks down the larger globalist plan to take the president out.
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:51.000]  Surely the report is dead on the hierarchy of deep state escalation that will end
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:55.000]  in the attempted assassination of President Trump and engineered terrorism
[2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:59.000]  across America to bring us into a civil war.
[2:06:59.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  I also want to get into the latest censorship that's taking place
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:07.000]  against conservatives, nationalists and Christians,
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  persecuting them, taking away their livelihood and their right to buy and sell in many cases.
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  They don't submit to the technocracy.
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  Only a technocracy could surveil everything and allow this type of anti-human system to come in.
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  That's why it's so dangerous and has to be resisted before it becomes ubiquitous.
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  The smart system is really a slave system.
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  But first, I want to play part of yesterday's press conference where they were sitting down,
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  not the one where he was standing up with the president of Finland.
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:47.000]  It was extremely powerful and I'm not going to have time to get to all of it.
[2:07:47.000 --> 2:07:53.000]  But Trump did a great job as he tackled fake news about the border moat.
[2:07:53.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  I'll get to that after I play part of this report.
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  So this is Trump participates in meeting with President of Finland,
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  takes Q&A on the whistleblower.
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  This is the press conference that we didn't get to yesterday.
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  So here's just part of those highlights.
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  You are meeting the whistleblower's light and danger.
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  Well, the whistleblower was very inaccurate.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:23.000]  The whistleblower started this whole thing by writing a report on the conversation I had with the president of Finland.
[2:08:23.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  Pause has started over again.
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  That's why I can't really air these stops.
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:27.000]  Stop it for five seconds.
[2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:33.000]  Did you hear that hateful deceiver that calls themselves a reporter?
[2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  You're hurting the life, you're endangering the life of the whistleblower.
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  It's a secret person.
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  You have a right to face your accuser.
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  The word is it isn't even a real person.
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  It's a composite of lies put together by Schiff who reportedly wrote the whistleblower complaint.
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  I mean, he reads fake transcripts of the president in the judiciary committee that he chairs.
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  So the intel that it looks like there is no whistleblower is probably true.
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  They'll probably get someone to claim they heard third hand now.
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  But Schiff is a megalomaniac and thinks he's invincible because of all of the things he's gotten away with in his private life, reportedly.
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  Big buddies with Bucky Boy.
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  So these sicko freaks are really something, aren't they?
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  So let's go back to this snake, this spitting cobra.
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  You're endangering their life when you defend yourself. You're guilty. How dare you exonerate yourself?
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  We're lying. You're supposed to roll over and die. We're the anointed ones.
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  Here it is.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  You are bringing the whistleblower's life in danger.
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  Well, the whistleblower's very inaccurate.
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  The whistleblower started this whole thing.
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  Wait, back it up again. I gotta say more. Do you hear that pretentious voice?
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  You are putting the whistleblower's life in danger.
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  She just, how dare you. I mean, you imagine these people actually ran everything?
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  They almost do. They've got your kids.
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  These are the authoritarians that run Big Tech that have no chivalry, no control, no nothing.
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  They just want to do whatever they want.
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  They're idiots.
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  Chivalry is rules so we don't all kill each other, dumbasses.
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  Talking to the left. I'm going to stop interrupting. Go ahead and play it.
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  The conversation I had with the president of Ukraine and the conversation was perfect.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  It couldn't have been nicer. I saw Rick Scott. I saw many of the senators talking about it.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  Many of the congressmen talking about it. Not a thing wrong.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  Unless you heard the Adam Schiff version where he made up my conversation.
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  He actually made it up. It should be criminal. It should be treasonous.
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  He made it up. Every word of it made up and read to Congress as though I said it.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  And I'll tell you what. He should be forced to resign from Congress.
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  Adam Schiff. He's a lowlife. He should be forced to resign.
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  He took a perfect conversation, realized he couldn't read it to Congress because it was perfect.
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  It was a very nice conversation. I knew many people were on the phone.
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  Not only were many people on the phone, we had stenographers on the phone taking it down word for word.
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  He took that conversation which was perfect. He said, I can't read this.
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  So he made up a conversation and he reported it and said it to Congress and to the American people.
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:27.000]  And it was horrible what he said. And that was supposed to be coming from me.
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  But it was all fabricated. He should resign from office in disgrace.
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  And frankly, they should look at him for treason because he is making up the words of the president of the United States.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  But the meaning and it's a disgrace. It should not be allowed to happen.
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  Your own DNI said the cross transcript was consistent with the complaint.
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  No, no, no. He didn't say that. You have to take a look. No, no, no. He did not say that.
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  And in fact, if you look at what he said, he found everything to be very normal.
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  He's a good man and Joe and he found it to be very normal.
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  I saw Schiff trying to go 15, you know, call him Shifty Schiff.
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  We don't call him Shifty Schiff or nothing. He's a shifty dishonest guy.
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  Who, by the way, was critical of one of the great secretariat states.
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  Graduated number one in his last at West Point.
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  Graduated one of the top of his last at Harvard Law School.
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  The most honorable person, Mike Pompeo. And this guy was negative on Mike Pompeo.
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  He can't, you know, there's an expression. He couldn't carry his blank strap.
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  I won't say it because they'll say it was so terrible to say.
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  But that guy couldn't carry his blank strap. You understand that?
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  So you deal with bad people and, you know, I watched China over the last few days
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  and I watched some of these other countries build up, build up, build up.
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  And we built up more than any of them because of me.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  But no help due to the Democrats or a disaster.
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  Everything Democrats, they don't do any work. All they want to do is try and win the election in 2020.
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:05.000]  So they come up with this impeachment nonsense and everyone knows the conversation
[2:13:05.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  all based on one phone call that I had where I'm talking to the president of Ukraine.
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  You'll hear from our ambassadors. You'll hear from some of the folks that know all about the call.
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  Why the call was set up and everything else is perfect.
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  The call was perfect. In fact, Lindsey Graham said, I didn't know you could be so nice.
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  There was no quid pro quo. Remember before they said, the only reason I put that out
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  and I did it with the approval of Ukraine, by the way, otherwise I couldn't have done it
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  was because the whistleblower was so dishonest.
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  The whistleblower said terrible things about the call,
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  but he then, I then found out he was second hand and third hand.
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  In other words, he didn't know what was on the call.
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  No, these are bad people. These are dishonest people.
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  Again, I'm going to stop right here. Folks is completely obvious.
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  We all know what's going on.
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  Jeff made it up. We now know that the committee had it not days,
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  but a week before it supposedly was reported to the Justice Department as a whistleblower.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  The text was in Jeff's hands. Of course, he wrote it with lawyers.
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  We know they wrote it. We know lawyers wrote it.
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  So they just made this up.
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:26.000]  Did they talk to a few people that said, oh, I heard maybe,
[2:14:26.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  but he's already putting out fake transcripts,
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:35.000]  hoping that that's what was on the tape.
[2:14:35.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  It's been recorded and what the stenographers,
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:42.000]  you know, the court reporters, basically those stenographers wrote down
[2:14:42.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  because that's what five senators, it's not for five senators.
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  He's dead now, but he's on record threatening them if they didn't do what he wanted.
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:54.000]  Four living senators and all these other people,
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  and Jeff's on the phone been recorded demanding stuff out of the Ukrainians and being chomped.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  So they thought Trump acts like a thug like they do.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  And so, Jeff with a couple lawyers cooked this up.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  By the way, that's what I said last week.
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  But Levin said he's a lawyer.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:22.000]  He read, he said lawyers wrote this, not a whistleblower.
[2:15:22.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  He said big corporate lawyers. Yeah, like, sh-shif, shifty shif.
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  If he'll read a fake transcript up there and then only later say it's fake,
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  a little proviso, no one bopped that was real.
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  Later. Of course, it's from him.
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  He wrote it with two or three other people.
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  They'll claim they heard it from somebody else. It's all fake. It's fake, too.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  We know it's a lie.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:16:10.000]  Tomorrow's news today. Watch. He wrote it. He wrote it.
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  He wrote it.
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  He wrote it.
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:22.000]  Go to Black RifleRealEstate.com. That's Black RifleRealEstate.com.
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:18:00.000]  I'm up here with the crew. I'm late at night, but I can't leave the office
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  because history's happening right now. This is a battle of wills
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  between those that want a free world and those that want tyranny.
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  Those who've bet against humanity and those who've bet on humanity.
[2:18:11.000 --> 2:18:14.000]  So I'm so thankful to you, the listeners. You are the salt of the earth.
[2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:17.000]  You are the people that understand what's happening
[2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:20.000]  and who have helped launch a worldwide revolution against tyranny.
[2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:23.000]  So I thank you again, but please understand how important you are
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:26.000]  and understand that your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support
[2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  is absolutely more critical than ever.
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  Not just for President Trump, but for M4 Wars,
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  who is President Trump's bullhorn of nationalism and patriotism.
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  Please spread the word about M4Wars.com.
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:19:03.000]  You have all the power in the world, but you must use it. You must take action.
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:07.000]  As of taping this, it's Wednesday afternoon.
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  We're running the biggest sale we've had since last Christmas.
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  It's store-wide free shipping, 50% off the high-quality supplements for M4's life,
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:19.000]  and all the preparedness items like water filtration, air filtration,
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  storable foods, shortwave radios, and so much more.
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:26.000]  This is a huge special. We just sell a lot of product to fund ourselves,
[2:19:26.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  and these sales are a great way for you to get great prices,
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:32.000]  but also support the M4. Please take action today.
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  I've got to end this sale by Sunday or Monday at the max,
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  because a bunch of the items are about to sell out.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  Again, too many deals to fit them all in here.
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:44.000]  Just please go to M4Wars.com and realize during this critical time
[2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  that the global is trying to take us off the air.
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:20:05.000]  Your support is absolutely essential, so thank you.
[2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:22.000]  My eyes are blind, but I can see.
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:37.000]  I wanted to get Mike Adams back on.
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  I appreciate him joining us because he wrote an article a few days ago
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:46.000]  that's paramount at naturalnews.com.
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  The hierarchy of deep state escalation that will end in the attempt
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  of assassination of President Trump and engineered terrorism across America.
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  And sometimes if something is so serious and so real,
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  people can't seem to grip it or deal with it.
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  If it's a nebulous theory, well, then people are excited about it.
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  But when the Democrats are openly saying they're going to kill him,
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:10.000]  they're going to remove him, they're going to impeach, imprison, kill,
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  you've predicted, you know, yesterday off air,
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  you said I think they're going to try to epstein him
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  if they can ever get him in jail.
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  And they keep moving forward with all this impeachment.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  It's a very serious threat, not that he's done anything wrong,
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  but justice doesn't matter here.
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  If they can threaten enough senators,
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  and we see all these Republicans resigning and quitting
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  under blackmail or payoffs, they can get what they want.
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  But I agree with you, if they don't succeed,
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  they're going to go to assassination.
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  Let's talk about the hierarchy of deep state escalation.
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  Let's encapsulate it and then go through the details.
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  Thanks for joining us, Mike Adams.
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:43.000]  You bet. I'm glad to join you today, Alex.
[2:21:43.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  What's important for people to understand is that
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  they're going to have to hunker down for a very long drawn out war
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  that the deep state Democrats are going to take to a hot phase
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  if they don't succeed in taking Trump out with a soft coup.
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:21:59.000]  So they do have a schedule of escalation,
[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:03.000]  and that schedule includes kinetic warfare, terrorism,
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:05.000]  and they're going to target the deplorable.
[2:22:05.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  So it's not enough for the left to just destroy Trump
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  or try to even kill Trump.
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  They also want to punish and terrorize Trump supporters
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  all across America.
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:18.000]  For example, I believe that certain cities like El Paso
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  not long ago are being chosen because they are in red America
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  to carry out or encourage, you know,
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:29.000]  acts of violence against the American people.
[2:22:29.000 --> 2:22:31.000]  I wouldn't be surprised to see that pattern repeated
[2:22:31.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  all across America.
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:36.000]  But you got to understand, I know you do,
[2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  but the deep state, they don't care how many innocent Americans
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  they kill in the process of taking out the president
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  if they think they can succeed in assassinating Trump
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:50.000]  or even having what I said an area effect weapon,
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  which could be biological, nuclear, or chemical,
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  something that they could blame on a patriot.
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:01.000]  So that way they could accomplish two birds with one stone.
[2:23:01.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  In their view, they could kill Trump.
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  They could make it look like a patriot did it.
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  They could make it look like Trump wasn't the target,
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:10.000]  but was just caught in the area effect of this weapon system.
[2:23:10.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  And let's be clear, the Democrats are all saying
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  we have to wipe out his supporters.
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  We have to level them. We have to destroy them.
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  These are all terms being used as talking points.
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:21.000]  You can turn channel to channel.
[2:23:21.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  They're saying it's not enough to remove Trump.
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  We need to kill Trump, and they're getting away with it.
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:30.000]  So it shows they're trying to normalize with their operatives
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  going to this level, but the Clintons, we know,
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  are still in charge to a certain extent of the deep state.
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  They staged Oklahoma City. That was conclusively proven.
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  Films, books have been written.
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  We know the names of who did it, the bombs.
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  The hotel receipts are very sloppily done.
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  He was going to lose reelection.
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:48.000]  He said the next year he won reelection.
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  He said on Air Force One to the press corps because of Oklahoma City.
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  So yes, they follow the same patterns.
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:55.000]  So look for big false flags.
[2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  In fact, if you go back through American history,
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  even studying more about the JFK assassination
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  is written by the late Jim Mars,
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  who was one of the best independent investigators
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:07.000]  in the history of the state of Texas, by the way.
[2:24:07.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  You know, media, a real journalist, Jim Mars.
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:12.000]  And a good friend of mine, sad to lose him.
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:14.000]  Absolutely. I know.
[2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:17.000]  He was a real treasure for our time.
[2:24:17.000 --> 2:24:20.000]  JFK was assassinated by the deep state.
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:24.000]  And then RFK, Senator RFK, was assassinated by the deep state.
[2:24:24.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  And then Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated by the deep state,
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  threatened by the FBI.
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  The FBI ran all the cover-ups in all these.
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  And then you go to 9-11, or you go to Oklahoma City,
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  which was carried out, of course, to try to silence and censor Rush Limbaugh
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  and conservative radio.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  They were trying to shut that down.
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  Within 25 minutes, Bill Clinton blamed Talk Radio and Rush Limbaugh.
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  Yes. So you got to understand, folks,
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  everything you think you know about American history,
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  it's all been staged.
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  Every major event has been fabricated.
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  Well, I mean, the real events, real violence,
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  but the narratives are faked for your mind.
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  It's theater for your mind.
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  And they are doing the same exact thing right now.
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  And they are always willing to kill thousands of Americans.
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  They've done it before, and they're going to try to do it again,
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  especially if they can take out Trump in the process.
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  But what I think they underestimate, Alex,
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  is that the backlash from the American people would be historic.
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  I mean, the people, see, they think it's just Trump, right?
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  I think if Trump goes away, the American people are going to fall back in the line.
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:30.000]  And that's never going to happen.
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  Trump is just a representative of what the people want
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  and now demand liberty, national sovereignty, national security,
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  all of these things that are important to the American people.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  Even if they were to take out Trump, God forbid,
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  the American people, I believe, would rise up
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  and defend their nation against these tyrants, these deep state traders,
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  these treasonous actors that Trump is trying to take down.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  And you said something key here. There have been criminal networks
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  in every major powerful empire or government ever.
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  And there's always a fight where evil tries to take over something virtuous, strong.
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  I mean, America was amazing compared to other nations.
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  We still had big problems, but hands down the most freedom, the most success,
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:11.000]  the most inventions, the most wealth, the most real chance to be diverse in your ideas.
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  True liberalism, not fake modern fascism under the name liberalism
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  or the whole left-hand path system.
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  You always had compartmentalization in the FBI, the CIA, these agencies.
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  Most people weren't bad, but it was the top groups, the globalist groups,
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  the blue bloods that were actually using the clandestine systems
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  to carry this out where everything was like a Lego set,
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  but only the elites could put it all together.
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  Well, now because of the Internet and other things, that's all decompartmentalized.
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  And so one of the biggest things hanging over their head isn't just the American people.
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  It's people in these agencies now know the big picture
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  and actually understand what's happening.
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  Like, I've never been in these agencies or worked with these agencies.
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  I'm more proud of the fact that I'm organic.
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  It's like you, but I later learned with so many huge guests we've had on
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:57.000]  from the Defense Department, the CIA, Special Operations,
[2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  they'll say, yeah, 20 years ago or 15 years ago, I was in Afghanistan
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:04.000]  or I was in Africa or I was in Asia or I was, and there'd be the CIA, you know,
[2:27:04.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  head of operations that area would say, this is where you really get the truth.
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  The guest on Alex Jones, this guy gets it.
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  I can't tell you the secret stuff. Just listen to this. It's true.
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:17.000]  So I'm not bragging, but we were used, you and all the guests here,
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  as a decompartmentalization by people inside that didn't like what was happening.
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  So it's been a process of us not being naive anymore is what I'm saying.
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  Well, right, exactly. I mean, the reason for the desperation is because they've lost control of the narrative
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  because of the rise of independent media, which really has encouraged independent thinking.
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  And the greatest enemy to the deep state tyrants and authoritarians
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  is people who can think for themselves.
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  Just like George Carlin said in a clip, I think you ran yesterday.
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  It's it's obedient workers that they want and they can't have people who can think for themselves
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  and question the system and ask rational questions like, hey, why are all the heartburn drug being sold
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  at the pharmacies contaminated with cancer causing chemicals?
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  And that news just broke yesterday or the day before.
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  You put that out years ago and let's expand on that.
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  I mean, well, look, big pharma runs a repeat business model for revenues.
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  Their drugs give you cancer and it's now admitted.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  It's now out in the open.
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  You take their heartburn drugs that you buy over the counter.
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  You're going to get cancer because they contain a chemical compound called nitrosamines or NDMA,
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:28.000]  which is in that class and they will give you cancer and they'll make money off you
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  as you're dying and suffering from cancer because they don't care about you.
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  They just want to use you and toss you out like trash.
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:36.000]  No, they do care.
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  They want to torture you slowly and get all your money.
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  Like the Bayer documents show, they knowingly put HIV and hepatitis in with the Clintons on purpose
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:50.000]  to as an active evil that they can they admitted that lawsuits that they did on purpose as an active evil.
[2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  So you're wrong, Mike.
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  They love to kill us.
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  They love us.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:58.000]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong trying to fact check the president?
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  The deceptive, humpy, dumpy troll known as Brian Stelter and his little weasel minion, Oliver Darcy,
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:10.000]  have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air into censor us.
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  And of course, he famously said on many others that Trump is the Info Wars president.
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:22.000]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the Info Wars president.
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:28.000]  And you know what is true? Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew and my drive and your drive
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:32.000]  has brought Trump to the White House and other nationalists to power around the world.
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:38.000]  And now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:40.000]  So this is a day of great victory.
[2:29:40.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  And I salute you all, but now I'm the thick of the fight.
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:45.000]  So infowarstore.com for products you need.
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:51.000]  Massive sales now so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end
[2:29:51.000 --> 2:29:54.000]  until we've defeated them.
[2:29:54.000 --> 2:30:01.000]  The globalist and their Democrat minions are on the verge of taking this cold civil war hot.
[2:30:01.000 --> 2:30:09.000]  They have pushed and pushed and pushed and engaged in hoaxes and crimes and censorship and sabotage of the economy
[2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:14.000]  and attacks run by the UN on the border that are nothing short of war.
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:22.000]  And that's because it is a war by multinational corporations, ally with the chai comms and others, with the Hollywood, America-hating, God-hating filth
[2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:24.000]  to try to capture the United States.
[2:30:24.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  This is 21st century war.
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:30.000]  And wars need money to be prosecuted.
[2:30:30.000 --> 2:30:34.000]  And we're actually winning the war, but the enemy's throwing their full weight at us right now.
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:36.000]  That's why we need financial support.
[2:30:36.000 --> 2:30:37.000]  It's a total 360 win.
[2:30:37.000 --> 2:30:38.000]  Double patriot points.
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  50% off.
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:40.000]  Storewide free shipping.
[2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:44.000]  It's about to end, but we're running out of a lot of these products at infowarstore.com.
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:50.000]  And I need you to get in there, step to the plate, get high quality products you already need, and fund the information more.
[2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:52.000]  infowarstore.com.
[2:30:52.000 --> 2:31:00.000]  You know, I'm angry because I'm not just going to sit here and take this scientific dictatorship
[2:31:00.000 --> 2:31:06.000]  that admits it's putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, it's putting fluoride in the water to brain damages,
[2:31:06.000 --> 2:31:11.000]  and that it's trying to literally destroy our families and organize us into a bunch of dumb-down slaves
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:14.000]  so they can then carry out or orderly extermination.
[2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:15.000]  I'm not putting up with it.
[2:31:15.000 --> 2:31:20.000]  And our information, our truth is devastating to the scumbag satanist.
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:21.000]  But we've got to stay on air.
[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:23.000]  And I make it easy for you to help us stay on air.
[2:31:23.000 --> 2:31:26.000]  We sell products that are high quality directly to you.
[2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:29.000]  So we have to worry about the globalists harassing our sponsors.
[2:31:29.000 --> 2:31:34.000]  And these are amazing supplements, amazing products, amazing books, films, t-shirts, you name it.
[2:31:34.000 --> 2:31:37.000]  All of it is about spreading the word, and all of it's about being healthier.
[2:31:37.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  infowarstore.com, double-patriot points right now, store-wide free shipping,
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:45.000]  50% off all the high-quality supplements, and so many other big deals on apparel, you name it.
[2:31:45.000 --> 2:31:47.000]  Just please take action during this critical time.
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:53.000]  infowarstore.com, or AAA-2533139, whatever you do, take action.
[2:31:53.000 --> 2:31:55.000]  infowarstore.com.
[2:31:55.000 --> 2:32:00.000]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  Didn't I say a thousand times that there's no way you're going to have an authoritarian corporate world government
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:09.000]  above the law that doesn't pay taxes, that has diplomatic immunity,
[2:32:09.000 --> 2:32:13.000]  that runs around saying it's communist and socialist, power to the people,
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:15.000]  but then meanwhile, it's tax exempt again offshore.
[2:32:15.000 --> 2:32:19.000]  Well, Trump got that, and all these other populists get it.
[2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:22.000]  Why would you throw away wealthy, successful countries and cultures
[2:32:22.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  just so you could say the communist Chinese that David Rockefeller put in power are better than everybody?
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  That is a sick, freakish joke.
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:35.000]  And I will not stand by and watch humanity turn over to these people,
[2:32:35.000 --> 2:32:41.000]  and I beg God for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat.
[2:32:41.000 --> 2:32:46.000]  And I've been saying that prayer for 20-plus years, and God is delivering because God is great.
[2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:49.000]  Thank God for his Son, Jesus Christ.
[2:32:49.000 --> 2:32:53.000]  And now let's move forward against the NW.
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:55.000]  Oh, oh.
[2:32:57.000 --> 2:33:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:11.000 --> 2:33:15.000]  There is a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[2:33:15.000 --> 2:33:19.000]  What?
[2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:21.000]  Alex Jones.
[2:33:21.000 --> 2:33:24.000]  The far-right conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:30.000]  What?
[2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:32.000]  Alex Jones.
[2:33:34.000 --> 2:33:36.000]  Scotland. Russian.
[2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:38.000]  Scotland.
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:43.000]  And the war has come to mind.
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:04.000]  All right, Mike Adams is here, and if you're a new listener,
[2:34:04.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  then you just tune in. We've been playing clips of top Democrats saying,
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  kill the president, imprison him, torture him.
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:18.000]  It's just all assassinating, and it's been going on for three years, but it's getting bad.
[2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:22.000]  Now, that's what tyrants will do is they'll normalize you to something,
[2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:24.000]  them bullying people, attacking people.
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:26.000]  They'll only take a Carlson's house, other people's houses.
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  I'm not going to give them any attention.
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  But it's getting out of control.
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  So we're talking about what do we do to counter that?
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:36.000]  Because we just get up here and cover these huge issues.
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  China shipping in thousands of tons of fentanyl, enough to kill the planet.
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  Just all this stuff that we're just up here talking about it.
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:45.000]  It almost normalizes it.
[2:34:45.000 --> 2:34:50.000]  You know, I've noticed before, if I wear sunglasses on air,
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:53.000]  the view counts on the videos go way up.
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  Or if I wear a cowboy hat or a ball cap, it's just something different.
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:01.000]  Even though I'm covering all these incredible issues that are going on.
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  Like, you can have Liberty Mutual, and then they're not a sponsor.
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  Giving people huge discounts on their insurance.
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  I've looked into it. Pretty good deals.
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  If they have an emu there, everyone goes and looks at their website.
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  But if they don't have the emu, nothing happens.
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  Or it's like the Geico lizard or Aflac with a duck or whatever.
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  So, you know, I don't have fancy stuff like that.
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  All I've got sunglasses here, but people will now have a big viral thing online.
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  Why is he wearing sunglasses?
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  So what I'm getting at here is Mike Adams.
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  We're covering shocking, groundbreaking, huge stuff.
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  We've got a president trying to get control of the country again.
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  We've been sold out to multinationals.
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  This is beyond a movie. It's so epic.
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:45.000]  They're saying, we're going to kill him if we can't remove him.
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  They're putting out huge hoaxes everywhere, and it's escalating.
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:52.000]  And, you know, it's kind of like putting a piece of paper on top of a stove.
[2:35:52.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  It browns and then suddenly flashes into flame.
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  We're reaching that flash point one way or the other.
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  So what do we do?
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  Do I have like llamas on the show or something to get people's attention?
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  I mean, to how serious this is? Fireworks go off?
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:08.000]  I mean, what needs to happen?
[2:36:08.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  Well, I mean, yeah, you make a good point because it requires a cognitive understanding of history
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  and what's happening right now.
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  And frankly, you know, human neurology has been studied by the globalists,
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  and the globalists have found ways to bypass all logic and reason by using mass hysteria.
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  And of course, the reason they use children, these crisis, climate crisis children like Greta,
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  is because, you know, the appearance of a child disarms anyone's criticism.
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  So now they roll out child actors and they roll out fear campaigns that are rooted in nothing.
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:46.000]  And they use distractions to make sure that no one can ever cover the truth of what's happening now
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  or even remember what happened yesterday.
[2:36:49.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  And of course, as you know very well, all along, all the time here,
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:55.000]  they're pushing fluoride in the water supply to dumb you down.
[2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  They're pushing lead, you know, in the food to dumb you down.
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  And now cancer chemicals in the prescription drugs and the over the counter medications and everything else.
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:06.000]  So it's a massive assault on neurology.
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  But they've reversed engineered the way the human mind works.
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:16.000]  What the heck is going on? What do you have there?
[2:37:16.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  No, I mean, keep going.
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:22.000]  Maybe people tune into a band video of the live feed. We're not going to tell them what's happening on TV right now.
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  Okay, okay. Well, this is the psychological warfare test I'm doing.
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  Maybe people care about what's actually happening.
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  They don't care about millions of us down from fentanyl.
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:30.000]  Maybe they'll care about this.
[2:37:30.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  Don't tell them what you see. Don't tell them, Mike, what you're seeing over Skype right now.
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:35.000]  It's too shocking. Come on.
[2:37:35.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  Okay, okay. Well, look, I'm just going to say that people do need to be awakened to what's going on.
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  And if you need to use a little shock value to kind of reset their brains and say,
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:48.000]  whoa, I'm alive. I'm here. We're in a battle. We're fighting for humanity.
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  Then, you know, do that. Do what you need to do because we are in the fight for our lives.
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  We're in the fight for the survival of the human species, frankly, not just America, not just Trump,
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  not just patriots or Christianity, but survival of the human race.
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:04.000]  And that's what you understand so much.
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  And I do as well.
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  And that's, I think that's why people are tuning in because they want to know what's really at stake.
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  Does that, does that make sense?
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  No, it's absolutely true.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  And, you know, Mike, I've just found that, again, people, when something's right out in the open,
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:23.000]  Diane Feinstein with a Communist Chinese agent running her office and all these others getting caught being on the
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  foreign payroll of a government and a system that has killed more people than Hitler,
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  I'm really concerned about it.
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  But like if I had a little Geico lizard, would people care maybe an emu?
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  What if I had a llama? Would they listen to that llama?
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  I don't know.
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  A llama in the background, llamas in pajamas.
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:43.000]  I don't know. A pajama boy llamas.
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  Whatever you need to do, man.
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  I want to ask you, are you llama-phobic?
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  Well, they do spit on people from time to time, but we're used to that.
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  You know, Mad Maxine seems to do that at Trump all the time.
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  So who knows?
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:58.000]  Maybe you're going to have, you know, spitting crazed llamas.
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:00.000]  Are they left-wing llamas?
[2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  There are llamas in the studio right now.
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:07.000]  And I think they're scared of the lights and scared of me, which is wise.
[2:39:07.000 --> 2:39:12.000]  But I'm going to actually get on my wireless mic here in a minute and bring them over here.
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  I thought, you know, other people have lizards and emus.
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  I like llamas.
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:19.000]  And you know, the crazy thing is once you start talking about llamas,
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  suddenly there's llamas everywhere.
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  And so-
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  Well, the lights are going to be freaking them out there behind you.
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:26.000]  Oh, yeah.
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  The display.
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  Absolutely.
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:29.000]  Well, Mike, you keep talking.
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  You guys have the wireless mic working yet, or?
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  No dice on that.
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  Yeah, so I have goats on my ranch.
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  And, you know, goats and llamas are all animals that have to flee predators.
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:39.000]  So they have eyes that can kind of see behind them.
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  They get freaked out about any kind of movement or lights or even clothing flapping.
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  So you're going to have to, like, shut down all the animation to make it calm for them.
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  Although I'm sure they will enjoy the air conditioning because they're high-elevation animals.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  Exactly.
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  Well, what I'm doing, Mike, is, again, just to expect lots of warfare in a good way here,
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  because I found this.
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  Again, let's keep going, Mike.
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:06.000]  Well, okay.
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:11.000]  But, look, whatever we have to do that's legal and lawful and perhaps even entertaining
[2:40:11.000 --> 2:40:16.000]  to wake people up, this is, I guess, the way neurology works these days.
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:20.000]  You know, maybe we do have to jump up and down and scream for humanity to wake up
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  and try to survive it by itself.
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  You know, why aren't there millions of people marching against the deep state right now,
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  you know, peacefully in Washington, D.C., demanding the arrest of these traders?
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  Why aren't there millions of people in the streets right now, again, legally and lawfully,
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  peacefully protesting the attempted political coup against President Trump?
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:45.000]  You know, maybe we need a new approach, a new symbol, a new mascot, some kind of new way
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  to get into people's heads that this is your survival.
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  If they defeat Trump, if they take Alex Jones off the air, then you're next, folks.
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  You are next.
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  It's not about Trump per se.
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  He's just in the way.
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  They're going to come after you next.
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  And the reason they want your guns, of course, is because they're going to use them against you.
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  They want to make sure that they're the only ones who are armed,
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:12.000]  that they have a monopoly on firepower and that you can't defend yourself.
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  They're going to go all out.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  What you think they're going to be, you think if they take out Trump,
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  you think they're going to say, okay, we're done.
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  Now we're going to return to freedom of speech, a fair, free press.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  Everybody's, we're going to play fair now.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  We're not going to, from the left, rig the elections and so on.
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  You think they're going to do that?
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  Not a chance.
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  If they take out Trump, they're going to take out Pence next.
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  They're going to take out every conservative.
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  They're going to take out every Rand Paul in the Senate.
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  They're going to take out every Christian, every Trump supporter,
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  every gun owner, every independent media voice,
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  and they're not going to stop at just censoring you and deplatforming you.
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  They want to kill you.
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  They want to murder you.
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  I've said this before.
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  You cannot coexist in a civil society with lawless, lunatic liars and deceivers,
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:00.000]  which is what the left has become.
[2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  Now I'm not getting any video right now from your studio.
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  How's things going there?
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  I don't think things are going too well here.
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  No one's even responding to me.
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  I think the llamas have put people under a trance.
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  I'm literally talking to my crew.
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  They're like, in trances.
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  Now I'm not actually, I'm not kidding, like magic powers.
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  They will not even respond to me at this point.
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  I was asking, I said, am I on air?
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  Like eight people just are literally under mind control in there right now.
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  This is actually kind of amazing.
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  But you're going to be lucky if the llamas don't eat all your videos.
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  I'm not kidding.
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  I mean, my crew got nerve gas.
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  They're literally cannot talk.
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:34.000]  I went in there.
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  They can't talk out here.
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  They just looked at me and ran out of the room.
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  Do they have psychic powers or something?
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  Because I'm not joking around here.
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:43.000]  I mean, the equipment's not working.
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  None of my crew can talk now.
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  This is insane.
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:48.000]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:49.000]  Oh my God.
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  Are these really robot assassins?
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:53.000]  Oh my God, that one's coming at me right now.
[2:42:53.000 --> 2:42:58.000]  You have all the power in the world.
[2:42:58.000 --> 2:43:00.000]  But you must use it.
[2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:02.000]  You must take action.
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:06.000]  As of taping this, it's Wednesday afternoon.
[2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  We're running the biggest sale we've had since last Christmas.
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:11.000]  It's store-wide free shipping.
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:14.000]  50% off the high quality supplements from Four's Life.
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:18.000]  And all the paradise items like water filtration, air filtration,
[2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:21.000]  storable foods, shortwave radios, and so much more.
[2:43:21.000 --> 2:43:23.000]  This is a huge special.
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  We need to sell a lot of product to fund ourselves.
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:28.000]  And these sales are a great way for you to get great prices,
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:30.000]  but also support the M4.
[2:43:30.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  Please take action today.
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  I've got to end this sale by Sunday or Monday at the max
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:38.000]  because a bunch of the items are about to sell out.
[2:43:38.000 --> 2:43:40.000]  Again, too many deals to fit them all in here.
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:42.000]  Just please go to m4warstore.com
[2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  and realize you're in this critical time.
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:46.000]  But the global is trying to take us off the air.
[2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:50.000]  Your support is absolutely essential, so thank you.
[2:43:50.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  It's all about video.
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  And I just, you've got to share this with people
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  This was amazing.
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  And he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  So Infowars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening.
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  And we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  at band.video.
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  And I got to tell you, we've done great video work.
[2:44:43.000 --> 2:44:44.000]  We've done great films.
[2:44:44.000 --> 2:44:45.000]  We've done so much.
[2:44:45.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  But websites are not our thing.
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:48.000]  Well, now they are.
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:50.000]  I'm so proud of band.video, folks.
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  Check it out.
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  I'm so proud of band.video, folks.
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  I'm so proud of band.video, folks.
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:59.000]  The truth is, President Trump is the most investigated president in history.
[2:45:59.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  He is working for American interests steadfastly.
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  He is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break our borders,
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  bankrupt and devalue our dollar and sign us over to communist Chinese control
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:15.000]  who now own Hollywood and the majority of our debt.
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  We have been maneuvered towards collapse and bankruptcy.
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:23.000]  But at the 11th hour, 58th minute, the American people put a populist in power.
[2:46:23.000 --> 2:46:25.000]  And it's happening all over the world.
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  So great things are happening.
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:29.000]  But the enemy is striking back.
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  They're very serious with this impeachment plan.
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:34.000]  It has bipartisan support.
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:37.000]  And I'm telling you, President Trump needs our prayers and info wars
[2:46:37.000 --> 2:46:39.000]  needs your prayers and support.
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are trying to shut us down.
[2:46:42.000 --> 2:46:45.000]  But right now it's easier than ever to financially support us while getting great products
[2:46:45.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  at the same time with Black Friday comes two months early with store-wide free shipping,
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  double-patriot points and, ladies and gentlemen, 50% off.
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:25.000]  And we just literally had llamas watching themselves on television in here.
[2:47:25.000 --> 2:47:30.000]  This is simply amazing to watch llamas in here.
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:33.000]  And, you know, I did this to shake things up.
[2:47:33.000 --> 2:47:36.000]  Literally, the wireless mic wasn't hooked up.
[2:47:36.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  That's okay.
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:42.000]  Literally, people don't know what to do in the chaos of four llamas running around in my studio
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:44.000]  with hay and food and they're crapping on everything.
[2:47:44.000 --> 2:47:48.000]  But it doesn't matter, ladies and gentlemen, because we have to get out of our programming.
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  That's why in corporate ads they put an emu or a lizard or a duck that talks
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:57.000]  is because they want to get you out of your routine.
[2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:00.000]  I want to get you out of your routine of putting up a fluoride in the water
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  that admittedly lowers your IQ and brain damages you.
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  I want to get you out of your routine with letting the left tell you
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  how you can speak and what you can say.
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  Twitter removes viral Biden meme posted by Trump.
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:16.000]  Talk Show hosts tweeted by Trump on Fox News fired.
[2:48:16.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  Facebook suffers legal blow.
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  EU says they can make them take down whatever they want, calling it hate speech.
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:22.000]  It goes on.
[2:48:22.000 --> 2:48:28.000]  All of the censorship, censorship, DNC demands Facebook remove Trump campaign Biden Ukraine ad.
[2:48:28.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  Christian doctor of 30 years loses his job for refusing to use transgender pronoun.
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:37.000]  Now they're saying Gandhi's bad in races, the SJWs.
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  Officers suspended for detaining suspected illegal alien after traffic incident.
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:43.000]  That's all up on NewsWars.com.
[2:48:43.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  Sweden undergoing demographic experiment of historical dimensions.
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:48.000]  Children taught to convert to Islam.
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  Dems canceled charity event for officer killed in mass shooting over pro-Trump speakers.
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  Hong Kong files charges on man shot for no reason by the police.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  Fashion designers speaking out against tyranny of PC culture.
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  Trump Jr. dubs Adam Schiff, the Jesse Smollett of Congress on steroids.
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:12.000]  But I'm doing it now with llamas.
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  So now it's hitting parts of your brain that are seeing something new.
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:19.000]  You've seen Alex Jones for years tell you fluoride and tell you about Jeffrey Epstein
[2:49:19.000 --> 2:49:23.000]  and tell you about the New World Order and Fish and Fusion and artificial black holes
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  and Strangeless and superconducting super colliders and other systems like cyclotrons.
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  But you've ignored that because it's just all background.
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  But now that I have llamas, now that I have the secret weapon, this is amazing.
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  Here you go, my sweetie.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:43.000]  Poco, which one's the really?
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:45.000]  Poco's the big one.
[2:49:45.000 --> 2:49:49.000]  Poco seems like, can we get a close up of Poco's face for TV viewers?
[2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:52.000]  Poco looks like, it's kind of in master control over here.
[2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  Now it was Drew over here, one of my great camera guys, who said,
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  have you noticed this llama thing?
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  And I said, no, but as soon as he said, you see llamas everywhere.
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:01.000]  There's llama keychains, llama toys.
[2:50:01.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  Suddenly I see my baby daughters always wearing llama shirts.
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:07.000]  There's just llamas everywhere.
[2:50:07.000 --> 2:50:09.000]  Something's going on with llamas.
[2:50:09.000 --> 2:50:11.000]  Ladies, you own llamas. Have you noticed the llama mania?
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:14.000]  I mean, we're going to talk to you in a minute and get serious here about,
[2:50:14.000 --> 2:50:16.000]  because I thought about getting a little piece of property outside Austin.
[2:50:16.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  We thought about, what do we get for our ag exemption?
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:20.000]  Well, maybe a donkey, maybe a llama.
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  Is this just Poco? Poco, how you doing?
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  Come on here, sweetie. Can I give you a cookie?
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:27.000]  Can I give you a cookie?
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  Oh, come on, you want one of these.
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  There's no fluoride in this, because they don't want to brain damage you,
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:34.000]  so the government didn't put that in there.
[2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  Well, you don't want this? You don't trust? Oh, a cookie.
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  That looks good. Come on, I'm nice.
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  You don't look like you've been missing any meals, though.
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  Well, this is a very nice, it's smart.
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  It isn't going to take food from a random person.
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:54.000]  Now, your child takes a vaccine made in China by globalists that swear they want to kill you,
[2:50:54.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  but that's okay. So you're told to trust the system.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:00.000]  You don't know, but this llama would take a cookie from mommy, wouldn't it?
[2:51:00.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  Here, mommy, come give Poco or whatever her name is.
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  A cookie, see, now watch, the llama runs away from me.
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:14.000]  Okay? But, you see, we'll probably take a cookie from mommy,
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:21.000]  but we need to learn to not take cookies from strange Chai-Kong governments that make the fentanyl,
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:23.000]  the mellow meme for you.
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  Mike Adams, would you like to, you didn't know this was happening,
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:30.000]  right? You're here talking about the plan to assassinate the president, but everyone's going to listen now
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:33.000]  because we have the secret weapon. We have the llamas.
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  It's kind of like, Arby says, we have the meats.
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:39.000]  Well, guess what? We have the llamas, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  Mike, Adams National News.
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:44.000]  This is the one day I wish I were there in studio.
[2:51:44.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  I'm really sorry I missed this in person, but, you know, you're talking to your audience today.
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:50.000]  I'm thinking you could reach all the liberals.
[2:51:50.000 --> 2:51:54.000]  You could put a unicorn horn on these animals and call them llama-corns
[2:51:54.000 --> 2:51:56.000]  and have like flying rainbow llama-corns.
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:51:59.000]  And then you could say anything you want to the leftists.
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:03.000]  Wait a minute. Remember when somebody tweeted out four years ago,
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  images of the Trump sons filling a triceratops in Africa
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  and millions retweeted it, pissed that he'd killed an endangered animal,
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:14.000]  even though it's been dead for 25 million years.
[2:52:14.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  You can go, sweetie.
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:16.000]  They like that.
[2:52:16.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:20.000]  Well, I'm just wondering what you're going to do to up the ante beyond this
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  because this is pretty good stuff.
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:25.000]  What's next, Alex?
[2:52:25.000 --> 2:52:27.000]  I'll tell you what, let's cue up Trump's response
[2:52:27.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  that he did not want to put a motor around America with crocodiles and alligators.
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  And then we're going to play a video where we found out
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  where the Democrats actually got that idea for their new hoax.
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  But getting serious before we go to that,
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:42.000]  why do you think they're tripling and quadrupling down on hoaxes?
[2:52:42.000 --> 2:52:44.000]  What do you think their in-game is?
[2:52:44.000 --> 2:52:46.000]  Because it's only discrediting them more, but they keep doing it.
[2:52:46.000 --> 2:52:49.000]  Well, they know that it's about to...
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:54.000]  There's going to be sort of the mother of all bombshell document drops
[2:52:54.000 --> 2:52:58.000]  that's going to result in the criminal indictment of many of these deep staters
[2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:00.000]  and Democrat operatives.
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:02.000]  There's no question that that's coming.
[2:53:02.000 --> 2:53:04.000]  So the Democrats already know that they're...
[2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:06.000]  This is the end game for them.
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:11.000]  If they don't remove Trump very soon, probably within the next few months,
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  the Democrats are going to be exposed.
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:15.000]  They're going to be defeated.
[2:53:15.000 --> 2:53:20.000]  They may be discredited for even a generation depending on how much comes out here.
[2:53:20.000 --> 2:53:23.000]  Adam Schiff may be the one who ends up in prison.
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:28.000]  And other operatives such as Brennan or McCabe or many others.
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:34.000]  So right now they know that Trump is gunning for him and Barr has the goods.
[2:53:34.000 --> 2:53:36.000]  It's just a matter of Barr, I think, organizing it,
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  making sure it's an open and shut case, that there are no holes in the indictment.
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  Well, Mike, let's get serious. I agree with what we were texting last night.
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:48.000]  Trump's got to take action. We'll talk about that in a moment.
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:52.000]  You're absolutely right, but it's hard to be serious with this going on.
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:55.000]  But I think we've actually found the whistleblower that Schiff won't release.
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:53:57.000]  I think it's Poco.
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  Did you? Are you the whistleblower?
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  In fact, if Trump even knows who the whistleblower is,
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:03.000]  it's an attempt to kill the whistleblower.
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:05.000]  So I promise I'm not trying to kill this lovely lawnmower.
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:09.000]  But seriously, you believe and I believe there's a lot of evidence
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:12.000]  that Schiff would put out a fake report already, a fake transcript,
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:14.000]  that Schiff probably made this up.
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  They now know that he had the letter days before it was sent to the Justice Department
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  and to the Inspector General.
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:22.000]  And so I think you're right with your gut.
[2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:24.000]  A lot of folks are saying this now.
[2:54:24.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  In fact, we've seen Don Jr. last night after you were texting me saying you thought this.
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:30.000]  Don Jr. says that he's the Jesse Smollett of hoaxes.
[2:54:30.000 --> 2:54:33.000]  And so I think people now are onto the trail.
[2:54:33.000 --> 2:54:36.000]  This is probably made up by him and a few other people.
[2:54:36.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  It's interesting that Don Jr. came up with the same concept
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:42.000]  at the same time that you and I did also independently.
[2:54:42.000 --> 2:54:46.000]  It was obvious that this guy Schiff is the Jesse Smollett of politics now.
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  But remember, go back to that New York Times op-ed
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:54.000]  that they say was written by an insider close to the president in the White House
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  that said, oh, we're all resisting Trump.
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  You know, we're trying to get this guy out.
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:01.000]  I think the New York Times fabricated that person.
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:04.000]  And I think that Schiff is using the same tactic.
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  And the Washington Post has done this before.
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:11.000]  Whenever they need someone to say something, they fabricate a person.
[2:55:11.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  And then they claim you can't know who it is.
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  And we're going to protect this person.
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  The reason they have to protect them is because that person isn't real.
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  It's a figment of their imagination.
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  They're literally making it up.
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  And by the way, when someone's been caught making up dossiers,
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:27.000]  making up fake transcripts, lying over and over again,
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:29.000]  saying, you know, I am Spartacus.
[2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:32.000]  I released a secret document. It wasn't even a secret.
[2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  You have to say, then, they made this up.
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  I mean, it's like if your next door neighbor's robbed three banks,
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  been in prison for 10 years, gets out,
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  and then a bank gets robbed and the description matches them,
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  it probably is them, you know?
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  I mean, so I think it's totally reasonable to say that Schiff staged this.
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:50.000]  So why would he be in such a desperate mode right now?
[2:55:50.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  Well, again, now he has to double down, triple down.
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:54.000]  This is what they do when they get caught.
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:56.000]  They can't admit at any point that, oh, yeah, they made it all up.
[2:55:56.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  They lied. They can't do that.
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:02.000]  And so they have to keep going and hope for a Hail Mary kind of,
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:05.000]  you know, random victory where they could get Trump out for some reason.
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:09.000]  I mean, look, they were hoping that Trump's call with the Ukrainian president
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  was going to be filled with all kinds of impeachable offenses.
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  Because then the reason the Democrats believed that that would happen
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  was because that's what the Democrats would have done on those calls.
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  Remember yesterday, Alex, in studio with you there,
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:27.000]  I was saying, let's see the transcripts of all of Barack Obama's phone calls.
[2:56:27.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  Let's see the 30,000 emails from Hillary Clinton.
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:32.000]  Let's see all of Joe Biden's phone calls.
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  I mean, if we're going to go full public, full transparency,
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:40.000]  let's see all of it because I guarantee you what the Democrats were doing
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  was criminal impeachable activities routinely.
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:48.000]  Hey, where do the llamas like to be petted?
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:50.000]  I'm a neck. Okay, you're good.
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  Oh, I got a friend now.
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  Who's host of the fourth hour? Can you guys tell me that?
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:02.000]  Matt Bracken. Well, Matt will enjoy co-hosts with these llamas.
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  But Mike, I'm glad you're a smart guy.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  I'm not kissing your butt. It's true. I mean, you get psychological.
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:12.000]  I'm doing this to point out how they do this, how they'll sell things
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  by putting something in there to totally change the subject in the brain
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:18.000]  to get people out of their regular patterns.
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:21.000]  And I think it's healthy to do that if people think about what's going on
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:24.000]  with the whole global system and just how much danger we're in.
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  How many people are already dying from the globalist eugenics onslaught?
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  And now China has been allowed to literally gang rape this nation.
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  And now Trump's saying, no, where do you think that's going?
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  We'll do a few more minutes with Mike Adams, naturalnews.com, Alex Jones.
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  And these llamas were brought to you by infowarstore.com.
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  We've got mega sales going that are about to end.
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:55.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[2:58:10.000 --> 2:58:36.000]  Thank you.
[2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:43.000]  Please take advantage of it at infowarstore.com to help us fight even harder into the future.
[2:59:06.000 --> 2:59:32.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[2:59:32.000 --> 2:59:47.000]  Thank you.
[2:59:47.000 --> 3:00:13.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:18.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting World Wine.
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:21.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I just told the crew I need a cup of coffee, make it hot.
[3:00:21.000 --> 3:00:26.000]  I need a big old needle, an injector needle, and a llama.
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  Go into a show.
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:35.000]  Play in rock and roll.
[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:39.000]  It's a long way to the top if you want to warn people about the eugenics operation.
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  But we're doing it right now.
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:43.000]  We're not going to stop us.
[3:00:43.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  You can't have a weirder scene.
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:48.000]  You've got Don Jr. who killed a 25-million-year-old triceratops.
[3:00:48.000 --> 3:00:51.000]  That went total viral, how he killed an endangered species.
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:53.000]  The left actually believed it.
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  And then we've got right here four llamas, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  And now that I've been petting them properly, but the neck, not the ear.
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  These aren't my horses.
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  They're now in love with me.
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:06.000]  Absolutely in love with me right now, Mike Adams riding shotgun.
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  And we're doing this to explain how things really work.
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:12.000]  We're saying, hey, let's give these llamas some fluoride water.
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  And this nice lady right here that owns the llamas with her friends,
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:17.000]  she goes, oh no, only well water.
[3:01:17.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  Anybody that has horses or cows knows if you give them city water,
[3:01:19.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  they die usually in about a year.
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  But don't worry, it's good for your children.
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  Oh God, it's so good.
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:27.000]  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[3:01:27.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  Just drink the fluoride water for your children.
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  Please, please, lower IQ, sterilization, cancer, you don't deserve it.
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  So I was saying, hey, why don't we just, you know,
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  in give them their vaccines?
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:37.000]  You know, I work for a large animal vet and he said,
[3:01:37.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  these teens kill all the dogs and cats.
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  Back when he was a small animal vet and he recommended,
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:43.000]  people not even giving it to him and said, maybe rabies.
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  But ma'am, tell us a little bit about these llamas.
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:47.000]  And have you ever had a gig like this with your llamas?
[3:01:47.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  Tell us about your company, who you are,
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  and some of the strangest gigs you've ever had.
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  Oh boy, I'm from Leslie Lane llamas.
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:01:57.000]  These are my boys here.
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:01:59.000]  Some of our gigs, we do a lot of weddings.
[3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  We do nursing homes.
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:03.000]  These are boys.
[3:02:03.000 --> 3:02:05.000]  I thought it was a girl, does that mean I'm gay?
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  No, they're castrated males.
[3:02:07.000 --> 3:02:09.000]  Two of them are, two of them are.
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  So they're eunuchs. Oh, they're trans.
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  Well, no.
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  Well, some of them are castrated.
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:17.000]  Don't use the wrong pronoun, I'll have to arrest you, ma'am.
[3:02:17.000 --> 3:02:19.000]  Sorry, go ahead and serve.
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:21.000]  Okay, so two of them are still males.
[3:02:21.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  Two of them are castrated males.
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:25.000]  We castrate.
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:25.000]  Geldings.
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:27.000]  Yes, yes, like horses.
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  The new man.
[3:02:27.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  The new man.
[3:02:29.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  Yes, it relaxes them.
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  So they're not so...
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  Good.
[3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:35.000]  That's what I need.
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:37.000]  But we need that when they're working around people
[3:02:37.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  and senior citizens and kids.
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  We don't need this high strung cocky man.
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:43.000]  We don't need wars anymore. We don't need men.
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  Right, not in the llama community.
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:47.000]  I have my breeders who need to be men, but...
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:49.000]  Only rare studs get to...
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  The chosen one.
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  The chosen one to raise the stud.
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  So are these...
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  Is this a prized stud right here?
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:02:59.000]  No, he's a gelding.
[3:02:57.000 --> 3:02:59.000]  He's a gelding.
[3:02:59.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  So which one of these is a stud?
[3:03:01.000 --> 3:03:03.000]  Right here?
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  How's it going, stud?
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:07.000]  Now, but getting serious, tell me about the well water.
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  You don't want to give them fluoride water?
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  We don't give them fluoride water.
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  We give them well water.
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  Oh, why not?
[3:03:11.000 --> 3:03:13.000]  We don't want any of the purities,
[3:03:13.000 --> 3:03:15.000]  the chlorine, the additives,
[3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:17.000]  all the things that they put in there.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:19.000]  Oh, you want to be able to get other llamas pregnant?
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:21.000]  Yeah.
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  Yeah.
[3:03:21.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  Yeah.
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:25.000]  Everybody, I know that race horses or anything,
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:27.000]  so you just don't give them fluoride water.
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:27.000]  Right.
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  So you've been told that?
[3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:29.000]  Mm-hmm.
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  In years, my whole business career,
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  they've only ever had well water.
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:35.000]  Oh, oh.
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:37.000]  Mike Adams is a farmer.
[3:03:37.000 --> 3:03:39.000]  He's got llamas and sheep.
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:41.000]  Mike, tell us, I'm sure you know the same thing, right?
[3:03:41.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  Well, yeah, I have goats
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  and I have donkeys that we rescued from the fires.
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:47.000]  Are you llamaphobic?
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  Yeah.
[3:03:49.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  I haven't been around llamas
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:53.000]  since I was in South America,
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:55.000]  but at that time...
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:55.000]  Oh, you just claim...
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  Oh, you claim you've got llama friends, but I don't...
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  You've got lots of llama friends, but...
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:01.000]  Lama friends?
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:01.000]  Yeah, well...
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  Sorry, Mike.
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  I mean, they drink from tanks.
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  You know, pond water, basically.
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  So that's rainwater, which is clean water.
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  Yeah.
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:09.000]  City water
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:11.000]  will kill every living system eventually.
[3:04:11.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  Yeah, if you put fish in it, they die.
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:15.000]  But give it to your children.
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  Children?
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:17.000]  Mm-hmm.
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  Ma'am, you're awesome.
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  We're going to go to break, but I want to hear more.
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  What's the website if people want to have llamas dropped
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  by their house?
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  Leslielanelamans.com.
[3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  Leslielanelamans.com.
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  Leslielanelamans.
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:29.000]  Don't worry, I'm not going to give your llama a shot.
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:31.000]  Okay.
[3:04:29.000 --> 3:04:31.000]  I just...
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:33.000]  I got a feeling, though, that if I come at it
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  with this needle, it's going to run away.
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  Mm-hmm.
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:37.000]  It is?
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:37.000]  It is.
[3:04:37.000 --> 3:04:39.000]  But what if I was a Chinese government
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  and I was known to put cancer viruses in it?
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:43.000]  Shouldn't I just give it cancer?
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:43.000]  No. Please, ma'am.
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  Fluoride, please.
[3:04:43.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  No.
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  What about glyphosate?
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:47.000]  I don't even know what that is.
[3:04:47.000 --> 3:04:49.000]  Oh, you don't know about Roundup?
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:04:51.000]  How good it is for you?
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:04:51.000]  Oh, no. No, no.
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:53.000]  You don't want to die?
[3:04:53.000 --> 3:04:55.000]  Oh.
[3:04:53.000 --> 3:04:55.000]  Well, the president came out
[3:04:55.000 --> 3:04:57.000]  this last Wednesday and said
[3:04:57.000 --> 3:04:59.000]  there is an ongoing coup against me.
[3:04:59.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  By the deep state, they're not going to stop.
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:03.000]  They're allied with the Communist Chinese.
[3:05:03.000 --> 3:05:05.000]  It's worse than I thought. It's incredible.
[3:05:05.000 --> 3:05:07.000]  And I need the American people to understand what's happening
[3:05:07.000 --> 3:05:09.000]  and to spread the word and to call Congress
[3:05:09.000 --> 3:05:11.000]  and to financially support me into this election.
[3:05:11.000 --> 3:05:13.000]  That's all totally true. Please do it.
[3:05:13.000 --> 3:05:15.000]  Also, in full worse, need your support.
[3:05:15.000 --> 3:05:17.000]  I make it easy. We have the very best supplements

[3:05:26.000 --> 3:05:28.000]  all the best systems, the lowest prices.
[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:31.000]  And right now, the sales got to end the next few days.

[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:47.000]  because history is taking place.
[3:05:47.000 --> 3:05:49.000]  Black Friday comes two months early.
[3:05:49.000 --> 3:06:18.000]  The mega sale is about to end.
[3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:20.000]  A lot of times people sell the ranchers
[3:06:20.000 --> 3:06:22.000]  and they don't know what to do with the llamas,
[3:06:22.000 --> 3:06:24.000]  so they leave it for the new owners.
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:26.000]  I just figured there's all this really heavy news.
[3:06:26.000 --> 3:06:28.000]  China's got thousands of missiles now
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:30.000]  that can blow the U.S. up because the Clintons gave it to them.
[3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:32.000]  And openly they're saying kill Trump all of the news.
[3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:34.000]  I thought we'd just shake it up and have some llamas.
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:36.000]  I just think what else can we do?
[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:38.000]  You know, they've got a bunch of big,
[3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:48.000]  I think they've got thousands of missiles now
[3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:54.000]  that can blow the U.S. up because the Clintons gave it to them.
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:06:56.000]  I thought we'd just shake it up and have some llamas.
[3:06:56.000 --> 3:06:58.000]  I just think what else can we do?
[3:06:58.000 --> 3:07:02.000]  Drue over here. One of the great camera guys.
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:05.000]  Have you noticed what was llama manning?
[3:07:05.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  of people trying to sell my grandmother in East Texas
[3:07:07.000 --> 3:07:09.240]  on an emu craze, emu farms.
[3:07:09.240 --> 3:07:10.800]  That didn't go anywhere.
[3:07:10.800 --> 3:07:12.560]  No, no.
[3:07:12.560 --> 3:07:16.360]  They're not very friendly, like llamas can be friendly.
[3:07:16.360 --> 3:07:19.320]  In fact, why didn't that insurance company,
[3:07:19.320 --> 3:07:21.360]  Liberty Mutual, get a llama or something?
[3:07:21.360 --> 3:07:22.680]  You know, right?
[3:07:22.680 --> 3:07:25.240]  Right, exactly, exactly.
[3:07:25.240 --> 3:07:27.560]  We could have made a great commercial with the llamas.
[3:07:27.560 --> 3:07:29.480]  I'm calling it the llamas mine.
[3:07:30.480 --> 3:07:32.520]  Now, let's talk about this.
[3:07:32.520 --> 3:07:35.520]  I'm not going to do anything to the llama,
[3:07:35.520 --> 3:07:39.880]  but I think that we should give children at birth 60 shots,
[3:07:39.880 --> 3:07:41.200]  even though it'll kill them.
[3:07:41.200 --> 3:07:42.800]  But the government says it won't hurt them,
[3:07:42.800 --> 3:07:44.720]  even though on the insert it says it'll kill them.
[3:07:44.720 --> 3:07:49.720]  And I'm just wondering why we just shouldn't get,
[3:07:50.160 --> 3:07:52.760]  I mean, have you been giving your llamas their shots?
[3:07:52.760 --> 3:07:57.360]  We give the basic minimums that the vet needs us to have
[3:07:57.360 --> 3:07:58.760]  so that they don't get sick
[3:07:58.760 --> 3:08:01.440]  and it's been proven in the camelette industry.
[3:08:01.440 --> 3:08:02.280]  Sure.
[3:08:02.280 --> 3:08:03.400]  I've got them dying, so I have.
[3:08:03.400 --> 3:08:04.240]  No, no, I mean, I mean,
[3:08:04.240 --> 3:08:05.080]  there are some vaccines that actually work.
[3:08:05.080 --> 3:08:06.640]  I'm not saying that technology doesn't work,
[3:08:06.640 --> 3:08:08.120]  but when you get to like 60 or so,
[3:08:08.120 --> 3:08:10.600]  it's been proven human life expectancy is dropping
[3:08:10.600 --> 3:08:12.440]  in every country that has over 10 vaccines.
[3:08:12.440 --> 3:08:14.400]  Right, right, they get one a year.
[3:08:14.400 --> 3:08:15.520]  Yeah.
[3:08:15.520 --> 3:08:18.640]  Also, nobody wants to spike the llama stuff with anything.
[3:08:18.640 --> 3:08:21.520]  Would you trust China that makes 90% of our vaccines?
[3:08:21.520 --> 3:08:23.320]  No, no, no, no.
[3:08:23.320 --> 3:08:25.760]  I like my American companies.
[3:08:25.760 --> 3:08:26.920]  Well, I'd like you to just have a few minutes
[3:08:26.920 --> 3:08:27.760]  to talk about your llamas.
[3:08:27.760 --> 3:08:29.640]  And I'm going to go get a copy of a book right here.
[3:08:29.640 --> 3:08:31.240]  It's actually right here.
[3:08:31.240 --> 3:08:32.120]  You can read it online for free.
[3:08:32.120 --> 3:08:34.440]  This is written by the Chinese military.
[3:08:34.440 --> 3:08:36.280]  Unrestricted warfare.
[3:08:36.280 --> 3:08:39.720]  And it talks about how they ship heroin into the U.S.
[3:08:39.720 --> 3:08:43.240]  to take us down and how they also spike and poison
[3:08:43.240 --> 3:08:44.760]  the medicines that are made there.
[3:08:44.760 --> 3:08:46.840]  This is actually put out by their military.
[3:08:46.840 --> 3:08:47.800]  I wonder why our government,
[3:08:47.800 --> 3:08:48.640]  Trump's trying to stop it.
[3:08:48.640 --> 3:08:50.800]  I wonder why our government ships all that in here then.
[3:08:50.800 --> 3:08:52.720]  I mean, under Obama.
[3:08:52.720 --> 3:08:54.160]  Unrestricted warfare, folks.
[3:08:55.600 --> 3:08:56.600]  I know it's pretty heavy.
[3:08:56.600 --> 3:08:57.960]  You probably never come somewhere.
[3:08:57.960 --> 3:08:58.960]  Tell me the type of this.
[3:08:58.960 --> 3:08:59.920]  Take over for a few minutes.
[3:08:59.920 --> 3:09:02.480]  Tell me about your business.
[3:09:02.480 --> 3:09:04.560]  Your business has your cool name on it.
[3:09:04.560 --> 3:09:07.320]  And how you got into llamas and some of the things you do.
[3:09:07.320 --> 3:09:08.640]  Oh boy, okay, so.
[3:09:08.640 --> 3:09:11.000]  You're now hosting an international program.
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:12.960]  Okay, so don't walk away from me.
[3:09:12.960 --> 3:09:17.640]  So I got into llamas because I wanted a horse farm.
[3:09:17.640 --> 3:09:20.280]  And we had a coyote problem.
[3:09:20.280 --> 3:09:22.280]  So somebody told me to get some llamas
[3:09:22.280 --> 3:09:25.080]  that they'll keep the coyotes out of my pasture.
[3:09:25.080 --> 3:09:29.360]  So we bought two llamas and got to watch them actually guard
[3:09:29.360 --> 3:09:32.360]  and chase the coyotes and the dogs out of my horse pasture.
[3:09:32.360 --> 3:09:33.200]  Pretty exciting.
[3:09:33.200 --> 3:09:34.040]  It was, and that was.
[3:09:34.040 --> 3:09:35.520]  So these guys can be pretty mean.
[3:09:35.520 --> 3:09:36.360]  They can be.
[3:09:36.360 --> 3:09:37.840]  They protect their own.
[3:09:37.840 --> 3:09:39.360]  You know, they stand up for each other.
[3:09:39.360 --> 3:09:40.480]  That's not good.
[3:09:40.480 --> 3:09:43.760]  So as soon as I saw the female llama chase the dogs
[3:09:43.760 --> 3:09:45.600]  out of the pasture and the gelding
[3:09:45.600 --> 3:09:47.600]  bring the baby down to the barn,
[3:09:47.600 --> 3:09:49.080]  I knew then I needed more llamas.
[3:09:49.080 --> 3:09:49.920]  So.
[3:09:49.920 --> 3:09:50.760]  That's what I was told to my buddy
[3:09:50.760 --> 3:09:51.880]  that's got some out in Blanco.
[3:09:51.880 --> 3:09:54.200]  He just said that he's got a bunch of donkeys,
[3:09:54.200 --> 3:09:55.480]  and they can run off cars too,
[3:09:55.480 --> 3:09:57.920]  but this big llama chases the coyotes,
[3:09:57.920 --> 3:09:59.320]  and they don't even come around anymore.
[3:09:59.320 --> 3:10:00.160]  Correct, correct.
[3:10:00.160 --> 3:10:02.280]  We, yeah, we have 65 llamas
[3:10:02.280 --> 3:10:05.360]  and we don't have a coyote problem at all.
[3:10:05.360 --> 3:10:06.880]  So what do they do to try to like hit them
[3:10:06.880 --> 3:10:07.840]  with their front?
[3:10:07.840 --> 3:10:09.560]  Well, first they're going to chase them
[3:10:09.560 --> 3:10:11.080]  and they're going to spit at them.
[3:10:11.080 --> 3:10:14.280]  So that's where the whole spitting thing comes into play.
[3:10:14.280 --> 3:10:15.800]  They spit to protect themselves
[3:10:15.800 --> 3:10:17.280]  and to chase the bad guys away.
[3:10:17.280 --> 3:10:18.120]  What does the spit do?
[3:10:18.120 --> 3:10:19.640]  It's not like a cobra.
[3:10:19.640 --> 3:10:24.160]  No, so if they spit on us, it does nothing.
[3:10:24.160 --> 3:10:27.120]  If they spit on a canine, like a coyote or a dog,
[3:10:27.120 --> 3:10:30.440]  it numbs their mouth like novocaine for about 15 minutes,
[3:10:30.440 --> 3:10:31.760]  so they can't bite.
[3:10:31.760 --> 3:10:33.200]  So there is some type of thing in it.
[3:10:33.200 --> 3:10:35.080]  Is there a signal again to spit on me?
[3:10:36.640 --> 3:10:37.480]  I don't mind.
[3:10:38.640 --> 3:10:40.000]  I don't teach my llamas to spit.
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:40.840]  This will go viral.
[3:10:40.840 --> 3:10:42.600]  This is sick of them.
[3:10:42.600 --> 3:10:45.800]  I don't teach the llamas to spit on command.
[3:10:48.640 --> 3:10:51.200]  I do this for the massive ratings, don't I?
[3:10:51.200 --> 3:10:53.840]  No, I suppose that little one over there
[3:10:53.840 --> 3:10:55.440]  would be the first one to spit on you
[3:10:55.440 --> 3:10:56.280]  if you did something.
[3:10:56.280 --> 3:10:58.000]  Well, I don't want to be mean to it.
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:10:59.600]  Well, see, that's the problem.
[3:10:59.600 --> 3:11:00.920]  You know, you have to do something to ignore it.
[3:11:00.920 --> 3:11:03.440]  What if I come at it like it's a newborn baby,
[3:11:03.440 --> 3:11:05.240]  with, say, hepatitis shot that babies don't even need
[3:11:05.240 --> 3:11:07.000]  this deadly, or...
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:09.720]  Oh, you stick in with that and he's going to spit at you.
[3:11:09.720 --> 3:11:11.240]  Well, I don't want to, I don't want to do that
[3:11:11.240 --> 3:11:13.440]  to babies if it was Chinese poison.
[3:11:13.440 --> 3:11:14.280]  We don't want to hurt the llamas.
[3:11:14.280 --> 3:11:16.280]  We only do it to baby humans.
[3:11:16.280 --> 3:11:18.280]  I mean, I'm not a barbarian.
[3:11:18.280 --> 3:11:19.720]  What's the little one's name again?
[3:11:19.720 --> 3:11:21.240]  That's Groot.
[3:11:21.240 --> 3:11:22.360]  Groot? Groot.
[3:11:22.360 --> 3:11:24.240]  Oh, like Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy?
[3:11:24.240 --> 3:11:26.040]  And Rocket Raccoon, yeah.
[3:11:26.040 --> 3:11:27.200]  I'm over here.
[3:11:27.200 --> 3:11:28.760]  I don't want to stampede him.
[3:11:28.760 --> 3:11:30.960]  How do I get spit on here?
[3:11:30.960 --> 3:11:33.440]  Again, the globalists want to assassinate Trump.
[3:11:33.440 --> 3:11:34.800]  It's an emergency transmission.
[3:11:34.800 --> 3:11:36.200]  Only the llamas can save you.
[3:11:36.200 --> 3:11:37.040]  News Wars.com.
[3:11:37.040 --> 3:11:38.080]  News Wars.com.
[3:11:38.080 --> 3:11:39.600]  Don't go to the band, I think it's...
[3:11:45.040 --> 3:11:46.640]  I'm not too scary.
[3:11:46.640 --> 3:11:48.520]  I mean, I kind of look like Jocelyn Elder
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:51.760]  is trying to teach three-year-olds out at Master Bay.
[3:11:51.760 --> 3:11:55.280]  Reach now and help the little child.
[3:11:55.280 --> 3:11:56.760]  All right, it's not scary, but he knows I'm nice.
[3:11:56.760 --> 3:11:57.960]  No, he can't.
[3:11:57.960 --> 3:11:58.760]  I can't.
[3:11:58.760 --> 3:12:00.920]  How do I get the spit on me?
[3:12:00.920 --> 3:12:04.240]  Well, you would have to pretend to be a coyote.
[3:12:04.240 --> 3:12:07.240]  Ma'am, this lady's looking at me like I'm completely insane.
[3:12:07.240 --> 3:12:08.440]  And yes, ma'am, I am insane.
[3:12:08.440 --> 3:12:09.960]  How you doing?
[3:12:09.960 --> 3:12:10.760]  How you doing? What's your name?
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:11.440]  Linda.
[3:12:11.440 --> 3:12:12.240]  Linda?
[3:12:12.240 --> 3:12:15.080]  Have you ever been to some place this strange in your whole life?
[3:12:15.080 --> 3:12:16.360]  Actually, stranger.
[3:12:16.360 --> 3:12:17.880]  Really?
[3:12:17.880 --> 3:12:20.200]  Tell me about it.
[3:12:20.200 --> 3:12:21.160]  Probably can't.
[3:12:21.160 --> 3:12:22.120]  No, I can't.
[3:12:22.120 --> 3:12:23.400]  Tom, that flying saucer landed.
[3:12:23.400 --> 3:12:25.160]  All those clowns came off?
[3:12:25.160 --> 3:12:25.960]  That's it.
[3:12:25.960 --> 3:12:27.320]  You were there?
[3:12:27.320 --> 3:12:28.200]  That was me, ma'am.
[3:12:28.200 --> 3:12:29.400]  OK.
[3:12:29.400 --> 3:12:32.880]  So now you understand.
[3:12:32.880 --> 3:12:33.320]  That's right.
[3:12:33.320 --> 3:12:35.640]  I get it.
[3:12:35.640 --> 3:12:36.280]  You're pretty cool.
[3:12:36.280 --> 3:12:37.520]  Where are you from?
[3:12:37.520 --> 3:12:38.280]  Austin.
[3:12:38.280 --> 3:12:39.440]  That's awesome.
[3:12:39.440 --> 3:12:40.920]  My lot of folks from Austin.
[3:12:40.920 --> 3:12:42.440]  Oh, originally I'm from Minneapolis.
[3:12:42.440 --> 3:12:43.160]  Minneapolis.
[3:12:43.160 --> 3:12:44.080]  That's cool up there.
[3:12:44.080 --> 3:12:44.560]  It is.
[3:12:44.560 --> 3:12:45.480]  Literally and figuratively.
[3:12:45.480 --> 3:12:46.160]  Exactly.
[3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:48.520]  Somalia now.
[3:12:48.520 --> 3:12:50.800]  Got snow in northern Minnesota yesterday.
[3:12:50.800 --> 3:12:52.000]  Did you know I wrote a hit song?
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:54.200]  That seemed like 40 million times.
[3:12:54.200 --> 3:12:56.840]  That's as big as something else is as big as one.
[3:12:56.840 --> 3:12:57.600]  You ever heard of it?
[3:12:57.600 --> 3:13:00.000]  We love our Somalis.
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:02.120]  We love our Muslims, too.
[3:13:02.120 --> 3:13:03.560]  Oh, they're so good.
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:05.280]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[3:13:05.280 --> 3:13:08.440]  That's why I love my llama, too.
[3:13:08.440 --> 3:13:10.960]  Oh, my llama's so good.
[3:13:10.960 --> 3:13:13.520]  I need my llama today.
[3:13:13.520 --> 3:13:15.320]  There's nothing better than a llama.
[3:13:15.320 --> 3:13:19.240]  Say, hey, that's why we got llamas.
[3:13:19.240 --> 3:13:21.240]  We love our llamas.
[3:13:21.240 --> 3:13:22.520]  So you don't care how you look?
[3:13:22.520 --> 3:13:24.120]  You have a lot of fun.
[3:13:24.120 --> 3:13:26.280]  Now, is that the worst thing you've ever seen?
[3:13:26.280 --> 3:13:27.600]  Yeah.
[3:13:27.600 --> 3:13:32.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's what it's all about.
[3:13:32.560 --> 3:13:36.560]  I can see some of the crews really enjoying this back there.
[3:13:36.560 --> 3:13:37.560]  How's it going, ladies?
[3:13:37.560 --> 3:13:39.200]  Is this good?
[3:13:39.200 --> 3:13:40.920]  Some of the people look very, very serious.
[3:13:43.760 --> 3:13:45.760]  She doesn't like it.
[3:13:45.760 --> 3:13:48.400]  Anyways, with my Russian handlers in there.
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:51.320]  All right, folks, we've got to get really serious here.
[3:13:51.320 --> 3:13:54.080]  Mike Adams, what do you think of this situation?
[3:13:54.080 --> 3:13:56.400]  Well, again, I just wonder what you're
[3:13:56.400 --> 3:13:58.280]  going to do tomorrow to up this.
[3:13:58.280 --> 3:13:59.560]  This is good stuff.
[3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:01.480]  Put some names on them.
[3:14:01.480 --> 3:14:04.040]  Give them Obama's llamas or something.
[3:14:04.040 --> 3:14:06.560]  I mean, start giving them names of politicians
[3:14:06.560 --> 3:14:07.640]  and see what they have to say.
[3:14:07.640 --> 3:14:08.720]  Absolutely.
[3:14:08.720 --> 3:14:10.480]  So which one's Peter Schiff?
[3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:12.520]  I mean, not Peter Schiff.
[3:14:12.520 --> 3:14:13.720]  That's the autonomous guy.
[3:14:13.720 --> 3:14:14.400]  Adam Schiff.
[3:14:14.400 --> 3:14:15.320]  Which one's Adam Schiff?
[3:14:18.680 --> 3:14:20.520]  I've got to tell you, Mike, what a weird background.
[3:14:20.520 --> 3:14:23.120]  We've got to try Saratops and that horrible butcher
[3:14:23.120 --> 3:14:26.880]  Don King, Don King, Donald Jr.
[3:14:26.880 --> 3:14:29.320]  I met Don Jr. and Don King on the same day once.
[3:14:29.320 --> 3:14:31.320]  And then, literally, at the RNC.
[3:14:31.320 --> 3:14:33.520]  And then you've also got the Traceratops vector.
[3:14:33.520 --> 3:14:35.480]  You can't top that weirdness right now, can you?
[3:14:35.480 --> 3:14:38.040]  The Schiff llama is the one with the long pencil neck.
[3:14:38.040 --> 3:14:39.040]  That's the answer.
[3:14:39.040 --> 3:14:39.680]  Exactly.
[3:14:39.680 --> 3:14:41.840]  All right, we got former Navy SEAL best selling author
[3:14:41.840 --> 3:14:43.800]  Matt Bracken taking over about serious issues.
[3:14:43.800 --> 3:14:46.400]  But I wanted to break in here and just break the paradigm,
[3:14:46.400 --> 3:14:48.040]  break the internet, do something new.
[3:14:48.040 --> 3:14:51.760]  Only thing weirder could be like midgets on PCP hang
[3:14:51.760 --> 3:14:53.760]  lighting through their office right now.
[3:14:53.760 --> 3:14:54.840]  But that has not happened.
[3:14:54.840 --> 3:14:56.800]  So we are here with the llamas.
[3:14:56.800 --> 3:14:59.080]  These ladies are great.
[3:14:59.080 --> 3:15:03.280]  These are, are you calling yourselves llama wranglers?
[3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:07.120]  Hit them up, wrap them in, grab them out, rawl, hud.
[3:15:07.120 --> 3:15:09.080]  We're very gentle with our animals.
[3:15:09.080 --> 3:15:12.160]  Oh, I know, you got a rowdy eights out there.
[3:15:12.160 --> 3:15:15.520]  No, they're just, you know, you want to be calm and treat
[3:15:15.520 --> 3:15:16.840]  them like with dignity.
[3:15:16.840 --> 3:15:18.080]  That one's really cute over there.
[3:15:18.080 --> 3:15:19.080]  It's a little bit sneaky, though.
[3:15:19.080 --> 3:15:21.720]  There's something sneaky about them.
[3:15:21.720 --> 3:15:24.880]  And I guess they're originally from the Andes Mountains?
[3:15:24.880 --> 3:15:28.480]  Yep, Peru, South America areas, uh-huh.
[3:15:28.480 --> 3:15:31.840]  And are you peaked out at 60 llamas?
[3:15:31.840 --> 3:15:35.160]  No, I have a bunch of babies coming.
[3:15:35.160 --> 3:15:35.660]  Oh.
[3:15:39.200 --> 3:15:41.160]  No llamas were hurt in this transmission
[3:15:41.160 --> 3:15:43.760]  because they weren't given any vaccines or fluoride water.
[3:15:43.760 --> 3:15:46.080]  But hey, nobody gives it to their horses or llamas
[3:15:46.080 --> 3:15:46.680]  as it'll kill them.
[3:15:46.680 --> 3:15:48.000]  Give your children fluoride.
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:49.280]  Give your children fluoride.
[3:15:49.280 --> 3:15:51.800]  Give it to them to do what the government says.
[3:15:51.800 --> 3:15:54.520]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain,
[3:15:54.520 --> 3:15:57.560]  the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[3:15:57.560 --> 3:16:00.920]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month
[3:16:00.920 --> 3:16:02.680]  without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.

[3:16:05.200 --> 3:16:08.040]  blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program
[3:16:08.040 --> 3:16:10.360]  in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[3:16:10.360 --> 3:16:12.880]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels
[3:16:12.880 --> 3:16:15.480]  during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment
[3:16:15.480 --> 3:16:18.440]  used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets,
[3:16:18.440 --> 3:16:20.240]  not a security IPO or note.
[3:16:20.240 --> 3:16:23.120]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[3:16:23.120 --> 3:16:26.920]  leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment
[3:16:26.920 --> 3:16:29.720]  deposited into your bank account each month.

[3:16:45.120 --> 3:16:46.760]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners
[3:16:46.760 --> 3:16:48.560]  consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[3:16:48.560 --> 3:16:50.320]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires
[3:16:50.320 --> 3:16:51.280]  an offering document.
[3:16:51.280 --> 3:16:53.600]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one
[3:16:53.600 --> 3:16:55.200]  silent killer in the US.

[3:17:21.280 --> 3:17:22.480]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[3:17:22.480 --> 3:17:24.560]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[3:17:24.560 --> 3:17:26.400]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[3:17:26.400 --> 3:17:27.960]  I sued the IRS in one.
[3:17:27.960 --> 3:17:30.920]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[3:17:30.920 --> 3:17:32.600]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[3:17:32.600 --> 3:17:34.800]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[3:17:34.800 --> 3:17:36.440]  they thought might never be solved.
[3:17:36.440 --> 3:17:37.640]  I can help you too.
[3:17:37.640 --> 3:17:40.640]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[3:17:40.640 --> 3:17:42.840]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[3:17:42.840 --> 3:17:47.280]  Call 800-34-no-tax or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[3:17:47.280 --> 3:17:50.520]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[3:17:53.160 --> 3:17:55.240]  There are a few things in this universe
[3:17:55.240 --> 3:17:57.320]  that are a sure bet but I'm here to tell you
[3:17:57.320 --> 3:18:00.640]  the products that in FullWarsLife.com are.
[3:18:00.640 --> 3:18:03.360]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated,
[3:18:03.360 --> 3:18:08.360]  best tested, most loved, most documented substances
[3:18:08.360 --> 3:18:10.280]  that God gave us to Mother Nature
[3:18:10.280 --> 3:18:13.160]  and then we make it even stronger, even better
[3:18:13.160 --> 3:18:14.480]  and lower the price.
[3:18:14.480 --> 3:18:17.120]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years
[3:18:17.120 --> 3:18:18.840]  to help with inflammation, headaches,
[3:18:18.840 --> 3:18:21.040]  it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[3:18:21.040 --> 3:18:25.360]  It sells itself but normal turmeric's only has
[3:18:25.360 --> 3:18:27.480]  three to five percent curcuminoid,
[3:18:27.480 --> 3:18:31.760]  the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[3:18:31.760 --> 3:18:33.480]  Originally obviously from India.
[3:18:33.480 --> 3:18:36.000]  Well, body's ultimate turmeric formula
[3:18:36.000 --> 3:18:39.360]  has a 95% curcuminoid level
[3:18:39.360 --> 3:18:41.760]  that's got other natural things that help boost it,
[3:18:41.760 --> 3:18:44.040]  help your body absorb it and that's why people
[3:18:44.040 --> 3:18:45.680]  absolutely love it.
[3:18:45.680 --> 3:18:48.400]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[3:18:48.400 --> 3:18:52.080]  50% off on bodies at in FullWarsLife.com.
[3:18:52.080 --> 3:18:55.040]  The globalist and their Democrat minions
[3:18:55.040 --> 3:18:59.360]  are on the verge of taking this cold civil war hot.
[3:18:59.360 --> 3:19:01.120]  They have pushed and pushed and pushed
[3:19:01.120 --> 3:19:04.760]  and engaged in hoaxes and crimes and censorship
[3:19:04.760 --> 3:19:08.120]  and sabotage of the economy and attacks run by the UN
[3:19:08.120 --> 3:19:11.680]  on the border that are nothing short of war
[3:19:11.680 --> 3:19:13.360]  and that's because it is a war
[3:19:13.360 --> 3:19:15.000]  by multinational corporations,
[3:19:15.000 --> 3:19:16.800]  ally with the chai goms and others
[3:19:16.800 --> 3:19:19.840]  with the Hollywood, America-hating, God-hating filth
[3:19:19.840 --> 3:19:22.120]  to try to capture the United States.
[3:19:22.120 --> 3:19:26.640]  This is 21st century war and wars need money
[3:19:26.640 --> 3:19:29.400]  to be prosecuted and we're actually winning the war
[3:19:29.400 --> 3:19:31.640]  but the enemy's throwing their full way at us right now.
[3:19:31.640 --> 3:19:33.200]  That's why we need financial support.
[3:19:33.200 --> 3:19:35.720]  It's a total 360 win, double patriot points,
[3:19:35.720 --> 3:19:37.680]  50% off, store-wide free shipping.
[3:19:37.680 --> 3:19:39.080]  It's about to end with a running out
[3:19:39.080 --> 3:19:41.200]  of a lot of these products at infowarsstore.com
[3:19:41.200 --> 3:19:43.960]  and I need you to get in there, step to the plate,
[3:19:43.960 --> 3:19:45.800]  get high quality products you already need
[3:19:45.800 --> 3:19:47.600]  and find the information more.
[3:19:47.600 --> 3:19:48.960]  Infowarsstore.com.
[3:19:48.960 --> 3:19:49.800]  No, no, no!
[3:19:56.320 --> 3:19:59.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:19:59.400 --> 3:20:04.400]  The Alex Jones show.
[3:20:07.960 --> 3:20:10.240]  All right, Matt Brackett has taken over
[3:20:10.240 --> 3:20:12.680]  and the reason I did this today is, again,
[3:20:12.680 --> 3:20:15.360]  you see all these ads where they'll have like a talking duck
[3:20:15.360 --> 3:20:18.240]  or they'll have an emu or they'll have a lizard
[3:20:18.240 --> 3:20:20.640]  and that's to get people out of their routine
[3:20:20.640 --> 3:20:22.240]  and get them to pay attention.
[3:20:23.400 --> 3:20:26.040]  And so I gotta bring you llamas in studio
[3:20:26.040 --> 3:20:26.840]  to get that done on will
[3:20:26.840 --> 3:20:29.440]  but imagine 10 million military aged men
[3:20:29.440 --> 3:20:32.160]  the last eight years into Europe given free welfare,
[3:20:32.160 --> 3:20:34.160]  allowed to rape and kill whoever they want.
[3:20:34.160 --> 3:20:35.760]  So if you think my office is a little freaked out
[3:20:35.760 --> 3:20:38.360]  with four nice llamas running around,
[3:20:38.360 --> 3:20:39.600]  imagine what it's like to be in Europe
[3:20:39.600 --> 3:20:40.800]  with the Islamic invasion.
[3:20:41.800 --> 3:20:44.800]  So that's what this comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:20:44.800 --> 3:20:46.960]  So there's a lot of different angles to this
[3:20:46.960 --> 3:20:49.800]  but should they become a regular fixture here?
[3:20:49.800 --> 3:20:51.960]  I don't know, who's gonna be in here tomorrow?
[3:20:51.960 --> 3:20:53.000]  I don't know.
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:57.280]  But there is someone of a llama mania going on
[3:20:57.280 --> 3:20:58.320]  that's really been unannounced.
[3:20:58.320 --> 3:20:59.960]  So I'm officially, you know,
[3:20:59.960 --> 3:21:01.800]  the American flag is one of our logos, you know,
[3:21:01.800 --> 3:21:02.800]  we like that.
[3:21:02.800 --> 3:21:05.000]  I like the Christian cross and, you know,
[3:21:05.000 --> 3:21:08.400]  I just like Texas, I love Texas and I love freedom.
[3:21:08.400 --> 3:21:10.120]  I love the family.
[3:21:10.120 --> 3:21:11.960]  And I see the symbol of the family, a nuclear family
[3:21:11.960 --> 3:21:13.160]  and no attack it's under.
[3:21:13.160 --> 3:21:16.720]  But, you know, llama is a lot cooler than a talking lizard.
[3:21:16.720 --> 3:21:18.880]  And so I gotta tell you, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:21:18.880 --> 3:21:20.400]  that we're very pleased and honored to be here.
[3:21:20.400 --> 3:21:24.960]  And a lot of serious stuff is going on.
[3:21:24.960 --> 3:21:27.840]  But I wanted to, you know, just have a little bit of fun here
[3:21:27.840 --> 3:21:32.640]  but also point out how the system manipulates people
[3:21:32.640 --> 3:21:35.560]  by normalizing all different forms of tyranny
[3:21:35.560 --> 3:21:37.960]  by just having mainstream media to stay very calmly.
[3:21:37.960 --> 3:21:40.000]  Oh, it's drag queen story time.
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:41.840]  Oh, bring your kids to convicted pedophiles
[3:21:41.840 --> 3:21:43.400]  and have them sit in their laps or,
[3:21:43.400 --> 3:21:45.000]  oh, drink fluoride and all the studies say
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:46.560]  it brain damages you and lowers fertility.
[3:21:46.560 --> 3:21:48.880]  And anybody that raises llamas or horses,
[3:21:48.880 --> 3:21:50.920]  they tell you first thing, don't ever give them fluoride water.
[3:21:50.920 --> 3:21:52.440]  It'll kill them in a year.
[3:21:52.440 --> 3:21:54.200]  And see, I never talked to these ladies
[3:21:54.200 --> 3:21:55.160]  before they came here.
[3:21:55.160 --> 3:21:57.800]  Drew set them up, said nothing to them about fluoride.
[3:21:58.800 --> 3:22:00.720]  I say, hey, you give your llamas fluoride?
[3:22:00.720 --> 3:22:02.320]  Hell no, we don't give them fluoride.
[3:22:02.320 --> 3:22:06.120]  I mean, that's something that really sinks in for people.
[3:22:06.120 --> 3:22:08.480]  Let's kill them fluorescent lights.
[3:22:08.480 --> 3:22:10.720]  Get some of that magic ambient light in here now.
[3:22:10.720 --> 3:22:12.320]  You just look at the eyes of these llamas.
[3:22:12.320 --> 3:22:14.480]  See, now they're calm, now they're happy.
[3:22:14.480 --> 3:22:16.440]  Let's fly around on camera seven here
[3:22:16.440 --> 3:22:17.880]  and Matt Bracken is about to take over.
[3:22:17.880 --> 3:22:19.320]  This is just an amazing moment.
[3:22:19.320 --> 3:22:21.240]  And I don't mind the llama in the background.
[3:22:21.240 --> 3:22:24.040]  That did calm them to see the great master llama,
[3:22:24.040 --> 3:22:26.920]  not the dolly llama, not quite a deity in the flesh,
[3:22:26.920 --> 3:22:31.400]  but still someone of something akin to it.
[3:22:31.400 --> 3:22:33.680]  But again, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:22:33.680 --> 3:22:36.200]  this is an attempt to get people thinking
[3:22:36.200 --> 3:22:37.040]  outside the box.
[3:22:37.040 --> 3:22:38.680]  And Matt Bracken's gonna get very, very serious here.
[3:22:38.680 --> 3:22:41.280]  Please don't forget that we're able to fund our reporters
[3:22:41.280 --> 3:22:43.360]  and pull stunts like this and run this operation.
[3:22:43.360 --> 3:22:45.520]  Defines the globalist, thanks to you supporting us.
[3:22:45.520 --> 3:22:47.080]  And we have really serious great products
[3:22:47.080 --> 3:22:48.200]  for store.com.
[3:22:48.200 --> 3:22:49.320]  We have a big huge mega sale.
[3:22:49.320 --> 3:22:50.520]  Black Friday comes two months early.
[3:22:50.520 --> 3:22:51.720]  It's about to end this weekend.
[3:22:51.720 --> 3:22:53.360]  Double Patriot points on any future order,
[3:22:53.360 --> 3:22:54.960]  50% off all the supplements.
[3:22:54.960 --> 3:22:56.400]  And store-wide free shipping,
[3:22:56.400 --> 3:22:58.640]  and that's on water filters, air filtration,
[3:22:58.640 --> 3:23:00.560]  all the great storeable foods.
[3:23:00.560 --> 3:23:03.160]  We hope that we can still be someone of a free country
[3:23:03.160 --> 3:23:05.400]  into the future and be on air to counter all this,
[3:23:05.400 --> 3:23:06.960]  but they're coming after your free speech.
[3:23:06.960 --> 3:23:09.120]  They're coming after your sovereignty.
[3:23:09.120 --> 3:23:11.120]  And they really, shame they wanna come
[3:23:11.120 --> 3:23:13.120]  after our elected president.
[3:23:13.120 --> 3:23:17.920]  And so we've just, you know, are the llamas moaning,
[3:23:19.200 --> 3:23:20.040]  talking?
[3:23:20.040 --> 3:23:23.000]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:24.240]  You know, the Hound dogs do that.
[3:23:24.240 --> 3:23:25.080]  Oh.
[3:23:25.080 --> 3:23:25.900]  Oh.
[3:23:25.900 --> 3:23:27.240]  Oh.
[3:23:27.240 --> 3:23:28.080]  Oh.
[3:23:28.080 --> 3:23:29.920]  Oh.
[3:23:29.920 --> 3:23:30.760]  Let's get their attention.
[3:23:30.760 --> 3:23:32.240]  Why'd you have a place?
[3:23:32.240 --> 3:23:33.920]  Let's go to camera too.
[3:23:33.920 --> 3:23:34.760]  Oh.
[3:23:34.760 --> 3:23:35.600]  Oh.
[3:23:35.600 --> 3:23:36.440]  Oh.
[3:23:36.440 --> 3:23:37.260]  Oh.
[3:23:37.260 --> 3:23:38.080]  Oh.
[3:23:38.080 --> 3:23:38.920]  Oh.
[3:23:38.920 --> 3:23:39.740]  Oh.
[3:23:39.740 --> 3:23:40.580]  Oh.
[3:23:40.580 --> 3:23:41.400]  Oh.
[3:23:41.400 --> 3:23:42.240]  Oh.
[3:23:42.240 --> 3:23:43.080]  Oh.
[3:23:43.080 --> 3:23:45.520]  Is that concerning him or is that like gibberish to them?
[3:23:47.340 --> 3:23:50.360]  I'm communicating, well tell me some of the calls for him.
[3:23:50.360 --> 3:23:51.640]  It's not like a pig like,
[3:23:51.640 --> 3:23:53.820]  su, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we,
[3:23:53.820 --> 3:23:55.240]  we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we.
[3:23:55.240 --> 3:23:56.720]  What kind of, he likes that?
[3:23:57.780 --> 3:23:59.280]  Is it a, is it a.
[3:23:59.280 --> 3:24:00.100]  Oh.
[3:24:00.100 --> 3:24:00.920]  Oh.
[3:24:00.920 --> 3:24:01.740]  Oh.
[3:24:01.740 --> 3:24:02.560]  Oh.
[3:24:02.560 --> 3:24:03.480]  Oh.
[3:24:03.480 --> 3:24:04.300]  Oh.
[3:24:04.300 --> 3:24:05.140]  Oh.
[3:24:05.140 --> 3:24:05.980]  Oh.
[3:24:05.980 --> 3:24:06.820]  Oh.
[3:24:06.820 --> 3:24:07.660]  Oh.
[3:24:07.660 --> 3:24:08.480]  Oh.
[3:24:08.480 --> 3:24:09.320]  Oh.
[3:24:09.320 --> 3:24:10.160]  Oh.
[3:24:10.160 --> 3:24:10.980]  Oh.
[3:24:10.980 --> 3:24:12.040]  A dog?
[3:24:12.040 --> 3:24:16.080]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Matt Bracken is joining us.
[3:24:16.080 --> 3:24:17.160]  Matt, what do you think about this?
[3:24:17.160 --> 3:24:20.160]  You weren't told today enemies of foreign domestic.com
[3:24:20.160 --> 3:24:21.000]  that you would be in the middle
[3:24:21.000 --> 3:24:22.840]  of a invasion of llamas, did you?
[3:24:23.800 --> 3:24:25.360]  Lama fest.
[3:24:25.360 --> 3:24:27.760]  You're not, you're not lama phobic, are you?
[3:24:27.760 --> 3:24:28.600]  Not at all.
[3:24:28.600 --> 3:24:30.360]  You know, I'm in Florida,
[3:24:30.360 --> 3:24:32.560]  so my water supply is completely different
[3:24:32.560 --> 3:24:34.520]  from what's there in the studio.
[3:24:34.520 --> 3:24:36.120]  I'm not drawing any inferences,
[3:24:36.120 --> 3:24:38.400]  but you know, sometimes people forget
[3:24:38.400 --> 3:24:40.560]  that they already took a supplement
[3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:42.640]  and then they took two.
[3:24:42.640 --> 3:24:46.520]  And on some, it could even happen, you could take three.
[3:24:46.520 --> 3:24:48.160]  I'm not saying that there's anything going on
[3:24:48.160 --> 3:24:51.720]  in the Austin studio, but what I'm telling you,
[3:24:51.720 --> 3:24:54.600]  whatever is happening, I wanna get in on it.
[3:24:54.600 --> 3:24:59.600]  Because when you make the point about the emus
[3:25:00.840 --> 3:25:03.520]  and the llamas and the geckos,
[3:25:03.520 --> 3:25:06.600]  Madison Avenue doesn't do any of this by accident.
[3:25:06.600 --> 3:25:09.320]  It's not like some rogue executive gets up
[3:25:09.320 --> 3:25:13.240]  and says, let's spend $100 million on an ad campaign
[3:25:13.240 --> 3:25:15.720]  for something and just see if it works or not.
[3:25:15.720 --> 3:25:17.560]  They've already tested it.
[3:25:17.560 --> 3:25:20.120]  And like what Mike Adams was saying,
[3:25:20.120 --> 3:25:23.320]  the neurological processes are well explored.
[3:25:23.320 --> 3:25:27.200]  These people, the Madison Avenue ad people,
[3:25:28.040 --> 3:25:31.560]  they have, you know, psychologists on the staff.
[3:25:31.560 --> 3:25:33.120]  I mean, they're not just winging it.
[3:25:33.120 --> 3:25:33.960]  Here's an example.
[3:25:33.960 --> 3:25:35.080]  They understand us.
[3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:35.920]  You're absolutely right.
[3:25:35.920 --> 3:25:38.360]  I mean, here's an example I'm gonna want you to take over.
[3:25:38.360 --> 3:25:39.600]  I don't ever really do any marketing.
[3:25:39.600 --> 3:25:41.000]  I just get good products, promote them,
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:41.840]  sell them at a good price.
[3:25:41.840 --> 3:25:42.840]  But last Christmas,
[3:25:42.840 --> 3:25:43.800]  because they put so much pressure on us,
[3:25:43.800 --> 3:25:45.360]  I'm sort of doing some marketing.
[3:25:45.360 --> 3:25:46.680]  And I went to Amazon and I said,
[3:25:46.680 --> 3:25:50.040]  they put billions into their market research studies.
[3:25:50.040 --> 3:25:53.160]  I said, we've got a winter wonderland thing
[3:25:53.160 --> 3:25:56.520]  where it's a blue sky and blue snow and a cottage and trees.
[3:25:56.520 --> 3:25:59.800]  I said, turn it to light color green like they've got.
[3:25:59.800 --> 3:26:03.080]  Less clicks, bigger purchases, boosted sales
[3:26:03.080 --> 3:26:05.360]  on that banner, 20, 30%.
[3:26:05.360 --> 3:26:08.200]  And so yeah, we can't come up with all this stuff ourselves,
[3:26:08.200 --> 3:26:10.320]  but we can just take what the globalists have got,
[3:26:10.320 --> 3:26:11.160]  use it against them.
[3:26:11.160 --> 3:26:12.600]  That's kind of what the chai-coms do.
[3:26:12.600 --> 3:26:14.880]  But we're not gonna do the evil things the globalists do.
[3:26:14.880 --> 3:26:16.240]  I'm just like, hey, you got an emu?
[3:26:16.240 --> 3:26:17.520]  I got a llama, okay?
[3:26:18.400 --> 3:26:20.800]  And you just have to know what the,
[3:26:20.800 --> 3:26:22.200]  you know, not just the enemies.
[3:26:22.200 --> 3:26:24.560]  You've got some allies that are sometimes enemies.
[3:26:24.560 --> 3:26:28.040]  You've got some people who will be future enemies.
[3:26:28.040 --> 3:26:31.080]  And you have to understand what everybody is using
[3:26:31.080 --> 3:26:32.840]  in their armory.
[3:26:32.840 --> 3:26:35.880]  What do we have a baby elephant in here?
[3:26:35.880 --> 3:26:38.880]  And if people don't buy products, we electrocute it.
[3:26:38.880 --> 3:26:41.080]  When the, going back to China.
[3:26:41.080 --> 3:26:42.720]  That's a joke, folks.
[3:26:42.720 --> 3:26:45.640]  Yeah, when the first Japanese or when the first Europeans
[3:26:45.640 --> 3:26:48.680]  arrived in Japan or China, they'd never seen a cannon.
[3:26:48.680 --> 3:26:52.080]  They invented gunpowder, but they'd never seen a cannon.
[3:26:52.080 --> 3:26:54.720]  And it gave the West a huge advantage for a long time
[3:26:54.720 --> 3:26:56.280]  till they figured out cannons,
[3:26:56.280 --> 3:26:58.240]  learned how to build artillery.
[3:26:59.160 --> 3:27:01.960]  You always need to know what your adversaries,
[3:27:01.960 --> 3:27:04.040]  and I'm not just talking about other nations,
[3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:07.320]  but, you know, but the cultural Marxists
[3:27:07.320 --> 3:27:08.920]  that are in academia.
[3:27:08.920 --> 3:27:11.280]  Oh yeah, the video games and phones have made kids now
[3:27:11.280 --> 3:27:12.760]  where they don't have any personal skills.
[3:27:12.760 --> 3:27:14.600]  So now they're going to have apps that teach kids
[3:27:14.600 --> 3:27:16.960]  personal skills from a robot.
[3:27:16.960 --> 3:27:18.600]  So it's just, we're losing our humanity.
[3:27:18.600 --> 3:27:19.760]  We need to get back to it.
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:21.760]  And it starts with llamas running around.
[3:27:21.760 --> 3:27:23.800]  These are much more important weapons
[3:27:23.800 --> 3:27:26.760]  than maybe cannons and F-35 jets.
[3:27:26.760 --> 3:27:29.760]  Because who needs to worry about ballistic missiles
[3:27:29.760 --> 3:27:34.760]  and cannons or jets if you've got your own people
[3:27:35.200 --> 3:27:37.360]  programmed to hate themselves.
[3:27:37.360 --> 3:27:38.680]  Exactly, that's what they're doing.
[3:27:38.680 --> 3:27:40.440]  They're not wanting to create a new generation.
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:42.240]  Well, you mess with the lion, you get bit,
[3:27:42.240 --> 3:27:44.240]  you mess with the llama, you get spit.
[3:27:46.280 --> 3:27:48.280]  No llamas here, but they were cute.
[3:27:48.280 --> 3:27:49.440]  I thought it was a green screen.
[3:27:49.440 --> 3:27:51.760]  I was trying to figure out how that was being done
[3:27:51.760 --> 3:27:54.320]  until I figured out that there really were llamas there.
[3:27:54.320 --> 3:27:57.160]  Nope, and again, what's the name of the website?
[3:27:57.160 --> 3:28:02.160]  Leslie Lane Llamas.com.
[3:28:02.520 --> 3:28:04.600]  Leslie Lane.
[3:28:04.600 --> 3:28:08.560]  That was like a very nice road, Leslie Lane.
[3:28:09.400 --> 3:28:11.560]  There, is that you right there with the llama?
[3:28:18.960 --> 3:28:22.640]  Well, and so does your daughter come visiting too
[3:28:22.640 --> 3:28:23.840]  when the llamas drop by?
[3:28:23.840 --> 3:28:26.080]  She helps, she's very lovely.
[3:28:26.080 --> 3:28:28.280]  Is there any men out there who aren't married?
[3:28:28.280 --> 3:28:29.480]  Or is your daughter married?
[3:28:31.320 --> 3:28:35.320]  Okay, well, you know, that's a tip to humor.
[3:28:35.320 --> 3:28:38.720]  I'm not actually doing that.
[3:28:38.720 --> 3:28:40.200]  Matt Bracken's here.
[3:28:40.200 --> 3:28:42.200]  We gotta say bye-bye llamas.
[3:28:42.200 --> 3:28:43.440]  Say bye-bye, Matt.
[3:28:44.680 --> 3:28:47.440]  Spartan Navy SEAL training, say bye-bye llama.
[3:28:47.440 --> 3:28:48.880]  That's a code word.
[3:28:48.880 --> 3:28:52.040]  Okay, and that's why we're introducing
[3:28:52.040 --> 3:28:54.760]  what we know is gonna be a massive best-seller,
[3:28:54.760 --> 3:28:55.840]  Killforce.
[3:28:55.840 --> 3:28:58.200]  Now let's look at what's in this powerful formula.
[3:28:58.200 --> 3:29:00.440]  Ashwagandha root extract,
[3:29:00.440 --> 3:29:03.440]  an ancient medicinal herb used for over 3,000 years
[3:29:03.440 --> 3:29:05.480]  to treat stress and relax the patient.
[3:29:05.480 --> 3:29:08.640]  L-theony, a special amino acid naturally found
[3:29:08.640 --> 3:29:09.840]  in some tea leaves.
[3:29:09.840 --> 3:29:12.440]  The compound has been called the stress killer
[3:29:12.440 --> 3:29:14.880]  because of its powerful relaxation benefits.
[3:29:14.880 --> 3:29:17.160]  Gabba, an important neurotransmitter
[3:29:17.160 --> 3:29:19.240]  that controls functions of the body and mind,
[3:29:19.240 --> 3:29:21.240]  including nervous system relaxation,
[3:29:21.240 --> 3:29:24.360]  Gabba is a choice for many to help reduce anxiety.
[3:29:24.360 --> 3:29:27.200]  Rodeola rosea root extract
[3:29:27.200 --> 3:29:29.760]  found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.
[3:29:29.760 --> 3:29:32.560]  This root is considered a super adaptogen
[3:29:32.560 --> 3:29:34.240]  and is believed to help the body in the fight
[3:29:34.240 --> 3:29:37.560]  against emotional, mental, and physical stress.
[3:29:37.560 --> 3:29:39.440]  It's time to do what I did and take action
[3:29:39.440 --> 3:29:42.760]  with the Killforce Challenge at InfowarsLive.com.
[3:29:42.760 --> 3:29:55.760]  You know I'm angry because I'm not just gonna sit here
[3:29:55.760 --> 3:29:57.760]  and take this scientific dictatorship
[3:29:57.760 --> 3:30:00.760]  that admits it's putting cancer viruses in the vaccines,
[3:30:00.760 --> 3:30:02.760]  it's putting fluorine in the water to brain damages,
[3:30:02.760 --> 3:30:05.760]  and that it's trying to literally destroy our families
[3:30:05.760 --> 3:30:08.760]  and organize us into a bunch of dumbed-down slaves
[3:30:08.760 --> 3:30:11.760]  so they can then carry out or orderly extermination.
[3:30:11.760 --> 3:30:13.760]  I'm not putting up with it, and our information,
[3:30:13.760 --> 3:30:17.760]  our truth is devastating to these scumbag Satanists

[3:31:48.760 --> 3:31:51.760]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[3:31:51.760 --> 3:31:54.760]  Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish.
[3:31:54.760 --> 3:31:56.760]  They think the West is dead.
[3:31:56.760 --> 3:31:58.760]  They think if they censor nationalists and patriots
[3:31:58.760 --> 3:32:00.760]  off the internet, you'll just forget about us,
[3:32:00.760 --> 3:32:02.760]  and then they'll be the only information out there.
[3:32:02.760 --> 3:32:04.760]  Well, so far, that's not been working too well for them.
[3:32:04.760 --> 3:32:07.760]  Thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly
[3:32:07.760 --> 3:32:09.760]  that the resistance to globalism is alive and well
[3:32:09.760 --> 3:32:13.760]  at band.video, and now we've added a lot of new functions
[3:32:13.760 --> 3:32:15.760]  and a lot of new hosts and contributors to band.video,

[3:32:22.760 --> 3:32:26.760]  on your quote smartphone to put our free app on your device
[3:32:26.760 --> 3:32:29.760]  in defiance of big tech, whether it's Apple or Droid,
[3:32:29.760 --> 3:32:32.760]  you simply click the share button on your phone
[3:32:32.760 --> 3:32:34.760]  and then add to home screen and then there's nothing
[3:32:34.760 --> 3:32:36.760]  the scumbags can do.
[3:32:36.760 --> 3:32:38.760]  The power of America, the power of freedom,
[3:32:38.760 --> 3:32:41.760]  the power to build a better world and stand in the face
[3:32:41.760 --> 3:32:45.760]  of the censors of the tyrants is alive and stronger than ever
[3:32:45.760 --> 3:32:48.760]  at band.video, but it's up to you to unleash
[3:32:48.760 --> 3:32:50.760]  its full potential.
[3:32:50.760 --> 3:33:03.760]  Band.video, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:03.760 --> 3:33:25.760]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[3:33:25.760 --> 3:33:29.760]  Okay, Bracken's here and before I get on with my
[3:33:29.760 --> 3:33:33.760]  prepared script, I want to say something about the sigh-off
[3:33:33.760 --> 3:33:36.760]  that happened in the last half an hour and hour,
[3:33:36.760 --> 3:33:38.760]  last couple segments.
[3:33:38.760 --> 3:33:41.760]  You know, there's something sort of like a
[3:33:41.760 --> 3:33:45.760]  Manchurian candidate experiment going on here
[3:33:45.760 --> 3:33:50.760]  and the code word is Leslie Lane Farm.
[3:33:50.760 --> 3:33:52.760]  See, we were talking about llamas,
[3:33:52.760 --> 3:33:55.760]  but all of this was to inject these three words
[3:33:55.760 --> 3:33:58.760]  into our minds and I'm not sure when this
[3:33:58.760 --> 3:34:04.760]  code will be activated, but Leslie Lane Farm.
[3:34:04.760 --> 3:34:08.760]  Now, number one, Leslie is the name of the first girl
[3:34:08.760 --> 3:34:12.760]  I ever kissed in the sixth grade, no lie.
[3:34:12.760 --> 3:34:17.760]  Lane, Leslie Lane, it's alliterative, it pulls you in.
[3:34:17.760 --> 3:34:20.760]  Farm, that gets all the guys.
[3:34:20.760 --> 3:34:23.760]  Here's a woman, sounds like a beautiful woman,
[3:34:23.760 --> 3:34:27.760]  Leslie Lane, and she has a farm with llamas.
[3:34:27.760 --> 3:34:29.760]  Can't you see?
[3:34:29.760 --> 3:34:31.760]  You've already been hooked.
[3:34:31.760 --> 3:34:35.760]  The seed has been planted and when this is activated,
[3:34:35.760 --> 3:34:38.760]  nobody knows what's going to happen,
[3:34:38.760 --> 3:34:42.760]  but put it in the back of your mind, Leslie Lane Farm.
[3:34:42.760 --> 3:34:46.760]  This was no accident, this was not happenstance.
[3:34:46.760 --> 3:34:49.760]  I'm not a conspiracy theorist and I'm pretty sure
[3:34:49.760 --> 3:34:53.760]  Alex knows what he's doing, but I'm going to be
[3:34:53.760 --> 3:34:57.760]  very on the alert for these future,
[3:34:57.760 --> 3:35:01.760]  the future activation of this code anyway.
[3:35:01.760 --> 3:35:04.760]  Now, what I was going to talk about today
[3:35:04.760 --> 3:35:08.760]  and I am going to talk about, I'm calling the big gaslight.
[3:35:08.760 --> 3:35:12.760]  This is the biggest gaslight in history
[3:35:12.760 --> 3:35:16.760]  and we're seeing the end of an era, really.
[3:35:16.760 --> 3:35:19.760]  To understand this gaslight, you have to go back
[3:35:19.760 --> 3:35:23.760]  at least a century to the beginning of modern mass media.
[3:35:23.760 --> 3:35:29.760]  This is when there was the Pulitzer Yellow Journalism,
[3:35:29.760 --> 3:35:34.760]  the Cuba war, the Spanish-American war,
[3:35:34.760 --> 3:35:38.760]  that was based on the false premise that the Maine
[3:35:38.760 --> 3:35:42.760]  had been somehow sabotaged by Cuban frogmen somehow
[3:35:42.760 --> 3:35:44.760]  and blew up on its own.
[3:35:44.760 --> 3:35:46.760]  Remember the Maine became the battle cry
[3:35:46.760 --> 3:35:48.760]  to get America into a war.
[3:35:48.760 --> 3:35:50.760]  That's more than a century ago.
[3:35:50.760 --> 3:35:54.760]  That's like 130 years ago, 120 years ago.
[3:35:54.760 --> 3:35:57.760]  And the media has basically had us wrapped around
[3:35:57.760 --> 3:36:00.760]  their finger ever since then.
[3:36:00.760 --> 3:36:04.760]  In the 1920s and 30s, there were American
[3:36:04.760 --> 3:36:08.760]  and other journalists that were basically
[3:36:08.760 --> 3:36:11.760]  communist sympathizers, if not out-and-out communists,
[3:36:11.760 --> 3:36:14.760]  who went over to the Soviet Union
[3:36:14.760 --> 3:36:18.760]  and they acted as complete lackeys for Stalin,
[3:36:18.760 --> 3:36:20.760]  for Lenin, for Stalin, for the communists.
[3:36:20.760 --> 3:36:24.760]  A New York Times reporter named Walter Duranty,
[3:36:24.760 --> 3:36:27.760]  he won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932
[3:36:27.760 --> 3:36:30.760]  by telling lies about the Soviet Union,
[3:36:30.760 --> 3:36:34.760]  that things were great, that this hunger going on
[3:36:34.760 --> 3:36:37.760]  in parts of what they called all of...
[3:36:37.760 --> 3:36:39.760]  The Ukraine then was just part of Russia.
[3:36:39.760 --> 3:36:42.760]  So when they said there was no Russian famine,
[3:36:42.760 --> 3:36:45.760]  they were talking about Ukraine.
[3:36:45.760 --> 3:36:48.760]  This was an American New York Times reporter.
[3:36:48.760 --> 3:36:51.760]  He won the Pulitzer Prize for covering
[3:36:51.760 --> 3:36:53.760]  for a mass genocide.
[3:36:53.760 --> 3:36:57.760]  Millions of people murdered by Stalin.
[3:36:57.760 --> 3:37:00.760]  The guy even in this article that you see put up here,
[3:37:00.760 --> 3:37:02.760]  if you ever look it up, he talks about how
[3:37:02.760 --> 3:37:04.760]  the Bolsheviks have to break a lot of eggs
[3:37:04.760 --> 3:37:08.760]  to make the revolution, just like a general in a war.
[3:37:08.760 --> 3:37:11.760]  Sometimes you gotta push a few thousand people out there
[3:37:11.760 --> 3:37:13.760]  where the general knows they'll be killed.
[3:37:13.760 --> 3:37:17.760]  That's Duranty excusing genocide and mass murder
[3:37:17.760 --> 3:37:22.760]  for the creation of socialism in Russia at the time.
[3:37:22.760 --> 3:37:24.760]  All the way through the 20th century,
[3:37:24.760 --> 3:37:27.760]  it pretty much stayed the same.
[3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:30.760]  When I was a young man, Walter Cronkite
[3:37:30.760 --> 3:37:37.760]  was the elder statesman-like anchor of CBS News.
[3:37:37.760 --> 3:37:41.760]  He was, by far, the most dominant, most trusted,
[3:37:41.760 --> 3:37:46.760]  he was called the most trusted man in America, Walter Cronkite.
[3:37:46.760 --> 3:37:49.760]  It didn't come out until years after he retired
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:53.760]  that all along he had been a leader of what was called
[3:37:53.760 --> 3:37:58.760]  the World Federalist Society, a globalist organization.
[3:37:58.760 --> 3:38:01.760]  Everything he had been doing from World War II
[3:38:01.760 --> 3:38:05.760]  through his retirement was to denigrate
[3:38:05.760 --> 3:38:08.760]  the concept of national sovereignty
[3:38:08.760 --> 3:38:10.760]  and build world government.
[3:38:10.760 --> 3:38:13.760]  That's why in 1968, when the Ted Offensive happened
[3:38:13.760 --> 3:38:16.760]  in the beginning in January of 68,
[3:38:16.760 --> 3:38:19.760]  Walter Cronkite called it a huge defeat.
[3:38:19.760 --> 3:38:21.760]  We can't win in Vietnam.
[3:38:21.760 --> 3:38:25.760]  He was working against America for globalism.
[3:38:25.760 --> 3:38:27.760]  This has continued all the way through.
[3:38:27.760 --> 3:38:30.760]  During the Vietnam War, if you've ever heard the saying,
[3:38:30.760 --> 3:38:34.760]  we had to destroy the village to save it.
[3:38:34.760 --> 3:38:37.760]  This was a CNN reporter named Peter Arnett.
[3:38:37.760 --> 3:38:40.760]  He was AP then, CNN later.
[3:38:40.760 --> 3:38:44.760]  Peter Arnett completely made it up, but it was believed
[3:38:44.760 --> 3:38:46.760]  we're such butchers, we're such maniacs,
[3:38:46.760 --> 3:38:49.760]  we'll actually destroy a village to save it.
[3:38:49.760 --> 3:38:53.760]  I mean, a trusted newsman said so.
[3:38:53.760 --> 3:38:57.760]  All of his sources were made up, like Mike Adams said last hour.
[3:38:57.760 --> 3:39:01.760]  They'll just invent a source, invent it,
[3:39:01.760 --> 3:39:03.760]  and then say, well, it'll be too dangerous
[3:39:03.760 --> 3:39:05.760]  to actually explain who it is.
[3:39:05.760 --> 3:39:07.760]  But people went back and looked into Arnett's story.
[3:39:07.760 --> 3:39:10.760]  It was completely invented.
[3:39:10.760 --> 3:39:14.760]  Cronkite talking about Ted being a loss.
[3:39:14.760 --> 3:39:17.760]  Arnett, we had to destroy the village to save it.
[3:39:17.760 --> 3:39:21.760]  These were the memes that brainwashed
[3:39:21.760 --> 3:39:24.760]  a generation of Americans into thinking,
[3:39:24.760 --> 3:39:27.760]  well, the military, they're just out of control maniacs.
[3:39:27.760 --> 3:39:30.760]  It's one MyLy massacre after another.
[3:39:30.760 --> 3:39:33.760]  This is extremely influential.
[3:39:33.760 --> 3:39:40.760]  This lasted all the way through to George Bush II
[3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:42.760]  with what was called MemoGate.
[3:39:42.760 --> 3:39:46.760]  That's when Dan Rather tried to pull out the same old play.
[3:39:46.760 --> 3:39:51.760]  We're going to invent a memo saying that George Bush
[3:39:51.760 --> 3:39:54.760]  was a draft dodging slacker,
[3:39:54.760 --> 3:39:57.760]  and we'll just insert it into the campaign.
[3:39:57.760 --> 3:40:01.760]  But by that time, in the 1990s,
[3:40:01.760 --> 3:40:04.760]  it was too late for the mainstream media.
[3:40:04.760 --> 3:40:08.760]  They didn't have a complete seal on the message anymore.
[3:40:08.760 --> 3:40:11.760]  There were independent journalists out there
[3:40:11.760 --> 3:40:15.760]  beginning to sneak in and become very important.
[3:40:15.760 --> 3:40:19.760]  I remember this would be early 2000s.
[3:40:19.760 --> 3:40:23.760]  This is when the MemoGate came out,
[3:40:23.760 --> 3:40:25.760]  and people on the Internet right away realized,
[3:40:25.760 --> 3:40:29.760]  wait a minute, how could that memo be legit?
[3:40:29.760 --> 3:40:35.760]  It's made on Microsoft Word with proportional font spacing.
[3:40:35.760 --> 3:40:38.760]  That was impossible on a typewriter
[3:40:38.760 --> 3:40:41.760]  at the time that the memo was supposed to be written.
[3:40:41.760 --> 3:40:43.760]  That's when the mainstream media
[3:40:43.760 --> 3:40:46.760]  started to show cracks in the edifice.
[3:40:46.760 --> 3:40:49.760]  Dan Rather retired or fired in disgrace.
[3:40:49.760 --> 3:40:51.760]  They still try to bring him out.
[3:40:51.760 --> 3:40:54.760]  He's got some off-brand show,
[3:40:54.760 --> 3:40:56.760]  but he's known as a disgrace.
[3:40:56.760 --> 3:40:59.760]  Only the most hardcore lefties would watch Dan Rather.
[3:40:59.760 --> 3:41:03.760]  So Dan Rather was the heir to Walter Cronkite,
[3:41:03.760 --> 3:41:07.760]  and truthful alternative media, new media,
[3:41:07.760 --> 3:41:10.760]  took him down and wiped him out.
[3:41:10.760 --> 3:41:13.760]  Now, today, Donald Trump,
[3:41:13.760 --> 3:41:17.760]  he is like a nuclear weapon of change.
[3:41:17.760 --> 3:41:19.760]  He has been watching this just like I have,
[3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:20.760]  just like you have.
[3:41:20.760 --> 3:41:24.760]  Trump has been observing all of this for the last 30, 40 years.
[3:41:24.760 --> 3:41:28.760]  He understands that he is a master of media,
[3:41:28.760 --> 3:41:33.760]  and he has figured out how to actually manipulate
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:37.760]  and whipsaw the media for his own end.
[3:41:37.760 --> 3:41:41.760]  And many times, it looks like in chess terms,
[3:41:41.760 --> 3:41:43.760]  it would be like a sacrifice.
[3:41:43.760 --> 3:41:45.760]  It looks like, why would he say that?
[3:41:45.760 --> 3:41:48.760]  Today, he said, I'm asking Ukraine and China
[3:41:48.760 --> 3:41:52.760]  to help look into the Biden corruption scandal.
[3:41:52.760 --> 3:41:53.760]  Why would he say that?
[3:41:53.760 --> 3:41:55.760]  The media is going crazy today.
[3:41:55.760 --> 3:41:59.760]  He's actually asking a communist Chinese government
[3:41:59.760 --> 3:42:02.760]  to help him in the next election.
[3:42:02.760 --> 3:42:03.760]  They don't understand.
[3:42:03.760 --> 3:42:07.760]  He really is, in this case, playing four-dimensional chess,
[3:42:07.760 --> 3:42:09.760]  and he is many steps ahead of them.
[3:42:09.760 --> 3:42:11.760]  And what he is doing is,
[3:42:11.760 --> 3:42:14.760]  he is like the guy with the red laser
[3:42:14.760 --> 3:42:17.760]  making the kittens run after the story.
[3:42:17.760 --> 3:42:23.760]  He is playing a laser tag with the mainstream media kittens.
[3:42:23.760 --> 3:42:27.760]  He is actually driving them exactly where he wants them.
[3:42:27.760 --> 3:42:29.760]  He understands what he's doing.
[3:42:29.760 --> 3:42:33.760]  And in the next segment, I'm going to explore this further,
[3:42:33.760 --> 3:42:37.760]  and how important this is that this entire century
[3:42:37.760 --> 3:42:43.760]  of mainstream media leftist gaslighting is coming to an end.
[3:42:43.760 --> 3:42:47.760]  And it's going to be Donald Trump that is the change agent
[3:42:47.760 --> 3:42:48.760]  that makes this happen.
[3:42:48.760 --> 3:43:17.760]  Be back in a couple of minutes.
[3:43:18.760 --> 3:43:20.760]  It's all about video.
[3:43:20.760 --> 3:43:22.760]  And I just, you've got to share this with people
[3:43:22.760 --> 3:43:25.760]  because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[3:43:25.760 --> 3:43:26.760]  This was amazing.
[3:43:26.760 --> 3:43:28.760]  And he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[3:43:28.760 --> 3:43:31.760]  So, in full wars, America, Trump, all of us,
[3:43:31.760 --> 3:43:33.760]  incredible things are happening,
[3:43:33.760 --> 3:43:36.760]  and we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants
[3:43:36.760 --> 3:43:38.760]  at band.video.
[3:43:38.760 --> 3:43:41.760]  And I've got to tell you, we've done great video work.
[3:43:41.760 --> 3:43:42.760]  We've done great films.
[3:43:42.760 --> 3:43:44.760]  We've done so much, but websites are not our thing.
[3:43:44.760 --> 3:43:45.760]  Well, now they are.
[3:43:45.760 --> 3:43:47.760]  I'm so proud of band.video, folks.
[3:43:47.760 --> 3:43:48.760]  Check it out.
[3:43:48.760 --> 3:44:17.760]  There's a lot of new features band on video.
[3:44:18.760 --> 3:44:20.760]  And it's happening all over the world.
[3:44:20.760 --> 3:44:22.760]  So, great things are happening,
[3:44:22.760 --> 3:44:24.760]  but the enemy is striking back.
[3:44:24.760 --> 3:44:26.760]  They're very serious with this impeachment plan.
[3:44:26.760 --> 3:44:28.760]  It has bipartisan support,
[3:44:28.760 --> 3:44:31.760]  and I'm telling you, President Trump needs our prayers,
[3:44:31.760 --> 3:44:34.760]  and in full wars, needs your prayers and support.
[3:44:34.760 --> 3:44:37.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globe was trying to shut us down.
[3:44:37.760 --> 3:44:39.760]  But right now it's easier than ever to financially support us
[3:44:39.760 --> 3:44:41.760]  while getting great products at the same time.
[3:44:41.760 --> 3:44:43.760]  With Black Friday comes two months early
[3:44:43.760 --> 3:44:46.760]  with store-wide free shipping, double patriot points,
[3:44:46.760 --> 3:44:49.760]  and, ladies and gentlemen, 50% off.
[3:44:49.760 --> 3:44:52.760]  The globalist and their Democrat minions
[3:44:52.760 --> 3:44:56.760]  are on the verge of taking this cold civil war hot.
[3:44:56.760 --> 3:44:58.760]  They have pushed and pushed and pushed
[3:44:58.760 --> 3:45:01.760]  and engaged in hoaxes and crimes and censorship
[3:45:01.760 --> 3:45:04.760]  and sabotage of the economy and attacks
[3:45:04.760 --> 3:45:08.760]  run by the UN on the border that are nothing short of war.
[3:45:08.760 --> 3:45:10.760]  And that's because it is a war
[3:45:10.760 --> 3:45:12.760]  by multinational corporations,
[3:45:12.760 --> 3:45:16.760]  allied with the Chai comms and others, with the Hollywood,
[3:45:16.760 --> 3:45:18.760]  America-hating, God-hating filth
[3:45:18.760 --> 3:45:20.760]  to try to capture the United States.
[3:45:20.760 --> 3:45:23.760]  This is 21st century war,
[3:45:23.760 --> 3:45:26.760]  and wars need money to be prosecuted,
[3:45:26.760 --> 3:45:28.760]  and we're actually winning the war,
[3:45:28.760 --> 3:45:30.760]  but the enemy's throwing their full weight at us right now.
[3:45:30.760 --> 3:45:32.760]  That's why we need financial support.
[3:45:32.760 --> 3:45:34.760]  It's a total 360 win, double patriot points,
[3:45:34.760 --> 3:45:36.760]  50% off, store-wide free shipping.
[3:45:36.760 --> 3:45:37.760]  It's about to end
[3:45:37.760 --> 3:45:39.760]  because we're running out of a lot of these products
[3:45:39.760 --> 3:45:40.760]  at infowarsstore.com,
[3:45:40.760 --> 3:45:42.760]  but I need you to get in there,
[3:45:42.760 --> 3:45:43.760]  step to the plate,
[3:45:43.760 --> 3:45:45.760]  get high-quality products you already need
[3:45:45.760 --> 3:45:47.760]  and fund the Information War.
[3:45:47.760 --> 3:45:49.760]  Infowarsstore.com.
[3:45:51.760 --> 3:45:54.760]  Globalism was doomed to fail
[3:45:54.760 --> 3:45:57.760]  if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[3:45:57.760 --> 3:45:59.760]  Didn't I say a thousand times
[3:45:59.760 --> 3:46:01.760]  that there's no way you're going to have
[3:46:01.760 --> 3:46:03.760]  an authoritarian corporate world government above the law
[3:46:03.760 --> 3:46:04.760]  that doesn't pay taxes,
[3:46:04.760 --> 3:46:06.760]  that has diplomatic immunity,
[3:46:06.760 --> 3:46:08.760]  that runs around saying it's communist and socialist,
[3:46:08.760 --> 3:46:10.760]  power to the people,
[3:46:10.760 --> 3:46:12.760]  but then meanwhile, his tax exempt began offshore.
[3:46:12.760 --> 3:46:14.760]  Well, Trump got that,
[3:46:14.760 --> 3:46:16.760]  and all these other populists get it.
[3:46:16.760 --> 3:46:18.760]  Why would you throw away wealthy, successful
[3:46:18.760 --> 3:46:19.760]  countries and cultures
[3:46:19.760 --> 3:46:21.760]  just so you could say the communist, Chinese,
[3:46:21.760 --> 3:46:23.760]  the David Rockefeller put in power
[3:46:23.760 --> 3:46:25.760]  are better than everybody?
[3:46:25.760 --> 3:46:27.760]  That is a sick, freakish joke.
[3:46:27.760 --> 3:46:29.760]  And I will not stand by
[3:46:29.760 --> 3:46:31.760]  and watch humanity turn over to these people,
[3:46:31.760 --> 3:46:33.760]  and I beg God for the strength
[3:46:33.760 --> 3:46:35.760]  and the will to have the discernment
[3:46:35.760 --> 3:46:38.760]  to help be part of their defeat.
[3:46:38.760 --> 3:46:40.760]  And I've been saying that prayer for 20-plus years,
[3:46:40.760 --> 3:46:43.760]  and God is delivering because God is great.
[3:46:43.760 --> 3:46:45.760]  Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ.
[3:46:45.760 --> 3:46:47.760]  And now let's move forward
[3:46:47.760 --> 3:46:49.760]  against the NW.
[3:46:49.760 --> 3:46:51.760]  Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
[3:46:51.760 --> 3:47:03.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:03.760 --> 3:47:24.760]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[3:47:24.760 --> 3:47:26.760]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:26.760 --> 3:47:29.760]  And now your host, Matt Bracken.
[3:47:29.760 --> 3:47:32.760]  Okay. Before I get back to my story
[3:47:32.760 --> 3:47:34.760]  a couple of quick things.
[3:47:34.760 --> 3:47:36.760]  It just jumped out at me as headlines.
[3:47:36.760 --> 3:47:38.760]  The Paris knife attack
[3:47:38.760 --> 3:47:40.760]  is notable to me for two reasons.
[3:47:40.760 --> 3:47:42.760]  Number one, it turns out,
[3:47:42.760 --> 3:47:44.760]  oh boy, can you imagine?
[3:47:44.760 --> 3:47:46.760]  He was an Islamic convert.
[3:47:46.760 --> 3:47:48.760]  Go figure.
[3:47:48.760 --> 3:47:50.760]  So what's the common thread with people
[3:47:50.760 --> 3:47:52.760]  going running amok with, you know,
[3:47:52.760 --> 3:47:54.760]  murdering people?
[3:47:54.760 --> 3:47:56.760]  Islamic convert. Okay.
[3:47:56.760 --> 3:47:58.760]  There might be something there.
[3:47:58.760 --> 3:48:00.760]  Another thing is that in my
[3:48:00.760 --> 3:48:02.760]  third novel, Foreign Enemies and Traders,
[3:48:02.760 --> 3:48:04.760]  the good guys sneak a ceramic knife
[3:48:04.760 --> 3:48:06.760]  right into Camp David for a mission
[3:48:06.760 --> 3:48:08.760]  because it's going to get past
[3:48:08.760 --> 3:48:10.760]  every kind of a scanner.
[3:48:10.760 --> 3:48:12.760]  Now, if you're looking at a ceramic knife,
[3:48:12.760 --> 3:48:14.760]  they actually have to stick some metal
[3:48:14.760 --> 3:48:16.760]  in the handle part.
[3:48:16.760 --> 3:48:18.760]  That's about as far as I'll go there.
[3:48:18.760 --> 3:48:20.760]  Anyway, ceramic blades.
[3:48:20.760 --> 3:48:22.760]  Very, very sharp, as you know.
[3:48:22.760 --> 3:48:24.760]  Now, back to the media
[3:48:24.760 --> 3:48:26.760]  and how Trump is
[3:48:26.760 --> 3:48:28.760]  literally taking them apart
[3:48:28.760 --> 3:48:30.760]  block by block.
[3:48:30.760 --> 3:48:32.760]  And they are too stupid,
[3:48:32.760 --> 3:48:34.760]  too unaware to even realize it yet.
[3:48:34.760 --> 3:48:36.760]  Today,
[3:48:36.760 --> 3:48:38.760]  right to the reporters,
[3:48:38.760 --> 3:48:40.760]  he said, I'm asking China
[3:48:40.760 --> 3:48:42.760]  also to look into it.
[3:48:42.760 --> 3:48:44.760]  You could just see the liberals
[3:48:44.760 --> 3:48:46.760]  tearing their hair out.
[3:48:46.760 --> 3:48:48.760]  Oh my God, this is like a triple impeachment.
[3:48:48.760 --> 3:48:50.760]  We're going to go after him now.
[3:48:50.760 --> 3:48:52.760]  They do not understand
[3:48:52.760 --> 3:48:54.760]  that he is leading them
[3:48:54.760 --> 3:48:56.760]  like a dance partner
[3:48:56.760 --> 3:48:58.760]  or in a sailboat race.
[3:48:58.760 --> 3:49:00.760]  Sometimes what happens
[3:49:00.760 --> 3:49:02.760]  is what's called a tacking duel.
[3:49:02.760 --> 3:49:04.760]  If one boat is going to turn,
[3:49:04.760 --> 3:49:06.760]  the other one may just say,
[3:49:06.760 --> 3:49:08.760]  I think I'm better off on this
[3:49:08.760 --> 3:49:10.760]  laying this same heading,
[3:49:10.760 --> 3:49:12.760]  but I can't. I've got to cover that tack.
[3:49:12.760 --> 3:49:14.760]  And what Trump is doing
[3:49:14.760 --> 3:49:16.760]  is forcing the media
[3:49:16.760 --> 3:49:18.760]  to cover his tax,
[3:49:18.760 --> 3:49:20.760]  and he is taking them
[3:49:20.760 --> 3:49:22.760]  right to the reef where he's going
[3:49:22.760 --> 3:49:24.760]  to run them aground.
[3:49:24.760 --> 3:49:28.760]  This is actually a really brilliant strategy.
[3:49:28.760 --> 3:49:30.760]  And what he is doing
[3:49:30.760 --> 3:49:32.760]  is he is
[3:49:32.760 --> 3:49:34.760]  exposing to
[3:49:34.760 --> 3:49:36.760]  the part of America
[3:49:36.760 --> 3:49:38.760]  that is not watching
[3:49:38.760 --> 3:49:40.760]  infowars, that doesn't watch
[3:49:40.760 --> 3:49:42.760]  conservative media or conservative
[3:49:42.760 --> 3:49:44.760]  internet websites,
[3:49:44.760 --> 3:49:46.760]  people that have never heard
[3:49:46.760 --> 3:49:48.760]  that the Bidens were ever involved
[3:49:48.760 --> 3:49:50.760]  in anything, because if you're in
[3:49:50.760 --> 3:49:52.760]  the liberal narrative bubble,
[3:49:52.760 --> 3:49:54.760]  you would have never heard any of this.
[3:49:54.760 --> 3:49:56.760]  So he is
[3:49:56.760 --> 3:49:58.760]  throwing out there
[3:49:58.760 --> 3:50:00.760]  this Biden corruption, which actually
[3:50:00.760 --> 3:50:02.760]  goes back to the first
[3:50:02.760 --> 3:50:04.760]  years of Biden being in Congress,
[3:50:04.760 --> 3:50:06.760]  where he has used
[3:50:06.760 --> 3:50:08.760]  his position to enrich
[3:50:08.760 --> 3:50:10.760]  his family. And this has just
[3:50:10.760 --> 3:50:12.760]  been continuous.
[3:50:12.760 --> 3:50:14.760]  And what he
[3:50:14.760 --> 3:50:16.760]  is doing with the media, it sounds
[3:50:16.760 --> 3:50:18.760]  like, oh, he's actually incriminating
[3:50:18.760 --> 3:50:20.760]  himself. He's putting more charges
[3:50:20.760 --> 3:50:22.760]  for the impeachment inquiry
[3:50:22.760 --> 3:50:24.760]  onto himself. That's not it at all.
[3:50:24.760 --> 3:50:26.760]  He's forcing
[3:50:26.760 --> 3:50:28.760]  them to cover his tax.
[3:50:28.760 --> 3:50:30.760]  And he is leading them
[3:50:30.760 --> 3:50:32.760]  like a dance partner, straight
[3:50:32.760 --> 3:50:34.760]  to where he wants them. So
[3:50:34.760 --> 3:50:36.760]  instead of just the conservative
[3:50:36.760 --> 3:50:38.760]  libertarian corner
[3:50:38.760 --> 3:50:40.760]  that already knows about these things,
[3:50:40.760 --> 3:50:42.760]  I mean, let's go back
[3:50:42.760 --> 3:50:44.760]  a couple of scandals, Fast
[3:50:44.760 --> 3:50:46.760]  and Furious, Benghazi,
[3:50:46.760 --> 3:50:48.760]  we knew all about it.
[3:50:48.760 --> 3:50:50.760]  All right, we understood
[3:50:50.760 --> 3:50:52.760]  the intricacies of it.
[3:50:52.760 --> 3:50:54.760]  But the middle of America, the people
[3:50:54.760 --> 3:50:56.760]  that are just casual news
[3:50:56.760 --> 3:50:58.760]  absorbers, they never heard a word
[3:50:58.760 --> 3:51:00.760]  of it. What Trump is doing
[3:51:00.760 --> 3:51:02.760]  is taking the mainstream media
[3:51:02.760 --> 3:51:04.760]  and shoving their face over
[3:51:04.760 --> 3:51:06.760]  there, and they're going to chase
[3:51:06.760 --> 3:51:08.760]  that story. And as
[3:51:08.760 --> 3:51:10.760]  a result, tens
[3:51:10.760 --> 3:51:12.760]  of millions of Americans
[3:51:12.760 --> 3:51:14.760]  that have no idea about
[3:51:14.760 --> 3:51:16.760]  Biden corruption are going to
[3:51:16.760 --> 3:51:18.760]  come about it. So right now,
[3:51:18.760 --> 3:51:20.760]  Biden is a dead man walking.
[3:51:20.760 --> 3:51:22.760]  He doesn't know it.
[3:51:22.760 --> 3:51:24.760]  Sanders is still in the hospital.
[3:51:24.760 --> 3:51:26.760]  I don't think he'll ever, he won't
[3:51:26.760 --> 3:51:28.760]  be back up to speed.
[3:51:28.760 --> 3:51:30.760]  And his voters are going
[3:51:30.760 --> 3:51:32.760]  to Warren.
[3:51:32.760 --> 3:51:34.760]  Warren is going to be the nominee.
[3:51:34.760 --> 3:51:36.760]  Unless something happens, Deus Ex Machina,
[3:51:36.760 --> 3:51:38.760]  I don't think Hillary
[3:51:38.760 --> 3:51:40.760]  has a prayer of just jumping
[3:51:40.760 --> 3:51:42.760]  into the race, like I'm your savior.
[3:51:42.760 --> 3:51:44.760]  You know, she's like a, that would make
[3:51:44.760 --> 3:51:46.760]  a lifetime loser.
[3:51:46.760 --> 3:51:48.760]  It's going to be Elizabeth
[3:51:48.760 --> 3:51:50.760]  Warren versus Donald Trump, and he
[3:51:50.760 --> 3:51:52.760]  is going to eat her lunch
[3:51:52.760 --> 3:51:54.760]  as a communist.
[3:51:54.760 --> 3:51:56.760]  You know, it's going to be
[3:51:56.760 --> 3:51:58.760]  free market enterprise system,
[3:51:58.760 --> 3:52:00.760]  freedom versus socialism,
[3:52:00.760 --> 3:52:02.760]  communism and tyranny.
[3:52:02.760 --> 3:52:04.760]  And he is going to eat
[3:52:04.760 --> 3:52:06.760]  her lunch.
[3:52:06.760 --> 3:52:08.760]  I'm telling you this. So why is the
[3:52:08.760 --> 3:52:10.760]  entire impeachment thing happening
[3:52:10.760 --> 3:52:12.760]  right now? It's because
[3:52:12.760 --> 3:52:14.760]  Trump is in a total panic
[3:52:14.760 --> 3:52:16.760]  over
[3:52:16.760 --> 3:52:18.760]  Barr and Durham going to
[3:52:18.760 --> 3:52:20.760]  Italy and making overtures
[3:52:20.760 --> 3:52:22.760]  to Australia.
[3:52:22.760 --> 3:52:24.760]  Remember, Italy
[3:52:24.760 --> 3:52:26.760]  has had a populist uprising. Now
[3:52:26.760 --> 3:52:28.760]  Salvini is out temporarily, but that
[3:52:28.760 --> 3:52:30.760]  doesn't mean that the security
[3:52:30.760 --> 3:52:32.760]  apparatus within Italy also
[3:52:32.760 --> 3:52:34.760]  turned leftward immediately.
[3:52:34.760 --> 3:52:36.760]  Barr
[3:52:36.760 --> 3:52:38.760]  and Durham went to Italy.
[3:52:38.760 --> 3:52:40.760]  They went to the American embassy
[3:52:40.760 --> 3:52:42.760]  to a quiet
[3:52:42.760 --> 3:52:44.760]  room, to a bug proof room
[3:52:44.760 --> 3:52:46.760]  where they could listen to Joseph
[3:52:46.760 --> 3:52:48.760]  Mifsud's testimony.
[3:52:48.760 --> 3:52:50.760]  Joseph Mifsud is
[3:52:50.760 --> 3:52:52.760]  the agent zero
[3:52:52.760 --> 3:52:54.760]  of the Russian collusion hoax.
[3:52:54.760 --> 3:52:56.760]  He's the one who
[3:52:56.760 --> 3:52:58.760]  allegedly fed
[3:52:58.760 --> 3:53:00.760]  Papadopoulos the rumors about the
[3:53:00.760 --> 3:53:02.760]  WikiLeaks and then
[3:53:02.760 --> 3:53:04.760]  Australian ambassador
[3:53:04.760 --> 3:53:06.760]  Downer
[3:53:06.760 --> 3:53:08.760]  supposedly gleaned that information
[3:53:08.760 --> 3:53:10.760]  from Papadopoulos, and that's
[3:53:10.760 --> 3:53:12.760]  the entire reason
[3:53:12.760 --> 3:53:14.760]  for the origin
[3:53:14.760 --> 3:53:16.760]  of the Operation Crossfire Hurricane.
[3:53:16.760 --> 3:53:18.760]  Well,
[3:53:18.760 --> 3:53:20.760]  by now, having heard this deposition,
[3:53:20.760 --> 3:53:22.760]  this was Mifsud's
[3:53:22.760 --> 3:53:24.760]  dead man switch deposition.
[3:53:24.760 --> 3:53:26.760]  I don't even know if Mifsud is still alive
[3:53:26.760 --> 3:53:28.760]  or if maybe they interviewed
[3:53:28.760 --> 3:53:30.760]  him and they managed to keep
[3:53:30.760 --> 3:53:32.760]  security over that, but for sure
[3:53:32.760 --> 3:53:34.760]  they listened to Mifsud's
[3:53:34.760 --> 3:53:36.760]  dead man switch
[3:53:36.760 --> 3:53:38.760]  deposition where
[3:53:38.760 --> 3:53:40.760]  he's basically
[3:53:40.760 --> 3:53:42.760]  going to say, if anything bad happens to me
[3:53:42.760 --> 3:53:44.760]  if I disappear, this is what really went down.
[3:53:44.760 --> 3:53:46.760]  Mifsud was a
[3:53:46.760 --> 3:53:48.760]  CIA operative
[3:53:48.760 --> 3:53:50.760]  controlled by Western intelligence agencies
[3:53:50.760 --> 3:53:52.760]  just like Stefan Halper
[3:53:52.760 --> 3:53:54.760]  and Alexander Downer.
[3:53:54.760 --> 3:53:56.760]  John Brennan and his click
[3:53:56.760 --> 3:53:58.760]  have been
[3:53:58.760 --> 3:54:00.760]  pulling the strings
[3:54:00.760 --> 3:54:02.760]  behind this entire thing.
[3:54:02.760 --> 3:54:04.760]  Supposedly, for
[3:54:04.760 --> 3:54:06.760]  what it's worth, if you can believe the sources,
[3:54:06.760 --> 3:54:08.760]  some of them are kind of shaky, Brennan
[3:54:08.760 --> 3:54:10.760]  is going to be deposed
[3:54:10.760 --> 3:54:12.760]  by Durham.
[3:54:12.760 --> 3:54:14.760]  And this is very serious.
[3:54:14.760 --> 3:54:16.760]  People can go to jail.
[3:54:16.760 --> 3:54:18.760]  This is the deep state
[3:54:18.760 --> 3:54:20.760]  facing total ruin.
[3:54:20.760 --> 3:54:22.760]  That's why the impeachment,
[3:54:22.760 --> 3:54:24.760]  this half-baked impeachment thing is coming out.
[3:54:24.760 --> 3:54:26.760]  It's an attempt
[3:54:26.760 --> 3:54:28.760]  to light a backfire
[3:54:28.760 --> 3:54:30.760]  against the giant
[3:54:30.760 --> 3:54:32.760]  firestorm which is coming in the form
[3:54:32.760 --> 3:54:34.760]  of the barred
[3:54:34.760 --> 3:54:36.760]  Durham reports.
[3:54:36.760 --> 3:54:38.760]  What is a backfire?
[3:54:38.760 --> 3:54:40.760]  It's an attempt to start a smaller fire
[3:54:40.760 --> 3:54:42.760]  in front of an
[3:54:42.760 --> 3:54:44.760]  onrushing forest fire
[3:54:44.760 --> 3:54:46.760]  to burn up all the fuel
[3:54:46.760 --> 3:54:48.760]  to take away the fuel
[3:54:48.760 --> 3:54:50.760]  so that there's nothing for the forest fire to consume.
[3:54:50.760 --> 3:54:52.760]  It's a last-ditch
[3:54:52.760 --> 3:54:54.760]  desperate attempt by the deep state.
[3:54:54.760 --> 3:54:56.760]  It's half-baked.
[3:54:56.760 --> 3:54:58.760]  It's lame.
[3:54:58.760 --> 3:55:00.760]  Trump is so unafraid of it
[3:55:00.760 --> 3:55:02.760]  that he went down today and said,
[3:55:02.760 --> 3:55:04.760]  yeah, I'm asking Ukraine and China
[3:55:04.760 --> 3:55:06.760]  to take the media
[3:55:06.760 --> 3:55:08.760]  to take that bait.
[3:55:08.760 --> 3:55:10.760]  You're throwing more attention on it.
[3:55:10.760 --> 3:55:12.760]  And when
[3:55:12.760 --> 3:55:14.760]  the barred Durham reports come down,
[3:55:14.760 --> 3:55:16.760]  that's the only reason those two went to Italy
[3:55:16.760 --> 3:55:18.760]  together,
[3:55:18.760 --> 3:55:20.760]  sitting together
[3:55:20.760 --> 3:55:22.760]  to listen to the Joseph Mifsud
[3:55:22.760 --> 3:55:24.760]  deposition.
[3:55:24.760 --> 3:55:26.760]  If Joseph Mifsud is saying, look,
[3:55:26.760 --> 3:55:28.760]  I got my orders through the CIA
[3:55:28.760 --> 3:55:30.760]  like I have for the last 25 years.
[3:55:30.760 --> 3:55:32.760]  This came
[3:55:32.760 --> 3:55:34.760]  from Langley.
[3:55:34.760 --> 3:55:36.760]  John Brennan was the boss.
[3:55:36.760 --> 3:55:38.760]  I took this as another operation
[3:55:38.760 --> 3:55:40.760]  just like dozens before.
[3:55:40.760 --> 3:55:42.760]  Same thing with Stephen Halper
[3:55:42.760 --> 3:55:44.760]  who's made
[3:55:44.760 --> 3:55:46.760]  one and a half, $2 million
[3:55:46.760 --> 3:55:48.760]  in
[3:55:48.760 --> 3:55:50.760]  Black Defense Department
[3:55:50.760 --> 3:55:52.760]  budget
[3:55:52.760 --> 3:55:54.760]  invoices to give lectures.
[3:55:54.760 --> 3:55:56.760]  I mean, come on. Stephen Halper
[3:55:56.760 --> 3:55:58.760]  and Joseph Mifsud
[3:55:58.760 --> 3:56:00.760]  are CIA
[3:56:00.760 --> 3:56:02.760]  operatives.
[3:56:02.760 --> 3:56:04.760]  They do what they're told, they follow orders.
[3:56:04.760 --> 3:56:06.760]  If those guys
[3:56:06.760 --> 3:56:08.760]  have come out and said,
[3:56:08.760 --> 3:56:10.760]  this was all a deep state operation,
[3:56:10.760 --> 3:56:12.760]  Comey, Brennan, Clapper,
[3:56:12.760 --> 3:56:14.760]  McCabe,
[3:56:14.760 --> 3:56:16.760]  a lot of these guys are going to go to prison.
[3:56:16.760 --> 3:56:18.760]  And that's why the Democrats
[3:56:18.760 --> 3:56:20.760]  are in such a hysteria today.
[3:56:20.760 --> 3:56:22.760]  That's exactly
[3:56:22.760 --> 3:56:24.760]  why this is all going on.
[3:56:24.760 --> 3:56:26.760]  And I think that Trump,
[3:56:26.760 --> 3:56:28.760]  unlike us,
[3:56:28.760 --> 3:56:30.760]  Trump has ultimate security clearances.
[3:56:30.760 --> 3:56:32.760]  He knows what a lot of the down cards
[3:56:32.760 --> 3:56:34.760]  on this poker table are.
[3:56:34.760 --> 3:56:36.760]  He already knows what a lot of those
[3:56:36.760 --> 3:56:38.760]  down cards are.
[3:56:38.760 --> 3:56:40.760]  And he's confident. That's why he was doing
[3:56:40.760 --> 3:56:42.760]  what he was doing today.
[3:56:42.760 --> 3:56:44.760]  His shift and the rest of these stooges,
[3:56:44.760 --> 3:56:46.760]  they are going to be blown
[3:56:46.760 --> 3:56:48.760]  out of the water.
[3:56:48.760 --> 3:56:50.760]  And this entire impeachment
[3:56:50.760 --> 3:56:52.760]  thing is going to be Democrats
[3:56:52.760 --> 3:56:54.760]  running for cover from it.
[3:56:54.760 --> 3:56:56.760]  When it turns out, like Mike Adams said
[3:56:56.760 --> 3:56:58.760]  last hour,
[3:56:58.760 --> 3:57:00.760]  the whistleblower may even just be a figment.
[3:57:00.760 --> 3:57:02.760]  You know, this
[3:57:02.760 --> 3:57:04.760]  anonymous whistleblower,
[3:57:04.760 --> 3:57:06.760]  he may not even exist.
[3:57:06.760 --> 3:57:08.760]  He might be another creation.
[3:57:08.760 --> 3:57:10.760]  Like Peter Arnett's
[3:57:10.760 --> 3:57:12.760]  mysterious colonel that said,
[3:57:12.760 --> 3:57:14.760]  oh, we had to destroy the village
[3:57:14.760 --> 3:57:16.760]  to save it.
[3:57:16.760 --> 3:57:18.760]  This is the left-wing playbook
[3:57:18.760 --> 3:57:20.760]  that has worked for decades.
[3:57:20.760 --> 3:57:22.760]  And that paradigm
[3:57:22.760 --> 3:57:24.760]  that they've been running on,
[3:57:24.760 --> 3:57:26.760]  they've been confident it could never
[3:57:26.760 --> 3:57:28.760]  stop, it could never fail.
[3:57:28.760 --> 3:57:30.760]  It is blowing up in their faces.
[3:57:30.760 --> 3:57:32.760]  And Donald Trump
[3:57:32.760 --> 3:57:34.760]  is the media master
[3:57:34.760 --> 3:57:36.760]  and change agent that is doing it all.
[3:57:36.760 --> 3:57:38.760]  But we'll see if that happens.
[3:57:38.760 --> 3:57:40.760]  And I'll see you next Thursday.
[3:57:40.760 --> 3:57:50.760]  Maybe.
