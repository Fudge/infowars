[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he. Live from the Infowars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:50.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he. Live from the Infowars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:50.000 --> 01:00.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he. Live from the Infowars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00.000 --> 01:24.000]  Live from the Infowars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:24.000 --> 01:33.000]  Of course I broke last Tuesday and Wednesday the exclusive that Trump was looking at a major shakeup in the White House.
[01:33.000 --> 01:43.000]  And of course that's in the New York Times yesterday and it's the big top story in the country. Word for word what I said Trump was reportedly saying.
[01:43.000 --> 01:58.000]  Because it's no secret in the White House he's quote mad at almost everybody except the American people and just says I don't care what Congress or the Democrats or anybody say they're a bunch of traders trying to run this country in the ground.
[01:58.000 --> 02:08.000]  They let the Democrats engage in the crimes they want and I decided to fire a coming. I don't need the recommendations and I fired him over a bunch of stuff including Russia.
[02:08.000 --> 02:18.000]  It's total made up malarkey. And they go sir you just admitted obstruction of justice.
[02:18.000 --> 02:32.000]  It's not obstruction of justice when they've had this long investigation and the Intelligence Committee say there's no evidence and the Clintons are on the Russian payroll and the Chinese payroll and Trump isn't.
[02:32.000 --> 02:43.000]  All they've got is general Flynn as a consultant going to an RT gala and being paid and going to Turkey and getting paid and going to England and getting paid and going to a half dozen other countries that's what you do.
[02:43.000 --> 02:51.000]  When you're a top general and Obama fires you then you go as a consultant and you get paid for speeches. It's not a half million or a million or two million.
[02:51.000 --> 02:59.000]  Bill Clinton's been paid $2 million for a speech to pay off not a pay off when you get paid $30,000 to go give a speech when you're a general.
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's all they've got.
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.000]  And now the Senate Democrats say they may refuse to vote on Trump's FBI pick.
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  Just refuse that's right because it's unheard of they say what happened.
[03:12.000 --> 03:18.000]  Bill Clinton fired his FBI chief the day after Vince Foster's body was found.
[03:18.000 --> 03:36.000]  He's lifeless. Bill Clinton fired 93 of the 100 US attorneys. Sessions fired 46 and they called that the unbelievable corruption impeachable.
[03:36.000 --> 03:47.000]  No one has ever done anything like that before because they're targeting low information population.
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  No intellectual gods of our planet, the liberals.
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  So we're going to be breaking that down today as well.
[03:53.000 --> 03:55.000]  A school cancels Mother's Day in Canada.
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  More schools cancel it here in the United States.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  Got a powerful Mark Dice piece coming up.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.000]  Breaking that down.
[04:01.000 --> 04:08.000]  Study describing breastfeeding as natural is unethical because it reinforces gender codes.
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.000]  That's mainstream news of the Journal of Pediatrics.
[04:11.000 --> 04:12.000]  That's right.
[04:12.000 --> 04:17.000]  Breastfeeding is unethical to even use the term. The term mother and father is hateful.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  This is a cult of anti-science garbage.
[04:19.000 --> 04:24.000]  We're built guy, the science guy now says chromosomes don't affect gender.
[04:24.000 --> 04:25.000]  And there's another one.
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  Yes, men can have periods and we need to talk about them.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  No, you don't have a uterus.
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  No, you don't have a vagina.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  No, you can't have babies.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  No, no, no.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  You do not control reality.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  You group of lying trash.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  Oh, you hate people that...
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  I don't care what you think you are if you think you're a dog or the Easter Bunny
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  or a keyboard elf on PCP from Klandasu.
[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  What I do know is this is all a war on Western culture to make us all mentally ill.
[04:55.000 --> 05:20.000]  And I'll let you stop yourself then.
[05:25.000 --> 05:35.000]  This story claims as fact vaccines don't cause autism when some have it already listed as a side effect.
[05:35.000 --> 05:42.000]  Of course, the irony of their statement regarding hanging people who lie about the health and safety of children is it ultimately would fall back on them
[05:42.000 --> 05:46.000]  if they do indeed promote the idea that vaccines cannot be linked to autism,
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  a blatant lie about the health and safety of children.
[05:49.000 --> 05:56.000]  As this same editorial staff would support abortion, but somehow they don't believe that is a threat to the lives and safety of children.
[05:56.000 --> 06:25.000]  InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[06:26.000 --> 06:35.000]  In your hearts are inscribed the values of service, sacrifice and devotion.
[06:35.000 --> 06:43.000]  Now you must go forth into the world and turn your hopes and dreams into action.
[06:43.000 --> 06:50.000]  America has always been the land of dreams because America is a nation of true believers.
[06:50.000 --> 06:56.000]  When the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, they prayed.
[06:56.000 --> 07:05.000]  When the founders wrote the Declaration of Independence, they invoked our creator four times.
[07:05.000 --> 07:22.000]  Because in America, we don't worship government, we worship God.
[07:22.000 --> 07:26.000]  That is why our elected officials put their hands on the Bible and say,
[07:26.000 --> 07:38.000]  So help me God as they take the oath of office. It is why our currency proudly declares in God we trust.
[07:38.000 --> 07:52.000]  And it's why we proudly proclaim that we are one nation under God every time we say the Pledge of Allegiance.
[07:52.000 --> 08:01.000]  I'll play a larger segment of the speech later in the hour on this live Sunday 14th day of May 2017 global broadcast.
[08:01.000 --> 08:04.000]  I'm your host, Alan Jones. We're here live every Sunday.
[08:04.000 --> 08:12.000]  The Lord permits 4 to 6 p.m. Central and then of course back weekdays 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[08:12.000 --> 08:22.000]  And I always say we'll be back live tomorrow or I'll be back live Sunday. God willing, Lord willing, because I'm a superstitious man.
[08:22.000 --> 08:32.000]  I wasn't even taught superstition. It's like certain things I just automatically have a deep feeling in my psyche or my instincts.
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.000]  And one of them is I don't expect to be here tomorrow.
[08:36.000 --> 08:45.000]  I don't take for granted the great gift that's consciousness in life and all the things that God's done for me and my family and done for all of us.
[08:45.000 --> 08:55.000]  That's why sometimes I hate to even say a prayer for a dinner because I feel like I'm gonna actually start thanking God that it's almost like a joke to just spend 30 seconds doing it.
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.000]  Do you get what I'm saying? It's not like I'm some pious Pharisee or Sadducee up there on the hilltop telling you how great I am.
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.000]  I'm a wicked devil, but I love God and I'm gonna break something down here for everybody.
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  My gut, my instinct tells me Donald Trump is super good.
[09:14.000 --> 09:26.000]  My gut three years ago when I first started supporting him told me he was for real and my guts never wrong, but intellectually I didn't like him.
[09:26.000 --> 09:41.000]  I didn't like Blitz, I don't like Glamour, I saw him hang around with the Clintons sometimes in New York and I just fundamentally at an earthly level don't like mainline TV shows like The Apprentice and things like that.
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  And so I really just dislike Hollywood and all that stuff in general.
[09:45.000 --> 09:55.000]  I get Trump was just basically using that for his business, but my instinct told me he was really a good guy.
[09:55.000 --> 10:04.000]  And we've seen intellectually the things he's done that have been very good, but I just want to break something down here for folks.
[10:04.000 --> 10:12.000]  At a fundamental level, I resent very few things in my life.
[10:12.000 --> 10:20.000]  And I also don't really look back in hindsight, I just try to be a good person.
[10:20.000 --> 10:32.000]  And I'm not ashamed of a lot of things, but I got to tell you I'm ashamed of the fact that I haven't defended Trump more and even more ardently.
[10:32.000 --> 10:43.000]  And the fact that I've jumped on the bandwagons sometimes attacking the president because I do want to be absolutely truthful about what he's doing and I do want to criticize the bad things he's doing.
[10:43.000 --> 10:55.000]  And so intellectually I feel good about criticizing him and I want to do it more, but then spiritually at a gut level, my gut just says stop doing that.
[10:55.000 --> 11:06.000]  So it really is a strange phenomenon in my research, in my understanding and my intellectual right now, but also in my discernment because it's very, very paradoxical.
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  There's a lot of forces around Trump.
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  Very, very important things are happening on this planet right now and Donald Trump is being used for a greater purpose.
[11:15.000 --> 11:24.000]  We are all being used for greater purposes, but I'm telling you there is a energetic spiritual vorticee event horizon around Donald Trump.
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  And it's around a lot of people and for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.000]  Evil is being poured out into the world right now.
[11:33.000 --> 11:40.000]  And there's a quickening, an acceleration, a movement towards singularity that's incontrovertible.
[11:40.000 --> 11:53.000]  Whether you look at the spiritual research or whether you look at the cultural research or the mathematical research, the scientific research, humanity is under massive sustained superintelligence attack.
[11:53.000 --> 12:12.000]  And if you look at what Trump's doing overall, it is causing irrevocable damage and setbacks to those that are attacking capitalism, free market, the family, the nation state, the worker, the striver, the builder, the idea of building a world for humans,
[12:12.000 --> 12:23.000]  celebrating coal miners, celebrating steel workers, celebrating teachers, celebrating people that just work hard.
[12:23.000 --> 12:36.000]  That's the Americana, that's the Renaissance, that's the ideal of optimism and kind of a 1950s world view that is the futuristic system.
[12:36.000 --> 12:45.000]  It's the 50s that passed the Civil Rights Act, it's the 50s that said we shouldn't be corrupt, it's the 50s that said we should be even better, we can do anything.
[12:45.000 --> 12:52.000]  That got hijacked and turned into a globalist, socialist, guilt-ridden, mind control cult system.
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  But you don't think of the 50s as the future, but it is the future.
[12:56.000 --> 13:06.000]  It's the time when the space program got launched and all these different secrets of the universe were unlocked and the globalists don't want that type of outlook.
[13:06.000 --> 13:14.000]  And Donald Trump is a 1950s throwback, but he's back to the future.
[13:14.000 --> 13:23.000]  People, some people say it's like he's a man from the future, even though he's a throwback in so many ways, because they blocked off future by the 60s and 70s.
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  They began to arrest development, not just of individuals, but the culture itself.
[13:27.000 --> 13:42.000]  And began to compartmentalize the society and shut down systems that make people fundamentally successful culturally, which is more important than being successful even in monetary systems.
[13:42.000 --> 13:52.000]  They make people feel like failures in the culture by not letting them go through rites of passage, not letting them actually go out and fail.
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  It's like the old Erasmus song says, you've got to lose, know how to win.
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.000]  And I don't want to get too esoteric here or philosophical.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  It's just this is a big time to be alive.
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.000]  And Trump comes in with a hard line to China.
[14:07.000 --> 14:14.000]  He gets most of what he wants from China, then he reverses and says, how great the Chinese president slash dictator's wife is.
[14:14.000 --> 14:22.000]  And, wow, he learned about the history of China and there are all their problems with North Korea and now he understands more of China's problems.
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  That's not Trump being ignorant.
[14:24.000 --> 14:34.000]  That's Trump saying face saving statements to the Chinese dictator so he can go back and get done with the president, basically pushing his arm to do.
[14:34.000 --> 14:43.000]  And under the Asian systems, especially China with face saving, he sat there and said a lot of really nice things about the Chinese government
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  to get them to do what he wanted.
[14:46.000 --> 14:55.000]  But then you see these little one dimensional know it all, reading off teleprompters with an army of riders like Colbert or Oliver or any of these people on HBO.
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.000]  And they're just like, what an idiot, what a moron, what a flip flopper.
[14:58.000 --> 15:10.000]  Trump always said, I'm going to come in really hard on the first negotiation and then I'm going to get a lot because I'm going to negotiate hard.
[15:10.000 --> 15:18.000]  And again, that's just one microcosm of how if you really know what Trump's doing, then you see how smart it is and how good it is and why the elites hate it.
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  But then you see how the media spends it, it's something completely different.
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.000]  Now, let me tell you what's coming up today.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  Roger Stone's got big breaking news.
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  He'll be in studio with us.
[15:26.000 --> 15:27.000]  So does Mike Cernovich.
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.000]  He's going to be on via Skype.
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  That's in the second hour.
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Stone just landed.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  He'll be here soon.
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  We've got the latest attacks over the firing of the FBI director.
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  We'll get into that.
[15:38.000 --> 15:44.000]  We'll get into his powerful, pro-Christian, pro-God calling in the birthright.
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  It's key.
[15:45.000 --> 15:46.000]  It's metaphysical.
[15:46.000 --> 15:47.000]  The enemy knows it.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  That's why they're so upset.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  We're going to get to that.
[15:49.000 --> 15:50.000]  We're going to get the attacks on Mother's Day.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  We're going to get to so many key reports straight ahead.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  Oh, and something even bigger.
[15:56.000 --> 16:22.000]  Stay with us.
[16:26.000 --> 16:52.000]  We're going to get to that.
[16:52.000 --> 17:18.000]  We're going to get to that.
[17:18.000 --> 17:44.000]  We're going to get to that.
[17:44.000 --> 18:10.000]  We're going to get to that.
[18:10.000 --> 18:36.000]  We're going to get to that.
[18:36.000 --> 19:02.000]  We're going to get to that.
[19:02.000 --> 19:28.000]  We're going to get to that.
[19:28.000 --> 19:54.000]  We're going to get to that.
[19:54.000 --> 20:20.000]  We're going to get to that.
[20:20.000 --> 20:46.000]  We're going to get to that.
[20:46.000 --> 21:12.000]  We're going to get to that.
[21:12.000 --> 21:38.000]  We're going to get to that.
[21:38.000 --> 22:04.000]  We're going to get to that.
[22:04.000 --> 22:30.000]  We're going to get to that.
[22:30.000 --> 22:56.000]  We're going to get to that.
[22:56.000 --> 23:22.000]  We're going to get to that.
[23:22.000 --> 23:48.000]  We're going to get to that.
[23:48.000 --> 24:14.000]  We're going to get to that.
[24:14.000 --> 24:40.000]  We're going to get to that.
[24:40.000 --> 25:06.000]  We're going to get to that.
[25:06.000 --> 25:32.000]  We're going to get to that.
[25:32.000 --> 25:58.000]  We're going to get to that.
[25:58.000 --> 26:24.000]  We're going to get to that.
[26:24.000 --> 26:50.000]  We're going to get to that.
[26:50.000 --> 27:16.000]  We're going to get to that.
[27:16.000 --> 27:42.000]  We're going to get to that.
[27:42.000 --> 28:08.000]  We're going to get to that.
[28:08.000 --> 28:34.000]  We're going to get to that.
[28:34.000 --> 29:00.000]  We're going to get to that.
[29:00.000 --> 29:26.000]  We're going to get to that.
[29:26.000 --> 29:52.000]  We're going to get to that.
[29:52.000 --> 30:18.000]  We're going to get to that.
[30:18.000 --> 30:44.000]  We're going to get to that.
[30:44.000 --> 31:10.000]  We're going to get to that.
[31:10.000 --> 31:36.000]  We're going to get to that.
[31:36.000 --> 32:02.000]  We're going to get to that.
[32:02.000 --> 32:28.000]  We're going to get to that.
[32:28.000 --> 32:54.000]  We're going to get to that.
[32:54.000 --> 33:20.000]  We're going to get to that.
[33:20.000 --> 33:48.000]  We're going to get to that.
[33:48.000 --> 34:10.000]  We're going to get to that.
[34:10.000 --> 34:36.000]  We're going to get to that.
[34:36.000 --> 35:02.000]  We're going to get to that.
[35:02.000 --> 35:28.000]  We're going to get to that.
[35:28.000 --> 35:54.000]  We're going to get to that.
[35:54.000 --> 36:16.000]  We're going to get to that.
[36:16.000 --> 36:42.000]  We're going to get to that.
[36:42.000 --> 37:08.000]  We're going to get to that.
[37:08.000 --> 37:34.000]  We're going to get to that.
[37:34.000 --> 38:00.000]  We're going to get to that.
[38:00.000 --> 38:26.000]  We're going to get to that.
[38:26.000 --> 38:54.000]  We're going to get to that.
[38:54.000 --> 39:20.000]  We're going to get to that.
[39:20.000 --> 39:48.000]  We're going to get to that.
[39:48.000 --> 40:16.000]  We're going to get to that.
[40:16.000 --> 40:44.000]  We're going to get to that.
[40:44.000 --> 41:12.000]  We're going to get to that.
[41:12.000 --> 41:20.000]  We don't need a lecture from Washington on how to lead our lives.
[41:20.000 --> 41:27.000]  I'm standing here looking at the next generation of American leaders.
[41:27.000 --> 41:32.000]  There may very well be a president or two in our midst.
[41:32.000 --> 41:39.000]  Anybody think they're going to be president, raise your hand.
[41:39.000 --> 41:46.000]  In your hearts are inscribed the values of service, sacrifice and devotion.
[41:46.000 --> 41:54.000]  Now you must go forth into the world and turn your hopes and dreams into action.
[41:54.000 --> 42:01.000]  America has always been the land of dreams because America is a nation of true believers.
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  When the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, they prayed.
[42:06.000 --> 42:16.000]  When the founders wrote the Declaration of Independence, they invoked our creator four times.
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.000]  Because in America we don't worship government, we worship God.
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  Alright, we're going to play more of the speech in hour number two.
[42:25.000 --> 42:31.000]  The reason I'm playing so much of this today is this is coffin nails to the satanic religion of world government.
[42:31.000 --> 42:36.000]  It's a fact, ladies and gentlemen. The globalists hate God. They hate Christ. They hate prosperity.
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  They hate the family. They hate creation.
[42:39.000 --> 42:44.000]  And they're now banning Mother's Day saying it's hateful and hurtful.
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.000]  School cancels Mother's Day to celebrate diversity in elementary schools, cancelling Mother's Day
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.000]  and Father's Day events and effort to celebrate diversity and inclusivity after a traumatic incident involving one of its students.
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.000]  That's right. Family's existing is bad.
[42:57.000 --> 43:03.000]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at infowarestore.com.
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  Research across the board is clear.
[43:05.000 --> 43:10.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[43:10.000 --> 43:17.000]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[43:21.000 --> 43:25.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide, instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[43:25.000 --> 43:32.000]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[43:32.000 --> 43:40.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[43:40.000 --> 43:44.000]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children,
[43:44.000 --> 43:48.000]  we have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint-free.

[46:15.000 --> 46:21.000]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference. I don't feel good.
[46:21.000 --> 46:24.000]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[46:24.000 --> 46:29.000]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my superfemale. I had a few bottles at my house
[46:29.000 --> 46:36.000]  and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again. Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[46:36.000 --> 46:42.000]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again, so obviously the superfemale is amazing. I love it.
[46:42.000 --> 46:48.000]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is life-changing,
[46:48.000 --> 46:54.000]  that I would suggest it's nascent iodine, Survival Shield X2. It's got a five star rating.
[46:54.000 --> 46:58.000]  It's a win-win infowarsleif.com.
[46:58.000 --> 47:02.000]  This is the info war.
[47:02.000 --> 47:09.000]  President Trump has rightfully said that the mainstream corporate media in America is at war with the American people
[47:09.000 --> 47:17.000]  and at war with any populist movement, be it left or right, that seeks to return power from the multinational
[47:17.000 --> 47:22.000]  unelected corporations back to the nation-state and back to the people.
[47:22.000 --> 47:28.000]  At the end of World War II, the term information war was coined by the United States.
[47:28.000 --> 47:35.000]  Previously, it was called mind war by the Germans or psychological operations by the British.
[47:35.000 --> 47:41.000]  In information warfare, you may use truth, you may use mixed truth and lies,
[47:41.000 --> 47:45.000]  or you may use pure deception like false flag attacks.
[47:45.000 --> 47:53.000]  And if you look at the corporate media today, they're using a wide range of information warfare techniques against the American people.
[47:53.000 --> 48:04.000]  In fact, four years ago, Congress actually legalized the domestic use of deception by the CIA and other agencies against the American people.
[48:04.000 --> 48:11.000]  We've all seen the reports of former President Obama calling gun owners and Christians better clingers.
[48:11.000 --> 48:16.000]  We've seen mainstream media come out and call for the death of Donald Trump.
[48:16.000 --> 48:22.000]  We've witnessed Keith Oberman call for foreign governments to overthrow the president.
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  What has gotten them into this mindset?
[48:26.000 --> 48:33.000]  Here at Infowars, more and more, even the establishment has to admit, we are able to take control of the narratives.
[48:33.000 --> 48:40.000]  We're able to defeat major media combines that are 15, 20 times bigger than we are.
[48:40.000 --> 48:47.000]  We're able to defeat entire consortiums and combines of media that are hundreds of times bigger than we are.
[48:47.000 --> 48:53.000]  Because we're tapping into basic truths, we're tapping into basic art types, we're tapping into you,
[48:53.000 --> 49:00.000]  the people of America and the world who have a race consciousness memory of the long drive of humans
[49:00.000 --> 49:05.000]  to develop new technologies, to control our environments and to build a better world.
[49:05.000 --> 49:13.000]  And in our research at Infowars, we've come upon some frightening conclusions that are massively backed up with hard science.
[49:13.000 --> 49:18.000]  And it's this, why does mainstream media hate the average people so much?
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  Why does it seek to break up the family?
[49:20.000 --> 49:23.000]  Why does it seek to make us poor and dumb us down?
[49:23.000 --> 49:33.000]  Because if you study war psychology, you then realize the elites and the media themselves in their quest for total power
[49:33.000 --> 49:41.000]  have bought into their own lives and have absolutely dehumanized everyone else but themselves.
[49:41.000 --> 49:49.000]  And that's the essence of war propaganda, is demonizing your enemy, dehumanizing them, making them less than human
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  so you can ruthlessly carry out your operations.
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.000]  And if you're fighting for your survival, that's an instinct that we need to have.
[49:57.000 --> 50:02.000]  But not when it's being done by a scientific and technological elite through the military industrial complex
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.000]  that President Eisenhower warned us about and is farewell addressed in 1961.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  So here's the big revelation.
[50:09.000 --> 50:16.000]  We've had corporate weaponized media for decades perched on top of us, demonizing the American people,
[50:16.000 --> 50:22.000]  demonizing free market, demonizing individualism, and trying to dismember and dismantle anything
[50:22.000 --> 50:27.000]  that makes communities, families, and individual persons strong.
[50:27.000 --> 50:35.000]  Because under this global corporate system, they admit they want passive people that can be programmed.
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.000]  What has this done?
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  It's stagnant in our culture.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  It's created incredible entity.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  We've been divided.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  We've been conquered.
[50:42.000 --> 50:51.000]  And now the corporate press itself has degenerated so much that despite the fact that the public's been confused and dumbed down,
[50:51.000 --> 50:57.000]  they realize that it's the mouthpiece of the globalist system that has done this to us.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  Corporate media is promoted.
[50:59.000 --> 51:00.000]  It's empowered.
[51:00.000 --> 51:07.000]  It's given bonuses when it's vicious, when it lies, when it backs the system.
[51:07.000 --> 51:12.000]  But the reporters themselves, many of them aren't consciously evil.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  They just want to believe what they're doing is good.
[51:14.000 --> 51:22.000]  So they start this demonization process of their opposition, whether it's local farmers or second amendment advocates
[51:22.000 --> 51:30.000]  or non-GMO activists or people that are concerned about the dangers of vaccines that the inserts admit they have.
[51:30.000 --> 51:38.000]  We're all then demonized and we see professors and media and others calling for us to be hung or calling for us to be killed.
[51:38.000 --> 51:47.000]  Again, they have degenerated the dialogue to a point where it's actually forced the people to kind of come out of this collective dream state,
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  this coma, and realize we're under attack.
[51:49.000 --> 51:55.000]  And if you study feudalism and if you study oligarchies and if you study monarchies,
[51:55.000 --> 52:00.000]  you see the same pattern of elites where they become disconnected from reality happening over and over again.
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  And you see the MSM, who see the rest of the people as flyover country,
[52:04.000 --> 52:10.000]  arrogantly in those press conferences attacking President Trump or attacking anyone else
[52:10.000 --> 52:15.000]  that dares to challenge the orthodoxy, that they're the establishment,
[52:15.000 --> 52:21.000]  and that they hold the keys to the cultural systems of our country and our planet.
[52:21.000 --> 52:27.000]  They are textbook disconnected elites who are incredibly spoiled and entitled
[52:27.000 --> 52:35.000]  and believe that everybody else should just bow to whatever the latest cause de jure or propaganda is.
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  And so my message to the corporate media is this.
[52:37.000 --> 52:41.000]  You have a 6% approval rating according to your own AP research.
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.000]  You're losing more and more of your audience almost on a daily basis.
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  You're not pertinent anymore.
[52:47.000 --> 52:53.000]  And until you recognize your own humanity and recognize the humanity of the general population
[52:53.000 --> 53:00.000]  and of people that disagree with you, and until you transcend this animalistic dumbing down of the information,
[53:00.000 --> 53:05.000]  you're going to continue to not be relevant and you're going to continue to make yourselves completely
[53:05.000 --> 53:09.000]  and totally abhorred, hated, and obsolete.
[53:09.000 --> 53:14.000]  So if you look at mainstream dinosaur media for what they are, corporate mercenaries,
[53:14.000 --> 53:21.000]  government mercenaries, they're to sell a cold-blooded planetary technocracy agenda
[53:21.000 --> 53:28.000]  of crony capitalism, of total consolidated control, of TPP and IMF and World Bank running our countries
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  and the people have no vote and no say.
[53:30.000 --> 53:35.000]  When you pull back and look at the EU and the UN and all these other global corporate combines
[53:35.000 --> 53:41.000]  and you see how nakedly authoritarian they are and how they're exempt from taxes and regulations,
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  they are the new royalty.
[53:44.000 --> 53:50.000]  And they're even more arrogant than ancient royalty because at least ancient royalty had to hide behind their castle walls
[53:50.000 --> 53:53.000]  from the serfs outside that they were starving to death.
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  They knew the effects of what they were doing.
[53:55.000 --> 54:00.000]  But now this elite is even more disconnected than any other humans in history
[54:00.000 --> 54:03.000]  from what they're actually doing to the people.
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.000]  And of course that's the biggest lie of all, that they're disconnected.
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  They think they're disconnected, but the culture and the dumbing down
[54:09.000 --> 54:15.000]  and the diseases and the cancer and the GMO and all the horrible things that are like plagues upon Egypt
[54:15.000 --> 54:19.000]  from biblical times are affecting the globalist and their children and their families.
[54:19.000 --> 54:24.000]  You look at elitists, you look at billionaires, they have one of the highest rates of suicide in their families,
[54:24.000 --> 54:29.000]  they have one of the highest rates of mental illness, they're some of the most unhappy people out there
[54:29.000 --> 54:34.000]  because they're so selfish and because they believe amassing more raw power.
[54:34.000 --> 54:40.000]  Freedom be damned will somehow fulfill them when they're like a man in a desert with no water.
[54:40.000 --> 54:45.000]  But he's got a big bag of gold and a bag of jewels and all it does is weigh him down and kill him
[54:45.000 --> 54:50.000]  by keeping him from getting to the oasis that was 20 miles away.
[54:50.000 --> 54:58.000]  The world, Hollywood, MSM, all the big power structures, they have nothing to offer you
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  because it's all based on a lie.
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.000]  Spending time with your family, being an honorable person, being a carpenter,
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  going and helping the homeless.
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  Whatever it is you choose to do, empowering others will empower you
[55:11.000 --> 55:15.000]  because that's what we're really designed to do.
[55:15.000 --> 55:24.000]  Look at how the corporate media calls us fake news for saying that Obama and Hillary helped create ISIS
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.000]  and the Arab Spring, that's been a fact.
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  Look at how they attack us when we said Obamacare would double your premiums
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.000]  and had death panels, you couldn't keep your doctor and they called us racist.
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  But everybody knows now, that's true, that happened.
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.000]  Everybody who has a memory.
[55:41.000 --> 55:47.000]  But as Gruber said, the average American doesn't have an attention span and is stupid, thank God.
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  Well you know what, I don't think you're stupid.
[55:50.000 --> 55:58.000]  I know that they've dumbed the media down and have not called these politicians out on their lies
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  and so that's how they've basically gotten away with this.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  It's not because you didn't have a memory.
[56:04.000 --> 56:09.000]  It's because they sat there and backed up the lies for so long people gave up hope.
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.000]  But the truth is, hope's coming back and you can see it all over the world
[56:13.000 --> 56:17.000]  as unelected corporate world government begins to collapse.
[56:17.000 --> 56:24.000]  My message is the establishment's this, you are stagnant, you are full of entropy and greed and arrogance.
[56:24.000 --> 56:27.000]  You're the most selfish people I've ever seen.
[56:27.000 --> 56:32.000]  And if you don't realize that your own selfishness is going to destroy you, then you get what you deserve.
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  I'm just concerned that as the globalist system begins to collapse,
[56:36.000 --> 56:42.000]  it could spark a worldwide war or depression and hurt a lot of innocent people.
[56:42.000 --> 56:46.000]  And that's why folks that are on the fence in government and in corporations
[56:46.000 --> 56:51.000]  of power who know that I'm right and who know from their own research and perspective
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  that a lot of things are worse than I'm even saying.
[56:54.000 --> 56:57.000]  It's up to you, good men and women, to take action.
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  The problem is a lot of good people aren't arrogant.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  And so they kind of see it as aggressive to be leaders.
[57:04.000 --> 57:07.000]  Don't be a leader because you're arrogant.
[57:07.000 --> 57:12.000]  Be a leader because your children and my children need you.
[57:12.000 --> 57:15.000]  Let's do it together.
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  Let's bring in the new Renaissance. Let's believe in humanity again.
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  Let's build a world for the family. Let's build a world based on real freedom.
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  Let's build a world that's truly open and conclusive.
[57:25.000 --> 57:47.000]  This fake leftist political correctness is right out of the Soviet Union.
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  I thought it would be a six month supply for listeners.
[57:58.000 --> 58:03.000]  And since then, people are beating down our doors wanting to be able to resupply their super blue.
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.000]  Research across the board is clear. In fact, it's certified.
[58:06.000 --> 58:09.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[58:11.000 --> 58:15.000]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns
[58:15.000 --> 58:18.000]  that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[58:18.000 --> 58:21.000]  Super blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[58:21.000 --> 58:24.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.

[59:48.000 --> 59:51.000]  Ban the family. It's good.
[59:51.000 --> 59:54.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:54.000 --> 59:56.000]  No, don't listen to him.
[59:56.000 --> 59:58.000]  Mommies are bad.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  Not even Mother's Day is Abude from the hatred from the liberal lunatics
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  and social justice warriors psychos who are upset that the holiday isn't inclusive enough.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  It isn't diverse enough because it doesn't celebrate, quote, non-traditional families.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  Of course, liberals hate almost every holiday.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  They hate the Fourth of July because it celebrates the birth of this great country.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  No one's allowed anything but them.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  They hate Christian holiday and they even say that Santa Claus is a symbol of white supremacy
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  and of white privilege in America.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  They hate Halloween because when kids dress up in certain costumes, it offends them.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  They hate Valentine's Day because it makes people who are single feel bad about themselves.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  And just a year or two ago, nobody really could have imagined that the liberal lunatics would find Mother's Day offensive.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  But, of course, they do.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  One elementary school actually canceled the Mother's Day arts and crafts period
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  and sent this note home with the students to the parents.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  Dear parents, as Mother's Day and Father's Day approach,
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  we have met as a team to discuss our core values in an effort to celebrate diversity, inclusivity,
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  and also nurture our students who are part of non-traditional families.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  We have decided to encourage those celebrations to take place at home.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  Due to this, the children will not be making gifts at school to give on Mother's Day and Father's Day.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  We feel each family knows the best way to celebrate within their own family.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Thank you for understanding.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  Thankfully, that school is in Canada, but you know that this kind of insanity is probably happening in American schools.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  It just hasn't made headlines yet.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Word of this crazy school is making headlines not just in Canada, but across the country here in the United States.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  And most normal people are quite surprised and quite shocked that the liberal insanity just continues to go on now in their attacking Mother's Day.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  But Liberals Day gets a great idea.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  Here's an article from Teen Vogue.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  School cancels Mother's Day to celebrate inclusivity and diversity.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  And then it goes on.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  The subtitle of the article is, This is actually a really smart idea.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  Some little tick in the Washington compost just wrote this article for some gay parents.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Mother's Day or Father's Day is awkward.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  I guess we shouldn't celebrate Mother's Day or Father's Day anymore because gay people think that it's awkward.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  Thankfully, there are still normal families out there.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  The liberal minority says Mother's Day is a minefield for two dad families.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  Same sex.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  You know what, it pause.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  It pause.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  It pause.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  I'm going to play the rest when Roger Stone's in the studio.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  But just, that's Mark Dice.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  The video's on them.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  Forge.com is doing a great job.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  Do you understand they're having at feminist rallies all over the world?
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  Women put on a jibs and announce that they're going to support Islam because it's anti-Western.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  It's the West that has the open society moron.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  Almost every Muslim country doesn't let women go out without hoods over their heads.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  They cut your genitals off at birth.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  They don't let you drive cars, dumbasses.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  But you sit here in this open society.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  They're like adults that piss in their bed.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  They're like, the weird fetishes where you crap in your pants and you're 50 years old.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  I mean, that's what this is.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  This is mass-cuckling by a bunch of mentally ill beta-losers that want to run around just going crazy.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  Look at this.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  Study.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  Describing breastfeeding is natural.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  Just use the words we say.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  You're in a cult now.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  It's unethical because it reinforces gender roles.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  This is mainstream news from the Journal of Pediatrics.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  That's what the nurses and doctors are being taught.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  Is it mammals?
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  Whether they be whales?
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Whether they be dogs?
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  Whether they be bovine cows?
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  Whether they be pen-a-pen seals?
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  I'm using scientific terms.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  I'm not a pseudo-intellectual.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  I actually know all these names.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  They're like, how about a British accent?
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  It is outrageous to say that mammals should not be able to breastfeed and that it's hurtful to others.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  It's also outrageous to claim that men could have uruses and have children.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  It is simply fake and false.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  I cannot claim, as Sir Wilful Johnson the 19th, that I can be a black hole in the intergalactic arm of Alpha Centuries.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  Or that I could be a cuttlefish.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  But this is the mass mental illness spore delivered by the global alchemist to create mass dissension and cultural breakdown.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  The very foundations of society are under absolute effect and are preparing to fall.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  This is being done to usher in the planetary government and biological weapons release that will exterminate the majority of humanity.
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  Already the so-called elites have decided you are obsolete and have been making the announcements that they intend to end society as we know it.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  And that, my friends, is what we've seen here.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  I'm Keith Overman.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  I hope foreign powers overthrow Trump, including the Russians, because he's a Russian agent.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  No oxymoron there.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  No paradoxical falsities.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  The liberal trendiness forced fed by corporate media.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  We'll be back with Roger Stone in studio.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  Mike Sernovich with Break Breaking News ends.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  A lot of information begins to come out about how serious this purge is going to be that El Presidente 45 is in launch.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  We're Telegraph Free.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diet of processed junk.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLife.com.
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  The ultimate and true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  Caveman.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  And this is a big part of it.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:06:02.000]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were.
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  Driving down your freeway. Midnight alleys roam.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  Cops in cars, the topless bars, never saw one more.
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  So alone.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  So alone.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  All right folks, in the next hour Roger Stone, the villain of villains, the most evil man in the world, according to thousands of different news articles the last few months, hundreds of last few days.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  He is of course the subject of a multi-year documentary that interviews the president when he was running for president.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  And Roger Stone follows Roger Stone's last three, four years right through to Trump's victory ending in the InfoWars Studios, in our larger studios right across the hall.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  And it's just crazy to me, I wanted to bring this up to Roger because they call him this villain because he introduced modern TV ads in the 70s and 80s, negative advertising exposing the Democrats for who they really were when the Republicans actually started standing up against a lot of disinformation.
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  The Democrats were the kings of original negative advertising.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  They had the nightly news.
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  They had the big three networks.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  This was conservatives and patriots going from the experiences of Barry Goldwater being run over by these traders and learning how to create their own media and their own system.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  So we're talking proto-infowars.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  So I've known Roger about four or five years, but known him good about two and a half.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  And he's so accurate.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  In fact, he warns me sometimes when something is 100% on and says, you know, the key is we've got to be totally accurate.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  That's the real currency of victory here is having the scoops, having the sources.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  If you put out fake scoops or you put out something 100% right, even by accident, sometimes it damages what you're doing.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  That's why they're always trying to say we're fake news, but they're the ones lying about WMDs.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  They're the ones lying about their whole fake drug war, both parties.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  They're the ones lying about Obamacare.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  And, you know, Roger Stone has been true to himself as a libertarian conservative.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  You know, he's a pro gay marriage.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  He's pro marijuana legalization.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  And he says that in the film.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  But then they act like he's this cold-blooded demon, you know, that supported all these dictators and things.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  Well, how about supporting people that are fighting communist dictators taking over or at least letting them have access to the American political system.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  So the United States has contact with those people and influence.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  It's the Democrats backing the Arab Spring, the Islamic takeover.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  Roger Stone has always been fighting that.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  So all I'm saying is I'm a 100% ideologue.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  I do everything I do because I believe in free market, I believe in open free societies, I believe in Americana.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  Why wouldn't I?
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  Look at Venezuela, look at Cuba, look at North Korea, look at China.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  I love America.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  And so they do all this gesticulation and backbending and everything to try to say we're actors, we're fake, we're frauds.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  When they're the actors, they're the fakes.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  We're teleprompter free.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  We're not like Stephen Colbert, an actor posing as a reporter saying we're not real.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  We're not like Trevor Noah and John Oliver and all these people that have staves of hundreds of people loading them full of BS.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  We believe in what we stand for.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  And you see Trump killing TPP, 3 trillion plus in the stock market, 300 billion of new jobs, half a million new jobs actually announced.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  Globalist in full panic and invoking God saying we love God, not the state.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  This is coffin nails to them.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  So I haven't talked to Roger today.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  He flew out.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  I don't know what he wants to cover.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  I've got the fact that we broke from our sources.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  By the way, we're not Roger.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  He can concur on it that Trump's getting ready for a big purge.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  That's in the New York Times yesterday, which has got more joining us.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  The FBI probe, the Islamists is selling children's organs.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  I mean, this is crazy.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  The liberals wanting to ban.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  See, Roger will go to a gay freedom rally and he's in the new film doing that.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  Roger was doing that years ago, supporting open freedom, trying to get the Republican Party, which Trump's done, to not be so control free.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  But the left are the new control freaks.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  So you could not be against gay people.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  But at the same time, it's not gay people pushing that they don't want mother and fathers or they want Mother's Day banned.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  That's a load of bull.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  This is about overthrowing what they call the basic human system.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  So we're going to cover this all the next hour with Roger Stone.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  We're going to have live feeds tonight as well with infowords.com for some special live shows on the street.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  And then he'll be in studio with us back tomorrow, stonecultured.com.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  Roger, I am wound up.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  So you better jump in or you won't get a word in edgewise here.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  You know, Alex, I think that in a certain sense, I think the reason this documentary was green lighted by Netflix is because they believe that the Trump presidency will be a failure.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  And therefore they can pin it on me.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  They hope to to to vilify me the way they vilified Karl Rove.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  And again, I think they know that when you say over and over again, you know, Trump is a stock is a sock puppet.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  Stone was pulling all the strings, which is completely untrue that that hurts you with the man.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  So there's an undercurrent of that.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  You won't find me saying anywhere in this documentary or anywhere that I am Trump's brain or that the strategy of the elected was his and not mine.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Now, I do think when you work with somebody for 40 years, there is an osmosis.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  You put a mark on them.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  And they affect you.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  And vice versa.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  I saw some things differently because of things I learned from him.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  I think he saw things differently than what he saw.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  Sure, but they call you the like the greatest villain, the super villain, and then you didn't do anything.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  I mean, you watch this and it's like, you know what they're up to.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  The Clint stealing all the money from Haiti and backing radical Islam and all the rapes and all the other crap.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  You never raped anybody, Roger.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  No, there, as you know, there's a subset of leftist now trying to push the idea that Trump is mentally incompetent, that he's insane.
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  Let's think about that for a moment.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  We had a serial rapist as our president.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  Where were they then?
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  They weren't talking about what a nut job Bill Clinton was then.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  So I mean, he's a sex criminal.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  It's outrageous, but it shows the extent to which they are petrified.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  The president is very angry.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  I think he has come to the conclusion that he is being ill-served by some around him.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  Well, let's talk about that.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  I mean, here I am popping in and erupting.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  But let's walk through that.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  I called you on Tuesday and Wednesday and I said, here's my sources of that.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  He said, yeah, that's really accurate, but don't quote me because I want to keep my sources quite frankly.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  And you said, yes, he is angry.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  That part is accurate.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  Some heads are probably going to roll.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  And then I confirmed to you the media said that was fake news.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  But three days later, it's in the New York Times on Saturday.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  Everything you said, I said word for word.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  Well, and I can tell you right now that there was bickering in the White House staff over Abbas's meeting with the president.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  And whether or not we were going to hold his feet to the fire on the funding of terrorism.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  We can never have peace between his country and ours, between his political organization and the United States,
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  as long as he finances the murder of Jews and Christians and anyone who disagrees.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  We just can't do it.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  And the president stepped in and kind of toughened up the rhetoric.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  And the meeting became somewhat more confrontational.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  But there were in that country's right. And there were those on the White House staff who didn't want to raise this issue,
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  who are more interested in the photo op and make you look like we're getting along to try to beat back our critics.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  Well, that would have been without substance.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  And that's not Trump.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  So I actually have credit to Sean Spicer on this.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  He was in favor of a harder line.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  And the president, I think, learned of his views and agreed with them.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  Mr. Priebus was not for a hard line.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  I guess we have these Middle Eastern leaders coming here and others.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  And Trump is calling them out on the carpet.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  Something had been going on for a very long time.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  I mean, I love his address at that university, Christian University yesterday saying,
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  we don't worship government.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  We worship God and expanding on that, you know, going and talking about how there's a Christian genocide going on hundreds of thousands of years
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  by Muslims.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  This is happening.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:00.000]  OK.
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  And the left shows how deranged they are that they literally want to ally with radical Islam because they're killing Christians.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  Why does the left have such a giant flaming heart on for Christians?
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  Why do they want us dead?
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  Well, and to give him credit, the president has really hung in on the repeal of the so-called Johnson Rule.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  The Johnson Rule was put in place by Lyndon Johnson.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  Saying Christians that are conservative have no free speech, but liberals can run around to whatever they want.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  But more importantly, preachers in Texas could not preach against him before the election.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  That's why he put it in place.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  It was all about him.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  And Billy Graham is the one who explained what Johnson had done to Donald Trump.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  And he has never forgotten it.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  And he's never backed off.
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  By the way, every time I talk to him, he brings it up just randomly.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  He says, you watch.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  I'm going to let Christians have free speech.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  I mean, you like that?
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  You like that?
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  I'm like, yeah, I really like that.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  I like everybody have free speech.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  And Roger, talk about the president where he's at right now, where you're at.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  Biotrucellinium is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine.
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  As both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  Visit infowarslife.com to order your bottle of Biotrucellinium before we sell it again.
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  That's infowarslife.com to secure your selenium and other key products that don't only help yourself and your family,
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:44.000]  but also fund our operation against the globalist, A360 Wham.
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in for it.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  This is the time to support InfoWars. That's infowarslife.com.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  This is more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene,
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  It works.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  Defender Body Armor is now available through infowarsstore.com.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  So you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the info war against the globalist all at the same time.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  It's not just our water we need to filter. It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned. It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:26.000]  These new water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children.
[1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  It's the best job you can to purify your air.
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  The general public doesn't.
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarsstore.com.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:06.000]  Research across the board is clear.
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  Some of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  Due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children,
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  we have created the new bubble gum flavored super blue that is spearmint free.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  Learn more about the new bubble gum flavored super blue toothpaste and more at infowarslife.com
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  and support the info war while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  All right, Roger Stone has been so busy in New York City, he hasn't even slept.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  And he flew down here today, he's in Austin, Texas, he was for a couple days in studio.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  Poor guy didn't even eat today, I was just talking to his man at least I'm gonna kill over here.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  But Roger was talking about how hot Trump is and I want to be clear, I have other sources.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  Cernovich has sources.
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  I have sources of the Pentagon, different agencies you name it.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  Poor Roger, every time I report something he gets called and asked, did you release that?
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  It's like Dan Bongino's never given me any information out of Secret Service.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  He's been out of it for years and every time I say a Secret Service said Hillary Clinton's having seizures
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  and falling down every 45 minutes, he gets called threatened and I've got to say, no, it's not Dan Bongino.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  To the point of he didn't want to come on the show because of it.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  But we have our sources, White House sources, Trump looks to replace Spicer as purge of establishment advisors begins.
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  There's not even so much a purge that moving Spicer on.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  And I talked about Priebus and others, I talked to Roger a few days later and he said, yeah, that's on target.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  Well, this week we reported that, now Saturday the New York Times comes out and says, sure enough,
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  looks like he's being moved out the door and Trump wants a major reboot.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  So again, are we fake news?
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  No, they hate us because the corporate media is forced to report stuff.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  They would never report because we forced them to by reporting it days, weeks or years before.
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  That's why they hate him, FullWords.com and StoneColdTruth.com and Mike Cernovich.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  That's going to be co-hosting with us in the next two segments.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  So, Roger, let's get into Trump, the intel you've got, the intel we've got, where he is, the type of reboots,
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  the new FBI Director, other key smorgasbord.
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  Well, Alex, I think one of the things the President is most unhappy about is the fact that the Democrats have been much more successful
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  in pushing the false narrative of Russian collusion in the election.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  And we have not been as effective at getting to the bottom of how the President was, in fact, surveilled in certain phone calls at Trump Tower.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  Now, you'll remember that FBI Director Comey and Admiral Rogers of the NSA both testified under oath that there was no, no surveillance.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  Well, if one phone call with Donald Trump were recorded and they perjured themselves, we now know that there were more than one.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  We have not been as good.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  Of course, we don't have the mainstream media allies that they have, but the White House political shop has not done an effective job on this question.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  The President is burned up over the false narrative that the Russians helped him win the election.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  This makes him angry, and Alex, it should, because it's a lie.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  It's a distortion.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  It's a fantasy of the left, and it had two purposes, to distract from the corruption of the Podesta brothers and the Clintons,
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  and also to, to make up for the fact that they nominated an old, tired, sick, corrupt candidate who had no energy and no ideas.
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  Well, plus, they'd been in the news saying, oh, we've got Trump.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  We've got his people with the Russians.
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  We've got him surveilled.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  The New York Times dozens of times in late 2016, early 2017, we covered it.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  And Ozium showed the headlines, and then Comey says the President's crazy that he thinks Obama surveilled him.
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  Then last week it comes out, even the Associated Press said that Obama ordered thousands of Americans in the campaign surveilled for political purposes.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  So they've literally turned their crimes around against the President.
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  I found it endearing that he went on TV with Holt and Lester Holt in NBC and said, listen, I didn't get rid of him.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  I did get rid of him over the leaks.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  I did get rid of him over the weird stuff he said about Hillary.
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  She's super corrupt, but we can't go after her.
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  And I am sick of the Russia.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  It's made up.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  And they go, oh my God, that's obstruction of justice.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  You got rid of, no, he's saying it's bull.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  He's being honest.
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  He's sick of it.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  And then he did ask the FBI.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  We all know this.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  Hey, look at Hillary and the uranium deals.
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  Look at the China deals.
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  Go after them.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  He knows he's not done anything.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  And that's why he's so angry is he understands as a canard, as you said, on a bunch of different shows the last week.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  And you notice it that director Comey had no interest at all into looking into the corruption of the Clinton Foundation.
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  He's too busy chasing a Russian collusion or the illegal server or the pedophilia or the or Sandy Berger or Mark Rich.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  This goes back a long way.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  He's been giving the Clintons a pass for a long time.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  FBI director.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  Now this is a complicated question.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  I think the president needs somebody who is not in Washington, not part of the Washington buddy system.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  The acting director McCabe would be a disaster.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  This is a guy who is wife gave 600,000 of the Democrats.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  Well, no, it's twofold here.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  She gave him.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  He wanted he first of all want to use taxpayer money to pay for the phony dossier on Donald Trump.
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  And she got $700,000 through Terry McAuliffe for a state Senate race in Virginia, which was the payoff for not prosecuting Hillary.
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  For not recommending the prosecution.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Sure.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  And I saw that.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  Then I saw reports that they've given big to Democrats.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  I don't think that I don't know.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  I don't know what their wealth is.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  But I had researched this and McAuliffe, of course, is, you know, he is one of the flying monkeys in the Clintons.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  Sure.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  Well, let me tell you how I know the Russian things bull.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  I've followed it.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  I've watched it.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  Plus they said I'm under criminal investigation for actually being commanded by the Russians.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  That's the biggest load of horsemen are on the planet.
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  I mean, it is complete abject bull.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  Well, in this, this hearing with the.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  They don't ever let us testify.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  Do they?
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  No, isn't that amazing that they don't?
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  They keep saying we want it.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  We want these guys to testify.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  In fact, Chairman Burr said he'll subpoena anybody who refuses.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  Why don't we go to DC in the next few weeks with cameras and just try to march in and demand their offices like tumors.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  We're here to testify.
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  I mean, he'll set press conferences.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  You name it.
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  I think it's a pretty good idea.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  I don't think they can't.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  They can't deal with the guerrilla politics of the movement.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  But you're a famous anti-communist and all we're trying to cut taxes, rebuild our military, defend our borders, kill the TPP, restore American sovereignty.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  If that's Russian agenda, well, then I guess that's wonderful.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  Alex, that's the whole point.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  I'm the perfect villain because I've cultivated this reputation for having shard elbows in a rogue.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  The Democrats think I'll be a patsy on this.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  The problem is they don't have an iota of proof of Russian collusion.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  I don't know any Russians and they know I don't know any Russians because they hacked my email.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  They have had me under surveillance.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  But they never stopped.
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  So let me ask you this.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  Why is Trump so mad?
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  Because it's made up.
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  Is he just sick of it?
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  I think he's sick of it.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  Plus, he sees what really are egregious crimes over here by the Clintons that no one talks about, that they just walk away from.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  Do we have any idea?
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  I mean, I think Cornyn overall has proven to be a pretty good senator.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  He's a little kind of mainstream, but at the same time, I mean, who else would be a good FBI director?
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  I would like former New York police commissioner Ray Kelly.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  Now, I disagree with him on Stop and Frisk.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  And Stop and Frisk was never decided.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  Didn't we run into him and claim him?
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  Yes, we did.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  He's a good man.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  But Stop and Frisk has never been decided by the courts.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  It was knocked down by the lower courts.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  And then New York City Mayor de Blasio never appealed.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  So we don't have a definitive answer.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  Well, he shouldn't rise and fall on that.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  It is illegal today.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  It is one issue, though.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  Looking at it overall, he's a New Yorker.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  He is personally close to the president and knows him well.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  So there's a trust there.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  He did a phenomenal job of taking the crime capital of the United States and turning it into one of the safest cities in America.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  New York was as bad as Chicago.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  So I think he would be ideal. I think he might have to be persuaded to take the job.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  But I think in the end he would take it if it were offered.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  Judge Jeanine Pirro is another, more than capable, former prosecutor.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  Former judge.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  And press secretary?
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  Kimberly Guilfoyle, I think.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  Let's come back and talk about the next shoes to drop.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  And a lot more of Roger Stone.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  Mike Stern does a big breaking news straight ahead.

[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me.
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my super female.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:33.000]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:36.000]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again, so obviously a super female is amazing. I love it.
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2.
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  If there's one product that I would say is life changing, that I would suggest it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2.

[1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  Do you still think that Jeffrey will brought down a World Trade Center?
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  This story does not add up.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  It's a thing.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  I need to find Trump.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  I promise I'll talk better.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  I can't go back to the Navy, I can't swim.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  I want to talk to President Trump now.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  He doesn't come here anymore.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  Well then where is he?
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  A golf course in New Jersey.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  Mr. Trump, I need to talk to you.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  Have you ever told me to say things that aren't true?
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  Only since you started working here.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  I don't think I can do this anymore, Mr. Trump.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  They're saying that you're going to replace me with Sarah.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  Come on, I would never do that.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  She doesn't have your special spice, salt and pepper, a little bit of sugar.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  Mr. President, stop.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  You like when I do that, Sean?
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  No, it just tickles a little.
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  No, I'm married.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  Sean, kiss me.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  I can't, I have a wife, I took vows.
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  I'm famous, it's okay.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  This is like a godfather when you kiss me and no one ever sees me again.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  Yes.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  Oh, mad passion, love the world.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  Now, here's the issue with this.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  Here's the issue as we analyze that piece.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  I went and did some research.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  They did that on another show last week that he was trying to do all this.
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  And it's always about how he's a liar.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  Or the piece where they attack me, he goes, black people aren't humans.
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  Alex Jones told me in full war, said so.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  I mean, I could do a better job on Baldwin.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  It's ridiculous.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  And I guess he is fatter than me.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  So the point is that this is total deception.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  And this is the way they try to then turn the public against Trump, always claiming he's lying.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  When he actually went on TV, just like we told you back on Tuesday and Wednesday,
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  Trump fired Comey because of all the things he did with the Clintons,
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  of letting him have the leaks, of saying weird stuff that she's corrupt,
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  but we can't prosecute her, and just acting fruity.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  I said he acts weird.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  He acts candy-ass.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  He acts strange.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  That's what I heard from sources.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  Trump days later says he acts strange.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  He acts weird.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  He just is bizarre.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  And the Russia things made up.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  And they go, of course, we said it was Russia.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  And they go, oh, oh, see, even Stone and Jones say it's Russia.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  Yeah, Trump said it days later because it's a bunch of reasons.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  It's a bunch of made-up crap.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  Mike Cernovich is our guest with Roger Stone.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  He'll be co-hosting with me the next two days.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  Hell, the full four hours, if you want to, my friend.
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  So it's great to have you here.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  We have a lot of behind-the-scenes planning going on.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  Got a big documentary about you.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  It's a big hit right now.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  Get me Roger Stone.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  But let's talk about the other shoes to drop and what's happening with Spicer.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  Because now they've gone from Alex Jones is crazy,
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  Roger Stone is crazy, Mike Cernovich is crazy.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  Yes, everything's wonderful.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  Moon Spicer's not going anywhere.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  No shake-ups.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  He's not mad.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  To now admitting all that's true, which pisses him off because they don't have the sources.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  Yeah, in fact, Sean Spicer is in such, under such public attack,
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  I'm starting to get sympathetic to him.
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  They're attacking him because he works for Donald Trump.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  Even though I don't think he is, you know,
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  I don't think he was the right person for this job from the beginning.
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  I'm not sure how many people remember in September when he said if Trump doesn't get his poll numbers up,
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  the Republican National Committee will have to suspend its financial support of his presidential candidacy.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  That's unheard of.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  That's outrageous.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  And he's a choker.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  He chokes now and hides in the bushes.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  He clearly wasn't at his desk at the right time.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  Hey, they make jokes all day.
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  I'm ready to be the White House Press Secretary.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  I'll be Guilfoyle's deputy.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  Who wouldn't?
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  But, I mean, that said,
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  I'll crawl around with my hands and knees.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  I think Sarah Huckabee Sanders has done a credible job.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  I'm actually, she's really good.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  Well, you know, I think she's really done a good job.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  She's better than Spicer.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  Well, you could say that.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  Yes.
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  And I think he does some good moral stands and has good moments,
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  but he's let them get under his skin.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  I think it's okay to get angry,
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  but you can't let them actually freak you out.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  Well, in this particular case,
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  I think that the White House Press Shop needs a total overhaul.
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  They need a more offensive operation.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  And their biggest single problem, Alex,
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  is that we still don't control the government.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  This is Barack Obama's administration with a few top Trump people
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  with the cabinet jobs,
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  because the chief of staff,
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:09.000]  Reince Priebus,
[1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  will not instruct the individual cabinet members to say,
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  this is who you're hiring,
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  Assistant Secretary's deputy secretary.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  They're paralyzed because of him.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  So let me ask you this.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  How long,
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  little birdies told me that Reince Priebus is walking the plank
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  very, very soon.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  Well, that may be premature, but in trouble.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  Well, okay.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  What about in trouble?
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  In trouble, for sure.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  What about the word, though, that a big reboot's coming?
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  Trump isn't sure yet,
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  but he's definitely, you know, trying to really overhaul things.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  Well, I think he's dissatisfied with the way it's going.
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  Frankly, the poll numbers are something that should be watched very carefully.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  There's a lot of elasticity here.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  You'll remember there were times in the campaign
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  when he would drop in the polls,
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  and then he would immediately bounce back.
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  Plus, they're manipulating those two.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  Let's go to Mike Sernovich, obviously a very demonized,
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  because he is real news.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  Mike, we're right again with our reporting this week,
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  but we get no credit.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  What is your latest intel, my friend?
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  Thanks for joining us.
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  Yeah, my latest intel is that Trump and Roger can probably confirm this.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  Trump deliberately, this is how genius Trump's move was,
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  and maybe Roger gave him this advice.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  Who knows?
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  Trump did not leak the Comey story to Reince Priebus
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  or to Sean Spicer to triangulate who was sabotaging him.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  Trump now knows it's either Spicer or Reince,
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  who are sabotaging him.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  They are so busted.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  Yeah, Sernovich, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  He got his earpiece unplugged out or run over and plug it in for him here.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  He'll prompt a free notice.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  Sorry, we're interrupting. Keep going.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  Oh, so that was why the Comey story never leaked.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  Trump didn't tell Reince and he didn't tell Spicer.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  And my sources told me that was because he wanted to find out,
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  okay, who is doing the leaking?
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  Is it Sean or is it Reince?
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  Now he knows it's one of them.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  That was the perfect trap.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  The Comey story didn't leak.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  So now he has to figure out, is it Spicer or Reince?
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  But he knows for a fact it's one of them.
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  So that is what the shakeup talk is about.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  Trump is furious.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  He now has confirmation that his own press team or somebody with him,
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  within it is not being honest.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  So here's another subplot, another subtext is that Spicer and his press team
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  threw a fit.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  Oh my God, we weren't prepared to talk about Comey.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  Well, no kidding, because you're leaking it.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  Because you're leaking the story Trump cannot...
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  That's right. He's got to keep his cards to his own vest
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  because of your treachery, dumbasses.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  Yep.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  Exactly.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  Absolutely.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  So they're all flipping out.
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  And I was told by my sources that to let Alex and the whole team know
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  and everybody else to let Trump know that that was a good decision
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  because what they're trying to do is they're saying,
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  watch Trump.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  Look what happens, but you don't tell us beforehand.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  Sure.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  That's why the word I got from multiple sources and Roger confirmed this.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  It's probably his own people, we're not sure exactly who,
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  that leaked to the media the talking points Nick Sonia and didn't tell them
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  to selfishly make them the poor little heroes that weren't part of all this
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  and then Spicer hides in the bushes and acts like he's all upset.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  It has bad optics.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  You know, Alex, I actually think that the CNN Politico story last week
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  that said that I was the one who convinced the president to fire Comey
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  was the result of a leak from the White House
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  with the strategic thought that Roger Stone, Richard Nixon,
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  Saturday Night Massacre, here's how we poison the option of firing Comey
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  with the president.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  That was the purpose of that.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  And it obviously failed.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  From your intel, feather Mike, from your intel,
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  can you come back both of you?
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  You know, obviously, can you tell people who you think it is?
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  No, because these people are idiots.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  I mean, we'll be right back with Mike Cernovich, Roger Stone.
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  This is the info war.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:28.000]  In order to be equal, in order to be liberated, some white people may have to die.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  That was Professor Tommy Curry on the Reading News Review podcast
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  who went on to say that the movie Django Unchained made killing white people look fun.
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  But in reality, it should be part of a serious discussion.
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  So far, it is unknown if law enforcement officials or homeland security
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  are investigating Tommy Curry for his violent, racist, and terroristic threats.

[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  Another word. Another time.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  His life was green and good until the present day.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.

[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  All right, Mike Sernovich, Roger Stone. I feel bad we're almost out of time here.
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  Obviously, tomorrow, hopefully, you can pick this back up.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  Roger's going to be in studio. Roger Sernovich is taking over with other big news, other big tidbits.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  It's just such a battle for this country, such a huge army of scum aligned against the American people.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  It's just an unprecedented time right now to be alive.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  I mean, Trump so clearly is the American president.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  He's so clearly trying to turn the economy back on.
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  He's so clearly under attack by every enemy on the planet. This is insane.
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  But at the same time, you have Rex Tillerson, Condoleezza Rice, pushing the appointment of Kay Bailey Hutchinson.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  Part of the Never Trump crowd is Ambassador Donato. What could possibly be the thinking here?
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  So what was Trump's thinking to bring all these people in thinking they would just do good because he was the boss?
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  I think he thought it would be Kumbaya.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  Yes, it's important to have all factions of the party represented.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  Yes, it's important to have a united party, but unite the party by putting forward policies that are so popular that the established Republican types and the moderate Republicans don't dare oppose it or they'll be swept away.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  That's right. Instead, they've tricked not just Trump, but the people under him into compromises that killed Trump with his base.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  But the word is Trump's going to turn back towards the nationalism, back towards his roots.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  Mike Cernovich, what's your intel?
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  Yeah, so we're actually, it was kind of funny.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  My sources have told me that you and Alex and Roger are going to be really happy.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  And I said, why? And he goes, well, I can't go too much into detail.
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  But what Trump has noticed is Trump goes, what happened to all those people on Twitter who loved me?
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  What happened? He called the savages, actually.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  He goes, what's going on with the savages and people didn't want to tell him right away.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  But he's figuring out that his media team is, they don't do anything.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  They're an effective spicer is a beta cock.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  He's afraid to confront the media, afraid to call them out, afraid to go in.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  And Trump didn't know why a hundred deep, he never saw positive comments or feedback that he loved because he doesn't know until people told him a week ago that Twitter is blocking all the positive comments.
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  I don't understand because here we have Steve Bannon, friend of mine, comes from the world of alt-media.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  Should understand this better than anyone, but no one has ever laid out for the president what Google and Facebook and Twitter and Amazon and Yahoo are doing.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  They're destroying his base.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  This is the most important issue. It is more important.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  And the good news is you, it's been brought up starting to get back to that. That's key.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  But by the way, can both of you, because we have like four hours tomorrow, it'd be great to have you for like an hour, Roger, and then starting for a whole hour with us.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  Would you love to just have those big segments tomorrow?
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  Works for me.
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  Mike, could you come on tomorrow?
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  Yeah, of course, it's always my pleasure.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  So I've, yeah, I've been told that Trump is, Bannon had to be real careful because if you watch what the media is doing, the media created, I was told by the highest level people.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  Asiop against Roger and Roger is right.
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  They knew, they knew that the document around Roger was coming out.
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  So they timed that Nixonian talking point.
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  They had to have a team of PhDs, people like Robert C. Eldini, they timed those talking points for the documentary because they then knew people would be Googling Roger Stone Nixon.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  So it was a very, very sophisticated coordinated signup.
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  I have been told that the Democrats have upped their game.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  They've actually brought in people who understand new media and that they told me they've leveled up and all of us, we better be prepared to fight like never before because they go, look, man, last year, you guys steamrolled them on social media.
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  They brought in whole teams of PhDs, awful research on everybody.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  And of course that's why people have to go to infowarstores.com because they're trying to crush us, man.
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  By the way, I haven't even plugged once in the last two hours, you know, that's how we fund ourselves because I just want to cover the info.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  It's so exciting to be breaking this down, but absolutely.
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  It's all over the news.
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  The algorithms Facebook, Google are trying to shut us down, blocking us everywhere, attacking us and trying to attack Trump and saying, kill him everywhere.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  I mean, this is beyond any movie or anything I ever fantasized about how despite everything they're doing, he's gotten most of his agenda done.
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  And then we're all sitting here bitching that he's not Jesus, you know, parting the Red Sea like Moses.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  And they actually have a list.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  This is evocative of the famous blacklist of the 1930s.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  But it's in reverse.
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  These are the people whose First Amendment rights must be crushed.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  Juanita Broderick, Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, Roger Stone, Tucker Carlson, whoever it may be.
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  It's extraordinary.
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  Yeah, I've been blacklisted actually a friend of mine who's a New York Times bestselling author said, hey, Cernovich, why don't you use a publisher for your book?
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  And I go, well, why don't you ask them?
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  So he talked to his book agent.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  His book agent said, oh, no, no, it's well known that Cernovich is blacklisted within the publishing industry because they know that he would sell so many books
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  that he would be on the New York Times number one on the list and they don't ever want to create celebrities.
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  But here's the good news.
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  We don't want to be celebrities.
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  We want to defeat tyranny, but we've got to be celebrities to do it, even though we're major targets.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  So now it's a do or die death battle, folks.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  I'll be destroyed.
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  Roger will be destroyed.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  You'll be destroyed.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  We'll all be destroyed if we don't win this.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  We've got to be all in.
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  So Roger Cernovich, all of you, how do we all in ourselves and how do the listeners get all in?
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  Well, the listeners by supporting you, you know, the infowars.com, the products that they buy, support it.
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  We need to put more people to work.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  This is another thing most people don't realize.
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  I've hung out with Dallas Jones.
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  I know Roger Stone.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  I know everybody.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  We're not living.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  We're not driving Ferraris.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  We're pushing our money back into the economy.
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  It's all about the war.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  But I mean, on top of that, though, people just spread the links.
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  That's exactly right.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  If you have a Twitter feed, if you have a Facebook feed, if you're on Instagram, if you're on Snapchat,
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  you're an army of one.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  Take the best stories off of them.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  Realize the most powerful forces of globalism are scared.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  They're spending billions to defeat you.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  We already beat them once in the election.
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  We're in a total battle.
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  They're doing everything they can to defeat our president.
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  We're going to win if you take action.
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  But yeah, people repost my videos.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  And I've had people say, Cernovich, why do you let people repost your videos?
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  And they monetize the videos on YouTube.
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  And I go, good, post my videos, monetize them, make money, just get the link out.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  You just want to win.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  My God, they're trying to get rid of the family.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  They hate Christians.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  They're with radical Muslims.
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  It's a death battle.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  They're a bunch of scum that know we're better than them because we're freedom lovers.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  Every race, color, and creed, they want to rape us.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  But let's be very clear.
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  While they have been destroying the country, they themselves have become very, very rich.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  They're parasites.
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  They think that that's what we're doing.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  We're not in this for the money.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  We're in this for the country.
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  Oh, I know.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  The globalists just keep asking, oh, I hear you're an actor that's fake.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  Can you work with us?
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  I'm like, dude, I'm not fake.
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  What are you talking about?
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  Yeah, we're true believers.
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  Like I said, we're not flying on private jets.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  We're not trying to.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  I'll say this.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  I hope we take the country back.
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  And everybody's incredibly wealthy.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  And we're all got spaceships.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  But it's not about wealth for us.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  It's not about the damn wealth.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  It's about defeating the NWO.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  And I'm telling the listeners, they are coming after everybody.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  And that's the thing about Trump.
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  I actually don't believe he's gotten this much done.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  But the good news is, I've heard it from my sources.
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  I've heard it from you.
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  I've heard it from Cernovich and all his sources.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  The word is, Trump is looking at taking his gloves off.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  So that's exciting.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  Closing comments on that.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  Because they have made the mistake of hitting him too hard.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  He started his presidency in a conciliatory way.
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  This is a guy who, while he was president-elect, he met with Al Sharpton.
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  He met with Al Gore.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  He was a counterpuncher.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  He reached out.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  And what did he get when he put out the olive branch to Hillary and said,
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  you know, maybe we shouldn't prosecute her?
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  Nothing.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  They went after him hammering Tong.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  So now he understands the gloves will be off.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  This is a fight to the finish.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  I can tell you this.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  Don't ever push Donald Trump into a corner.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  Don't push him into a corner.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  He is a fighter.
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  And so this is going to be the ultimate political battle for the future of civilization.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  We're here witnessing Cernovich.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  Oh, it's exciting.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  And that's what I tell people is that Trump knows now who the fighters are.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  Trump now knows you can't rely on Spicer.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  You can't rely on Priebus.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  You can rely on Roger Stone.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  Get me Roger Stone.
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  Get me Alex Jones.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  Get me Mike Cernovich.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  Get me the people who show up and want to fight hard every day.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  He's learning.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  So our profiles are going to rise even more.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  And like you say, it isn't because we want to be celebrities.
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  But in America, you have to be a celebrity to have any kind of-
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  We're just telling listeners, they've chosen us as the enemy.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  We're seen as the real opposition.
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  We need your full prayers.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  Number one, and we need to spread the links and financial support because they are destroying me right now.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  And I feel great.
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  I don't care.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  I'm going all the way to the end.
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  Whatever the cost may be.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  My grandfather's got shot at.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  Of course, Washington got shot at.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  I'm just politically getting attacked.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  But this is the real war, gentlemen.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  And their resources, Google's resources are unlimited.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  Unlimited.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  But they don't have the people.
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  They don't.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  If the people are with us, no one can stand against it.
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  And the people will be with us as long as we can communicate with them.
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  That's the whole key.
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  You want to win on immigration?
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  You want to win on trade?
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  You want to win on the economy?
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  Then you can't be censored.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  And finally, we're here.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  We're fighting.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  We're delivering.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  We're doing it.
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  Folks, become sponsors of our local affiliates.
