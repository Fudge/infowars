[00:00.000 --> 00:28.280]  We're going to start this transmission with a key report on Hillary launching a full
[00:28.280 --> 00:32.440]  out of salt of the second amendment by the way she's the front runner to win the presidency
[00:32.440 --> 00:38.840]  has got the Bilderberg nod then incredible Intel on every imaginable front coming up after the break
[00:42.840 --> 00:49.800]  it's Wednesday gentlemen a round of applause for Hillary Clinton speaking at the 83rd annual
[00:49.800 --> 00:55.720]  U.S. Conference of Mayors Saturday the former secretary of state said she supported President
[00:55.720 --> 01:01.160]  Obama's call to further infringe on the second amendment if it means it will help the victims
[01:01.160 --> 01:08.680]  of gun violence for me and many others one immediate response was to ask how it could be
[01:08.680 --> 01:16.680]  possible that we as a nation still allow guns to fall into the hands of people whose hearts are
[01:16.680 --> 01:25.800]  filled with hate you can't watch massacre after massacre and not come to the conclusion that as
[01:25.800 --> 01:33.560]  President Obama said we must tackle this challenge with urgency and conviction now I lived in
[01:33.560 --> 01:40.360]  Arkansas and I represented upstate New York I know that gun ownership is part of the fabric of a
[01:40.360 --> 01:50.280]  lot of law abiding communities but I also know that we can have common sense gun reforms that
[01:50.280 --> 01:57.080]  keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the violently unstable while respecting responsible
[01:57.080 --> 02:04.520]  gun owners what I hope with all of my heart is that we work together to make this debate less
[02:04.520 --> 02:13.880]  polarized less inflamed by ideology more informed by evidence so we can sit down across the table
[02:13.880 --> 02:20.440]  across the aisle from one another and find ways to keep our communities safe while protecting
[02:21.000 --> 02:29.800]  constitutional rights it makes no sense that bipartisan legislation to require universal
[02:29.800 --> 02:38.920]  background checks would fail in Congress despite overwhelming public support lies it makes no sense
[02:38.920 --> 02:45.160]  that we couldn't come together to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers you lie
[02:45.160 --> 02:52.760]  for people suffering from mental illnesses even people on the terrorist watch list that doesn't
[02:52.760 --> 03:01.960]  make sense and it is a rebuke to this nation we love and care about president is right the politics
[03:01.960 --> 03:11.000]  on this issue have been poisoned but we can't give up the stakes are too high the costs are too
[03:11.000 --> 03:19.320]  dear and I am not and will not be afraid to keep fighting for common sense reforms and along with
[03:19.320 --> 03:26.440]  you achieve those on behalf of all who have been lost because of this senseless gun violence in our
[03:26.440 --> 03:31.880]  country in the immediate aftermath of the shooting president obama and charleston mayor
[03:31.880 --> 03:38.040]  joseph p riley jr both rushed to issue statements demonizing the second amendment over the shooter's
[03:38.040 --> 03:45.560]  actions but let's be clear at some point we as a country will have to reckon with the fact
[03:45.560 --> 03:50.760]  that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries it doesn't happen
[03:51.320 --> 03:57.000]  in other places with this kind of frequency meanwhile black americans took to twitter and
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.000]  rallied around firearms the second amendment and the god given right to self defense declaring a
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.520]  call to arms and rejection of the white supremacist ideology candidate clinton first made her
[04:08.520 --> 04:14.920]  anti-gun stance clear in april asserting we cannot let a minority of people and that's what it is
[04:14.920 --> 04:20.840]  it is a minority of people hold a viewpoint that terrorizes the majority of the people
[04:20.840 --> 04:26.600]  and now from the first comment for this article from john smith hey killery you want common sense
[04:26.600 --> 04:33.480]  gun reform how about not sending guns to isis how about not sending guns to mexican drug dealers
[04:33.480 --> 04:45.800]  how about stopping senseless wars now that's gun reform i can live with john bound for info wars.com

[09:01.000 --> 09:06.440]  we also have a lady joining us a journalist joining us has been going out and documenting
[09:06.440 --> 09:11.080]  some of the bizarre activities of so-called feminist and the totalitarianism that they're
[09:11.080 --> 09:18.440]  promoting the big story today is not what's happening with the confederate battle flag
[09:21.000 --> 09:29.000]  it's what's going on with the new fear mongering by the eugenicist by the exterminist
[09:30.360 --> 09:37.800]  that the earth is dying right now and the answer is basically forcibly reducing human populations
[09:37.800 --> 09:44.360]  and there's a story out of the washington post earth is on the brink of six mass extinction
[09:44.360 --> 09:50.120]  scientists say and it's humans fault we first covered this when in broken england on sunday
[09:50.920 --> 09:59.640]  reporting on the u.s. government funded studies now what they didn't tell the public in the bbc or
[09:59.640 --> 10:10.360]  the washington post was that paul r. earlick who co-authored with john p. holdren and his wife anne h
[10:10.920 --> 10:20.840]  earlick wrote in 1974 the year i was born eco science where they talk about putting fluoride
[10:20.840 --> 10:30.440]  in the water to dumb you down and to reduce your fertility i mean they're quite public this book
[10:30.440 --> 10:34.440]  was much of the current globalist plan and then a projection forward
[10:38.280 --> 10:42.440]  and of course everything it predicts in the book about the people bomb and total collapse
[10:42.440 --> 10:49.240]  by 2000 didn't happen now a lot of things humans are doing from my research is unsustainable
[10:49.240 --> 10:55.480]  the problem is these guys are greasing the skids while posing as the saviors and they actually
[10:55.480 --> 11:02.600]  hate humanity and want to have a downfall they want to watch rome burn and a lot of yuppies that have
[11:02.600 --> 11:09.560]  never a lot of trendies who've never really been through a crisis never been through adversity
[11:10.120 --> 11:14.840]  who've been so sheltered and shielded kind of think it's cute and go well yeah society is going
[11:14.840 --> 11:21.560]  to collapse and yes humanity is a parasite and it's all over and of course we have to reduce
[11:21.560 --> 11:27.080]  population but they don't want to reduce their standard of living they don't want to be killed
[11:27.880 --> 11:31.560]  and they'll lecture you all day about a confederate battle flag and how
[11:31.560 --> 11:37.720]  it's the ultimate evil and we've got to worry about people's feelings it just doesn't congruently
[11:37.720 --> 11:43.400]  connect together if they were concerned about dehumanization worldwide slavery being worse than
[11:43.400 --> 11:48.840]  it was in numbers 200 years ago if they were concerned about all these type of issues
[11:52.200 --> 11:57.000]  then if they got on a high horse about the confederate flag and said it was hurtful to them
[11:57.000 --> 12:04.840]  i'd probably listen but it's only about creating division and rubbing salt in the wounds and then
[12:05.400 --> 12:10.440]  i'd remembered this and sure enough steve watson found it when clinton ran for governor and was
[12:10.440 --> 12:14.840]  governor and then when he ran for president and then when hillary ran they used battle flags
[12:15.400 --> 12:23.960]  all over the south as their bumper stickers i mean it is the democratic party that founded the clan
[12:25.640 --> 12:32.520]  and yeah thomas jefferson found the democratic party and so now there's calls to
[12:32.520 --> 12:39.160]  you remove statues of thomas jefferson and to take him off the money
[12:40.840 --> 12:46.520]  so i'm going to cover this now but only because it's a way to get people to understand outside
[12:46.520 --> 12:51.800]  of the rhetoric outside of coke versus pepsi cowboys versus the steelers ford versus chevy
[12:52.440 --> 12:56.680]  it's not you're either for the battle flag you're against the battle flag that's a diversion
[12:56.680 --> 13:02.200]  overall and a gimmick in and of itself but when you see where the agenda is going then it becomes
[13:02.200 --> 13:07.240]  clear it's about censorship of speech across the board and really draconian attacks on the first
[13:07.240 --> 13:13.800]  amendment i said this yesterday i'm not saying he stole it from me because we're on at the very same
[13:13.800 --> 13:21.720]  time but rush limbaugh said what i said yesterday and what i said the day before the american flag
[13:21.720 --> 13:27.720]  is next because in its name a lot of bad stuff's been done and there have been more slaves under
[13:27.720 --> 13:36.200]  that flag than whereas under the confederacy but before i get into all this news and ebay and
[13:36.200 --> 13:39.960]  amazon and walmart all of them you know pulling the different variants of it
[13:42.520 --> 13:47.800]  it's just important to understand that if you really study history and and this is 101
[13:50.600 --> 13:54.440]  when you go take history classes that aren't just politically correct propaganda
[13:54.440 --> 14:00.120]  and most of them are now but in old school history the most important thing to do is to
[14:00.120 --> 14:06.520]  research who the people were in their time and what they stood for it's easy in 2015 to look at
[14:06.520 --> 14:15.400]  george washington thomas jefferson born into southern plantation families that was the culture
[14:15.400 --> 14:22.520]  tobacco cotton you name it and to then say look these were horrible people it doesn't matter if
[14:22.520 --> 14:29.720]  upon their deaths they freed their slaves doesn't matter if jefferson basically went native you could
[14:29.720 --> 14:35.640]  say and was you know literally there were different types of slave owners operating there was the
[14:35.640 --> 14:39.480]  jango style people are getting beat all day and then there's the completely other style and the
[14:39.480 --> 14:43.960]  more successful plantations it was just like sharecroppers in fact they were in historians
[14:43.960 --> 14:49.720]  french historians said they were in better shape than the white sharecroppers that's not endorsing
[14:49.720 --> 14:59.640]  any of it it's that our nation's identity is not two percent of the north and the south having
[14:59.640 --> 15:07.400]  slaves two percent of the population our culture is not about obsessing and opening these wounds
[15:07.400 --> 15:13.880]  up constantly has the rebel flag been used by haters and scum and their duels absolutely
[15:13.880 --> 15:23.080]  but gangs in oakland california that go around killing people like to wear raiders jerseys
[15:26.440 --> 15:30.360]  i'll never forget i was like 21 wasn't even really a raiders fan i needed a ball cap
[15:31.080 --> 15:34.680]  and i was at one of those sporting stores so that's a cool black and white hat i'll wear a
[15:34.680 --> 15:42.760]  raiders hat and it was the only time i ever had cops come up to me and i was 21 had already
[15:42.760 --> 15:48.360]  started my radio show what was some friends to play pool at a bar and i had an off-duty like i
[15:48.360 --> 15:52.120]  was playing clothes on off duty cop come over and asked me if i was in a game
[15:55.000 --> 15:59.160]  and i guess maybe it was racism because some of the folks we were with were hispanic and black
[15:59.160 --> 16:03.000]  and i was wearing a 49ers hat and i said why do you say that he goes well it's a
[16:04.680 --> 16:10.920]  i'm not a 49ers a raiders hat i don't even follow football anymore he said well a that's a raiders
[16:10.920 --> 16:16.760]  hat and b you've got it on backwards and i said well i'm inside but that's an example right there
[16:16.760 --> 16:24.920]  because gangs use a raiders hat or i guess in chicago gangs wear bull's hats for basketball
[16:24.920 --> 16:31.400]  are we then gonna ban it i mean it's it's just ridiculous but it shows how in an incredibly
[16:31.400 --> 16:39.480]  dumbed-down culture this is all the public knows is how to be offended and how to get upset about
[16:39.480 --> 16:47.080]  brown bags in seattle that the city three years ago said don't bring brown bags it might be offensive
[16:47.640 --> 16:53.880]  and i looked it up no one had ever said a brown bag was code for racism no one had ever even imagined
[16:53.880 --> 16:59.880]  it it was like looking at clouds and you know seeing a swastika and saying ban that cloud it
[16:59.880 --> 17:06.200]  looks like a swastika or or a pentagram i mean it's just schizophrenia but the power structure
[17:06.200 --> 17:13.720]  here isn't schizophrenic they want us to only be able to obsess all day long
[17:16.760 --> 17:23.400]  over words and to be offended and then to be managed by the media like a bunch of basket cases
[17:24.120 --> 17:30.040]  it's mental illness so leon mackard he already had the idea this morning when i came in and
[17:30.040 --> 17:34.920]  she was already going to do it she's going down to ut and down to the uh hygen bike trail today
[17:34.920 --> 17:43.320]  to call for george washington statue at ut and thomas jefferson statues uh at the uh
[17:44.280 --> 17:52.360]  statehouse to be pulled down and i guarantee a 60 70 of people i would guess are going to sign it
[17:53.320 --> 18:00.440]  because well it's hurtful george washington owned slaves well it's hurtful thomas jefferson
[18:00.440 --> 18:05.960]  had quote slaves yeah and in germany at the time most of the country was in different sections
[18:05.960 --> 18:12.200]  it wasn't even called germany then the host of germanic kingdoms the people there were slaves
[18:12.200 --> 18:19.880]  the hessian soldiers we fought were raised from birth to be soldiers and were owned by the state
[18:21.640 --> 18:25.640]  germans today don't even really know that or care because it wasn't drummed into them an
[18:25.640 --> 18:31.400]  identity that they're a slave they're a victim something's wrong with them over and over again
[18:31.400 --> 18:39.400]  for political gain so in the context of this this is how they bring the country down this is how
[18:39.400 --> 18:45.720]  they divide everybody while the big offshore central banks get obama care passed to destroy
[18:45.720 --> 18:51.240]  our health care increase our prices establish computerized control taking doctors out of the
[18:51.240 --> 19:00.040]  decision-making process we're being conquered under the tpp that's set to pass today in the senate
[19:01.400 --> 19:08.040]  think about that the tpp putting us under a secret shadowy group and then congress's laws
[19:08.040 --> 19:14.440]  there on out have to comply with it the conquering of our nation that's not rhetoric that's what it
[19:14.440 --> 19:22.520]  is it's breathtaking as senator sessions said and it's not in the news all we're hearing about is
[19:22.520 --> 19:28.200]  every week or so it looks like cops shoot a black man in the back and every week i see three or four
[19:28.200 --> 19:32.840]  articles with a shoot a white guy in the back there's a lot of crazy bad cops out there is there
[19:32.840 --> 19:38.360]  some racism towards blacks probably the point is it's not the whole universe we can have an
[19:38.360 --> 19:42.120]  asteroid coming towards the planet to kill us and i'm convinced we just obsess all day about
[19:42.120 --> 19:48.680]  what color we are because this is our culture our culture is in fighting it's manying uh it's it's
[19:48.680 --> 19:54.680]  identity politics it's gang mentality it's the same way the globalist managed prisons by putting
[19:54.680 --> 20:01.880]  people in racial gangs it's divide and conquer stay with us it's time to build your own emergency

[20:59.400 --> 21:04.920]  it's very easy to be a criminal all you need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool
[21:04.920 --> 21:10.120]  a pair of scissors if your home security system can be compromised by a criminal using scissors
[21:10.120 --> 21:15.560]  then you're making it easy for them almost every home security system even though sold by big name
[21:15.560 --> 21:21.880]  companies has a weakness the phone line you shell out 1500 bucks get locked into a long-term contract

[24:09.880 --> 24:15.160]  welcome back i'm your host Alex Jones i'm going to get into the Atlantic article the world without
[24:15.160 --> 24:20.600]  work facing out of humans they're now making all the announcements that we warned you about 18 years
[24:20.600 --> 24:27.720]  ago 15 years ago it's now following the plan we need to come together against the globalist program
[24:27.720 --> 24:34.360]  develop a culture that's pro-human to build a world for people not just for a tiny group of
[24:34.360 --> 24:41.320]  globalists that are enslaving all of us in the technocracy right now but before i get into all
[24:41.320 --> 24:46.680]  the latest on the confederate flag the battle flag the rest of it let me give you a condensed
[24:46.680 --> 24:52.120]  gestalt short history lesson if you're a new listener and just think that i'm desperate to
[24:52.120 --> 24:57.240]  keep rebel flags flying when personally i could care less and know a lot of times it's been
[24:57.240 --> 25:03.560]  expropriated by ne'er-do-wells and racists and you name it so i get both sides of it but
[25:03.560 --> 25:08.920]  where it's coming from is to restrict free speech and to set the precedent but let me just give you
[25:08.920 --> 25:19.240]  a gestalt 600 years ago the western world was still in the dark ages okay and then the printing
[25:19.240 --> 25:25.240]  press got developed small guilds got developed a small middle class got developed the royalty
[25:25.240 --> 25:32.520]  and the church lost its monopoly on control and the renaissance began it wasn't till the 1880s
[25:32.520 --> 25:41.960]  that the last german serfs that just means slave they were slaves were released they were slaves to
[25:41.960 --> 25:46.920]  the land and if you tried to run off they would come and arrest you and say you hadn't paid your
[25:46.920 --> 25:52.680]  bills and put you in the stocks till you died in many cases and the media always when you raise
[25:52.680 --> 25:56.200]  that goes you're taking away from black slaver because that's how they keep the country divided
[25:56.200 --> 26:02.040]  no i'm not i'm simply stating the facts that it's a shared human condition of most of our
[26:02.040 --> 26:09.160]  ancestors were slaves and i think it's embarrassing if you're related to royalty i mean there are
[26:09.160 --> 26:12.920]  probably 10 million people are more in the united states that came from england that are related to
[26:12.920 --> 26:17.640]  some royal house or not i mean i'm related to a whole bunch of them i i'm embarrassed about those
[26:17.640 --> 26:23.960]  connections to the tutors and other people and of course it's tenuous and i don't really care
[26:23.960 --> 26:28.920]  the point is is that people are proud of that i'm not really proud of that it's interesting
[26:28.920 --> 26:33.400]  i'm proud of ancestors that i had that stood up against tyranny and
[26:35.160 --> 26:40.840]  the pinnacle of the renaissance was 240 years ago at this country where they almost banned
[26:40.840 --> 26:45.480]  slavery at the continental congress but the south threatened to leave because it was their only
[26:45.480 --> 26:53.800]  industry and the rich landowners had leveraged the wages down against 98 that didn't have slaves
[26:53.800 --> 26:59.400]  so slavery was a very bad institution for everybody except the plantation owners and
[26:59.400 --> 27:06.360]  you bet george washington and thomas jefferson were born into that but they were great men who
[27:06.360 --> 27:12.200]  tried to help end it and who then put out ideas that were the greatest level of freedom the world
[27:12.200 --> 27:18.280]  had ever seen that's the new model the old models what we're going into right now where everybody's
[27:18.280 --> 27:23.160]  in their own little gang group that's how they divided rome up was into ethnic groups the greeks
[27:23.160 --> 27:31.560]  and the roman quarter and that's how they had it divided the gall quarter the germanic quarter
[27:31.560 --> 27:37.480]  the austria goth area that's how they divided it all up and they used it to control people within
[27:37.480 --> 27:45.320]  the city of rome itself so i've studied just so much history it it gives me a headache to sit back
[27:45.320 --> 27:50.040]  and watch the public groping around in the dark not having any idea how this stuff really works
[27:50.040 --> 27:57.400]  and to know that at the very end of the civil war when the south was collapsing and was already
[27:57.400 --> 28:02.760]  defeated basically but wouldn't give up the amounts of pace and proclamation came out and
[28:02.760 --> 28:10.040]  still took months to get down to the folks that were slaves and it was done to further destabilize
[28:11.240 --> 28:19.240]  and cause a breakdown and that's what was done and it's on record and it's just a fraud it's a
[28:19.240 --> 28:27.560]  hoax like saying obama cares free to say that the civil war was about a bunch of white supremacists
[28:29.960 --> 28:37.640]  it's just not true and now they've had the alabama governor come out and order all the
[28:37.640 --> 28:43.000]  battle flags taken down off the capital he's a republican and you know what i find that fitting
[28:43.000 --> 28:50.200]  because it was the republicans that sacked the south for 10 years under reconstruction
[28:50.760 --> 28:54.680]  it was the republicans by the way that did vote pass the voting rights act and all the rest of it
[28:54.680 --> 29:01.160]  but see in the flip-flop upside down world they're the ones that get blamed uh with uh being the clan
[29:01.160 --> 29:05.960]  and all the rest of this just like the nra is being called the new clan and there's new articles
[29:05.960 --> 29:13.480]  out today with msnbc saying the confederacy was for the second amendment what let me tell you the
[29:13.480 --> 29:19.240]  real racism against blacks accelerated after the civil war when the north came in and had real
[29:19.240 --> 29:25.080]  elections and put black folks in government and then it was the working class poor whites that
[29:25.080 --> 29:30.760]  felt bad and they were the ones that then really gravitated into racism as their new identity
[29:30.760 --> 29:35.800]  and that's when all the clan and the rest of it gets started but that's real history not the
[29:35.800 --> 29:42.200]  garbage that we're taught i'm going to go over some more of these articles when we come back
[29:42.200 --> 29:47.000]  hillary clinton on course to win presidential election poll says then i'm going to tie that into
[29:47.000 --> 29:54.200]  the real threats we all face we're on the march the empires stories on fours dot com alex jones
[29:54.200 --> 30:04.440]  and the gcn radio network since 1949 the u.s department of agriculture has been demanding
[30:04.440 --> 30:10.360]  a portion of california's raisin crop without payment from the farmers they gave some to schools
[30:10.360 --> 30:18.520]  some they sold and kept the money in 2002 farmers were told to hand over 89 000 tons of raisins 30
[30:18.520 --> 30:26.040]  percent of their raisin crop medieval serfs typically paid only 10 in taxes rarely more than 15
[30:26.040 --> 30:32.520]  percent the federal government treats americans worse than medieval serfs but when one farm family
[30:32.520 --> 30:41.720]  refused the usda sued them for the value of the raisins 480 000 plus a penalty of 200 000 the supreme

[33:18.040 --> 33:27.480]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:27.480 --> 33:49.080]  this morning when i woke up at about 5 30 a.m it really hit me hard the conviction on my heart
[33:49.080 --> 33:57.240]  on my intellect to really try to give a powerful speech from my heart
[34:00.200 --> 34:08.200]  to the listening audience out there really a call to arms politically in the information war
[34:09.160 --> 34:15.720]  to truly warn humanity and to cut through the den of distractions and diversions that are out there
[34:15.720 --> 34:26.200]  to try to galvanize some type of core emergency beacon so this things get worse and worse
[34:27.160 --> 34:30.360]  for our species we understand why it's happening
[34:34.200 --> 34:38.040]  because all the rest of this news really is just window dressing
[34:38.040 --> 34:51.480]  when you understand the core driving goals and the mindset of the planetary scientific
[34:51.480 --> 35:10.360]  elite and what their goals are they're on total power trips they are able to take our resources
[35:10.360 --> 35:21.880]  that are basically unlimited and construct parallel civilizations that are secret from the public
[35:21.880 --> 35:36.200]  and then to watch them engage in systematic brainwashing and wrecking the human psyche
[35:36.200 --> 35:46.200]  and scuttling our societies it's mind blowing simply put on this whole race obsession issue
[35:46.200 --> 35:52.280]  that's used all over the world in balkanization and divide and conquer the public in this nation
[35:52.280 --> 35:58.600]  has gone from the most literate in reading writing and arithmetic and business and innovation
[35:58.600 --> 36:08.760]  and exploration americans were the crème de la crème the best of the best and that wasn't
[36:08.760 --> 36:16.920]  us historians saying that we were exceptional because we were wild wild west and that brings
[36:16.920 --> 36:24.760]  out the best in people there weren't any freeloaders there weren't folks putting up with scammers
[36:24.760 --> 36:29.720]  criminals had to live out in the bush because folks were hunting them down
[36:31.400 --> 36:35.560]  compared to every other culture it was rough
[36:38.120 --> 36:43.480]  and it produced so much strength and so much wealth and so much innovation and power the
[36:43.480 --> 36:48.600]  world marveled now we are the dumbest of the industrialized world behind a whole bunch of
[36:48.600 --> 36:57.080]  third world countries the language is shrinking the iq itself is physically going down i'm going
[36:57.080 --> 37:05.960]  to get into why but we're experts on hundreds of different trendy groups and weird cultural
[37:05.960 --> 37:20.920]  basically religious dogmas based on guilt this country is a nitting basket case mentally ill
[37:20.920 --> 37:28.200]  wreck we got something like a third the population on mind-bending prescription drugs
[37:28.200 --> 37:37.480]  the family is redlining falling apart across the board diabetes is up almost three thousand
[37:37.480 --> 37:42.600]  percent type two something like five thousand percent in hispanics cancer is up depending
[37:42.600 --> 37:49.480]  on the cancer some types for up tenfold like lung cancer and women i mean we are under massive
[37:50.760 --> 37:56.200]  attack it's designed and the globalist right books i'm going to get into at the moment bragging
[37:56.200 --> 38:00.840]  about it it's twilight zone meets the outer limits meets
[38:03.160 --> 38:09.800]  thx 1138 meets brave new world meets 1984 it's like a dagwood sandwich just just layer after
[38:09.800 --> 38:19.640]  layer of of every sickening technocratic mind control program all laid on top of each other
[38:19.640 --> 38:28.760]  in the most well orchestrated abomination the world's ever seen i mean the globalist are going
[38:28.760 --> 38:34.600]  for broke they understand they'll never be able to conquer the planet until they conquer humans
[38:35.720 --> 38:41.560]  the elite believe they are a different species than us look it up and they're attaining godhood
[38:41.560 --> 38:50.280]  as we speak and then we've got to be killed in this holy jihad crusade that they've launched
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.240]  and yes that's over the top epic and it's true
[38:55.960 --> 39:01.000]  and we've got addled people out there thinking they're doing goody tissues work pulling down
[39:01.000 --> 39:11.320]  rebel flags and banning the sale of rebel flags on platforms everywhere as if a school might not
[39:11.320 --> 39:18.120]  want one for an educational thing or a or a museum europe's ban the sale of nazi paraphernalia
[39:20.840 --> 39:26.440]  i remember being like 18 at a gun show i bought a pocket knife an raf pen and a nazi pen because
[39:26.440 --> 39:32.120]  i thought they were interesting i was a kid i had army tanks with german symbols on them
[39:32.120 --> 39:37.880]  and the allies i mean i was a nazi i mean it's it's i almost bought a civil war southern sword
[39:37.880 --> 39:43.320]  once it was too expensive that those go for a lot more because there were less of them so
[39:43.320 --> 39:48.920]  i bought a northern sword i've got a northern saber and those things are so they're like those
[39:48.920 --> 39:53.160]  deals you use to cut paper back in school but they're longer and they're so heavy they would just
[39:53.160 --> 40:04.600]  cut through anything but this is the mental illness where we're experts on obsessing on
[40:04.600 --> 40:16.840]  everything that doesn't matter and now the un wants urgent measures to control guns after charleston
[40:16.840 --> 40:26.040]  killings and they use these events where oh our hearts are hurt oh black christians got killed
[40:26.040 --> 40:30.600]  and that's why all these republicans now are pulling down the flags and coming out and apologizing
[40:30.600 --> 40:36.040]  and saying on the news i thought it was about pride and how the south fought so hard but
[40:36.040 --> 40:43.720]  i apologize it's bad because people like to repent even of things they haven't done
[40:45.080 --> 40:50.360]  good people do and the bad people sit there poking and manipulating good people
[40:51.400 --> 40:56.440]  who think they're doing something nice that's full of hospitality it's not about hospitality
[40:56.440 --> 41:02.200]  it's about being conquered to where only what the system says is acceptable is acceptable
[41:03.080 --> 41:09.000]  while the media sells it as trendy and fun and happy hey robots are replacing you hey your
[41:09.000 --> 41:16.680]  computer is watching and listening to you but it's fun we went out yesterday in front of google
[41:16.680 --> 41:20.600]  downtown austin and i was told i haven't seen the video yet the reporter will be ready for the
[41:20.600 --> 41:28.600]  nightly news tonight i'll play it tomorrow or day but night will i'm going to my cousin's wedding and
[41:33.240 --> 41:38.040]  the vast majority of them said yeah i want driverless cars and i don't care if i can't
[41:38.040 --> 41:42.360]  drive anymore they're ready to submit now you gotta go to trendy areas to do this
[41:43.720 --> 41:49.880]  but you notice wherever google puts down a carcinogenic tentacle it's all surrounded by
[41:49.880 --> 41:55.320]  like colors and trendy paypal with different colored socks killing i'm not threatening i'm
[41:55.320 --> 42:01.480]  not threatening i'm not threatening don't run where your friends when it is already an ai system
[42:01.480 --> 42:09.800]  gobbling everything up and building a world on record that is designed for the orderly removal
[42:09.800 --> 42:17.960]  of humanity and almost all of their crew members aren't even paid and they've got degrees i mean
[42:17.960 --> 42:24.200]  the whole system was set up for this down on second street in austin texas there's a shot of it
[42:26.200 --> 42:31.640]  if you're a tv viewer and it's all plushy couches and you know everything you get to come in and
[42:32.200 --> 42:37.800]  oh yes driverless cars are rolling around meanwhile working for the nsa hacking your
[42:37.800 --> 42:42.920]  computer stealing your data cameras and microphones watching you but it's okay they have adult slides
[42:42.920 --> 42:49.160]  adults can act like kids too it's right act like a child who's ignorant and he'll get in the van
[42:50.520 --> 42:55.160]  because google's got free candy when you go over they got free cupcakes and free candy
[42:56.200 --> 43:04.120]  and a bar and basketball and it's come on in we're not threatening we're not threatening
[43:04.680 --> 43:10.200]  really it's the equivalent of an alien mothership that landed and listen you're all gonna find out
[43:10.200 --> 43:15.240]  okay the decision has been made to wipe you and your family out as soon as the grid's in place
[43:15.240 --> 43:22.600]  we're all dead and you will see it all unfold and you will see them ban the american flag
[43:23.320 --> 43:29.160]  and you will see them ban single home dwellings as germany's now doing you will see them ban
[43:29.160 --> 43:33.160]  fireplaces you will have computers in your house that watch everything you do
[43:33.160 --> 43:39.480]  and lovingly tell you when you're doing bad things in a very soft non-threatening voice
[43:42.360 --> 43:43.400]  and if you try to resist
[43:46.360 --> 43:51.960]  drone attack helicopters will come and blow you off the road but it won't matter because your car
[43:51.960 --> 43:57.720]  will be hardwired where it's driverless most new cars are already driverless they already have the
[43:57.720 --> 44:03.000]  programs the software the cars already break and stop they'll already kill you uh if it means it'll
[44:03.000 --> 44:08.040]  save a school bus they claim but they're just going to start rolling it out and announcing it
[44:08.040 --> 44:12.280]  that oh discounts on your insurance if you go driverless i'm talking with them like three four
[44:12.280 --> 44:24.840]  years everything is compacted at the end already they're phasing the drones to fully autonomous
[44:24.840 --> 44:31.720]  they decide when to kill people and see that means that when the troops refuse to follow
[44:31.720 --> 44:39.160]  an order to kill innocent people it won't matter because the computers will be doing it the robots
[44:39.160 --> 44:48.360]  will be doing it this is the plan but don't worry cnn hosts suggest taking down racist
[44:48.360 --> 44:55.000]  jefferson statue video on info wars dot com we knew that was next un wants urgent measures to
[44:55.000 --> 45:01.160]  control guns after charleston killings hillary clinton on course to win presidential election
[45:01.160 --> 45:06.760]  poll says and coming up the next hour you gotta listen to what she says she made a chilling statement
[45:06.760 --> 45:13.000]  we heard the video and audio at the start of the show today in the john bound report titled hitlary
[45:13.000 --> 45:21.320]  watches all out attack on second amendment and she says you know it's not reasonable
[45:21.320 --> 45:29.400]  we've got people on the terrorists no fly list that are able to get guns and it sounds reasonable
[45:29.400 --> 45:33.800]  yeah you're on a terror watch list but see it's not really called a terror watch list it's called a
[45:33.800 --> 45:40.840]  no fly list last time we got numbers it was three million people it was one million and three million
[45:40.840 --> 45:47.480]  people on the don't fly or watch list and then rama manual comes out when obama was running for
[45:47.480 --> 45:54.680]  office and said if you're on that don't fly list you lose your second amendment see no judge no jury
[45:54.680 --> 46:00.280]  no indictment no charges you don't get a gun and you don't know how or why and you can't get off the
[46:00.280 --> 46:06.120]  list we had an election about change people are clear about the special interest they are tired of
[46:06.120 --> 46:11.560]  that gridlock the special interest caused in washington and i think the most simple thing we can do
[46:11.560 --> 46:15.960]  and we've got to make this a number one issue as a test vote and then take it into the election
[46:16.760 --> 46:22.600]  that is if you are on the no fly list because you are known as maybe a possible terrorist
[46:22.600 --> 46:31.960]  you cannot buy a handgun in america key word because you're known maybe to be a possible terrorist
[46:31.960 --> 46:37.800]  and last time i heard it was like 14 or 15 members of congress were on the no fly list
[46:39.000 --> 46:45.160]  my dad was on it because he has a common name david jones three million people
[46:46.200 --> 46:50.280]  and they've never caught one terrorist with the tsa because it's not designed for that it's there
[46:50.280 --> 47:00.440]  to break your will and train you to be a slave and hillary again said in her speech yesterday
[47:00.440 --> 47:04.840]  about the second amendment she said we need to do what ron emmanuel called for they're coming
[47:06.200 --> 47:10.680]  and now they're saying again guns are racist remember that talking point gun ownership is racist
[47:12.840 --> 47:15.560]  we come back i'm gonna try to be as succinct as i can
[47:19.400 --> 47:25.720]  it was so clear this morning when i wanted to say to the public i almost shot a video at
[47:25.720 --> 47:32.120]  five thirty in the morning i really was on fire i woke up jumped out of bed which is such a sense
[47:32.120 --> 47:49.880]  of urgency man i am i am just beside myself the decision has been made to end our species as we
[47:49.880 --> 47:57.160]  know it i horribly wicked horribly anti-human people and they know how to tribally stir us
[47:57.160 --> 48:01.480]  all up against each other just like a prison warden manages things by putting people in the
[48:01.480 --> 48:07.400]  in racial groups and then pretty soon you've got to because you've primed the pump that's how it's
[48:07.400 --> 48:15.720]  all based and they've got the nerve while they divide and conquer us to sit around and talk about
[48:15.720 --> 48:25.960]  how they love us but folks are going to decide which side they're on i need to create a tax-free
[48:25.960 --> 48:34.360]  foundation or organization that educates the public and puts out flyers and does email campaigns
[48:34.360 --> 48:39.960]  and puts up billboards that just directs people to a website that shows the globalist master plan
[48:39.960 --> 48:45.480]  in say 10 easy videos and how they're planning to end humanity as we know it with all their quotes
[48:46.760 --> 48:52.200]  and just basically call it the choice and the human defense league or the human defense core
[48:53.320 --> 49:00.280]  or the human defense force and just because this is an attack on everybody i don't care what color
[49:00.280 --> 49:05.800]  you are this is the end of humanity i mean our dna is unraveling right now by design third
[49:05.800 --> 49:11.160]  generation mammals under gmo are almost completely sterile and completely mentally retarded those are
[49:11.160 --> 49:18.840]  the ones that live organs growing on the outside of our bodies just just just you know so they're not
[49:18.840 --> 49:24.760]  just killing us individually they're killing the species as if they are an alien race folks it's the
[49:24.760 --> 49:30.200]  only way to describe the globalist they might as well be i mean i've said this hundreds of times it
[49:30.200 --> 49:34.600]  it's it is so over the top
[49:40.600 --> 49:46.920]  and it's all rolling out right now i have trouble even breathing when i really
[49:48.120 --> 49:54.520]  when i really face all the intel it's just such a bad situation but it's so
[49:54.520 --> 49:59.560]  insane if people can just admit it and know what's happening and become alerted to it
[50:00.840 --> 50:06.760]  we can avert it and turn the tables so i have time i'm going to skip this network break but it's
[50:06.760 --> 50:11.320]  going to be the last of the week david night can't skip any tomorrow the next day i'm just because
[50:11.320 --> 50:16.360]  i've done too many and and and we've got a bunch of special reports they're going to be airing
[50:16.360 --> 50:21.400]  tomorrow david's got a bunch of great informative guests coming on he does a wonderful job it's
[50:21.400 --> 50:28.520]  a real blessing to be able to work with him and other reporters but i care about my fellow humans
[50:30.440 --> 50:42.120]  and i know i'm right about all this but to know that it was worse than we thought and that it's all true
[50:45.480 --> 50:50.120]  i mean it takes a lot of will to put hydrofluorosalic acid in the water knowing it lowers IQ and
[50:50.120 --> 50:56.120]  all sorts of cancers it takes a lot of will to design stacked traits in the major gmo's that
[50:56.840 --> 51:03.400]  are designed to pass foreign dna and rna into the genetic code and the scientists are looking
[51:03.400 --> 51:07.960]  at it now and they're saying it's like this was designed to destroy the dna well yeah it was
[51:09.800 --> 51:14.440]  i don't know why the elite would want to wreck human dna itself unless they were an alien species
[51:14.440 --> 51:19.000]  shin here and some deals been made to wipe us all out and again i'm not saying it's aliens
[51:19.000 --> 51:24.280]  it's just the more i look at it man it's so bad what does the bible say it's an interdimensional
[51:24.280 --> 51:30.040]  entity that wants to kill god's creation humans it's the devil i mean i i don't know what else
[51:30.040 --> 51:35.800]  to tell you folks is that is that we've got to come to realization that whether it's archetypal
[51:37.080 --> 51:38.760]  interdimensional that would be spiritual
[51:41.240 --> 51:45.720]  the angels didn't know about dimensions that's what it is something from another dimension
[51:45.720 --> 51:51.400]  you read the bible the old testament that's what it says that they they come out
[51:53.800 --> 52:00.680]  of another realm and they want to kill us and then i'm like oh yeah right maybe the
[52:00.680 --> 52:04.920]  atheists are true maybe they're ridden to god everybody has those doubts in their life and
[52:04.920 --> 52:09.160]  the older i get the more i study it and the bohemian grove and sculling bones and the devil
[52:09.160 --> 52:14.600]  worship and wanting to grab little kids and torture them to death i mean whatever it is
[52:14.600 --> 52:20.200]  it's evil it's bad it's gotta be opposed and it's got us all fighting with each other you know how
[52:20.200 --> 52:25.800]  much the liberals love black people that's the ones they can't abort and they'll pull on our
[52:25.800 --> 52:31.960]  heartstrings and manipulate good people to want to do what they say forget the rebel flag whether
[52:31.960 --> 52:42.440]  it's good or bad or a mix it's about we do what they say they're the boss it's about they culturally
[52:42.440 --> 52:49.400]  are the police the commasars the aparatics
[52:52.840 --> 52:56.920]  and when i get around these globalists and their minions they know they're evil
[52:56.920 --> 53:03.160]  they enjoy the raw power and they hate instinctively at a spiritual level virtuous people
[53:07.000 --> 53:11.400]  they hate people that have good will that want to help others that want to build
[53:11.400 --> 53:15.480]  and they manipulate us to serve them by claiming they are the great
[53:15.480 --> 53:23.720]  priest and priestesses the anointed ones that we must all follow and they're all total hypocrites
[53:29.080 --> 53:33.800]  and they have adopted the most evil sinister plan they could their public argument is
[53:33.800 --> 53:40.600]  oh it's total evil to block the greater evil of non-control and after we bring in total control
[53:40.600 --> 53:46.840]  using evil we're going to remove all the evil and restore balance and create a utopia bull
[53:46.840 --> 53:51.720]  you're going to keep going on doing horrible things because it's what your father does and
[53:51.720 --> 54:02.120]  you're of your father the devil i had a six hour dream last night from the time i went to bed when
[54:02.120 --> 54:07.640]  i woke up at 5 30 that was the most vivid of my lifetime i can only describe it as a vision
[54:07.640 --> 54:12.360]  of the future you could say scientifically it's what my brain with all the study has
[54:12.920 --> 54:18.200]  basically postulated my god you know i i didn't know you could have such nightmares
[54:19.400 --> 54:27.320]  i mean it was like 20 years of observations seeing things it was unbelievable i i i i
[54:28.280 --> 54:34.440]  oh my god and whether it was a dream or real whether i was peering into the future or not
[54:34.440 --> 54:40.760]  it doesn't matter because i can intellectually look at the enemy operation and tell you without a
[54:40.760 --> 54:47.560]  shadow of a doubt that's where they're taking us so whether it was a vision or whether my mind
[54:47.560 --> 55:03.480]  our minds are so incredible created this giant 20 year 3d movie complete with smellivision
[55:04.600 --> 55:11.000]  so that i could try to wrap my mind around what faces our species and try to find the lever to
[55:11.000 --> 55:16.680]  move the world back from the brink of destruction we'll have a guest on for 30 minutes and then
[55:16.680 --> 55:19.560]  i'm going to try to collect my thoughts and and i always say i'm going to give you the new
[55:19.560 --> 55:24.680]  order master plan but it's so big that it's hard to articulate but at the bottom of the
[55:24.680 --> 55:29.720]  hour i'm going to write some notes and i'm going to do my best i almost called buckley but he's
[55:29.720 --> 55:37.000]  getting married saturday because he lives near me to have him come at 5 30 in the morning with me
[55:37.000 --> 55:43.160]  and i you know white t-shirt my underwear i had to put clothes on but i mean i was ready right then
[55:43.160 --> 55:49.480]  it was just to lay it all out but basically it's this we know the course now the time for denial is
[55:49.480 --> 55:56.360]  over you're either going to stand with humanity and try to develop a system that will allow humans
[55:56.360 --> 56:03.320]  to go to the next level and protect our precious planet or make the decision to join with the evil
[56:03.320 --> 56:08.680]  ones and their rationales that the globalists are saving the earth and just join the team that's
[56:08.680 --> 56:13.240]  going to wipe out almost the entire population and try to protect yourselves but i'm going to explain
[56:13.240 --> 56:17.880]  something the globalists are the ones that are destroying the earth they try to block people
[56:17.880 --> 56:23.160]  that actually try to stop things that are truly hurting the earth they're creating micro plasms
[56:23.160 --> 56:29.000]  and weird funguses and stuff that many scientists believe are going to get out and create a scenario
[56:29.000 --> 56:41.320]  so like you see in the excellent movie interstellar where there's a blight in the atmosphere eating
[56:41.320 --> 56:45.080]  the atmosphere i've run into government documents you can pull them up where they're not just working
[56:45.080 --> 56:50.040]  on any matter weapons they're working on global atmospheric blights that's beyond the doomsday
[56:50.040 --> 56:55.240]  bomb it will eat the atmosphere what you see in that movie they've made that type of stuff
[56:55.240 --> 56:58.600]  because they're crazy
[57:00.840 --> 57:04.520]  last night in my dream i've studied them so much i was like tuning in basically
[57:05.080 --> 57:09.880]  to my mind's reconstruction of their minds is just it was like being possessed or something it was
[57:09.880 --> 57:15.720]  just absolutely horrible because it was like a 20 year dream it was just went on forever it was like
[57:15.720 --> 57:22.280]  hell through their eyes while they were doing all this stuff my god it was horrible oh my god it's
[57:22.280 --> 57:31.000]  so horrible the future is going to be just hell on earth people and the churches won't warn anybody
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.400]  it's all name it and claim it glitter bugs up there
[57:35.640 --> 57:39.400]  i'm going to briefly do some midair refueling we need money to fund this operation i want to

[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:18.040]  government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:26.840]  and now live from austin texas alex jones i had read the sheet wrong uh our guest is at the bottom
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:34.280]  of the hour so i'll be able to come back to the next segment and try to break down again
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:43.720]  how they are turning off our survival instincts their master plan what they're building what
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:52.200]  they've decided to do and i realize why i called them the equivalent of space aliens our own
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:57.640]  species that are doing this to us because you are basically the identity you take on in your mind
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:02.680]  you can make the joke and say you can't be trans species and claim you're a dog
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:10.200]  but with our types of human activity you can take on other cloaks
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:17.480]  and the establishment has taken on the mindset of god and the devil but that's really what the
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:22.680]  devil does is claim he's god no you're the devil because you're against free will claiming you're
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:29.400]  selling enlightenment and empowerment when you're doing the opposite
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:38.600]  so i'm going to try my best the problem is when i start thinking about it i really should write
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:46.280]  all this down there's so many interconnecting pieces that it's hard to articulate at all
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:55.400]  and i know i've said that many times mainly when i pull back and look at the design it's
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:05.080]  i marvel at it and become speechless but the reason i liken them to space aliens is is to
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:13.240]  create the thought process that these folks are alien to to to the average person that just wants
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:19.160]  friendship and kinship and love and passion and art and creativity and wanting people to do good
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:24.760]  wanting to help people i mean god almighty give it all these little kids these damn diseases
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:29.080]  makes me so angry it makes me feel very violent but i realize the enemy set it all up where i
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:33.400]  can't just go out and defend children from these people because it's all done and couched through
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:38.920]  these guilds through these systems through plausible deniability i mean it's coming out
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:46.280]  in these david night reports as they release and declassify in lawsuits that the government
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:52.520]  knows giving premies vaccines kills them and brain damages them and and they do it and they
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:58.440]  tell the hospitals how to cover it up and then you got to ask why do they want to hurt them
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.560]  well their argument is they've got to set the precedent to kill people and cover it up it's
[01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:10.680]  all scientific testing building towards their main move we have seen nothing yet people
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.160]  and i just can't believe everybody's going to stand by and watch these pieces of crap do this
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:25.720]  and i want to know the whole truth as patrick henry said i want to make preparation for it
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:34.520]  and good lord above i i just i say it's got to be aliens because i can't leave our species
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:41.480]  would do this to us but you look what criminals and child molesters and sickos do the the they
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:47.080]  are alien psychologically and spiritually from us and they want to be different and think humanity
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:52.040]  is ugly and they want to merge with machines so they're not human they have dehumanized themselves
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:58.840]  by dehumanizing us they revel in saying that the infirm and the weak need to be destroyed
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:03.320]  while selling us on giving them power in the name of protecting the weak
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:07.960]  and they're great at deception
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:18.280]  but what you do to the least you've done to yourself and that's the metaphysical galactic
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:25.800]  inner galactic interdimensional rule that it will come back on you the allegory of firing the nerve
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:35.000]  gas in world war one and it blows back on you i mean the globalists are smart when it comes to
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.520]  being psychopathic when it comes to being sociopathic when it comes to being cold-blooded
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:46.680]  but they are not when it comes to flesh and blood because flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
[01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:50.520]  i want to continue to be human i don't want to give my humanity up i certainly don't want to be
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:56.200]  ordered to roll over and accept the technocracy which isn't even really there to deliver me to
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:05.400]  this fall holla but to hell former cnn host and gun control advocate pierce morgan has called for
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:12.040]  all white people who use the n word to be thrown in jail the debate began yesterday shortly after
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:19.240]  president brock obama used the n word during an interview about racism on the wtf with mark marron
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:26.600]  podcast racism racism we are not cured of clearly and it's not just a matter of uh
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:34.920]  it not being polite to say public that's not the measure of whether racism still exists or not
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:40.040]  shortly after the interview the term n word quickly began trending on twitter which later
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:46.040]  resulted in pierce morgan's response to jail all white people who use the term so i guess since
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:52.760]  pierce morgan failed in his attempt to take away our second amendment now it looks like his eyes

[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:08.040]  ease the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:20.360]  this morning i was on the elliptical i was watching cbs morning news
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:29.080]  charlie rose and others up there praying on their victim viewers everything was conditioning them for
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:36.680]  their increased enslavement and you'd have thought it was the alex jones show 18 19 years ago
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:42.440]  except i was warning people saying it was a bad thing it was uh thumb printing to buy and sell
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:47.640]  it was robots are going to take your jobs uh it was yeah we're in a recession but don't
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:53.160]  worry the government's going to save you and then lots of product placement woven in
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:00.520]  but in amongst it they had the cover of the atlantic magazine a world without work
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:06.200]  for centuries experts have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete that
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:11.320]  moment may finally be arriving could that be a good thing yeah and robotics was supposed
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:16.040]  to make us work less hours but all over the world people work more hours because they're
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:22.920]  designing economies that are sucking up our time and energy and so all we're going to do is spend
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:28.520]  our time complying with government and corporate edicts and paying taxes until we're bankrupt
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:32.760]  because there's no jobs then you've got to waive your rights to go on government assistance
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:42.200]  and be forcibly inoculated sign agreements not to have children be sterilized live in coffin
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:48.200]  250 square foot housing this is all their admissions that's why they've made the decision
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:55.000]  not to engineer a world for humans to have jobs for humans to be involved there's no organization
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:02.280]  i know of that's saying we're the human defense core or there's no uh business association worldwide
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:11.160]  or nationally where it's hey made by hand pro human i've seen it one time i bought a ford
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:17.080]  raptor four years ago when they were first widely starting to come out and it said then on the door
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:26.200]  or made by humans ought to show this made by humans by hand at the ford plant and said where
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.480]  and i looked at my buddy's new raptor doesn't say that
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:37.480]  just a high-powered uh f-150 great truck i've had other pickup trucks it's just the best
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.320]  i've ever driven it'll just it'll just go up incredible angles upgrades you name it
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:46.120]  forward on a pay me to say that they haven't
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:55.960]  but they're just phasing us out it's oh you're obsolete oh humans are dumb oh humans are bad
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:00.840]  for the earth so the elite are going to merge with robots and computers and uh be gods and we're
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:04.360]  going to phase out the general population because we're not going to let you just lay around like
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:11.480]  a wally on some floating cruise ship weighing 400 pounds and so no one can organize against it
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:15.880]  they dumb the culture down they break up the families they get us all in fighting and obsessing
[01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:21.960]  over brown paper bags or you know over american flags at school from texas to california being
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:25.480]  banned because they're offensive to the hispanic students who are from mexico
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:34.680]  because the the leftist running the school it came out in colorada and california told them
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:42.040]  to be offended by it nobody's saying that flag symbolizes something perfect but you sure wanted
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:47.160]  to get here to the us because it had a little more freedom than mexico did but don't worry soon
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:55.560]  that'll all be gone so humans are being phased out the elite tell us all day how we're a scourge
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:12:01.640]  we're scum we're bad too many kids making the planet worse and and you can argue a bunch of lazy
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:07.480]  dumbed-down people who have been given welfare white black hispanic you name it wandering around
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:12.760]  is disgusting hell the globalists have even enticed asians to get on the welfare train
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:17.880]  something they had a lot of trouble doing stereotypically very hardworking not wanting
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:21.800]  to be on welfare because they don't want somebody around their lives but they've now gotten chinese
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:28.520]  women now the biggest group coming into the us eclipsing mexican women to have their babies
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:34.920]  for free be put on welfare and they advertise in chinese newspapers how to come here and do it and
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:44.520]  on cnn but that's only in the phase to bankrupt everything get the nations in debt get rid of
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:51.640]  the jobs so that then we can be social engineered as the resources are turned off nobody asked you
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:56.520]  if you wanted driverless cars they're just rolling them out and saying they're fun they're cool they're
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:02.600]  trendy the cars are already becoming driverless where they give you this order give you that order
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:07.880]  report to the police over the embedded gps system create a whole history of where you went all new
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:13.320]  cars for five years worldwide made in the west from japan to the united states from germany to
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:19.960]  mexico have the driverless car software taxing wireless tracking software in them and the government
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:25.160]  just went this year oh gee the system's already in there we'll just start taxing you and they're
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:32.600]  starting the test this year in austin texas and in san francisco and in new york city those are the
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:41.880]  main test cities and they roll it all out as non-threatening as cute as fun hey come on into
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:47.640]  google we got some free cupcakes and plush couches and everybody's funny and wears bright colors we're
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:56.360]  non-threatening we're your friends we're non-threatening we're friends world's first self-driving
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:02.200]  trucks are already on the highway and as i told you over a decade ago and i'm not bragging i'm
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:06.920]  just proving i know what i'm talking about they're then going to say well driverless cars are safer
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:12.280]  than humans you got to pay an insurance premium to drive yourself and then oh you know what
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:19.560]  this guy had a heart attack at the wheel he ran right into the school bus the nav computer shows it
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:24.120]  if the car would have been by law under computer control which was already in the car
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:30.600]  if mr johnson would have enabled it the car would have come to a safe stop that's it we're
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:38.120]  implementing the new law it's federal and international all cars will now be driverless
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:42.360]  you can put it the mode where you're driving if you're good enough driver the computer allows it
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:47.240]  you go above the speed limit it takes control slows you down gives you the ticket
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.640]  now i could foresee the enemy doing that when i first heard of talking about this 18 years ago
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:01.480]  i i could just extrapolate where they were going knowing their plan now all of it's being announced
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:09.240]  exactly as i said because we know how they operate we know their plan we know their blueprint
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:21.960]  and now you won't be educated in how to sew or how to work on a carburetor or how to clean
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:26.200]  a fish tank uh or how to be a school teacher you will be taught
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:35.160]  how to run around in ninny and henpeck everyone around you to socially conform to the new global
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:42.440]  religion of political correctness and i mean i read in un documents uh that we cover in my
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:46.440]  film in game i keep going back to that film because it's got a whole bibliography online
[01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:58.200]  what is the endgame.com is that the url let's pull it up thank you every 30 seconds of film
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:03.880]  has an online bibliography to the documents yes what is the endgame.com they want you dead
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:15.000]  and in there they break down how in the future
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:25.000]  they needed to bring in the religion of the environment and the religion of political behavior
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.760]  and and and and make it the entire culture where you don't even know how to tie your shoe laces
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:36.680]  but man you know how to go around ninnying everywhere and do what you're told as a hospitality
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:40.680]  not hurt anyone's feelings because you'll be arrested in the future or you will you'll be
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:48.120]  fired already if you violate any of the cannons of this religion that'll be changing and expanding
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:55.800]  and becoming more draconian all the time and it's only meant to fragment balkan eyes atomized
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:17:02.200]  and stunned humanity like a spider first bites a bug then lets it rot for a few days while it's
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:10.840]  still halfway alive before it asanguates it we're now getting bound up in the spider's web for the
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:26.200]  meal so the atlantic a world without work and they break down how sorry you're not going to
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.200]  have any jobs gee we don't know why there was supposed to be a service economy but it's going
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:37.880]  to shut down too and then meanwhile earth is on the brink of six mass extinction scientists say
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:43.320]  and it's humans fault and you read this big governmental three university study
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:51.800]  and no one tells you who authored it until way down in the story stanford biologist paul urlick
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:57.160]  said in a video created we are now moving into another of these events that can easily easily ruin
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:03.160]  the lives of everybody on the planet but in the headline it says it's humans fault so you do what
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:10.360]  they say and then they'll protect you let's start going to this clip now here it is five times in the
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:16.280]  past something has happened on the planet that's killed off a very large portion of the life forms
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:21.880]  and has taken a million years to re-establish fortunately the last one was 65 million years
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:27.240]  ago when the dinosaurs bit us with a lot of other things that we are now moving into another one of
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:34.360]  these events that could easily easily ruin the lives of everybody on the planet because we're
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:40.520]  utterly dependent on the other organisms for our food for our climate for all sorts of things that
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:48.120]  we must have the so-called natural services that other organisms provide is all kinds and all of
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:53.800]  that is completely true the problem is they've been deployed by the Rockefeller Foundation
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:19:00.520]  in his own book written in 1974 eco science in my hand with the White House science are
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:06.120]  to put chemicals in the water to sterilize us and reduce our IQs to make us more manageable
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:13.320]  and and and not you you'll never hear hey stop GMO or stop you know genetic vandalism
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:17.880]  worry about all this nanotech no no no it's always just humans are bad pay us carbon taxes
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:22.280]  humans are bad let us run your life because they believe they can't save the earth they must leave

[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:23.720]  18 years ago but on air 20 and i mean when i learned what the globalists wanted to do from
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:28.840]  their own books and publications i thought man this is wild but i saw them always carry out each
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:37.000]  step of it and they intend to carry all of this out they've got a lot of will they control our
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:43.720]  planet right now they're putting in a total cashless tracking grid to tax and regulate every
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:49.240]  facet of our lives selectively to shut down all competition and in free markets
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:57.080]  africa is collapsing the middle east is collapsing latin america is collapsing in many areas
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:04.040]  and the answer is from the eu and na u afp reports today europe's identity at risk as
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:07.640]  migrant tensions rise europe has taken more immigrants than even the united states
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:13.640]  from all over the world and given them all this welfare now they're saying we have to let in even
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:20.840]  more what a billion two billion five billion that'll only accelerate the collapse you see
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:26.280]  bring down civilization because the globalists are in technological reservations that are exempt
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:34.200]  from all of it under national security everything else is overrun by the third world apocalypse
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:39.480]  they use our humanity to say let them in the life boat when it doesn't even save them while global
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:45.960]  is to put policies in militarily and economically to collapse the third world and the imf and world
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:54.760]  bank documents were leaked in 2002 admitting it's a planned implosion that's the key they're imploding
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:26:02.200]  it watching it burn while they're behind glass walls safe and they've kept their whole system
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:06.760]  invisible because mainstream media won't talk about it now they've got so much of their program
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:10.680]  in place they're now decloaking it but selling it like it's fine
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:19.720]  oh there's no plan to put a box in your car and taxi by the mile don't listen to alex jones that
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:29.320]  crazy when the box is already in your car and so i'm here simply saying that we have to
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:37.560]  simply saying i know we've become deft i'm in blind politically but as things get worse people
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:42.760]  are going to listen and we have to create the culture about being pro-human state the enemy
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:48.200]  takeover let folks know they're living in a dystopic science fiction movie make preparations and the
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:54.760]  good news is most the scientists doctors and and and former government people know this is all true
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:58.680]  and they're heading for the hills at least trying to create their own microcultures
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:05.080]  trying to get co-ops going for farming goods they understand the elite themselves are trying to get
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:11.960]  into redoubts as well but the mid-level servant class knows this is true and i could tell you
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:18.280]  how many times microbiologists scientists famous people in science have gone what you can think
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:23.640]  we know this too we know this for you did alex we tried to work in the system to influence it
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:31.000]  to be pro-human but it didn't work and they go the public is too weak and so we're not joining
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.440]  with the elite to kill everybody but we're not joining with the public either they're going to
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:40.040]  be the main threat during the collapse and that's the truth because we're stuck between the psycho
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:46.120]  elite vampires and this mass of just dumbed down entitled idiots i don't care if they're black
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:55.320]  white hispanic trendy whatever we are a weak nation folks because like a spaceship has no gravity
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:01.560]  and your heart fails after a year in space your muscles rot your bones break the decadence of the
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:07.720]  modern society and how good we've had it for so long we have basically been living in zero gravity
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:18.120]  and so we're falling apart i'm not judging anybody i'm falling apart i'm weak i'm decadent
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:27.720]  i need to be a leader and codify this into a book a film credit organization i need to go out and
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:33.960]  and be really focused and really use my oratory skills to move people to see the threat and to try
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:40.920]  to recruit leaders and wealthy people who aren't joining evil to challenge them to either join
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:49.320]  humanity or join the elite or commit suicide i mean this is epic folks you need to choose
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:57.240]  a side now and i can't do everything i want to do everything but all work and no play makes
[01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:02.600]  jack a dull boy and i used to work 16 18 hours a day up here until i started just getting dizzy
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:08.120]  all the time from burnout i didn't work out for like over a decade because all i did was work
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:12.280]  sickening amounts of time and finally about three four years ago i said i want to be with my
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:18.680]  children i want to have a life i can't physically do all this i wasn't born with the organizational
[01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:24.120]  skills i wasn't born with a lot of it we built a lot i need your help but we're in this together
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:30.760]  and get past the spirit of just giving up as thomas jeverson said there's an animating contest of
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:37.640]  liberty get into this fight for humanity get into positions to resist it and it starts by just

[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:34.120]  lauren southern is our guest we're gonna be talking to her in just a moment it was a few weeks ago
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:41.160]  we posted one of her videos and info wars dot com and prison planet dot com showing what feminists
[01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:47.480]  call a slut walk and they have these in austin as well and it's just a bunch of women running around
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:53.160]  screaming cussing yelling acting weird and just declaring that men are raping them
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:34:00.200]  and saying the west is rape culture but not not countries where it's actually the culture
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:07.080]  i mean i've seen the statistics rapes at an all-time low and it's the west that started the move
[01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:11.640]  towards women's rights historically and the end of slavery why are we the progenitors of it
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:17.000]  because they know the west has guilt and is christian even if you're not a practicing christian
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:26.120]  you have that morale you have that idea that moray and so you're basically bullied into it
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:32.920]  we're gonna be talking to her here in just a moment but before we go any further i just
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:38.440]  wanted to finish up with the whole takeover that i was breaking down really my call today is just
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:43.720]  an announcement to myself and everybody else and i hope you make the declaration with me that
[01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:51.000]  we need to repent for our decadence we need to be aware of that screen time and um being immersed
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:58.280]  in this false culture and buying into the system even if we do it from afar only partially is
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:03.640]  physically brain damaging us i mean they admit tv watching is causing neurological disorders early
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:10.200]  onset of Alzheimer's uh our children are just brain damaged zombies um i'm not judging anybody
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:16.120]  but but this is a very unhealthy world we're in we're living completely different than we
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:23.560]  lived 100 years ago totally different and we see the result it's bad and the globalist hijack all that
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:29.640]  and go yeah this is bad this is unhealthy we're gonna fix it for you when they're making it worse
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:35.560]  in every case and don't even plan on having humanity as it is currently operating in any
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:41.800]  shape or form in the future and here's the news they don't get to decide the future they don't get
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.840]  to dominate me and my family they don't get to ram through laws that are totally unconstitutional
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:51.800]  and tyrannical on their face the declaration of independence doesn't give me my rights but it
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:56.600]  points out i've got a right if i'm under a tyrannical oppressive government to throw it off
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:05.080]  but physically is not the most effective way it's the emergency way the first amendment is the way
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:10.920]  and all this confederate flag business is about setting the precedent that the political elite
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:16.200]  just like they ban nazi flags in europe i don't like the nazi flag i almost didn't exist because
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:20.040]  of the nazis both my grandfathers almost died in world war two
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.440]  but i said don't ban the nazi flag in germany because you ban that next you're gonna ban
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:33.240]  everything else and basically they have they've banned public assemblies to criticize open borders
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:38.600]  and radical islam and sexual mutilation of women and there isn't one stinking feminist group out
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:43.960]  there that'll talk about saudi arabia executing women that try to go out and drive cars or arresting
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:49.800]  reporters that criticize the government because oh that's that's a that's something different than
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:55.960]  the west we don't criticize it's kind of cool they got hookah pipes like the trendies all kind
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:37:01.320]  of adopt this whole radical muslim thing and they don't even know what's in it i'm not bashing
[01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:06.200]  muslims here the radical muslims are overtaking the moderate muslims who are interesting cool people
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:12.440]  but the point is anything western has to be destroyed anything not western is god these are just
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:20.760]  suicidal spoiled brats but instead of committing suicide they want to crap all over everything
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:27.320]  in the west and bring it down and they are the idiot rabble it's like the french revolution
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:38.840]  meets pcp where anything wholesome is overthrown not tolerated see now the deviant want to overthrow
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:45.960]  those that aren't deviant or aren't their brand of deviant everybody's a little twisted we're all

[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:53.000]  first or part of it uh where she goes out and tries to talk to the slut walk that's their name for
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.920]  it not ours now the feminist and they just freak out on her we had to bleep some of the profanity
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:04.360]  you've seen the feminist third-wave feminist here running around screaming i stink i have arm hair
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:09.640]  i love satan i kill my babies like maybe cue those up that's quite a claim without playing it uh
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:13.640]  it's like the news saying mercury's good for your baby i mean i don't like to say that cbs news said
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:19.320]  that without playing the clip they really did uh it just shows us inverted reality but but anybody
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:25.720]  can go out and do this you need to become a reporter now to expose this craziness you need to
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:31.560]  become a blogger now all of you start a local newsletter uh hand out cards with info wars on
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:36.360]  it uh calling to talk radio go to the state house by the way what's the latest on tpp guys i know
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:40.440]  we're tracking that the senate's set to try to pass it today now that's going to come up the next
[01:42:40.440 --> 01:42:46.840]  hour uh but right now let's go ahead and go to her piece that said the rebel dot media you should
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:52.440]  know better go after the system that excuse it hide it ignore it hello it's lauren southern here
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:57.560]  with rebel and i just got in a huge confrontation with the slut walk which we are following right
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:04.040]  now essentially i held a sign that said we are not living in a rape culture in the west
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:08.920]  which we are not it is intellectually dishonest to think that we are living in a rape culture
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:14.680]  rapes do happen but the majority or the minority the vast minority of men and women
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:20.200]  are rapists and when we do find out they're rapists they go to prison they are punished whereas in
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:27.480]  third world countries and other places men can get away with rape there and it's insane to focus
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:32.680]  on this one issue and say that we are living in a rape culture rapists don't get high fives we don't
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:38.360]  have the government funding rapists even men get fired from their jobs just for making rape jokes
[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:44.760]  not even raping so to say we live in a rape culture is quite frankly ridiculous all right let's go
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:44:00.600]  follow the walk oh come on so how do you believe your outfit is going to stop perpetuating rape
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:06.200]  culture it's my body it's my choice i can wear what i want and it shouldn't this is exemplifying how
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:10.600]  it's a crime scene like wearing the caution tape that they would normally put around a physical
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:16.280]  crime scene with when it's not really regarding a person but regarding me it's regarding people
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:21.480]  don't consider a crime scene that's up it should be it's a violation of a person's rights so is
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:26.520]  this stopping rapes stats to back up anything that you've said this afternoon absolutely you said that
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:30.280]  rapists go to jail can you give me a stat to back that up based on the number of rapes that are
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:34.760]  reported the number of rapes to get taken to the cops the number of rapes to get prosecuted could
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:39.320]  you give me some stats to back up your pseudo reporting here well first of all uh out of the
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:46.280]  amount of rapes that happen out of 100 000 people 1.7 uh of canadiens actually even just that's
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:50.520]  just reporting rapes so yeah you know that less than 10 percent of rapes are actually reported
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:56.280]  this is victimology where's that it's from all of the women's organizations you can look it up
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:01.720]  online you can find it you just socialize like a family that study rape i'm just working with
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:06.440]  an organization that works as a rape crisis center we base that on the number of calls the police
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:11.400]  know based on the unofficial reports the third party reporting in the direct reports this is not
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:15.560]  a secret that about 10 percent of rapes are reported so how do you know 10 percent of rapes
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:21.080]  are reported if the others aren't because those people call the women's centers they ask for help
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:24.920]  they seek medical attention so they are reported do you actually think we live in a rape culture
[01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:32.280]  um unfortunately i think so i was actually just chatting with my friend about um even you know
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:36.360]  the uh viral craze going on where people come up to reporters such as yourself and are saying that
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:41.720]  awful phrase and until live cameras that's f her right in the p and that kind of language that is
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:46.520]  considered funny is something that you know it might seem like an innocent thing but it's just
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:51.320]  an example of how uh the language we use is absolutely involved with rape culture or somebody
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:55.560]  does poorly on a test they're like oh i got raped by that test and it's like why are you talking that
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:59.080]  way do you actually think we live in a rape culture though because i'd say for the most part
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:04.840]  we demonize rapists we send them to prison guys to make rape jokes lose their job i i think we're
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:12.680]  making great strides in doing that but uh at the same time they're girls and guys who believe that
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:18.200]  it's just kind of like you kind of force each other on or like if all right that's enough i want to
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:22.040]  go to our guests to get even more insane we'll try to play some more later we've got her with us
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:29.640]  till five after next hour lauren southern reporting from vancouver british columbia and i know you
[01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:33.640]  get into it with them but i mean what about cultures like in areas of africa or areas of
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:39.320]  the middle east where women are literally prisoners and they're being executed for no reason i never
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:47.000]  hear gloria steinham talk about that the west is where women developed uh their rights the west has
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:54.840]  been the best to quote jim morrison i mean i just don't get this hatred of the west this and this
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:47:01.160]  foaming at the mouth uh and then feminist i know at major universities now teach all sex is rape
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:07.080]  i know there's also a big uh kind of a pickup deal that butch lesbians use i'm not attacking them
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:11.560]  but it's you know basically you know saying that men want to rape them i i really think it's this
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:20.120]  whole anti uh human thing i mean targeting men uh tell us what you witnessed there and your view on
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:27.240]  all this and what spurred you to go out and shoot this report well speaking of whether it is a hatred
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:34.600]  of the west or whether they think it's an actual issue i honestly think that a lot of the whole
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:43.320]  slot walk is about making individuals and women here look like victims and they want women here
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:48.360]  in the west look like victims they want it to be an attention thing you can tell by how they dress
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:55.000]  at the slot walk calling it the slot walk um they don't want to focus on the real issues there they
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:02.120]  want to focus on issues that affect them and will make gain them attention is how i see it um because
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:07.240]  if you're talking about rape cultures in other countries where women are legitimately stoned
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:14.760]  for the crime of being raped suddenly it uh it makes it seem like oh hey it actually isn't that
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:20.520]  bad you're in Canada women actually don't have it that bad here but the feminist narrative is they
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:26.360]  want it to look like all women are still extremely oppressed so that they can get all of these um
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:32.520]  entitlements and privileges just for the sake of being a victim so that's the new thing it's a new
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:38.840]  form of royalty if you're a protected group and a victim then you basically are now the new nobility
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:45.480]  exactly and you will no one can question you you look at what i did i the only reason i could
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:51.160]  question this group is because i was a woman i do think that if a man had gone and spoke his mind
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:56.920]  used his freedom of speech held up a sign he may have been arrested uh he probably would have lost
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:02.760]  his job he probably uh would have gotten 10 times the flak that i did but because i'm a woman and i
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:08.200]  went and questioned it that's why feminists hate me so much is because they have a hard time uh
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:13.880]  complaining about me expressing my opinion as a woman the only thing they can really say to me is
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:21.960]  internalized misogyny which is just insane uh the the fact that i would hate women is just ridiculous
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:28.520]  i am one um but that's a big reason why i wanted to go to the slut walk one because i think that
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:34.680]  it is exaggerating and fear mongering and it has an agenda to do that to keep the feminist
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:42.280]  narrative going and the other one is i think that it really doesn't represent women who were victims
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:49.560]  of brutal rapes that didn't do anything that could have that took every precaution possible
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:56.120]  this kind of says uh all women who are raped kind of i don't know it represents it doesn't represent
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:50:01.000]  a certain group of women who have been assaulted or raped that took all the precautions necessary
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.440]  and that's not victim blaming to say that women should take precautions in some cases i don't
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:11.400]  think it's anyone's fault if they do get a little drunk or dress inappropriately and get raped it's
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:16.600]  absolutely the rape is swallowed but i don't think the slut walk should be speaking out against
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:22.200]  taking sure i think they should be encouraging it well sure when we come back i want to get into
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:27.240]  there's so many cases of this of in this liberalism culture of victimization where most the black
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:31.480]  churches that get attacked people do it themselves or most the jewish centers that have swastikas
[01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:36.040]  put on them it turns out it was an inside job the dormitories we see that in the news all the time
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:43.800]  uh but a lot the false reporting of rape too uh it's like this new weapon that's thrown out there
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:49.000]  but but my big issue is i don't know why we can't get any of the leftists or any of the feminists
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:53.640]  concerned about the middle east that i just keep bringing up where we're in places like
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:51:00.280]  salt arabia i mean women have less rights than a dog and you just can't get them to talk about it
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:05.000]  communist china freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates while our u.s politicians
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:09.640]  argue from banning americans from owning body armor does that sound right to you harm your

[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:48.920]  have any free speech that hurts my feelings and then they just repeat the same line where
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:53.080]  some misogynistic and will attack your signs and they'll call you racist it's like they're
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:58.920]  really stupid people i wouldn't call them liberals i'd call them more like some kind of cult but
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:04.600]  let's play a clip from uh lauren southern's peace where she uh gets in this argument with
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:08.600]  these people at the slut walk they do these all over the world where they say we're allowed to
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:11.560]  flaunt our bodies well i mean you see women flaunting their bodies everywhere nobody's doing
[01:56:11.560 --> 01:56:17.880]  anything to them i mean it's it's just bizarre but let's let's play this clip where they then
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:23.720]  they're in public saying you can't videotape us and we don't give consent well there's no
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:29.000]  consent in public if you're news gathering if you wanted to take video of them in a public
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:34.040]  place and make them your mascot then it would be copyright because you're using them to sell
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:39.640]  something but not when it's news gathering first amendment which they also have in canada it's
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:44.280]  called free speech uh i know the news rules all over the western world they're all the same
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:47.640]  let's go ahead and go to that clip there's a group of women that were here and they're wishing to
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:55.320]  withdraw consent to use the footage that you had i guess gotten so can you please make sure that is
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:57:00.200]  done and make sure that any of the stuff that they have we may or we may not use the footage it is
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:05.240]  a public area so we do have legal rights to use the footage but you'd like interview them specifically
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:10.200]  right so like yes and they gave us consent to interview well now they're withdrawing it so
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:16.040]  that's not how it works but which is interesting giving the event that you're at right like it's
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:19.880]  a little bit contradictory i mean it's a little bit contradictory well i totally say it that's not
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:26.360]  how it works well you can't just withdraw consent the next like that's interesting why is that
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:34.040]  interesting tell me tell me like a rally for like like rapists like you know consent and like
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:39.080]  withdrawing consent saying like no means no they're saying no when you're saying that like okay so if
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:44.680]  someone gives consent the night before and then they have no no listen if they have sex with a man
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:48.120]  and they give consent to him then the next day decide oh i regret it i'm gonna report him for
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:52.440]  being a rapist even though i gave him consent you're saying that's okay so you're sounding a
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:55.560]  little bit like a 12 year old because this is irrelevant all right we finally made it back
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:58:00.040]  there you go so she won the debate every time lauren southern's amazing really smart can think
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:05.000]  on her feet rather than i can but i can't believe she starts laughing basically saying you're a rapist
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.920]  they're they're in a public place she's news gathering and now she's a rapist we're going to
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:12.680]  break in one minute five more minutes with our guests coming up but lauren southern i mean these
[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:18.440]  people are amazing you know what's hilarious about it is if you look at halfway through that
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:22.840]  little clip you showed a girl walks into the background with a sign that has a middle finger
[01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:27.640]  on it and it's a big bright yellow sign that's one of the girls in the interview that they're
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:34.360]  asking to not be shown and they are walking in front of my camera so they're actually raping
[01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:38.680]  your free speech more than you're quote raping them i mean but then everybody's a rapist and we
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:44.920]  know that we're back in 70 seconds more in southern the rebel dot media from canada gcm the genesis

[02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:13.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:13.240 --> 02:00:22.120]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:28.520]  all right i've been ranting a lot more in southern the rebel dot media it's a political science
[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:36.440]  student up in janitor she's got a great youtube channel tell us more about your media operation
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:42.120]  and then spend a few minutes making other points but that's just incredible that they
[02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:46.760]  come up and basically say you're raping them by videotaping them in public i mean there's just
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:56.600]  no end to these people the biggest issue i have with them comparing my videotaping to rape is that
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:01:01.960]  they are trivializing what rape is and i think that's what this all is about them saying that
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:08.520]  a guy whistling at them here in canada or america is rape is trivializing and co-opting the word rape
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:15.880]  to serve a certain exaggerated purpose they are taking words like sexism rape misogyny
[02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:22.840]  even racism and all these things and using them incorrectly to exaggerate situations to portray
[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:28.840]  a certain narrative of the west is sexist the west is racist the west is our bunch of misogynist
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:35.160]  rapists when you look at the actual definitions of these words and you say no whistling at someone
[02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:41.240]  isn't rape no not hiring a woman over a man at a job because she had worse qualifications isn't
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:47.400]  sexism not being friends with a person of a different race because you don't like their
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:53.800]  personality isn't racism there are so many words that this group is co-opting and rape is one of
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:02:00.440]  them that i think is very very serious and it's very serious to trivialize because that that totally
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:05.400]  is wrong against the people who have actually lived in rape cultures and aren't supported by
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:11.320]  their government where here if i say i was raped i know i would have support i know i could go to
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:18.040]  a woman center i know the police would investigate it it's just so intellectually dishonest in my
[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:24.280]  opinion well no doubt things aren't perfect in some rates just uh do get away with what they're doing
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:31.240]  but this whole push to promote it is about saying that basically anyone that doesn't submit to
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:39.880]  socialist communist pro-abortion women uh is a rapist and they really illustrate there that it's
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:49.000]  a rape culture that they project on to people that aren't engaged in it yeah for sure they
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:55.960]  they they even posted in their facebook group that uh they were asking can we use lauren southern
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:03:03.320]  holding up her sign as an example of rape culture so my questioning them just just trying to get in
[02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:09.080]  a debate with them is supposedly an example of rape culture that's right you submit to them and
[02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:16.040]  that they had have all knowledge and of the great oracles or you are a rapist the other thing they'll
[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:22.760]  do is they will try to portray people who question them as evil offensive and triggering i got multiple
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:27.640]  letters that were sent to me as well as friends of mine as well as people who worked with me
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:37.160]  saying that they these individuals were so triggered they vomited all night because of my sign i
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:40.840]  actually got a message that said that a girl said she vomited all night because she was so
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:47.960]  triggered that i disagreed with them and they tried to lie about me get me um get positions that i
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:54.360]  was in taken away they tried to message my friends and tell them that i was uh screaming over rape
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:59.880]  survivors and telling them the rapes didn't happen which did not happen so these people were trying
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:06.040]  to demonize me because i had a different opinion and they didn't want to address my arguments or
[02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:12.200]  address what i was saying but instead they want to attack the source and not the what what the
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:16.200]  source is saying not the actual argument and that's what's happening with a lot of these
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:23.240]  rallies or these radical uh radical rallies whether it's abortion uh feminist rallies
[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:27.160]  anything is they don't want to hear an argument they just want to hear their own views repeated
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:31.640]  back at them and that's very dangerous every group should have their views questioned and
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:36.360]  deconstruct oh yeah question me you're a rapist question me you're you're a terrorist question me
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:41.560]  you're a racist well amazing i didn't even know it was that bad you should write an article about

[02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:56.680]  jacari jackson or leon macadoo and go over all of this because it's worse than i knew but they
[02:04:56.680 --> 02:05:03.720]  didn't try to persecute you simply amazing since 1949 the u.s department of agriculture has been
[02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:09.640]  demanding a portion of california's raisin crop without payment from the farmers they gave some
[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:17.000]  to schools some they sold and kept the money in 2002 farmers were told to hand over 89 000 tons
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:24.920]  of raisins 30 of their raisin crop medieval serfs typically paid only 10 in taxes rarely
[02:05:24.920 --> 02:05:31.160]  more than 15 percent the federal government treats americans worse than medieval serfs
[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:36.120]  but when one farm family refused the usda sued them for the value of the raisins
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:45.320]  480 000 plus a penalty of 200 000 the supreme court just struck down the usda's theft there was a
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:50.920]  time when americans declared their independence from a government that sent swarms of officers

[02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:43.800]  they want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while
[02:07:43.800 --> 02:07:48.440]  but then burn you out in my experience whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going

[02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:26.600]  with your specific economic or geopolitical questions for dr paul craig roberts american
[02:08:26.600 --> 02:08:34.120]  economist former editor the editor of the wall street journal writes for a creator syndicate
[02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:39.560]  today a multi-time new york times bestseller uh head of policy number two at the treasury under
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:45.880]  reagan the father of reaganomics i'm not going to get into all the big tank tanks he's been part of
[02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:52.120]  he's well known to this audience paul craig roberts dot org is his excellent website
[02:08:52.120 --> 02:09:01.320]  we carry his articles at info wars dot com but i wanted to get him on just about the waterfront
[02:09:01.320 --> 02:09:08.840]  the insane escalation of moving heavy weapons into ukraine and lithuania the bizarre samantha
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:14.520]  power speech two weeks ago openly threatening russia i was just rereading last night about
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:24.360]  napoleon's invasion of russia he was undefeated and how the russians burned moscow rather than
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:31.400]  let him have it and he was gravely mistaken and he lost only a few thousand as men came back
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:39.160]  there's a famous historical i think it's a west point graph where they showed the trajectory of
[02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:44.760]  napoleon's troops you can look at it online just type a graph of napoleon's troops going into russia
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:53.240]  and coming out and then of course hitler with operation barbara rosa just in just in russia
[02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:59.480]  they lost eight million troops and then they lost millions more when the russians came in
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:06.440]  a total of 21 million germans died or about a third of their population that was a good idea
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:12.440]  right attacking russia and they say empires don't just go to afghanistan to die they go to russia to
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:18.360]  die and again no one's lionizing latimer puttner and these people but we're on their doorstep we're
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:24.440]  attacking them we're hiring radical muslims to blow stuff up all over their caucus region
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:31.800]  the older zarnab brother was on a state department viso they're in a cia program look how that worked
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:39.320]  out for him the russians blew his cover two years before the false flag in boston and now polosi
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:46.360]  is set to vote for the t a a fast-tracking paving away for obama trade agenda and the washington post
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:53.400]  says obama poised for major trade win burnishing his foreign policy legacy like it's about his legacy
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:11:00.600]  that the republican leadership has joined with him horrible neocons and rhinos to make the president
[02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:06.600]  basically a dictator with these foreign banks to do whatever they want restrict ted cruz has finally
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:11.800]  read some of the bill now he says he's against it because it opens the borders and everything else
[02:11:11.800 --> 02:11:16.040]  this is crazy and the atlantic is out today i'm just setting the table here for roberts to
[02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:21.400]  comment on what he wants to get into first the atlantic has a big article it's like 25 pages long
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:28.120]  a world without work and they ask will it be a good thing that they're setting the economy up
[02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:33.160]  to offshore the jobs and the jobs we do have to be done by robots so do we even need people anymore
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:38.200]  this is like kind of a replay of does the future need us or why the future doesn't need us
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:43.880]  from wired magazine 15 years ago with bill joy going to the conference with 200 computer company
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:49.960]  owners billionaires and the decision was made at the conference that no we don't need a general
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:55.800]  population anymore and you can argue we don't need a decadent slaw population like walley laying around
[02:11:55.800 --> 02:12:01.800]  but this isn't even really being discussed until now so we're going over the edge into this global
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:07.720]  depression they've turned radical islamists is loose all over the middle east truly from a
[02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:12.520]  historical basis and i'm a novice historian i i love reading history books from every angle
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:22.200]  it's better than fiction it's page turner we are a tyranny now we are a very oppressive evil empire
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:29.240]  that is acting insane and needs to be stopped okay that's my rant introducing dr roberts will get
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:34.360]  into the economy the bond bubble that ron paul thinks is about to go under could this be the
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:41.560]  moment this this winter early next year no one knows but my god it's it's just crazy to see how
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:51.080]  the megalomania has escalated and no one stopped hitler yet is hitler about to turn into russia
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:57.800]  i mean i'm not trying to go there with that allegory but it does fit the dr roberts i mean
[02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:03.800]  are we not at a breathless moment what we're witnessing certainly are you you put a good
[02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:10.280]  summation on it alex you know the thing about all these threats to russia
[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:18.520]  i wonder sometimes if they're real because i know the neocons are crazy and that obama's
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:26.200]  government is totally incompetent unrealistic but i would think even crazy people well we're
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:33.400]  not actually want to go start a war with russia and so i sometimes wonder if all of this isn't
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:44.280]  just trying to intimidate russia or make them accept the sum of american hegemy um it could
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:51.240]  just be a strategy but but of course the trouble with a strategy like that if indeed that's what
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:58.040]  it is is it can very quickly take off on its own and get away from you and lead to war
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:06.280]  so i do agree with you that this administration is recklessly dangerous they have they are
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:16.760]  endangering all life on earth and i blame also the european countries because they enable this
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:25.080]  you know if they were simply to say look uh we're not any longer going along with this um
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:35.640]  we figured out that nato is the mechanism you use uh to generate conflict with russia and we
[02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:43.640]  were out of nato you're on your own that would put a stop to it i've even had some hopes that if
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:51.960]  the greek government were simply to default leave the eu leave nato turn to the east that it would
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:59.880]  begin the unraveling of nato because spain and idli are also uh subject to the looting
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:04.040]  greases sure you said that here a year ago that was the financial times of london headline
[02:15:04.040 --> 02:15:11.480]  uh on monday was quote us fears greece going to russia look at egypt our ally has been forced
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:19.880]  into russia's arms uh just out of necessity well these things could redeem the situation
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:27.800]  i don't know that they will but uh it's dangerous if something doesn't happen
[02:15:27.800 --> 02:15:36.200]  to redeem it the propaganda the anti-russian propaganda the anti-putin propaganda this is
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:43.880]  extreme we've never really seen this before this is the highest level of hate you know the other day
[02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:52.040]  robert perry reminded us of george orville's 1984 when uh there's there's two minutes of hate you
[02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:59.480]  flash the image of the enemy on the screen and and the population goes into two minutes of hate
[02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:07.800]  well that's what the new york times does with pudin it performs the same role of big brother
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:16.680]  and and an old book so it's a day a dangerous situation i have no idea what uh what is going
[02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:23.000]  to happen it looks though that the russians are taking it very quietly and stride they're not
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:28.840]  getting their back up they're not responding in provocative ways
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:38.760]  so that's good because it takes two people unless the idiot mama regime decides to have a preemptive
[02:16:38.760 --> 02:16:48.920]  nuclear attack and you do know that uh neoconservatives in this praise government of ours favor that
[02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:54.120]  some of them do you were in the highest levels of government and been in some of the biggest
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:58.520]  think tanks you were the editor of the wall street journal when it had the top respect
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:03.880]  not so much now with murdoch uh i mean you were there you were new ronald reagan well he brought
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:09.160]  you in uh ronald reagan helped break the soviet union's back which was a corrupt empire you
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:13.400]  helped negotiate a lot of that i know you don't like to brag uh but you got awards from france
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:18.680]  and stuff for doing it versus the government you knew then which certainly wasn't perfect versus
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:25.000]  this one just the way they act on the surface seems reckless and and and the recklessness of
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:30.840]  wall street all of it really is the type of stuff historically that does lead to war as many historians
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:34.840]  have said but but now we've got nuclear weapons i mean we just can't do this
[02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:42.120]  yes well you're right and the government is so different from anything that i experienced or
[02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:50.600]  would have ever expected you know you how do you work things out with the country that you are
[02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:58.360]  demonized uh whose leader is demonized you know it's not like that putin is unpopular he's got
[02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:06.280]  86 percent of the russian people behind him this is unheard of in the west uh but when you
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:14.120]  when the united states says okay when all out propaganda all out demonization
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:21.080]  then there's no basis for diplomacy and so it does look like the obama regime is driving the war
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:25.800]  that's exactly what it looks like why do they hate putin so much i mean did it start with him
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:33.800]  arresting the oligarchs that turned out to be western frontman they hate him because you know
[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:42.760]  the neoconservative doctrine the wolfowitz doctrine says that the first objective of american foreign
[02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:50.200]  policy is to prevent the rise of any other country that could serve as a constraint on
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:55.960]  washington's power that's right so anybody doing okay is a threat has to be destabilized hence the
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:19:03.480]  stabilization moves everywhere that's right and so when you see uh washington was used to yeltsin
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:09.560]  just letting them do whatever they wanted and then washington got involved heavily in the
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:17.800]  middle east in the wars remember the the cakewalk war that's still going on yes uh the surge in
[02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:24.440]  afghanistan i mean we've been totally defeated and the neocons got all involved in that and
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:32.680]  putin came along and restored russian sovereignty and they noticed it uh that is the neocons noticed
[02:19:32.680 --> 02:19:38.760]  it when putin blocked obama's invasion of syria stay there sir so this is an attack on sovereignty
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:43.560]  is what you're saying more than anything thank you for being a sovereign state it's global
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:48.840]  government doesn't doesn't want them to have a sovereign state that's exactly we got the pope
[02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:54.040]  promoting global government for carbon taxes i mean it's it comes down to that russia stands in
[02:19:54.040 --> 02:20:00.280]  the way of the world government new world order and that's why it has to fall we'll be back in one

[02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:32.600]  free number is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 if you look at pnak dr roberts was just getting into
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:40.040]  with the neocons who themselves were founded by trotsky it's just it's bizarre and already have a
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:46.360]  hatred of russia kind of embedded it's about absolute power and packs americana but but not
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:53.080]  even helping america they use american muscle to build this corporate world government that's exempt
[02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:59.480]  from taxes and to do that they've got to get rid of rogue nations well they see china as rogue they
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:04.920]  see russia as rogue they see iran as rogue they see syria as rogue does that mean some of these
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:12.520]  countries don't have problems and aren't totalitarian absolutely but you just if they can't beat the
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:18.920]  iraqis and they can't beat the afghans no one wins in a war with russia i know that's not rocket
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:25.000]  science but how do we get that message across to the elite and dr roberts and some people
[02:25:26.120 --> 02:25:30.760]  you kind of alluded to this they actually think maybe putans in a back room deal with obama
[02:25:30.760 --> 02:25:36.120]  and this is all to make him popular at home and to have weapon cells over here and this is all paper
[02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:40.920]  tigers but i've studied history and i'm looking at this this doesn't look fake to me dr roberts
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:48.920]  of course it's not fake no i think you summed it up well when when you said that the the neocons
[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:58.040]  see themselves as the new world order it's not something that's being imposed from the outside
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:05.320]  on the united states it's something the neocons are imposing on the world it's an ideology
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:12.680]  and people who are in the grips of ideology they don't hear facts they don't hear criticisms
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:21.240]  and so i don't think there's any chance of the neoconservatives realizing that no one
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:28.680]  wins in a war with russia particularly since russia and china are now allies a war with russia means
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:36.360]  also a war with china and the united states military is simply not capable of fighting russia and
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:44.200]  china simultaneously even in the nuclear context so it is dangerous we agree on that and we'll just
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:49.160]  have to see what happens you know i said there are some hopes there's some hopes that the europeans
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:55.080]  will finally realize that they are palms in this game they have nothing to gain from it and that
[02:26:55.080 --> 02:27:02.360]  they will break off from it and if if they do then washington loses the NATO mechanism that
[02:27:02.360 --> 02:27:09.240]  it needs in order to generate conflict with russia so we'll just have to wait and and see
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:16.760]  if you want to turn to the bonds i said bond market has been a bubble now for how long it's
[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:22.520]  like two seven years yes we've got a long segment coming up but we can start here this is a short
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:30.920]  segment we're hearing a lot of increasing signs from mainline economists that the bond bubbles
[02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:39.160]  in trouble what's your view on that sir well my view is the federal reserve can keep the interest
[02:27:39.160 --> 02:27:46.360]  rates low because they can print all the money they want to buy up all the bonds and so to have the
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:55.320]  bond bubble go if the fed is opposed to is going would require trouble with the dollar the dollar
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:28:00.840]  will have to go because the fed can't print foreign currencies with which to buy dollars
[02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:10.120]  so i've always felt that the fed could keep the bond bubble going until the dollar itself got into
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:18.040]  trouble because if the dollar itself gets into trouble and starts losing exchange value and
[02:28:18.040 --> 02:28:25.160]  the fed keeps printing more dollars to buy the bonds to keep that bubble alive that would add
[02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:32.680]  to the pressure on the dollar and since the basis for american power is the dollar as well
[02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:39.960]  reserve currency the fed would have to let the bond market go in order to save the dollar
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:46.680]  that's always been my view on it now i may be wrong who knows so are we approaching a crisis
[02:28:46.680 --> 02:28:53.480]  at that point or could this ponzi scheme go on indefinitely well i think the punzi scheme can
[02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:59.960]  go on as long as the rest of the world is content to hold the dollars and you see right now in fact
[02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:06.840]  for some time um warston has had the european central bank printing euros and the japanese
[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:12.600]  central bank printing yen so the other two large currencies are also being printed just like the
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:21.000]  dollar so that prevents pressure from rising on the dollar and as we've talked on previous shows
[02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:29.160]  the federal reserve allows the bullion banks the big banks in new york to sell naked shorts
[02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:34.600]  on the comebacks to drive down the gold price so it's totally rigged stay there explain that to

[02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:51.000]  we air little vignette daily news updates and one of those reminded me of a story yesterday where this
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:56.280]  has gotten so ubiquitous that i didn't even report on it that google indeed has been caught
[02:33:57.720 --> 02:34:03.320]  with their chrome users their browser users with the code activating your microphones
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:08.600]  and cameras watching and listening to you they told their shareholders 10 years ago that we wrote
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:14.520]  an article about it and back then people couldn't believe it kind of like we got the secret documents
[02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:19.720]  that the pentagon's preparing to take out the tea party gun owners veterans stuff like that
[02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:26.360]  now everybody knows that's the case it's all over the news i mean it really is mentally ill level
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:32.600]  crazy and there's just this corporate and governmental arrogance now of who would want to
[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:38.440]  have a world where google drives around with driverless cars with antennas stealing everybody's
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:44.120]  passcodes they're worse than the nsa and microsoft is horrible i mean government's not just our
[02:34:44.120 --> 02:34:53.240]  problem it's we've had it so good so long that there's almost a a a a trance state that corporate
[02:34:53.240 --> 02:34:59.160]  people are in where they're so insulated by the corrupt courts in the system to commit these crimes
[02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:05.000]  and it is a crime when they do this it's not a crime cuz samsung makes you when you buy it sign an
[02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:10.440]  agreement all their new tv's say we're listening and watching you and giving it to third parties
[02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:15.240]  so if you're dumb enough to take that in your house they can get away with it not with google though
[02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  it's not in their terms of service yet they may add it i'm not at war with 99% of people at google
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:28.760]  but at the top they admitted to wire magazine a few months ago that they were set up 16 years ago
[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:35.480]  in a government program with incutel cia to create an artificially intelligent supercomputer
[02:35:35.480 --> 02:35:44.680]  that tracks everybody and taxes everybody so it's it's just megalomania and dr robert you were
[02:35:44.680 --> 02:35:49.320]  getting into the bond market and how long it could go and what could happen and i and i'm just
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:57.400]  kind of here metaphysically wringing my hands but what do you make of just the overall bizarre
[02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:04.920]  level of flagrant violations of basic common sense human rights why would the establishment make the
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:13.400]  decision to implement things that are the opposite of a free society there seems to be a lustful
[02:36:13.400 --> 02:36:22.760]  jumping into bed with any and everything bad yes no public no institution public or private
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:29.880]  but in the west seems to any longer have any integrity now i don't think this was a decision
[02:36:29.880 --> 02:36:35.000]  made by the establishment i think it's the result of a whole bunch of forces and factors
[02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:42.120]  but it's certainly true that integrity is missing it's it's missing wherever you look
[02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:47.800]  whether it's the corporations whether it's public institutions or whether it's private
[02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:56.680]  institutions there's just no integrity and then there's no sense of oh i have to look myself in
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:37:02.440]  the mirror i've got to do so i got to behave appropriately i can't look myself in the mirror
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:08.040]  it's almost the reverse of that it says if i'm not ripping somebody off i can't look myself in the
[02:37:08.040 --> 02:37:15.000]  mirror if i'm not a crook if i'm not stealing from somebody i can't look myself in the mirror
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:21.080]  it's just a total change in values so i i certainly agree with you there's no integrity
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:30.040]  and we can't rely on it you can see this every day look we we've had one of the chief
[02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:37.320]  prosecuting attorneys of the sec we've had one of the sec commissioners herself say
[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:46.760]  that the sec is failing it doesn't do its job it issues waivers to felony actions by the banks
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:54.760]  so there's no law enforcement against the provost they're they're like
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:38:00.840]  the aristocrats of hundreds of hundreds of years ago so wherever you look you see this is
[02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:06.440]  this is the case uh the police they shoot down people in the streets including to have
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:14.120]  your hopes shorter and very very seldom is any do they suffer any consequences so
[02:38:15.320 --> 02:38:21.320]  the entire segments in the public sector are just simply becoming immune to law
[02:38:22.120 --> 02:38:28.200]  the executive branch of sense is immune to law the president says that he can kill people without
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:36.920]  any evidence on suspicion alone that he can throw people in the jail without uh bringing a case
[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:44.440]  against him in court and winning well these are horrendous things that the western civilization
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:50.520]  followed for hundreds of years centuries and centuries to stop that type of behavior and
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:55.800]  now it's all thrown away in 21st century you wrote a powerful article a few weeks ago on the
[02:38:55.800 --> 02:39:01.080]  um 800th anniversary of magna carta maybe you can speak some of that before we go to some of
[02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:04.360]  these calls and talk more about the economy or other issues you want to get into but
[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:10.360]  I think at the end of the day we've got to look in the mirror uh collectively and I think it's
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:16.440]  our lack of integrity individually even if we have integrity the average person who's decent
[02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:22.120]  we have to go further and say no to the establishment and at least do radio shows
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:26.680]  and write articles and file lawsuits and run for office things you've done and I'm not up on a
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:31.640]  high horse myself it's just that people have become spectators and they just think hey we'll
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:38.200]  let the government run it it's some complex thing we'll let and then we know that under the rubric
[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:44.040]  of national security government has become like you said the new nobility and the corporations
[02:39:44.040 --> 02:39:51.720]  have with diplomatic immunity and so the classic festering happened really bad people got in they
[02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:58.200]  recruited more people they got away with more and more and now they're emboldened to try to start
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:04.920]  war with Russia and all the rest of this craziness and it it's it it I'm worried about the planet
[02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:09.160]  itself I mean I I really think there's a good chance that I mean as you've said earlier the
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:15.400]  whole planet's in danger uh because the elite have gone completely insane yeah that's right
[02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:24.040]  I saw something just the other day it said that Americans get more upset over somebody flicking
[02:40:24.040 --> 02:40:31.640]  them the middle finger or over politically incorrect words than they do over the fact that
[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:37.880]  in the 21st century they destroyed seven countries millions of people all based on lies this doesn't
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:44.040]  upset them at all but use a politically incorrect word word and they just go berserk so I think
[02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:53.800]  that shows a huge failure in the population itself we've had a real morals taken it's okay to kill a
[02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:58.920]  million and a half Iraqis it's okay to put ISIS in charge to kill every Christian non-radical Muslim
[02:40:58.920 --> 02:41:03.080]  it's okay to wreck all these nations do all these horrible things but if you talk about about
[02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:09.160]  Caitlyn Jenner or whatever her name is you're a bad person or if you don't embrace it you're bad
[02:41:09.160 --> 02:41:14.680]  they've now been given full rights that don't matter to the establishment it's just sheer madness
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:22.840]  I agree other areas of the economy you've talked about the cook numbers forever so is John Williams
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:28.280]  what about earlier in the year 0.2 growth it doesn't really mean negative Ron Paul has said the day of
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:32.360]  reckoning is coming on the stock market you've always said it could take a lot longer than they
[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:36.200]  say for the bubble to pop even saying that for eight nine years coming on the show you've really
[02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:41.000]  been overall the most accurate in your predictions because you haven't really made a lot you just
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:45.080]  talked about the general things but in your gut I mean what do you think's happening we see all
[02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:51.560]  these elites building armored redoubts going to New Zealand we see it in the news I mean that to me
[02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:59.000]  signifies that they know this house of cards can't go on forever well usually house of cards can't
[02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:05.000]  that's what they call house of cards you know they don't stand very well this one's gone on a long
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:12.920]  time and in part because of greed people are content for it to keep going because they can keep
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:23.560]  making money so as for the first quarter growth yes I'm sure it's negative but you see as we've
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:29.800]  talked before they don't measure inflation correctly they don't measure unemployment correctly so if
[02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:37.480]  there's no inflation because they don't measure it and then you can have positive growth even though
[02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:43.640]  it's not really there and you can have a low unemployment rate if you don't measure the
[02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:50.520]  unemployed so since the measures of economic activity themselves have been perverted and no
[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:56.760]  longer have any integrity they don't really mean anything you can't tell what's going on
[02:42:56.760 --> 02:43:04.040]  by looking at their numbers you have to realize that these numbers are are rigged to make it
[02:43:04.040 --> 02:43:13.080]  look better than it is so all of that helps to support a positive psychology and until the
[02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:18.920]  psychology really turns negative on them they can keep this house of cards going so really
[02:43:18.920 --> 02:43:29.800]  America in the west has become a cult in a way yeah actually people live in the matrix they live
[02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:37.000]  in unreality and they don't see the reality in front of them every day they live in unreality
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:43.080]  and it's the function of say wall street economists is to keep this unreality going they
[02:43:43.080 --> 02:43:48.760]  you know they work for brokerage houses like Merrill Lynch and Merrill Lynch doesn't want
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:54.280]  them saying hey the economy is going to hell Merrill Lynch wants to say hey look this is this
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:44:00.120]  possible this is possible this is possible to keep people sure in the markets so the whole thing
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:05.320]  works to create false picture sure well we know this though when it finally does go belly up
[02:44:05.960 --> 02:44:10.200]  which it's got to I mean it will be more spectacular than ever I'll take a few phone
[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:15.640]  calls for Dr. Paul Craig Roberts you can find his books and more at his website paulcraigroberts.org
[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:19.240]  we have links to it on info wars.com at the bottom of every article he writes
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:24.680]  Kevin in Florida thanks for holding you're on the year from Florida thank you Alex
[02:44:25.480 --> 02:44:30.200]  my question actually maybe you could piggyback on to get your opinion on this but I just feel like
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:35.240]  once the economy goes belly up because we all know it is with the TPP and everything these
[02:44:35.240 --> 02:44:40.920]  false bonds upon these steams I just feel like the new age depression is going to be like a
[02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:48.200]  combination of like Terminator RoboCop where there's going to be a lot of GMO fed poor people and
[02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:55.400]  then they're going to have this big globalist that are going to use the drones and robots to
[02:44:55.400 --> 02:44:59.800]  protect them because they've already got them and they got you know driverless cars I wanted to
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:06.360]  get you guys just thoughts on that Dr. Roberts I mean to quantify that we know they're going to
[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:11.480]  autonomous drones autonomous robots that really removes the soldiers saying no and rebelling
[02:45:11.480 --> 02:45:16.360]  and with this whole autonomous society that's why the elite call themselves technocrats what do you
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:21.400]  think of Davos folks call themselves technocrats and installing technocrats as leaders of European
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:31.800]  nations well I kind of think there's not enough of them and then and if you get a really bad
[02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:40.040]  depression like worse than the great depression the inability to cope with the population I just
[02:45:40.040 --> 02:45:46.840]  don't know that violence on the part of the elite will work think of all the violence we applied to
[02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:54.920]  Iraq and Afghanistan and did we prevail no well the United States is a much larger place
[02:45:55.800 --> 02:46:03.480]  and so I'm not sure if the elite who may be betting on controlling the situation with
[02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:09.000]  high-tech violence whether this will work for them or not well the Pentagon now admits that
[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:13.560]  all this high-tech stuff is not subdued anybody and the truth is we're just lazy we're not scared
[02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:18.520]  if they get violent we're going to get extremely violent and it's going to be even worse I think
[02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:21.960]  that's one message for the elite to get they're not getting away with this they need to back off
[02:46:21.960 --> 02:46:26.440]  right now they don't end up in Hitler's bunker Stephen in South Carolina you're on the air with
[02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:34.760]  Dr. Paul Greg Roberts go ahead thank you Alex I wanted to ask Dr. Roberts about Vladimir Putin's
[02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:42.120]  column on this our guest column he had on today as it is it's as bad as the Cuban
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:49.880]  missile crisis was is this that point that we reached you know the choice where either we all
[02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:54.760]  go extinct or we all use this grid to make it well I didn't see Putin's article Putin said that are
[02:46:54.760 --> 02:47:00.040]  you saying Putin said that no he did not say that he just drew a line in the sand it seemed
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:06.840]  between the bricks in the west well that's another point it seems like this policy is driving people
[02:47:06.840 --> 02:47:12.280]  to Russia and actually undermining the dollar because people don't like to be bullied that Dr.
[02:47:12.280 --> 02:47:16.760]  Roberts what do you make ours is the situation currently worse than the Cuban missile crisis
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:25.000]  no because Putin doesn't represent an ideology contending for governments of the world
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:32.360]  you know the kind of co-war between the Americans and Soviets this was a different kind of clash
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:43.240]  and Putin is more or less ignoring the provocations at least publicly they may be boosting their
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:49.800]  military capabilities and their strategic capabilities but they're not replying in kind
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:57.560]  and they're not making aggressive moves they have not invaded anybody you know that's what I always
[02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:01.480]  say people say who are you for the US or Russia the like you said this is a group of criminals
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:06.200]  they're taking control of our government it's not American versus Russia and and Russia hasn't
[02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:12.440]  invaded six or seven countries in the last 15 years they've done nothing it's America doing it
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:21.960]  yeah so I think that there's not I don't think the situation is dangerous uh in the sense that
[02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:28.760]  it will come from Russia they've shown they'll take a lot of provocations without responding
[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:38.760]  in any decisive way but Putin keeps telling the United States it's a waste of time to deliver
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:46.120]  ultimatums to Russia we don't pay any attention to them and we need to work out any disagreements
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:53.560]  and I believe in diplomacy and I'm willing to talk to you at any time and work things out with you
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:48:59.800]  now it's the it's the American side that says oh no we can't you can't even be a member of our
[02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:05.560]  groups we don't want to talk to you you're Hitler you're more dangerous than the bowler blah blah
[02:49:05.560 --> 02:49:12.760]  blah so a lot of the world sees this and understands who where the problem is coming from is coming
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:18.120]  from Washington and so you know the world is a much bigger place than the United States and Europe
[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:25.000]  although the United States and Europe and dominate the world you know 19th and 20th century
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:30.600]  but it looks like that domination is is coming to an end well that's what always brings down
[02:49:30.600 --> 02:49:35.640]  empires is the hubris and we're seeing that right now one last caller real quick and I'll talk to
[02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:41.000]  others after he leaves us sherry in texas quick question thanks for calling thank you alex my
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:48.680]  question to you dr roberts is regarding the likelihood of war and instead of saying it's us
[02:49:48.680 --> 02:49:56.120]  against an obama regime or us against our administration which seems to pit us against
[02:49:56.120 --> 02:50:02.600]  ourselves as a sovereign government is it not instead like a war machine or a military industrial
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:10.360]  complex that seeks to undermine obama as president of peace and the same war machine does it not seem
[02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:15.800]  to uh pose anyone who sure sure man let me get us quick 30 second take he's got to go
[02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:20.760]  the republican democratic leadership work is one look at tpp so i don't think obama's innocent
[02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:27.560]  in this dr roberts final comment well i think she is right that the president is not as powerful as
[02:50:27.560 --> 02:50:34.120]  many of the private interest groups and there is a deep state that ten you know i think that johnny
[02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:40.680]  of kennedy was assassinated by his own government sure clear and so there are these other elements
[02:50:40.680 --> 02:50:51.240]  but still obama i think was chosen by so he is uh all right dr roberts we lost some of your skype
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:55.320]  right there thank you so much a powerful interview we'll be right back uh thank you we'll talk to

[02:53:05.240 --> 02:53:10.680]  falling apart hey did you know there's a company called id stronghold that makes shielded wallets
[02:53:10.680 --> 02:53:14.760]  to prevent electronic pickpocketing oh i didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic
[02:53:14.760 --> 02:53:19.720]  pickpocketing what is that well apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued
[02:53:19.720 --> 02:53:25.160]  have radio chips inside them called rfid the transmitter banking information to card readers
[02:53:25.160 --> 02:53:30.520]  when we pay unfortunately a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning

[02:53:35.640 --> 02:53:40.440]  sounds scary since you're getting a new wallet anyway you should definitely get an id stronghold

[02:53:55.560 --> 02:54:12.680]  and these wallets id stronghold dot com look fantastic
[02:54:12.680 --> 02:54:29.160]  this is what's happening not to summon all up we are in a trance state watching tv we're comfortable
[02:54:29.880 --> 02:54:37.800]  we're surfing towards the apocalypse economic biological chemical i mean there's so many serious
[02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:43.800]  threats and the elite only address those threats to try to then get more power but never do anything
[02:54:43.800 --> 02:54:50.440]  about it in fact make it worse and we have a very immoral west i mean russia's got this incredible
[02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:56.360]  corruption problems china's horrible but our government's moved our jobs there all these
[02:54:56.360 --> 02:55:00.360]  globalists make billions of dollars off of it but then separately want war with china
[02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:07.080]  the threat to shoot down each other's aircraft i mean i hope cool heads prevail but you get enough
[02:55:07.080 --> 02:55:13.800]  of these conflicts going somebody's going to end up pulling trigger and then where is
[02:55:13.800 --> 02:55:18.520]  katlyn jenner going to be if nukes rain down on la i mean the goddess must be saved
[02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:24.120]  and if you don't love the goddess well you're just a homophobe
[02:55:27.240 --> 02:55:30.600]  and if europe doesn't open its borders up to the billions that want to come in
[02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:37.880]  why europe's not sweet anymore i mean that's what that's what afp says there's such a will to dominate
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:43.240]  any existing middle class money in the west by the globalists during the conquer phase
[02:55:43.240 --> 02:55:47.160]  they're willing to destroy everything to get that in place i'm gonna do some overdrive and talk to
[02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:52.200]  carlos deon and jack and that's all the time we'll have in the next little segment i want to close
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:57.240]  out uh this part of the transmission just pointing out that i know i'm not perfect i don't claim to
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:03.240]  have all the answers but we're we're dialed in overall on the big picture more than any other
[02:56:03.240 --> 02:56:07.800]  transmission out there this is a hardcore broadcast and it's reaching a lot of people and it's having
[02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:12.520]  a good effect i hope tpp by a miracle doesn't pass today it looks like they have their votes
[02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:17.160]  i think that's why ted cruz first said he'd vote for it when it was close and now they've got the
[02:56:17.160 --> 02:56:22.280]  votes he says he's gonna vote against it um but whatever better late than never i mean i don't
[02:56:22.280 --> 02:56:26.760]  want to just attack ted cruz we had a bunch of gun bills passed one for him and ran paul but ran
[02:56:26.760 --> 02:56:35.240]  paul was doing the right thing from the beginning i just want the establishment who isn't corrupt
[02:56:35.240 --> 02:56:40.200]  these are not all bad to really sit back and look at things and realize that you're not safe by
[02:56:40.200 --> 02:56:46.440]  keeping your head down we're safe by doing the right thing and really dialing stuff back and

[03:00:44.120 --> 03:00:49.080]  listen comes out mainstream news that what we warned you of a decade ago is indeed going on
[03:00:50.280 --> 03:00:53.480]  we just knew they were bragging to shareholders they were doing it now
[03:00:55.480 --> 03:01:00.440]  it's just there i i mean the fact that i've gotten comfortable with this

[03:01:30.200 --> 03:01:34.920]  pretty good hold on uh the rest of us knowing what's going on in russia in the war the war
[03:01:34.920 --> 03:01:39.720]  train yes sir but uh part of them pushing propaganda the olympics and you know demonizing
[03:01:39.720 --> 03:01:44.920]  Putin how can we tell the establishment that we know what they're doing and uh they're planning
[03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:49.560]  to take over russia with the new world order but how can we all think you just tell people that
[03:01:49.560 --> 03:01:52.600]  i think you just point that out you say our government's launched six wars
[03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:57.560]  and invaded and killed millions of people russia isn't and they go what are you for the russians
[03:01:57.560 --> 03:02:03.080]  i'm for america we have foreign globalist running things here globalism is alien it's
[03:02:03.080 --> 03:02:07.640]  turning our side russia isn't signing us on to the tpp today to make the president king
[03:02:07.640 --> 03:02:14.680]  and uh and of basically it makes obama viceroy for a foreign cartel he's actually not king he's just
[03:02:14.680 --> 03:02:20.440]  the legged the imperial frontman god bless you carlos great point how do we stop this
[03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:28.520]  d on in illinois you're on the air go ahead yeah alex have you heard of ld brown
[03:02:28.520 --> 03:02:37.800]  uh a refresh memory i have heard that name uh ld brown is uh arkansas strict state trooper he
[03:02:37.800 --> 03:02:43.160]  said uh hillary and bill are swingers oh yeah i've had ld brown on the show before years ago
[03:02:43.160 --> 03:02:50.360]  in fact we should get ld brown back on yes okay uh and listen here's the issue we can if you're a
[03:02:50.360 --> 03:02:54.920]  christian or whatever you make a moral statement about that the point is it it makes them totally
[03:02:54.920 --> 03:03:01.000]  black mailable that they're part of all this sex stuff and that's what we're getting at is
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:05.560]  they're black mailable the fact that obama's bisexual that he's black mailable that's why
[03:03:05.560 --> 03:03:12.200]  they put him in there just like has to it's a pedophile sorry go ahead yeah why don't they
[03:03:12.200 --> 03:03:18.680]  just come out in the open since everyone is politically correct part of that crowd now
[03:03:18.680 --> 03:03:22.120]  and they just come out in the open with their lifestyle i think they'll probably do it when
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:26.760]  she's president and it won't matter who she kills or what she does she'll have such courage
[03:03:27.480 --> 03:03:30.360]  to admit you know but of course if a guy was having sex with all the women in the office
[03:03:30.360 --> 03:03:35.480]  it'd be terrible but with hillary it's again questioning a feminist is racism questioning
[03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:40.280]  them is rape i mean you see the video earlier the audio where a reporter is out in public and
[03:03:40.280 --> 03:03:43.240]  videotapes the and then they go they say you're raping me
[03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:50.520]  yeah it's i mean i think we're going to become decent if you don't give your wife to hillary
[03:03:50.520 --> 03:03:56.600]  you're a rapist okay everyone should just deliver their children to hillary uh you know to be her
[03:03:56.600 --> 03:03:59.800]  minions and then your wife you deliver to hillary to be her consort
[03:04:03.800 --> 03:04:10.920]  anything else sir um yeah i was going to say uh why doesn't russia erase creased
[03:04:10.920 --> 03:04:14.280]  step like it did with uh some of the south american countries
[03:04:16.280 --> 03:04:21.000]  i hear you i appreciate your call i mean russia has enough power that it could play the same
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:24.360]  games the west has been doing not to the same extent maybe one third of it that's why they
[03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:30.840]  got to be taken out the globalists can't destroy every country annihilate societies rape people's
[03:04:30.840 --> 03:04:37.720]  rights for real when there's any place to run even though that place isn't perfect it has to have
[03:04:37.720 --> 03:04:43.560]  one system to rule them all and in the darkness behind them nightly news is tonight seven o'clock
