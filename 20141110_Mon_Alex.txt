[08:55.800 --> 09:02.040]  about 6 15 this morning and I went over to info wars.com and prisonplanet.com
[09:02.040 --> 09:08.800]  and I saw this headline by Paul Watson that I think we should red link and then
[09:08.800 --> 09:15.280]  add the Ezekiel Emanuel quote to it as well and I saw the quote Obamacare
[09:15.280 --> 09:23.720]  architect quote lack of transparency was key to fooling stupid Americans close
[09:23.720 --> 09:30.800]  quote and so I went over to the c-span panel discussion and there was this
[09:30.800 --> 09:36.280]  nobody of the system working through the system of parasite his whole life in my
[09:36.280 --> 09:45.240]  view my opinion giddy and and and gibbering and blurting it out that it
[09:45.240 --> 09:48.520]  was a lack of transparency and deceiving what was really in the bill and
[09:48.520 --> 09:54.880]  hiding the fact that it was really attacks and that the ignorance of the
[09:54.880 --> 10:02.480]  electorate is how they got it done and if you look at psychology if you look at
[10:02.480 --> 10:10.160]  criminology this is what sociopaths and psychopaths do is they revel in getting
[10:10.160 --> 10:16.400]  together in their confabs and their conclaves in their gaggles in their
[10:16.400 --> 10:22.000]  murders that's what a large group of crows is called a murder they like to get
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.160]  together like ring race around their victim and celebrate their open power
[10:28.160 --> 10:32.040]  yes you've seized the country yes you have a private bank called the Federal
[10:32.040 --> 10:37.680]  Reserve and ruling us for 101 years this December yes you've dumbed down the
[10:37.680 --> 10:42.640]  public from the smartest toughest most creative group in the world to the one
[10:42.640 --> 10:47.200]  of the dumbest most pathetic groups on average but there's still kernels of
[10:47.200 --> 10:50.920]  greatness there there's still the ghost of the republic that could rise like a
[10:50.920 --> 10:58.520]  phoenix with the spirit of George Washington it's missed that's why you
[10:58.520 --> 11:06.080]  fear it because you know countries and ideas can rise like the phoenix like
[11:06.080 --> 11:15.920]  Lazarus from the dead and so you celebrate your open evil Obamacare
[11:15.920 --> 11:25.160]  architect lack of transparency was key key understand folks they wrote it we
[11:25.160 --> 11:29.360]  read the subsections we knew what it would do and they had seen an MSNBC call
[11:29.360 --> 11:33.200]  you racist call you anti-woman brush limbaugh is getting ready to sue the
[11:33.200 --> 11:39.560]  democrats I think you should I could sue him my lawyer says yes you'd win I've
[11:39.560 --> 11:44.560]  got listed Texas Monthly actually the top lawyer he's been number three once
[11:44.560 --> 11:48.640]  number one another time the point is is yes I can win but what's the point you
[11:48.640 --> 11:54.880]  guys just credit yourselves Obamacare architect lack of transparency was
[11:54.880 --> 12:04.440]  key to fooling stupid Americans and again if you study criminology they
[12:04.440 --> 12:10.080]  always get bolder and bolder psychopaths on average will kill one person a year
[12:10.080 --> 12:14.920]  be very fastidious about how they do it get away with it for 10 20 30 years then
[12:14.920 --> 12:19.200]  suddenly they go crazy and start killing somebody every week and get caught
[12:19.200 --> 12:22.760]  they'll start dumping dead bodies out the police station they'll start mailing
[12:22.760 --> 12:25.800]  the cops taunting letters I mean everybody knows about it it's famous
[12:25.800 --> 12:31.760]  that's what this is they're reckless and they want to be destroyed they want to
[12:31.760 --> 12:37.720]  be caught because dominating us and destroying us isn't enough they want us
[12:37.720 --> 12:42.600]  to know and they want some more risk in it because it makes it funner for them
[12:42.600 --> 12:46.160]  a lot of people rob banks and stuff not just for the money they like the
[12:46.160 --> 12:51.000]  excitement like the Judas Priest song breaking the law breaking the law
[12:51.000 --> 12:58.720]  breaking the law breaking the law in a newly uncovered video which is public
[12:58.720 --> 13:04.280]  Obamacare architect Jonathan grubber what a perfect name nothing it's German
[13:04.280 --> 13:11.520]  names grubber admits that a lack of transparency was key in getting the
[13:11.520 --> 13:15.960]  Affordable Care Act passed because the stupidity of the American voter that's
[13:15.960 --> 13:22.640]  a close quote would have otherwise killed the bill
[13:25.080 --> 13:30.040]  from 2009 to 2010 grubber a professional a professor of economics at
[13:30.040 --> 13:33.440]  Massachusetts technology served as a technical consultant the Obama
[13:33.440 --> 13:38.080]  administration during which time he helped craft the patient protection
[13:38.080 --> 13:42.640]  Affordable Care Act more commonly known as the giant rape the American people
[13:42.640 --> 13:48.200]  death panel screw job act excuse me I didn't the monumental galactic fraud act
[13:48.200 --> 13:54.880]  the member when Obama came out with the phone number 1-800-FU actually spelled
[13:54.880 --> 13:59.520]  out the whole thing and then they released another one that said like screw
[13:59.520 --> 14:05.040]  you people said wait wait there's no if it's not an accident they're here to
[14:05.040 --> 14:09.960]  destroy you and your family I'm gonna play the clip and I'm gonna play is
[14:09.960 --> 14:14.160]  equal Immanuel who wants death panels and to kill people at 75 saying the same
[14:14.160 --> 14:21.320]  thing do you understand it's meant to wreck the system period well know why
[14:21.320 --> 14:26.240]  I'm angry I don't know what somebody says they're screwing me and my family and
[14:26.240 --> 14:29.960]  your family and laughing at me while they do it and try to wreck the health
[14:29.960 --> 14:34.200]  care system to get government control and death panels not just for the troops
[14:34.200 --> 14:38.560]  see where we have government control is an example of how you live I knew six
[14:38.560 --> 14:41.680]  years ago they started completely already been abusing them they started
[14:41.680 --> 14:46.480]  putting trips on no treatment list Joe Biggs is basically on one no matter how
[14:46.480 --> 14:50.160]  many times he goes back he can't get surgery for a bad knee internal bleeding
[14:50.160 --> 14:56.520]  all sorts of stuff they put you whether you're 25 or 75 on a list and you don't
[14:56.520 --> 14:59.720]  get health care and then it came out that they're on a death list don't treat
[14:59.720 --> 15:05.440]  it's not even ration care see in England it's the same system it's a socialist
[15:05.440 --> 15:08.800]  eugenics system I watched the parliamentary hearings all the time on
[15:08.800 --> 15:13.360]  c-span you'll have an operable brain tumor that's 97% operable in the
[15:13.360 --> 15:16.680]  particular speech I saw and Tony Blair was prime minister at the time he admitted
[15:16.680 --> 15:21.480]  it the opposition got it and said we have thousands of people waiting for lung
[15:21.480 --> 15:25.080]  surgery heart surgery brain surgery where it's operable but you make them wait
[15:25.080 --> 15:28.920]  18 months and they die and then they gave the example the brain tumor that's
[15:28.920 --> 15:32.200]  operable if it's done within a few months but they make the guy wait a year by
[15:32.200 --> 15:36.640]  then the brain tumor killed them Tony Blair said yes it's true we've messed
[15:36.640 --> 15:39.960]  up their problems see they'll admit they've quote messed up no it's on
[15:39.960 --> 15:44.840]  purpose and then say they're going to fix it FEMA really messed up we need
[15:44.840 --> 15:52.040]  double funding they always mess up and they need more power to get it fixed
[15:52.040 --> 15:56.280]  no they're not messing up the mid-level and low-level compartmentalized people
[15:56.280 --> 16:01.200]  go why is this agency so screwed up why do we do this why am I okay the
[16:01.200 --> 16:04.640]  computer says don't give you treatment but I'm not supposed to tell you that I
[16:04.640 --> 16:07.240]  guess it's they don't have enough resources but we're all sitting around
[16:07.240 --> 16:12.000]  here we could do surgeries just as prescribed pills that's what Obama care
[16:12.000 --> 16:18.680]  is it's globalized where the doctors can't make decisions you understand that
[16:18.680 --> 16:23.160]  this is it you want Canadian or British health care Paul Watson a couple years
[16:23.160 --> 16:28.120]  ago was coughing up blood for three weeks had horrible strep in his lungs
[16:28.120 --> 16:31.540]  kept going to the state-run system couldn't get to private care till they
[16:31.540 --> 16:34.240]  authorized him they have to give you permission to then go to a private
[16:34.240 --> 16:38.240]  clinic they kept giving him a little pack like the military does with some
[16:38.240 --> 16:45.120]  aspirin Tylenol and stuff in it and he had stuff eating his lungs and they
[16:45.120 --> 16:49.840]  wouldn't give him help that's government control do you understand and now
[16:49.840 --> 16:55.360]  it's all happening and you're getting double tripling of your premiums now
[16:55.360 --> 16:58.920]  they should get ready it's about to go even more every one I know it's roughly
[16:58.920 --> 17:06.160]  doubled everyone some Texas plans like Humana we showed has gone up 500 plus
[17:06.160 --> 17:10.840]  percent we'll show the headline do you understand and then they get up on
[17:10.840 --> 17:15.800]  television listen to him like being Machiavellian and lying is a huge
[17:15.800 --> 17:19.120]  advantage lack of transparency is a huge political advantage he added and
[17:19.120 --> 17:22.920]  basically call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever but basically
[17:22.920 --> 17:28.680]  that was really critical for the thing to pass look I wish Mark was right we
[17:28.680 --> 17:32.600]  could be transparent but I'd rather have this law than not so he's saying we
[17:32.600 --> 17:38.720]  premeditatedly lied to you on purpose on television to bring in something that
[17:38.720 --> 17:44.920]  makes healthy people pay more and they're sitting around Democrats going I'm
[17:44.920 --> 17:50.960]  sorry we've got to deceive people do you understand these are not liberals now
[17:50.960 --> 17:53.800]  this guy may be a useful idiot and believes it's good to have social a
[17:53.800 --> 17:58.200]  system it's only the social system it's a eugenics fascist system let's go to the
[17:58.200 --> 18:02.960]  clip of a gruber it's just you can't do it politically you just literally cannot
[18:02.960 --> 18:06.640]  do it okay transparent financing and let's not transfer financing all the
[18:06.640 --> 18:11.680]  transparent spending I mean the this bill was written in a tortured way to make
[18:11.680 --> 18:15.920]  sure CBO did not score the mandate this taxes if CBO scored the mandates taxes
[18:15.920 --> 18:21.200]  the bill dies okay so it's written to do that in terms of in terms of risk-rated
[18:21.200 --> 18:24.800]  subsidies to get a law which said healthy people are going to pay in it
[18:24.800 --> 18:27.400]  made explicit the hell who will pay in sick people get money it would not have
[18:27.400 --> 18:32.560]  passed okay just like the cow people transparent lack of transparency is a
[18:32.560 --> 18:36.640]  huge political advantage and basically you know call it the stupidity of the
[18:36.640 --> 18:41.280]  American voter or whatever but basically that was really really critical to get
[18:41.280 --> 18:44.840]  anything to pass and you know it's a second best argument look I wish Mark was
[18:44.840 --> 18:48.360]  right we can make it all transparent but I'd rather have this law than not so it's
[18:48.360 --> 18:51.520]  kind of like his reporter story you know yeah I wish I could change but yeah
[18:51.520 --> 18:54.360]  there you go go ahead a lot of reporters yeah my whole clips up on the
[18:54.360 --> 18:58.200]  fours.com view you want to get nauseated of course he's being deceptive here as
[18:58.200 --> 19:02.720]  well we're a lot of people bringing the screw job so healthy people can pay for
[19:02.720 --> 19:07.520]  sick people no no it's phasing out the free health care that the states and
[19:07.520 --> 19:11.000]  cities and charities had and federalizing everything and let me tell
[19:11.000 --> 19:15.960]  you this economist knows I can look at those little piggy eyes and these people
[19:15.960 --> 19:20.600]  that are into evil and deception are weak so they've decided to cheat in life
[19:20.600 --> 19:26.720]  to defeat those of us that are moral and then they've also dumbed down the general
[19:26.720 --> 19:30.080]  public so even if you're moral you're this well-meaning bleeding heart that
[19:30.080 --> 19:34.560]  goes I want to do Obamacare to help people you know there's rich people we

[24:11.200 --> 24:17.400]  by the way if you just joined us Anthony Guthrie arting went up to Dallas this
[24:17.400 --> 24:24.920]  weekend to investigate you know we had a medical doctor on three weeks ago it
[24:24.920 --> 24:32.760]  made national news out of Missouri who named the hospital where doctors had
[24:32.760 --> 24:36.560]  told him that people that they appeared to have a bowl or being disappeared then
[24:36.560 --> 24:43.360]  we had senior board patrol people on on record off record it became a national
[24:43.360 --> 24:49.800]  news story but died well Anthony this weekend went up to Dallas to
[24:49.800 --> 24:55.760]  investigate and the doctors are very scared they think the hospitals are
[24:55.760 --> 24:59.040]  gonna get the liability and the blame for being part of this cover-up you know
[24:59.040 --> 25:03.440]  the Forbes writer last week came out and said he was at a press conference with
[25:03.440 --> 25:07.160]  the CDC head and that the AP and everybody were talking about how they
[25:07.160 --> 25:13.760]  agreed to cover up what appeared to be a bowl of cases so it's confirmed now and
[25:13.760 --> 25:21.680]  what Anthony discovered I don't even know if I want to get him on today I
[25:22.520 --> 25:28.120]  I think I might want to write articles about it and then not gather more proof
[25:28.120 --> 25:36.040]  but just think about this story and how we want to put it out not to spin it I
[25:36.040 --> 25:44.120]  just need to mull it over because it's it's it's real bad
[25:46.240 --> 25:51.640]  this country is so screwed up ladies and gentlemen the public has no idea what's
[25:51.640 --> 25:55.040]  going on because they're blissfully ignorant and they're counting on our
[25:55.040 --> 26:01.240]  ignorance I use the example 50 times the last few months the board patrol said
[26:01.240 --> 26:04.160]  we've been ordered to stand down in January it took us four or five months
[26:04.160 --> 26:07.160]  to go down and confirm it and then the New York Times had to admit it a month
[26:07.160 --> 26:10.720]  later that they load them on buses and give them vouchers our government does
[26:10.720 --> 26:14.320]  at the border and ship them wherever they want to go and then more patrol
[26:14.320 --> 26:19.680]  agents came out and said we complete the smuggling process on Fox News triple
[26:19.680 --> 26:24.400]  confirming what we reported but we showed the emergency manager in the city of
[26:24.400 --> 26:27.760]  McAllen saying no we're here and they give them the vouchers and we load them on
[26:27.760 --> 26:32.320]  buses we were sent down there by an ice whistleblower we met with them in a
[26:32.320 --> 26:37.120]  hotel room they didn't even want their voice recorded they we're gonna send
[26:37.120 --> 26:40.400]  reporters back down there and the reason I raise this is if they can hide
[26:40.400 --> 26:44.920]  bringing millions of people in and let me tell you it's millions it's 300,000
[26:44.920 --> 26:48.080]  kids they're now saying and that's only 17% of what's come in in the board
[26:48.080 --> 26:53.360]  patrol numbers and that's what we know about so what's 17% of 300,000 now in
[26:53.360 --> 26:59.040]  the last year roughly I don't know it's it's it's it's it's millions millions
[26:59.040 --> 27:03.360]  that have come in there's the headline caught red-handed board patrol paying
[27:03.360 --> 27:08.440]  the ship illegals deep in the US you can watch the video there info wars.com if
[27:08.440 --> 27:11.360]  they can cover up millions of people being brought in and the government
[27:11.360 --> 27:18.200]  putting them on buses and little info wars has to go expose it you know AP
[27:18.200 --> 27:23.400]  Reuters Fox News all of them the New York Times they're all down there they all
[27:23.400 --> 27:29.840]  know too don't you think board patrols gone to them they do go to them don't
[27:29.840 --> 27:35.800]  you think Tosh Plumlee went to Fox News first and CNN yes they come to us
[27:35.800 --> 27:39.880]  because they know we will verify their story and then go with it why do you
[27:39.880 --> 27:43.680]  think federal marshals and state police come to us with secret documents on
[27:43.680 --> 27:48.600]  targeting the Liberty Movement because nobody else believe them we weren't the
[27:48.600 --> 27:53.640]  first people they went to but because we've been doing this so long we now
[27:53.640 --> 27:58.840]  are the first people folks go to and by the way I don't like that
[27:58.840 --> 28:04.920]  responsibility I am sick of this 20-year war I've been in I'm not scared of these
[28:04.920 --> 28:12.440]  people I get so angry at people like Ezekiel Emanuel and Gruber making jokes
[28:12.440 --> 28:16.160]  about Obamacare when it's got death panels for old people for handicapped
[28:16.160 --> 28:20.880]  kids for the veterans and is screwing everybody over to shut the economy down
[28:20.880 --> 28:25.520]  and raping everybody's paycheck it's like being mugged every month by these
[28:25.520 --> 28:30.760]  smiley face pieces of crap and I'm sorry to be talking like that but I mean what
[28:30.760 --> 28:36.160]  won't we put up with in this country I want that stinking Republican Party to
[28:36.160 --> 28:41.200]  repeal the whole thing right now and I want criminal investigations we have the
[28:41.200 --> 28:46.480]  criminals bragging about deceiving us in a giant screw job and and deceiving
[28:46.480 --> 28:50.240]  Congress and not calling it a tax Congress wasn't deceived they played
[28:50.240 --> 28:55.480]  along I want the people in this monumental screw job admitting they've
[28:55.480 --> 28:59.960]  committed the deception for money in the public purse that will hurt the public
[28:59.960 --> 29:07.040]  good and kill people I want them indicted I am sick of watching the feds
[29:07.040 --> 29:10.400]  harass there's an article out today about the feds harassing the Liberty
[29:10.400 --> 29:14.960]  Movement with CBS reporters and others talking about it is Barack Obama
[29:14.960 --> 29:18.240]  attempting to harass and intimidate media personalities on his resume list and
[29:18.240 --> 29:23.440]  it just goes through the case we come back I'm gonna play the clip of Ezekiel
[29:23.440 --> 29:27.880]  Emanuel just laughing and saying it's meant to wreck health care you

[34:36.360 --> 34:46.600]  human tyranny that's what's going on and they're so arrogant that people like a
[34:46.600 --> 34:51.840]  Zika Emmanuel last year go on Fox News and say yeah the plan is to bankrupt
[34:51.840 --> 34:57.240]  health care and force it into a national health care system let me explain
[34:57.240 --> 35:01.120]  something you socialists that want that have you actually lived in Europe or
[35:01.120 --> 35:07.200]  lived in England or Canada they hate it they dread it it is a disaster by
[35:07.200 --> 35:13.600]  design you really thought you'd get that free lottery ticket you really thought
[35:13.600 --> 35:16.960]  you'd throw that hell marrying and make it you really think they've already
[35:16.960 --> 35:20.360]  seduced the nation the globalists have already taken over much of the planet
[35:20.360 --> 35:25.000]  now they're going to start cutting the chicken feet off because it's time to
[35:25.000 --> 35:34.040]  butcher it's time to call the herd they're done it's a post industrial world
[35:34.040 --> 35:39.880]  the world's being built to be savage and to have a reduction in the population a
[35:39.880 --> 35:44.600]  fallen failed world by design because that's what the spirit of the world
[35:44.600 --> 35:49.160]  wants to build only the elites will have technology only the elites will have
[35:49.160 --> 35:55.680]  life extension only the elites will have life in the final equation imagine
[35:55.680 --> 35:59.320]  government with foreign corporations controlling it running your health care
[35:59.320 --> 36:03.160]  telling your doctor via computer terminal what to do now as a social
[36:03.160 --> 36:09.000]  service agent of the system because until now a lot of people in the social
[36:09.000 --> 36:13.640]  service system have not been bad now you'll be a biological robot that follows
[36:13.640 --> 36:19.280]  the computer's orders and the GPS in your car's orders or you will be relieved
[36:19.280 --> 36:24.600]  of your job you're having your discretion taken away and there is a great
[36:24.600 --> 36:28.320]  awakening happening because if we don't fully awake we will be overtaken by
[36:28.320 --> 36:33.880]  scientific evil now let's play the clip of Ezekiel Emmanuel the White House
[36:33.880 --> 36:38.000]  chief of staff's brother the doctor who just wrote an article a few weeks ago
[36:38.000 --> 36:43.080]  for Time Magazine saying we should get rid of people by law at 75 basically here
[36:43.080 --> 36:47.840]  he is admitting what Obamacare was meant to do a torpedo to bring down the system
[36:47.840 --> 36:52.160]  people who knew the law as it was being written knew the president wasn't
[36:52.160 --> 36:55.080]  telling the truth the grandfather provision written into the law itself
[36:55.080 --> 36:59.280]  was too narrow and frankly they wrote a regulation intentionally trying to get
[36:59.280 --> 37:02.360]  people out of the individual market they want the people to go into the
[37:02.360 --> 37:05.680]  exchanges because there's a lot of people in the individual market the whole
[37:05.680 --> 37:08.800]  point of the exchanges is to close down the individual insurance market
[37:08.800 --> 37:13.320]  insurance company wanted to move millions of people into the insurance companies
[37:13.320 --> 37:17.080]  don't like the individual market as it's
[37:17.080 --> 37:20.680]  constructed they see the future that individual market is going away they
[37:20.680 --> 37:28.640]  don't want to invest in it another Lord of the Rings analogy where Gandalf in
[37:28.640 --> 37:36.640]  the Fellowship of the Ring the first one goes in and is talking to Saruman and
[37:36.640 --> 37:41.520]  he turns him and he says you must join with Sauron it is the future it's
[37:41.520 --> 37:46.760]  already happened nothing can stand in its way see the future there is only one
[37:46.760 --> 37:51.600]  way to go that's what they always do this is the way to go world government a
[37:51.600 --> 37:56.080]  microchip population is here the population will be reduced and you
[37:56.080 --> 38:00.320]  should join with the system and work and make yourself worthy so that you and
[38:00.320 --> 38:05.240]  your family can live in the new future world and one of the handful of a
[38:05.240 --> 38:10.720]  fluent mega cities join with the new world order and you can have the life
[38:10.720 --> 38:17.480]  extension join with it and your family can be safe join with it and you can be
[38:17.480 --> 38:22.360]  protected from the mob of the public that will tear you apart and doesn't want
[38:22.360 --> 38:30.960]  you and doesn't want to be helped join with world governance it's who you
[38:30.960 --> 38:37.480]  belong with I have been given that speech but a little bit milder about
[38:37.480 --> 38:45.160]  eight times by powerful corporate heads billionaires you name it I've even had
[38:45.160 --> 38:48.160]  to have the Kissinger Group on once Rothkopf and I said it during the break
[38:48.160 --> 38:50.200]  John Harmon heard it but he also said it on air we're gonna find the nerve you
[38:50.200 --> 38:53.520]  rear it I said why'd you really come on here and he goes I just thought we could
[38:53.520 --> 38:57.600]  reach out to you and you'd be reasonable Alex you're in your own superclass you
[38:57.600 --> 39:01.040]  know it's the person the questioning things and your capital is gonna go up
[39:01.040 --> 39:03.720]  with the public as a lot of things happen there's about to be a big power
[39:03.720 --> 39:09.600]  struggle the future is set though Alex so and basically they could just see the
[39:09.600 --> 39:12.840]  fact that when I'm saying is right so they know that I'm gonna rise in
[39:12.840 --> 39:16.680]  popularity as all this truth comes out so they're saying you go ahead and do
[39:16.680 --> 39:21.600]  that but at the time be ready to join us or be destroyed
[39:21.600 --> 39:32.600]  you understand how real all this is that I've been up in skyscrapers in LA and
[39:32.600 --> 39:40.800]  New York in huge offices back when I was making almost no money but had a big
[39:40.800 --> 39:47.280]  audience they could see the metric and they said to me over and over again
[39:47.280 --> 39:51.960]  happen locally happen in New York they it's a line it's how they everybody else
[39:51.960 --> 39:55.720]  to sell it they said you can be on this crusade you have a power to reach
[39:55.720 --> 40:01.200]  through the microphone and grab people people follow your spirit they resonate
[40:01.200 --> 40:06.200]  with you but you're not going anywhere on this crusade you want to be a star up
[40:06.200 --> 40:11.640]  there with all the other stars do you want to be assured your place we're the
[40:11.640 --> 40:16.000]  people that understand you and appreciate you we don't want to destroy you the
[40:16.000 --> 40:23.080]  public does want to destroy you join us and that's what all these little piggy
[40:23.080 --> 40:33.800]  people have done Ezekiel Emanuel and this Obama advisor Jonathan Grubber saying
[40:33.800 --> 40:38.480]  oh yeah we lie to the public oh yeah we deceive them and so we've got to deceive
[40:38.480 --> 40:46.960]  the media too oh you're letting it on the line do you understand the people
[40:46.960 --> 40:50.760]  running things put fluoride in the water to brain damage everybody do you
[40:50.760 --> 40:56.040]  really want to be in bed with those people do you feel safe trying to build
[40:56.040 --> 41:02.120]  a panopticonic omnipresent computer assisted world government with elites
[41:02.120 --> 41:06.960]  that publicly meet constantly to try to bring in world government merge with
[41:06.960 --> 41:16.040]  machines and live forever ABC news London Guardian it's just constant I talked
[41:16.040 --> 41:19.600]  about it when it wasn't in public publications it was in their own books
[41:19.600 --> 41:24.520]  and stuff which you could say are public but only read by them now it's
[41:24.520 --> 41:28.560]  everywhere it's in the video games the culture because they're going operational
[41:28.560 --> 41:33.200]  they're now entering the in-game stretch in the next 10 20 years we've held them
[41:33.200 --> 41:40.120]  back a lot but this isn't a game I told you Obama would come out and say that he
[41:40.120 --> 41:47.720]  was going to federalize the internet to protect it I'm gonna break that down that
[41:47.720 --> 41:55.680]  announcement's been made Obama calls for the FCC to protect the internet kind of
[41:55.680 --> 42:00.280]  like the mafia 100 years ago and say New York would say somebody burnt down a
[42:00.280 --> 42:03.640]  grocery store a few weeks ago because they didn't pay for insurance from the
[42:03.640 --> 42:11.320]  family you might want to you know you ask us to come in and hire some of our
[42:11.320 --> 42:15.080]  people and we'll keep an eye on the place for you and pay us 20% of what
[42:15.080 --> 42:20.000]  you bring in and we'll even shut down your competition and you'll be part of
[42:20.000 --> 42:28.360]  the crew so the FCC is gonna come in and protect protect the internet you're
[42:28.360 --> 42:43.080]  gonna break your legs you like your daughter you like living like that
[42:43.080 --> 42:48.440]  well you're about to okay a nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves and you
[42:48.440 --> 42:53.200]  beg on your knees to be slaves all these fat weak cowards sit up there on
[42:53.200 --> 42:57.320]  television and tell you they're lying to your family and tell you they're gonna
[42:57.320 --> 43:01.840]  break your bank and bring you under that filthy control and puts you in their
[43:01.840 --> 43:06.160]  government housing pins to run your life and bring you down and imprison your
[43:06.160 --> 43:13.520]  children and you submit to it with pleasure well not me ever now let's go
[43:13.520 --> 43:20.720]  back to this clip of the loving little little trendy giggling and snickering
[43:20.720 --> 43:26.840]  with a group of academics about lying to everyone and how powerful it is to lie
[43:26.840 --> 43:33.200]  how good they are oh yes here it is it's just you can't do it politically you
[43:33.200 --> 43:36.840]  just literally cannot do it okay transparent financing unless I
[43:36.840 --> 43:41.680]  transfer anything also transparent spending I mean the this bill was written
[43:41.680 --> 43:46.000]  in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes is CBO
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.520]  scored the mandates taxes the bill dies okay so it's written to do that in terms
[43:50.520 --> 43:54.440]  of in terms of risk-rated subsidies if you know law which said healthy people
[43:54.440 --> 43:57.880]  are gonna pay in it made explicit the hell he'll pay in sick people get money
[43:57.880 --> 44:02.720]  it would not have passed okay just like the count people transparent lack of
[44:02.720 --> 44:07.000]  transparency is a huge political advantage and basically you know call
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.840]  it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever but basically that was really
[44:10.840 --> 44:14.280]  really critical to get in the thing to pass and you know it's a second best
[44:14.280 --> 44:17.840]  argument look I wish Mark was right we can make it all transparent but I'd
[44:17.840 --> 44:21.000]  rather have this law than not so it's kind of like his reporter story you know
[44:21.000 --> 44:24.760]  yeah the things I wish I could change but I'd rather have this law than not so
[44:24.760 --> 44:30.000]  lie to get something because you're the good guys and that's a lie too we have
[44:30.000 --> 44:45.240]  fellow Schlafly coming up here is the headline Obama says FCC should reclassify
[44:45.240 --> 44:53.600]  internet as a utility protected and run like water by the government oh yes and
[44:53.600 --> 44:58.040]  then they subdivide it and sell it off a special interest and the inventor of the
[44:58.040 --> 45:01.080]  internet no it's not Al Gore he's over anything when others have said this plan
[45:01.080 --> 45:05.960]  worldwide is being pushed they're trying to line it up right now with the Asian
[45:05.960 --> 45:09.800]  Pacific partnership that seeds control to select corporations that then
[45:09.800 --> 45:13.880]  operate through government that treaty secret but it got leaked last year as
[45:13.880 --> 45:17.600]  you know president Obama has come out in support of reclassifying internet
[45:17.600 --> 45:22.440]  service as a utility a move that would allow the federal communications
[45:22.440 --> 45:30.080]  commission ah ah to enforce more robust regulations and put tech net
[45:30.080 --> 45:35.760]  neutrality do you really believe that see key robust regulations to put these
[45:35.760 --> 45:39.400]  protections in place I'm asking the FCC to reclassify internet service under
[45:39.400 --> 45:43.840]  title to the new law known as telecommunications act Obama says in a
[45:43.840 --> 45:48.040]  statement this morning in plain English you can keep your doctor if you want your
[45:48.040 --> 45:50.960]  doctor raising the debt limit doesn't raise the debt limit you didn't build
[45:50.960 --> 45:55.200]  your business it's always the same thing in plain English I'm asking the FCC to
[45:55.200 --> 45:58.320]  read to recognize that for most Americans the internet has become an
[45:58.320 --> 46:01.720]  essential part everyday communication and everyday life yeah this is part of
[46:01.720 --> 46:05.520]  this has been the plan for a decade free quote Wi-Fi that's paid for by
[46:05.520 --> 46:09.440]  taxpayers but you have no rights on that Wi-Fi and you can't get to info wars
[46:09.440 --> 46:15.200]  calm our drudge report calm that the White House officials have said they
[46:15.200 --> 46:23.560]  want to shut down basically so this is it they're coming drums drums drums of
[46:23.560 --> 46:25.800]  the deep
[46:30.240 --> 46:33.440]  they're moving on every front but you know why they're moving on every front
[46:33.440 --> 46:37.360]  because what they're doing is horrible and evil and it's failing on many fronts
[46:37.360 --> 46:42.240]  and so they've got to have their little snakes come out and go yeah we lie there
[46:42.240 --> 46:46.280]  are death panels I could play Bill Gates saying yeah we gonna kill an old lady to
[46:46.280 --> 46:49.200]  give you 10 jobs and the teachers are some of them are kind of smiling they
[46:49.200 --> 46:54.400]  aren't sick ooh but others are going huh because they understand oh yeah we're
[46:54.400 --> 46:58.200]  gonna kill somebody to give you a job yeah right you make jobs by taking care
[46:58.200 --> 47:02.280]  of people you make jobs by caring about everybody the economy is just people
[47:02.280 --> 47:06.880]  dealing with each other and having industry not regulated and run by
[47:06.880 --> 47:11.280]  central government they want them it's just it's so incredible to have Hillary
[47:11.280 --> 47:16.080]  come out and say businesses don't hire people everybody knows it's government
[47:16.080 --> 47:19.160]  and she couldn't even look at the crowd when she said it she was just looking
[47:19.160 --> 47:24.600]  down because the psych warfare chiefs have told them overthrow reality the
[47:24.600 --> 47:29.240]  voters are dumbed down but they know we're lying now so be so bold that you
[47:29.240 --> 47:35.040]  just psychologically inoculate them to cuckoo bird behavior and I mean I've
[47:35.040 --> 47:40.560]  read their psyops that they're public just like they're publicly saying they're
[47:40.560 --> 47:45.000]  lying to you what do you do when it comes out that they've got tens of
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.360]  thousands of veterans who won't get leg surgery won't get heart surgery won't
[47:50.360 --> 47:54.000]  get brain surgery won't get skin cancer removed they go and they say here's some
[47:54.000 --> 47:59.760]  pills and they're in a database to not give them care because they decided you
[47:59.760 --> 48:03.000]  don't have a quality of life they decided you're dangerous you're a weapon
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.960]  that's obsolete they're moving on to drones and robots now and they don't want
[48:06.960 --> 48:11.440]  old weapons left laying around and you're being murdered and you're going
[48:11.440 --> 48:16.360]  to be hunted down when all this comes down you're officially the enemy with
[48:16.360 --> 48:20.960]  the younger soldiers and the younger police that are being trained to hunt
[48:20.960 --> 48:26.000]  you down this is just a high-tech version of what the Soviets and the Nazis
[48:26.000 --> 48:32.440]  and the Chinese communists and Fidel Castro and every other nutball dead you
[48:32.440 --> 48:36.640]  think they like the men that bring them to power you think Hitler did you you
[48:36.640 --> 48:43.320]  think they like having you around these little cowardly people they hate you they
[48:43.320 --> 48:46.360]  want total control because they don't like wealth they don't like power they
[48:46.360 --> 48:51.800]  don't like success do you think they like strong hardcore men who've killed a
[48:51.800 --> 48:57.280]  bunch of people you think they actually like the real instrument they fear you
[48:57.280 --> 49:03.720]  they hate you they shake they're going to destroy you so you go ahead and you
[49:03.720 --> 49:08.520]  serve them and you sell your family out and you sell your name out and you sell
[49:08.520 --> 49:14.840]  your soul out because I guess they are God little weak professors on television
[49:14.840 --> 49:22.440]  admitting they screwed everybody to rape America is that really who we are is
[49:22.440 --> 49:29.440]  that really what we've become to bow to a bunch of lying scum and suits because
[49:29.440 --> 49:33.040]  I'm telling you that's what it is all you got to do is wake up and get angry
[49:33.040 --> 49:36.040]  and start making moves against them politically in different ways and
[49:36.040 --> 49:40.720]  spreading the word and having moral authority on your side when they
[49:40.720 --> 49:44.680]  giggle and snap and laugh at you like like the city officials do here we
[49:44.680 --> 49:48.400]  bring up fluoride in the water or roadless you know warrantless checkpoints
[49:48.400 --> 49:51.960]  taking blood they giggle and laugh like you don't have power because they're
[49:51.960 --> 49:56.320]  totally scared it's a confidence game like with a lion the lion tamers have
[49:56.320 --> 50:00.760]  to act totally confident beat that lion keep it under submission dominate it
[50:00.760 --> 50:05.120]  because if you ever want show fear one time when your head's in its mouth
[50:05.120 --> 50:09.760]  snap like a bear trap on your head and you've got this little potbellied lion
[50:09.760 --> 50:14.840]  tamer with their little whip and we're this giant 70 trillion pound lion just
[50:14.840 --> 50:20.080]  human liberty freedom honor everything and they got this little whip with us
[50:20.080 --> 50:25.520]  bowing to him busy beat us on the head I'm sick of it I'm tired of it I'm not
[50:25.520 --> 50:29.720]  afraid of them these people will hold our species back they will screw
[50:29.720 --> 50:35.280]  everything that our ancestors fought and died to survive through hell to pass on
[50:35.280 --> 50:39.320]  a baton to us to have a future and I'm telling you from the foundations of the
[50:39.320 --> 50:42.760]  earth these people were not meant to succeed and dominate greater men and
[50:42.760 --> 50:49.640]  women so I'm here to beg God to give me the strength and the words to unlock the
[50:49.640 --> 50:55.880]  spirit of humanity with a huge awakening to bring these people down
[50:55.880 --> 51:01.160]  forever and to bind them for him silver has always been nature's very own
[51:01.160 --> 51:04.800]  antibiotic and only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of

[54:30.200 --> 54:33.640]  about we told you this a long time ago it's how they control major governments
[54:33.640 --> 54:40.400]  XMI 6 chief Peter Heyman named as VIP who sexually abused boys at dolphin
[54:40.400 --> 54:45.640]  square apartment complex near parliament and that's how they blackmail folks as
[54:45.640 --> 54:49.560]  they'll only put pedophiles especially in England in the highest positions
[54:49.560 --> 54:55.120]  Heyman was a member of the pedophile information exchange the former
[54:55.120 --> 54:59.480]  deputy director of MI6 Peter Heyman sexually abused young boys and

[55:07.360 --> 55:12.880]  was not prosecuted and remembered Seville was hanging out with the royal
[55:12.880 --> 55:17.000]  family and was found with secret rooms and molested hundreds of people but it's
[55:17.000 --> 55:21.400]  a lot and again David I spoke about him a decade before it came out I think
[55:21.400 --> 55:24.760]  about David I so much that stuff he said I would like delay him on air a few
[55:24.760 --> 55:30.160]  times like 10 years ago I would say hit the delay and we would hit the delay
[55:30.160 --> 55:33.080]  when he would say some stuff because I didn't even want it on air I was like
[55:33.080 --> 55:36.800]  how could he be naming former prime ministers and people and stuff slitting
[55:36.800 --> 55:40.240]  children's throats and then it just more and more of it starts to come out it's
[55:40.240 --> 55:49.360]  very scary stuff folks very scary stuff I got really mad earlier instead of

[55:55.560 --> 55:59.560]  that guy's radical really we're in this predicament because people think being
[55:59.560 --> 56:03.520]  screwed and robbed and laughed at publicly is not something to get upset

[56:43.480 --> 56:48.320]  totally passive like spectators we have to get out of that mode and get into

[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:02.000]  the main Obamacare architects Jonathan Gruber admitting that quote lack of
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.200]  transparency was key to getting the Affordable Care Act passed because the
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:20.760]  stupidity of the American voter just amazing and I know Paul wrote that
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.920]  article but it is a good job but the way the quote goes I don't think it's
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:28.840]  explanatory says in a newly uncovered video Obamacare architect Jonathan
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.920]  Gruber admits that a lack of transparency was key to getting the
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:38.560]  Affordable Care Act passed because the stupidity of the American voter was key
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:42.680]  or otherwise the bill would have been killed because it said would have
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:48.760]  otherwise been killed you know the stupidity intelligence would have killed
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:53.720]  the bill stupidities what helped it passed so get a call to Paul or have

[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:33.560]  of lying the power of being dishonorable the power of screwing people over for
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:43.120]  the greater good totally and completely massively disgusting on every front and
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:49.720]  basically you know call this stupidity American voter or whatever yeah let's play
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:56.280]  the full clip in context for them here he is the economist working as an
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:00.120]  advisor to Obama talking about keeping it from the public that it was a tax
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:03.120]  keeping it from the public that you would you'd have to pay a lot more
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:06.000]  having Obama go out and go look I'll tell you straight up it'll cut your
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.800]  prices down to the cost of a phone bill or cable bill you'll keep your doctor
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.000]  I'm gonna tell you again don't listen to the lies of these right-wing races
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  hey the bill says it right here shut up racist everybody chill now this is all
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.880]  known and we can't even get it repealed because of the self-propelled zombie
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:32.440]  Mitch McConnell when he talks like move on go deal up I can't say we get rid of
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:36.720]  all of them well we'll get rid of some of it like one of those ventriloquist dolls
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:41.120]  or something yeah like an Obama tentacle up his petudias I don't know what's
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.240]  going on but let's go ahead and go to this clip it's just you can't do it
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.480]  politically you just literally cannot do it okay transparent financing unless
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:53.440]  I transfer anything also transparent spending I mean the this bill was written
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:57.800]  in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes if CBO
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:02.280]  scored the man this taxes the bill dies okay so it's written to do that in terms
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:06.360]  of in terms of risk-rated subsidies you know law which said healthy people are
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:09.840]  gonna pay in it made explicit the health you'll pay in sick people get money it
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:14.520]  would not have passed okay just like the count people transparent lack of
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:18.800]  transparency is a huge political advantage and basically you know call
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:22.680]  the stupidity American voter or whatever but basically that was really
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:27.440]  really critical to get anything to pass I wonder he'd like it if somebody came
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:33.140]  up and and and you know mugged him and he said hey you're robbing me you're
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:37.200]  being deceptive or how would he feel if somebody sold him stocks or bonds that
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:42.120]  were worthless and and conning they'd be like hey I lied to you but it makes me
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:46.040]  trendy and really smart I'm wearing a suit and I'm on TV with a bunch of other
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:50.960]  academics talking about how deceiving people about costs and that's that's
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:55.440]  just the ice for the death panels the taking control of the doctors I mean
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:00.400]  it's just these people are an abomination the government's Department of

[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:33.480]  well I cannot think of a better time to have Phyllis Schlafly on the broadcast
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:39.000]  I've been interviewing her for gotta be 19 years I've been on air 20 she works
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.120]  tirelessly even back at the time when I was only on one FM station here in
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.840]  Austin that she would come on the broadcast a few times a year to promote
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:54.280]  the ideas of Liberty and it was 50 years ago this year that she published her
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:09:00.240]  best-selling book a choice not an echo and that's being republished now we'll
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.680]  give you the tales of that information but Phyllis Schlafly dot com Eagle forum
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:11.120]  dot org you can also find some of her work at WND dot com she's been a
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.440]  national leader of the conservative movement since the publication of her
[01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:19.600]  best-selling book a choice on an echo she's a constitutional lawyer and a lot
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:26.960]  more I'm not going to try to get into everything that she's been involved in
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:30.280]  but and she serves as a member of the Commission the Bicentennial the U.S.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:34.120]  Constitution appointed by President Reagan she has testified before more than
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:38.320]  50 congressional and state legislative committees on constitutional national
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:44.280]  defense and family issues and if you have like Ron Paul you could say as the
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:48.360]  kind of father the libertarian constitutional movement Phyllis Schlafly's
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:55.280]  like the mother of the constitutionalist Liberty movement and we would be in
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:10:00.280]  deep trouble without her if you read the work going back over 55 years almost all
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:03.960]  of it has turned out to be extremely accurate and she's got a syndicated
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:09.040]  column as well the Phyllis Schlafly report that's in over 100 newspapers she's
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:14.920]  got her daily radio commentaries over 600 stations and she's got Eagle forum
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:19.200]  live over 90 stations and also heard of the internet so be sure and go to
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:25.280]  phyllis schlafly.com Eagle forum dot org she understands like Charlton Heston
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:30.480]  did and so many others this is a full-on war and I'll play the clip later for her
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:34.200]  I discussed it a lot in the last hour I play the clip of Ezekiel Emanuel last
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.880]  year admitting they want to wreck healthcare in America basically
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:42.320]  clowered in Piven that's the socialist plan but the new clip of one of the chief
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:48.680]  architects Jonathan Gruber heading up Obama's Economic Commission advising
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:54.200]  on Obamacare saying that they lied to the public with lack of transparency
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:59.960]  being key to fooling stupid Americans and stupid voters and he was there
[01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:07.360]  teaching other academic media how to lie and it's just simply incredible that
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:11.200]  they say they have the moral high ground everything they do wrecks things but
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:15.520]  gives them more power and they admit that they lie and deceive and cheat and
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:21.280]  death panels now Bill Gates admits that I want to say that low-level leftist
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:27.000]  mean well or want to free lunch it varies but at the top these are not
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.480]  leftist these are deranged control freaks more akin to what you saw in the
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:38.000]  French Revolution the only behavior I've seen like this is that is in the
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.400]  French Revolution if you study the degeneracy of the Jacobins and others I
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:45.040]  don't want to go into a history lesson here Phyllis Schlafly joins us thank you
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.160]  so much I know you want to get into 2014 elections what you think that really
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.520]  signified the landscape is it a big political realignment I certainly think
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.920]  so can we defeat the establishment Republicans that will try to play ball
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:03.000]  with it with the same crony capitalist looking forward at 2016 what do you see
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.840]  in your crystal ball we'll discuss it all today and the republishing of your
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:14.160]  book Phyllis but first off we commend your 55 years of work for liberty and we'd
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:20.600]  like to get your take on my little rant discussing the arrogance that we're
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:24.320]  seeing out of the so-called left right now how would you characterize the
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:28.720]  mental state of these people well thank you for all the kind words you said
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:34.280]  Alex it's good to be on with you and and you are right and they deserve a rant
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:39.920]  because they they have really brought this country down the wrong path and the
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:44.880]  majority of Americans admitted were going in the wrong way and I think what
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:52.120]  they really want is power and money our money and they want to make sure that
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:57.160]  the government has control and make the decisions for us when I grew up I guess
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:02.000]  was the years before you grew up but we had a country of middle-class families
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.080]  who had intact nuclear families that is the mother and father were married to
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:14.920]  each other and raising their own children in one household and now that's just the
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:20.960]  minority of people in our country and but the nuclear family was a self-contained
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:25.480]  economic unit they spent their own money made their own decisions decided how
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:29.160]  they were going to raise their children and now we don't have that anymore and
[01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:37.320]  you find the liberals who want to give us government control of everything you
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:41.400]  know this speech that Obama made up in Rhode Island a couple of weeks ago
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:46.760]  which he said we just shouldn't allow women to have the choice choice he used
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:51.840]  the word choice of taking care of their own children or being in the work for
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:55.960]  because we wanted to be in the workforce so they pay more taxes so we can
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:02.040]  provide it with government childcare and raise their children and so first they
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:06.280]  sell the idea that a woman's not worthy if she doesn't have some job paying all
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:09.640]  these taxes and great woman wants a career to be a constitutional lawyer
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:13.080]  change the world like you've done more power to them if a man wants to stay
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:16.360]  home with the kids more power to them or wants to go out and you know work in a
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:21.520]  factory or build a factory I mean that's free will but the demonization of a
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:27.640]  maternal role and then now saying women just shouldn't have the choice they
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:32.240]  they should be made to go out into the system and let the state raise the
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:37.360]  children that's what MSNBC has been saying in promos now for two years every
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:41.800]  week promos they're saying your kids belong to the state they're really
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:47.680]  coming out of the closet aren't they they certainly are and of course when
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.720]  you go in the workforce you're gonna pay taxes and that's gonna give these
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:56.040]  bureaucrats more of your money to spend and tell you how to spend it here's
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:15:01.760]  Melissa Harris Perry in a MSNBC promo saying that we got to get past the idea
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:05.200]  that your kids belong to you so part of it is we have to break through our kind
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.000]  of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities once it's
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.800]  everybody's responsibility and not just the households then we start making
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:21.280]  better investments well that's real straight to the left-wing heresy yes it's
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:26.840]  just absolutely wrong everything we know means children do better when
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:30.280]  they're raised by their own parents in fact you know we poured all this money
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:35.240]  into public schools in an attempt to close the gap those are the magic words
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:39.840]  between the high achieving and the low achieving students and they used to think
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:44.480]  the real cause of the gap was poverty and now reason research shows it's
[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.680]  really not poverty it's whether or not the kids are raised by their own mother
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:53.480]  and father and those who are are gonna do better in school and of course they
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.160]  knew that in the social engineering and that's why they've worked as hard as
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.720]  they can to break up the family they know full well what they're doing it's
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:04.960]  premeditated what do you make of more and more Democrats and leftists coming
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.200]  out and admitting they lie and admitting they deceive and admitting they
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:13.440]  want to wreck the economy so they can be in control I mean for me that is
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:18.440]  criminal fraud to have people involved in Obamacare coming out and saying we
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:23.200]  lied to Congress we lied to the public I mean that's just outrageous but you
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.280]  know this case that the Supreme Court has just taken it's really pretty funny
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:34.840]  it's about Obamacare and what when the Obamacare said that you only got the
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:40.320]  subsidies if your exchange was set up by the state it was a very clear they're
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:46.080]  not equivocal at all and they want to keep people but but most of the state
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:50.640]  didn't sign up for it and so the people want to get the subsidies anyway and
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:55.520]  they're trying to get the Supreme Court to rewrite the legislation now our
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:59.880]  Constitution says all legislative powers in the Congress is very clear there's
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:04.960]  nothing equivocal about it and the Supreme Court is going to take that case
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:08.280]  and the question is are they going to stick to the way it was ripped or are
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:12.600]  they going to rewrite well there's a real power struggle in American
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:16.920]  intelligency and the elites itself for so long the Republican blue bloods have
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:21.000]  worked with the left in this radical transformation now that we see that it's
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.080]  designed to wreck the country and fold us into global government a lot of
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.400]  elites who who aren't completely criminal are now trying to put the brakes
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:33.720]  on things I know you have a lot of high-level context you know inside the
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:39.200]  system do you think that's an accurate statement that there is a serious
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:44.360]  relooking at things inside of the establishment and that a lot of people
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:48.360]  are realizing that we better turn back now well I don't see much evidence that
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:52.000]  it's the establishment the big boys the Chamber of Commerce types who are
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.880]  rethinking it because they like it when they bring it when we bring in cheap
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:05.000]  labor so they can raise their stock price but value couldn't go up but I think
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.240]  the American people are catching on that most of the people who are coming in
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:14.960]  are willing to work for lower wages and they were asking me to comment on these
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:21.680]  states that passed the minimum wage law in the other day but if it's not the
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:27.400]  actual amount of the wage that is attracting them the ones that these
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:31.280]  people come in they're working are willing to work for much lower than the
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.920]  minimum wage and they genuinely also get welfare on the side as a supplement
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:41.200]  yes they certainly do that's right and so I think the American people are
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:47.400]  waking up and the big question now is are we gonna let Obama get by with his
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:52.760]  executive amnesty which is he wants to bring more cheap labor and of course
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:57.560]  he's bringing in all these diseases we've got the children dying with this
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:02.760]  new kind of a TB disease that's being brought in by these unaccompanied
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:08.600]  minors who are coming in and trying to go into our school and our children are
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:12.600]  being sacrificed regardless of what color on the altar of globalism that's
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.760]  why they couldn't control the borders or planes with Ebola because they don't
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:19.120]  want ever send the message that having a border might be something you might
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:22.520]  want to have fellow Schlafly stay there we're gonna come back and I want to get
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:29.320]  into 2014 how big of a wake-up was it 2016 Obama's executive power grab will
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:32.800]  the Republican establishment try to block it but I want to agree with you
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:38.520]  it's the grassroots that's waking up not even so much the elite but I am seeing
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:43.040]  a lot of signs that there are a lot of people in the establishment that do see
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:47.320]  now that we're coming to the end of the road and that globalism is not really a
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:52.600]  good idea and so they may want to change sides basically right here at the end
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:57.520]  so they don't get the blame we'll be right back stay with us

[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:16.120]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen. Phyllis Lively is our guest today for the
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:19.640]  rest of the hour. I am your host Alex Jones. If you just joined us this is a
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:23.920]  short segment long segment coming up. So I want to just give her the floor right
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:28.120]  now to get into her view on 2014 election. What does it really mean? What
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:34.680]  does she see looking forward into 2016? What are the big issues? Phyllis? Well the
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:40.360]  big issue in the 2014 election was the Republicans getting control of the Senate
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:46.920]  so they can stop Obama from putting any other judge on the Supreme Court. If he
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:51.280]  put one more justice on the Supreme Court I think he would rule this country
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:55.320]  for the next 30 years. And I believe that the Republicans should make a
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:00.280]  decision that they are not going to confirm any more judges appointed by
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:06.280]  Obama because he's already done quite an effective job of packing the federal
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:12.000]  court system with left-wing judges. Sure shouldn't they block his the people he
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.560]  wants for the Attorney General? Absolutely. Absolutely. If they have they
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:23.160]  all have some spy down. People spoke and they should carry out the wish of this
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:29.000]  people. Obama said his policies were all on the ballot and okay we'll accept
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.760]  that. They were as the people rejected them. That's right the Democrats and
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.600]  Obama said this was basically a referendum. It was a major political
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:45.000]  realignment. I mean the Democrats haven't been this week since 1920. I mean this
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.040]  really is a sign that they're in trouble. It certainly is and so it's a good
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:55.800]  omen for two years from now and I hope that the Republicans can stay on the
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:01.480]  ball and be a fighter. Let's not have any this talk about bipartisanship and
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:05.960]  trying to make a deal with them. Use our majority and restore some
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:13.000]  constitutional rules. The idea of letting Obama make new laws with the
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.520]  executive amnesty and executive action is just unacceptable in a free country.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:24.840]  What's gonna happen if Boehner and McConnell ride herd on the good
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:30.160]  Republicans. A lot of good ones in there and they don't repeal Obamacare or they
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:34.000]  let Obama sign a bunch of executive orders. What's the word you're getting?
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.840]  Are they planning to slap him down because Obama seems belligerent. He says
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:44.960]  he's going forward. Yes he is and he he seems to think that he's some kind of a
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:49.360]  some kind of a king. You can do whatever he wants and they shouldn't let him get
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:54.760]  by with it. Of course Congress has control of the money and when he said
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:27:00.360]  he won't close he won't close our borders to people with the Ebola. He wants
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:07.800]  six billion dollars so he can set up a plan to stop Ebola in West Africa. Now
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:12.400]  we didn't elect him for that and Congress who holds the purse strings they
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:20.240]  should they shouldn't give them the money. Wow. You know it doesn't it
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:24.560]  doesn't make sense and now one of the big issues that the Republicans are
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:31.840]  playing coy about is this new giving Obama fast track. Now that's giving him
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:37.160]  power that they never gave to Clinton or Bush or any of the previous presidents
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:42.000]  which means they can go make a trade agreement in secret without consulting
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.400]  anybody with bypassing Congress and just make it and it becomes a treaty with
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:52.640]  all the advantages and constitutional protection of a treaty. And of course
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.880]  that's that Pacific trade partnership that's got 30 parts only one part's been
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:01.120]  leaked and it gives control of the Internet over to the UN basically. This
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:05.840]  is this is dictatorship by shadowy boards and yeah the Republicans are
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.360]  talking about handing that to him when he's just been given a mandate to do
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:14.080]  nothing. Well we shouldn't let him do it we should pick up a fuss and I'm sorry
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:19.680]  we've got to well now listen Alex you know that the big fight is within the
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:24.360]  Republican Party. Oh yes. It's between the establishment the people who like to
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:29.160]  think they're the kingmakers of our land and the grassroots and that's why
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:33.400]  people need to read my new book a choice not an echo because that tells you
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:37.320]  about all the shady deals and shenanigans that they pulled in the past to
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:41.880]  give us this series of losers. We used to call them me too candidates whatever
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:46.000]  the Democrats said the Republican candidate would say me too. That's right
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.680]  and it's an updated and expanded 50th anniversary issue. It brings it up to
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:55.640]  date. Tell us about the book before we got a break. Well the original book I
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:59.880]  published in 1964 and of course I couldn't get any publishers so I did it
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:05.800]  myself and sold three million copies out of my garage and that is what
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:10.320]  created the conservative movement because it told people that we had a real
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:15.840]  conservative support Barry Goldwater and we could do it and we did nominate him
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:22.600]  in the convention despite everything and then of course the big boys smashed
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:27.400]  him in the general election but we got our reward a few years later when we
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:31.960]  elected Ronald Reagan and if we hadn't created the conservative movement with
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:36.780]  the choice not an echo in 1964 we wouldn't have gotten Ronald Reagan as a
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:42.200]  greatest president of the 20th century in 1980. Tell us stay there this is so
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:46.360]  important folks what one lady did with a book changing history you could change
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:52.920]  history too stay with us. We're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones

[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:31.920]  it was Mary Goldwater who almost became president but they ran TV ads saying
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:36.480]  there'd be nuclear war we'd all die if he got elected the trilateralist
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:40.680]  commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for the
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:44.240]  multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interest by
[01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:48.300]  seizing control the political government of the United States the
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:52.840]  trilateralist commission represents a skillful coordinated effort to seize
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:56.680]  control and consolidate the four centers of power political monetary
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:00.840]  intellectual and ecclesiastical they've got most of the churches they've got
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:04.040]  things by the Federal Reserve they've got the Democratic Party and most of
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:08.800]  the Republicans they've taken control the universities that's from his book
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:14.160]  from US senator from Arizona Barry Goldwater with no apologies and I know
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:17.160]  folks that knew Barry Goldwater just of course Phyllis Schlafly knew him well
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:20.640]  what a great guy how wonderful it would have been to have him as president
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:24.840]  Reagan had great rhetoric about how you know you did build your business and
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:28.640]  freedoms great and everything else politics got away from him in the
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:32.880]  Congress and some bad things happened some things I disagree with under Reagan
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:37.080]  and Ron Paul criticized those as well but compare Ronald Reagan to Obama who
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.800]  says you didn't build your business and Hillary came out and said businesses
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:44.720]  don't hire people there's a war against reality we're gonna talk to her and

[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:59.560]  course of the Eagle Forum Phyllis talk about some of the history talk about
[01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:03.680]  Barry Goldwater talk about the new edition of your book and why it's so
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:10.160]  important for people to get it well when I brought on a choice not of echo it
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:15.800]  had this enormous fail and what it did was to inspire people to believe that
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:20.120]  the grassroots could win against the establishment and nominate a real
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:25.240]  conservative now let me remind you that in that time period
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:30.040]  presidents were supposed to come from New York, Pennsylvania, or Ohio and Barry
[01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:35.760]  Goldwater was of Arizona I didn't know anybody who had ever been to Arizona
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:41.280]  there was no baseball team that was farther west or south than St. Louis it
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:45.600]  was so far away and so distant and yet we picked him and we made speeches from
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:51.560]  it all over the country for him and we it did get it nominated of course they
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:56.160]  clobbered him in the election but we stayed together as the grassroots
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:01.720]  conservative and then came Ronald Reagan and we got him elected and he had two
[01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:06.040]  wonderful presidencies and not perfect but certainly better than anything that
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:10.920]  Democrats had to offer and then they kind of disintegrated after that then we
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:15.640]  had people who pretended to be conservatives they really weren't and we've
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:21.520]  got to revive them and that's why I come out with my 50th anniversary edition
[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:25.680]  of a choice not an echo now it's not a rewrite of the original the original is
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:31.160]  in there just as I wrote it in 64 but what I do is to bring it up to date with
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:36.800]  the shenanigans and the behind the closed-door deals that were made in all
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:43.400]  the Republican National Convention after 1964 brings it right up to date and I'm
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:47.880]  telling listeners you can't be a player in the presidential election next year
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:52.280]  unless you know the history unless you know what's in the past because we want
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:57.920]  to pick somebody who's picked by the grassroots we we we don't want somebody
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:04.600]  who wants to bring in all this cheap labor and export our good job the broad
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:10.720]  the cheap labor country and so it's a big challenge but you need to know the
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:15.320]  history in order to get going in the battle I agree Phyllis the founder of
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:19.240]  the Eagle form Phyllis Lathley's our guest I want to bring up some inside
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:24.640]  baseball stories here I've been told by high-level folks that at the nomination
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:31.040]  process in 19 for the 1980 election and I've seen the speeches and seen video
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:35.600]  clips where Ronald Reagan was criticizing George Herbert Walker Bush and
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:39.920]  saying he's a trilateralist he's a globalist basically going with a very
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:44.760]  goldwater line of reality and then he was taken behind closed doors and said
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:49.160]  we're not gonna back to you if you don't put Bush in here who was a Rockefeller
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:55.080]  East Coast Republican and then you have the Clinton dynasty and the Bush is
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:58.640]  working together I was always told at the time that Bush had basically fallen
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:02.080]  down on the election so Clinton could get in now they call him another son
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:06.600]  that's basically been admitted now we're back to more Clinton and Bush
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:12.600]  dynasties let me say Alex the the story of what they tried to do to Reagan when
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:17.280]  they realized he was going to be nominated is told that my new book a
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:23.600]  choice not an echo and it's quite behind the scenes story what they tried to do
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:30.480]  was to make Gerald Ford co-president and when Dan rather accosted me on the
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:33.600]  floor of the convention he said what do you think about this business lastly and
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:36.880]  I said well it's completely unconstitutional you want to give the
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:43.160]  vice president control of the budget the money there are sovereignty issues our
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:48.720]  tax issues and leave a president Reagan with nothing but the Bureau of Indian
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:52.640]  Affairs let's stop right there this is such a big deal you're confirming when I
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:56.600]  was told when I was you know a kid and then what I've talked to high-level
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:59.960]  Republicans that were there you were there on record on national television
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:04.160]  you were behind the scenes the establishment was so afraid of Reagan
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:11.160]  that they were trying to get him to agree to to to be a titular head and try to
[01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:16.040]  change the Constitution illegally inside the party break down exactly what
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:20.360]  happened it's sensational well tell the story of my new addition of a choice
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:24.360]  not an echo but they want to give all the real power to the vice president who
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:28.960]  would be Gerald Ford and the reason they wanted Gerald Ford was that a man he was
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:33.880]  the man who took his orders from Henry Kissinger and and they thought that that
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:38.840]  would enable them to run the country even when even if Reagan were elected
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:45.920]  president and that is why Reagan was pounded so heavily by them that he
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:52.040]  called George Bush at 1125 that night and I was there in the convention hall
[01:42:52.040 --> 01:42:57.440]  and 1125 and said get on over here Bush was already in his pajamas he had given
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:01.480]  up any hope of being on the ticket and Reagan brought him over and introduced
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:06.080]  Bush because he was afraid he couldn't get through the night you know Walter
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:11.640]  Cronkite from the skybox had already announced that that Gerald Ford was
[01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:18.000]  going to be the co-president and had the real power so the elites were just
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  struggling to get their people in and so George Herbert Walker Bush was seen as
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:29.880]  a better person for him to choose than Gerald Ford oh yeah Bush sure but the
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:34.480]  first George Bush was the was the choice of the establishment no question
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:40.080]  about that and the grassroots for for Ronald Reagan and then we had enough
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:46.980]  delegates to nominate Reagan but they the establishment of the so-called
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:52.120]  king makers hooked up this deal by which they could thought they could take the
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:57.640]  power away from the president and give it to a vice president they could control
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:03.360]  it's amazing though so we learned that Ronald Reagan really was anti-New World
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:10.560]  Order anti-globalist sure and but then he gets shot and then he goes in for
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:14.360]  treatment and comes back out and I know you were in both administrations what
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:19.200]  can you say about what happened inside of those administration well Reagan
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:23.560]  wasn't perfect but he certainly was better than anybody else in sight and he
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:29.680]  was the choice of the grassroots and he did not turn over all his power to to
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:35.680]  Ford or anybody else and yes he made he made a number of mistakes that we could
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:41.680]  discuss but however on on balance he was the best president we had you're
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:46.360]  saying bottom line he was a good guy that loved this country he did he did
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:50.920]  that's a big difference from Obama who obviously wants to destroy it well he
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:54.080]  obviously doesn't love this country he doesn't want to think we're better than
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:58.280]  anybody else and and of course we are that's why everybody in the world wants
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:03.480]  to come here well our ideals were better and we certainly were exceptional now
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:07.640]  we're an exceptional paradox of just horrible socialist and crony capitalist
[01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:11.400]  and then all the other free market folks making this country go why do you think
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:16.000]  the Democrats are so arrogant now and admit they're lying and and admit they
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.680]  want to wreck the economy and saying you didn't build your business I mean
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:25.520]  that's a way to discredit themselves are they that disconnected well they they
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:31.440]  have a lot of rich people and they've always had more money than grassroots
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:37.160]  movement oh yeah and I think they were doing a bit of
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:43.200]  gloating but they they simply want to continue to control things they always
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:47.740]  have and I'm telling the people listening to this program we beat them in
[01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:53.480]  1964 when we nominated go water and we beat them in 1980 and 84 when we
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:58.040]  nominated Ronald Reagan and we can do it again if you'll get with it read my
[01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:01.920]  book so you know the shenanigans they pulled before and we won't let them get
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:06.240]  by with giving us another loser for president this time well they I've
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:09.560]  never seen the establishment this scared and I've gone back to the history
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:13.800]  and I want to see if you concur with that they are really scared of the tea
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:17.480]  party insurrection taken over the Republicans they are absolutely
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:21.840]  lining up against it but I'm seeing a lot of good signs a major talk show
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:26.600]  host realizing that and now saying that and and what do you expect them to pull
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:32.600]  now to try to get a Chris Christie or a Jeb Bush over a Rand Paul or a Ted Cruz
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:38.600]  what do you expect them to pull a and then be as probably the top expert on
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:41.600]  the inside stuff that goes on you know seeing it for 50 years fellow Schlafly
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:46.320]  joins us head of the Eagle Forum who would you like to see as president well
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:50.360]  I'm not picking my guy at the present time but but I can tell you it's pretty
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:55.800]  clear that their number one guy is Jeb Bush yeah you know they they believe
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:47:00.720]  that the British system of primogeniture they want to take the next one in line
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:04.480]  and it's just the next one in line there's been one loser after another I
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:08.080]  don't believe the American people are willing to elect another Bush yeah we
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:16.600]  rejected royalty in 1776 and so but the grassroots can do it they'll get on out
[01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:22.440]  joint and and realize that the fight is in the Republican Party that's where the
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:27.280]  important fight is now we lost several good candidates including my own
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:33.400]  candidate for state rep by the libertarian votes that took more than his
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:41.960]  margin by which he lost and maybe maybe you wish we had many parties like other
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:46.560]  countries do I don't wish that but some people may yeah but we have a two-part
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:51.800]  system and I clearly said that you go to war with the army you have doubt the
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:56.920]  army you wish you had well I agree I vote libertarian when both candidates are
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:01.040]  bad but I said in this election if there's a tea party patriot running
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:04.720]  against a Democrat and even if they're not perfect you got a vote for them
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:09.280]  because this is a referendum on tyranny we have to bring them down we have to
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:14.520]  bloody their nose we have to make them pay we've got to take over a pretty good
[01:48:14.520 --> 01:48:19.000]  job yeah we did a pretty good job I was really proud of we didn't get everybody
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.960]  but we got an awful lot and a lot more than they expect us to get well fellas
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.640]  it's just amazing I want to have you back on again soon just to talk about the
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:33.480]  book for a full hour I want to go to a few few phone calls because I've got so
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:39.440]  many good inside stories and and it's up to the it's up today and you've got to
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:45.960]  have the ammo if you're gonna go to battle wow it's and the ammo is a choice
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:50.640]  not an echo new 50th anniversary edition well I want to talk to the publisher
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:54.120]  maybe carry it at the info or store as well I can't wait to read it I mean I
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:57.240]  read the original book but I haven't that was like 15 years ago I want to read
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:49:02.080]  this updated expanded version fellas flatly is our guest I want to go to a
[01:49:02.080 --> 01:49:06.000]  few phone calls here when we come back from break but maybe we'll skip this
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:10.280]  network break for time but fellas anything else you'd like to add to the
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:14.240]  viewers and listeners out there well what's in the book is the inside story
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:19.440]  like that 1980 behind-the-scenes story of what they tried to do was Reagan it's
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:24.400]  just simply incredible and it shows you how these people operate and they've got
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:30.480]  the power and the clout and they they do a lot but I think people are waking up
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:34.680]  to that you know at the present time what they're trying to do is to give
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:39.800]  Obama more power than the previous president ever had they want to give
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:44.960]  him fast track so he could make any deal with foreign countries and and not
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:49.360]  even let Congress know make a deal and make it into the law it's called fast
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:55.320]  track why would we give him any more power I suppose by mine that's right
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:59.400]  and in fact I've seen some Rand Paul statements that were he's like we need
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:02.760]  to get trade done and he needs to clarify that because that's what the
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:06.320]  other Republicans are saying it means give him the power he's been given a
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:12.960]  mandate to be indicted to be impeached not a mandate to expand power the
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:17.720]  mandate is repeal Obamacare fellow slapley what's gonna happen if the
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:21.520]  neocons and rhinos are able to suppress the liberty movement in the
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:25.920]  Republican Party and if they don't repeal Obamacare if they don't shut the
[01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:29.640]  president down if they let him shut down more power plants if they let him have
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:34.560]  executive amnesty I mean if they do that what's gonna happen well I'm making
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:40.960]  up my mind that's not gonna happen and we've got to educate the grassroots and
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:45.480]  tell them if they have the power if they will only use that that's what we're up
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:49.520]  against today because a lot of people you realize that not many people could
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:57.720]  remember 1964 now and we we need to tell them that the grass we are a country of
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:02.520]  way the people I'll say this about Barry Goldwater I mean nobody was talking
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:06.600]  about New World Order and trilateral commissions and you know just all this
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:10.200]  stuff back when he was he was doing it when it was like speaking Martian
[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:13.680]  because he really cared and was warning people he was being the opposite of a
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:17.960]  politician he was being a statesman and studying the two though Reagan was
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:22.320]  probably more well-spoken and maybe better looking Barry Goldwater would have
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:28.280]  been an incredible president yes he was an authentic conservative and that's
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:32.160]  what we want somebody who really cares about this country and believes our
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:36.200]  country should be the best and the biggest one of the things that I have
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:40.680]  been responsible for repeatedly putting in the Republican policy platform
[01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:46.920]  adopted at the Republican convention is that we need military superiority it's
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:51.960]  not enough to be just strong we've got to be the biggest and the best and that's
[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:57.560]  the best key to peace for ourselves and for everybody else well it would be if
[01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:01.600]  we didn't have neocons in Obama launching all these wars that's why
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:05.400]  people want to cut the military my concern is they're trying to twist the
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:09.240]  military into a domestic force with all those memos to go after the Tea Party
[01:52:09.240 --> 01:52:13.720]  do you find that chilling yes and I also find it chilling that they're putting
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:18.120]  women in combat I don't have any respect for the military has been women in
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:22.520]  the combat it's kind of like if you hear noise in your house in the middle of
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:27.120]  the night and husband turns over to honey you go on downstairs and see what's
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:32.720]  that going on well it's a war on reality I mean men can't make babies and men are
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:37.360]  ugly and women look good I mean I mean I mean there are differences protect their
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:43.200]  family exactly it's men's jobs I mean men men men at least the men I know want to
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:49.240]  protect their family sure they do that that's why recent recent figures show
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:55.080]  that men who have children earn more money than men who don't well that's
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:53:00.560]  just because they work harder they've got a motive well the minute my wife had
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:05.280]  our first child my son all the thing just clicked everything in me I suddenly
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:09.720]  wanted to be more successful wanted to work harder got grew up a lot and it's
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:16.360]  biological yes and we need to encourage that of course you're fighting the
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:20.160]  feminist but you need to read my other book who killed the American family and
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:23.960]  you'll see the damage that the feminist did I have read that book if I want to
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:26.720]  have you back on in a few weeks if you'll do it just on that book as well
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:32.600]  Phyllis Schlafly's our guest Randy in Texas Randy you're on the air go ahead
[01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:40.160]  thank you Alex Phyllis you are God sent I went to a program the other evening
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:46.120]  where John Danforth was the speaker I know you know John yeah probably very
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:49.880]  well yeah I'd like you to speak about him a little bit but let me just tell
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:55.280]  you one thing that he said it was very disturbing to me he told me point blank
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:54:05.920]  that his wife campaigned and raised funds for Mark Pryor in Arkansas if that is
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:11.800]  going on Republican to Democrat something is grossly wrong in this
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:15.960]  country and I'd like you to address what you believe that mr. Danforth's
[01:54:15.960 --> 01:54:21.000]  position really is on the Republican Party and conservatism in general well
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:25.560]  it's not surprising because we in Missouri I live in Missouri consider him
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:30.400]  part of the establishment crowd and this fight we've been talking about in the
[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:35.040]  National Republican Party but in the establishment of the grassroots goes on
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:39.640]  in a different state and in Missouri Danforth is definitely in the
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:44.920]  establishment crowd now I'm happy to tell you that in the last election for
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:49.880]  Missouri State Chairman we we elected a grass-rooter we elected a real
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:52.880]  conservative and you know it's kind of funny
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:59.120]  Missouri has a pretty pretty slick system for electing the state chairman it's
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:03.760]  kind of like the way they elect the Pope they had a secret ballot and somebody
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:09.000]  counts the ballot and Ed Martin won by about three or four votes and that they
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:13.040]  immediately take the ballot out and burn them that's the way the pope they do for
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:16.080]  the pope you know the vote goes up and then the people know there's been a new
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:22.240]  pope well anyway we got a conservative a non-establishment guy and you can do
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:27.280]  that in your state and get your grass-rooters elected as delegates to
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:30.720]  the Republican National Convention very exciting we're almost out of time thank
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:34.160]  you so much Randy I'll see if those can do five more and overdrive Paul Watson's
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:36.960]  coming on overdrive into the next hour I got Paul Watson coming on with huge
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:41.440]  breaking news I'm trying to get as many as these calls as possible I think the
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:45.640]  Democrats have jumped the shark in that they just openly say where criminals
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:51.880]  were liars haha I believe they've gone insane like Nero and we've got a real
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:55.400]  chance to beat them now folks they've they've had so much power that they've
[01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:58.840]  acted like lunatics and the Republicans that have worked with them are going to
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:03.240]  be exposed if we take this initiative I believe we can take the country back
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:08.360]  Phyllis what do you say to that yes I do I absolutely do believe and not only
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:17.120]  that we must our future depends on let's go ahead let's go to Patrick in Texas
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:22.560]  Patrick you're on the air go ahead hey Alex I was a pleasure listening to you
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:29.800]  hi Phyllis I I was a fan of Reagan when I found out that he tried to get rid of
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:34.260]  the those are I think that's why they tried to murder him you know and the
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:40.760]  IRS yep yeah and the IRS and also as far as you know business is creating jobs
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:45.680]  the one thing that I think about is the public you know they're the man for a
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:49.840]  product and then the banks allowing the public to get money in order to make
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:53.200]  these products and actually start entrepreneurial shit and that doesn't
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:57.000]  happen and you know that's the biggest enemy we have are the banks and you know
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.760]  well the central banks that are waging war on the regular banks I agree with you
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:05.320]  Phyllis who is the biggest enemy in corporate America that I mean you
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:08.760]  mentioned Chamber of Commerce all these groups the unions vote for open
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:12.400]  borders they vote for NAFTA and get I mean it's just all these special
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:16.920]  interests are controlled by who well I don't know they're all controlled by
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:22.320]  anybody but we certainly they all these groups are pushing for open borders and
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:26.280]  we shouldn't let them get by with it because the majority of people don't
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:31.400]  want that and what what they just want to the cheap labor that's what it's for
[01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:36.500]  and we should reform the laws that are encouraging business and their good
[01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:43.160]  jobs overseas it's just awful free trade is such a such a deceit that because
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:46.760]  they write it one-sided I've got a little five minutes segment here coming up
[01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:49.840]  in about a minute at the break can you do it if you can I've got one more
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:54.000]  question no no I I have to go have another I understand I know you're
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.480]  you're a hard worker well then here's my question we'll have to take calls on
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:00.960]  their time can't feminists now see that what they were sold as feminism doesn't
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:05.040]  empower women and is actually really screwed up women's position and in
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:08.280]  everybody's position I mean isn't feminism in trouble
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:12.600]  feminism is in big trouble but we can discuss that the next time I come on your
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:18.440]  show all right well thank you so much for joining us Phyllis Lathley okay bye

[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:50.040]  babies only vaccinated to trained parents vaccine proponent acknowledges shots
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:54.520]  in first year of life for infants are pointless well yeah hepatitis shot
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:58.280]  unless you're an intervening a drug user or having unprotected sex is
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:01:08.640]  pointless pointless meaning no point and then it ends up hurting the child and so
[02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:15.320]  he's gone public with that we have the clip we're going to be getting to it when
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:21.680]  we come back in the next segment with Paul Joseph Watson right now sorry you
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:25.040]  guys didn't get to talk to Phyllis Slathley I ran out of time but Weston
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:36.320]  Idaho you had a point go ahead yeah yeah Alex yeah I keep hearing Phyllis say
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:44.760]  that vaccinations made in China are bad however vaccinations made in the USA are
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:51.400]  good I wanted to confront her on this I've emailed her a number of times
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:59.400]  another thing is Reagan actually signed a bill a vaccination injury act that
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:04.760]  basically made the pharmaceutical companies immune to lawsuits no I know
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:07.440]  the way they sold it to Reagan and I'm not defending him I said he had a lot
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:11.320]  of problems was that this will pay families and by then when he was shot
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:16.600]  he came out senile they gave him quote cold blood that will brain damage you
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:20.600]  and then reportedly they were drugging him and then getting him on speed to
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:26.080]  hype him back up to roll him out major psyops were going on with Reagan that's
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:29.160]  what I tried to keep him from being president the bottom line was he was
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:32.840]  speaking out against the New World Order trilateral Commission everything when
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:36.560]  he was running and then he did a lot of good stuff had a commission to get rid
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:39.920]  of the IRS then he gets shot and the whole another thing happens he was an
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:45.200]  old guy but that's all ancient history the point is Phyllis Slathley's been
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:48.400]  defending the Second Amendment sovereignty you name it work with
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:54.360]  Barry Goldwater that's why we had Iran but I wasn't aware of Phyllis's position
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:03:00.160]  on vaccines we know pharmaceuticals from China are even worse and tainted across
[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:04.280]  the board but so are a lot of the vaccines made here and other places they
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:10.160]  said the best they say the best drugs come out of Austria or Germany most the
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:15.840]  elite by the most expensive pharmaceuticals come out of Austria and I
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:20.000]  know folks that have taken one prescription from China and got sick and
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.240]  their doctor said well I'm gonna give you something that costs three times more
[02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:27.280]  it's from Austria and it was a medical drug and it really helped him so I think
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:32.920]  there is something to that overall but yeah anything else no you hung up okay
[02:03:32.920 --> 02:03:38.400]  James and Michigan you want to talk about 60s activism go ahead yes I wanted
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:44.520]  to ask Phyllis if she was familiar with and perhaps work alongside of Byron C
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:50.520]  Fagan perhaps you know well of him I just started learning of him and very
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:55.240]  intriguing fellow and unfortunately I don't believe he's still alive to have
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:04:01.000]  him on your show but yeah there was Ezra Pound Fagan I never interviewed Fagan
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  I think he was gone or dead before I was even on air I think he's been gone a
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:09.680]  long time that was the Illuminati record that sold millions of copies made by
[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:17.920]  Anthony Hilder Anthony Hilder put that underground mega head out in the late
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:25.400]  60s out in Los Angeles so yeah you could find that record online on YouTube and
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:30.560]  I mean the voice of him is just hard to not listen to the plan was nothing
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:35.720]  short of amazing the Illuminati I'd have to hear his voice to try to get it right
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:40.840]  but it's like you listen to it it's like working with Adam Weishaupt at
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:47.680]  Ingolstadt University in 1775 the plot was hatched and launched but yes I'm
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:52.560]  familiar with him all right more calls coming up Lawrence on foster children

[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:37.640]  have time to do it today but it's a great review and I agree with it we're
[02:09:37.640 --> 02:09:42.680]  going to be getting into law let's IRS sees accounts on suspicion not crime
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:46.280]  that's an article from last week it dovetails with police use department
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:51.720]  wish list when deciding which assets to seize with no proof of crime so just
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:56.720]  amazing criminality they're trying to imprint on police departments because
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:10:00.480]  I've done a study of it most departments do not engage in criminal
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:03.840]  asset forfeiture seizure even if they claim they can interpret a lot of do
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:08.480]  it they don't take your car because they claim they found cocaine residue on
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:13.640]  your money because everybody knows it's on all money unless it's brand new or
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:17.040]  they don't take your bar or restaurant because somebody sold drugs in the
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:21.880]  bathroom if it isn't you but more and more departments are doing it as a
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:26.360]  minority they're being federally trained to do it it's very dangerous so we're
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:30.240]  going to break that down out of the New York Times we're going to get into
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:34.960]  federal judges public has right to know about FBI's facial recognition database
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:39.480]  Winston Churchill wanting to nuke Russia Rush Limbaugh threatens to sue
[02:10:39.480 --> 02:10:43.080]  Democratic congressional committee the big stories I want to get Paul Watts's
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:48.240]  take on this every cover says his latest story Obama says FCC should
[02:10:48.240 --> 02:10:53.480]  reclassify Internet as utility Ted Cruz has been in the committee hearings says
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:58.520]  what I've said it is the Obamacare version of communications Obamacare for
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:03.120]  the Internet it's they call it one thing it's another and that integrates in
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:08.840]  with Obamacare architect lack of transparency lying was key on fooling
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:15.640]  quote stupid Americans I mean these people are sick in fact let's get to
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:18.720]  that first Paul because you wrote that article to this morning how do these
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:22.560]  people go on C spam with a bunch of academics and Obama people and laugh
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:27.080]  about lying and laugh about increasing prices and lying about it and laugh
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:34.040]  about charging healthy people and of course death panels all of it why if
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:40.560]  they're engaged in what is clearly in my view criminal activity fraud why tell
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:44.840]  people they did it later I mean I've studied criminology and I just never
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:51.480]  get why criminals or just sociopaths scum control freaks nutbags whatever you
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:56.840]  want to call them gravitate towards power and then they start dancing around
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:12:02.080]  hopping around bragging how they're screwing everyone why do that why do
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:05.800]  they flap their mouths I guess cuz they enjoy terrorizing those of us that are
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:10.960]  awake what do you think's going on here Paul in the case of Gruber I think
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:15.000]  it's partly you know he's a technocrat and he likes to think that he's smarter
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:19.720]  than 300 and odd million American people so they're just too dumb even
[02:12:19.720 --> 02:12:25.720]  understanding talking yeah I mean it's amazing when you watch that clip just
[02:12:25.720 --> 02:12:30.520]  the hubris and the arrogance of it yeah I'll be honest I want to slap them
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:35.600]  upside the head the whole time I look at him yeah I mean you know he's a
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:40.520]  bureaucrat he helped write Obamacare back in 2009 but you know Obama said if
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:44.320]  you like your doctor you can keep your doctor that was another broken promise
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:48.840]  every single promise with Obamacare wasn't a promise it was already in the
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:54.280]  bill premeditated fraud saying they're liars there's no death panels it doesn't
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:58.360]  increase prices there's no hidden taxes don't listen to the racist Matt drudge
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:04.000]  wrestling ball Alex Jones mean by name we are racist lying scum no we read the
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:09.840]  bill Paul I'm sorry I'm getting mad I am sick of these people it definitely
[02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:13.960]  makes you a little bit more angry when they get up afterwards and brazenly
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:18.520]  admit to the fact that they deceived everybody from the beginning is it that
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:23.680]  premeditation in some cases yeah but in others they just like to think that
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:27.080]  they're smarter than everyone else and that Obamacare is gonna be great and
[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:29.920]  it's gonna save America and they think they were right from the start so they're
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:34.920]  not gonna backtrack on that okay I'm gonna settle down what do you make of
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:40.200]  saving the internet Obama wants to take it over with the FCC I told folks that
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:45.000]  was coming here it is well I mean you've got to remember that going back
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:49.840]  years the Obama kill switch has been in the works for a very long time and they
[02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:53.680]  actually justified it at the time through Lieberman and everyone else by
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:59.520]  pointing to China as the example numerous times China has tried to register
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:03.320]  bloggers using their real name so they can be identified and targeted by the
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:08.920]  government right Lindsey Graham McCain Lieberman when he was in and
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:14.600]  Democrats have all Feinstein have all pointed at China and said see they did
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:20.080]  it yeah now killed 84 million people does that mean it's okay for you to exactly
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:25.920]  and the reason China did it was to censor and strangle free speech at times
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:30.320]  of intense political uprising so when the Tibetans was we're rising up for
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:33.920]  example a few years ago that's when they shut off the internet in all these
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:39.080]  different areas so they use it to stifle dissent and then Lieberman gets on air
[02:14:39.080 --> 02:14:43.120]  and says we need this power because China uses it so why shouldn't we have it
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:47.640]  they use it to stifle freedom and for censorship because it is a communist police
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:53.640]  state China has mobile execution vans and as a hellhole you visited it yeah on
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:58.480]  many occasions the key with this latest thing is though that everybody thinks
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:03.120]  that Obama is you know winging his way in to save the internet to impose net
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:06.520]  neutrality but again I mean look at their history of how they treat the
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:10.200]  internet you know so per pipper all these are the bills that were introduced
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:14.880]  through Congress they're not advocates for a free and open internet so to give
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:18.200]  them that level of power and control is ridiculous yeah let's just make the
[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:22.160]  announcement world governments governments worldwide are moving to
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:26.520]  censor the web Australia calls it Chinese style net censorship the
[02:15:26.520 --> 02:15:30.800]  government called it that they are moving to shut us down because they can't
[02:15:30.800 --> 02:15:35.520]  beat us in the intellectual arena of ideas do you understand folks that's
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:39.000]  why you get presidential alerts on your phone now that's why they take over TV
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:44.800]  stations now they're getting you ready for it Paul yeah and the danger of the
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:49.720]  corporations creating fast lanes and slow lanes is far less than the danger of
[02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:54.240]  the government having control over the entire worldwide web which is what they
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:58.640]  want they've admitted up to it on several occasions and you know the basic
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:01.960]  facts of competition dictates that service will improve across the board
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:05.720]  that's not going to happen so I mean a lot of liberals are getting behind this
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:09.720]  though they've jumped right on board with Obama's comments today he's gonna
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:13.200]  protect your health care by screwing you over and now he's going to protect the
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:17.280]  internet with the same thing which big corporations are behind in many cases
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:20.280]  because it's all gonna be selective incredible Paul let's shift gears to
[02:16:20.280 --> 02:16:26.760]  your newest article on info wars calm very interesting information let's get
[02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:32.880]  into what this scientist is saying immunologists that's a medical doctor
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:37.960]  who specializes in vaccines and immune systems what they admitted but didn't
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:43.360]  let their name released in the video yes basically a PhD immunologist the
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:48.000]  vaccine advocate who gets gets up before a panel of health professionals at this
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:52.880]  medical conference and admits to the fact that vaccines for babies in the
[02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:58.600]  first year which American babies in America receive at least 26 vaccines
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:03.000]  recommended unless you go jump through you know flaming hoops and opt out of it
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.600]  26 vaccines in the first year so this immunologist gets up and basically
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:11.640]  admits that because a baby's immune system isn't even developed by then they
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:15.760]  get the immunity through the breast milk mainly these vaccines are completely
[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:20.320]  pointless worthless for the first year they have no effect and that what it's
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:26.480]  really about is training the parents to bring their babies to pediatric wellness
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:30.320]  visits that's what the wellness checks and all of it is but they're only
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:34.560]  telling you half the story it's to induct them in damage their immune
[02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:38.680]  system compromise them attack their blood-brain barrier and give them an IQ
[02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:44.280]  reduction that the White House science are wrote about 1974 well you've got
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:49.640]  studies from 2011 which I cite in this article infant mortality rates regressed
[02:17:49.640 --> 02:17:54.960]  against number of vaccine doses routinely given and it basically documents
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:59.920]  the fact that the countries with the least vaccines for babies also have the
[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:05.480]  least infant mortality so Sweden and Japan give the least vaccines to infants
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:09.480]  up to one years of age they have the least the lowest infant mortality rate
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:14.640]  guess who has the highest number of vaccines given to babies and the highest
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:22.520]  infant mortality USA baby 6.2 infant deaths per 1000 births and you can you
[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:27.480]  can compare these two charts vaccines number of vaccines compared to infant
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:31.280]  mortality and they almost exactly correlate and again they're not trying
[02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:34.560]  to kill the kid outright as folks would notice but when you bust a cap and
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:38.400]  somebody's cerebral cortex 20 something times in the first year 40
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:42.720]  something times about 18 months you're gonna get an overcook up and that's why
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:46.320]  most the kids with autism refined 18 months they go over the next round and
[02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:50.360]  hey it's done the bell beings the brain's gone and the black ops been
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:53.880]  successful and I'm sorry if everybody out there but parents don't want to
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:59.200]  listen so go ahead murder your children government loves it and on on autism of
[02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:03.320]  course Dr. Andrew Wakefield was demonized for over a decade for making
[02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:07.120]  that connection between MMR vaccine and autism well as a new study that's
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:11.720]  confirmed it shows increases in autism rates are linked to the introduction of
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:16.720]  vaccines manufactured using human fetal cell lines from aborted babies and a
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:22.520]  scientist at the CDC went public who wrote the the the document they used to
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:25.000]  go after Wakefield and others and admitted they were basically told the
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:29.240]  lie and it's a fraud and it is brain damaging especially boys why because

[02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:16.320]  strategy I don't do it on purpose I physically get angry when I know they're
[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:19.880]  giving people vaccines to brain damage them and the doctors and nurses are in
[02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:23.120]  denial because they're not murdering killers that's how compartmentalization
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:28.480]  works they believe the hype they're putting out and they'll always when I
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:33.040]  see them on the street or they email me they'll go the science of immunology is
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:37.560]  very well known you didn't go to Harvard actually have argued like five times
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:41.360]  with a Harvard doctor who's connected to my family I'll just leave it at that and
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:46.320]  as a pediatrician and I'll start saying well what about all the secret testing
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:49.440]  what about all the contamination what about all the admissions that the swine
[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:53.760]  flu shots in the 70s killed 10 thousands of people what about and they
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:56.400]  kept I don't want to hear it you're not a medical doctor I'm like I've
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:02.760]  interviewed hundreds of them literally I've got all the medical reports I can
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:08.880]  read these I can read the infant mortality everybody I talked to has got
[02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:12.600]  an autistic boy at 18 months they got the third round of shots they had a
[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:19.800]  convulsion on the way home or that night and they never talked again do you
[02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:25.200]  understand how but they just will not admit they've been doing this see that's
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:28.920]  how the Nazis were most of them didn't think they were bad they thought they
[02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:32.080]  were doing good and his stuff got more and more evil they had already signed
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:37.880]  on so they just went along with it I wish there were high-tech vaccines that
[02:25:37.880 --> 02:25:41.720]  had been double tested that had liability that they tell you the dangers
[02:25:41.720 --> 02:25:47.680]  and you'd make the choice I'm I would probably get some of them but not from
[02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:50.960]  these people it's like saying are you against hamburgers well there's a
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:55.440]  place that where 50 people died in one year from food poisoning and you're
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:59.360]  like let's get hamburgers from this place and I'm like no no no like what
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:03.640]  you don't like hamburgers no man that there's something in those burgers
[02:26:03.640 --> 02:26:09.080]  okay they're not good and then we know the troops have been given the anthrax
[02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:12.920]  shots three different times killed whole groups of them till the doctors at the
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:16.480]  bases wouldn't give them they court-martial people but they'd still stand
[02:26:16.480 --> 02:26:19.640]  their ground they dropped the court-martial the officers aren't getting
[02:26:19.640 --> 02:26:24.360]  the shots Joe Biggs used to get ordered the staff sergeant order is meant to
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:27.960]  take it he'd have to take it and then the higher-ups would not take it and
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:31.240]  laugh at him and just say that's the way it is Joe sergeant get your butt out
[02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:37.040]  there and do it I've been told that by military across the board they know
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:41.800]  okay people know they're bad I'm ranting I want to play the clip of the
[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:45.920]  immunologist at this meeting getting up and saying this the videos up on info
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:51.720]  wars.com right now here's the clip the science seems fairly clear that for the
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:56.200]  first year of life probably the immunization is not stimulating the
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:27:02.040]  the the yeah kind of response that we expected to stimulate so it's the
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:05.680]  rationale for continuing to do that if it's not doing what it's supposed to do
[02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:11.400]  the vaccines are given at pediatric wellness visits and the idea is that
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:17.880]  you are training a parent to bring their child in at all the pediatric wellness
[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:23.080]  visits and that it's only the year visit that actually is truly important but
[02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:30.360]  that for most parents you're not what she's saying again this is
[02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:35.640]  compartmentalized what they're saying is partially true that's why the kids
[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:38.760]  don't get as much brain damaging till 18 months when the immune system actually
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:43.720]  kicks in then they have an autoimmune hemorrhagic almost response is what I've
[02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:48.840]  heard described of in the brain an autoimmune storm blood on the brain and
[02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:52.760]  the cops come and there's blood coming out your 18 month olds they're gonna
[02:27:52.760 --> 02:27:55.800]  arrest you and you don't blame the cops they come your nose coming out the
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:59.080]  babies what you do to your kid the hospital then won't admit it's the
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:02.040]  vaccine even though they know they'll tell the officers they must have shook
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:06.280]  this kid and you're going in handcuffs now since this quietly came out in
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:10.400]  court the last 20 years they don't do that as much because the cops now won't
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:14.560]  call for an indictment because they know I'll tell you Paul closing out in the
[02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:19.640]  last two minutes this is so sinister it makes me so angry and I was talking to
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:22.160]  lady I know that's pregnant right now and she's gonna get shots of the baby
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.360]  she was I've read the literature but I'm still so scared and I got the flu shot
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:29.280]  even though I'm pregnant when we know that's the only thing that probably could
[02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:35.000]  hurt her baby Paul and we have the medical science we know well I mean at
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:39.520]  least know what you're injecting yourself with or your child I mean NHS
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:44.160]  government hospitals in Britain if you've got so much as a cut they
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:47.960]  force you to take a tetanus jab and you say to them I had a friend who this
[02:28:47.960 --> 02:28:51.720]  happened to recently and you know you say what is that there's just take take
[02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:55.120]  it and then it turns out later it's got five different vaccines in it and they
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:58.080]  don't even tell you what's in it when they force it upon you you know we've
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:02.960]  got a mainstream media that says mercury helps not harms children when
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:08.400]  anybody on the planet earth either layman knows that mercury causes brain
[02:29:08.400 --> 02:29:12.320]  damage that's where the term mad as a Hatter came from because in England in
[02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:17.160]  the 18th century they made felt for top hats it was contaminated with mercury
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:21.640]  they got dementia that's where mad as a Hatter comes from but now the mainstream
[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:25.920]  media says it's healthy for kids when we know it causes brain damage so in
[02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:29.280]  that environment just be informed know what you're injecting yourself and your
[02:29:29.280 --> 02:29:33.440]  child with that's right absolutely and the doctors and nurses are committed to
[02:29:33.440 --> 02:29:37.400]  this evil and they're trying to stop it some of them getting targeted they make
[02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:42.840]  them take it or they fire them I mean it's just outrageous totalitarianism and
[02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:45.560]  now they're giving flu shots to kids everywhere without parental consent

[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:38.760]  normal response ladies and gentlemen to all this criminal weirdness this is a
[02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:45.920]  normal response to all of the criminal weirdness it was the abolitionist that
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:51.560]  thought humans being held in pens and made to drag plows like donkeys and
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:55.440]  horses was wrong and people thought they were crazy well let me tell you
[02:37:55.440 --> 02:37:59.520]  something I'm not crazy and I'm no hero either I know when evil's going on to
[02:37:59.520 --> 02:38:04.200]  other people at a fundamental spiritual level and in a DNA level it's happening
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:10.840]  to me and my kids none of us are safe and they're coming with the force
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:14.400]  inoculations now they're pushing them everywhere and I'm telling you folks all
[02:38:14.400 --> 02:38:19.360]  of you that go along with the system are crazy there's this thing and weak
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:22.880]  people that they imagine because they go along they've got power because they're
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:27.920]  with the system that'd be like a gazelle not running from a lion and thinking it
[02:38:27.920 --> 02:38:33.480]  had won because it ran up to the lion and laid down no the gazelle that runs
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:38.040]  away is the one that's smart of course you got the warthogs in Africa we'll see
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:43.680]  like 10 of them chase the lion down and actually run up aside with its tusk and
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:49.200]  cut its guts open so most of time lions don't mess with warthogs even though
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:56.800]  they're little way about a hundred pounds the big ones they'll fight and see
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:38:59.760]  I'm not a gazelle folks I'm not gonna sit here and get attacked you understand
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:06.440]  that I get very angry is a normal mammal I get in a you know what mode when I
[02:39:06.440 --> 02:39:10.160]  sit here and I look at this all day and I'm sick of these people declaring they're
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:14.480]  my enemy and pissing all over me and excuse my friends I'm sick of them I'm
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:21.640]  tired of them and I want the trance the spell that America's under to be broken

[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:45.280]  don't thank me we're under attack here brother it's like thinking a warthog for
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:48.840]  attacking a lion the lion comes running out of the bushes to eat us we got a
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:53.960]  fight you know I said I was gonna talk about foster children I I don't know if
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:58.000]  I had the stomach for it now go ahead talk about foster kids go ahead but let
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:03.800]  me you know it was a few years ago mother Teresa spoke for a national prayer
[02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:09.320]  breakfast and you know she said if you want peace stop killing your children
[02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:17.240]  do you remember that yes and who was who was over there Clinton and Gore and
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:25.360]  their wives sitting on their hands while she received a standing ovation you know
[02:40:25.360 --> 02:40:30.520]  I remember that it shows the evil if we won't protect children none of us are
[02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:34.520]  safe if we don't value humanity then who are we we're saying we're garbage well
[02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:38.000]  I'm not garbage you're not garbage our children aren't garbage I don't care
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:45.400]  what color they are last time through the court there is a judge here our
[02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:50.920]  local county awarded a grandfather has a sexual predator history and a drug
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:41:01.800]  sales history the and they start our foster child so she gets to go to him and I learn in court he has
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:07.640]  another wife yes you heard me correctly he's got a 20-something wife living in
[02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:13.400]  the same trailer home with two children preschoolers who are now this former
[02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:17.960]  foster child's aunt and uncle at two and three and it doesn't stop there and
[02:41:17.960 --> 02:41:23.280]  none of the four attorneys including the guardian had lied him or the county
[02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:30.760]  attorney had no objections it's Alex and people listening it's a theater of the
[02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:37.520]  absurd it is the society is just degenerating and it's it's because we
[02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:40.920]  don't value human life that's come to this thank you so much Lawrence Tim and
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:46.280]  Florida thanks for holding you're on the air hi Alex I really enjoyed listening
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:50.560]  to fellow Schlafly on your program today I can remember listening to her when I
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:55.960]  was a young boy and I'm in my 60s now so and she's still the same as she's
[02:41:55.960 --> 02:42:01.920]  always been a stalwart for freedom I wanted to follow up on what she said
[02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:08.480]  about the the open borders and even in spite of created crises like Ebola there
[02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:14.600]  was an article out in Ghana yesterday if I could read a couple of sentences from
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:19.960]  that heads of state and government of ECOWAS and Alex ECOWAS is the economic
[02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:25.200]  community of West African states yes sub region of the African Union they have
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:29.840]  a laid fears that the Ebola outbreak could disrupt the free movement of
[02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:34.760]  goods and people in the sub region the leaders underlined their commitment to
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:39.800]  ECOWAS principles of free movement in spite of the outbreak of the disease in
[02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:45.200]  some member countries so it doesn't matter to them free trade is
[02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:51.400]  sacrosanct and it's not just free trade in and of itself it's that free trade is
[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:55.560]  the entry level towards regional jurisdiction that's right they have to
[02:42:55.560 --> 02:42:59.320]  keep it open because then it would it would repudiate the regional
[02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:03.000]  jurisdiction which trumps the national and state jurisdiction which is a way
[02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:08.480]  of conquering the sub regions without firing a shot and look we are talking to
[02:43:08.480 --> 02:43:12.880]  medical doctors we went up to Dallas to actually check into the hospitals
[02:43:12.880 --> 02:43:18.400]  interview the people this weekend Anthony good she already did and there is
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:21.880]  clearly what people believe is a bowl of deaths going on and it's being covered
[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:25.680]  up no kidding flights are coming with folks dying on the plane vomiting and
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:28.920]  you know bleeding everywhere and I'm not saying it's a huge outbreak or
[02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:32.480]  something I hope it isn't but they're clearly covering it up and that sets the
[02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:36.320]  precedent for cover-ups and I'm just sitting here it's so surreal to have the
[02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:40.240]  doctor's names to have gone to the hospitals and interviewed them and then
[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:43.760]  you know have some of them by name on the show we're going to get them back on
[02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:50.800]  dr. Lorenzi but this is just a really serious situation well yeah and and
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:54.960]  again it's just one of a number of created crises they it's a two-fold
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:44:00.680]  thing not only to they further integrate these blocks but the crisis serves as
[02:44:00.680 --> 02:44:04.960]  the reason for integrate integrating they have a mantra you've heard it many
[02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:12.000]  times out of the council on four relations here's a quote that none of these
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:19.000]  of these crises can be solved by nations alone they require regional
[02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.760]  solution that's why they'll never let a nation handle it to let it get out of
[02:44:21.760 --> 02:44:26.480]  control and make it be a global solution great point to hear from you okay
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:30.280]  let's go to Chris in Kentucky thanks for holding her on the air worldwide hey
[02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:34.160]  Alex thanks for taking my call hey Chris you've been calling in the show for like

[02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:09.280]  after 2002 I think it was that the 9-11 I just remember vaguely from my memory
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:12.280]  something about you working at a TV station or something yeah it was a
[02:45:12.280 --> 02:45:15.840]  just a radio station we did pay programs and then when 9-11 hit I got more

[02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:45.080]  they're going after this by the way the UN is going after our guns did you hear
[02:45:45.080 --> 02:45:48.320]  the report about that yeah no they've got the treaty and Obama says he'll
[02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:52.640]  follow it and it's a good the way they write it the civilian ownership of
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:57.480]  firearms to be abolished and they say it goes into effect the 24th of December
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:02.840]  yep and I try you know I that's a none of what these people think they do they

[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:54.200]  woodpeckering them we start undermining them we start with drawing our consent
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:57.800]  not complying with unconstitutional stuff just sabotaging the enemy
[02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:01.280]  everywhere I mean you know I'm not saying you should come out at four in the
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:04.000]  morning and climb a billboard that's got government propaganda on it spray
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:10.080]  painted but that's the fun of stuff there is to do anyways what I'm getting at
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:15.520]  here is we're done playing games okay we're done gloves are off we are the
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:18.960]  people trying to save the country we're following the law the globalists are
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:23.560]  laughing saying they're lying to us and cheating us they are out of control God
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:28.280]  bless you as real I've pronounced that right in Nebraska thanks for holding
[02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:32.200]  her on the air hey thanks Alex they have a couple questions for you if you can
[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:36.600]  shed some light for me sure go ahead brother all right I don't know if you've
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:44.360]  covered this before but can you shed some light on the bill HR 6566 and also the
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:48.480]  alleged thirty thousand guillotine the government ordered yes I've had this
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:52.840]  call for 20 years on access television when I started then in talk radio 19
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:49:00.920]  years ago and there is a bill there was a bill to have execution not by electric
[02:49:00.920 --> 02:49:06.800]  chair lethal injection or gas chamber but by guillotine and because the Bible
[02:49:06.800 --> 02:49:10.760]  in Revelation talks about Christians dying by having their head chopped off
[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:14.840]  people think it's that but I mean Saudi Arabia chops heads off so I don't I don't
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:18.640]  know that's particularly that and then I have always heard the story a truck
[02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:23.800]  crashing Houston a truck crashed in in in Maine you know in Bangor a truck
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:29.720]  crashed in Denver and it had martial law signs and guillotines and I've never
[02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:34.520]  seen any proof it's kind of this perennial perpetual urban legend but
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:40.240]  then meanwhile they are training the military and the CIA for torture the
[02:49:40.240 --> 02:49:44.760]  American people and secret arrest I mean Joe Biggs was just a standard staff
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:50.280]  sergeant in Afghanistan Iraq and his one of his main jobs was delivering detainees
[02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:54.560]  for torture and he said a lot of times they wouldn't even come out they'd
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:59.000]  probably he says he believes they were tortured to death and I mean that's just
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:03.640]  standard it was declassified that special forces in Vietnam would torture
[02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:07.120]  people's kids in front of them with electrodes and you know hook them to
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:11.600]  their genitals they call it dialing fish up you can take an old crank
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:15.560]  telephone put two wires in the water and crank it it's a good way to get your
[02:50:15.560 --> 02:50:20.880]  bait not that I've ever done it or anything but you know they would hook
[02:50:20.880 --> 02:50:25.400]  and these were green berets who believe they were fighting communism so it was
[02:50:25.400 --> 02:50:29.400]  worth it to do it because the vietcong were doing stuff like that see you
[02:50:29.400 --> 02:50:33.480]  become evil to beat the evil no you don't beat them you become it George
[02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:38.740]  Washington did not torture he did not rape like the British did and if he
[02:50:38.740 --> 02:50:43.320]  begs me read the real history he was hanging people every week I mean you
[02:50:43.320 --> 02:50:47.600]  did something George Washington would hang you because he had the moral
[02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:51.520]  high ground now he did sign death warrants to you know kill British
[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:54.920]  officers in their homes and stuff like that but track them down and kill them
[02:50:54.920 --> 02:50:58.600]  by means necessary with assassins but if you abuse civilians he would kill you

[02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:30.720]  fly to Japan generally not China and then they gut you and bag all your organs
[02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:36.800]  and everything to be sold off as they drive you to the airport and there's
[02:54:36.800 --> 02:54:41.080]  the headline China's high-tech death van where criminals are executed their

[03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:36.720]  none of us do but you know when you talk to people and you give good
[03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:41.400]  information you are a hero at the very least and most importantly you're a
[03:02:41.400 --> 03:02:47.640]  hero to the unborn okay I do what you do I go up to women are pregnant women
[03:02:47.640 --> 03:02:52.520]  with small babies and I tell them as much as they'll listen to and you know
[03:02:52.520 --> 03:02:57.440]  what usually our receptive usually they do want to hear it because that is their
[03:02:57.440 --> 03:03:00.760]  presence you know precious baby well humans used to always get their news
[03:03:00.760 --> 03:03:03.760]  from each other we're supposed to tell each other what's going on we're supposed
[03:03:03.760 --> 03:03:06.640]  to say hey that restaurant has bad service or hey look out there's a
[03:03:06.640 --> 03:03:09.800]  checkpoint down there we need to get back to communicating with each other
[03:03:09.800 --> 03:03:14.560]  where it's not weird yes I don't care if anyone thinks I'm weird even though I'm
[03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:20.840]  not weird I'm very educated my mother who was born in 1927 my father in 1920 who
[03:03:20.840 --> 03:03:26.760]  was born you know like later in life for my parents but they both have plenty of
[03:03:26.760 --> 03:03:31.560]  children and if you do the math with my family there are hundreds of children
[03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:35.360]  combined and grandchildren and great-grandchildren not one case of
[03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:40.440]  childhood cancer not one case of autism not one case of even asthma and there
[03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:44.760]  my mother never immunized us she did all the research mostly from Europe because

[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:08.760]  you're not vaccinating how by the way it is official Limbaugh was saying he may
[03:04:08.760 --> 03:04:13.760]  do it he is now going to basically shoot the Democrats for claiming that he
[03:04:13.760 --> 03:04:16.480]  don't you know that he wants to attack women and stuff which was made up and
[03:04:16.480 --> 03:04:20.080]  using it to try to go out for sponsors so good I'm glad Limbaugh is doing that
[03:04:20.080 --> 03:04:24.360]  we only got like 20 seconds but he wants to talk about drudge Douglas in Ohio go
[03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:29.640]  ahead last caller yeah Alex you keep telling about drudge in the opt-out
[03:04:29.640 --> 03:04:35.720]  program the $5,000 fine I read the article on that a while back and basically
[03:04:35.720 --> 03:04:39.960]  drudge didn't even have to pay a fine and if you look at the Obamacare there's
[03:04:39.960 --> 03:04:45.600]  like four religious health care providers that you can join that exempts you
[03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:50.280]  from here's the deal my parents just got told their insurance with blue cross
[03:04:50.280 --> 03:04:53.880]  blue shield they've had forever is too low so they are going to be fine I have
[03:04:53.880 --> 03:04:59.840]  the letter and so I don't know what you're reading but I'm out of time
