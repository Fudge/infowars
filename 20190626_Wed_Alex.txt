[00:00.000 --> 00:11.520]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[00:11.520 --> 00:23.160]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:23.160 --> 00:44.600]  Deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:44.600 --> 00:52.240]  Well, we're locked, cocked and ready to rock on this June 26, 2019 Global Wednesday broadcast.
[00:52.240 --> 00:54.240]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:54.240 --> 00:59.240]  We normally do 10 hours of live transmission a day with three hours of day-to-night, weekday mornings,
[00:59.240 --> 01:04.240]  8am central kickoff, and of course the Alex Jones show for the next four hours.
[01:04.240 --> 01:09.240]  Then the War Room with Owen Schreuer that ends at 6pm more broadcasts and more shows are in development
[01:09.240 --> 01:14.240]  right now to fight the globalist, to take action and to have 24-hour day coverage.
[01:14.240 --> 01:26.240]  But when we have special events like Clown World, USA, two-night event, we're going to end up doing, I guess it'll be 14 hours of live broadcast today.
[01:26.240 --> 01:36.240]  We'll have a break from 6-7 while we get set up with our intrepid crew, and then we're going to go live at 7 central with an hour of pre-game coverage
[01:36.240 --> 01:39.240]  of the kickoff of the 14-ring circus.
[01:39.240 --> 01:45.240]  I guess the 20-plus-ring circus we count all the candidates, and we are going to be breaking it all down live with myself,
[01:45.240 --> 01:51.240]  Robert Barnes' studio, Owen Schreuer, and we're going to have a bunch of guests on, and we've got three crews,
[01:51.240 --> 01:59.240]  Millie Weaver, Caitlin Bennett, and our own crew here from Austin on the ground in Miami.
[01:59.240 --> 02:02.240]  ThreadsReport.com really gets it right.
[02:02.240 --> 02:09.240]  The circus comes to Miami, circus comes to town, and they play the lead part.
[02:09.240 --> 02:15.240]  There's going to be 10 of them up on the stage tonight, and of course it's down to a three-way race with Elizabeth Warren,
[02:15.240 --> 02:20.240]  Bernie Tandud, and sleepy, creepy Joe Biden.
[02:20.240 --> 02:27.240]  Well, tonight it's Elizabeth Warren on the stage, so she'll obviously be called the winner, I believe,
[02:27.240 --> 02:35.240]  George and Beto O'Rourke, and all the rest of these idiots have fallen off all these celebrities,
[02:35.240 --> 02:44.240]  all these flashes in the pan, but Pocahontas, Pocahontas, Bernie, though Biden,
[02:44.240 --> 02:48.240]  they're leading the legions of the living Zombo dead.
[02:48.240 --> 02:55.240]  Half zombie, half clown, half parasite.
[02:55.240 --> 03:01.240]  Last time I did that joke, the Young Turks went, Alex Jones doesn't know that that's a third.
[03:01.240 --> 03:07.240]  Alex Jones claimed that they're making human creatures that are one-third this, one-third that, and one-third.
[03:07.240 --> 03:11.240]  But wait a minute, he said it's half this, half that, and half that.
[03:11.240 --> 03:13.240]  It's called a joke, Young Turks.
[03:13.240 --> 03:23.240]  It's called a joke, you know, like South Park, man bear pig, half man, half bear, half pig.
[03:23.240 --> 03:32.240]  Yes, we understand, halves only have two, thirds come in threes, fourths come in fourths, fifths come in fifths,
[03:32.240 --> 03:36.240]  and fifths don't last very long at night at the house.
[03:36.240 --> 03:38.240]  All right, I'm going to stop with the puns.
[03:38.240 --> 03:41.240]  Let's get real serious real quick.
[03:41.240 --> 03:50.240]  All hell is breaking loose, and I can be quite negative, and it's very positive to admit the bad things that are happening so you can fix them.
[03:50.240 --> 04:00.240]  But that said, my good friends, we have some very, very, very exciting things going on.
[04:00.240 --> 04:07.240]  President Trump, we have the video coming up, has come out on a Fox business show last night,
[04:07.240 --> 04:15.240]  and said that the federal government is planning and needs to sue Google and Facebook for 2020,
[04:15.240 --> 04:20.240]  and met an election meddling, and folks, if you want to read some unintentional comedy,
[04:20.240 --> 04:28.240]  we have the head of Google censorship in an article here I just had earlier, I've moved it around,
[04:28.240 --> 04:34.240]  maybe print it again for me, explaining, took her a couple days to come up with a story,
[04:34.240 --> 04:41.240]  that it was preposterous of the story's fake, and that that's it.
[04:41.240 --> 04:45.240]  She just says it isn't true, and that it's all made up.
[04:45.240 --> 04:48.240]  Wait till we get to all of that, and more on the other side.
[04:48.240 --> 04:51.240]  Remember, only you can override the censors.
[04:51.240 --> 04:55.240]  Only you can smash the AI grid with your human action.
[04:55.240 --> 05:22.240]  So spread the live links now, please.
[05:25.240 --> 05:30.240]  It's a very structured, little D Democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up,
[05:30.240 --> 05:35.240]  the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting info wars,
[05:35.240 --> 05:41.240]  and it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like,
[05:41.240 --> 05:44.240]  and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model,
[05:44.240 --> 05:48.240]  and the ability to do that, and at the same time support press, support speech,
[05:48.240 --> 05:53.240]  support letting the audience choose what news they want to see, and what views they want to hold,
[05:53.240 --> 05:56.240]  and that's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment,
[05:56.240 --> 06:25.240]  which is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[06:26.240 --> 06:30.240]  It's only from Miami, Florida.
[06:30.240 --> 06:37.240]  20 Democrat stragglers, each promising more of a hellish communist future than the next.
[06:37.240 --> 06:46.240]  Race baiting, war mongering, Russa phobing, America hating.
[06:46.240 --> 06:48.240]  You want it, you've got it.
[06:48.240 --> 06:57.240]  Two nights, 20 kleptocratic congenital liars on the stage for two nights only.
[06:57.240 --> 07:07.240]  The greatest show on earth with Joe Creepy Biden.
[07:07.240 --> 07:18.240]  Buddy, Swindler, Kami Sanders, police state, lock the black people up, Camilla Harris, Beto the liar, O'Rourke,
[07:18.240 --> 07:28.240]  Chloe Dumb Dumb Booker, Liar, Pocahontas, and so much more.
[07:28.240 --> 07:32.240]  It's a three way race, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:32.240 --> 07:38.240]  Greg Swallowswell isn't even polling 1%, poor little Swallowswell.
[07:38.240 --> 07:39.240]  And this is going to be interesting.
[07:39.240 --> 07:43.240]  Wednesday night, we're going to be covering it this evening.
[07:43.240 --> 07:48.240]  Kickoff, 7pm central, infowars.com, Ford slash show.
[07:48.240 --> 07:55.240]  We're also launching a special URL the next hour, clownworld.us.
[07:55.240 --> 08:00.240]  So you can share the link and all the bots wouldn't have blacklisted it yet.
[08:00.240 --> 08:06.240]  You know, we're going to start having domains of the week, sometimes domains of the day.
[08:06.240 --> 08:09.240]  All some on Twitter and Facebook and everywhere.
[08:09.240 --> 08:18.240]  You can take this amazing graphic of clownworld 2000 and 19 and get out to everybody.
[08:18.240 --> 08:21.240]  You know, for the live covers tonight and tomorrow night with myself.
[08:21.240 --> 08:25.240]  I want to show you Robert Barnes, three of our crews on the ground in Miami.
[08:25.240 --> 08:32.240]  We're going to be covering every angle of it.
[08:32.240 --> 08:39.240]  Obviously, here is the big, big, big news.
[08:39.240 --> 08:47.240]  Google's head of censorship has a nice or a willing name like Ministry of Truth.
[08:47.240 --> 08:52.240]  Got caught bragging how Trump won't be allowed to win, how they do it, how they control it,
[08:52.240 --> 08:58.240]  how they're manipulating and how they're shutting down all discourse by conservatives and nationalists.
[08:58.240 --> 09:02.240]  Because it's not fair to people that Trump win.
[09:02.240 --> 09:09.240]  Now, it's as clear as day, but she's come out in incredible unintentional comedy.
[09:09.240 --> 09:13.240]  But it's worked this long, so I want to do it again and said none of it's true.
[09:13.240 --> 09:17.240]  It's all lies. She has no power. She's a nobody.
[09:17.240 --> 09:22.240]  She was just on a trip to Europe representing Google and major countries.
[09:22.240 --> 09:27.240]  And it's just, it's just made up. She's deleted all her social media,
[09:27.240 --> 09:31.240]  so you can't find out her past statements, but put out this news statement.
[09:31.240 --> 09:36.240]  So the project Veritas has devastated them and Trump says U.S. should sue.
[09:36.240 --> 09:43.240]  That means the Justice Department, Facebook and Google complains about alleged political bias by tech giants.
[09:43.240 --> 09:48.240]  That's like alleging that Adolf Hitler had a mustache,
[09:48.240 --> 09:55.240]  or alleging that Trump has interesting hair,
[09:55.240 --> 09:58.240]  or alleging that grass is green or the sky is blue,
[09:58.240 --> 10:02.240]  and they're just going to march right back into Congress and lie again and again.
[10:02.240 --> 10:06.240]  They need to be SWAT-teamed for election meddling.
[10:06.240 --> 10:13.240]  Understand, folks, they stole the House in 2018.
[10:13.240 --> 10:17.240]  They indicted more than 10 Republican House members that were sure wins,
[10:17.240 --> 10:24.240]  but four of them in California, to make that whole state go deep blue.
[10:24.240 --> 10:32.240]  And then all those other seats they stole, Google brags that they can manipulate the outcome of elections up to 20 points,
[10:32.240 --> 10:38.240]  because 93% of searches are done on their platform.
[10:38.240 --> 10:42.240]  It's unbelievable. And finally, Trump was on Fox Business last night,
[10:42.240 --> 10:46.240]  and is moving in the right direction, but we've got to blow his phones up with phone calls.
[10:46.240 --> 10:48.240]  There'll be a headline that I said blow up a White House today.
[10:48.240 --> 10:52.240]  That means blow the phones up, you know, melt the phone lines.
[10:52.240 --> 10:56.240]  I know the audience gets that, but corporate media literally has hit that level.
[10:56.240 --> 10:59.240]  And it's time to take action. He says he's going to do it.
[10:59.240 --> 11:04.240]  We know he gives the orders. We know he's ignored because Google is so arrogant
[11:04.240 --> 11:07.240]  and has paid most of the government off, including many people in Trump's administration.
[11:07.240 --> 11:13.240]  Yes, he banned lobbying, but that just lets his underlings secretly lobby.
[11:13.240 --> 11:20.240]  Some people, I'm told, in Trump's orbit are making a million dollars a day as unofficial lobbyists,
[11:20.240 --> 11:25.240]  all because they have entre to el presidente.
[11:25.240 --> 11:30.240]  And it's a nightmare situation, but we've got a real president there,
[11:30.240 --> 11:33.240]  and the system knows it and is fighting back.
[11:33.240 --> 11:36.240]  Let's go to this clip of the president. Here it is.
[11:36.240 --> 11:40.240]  What she does to our country, she's suing all our companies.
[11:40.240 --> 11:45.240]  You know, look, we should be suing Google and Facebook and all that, which perhaps we will, okay?
[11:45.240 --> 11:50.240]  But you see, Apple, they're suing Apple for billions of dollars, they're suing everybody.
[11:50.240 --> 11:55.240]  They make it very almost impossible to do two-way business.
[11:55.240 --> 11:59.240]  So what happened, I said, folks, they are worse than China except smaller.
[11:59.240 --> 12:01.240]  It's smaller than China, but they're worse than China.
[12:01.240 --> 12:06.240]  The barriers they put up for our farmers are, because they want to protect their farmers.
[12:06.240 --> 12:10.240]  They have a lot of farmers. You know those farmers, you drive down the country road,
[12:10.240 --> 12:12.240]  you see the beautiful farms all over the place.
[12:12.240 --> 12:15.240]  I don't even say they're wrong, but it's not fair to us.
[12:15.240 --> 12:20.240]  They send in Mercedes-Benz, they send in BMW, they pay virtually no tax.
[12:20.240 --> 12:24.240]  They take nothing. We give them, it's so one-sided,
[12:24.240 --> 12:28.240]  and they make approximately $180 billion a year for years.
[12:28.240 --> 12:31.240]  I've got to get to technology and also the border crisis.
[12:31.240 --> 12:35.240]  All right, so there you have it. I'm going to sue them maybe.
[12:35.240 --> 12:43.240]  No, Mr. President, you point out that the EU is suing Google and Facebook to take control of them,
[12:43.240 --> 12:49.240]  and they're rolling over and giving them full control and helping arrest their citizens in mass.
[12:49.240 --> 12:51.240]  It's all over the news today.
[12:51.240 --> 12:55.240]  And so by the U.S. not stepping in and saying, you won't censor U.S. citizens,
[12:55.240 --> 13:01.240]  and you won't meddle in the election, we allow them to do this
[13:01.240 --> 13:05.240]  and allow foreign governments and corporations to fill that vacuum.
[13:05.240 --> 13:07.240]  Here's two of the articles today.
[13:07.240 --> 13:13.240]  Facebook to hand over users' info to French government for hate speech prosecutions.
[13:13.240 --> 13:21.240]  Swedish government, court convicts man for not deleting hateful comments posted by others to his Facebook feed.
[13:21.240 --> 13:24.240]  That's the new Facebook rule. Somebody else says something?
[13:24.240 --> 13:28.240]  Well, it's up to you to police it, even though you're not even paying attention.
[13:28.240 --> 13:31.240]  This is total police state.
[13:31.240 --> 13:38.240]  And Facebook announced a month ago that they're going to start suing Facebook users that don't moderate their forums.
[13:38.240 --> 13:42.240]  Talk about a giant reeducation camp, but hey, you put up with it, so why not?
[13:42.240 --> 13:44.240]  They're going to go for a probe.
[13:44.240 --> 13:49.240]  So this is a big, big deal, and Trump must act. They are still in the election.
[13:49.240 --> 13:57.240]  We have big articles up on infowars.com and newswars.com detailing how Google and others won't even take
[13:57.240 --> 14:03.240]  Marsha Blackburn's ads for running for Congress and stuff like that.
[14:03.240 --> 14:10.240]  I mean, it's completely out of control, and it's getting worse and worse because nothing's being done.
[14:10.240 --> 14:15.240]  And at a certain point, you got to ask, I mean, is Trump really working for the other side?
[14:15.240 --> 14:24.240]  And we know that's not the case, but he underestimates the power of social media and the power of citizens to be able to communicate online.
[14:24.240 --> 14:28.240]  And this is the whole enchilada. This is 2020.
[14:28.240 --> 14:32.240]  Trump would have had a historic total realignment and kept the House and the Senate.
[14:32.240 --> 14:37.240]  He would have had a trifecta and a real mandate, but the Republican establishment doesn't want that.
[14:37.240 --> 14:42.240]  They want to work with the Democrats to keep the whole globalist status quo.
[14:42.240 --> 14:45.240]  The Koch brothers are financing all the anti-free speech activity.
[14:45.240 --> 14:48.240]  They're financing all the neocons and liberals.
[14:48.240 --> 14:53.240]  That's why we're in so much trouble is the fifth column of globalists in the Republican Party.
[14:53.240 --> 14:57.240]  Let's go to break with this important promo of the new shirt that's set to sell out.
[14:57.240 --> 15:23.240]  Only 5,000 have been printed.
[15:23.240 --> 15:27.240]  Let a time to be alive.
[15:27.240 --> 15:35.240]  20 Democratic clown candidates debating against themselves to find out who will be crowned top clown.
[15:35.240 --> 15:44.240]  Get your ultra limited edition clown world t-shirts today during our clown world broadcast of the Democratic debates.
[15:44.240 --> 15:48.240]  Now don't miss out because when these are gone, they're gone for good.
[15:48.240 --> 15:59.240]  Democratic candidates exactly what clowns they truly are with the limited edition clown world t-shirt at InfoWarsStore.com.
[15:59.240 --> 16:04.240]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[16:04.240 --> 16:09.240]  I sued the IRS in one. I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[16:09.240 --> 16:14.240]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[16:14.240 --> 16:18.240]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[16:18.240 --> 16:20.240]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[16:45.240 --> 16:49.240]  that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[16:49.240 --> 16:54.240]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[16:54.240 --> 17:00.240]  Because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[17:00.240 --> 17:06.240]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:06.240 --> 17:12.240]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.

[18:03.240 --> 18:06.240]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[18:06.240 --> 18:12.240]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[18:12.240 --> 18:22.240]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[18:22.240 --> 18:27.240]  Yeah, I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency. It's the only way I think he could be defeated other than assassinating him.
[18:27.240 --> 18:29.240]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[18:29.240 --> 18:35.240]  I agree entirely. And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.240 --> 18:40.240]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old. I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:40.240 --> 18:49.240]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war. You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[18:49.240 --> 18:58.240]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War. And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[18:58.240 --> 19:00.240]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[19:00.240 --> 19:11.240]  Info Wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so. It's Orwellian. It's biblical. It's authoritarian. It's insane.
[19:11.240 --> 19:21.240]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking.
[19:21.240 --> 19:32.240]  I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real SOS. If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, Info Wars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[19:32.240 --> 19:38.240]  And so we've reached that point. It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever, we have withstood so many other attacks.
[19:38.240 --> 19:47.240]  We've gone through so much because of your support. You have, you have been there, but let me tell you, they are pissed. They haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault.
[19:47.240 --> 19:54.240]  So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now at InfoWars.com. It's your fight.
[19:54.240 --> 20:09.240]  Decide whether or not you want InfoWars to continue because we could be shut down.
[20:25.240 --> 20:35.240]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. The day has come, Clown World. In the capital of Clown World, the next two nights will be Miami, Florida.
[20:35.240 --> 20:43.240]  The circus comes to town, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PresidentPlanet.com, Summit.News, Pulse site.
[20:43.240 --> 20:56.240]  We'll all have live coverage and feeds with three camera crews on the ground, four hours of coverage. It kicks off at 7 p.m. central tonight.
[20:56.240 --> 21:09.240]  We'll analyze NBC and all of it. Please stick a fly in their ointment, take the link, InfoWars.com, forward slash show, send it out and say, hey, Clown World coverage.
[21:09.240 --> 21:14.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, you don't want to miss it. That's how we get through the censors.
[21:14.240 --> 21:21.240]  That's how we override the corporate media and tell everybody about the local AM and FM stations and TV stations that you're listening or watching us on.
[21:21.240 --> 21:30.240]  It's so essential to support those folks just as much as you support us. If you buy products from us, if you send us donations, please do that for local stations.
[21:30.240 --> 21:39.240]  They are just as important as this broadcast. Without them, it's like a horse without a carriage without a horse.
[21:39.240 --> 21:46.240]  The light without the dark, the sun without the moon. Well, not like having a glass of water in the desert.
[21:46.240 --> 21:51.240]  We sure need those stations. We're very thankful to them and they're awesome. They're the folks that see through the propaganda.
[21:51.240 --> 22:06.240]  Okay, I get just as sickened by all of this as you do. And what happens is I don't give in, I don't give up, but I just give out.
[22:06.240 --> 22:12.240]  And they have a famous NAMBLO writer, North American Man Boy Love Association.
[22:12.240 --> 22:17.240]  The UN says it's a human right to have sex with your children.
[22:17.240 --> 22:27.240]  And they've come out and praised Desmond as amazing in this whole pedophilic promotion of little kids dancing around half naked at Pito bars.
[22:27.240 --> 22:32.240]  That's what they are. And it's the coming out of the LGBTP. It's totally evil.
[22:32.240 --> 22:43.240]  I didn't even cover this article yesterday and then I saw more articles without even looking with mainstream news praising it and how sexy Desmond the little boy is.
[22:43.240 --> 22:52.240]  And when you read what this guy writes, this famous pro-Pito writer, it's just unbelievable. I'm going to read this on air next hour.
[22:52.240 --> 23:00.240]  I want you to hear what this guy has to say. And then I forgot to tell the crew, you print me some of the articles praising this.
[23:00.240 --> 23:06.240]  Paul, even another story at Summit.News on it. I want to show you, because the left has this new thing.
[23:06.240 --> 23:13.240]  Oh, Jones, why you cover pedophilia so much? You must like it like we do. Oh, Jones, you're the one that's Pito connected.
[23:13.240 --> 23:20.240]  Oh, you mean some filthy Democrat sent us child porn we never opened? And then I got subpoenaed asking for it.
[23:20.240 --> 23:26.240]  And then they found it hidden in there. And the media ran with it. What a group of unbelievable people, man.
[23:26.240 --> 23:31.240]  I'm going to increase our coverage of the Pito coming out movement.
[23:31.240 --> 23:38.240]  So you guys can try whatever you want, but no one is going to buy what you've done.
[23:38.240 --> 23:46.240]  And I'm telling you, I've been on the internet looking 99% of the comments know that you tried to set me up.
[23:46.240 --> 23:50.240]  And there's that big reward out there.
[23:50.240 --> 23:57.240]  We've got the email addresses of where it came from in the FBI letter they sent us saying that we're innocent and the victims.
[23:57.240 --> 24:02.240]  And there's that big $100,000. I said a million. I really don't have that.
[24:02.240 --> 24:10.240]  Technically, we could do it, but I walked that back. It's it's $100,000. I've paid 115,000 out in prizes before.
[24:10.240 --> 24:18.240]  Oh, this is 100%. Somebody gets arrested for this. It's indicted. You get $100,000.
[24:18.240 --> 24:23.240]  And I was sent it right after we got sued. And we got subpoenaed for it.
[24:23.240 --> 24:36.240]  You think about that and that same law firm put in a falsified transcript that was given to the media and put out with fake quotes of me in it.
[24:36.240 --> 24:42.240]  And we know we know they've hired former quote media individuals who were consultants running this.
[24:42.240 --> 24:46.240]  They're the ones that contacted the lawyers in Connecticut. They're the ones that got them to sue us.
[24:46.240 --> 24:50.240]  They're the ones that are quarterbacking it as a whole media group behind this.
[24:50.240 --> 24:54.240]  And I'm not really supposed to get into this at this point, but they already know.
[24:54.240 --> 24:59.240]  I mean, they already know that we're looking into it and have private investigators and people on it.
[24:59.240 --> 25:12.240]  So I am going on the offense, but I'm going to say this before we come back and get into all the big world news, the economy news, the open border news, AOC going to the border and doing the worst acting.
[25:12.240 --> 25:29.240]  It's worse than a fifth grade play crying at the people in the concentration camp who came here illegally and who fight and die to get here because we're so bad so they can then bitch and complain like AOC.
[25:29.240 --> 25:35.240]  And she just falls down in pain and it's just a bunch of Hollywood scum she was with.
[25:35.240 --> 25:40.240]  And they're sociopaths, folks. The globalist are sociopaths. They know we have a conscience.
[25:40.240 --> 25:47.240]  And so just like Islamics would like take a kid as they're getting to Europe free card and then the ship would turn over and a little kid would drown.
[25:47.240 --> 25:51.240]  No one would help them. Then they show the dead kid on the beach and say, you've got to open your borders.
[25:51.240 --> 26:05.240]  Well, now they've got a father and the dead son photos and they're saying, you know, that it's the fault of America that we just don't have totally open borders for 7 billion people to come here and then give everything free to them.
[26:05.240 --> 26:16.240]  It's an incredible strategy of manipulation. It's all coming up. Paul Watson's article talking about her designer clothing and her fancy PR stunt is linked up on drugsreport.com.
[26:16.240 --> 26:27.240]  It's also at summit.news. And why is newswars.com and summit.news so important? You can share our articles from there and they don't get censored as much.
[26:27.240 --> 26:36.240]  Info Wars is blacklisted. That has a good effect in many areas in that. Hey, you heard Info Wars, the forbidden site. Alex Jones is still on air.
[26:36.240 --> 26:45.240]  Find out what he's really saying versus what they're saying and find out why they're trying to set him up.
[26:45.240 --> 26:53.240]  And people will tune in. That's how we win the war. That's how we stay on air. This is a critical fight. America's fight. The world's fight.
[26:53.240 --> 27:00.240]  But to get around the censors on Facebook and Twitter and everywhere on YouTube, summit.news. That's not my site. It's Paul's site.
[27:00.240 --> 27:05.240]  But most of the news on there is original stuff he's written. I don't care. I want to win the fight against the globalist.
[27:05.240 --> 27:17.240]  And newswars.com. So by word of mouth, you tell folks go to infowars.com or on your email or on your personally reaching out saying, hey, go find out why it's so forbidden.
[27:17.240 --> 27:26.240]  Infowars.com. Pass it on. We're all Spartacus now, as they say. But for getting around the censors, newswars.com, summit.news.
[27:26.240 --> 27:36.240]  In fact, ask IT. I had this idea this morning to launch clownworld.us, a URL we own, with just the player for tonight's coverage of the debates.
[27:36.240 --> 27:45.240]  And they said, okay, we'll get it up and get it done and tell me when. Because I want the listeners to know they can promote clownworld.us starting in just a few hours.
[27:45.240 --> 27:54.240]  That'll get around the censors, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, everywhere, and say, hey, tune in for amazing, hilarious coverage of the greatest show on Earth.
[27:54.240 --> 28:03.240]  It's censored. Pay it forward. Pass this link on. And it'll, again, just break the will of Google, Facebook, and all these censors.
[28:03.240 --> 28:10.240]  Speaking of that, then I'm going to come back and cover the news. We had an idea. One of the great camera guys, Drew, had an idea.
[28:10.240 --> 28:16.240]  He said, hey, you're making this clownworld limited edition shirt. It's got the world as a clown in FullWars.com.
[28:16.240 --> 28:24.240]  On the back, make it like a concert where you show two nights only Miami who the people are. And, you know, it's a fun shirt.
[28:24.240 --> 28:31.240]  I said, okay, let's print 5,000 limited edition. I figure it'll take a couple of weeks to sell those. It's a hot shirt, but still, that's a lot.
[28:31.240 --> 28:39.240]  It'll help fund the operation. We already sold a fifth of these the first day it went on sale. So that's great. Thanks for the support.
[28:39.240 --> 28:47.240]  I want to sell all 5,000 of these in the next two days. Limited edition, only 5,000 being printed now, ships in two weeks.
[28:47.240 --> 28:54.240]  It's being printed in the USA. Clownworld 2020 limited edition, infowars.com in the t-shirt section.
[28:54.240 --> 28:59.240]  Hit this collector shirt and support the InfoWare 360 win.
[28:59.240 --> 29:09.240]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[29:09.240 --> 29:17.240]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:17.240 --> 29:23.240]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[29:23.240 --> 29:31.240]  Heart pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved. Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:31.240 --> 29:58.240]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[30:01.240 --> 30:05.240]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[30:32.240 --> 30:39.240]  For all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support, because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[30:39.240 --> 30:44.240]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important.
[30:44.240 --> 30:50.240]  The enemy could win. We're a key chess piece in this fight. We're being used by God. You're being used by God.
[30:50.240 --> 30:55.240]  This is Providence, so I salute you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[30:55.240 --> 31:00.240]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[31:00.240 --> 31:06.240]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget, this is the Maximum Alert. We wouldn't be here without you. I thank you for your support and your help.
[31:06.240 --> 31:12.240]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight, but we need financial support and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at infowarsstore.com.
[31:12.240 --> 31:18.240]  We want to just give us straight donations. There's a PO box. We want to mail us a check. We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[31:18.240 --> 31:22.240]  We need money to fight back and to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.

[31:58.240 --> 32:18.240]  We're not going to back down.
[32:29.240 --> 32:34.240]  They actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[32:34.240 --> 32:45.240]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear.
[32:45.240 --> 32:53.240]  And the InfoWars audience has broken through that. They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[32:53.240 --> 33:00.240]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation, lawfare, and libel targeting youth.
[33:24.240 --> 33:28.240]  Honk honk. Honk honk. Honk honk. Honk honk.
[33:28.240 --> 33:35.240]  Facebook 2 weeks ago openly said, anyone posting clowns or saying, Honk honk,
[33:35.240 --> 33:40.240]  if our moderators decided to be mean to Democrats, they're going to be restricted or banned.
[33:40.240 --> 33:46.240]  Because we're in such a free country.
[33:46.240 --> 33:48.240]  Isn't that fun, kids?
[33:48.580 --> 33:50.580]  Because we're liberals.
[33:52.180 --> 33:54.180]  Don't talk that about us.
[33:54.760 --> 33:56.940]  And it's the greatest show on earth.
[33:58.140 --> 34:04.120]  So George Soros with US taxpayer money and your European EU taxpayer money has taken billions of dollars.
[34:04.120 --> 34:06.400]  The number's around four billion we know of the last ten years.
[34:07.480 --> 34:10.920]  And because it's illegal what they're doing, they give him the money and he does it.
[34:10.920 --> 34:21.920]  He haunts shows thousands of rubber boats coming across every few days, big old 20-foot, 50-foot, 100-foot Zodiac rubber boats out of North Africa, out of the Middle East,
[34:21.920 --> 34:26.920]  landing in Spain, in Greece, in Italy, in Macedonia.
[34:27.920 --> 34:30.920]  Just slamming in, slamming in, slamming in.
[34:30.920 --> 34:35.920]  And then thousands of Africans a day just running, screaming through your town saying,
[34:35.920 --> 34:39.920]  money, give me money or you'll die. They even know English.
[34:39.920 --> 34:41.920]  We've played that.
[34:41.920 --> 34:43.920]  Crime rates exploding.
[34:43.920 --> 34:45.920]  Same thing here in the United States.
[34:45.920 --> 34:52.920]  All the footage of little kids going through barbed wire under things to get into the hellish country like AOC did.
[34:53.920 --> 35:00.920]  So they can wear $4,000 designer outfits like she does and say, we hate America and white people suck.
[35:00.920 --> 35:03.920]  Now most Hispanics coming into the country aren't saying that or doing that.
[35:03.920 --> 35:05.920]  Hispanics are having the biggest group now.
[35:05.920 --> 35:08.920]  It's Chinese women for five years or the biggest group.
[35:08.920 --> 35:14.920]  They fly in on visas though, eight months pregnant, have their baby who becomes a citizen that everything's paid for.
[35:14.920 --> 35:16.920]  And they're usually wealthy Chinese.
[35:18.920 --> 35:19.920]  How they get wealthy?
[35:19.920 --> 35:23.920]  Well, being penny pincers and getting free stuff from the USA.
[35:23.920 --> 35:42.920]  So Alexandria Cortez or AO Mac Daddy Cortez, as she's known, went down to the Texas border with a bunch of Hollywood people in a fancy outfit wearing a $600 Mavudo museum watch.
[35:42.920 --> 35:46.920]  At least it's not $3,000 shoes like normal and $4,000 outfits.
[35:46.920 --> 36:03.920]  And she just saw the tent city and went because they're getting three and four times their previous records a day up to 15,000 people at that checkpoint alone.
[36:03.920 --> 36:06.920]  And the border patrol is working 18 hours a day.
[36:06.920 --> 36:08.920]  They're collapsing in exhaustion.
[36:08.920 --> 36:10.920]  They didn't get the $12 billion they asked for.
[36:10.920 --> 36:12.920]  They got $1.3 billion this year.
[36:12.920 --> 36:19.920]  And there are 14 to 15,000 people per sector a day that they're catching.
[36:19.920 --> 36:26.920]  And by the way, the people just turned themselves in because once they get here, they get given to a judge 90% never show up to the hearings.
[36:26.920 --> 36:28.920]  So they show up and say, feed me, see more.
[36:28.920 --> 36:30.920]  Remember Little Shopahoras?
[36:30.920 --> 36:33.920]  The plant goes, I said, feed me.
[36:33.920 --> 36:35.920]  I said, feed me.
[36:35.920 --> 36:37.920]  And so they show up.
[36:37.920 --> 36:39.920]  They're not allowed to drug test them, not allowed to test for diseases.
[36:39.920 --> 36:43.920]  They just show up 30% of the kids aren't with their parents.
[36:43.920 --> 36:45.920]  They genetically test them aren't even in the family group.
[36:45.920 --> 36:46.920]  They're not aunts.
[36:46.920 --> 36:47.920]  They're not uncles.
[36:47.920 --> 36:48.920]  They're not cousins.
[36:48.920 --> 36:54.920]  Their kids grabbed out of villages many times two years old crying for mommy.
[36:54.920 --> 36:58.920]  And when the illegals get through with them, they just throw them into a park, throw them into the woods.
[36:58.920 --> 37:04.920]  Hundreds of kids a day are being found just dumped in Texas, sometimes 300 miles into the state.
[37:04.920 --> 37:12.920]  And they say, my mommy live in this town, then the US has to find out where they live, get them on an airplane and fly into Mexico to meet mommy.
[37:12.920 --> 37:18.920]  And the little kids are all over the Mexican news are like, I got grabbed out of my yard two weeks ago and I ended up in North Texas.
[37:18.920 --> 37:26.920]  Oh, but AOC goes to the emergency camp cities where people are getting food and everything else.
[37:26.920 --> 37:28.920]  And everything's overwhelmed.
[37:28.920 --> 37:31.920]  All started by Obama saying, come here, come here.
[37:31.920 --> 37:32.920]  It's all free.
[37:32.920 --> 37:33.920]  Come here.
[37:33.920 --> 37:34.920]  It's all free stuff.
[37:34.920 --> 37:45.920]  So we have thousands a week that are being caught from Africa alone now and from the Congo where they have Ebola Ebola's gotten outside the state outside the nation.
[37:45.920 --> 37:48.920]  We go show you that footage.
[37:48.920 --> 37:57.920]  No news coverage of it, but drugsreport.com is no one else picked up hours of HD footage of the most insane garbage you've ever seen.
[37:57.920 --> 38:04.920]  90% online security says never show back up at the hearings and many of them have kidnapped children's Senate report.
[38:04.920 --> 38:05.920]  But AOC shows up.
[38:05.920 --> 38:08.920]  She doesn't go to the tent cities in New York.
[38:08.920 --> 38:19.920]  She doesn't go to the tent cities in LA where they have up to how many 46,000 people in 150 square block area of Skid Row.
[38:19.920 --> 38:20.920]  Yeah, look it up.
[38:20.920 --> 38:26.920]  46,000 people, feces and racks everywhere.
[38:26.920 --> 38:35.920]  Typhus and bubonic plague and leprosy and drug immune TB spreading like wild fire.
[38:35.920 --> 38:36.920]  Police getting TB.
[38:36.920 --> 38:38.920]  Police getting typhus.
[38:38.920 --> 38:40.920]  Children getting TB, getting typhus.
[38:40.920 --> 38:45.920]  Black plague, bubonic plague, flesh eating bacteria.
[38:45.920 --> 38:54.920]  Does AOC go down there like I did for two hours and I kept throwing up in my mouth so I finally just succumbed and ran?
[38:54.920 --> 38:56.920]  I'm a full grown man.
[38:56.920 --> 39:02.920]  I used to have a job of cleaning up dead cows with bulldozers and stuff on ranches.
[39:02.920 --> 39:07.920]  Imagine pushing dead cows struck by lightning a week before with maggots all over it or a dead horse.
[39:07.920 --> 39:09.920]  I never got sick doing that.
[39:09.920 --> 39:14.920]  When you go to Skid Row, the cops we were with were holding back vomit.
[39:14.920 --> 39:17.920]  You don't see her going there.
[39:17.920 --> 39:25.920]  You see her going to a fence in a fancy white outfit and going, people fought to get in.
[39:25.920 --> 39:28.920]  They turned themselves in.
[39:28.920 --> 39:37.920]  We're there literally taking care of these people and AOC shows up with the fakest photos.
[39:37.920 --> 39:39.920]  Let's go to infowars.com for TV viewers.
[39:39.920 --> 39:44.920]  Radio listeners go there and we've got photos of AOC on her own Twitter.
[39:44.920 --> 39:47.920]  Can we show people these photos, please?
[39:47.920 --> 39:57.920]  And you want to see the fakest photos you've ever seen in your life.
[39:57.920 --> 40:00.920]  Just look at the one on the upper left-hand corner.
[40:00.920 --> 40:02.920]  That's got to be a meme contest. Click on that.
[40:02.920 --> 40:04.920]  What is she thinking about?
[40:04.920 --> 40:09.920]  Gee, I'm bummed out. They're going to find out I'm really from a rich family and never lived in the Bronx.
[40:09.920 --> 40:14.920]  Gee, they're going to find out we took a couple million of that campaign money and I'm about to get it indicted.
[40:14.920 --> 40:19.920]  Gee, they're going to find out that I'm on methamphetamine and take Molly every day.
[40:19.920 --> 40:22.920]  Gee, they're going to find out.
[40:22.920 --> 40:24.920]  I mean, oh, she cares so much.
[40:24.920 --> 40:28.920]  She doesn't care about the 200,000 killed by drug gangs in Mexico the last decade.
[40:28.920 --> 40:33.920]  She doesn't care about 90% or 80% of the women being raped that come through Mexico to the U.S.,
[40:33.920 --> 40:35.920]  not by the U.S., but by the Mexicans.
[40:35.920 --> 40:40.920]  No, she's there to make you feel like crap.
[40:40.920 --> 40:43.920]  She's another Jesse Smollett.
[40:43.920 --> 40:46.920]  And that's not enough for them, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:46.920 --> 40:54.920]  The new A-line KERDI, remember the little boy taken by his supposed family across the Mediterranean in a storm?
[40:54.920 --> 40:59.920]  And then it tumped over and they showed his dead little body lying in the sand.
[40:59.920 --> 41:02.920]  And Europe was told, you've got to take more.
[41:02.920 --> 41:06.920]  So more came across and more kids got killed and all the free welfare and all the free goodies.
[41:06.920 --> 41:07.920]  It wasn't good enough.
[41:07.920 --> 41:13.920]  It was Europe's fault that the Muslims brought the little boy.
[41:13.920 --> 41:19.920]  Later, word came that he died on board the ship of sickness, but was placed for a photo op.
[41:19.920 --> 41:25.920]  Whatever really happened, we know they did photo ops with the dead boy and called media from all over.
[41:25.920 --> 41:29.920]  You see, the Muslims usually just strap bombs on three-year-olds.
[41:29.920 --> 41:33.920]  But there's other uses for them.
[41:33.920 --> 41:39.920]  Now continuing, but it's not in the parents' fault that brought them across the ocean on a Soros rubber boat.
[41:39.920 --> 41:41.920]  It's your fault.
[41:41.920 --> 41:43.920]  You did it, Spain.
[41:43.920 --> 41:45.920]  You did it, Italy.
[41:45.920 --> 41:46.920]  You did it, Greece.
[41:46.920 --> 41:47.920]  You did it, America.
[41:47.920 --> 41:49.920]  You did it, UK.
[41:49.920 --> 41:51.920]  You did it.
[41:51.920 --> 41:52.920]  It doesn't matter.
[41:52.920 --> 41:54.920]  You can't go to North Africa and be accepted there.
[41:54.920 --> 41:55.920]  You'll be killed in minutes.
[41:55.920 --> 41:56.920]  It doesn't matter.
[41:56.920 --> 41:58.920]  You can go to Somalia and they sell women as sex slaves.
[41:58.920 --> 42:04.920]  It doesn't matter because we're going to elect Ilhan incest Omar and see he's going to strut around saying,
[42:04.920 --> 42:08.920]  America sucks all day and pissing all over and we're going to bow down and go,
[42:08.920 --> 42:13.920]  yes, Ilhan, whatever you say, Ilhan, we're so sorry we're bad, Ilhan.
[42:13.920 --> 42:20.920]  So now we have the new photo of a supposed dead father and a dead child.
[42:20.920 --> 42:22.920]  Here, let's show everybody that photo.
[42:22.920 --> 42:27.920]  AP, grim border drowning under lines, peril facing many migrants.
[42:27.920 --> 42:29.920]  There's South Texas floods right now.
[42:29.920 --> 42:31.920]  And people come across and drown.
[42:31.920 --> 42:34.920]  Hell, the drug cartels shoot them and kill them by the thousands.
[42:34.920 --> 42:35.920]  But you never heard about that.
[42:35.920 --> 42:37.920]  It's look what we did.
[42:37.920 --> 42:39.920]  Look what white people did.
[42:39.920 --> 42:41.920]  Look what the gringos did.
[42:41.920 --> 42:43.920]  Look what the devils did.
[42:48.920 --> 42:53.920]  Hey, AOC, why don't you go to skin row, you little drug addict?
[42:53.920 --> 42:56.920]  You probably never leave so much molly, so much meth.
[42:56.920 --> 42:58.920]  You little mess whore.
[43:27.920 --> 43:29.920]  This is Kafkaesque.
[43:29.920 --> 43:30.920]  This is bizarre.
[43:30.920 --> 43:33.920]  But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say,
[43:33.920 --> 43:36.920]  Jones sent Kitty porn is really outrageous.
[43:36.920 --> 43:40.920]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted
[43:40.920 --> 43:42.920]  and corrected and clarified.
[43:42.920 --> 43:44.920]  But I went to where the big boys?
[43:44.920 --> 43:45.920]  Where's the Wall Street Journal?
[43:45.920 --> 43:46.920]  Where's Associated Press?
[43:46.920 --> 43:49.920]  When are they going to report that they made a mistake?
[43:49.920 --> 43:52.920]  And what they said about you was inaccurate.
[43:52.920 --> 43:58.920]  So we both need your help and I urge folks to continue to support Info Wars with your dollars.
[43:58.920 --> 44:01.920]  Well, we're very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[44:01.920 --> 44:06.920]  We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have
[44:06.920 --> 44:09.920]  through their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[44:09.920 --> 44:13.920]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months a year.
[44:13.920 --> 44:14.920]  We need to end here.
[44:14.920 --> 44:15.920]  We need to be provisioned.
[44:15.920 --> 44:19.920]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy.
[44:19.920 --> 44:23.920]  Fairlessly, I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[44:23.920 --> 44:25.920]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[44:25.920 --> 44:29.920]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[44:29.920 --> 44:30.920]  That just brings more people here.
[44:30.920 --> 44:32.920]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you.
[44:32.920 --> 44:33.920]  And I need war bonds.
[44:33.920 --> 44:34.920]  I need gas.
[44:34.920 --> 44:36.920]  I need ammo politically now.
[44:36.920 --> 44:40.920]  But literally, if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product purchases
[44:40.920 --> 44:42.920]  and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[44:42.920 --> 44:43.920]  We're unstoppable together.
[44:43.920 --> 44:45.920]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[44:45.920 --> 44:48.920]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that they're
[44:48.920 --> 44:52.920]  attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and I will never back down.
[44:52.920 --> 44:53.920]  You have my commitment.
[44:53.920 --> 44:56.920]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing
[44:56.920 --> 44:59.920]  and that we were right about this.
[44:59.920 --> 45:04.920]  Info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented
[45:04.920 --> 45:06.920]  attack the last year or so.
[45:06.920 --> 45:08.920]  It's Orwellian.
[45:08.920 --> 45:09.920]  It's biblical.
[45:09.920 --> 45:10.920]  It's authoritarian.
[45:10.920 --> 45:11.920]  It's insane.
[45:11.920 --> 45:17.920]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to stumble up on deck as
[45:17.920 --> 45:21.920]  the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking.
[45:21.920 --> 45:24.920]  I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat.
[45:24.920 --> 45:26.920]  But this is the real SOS.
[45:26.920 --> 45:29.920]  If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting,
[45:29.920 --> 45:32.920]  info wars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[45:32.920 --> 45:34.920]  And so we've reached that point.
[45:34.920 --> 45:35.920]  It'll make the enemy happy.
[45:35.920 --> 45:38.920]  But you know, whatever, we have withstood so many of their attacks.
[45:38.920 --> 45:40.920]  We've gone through so much because of your support.
[45:40.920 --> 45:42.920]  You have, you have been there.
[45:42.920 --> 45:44.920]  But let me tell you, they are pissed.
[45:44.920 --> 45:47.920]  They haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault.
[45:47.920 --> 45:51.920]  So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth.
[45:51.920 --> 45:54.920]  Now at info wars.com it's your fight.
[45:54.920 --> 46:20.920]  Decide whether or not you want info wars to continue because we could be shut down.
[46:20.920 --> 46:46.920]  It's the greatest show on earth at info wars.com for its last show.
[46:46.920 --> 46:51.920]  It's the greatest comedy show on earth, two nights only, 20 candidates and tons of laughs.
[46:51.920 --> 47:20.920]  June 26th and 27th, coverage starts at 7pm at info wars.com forward slash show.
[47:21.920 --> 47:32.920]  Trump just announced a social media summit on July 11th.
[47:32.920 --> 47:35.920]  We're going to be breaking it at info wars.com next hour.
[47:35.920 --> 47:37.920]  The specifics aren't out yet.
[47:37.920 --> 47:42.920]  We're getting the specifics for an article on info wars.com and news wars.com.
[47:42.920 --> 47:46.920]  But a social media summit to draw out the attention, beat the war drums,
[47:46.920 --> 47:49.920]  and hopefully get Google and Facebook and others to back down and stop.
[47:49.920 --> 47:51.920]  No, they've already done too much damage.
[47:51.920 --> 47:55.920]  They're already meddled and stole the house in the 2018 elections.
[47:55.920 --> 47:57.920]  Big article on info wars.com.
[47:57.920 --> 47:59.920]  Dealing with that and we're on the march.
[47:59.920 --> 48:02.920]  The empire is on the run.
[48:02.920 --> 48:04.920]  I'm going to start doing something.
[48:04.920 --> 48:05.920]  Some days I'll do nothing but calls.
[48:05.920 --> 48:07.920]  But usually I open the phones up.
[48:07.920 --> 48:08.920]  We've got 20 phone lines.
[48:08.920 --> 48:10.920]  They'll take an hour or two to get to all of them.
[48:10.920 --> 48:14.920]  So I'm going to take eight phone calls.
[48:14.920 --> 48:18.920]  I'm going to take eight phone calls starting in the first 30 minutes or so of the next hour.
[48:18.920 --> 48:22.920]  And then I've got Bob Barnes coming in with all the huge fall of Google.
[48:22.920 --> 48:24.920]  Their old censorship loan might open.
[48:24.920 --> 48:27.920]  This is some of the best news in a long time, believe me.
[48:27.920 --> 48:31.920]  Because if we don't stop what they're doing, they're going to steal the election, period.
[48:31.920 --> 48:35.920]  And they're going to block the populist, nationalist, capitalist,
[48:35.920 --> 48:38.920]  global realignment and reinsurgence taking place.
[48:38.920 --> 48:41.920]  So this is critical beyond critical beyond critical.
[48:41.920 --> 48:43.920]  This is not just a listener program.
[48:43.920 --> 48:51.920]  This is participation broadcast, restoring the republic and humanity to a good path with a decent future.
[48:51.920 --> 48:52.920]  And we can win.
[48:52.920 --> 48:53.920]  We're promoting liberty.
[48:53.920 --> 48:55.920]  It's a lot sexier than tyranny.
[48:55.920 --> 49:01.920]  But we've got to have a chance to put our ideas out on a level playing field or even a stilted playing field.
[49:01.920 --> 49:04.920]  But we've got to be allowed on the field.
[49:04.920 --> 49:05.920]  We'll climb the mountain.
[49:05.920 --> 49:06.920]  We'll take the machine gun now.
[49:06.920 --> 49:08.920]  But we've got to be allowed on the field.
[49:08.920 --> 49:10.920]  We've got to be putting the game.
[49:10.920 --> 49:11.920]  And Trump's got to do that.
[49:11.920 --> 49:12.920]  We've got to do that.
[49:12.920 --> 49:14.920]  So we're doing it.
[49:14.920 --> 49:16.920]  We've been hammering the hell out of this.
[49:16.920 --> 49:22.920]  We've paid a big price here, but we're going to lose everything if we don't pay a little to get a lot.
[49:22.920 --> 49:23.920]  Freedom isn't free.
[49:23.920 --> 49:27.920]  It's been said trillions of times accurately.
[49:27.920 --> 49:39.920]  I am so angry right now at AOC of the Democrats and how they will point at six kids have died this year coming across who die once they get in custody from all sorts of horrible diseases.
[49:39.920 --> 49:41.920]  They show up with a hundred to six fever.
[49:41.920 --> 49:46.920]  They die a few hours later and AOC goes to the floor to say the border patrol did it.
[49:46.920 --> 49:51.920]  No, the parents and the smugglers and the criminals and the people going across a hundred miles of desert.
[49:51.920 --> 49:55.920]  Sometimes from African countries that have gone through 11 nations.
[49:55.920 --> 49:58.920]  They did it, not me.
[49:58.920 --> 50:03.920]  And I'm sick of the less guilt tripping.
[50:03.920 --> 50:12.920]  CNN and AOC killed his father and his daughter that drowned trying to get into the U.S. during flash floods. Not a good time.
[50:12.920 --> 50:19.920]  You know, sometimes we have flash floods in Austin in one weekend and four or five people die.
[50:19.920 --> 50:22.920]  But you know, I remember I could swim really good when I was two years old.
[50:22.920 --> 50:32.920]  I remember some vague memories of it, but my dad told the stories and we'd be at a community pool or lake and people would say, hey, that's child endangerment.
[50:32.920 --> 50:35.920]  Don't let your kid swim is so little. Well, my son knows how to swim.
[50:35.920 --> 50:37.920]  But that's my dad's decision.
[50:37.920 --> 50:40.920]  What if he stuck me in the Rio Grande River during a flash flood?
[50:40.920 --> 50:42.920]  He'd lose me for child endangerment.
[50:42.920 --> 50:45.920]  Oh, but the illegal aliens do it. They're God.
[50:45.920 --> 50:53.920]  I'm sick of being blamed for things I haven't done.
[50:53.920 --> 51:13.920]  Now, we'll get more into all of this, but here's the toll free number to join us 877-789-ALIX 877-789-2539 on specifically AOC and her fancy outfit and her expensive watch down there at the border at an emergency camp where people are turning themselves in asking for all their free goody goods.
[51:13.920 --> 51:25.920]  And then because we're finding out who's who, who the children are, who rapists are, who's been arrested before, who's a murderer, just a basic screening, she's, oh, no.
[51:25.920 --> 51:30.920]  But when you fly into an airport from the foreign country, they ask you questions.
[51:30.920 --> 51:32.920]  And if you don't have your ID, you get shipped back.
[51:32.920 --> 51:35.920]  But see, she wants you to be guilty.
[51:35.920 --> 51:40.920]  No, I'm not guilty and quit bitching about the country all day and telling us how much it sucks.
[51:40.920 --> 51:46.920]  Now, the world's going to end in 11 years if we don't do whatever you say want to be cult leader.
[51:46.920 --> 51:51.920]  So I want your take on this and now them showing the photos of people that have drowned and saying it's our fault.
[51:51.920 --> 51:53.920]  There's water barriers to our country.
[51:53.920 --> 51:57.920]  You know, why do we ever have borders to begin with if they're so bad?
[51:57.920 --> 52:04.920]  The truth is the UN and the corporate global government is conquering us via leftist propaganda saying we don't have a right for nations to exist.
[52:04.920 --> 52:09.920]  And we've got to pay for everybody that comes along, including global carbon taxes.
[52:09.920 --> 52:13.920]  And this whole attack on the genders worldwide to confuse and break up the family.
[52:13.920 --> 52:16.920]  We are being weakened by design.
[52:16.920 --> 52:19.920]  We are being weakened on purpose.
[52:19.920 --> 52:24.920]  Here's that number again, that toll for number 877-789-2539.
[52:24.920 --> 52:27.920]  877-789 Alex.
[52:27.920 --> 52:30.920]  But I'm only going to take like the first eight calls that way nobody sits on hold.
[52:30.920 --> 52:32.920]  And then every time we take calls again, we'll open the phones up again.
[52:32.920 --> 52:38.920]  That's really the best way to do this because I say we only have 20 plus phone lines.
[52:38.920 --> 52:40.920]  You know, we can take thousands of calls.
[52:40.920 --> 52:45.920]  One time we had in one day 40 plus thousand calls during a show.
[52:45.920 --> 52:47.920]  That's how many hit the computer.
[52:47.920 --> 52:49.920]  I mean, even national shows beg for calls.
[52:49.920 --> 52:50.920]  We have amazing listeners.
[52:50.920 --> 52:51.920]  We love you to death.
[52:51.920 --> 52:53.920]  We're very appreciative of you.
[52:53.920 --> 52:56.920]  I don't want you to have to sit on hold.
[52:56.920 --> 52:58.920]  Okay.
[52:58.920 --> 53:07.920]  Again, after we take these calls, I'm going to open the phones up again on censorship
[53:07.920 --> 53:10.920]  and where you think this is going with Robert Barnes.
[53:10.920 --> 53:15.920]  We've got really serious news from Rand Paul saying that military confrontation with Iran
[53:15.920 --> 53:17.920]  more likely than diplomacy.
[53:17.920 --> 53:21.920]  That is horrible news, but it's good to know it so we can do something about it.
[53:21.920 --> 53:24.920]  This will easily start a much larger war.
[53:24.920 --> 53:26.920]  That's all coming up.
[53:26.920 --> 53:30.920]  2019 could be the year that a war with Iran changes everything.
[53:30.920 --> 53:33.920]  And two key deadlines loom within the next two weeks.
[53:33.920 --> 53:34.920]  We're going to be hitting that.
[53:34.920 --> 53:38.920]  Also, Middle East tensions move oil prices still even higher.
[53:38.920 --> 53:41.920]  That could kill the fragile recovery.
[53:41.920 --> 53:48.920]  We're also going to get into this latest rape accuser of Trump.
[53:48.920 --> 53:54.920]  Her story's fallen apart faster than a wet paper bag, you know, tornado.
[53:54.920 --> 53:59.920]  And it turns out she fetishizes rape in not one, not two, but three interviews.
[53:59.920 --> 54:06.920]  And that word for word, what she's saying is from a law and order script.
[54:06.920 --> 54:08.920]  That's right.
[54:08.920 --> 54:13.920]  That's the thing about the left is they're all, most of them are failed show business people.
[54:13.920 --> 54:17.920]  Nothing wrong with wanting to be in show business or, you know, having a degree in theater or whatever.
[54:17.920 --> 54:18.920]  Rob Do's got one.
[54:18.920 --> 54:19.920]  Does a great job.
[54:19.920 --> 54:21.920]  But he's not a leftist.
[54:21.920 --> 54:23.920]  The leftists are all these failed people.
[54:23.920 --> 54:28.920]  And nine times out of 10, when they're lying about you, they've written a script before about it
[54:28.920 --> 54:31.920]  and they have this dream to make their fantasies real.
[54:31.920 --> 54:36.920]  And so they think that they're journalists so they can really be fiction writers.
[54:36.920 --> 54:38.920]  Like to show homeland.
[54:38.920 --> 54:40.920]  They're attacking me according to the homeland script.
[54:40.920 --> 54:47.920]  They believe I'm the homeland character and they believe that I'll be taken down like him and then put in prison.
[54:47.920 --> 54:49.920]  And when I'm around the New York Times or others, they shake.
[54:49.920 --> 54:51.920]  They go, what's up?
[54:51.920 --> 54:52.920]  I had a New York Times lady here.
[54:52.920 --> 54:53.920]  She lied about why she was here.
[54:53.920 --> 54:54.920]  I let her in.
[54:54.920 --> 54:56.920]  And then her Uber was coming her car.
[54:56.920 --> 54:58.920]  And for like 20 minutes, it wasn't there.
[54:58.920 --> 55:01.920]  So I was looking at computer screens that show cameras that weren't pulled up.
[55:01.920 --> 55:05.920]  So I was being nice to her, gave her a cup of coffee or whatever.
[55:05.920 --> 55:06.920]  She's leaving.
[55:06.920 --> 55:09.920]  This is like eight, nine months ago.
[55:09.920 --> 55:11.920]  It was Elizabeth something.
[55:11.920 --> 55:14.920]  And we've got TV monitors.
[55:14.920 --> 55:16.920]  We can see and I'm looking.
[55:16.920 --> 55:19.920]  She wrote that I was shaking in fear and thought people were coming to get me.
[55:19.920 --> 55:21.920]  And no lady, I'm a Texan.
[55:21.920 --> 55:24.920]  I was there at the door and you kept saying your car was coming.
[55:24.920 --> 55:25.920]  You didn't know where.
[55:25.920 --> 55:29.920]  So I was looking at security cameras to know where in the big parking lot or in
[55:29.920 --> 55:31.920]  what side of the building they showed up at.
[55:31.920 --> 55:36.920]  But see, so typically what she said is true in her article that Jones kept looking
[55:36.920 --> 55:39.920]  at the computer screens concerned.
[55:39.920 --> 55:41.920]  No, I wasn't concerned, lady.
[55:41.920 --> 55:43.920]  You're like, okay, my car is here.
[55:43.920 --> 55:44.920]  Where do I go out?
[55:44.920 --> 55:47.920]  I'm like, well, which side of the building is it pulling up on?
[55:47.920 --> 55:49.920]  Let's go over here to the security screen.
[55:49.920 --> 55:53.920]  We walk over to security area, walk across the building.
[55:53.920 --> 55:55.920]  Security guys sitting there.
[55:55.920 --> 55:57.920]  I'll lean over and go, you see any cars?
[55:57.920 --> 55:58.920]  No.
[55:58.920 --> 56:00.920]  Okay, well, see you later.
[56:00.920 --> 56:02.920]  Come back 10 minutes later.
[56:02.920 --> 56:03.920]  She's not gone yet.
[56:03.920 --> 56:05.920]  So I'll look at the screen again.
[56:05.920 --> 56:10.920]  That turns into I'm scared looking at computer screens all day, shaking in fear.
[56:10.920 --> 56:11.920]  No, lady.
[56:11.920 --> 56:14.920]  I march out to Beto or Rourke crowds and get in the middle of them when they try to
[56:14.920 --> 56:15.920]  kill me.
[56:15.920 --> 56:17.920]  I go out in public without security everywhere.
[56:17.920 --> 56:21.920]  I do all this stuff and you try to turn me into a coward like you.
[56:21.920 --> 56:23.920]  Again, that's their alchemy.
[56:23.920 --> 56:24.920]  That's their fraud.
[56:24.920 --> 56:25.920]  That's their scam.
[56:25.920 --> 56:29.920]  Now, it'd be like saying if someone walked up to security camera outside of our
[56:29.920 --> 56:33.920]  office and held up child porn, the news would then say that we were distributing
[56:33.920 --> 56:34.920]  child porn.
[56:34.920 --> 56:37.920]  You see, or someone mailed me child porn, they'd say that.
[56:37.920 --> 56:39.920]  In fact, they've done that.
[56:39.920 --> 56:41.920]  That's who these people are.
[56:41.920 --> 56:46.920]  And when you experience their pure lying, you realize it's another level.
[56:46.920 --> 56:47.920]  We're going to break.
[56:47.920 --> 56:48.920]  Please don't forget.
[56:48.920 --> 56:50.920]  We come right back with your phone calls.
[56:50.920 --> 56:52.920]  Being a limited edition clown world.

[56:59.920 --> 57:02.920]  big clown info wars.com on the back.

[57:05.920 --> 57:11.920]  It's like a concert t-shirt where you've got all the idiot clowns of the two nights.

[57:33.920 --> 57:34.920]  The left says don't call them clowns.
[57:34.920 --> 57:36.920]  Well, they act like clowns.
[57:36.920 --> 57:37.920]  They are clowns.
[57:37.920 --> 57:38.920]  Criminal clowns.

[57:58.920 --> 57:59.920]  Yay!
[57:59.920 --> 58:02.920]  It's Clown World 2019.
[58:02.920 --> 58:07.920]  The Democratic Party's two night extravaganza debate.
[58:07.920 --> 58:09.920]  Let's meet the candidates.
[58:09.920 --> 58:11.920]  All-Star Beto Root.
[58:11.920 --> 58:13.920]  Oh my gosh, Cory Booker.
[58:13.920 --> 58:15.920]  The amazing.
[58:15.920 --> 58:18.920]  Honest Joe Biden.
[58:18.920 --> 58:20.920]  Swallows Well System.
[58:20.920 --> 58:21.920]  New gun owners.
[58:21.920 --> 58:22.920]  Yay!
[58:22.920 --> 58:23.920]  Bernie Sanders.
[58:23.920 --> 58:25.920]  Love for Sonya Yuga.
[58:25.920 --> 58:26.920]  Camila Harris.
[58:26.920 --> 58:28.920]  And so many more.
[58:28.920 --> 58:31.920]  It's the greatest show on earth at infowars.com.
[58:31.920 --> 58:34.920]  We'll see you Thursday night.
[58:34.920 --> 58:36.920]  The greatest comedy show on earth.
[58:36.920 --> 58:37.920]  Two nights only.
[58:37.920 --> 58:40.920]  20 candidates and tons of laughs.
[58:40.920 --> 58:42.920]  June 26th and 27th.
[58:42.920 --> 58:48.920]  Coverage starts at 7 p.m. at infowars.com forward slash show.
[59:12.920 --> 59:16.920]  Self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little de-democratic structure.
[59:16.920 --> 59:19.920]  That because the audience determines what content goes up,
[59:19.920 --> 59:24.920]  the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting infowars.
[59:24.920 --> 59:26.920]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is,
[59:26.920 --> 59:30.920]  whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want
[59:30.920 --> 59:33.920]  that actually compete with the corporate driven model.
[59:33.920 --> 59:37.920]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech,
[59:37.920 --> 59:41.920]  support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[59:41.920 --> 59:45.920]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment.
[59:45.920 --> 59:49.920]  And it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[59:52.920 --> 59:55.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:55.920 --> 01:00:00.920]  All right, we're now into hour number two.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:06.920]  And if you didn't hear the news, all hell's broken loose after Google ran its big fat mouth.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.920]  And coming up, we're going to have Robert Barnes in studio.
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.920]  Trump has announced a major summit July 11th.
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.920]  That's only in July 11th.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:29.920]  That's only in two weeks or so to really take these guys to the woodshed.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920]  So we're fighting back.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.920]  It's a beautiful thing, but recapping AOC has done it again.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:41.920]  She went down to one of the emergency centers on the Texas border yesterday where we have just massive,
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:48.920]  massive numbers of up to 15,000 people a day overwhelming the election law,
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:59.920]  the laws dealing with the border laws, the immigration laws, all state that we had to basically let these people in.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:04.920]  And now you've got New York legalizing illegal aliens and other states getting a driver's license
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.920]  and other states saying they're illegal aliens vote.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.920]  You see the plan here.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:14.920]  No other country would put up with this except Europe and Europe's having the same U.N. program run against it.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.920]  Borders are such a bad idea.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:17.920]  Why do countries always have them?
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.920]  Because you don't have a nation.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.920]  You don't have your own system.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.920]  You don't have your own stuff.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:21.920]  You don't have a border.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:26.920]  It's like having a door on your house or clothing on your back.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.920]  So from all over the world, the people are coming.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:35.920]  She goes down there and cries and says, oh, they're all victims in a concentration camp.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.920]  And it really blew up in her face.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:45.920]  She's in a designer clothing designer watch all out there for PR about how much she cares now horrible.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:53.920]  It is like Trump standing above the little Hispanic girl whose mother had smuggled her into the country three times before using her as a human shield.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:55.920]  Her father said that her mother's a criminal.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.920]  She'd be in jail that she uses the daughter as a smuggling tool.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:05.920]  Bringing your little three year old through drug cartels and festivals.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:06.920]  No, no, no.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:07.920]  America's bad.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:17.920]  Let's Photoshop Trump standing above the little girl and say he hurt her because she was taken from mommy and she wasn't taken from mommy.
[01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:18.920]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.920]  It's not true.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.920]  Let's go ahead and go to Johnny in Wyoming than John in Wyoming.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:26.920]  Johnny, you're on the air.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.920]  Go ahead.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:35.920]  I used to work in Washington, D.C. on Trump's new hotel.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.920]  And I met this guy named Carlos back in 2014.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:42.920]  He was one of my guys that worked with him every morning, every day, every evening.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:47.920]  And he was forced into being a coyote down on the border.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.920]  He's Mexican dude, but all American now.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:03:01.920]  And he told me that there are mosques and Islam all over Mexico and that it's like merging with the Santeria down there.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.920]  You've mentioned this on your site before.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.920]  And I mean, he said it's completely out of control.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:15.920]  And then I, you know, I served in Iraq and I'm going to college now using my GI bill and there's just Islam everywhere.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:21.920]  I mean, you can't go on on a date without a, with a group of girls without one of the dudes being a Muslim that she's dating.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.920]  Well, you can't, I mean, there's like one in every class.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:30.920]  So you can't even have a discussion about like, well, that's the thing is we're supposed to comply with the most radical forms of Islam.
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:37.920]  People don't get, there's 1.8 billion Muslims and their culture is coming to your country and conquer you.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.920]  And they're about to be 3 billion.
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.920]  And that's why the corporate world is saying you will submit to Islam and you're right.
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.920]  Mexico is just chop full.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:04:00.920]  When we sent people down into Mexico to Tijuana in California and in Texas in Brownsville, a good third of the women coming across are Islamic women wearing hijabs from Mexico.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.920]  So you're absolutely right.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.920]  It is metastasizing.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:04.920]  Yeah.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:08.920]  And another thing about the, about the homosexuality.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:14.920]  Constantinople fell because towards the end of the Eastern Roman Empire, I'm a history major.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:18.920]  Towards the end of the Eastern Roman Empire, they had adopted a lot of the Eastern culture.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:22.920]  The Greeks had this problem when they colonized the same area.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:25.920]  Their, their people adopted far too to the East.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:28.920]  They started, they started turning their boys into eunuchs.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:32.920]  They started putting their girls into these all girl classes where they would train.
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:45.920]  Hold on. Stay there. They know how civilizations fall. Stay there. You're right. And even the famous professors of history that are lesbians like Camille Paglia will explain this always happens for the fall of civilization.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:50.920]  And so why is Hollywood trying to speed this along? They're doing it by design.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:05:03.920]  They want the West to be destroyed and usurped by inferior culture serving with info wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:16.920]  And luckily our break room at the info wars headquarters is stock full of high quality info war store, patriot blend coffee grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico.

[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:27.920]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:34.920]  Robert Barnes is going to be in studio coming up a little bit later in the hour with the ultra massive announcements by Trump.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:41.920]  Two big ones on the fact that he's getting ready to go after them for their attacks on the First Amendment.
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:49.920]  This is a very exciting time to be alive. Thank you for joining us. Thank you for all the AM and FM affiliates, TV affiliates, the listeners and supporters.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.920]  You are incredible.
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:57.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's get right into your phone calls again.
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:06.920]  The articles are up on info wars.com, but you've been bombarded with it everywhere. AOC goes to a camp, an emergency camp where people pour in.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:08.920]  They turn themselves in.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:14.920]  They get basic medical care, but not major testing that should be happening because the border patrol is overwhelmed.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:21.920]  It's four times any previous record. It was double the record a year ago. The globalists are rushing the border.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:31.920]  And AOC goes down there and she cries and she collapses and just look at the people who illegally came here, turned themselves in,
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:37.920]  getting ready to be turned loose with money in their pocket, the horror.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:46.920]  But Trump is screening that children not be trafficked as Obama did not do that and up to one third were sex trafficked and one third were not with their parents.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:08:02.920]  That's Senate report, Washington Post even admits that. So AOC is at the border crying over the fact that child smugglers aren't able to feed on the children and the coyotes might get in trouble.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:05.920]  Now, we were going back to Johnny, then we'll go to John and Wyoming.
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:25.920]  Johnny was getting into Constantinople in the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire hundreds and hundreds of years after the fall of the original Western Roman Empire with the sacking of Rome in 410 by Alaric.
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:39.920]  But go forward, what a thousand years and you have the sacking by the Muslims in their giant expansion of Constantinople, which is now Istanbul.
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:44.920]  So go ahead and make your point about studying that history.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:49.920]  Yes, Istanbul is kind of one of their new capital cities.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:09:02.920]  Islam, whenever Islam moves into an area, it's Islam, but it's Islam grafted on to or the other society, depending on on what they like or what they don't like grafted a little on to Islam.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:14.920]  For instance, you know, Spain, the Iberian Moors, you know, very artistic people, excellent warriors took 700 years to get them out.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:21.920]  But in Istanbul, it was kind of like part Arab, part Han.
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:30.920]  And when the Arabs came in again, they were kind of tired of the Roman Empire and everything just kind of shifted over.
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:38.920]  And some of the parts it was as low as 10%, like you talk about it, it doesn't take a lot of these guys to completely take over.
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:45.920]  And it's because they fully work together that that's 3% a rule, you know, that 3% nation, 3% militia.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:52.920]  All it takes is 3% of a society to fight and then you can you can win and supposedly declare your independence.
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:10:02.920]  Well, that rule has the inverse value where if 3% of your countrymen are fighting against you, well, that's a problem.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:14.920]  And they are like our teachers and it really bothers me that the Jewish groups on the campus are so complicit with all of this and kind of just go along with it.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:23.920]  I took this Israel-Palestine history class and for four and a half months, the whole class was what's wrong with Israel and Palestine.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.920]  And at the end of the class, the answer was America and Britain.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:38.920]  Never Islam, never smashing together all these different cultures, not anything but just Britain and America.
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:48.920]  No, exactly, but let's go further. You've got the leftist Jews who were being immigrated to Europe and the United States and some of them weren't allowed in World War I or World War II.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.920]  So it's almost like, well, we were immigrants, so it's our job to bring in immigrants now.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:59.920]  We were immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East that literally would suicide bomb them in a second and it's just disgusting.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:11.920]  And literally, I was on Islamaharas a few months ago, a little island off the coast of Mexico, and we stayed at a hotel and they had a gay wedding.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:18.920]  And there was a bunch of Muslims staying there and I would watch the gay men come up and grovel to the Muslim men and women.
[01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:22.920]  And the Muslim men and women would not even talk to them and would talk trash to their face.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.920]  And the gay guys would grovel because to them, this was God.
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:36.920]  I mean, this was a group of folks that would throw them off a cliff and when they saw God, it was like, oh my God, I've been told that jibwearing women and men, this is God.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:47.920]  And so the gay guys were just, but they looked down the gay guys and, you know, my daughter's having fun or jumping in the pool or, you know, me sitting there with hair on my chest and, you know, potbelly drinking a beer.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.920]  Because I was, you know, I was an American, they've been taught that the gay guys are like, oh, that's an American with a Texas accent.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:12:00.920]  But boy, these gay guys from America, I mean, they were just sycophantically worshiping the Muslims.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.920]  And I just, I told my wife, I said, it wasn't that they were gay, I couldn't be around.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:12.920]  It was the fact that the sycophantic virtue signaling to the Muslims, it was just, it was very interesting to watch.
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:27.920]  I think that they have, and they don't say it out loud because, you know, I used to read a lot of Tom Clancy novels and stuff when I was growing up and I thought I was going to join the army and be involved in this big giant conspiracy.
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.920]  And then somebody handed me a thumb stick with one of your podcasts.
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:38.920]  The next thing I know, I'm being taught by an Egyptian Muslim guy that England and America are Israel and Palestine's problem.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:44.920]  And it's, it's like, it's just, I mean, that's it. We've been undermined by the globalists from within. They're trying to take the country down.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:51.920]  We are in, we are in shambles and Trump's trying to fix things and we've just got to push forward. God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:13:02.920]  Think about AOC at the border where people fight and pay thousands of dollars to come here from the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, many of them kidnap kids to get into the country.
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:10.920]  And she's there showing them being processed and released, crying and bitching. I mean, this is just pathetic.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:15.920]  And the media willingly goes along with the hoax and they had huge floods down there.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:23.920]  And so a father and daughter come in across a river died and it's America's fault that he went into a raging river with his daughter.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:34.920]  America is bad. Don't go to newswords.com. Don't tune in tonight at seven o'clock central for our clown world coverage on our own audio and our own video feeds.
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:43.920]  Don't tune into local stations that pick it up. Don't you dare tune into our two night coverage of the democratic debates with our reporters live on the ground in Miami.
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:52.920]  No, don't do that. Tune in to CNN and do what they say. John in Wyoming, another John from Wyoming. Thanks for holding it on the air. Thank you.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:14:02.920]  Alex, it's been a long time, but I've got all kinds of great news. First of all, AOC stands for another ordinary communist.
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:10.920]  So remember that. And the gentleman who just called in a while ago, I can give him a little further information.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:27.920]  His mother was a little girl, was a five year old girl in 1915 living in Constantinople and she and her older brother and their father and their mother who was expecting her third child had to leave and come to America because the
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:43.920]  Turkish Muslims were busy slaughtering a third of a million Greeks and one and a half million Armenians because the Greeks and Armenians were Christians. That's one reason that Constantinople fell and it became Istanbul later in 1930.
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.920]  But they came to this country because of the Holocaust created by the Turkish Muslim.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:58.920]  But wait a minute. I mean, the Muslims, everybody knows they expanded and went all the way into Poland and killed millions of Christians. We deserve it. It's liberal. Let me ask you a question.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:02.920]  Why does the left have a fetish with expansionist Islam?
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:20.920]  Well, probably because they're both evil and, you know, they run in circles. But the good news I have from you from Sheridan, we finally got rid of the fluoride in our drinking water. Last month at the city council meeting, they read the results of the survey that was taken
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:32.920]  among the people of the city and nearby county and we voted to get rid of the fluoride from our water. The vote was 2323.
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:41.920]  Stay there, John. You're awesome. By the way, I've been saying for 10 years, I'm going to start a show with callers. We're setting the date, not this Saturday, but next Saturday, two hours.
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:51.920]  It's going to be Saturday afternoon at noon, two hours, and we're going to have this guy on with us on our maiden voyage if he can do it and some of the other callers as well.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:16:20.920]  We'll be right back with John, then Sean, then Pete, then Will, then Robert Barnes.
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:35.920]  OK.

[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:19.360]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is

[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:50.520]  The greatest comedy show on earth, two nights only, 20 candidates and tons of laughs, June
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:58.920]  26th and 27th, coverage starts at 7pm at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:02.840]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square,
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:07.240]  the other thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:11.080]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.360]  by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government, it is completely
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.360]  independent of all that.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:22.160]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.000]  and freedom of speech, that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.320]  the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.920]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:37.760]  where they've mostly been blocked by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:41.880]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:45.960]  have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:50.720]  The they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy
[01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:54.640]  and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:01.040]  defamation, lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:22.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show from the front lines of the information war, it's

[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.520]  Alex Jones your host, Robert Barnes is coming in next segment, we'll continue with some
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:42.880]  of the calls that are there but Trump's made two huge announcements, one yesterday, one
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:50.600]  just came out 20 minutes ago, a story's going up on infowarstore.com as we speak.
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:56.560]  Trump is announcing a major summit to prepare battle plans against big tech.
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:01.240]  This is the best news we've gotten in a long time.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.720]  Going back to John in Wyoming, John making some great points, John's been calling in
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:08.640]  for 20 years, he only gets in like once or twice a year, it's always good to hear his
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:11.920]  voice, John please continue.
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:18.440]  Thank you Alex, what happened is they read the survey results and we defeated the fluoride
[01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:26.880]  freaks 2323 votes against fluoride versus 1900 for it and one of the city council members
[01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:34.680]  was kind enough to put in a request into their final tally that the fluoride ceased within
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:45.040]  24 hours so as of 1300 hours or 1pm Tuesday May 7th the fluoride was turned off in Sheridan
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:48.640]  Wyoming and we're getting clean water again.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:55.360]  Now, one of the things that you have to remember where we really hurt them is I read this wonderful
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:02.360]  article, it was published by Harley Manson April 5th, 2018 in Health and Wellness magazine
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:07.200]  and he was quoting the Lancet Neurology which is part of the Lancet Medical Journal, the
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:15.120]  most prestigious medical journal in the world, Volume 13, Issue 3 from March of 2014 where
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:23.800]  the Lancet Neurology classed fluoride as a neurotoxin 100% which puts it in the same
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:28.040]  category as lead, arsenic and mercury.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:33.520]  So the people woke up and they said enough of this garbage, we're tired of skin rashes
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:39.520]  and all kinds of illnesses caused by this fluoride and they got it out of there despite
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:45.600]  the fact that the local dentist and hygienist heavily funded this one corrupt former city
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:52.360]  official who got the fluoride implemented a few years ago and despite all of the heavy
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:57.800]  funding on their side we still prevailed so I want your listeners to remember it.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:04.680]  Number one, yes you can fight city hall and occasionally you can win that battle.
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:09.320]  You're not going to win them all just like we don't win every election but you can fight
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:14.880]  city hall and you can come up with a win every now and then to help all the people.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:21.400]  I don't care if it's liberals or conservatives, I don't want anyone drinking toxic waste
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:29.160]  fluorosilic acid in their drinking water because it will thicken them and eventually kill them.
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:33.960]  So I don't care what the dentists say because remember the American Dental Association has
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:40.560]  been heavily funded by the fluoride industry for decades and all of these dental colleges
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:43.760]  are heavily funded by the fluoride industry.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:47.640]  So what do you expect them to say that oh yeah it's wonderful.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:52.200]  They even had a guy from the Centers for Disease Controls Skyping.
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:58.000]  This was back in 2010 Skyping to our corrupt mayor and city council.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.640]  Well sir listen I got to move on John we're going to have you on as a guest soon but I'm
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:07.560]  familiar with your work way back to the Republican Party in the 80s and yes Harvard a few years
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:16.680]  ago looked at 25 studies and concluded that fluoride in the water at one point at zero
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:23.520]  parts per million one point three causes a 10 point IQ reduction in youth that drink
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:30.520]  it for only two years causes massive bone cancer increases causes massive leukemia problems.
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:37.480]  This is all fact and again the Soviets would put it in the water in their in their reeducation
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:42.640]  camps to control people at a higher level the Nazis got it from them and that's Ian
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.840]  pull it surprise winning books on World War two and so when they put it in the water and
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:51.280]  all the quote crazies in the 50s said this is crazy don't do it it turns out it was all
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:57.400]  real and the US IQ has dropped massively cancer has exploded and it was just the beginning
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:02.240]  of them poisoning us so great points I appreciate your call and yes ladies and gentlemen they
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:08.280]  don't just take regular fluoride that's calcium fluoride that you do need some of your body
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:14.840]  very small amount they take hydrofluorosalic acid that is an adjuvant to other toxins it
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:21.720]  makes them even more toxic it soups everything up in turbocharges or supercharges everything
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:26.960]  it's amazing and they take a bunch of toxic waste from the US or China and they dump that
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:30.840]  in the water it's not just the fluoride and this is where they get rid of the toxic wases
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:37.160]  in our drinking water as a sick sick joke now as fluoride treatments on the teeth useful
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.960]  yes if you get it all out most of it out of your mouth it's still toxic but it does help
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:46.920]  your teeth but you don't drink sunscreen so that you don't get a sunburn let's take another
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:55.560]  call here let's go ahead and talk to Sean in Texas you're on the air thanks for holding
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:00.800]  hello hey welcome thanks for calling oh hi Alex I just want to say it's a huge honor
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:05.320]  being able to talk to you I mean like in my eyes you're a huge celebrity well I appreciate
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:10.120]  you sir I'm just trying to beat these globalists I know I'm trying to beat them too but I'm
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:14.640]  only 15 years old and there's not much a 15 year old can do that sir a 15 year old could
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:19.040]  incinerate the enemy politically you could put flyers up all over your town on power
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:24.760]  poles saying Alex Jones did nothing wrong info wars dot com vaccines kill info wars
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:30.120]  dot com then you call the media about it they'll come out and cover it like it's bad and then
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.360]  everybody in the town will see it if everybody did that in every town in the US we bring them
[01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:40.840]  to their knees oh heck yeah I might just have to do that and I'm about the border I mean
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:46.880]  what I was watching the David night show this morning and I saw and you know kids are being
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:50.320]  trafficked from the boring and they're being brought here as things they're not children
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:55.440]  they're things they're objects they're a tool or something you can play with and not care
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:01.960]  about these people exactly in the AOC flips the script continually goes down to emergency
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:06.680]  centers where people are turning themselves in saying give me food give me medicine and
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:10.560]  we don't even have the personnel to give them medicine because the Democrats wouldn't pass
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:18.480]  the bill for the 12 billion like Trump asked for it's incredible oh yeah it is and she's
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:22.280]  going down there crying and I mean these people are putting themselves in the situation and
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:27.680]  then they're getting thrown out into our our country as by here here's a bunch of money
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:32.640]  go do whatever you want exactly more here's an analogy let's say you got a small backyard
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:37.280]  you got enough groceries for you and your kids for a week 50 people show up your backyard
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:42.480]  they're demanding free stuff and then AOC comes and looks over the fence and goes look at them
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:47.360]  poor babies the people in the house aren't giving them enough Americans have got to give
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:52.800]  everybody free stuff those dirty bad Americans meanwhile Mexico lets these people go over

[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:41.920]  it complies with the constitution of the united states and roe v wade and its project the

[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:24.440]  that we're seeing in recent years on planned parenthood in particular and on abortion rights
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:29.960]  in general i think what we can do and must do is find candidates in every state in this
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:34.560]  country and every congressional district in this country who do support absolutely a
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:40.640]  woman's right to control her own body reverend children's of black genocide dot org asks
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:45.240]  planned parenthood is the largest abortion provider in america seventy eight percent
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:51.160]  of their clinics are in minority communities blacks make up twelve percent of the population
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:56.960]  but thirty five percent of the abortions in america are we being targeted isn't that
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:03.440]  genocide we are the only minority in america that is on the decline in population if the
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:09.640]  current trend continues by twenty thirty eight the black vote will be insignificant but by
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:15.800]  twenty thirty eight if the trend continues democrats will have allowed enough illegal
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:21.960]  immigrants into the united states to have no need for legal minority citizens after the
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:27.880]  republican party itself has become insignificant john bound reporting
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:48.680]  just want to stake this again because i don't like talking about myself every day on the
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:52.520]  show and what's happening but we're forced to because as you've seen we're national
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:57.840]  news international news if they can take us down they set the precedent to take every
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:03.160]  one else down media matters run by george soros the admitted nazi collaborator he said
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:07.760]  that on sixty minutes the news says that's a conspiracy theory my understanding is that

[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:52.320]  content take them down and youtube did i mean when when when when media matters snaps its

[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:29.040]  in a way that they don't favor my company first yeah i i i think it's a very good question
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:32.640]  and look i mean let's be honest these tech companies facebook google twitter they have
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:37.440]  gotten huge they have gotten powerful they have gotten rich on the backs of this special
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:41.320]  immunity that they get from the federal government on the back of what's called section two thirty
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:46.200]  and i think it's time we ask some hard questions their monopolies now they're very powerful
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:50.240]  they appear to be using their power to try and shut down political viewpoints that they
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:55.680]  don't agree with usually conservative and it says every copycat channel listed has been

[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:45.440]  about not having jobs and the rust belt you know all the really evil stuff i talk about
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:43:02.400]  what a comedy of erish
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:17.760]  or
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:47.480]  The greatest comedy show on earth two nights only 20 candidates and
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:56.560]  tons of laughs June 26th and 27th coverage starts at 7 p.m. at info wars.com forward slash show
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:44:02.120]  in the 40 years that I've been in American politics I've never seen a situation with the
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:08.800]  mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters the false claim that
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:16.440]  you purposely said kitty porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false it's
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:21.720]  a smear somebody sends you something that's encrypted you don't even open it it ends up
[01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:26.780]  swept up in the discovery of nine million documents and then it's blamed on you this is
[01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:32.920]  Kafka esque this is bizarre but the way the mainstream media rushes out to say jones set
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:37.840]  kitty porn is really outrageous I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:42.320]  commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified but I went to where the big boys
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:47.360]  where's the wall street journal where's associated press when are they going to report that they
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:52.940]  made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate so we both need your help and I urge
[01:44:52.940 --> 01:45:04.840]  folks to continue to support info wars with your dollars so the info wars model is a self
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:10.000]  fulfilling self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.800]  getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another it is the only independent
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:19.960]  press of this size and scale of this public reach it is the one model that says here's
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:25.280]  a way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured little d democratic structure
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:29.640]  that because the audience determines what content goes up the audience determines what
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.880]  audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars and it's all because
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:37.960]  the audience spends there whatever it is whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars a month on
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:41.640]  products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:46.520]  model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press support speech support
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:50.720]  letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:55.460]  and it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration
[01:45:55.460 --> 01:45:57.800]  of free press and free speech with free markets.
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:02.480]  Well they're very very clear with everybody about all of this we're going into the season
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:06.960]  of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have do their
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:11.440]  criminal activity and their and their digital fraud and we need to know that we've got capital
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:16.080]  to go six months a year we need to end here we need to be provisioned and you've got my
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:20.440]  total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly I'm loving
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:24.760]  every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin I'm bloody and then I'm up
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:29.120]  politically I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:33.280]  not just rings more people here so I'm in one hell of a fight so are you and I need war
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:38.880]  bonds I need gas I need ammo politically now but literally if you flood us with money and
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:42.240]  if you flood us with product purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth you're
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:45.680]  unstoppable we're unstoppable together I want to send a strong message to the enemy I want
[01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:49.280]  to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:53.520]  failing and that you will stand with us and I will never back down you have my commitment
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:57.400]  this only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:24.200]  about this you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:29.400]  what she does to our country she's suing all our companies you know look we should be suing
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:34.760]  google and facebook and all that which perhaps we will okay but you see all apple they're
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:39.960]  suing apple for billions of dollars they're suing everybody they make it very almost
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:45.320]  impossible to do two-way business yeah so what happened I said folks they are worse
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:50.320]  than china except smaller it's smaller than china but they're worse than china the barriers
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:55.120]  they put up for our farmers are because they want to protect their farmers yeah they have
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:58.600]  a lot of farmers you know those farmers are what you drive down the country road you see
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:02.800]  the beautiful farms all over the place I don't even say they're wrong but it's not fair to
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:08.920]  us this they send in mercedes-benz they send in bmw they pay virtually no tax right they
[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:15.560]  take nothing we give them it's so one-sided and they make approximately 180 billion dollars
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:38.360]  a year for years I gotta get to technology and also the board of crisis well trumps making
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:45.160]  it a major part of its 2020 reelection bid that's the massive sustained criminal surveillance
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:54.160]  the censorship the foreign governments controlling facebook twitter apple google particularly it's
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:49:00.200]  huge the white house is hosting a social media summit as trump bashes tech companies again
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:06.360]  oh really well we have all the video of their top censorship person at youtube and google
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:10.560]  admitting that we're gonna let trump be reelected white house plans to social media summit as
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:16.840]  congress raises questions trump lashes out of unknown groups now it's not on groups it's
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:21.880]  the globalists that are doing all of this the article is up on info wars dot com and
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:28.240]  news wars dot com right now recapping a constitutional lawyer robert barnes who has been suing these
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:32.240]  companies and is going to follow some big suits very soon the president's basically called
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:35.560]  for it in the video we just played but the justice department's going to be doing it
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:42.360]  as well i mean big tech has really run away with the bait here oh no doubt and i mean
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:47.000]  basically it started with the meeting between the president jack on twitter then an accelerated
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  into the announcement of the leaked announcement of the department of justice was conducting
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.760]  antitrust investigations that was followed up with the ftc announcing it was launching
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:01.120]  its own antitrust and consumer protection investigations that was then followed up by
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:04.880]  the disclosure that next week 20 different state attorney generals are going to be meeting
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:11.440]  in Omaha nebraska to coordinate a state attorney generals using state laws their own every state
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:16.280]  has its own antitrust laws has its own consumer protection laws authorizes attorney generals
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:20.960]  to take action so that each of those states is going to be taking action as well so they're
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:24.040]  going to be coordinating that and then you know 10 days later the white house is going
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:28.080]  to have a summit to deal with this while there's two different acts of pending legislation
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:33.920]  between by senator holly one would remove section 230 immunity and say they the big
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:39.480]  tech no longer is immune from defamation claims or libel claims or facilitating and aiding
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:43.600]  and abetting terrorism or legal immigration or other criminal activities on their platforms
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:48.320]  unless they agree to protect free speech in addition the other legislative proposal that
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:53.320]  senator holly has made is to require for the first time big tech to tell the world just
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:59.400]  how much they are getting economically and monetizing people's private individual information
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:03.760]  so they're using that in information in order to gather intel on individuals they then monetize
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:07.960]  that by selling it to advertisers who want specific information about you that could
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:11.960]  not be disclosed except for big tech getting it through the way in which big tech induces
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:16.120]  people to subscribe to their services and then they use that as their monetary basis
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:20.800]  of operation which is significant for antitrust purposes because if they're not really offering
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:25.640]  a free service but are instead exchanging that service for information that they then
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:30.760]  in turn monetize then that is a subscription based service just indirectly done and that
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:36.720]  creates legal liability under potential antitrust claims or giant data net data mining organizations
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:41.160]  that openly brag that they can fix elections and control people and they're working with
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:45.320]  authoritarian states from China to the EU but refused to work with the US government
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:50.600]  and the Pentagon in any way well exactly I mean they were there the ultimate surveillance
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:55.240]  technique so they're for the surveillance state to intrude and impose on people's privacy
[01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:58.520]  but the precondition of their relationship with the government was always that they were
[01:51:58.520 --> 01:52:03.040]  not going to use that information for political or partisan purposes and what the Project
[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:08.440]  Veritas video has documented and substantiated covered by Fox News yesterday covered by a
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:13.560]  wider range of media coverage covered by local news coverage all across the country is that
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:17.960]  basically they are deliberately coordinating and manipulating their algorithms they even
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:22.000]  call their algorithm a fairness algorithm whose sole and whole intention is to manipulate
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.960]  the election and by their own declared announcement to prevent the rise of Trumpism in the United
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:33.960]  States ever again and that got the president's attention that's and reported that as the
[01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:39.200]  president disclosed that the Facebook needs to be sued, Google needs to be sued, YouTube
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:43.000]  needs to be sued, class actions need to come about, class actions need to happen.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.160]  And by the way I recap that I was hitting the cough button to blow my nose and didn't
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:49.440]  know that it's wired under your mic we're going to change that it just cut out a few
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:54.520]  seconds you're saying this we cannot quantify how ultra massive this is I mean I'm trying
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:59.480]  to explain to people I don't go on air and say this is Death Star blowing up event okay
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:03.320]  I mean we have X-wings in the trench we are approaching the reactor shaft you understand
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:08.840]  we're fully loaded with photon torpedoes okay and I'm telling you I've shot swamp rats
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:14.600]  that are bigger than this port we can do this but Trump has to fire the missiles we can take
[01:53:14.600 --> 01:53:19.000]  back Google take it all back have a free for all a free speech we're gonna win it's over
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:23.760]  we're selling Americana versus globalism and chopping our son's testicles off.
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:27.720]  It's basically 1776 all over again and this is the Boston Tea Party event.
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:30.880]  So that's what's happened there's been this final there's been the sons of liberty were
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:35.120]  organized for years before Boston Tea Party took place and triggered the American Revolution
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:36.120]  that changed.
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:40.080]  We have the committees of correspondence for the decade by hand handbills saying what
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:44.000]  was happening and people keep thinking oh if they censor we won't have any handbills
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  or even more powerful hand flyers out people are ready folks.
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.720]  Besides and they wouldn't there wouldn't be this coordinated effort to try to remove
[01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:56.680]  anybody from even mentioning your name mentioning various aspects of the broadcast people who
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:54:00.960]  simply rebroadcast aspects of the broadcast there wouldn't be this obsession if it wasn't
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:03.080]  working if it wasn't being successful.
[01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:07.760]  So it's the reason why Google removed Project Veritas' own video exposing Google on YouTube.
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:11.680]  It had a million and a half views even with a shadow band in 12 hours they banned the
[01:54:11.680 --> 01:54:17.560]  thing and now that's the final symbol with the video her saying I'm the head of censorship
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:21.040]  Trump will not be reelected and then now have you seen her letter where she says it's all
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:25.240]  fake it's all deceptively edited she runs nothing which is all lies.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.240]  Completely.
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:28.840]  If that was the case there would be no need to remove the video they could just answer
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:32.760]  it in the public arena the fact that they're having to resort to these unique extraordinary
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:36.560]  censorship attempts and then lie to the world they go out on Twitter and say they never
[01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:37.560]  politically discriminate.
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:41.400]  Well that's a legally actionable claim by anybody who then gets discriminated against
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:47.520]  because they could in reliance upon that misrepresentation continue to use YouTube when YouTube in fact
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:51.800]  is continually dangerous to free speech in America because of its censorship and election
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:53.880]  meddling control mechanisms.
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:57.720]  So you're seeing them continually double down on their deceptions double down on their
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:55:01.920]  perjury before Congress double down on their false representations to consumers double
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:05.400]  down on their false representations to potential business partners people like Steven Crowder
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:06.400]  and others.
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:09.800]  And so there needs to be a coordinated effort and that's what we have the president of the
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:14.440]  United States calling for a coordinated legal effort against them which he's doing the parts
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:17.440]  that he can do in terms of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:20.960]  And let's be clear again the fact that these 20 attorney generals are meeting in a couple
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:26.320]  of weeks led by Holly a former attorney general of Missouri that first took action a few years
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:31.360]  ago saw this early on great guy smart guy visionary understands the key here to communications
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:35.680]  and free open communications this is this is election meddling and it's like not letting
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:39.360]  black candidates you know buy ads in a newspaper a hundred years ago in the south.
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:44.680]  I mean this stuff is unbelievable and now you've got this summit announced in 1516 days
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:47.920]  and you've got Trump saying it's time for the Justice Department to take action.
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:50.640]  This is all the signals that they should have backed off instead.
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:54.960]  I've got the articles pouring in the censorship has gotten worse absolutely their response
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:58.880]  is just like she says on the tape Congress will try to stop us but we're not gonna stop
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:03.000]  exactly do you see me included they didn't care about belligerence absolutely that they
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.280]  are so arrogant that they believe they are a law into themselves and the question is
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:07.440]  whether that's true or not.
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:10.460]  But they do they have more power than the president of the United States that they
[01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:13.620]  have more power than the courts of the United States did they have more power than the juries
[01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:17.180]  of the United States they have more power than the Congress of the United States they
[01:56:17.180 --> 01:56:20.040]  have more power than the Attorney General of the United States but they have more power
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:22.260]  than the Attorney General's of every state across the country.
[01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:25.880]  By the way you're hosting tomorrow i'm gonna be hosting tonight and tomorrow night or
[01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:28.920]  the debate you'll be co-hosted now you're gonna host the show tomorrow i'm taking care
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:33.600]  of some technical things here at the office and some family issues as well that are critical
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:38.000]  But I'll still be working tomorrow during the debate, 7 o'clock central, but I want
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:41.640]  you to take over during the next segment, just a little test for five minutes.
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:42.760]  You're doing a great job, Robert Barnes.
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:43.760]  I love this guy.
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:44.760]  I got a great brain.
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:47.840]  Got to be really good friends with him, familiar with him for over a decade in his big cases.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:52.880]  He's won, and so much more for Wesley Snipes and so many others, but now doing great work
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:53.880]  for Info Wars.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:56.760]  He's going to come back, then we'll get to some of these calls that are still holding
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:00.600]  like Pete and Will, and then we're going to shift gears into all the other news and
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:03.120]  all the other video clips and things we haven't hit yet.
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:06.240]  But this is very exciting time to be alive, folks.
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:10.480]  We're fighting back and all their attempts to shut us down have failed thanks to you,
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:13.600]  but we are in one hell of an intense fight right now.
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:18.520]  And that's why your word of mouth keeps saying it because it's the key overrides the sensors,
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:21.400]  overrides the Intel AI.
[01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:26.720]  Your human intelligence, humid, the military calls it, can override all of it still.
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:27.720]  But it's word of mouth.
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:28.720]  It's using your email.
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:32.040]  It's using your text messages to say infowars.com.
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:35.320]  They're trying to shut it down because Info Wars has discovered the chai comms in our
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:36.560]  government, literally.
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:40.640]  And then newswars.com and things you can spread on the major tech platforms.
[01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:41.640]  It's not a sensor.
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:44.520]  We'll be right back with Robert Barnes, and I'll be back in your phone call.
[01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:47.520]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:52.600]  Info Wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:54.920]  the last year or so.
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:55.920]  It's Orwellian.
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:56.920]  It's biblical.
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:57.920]  It's authoritarian.
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:57:58.920]  It's insane.
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:04.960]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to stumble up on deck as
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:09.280]  the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking.
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:12.880]  I've begged for your support before, and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:13.880]  SOS.
[01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:17.760]  If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, Info Wars will
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:20.440]  be shut down, not just crippled.
[01:58:20.440 --> 01:58:21.440]  And so we've reached that point.
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:23.960]  It'll make the enemy happy, but you know, whatever.
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:26.120]  We have withstood so many of their attacks.
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:28.720]  We've gone through so much because of your support.
[01:58:28.720 --> 01:58:32.040]  You have, you have been there, but let me tell you, they are pissed.
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:34.880]  They haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault.
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:41.040]  So we need your prayers, your financial support and your word of mouth now at infowarscore.com.
[01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:42.040]  It's your fight.
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:46.520]  Decide whether or not you want Info Wars to continue because we could be shut down.
[01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:49.840]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:50.840]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:51.840]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:54.440]  Hey, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:58.080]  I talked to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I can tell you is
[01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:00.560]  that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:04.960]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:08.760]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public.
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:09.760]  The approaching 2020.
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:10.760]  That's it.
[01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:13.360]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:16.120]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:17.440]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:18.440]  I agree entirely.
[01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:21.600]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:23.560]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:26.440]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:28.760]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:31.960]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:36.560]  You've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:37.880]  who are going to continue.
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:39.800]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[01:59:39.800 --> 01:59:43.840]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:46.320]  a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:51.480]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[01:59:51.480 --> 02:00:02.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:08.440]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:18.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:21.880]  The president faces one major threat to his reelection.
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:25.800]  It's really not the Democrats that are going to be up on the debate stage tonight.
[02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:30.320]  It's really not the potential contenders that he could face in the general election.
[02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:34.160]  It's not even really the big media defamation and lies and libel that we've seen exposed,
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:40.840]  the latest one being the nut who reinvented a law and order story to accuse falsely the
[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:45.240]  president of sexual assault, probably the 20th or 21st false accusation the president
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:46.400]  has had to face.
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:51.480]  It's not the crazy emoluments lawsuit that's trying to pry into the president's private
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:52.560]  finances.
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:56.720]  It's not the Democratic Congress's attempts to illicitly obtain his tax return records
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:00:58.520]  or other financial records.
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:00:59.720]  It's none of those attributes.
[02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:06.040]  The biggest threat he faces is what's a front page article on Info Wars today, which is
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:11.360]  about the election manipulation that Project Veritas has documented is the overt and express
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:17.920]  intention of the Google folks running the fairness algorithm over the 2020 election.
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:23.760]  So Professor Dr. Robert Epstein, which he was referenced in his link to in the article,
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:28.560]  has for years been documented in demonstrating how Google, just by manipulating its algorithms,
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:32.120]  just by where stories rank in the Google news stories.
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:35.240]  So if you go to Google and you do a search and you do a search, and remember, there's
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:40.440]  going to be about 10, 20% of the electorate that does not tune into any sort of news source
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:44.840]  if they tune into anything, it's mainstream or establishment news.
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:47.160]  They'll tune in in a transitory way.
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:50.920]  And increasingly, particularly if they're younger than 50 years old, they'll increasingly
[02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:53.960]  go to Google for their news information.
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:57.960]  And what Dr. Robert Epstein documented in detail was that if Google just had subtle
[02:01:57.960 --> 02:02:02.440]  manipulations of its algorithms, so that you did in a search for President Trump, and the
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:08.120]  first five articles are negative articles, or you do a Google search for Hillary Clinton
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:13.040]  in 2016, but it's going to be worse in 2020, given their explicit and express admissions
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:17.200]  on the undercover videotape documented by James O'Keefe's Project Veritas, what you're
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:20.800]  going to see is that you're going to see negative information about President Trump,
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:23.840]  and positive information about whoever his Democratic challenger is.
[02:02:23.840 --> 02:02:29.000]  And it's that manipulation, subtle, indirect, not overt, not necessarily evident that anyone
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:35.160]  can see your witness watching it, can influence up to 20% swing in the election.
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:38.720]  And when you're talking about Wisconsin, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania states where the
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:44.480]  president won by 1%, half of 1%, one and a half percent, that's all that's needed to
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:45.480]  swing the election.
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:48.880]  All they need to do is to swing the upper Midwest states, get about two, three percent
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:50.920]  of the vote to swing.
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:55.040]  So they already documented that Facebook and Google can simply by recommending people to
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:59.460]  vote by choosing to recommend a certain Democratic groups to vote, but not recommending the same
[02:02:59.460 --> 02:03:04.760]  to Republican groups can change turnout and move 1% of the electorate just by that factor.
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:08.960]  So you add to that their algorithmic manipulation of news stories and events.
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:13.120]  And the net effect is that they can change the election in Nevada and Arizona and Wisconsin
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:16.760]  and Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Florida.
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:23.280]  And all they need is just about 100,000 or so votes out of 65 million, 130 million plus
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:24.520]  that will likely be cast.
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:27.800]  There's projections that there'll be as many as 150 million votes.
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:30.920]  When you look at it from that standpoint and that perspective, that's the importance of
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:35.880]  this election manipulation news story that's up on InfoWars today that goes through the
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:38.600]  long that there's been multiple reports of this.
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:42.920]  There's been reports going back to the 2017 election where the founder of LinkedIn was
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:47.640]  manipulating election information, creating fake Russian body counts to undermine Roy
[02:03:47.640 --> 02:03:49.360]  Moore's Senate campaign.
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:53.480]  There's been allegations that Facebook and Google manipulated algorithms to drive people
[02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:55.720]  to negative stories about Senator Moore.
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:59.320]  That was almost the first test case of how social media could dictate the outcome of
[02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:02.200]  a Senate election even in a conservative Republican state.
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:07.160]  And if they could achieve it there, then there's arguments that had happened in 2018.
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:11.680]  Professor Epstein documented how just subtle manipulation of Google's algorithms could
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:16.880]  move millions and millions of votes and that by itself can achieve the outcome.
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:22.000]  So this is the biggest risk the president faces and that's why the president went on
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.440]  Fox Business News this morning to say legal action needs to be taken, lawsuits need to
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:32.040]  be filed against Facebook, against Google, against YouTube, against Twitter for their
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:35.720]  social censorship, for their election meddling, for their election control.
[02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:40.560]  The real collusion is between big tech and big media to defeat the populism that's rising
[02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:41.800]  around the world.
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:46.960]  And as we come into the next segment, we will discuss how those lawsuits can be filed, what
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:51.400]  lawsuits can be brought about, and what legal change the courts and the juries can provide
[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:56.880]  to bring back election honesty to American political process.
[02:04:56.880 --> 02:05:00.840]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:05.320]  The other thing that's unique about Info Wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:10.320]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire,
[02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:13.880]  that's not being funded by a secret foreign government, it is completely independent of
[02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:14.880]  all that.
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:20.120]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:23.960]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:28.280]  the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[02:05:28.280 --> 02:05:31.880]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era
[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:35.720]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:39.840]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to
[02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:44.440]  have or express or hear and the Info Wars audience has broken through that.
[02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:48.800]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:53.640]  freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation, law
[02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:56.640]  fair and libel targeting youth.
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:06:13.640]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:13.640 --> 02:06:17.960]  Alright Robert Barnes is our guest, I'm going to get you a few callers that have been holding
[02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:23.320]  and then I'm going to open the phones up again on the topic of Trump announcing a big summit
[02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:27.160]  on censorship and how to fight back against it and you know something else is going to
[02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:33.040]  happen at that event that I was told about six months ago by folks that had a meeting
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:38.880]  with the head of the campaign Brad Parcell and at that meeting he said listen we can
[02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:44.000]  try to break him up as anti-trust that will take a while, we could probably do some injunctions,
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:47.520]  we could also cut government funding to these groups while they're doing it like they've
[02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:50.800]  done with the universities, we could threaten lawsuits and do those but that would still
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:54.520]  take time, they're going to try to bum rush the election, the White House knows what's
[02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:55.520]  happening.
[02:06:55.520 --> 02:07:00.760]  But the big move would be the President using his bully pulpit to tell all conservatives
[02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:09.960]  to move to new platforms and notice the one that Brad Parcell promoted a few months ago,
[02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:19.440]  Marlar, well Apple announced today it's going to be removed off iTunes unless it starts
[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:26.080]  telling the leftist line and now when people are about to get an app approved they openly
[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:33.320]  tell them, in fact just on Monday put me the article again, a major life site, major Christian
[02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:39.720]  site, one of the biggest, they said you're banned because you're unscientific and you
[02:07:39.720 --> 02:07:44.560]  believe in a God, now they would, yes that actually happened on Monday, you would never
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:51.840]  do that to a Muslim or a Buddhist, constitutional lawyer, Robert Barnes told me today, why do
[02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:55.160]  you think there's such a hatred of Christians?
[02:07:55.160 --> 02:08:00.880]  I mean I think it's become because of the last sort of institutional source that's
[02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:03.280]  counter the sort of leftist cultural narrative.
[02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:06.640]  So you look at the attack on Covington, it wasn't a surprise that they targeted Catholic
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:11.720]  school kids because one of the last institutions left in America that is a residual resistance
[02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:16.640]  to the cultural left's almost monopolistic control over the mind shaping institutions
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:17.640]  of the world.
[02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:21.240]  You look at big tech disproportionately controlled by the cultural left, you look at universities
[02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:25.880]  and academia and public education disproportionately controlled by the academic left and the political
[02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:30.480]  left and the cultural left, you look at news media disproportionately journalist, you look
[02:08:30.480 --> 02:08:34.800]  at people who self identify as journalists but these days are pretty much activist, overwhelmingly
[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:39.760]  identify on the cultural left, you look at people in the entertainment industry, Hollywood,
[02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:45.680]  screenwriting, TV, film, books, overwhelmingly on the cultural left, so they have near monopolistic
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:50.000]  control, they have the same kind of power that the inquisitional Catholic church had
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.680]  in the 13th, 14th, 15th century in medieval Europe during the dark ages and it was called
[02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:59.480]  the dark ages for a reason, there was too much monopolistic control by one particular
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:03.360]  cultural group and the First Amendment was designed to prohibit that by not allowing
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:05.080]  for the establishment of religion.
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:09.880]  And don't liberals need a reformation, they become everything they ever claim they opposed.
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:13.600]  Absolutely they become totalitarian, really they've returned to the old communist model,
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:17.320]  the old Stasi style model, so what you're seeing is that there was a part of the left
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:23.600]  that was always totalitarian, authoritarian, control oriented, cultural monopolistic oriented
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:27.080]  and there was a part of the left that was libertarian and it was liberty oriented and
[02:09:27.080 --> 02:09:31.160]  individual rights oriented, that part of the left is almost near dead, you see it in the
[02:09:31.160 --> 02:09:36.000]  way the ACLU has abandoned civil liberties and civil rights in a wide range of political
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:40.200]  causes, if it doesn't advance the leftist agenda, whereas they've adapted leftist cases
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:43.920]  on immigration and other issues that have nothing to do with civil liberties of Americans,
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:47.520]  it's called the American Civil Liberties Union, it's not the asylum civil liberties
[02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:52.120]  union, it's not the Muslim civil liberties union, there's a lot of organizations that
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:56.800]  represent those individuals and those institutions and those ideas and yet the ACLU has abandoned
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:10:01.320]  its original goals and objectives because the cultural left has basically monopolized
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:06.240]  so many parts of our legal industry, so much of our practice, so much of our profession,
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:10.720]  so much of the cultural mindset and ideas that they have adapted and adopted to and
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:14.760]  the effect is that basically the cultural right has been left out of the equation and
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:19.480]  there's these little institutions that fight back against that and that's the church, that's
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:24.040]  the schools that are religiously oriented or private institutions that are religiously
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:29.640]  oriented, this is for young people in America, it's the only counterweight to the bombardment
[02:10:29.640 --> 02:10:34.640]  that the cultural left imposes in public universities and schools and newsrooms and
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:39.080]  TV newsrooms and broadcasts and Hollywood entertainment and TV shows and even video
[02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:44.160]  games, it's the reason why Gamergate happened, you had the cultural left try to take over
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:49.960]  the video gaming culture and they reacted and they created actually a spontaneous rebellion
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:54.880]  of people who've now become young Trumpists on places like Reddit and 4chan because of
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:59.960]  the resistance to this sort of cultural monopolistic mindset that wishes that's very oppressive
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:04.240]  and authoritarian, it's like watching Chernobyl, it's what happens when you get that sort of
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:08.400]  governmental control but what we have is we have de facto monopolistic control by the
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:12.280]  cultural left and so many institutions that they see their main resistance as great.
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:16.680]  We really are the new Soviet Union but it's bigger and nastier as it's America, powered
[02:11:16.680 --> 02:11:22.400]  by Hollywood and the Chikoms, it's like a giant metastasizing cancer, it's foul, I
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:28.760]  have stacks of articles where mainstream news is publishing stuff where pedophiles are dreaming
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:34.040]  about having sex with children, you read this stuff and it's like assaults your brain as
[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:39.920]  an adult, I am raped looking at it and then the left is just, they have just disintegrated
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:40.920]  man.
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:44.440]  Oh completely and what's happened is they're finding resistance in places they didn't
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:49.480]  anticipate, so you look at Gamergate, Gamergate unleashed a bunch of young, populist, libertarian
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:53.240]  oriented, liberty oriented individuals who previously were apolitical.
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:57.680]  They were in their own fantasy world, thought they were battling foreign armies and goblins
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:01.440]  but then when they realized oh there's a real battle space in the internet and on the streets
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:02.680]  then they were activated.
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:06.480]  Exactly, so people like Sargon of Arkod, people like Milo Yiannopoulos, a lot of them
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:11.760]  only became famous or became political overtly or publicly because of Gamergate and Gamergate
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:18.960]  was just the attempted corruption of the gaming journalistic community and as well the attempts
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:24.480]  by the cultural left to monopolize one of these last institutions, culturally and socially,
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:27.080]  that was a counterweight to their monopolist.
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:30.160]  And the left didn't like it because it was mainly a bunch of guys eating hot pockets
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:34.200]  and making jokes and having fun after work and they don't like man caves, they don't
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:38.880]  like anything, they want complete control, it's very, you go back to the original of
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:43.120]  the word, the origin of the word totalitarian, that's what they really are, they're authoritarians
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:47.400]  as well but they're really totalitarian, they want total control.
[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:52.520]  Omni God envy, they want omnipresent control.
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:57.840]  Absolutely, they want to replace God, going back to your original question, why the hostility
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:03.180]  to Christianity, two reasons, one those institutions provide a counterweight to leftist cultural
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:06.920]  influence in the United States and the western world including within the African American
[02:13:06.920 --> 02:13:13.240]  and Latino communities and secondly they provide a ideological idea that is the idea they want
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:14.240]  to replace.
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:17.940]  It's like a popular book called Equus some years ago where basically the psychological
[02:13:17.940 --> 02:13:23.520]  profession is trying to replace priests and replace preachers is the sort of the template
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:26.160]  of the book or the underlying thematic structure of the book.
[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:29.800]  And you're seeing the same thing happen, the cultural left wants to be God, wants to replace
[02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:34.320]  God and wants to have the power that even God himself has never asserted which is complete
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:39.560]  utter control of a person's thoughts, of a person's ideas, what they read, what they
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:40.560]  see.
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:44.440]  You see that in an obsession and in a fear of speech and a fear of debate, they want
[02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:48.960]  a safe space exception to the First Amendment freedoms and even inside the courtroom, even
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:54.720]  in the public arena, even in YouTube and social media, there's this obsession with control,
[02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:56.560]  control, control, control.
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:00.600]  And it's very Orwellian and it's Orwellian in ways even Orwell himself could not have
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:01.600]  imagined or invented.
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:05.680]  Well, by the way, and I'm not just saying this, I want to do a whole film on this or
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:07.920]  a whole special report.
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:12.320]  Even on the leftist YouTube channels, 80% of the comments are against them, but you
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:16.120]  go to other channels where they're attacking myself or others that go check, I'll have
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:21.760]  to read 10 pages before I find someone going, you know, Alex Jones is a racist or some made
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:25.120]  up crap or Alex Jones lost his kids, which isn't true.
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:28.280]  Literally everyone and a lot of people are like, Hey, I'm not even a conservative, but
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:33.080]  I like Alex Jones, I like the truth and and people, I think all their attempt at censorship
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:34.080]  is backfired.
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:35.080]  Yes, it does.
[02:14:35.080 --> 02:14:36.080]  And that's what normally happens.
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:37.080]  It's the forbidden fruit effect.
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:40.640]  When you tell people you can't watch something, can't read something, can't hear something,
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:44.080]  can't see something, can't say something, then I'm always intrigued.
[02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:45.680]  Well, what is it you're so scared of?
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:48.080]  That idea is always losing the public arena.
[02:14:48.080 --> 02:14:49.080]  Nobody's really scared.
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:52.560]  The real, I mean, look at all the people they've de-platformed, look at who has not been de-platformed
[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:53.560]  at all.
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:54.560]  David Duke.
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:55.560]  There's an overt racist.
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:56.560]  Why?
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:14:57.560]  Because he's utterly unpersuasive.
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:00.760]  You get exposed to David Duke's ideas and you want nothing to do with David Duke or his
[02:15:00.760 --> 02:15:01.760]  ideas.
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:04.280]  So it's popular ideas that are populist.
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:05.280]  It's Donald Trump.
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:06.280]  It's Tucker Carlson.
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:07.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:08.400]  That's what they don't want you to hear.
[02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:09.400]  Exactly.
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:12.440]  They don't want popular, persuasive arguments to be made.
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:13.440]  They want to be...
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:14.440]  They're unifying.
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:15.440]  Correct.
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:16.440]  Exactly.
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:17.440]  That are humanitarian in origin.
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:18.440]  That are a...
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:19.440]  Classically liberal.
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:20.440]  Exactly.
[02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:21.440]  In the original constitutional American experience.
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:23.760]  So the counterfeit left us want to get rid of their original liberal.
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:24.760]  Absolutely.
[02:15:24.760 --> 02:15:26.800]  The body snatcher always tries to get rid of what it's copying.
[02:15:26.800 --> 02:15:30.640]  Because the original liberal is an ultimate counterweight and contradiction to the modern
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:31.920]  day cultural left.
[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:34.240]  Because it's independent oriented, individual oriented.
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:35.440]  Well take your counterpart Norm Pattis.
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:36.440]  He's a famous liberal.
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:37.440]  He detests the left.
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:38.440]  Exactly.
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:39.440]  And that's increasingly the case.
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:42.000]  I mean half the people that are on social media these days that are big Trumpist would
[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:43.440]  have been liberals ten years ago.
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:47.240]  It's because people like Dave Reuben and other people, the left has drove them insane and
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:49.120]  they have no choice but to resist.
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:52.040]  Because the only way to express freedom in the modern world is to resist the cultural
[02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:53.040]  left.
[02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:55.920]  We're going to come back and take calls.
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:16:01.880]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder or legs, you now
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:07.160]  have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[02:16:12.640 --> 02:16:13.640]  Yes.

[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:10.120]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:13.360]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:17.120]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:21.400]  is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:25.960]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:32.160]  leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:33.160]  month.

[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:50.760]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:51.760]  before purchasing.
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:57.080]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:18:04.000]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee and luckily
[02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:10.000]  our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stock full of high quality Info Wars store

[02:19:54.680 --> 02:19:59.480]  We're not going to back down.
[02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:05.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:10.800]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:16.920]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread and the military apparatus of this
[02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:19.920]  country is about to be handed over to scum.
[02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:29.920]  Russian scum.
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:37.680]  Please listen, if you don't, if you want, if you fail to understand, then the same incredible
[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:40.120]  terror that's menacing me will strike in you.
[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:43.120]  The function of all life is survival.
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:44.120]  Sleep.
[02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:45.120]  Sleep.
[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:46.120]  Sleep.
[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:50.280]  Oh, my God.
[02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:53.280]  Oh, my God.
[02:20:53.280 --> 02:20:54.400]  Lock the door.
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:55.400]  Lock the door.
[02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:56.400]  They're coming.
[02:20:56.400 --> 02:20:57.400]  They're coming.
[02:20:57.400 --> 02:20:58.400]  Help.
[02:20:58.400 --> 02:20:59.400]  Help.
[02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:00.400]  They're coming.
[02:21:00.400 --> 02:21:01.400]  They're coming.
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:02.400]  Listen to me.
[02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:03.400]  Listen.
[02:21:03.400 --> 02:21:04.400]  Help me.
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:05.400]  Your next please.
[02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:06.400]  Please.
[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:07.400]  Your next, they're in danger.
[02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:08.400]  Please, listen to me.
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:09.400]  It's something terrible.
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:10.400]  Please.
[02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:11.400]  Your next, here they are.
[02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:12.400]  They're already here.
[02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:13.400]  Help.
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:14.400]  Your next.
[02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:15.400]  They're coming.
[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:18.280]  Sleep, sleep.
[02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:20.280]  Terror, grows.
[02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:23.320]  Atlas, if we wake up, we'll get you when you sleep.
[02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:24.880]  Sit up.
[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:28.480]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:30.720]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:32.080]  Is it contagious?
[02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:34.080]  Stop real homies.
[02:21:34.080 --> 02:21:35.160]  It looked right at me.
[02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:36.080]  Your needs to get out.
[02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:40.480]  You're looking at as if it was human or not human.
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:44.160]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:46.480]  We're being cornered.
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:49.240]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[02:21:49.240 --> 02:21:51.960]  Ibarricated in the street.
[02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:54.920]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:57.920]  The land of the walking dead.
[02:21:57.920 --> 02:21:58.920]  Ah!
[02:21:58.920 --> 02:21:59.920]  Ah!
[02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:00.920]  Ah!
[02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:01.920]  Ah!
[02:22:01.920 --> 02:22:02.920]  Ah!
[02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:03.920]  Ah!
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:04.920]  Ah!
[02:22:04.920 --> 02:22:05.920]  Ah!
[02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:06.920]  Ah!
[02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:07.920]  Ah!
[02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:08.920]  Ah!
[02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:09.920]  Ah!
[02:22:09.920 --> 02:22:10.920]  Ah!
[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:15.920]  Ah!
[02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:20.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:22:20.920 --> 02:22:26.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:28.440]  We are drugged out.
[02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:31.840]  We are following other people's opinions.
[02:22:31.840 --> 02:22:34.280]  We are controlled by the media.
[02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:36.560]  Today, it all changes.
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:39.240]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[02:22:39.240 --> 02:22:42.240]  It is a choice, just like what I said, slavery is a choice.
[02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:47.080]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:50.200]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, you f*** you, you f*** you.
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:52.560]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:54.560]  Why don't we just try love?
[02:22:54.560 --> 02:22:56.640]  Why don't we just try love?
[02:22:56.640 --> 02:23:00.600]  We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:04.760]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy mother f***ers to change something.
[02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:06.240]  Steve Jobs was crazy.
[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:07.840]  Now we all know Steve Jobs' phones.
[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:08.840]  They say Trump's crazy.
[02:23:08.840 --> 02:23:09.840]  They say I'm crazy.
[02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:12.360]  But I'm here to show love.
[02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:17.520]  It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[02:23:17.520 --> 02:23:21.680]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:44.320]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:50.240]  I'm watching the midterms, then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[02:23:50.240 --> 02:23:52.760]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala.
[02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:57.920]  They're coming from Mexico.
[02:23:57.920 --> 02:23:59.080]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:00.080]  You want a drop?
[02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:01.080]  You want a drop?
[02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:02.080]  Damn!
[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:03.080]  What's up, kids?
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:04.080]  What's up, kids?
[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:05.080]  What's up, kids?

[02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:08.080]  What's up, kids?
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:09.080]  What's up, kids?
[02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:10.080]  What's up, kids?
[02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:11.080]  What's up, kids?
[02:24:11.080 --> 02:24:12.080]  Who in the presidency?

[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:18.080]  Muslim.
[02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:39.660]  And then you would think everybody in the countries is like to the bunker
[02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:50.260]  Welcome back I'm Alex Jones your host I promise next segment Pete and Will we're gonna get to you

[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:06.600]  nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine Alex okay I've been running around like a
[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:11.820]  one-legged man and you know what contest that's an ass kicking contest dealing with globalist
[02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:17.460]  stuff that's breaking really good news really bad news crazy family stuff I'm not normally
[02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:23.100]  running back and forth you know getting back on air late but those are very important pieces
[02:25:23.100 --> 02:25:29.100]  of historical information we just showed but the time we have left in this segment I want to
[02:25:29.100 --> 02:25:32.060]  be very very clear about something because we say a lot of important things here everybody
[02:25:32.060 --> 02:25:36.940]  knows that our callers say amazing things our guests say incredible things the globalist want
[02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:40.860]  to software for a reason we understand what they're doing it's not hard to actually figure out
[02:25:40.860 --> 02:25:44.540]  it's just that you've got to come to grips with how evil they are and that takes them getting
[02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:49.420]  used to by people that aren't evil inherently the Bible says we all inherently are sinners and
[02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:56.220]  fallen but we're pointed at God we want to be good no the people want to be bad and our greatest
[02:25:56.220 --> 02:26:00.180]  attribute of all my problems because my god this shows a train wreck a lot of the time not
[02:26:00.180 --> 02:26:04.500]  because the crew this is the best crew I've ever had best crew in live radio and TV nothing
[02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:09.940]  else exists like this but me I'm a train wreck sometimes but the reason they hate us is we're
[02:26:09.940 --> 02:26:16.060]  telling the truth but most importantly there's a sense of urgency and I am a little bit wired
[02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:22.420]  on air I am a little bit hysterical I am I can sit out in a hot hot sun and don't sweat
[02:26:22.420 --> 02:26:26.700]  I start thinking about world government and pedophile rings coming out in the open and
[02:26:26.700 --> 02:26:32.940]  open borders and Islamic invasion I start sweating when I think about what what the
[02:26:32.940 --> 02:26:38.060]  what the cost are and what the stakes are that's why this is such an incredible time that
[02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:45.100]  we get that sense of urgency so people adapt and overcome not adapt by submitting as the
[02:26:45.100 --> 02:26:50.220]  globalists have said they want you to do so listen you don't have to buy a thing from InfoWars
[02:26:50.220 --> 02:26:53.260]  those that do I thank you they're great products you're getting a great product
[02:26:53.260 --> 02:26:58.060]  but your word of mouth is the most important thing because that's how we get the story out of
[02:26:58.060 --> 02:27:03.180]  what's really unfolding the globalist and they're planning how to stop them and the story is true
[02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:07.740]  and the story is accurate the story is riveting and people hear it and they understand it because
[02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:14.460]  they've already seen it in their own lives and so that's why I'm asking everyone on your email

[02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:24.060]  east bank of the mississippi because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a
[02:29:24.060 --> 02:29:28.460]  temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system
[02:29:28.460 --> 02:29:33.420]  at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory so here's

[02:33:25.580 --> 02:33:29.740]  because i keep going back to this because it's everything you're the reason we're here you keep
[02:33:29.740 --> 02:33:35.260]  the ship afloat and you keep america and the idea of freedom afloat they want to extinguish the idea
[02:33:35.260 --> 02:33:41.500]  of life being sacrosanct the fact that children should be sexualized it's now mainstream you are
[02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:48.780]  the resistance and the fact that we don't want to be the news every day there's probably 20 news
[02:33:48.780 --> 02:33:54.620]  articles i'm in today in major national publications that i can't even take time to read because so
[02:33:54.620 --> 02:34:00.460]  much is happening look at this bloomberg alex jones and my leonopolis will want to keep a close eye
[02:34:00.460 --> 02:34:05.740]  on this court case involving facebook a polish group is suing facebook for private censorship
[02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:12.700]  in a potentially landmark case this is being brought by the government big bloomberg article
[02:34:13.980 --> 02:34:19.100]  hillary comes out attacks me says oh she doesn't watch trump because he's you know info wars
[02:34:20.140 --> 02:34:26.460]  they understand folks that we are the operating system and i want to explain i didn't plagiarize
[02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:32.220]  the american operating system i was born out of it just like you were and and and i love it and it's
[02:34:32.220 --> 02:34:41.100]  who i am but i absolutely am a proselytite out there promoting it and believing in it because
[02:34:41.100 --> 02:34:46.300]  it's light years better than the globalist system robert barnes constitutional lawyer well it's
[02:34:46.300 --> 02:34:51.100]  amazing is that uh you may have more po freedom in poland than you do in the united states as it
[02:34:51.100 --> 02:34:57.020]  applies to big tech so poland is is protecting people's rights to free speech better than right
[02:34:57.020 --> 02:35:01.740]  now the united states is protecting people's right to free speech so you're seeing that in fact
[02:35:01.740 --> 02:35:05.660]  that's the reason why you had the president today announced that there needed to be a legal war
[02:35:06.380 --> 02:35:11.020]  on social media and the big tech giants for their attempts to manipulate now elections
[02:35:11.020 --> 02:35:15.180]  they've been manipulating speech speech for the purposes of manipulating thought manipulating
[02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:20.140]  ideas but the ultimate objective was always to manipulate elections and the info wars audience
[02:35:20.140 --> 02:35:24.300]  and the info wars network was at the tip of the spear and foreshadowed that this was going to be
[02:35:24.300 --> 02:35:29.500]  occurring they didn't do this just they didn't come after info wars solely to stop at info wars
[02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:34.700]  they did this to keep going further broader wider to have complete control of people's thoughts and
[02:35:34.700 --> 02:35:40.140]  ideas because it's a totalitarian mindset of these big tech monopolist built very much on a
[02:35:40.140 --> 02:35:44.540]  chinese social credit model system rather than the american liberty system let me ask you this
[02:35:45.660 --> 02:35:49.020]  now they've been caught red-handed over and over again and it's been made personal and specific
[02:35:49.020 --> 02:35:52.940]  and it's the head person over censorship she's now trying to deny that it's ridiculous we're
[02:35:52.940 --> 02:35:57.020]  going to go some calls her in a moment what do they counter strike with now with the 20
[02:35:57.020 --> 02:36:02.540]  attorney general set to meet set to meet in less than two weeks in oma on Nebraska as she said
[02:36:03.580 --> 02:36:06.940]  strangely enough i was going to be there then i'm not sure now this is weird i was going to be
[02:36:06.940 --> 02:36:11.580]  there on something else but now this is cropped up i may still go there but what do you make of that
[02:36:11.580 --> 02:36:17.580]  what do you make of what's unfolding here what do you make of trump in this summit now drawing
[02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:21.820]  attention to this that means he's about to take action okay how does he take action how would
[02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:26.780]  you advise the president to take action we'll do that next segment but just briefly how do you
[02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:31.340]  take action how do they counter strike there need to be a collective aggregate set of legal
[02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:36.220]  actions brought so you have the fdc bringing its investigation the department of justice doing its
[02:36:36.220 --> 02:36:41.180]  investigation the state attorney generals doing their investigation you have the various lawsuits
[02:36:41.180 --> 02:36:45.500]  that are currently pending by james demore against internal employee misconduct against
[02:36:45.500 --> 02:36:50.220]  those employees by google and others what there needs to be a prager you that has brought a
[02:36:50.220 --> 02:36:54.300]  legal action that's probably gonna be tough to bring but may have success what there need to
[02:36:54.300 --> 02:37:00.140]  be is additional class actions brought against these big social media giants and big tech giants
[02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:04.380]  for their social media manipulation not only for their participation and facilitation of
[02:37:04.380 --> 02:37:09.340]  defamation against people that they have deplatformed the way in which they manipulate their algorithms
[02:37:09.340 --> 02:37:15.180]  is according to even a high-ranking prior google counsel in an article written by a schadenarps
[02:37:15.180 --> 02:37:20.140]  associate who was working schadenarps work for google another big their achilles heel exactly
[02:37:20.140 --> 02:37:25.980]  so there needs to be a a broad there needs to be a multi-flanked attack from all sides and all
[02:37:25.980 --> 02:37:32.460]  angles state attorney generals private citizens governments attorney generals activists boycotts
[02:37:33.260 --> 02:37:38.460]  physical demonstrations and by the way i didn't even know this please print me that news wars.com
[02:37:38.460 --> 02:37:45.500]  they just quarantined the donald they just quarantine the most popular subreddit election
[02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:50.620]  meddling reddit quarantines the donald forum on first night of presidential debates so that again
[02:37:50.620 --> 02:37:55.340]  we can't get out there with our commentary and have memes they have big studies at fourchan
[02:37:55.340 --> 02:38:01.340]  the donald and of course they also said info wars is where the main countervailing resistance of
[02:38:01.340 --> 02:38:05.340]  talking points and the talking points just come from common sense and what the listeners and the
[02:38:05.340 --> 02:38:10.940]  guests say and organic they don't want they want to centralize telling us you those were great debates
[02:38:10.940 --> 02:38:16.700]  communism sounds wonderful free health care free housing uh free everything free education it sounds
[02:38:16.700 --> 02:38:21.660]  wonderful this is insane well it'll be very interesting tonight tonight to see how much there's
[02:38:21.660 --> 02:38:26.860]  actually any meaningful disagreement and any any meaningful dissension between the democratic
[02:38:26.860 --> 02:38:30.620]  candidates and it's clear they don't want i mean the president's gonna be live tweeting it uh but
[02:38:30.620 --> 02:38:34.940]  i mean that's why they took down the reddit project veritas uh yesterday in the day before to try to
[02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:40.300]  limit the exposure of these oh there's no doubt now they're on a total war path to shut down trump's
[02:38:40.300 --> 02:38:45.820]  base exactly it trump trump either is a lunatic and is overconfident or he's been bought off by him
[02:38:45.820 --> 02:38:49.580]  and i know that's not the case because i know insiders trump does not take money from anybody
[02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:53.820]  i think trump really believed that they would not act irrationally against their own self-interest
[02:38:53.820 --> 02:38:59.180]  that when they saw the legal threats of the any trust action of uh senator holly's legislation
[02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:03.900]  of the demore legislatively oh he can't believe it exactly he's totally sad the pentagon goes hey
[02:39:03.900 --> 02:39:09.180]  we're not perfect but we're the good guys you you were built here we let you be billionaires and
[02:39:09.180 --> 02:39:13.260]  hundred billionaires we don't come take it from you like china would why are you going to china and
[02:39:13.260 --> 02:39:18.300]  be a state run they i mean what what are you doing are you insane i think people are shocked by the
[02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:23.100]  degree of eric it's what you have in big tech is a bunch of like big babies a bunch of people with
[02:39:23.100 --> 02:39:26.860]  a hundred billion dollars who literally were raised to hate america they're big babies that have
[02:39:26.860 --> 02:39:30.620]  become big bullies because they've been so protected remember they are stepping on your line
[02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:35.420]  i'm gonna make a one minute out of this what has robert barnes what does big tech become a big
[02:39:35.420 --> 02:39:39.180]  tech or big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no
[02:39:39.180 --> 02:39:44.300]  consequence social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades
[02:39:44.300 --> 02:39:48.700]  and because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the public the public officials
[02:39:48.700 --> 02:39:52.940]  that care about this the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[02:39:52.940 --> 02:39:56.540]  members of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social
[02:39:56.540 --> 02:40:00.700]  political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change
[02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:04.860]  and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[02:40:04.860 --> 02:40:09.260]  who ran american politics and a ran american economy almost into the ground until we were
[02:40:09.260 --> 02:40:13.180]  able to recover after the great depression and let's be absolutely crystal clear here
[02:40:14.860 --> 02:40:20.140]  big railroads and big steel and big oil had pickerton security killed thousands were horribly
[02:40:20.140 --> 02:40:25.660]  corrupt gouged small time farmers ran all sorts of scams but they weren't reading all your mail
[02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:31.980]  they didn't know what bra size your wife wears or what size tampons and what you like to watch
[02:40:31.980 --> 02:40:36.940]  porn porn wise they didn't know what was in your bank account they didn't know what god you worship
[02:40:36.940 --> 02:40:43.820]  or don't worship this is omnipresent level abuse and coupled with the monopolies it is the ultimate
[02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:50.780]  mark of the beast style nightmare system and remember info wars was the vanguard of being
[02:40:50.780 --> 02:40:58.300]  banned first the most banned and at the vanguard of fighting it because we are the vanguard you are
[02:40:58.300 --> 02:41:03.900]  the vanguard step into the history folks i don't sit or go oh great i'm famous or oh great i'm
[02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:09.020]  infamous i'm i've gotta make it to the end we've got a win for our children we're fighting pure
[02:41:09.020 --> 02:41:13.500]  evil we're gonna put this out as a four minute promo this is powerful robert finish up and i
[02:41:13.500 --> 02:41:17.900]  swear on a stack of bibles pete and will and everybody will go to you we come back go ahead
[02:41:17.900 --> 02:41:23.100]  info wars is the the info wars audience is the fuel that flames the the light of liberty
[02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:27.180]  across the world and that's the reason why because it created this little d democratic experiment
[02:41:27.180 --> 02:41:32.060]  in independent free press independent free speech of ordinary americans coming together
[02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:36.140]  collectively and aggregately through their financial support of info wars to make real
[02:41:36.140 --> 02:41:40.940]  the original promise of an independent free press to make real the actions of independent free
[02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:45.740]  speech in our electoral arena in our social and cultural influential arena that shapes people's
[02:41:45.740 --> 02:41:50.620]  minds shape people's thoughts to where you can choose your own news and your own views and share
[02:41:50.620 --> 02:41:54.940]  and spread those with the rest of the world that is why it was the target for a totalitarian
[02:41:54.940 --> 02:42:00.220]  authoritarian control oriented big tech big media they used our openness as our weakness
[02:42:00.220 --> 02:42:05.900]  precisely it's real collusion real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working
[02:42:05.900 --> 02:42:10.140]  with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shape people's thoughts and then the
[02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:14.060]  whopper of telling us the whole time where it's not happening she wrote this article she waited
[02:42:14.060 --> 02:42:19.420]  two days to do it psyops wrote it as we take calls we'll read it and she says i don't work
[02:42:19.420 --> 02:42:24.620]  fair i don't have power this is all made up it's like the greatest gaslighting i've ever seen in
[02:42:24.620 --> 02:42:28.140]  my life no doubt because just several days ago she admitted and confessed it was true and that
[02:42:28.140 --> 02:42:32.380]  that project veritas just got her it's a 25 minute interview it's not it's not being taken out of
[02:42:32.380 --> 02:42:35.900]  context like the many comments and statements they've tried to attribute to you it's like saying i

[02:42:40.940 --> 02:42:45.580]  that that's not me on the video it's the ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what

[02:43:58.060 --> 02:44:03.820]  i've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence
[02:44:03.820 --> 02:44:10.620]  no longer matters the false claim that you purposely said kitty porn to the sandy hook
[02:44:10.620 --> 02:44:16.860]  plane tips is ludicrous as well as false it's a smear somebody sends you something that's
[02:44:16.860 --> 02:44:22.620]  encrypted you don't even open it it ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents and
[02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:28.060]  then it's blamed on you this is Kafka esque this is bizarre but the way the mainstream
[02:44:28.060 --> 02:44:34.380]  media rushes out to say jones sent kitty porn is really outrageous i have a lot of respect for
[02:44:34.380 --> 02:44:39.180]  those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified but i
[02:44:39.180 --> 02:44:43.900]  wonder where the big boys where's the wall street journal where's associated press when are they
[02:44:43.900 --> 02:44:49.500]  going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate so we both

[02:49:39.740 --> 02:49:43.500]  hey i like straight to talk to you first time listener long-time caller
[02:49:43.500 --> 02:49:49.980]  i mean uh first time caller long-time listener um anyway uh i think what the main problem is
[02:49:49.980 --> 02:49:56.860]  with taking down the technocrats is they essentially are the deep state because they give all their
[02:49:56.860 --> 02:50:02.860]  data and information to the cia and the nsda i think i've even heard on your show that facebook
[02:50:02.860 --> 02:50:09.980]  got their some of their startup money from those more than that the day the day that the cia facebook
[02:50:09.980 --> 02:50:14.700]  shut down was the day the new facebook started zuckerberg is a complete belterberg front the
[02:50:14.700 --> 02:50:19.340]  whole thing is the deep state but that doesn't mean the whole and i'm not lionizing the cia
[02:50:19.340 --> 02:50:24.460]  it doesn't mean the whole cia are bad people it means they use the cia power and the tentacles
[02:50:24.460 --> 02:50:29.820]  in the system these globalists who to control us held i mean i knew a lot of people growing up that
[02:50:29.820 --> 02:50:34.540]  had been in defense intelligence and army special operations back before it had names like delta
[02:50:34.540 --> 02:50:39.500]  force and uh you know government assassins and all that they were super patriot americans that would
[02:50:39.500 --> 02:50:44.780]  not cheat on their taxes and and went to church twice a week and would had gardens and you know
[02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:50.140]  in and gave their money to charity but those that's the backbone that made america so strong
[02:50:50.140 --> 02:50:56.540]  it's the criminals using these agencies for evils that makes sense yes the guys at top
[02:50:57.260 --> 02:51:02.700]  that are really criminals i mean they've been compromised they've allowed these uh so-called
[02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:07.100]  private companies to operate they're not really private companies because they're embedded with
[02:51:07.100 --> 02:51:13.580]  the deep state government but they allow them to operate and um we know that the left is all about
[02:51:13.580 --> 02:51:18.620]  loving the government and wanting to expand their power and all this let's be clear they don't love
[02:51:18.620 --> 02:51:23.980]  the government they love being in government and having power they love ill-gotten power how would
[02:51:23.980 --> 02:51:29.020]  you describe the leftist versus a liberal as prayer you does a great breakdown that a liberal 200
[02:51:29.020 --> 02:51:34.380]  years ago would be a rightly extremist today no doubt the the leftist loves statism so they love
[02:51:34.380 --> 02:51:38.780]  statism only for their own particular pernicious purposes but they are easily in bed with the
[02:51:38.780 --> 02:51:41.980]  state and so to give some backstory but they notice they don't want the state protecting
[02:51:41.980 --> 02:51:46.460]  for his peace though oh exactly oh no no which is one of its only roles the goal is it for to be
[02:51:46.460 --> 02:51:52.220]  an instrument of totalitarianism of cultural mindset thought control but the to give an example
[02:51:52.220 --> 02:51:56.860]  to what the caller is calling in about uh i was part of i was a part of a tech company young tech
[02:51:56.860 --> 02:52:00.940]  company in the 90s when microsoft had a similar deal with the government and what happened is
[02:52:00.940 --> 02:52:04.700]  microsoft betrayed their deal with the government did a backdoor they did disclose the department
[02:52:04.700 --> 02:52:08.700]  of defense and i remember meeting with a bunch of defense folks in the 90s talking about how
[02:52:08.700 --> 02:52:12.140]  they're how upset they were when they discovered this what's happened is big tech has done the
[02:52:12.140 --> 02:52:17.420]  same thing but much bigger exactly they burned one of their last bridges by going into bed with
[02:52:17.420 --> 02:52:21.820]  the chinese and by going into bed with the chinese who the defense department and our intelligence
[02:52:21.820 --> 02:52:26.540]  apparatus be clear with the poll at bureau exactly i mean basically the parasites that
[02:52:26.540 --> 02:52:31.820]  sit on top the chai comps it's the equivalent of enabling uh the kgb during the soviet era the
[02:52:31.820 --> 02:52:39.180]  or the stasi it'd be like turning uh grand bell over to the kgb in 1955 exactly and once they did
[02:52:39.180 --> 02:52:43.340]  that they burned a bridge with someone they cannot rebuild that bridge with and so once they
[02:52:43.340 --> 02:52:47.900]  that's the reason for they're in they don't have the political protection they normally would
[02:52:47.900 --> 02:52:52.860]  they used to have it they came out of they came out of darpa they came out of the advanced
[02:52:52.860 --> 02:52:57.660]  research laboratories and then they tried to crap all over it's over you're done google you're
[02:52:57.660 --> 02:53:02.060]  google you're just being strung out and hung you think that's the only footage we've got you dumb
[02:53:02.060 --> 02:53:07.100]  pieces of crap in fact it's going to be more and more and more project veritas reported they have
[02:53:07.100 --> 02:53:12.380]  had 24 different whistleblower reports just in the last two days since james o'keith was on this
[02:53:12.380 --> 02:53:17.340]  broadcast listen trump's ready to punch a button and release all the chai comp payoffs and these
[02:53:17.340 --> 02:53:21.100]  people oh i mean there's a bunch is a button the army will go slit every one of their throats in
[02:53:21.100 --> 02:53:27.820]  one hour it the i say why wait why why string them along but i get it trump was to slowly roast them
[02:53:27.820 --> 02:53:33.580]  the their corporate existence sits on a very weak foundation at this point because they every google
[02:53:33.580 --> 02:53:39.260]  executive has an army officer waiting to go slit their throat and that's not a threat they don't
[02:53:39.260 --> 02:53:43.740]  get it you're gonna work with a chai comes that killed 150 million people you're gonna piss all
[02:53:43.740 --> 02:53:49.900]  over america you're a foreign enemy now jackass you are an espionage operator you're attempting to
[02:53:49.900 --> 02:53:56.460]  take us over and you are done thank you pete i appreciate your call let's go to will in florida
[02:53:56.460 --> 02:54:03.260]  make sure pete gets his free t-shirt will go ahead you're on the air one time listen that first
[02:54:03.260 --> 02:54:10.220]  time caller and praying for you and that's what was uh my quick question is um why is trump taking
[02:54:10.220 --> 02:54:16.860]  so long to put the military on the board he has executive um power to do it he's been heating up
[02:54:16.860 --> 02:54:21.580]  for it and and and he's got it under the constitution he put some there but when they didn't give him
[02:54:21.580 --> 02:54:25.980]  the 12 billion he needed only one billion we see it's a crisis that's a good question why hasn't
[02:54:25.980 --> 02:54:30.060]  he gone to the full national emergency that's totally constitutional when it comes to a border
[02:54:30.060 --> 02:54:34.860]  what he wanted is the mexican army to do it first and then what's they've done 14 000 exactly they're
[02:54:34.860 --> 02:54:38.620]  putting 14 000 people on the border he wants more mexicans which is he's very judicious he
[02:54:38.620 --> 02:54:44.060]  doesn't want the big power grab to show his big stick he's really trying every option first exactly
[02:54:44.060 --> 02:54:48.940]  and he needs to do that because he needs so that when he uses the ultimate option it's seen as a
[02:54:48.940 --> 02:54:53.020]  last resort and that he tried everything else because otherwise the left in the media would
[02:54:53.020 --> 02:54:58.300]  love to make this it look like uh a militarization of the border and make the militarization of the
[02:54:58.300 --> 02:55:03.820]  border sounds scary and dangerous people need to be calling for it and demanding it in such a way
[02:55:03.820 --> 02:55:07.420]  what's scary and dangerous is a hundred thousand people every few weeks with little kids that are
[02:55:07.420 --> 02:55:11.500]  kidnapped and no one knows who the hell they are exactly knowing that it's become big business as
[02:55:11.500 --> 02:55:16.300]  you know the the second sicario movie made reference to it it's when even hollywood is conceding that
[02:55:16.300 --> 02:55:20.780]  the price has gone up from two grand to six grand to be brought across exactly it is more profitable
[02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:26.060]  in one year exactly more profitable for the cartels to bring people across the border than it is to
[02:55:26.060 --> 02:55:31.260]  bring drugs across the border that's how how it's become big business the cartels are in deep
[02:55:31.260 --> 02:55:36.620]  business with it and that's why unless the president gets mexico to take proactive action and continue
[02:55:36.620 --> 02:55:40.860]  to take proactive action the ability for even militarization of the border to work is in doubt
[02:55:40.860 --> 02:55:44.540]  and by the way for radio listeners you're 80 percent of our audience that that headline
[02:55:44.540 --> 02:55:49.100]  80 percent of central american women girls are raped amnesty international hubby and post
[02:55:49.100 --> 02:55:54.140]  senate report three years ago obama knowingly let tens of thousands of children be kidnapped and
[02:55:54.140 --> 02:55:59.420]  trafficked in senate report this isn't a joke so you sign on for an open border folks you
[02:55:59.420 --> 02:56:05.740]  sign on for kidnapped sex trafficked children some of which are who are snuffed yeah you sign up
[02:56:05.740 --> 02:56:10.300]  for there was a great movie years ago called el norte that documented in spanish the horrific
[02:56:10.300 --> 02:56:15.180]  experience of the of the people doing uh human trafficking and people doing smuggling of individuals
[02:56:15.180 --> 02:56:18.140]  into the country and they're almost all lied about i mean that's one of the things that came
[02:56:18.140 --> 02:56:21.740]  up about the cartels was that there was actually a sort of a lefty leaning mexican american
[02:56:21.740 --> 02:56:26.380]  reporter that was on joe rogan a couple of weeks ago and he detailed what the what the caravans
[02:56:26.380 --> 02:56:30.940]  disclose that the caravans were misled they were lied to in guatemalan honduras they were told
[02:56:30.940 --> 02:56:34.300]  they were that guy we should get him on that was a powerful interview with joe did i saw that it
[02:56:34.300 --> 02:56:38.060]  was it was very good in fact when we pointed out it was you know in p in tijuana they were
[02:56:38.060 --> 02:56:42.300]  putting up hats called make tijuana great again i mean they were mirroring and mimicking trump's
[02:56:42.300 --> 02:56:46.460]  behavior not as you get hundreds of thousands are coming through your town kidnapping your kids
[02:56:46.460 --> 02:56:50.380]  as a as a way to get across the border people are pissed exactly either people have been lied to
[02:56:50.380 --> 02:56:54.540]  to get to to to this part of the process or they're just involved in a list of smuggling many of the
[02:56:54.540 --> 02:56:58.860]  children did not volunteer for this at all they often don't have any parental relationship to
[02:56:58.860 --> 02:57:03.340]  what's taking place and releasing them the reason why they're being detained rather than released
[02:57:03.340 --> 02:57:07.020]  is because if they're released they're a subject to more abuse that's what got documented you're
[02:57:07.020 --> 02:57:13.580]  right here's the interview it's uh it's ed calderon with joe rogan and look at sad only 160 000 views
[02:57:13.580 --> 02:57:19.420]  i went on had 40 million views that guy deserves 40 million views it's a very good interview absolutely
[02:57:19.420 --> 02:57:23.980]  he documents in details what's really been happening he's the there's no effort that the president
[02:57:23.980 --> 02:57:27.820]  isn't against the people that are coming across the border he's against the illicit use of the
[02:57:27.820 --> 02:57:32.220]  attempts to access our country illegally with the help of the cartels that only enrich cartels
[02:57:32.220 --> 02:57:37.660]  that engage in human trafficking sexual that's right we'll stay there i want you to finish up and
[02:57:37.660 --> 02:57:41.500]  get it get his name and number and address he's getting that free clown world shirt there's only
[02:57:41.500 --> 02:57:46.380]  5 000 of them a thousand of already sold in forestore.com let's talk to marcus in new york
[02:57:46.380 --> 02:57:50.540]  marcus here on the air thanks for holding hey i just wanted to say uh your show is a breath of
[02:57:50.540 --> 02:57:54.780]  fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell you is
[02:57:54.780 --> 02:57:59.820]  that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately to get
[02:57:59.820 --> 02:58:04.620]  trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes
[02:58:04.620 --> 02:58:09.420]  of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his
[02:58:09.420 --> 02:58:13.100]  presidency it's the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time
[02:58:13.100 --> 02:58:17.100]  to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're

[03:03:06.860 --> 03:03:09.820]  music video what else do you want to say about trump taking military action
[03:03:11.420 --> 03:03:18.620]  i really appreciate you when in four wars um yeah so um i trump has the power to um
[03:03:19.500 --> 03:03:23.900]  that's why peter goes so straight to the source of these people funding the problem in the first
[03:03:23.900 --> 03:03:29.420]  leg like ross soros why he don't have a special kid to lock his ass up and the people that are
[03:03:29.420 --> 03:03:36.300]  doing this stuff well you know what it is soros is high level globalist cia so he's got all the
[03:03:36.300 --> 03:03:42.300]  dirt he helped over the summer union so he knows where all the bodies are buried and so if we try
[03:03:42.300 --> 03:03:45.740]  to do that he'll expose the bunch of people in government that's why everybody's going after
[03:03:45.740 --> 03:03:49.820]  trump not that trump did anything wrong but if trump goes after them they'll expose all the
[03:03:49.820 --> 03:03:53.500]  other corrupt people i just say let's just get it all out in the open what do you think barns
[03:03:53.500 --> 03:03:58.140]  i mean i think there's a lot of allegations concerning george soros manipulation of currencies
[03:03:58.140 --> 03:04:03.580]  he's gotten rich off of arguably manipulating currencies and manipulating politics uh can
[03:04:03.580 --> 03:04:08.700]  i close my eyes though i think about him well i mean i think the nature of it he's george soros
[03:04:08.700 --> 03:04:14.780]  sexual sorry i don't want to imagine that the uh so the there's certain things that are probably
[03:04:14.780 --> 03:04:19.980]  best beyond the imagination so the uh but yeah so i think soros is involved and it's like the
[03:04:19.980 --> 03:04:24.540]  coke brothers as tucker carlson called them out the other day that you have people who are billionaires
[03:04:24.540 --> 03:04:28.300]  who have political influence and have a long history of manipulating politics for their own
[03:04:28.300 --> 03:04:32.940]  political economic purposes and i think there's allegations of that concerning soros and there's
[03:04:32.940 --> 03:04:38.140]  no evidence that he's been meaningfully investigated but nobody can doubt he's a sexy man i think you
[03:04:38.140 --> 03:04:43.900]  know maybe some people but i have no comment i i'm into prunes i'm joking okay i'm being
[03:04:43.900 --> 03:04:49.020]  sarcastic yes yeah yeah he's Whitley taking us out one more segment calls and mike adams takes over
[03:04:49.020 --> 03:04:58.620]  matt jeff jason jerome jefferson get ready let it be the most banned network in the world
[03:04:58.620 --> 03:05:03.500]  so the info wars model is a self-fulfilling self-supporting structure that is promoting
[03:05:03.500 --> 03:05:08.380]  free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining
[03:05:08.380 --> 03:05:14.220]  one another it is the only independent press of this size and scale of this public reach it is the
[03:05:14.220 --> 03:05:19.420]  one model that says here's a way to have a self-supporting self-sustaining self-structured
[03:05:19.420 --> 03:05:24.060]  little d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up the
[03:05:24.060 --> 03:05:28.540]  audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting info wars
[03:05:28.540 --> 03:05:32.300]  and it's all because the audience spends there whatever it is whether it's five dollars or
[03:05:32.300 --> 03:05:36.460]  fifty dollars a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the
[03:05:36.460 --> 03:05:41.660]  corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press support speech
[03:05:41.660 --> 03:05:46.220]  support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold
[03:05:46.220 --> 03:05:51.340]  and it's the ultimate american democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free
[03:05:51.340 --> 03:06:00.780]  press and free speech with free markets
[03:06:01.740 --> 03:06:04.780]  alex joneshow

[03:07:52.860 --> 03:08:00.460]  that is social media and having a team of people monitor it and then have a whistleblower line
[03:08:00.460 --> 03:08:07.020]  that if something gets retweeted from directly from the president then it's uh it's reported back to him
[03:08:07.740 --> 03:08:12.620]  no i agree and and you know here's the deal i don't want to say trump's a megalomaniac or an
[03:08:12.620 --> 03:08:17.420]  egomaniac uh because he's not but he's definitely an alpha male he doesn't like seeing america getting
[03:08:17.420 --> 03:08:22.460]  pissed on so he has to get into the persona of fighting to do it i understand that that procedure
[03:08:22.460 --> 03:08:26.780]  i do that myself uh because it's a mission so you have to step into that office to
[03:08:26.780 --> 03:08:30.460]  charge up to do it you're not doing it for yourself but you're doing it for everybody but you better
[03:08:30.460 --> 03:08:37.180]  damn well be scary and powerful to get the job done uh but yeah no barnes has made this point
[03:08:37.180 --> 03:08:42.060]  it's true whenever trump learned that they were specifically banning us so he wouldn't support
[03:08:42.060 --> 03:08:47.420]  trump he took that as a personal thing and banned you when they banned my name i'm kind of butchering
[03:08:47.420 --> 03:08:52.620]  this that's the same thing now when trump understands hey google particularly says you're
[03:08:52.620 --> 03:08:57.660]  going to lose he understands they're gunning for him and and you know before he's like all
[03:08:57.660 --> 03:09:02.220]  their pathetic i'll defeat them but now he gets no really they're already beating you buddy so
[03:09:02.220 --> 03:09:06.860]  stop denying it go after him i no doubt i mean it was a major mistake on google's part to a
[03:09:06.860 --> 03:09:11.660]  particular to personalize it and to admit that and it was a great achievement of james oakief
[03:09:11.660 --> 03:09:16.060]  and project veritas to make it clear to the president that this is about him it's it's
[03:09:16.060 --> 03:09:21.340]  broader than him it's not only about him but it's also clearly specifically targeting him
[03:09:21.340 --> 03:09:26.220]  and that put a degree of awakeness and alertness that's necessary and to the caller's question
[03:09:26.220 --> 03:09:31.980]  the white house has established a petition online so that people can report any degree of social
[03:09:31.980 --> 03:09:37.500]  media censorship social media manipulation and the caller's right the president should
[03:09:37.500 --> 03:09:43.020]  reinstigate that should reinitiate it should remind people of it should expand its scope to apply
[03:09:43.020 --> 03:09:48.140]  to election meddling to false news stories being promoted to people being recommended for example
[03:09:48.140 --> 03:09:52.620]  just on twitter when senator cruz and a few other people noted that they were being recommended
[03:09:52.620 --> 03:09:57.420]  solely liberal people and i made the same point the next day all of a sudden twitter was doing
[03:09:57.420 --> 03:10:01.020]  honest recommendation that's right they know when they're being watched they change we pointed out
[03:10:01.020 --> 03:10:05.340]  that google for months was only listing negative about me so they changed for a while only because
[03:10:05.340 --> 03:10:13.500]  they're under investigation and i want to be clear about this we have got to get trump to go after
[03:10:13.500 --> 03:10:18.300]  them completely because look i'm going to let out some inside baseball here because the democrats
[03:10:18.300 --> 03:10:23.420]  all know this the audience needs to know it okay so i'm not speaking out of turn here there's not
[03:10:23.420 --> 03:10:27.740]  some big conspiracy against the left they have a conspiracy against us that's forcing us to get
[03:10:27.740 --> 03:10:32.860]  organized so i'm going to tell people a big story here the white house knew about what veritas was
[03:10:32.860 --> 03:10:38.780]  going to release a month ago and the white house knows what's coming next and you don't just think
[03:10:38.780 --> 03:10:46.380]  okieff now is doing this on his own uh no ladies and gentlemen so okieff is highly respected his
[03:10:46.380 --> 03:10:52.780]  crew is highly respected there are great infiltrators and trump is doling all this out i want to say
[03:10:52.780 --> 03:10:58.140]  the president i know you're smart i respect you but we don't have time to marinate these states
[03:10:58.140 --> 03:11:03.580]  before they're put on the grill we need to stop the censorship now we need to go after them now
[03:11:03.580 --> 03:11:07.420]  i understand you want to make it a big campaign issue and then fry them during the middle of the
[03:11:07.420 --> 03:11:12.540]  election and point out that they're the ones that are meddling not the Russians i get it i think you
[03:11:12.540 --> 03:11:19.660]  shoot when the powders tribe you can see the lights their eyes they're on top of us running daggers
[03:11:19.660 --> 03:11:24.860]  into us we're not shooting at them at 200 yards politically they're on top of us we're in hand
[03:11:24.860 --> 03:11:31.580]  to hand combat here and so i know you've been tricked into because your your bureaucrats are scared
[03:11:31.580 --> 03:11:37.180]  of google i don't want to take action oh just wait sir we've got them yes wait have these summits and
[03:11:37.180 --> 03:11:43.100]  have the attorney generals and do all this no you must act now no doubt i think the president believed
[03:11:43.100 --> 03:11:48.300]  he slightly underestimated them the way he did uh big uh the deep state so the molar investigation
[03:11:48.300 --> 03:11:52.220]  he initially thought well look they'll realize i'm innocent this is complete nonsense this is
[03:11:52.220 --> 03:11:57.260]  gibberish it'll be done within any start go on for two years manipulated to get past the elections
[03:11:57.260 --> 03:12:02.540]  to help influence the elections and this is bigger than russia gate i think clearly censorship
[03:12:02.540 --> 03:12:07.820]  rush against the distraction no doubt it was always a fake story everybody knew it was always a fake
[03:12:07.820 --> 03:12:11.900]  story the only thing that can prevent his reelection is big tech election meddling and manipulation
[03:12:11.900 --> 03:12:16.220]  that's it as long as he gets ahead of the curve on that and i think he's just been slow to the
[03:12:16.220 --> 03:12:20.620]  wake up he thought look they'll do the economically rational thing they'll do the business smart thing
[03:12:20.620 --> 03:12:24.860]  i'll i'll you know stir up a hornet's nest and they'll realize they need to back down and instead
[03:12:24.860 --> 03:12:28.620]  all they did was go up another notch and go up another notch and go up another notch he does
[03:12:28.620 --> 03:12:33.180]  recognize that certain people only respect power it's like the google lady says she's the head of
[03:12:33.180 --> 03:12:37.340]  censorship she says congress will try to stop us we're not going to stop exactly we'll remove
[03:12:37.340 --> 03:12:41.820]  your ass then they committed perjury last year blatantly openly and brazenly in front of the
[03:12:41.820 --> 03:12:46.780]  world and look at this chicken neck twit she's an authoritarian witch that thinks she's going to
[03:12:46.780 --> 03:12:51.900]  squat on us and piss on us no you're not lady and she was so at ease with her discussion and
[03:12:51.900 --> 03:12:56.540]  conversation she i mean it exposed the degree to which they are truly committed well how the
[03:12:56.540 --> 03:13:02.060]  she's in a public place bragging about overthrowing elections exactly and this is wow and this is in
[03:13:02.060 --> 03:13:05.980]  the first time they've been caught in some manner and twitter was caught other people have been caught
[03:13:05.980 --> 03:13:11.260]  by project veritas so this was just the key this is the biggest election meddling influencer
[03:13:11.260 --> 03:13:15.980]  because they own all of google which is 92 of all searches and they own all of youtube which is
[03:13:15.980 --> 03:13:21.260]  over 75 of all video searches and she thinks she's sitting in san francisco around a bunch of
[03:13:21.260 --> 03:13:25.900]  you know men that have had their testicles cut off surgically that she's safe no you're not witch
[03:13:25.900 --> 03:13:31.500]  all right thank you jeff now let's go ahead and talk to jason in new mexico here on the earth
[03:13:31.500 --> 03:13:38.700]  robert barnes with he's ready for war mike adams in the bullpen about to rage forth go ahead uh
[03:13:38.700 --> 03:13:45.820]  jason thank you for taking my call can you hear me yes sir go ahead okay good deal um he who controls
[03:13:45.820 --> 03:13:50.220]  the law excuse me he could who controls the language controls the law and the learning
[03:13:50.220 --> 03:13:55.180]  and in regards to the censorship and what google has done originally i was calling to see what
[03:13:55.180 --> 03:14:00.380]  happened to the um the footage that you did regarding the obama deception too but then as i'm
[03:14:00.380 --> 03:14:05.900]  listening to you guys i started to wonder did google will actually you know in facebook all of this
[03:14:05.900 --> 03:14:12.460]  did they do that to help obama actually get elected back to 2008 because he came out of nowhere
[03:14:12.460 --> 03:14:19.180]  and if they could like they say program people to like somebody or you know suggest um i guess
[03:14:19.180 --> 03:14:22.860]  insights or things of that nature oh you're right google admits that internal emails came out
[03:14:22.860 --> 03:14:29.260]  looking like that they installed obama but again the system did by running mccain and romney against
[03:14:29.260 --> 03:14:33.900]  him it was even more fixed than that well in and facebook admitted they had special meetings with
[03:14:33.900 --> 03:14:38.780]  the obama 2008 campaign committee and that was their great shock they thought social media would
[03:14:38.780 --> 03:14:44.540]  be leveraged by big tech in favor of the same cultural social political left that dominates
[03:14:44.540 --> 03:14:49.820]  those industries and they were shocked to see trump reverse the script because trump sort of followed
[03:14:49.820 --> 03:14:55.420]  the info wars template and remodeled that across the social media space and was able to break into
[03:14:55.420 --> 03:15:00.140]  the political spectrum in the political scene and defeat both the deep state and big tech using big
[03:15:00.140 --> 03:15:05.420]  tech's own weapons that's right so where do you think this is going jason well it's clear like you
[03:15:05.420 --> 03:15:10.860]  said earlier they they have declared open war against the american people and not only just
[03:15:10.860 --> 03:15:16.940]  american people but american companies american business um if they have the power to influence
[03:15:16.940 --> 03:15:23.340]  what you think mr dones what you can say or classify you with broad brush saying oh hate speech well
[03:15:23.340 --> 03:15:28.540]  now they're bigger than any government and any like you say any country they have more money than
[03:15:28.540 --> 03:15:33.980]  these countries so how do we remove them let's shut them all down because they have declared war
[03:15:33.980 --> 03:15:39.180]  or not just american people but our ideas our principles i agree guys get jason's number if

[03:17:57.900 --> 03:18:02.380]  to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city
[03:18:02.380 --> 03:18:06.700]  and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the
[03:18:06.700 --> 03:18:11.740]  neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[03:18:11.740 --> 03:18:16.460]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if
[03:18:16.460 --> 03:18:20.060]  trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he could be
[03:18:20.060 --> 03:18:24.060]  defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the
[03:18:24.060 --> 03:18:28.300]  last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements
[03:18:28.300 --> 03:18:32.860]  have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old i'd love to see what
[03:18:32.860 --> 03:18:37.820]  you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war you
[03:18:37.820 --> 03:18:42.780]  won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are gonna
[03:18:42.780 --> 03:18:47.340]  continue we're gonna keep fighting in the info war and even if something does happen to you or your
[03:18:47.340 --> 03:18:52.780]  show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank you sir for calling
[03:18:52.780 --> 03:18:59.580]  info wars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack
[03:18:59.580 --> 03:19:05.180]  the last year or so it's it's it's orwellian it's it's biblical it's it's authoritarian it's insane
[03:19:05.740 --> 03:19:12.060]  and i keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time to have to stumble up on deck as the
[03:19:12.060 --> 03:19:17.900]  captain of this operation and say hey we're sinking i've begged for your support before and thanks
[03:19:17.900 --> 03:19:22.620]  for keeping us afloat but this is the real sos if you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the
[03:19:22.620 --> 03:19:28.300]  word and keep fighting info wars will be shut down not just crippled and so we've reached that point
[03:19:28.860 --> 03:19:32.940]  it'll make the enemy happy but you know whatever we have with stood so many of their attacks
[03:19:32.940 --> 03:19:37.900]  we've gone through so much because of your support you have you have been there but let me tell you
[03:19:37.900 --> 03:19:42.620]  they are pissed they haven't been successful and they're giving us their full assault so we need
[03:19:42.620 --> 03:19:48.780]  your prayers your financial support and your word of mouth now at info warshore.com it's your fight

[03:20:10.140 --> 03:20:16.780]  we now take you live to the central texas command center and the heart of the resistance
[03:20:16.780 --> 03:20:22.060]  it's mike adams you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:24.860 --> 03:20:29.740]  all right welcome back to the fourth hour of the alex jones show mike adams stepping in here
[03:20:29.740 --> 03:20:36.380]  for the rest of this hour with additional analysis of the censorship catastrophe that is taking place
[03:20:36.380 --> 03:20:43.260]  the suppression and oppression of the freedom to think and the freedom to speak now it's been an
[03:20:43.260 --> 03:20:51.820]  amazing couple of days america owes a great amount of gratitude to james o' keith and project veritas
[03:20:51.820 --> 03:20:57.820]  he is i mean trump should give him the congressional or the i mean i'm sorry the presidential
[03:20:58.540 --> 03:21:02.940]  medal of some of some kind i mean i understand he's not a military combat person but as a
[03:21:02.940 --> 03:21:08.940]  journalist he deserves some kind of presidential recognition for his work because it's extraordinary
[03:21:08.940 --> 03:21:16.300]  and he is outdoing virtually every other journalist in america today with his investigations there are
[03:21:16.300 --> 03:21:20.940]  many other notable journalists who are also doing wonderful work sarah carter uh john solomon the
[03:21:20.940 --> 03:21:26.380]  entire info wars crew many independent media investigators and so on but james o' keith
[03:21:26.380 --> 03:21:33.180]  just stands apart with his investigation because what he has uncovered is so extraordinary the
[03:21:33.180 --> 03:21:37.820]  realization is so extraordinary that i've got to bring you this additional analysis and suggest
[03:21:37.820 --> 03:21:44.940]  some actions that i believe president trump must take in order to restore fairness and freedom of
[03:21:44.940 --> 03:21:51.100]  speech to all americans now these are my own recommendations i do not speak on behalf of
[03:21:51.100 --> 03:21:57.420]  info wars with these suggestions or or alex jones this is my own personal view which of course
[03:21:57.420 --> 03:22:04.460]  will be attacked but here's what i think i think that since google has been engaged in election
[03:22:04.460 --> 03:22:12.140]  meddling since at least 2017 let's say january of 2017 when they decided to clamp down on all
[03:22:12.140 --> 03:22:17.740]  conservative speech and they decided internally we now know because of uh genji and i and others
[03:22:17.740 --> 03:22:22.380]  speaking out sometimes not knowing they were being recorded we now know that google was
[03:22:22.380 --> 03:22:27.100]  conspiring to make sure that trump could never be elected again or anyone like trump could never
[03:22:27.100 --> 03:22:33.660]  be elected again and they've been doing this suppressing elections suppressing our republic
[03:22:33.660 --> 03:22:39.340]  destroying democracy they've been doing this for over two years i believe that president trump
[03:22:39.340 --> 03:22:46.380]  should seize the google dot com domain name and put google in a penalty box for two years for every
[03:22:46.380 --> 03:22:51.660]  year that google has been engaged in election meddling and the suppression of free speech google
[03:22:51.660 --> 03:22:57.660]  should serve a penalty for an equal duration of time so i believe again president trump should
[03:22:57.660 --> 03:23:04.380]  order the state department or the doj to seize google dot com for two years which means shutting
[03:23:04.380 --> 03:23:10.220]  down all google services for the next two years as a penalty for their efforts to carry out a
[03:23:10.220 --> 03:23:16.460]  massive criminal coup a criminal conspiracy against this republic against the united states
[03:23:16.460 --> 03:23:22.860]  they tried to overthrow our president they have suppressed the basic human rights of the american
[03:23:22.860 --> 03:23:28.300]  people the right to speak the right to think the right to read or share or watch something
[03:23:28.300 --> 03:23:35.180]  is a basic human right you know you've got aoc crying at the border with her staged uh photo op
[03:23:35.180 --> 03:23:41.500]  you know tears and everything and she's crying about human rights what about the human rights of
[03:23:41.500 --> 03:23:49.100]  us in america who are being suppressed and mentally caged every single day by google
[03:23:49.100 --> 03:23:55.100]  and facebook and twitter and youtube and the other tech giants that must be stopped and it
[03:23:55.100 --> 03:24:00.780]  is time in my opinion for president trump to order the seizure of those domain names on a
[03:24:00.780 --> 03:24:06.140]  temporary basis only for the duration of time those companies have engaged in this massive
[03:24:06.140 --> 03:24:11.980]  conspiracy to meddle in us elections because remember we heard from the media for the last
[03:24:11.980 --> 03:24:18.620]  two years that it's horrific that they say russia meddled with elections and they say that must be
[03:24:18.620 --> 03:24:22.860]  stopped and and robert muller even issued criminal indictments against some russian companies that
[03:24:22.860 --> 03:24:29.100]  ran a few thousand dollars worth of ads on facebook at one point but the left says it's wrong to
[03:24:29.100 --> 03:24:34.140]  meddling us elections and i agree that is wrong what about when google does it and google admits
[03:24:34.140 --> 03:24:39.180]  they've been doing it or at least their their executives admit it shouldn't those people
[03:24:39.180 --> 03:24:45.180]  be criminally indicted in the same way that robert muller indicted the russians for committing
[03:24:45.180 --> 03:24:49.900]  massive fraud that's in robert muller's words committing a fraud against the united states of
[03:24:49.900 --> 03:24:55.020]  america hasn't google committed fraud against the united states of america hasn't facebook done the
[03:24:55.020 --> 03:25:00.220]  same thing hasn't twitter done the same thing why isn't jack dorsi being indicted and arrested and
[03:25:00.220 --> 03:25:07.180]  prosecuted for criminal fraud why aren't the ceo's and top managers of google like like this gen gen
[03:25:07.180 --> 03:25:12.860]  i character why isn't she being prosecuted indicted charged with carrying out a massive
[03:25:12.860 --> 03:25:18.460]  fraud against the united states of america because in my view they have clearly engaged in that behavior
[03:25:18.460 --> 03:25:24.300]  and it must be prosecuted it must be stopped now perhaps trump is getting to that point
[03:25:24.300 --> 03:25:30.620]  eventually but i agree with what alex jones said earlier and robert barnes as well trump cannot
[03:25:31.340 --> 03:25:37.420]  sit on his laurels here and just wait he cannot be slow to the
[03:25:37.420 --> 03:25:45.900]  the we the people are being suppressed and cut off every single day we are having our
[03:25:45.900 --> 03:25:51.580]  speech rights destroyed we are being economically sabotaged every day the president will not win
[03:25:51.580 --> 03:25:58.140]  re-election if these tech giants are allowed to continue suppressing the basic human rights
[03:25:58.140 --> 03:26:06.300]  of the american people so that's again that's my view on that issue it's time to seize those
[03:26:06.300 --> 03:26:10.940]  domain names and put them in the penalty box for two years and show them that you cannot
[03:26:10.940 --> 03:26:20.220]  violate the rights of the american people now moving on i warned many months ago that the
[03:26:20.220 --> 03:26:26.620]  censorship was going to target not just political speech but that it was going to target natural
[03:26:26.620 --> 03:26:33.580]  health speech that anyone who talked about organics or clean food or anti-cancer foods natural
[03:26:33.580 --> 03:26:39.340]  remedies nutritional supplements anything of this kind that those individuals and those websites
[03:26:39.340 --> 03:26:46.300]  would also be targeted and terminated with extreme censorship and that is exactly what has happened
[03:26:46.860 --> 03:26:53.340]  and i want to mention monday dr mercola he put out a warning on mercola dot com
[03:26:54.140 --> 03:27:01.020]  that google has destroyed 99 percent of his search engine traffic we cover a story on that on natural
[03:27:01.020 --> 03:27:09.340]  news we cited joseph mercola dr mercola and his what you can only call extreme frustration with
[03:27:09.340 --> 03:27:17.580]  google uh i i know dr mercola i know he has spent many many years investing in a pay-per-click
[03:27:17.580 --> 03:27:23.500]  advertising he's invested in the high quality content to attract readers and viewers to his
[03:27:23.500 --> 03:27:30.060]  website through organic search engine results his website used to be some of the top rankings for
[03:27:30.060 --> 03:27:35.180]  searches like type 2 diabetes or heart disease it's very difficult to get top rankings for those
[03:27:35.180 --> 03:27:41.900]  terms uh in fact um excuse me mercola dot com had uh very prominent rankings across all health
[03:27:41.900 --> 03:27:49.100]  topics well that has been destroyed by google so google has committed economic sabotage against
[03:27:49.100 --> 03:27:55.980]  mercola dot com in the the exact same way google has committed sabotage against natural news or info
[03:27:55.980 --> 03:28:01.980]  wars or any other person and there were a lot of people out there for a long time who said oh
[03:28:01.980 --> 03:28:07.660]  they're just going to target you for being a trump supporter or i was told we're being targeted
[03:28:08.220 --> 03:28:15.980]  because we oppose a transgender predators who are trying to indoctrinate children i was told
[03:28:15.980 --> 03:28:21.340]  many times by many different people stop talking about transgenderism and you'll have your speech
[03:28:21.340 --> 03:28:26.140]  restored you won't be banned of course i said no way i'm not going to stop talking about it because
[03:28:26.140 --> 03:28:31.980]  that's child abuse it's child mutilations i cannot be silent on this issue i want to protect children
[03:28:31.980 --> 03:28:38.220]  but the truth is google and facebook and twitter are coming after everybody who's talking about
[03:28:38.220 --> 03:28:47.020]  healthy living nutrition gmo's vaccines anti-cancer foods all these topics everybody's being targeted

[03:31:58.460 --> 03:32:03.500]  square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[03:32:03.500 --> 03:32:08.300]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not backed by some billionaire
[03:32:08.300 --> 03:32:12.220]  that's not being funded by secrets foreign government it is completely independent of all
[03:32:12.220 --> 03:32:17.660]  that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom
[03:32:17.660 --> 03:32:21.980]  of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning
[03:32:21.980 --> 03:32:26.700]  of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because
[03:32:26.700 --> 03:32:30.380]  this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've
[03:32:30.380 --> 03:32:34.460]  mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to
[03:32:34.460 --> 03:32:39.740]  control and manipulate what news and views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and
[03:32:39.740 --> 03:32:44.700]  the info wars audience has broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to
[03:32:44.700 --> 03:32:49.180]  the modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[03:32:49.180 --> 03:32:53.580]  onslaught of the platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you

[03:34:59.180 --> 03:35:03.820]  three years by the way should be very interesting so those are that's a little rundown of some
[03:35:03.820 --> 03:35:09.260]  things that are going on right now got a lot to share with you continuing with our topic of
[03:35:09.260 --> 03:35:16.060]  censorship we've got there's a there's a bombshell article that was published today by seyer g on
[03:35:16.060 --> 03:35:22.700]  green med info dot com and seyer did some research into what's happening with google and its suppression
[03:35:23.340 --> 03:35:30.620]  of truth about health information and vaccines and in the same way that google's search
[03:35:30.620 --> 03:35:36.060]  suggestions are being programmed by social justice warriors basically they're weaponizing
[03:35:36.060 --> 03:35:42.540]  the ai system to target conservatives and block any information that might harm a democrat or
[03:35:42.540 --> 03:35:47.980]  help a conservative they're also doing the same thing with vaccines so a normal question that
[03:35:47.980 --> 03:35:54.300]  people might have is do vaccines cause autism it's one of the most popular searches for vaccines
[03:35:54.300 --> 03:36:00.460]  well google has suppressed that search and instead of it saying do vaccines cause autism when you
[03:36:00.460 --> 03:36:05.180]  start to type in do vaccines cause you get all kinds of other things but not autism because the
[03:36:05.180 --> 03:36:14.620]  word autism has been suppressed the cdc is running a propaganda indoctrination program the cdc is
[03:36:15.260 --> 03:36:21.500]  really the vaccine deep state they are the most corrupt branch of the federal government today
[03:36:21.500 --> 03:36:28.860]  even worse than the fda worse than the epa the cdc is actually run by a dark deep state branch of
[03:36:28.860 --> 03:36:34.540]  the military top cdc officials dressed up in military uniforms and they refer to each other
[03:36:34.540 --> 03:36:43.660]  in military terms the cdc trains social engineers basically cia type of operatives working inside
[03:36:43.660 --> 03:36:49.820]  the cdc we saw this with the ebola outbreak and all the propaganda that was pushed the cdc also
[03:36:49.820 --> 03:36:55.900]  has a partner program where they partner with companies and they pay money to different groups
[03:36:55.900 --> 03:37:04.060]  to plant pro vaccine information or to halt vaccine skepticism across all culture and all media for
[03:37:04.060 --> 03:37:11.580]  example mail chip which has banned the green mat info email sending you can't send an email that
[03:37:11.580 --> 03:37:19.100]  questions the safety of vaccines because mail chimp is a cdc partner and to be a cdc partner you
[03:37:19.100 --> 03:37:26.220]  have to agree to quote defer to the cdc on all issues of science and medicine health and public
[03:37:26.220 --> 03:37:33.660]  safety which means you agree to be a puppet of the cdc so mail chimp which is also located near
[03:37:33.660 --> 03:37:39.900]  atlanta by the way which is where the cdc is based mail chimp is part of this propaganda
[03:37:39.900 --> 03:37:46.700]  indoctrination system and you may recall mail chimp banned info wars i think it was last year
[03:37:46.700 --> 03:37:52.860]  when it was the big you know of online ethnic cleansing against info wars and alex jones mail
[03:37:52.860 --> 03:38:00.620]  chimp was part of that but disney is also a partner of the cdc so disney is pushing pro vaccine
[03:38:00.620 --> 03:38:05.900]  propaganda we also know that google and we know that twitter and other tech giants like facebook
[03:38:05.900 --> 03:38:11.420]  are also working hand in hand with pharmaceutical companies and here are a couple other facts on
[03:38:11.420 --> 03:38:18.460]  this that you need to know google has partnered with glauco smith kline google for years has banned
[03:38:19.020 --> 03:38:24.460]  natural supplement ads on their network for various specific supplements and they promoted
[03:38:25.180 --> 03:38:30.540]  pharmaceutical monopolies to promote the profits of the big pharma companies in the united states
[03:38:30.540 --> 03:38:37.100]  by also banning ads from canadian pharmacies or mexican pharmacies that sell the same exact
[03:38:37.100 --> 03:38:43.180]  chemicals for a fraction of the monopoly prices that are that you have to pay in the united states
[03:38:43.180 --> 03:38:48.700]  so google has been not only running its own information monopoly on political issues and
[03:38:48.700 --> 03:38:53.820]  trying to overthrow the united states and trying to brainwash the public they have also been
[03:38:53.820 --> 03:38:59.820]  enhancing and supporting and promoting big pharma monopolies they have been limiting free market
[03:38:59.820 --> 03:39:06.300]  competition they have been shutting down all speech that questions the pharmaceutical cartels
[03:39:06.940 --> 03:39:13.740]  google has been putting human lives in danger by suppressing natural health information and
[03:39:13.740 --> 03:39:21.980]  promoting dangerous toxic medications so again i come back to aoc crying at the border hey aoc
[03:39:21.980 --> 03:39:27.260]  why aren't you crying for all the american people that are being murdered by the pharma cartels
[03:39:27.260 --> 03:39:34.540]  that are being promoted by the google monopolies and the propagandists who run the tech giants aoc
[03:39:34.540 --> 03:39:40.860]  her tears are staged for only a specific purpose but she doesn't love americans she doesn't love
[03:39:40.860 --> 03:39:46.060]  american children as far as aoc is concerned american children can go to hell because she
[03:39:46.060 --> 03:39:51.500]  only cares about children who are not yet americans but she wants them to come in and be
[03:39:51.500 --> 03:39:56.860]  given driver's licenses eventually and be given the right to vote but she won't speak out against
[03:39:56.860 --> 03:40:01.820]  the censorship and the oppression of speech by the tech giants and this is why i have called for
[03:40:01.820 --> 03:40:06.780]  such drastic action to stop the tech giants i've even called for president trump to go ahead and
[03:40:06.780 --> 03:40:14.060]  invoke the insurrection act issue military police arrests of the tech giants ceo's who have now we
[03:40:14.060 --> 03:40:20.300]  know it's been confirmed thanks to project veritas who have conspired to alter the election outcomes
[03:40:20.300 --> 03:40:25.020]  in the united states of america and i just want to say if we don't stop google we will never
[03:40:25.020 --> 03:40:33.180]  have human freedom again we will find ourselves living under an authoritarian techno dictatorship
[03:40:33.180 --> 03:40:41.420]  run by liberal techno fascists that's google and they are unapologetic in what they are doing
[03:40:41.420 --> 03:40:48.380]  they openly brag about it in public in restaurants and other places they believe that they have the
[03:40:48.380 --> 03:40:55.820]  right to control what you are allowed to see or speak they believe that they are that they have
[03:40:55.820 --> 03:41:04.140]  almost a divine right of kings to dictate to you and all american people what we are allowed to see
[03:41:04.140 --> 03:41:11.020]  or speak or read or share or post it's it's a shame and it has to be stopped or humans will
[03:41:11.020 --> 03:41:18.780]  never be free again so the window of allowable speech is collapsing we will soon if we do not
[03:41:18.780 --> 03:41:24.460]  stop this we will soon wake up in a world where you will not be able to criticize any democrat
[03:41:24.460 --> 03:41:31.580]  without being labeled hate speech and being deplatformed so hate speech in the definition
[03:41:31.580 --> 03:41:37.580]  of leftist is anything that makes a democrat look bad hate speech is anything that criticizes
[03:41:37.580 --> 03:41:46.220]  a left-wing person but love according to the left or compassion is stabbing your baby with a scalpel
[03:41:46.220 --> 03:41:52.220]  until it dies love and compassion according to leftists is slicing off the genitalia of your
[03:41:52.220 --> 03:41:58.220]  baby infant boy because you are an insane transgender parent who wants to turn your baby boy into a
[03:41:58.220 --> 03:42:02.780]  baby girl and as you're stabbing and slicing away that's all being done according to the left in the
[03:42:02.780 --> 03:42:09.100]  name of love and compassion and inclusiveness because they are mentally insane they are psychopaths
[03:42:09.100 --> 03:42:15.340]  they are sociopaths they belong in insane asylums and yet they are running the ai systems of google
[03:42:15.980 --> 03:42:22.300]  they are determining what is a fact and what is not a fact these insane deranged child mutilating
[03:42:23.180 --> 03:42:31.260]  pathetic anti-american monsters are running the speech codes of our society and they must be stopped
[03:42:31.260 --> 03:42:36.380]  this must be opposed in every way possible call your senators call your members of congress call
[03:42:36.380 --> 03:42:43.420]  your state attorneys general and demand the section 230 be revoked and demand lawsuits
[03:42:43.420 --> 03:42:48.220]  against the tech giants to restore free speech to all americans i'll be back with more here on the
[03:42:48.220 --> 03:42:57.580]  alex jones show in the 40 years that i've been in american politics i've never seen a situation
[03:42:57.580 --> 03:43:03.900]  with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters the false
[03:43:03.900 --> 03:43:11.500]  claim that you purposely sent kitty porn to the sandy hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as
[03:43:11.500 --> 03:43:17.660]  false it's a smear somebody sends you something that's encrypted you don't even open it it ends up
[03:43:17.660 --> 03:43:23.820]  swept up in the discovery of nine million documents and then it's blamed on you this is kafka esk
[03:43:23.820 --> 03:43:30.540]  this is bizarre but the way the mainstream media rushes out to say jones sent kitty porn is really
[03:43:30.540 --> 03:43:35.340]  outrageous i have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted
[03:43:35.340 --> 03:43:39.580]  and corrected and clarified but i wonder where the big boys where's the wall street journal
[03:43:39.580 --> 03:43:44.860]  where's associated press when are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said
[03:43:44.860 --> 03:43:51.420]  about you was inaccurate so we both need your help and i urge folks to continue to support info wars
[03:43:51.420 --> 03:43:56.780]  with your dollars well we're very very clear with everybody about all of this we're going into the
[03:43:56.780 --> 03:44:01.260]  season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega counts we have
[03:44:01.260 --> 03:44:05.420]  do their criminal activity and their and their digital fraud and we need to know that we've
[03:44:05.420 --> 03:44:10.780]  got capital to go six months a year we need the in here we need to be provisioned and you've got my
[03:44:10.780 --> 03:44:15.100]  total commitment that i am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly i'm loving
[03:44:15.100 --> 03:44:20.140]  every minute of this because i know i'm getting under their skin i'm bloody and then i'm up politically
[03:44:20.140 --> 03:44:24.620]  i'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies that just brings more
[03:44:24.620 --> 03:44:29.980]  people here so i'm in one hell of a fight so are you and i need war bonds i need gas i need ammo
[03:44:29.980 --> 03:44:34.540]  politically now but literally if you flood us with money and if you flood us with product
[03:44:34.540 --> 03:44:38.620]  purchases and if you flood us with your word of mouth you're unstoppable we're unstoppable together
[03:44:38.620 --> 03:44:42.300]  i want to send a strong message to the enemy i want to raise a couple million dollars right now
[03:44:42.300 --> 03:44:46.220]  to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us and i will
[03:44:46.220 --> 03:44:50.780]  never back down you have my commitment this only gives me more energy and more understanding of
[03:44:50.780 --> 03:44:57.740]  what we're facing and that we were right about this info wars and free speech and your right to
[03:44:57.740 --> 03:45:03.340]  speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so it's it's it's orwellian it's it's
[03:45:03.340 --> 03:45:09.900]  biblical it's it's authoritarian it's insane and i keep trying to judge engage when is the right time
[03:45:09.900 --> 03:45:16.380]  to have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say hey we're sinking i've beg
[03:45:16.380 --> 03:45:20.700]  for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat but this is the real sos if you don't buy
[03:45:20.700 --> 03:45:25.980]  a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting info wars will be shut down not just
[03:45:25.980 --> 03:45:30.940]  crippled and so we've reached that point it'll make the enemy happy but you know whatever we have
[03:45:30.940 --> 03:45:35.500]  with stood so many of their attacks we've gone through so much because of your support you have
[03:45:35.500 --> 03:45:40.300]  you have been there but let me tell you they are pissed they haven't been successful and they're
[03:45:40.300 --> 03:45:45.020]  giving us their full assault so we need your prayers your financial support and your word of
[03:45:45.020 --> 03:45:51.340]  mouth now at info wars.com it's your fight decide whether or not you want info wars to continue
[03:45:51.340 --> 03:45:57.980]  because we could be shut down i just want listeners understand money is what allows us to beat this
[03:45:57.980 --> 03:46:02.940]  and stand against this and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the save info wars 50% off
[03:46:02.940 --> 03:46:08.220]  but we make only like five ten dollars on higher marked up stuff we're making like two dollars on
[03:46:08.220 --> 03:46:12.620]  the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton of it okay but you move a couple hundred
[03:46:12.620 --> 03:46:16.220]  thousand dollars or something and you get twenty thousand dollars that doesn't pay for all the
[03:46:16.220 --> 03:46:19.820]  infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers the crew so we need to sell millions and millions and
[03:46:19.820 --> 03:46:24.460]  millions of dollars of product i want to expand not contract and for six months we've not just
[03:46:24.460 --> 03:46:29.260]  going to stand still the enemy's been winning and i have labored and labored and labored and labored
[03:46:29.260 --> 03:46:33.020]  on this i like to be expanding i like to be winning i like to be fighting and we are winning the
[03:46:33.020 --> 03:46:37.820]  info war that's why we're so hated but we need to be retreaded we need to be tuned up we need to be
[03:46:37.820 --> 03:46:41.980]  fixed up we never have time to get in the drive up we got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy
[03:46:41.980 --> 03:46:47.340]  wants to silence us then they're really gonna plant child porn on us then they're gonna kill me or you
[03:46:47.340 --> 03:46:51.180]  or anybody else i mean the democrats now we're going into a full revolutionary fervor funded by
[03:46:51.180 --> 03:46:59.180]  foreign banks of the chicom show go to mfullworkstore.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:06.300 --> 03:47:13.580]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[03:47:13.580 --> 03:47:22.860]  it's mike adams to cover some financial issues here today because of what's coming
[03:47:23.580 --> 03:47:28.940]  things are so rapidly changing in the world both culturally politically we've got big tech
[03:47:28.940 --> 03:47:34.220]  censorship and so on but there's also all this leveraged debt in the world and you've seen others
[03:47:34.220 --> 03:47:40.940]  here like jerald salenti talk about the coming debt collapse it will be a cascading collapse
[03:47:40.940 --> 03:47:46.460]  going from central bank to central bank crushing derivatives and moving much more quickly than
[03:47:46.460 --> 03:47:52.140]  what you can respond to so with the caveat that of course i'm not your financial advisor and you
[03:47:52.140 --> 03:47:57.340]  should seek appropriate advice from a qualified professional i'm going to share with you
[03:47:57.340 --> 03:48:03.660]  a couple of thoughts because i'm into survival and preparedness on all the issues including
[03:48:03.660 --> 03:48:06.940]  finances i'm also going to talk about bitcoin here for a second because it's
[03:48:06.940 --> 03:48:13.100]  experienced a dramatic rise i think it went up 20% just last night it's in the $13,000 range
[03:48:13.100 --> 03:48:19.420]  right now so i'm going to offer you some comments on bitcoin as well as a mark of the beast you
[03:48:19.420 --> 03:48:25.740]  know mark zuckerberg cryptocurrency so first on the finance side if you're in the market right now
[03:48:26.540 --> 03:48:32.620]  make no mistake that the trump administration the central banks and everybody else who's invested
[03:48:32.620 --> 03:48:38.940]  in this debt pyramid is doing everything they can to prevent the market from crashing before the 2020
[03:48:38.940 --> 03:48:45.660]  election i'm convinced that if the market has a harsh correction a big crash you know 30 to 40%
[03:48:45.660 --> 03:48:51.980]  correction that could doom the trump re-election so everything is being done right now to keep
[03:48:51.980 --> 03:48:57.580]  that market propped up and they may be successful i've been surprised about how how successful
[03:48:57.580 --> 03:49:02.220]  they've been all these years in keeping it propped up and it's very difficult to say exactly when
[03:49:02.220 --> 03:49:08.860]  it's going to break but as i read on the website forgot which one recently if you're in stocks
[03:49:08.860 --> 03:49:15.500]  right now you're picking up nickels off the ground in front of a steamroller meaning that you might
[03:49:15.500 --> 03:49:20.300]  get small little profits here now because we're near the top of this bubble but there's a steam
[03:49:20.300 --> 03:49:26.140]  roller behind you and it's going to steamroll you at some point you could lose 30 to 40% of your
[03:49:26.140 --> 03:49:32.860]  principal so what's a good self-preservation type of strategy well i've studied this over the years
[03:49:32.860 --> 03:49:37.420]  and there are some very simple things and i think that people like Gerald Slendy would would agree
[03:49:37.420 --> 03:49:44.700]  with most of these as well number one if you want to stay semi liquid you can believe it or not go
[03:49:44.700 --> 03:49:51.100]  into 28 day treasuries you can purchase treasuries directly from the united states treasury i think
[03:49:51.100 --> 03:49:56.060]  it's called treasury direct you can do it you can link your bank account to it or you can link your
[03:49:56.060 --> 03:50:02.140]  corporate account to it and every 28 days it rolls over and puts it back into your bank account now
[03:50:02.140 --> 03:50:07.660]  you're buying treasuries in other words you're buying us dollar debt eventually the dollar is
[03:50:07.660 --> 03:50:12.940]  going to collapse but that's probably not going to happen right away we're going to see the market
[03:50:12.940 --> 03:50:21.100]  correct at some point catastrophically i believe but the treasury will continue to have value and
[03:50:21.100 --> 03:50:26.940]  viability for a long time because remember the treasury has something unique that stocks do not
[03:50:26.940 --> 03:50:34.460]  have the government can confiscate money from the american people at gunpoint yes confiscatory
[03:50:34.460 --> 03:50:43.020]  taxes the ability to tax actually gives long-term viability to the the dollar itself and i know
[03:50:43.020 --> 03:50:48.940]  it sounds evil and twisted and in many ways it really is but a government that has the power
[03:50:48.940 --> 03:50:55.340]  to steal from its citizens is less likely to have its currency crash in the short term eventually
[03:50:55.340 --> 03:51:00.460]  though the dollar does collapse as all fiat currencies do but that may be many years away it
[03:51:00.460 --> 03:51:06.460]  could even be decades away it's hard to tell but the the market i think is very near the top in many
[03:51:06.460 --> 03:51:14.540]  ways the tech bubble is here i warned about the dot com crash back in 1998 and 1999 warned people
[03:51:14.540 --> 03:51:20.620]  about that crash and i see conditions are just about the same here today and once again you have
[03:51:20.620 --> 03:51:27.580]  these sky high valuations of uber and slack and what all these tech companies that seem to have
[03:51:27.580 --> 03:51:33.580]  no real assets but they have multi-billion dollar valuations it doesn't make any sense and it will
[03:51:33.580 --> 03:51:40.700]  collapse so if you are exposed into those stocks i strongly urge you to practice some financial
[03:51:40.700 --> 03:51:46.700]  self-preservation some financial safety the second thing you can do that i strongly recommend is
[03:51:46.700 --> 03:51:53.500]  physical precious metals now i don't sell gold or silver there are many people who do perhaps some
[03:51:53.500 --> 03:52:01.260]  have been sponsors of info wars as well but find a reputable retailer silver in my opinion is vastly
[03:52:01.260 --> 03:52:10.060]  undervalued and when you have physical possession of silver you have a store of wealth and even compared
[03:52:10.060 --> 03:52:16.300]  to bitcoin and i'm going to say some some positive things about bitcoin and also some critical things
[03:52:16.300 --> 03:52:21.900]  about the current bitcoin bubble but compared if you compare silver to let's say any cryptocurrency
[03:52:21.900 --> 03:52:28.540]  what's the difference well when the power grid goes down cryptocurrency is worth nothing but
[03:52:28.540 --> 03:52:34.860]  silver still has value when silver compared to fiat currency when a fiat currency is hyper
[03:52:34.860 --> 03:52:38.620]  inflated as we are seeing we're starting to see more and more inflation and debasement of the
[03:52:38.620 --> 03:52:46.460]  currency the precious metals hold value now the mindset of purchasing silver and gold is to hold
[03:52:46.460 --> 03:52:52.380]  value and not lose money it's not about gaining profits if you want to gain profits and play
[03:52:52.380 --> 03:53:01.180]  roulette with the latest ipo stock you can throw all your money into a what a beyond meat or one
[03:53:01.180 --> 03:53:07.260]  of those other companies or uber or whatever and you can you can hope you do well but you're putting
[03:53:07.260 --> 03:53:13.100]  your money into something that isn't real it's a speculation when you buy gold and silver it's real
[03:53:13.100 --> 03:53:18.460]  it's physical you can hold it you have possession of it and it turns out and i say this as a as a
[03:53:18.460 --> 03:53:25.180]  laboratory scientist and we do heavy metals analysis all the time guess what gold au is an
[03:53:25.180 --> 03:53:30.140]  element on the table of elements gold isn't going anywhere it doesn't disappear even if you have a
[03:53:30.140 --> 03:53:36.540]  house fire your gold doesn't burn up it just melts and becomes melted gold your whole house could burn
[03:53:36.540 --> 03:53:43.100]  down and your your safe full of gold and silver let's say would just be melted gold and silver
[03:53:43.100 --> 03:53:46.700]  the value doesn't really change you might have to have it restamped into coins but it's still
[03:53:46.700 --> 03:53:52.220]  the same element it still has the same value whereas everything else that you could possibly invest in
[03:53:52.220 --> 03:53:58.380]  other than land which also holds value everything else like currency stocks and bonds or cryptocurrency
[03:53:58.380 --> 03:54:03.180]  you know fiat money all those other things can catastrophically fail doesn't mean they don't
[03:54:03.180 --> 03:54:09.500]  have their uses i understand the portability for example of bitcoin is very positive being able
[03:54:09.500 --> 03:54:14.380]  to transfer money or carry money essentially on a thumb drive in your pocket as you're moving
[03:54:14.380 --> 03:54:21.020]  across borders has intrinsic value and so cryptocurrency has its place but in terms of
[03:54:21.020 --> 03:54:29.260]  holding long-term value with very few risks precious metals and also land can't be beat now
[03:54:29.260 --> 03:54:34.700]  moving on to bitcoin i've been very critical of the bitcoin bubble in the past and warned about
[03:54:34.700 --> 03:54:40.700]  it crashing before it crashed from roughly 20 000 down to i think it went i don't know it was in the
[03:54:40.700 --> 03:54:51.820]  4 000 5 000 range for a long time now it's back up to 13 000 this is likely to it could go higher
[03:54:51.820 --> 03:54:57.820]  i'll say that but it will also correct again bitcoin has utility and bitcoin has been an
[03:54:57.820 --> 03:55:03.820]  excellent proof of concept and there there are values to it like i said portability and so on
[03:55:03.820 --> 03:55:08.140]  but i just want you to understand if you're buying into bitcoin or any cryptocurrency right now
[03:55:08.140 --> 03:55:13.740]  that's not a stable coin that is is not tied to the dollar or some other currency then you are
[03:55:13.740 --> 03:55:18.300]  playing a kind of russian roulette game with your investment it's okay to do that if you
[03:55:18.300 --> 03:55:23.500]  think you can beat everybody else but recognize that you are a speculator not an investor you're
[03:55:23.500 --> 03:55:29.580]  a speculator and the truth is that market is rigged the bitcoin market is rigged by the whales
[03:55:29.580 --> 03:55:36.380]  it's rigged by certain deep state players it is very difficult for a retail investor or a retail
[03:55:36.380 --> 03:55:43.340]  speculator to outmaneuver the real manipulators who are controlling that market so if you buy it
[03:55:43.340 --> 03:55:48.060]  invest at your own risk that's all i'm saying about that it could go much higher want to be on the
[03:55:48.060 --> 03:55:53.020]  record it it might go much higher but it's also going to be a wild ride as has been the history
[03:55:53.020 --> 03:56:00.300]  of bitcoin but it's been an excellent proof of concept and in a sad way it laid the groundwork
[03:56:00.300 --> 03:56:05.180]  to roll out the facebook mark of the beast cryptocurrency which was originally called global
[03:56:05.180 --> 03:56:11.580]  coin but is now i believe called libra coin and mark zuckerberg is being urged right now to tie it
[03:56:11.580 --> 03:56:18.380]  to a gold standard and of course if this were to become the dominant transaction currency then
[03:56:18.380 --> 03:56:23.500]  facebook would punish you using the social scoring system like communist china has that
[03:56:23.500 --> 03:56:27.980]  if you talk about something critical about transgenders or something critical about
[03:56:27.980 --> 03:56:33.900]  democrats or liberals you will be cut off from your wallet you won't be able to engage in transactions
[03:56:33.900 --> 03:56:39.820]  so you should never use the facebook cryptocurrency you're not going to make money at it you're only
[03:56:39.820 --> 03:56:45.340]  going to be controlled and tracked and surveilled the facebook cryptocurrency is the ultimate police
[03:56:45.340 --> 03:56:51.580]  states surveillance system using your purchases to track and build a psychological profile of
[03:56:51.580 --> 03:56:56.220]  who you are and combine it with everything that facebook is already monitoring about you all your
[03:56:56.220 --> 03:57:02.780]  friends all your photographs all your texts even all your offline behavior it is mark of the beast
[03:57:02.780 --> 03:57:09.580]  type stuff do not use it or you will be enslaved forever by the zuck and that's not a good place
[03:57:09.580 --> 03:57:15.260]  to be so anyway take all that advice with you know a grain of salt you can use it you can
[03:57:15.260 --> 03:57:20.460]  ignore it but think carefully about what is coming things are about to get really crazy in the world
[03:57:20.460 --> 03:57:25.580]  and i want you to be safe i want you to hold on to the the money that you've worked for i want you

[03:58:49.260 --> 03:58:53.420]  a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could
[03:58:53.420 --> 03:58:58.620]  tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying desperately
[03:58:58.620 --> 03:59:03.420]  to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in
[03:59:03.420 --> 03:59:08.380]  the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end
[03:59:08.380 --> 03:59:11.820]  of his presidency it's the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him
[03:59:11.820 --> 03:59:15.900]  it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just want to say alex is i
[03:59:15.900 --> 03:59:20.380]  know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man i would love to
[03:59:20.380 --> 03:59:24.380]  see you on air until you're 80 years old i'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80
[03:59:24.380 --> 03:59:30.300]  but if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are
[03:59:30.300 --> 03:59:34.540]  a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue we're going to keep fighting
