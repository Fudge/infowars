[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:34.560]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much
[00:34.560 --> 00:41.440]  for joining us on this Monday edition of the worldwide transmission we're going
[00:41.440 --> 00:46.840]  to be live here for the next three hours and I am surveying western areas of the
[00:46.840 --> 00:52.040]  United States to see for myself how much globalism and the tattletale
[00:52.040 --> 00:57.320]  control freak society has expanded I will have reports for you later in the
[00:57.320 --> 01:03.160]  hour on basically what I have witnessed while we have been out here I am now in
[01:03.160 --> 01:08.080]  southern Utah crossing over from the Grand Canyon in Arizona yesterday and
[01:08.080 --> 01:12.480]  I've already filed some of those video reports at info wars.com I'm gonna be
[01:12.480 --> 01:16.800]  filing more as soon as I can get to a spot that has good internet I am
[01:16.800 --> 01:24.440]  literally a hundred miles from nowhere as the Dwight Yocum song says in fact
[01:24.440 --> 01:28.960]  I'm probably 500 miles from nowhere and so all we've got is a landline that's
[01:28.960 --> 01:32.760]  another reason I'm engaging in this trip is that plan to travel around the
[01:32.760 --> 01:37.120]  country a lot next year giving speeches and visiting our AM and FM affiliates
[01:37.120 --> 01:41.440]  and just unfortunately we would try to go up on a mountain top of the RV and it
[01:41.440 --> 01:46.440]  just would not connect so we're here via landline we have quite a broadcast
[01:46.440 --> 01:52.680]  lined up for you today to say the very least and we are going to be breaking
[01:52.680 --> 01:56.920]  all that down here in just a moment and just the unbelievable quickening of
[01:56.920 --> 02:01.880]  what's happening we have Gerald Salente joining us with an update on what's
[02:01.880 --> 02:09.680]  happening with MF Global basically grabbing to somewhere between 700 and
[02:09.680 --> 02:15.240]  a billion dollars of their clients money and first saying JP Morgan had it now
[02:15.240 --> 02:19.160]  saying they don't know where it is and I guess the federal government because
[02:19.160 --> 02:24.560]  most the regulators including the head of the CFTC were invested with Mr. Corzine
[02:24.560 --> 02:27.880]  of course they all got the warning to get out early like they'd like the Coke
[02:27.880 --> 02:32.280]  brothers so this is a new level of where they just take the money out of your
[02:32.280 --> 02:36.360]  segregated personal account I've done some research those are supposedly
[02:36.360 --> 02:39.800]  guaranteed as well for another system but now they're saying no this is the new
[02:39.800 --> 02:44.000]  way things work we're taking your money so Gerald Salente is going to be
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.480]  joining us Jesse Ventura you got to get him all he's hot because he's about to
[02:47.480 --> 02:51.680]  go back to Mexico at least for a few months gonna be joining us we'll talk
[02:51.680 --> 02:56.000]  more about will he run for president I've now talked to libertarian party people
[02:56.000 --> 03:01.560]  they certainly would like to entertain that we also have Max Kaiser joining us
[03:01.560 --> 03:06.680]  about the importance of the MF Global fiasco and Info Wars nightly co-host
[03:06.680 --> 03:13.400]  nightly news co-host Aaron Dykes will also be in Austin Texas riding shotgun
[03:13.400 --> 03:19.400]  with us as backup in case I have any technical difficulties he'll also be
[03:19.400 --> 03:24.120]  adding quite a bit of his expert analysis in historical commentary the
[03:24.120 --> 03:28.120]  backstop we're covering here we're gonna go to break in a moment and I'll come
[03:28.120 --> 03:32.120]  back and run through the unbelievable developments but here's just some of them
[03:32.120 --> 03:37.680]  New York Times tries to blame political film for White House shooting guess what
[03:37.680 --> 03:44.400]  political film that's right the Obama deception continuing Egypt's brutal
[03:44.400 --> 03:50.040]  military junta is supported by Obama administration remember CIA Anderson
[03:50.040 --> 03:56.240]  Cooper oh it's so gracious to democracy and in Egypt as they kicked out the old
[03:56.240 --> 04:00.760]  dictator who wasn't brutal enough and now just machine gun people in mass and
[04:00.760 --> 04:04.800]  beat their heads in and the Egyptian military is saying look at the police in
[04:04.800 --> 04:09.640]  America they shoot and kill people so now America is an example of evil not an
[04:09.640 --> 04:16.520]  example of good continuing if there's a run on the banks know who to blame by
[04:16.520 --> 04:21.360]  Paul Joseph Watson I asked Paul to write that article last night because I
[04:21.360 --> 04:26.320]  discovered Forbes in a big article on us a few days ago with the headline talk
[04:26.320 --> 04:31.200]  show host and guest talk show host Alex Jones and guest call for run on banks
[04:31.200 --> 04:36.440]  what we said is the globalists are gonna pick people off one by one and steal
[04:36.440 --> 04:41.040]  your bank accounts outright also put all these crazy fines and fees on it and
[04:41.040 --> 04:45.040]  so what MF global and others are doing is going to destroy confidence that's
[04:45.040 --> 04:48.080]  already happening with people getting their money out of the big mega banks
[04:48.080 --> 04:52.360]  we'll be right back after the break is an incredibly jam packed transmission I'm
[04:52.360 --> 04:56.040]  Alex Jones person planet.tv
[04:56.040 --> 05:03.480]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[05:03.480 --> 05:07.840]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:07.840 --> 05:12.000]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.040]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[05:16.040 --> 05:19.880]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[05:19.880 --> 05:24.160]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[05:24.160 --> 05:28.360]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[05:28.360 --> 05:32.680]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[05:32.680 --> 05:36.400]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[05:36.400 --> 05:40.600]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[05:40.600 --> 05:43.960]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[08:04.520 --> 08:12.320]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:12.320 --> 08:19.800]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.800 --> 08:23.400]  alex jones
[08:26.600 --> 08:30.960]  welcome my friends welcome folks listening all across the world on xm
[08:30.960 --> 08:39.040]  satellite global fort wake w okay we have some kind of technical issue alex
[08:39.040 --> 08:44.480]  is going to be back in just a moment but of course the news is loaded and chief
[08:44.480 --> 08:49.800]  among them is the so-called assassination plot where the accused
[08:49.800 --> 08:55.160]  assassin has been linked to none other than alex jones's obama deception they've
[08:55.160 --> 09:00.880]  got the guy who allegedly sold him the gun quoting that he knows he watched
[09:00.880 --> 09:04.600]  the obama deception produced and written by alex jones he doesn't recall
[09:04.600 --> 09:09.200]  however if mr. Ortega ever talked of taking violent action but he does
[09:09.200 --> 09:14.960]  recall the political film he watched online so that's very interesting tie-in
[09:14.960 --> 09:18.360]  as they've repeatedly tried to demonize this broadcast and other
[09:18.360 --> 09:23.440]  alternative news and furthermore you see a resurgence of this talking point
[09:23.440 --> 09:27.160]  where now you're supposed to watch what you say you have to be careful who and
[09:27.160 --> 09:31.760]  how you criticize you've got the christian post reporting quoted here in
[09:31.760 --> 09:34.800]  curtain emos article that conservatives and faith leaders warn
[09:34.800 --> 09:39.800]  christians to be more careful of how they criticize political opponents after
[09:39.800 --> 09:43.040]  court documents reveal that the suspect in the white house shooting oscar
[09:43.040 --> 09:48.160]  remerowed or tega hernandez believe president obama to be the anti christ so
[09:48.160 --> 09:52.400]  just like in the Tucson shooting and other incidents you see an attempt to
[09:52.400 --> 09:57.560]  blame the rhetoric in media for actual attempted violent action or in the case
[09:57.560 --> 10:03.280]  of Tucson actual violent action we have alex back on the line yes erin i'm
[10:03.280 --> 10:09.040]  lucky to have any phone service at all i'm here in monument valley utah where
[10:09.040 --> 10:12.840]  they have to truck the water red and so it's like back in the nineteen back in
[10:12.840 --> 10:17.600]  the 1940s this was john wane's favorite place to hang out even when he wasn't
[10:17.600 --> 10:24.400]  shooting more than more than ten of his famous films here like the searchers and
[10:24.400 --> 10:29.640]  yellow ribbon but we are here basically tracking globalist activities i left the
[10:29.640 --> 10:35.400]  grand canyon yesterday i'll have reports on that for people coming up in the
[10:35.400 --> 10:40.760]  third hour today again i join you by phone not by our crystal clear skype
[10:40.760 --> 10:46.720]  audio and video because i'm back in the 1940s here in beautiful monument valley
[10:46.720 --> 10:51.280]  and we've just got incredible video from inside the grand canyon of the un
[10:51.280 --> 11:00.160]  signs a local tourist basically gets upset that i'm even talking about the
[11:00.160 --> 11:06.240]  un taking over america and gets mad at me all of that is is coming up later
[11:06.240 --> 11:10.920]  today and we've got a jam-packed broadcast lined up for you as well and
[11:10.920 --> 11:15.960]  again erin dykes there is in studio with us in case i have any technical
[11:15.960 --> 11:21.200]  difficulties continuing here was just some of the headlines erin was just
[11:21.200 --> 11:25.640]  getting into this new york times tries to blame political film for a white
[11:25.640 --> 11:30.320]  house shooting the political film is the obama deception and we've got all these
[11:30.320 --> 11:33.960]  quote conservative christian leaders coming up saying don't criticize the
[11:33.960 --> 11:37.600]  government it's not of the lord that's all part of the fema clergy response
[11:37.600 --> 11:42.480]  team situation very frightening that they continue to have so-called friends
[11:42.480 --> 11:46.520]  of all these different shooters come out and blame our films when my film the
[11:46.520 --> 11:51.360]  obama deception says obama is a puppet and not even a bad person he's a
[11:51.360 --> 11:56.040]  teleprompter reading a minion a nobody and then it's the mega banks the
[11:56.040 --> 12:01.880]  council on farm relations the private federal reserve we never call for
[12:01.880 --> 12:07.240]  offensive violence and i don't believe for a minute he's so-called friend that's
[12:07.240 --> 12:12.320]  quoted in the new york times just like with the ploskey the guy that shot three
[12:12.320 --> 12:17.000]  cops and and within two hours the southern property law center connected
[12:17.000 --> 12:22.400]  writer who later had to retract five of her publications had to retract had all
[12:22.400 --> 12:26.800]  were had said that he shot the cops because of me when they when when they
[12:26.800 --> 12:30.920]  actually released his full searching record and what he was visiting it was
[12:30.920 --> 12:34.800]  hundreds of sites including fox news seeing in and it turned out richard
[12:34.800 --> 12:40.800]  ploskey hated alex jones hated info wars com and posted on all the big white
[12:40.800 --> 12:46.640]  supremacists posted on our site attacking us and the system knew it and
[12:46.640 --> 12:52.640]  didn't care within two hours the cops weren't even cold yet they blamed us
[12:52.640 --> 12:57.920]  when it was he was drunk with pitbulls his mother he was a mama's boy he got
[12:57.920 --> 13:01.880]  threw out of the marine corps she said you're not gonna have a second dog there
[13:01.880 --> 13:06.160]  go there crap it all over the floor excuse my french and he threw a fit she
[13:06.160 --> 13:09.680]  said i'm calling the police to throw you out at 4 a.m. in the morning they
[13:09.680 --> 13:15.440]  showed up and he shot him with his semi-auto ak-47 okay so that's what
[13:15.440 --> 13:19.320]  happened there and within two hours of him being in handcuffs they came out on
[13:19.320 --> 13:23.440]  the news and said he did it for alex jones they went into his computer and
[13:23.440 --> 13:28.000]  said look this guy's attacking alex jones will blame him same thing with
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.720]  Tucson i got blamed for it turned out the guy was attacking me he was a big
[13:32.720 --> 13:36.400]  liberal and then fried his brain on a bunch of drugs that was connected to
[13:36.400 --> 13:41.160]  psychiatrists as usual now it turns out this guy they're saying watch the
[13:41.160 --> 13:45.960]  Obama deception and so that's the one reason he must have done this when i
[13:45.960 --> 13:50.320]  explained the first ten minutes of it that Obama is built up to be destroyed
[13:50.320 --> 13:54.160]  so that he'll take the political blame for the globalist agenda just like the
[13:54.160 --> 13:58.680]  next republican they put in might not even be a bad person individually but
[13:58.680 --> 14:02.440]  will still be politically destroyed and blame for the entire agenda this is
[14:02.440 --> 14:09.160]  very very very very dangerous and that's why you have to understand ladies and
[14:09.160 --> 14:13.360]  gentlemen the FBI visited us three days before the Obama deception was released
[14:13.360 --> 14:18.080]  they delivered a gag order to us would not say why they were there but kept
[14:18.080 --> 14:22.760]  asking about the Obama deception in the days after they would call up and ask
[14:22.760 --> 14:26.920]  my employees questions about it and then of course I had a gag order all I could
[14:26.920 --> 14:31.280]  say is the FBI came here and then of course later came out in the news that
[14:31.280 --> 14:34.760]  they had indeed been to our office folks thought that was some stunt ladies and
[14:34.760 --> 14:39.400]  gentlemen we're on almost a hundred AFN FM affiliates we're on XM global short
[14:39.400 --> 14:44.280]  way we have three million listeners a day we don't need to pull studs okay we
[14:44.280 --> 14:49.760]  have the New York Times and all these other giant publications attacking us
[14:49.760 --> 14:55.920]  all over the place right now trying to set us up for violence so that when they
[14:55.920 --> 14:59.760]  swap team us or kill us or do whatever they're going to do to me that they can
[14:59.760 --> 15:06.240]  basically rationalize the whole thing they're trying to paint us as violent so
[15:06.240 --> 15:09.920]  they can have the pretext to come after us they've got the internet kill switch
[15:09.920 --> 15:14.560]  bill they're pushing they've got all this other legislation coming out they've
[15:14.560 --> 15:18.320]  got this legislation where under copyright there's no due process they can
[15:18.320 --> 15:24.120]  shut on any website it's on why is info wars calm being attacked why is the
[15:24.120 --> 15:28.680]  Obama deception being attacked why is Alex Jones being attacked because we hit
[15:28.680 --> 15:34.400]  bubbles I we're over the target dropping heavy poundage pounding the enemy
[15:34.400 --> 15:39.280]  blowing them to kingdom come in the info war we know the pen is mightier than
[15:39.280 --> 15:43.200]  the sword we know the film is a trillion times mightier than the sword we
[15:43.200 --> 15:47.240]  understand that speech and ideas are bulletproof and cannot be defeated and
[15:47.240 --> 15:50.720]  we're not backing down we're going head-on into this black hole the New
[15:50.720 --> 15:55.320]  World Order we're going in through and beyond and nothing is going to stop us
[15:55.320 --> 15:58.200]  at the end of the day it doesn't matter what happens to Alex Joe doesn't matter
[15:58.200 --> 16:01.560]  what happens in full wars calm that's the reason we're so attacked by the
[16:01.560 --> 16:06.360]  co-intel pro and the disinfo ops from below were attacked from above were
[16:06.360 --> 16:10.200]  attacked by establishment media you name it we are under total bombardment
[16:10.200 --> 16:14.480]  because we are on target we are over the enemy targets just like the old World
[16:14.480 --> 16:18.200]  War two saying how do you know when you're over the target it's because you
[16:18.200 --> 16:22.720]  see the black smoke trying to block everything out you get into that fog of
[16:22.720 --> 16:28.440]  war and here comes the strafing here comes the anti-aircraft shaft here comes

[16:36.920 --> 16:42.240]  actually having a giant effect we had Forbes magazine just two days ago come
[16:42.240 --> 16:47.840]  out and say talk show host Alex Jones and guest call for run-on banks what we
[16:47.840 --> 16:51.520]  said is it's going to cause a run-on banks as these global mega banks and
[16:51.520 --> 16:55.200]  brokerage firms start stealing people's sequestered accounts but that's how
[16:55.200 --> 16:59.240]  they're trying to spend it New York Times Forbes just the attacks continue
[16:59.240 --> 17:05.920]  MSNBC nightline just pounding and attacking savagely because they don't
[17:05.920 --> 17:09.840]  know how to deal with us they'd love to kill me in a New York minute but they
[17:09.840 --> 17:13.200]  know it'll turn us into a martyr they know that I've studied history they know
[17:13.200 --> 17:15.880]  that I'm committed and don't care and they understand that they don't know how
[17:15.880 --> 17:19.480]  to deal with it so they're trying to assassinate our character so I hope you
[17:19.480 --> 17:21.800]  all realize what we're facing here I want to give you some of the news and
[17:21.800 --> 17:25.600]  throw it to Aaron New York Times tries to blame political film for White House

[17:38.680 --> 17:43.160]  Taureer Square protesters in Cairo praised by our loving government
[17:43.160 --> 17:47.480]  Egyptian military justifies murder of protesters by pointing to American
[17:47.480 --> 17:53.200]  police curling up in a ball to avoid police violence may be considered
[17:53.200 --> 17:56.760]  active resistance there's videos coming out of people curl up in balls being
[17:56.760 --> 18:00.600]  billy clubbed and rubber bulleted and pepper sprayed and the police are
[18:00.600 --> 18:04.240]  saying this is the new freedom you are resisting us when you curl up in a ball
[18:04.240 --> 18:09.440]  you must stick your chin out and say please break my jaw again this is just
[18:09.440 --> 18:13.360]  the total wickedness that's coming into America as the banks prepare to suck
[18:13.360 --> 18:18.360]  everything absolutely dry joining us today and about 40 minutes Jesse Ventura
[18:18.360 --> 18:22.320]  with breaking news and information coming up in about 12 minutes we got
[18:22.320 --> 18:25.920]  Gerald Salenty on the latest on MF global saying we're not going to tell you
[18:25.920 --> 18:30.520]  where the 700 to 1 billion dollars in customer money went that's all coming
[18:30.520 --> 18:34.840]  up and Max Kaiser on MF global and how big this is and the fact that the media
[18:34.840 --> 18:39.560]  admits that's what's hammering markets right now it is Monday November 21st
[18:39.560 --> 18:45.840]  2011 this is the info war and I am wound up Aaron Dykes take us out to break tell
[18:45.840 --> 18:48.840]  us what else is coming up we are going to go to break and something I want to
[18:48.840 --> 18:53.560]  get into later is that angle that Egyptian military justifies murder of
[18:53.560 --> 18:57.720]  protesters by pointing to American cops and they routinely use the way they
[18:57.720 --> 19:03.040]  handle civilians to justify things that happen overseas often by military and
[19:03.040 --> 19:08.680]  other units trained in America but more on this alleged attempted assassination
[19:08.680 --> 19:12.960]  attempt when Obama wasn't even in the country is the fact that he's been
[19:12.960 --> 19:18.000]  politically desperate for a long time now and the democratic establishment is
[19:18.000 --> 19:23.920]  scrambling to either justify a resurgence of Obama's political popularity
[19:23.920 --> 19:29.000]  through some kind of pretext or false flag attack or to rebrand another
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.800]  Democrat Hillary one possible name floated they weekly weekly constantly
[19:34.800 --> 19:38.760]  report on how he has politically dropped so bad in the polls that they are
[19:38.760 --> 19:42.840]  desperate to figure out what to do so we'll see which way that goes we'll be

[24:37.760 --> 24:40.560]  forms article in a way is almost positive I don't know if it's a hit piece
[24:40.560 --> 24:44.360]  or not because recall conspiracy theorists and things but it does admit
[24:44.360 --> 24:48.240]  that we've been right about gold going up in price and it does admit that MF
[24:48.240 --> 24:52.560]  global has disappeared all this money and so people have a right to be upset but
[24:52.560 --> 24:57.240]  it uses all the standard cliches the headline is not right though we're
[24:57.240 --> 25:01.320]  saying you can't trust the banks so that's going to elicit the bank run
[25:01.320 --> 25:05.600]  that's what always causes the bank run you already see people the last few
[25:05.600 --> 25:10.520]  months pulling their money out of the big six mega banks and you now see I'm
[25:10.520 --> 25:13.160]  arresting people that come in and try to get their money out when I first heard
[25:13.160 --> 25:17.440]  that a month ago I thought this can't be true and then I watched YouTube after
[25:17.440 --> 25:21.880]  YouTube after YouTube where the people would go in and the cops were waiting
[25:21.880 --> 25:25.680]  and they would like say you're upset today why are you so upset ma'am they
[25:25.680 --> 25:29.480]  were like I'm not upset give me my money they'd be like you've got to wait no
[25:29.480 --> 25:34.920]  you give it to me now that's it this orderly conduct you're out of here so
[25:34.920 --> 25:38.440]  many of these poor people that work for the system really think that they're
[25:38.440 --> 25:42.680]  going to hold the system up by by engaging in all this tyrannical activity
[25:42.680 --> 25:46.840]  the truth is they're going to allow the globalist to end this free republic as
[25:46.840 --> 25:50.680]  it's been known traveling across the West and I've been out here many times
[25:50.680 --> 25:55.400]  I've never seen children looking more poor into shovels people looking more
[25:55.400 --> 26:00.040]  freaked out and poor restaurants that are few and far between being more empty
[26:00.040 --> 26:05.920]  hotels and motels being more empty we pulled up to get gas last night next
[26:05.920 --> 26:15.920]  door to a Burger King that was right next to the border with southern Utah and
[26:15.920 --> 26:19.640]  Arizona which it was just on the Arizona side for your crossover into the
[26:19.640 --> 26:25.360]  Monument Valley Utah area and I got on video nine stray dogs but by the time
[26:25.360 --> 26:32.600]  we got back on the RV and left there was about 15 with more showing up just
[26:32.600 --> 26:39.880]  large stray dogs fighting over scraps of food following people into the Burger
[26:39.880 --> 26:43.880]  King growling at them demanding that they give them something to eat I mean it
[26:43.880 --> 26:48.200]  was very very dystopic I've never seen anything like this and I've been on the
[26:48.200 --> 26:53.360]  West a lot I've never seen the Indian reservations looking more run down and
[26:53.360 --> 26:57.760]  disheveled I've never seen the people looking more dejected freaked out I've
[26:57.760 --> 27:04.520]  never seen more police more forest service people bugging their eyes out
[27:04.520 --> 27:11.720]  the only new cars or government vehicles it is really scary the things
[27:11.720 --> 27:14.840]  I've seen out here and I'm gonna be filing more of those reports I probably
[27:14.840 --> 27:20.120]  got 20 video reports I haven't uploaded yet you know why because it's there's
[27:20.120 --> 27:24.080]  no internet out here I mean you get in towns and sit there in a parking lot for
[27:24.080 --> 27:28.520]  an hour trying to upload a four-minute clip so I'll have to follow most of
[27:28.520 --> 27:35.280]  these as we're driving back to Austin tomorrow evening and so I want to
[27:35.280 --> 27:41.040]  challenge everybody out there to be watching Tuesday night and for wars
[27:41.040 --> 27:46.280]  calm and Wednesday with the nightly news we've got Mike Adams who's gonna be
[27:46.280 --> 27:49.680]  hosting the nightly news tonight it's Aaron Dyches tomorrow and I really
[27:49.680 --> 27:54.120]  appreciate the great job they're doing Rob do the great job it's so good to see
[27:54.120 --> 27:57.320]  other informed people who can in some cases do a better job than I'm doing
[27:57.320 --> 28:02.360]  God bless them plus that means more targets I don't like being the only the
[28:02.360 --> 28:06.000]  only B-17 up here dropping bombs on the New World Order Aaron you started
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.560]  getting into the incredible statements by the military regime installed by the
[28:10.560 --> 28:15.600]  globalist the same folks that have taken our country over through COG now just
[28:15.600 --> 28:19.920]  machine-gunning men women children resting anybody that doesn't wear a
[28:19.920 --> 28:27.400]  burka sharia law boy and putting al Qaeda in Libya and then the new forces
[28:27.400 --> 28:31.400]  say hey we're doing what America does incredible Aaron well yeah you've got
[28:31.400 --> 28:35.880]  the tale of two cities going on because if you're Syria or some other country
[28:35.880 --> 28:41.040]  they want to run over then every outrage every injustice is totally an
[28:41.040 --> 28:46.120]  outrage but if you're a US client state like Egypt in the middle of internal
[28:46.120 --> 28:51.440]  civil war every injustice is just justified because it's just like
[28:51.440 --> 28:56.040]  America and the quote here is we saw the firm stance US took against Occupy
[28:56.040 --> 28:59.840]  Wall Street people and the German government against green protesters to
[28:59.840 --> 29:04.800]  secure the state said an Egyptian state television anchor yesterday and thus the
[29:04.800 --> 29:10.640]  implied justification for what I think now amounts to at least 35 murders just
[29:10.640 --> 29:14.800]  from these recent clashes all because the military will not give up power in
[29:14.800 --> 29:22.440]  Egypt and they're saying elections would be in 2013 or after amazing and notice
[29:22.440 --> 29:27.200]  how Anderson Cooper and others endorse this as the ultimate in democracy six
[29:27.200 --> 29:31.320]  months ago eight months ago and now they're not even criticizing the mass
[29:31.320 --> 29:36.000]  murder of slaughter because it's purely a globalist system again every country
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.880]  being taken over by this corporate is bored and we're all liberties are thrown out the window
[29:40.880 --> 29:45.840]  we'll be right back with Gerald Salente Aaron Dykes Jesse Viterra Max Kaiser

[30:20.200 --> 30:25.600]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for

[33:28.200 --> 33:38.400]  to blame you can see Forbes blaming Gerald Salente and I for possible runs
[33:38.400 --> 33:43.960]  on banks and the stock market going down headline talk show host Alex Jones and
[33:43.960 --> 33:48.220]  guest call for run on banks Forbes they've got someone to blame it's not
[33:48.220 --> 33:51.840]  MF Global's fault and then there's another little headline from the New
[33:51.840 --> 33:57.400]  York Times blaming my film the Obama deception watched more than 35 million
[33:57.400 --> 34:04.240]  times for free online because we want to defeat the globalist we make powerful
[34:04.240 --> 34:07.880]  films and put them out for free and they're now saying the guy that shot the
[34:07.880 --> 34:12.880]  White House and did it because of the Obama deception really a film that calls
[34:12.880 --> 34:17.720]  for non-violence a film that points out Obama is a puppet three years ago and
[34:17.720 --> 34:24.960]  would betray everything he said he would do really no they're blaming the
[34:24.960 --> 34:29.880]  Tucson shooting they're blaming the Popovsky the cop killer they're blaming
[34:29.880 --> 34:35.000]  this latest thing on the Obama deception we've proven over and over again
[34:35.000 --> 34:39.280]  because they're scared to death of it they're scared to death of our analysis
[34:39.280 --> 34:42.720]  like the three-year-old saying the emperor's not wearing any clothes and
[34:42.720 --> 34:47.560]  everybody finally points out the obvious I know rocket scientists I know
[34:47.560 --> 34:52.800]  tyranny when it's coming down the road a million miles an hour at me okay now I
[34:52.800 --> 34:56.640]  want to get Gerald Salente's update on this because as soon as he started
[34:56.640 --> 35:00.720]  blowing the whistle that caused the dam to break it was that it was the straw
[35:00.720 --> 35:06.320]  that broke the camel's proverbial back it turned out for almost two weeks going
[35:06.320 --> 35:09.920]  back to early last week they had known that massive amounts of money were
[35:09.920 --> 35:14.160]  missing from MF global that had bought up other solvent firms like the one that
[35:14.160 --> 35:19.440]  Gerald Salente had a multi-decade long account with by the way I've not done
[35:19.440 --> 35:23.240]  research and we have the head of MF global and others including federal
[35:23.240 --> 35:27.380]  regulators at the CFTC who were invested with MF global and had to recuse
[35:27.380 --> 35:31.680]  himself saying that these funds would be guaranteed through a different system
[35:31.680 --> 35:36.240]  just not FDIC so I put that in your pipe and spoke it but here's why Gerald
[35:36.240 --> 35:40.920]  Salente joins us I misspoke at the start of the show if you just type the MF
[35:40.920 --> 35:45.640]  global into Google and click news the first two headlines you get are AP and
[35:45.640 --> 35:53.000]  CNN will put these on screen MF global missing funds may hit 1.2 billion now
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.880]  that was earlier this morning now the trustees come out and said oops it's
[35:56.880 --> 36:02.400]  more than 1.2 billion that's the AP headline and I see another one here
[36:02.400 --> 36:08.280]  saying it might be as high as 2 plus billion of the 6 billion that went into
[36:08.280 --> 36:13.560]  bankruptcy with the former globalist Goldman Sachs alumni New Jersey mayor
[36:13.560 --> 36:18.240]  with the head of the CFTC invested in it involved with Corzine
[36:18.240 --> 36:23.840]  refusing himself a week and a half ago according to Reuters and Forbes so it's
[36:23.840 --> 36:29.440]  but but it's not their fault each Gerald Salente of trendsresearch.com and
[36:29.440 --> 36:34.360]  Alex Jones of info wars.com it's our fault Aaron Dyches is riding shotgun in
[36:34.360 --> 36:37.920]  the studio he'll be popping in we've got Gerald till five after and then he's
[36:37.920 --> 36:42.640]  leaving and then Governor Jesse Ventura is joining us then Max Kaiser going to
[36:42.640 --> 36:48.040]  Gerald Salente Gerald it's now above 1.2 billion and they're telling now
[36:48.040 --> 36:52.040]  they're talking about more than 50,000 customers it was 33,000 you're not
[36:52.040 --> 36:55.960]  going to get anything and they're now saying we thought JP Morgan had the
[36:55.960 --> 37:00.200]  money but now we're just going to say it disappeared into the Easter Bunny patch
[37:00.200 --> 37:05.680]  Gerald this is all our fault didn't you hear yeah I get a kick out of these
[37:05.680 --> 37:09.280]  people it's I should have been smarter yeah I should have been smarter it's
[37:09.280 --> 37:13.320]  like walking down the street and somebody blowing your brains out from
[37:13.320 --> 37:20.120]  behind you know if Jesse James did this it would be robbery but when John
[37:20.120 --> 37:26.920]  corn Corzine does it oh it was just a mistake how come this guy isn't being
[37:26.920 --> 37:33.600]  even brought in for questioning I just heard Senator Roberts over there saying
[37:33.600 --> 37:39.720]  that it looks like illegal behavior is behind this how come he isn't being
[37:39.720 --> 37:46.320]  brought up where's the perp walk as I said before the press is really easy to
[37:46.320 --> 37:52.840]  judge people prejudge them in the media you don't even hear Corzine's name come
[37:52.840 --> 37:59.280]  up anymore we sent out that press release Alex that you have about CME group
[37:59.280 --> 38:06.360]  where they said that they guarantee the funds and that nobody's ever lost a
[38:06.360 --> 38:14.120]  penny we went out to over 45,000 people in the media none of the major
[38:14.120 --> 38:21.240]  prostitutes will touch it and then I got this letter from this guy this little
[38:21.240 --> 38:31.640]  worm of a man I use the word man loosely his name happens to be Jeffrey M
[38:31.640 --> 38:39.440]  Christensen Christian not to confuse him with Jeffrey zero Christian and here's
[38:39.440 --> 38:47.400]  what he says about me and talking to people like you that I'm ignorant I'm
[38:47.400 --> 38:57.000]  stupid and I'm delusional and self delusional and that Corzine has not done
[38:57.000 --> 39:04.040]  a perp walk because he has not been alleged to have done anything illegal
[39:04.040 --> 39:11.520]  only incredibly stupid hey worm Christian if you listen you're incredibly
[39:11.520 --> 39:17.000]  stupid and if you want to talk to me like that face-to-face come on over and
[39:17.000 --> 39:22.480]  let's have a visit because here's the facts we a little worm
[39:22.480 --> 39:28.520]  Corzine it is allegedly has done something that is more than just
[39:28.520 --> 39:36.120]  incredibly stupid he has broken the cardinal rule yet don't go into a
[39:36.120 --> 39:44.040]  customer's private account to go do the firms gambling you get it it's as simple
[39:44.040 --> 39:51.480]  as that this is robbery and no one is calling him out maybe cause line has you
[39:51.480 --> 39:58.200]  know he just held a $35,000 a plate dinner for Obama a fundraiser maybe
[39:58.200 --> 40:03.600]  he's not showing up because he's preparing a Thanksgiving dinner for us
[40:03.600 --> 40:09.840]  you know so we'll all get a little more turkey to eat this little this little
[40:09.840 --> 40:16.720]  twerp going on and on and on and here you'll love this one Alex this is a
[40:16.720 --> 40:24.760]  beauty when anyone stops talking about the trilateral here when a man like him
[40:24.760 --> 40:31.680]  meaning me calls other sheeple and speaks of the trilateral Commission in the
[40:31.680 --> 40:40.200]  build-a-bird group I know I can stop listening oh by the way this little weenie
[40:40.200 --> 40:49.240]  guy Christian the CPM group they said gold wasn't gonna go up this year yeah
[40:49.240 --> 40:55.120]  that's right he's so brilliant no trilateral Commission no build-a-bird
[40:55.120 --> 41:02.840]  hey jerk even go on Wikipedia look up the names that I was talking about
[41:02.840 --> 41:11.720]  Draghi the new head of the European Central Bank Mario three card Monty the
[41:11.720 --> 41:20.920]  new head over there in Italy Papa Deimos over there in Greece all members of the
[41:20.920 --> 41:27.880]  trilateral Commission one Draghi is a chief cat with the build-a-bird it's
[41:27.880 --> 41:34.600]  right there this is a conspiracy this is guys like him that are probably CIA
[41:34.600 --> 41:44.000]  agents this is important here is CNN more than 1.2 billion customer funds
[41:44.000 --> 41:48.520]  might be missing from bankrupt broker MF global now this is going on three weeks
[41:48.520 --> 41:53.560]  now nearly twice previous estimates of the shortfall the trusty
[41:53.560 --> 41:58.360]  administering the firm's bankruptcy said Monday and that's who they're saying has
[41:58.360 --> 42:02.120]  the accounts MF global is forced to file for bankruptcy last month ever
[42:02.120 --> 42:06.360]  disclosed 6.3 billion in exposure to troubled sovereign debt from weak
[42:06.360 --> 42:10.520]  European countries sparking panic among investors so of course they have to
[42:10.520 --> 42:15.920]  spin in general than myself and others pointing this out as if somehow we're
[42:15.920 --> 42:20.080]  bad it's true all of these major bank heads all of these finance ministers
[42:20.080 --> 42:24.480]  all of these prime ministers presidents they're all financed or our actual
[42:24.480 --> 42:29.120]  Goldman Sachs operatives even Time Magazine last week said it's a global
[42:29.120 --> 42:35.520]  coup a coup in Europe by Goldman Sachs government by banksters for banksters but
[42:35.520 --> 42:40.800]  but again now here we are three weeks later going back a week and a half ago
[42:40.800 --> 42:46.760]  even when we showed these on air even Reuters and and and Forbes and others
[42:46.760 --> 42:51.480]  had CFTC acting ahead over this investigation because the head is
[42:51.480 --> 42:55.320]  invested in it so I did say you know I'm recused saying this appears to be
[42:55.320 --> 43:01.320]  illegal and something's nefarious but now the media just says well I guess it's
[43:01.320 --> 43:05.560]  it's more than 700 million it's more than a billion it's 1.2 billion it's more
[43:05.560 --> 43:10.440]  than 1.2 billion and they admit that it's destabilizing the whole market you
[43:10.440 --> 43:14.800]  have over 1.2 billion or whatever it really is they won't deliver people's
[43:14.800 --> 43:19.720]  money when we're talking about a 800 trillion dollar group in the press
[43:19.720 --> 43:24.280]  released by the CME group that you just mentioned of course they've got to turn
[43:24.280 --> 43:30.000]  it around and have Forbes come out and imply we're the bad guys folks no one's
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.760]  bank account is safe they've already stolen most your pension funds they've
[43:33.760 --> 43:37.800]  already invested those in derivatives your 401ks it's all admitted your social
[43:37.800 --> 43:42.600]  security it was spent decades ago and here everything is falling apart we've
[43:42.600 --> 43:46.520]  been into depression for years they keep lying to us but going back Gerald
[43:46.520 --> 43:50.280]  because I want to spend too much time on this guy who is this person you're
[43:50.280 --> 43:57.400]  quoting that was making those asinine statements because over over some years
[43:57.400 --> 44:03.280]  it's 60 some years it's over 70 of the 125 people 130 or so that are in
[44:03.280 --> 44:08.240]  Goldberg are Goldman Sachs I mean no one denies now from the Financial Times of
[44:08.240 --> 44:12.040]  London to type magazine that it's a global government up for and by the
[44:12.040 --> 44:14.760]  banksters so I don't want to spend all day on this guy's you're not worth the
[44:14.760 --> 44:20.200]  time is this some analyst that attacked you who is this person this guy's ahead
[44:20.200 --> 44:28.520]  of the CPM group they're going to start barraging us with negative with
[44:28.520 --> 44:35.360]  negative news to try to discredit us when in the meantime Corzine where's
[44:35.360 --> 44:42.840]  Corzine where is this guy he's not even look where we as I said you know when
[44:42.840 --> 44:49.680]  Dominique Strauss-Kahn was accused of allegedly false you know having sex with
[44:49.680 --> 44:54.480]  a maid boy the press jumped on that one all over the place gave him a purple
[44:54.480 --> 44:59.080]  that's how you know it was staged yeah and yeah now where is Corzine how come
[44:59.080 --> 45:03.000]  he's not showing up so what I'm with the reason I'm bringing this up and you
[45:03.000 --> 45:10.960]  mentioned about Forbes try this one on everybody go to Forbes 2009 they made
[45:10.960 --> 45:18.240]  fun of me then one of my assistants at the time cashed out her 401k and bought
[45:18.240 --> 45:26.520]  gold at $700 an ounce they say she was overreacting gold is at $1,700 an ounce
[45:26.520 --> 45:31.760]  now what an overreaction and not even a retraction they're going to do
[45:31.760 --> 45:36.720]  everything they can do now to try to discredit us because the whole system is
[45:36.720 --> 45:41.920]  going down and they misquoted me in there it's not really a correction you
[45:41.920 --> 45:45.840]  may not have read the Forbes article he actually admits that you were right
[45:45.840 --> 45:51.080]  about that and so they must be listening and it said well yeah it's a weird
[45:51.080 --> 45:54.600]  article I mean they're kind of framing us for any problems that may come but
[45:54.600 --> 45:58.360]  then they also admit that you've been right and that I've been right so you
[45:58.360 --> 46:00.800]  might want to go see that article I know you've made a point out of that but they
[46:00.800 --> 46:06.240]  say that she did it at $900 and that it basically doubled but I remember it was
[46:06.240 --> 46:11.000]  $700 so it's more than doubled now yeah but Alex I want I want to follow up on
[46:11.000 --> 46:16.440]  this because it's very important they misquoted me and I'm saying this and the
[46:16.440 --> 46:24.760]  reason I'm going so public with this is that the entire global financial system
[46:24.760 --> 46:29.840]  is melting down what's the stocks doing over in Europe what are they doing in
[46:29.840 --> 46:36.000]  the United States they can't solve these problems I said if your money's
[46:36.000 --> 46:43.080]  with Schwab if it's with Raymond James I don't care who is with Smith Barney if
[46:43.080 --> 46:48.760]  this thing collapses you're gonna get shafted oh they're gonna tell you that
[46:48.760 --> 46:56.160]  you have insurance just like the CME said that ours was guaranteed yeah it'll
[46:56.160 --> 47:01.480]  be guaranteed and you know when you'll get it I guarantee you'll get it after
[47:01.480 --> 47:06.320]  you're dead because that's how long it's gonna take and if you get your money
[47:06.320 --> 47:10.680]  before then it's gonna be devalued into nothing
[47:10.680 --> 47:15.240]  and they're gonna say it's your fault for being in a pension or a stock market just like his
[47:15.240 --> 47:19.360]  sequestered account segregated account under the wall that was his was taken
[47:19.360 --> 47:23.440]  they're gonna say it's your fault when you complain they're gonna say you cause
[47:23.440 --> 47:27.440]  the market to fall now now now Gerald I want to get into where you're going with
[47:27.440 --> 47:31.160]  this but I think now it's confirmed as you said as I said last week this is way
[47:31.160 --> 47:35.000]  bigger than 700 million it's way bigger than 1.2 billion they're now admitting
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.280]  and this is about physical delivery as Max Kaiser predicted they could not
[47:39.280 --> 47:44.240]  deliver the gold to people that had wanted in the open market and so they
[47:44.240 --> 47:48.600]  simply defaulted and instead of even paying you in cash they just said you
[47:48.600 --> 47:53.280]  know what that's the way it is and then now it's kind of creepy to have the
[47:53.280 --> 48:00.160]  biggest derivative kingpins I've forgotten that guy is actually attacking
[48:00.160 --> 48:06.680]  you and to have Forbes coming after us we must have really hit a nerve how Alex
[48:06.680 --> 48:11.280]  the CME group that group over there where that guy Duffy says that they
[48:11.280 --> 48:19.120]  guarantee everything they've lost over 2.5 billion dollars in equities share
[48:19.120 --> 48:27.320]  since this thing happens I'd like to see it go down to zero CME maybe it's the
[48:27.320 --> 48:33.800]  Chicago mafia enterprise where is the money Duffy that you said you were going
[48:33.800 --> 48:38.480]  to guarantee how come the prostitutes aren't calling them out on this and I'll
[48:38.480 --> 48:43.240]  tell you why because maybe they don't have the money and I'm what you know
[48:43.240 --> 48:48.360]  here's a scenario I'm gonna give you a scoop I'm it was saving this to the top
[48:48.360 --> 48:53.360]  trends of 2011 but I'm letting you know this because of all the listeners there
[48:53.360 --> 48:57.920]  that are faithful to your show and want to know what's going to happen before it
[48:57.920 --> 49:06.520]  happens you go back Alex to when Obama was elected I said prepare for a bank
[49:06.520 --> 49:13.760]  holiday what happened is I'm doing research in the Corzine thing there it
[49:13.760 --> 49:20.960]  pops up with Joe Biden you remember he was head of the he was senator from that
[49:20.960 --> 49:25.160]  state of the loophole state over there in Delaware that gives all these
[49:25.160 --> 49:29.880]  corporations a free ride before he became vice president he's out there
[49:29.880 --> 49:35.040]  campaigning for Corzine in his aborted effort to get reelected as governor and
[49:35.040 --> 49:43.640]  big Joe puts his arm around Corzine and he said Biden said you know it was talk
[49:43.640 --> 49:50.440]  about a bank holiday when we came into office they were discussing it and we
[49:50.440 --> 49:58.040]  brought in Joe to advise us I'm saying this because the entire system is
[49:58.040 --> 50:06.240]  collapsing I believe they're going to keep propping it up until after Christmas
[50:06.240 --> 50:12.120]  so they can suck everybody in to spending money that they don't have in
[50:12.120 --> 50:19.040]  buying a lot of Christmas crap that they don't need and after that scam is over
[50:19.040 --> 50:24.480]  bam it's gonna come down because the entire global financial system is
[50:24.480 --> 50:31.480]  collapsing and if anybody with anything between their heads think that
[50:31.480 --> 50:39.400]  Sarkozy, Merkel, Draghi, Papademos are going to solve this problem along with
[50:39.400 --> 50:46.560]  the super committee I love it the super committee a house of fools are going to
[50:46.560 --> 50:49.800]  solve this problem you're gonna get what you deserve
[50:49.800 --> 51:04.160]  we all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most
[51:04.160 --> 51:08.440]  trusted name in water filtration as an authorized Berkey dealer for over six

[52:09.680 --> 52:13.400]  hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds
[52:13.400 --> 52:16.760]  that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible
[52:16.760 --> 52:20.480]  that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science have

[53:03.040 --> 53:07.360]  are you ready for the hard times ahead this is Alex Jones with a special
[53:07.360 --> 53:12.560]  self-reliance report I've said on this program before that studies show that in
[53:12.560 --> 53:17.760]  a true crisis eight out of ten people will remain sheep-like and passive frozen
[53:17.760 --> 53:22.920]  like deer and headlights of an oncoming car waiting for others for help one out
[53:22.920 --> 53:27.440]  of ten will actually panic and endanger family and friends as they melt down and
[53:27.440 --> 53:32.440]  only one out of ten will take swift and decisive action when the going gets
[53:32.440 --> 53:36.760]  tough dramatically increasing their chances of survival folks I've just
[53:36.760 --> 53:40.840]  read a new book called ready for anything it's a must read for anyone who
[53:40.840 --> 53:44.560]  wants to increase their chances of survival in the coming hard times ahead
[53:44.560 --> 53:49.600]  to read more about this important new book go to ready4anythingmanual.com
[53:49.600 --> 53:56.920]  that's ready4anythingmanual.com I've got my copy get yours today at ready4anythingmanual.com
[53:56.920 --> 54:08.120]  that's ready for anything manual.com
[54:08.120 --> 54:26.520]  from the street super committee failure won't hit US rating agency won't lower
[54:26.520 --> 54:30.360]  rating again remember you heard Geithner six months before they lowered it from
[54:30.360 --> 54:35.280]  AAA plus to AAA he said there's no way that would happen and of course it did
[54:35.280 --> 54:42.320]  happen it just goes on and on so this is becoming a huge issue and imagine the
[54:42.320 --> 54:45.520]  magnitude of this where you've got people's own private accounts and they
[54:45.520 --> 54:50.320]  just take them and now we learn it's 1.2 billion and remember all these
[54:50.320 --> 54:54.040]  mega banks and brokerage firms have gotten tens of trillions of our taxpayer
[54:54.040 --> 54:57.960]  money and now they want more and more at five after Jesse Ventura is joining us
[54:57.960 --> 55:01.040]  we're about to go back to Gerald Salenta and get any comments from Aaron Dix who's
[55:01.040 --> 55:07.320]  riding shotgun but I just also want to point out that Gerald's right it's time
[55:07.320 --> 55:11.320]  to support alternative media which is growing and being attacked obviously
[55:11.320 --> 55:17.000]  it's time to subscribe at trendsresearch.com it's time to get all 18 of my
[55:17.000 --> 55:24.140]  films that are on DVD for $260 off or $99.95 at info wars.com we're on the
[55:24.140 --> 55:27.200]  front lines of the fight against tyranny and we need your support you know get
[55:27.200 --> 55:31.280]  the Obama deception on DVD we sell it very inexpensively with expanded
[55:31.280 --> 55:35.800]  extras at info wars.com or you see it downloaded at prisonplanet.tv the
[55:35.800 --> 55:39.600]  system is scared of this information we couldn't do it without you the listeners
[55:39.600 --> 55:45.560]  our AM and FM affiliates and then their local sponsors and just just all of you
[55:45.560 --> 55:50.280]  that support us and of course our sponsors so again we have it inserted
[55:50.280 --> 55:54.000]  a few days 15 day free trial prisonplanet.tv to also see the
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.800]  news we've got to hosting the news tonight the health ranger Mike Adams
[55:58.800 --> 56:01.680]  he's gonna be breaking down some incredible info on the super committee
[56:01.680 --> 56:06.000]  now is going to control legislation on the farm bill don't need bills originate
[56:06.000 --> 56:09.440]  with individual house members we have a 12 member committee with a 13th leader
[56:09.440 --> 56:14.840]  now Gerald this is a short segment one more coming up looking at this I mean
[56:14.840 --> 56:20.240]  it's asinine the mind job the con job they do trying to spin it around against
[56:20.240 --> 56:25.640]  us obviously that's not gonna work so as you said this is obviously much bigger
[56:25.640 --> 56:29.800]  than what they were first saying where does it go how does he get away with
[56:29.800 --> 56:33.080]  this you know they're taking his name out of the news instead of just doing the
[56:33.080 --> 56:37.520]  rehabilitation job because obviously that didn't work but when all these heads of
[56:37.520 --> 56:41.760]  federal agencies that protected Madoff for 11 years are caught in bed with
[56:41.760 --> 56:45.680]  Corzine I mean I guess at a certain point is just total criminal takeover
[56:45.680 --> 56:51.680]  what do you do well again what we're warning is the high probability that
[56:51.680 --> 56:56.040]  there's going to be some type of economic martial law and just like I
[56:56.040 --> 57:00.400]  couldn't get my money says nothing to do with Corzine he's just one of the the
[57:00.400 --> 57:05.000]  wall speed the Goldman Sachs gang and the Goldman Sachs gang as I said on your
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.000]  show you know the Rothschilds would be envious to see how would what the
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.160]  Goldman Sachs reaches so what I'm saying is there's going to be some level of
[57:15.160 --> 57:19.760]  martial law I'm not economic martial law I'm not telling anybody what to do I
[57:19.760 --> 57:24.400]  always make this clear think for yourself but for me I'm not having any money
[57:24.400 --> 57:28.600]  where anybody can get their hands on it gold silver dollars I don't care what
[57:28.600 --> 57:33.600]  they are and the other thing to Alex all of those police out there that are
[57:33.600 --> 57:40.200]  beating up and pepper spraying the people guess what guys now hear this

[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:12.200]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:20.800]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.800]  All right.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.800]  Jesse Ventura scheduled to be with us with a lot of breaking news and information coming
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.800]  up in the next segment.
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:26.800]  Gerald's one thing for us for another five minutes.
[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.800]  I appreciate him spending so much time with the InfoWars.com family.
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:28.800]  Gerald, you were on fire there.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.800]  You know, what's incredible is they've hired a lot of sociopaths now, and I see the police
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:44.800]  now have an article at InfoWars.com.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:50.720]  Gerald's saying that they're now charging people resisting arrest, that if they start
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:55.120]  beating you with a billy club, you do not cover your face, and they're charging people
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:57.320]  who are in field positions now.
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:58.320]  That's resisting.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.280]  So, I mean, it's like they're trying to put people in life in prison for videotaping cops
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.200]  in public in Illinois.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:10.160]  We have a criminal government, and now the bankers that own it are going to steal everybody's
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.160]  bank accounts.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:14.960]  And even though the cops are going to lose everything, I predict just because of the
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:18.760]  uniform and the power trip, a lot of them are going to go ahead and enjoy it and thank
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.760]  their masters.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:23.800]  The good ones are just going to get out, which is part of the plan, so it's a pure army of
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:24.800]  evil.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:30.000]  I mean, I don't see how, if they put criminals in every position where they can just publicly
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.480]  do all of this, the sky is the limit.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.480]  I mean, this is so incredible.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:39.520]  It's so clear, Gerald, that Homeland Security has been set up so the banksters can carry
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.320]  out this orderly gang rape.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:45.480]  All right, you know, Alex, remember the one thing.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.680]  People don't like to get it in the pocketbook.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:51.760]  It becomes a gut issue, an empty gut issue.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.680]  Everyone out there, that's listening.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:02:00.040]  If you know a cop, let them know that they're not going to be getting their pensions if
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.440]  things continue the way they are.
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:07.800]  And the people that are protesting are the ones that are going to save their pensions.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.760]  So just let them know.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:12.920]  The other thing too, of course, I've been getting warnings.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:18.560]  Watch for the three or four a.m. raid because they're out to get to take me out.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:23.760]  And then finally, what I really want to make a point on this, Alex, and drive it home,
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:30.120]  this release we sent out, those CMA group guarantees, there are CME group guarantees.
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.600]  There are no guarantees.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.440]  Again, it's not the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:42.720]  It appears from what they've written here that the correct abbreviation for CME is
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.560]  the Chicago Mafia Enterprise.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:50.080]  Because here's what Duffy, the vice chairman of that company says, I want to make this
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:56.920]  100% clear to everyone so you know how you're going to get shafted when it hits you.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:04.600]  Quote, no customer has ever lost a penny as a result of a clearing member default.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.640]  More than a penny's been lost.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:15.600]  Number one, number two, quote, since we are the guarantor of every transaction that happens
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:24.880]  in our markets, we have to guarantee the performance of each and every one of these contracts.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:32.840]  To do this, we hold more than 100 billion of collateral to support the transactions that
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:36.120]  are being done on our markets.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.840]  Where's the money?
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:39.440]  Where's the guarantee?
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:44.320]  I say either Duffy, put it up or you don't have it.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:51.160]  Oh, and you cops out there that are beating up people for resisting arrest?
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.160]  How about going after cause time?
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.160]  Well, they're bought and paid for.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:57.560]  Let me throw this in in closing and obviously we're going to update from you, Gerald, tomorrow,
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.560]  if you can do it.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.560]  You've been very gracious with your time.
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.640]  I want to expand on this, you're not going to commit suicide.
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:05.200]  I'm not going to commit suicide.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.080]  They could send SWAT teams in and show you resisted.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.240]  Are you getting threats or are you getting warnings or both?
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.080]  What's happening?
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.560]  Mostly warnings.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.240]  Mostly warnings.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:22.560]  Watch for the 3 AM raid because that's when they like to do it.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.120]  When your deepest sleep and your equilibrium is off.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:30.400]  Yeah, there's no suicide in this guy's life.
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.000]  No, no, they're going to come after us, Alex.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.800]  The white shoe boys don't like the money junkies don't like anybody messing with their to take
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.200]  their fix away from them.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.600]  So things are going to get worse before they get better.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:51.600]  And as I said, everyone out there, you know a cop, let them know they're going to get
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.640]  that baton where they're not going to like it.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.560]  All right, Gerald Salante, ThrustResearch.com.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.560]  Thank you.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.560]  Jesse Ventura, straight ahead.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.560]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:05.160]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.160]  Jeremy is here.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:10.200]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.640]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:17.160]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.400]  on earth.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:23.200]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.040]  expanded nationwide.
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:29.720]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.080]  shadow state.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:35.200]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:39.600]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:45.400]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:48.920]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.920]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:51.920]  It's here.

[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:12.600]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:21.720]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:31.440]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit, and put a diamond gusset
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:34.920]  in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:39.880]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:46.680]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:51.240]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can

[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:00.440]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:05.120]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:09.440]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:13.760]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.040]  allows you to have.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:20.760]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:25.080]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:29.080]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.560]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:36.280]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:41.040]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:44.800]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.200]  one of my old sponsors.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:52.160]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:08:02.480]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:09.040]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:16.040]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.560]  I'm going to be honest with you, ladies and gentlemen, it's pretty creepy to have the New York Times
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:25.960]  saying my film, The Obama Deception, is responsible for the guy that shot the White House.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:30.240]  And all I do is point out that Obama's a puppet in the two-party systems to come afraud.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:34.480]  Or that Forbes has come out and blamed myself and Gerald Salente saying,
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:40.240]  we're going to cause runs on banks when mega brokerage firms are taking people's private accounts
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.440]  and CNN admits it's destroying confidence.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.840]  It's still somehow our fault.
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.280]  It is so creepy.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:49.040]  I'm going to get Governor Ventura's take on that a lot more.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.320]  He joins us to give us the latest on his fight.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.400]  Really, it's all of our fight.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:09:00.040]  For due process for the 10th Amendment, for the 4th Amendment, with the TSA now expanding out,
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.520]  they have announced, and I did confirm, we got a tip last week,
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:07.440]  they are going to be in Mall of America starting next February.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.560]  And you'll see this announced in the news probably in January.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.840]  But I have talked to insiders of Mall of America.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:19.120]  TSA has put out press releases, video press releases, showing them in malls and at football games,
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:21.840]  NFL football games with the fucking ears.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:25.280]  And those articles are all posted with the videos at infowars.com.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:27.440]  But I'll get Governor Ventura's take on that.
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:31.680]  He lives up there, so I wonder if he can't go to the mall now.
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:37.320]  They're also putting in jumbo tron, telescreen, saying don't trust anybody, but they exist.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.640]  So we've got that happening.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.400]  We're going to get Governor Ventura's take on the protest, not just here, but overseas.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:48.360]  Egyptian military justifies murder of protesters by pointing to American cops.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.960]  That's an actual headline.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:54.040]  Here's another one that breaks it down.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:58.560]  Curling up at a ball to avoid police violence may be considered active resistance.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:03.120]  They've got a police commander here on tape who defended police that beat people in field
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:08.200]  positions in the head with batons and sprayed them with pepper spray as saying that is resistance
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.200]  to curl up.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:13.320]  If you raise an arm to block when they billy club you, that is resistance.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:15.480]  I mean, this is so comical now.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:22.000]  It's like, oh, what's that case we saw, life in prison for filming police in Illinois.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.840]  Now, I got thrown out of court, but the point is they keep trying it.
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:30.520]  Governor Jesse Ventura, best-selling author, obviously hit TV show, conspiracy theory, new
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.040]  season, almost a complete big shot coming up next year.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:38.840]  Jesse, what is it like for you, Governor, to, I mean, I feel like I've woken up in the
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.840]  twilight zone.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.840]  What do you think still happens?
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.960]  Well, tell me about this from your initial comments of them blaming you and blaming people
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.960]  that take things to the public.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.600]  That's an old standard play.
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:54.200]  That's called kill the messenger, not the message.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:55.200]  Yeah.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:00.320]  They don't want to talk about what you're saying, they just want to go after you for
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.320]  saying it.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:04.320]  That's a typical play.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:07.720]  I don't know, I'd like to think people are smarter than that.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:13.600]  I'd like to think people see through nonsense like that, where when there is a whistleblower,
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:19.800]  when they attack a whistleblower, well, if there was no information to give, there wouldn't
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.800]  be whistleblowers.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.400]  If there wasn't bad things going on, there wouldn't be whistleblowers.
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.720]  So, you know, just buckle up on that.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:33.720]  That's the old standard play, kill the messenger, not the message, and how they can possibly
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:39.320]  blame you and people like you who simply, you know, put out information, hey, if your
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.000]  information's untrue, well, then it'll be untrue and it'll come out through the wash
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  being untrue.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.800]  But if it is true, then how can, you know, I wouldn't worry about it.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.360]  No, I agree, Governor, but it's just like the national media turned it around against
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.360]  you.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:56.640]  When you stood up for our 10th and 4th Amendment, when you did what you did, they pretty much
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.440]  unanimously attacked you because they know over 90% of people agree with you.
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.440]  They're scared.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:06.520]  Even if they make us respond, they now get us off the offensive and exposing them.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.520]  I agree.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:13.760]  It's just still totally creepy and weird that, you know, Headline forms magazine, talk show
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:17.200]  host Alex Jones and guest, call for bank runs.
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:22.560]  No, we pointed out that they've taken now over a billion, $200 million of people's private
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:28.600]  accounts at MF Global with the former New Jersey governor, Corzine, running it and Goldman
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.640]  Sachs and all of them involved.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.640]  And then you come out and talk about it and say, boy, I guess your money's not saving
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:34.640]  the bank.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.640]  And then they turn it around.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.360]  It just shows they have nothing but contempt for the public.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:39.360]  And I agree with you, Governor.
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.800]  I think people are starting to wake up.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.440]  I think people are really starting to see through it because the bologna has gotten
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:45.440]  so thick.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.880]  I don't know, I'd like to hope so, but, you know, I'm doing a lot of interviews again
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:55.440]  dealing with my court case and I'm still getting a lot of resistance of people with
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.440]  this attitude.
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:02.040]  Well, we haven't been attacked now in 10 years, so it's a good thing what they're doing
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.040]  at airports.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:08.960]  It's a good thing that we're frisking down 95-year-old women and taking their depends.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:13.480]  It's a good thing when we're grabbing in the crotches of little children because after
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:18.000]  all, it's keeping us all safe and we haven't been attacked again.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.200]  And I mean, these are the people, I don't know if it's the fluoride in the water or
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:28.440]  what has done it to them, but, you know, they're doing exactly what Ben Franklin warned when
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:34.800]  Ben Franklin warned us that those who will give up their liberty for security shall deserve
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:41.120]  and have neither because, you know, you're not going to be free and be made safe.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:46.480]  So, need to understand that that was the great thing about our country was this bill of
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:52.200]  rights and constitution that allow you to come here and not be oppressed by government.
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:56.280]  Yes, it makes you dependent upon yourself.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:00.920]  You have to have self-reliance to achieve, but that's good.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:06.680]  And for our country to lose that, well, then we're nothing special anymore and we're losing
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:12.360]  it because we're allowing judges and we're allowing the judicial system and our elected
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:17.800]  system and our executive branch to literally trample and destroy the constitution and the
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:22.760]  bill of rights and these candidates that you have out there, you know, that claim they're
[01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:28.480]  constitutional and this and that, well, on the Republican side, in my opinion, half of
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:33.560]  them are disillusioned because they're sitting here telling us God told them to run.
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:38.360]  And anybody that makes that statement to me, I look at them like they're insane because
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:42.960]  they obviously are, you know, have voices in their heads, you know, a lot like what
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:47.720]  I'm one of my conspiracies I'm looking into this year is the fact that are they doing
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.720]  that to people?
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.200]  Are they putting, you know, sounds and words and thoughts into people's minds?
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.200]  That's one of our conspiracies.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.600]  Well, maybe the answer is true.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:59.080]  Maybe they're doing it to half of the Republican candidates.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:05.160]  Well, you know, they have hundreds of people on this bill, they can start to aspect.
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.160]  Sure, sure.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:10.880]  They do have systems, and I know you're going to cover in the show, since the 50s in Japan
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:15.200]  they have coke machines, you know, soft drink machines that actually broadcast directly
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.200]  to the enter here.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:20.080]  And it turns out governments have used those in tests to try to drive people crazy.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:25.600]  But the public's in a trance and some of them that have woken up feel powerless.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:26.600]  So they go ahead and say, who cares?
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.120]  In fact, I'll briefly tell you a story.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:33.280]  I was at the Grand Canyon yesterday, governor, and 14 years ago I'd been there and shown
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.520]  how our land had been signed over to the UN as collateral to the big banks.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:41.400]  And just like they've done in Greece and places, so I went back to the visitor center
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.400]  to show the plaque.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:46.600]  They've torn down the old visitor center, built a giant sprawling complex, but there's
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.600]  the plaque still.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:55.280]  And I start shooting a video, one minute in, a guy walks up with, you know, blues, wind
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:59.880]  break around with American flags and stuff all over it, and he stops, there's nobody
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.920]  around me, I'm not there in the parking lot, he stops while I'm shooting a video, one
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:07.920]  minute in, it's up on YouTube right now, and he says, hold on honey, I got to see what
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:08.920]  this guy's saying.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.720]  And he goes, oh, this guy needs to shut up, you know, I want to take a photo of this.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:18.040]  And he steps in front of me because he didn't like hearing me talk about the UN and the
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.040]  global banks.
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:24.160]  He didn't want to believe that America was in trouble, he saw me as unpatriotic for
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:26.240]  wanting to defend my country.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:31.560]  He thinks patriotism is just being invited to get along.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.960]  What'd you say, guys?
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:38.760]  I said he believes patriotism is going along to get along.
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:39.760]  Yes, that's it.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:44.320]  You know, and that's the worst thing, I mean, Tom Jefferson told us dissensions the greatest
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.680]  form of patriotism.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:53.600]  I can tell you, in all my experience of being a mayor and a governor, they govern best when
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:54.600]  the public participates.
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:17:01.880]  They govern best when the public criticizes and puts them under the microscope.
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:07.040]  They govern worst when they're allowed to do what they want, and the public becomes
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.440]  apathetic and the public doesn't care.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:12.920]  That's when you will get your worst government.
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:17.280]  You get your best government when you hold their feet to the fire.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:22.680]  And people better wake up to that if they throw their hands up in the air and say, well, there's
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.320]  nothing I can do about it.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.480]  Well, that's exactly the reaction that they want you to do.
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.680]  You're playing right into their game when you do that.
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:36.560]  You know, I saw a film a few months ago called The Conspirators, and it's basically a true
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:42.680]  story about Robert Redford about the trial after the killing of Lincoln at the Ford Theater.
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:45.960]  And I forget the name of the briefing, but callers have made that point.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.960]  It's not popping in my head to minute.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:53.200]  But there is a system, and it's shown at the end of the film, Governor, where they go
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:59.840]  ahead and stand in the Secretary of Defense or war, goes ahead and orders the woman executed,
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:06.240]  even though she's been found not guilty by the military tribunal.
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:14.760]  And basically it's kicked up past the tribunal to a higher judge to call for another trial,
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:18.080]  but Stanton ignores that and hangs her.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.520]  But they have the term there, and I looked it up in federal law.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:25.520]  There is a way, even if that judge sat on that and claimed that, that your lawyer can
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:34.280]  kick it up and force the tribunal to at least respond to it and say they'll hear it or not,
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.920]  and then put something public on the record.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.440]  Has your lawyer talked about that?
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:42.240]  No, because it's a catch-22, because there's also something they don't tell you in my
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:50.240]  case, the day you file the lawsuit, you have 60 days in which to appeal it.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:56.000]  Well, the judge sat on it for six months before she had the hearing, and then three more months
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.760]  before she ruled on it.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:02.240]  So if I take it to the Court of Appeals, it gives them the perfect way out.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:07.240]  All they have to do then is rule while the statute of limitations ran out.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.240]  Incredible.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:18.040]  You can't win either way, the point is Alex, the bottom line is this, our government does
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:25.600]  not respect us, the citizens enough, to allow us to make a decision on what's constitutional
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:26.600]  and what is not.
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:27.600]  You're right.
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:34.720]  They do not want any constitutional issue going before a jury, because they cannot control
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:41.600]  a jury, and if a jury rules in the favor in my case, well, that could open up Pandora's
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.960]  box on them, because then there would be a precedence in court.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:50.880]  So the easiest way to defend that is through what they call this administrative law ruling.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:51.880]  Yes, sir.
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:52.880]  Stay there.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:57.640]  Which was back in the days of Woodrow Wilson, when he wanted to bring in the damn Federal
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:58.640]  Reserve.
[01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.140]  Stay there, Gov.
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:05.960]  As we age, we lose both strength and muscle mass, undamaged whey protein from grass-fed
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:10.120]  cows is nature's most powerful food to gain back lost muscle.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:14.640]  Virtually all whey protein powders or drinks have been damaged during processing or are
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.640]  high in sugar.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:20.560]  This damaged whey causes a significant loss in the ability of the body to build new muscle
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.560]  proteins.
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:26.360]  The high sugar content will stop all the benefits of your growth hormone from causing muscle
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:27.360]  repair.
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:32.580]  By giving your body easily absorbed, undamaged whey, free of added sugar, you may be able
[01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:34.800]  to gain back lost muscle and strength.
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:39.440]  One World Whey is truly undamaged whey protein powder, free of added sugar.
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:44.160]  Both young and elderly are reporting increases in muscle strength and size without any additional
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.160]  exercise.

[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:15.480]  I've said on this program before that studies show that in a true crisis, 8 out of 10 people
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:21.280]  will remain sheep-like and passive, frozen, like deer in headlights of an oncoming car,
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:23.120]  waiting for others for help.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:28.200]  One out of 10 will actually panic and endanger family and friends as they melt down, and
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:34.160]  only one out of 10 will take swift and decisive action when the going gets tough, dramatically
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.200]  increasing their chances of survival.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:39.240]  Folks, I've just read a new book called Ready for Anything.

[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:08.760]  The preacher man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River, she's a gold rock.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.760]  We're going to get into a host of other issues with the former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:16.880]  You can get his best-selling book, that's amazing, 63 documents the government doesn't
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:21.240]  want you to read at infowars.com or bookstores everywhere.
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:26.480]  By the way, Governor, you've also got your own site, we'll plug that here in a moment.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:27.480]  The governor hit something key.
[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:31.560]  When I was flying out of Las Vegas a month ago, when I was out there shooting some interviews
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:37.120]  and doing some investigations with Ventura with Jesse, when I'm flying out they had
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:41.400]  me in the business class so I got to go to the short line, but everybody's body scanned
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:42.400]  at that one.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:43.400]  I didn't know that.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:48.560]  So I come out on the other end of the trap and I say I'm not body scanning so they call
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:49.560]  me over.
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:52.400]  I start telling them that's going to give you cancer, they're like no with it.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:56.800]  And then he says, I've got to do this, it's my administrative right or you're going to
[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:01.800]  face the other consequences which are now, they try to arrest you and stuff.
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:06.280]  And I said, well, I do this under distress and he goes, it's my administrative right
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.080]  as the gropelage began and people are like, well, why'd you go through it?
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:13.400]  I wanted to experience it, you know, kind of like, I guess when Jesse was learning how
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:16.640]  to be tortured, you know, nothing compared to that, but I mean, I wanted to actually
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.760]  see what was going on plus I wanted to get home to my family.
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:23.720]  I'd had about three hours sleep, but he said, this is administrative and he goes, it's
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:29.680]  my administrative right and his eyes literally twinkled with that power.
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:33.400]  So I guess his administrative power will also protect him from the radiation which
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:36.400]  the TSA has been caught lying about, Governor.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:40.360]  Well, that's just it, it's called, he hit the nail on the head, Alex.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:45.640]  I learned from my court case, it's called the administrative law ruling and it was back
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:52.360]  in the days of Woodrow Wilson when they created the Federal Reserve, as we all know, our Constitution
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:55.800]  clearly states there will be no central bank.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:01.080]  So the way they looped that was Wilson back then created these administrative law rulings
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:06.240]  that the President does and apparently our courts have let them stand up to where they
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:12.960]  loop the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and that's how their TSA is able to do and
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:18.680]  this guy's able to say that to you because what happened was George Bush did the same
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:21.080]  thing in creating the TSA.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:28.040]  He did it under a presidential thing where he signs it and therefore it makes it exempt
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:33.320]  from the Bill of Rights of the Constitution, it allows it to loop the law, it's called
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:39.760]  an administrative law ruling and that's exactly the essence of my court case of why I am not
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:44.840]  allowed to go to court to determine whether my Fourth Amendment rights are being violated.
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:51.840]  And of course, and here's all they do, the Congress then passes this and gives the TSA
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:59.520]  the ruling of okay, go make our airports safe, well when they give them that instruction
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:05.400]  that means they got carte blanche, they can do anything they want to do to allegedly make
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:11.240]  the airport safe and you have no control, you have no Constitution or Bill of Rights
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:17.000]  protection at airports and the other thing that you need to bottom is like it was stated
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:23.120]  by my attorney and here's another interesting thing Alex, when they rule against you is
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:28.880]  what federal judge Nelson did to me, they don't even do it face to face, they send you
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:29.880]  an email.
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:37.320]  I mean how pathetic and how cowardly is that, they won't even bring you into court, sit
[01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:41.880]  down, look you in the eye and tell you why you can't go to court, they send you an email
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:47.040]  but let me read what the order was at my old attorney, he said, her order dismissing our
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:52.840]  case, the lack of jurisdiction, reads much like the government's brief and does not directly
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:58.760]  address the gist of our argument regarding the constitutional absurdity of being subject
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:06.320]  to a secret order that can be changed in secret at any time and without notice and cannot
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:09.360]  be challenged in a district court.
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:10.360]  Unbelievable.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:16.480]  Now that's he ruled in favor of that and so when you go to an airport, you don't even
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:22.520]  know what the rules are, they don't even have to tell you so you got all these little guys
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:29.000]  like that guy you ran into who are kings of their own domain, in essence he can do anything
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:35.920]  he wants there and you can't know the rules, he can grope you anywhere, he can take you
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:41.520]  in the back room, hey if I was a pedophile I'd get a job doing this in a minute.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:45.320]  Well they've caught a lot of them doing that but that's key what you just said because
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:49.560]  they admit now over two million Americans are on the no fly list, no way to get off
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:54.560]  of it, won't tell you why you're on it, that whole thing is secret, no judge, no jury,
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:59.280]  the end of our entire system, they put three-year-old kids on it, now they're saying to drive down
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:01.560]  the highway you're going to have to have their authorization.
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:06.880]  Yeah, well they'll do it with these administrative law rulings until we as a people stand up
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:08.440]  and tell them enough of this.
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:15.200]  Well that's what I'm saying, what's the China, what's that, exactly I'm saying no
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:19.880]  due process, worse than China and they just say administratively we say you can't fly
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:25.320]  and now they're saying they're going to have an administrative no gun by list governor.
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:31.680]  I wouldn't doubt it for a minute, every one of our constitutional bill of rights is being
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:35.520]  assaulted by our very elected officials by them allowing them to do this.

[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:20.640]  shots.
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:25.440]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:30.960]  Full, the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:35.680]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:39.960]  William Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:42.120]  is saying who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:47.960]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall

[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:31.240]  shooting interviews for my films and believe me he used to like to travel now he's like
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:36.440]  do I have to go on the road and I at a certain point I have to morally say no you don't here's
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:42.120]  the company RV but now they're going to set up highway checkpoints now this dovetails
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:46.960]  into the the protesters being attacked the bill of rights under attack all of it with
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:52.320]  Governor Ventura but the heart of the matter is this administrative law they set up the
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:57.760]  CIA in 47 and said it would be reviewable by Congress but would be a basically above
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:58.760]  the law.
[01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:04.600]  Now when the EPA shuts down selective power plants that aren't part of the insiders they
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:09.520]  declare that it's administrative that Congress has given them a blank check with all of the
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:15.240]  common law and all the federal rulings until about the 50s and 60s stated this stuff is
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:17.160]  not even law it's a fraud.
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:23.360]  So they just have made up Trump bologna that they then slap on top and do things that the
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:28.760]  most authoritarian states don't even do and now they're saying they're going to have a
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:33.200]  no-gun buy list folks are you ready for that you didn't do anything wrong no judge no jury
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:37.640]  you're not a felon you're on the list TSA says they want to have a system where you
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:45.280]  don't get a job unless they authorize you to have one this is a total and complete federal
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:52.320]  power grab Governor Ventura how I mean how far how far can this corruption go I mean
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:56.680]  I know they're now teaching police everywhere but the Constitution is not relevant I see
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:35:01.680]  that in state and federal cases where the judge says to people you don't bring the Constitution
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:09.000]  in my courtroom to lawyers is this not classical treason I would think so you know it it'll
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:14.760]  go as far as we allow them to go with it because ultimately Alex it's our fault it
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:20.520]  is you know and for being laissez-faire for being asleep at the wheel whatever you want
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:26.000]  to say for not being concerned for living in our own little lives and not paying attention
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  to what they're doing so whatever happens to this country is ultimately the people's
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:36.720]  fault now but you still can't blame them solely there are some dastardly people that are running
[01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:44.240]  our country and dastardly people that are in control of the power and you know it's
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:49.320]  very frustrating because you think no one's out there listening you think no one cares
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:54.760]  because everyone just sits back and accepts it accepts it like lemmings you know no one
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:36:01.560]  voices any concern again I would love to see the day where everyone would boycott the airport
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:06.760]  in protest but you can't get people to do that because they think they've been made
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:14.440]  safe they think that because of 9-11 this is required in airports to keep us safe and
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:19.080]  it's gonna spill out of the airports and it's gonna spill into everybody's life and
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:24.480]  I guess nobody's gonna truly believe it until they come up to your home without a warrant
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:29.360]  and they come inside to search it and then I've even had people say to me well I've got
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:36.560]  nothing to hide why should I care if they do that you know that's the attitude you got
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:41.960]  out there amongst a great deal of people Alex well I'm not a criminal I don't care what
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:47.400]  they do I have nothing to hide exactly but what about government in history the horrible
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:52.720]  things it does when it's not kept on a short leash as our founders with common sense pointed
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:58.800]  out but think about the precept the idea that anywhere there's a potential danger government
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:05.080]  has a right to put its hands on you to stop you to arrest you to keep you safe there could
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:08.960]  well then I guess you can't ride a horse you might fall off of your kill you can't go surface
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:13.960]  and that used to be the greatness of this country the greatness of this country was
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:19.040]  the fact that you were you could come here and be self-reliant that you wouldn't have
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:25.720]  a government hovering over your head and that yes it will stumble and make mistakes yes
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:31.560]  things will happen but it's like what I used to say when I was governor you can't legislate
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:39.040]  stupidity people will do stupid things that's also part of freedom the freedom to be stupid
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:45.520]  you have freedom to be smart and freedom goes both ways and you can't sit back and jury
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:50.000]  pick what you're going to be free and what's not going to be free well it gives the feds
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.760]  an excuse to go everywhere if there's a shadowy enemy they can't defeat but let me tell you
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:57.360]  a quick story in your take on it then Aaron Dix has got a question who's up there in the
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:38:05.480]  studio in Austin all right it's down there I'm up here in Utah I went to a meteor crater
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:09.520]  where one of the biggest meteors ever hit the earth and when I'd been there as a child
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:13.520]  they let us hike down the bottom and the guy said no because of lawsuits even if you sign
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:18.640]  a form lawyers still sue they've taken the diving boards out of the swimming pools they're
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:22.800]  taking the metal slides out everywhere they're taking the merry-go-round out then I could
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:26.720]  do the Grand Canyon and I said these areas were open when I was in college they go not
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:33.760]  now and they're even talking about getting rid of the mule rides where you can't do that
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:39.480]  because somebody might get hurt sometime and then I got to Monument Valley Utah I hadn't
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:43.320]  read the fine print and they said oh you're not allowed to go in 90 plus percent unless
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:47.640]  it's on a little truck and you can't really get off you could just go to the front of
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:52.680]  it and look at them because somebody might get hurt and I mean literally this country
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:59.600]  is going beyond journeys we've seen in 90s. Why do you think I live half the year in Mexico?
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:05.280]  Yeah. I go to things down there called the bloodless bull fights where they don't hurt
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:10.120]  the bull you still have the matador the matador is in danger but the bull isn't harmed at
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:14.320]  all and so I don't have a problem with that well one of the things that they do things
[01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:20.320]  in Mexico you wouldn't dare do here like they got a thing where they take two people out
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:25.000]  of the crowd and they put them on a teeter totter you know that goes up and down. Yeah.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:30.800]  Only this one also circles like a propeller and then they let a bull lose and the bull
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:36.560]  charges so you got to go up when the bull goes underneath you. I mean it's hilarious I turned
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:42.880]  to my wife I said oh my god could you imagine if somebody proposed this in the United States?
[01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:50.280]  See I like living in Mexico because down there you're kind of on your own and if you do
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:56.600]  something stupid like if I go out surfing alone and I hit my head on the board and I drown
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:01.040]  out there well the Mexican people they're going to feel bad for me and they're going
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:04.880]  to probably say a prayer for me and all that stuff but ultimately they're going to say
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:11.560]  what a big dummy he was why would you think of going swimming alone? Exactly. I mean that's
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:16.720]  what's so complicated as you've said you'd rather face the danger. Exactly. Then lose
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:23.600]  my freedoms I would rather be able to go be stupid and go out into the water alone and
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:29.840]  kill myself than to have the army or the police on shore saying nobody's allowed to swim
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:35.440]  because you might kill yourself. Well that's always the greatest danger as well. Aaron
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:39.840]  Dykes I believe Aaron's riding shotgun there Aaron you had a question for Governor Ventura?
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:44.400]  Yeah I did and I wanted to go back to the great quote from Benjamin Franklin that he
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:49.880]  brought up regarding if you trade your liberty for security you end up with neither and how
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:55.260]  many things have we been asked to compromise our liberty on under the name of national
[01:40:55.260 --> 01:41:00.280]  security and the rest of it where safety cannot be guaranteed and with that in mind I ask
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:05.760]  how long has the government known that these X-ray body scanners are dangerous? Oh I don't
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:10.120]  think they've ever done proper testing at all. If it's so sick you don't want to put
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:16.360]  them in shirt off. Yeah but I've got to pay big money he works for them now this was your
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:21.400]  typical Halliburton pay over. But the reason I bring that up is because I've got a report
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:27.680]  here from earlier this month that the government studied these X-ray body scanners in 1998
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:32.000]  and found that they were dangerous and could cause up to 100 cases of cancer a year. How's
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:52.600]  that for keeping us safe? Well that's what happened in Vegas is I just abbreviated what
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:56.880]  happened I said listen I'm not going through that that increases cancer I've seen even
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:02.600]  the articles of the New York Times and they're like no John Hopkins says it's safe and I
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.440]  looked at the guy and I said John Hopkins head of radiology went public and said he
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:10.640]  never talked to them and did do a study for the government and found massive increases
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:14.880]  in radiation and the guy responds and goes this is the second generation it's safe and
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:19.040]  I rattled off the name of it and said no you're wrong they've got an eight-year study at Boston
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:24.680]  Logan where they first put these in a seven-in-fold increase in cancer clusters and he said nope
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:29.680]  you're wrong and then started his administrative rights garbage I mean it's just you even want
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:34.680]  to help these people but they don't care it's too much of a power trap to be able to grow
[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:41.360]  people's genitals. Well it's a case too of like I was so proud of that big marine during
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:47.920]  the Wall Street protest that stood out there with his iraq ribbons on his shirt and he looked
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:52.800]  at those police the stormtroopers who were getting ready to do in the protesters if they
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:58.760]  could and he challenged them he said where is your honor where is your honor and I say
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:04.840]  that to any policeman out there any military person out there remember you take an oath
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:11.240]  to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and always remember your honor is your honor
[01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:17.440]  more important than is it your job. We know governor that's a really good point if the
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:23.920]  Constitution is dead and that's what they teach now at the federal level if it's dead
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:29.600]  why do they still swear an oath to it to defend it from enemies foreign and domestic we've
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:34.520]  definitely got some some domestic enemies. Oh we've got huge domestic enemies against
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:39.520]  the Constitution Bill of Rights the majority of the leaders of our country seem to be that
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:45.560]  way or whoever in charge running the departments it may not be the elected people maybe it's
[01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:51.400]  just deals like that Colonel Pauley said in his book the secret team where he exposes
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:57.520]  who truly runs the government it's the bureaucrats at high level who remain there after elected
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:00.920]  people come and go. Look at Europe they're calling it. They're calling it. They're calling
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:07.320]  it to do anything they want. Look at Europe Jesse they're saying technocratic elite they're
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:11.680]  saying all these former Bilderberg people all these central bankers they now are being
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:16.400]  put in as the presidents and prime ministers are saying they're above the law they're calling
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:21.480]  it technocrats. Whatever they want to call it but I'll tell you that's why people got
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:27.680]  to support these this movement against Wall Street. It's not a movement against capitalism
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:33.480]  it's not a movement to make us communists which is what mainstream media tries to portray
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:40.880]  it what it simply is it's a movement stating Wall Street stop corporations stop buying
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:46.640]  our politicians because unfortunately Alex I'll be the one to say this on the record
[01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:51.720]  there's a former military person you don't serve the people of the United States anymore
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:57.360]  you don't serve the Constitution of the Bill of Rights our military is the muscle for the
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:02.880]  corporate power if they can't beat them in the corporate boardrooms then they'll send
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:08.640]  in the US Marines. Well that's what Smedley Butler said 80 years ago. Exactly and it's
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:16.280]  been going on for 100 years nothing has changed all these wars are not wars for freedom they're
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:25.280]  wars of corporate greed nothing more. These people attack us if we weren't over there
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:33.480]  occupying them. Well said speaking of the Republican candidates of course CBS News got
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:40.040]  caught giving Ron Paul the televised portion 89 seconds of giving Romney more than 10 and
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:44.920]  then they got a memo where Bachman was only supposed to get two minutes Paul 90 seconds
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:50.480]  Paul was given 89 seconds now when he wins polls they just remove him from the winner
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:55.400]  place I mean that shows how scared they are. Oh they're scared to death Ron Paul's got
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:46:01.880]  him on the run hopefully Ron Paul will do something after they won't give him the Republican
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:07.480]  nomination because rest assured he's not going to get it and hopefully he'll be courageous
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:12.440]  enough and take the bold step to become the libertarian and be our candidate but we'll
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:17.320]  have to wait and see on that but the rest of these I'll tell you they're disillusional
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:21.320]  how can somebody how can you take someone serious who gets up there and tells you God
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:31.000]  told him to run. I mean. Well that's unsanically to get the evangelical. So that means I guess
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:34.240]  he's going to be there and God's going to be telling them what to do it's kind of like
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:40.840]  when George Bush was questioned on the invasion of Iraq and they asked him well did you consult
[01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:47.120]  your father and Bush turned around proudly and said no I consulted a higher father and
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:53.320]  I almost fell out of the chair I said you mean this SOB wants me to believe he talked
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:58.480]  to God and God told him to invade Iraq. Well that's like the head of Goldman Sachs says
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:06.400]  he's doing God's work. Well any of these evangelical people out there if you buy into that you
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:12.560]  are a bunch of idiots. If you really and truly believe that these high elected officials
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:19.600]  have been told by God. Well that's what they told us. That was Hitler's favorite passage
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:23.200]  just do whatever the government says you know throw people in ovens in order to it's
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:30.320]  of the Lord. It's very sick. The JFK anniversary is coming up. I know you're speaking at a
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:36.720]  prestigious dinner. They've now released the Arthur Schlesinger Jr. tapes of I've always
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:40.720]  been told this by Jim Morris and others but now it's released that Jackie Kennedy said
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:44.880]  that the LBJ had him killed. Now we have the deathbed confession that you first aired on
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:49.800]  TV last year on television for the first time of E. Howard Hunt and the confession. He lost
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:56.000]  the lawsuit when he tried to shoot spotlight you know 30 years ago and now all these people
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:01.480]  come out. I mean this is pretty much open and shut now gov. But it's not Alex because
[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:08.080]  mainstream media who have bamboozled us for 50 years still will not say a word about it
[01:48:08.080 --> 01:48:14.440]  nor will they admit that they were wrong. That Lee Harvey Oswald did not kill John Kennedy
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:22.240]  and if he was involved he certainly was not alone and yet mainstream media ignores everything
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:29.640]  you say and continue to do it and they will never admit it. Alex you could have a film
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:36.840]  of somebody shooting from behind the picket fence and they still would not accept it.
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:42.000]  You know you could have one of the shooters come forward if they're still alive and say
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.960]  yep I was the guy in the Daltex building or I was the guy behind the picket fence and
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:53.400]  he could provide all the information needed. He still wouldn't see the light of day because
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:59.120]  always remember from the power brokers if they can kill the president and get away with
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:04.200]  it what can't they do. Well there's always a bridge to fall with humorist but I agree
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:09.680]  with you they certainly think they're invincible. Now MF Global has taken 1.2 million of private
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:15.040]  accounts and they're actually admitting it's illegal but saying no one will get in trouble
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:21.840]  because Corzine is basically above the law. Well isn't that interesting too and I'm glad.
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:29.000]  Isn't he a Democrat? Yes. Yes see so it ain't just the Republicans it's the Democrats also
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:35.720]  and people better wake up to that. I've been harping on it now for 20 to 25 years that
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:41.400]  these two political parties are not the solution they're the problem. John Adams warned us
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:46.080]  way back when they formed the country he said the fall of the United States would not come
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:51.360]  from a force outside it would come from within and it would be when political parties take
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:59.400]  over the government. He said party factionalization where we have a two-party dictatorship. Exactly
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:05.920]  it's just like pro wrestling Alex people wake up in front of the cameras they don't like
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:12.440]  each other behind the scenes they're working together and earning money that's exactly
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:19.680]  what pro wrestling is and now if you'll believe that for pro wrestling why won't you believe
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:24.440]  it for the politicians. Well gov I'm just glad that you're on this TSA thing because
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:27.800]  you're bringing a lot of light to it and things are coming to a head we had to make
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:32.280]  opt out last year on Thanksgiving we didn't launch that this year we we need to get groups
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:43.800]  pushed. Final questions and comments for Jesse Ventura of course we sell his book 63 documents

[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:09.920]  I had almost forgotten this and and and then it popped in my head Tyrell called me last
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:14.680]  Monday and said oh boy the David Ike thing didn't go too well and I said well he was
[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:19.200]  in the show two seasons ago it was very fair and he said yeah they just you know it just
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:24.040]  didn't go well he was just letting me know what had happened and because David had put
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:31.040]  out a big article and I admire Governor Ventura you know you know Ike is a very charismatic
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:36.320]  guy I believe what he's saying and I appreciate his work as well it's sad to see what happened
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:41.440]  but gov you never talk about the TV show until it's out but obviously this information
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:46.880]  is now out so I want to ask you you want to interview Ike in Pennsylvania Cleveland
[01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:53.960]  Cleveland Ohio and what happened there between you and David Ike well he just I don't know
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:58.680]  he got all offended and told me to f off and walked off the interview simply I was asking
[01:54:58.680 --> 01:55:06.880]  him questions about his expertise and that's reptilians and you know I go from a point of
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:11.560]  you know there is no dumb question if I don't understand it it's certainly not dumb to me
[01:55:11.560 --> 01:55:17.440]  I was trained that way by Chief Warren Officer in demolition when I went through Navy SEAL
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:22.560]  training and that's how I've lived my life and apparently he doesn't like to be questioned
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:28.200]  about anything that he believes in or anything that he espouses and I think that's ridiculous
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:33.000]  because if you believe in what you say then you should have no problem discussing it with
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:38.360]  anyone and I just found him to be one of the worst interviews I've ever possibly done
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:47.120]  because he's not forthcoming at all well he had been sick and I've almost wished you
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:52.600]  guys via Skype can do it again and you know try it one more time because you know two
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:58.120]  years ago you guys had a positive interview with him and you know he's really great on
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:03.920]  so many issues and I'm just I mean I know this you guys weren't intending to do a fair
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:09.600]  interview correct absolutely everything I did on that episode pointed to going to him
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:17.560]  to get answers but getting answers from him is impossible I told him I said oh no they
[01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:21.360]  weren't an open minded thing and you're basically the star of this episode this you know this
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:27.160]  interview and but it is reality so sometimes things get things get crazy I just there's
[01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:32.920]  so few of us that are really questioning reality in the official domain but it's a way with
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:36.880]  it because he tells you right at the opening thing he looks right at you and says nothing
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:43.920]  is real nothing is what it is so when he opens that door that means he can say anything
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:48.480]  he wants and he doesn't have to defend it with any facts or anything because nothing's
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:55.360]  real and it's laughable when somebody says that to you or to be anyway you know you and
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:57:02.080]  I call this radio show for a debate that'd be that'd be you know I don't think I care
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:07.640]  too I don't think it would go anywhere Alex because he he obviously took great offense
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:12.960]  to me and I don't know why I you know all I did was ask him questions that were pertinent
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:19.680]  things that I wanted to get hopefully answers before you go to Mexico within the next month
[01:57:19.680 --> 01:57:24.200]  or two we can talk about it but it's a side issue I just no problem I mean I don't lose
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:28.440]  sleep over it he goes on and I go on he's making a lot of money that's for sure what
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:33.840]  was the question he raised that he got angry at any one of them there wasn't one there
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:37.960]  was the whole interview you know I think he misunderstood reading his article because
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:41.680]  he said he sat there for an hour and then he wanted to meet you and they didn't bring
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:46.280]  him in I don't think he understood that with that you know with real reality TV they don't
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:50.520]  they want to keep you guys separate so the meetings knew if you read his article what
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:55.040]  you told me off air you haven't I think I think he took it like like it was a setup
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:58:00.480]  he didn't know that the lighting guys were just as usual taking their time well I don't
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:04.880]  know anything about that to you know and I'm not gonna worry about it you know I'm I'm
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:10.280]  there I was there to interview him he clearly didn't want to talk to me about anything and
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:14.880]  when he did he wouldn't answer any questions he attacked me all right well God bless you
[01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:20.680]  have a great time Mexico be safe and you're talking to libertarians off record you might
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:25.400]  run huh no I wouldn't hold my breath on it I've just spoken to them and they've spoken
[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:30.320]  to me and the lines of dialogue are open it's not anything positive about they'll have their
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:35.880]  convention in early May and at that convention they will decide who's gonna be the candidate

[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:45.000]  but the Mike Adams to do the show that day and I'll be back live Friday after Thanksgiving
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:50.400]  for the next 30 minutes we're joined by the one the only Max Kaiser and we'll get some
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:55.760]  questions and analysis for my Aaron here as well but I remember Max Kaiser a year ago
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:01.400]  saying that if we drive up gold and 2500 they won't be able to deliver we drive up silver
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:07.080]  pass I forget what he said 54 or something they won't be able to deliver and and and
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:13.240]  we'll call them on well now MF global we're learning it's first 600 million then 700 million
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:19.080]  then a billion then a million two now it's a more than a billion two CNN reports is gone
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:26.880]  they've gone bankrupt for 6.4 billion they can't find over 1.2 billion and they've announced
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:30.440]  that Corzine is just allowed basically to keep it they say don't worry about where it's
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:35.000]  at that's the way it is and now Salete's being attacked by the head of the CME group one
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.080]  of the biggest derivatives outfits that claims they have 800 trillion they're at I've got
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:44.800]  Forbes attacking me and saying it's all my fault that the economy's down I'm talking
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:49.640]  about about CME and all this this is bizarre Max Kaiser we're gonna come back and recap
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:54.080]  all this we start the next segment but I tell you Max it's getting a little creepy when
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:58.280]  I got the New York Times saying I'm responsible for the guy shooting up the White House with
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:07.560]  no proof and also now Forbes saying headline talk show host Alex Jones and guest are causing
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:12.360]  bank runs basically and because you know that they are admitting now that the markets are
[02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:18.160]  going down and stop especially derivatives because nobody trusted because of FEMF global
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:24.040]  so now it's not their fault for taking all the money Max it's my fault and Gerald Saletex
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:34.240]  what do you think of that Max Kaiser Alex where are you calling from I'm calling from
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:43.360]  Utah I'm hiding out from yeah okay it sounds like this was your one call that they gave
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:47.040]  you and they you're in prison or something and you called me thank you so much for calling
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:57.280]  me with your one call but the the MF global of course is just the continuation of what
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:04.640]  we have been witnessing but instead of using derivatives to steal money they just are taking
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:11.080]  it out of people's accounts now the news that just hit the wire just a few minutes ago is
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:18.840]  that the the bankruptcy procedure proceedings are I've just disclosed that they've run out
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:26.560]  of money in terms of what they can return to people to customers and they can only return
[02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:32.800]  maybe 50 or 60% of customer money but I'm sure that number will go down and again and I'm
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:38.840]  sure customers will be lucky to get 10 or 20 cent on the dollar now it's important to
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:48.000]  remember that a similar situation just happened in China last week somebody caught stealing
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:53.960]  money conducting a Ponzi scheme falsifying documents as Corzina's falsified documents
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:04:01.680]  and the Chinese government executed the banker they executed the banker dead so the Chinese
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:08.880]  government gets it the only way to stop these guys is you've got to kill them now in America
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:15.720]  they haven't figured that out yet and they're just going to keep coming with their larcenistic
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:22.160]  Ponzi schemes until all the money is gone so until America gets his smartens up like
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:29.080]  China already has expect more of the same Alex Max guys are joining us from Paris again

[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:18.720]  network okay Max Kaiser comes to us from Paris France I'm coming to you from southern Utah
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:23.920]  right on the Arizona border monument valley I'm here really shooting footage for upcoming
[02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:28.600]  film also doing research about a whole bunch of videos I'm gonna upload more than 20 of
[02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:33.320]  them to info wars dot com and prison planet dot TV in the next few days as soon as I get
[02:08:33.320 --> 02:08:38.880]  back to civilization but I do enjoy it out here I know why this was the favorite stomping
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:44.400]  ground of many out west of John Wayne in fact a little lodge I'm staying in is where John
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:49.400]  Wayne stayed a quiet bit of the time not just when he was shooting more than 10 films out
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:55.480]  there folks Max Kaiser a year ago said that if gold went up to a certain point I think
[02:08:55.480 --> 02:09:00.880]  he said 2,500 silver what do you say $54 an ounce if they went up to that point it would
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:06.680]  force the naked shorting by the big brokerage firms to be pushed to the surface they wouldn't
[02:09:06.680 --> 02:09:12.360]  be able to deliver and it would bankrupt them but now what they've done is the internal
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:18.760]  bank run grabbing sequestered private what's the proper term segregated accounts which
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:28.200]  is illegal now a week and a half ago the head of the security and the CFTC came out
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:32.280]  and said I'm gonna have to recuse myself from this investigation I'm involved with MF Global
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:38.640]  and Corzine and Goldman Sachs and they said it's 600 million of them billion missing
[02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:43.720]  had gone to JP Morgan now they say well first they were saying this is obviously illegal
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:51.720]  this is wrong you can't grab private accounts in a bankruptcy now they're just saying forget
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:10:00.840]  about it it's 1.2 billion or more and that's the end of it and and some of you might get
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:06.080]  50 60% others like Gerald Salente who had been trading with the one firm for close to 30
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:11.440]  years that MF Global had gobbled up they just took the money he added his account that he
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:15.640]  was taking December delivery on so that's his account to basically engage in futures
[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:19.800]  trading but that's the money he's put in it's equivalent to coming in somebody's house
[02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:25.560]  and stealing money out of their out of their safe or stealing somebody's car but because
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:33.960]  it's done in a legalese way and by the ruling class banksters hey it's okay now it's destroyed
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:38.040]  confidence it's caused the markets to go down it's caused the future markets to go down
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:42.920]  Max Kaiser these are the kind of guess we have on over and over again the people that
[02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:47.200]  are right the people that have foresight to people that really have full spectrum analysis
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:53.560]  Max Kaiser has stunningly broken down so much of this now it's happening but we're seeing
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:58.600]  something really creepy Forbes has come out the headline talk show host Alex Jones and
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:06.040]  guest call for run on banks no what we said last week was that if they continue to steal
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:09.800]  people's money it's going to destroy confidence and cause a run on the bank because of their
[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:16.560]  internal runs now the head of the CME group has come out the tax cylinder viciously it's
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:21.120]  getting really creepy so that they says most of what he's gotten is warnings about midnight
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:27.080]  raids or 3am raids but also some threats the New York Times has come out and accused
[02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:33.040]  me an Obama deception my film of causing we got to shoot the White House so they're clearly
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:40.160]  coming after us they're clearly concerned so I want to ask Max Kaiser what's happening
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:45.200]  here what does this signify and are they doing this because they're desperate I mean they
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:53.680]  can always come up with a billion two of made up cash they've got trillions in citizen bailout
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:58.760]  that we gave them why don't they at least give cash back again it's the people with
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:03.480]  gold accounts they're seizing is it because they can't deliver and why would they do something
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:09.160]  this reckless endangering their entire derivatives bubble even more or is that part of the financial
[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:15.000]  terrorism where they're ready for the next level of bloodletting that's my breakdown
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.720]  with retired top trader Max Kaiser inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange virtual trading
[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:31.000]  system Max at a breakdown how big this is well it's a question of momentum and MF global
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:36.400]  was on the 50th floor of the World Trade Tower of fraud that's collapsing on everyone's
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:42.920]  network and you had another 60 or 70 stores above it that's collapsing and falling in
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:47.440]  the all the sovereign debts collapsing all the major balance sheets of all the biggest
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:52.880]  banks are collapsing and MF global is collateral damage that's collapsing there's another brokerage
[02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:58.080]  firm called Jeffery which is just now collapsing if you do a search for Jeffery you'll find
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:04.800]  out that now this is teetering on bankruptcy now with the MF global when with you know
[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:10.400]  Gerald Salente of course famously is gotten stung by this I mean when you think about
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:15.640]  it the monthly statement sent to him and all the customers of all the brokerage accounts
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:20.240]  that are related to MF global those are falsified documents because those monthly statements
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:25.520]  do not represent the truth in any way and which means that nobody should have any trust
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:30.680]  in any of this brokerage statements they get from narrow linch or they get from any brokerage
[02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:37.000]  on Wall Street or any bank statement Bernie Madoff well it's Bernie Madoff at least had
[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:42.440]  the courtesy of running a policy scheme this is just outright theft this is when you go
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:47.600]  into an account that's supposed to be segregated that is the customer's account itself and
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:52.680]  you just take the money out that's like I rob your house and steal your money that's
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:57.440]  not even the elegance of a policy scheme or a derivative contract sold it doesn't exist
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:03.040]  I mean these things are really look like I'll give you the very interesting thing I found
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:10.080]  when I just came back from London and I was handed in a cab a five pound note from the
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:17.800]  Royal Bank of Scotland and I then tried to spend this at a pub and now I was told that
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:23.960]  this no good this this Royal Bank of Scotland note is no good it turns out that the money
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:29.520]  printed in Scotland is not all it's only accepted in England if both parties agree
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:34.840]  to accept it now that's very interesting because in other words it's it you think it's
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:39.720]  money but it's only money if both parties agree to accept it so it's not really money
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:45.680]  it's it's a receipt of a possibility of money and this is what the US dollar is the US dollar
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:51.120]  itself is only good if two people agreed to accept it but if if you don't agree accept
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:55.360]  it it has zero worth and that's now what people are understanding about the banking system
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:15:01.200]  about MF global about Merrill Lynch about Goldman Sachs about JP Morgan that documents
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:05.320]  the monthly statements that you get in the mail from these guys every single month are
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:09.920]  complete lies it's false if you call up the bank and you ask for the Kustip number of
[02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:13.800]  the securities that are supposed to be representative in that account they can't give it to you
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:17.880]  because they don't exist it's complete forgery when I was working on Wall Street we used
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:23.240]  to forge documents all the time account forms transfer forms and this type of stuff but
[02:15:23.240 --> 02:15:29.160]  this is that that's really just penny anti stuff compared to actually wholesale sending
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:34.720]  out falsified monthly statements you'd have to go back to some of the small timers like
[02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:41.640]  DH Blair and other chop shops on Wall Street that were engaged in this type of bucket shop
[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:47.520]  activity where they they they sell junk over the phone they send us false documents you'd
[02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:52.600]  have to go back to the 1920s to find this level of fraud and of course all the all the rules
[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:57.800]  that came in during the 30s to put an end to this have been regulated out of existence
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:02.760]  so we're back to the 1920s bucket shop Merrill Lynch is a bucket shop JP Morgan is a bucket
[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:07.080]  shop Goldman Sachs are a bucket shop and the name bucket shop comes from the fact that
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:12.440]  you had a room full of guys on telephone and so they don't didn't disturb each other they
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:19.640]  were buckets on their head and this this became known as the bucket shop and this is the history
[02:16:19.640 --> 02:16:26.680]  of false selling on Wall Street and it's come full circle now we're back to the worst excesses
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:32.800]  of the worst bucket shop and policy scheme dealers of the 1920s and of course getting
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:39.360]  to golden silver JP Morgan to defend their silver short position they've had to totally
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:46.840]  obliterate their balance sheet you know JP Morgan is insolvent and one day it'll go like
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:51.360]  MF global they'll say you know what one day it'll be worth 140 billion the next day it'll
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:56.480]  be worth nothing and it'll just go down like that all the accounts are uninsured none
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:00.440]  of the accounts are insured because there's no there's no money to back any of those accounts
[02:17:00.440 --> 02:17:04.880]  that's that's worth anything that anyone's going to honor for any transaction outside
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:09.600]  of two people who are both severely brain damaged and on drugs would take anything resembling
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:15.680]  a US dollar collateralize the bank account from JP Morgan so you basically have to come
[02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:21.800]  to terms with the fact that unless you have golden silver you you have absolutely no money
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:26.320]  whatsoever at any given day you can be an MF global customer you can wake up and they
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:30.840]  simply say that money is absolutely worth but it's coming anyway you know what we've
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:35.120]  been talking about this because I've got to interject this and I hope we can hold you
[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:39.600]  a little bit longer than 30 minutes I know you're very busy also very nice riding shotgun
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:43.920]  there at the network so I want to pop in with some questions but but but I understand this
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:48.520]  is premeditated they set up a police state to get away with it but it looks like they've
[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:54.480]  been too greedy this is endangering their entire system was this done the looting of the accounts
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:18:02.400]  of desperation or is it just a new trial balloon what's your gut on this well the core team
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:07.640]  came into MF global and he wanted to create this really big firm to compete with his old
[02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:12.960]  he used to be the CEO of Goldman Sachs and he came in and he leveraged the company from
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:19.720]  maybe 10 or 15 to 1 he leveraged it at 100 to 1 buying sovereign debt in Europe so all
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:25.560]  it took was 1% move in the in the direction of sovereign debt of the Italian bond or Greek
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:31.040]  bond for the experiment we wiped out oh and by the way based on the balance sheet of leveraging
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:36.840]  in 100 to 1 he paid himself an enormous multi-million dollar bonus then the markets moved against
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:43.240]  them by 1% and the probability of that is about 100% and the firm's bankrupt he keeps
[02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:48.040]  his money the customers get nothing and the government has to deal with paying off anyone
[02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:52.320]  in any way that they can the taxpayers pay that doesn't sound like an investing guru
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:58.080]  that sounds like some person that robs back so they can go gamble in Las Vegas this sounds
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:04.360]  like a completely insane degenerate compulsive gambler yeah it's like core team took these
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:09.800]  out the entire value of that of that firm millions of hundreds of millions of dollars
[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:16.040]  and went into Las Vegas stepped up to the roulette wheel and didn't even put black or red he
[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:22.280]  put it on a number like number 37 you know like if the odds are extraordinarily minute
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:28.040]  that it would win and of course he lost he lost to that bet and he lost not only the
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:34.840]  entire firm's equity but he lost all the all the associated debt you know all the leverage
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:38.240]  and everything that's now being bailed out to the tune of millions and millions and
[02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:43.640]  millions stay there stay there Max this is a suicide banker then taking us all with them

[02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:13.800]  Well Max is going to be with us pretty much for the rest of the hour Aaron Dykes is there
[02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:18.480]  scanning the news as we speak I'm going to get Kurt Nebel or Paul Watson to post the
[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:24.000]  article or Aaron can run in there and do it himself while he co-hosts with me credit
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:31.000]  swiss a big ratings outfit an investment group there are predicting something pretty big
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:37.440]  and it's basically what we've already been saying I mean it's just the facts of history
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:42.400]  but before we give you this breaking news listen to what Max Keiser said and during
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:48.240]  the break we were talking it's literally like taking everybody's private accounts in sub
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:54.000]  companies and banking systems and brokerage firms that MF global had bought out sometimes
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:25:00.080]  hostily they buy your company they buy your credit union whatever it is and then you go
[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:06.800]  to get your money and they tell you sorry we're keeping it this is the gamblers that
[02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:11.600]  run these big companies as things get worse and worse they're taking more and more reckless
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:17.920]  bets which makes it get even more and more out of control so I want to ask Max Keiser
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:24.960]  after we cover this top news story this breaking news who is the winner because we know core
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:31.520]  signs up there betting on one number the entire house and everybody's pensions you name it
[02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:37.040]  on one number which is totally insane I mean one chance out of like you said 100 he would
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:45.360]  make it yeah but who is the house who is the casino who is winning at the end and and and
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:50.240]  have they in their call for a new bank of the world and all this gone too far will they discredit
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:54.800]  themselves so bad it doesn't work short segment but but I want you to answer that in the moment
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:59.200]  but Aaron Aaron Dykes give them the breaking news and get Max Keiser's quote on that first
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:06.160]  well this is up at zero hedge Alex credit suisse goes for broke predicts end of euro and bank runs
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:11.040]  there's a lot here but one of the key quotes is we seem to have entered the last days of the euro
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:15.520]  as we currently know it it doesn't make a breakup very likely but it does mean some extraordinary
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:20.880]  things almost certainly happen to prevent the progressive closure of all the eurozone sovereign
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:26.240]  bond markets and potentially accompanied by escalating runs and they're calling for more
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:34.000]  intervention from the ECB of course yeah well that's exactly what we've been saying is the
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:39.600]  problem and what's been happening with Greece and Ireland and Italy people are pulling their money
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:46.400]  out of these out of these banks and they're just causing more instability and making the situation
[02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:54.480]  become ever greater more of a crisis and so Germany of course is in the catbird seat because
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:59.280]  if there's a little cheap euro because of uncertainty they have a big export market
[02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:02.880]  but if they end up federalizing the entire eurozone and launching euro bonds they're all
[02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:07.360]  going to come out of Berlin and Berlin and Deutsche Bank will be a huge winner in that case so
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:12.080]  Germany and you know Germany and England are now back at each other's throat Cameron
[02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:16.960]  and Merkel recently got together and Merkel basically read Cameron the riot act and said
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:21.760]  look punk you don't tell us what you want us to do go back into a little island over there and
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:28.080]  shut up so Germany is swinging its weight around in the continental Europe so they're now emerging
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:35.520]  as I predicted two years ago Germany is emerging as a superpower and they own the reunification of
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:39.440]  the country they bring back the Deutsche Marker the equivalent of the Deutsche Marker just run
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:46.080]  the eurozone from Berlin and they are Germany 4.0 the fourth right and they're quite proud of it
[02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:50.640]  and now they're stretching their wings and they're just you know hitting Cameron in the space they
[02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:56.640]  basically slapped them in the space and in public and Cameron like Lord Chamberlain from 1940s of
[02:27:56.640 --> 02:28:02.320]  course just appeased appeased the Germans and went back to his people and said well I'm sure
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:08.000]  that they didn't mean it you know so he's being look made look like an idiot and Germany is in
[02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:12.080]  control yeah for those that don't know the cars for those that don't know she told him you will
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:17.040]  not have a referendum in the superhero taking over and I think that answers my own question
[02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:21.920]  they've always planned to implode the whole system and then consolidate it with a new global bank of
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:26.160]  the world new world order but what about Time Magazine Financial Times of London all of them
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:32.640]  admitting that it's a technocratic banker occupation government global government of foreign
[02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:38.160]  by Goldman Sachs there it is max but we don't get a gold star for being right we get ridiculed
[02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:44.400]  yeah right exactly you haven't been absolutely right the these technocrats which is a way to
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:50.880]  code for banker they're not technocrats they're bankers you know Monty in Italy is for you know
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:56.240]  Goldman Sachs through and through same thing in Greece and this unelected bankers are now running
[02:28:56.240 --> 02:29:02.800]  these countries and Goldman and their coup d'etre insiders are now running right all over Europe
[02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:08.960]  and Deutsche Bank and Germany are loving it and they've succeeded in that entire coup d'etat
[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:14.480]  of the region I'm in France France is not quite nervous because their yields on their bonds are
[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:19.600]  now getting at those levels where they start to get very nervous about sovereignty and the
[02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:24.960]  issues of this nature so there's a lot of nervousness here in France and you know credit twist
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:31.680]  of course is absolutely right this thing is going to blow and the euro is going into a
[02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:37.680]  hugely turbulent period now we got to come back after break tell us what's coming next this hugely
[02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:42.960]  unstable point this critical juncture and we'll get into some other key news with Max Kaiser folks

[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:20.960]  the leaders of this the george soros group who tried to co-opt it and then they attack the peaceful
[02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:26.000]  protesters using them as a cutout to that make the people running it look like victims in their
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:32.160]  little october revolution they sit there as we stand up against the police beating them stand

[02:36:41.760 --> 02:36:46.880]  trying to co-opt it but it's failing see and then they lie and say we're attacking people
[02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:52.240]  protesting wall street no we're not we pioneered going after these crooks with max keiser jerry
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:58.400]  solente ron paul i'm talking 17 years i've been covering with george humphrey economist derivatives
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:05.600]  and all this this is unbelievable and it shows they're scared to death they want left and right
[02:37:05.600 --> 02:37:11.200]  divided they want republicans attacking all people that protest wall street they want democrats
[02:37:11.200 --> 02:37:16.080]  attacking the entire tea party the republicans tried to co-opt the tea party they tried to ban

[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:27.200]  together through populism and this is got to be protested folks you've got to to point out this
[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:34.000]  is so authoritarian that this is an open public forum everybody come and then be subtly influenced
[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:39.520]  by us the answer is raise taxes on the middle class to get more bailout money to foreign bankers
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:44.000]  they'll look all these big bankers that have gotten a billion dollar bailouts like warren
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:48.640]  buffett off the taxpayer money he says raise money on the rich but he means somebody making
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:56.640]  125 000 a year max keiser uh this is outrageous information what do you make of this well i think
[02:37:56.640 --> 02:38:02.800]  that um you should go to london and um you should uh step onto the world stage because
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:08.720]  you're sure when i go to london people know alex jones when i did my shows in london i had two
[02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:14.080]  stubby performances at the king sadden camp and people totally know alex jones info warren and
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:20.800]  they know your whole place in the history of this movement or movement plural and uh you know you're
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:26.480]  letting the local you know don't let the turkeys uh get you down you know if you're an eagle i forget
[02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:31.120]  how that thing goes but anyway uh you know you you're letting the little riffraff the local
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:35.600]  riffraff gets you down i'm telling you if you come to london go to london and do uh show at the
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:41.040]  london you have huge crowds the international press they people love you all over europe when i
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:45.120]  was in the middle east and i was in cairo people listen to info wars in cairo they know the show
[02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:51.200]  there you're an international phenomenon and you don't know it because you're in fricking austin
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:55.680]  texas and you know you don't know we haven't seen people on the street no no i think we've met max
[02:38:55.680 --> 02:39:04.640]  specs are very nice this shows that the establishment democrats just like to establish for republicans
[02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:10.480]  that are wedged at the hip as you pointed out in for all the republic they are trying to dominate
[02:39:10.480 --> 02:39:15.200]  and now they're having the police attack occupy wall street because i believe they failed and
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:18.880]  co-opting at what's your take on what's happened with occupy wall street and what you were telling
[02:39:18.880 --> 02:39:24.880]  me privately about wall street's view of those guys well the wall street is really upset that they
[02:39:24.880 --> 02:39:30.720]  are being painted as scum and uh they you know they'd like to think of themselves as you know
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:35.680]  important people doing god's work and the fact that every single day they've got people on the
[02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:40.960]  street throwing you know effectively throwing tomatoes at them it really has got them upset
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:45.840]  and so i think in response they're taking even greater risks they're saying oh yeah you think
[02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:52.320]  we're so bad well you know let's do an mf global let's destroy jeffreys let's take this down let's
[02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:57.600]  take that down so they're becoming very antagonistic they're not just destroying companies to show people
[02:39:57.600 --> 02:40:02.880]  they've got power because they just occupy wall street is insinuating that these guys don't have
[02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:08.080]  all the power that maybe the people have the power so in response they're becoming even more hostile
[02:40:08.080 --> 02:40:14.560]  more belligerent more risk reckless taking bigger risks and this of course puts enormous strain on
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:19.040]  the government because the government has to bail them out because all of their risk taking schemes
[02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:25.200]  and in failure so this is just exacerbating the situation and it's a real war the people on the
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:29.600]  street are really got the attention of the people on wall street no matter how many times they pretend
[02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:34.640]  like they don't care they're really taking this seriously and i hope the people in the occupy
[02:40:34.640 --> 02:40:40.800]  movement understand that they have really drawn the enemy out and there is really a lot of shots
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:45.200]  going back and forth and we see it with the mf global blow up we see it now with jeffreys blowing
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:49.920]  up we see it with the whole wall street blowing up and these firms being taken hostage and shot
[02:40:49.920 --> 02:40:56.960]  and eluded more openly and just you know remember uh during the uh back in the 30s the famous crystal
[02:40:56.960 --> 02:41:01.600]  knocked when the nazis just said the hell with it we're just going to steal all the uh wealth from
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:08.160]  everybody and it lives in the memory of people for for for decades and we've we've achieved
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:12.720]  essentially a crystal knocked on wall street with mf global they're just basically outright
[02:41:12.720 --> 02:41:16.960]  saying and proving to people that they can steal with impunity and if you don't like it they put
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:22.560]  this yellow armband on around your arm and uh identify yourself as a loser and get on a train
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:28.960]  to trip linka because you're you're nobody to us we were just to back you up i've listened to the
[02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:35.280]  mainline neocon talk show host talk with hatred about the occupy wall street and paint them with a
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:39.600]  broad brush there's a bunch of communists when that's a small derivative group being supported
[02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:44.880]  by george soros in there to control the opposition it's all part of the delicate uh chagallion
[02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:51.360]  dialectic but i hear them going there scum beat them torture them taser them they're not allowed
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:57.120]  to protest in america they're horrible they're not free market they're communist okay well how come
[02:41:57.120 --> 02:42:02.960]  then we've gotten 20 plus trillion dollars that we know of given to the banksters of taxpayer money
[02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:08.960]  how come these neocons always defend giving unlimited trillions to the bankers in bailouts
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:14.480]  of my money and your money and and that we have to pay back in taxes and that then devalues it how
[02:42:14.480 --> 02:42:18.880]  about that how is it free market i mean i've actually heard them defend mf global one will
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:23.840]  you shouldn't have invested in that they weren't investing they they had gotten this money it was
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:30.080]  in their accounts their accounts again these so-called fake free marketers it's a bunch of
[02:42:30.080 --> 02:42:35.120]  propaganda they're not free market max can you speak to that well i'll give you a better example
[02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:41.760]  bank of new york just proved exposed by harry macopolis to expose the bernie madeoff scandal
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:47.440]  they are the custodian for trillions of dollars in pension accounts for cops the very cops that
[02:42:47.440 --> 02:42:52.320]  are attacking the protesters on the street have their pensions managed by custodians at bank of
[02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:58.640]  new york they were just caught by stealing three tenths of one percent on every transaction going
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:07.280]  back 30 years it's a multi hundred billion dollar heist bank of new york melan and this has just
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:12.400]  been revealed and it's just they're supposed to be the custodian they're not investors they're not
[02:43:12.400 --> 02:43:16.080]  out there speculating they're supposed to be the custodian they're supposed to have confidence in
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:20.720]  the bank that they can hold a dollar without stealing it from you and now that confidence has
[02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:25.040]  been shattered if you get a brokerage account statement or a money market account statement
[02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:30.480]  or a mutual fund bank statement all the numbers on that statement are false it's a falsified
[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:36.400]  document there's nothing there it's nonsense if more than 10 percent of any of the customers of
[02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:40.640]  any of these institutions went and to get their money on the same day they wouldn't be able to
[02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:45.200]  there's not there it's just not there if you think you've got money in the bank and it says on your
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:50.160]  statement you're an idiot it's not there ask the people at mf global ask the people at these other
[02:43:50.160 --> 02:43:55.360]  brokers for us it's gone okay all the scams that were done with the penny stocks chop chop so the
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:43:59.840]  70s and 80s that i was witness witnessing when i was working on the wall street they're now being
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:03.840]  done by gaughman's back in jp market there's nothing they're no better than the penny stock
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:09.760]  chop shops or whore houses that used to riddle wall street during the 20s and in the 70s and even
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:14.080]  into the 80s now they're back they're stealing with impunity they've got all the politicians
[02:44:14.080 --> 02:44:18.320]  in their pockets if you have money with them forget it it's gone you have no money you're
[02:44:18.320 --> 02:44:24.240]  an idiot is this is this the biggest fraud of all time as william k black the professor who was a
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:29.440]  federal investigator and you know put a bunch of guys in prison in the 80s as you know he says this
[02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:35.440]  is an order of magnitude or more folks that means 10 times bigger uh for folks who haven't
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:40.720]  researched these financial issues so so so how big is it who do you expect to start going down next
[02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:46.000]  because all these pimples are starting to pop out as you just mentioned china is executing
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:51.600]  banksters when they do this here they they they get elected governor here they're worshiped and
[02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:57.920]  called free market for for uh robbing people so what are the next coal source to rise up what's
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:03.200]  the timetable what's the time frame how do they expect to extricate themselves from this start
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:08.800]  world war three in the middle of it well as william black says it's the biggest uh that he's seen
[02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:14.800]  and i defer to him because he's really the the expert in this i know it's huge because of a
[02:45:14.800 --> 02:45:20.800]  very nasty word that came out very early in this the word is co-mingling you know when i was a stock
[02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:26.800]  broker you have to study the securities act of 33 and 34 to get your seven to 37 brokerage license
[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:32.000]  you have to know that very very well and one of the words that you take away is this word co-mingling
[02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:38.000]  it's the idea that your customer account you're trading it as if it's your money and this is the
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:45.440]  cardinal sin it's something that not even you know the most brazen uh larsonistically minded
[02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:51.200]  stockbroker would do and yet now it's commonplace on wall street now this whole idea there's a
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:56.880]  division between the customer money and and the corporation's money or the stockbroker's money
[02:45:56.880 --> 02:46:01.920]  is now gone i never said i do that market with the pensioners money people used to go to jail
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:08.720]  or get executed for that i never thought i'd see that um that it would get so bad that you if the
[02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:13.840]  customer's money is now really uh and and the sad part is that when you open an account with these
[02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:20.080]  folks you sign off on binding arbitration before a panel of the peers of the broker you you take
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:25.360]  away any right to go to a jury of your peers every one who signed a new account form eliminates that
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:30.720]  right and there's less than two percent of the people who file complaints get any money back at
[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:34.800]  all it's a 90 percent rate for when i was working on wall street they said to me when i walked in the
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:42.160]  door we don't care what you do just get us more commissions we got lawyers unless you had at least
[02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:48.400]  one lawsuit pending they said you don't have enough initiative that's the attitude of the criminal
[02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:53.280]  class on wall street and it's gotten a thousand times worse with a much bigger number by the way
[02:46:53.280 --> 02:46:57.520]  you're not joking it is like a thousand times worse and folks they've got the same bulletproof
[02:46:57.520 --> 02:47:02.640]  attitude when it comes to gmo they've got the same bulletproof attitude when it comes to radiation
[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:08.480]  all over the world now from canada to the us to france reactors are just melting down
[02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:15.040]  radiation levels are going way up what what are the governments of france uh hungry canada the
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:19.680]  us do they just say we're gonna raise the level what we say safe you see something changed 20
[02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:23.920]  years ago they said we're gonna let trips use du and they're like but our own manual says it'll
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:29.440]  it'll toxify some basically kill us so we do this they're like we're waving a magic wand i mean
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:34.560]  max i think you're right i think they're actually insane in fact i know the elite is not really
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:40.480]  uncontrolled they're like the uh a guy in in dr strange love riding the the hydrogen bomb down
[02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:45.760]  i mean yeah he's in control because he's holding on to it waving his hat in the air saying yee-haw but
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:50.160]  that's not really in control that's an illusion these people are probably going to destroy the
[02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:56.080]  planet because i've studied elites i've studied corruption and normally elites are in control
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:47:59.280]  they even if they're corrupt they don't want things to get out of control because they know
[02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:05.920]  what happens but throughout history elites three four generations in become megalomaniacs
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:11.120]  like nero the list goes on and on and start taking their bulletproof and that's when everything
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:17.680]  implodes max you think we've reached that point you have people i call them suicide bankers and
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:22.880]  um this is what you're dealing with they there's a famous study or an editorial that was in the
[02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:28.160]  wall street journal a couple years ago lessons from the brain damaged investor and in this
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:33.520]  editorial in the wall street journal they made the point that people would fight brain damage
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:39.920]  made better stock managers stock brokers because they had absolutely no empathy whatsoever they
[02:48:39.920 --> 02:48:45.360]  had no empathy they had no thought in terms of what their actions might do to other people
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:50.720]  so they were starting to recruit people with brain damage with autism with other slight
[02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:55.440]  forms of brain anomalies and this is over the last 10 or 15 years only gotten to the point
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:49:00.400]  where they're hiring people with more exaggerated brain damage because they know that these people
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:06.160]  might be autistic in some strange way that they can perform quantitative analysis and develop
[02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:11.200]  these theories about how to manage money but the fact is that all those theories have resulted in
[02:49:11.200 --> 02:49:15.920]  massive wealth confiscation by these few people and now we're paying all the austerity and the
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:19.040]  truth is they're just they're they're hiring autistic and by the way he's telling you the
[02:49:19.040 --> 02:49:24.480]  truth we have looked it up because it the scam becomes so complicated no one can explain it
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:29.280]  because it can't be explained and then it's done by computer you know 70 of all the trading
[02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:33.520]  activity on the exchange is done by computers it's not even done by humans so they program the
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:38.960]  computer to steal and they uh the computer steals all the money and they say we didn't know the
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:43.840]  computer did it that's right they blame it on the computer basically that is they all algorithmic
[02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:48.320]  trading computer trading high frequency trading which is nothing more than siphoning cash out of the
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:53.440]  market flash crashes which are when the computers go awry you know when i was when they jack it up
[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:58.480]  and down so we're going to break max what's the next cold source to come up what's the time frame
[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:03.520]  now it seems like things are accelerating their dissent yeah we're going to break or what we'll
[02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:09.200]  start going in but we'll let you take us out now i think that the name i'm that's not being bandied
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:14.720]  about is jeffrey's it's been around for a long time it could be another broker to to evaporate
[02:50:14.720 --> 02:50:19.520]  that'll have repercussions and it's another domino in this long list of dominoes and the system's
[02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:25.680]  going down the systemic collapse and people are freaking out and there's more volatility and of
[02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:31.920]  course uh this is only going to bring in more uh central planning central government more techno
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:38.480]  craft banksters and more world government more european wide government less right less civil
[02:50:38.480 --> 02:50:45.280]  right less human right and it's all run by the people that got us into this mess boy that's a
[02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:49.920]  genius situation what did einstein said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing
[02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:54.560]  over and over again thinking you're going to get a different outcome the aristocrats who had to give
[02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:59.440]  up some income after the black plague have always wanted to get back to a point where they didn't

[02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:30.960]  out west and the land being set aside for land use uh by multinational corporations
[02:54:31.760 --> 02:54:35.600]  as collateral just like you're seeing in greece i mean the documents are public the executive

[02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:51.680]  on the back porch of this little uh little motel i'm staying at just just incredible out here i'm
[02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:56.800]  going to go do some more investigative reporting there today but things are moving very very quickly
[02:54:57.760 --> 02:55:04.160]  max what's the time frame here um salete from his analysis thinks they're going to go ahead
[02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:10.400]  start having more implosions after christmas and more stealing of people's money out of accounts
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:15.600]  how do you counter that how do you think the movement to pull money out of the mix six mega
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:22.720]  banks uh is going to affect things uh is that a game changer max keiser you know salete made a
[02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:29.120]  good point after his mf global experience that relating to gld the exchange traders fund sponsored
[02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:35.760]  by hsbc and clearly if there's a need to get your precious metal from them you're going to be getting
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:42.720]  in line behind the bank and behind a bunch of other creditors so it's stupid to have your money in gld
[02:55:42.720 --> 02:55:48.640]  the exchange trade is fun because you're you put it there because you want it as an assurance but
[02:55:48.640 --> 02:55:53.200]  if you need it you've got all these other people ahead of you and you'll never get it you'll get
[02:55:53.200 --> 02:56:00.400]  a receipt for cash which will be worthless so if you have a gld or f lv which is the silver version
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:05.920]  you need to get out of that immediately and own physical and you know i think gerald will probably
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:12.160]  not be you know engaging in anything but pure physical going forward so let's all learn from
[02:56:12.880 --> 02:56:18.880]  what's going on there and not be fooled but just to be clear he was using his own money to then make
[02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:23.760]  big profits in the system and then take gold and they just said you're not getting anything
[02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:30.960]  yeah but as we've been saying for years uh you can't trust these guys and um they're just not
[02:56:30.960 --> 02:56:37.280]  they're not trustworthy but they the regulatory agency the cme group the cftc there are corruptives
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:42.080]  that they is they admit the head of the cftc was involved in it and had to recuse himself so of
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:47.680]  course core design's not going to get in trouble so i mean i'm just saying he really taken the risk
[02:56:47.680 --> 02:56:54.320]  that you you don't need to take it just you know it's it's very tempting of course to uh to do a
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:57:00.320]  transaction like this but what we're learning is that anything if the only money that you keep in a
[02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:06.080]  paper or in a securities account or in a features contract is money you're happy to lose
[02:57:08.320 --> 02:57:12.080]  it's as simple as that and because anything you're not going to keep any the only thing that's
[02:57:12.080 --> 02:57:17.680]  going to keep this going to survive this fire is gold and silver and everything what was announced
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:25.360]  a month ago bank of america has now moved 79 trillion that's trillion with a t ladies and
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:33.200]  gentlemen out of their regular brokerage river accounts into fdic protected and they'll call
[02:57:33.200 --> 02:57:39.760]  that free market after 79 trillion bank to mel to speculate with and to gamble with and to
[02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:45.360]  give themselves huge fees as the coupier and then when the going gets tough they move it back to
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:51.120]  balance sheet of the bank that's fdic back which is ultimately the on the hook of the taxpayer
[02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:56.880]  that's really illegal that's completely illegal it's completely illegal by all the statues that
[02:57:56.880 --> 02:58:02.640]  have been put in place for 60 70 years you know china if that happened in china once again their
[02:58:02.640 --> 02:58:07.600]  solution is to kill the bankers they've done it out twice there was another case just in two in the
[02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:16.080]  last two weeks where they found bankers committing fraud and they killed them now from china why can't
[02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:21.040]  we import this from china now i hear you we need to do it through a jury of peers but
