[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.320]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.320 --> 00:34.200]  Texas Alex Jones well our worst fears are coming true in the season of stage
[00:34.200 --> 00:42.540]  crisis DOJ communist new black Panthers hijacked Ferguson protests the
[00:42.540 --> 00:48.280]  police being heavy-handed up front including with the press only
[00:48.280 --> 00:57.480]  incited and then gave a fake moral high ground to the worst elements of the
[00:57.480 --> 01:04.160]  protesters and now from all over the country not just areas of St. Louis we
[01:04.160 --> 01:12.040]  are seeing very racist race war promoting
[01:12.040 --> 01:22.120]  hoodlum types descending on the city and on the town for a clash with the
[01:22.120 --> 01:28.280]  National Guard and the police which will then undoubtedly cause more looting
[01:28.280 --> 01:34.760]  around the country and then the big issue going into the 2016 elections will
[01:34.760 --> 01:40.280]  be the race war that comes out of this and I've been saying that for a week
[01:40.280 --> 01:48.560]  and a half since all of this started or longer and I've been saying it since
[01:48.560 --> 01:52.600]  Obama opened up the borders in the Southwest to bring in unlimited
[01:52.600 --> 02:01.320]  illegals because I could see what they're doing and now we've got the police
[02:01.320 --> 02:05.680]  out of control as well that will only exacerbate that Ferguson police
[02:05.680 --> 02:13.300]  threatened to shoot a journalist that's up on info wars.com the National
[02:13.300 --> 02:17.360]  Guard of course as of yesterday been ordered onto the streets of Ferguson
[02:17.360 --> 02:21.560]  and surrounding areas by the governor that will start in the next few hours
[02:21.560 --> 02:27.240]  our three reporters we sent after a week of being there totally exhausted and it
[02:27.240 --> 02:31.040]  already had to come back to take care of family and their dogs and cats and
[02:31.040 --> 02:36.840]  things like that but we're going to deploy three reporters back today on an
[02:36.840 --> 02:44.320]  airplane to get there by tonight we're gonna be sending Marcos Morales Joe
[02:44.320 --> 02:49.040]  Biggs wants to go back and of course we're gonna send Kit Daniels there as
[02:49.040 --> 02:55.040]  well so this is all something we'll be covering live here on air plus we have
[02:55.040 --> 02:58.520]  all the live feeds by other journalists that are there to discover what
[02:58.520 --> 03:03.240]  happens but if we just weigh in and take the side of the police or just weigh
[03:03.240 --> 03:09.320]  in and take the side of the protesters we're playing into the globalist plan it
[03:09.320 --> 03:13.640]  was easy back when all this started a few weeks ago on Saturday and Sunday night
[03:13.640 --> 03:19.200]  with the limited looting and some of the thugs coming in from inner-city areas
[03:19.200 --> 03:27.800]  of St. Louis proper to exacerbate the tensions already on the streets with the
[03:27.800 --> 03:32.920]  Michael Brown shooting the autopsies out he was shot at least six times twice in
[03:32.920 --> 03:36.800]  the head and I've read the New York Times and other reports about the
[03:36.800 --> 03:40.760]  autopsy limited parts of it have been released and I can't find out if he was
[03:40.760 --> 03:46.520]  shot in the back or not we're gonna be looking into that we've got the main
[03:46.520 --> 03:51.320]  autopsy up on screen they claim he was not shot in the back but shot in the
[03:51.320 --> 04:01.560]  hand the forearm the bicep the upper arm the neck the eye and grazed over the
[04:01.560 --> 04:04.240]  top of the head
[04:06.160 --> 04:11.200]  so we'll be breaking that down today but guys do me a favor because I've just
[04:11.200 --> 04:17.360]  been going off memory here type just department statistic numbers black on
[04:17.360 --> 04:23.360]  black crime black on white crime usually city by city but it's between 7 to 12
[04:23.360 --> 04:33.000]  14 it varies black on black blacks kill the most blacks I mean statistically it's
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.240]  off the chart but nobody gets upset in Chicago when four or five people get
[04:37.240 --> 04:44.120]  killed today black on black and the whole thing's a tragedy but it it's the
[04:44.120 --> 04:50.960]  type of racial crisis that Obama was built for even telling it for seven
[04:50.960 --> 04:55.120]  years it was coming now mainstream news says get ready for race war that's the

[07:09.320 --> 07:12.760]  been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[07:12.760 --> 07:17.200]  than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using

[08:31.320 --> 08:36.480]  all right here's what I want to do I want to open the phones up for police and
[08:36.480 --> 08:42.360]  military to call into the broadcast today to give their take and their view on
[08:42.360 --> 08:49.320]  the obviously provocateur events by the Justice Department and their operatives
[08:49.320 --> 08:55.560]  like Al Sharpton the Reverend Jesse Jackson and others there on the ground in
[08:55.560 --> 09:01.440]  Ferguson Missouri now we've got that separate from why were the paramilitary
[09:01.440 --> 09:06.640]  police firing rubber bullets tear gas and things at mainline reporters the
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.680]  Washington Post being arrested in a McDonald's our reporters being attacked
[09:11.680 --> 09:16.680]  that's a separate issue but the local police have been given the armored
[09:16.680 --> 09:21.920]  vehicles the militarized training by the feds who then poses the Savior coming
[09:21.920 --> 09:27.320]  into town and now we've seen looting Friday night Saturday night right
[09:27.320 --> 09:33.960]  through last night police reportedly got shot at last night so that's when I
[09:33.960 --> 09:39.120]  told my reporters yesterday I said you come home now you've been there long
[09:39.120 --> 09:44.840]  enough you're exhausted I don't want you getting shot so we're going to send
[09:44.840 --> 09:52.280]  Marcos Morales and Joe Biggs and Kit Daniels back but to stay on the
[09:52.280 --> 09:58.280]  periphery even behind the mainstream media because our guys have done enough to
[09:58.280 --> 10:02.960]  monitor the live feeds to talk to eyewitnesses that come out but we're
[10:02.960 --> 10:06.480]  not going to have our reporters and this is an order because they want to stay
[10:06.480 --> 10:10.360]  and be involved in all of it that's my decision they're not going to be running
[10:10.360 --> 10:15.240]  around with a National Guard and the state police while somebody is shooting
[10:15.240 --> 10:20.840]  at the police I'm not going to have reporters getting shot it is now
[10:20.840 --> 10:26.000]  officially turning into a war zone out there so we're going to keep our
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.720]  reporters on the periphery of this and the police had better not shoot up on
[10:32.720 --> 10:35.720]  rubber bullets or anything else when they're on the periphery I mean imagine
[10:35.720 --> 10:40.280]  Washington Post and the McDonald's they come over and arrest them Washington Post
[10:40.280 --> 10:46.080]  reporter my reporters are with mainline TV and they say turn your cameras off
[10:46.080 --> 10:51.680]  hundreds yards away and open fire on them targeting the media that's never
[10:51.680 --> 10:55.600]  been done in this country before it's outrageous so that's a separate issue as
[10:55.600 --> 11:03.800]  well but the big overarching situation is clearly Obama wants to trigger a crisis
[11:03.800 --> 11:07.880]  and race war in this country just like they've opened the borders up have
[11:07.880 --> 11:13.840]  ignored Congress are legalizing the illegals by fiat bring them in and mash
[11:13.840 --> 11:20.720]  giving them voter ID cards to vote giving them driver's license this is
[11:20.720 --> 11:29.600]  getting serious most the people in Ferguson do not like Al Sharpton or
[11:29.600 --> 11:33.880]  Jesse Jackson they've been booing them to us Jesse Jackson got booed on camera
[11:33.880 --> 11:40.080]  yesterday when he passed around a collection plate this is a guy worth
[11:40.080 --> 11:44.000]  tens of millions of dollars imagine you're in the middle of a war zone and
[11:44.000 --> 11:50.720]  you're passing out a collection plate so understand most of the people that are
[11:50.720 --> 11:54.960]  out there and that have been out there have wanted an investigation of the
[11:54.960 --> 12:01.440]  killing of Michael Brown and the and the autopsy is now out he was not shot in
[12:01.440 --> 12:05.280]  the back according to what I read here and look at he was shot in the front so
[12:05.280 --> 12:09.480]  that part of the witness's story isn't true if you believe the autopsy the
[12:09.480 --> 12:13.280]  Justice Department is doing another autopsy the family wants to have an
[12:13.280 --> 12:18.040]  autopsy done but the point is we have all these world events going on
[12:18.040 --> 12:22.600]  supposed Russian convoys being blown up that Russia now says is an operation
[12:22.600 --> 12:27.840]  Gliwitz Hitler staged that against Poland to start World War two and the
[12:27.840 --> 12:31.560]  Russians are using terms like false flag Gliwitz and there's no video the
[12:31.560 --> 12:35.520]  blown-up convoy no evidence they're trying to use the down to airliner that
[12:35.520 --> 12:39.280]  a lot of evidence points towards Ukraine shooting down now you know month into
[12:39.280 --> 12:44.040]  this they're trying to turn ISIS loose all over the world while claiming they're
[12:44.040 --> 12:48.720]  bombing them to challenge them you've got battles in in in in Kurdish held areas
[12:48.720 --> 12:53.880]  over dams today over one of the most dangerous dam complexes in the world
[12:53.880 --> 12:58.280]  that could flood Baghdad you've got a battle with basically al-Qaeda in Iraq
[12:58.280 --> 13:03.640]  new name ISIS going on you've got the dollar being devalued quickly you've
[13:03.640 --> 13:09.400]  got the depression spreading across the country and even Time magazine and the
[13:09.400 --> 13:14.800]  Associated Press and others admit that there's a depression in the suburbs now
[13:14.800 --> 13:21.400]  and that depression is spreading to the suburbs and that that's why you're
[13:21.400 --> 13:26.360]  seeing increases of crime you're seeing increases in violence you're seeing
[13:26.360 --> 13:30.520]  increases in racial attacks on whites
[13:33.960 --> 13:38.280]  you're seeing the knockout game increase and when an old white man gets
[13:38.280 --> 13:42.760]  knocked out and hits his head and dies white people don't go out and burn
[13:42.760 --> 13:47.720]  things down and riot so we need to say this racially based the white man did
[13:47.720 --> 14:01.840]  it idea by some of the black leaders is only stoking the flames
[14:07.720 --> 14:11.640]  we have a video of Dick Gregory that will queue up later in play that jacari
[14:11.640 --> 14:15.320]  Jackson got interview with him on Friday we didn't get around to airing it
[14:15.320 --> 14:20.640]  stop on info wars.com and Dick Gregory's been on the show he knows I care about
[14:20.640 --> 14:24.760]  everybody and try to promote freedom but jacari Jackson walks over and says you
[14:24.760 --> 14:30.360]  know the police have been firing rubber bullets at everybody that's really wrong
[14:30.360 --> 14:34.960]  what's your take on them targeting the press and Gregory goes hey why is info
[14:34.960 --> 14:42.360]  wars covering up always covering up they're not attacking people they're
[14:42.360 --> 14:47.880]  attacking black people and the only reason the media is now here is because
[14:47.880 --> 14:55.400]  some white reporters got arrested well that's not really true I mean I want to
[14:55.400 --> 15:00.960]  get Dick Gregory on all the blame about it there are shooting at black
[15:00.960 --> 15:06.200]  reporters white reporters Joe Biggs is as white as the driven snow blonde hair
[15:06.200 --> 15:10.320]  walking around they're targeting him shooting on rubber bullets flash bangs
[15:10.320 --> 15:13.920]  everything they're targeting jacari they're targeting the Washington Post
[15:13.920 --> 15:19.880]  reporters vice reporters they're targeting everybody and so when jacari
[15:19.880 --> 15:25.280]  says it's terrible why do you think they're shooting at everybody and he
[15:25.280 --> 15:31.160]  goes they're shooting at black people so he wanted jacari to say it was all
[15:31.160 --> 15:38.320]  racially based and there's undoubtedly a big element of that going on but it's
[15:38.320 --> 15:41.960]  just such a level that hey jacari you need to say it's an attack on black
[15:41.960 --> 15:51.200]  people well Karim Abdul Jabbar has come out in Time Magazine and said that it's
[15:51.200 --> 15:55.640]  basically economically based and I agree with Dick Gregory partially it's racially
[15:55.640 --> 16:00.680]  based but I agree with Karim Abdul Jabbar that it's actually economically
[16:00.680 --> 16:07.200]  based and it's the whole rap culture and MTV culture does shell it all as an
[16:07.200 --> 16:12.920]  anti-cop anti-white type mindset which then makes whites become racist and see
[16:12.920 --> 16:16.680]  it as racially based and makes the police see black people period as their
[16:16.680 --> 16:23.760]  enemy and that's the overarching issue is that this is being engineered as a
[16:23.760 --> 16:29.280]  clash which at the end of the day will be a big police state used on everybody
[16:29.280 --> 16:33.160]  is the point I'm trying to get at but here's the article the coming race war
[16:33.160 --> 16:38.440]  won't be about race Ferguson is not about systematic racism it's about class
[16:38.440 --> 16:48.080]  warfare and how American poor are held back says Karim Abdul Jabbar will the
[16:48.080 --> 16:51.240]  recent rioting in Ferguson Missouri be the tipping point in the struggle against
[16:51.240 --> 16:56.600]  racial injustice or will it be a major footnote in some future grad students
[16:56.600 --> 17:01.040]  thesis of civil unrest in the early 21st century the answer could be found in
[17:01.040 --> 17:07.280]  1970 May Kent State shootings May 4 1970 the Ohio National Guard opened fire on
[17:07.280 --> 17:10.840]  student protesters at Kent State University hearing those 13 seconds of
[17:10.840 --> 17:15.080]  gunfire four students were killed nine were wounded of whom was permanently
[17:15.080 --> 17:20.880]  paralyzed the shock outcry resulted in the nationwide strike of four million
[17:20.880 --> 17:25.760]  students and close more than 450 campuses five days after the shooting a
[17:25.760 --> 17:30.680]  hundred thousand protesters gathered in Washington DC and the nation's youth were
[17:30.680 --> 17:35.840]  energetically mobilized to end the Vietnam War racism sexism mindless faith
[17:35.840 --> 17:42.320]  in the political establishment and then it goes on to say you probably haven't
[17:42.320 --> 17:47.240]  heard of the Jackson State shootings 10 days after Kent State ignited the nation
[17:47.240 --> 17:50.480]  and the predominantly black Jackson State University Mississippi police killed
[17:50.480 --> 17:55.200]  two black students one a high school senior and the other a father of an 18
[17:55.200 --> 18:03.440]  month old baby and then it goes on you can see the whole thing set up to start
[18:03.440 --> 18:07.040]  the Civil War I didn't start saying a couple weeks ago when this Ferguson
[18:07.040 --> 18:11.520]  thing started the Civil War was coming I said it five years ago four years ago
[18:11.520 --> 18:16.400]  three years ago two years ago a year ago six months ago a month ago and as of a
[18:16.400 --> 18:22.160]  month ago I was saying it every hour on the hour
[18:22.280 --> 18:28.200]  warning everyone see if people could just turn off their emotions and pull
[18:28.200 --> 18:33.720]  back whether you're black white it doesn't matter and be smart enough
[18:33.720 --> 18:39.560]  savvy enough to see the big picture we could stop all this what do you think
[18:39.560 --> 18:43.880]  bringing in tens of millions of illegals and giving them voter ID cards is for
[18:43.880 --> 18:49.600]  what do you think Obama putting our military under NATO command is for what

[23:58.280 --> 24:22.640]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central we're here live ladies and
[24:22.640 --> 24:33.440]  gentlemen Dave Mustaine. The globalists are robbing the country's pension funds
[24:33.440 --> 24:38.520]  they're devaluing the dollar right now they are putting in policies to shut
[24:38.520 --> 24:43.360]  down our factories and industry to shut down our energy sectors to bring in
[24:43.360 --> 24:48.920]  global regulations over every town and city via agenda 21 our borders are wide
[24:48.920 --> 24:53.680]  open the presidency for all intents and purposes has become a dictatorial
[24:53.680 --> 24:59.320]  office doesn't mean Obama won't leave it means Obama is a dictator and that's
[24:59.320 --> 25:05.360]  even being said in Congress so if your globalist sitting in Switzerland or
[25:05.360 --> 25:10.680]  sitting in Luxembourg or sitting in Grand Cayman or sitting in Paris or
[25:10.680 --> 25:16.360]  London how do you take down a region like Ukraine you get the Western and
[25:16.360 --> 25:20.640]  Eastern Ukrainians fighting with each other both sides have beefs both sides
[25:20.640 --> 25:24.640]  have histories with each other both sides think they're right both sides
[25:24.640 --> 25:30.640]  have good points can you pull back and see how the globalists want to suck
[25:30.640 --> 25:34.920]  Ukraine dry like they've done scores of other European countries in the last
[25:34.920 --> 25:40.640]  decade same thing here ISIS has been funded and turned loose by our
[25:40.640 --> 25:45.760]  government by NATO who now is fighting them people go well that how do they
[25:45.760 --> 25:49.400]  control them they don't they turn them loose they fund them then when they get
[25:49.400 --> 25:54.560]  out of the lines when they don't paint in the by the numbers and they go into
[25:54.560 --> 25:57.800]  the Kurdish area they bomb it
[25:58.680 --> 26:02.880]  it's the same thing here do you got thugs coming out of St. Louis for two
[26:02.880 --> 26:07.360]  weeks organizing this using any event they can to go loot massive looting
[26:07.360 --> 26:10.880]  compared to what happened a week and a half ago now taking place in surrounding
[26:10.880 --> 26:16.520]  areas of Ferguson National Guard being called in the National Guard is just
[26:16.520 --> 26:20.280]  regular folks black white you name it Hispanic Americans that just love their
[26:20.280 --> 26:23.600]  family on average some of the best people out there believe me I know
[26:23.600 --> 26:28.440]  veterans I know National Guard they're the most awake most informed best people
[26:28.440 --> 26:31.520]  we've got and they're now going to have bottles getting thrown out of mall off
[26:31.520 --> 26:36.400]  cocktails they're going to be getting shot at ladies and gentlemen black white
[26:36.400 --> 26:40.120]  it doesn't matter and they're going to start shooting people with rubber
[26:40.120 --> 26:44.040]  bullets and beating them and then it's going to be see what the racists are
[26:44.040 --> 26:50.680]  doing but at the same time why did the police shoot at reporters at the same
[26:50.680 --> 26:57.360]  time why did the feds send known provocateurs from the DOJ in to stir all
[26:57.360 --> 27:00.840]  this up and I've talked to lawyers in Kansas City I know I've talked to state
[27:00.840 --> 27:06.840]  police in Kansas City I know and in St. Louis but I first talked to folks in
[27:06.840 --> 27:09.720]  Kansas City and they've one of them formerly lived in St. Louis and knows
[27:09.720 --> 27:13.720]  the inside baseball and they told me and then I talked to another lawyer I know
[27:13.720 --> 27:19.560]  who lives in St. Louis and is connected to the police and he said they've known
[27:19.560 --> 27:24.640]  from day one this is just going to continue to get worse and they wanted
[27:24.640 --> 27:28.440]  to crush it up front hoping they could just get people off the streets well I
[27:28.440 --> 27:32.240]  don't know what psychology they're following because I can tell you gut
[27:32.240 --> 27:37.520]  level it's only going to make things worse and it's now spreading in different
[27:37.520 --> 27:42.520]  parts of the country in Florida and New York and California this is the excuse
[27:42.520 --> 27:47.760]  people need who are racist to go out and pull over a truck being driven by a white
[27:47.760 --> 27:53.200]  guy Reginald Denny and bash his whole face in and to burn down people's stores
[27:53.200 --> 27:57.800]  and to attack it is a criminal element that is going to use this and the higher
[27:57.800 --> 28:02.600]  level criminal element is going to play people off against each other here are
[28:02.600 --> 28:07.720]  some of the headlines this is the next level I was saying three weeks ago
[28:07.720 --> 28:12.680]  what's the next big crisis the open borders funding al-Qaeda trying to start
[28:12.680 --> 28:19.240]  a war with Russia devaluing the dollar all these other scans and I said I
[28:19.240 --> 28:23.160]  believe it's going to be race war in this country over and over again I said
[28:23.160 --> 28:30.160]  that you were witnesses to it because I know how the globalist operate 1520
[28:30.160 --> 28:33.840]  blacks dying a week in Chicago getting shot black-on-black you don't hear a
[28:33.840 --> 28:39.400]  word about it whether the cop was wrong or in the right it's a tragedy either
[28:39.400 --> 28:45.160]  way why is it now time to come out and riot why is it now time to come out and
[28:45.160 --> 28:50.600]  burn things down and why is it time for the police to act like thugs and shove
[28:50.600 --> 28:55.960]  my reporters around and shoot at them while laughing it is the degeneration of
[28:55.960 --> 29:02.680]  society and its animal mentality its its its mob mentality by the police and by
[29:02.680 --> 29:06.880]  the other side as well and you've got all the military equipment all the
[29:06.880 --> 29:11.620]  checkpoints and all of it ready rolling out and this is segueing the police
[29:11.620 --> 29:15.720]  state from the drug war and the phony war against al-Qaeda now they'll shell
[29:15.720 --> 29:20.800]  it in a race war with black people hispanics will join in because they'll
[29:20.800 --> 29:26.080]  get their orders of the different just department groups the illegal aliens and
[29:26.080 --> 29:30.560]  then it'll set the precedent for martial law on the streets and then after
[29:30.560 --> 29:36.840]  that is set homeland security will be turned against its real enemy the tea
[29:36.840 --> 29:40.360]  party gun owners the war on white people that congressmen have talked about
[29:40.360 --> 29:44.920]  that is being sold that's the main behind the scenes training is that then
[29:44.920 --> 29:48.640]  flip it around against whites stage terror attacks and claim whites did
[29:48.640 --> 29:52.320]  wear on the march the empires I just laid out their plan

[33:18.760 --> 33:27.640]  how do you bring a republic down it's been so wealthy and has the largest
[33:27.640 --> 33:32.840]  military in the world you do it by deception you do it by sub-refuge by
[33:32.840 --> 33:42.840]  manipulation by Balkanization and that's now happened here all quote sides have
[33:42.840 --> 33:49.720]  legitimate beefs with each other but I have the FBI crime statistics right
[33:49.720 --> 33:56.360]  here from the Justice Department crime in the United States 2012 that's the
[33:56.360 --> 34:09.840]  latest year to be out and it goes over the black on white crime numbers here
[34:09.840 --> 34:16.280]  versus black on black and you can see those numbers for yourself if you're a
[34:16.280 --> 34:33.520]  TV viewer but for every 193 black people that are killed by a white person
[34:33.520 --> 34:43.280]  2,412 are killed by a black person again for every 193 blacks killed by a white
[34:43.280 --> 34:51.280]  2,412 were killed by a black and you can go through these race by race you want
[34:51.280 --> 34:55.680]  us to show you the black on white numbers
[34:55.680 --> 35:05.240]  depending on how you slice it it is orders of magnitude higher black on
[35:05.240 --> 35:13.000]  white and that's because it is promoted by the Democratic Party and by the new
[35:13.000 --> 35:18.480]  black Panther Party and others publicly the black Panther Party new black
[35:18.480 --> 35:21.880]  Panther Party leader in Houston is famously in the paper we've had him on
[35:21.880 --> 35:30.880]  the show saying don't go rob and loot or mug in black areas go to white areas and
[35:30.880 --> 35:35.960]  do it to them that's a legitimate form of protest you know it's funny then I had
[35:35.960 --> 35:40.000]  that same person thank me when the CPS is trying to take a black man's and a
[35:40.000 --> 35:45.000]  black lady's four children because he basically lives in a unaired conditioned
[35:45.000 --> 35:54.240]  little woodhouse one part of it then he did get in air conditioning and he was
[35:54.240 --> 35:58.320]  a good father and a good mother and the guy mowed yards and worked hard and a
[35:58.320 --> 36:03.560]  lot of people got raised like that just 50 60 years ago is it illegal to be
[36:03.560 --> 36:08.440]  poor I came to that fellow's aid and the black community was like why are you
[36:08.440 --> 36:13.960]  helping us we can't believe it look I care about everybody when the state
[36:13.960 --> 36:22.360]  comes after you and oppresses you hey that can happen to me as well and the
[36:22.360 --> 36:27.100]  blacks get profiled to blacks basically get put into the system easier than
[36:27.100 --> 36:31.640]  whites or others undoubtedly I don't like the fact that the illegal aliens can
[36:31.640 --> 36:37.280]  drink and drive and get bank accounts without IDs and fly without IDs I don't
[36:37.280 --> 36:41.560]  dislike Hispanics most Hispanics don't get to do that of their citizens I'm
[36:41.560 --> 36:45.680]  upset that the system can pick and choose who they want to go after but
[36:45.680 --> 36:50.920]  regardless there is a major racism movement in the black community against
[36:50.920 --> 36:55.680]  white people and others and you've got black entertainment television and you've
[36:55.680 --> 37:01.760]  got movies like Django Unchained and you have got it being sold in the media as
[37:01.760 --> 37:09.320]  kosher as cute to be anti-white just like it's sold with La Raza the race at
[37:09.320 --> 37:14.840]  Hispanics in a racial group how does the government segregate prisons black
[37:14.840 --> 37:21.200]  white Hispanic and if it's in an area like San Francisco black white Hispanic
[37:21.200 --> 37:27.880]  Asian and everybody gets put into a gang and you've got to join a gang when you
[37:27.880 --> 37:32.360]  go to prison if you don't want to get shanked if you don't want to get raped if
[37:32.360 --> 37:35.160]  you don't want to get robbed if you don't want to get stabbed if you don't
[37:35.160 --> 37:39.440]  want to get beat up and they're doing that to all of America trying to force
[37:39.440 --> 37:44.840]  us into a gang right now and I've actually had people on the street come up
[37:44.840 --> 37:47.840]  to me this weekend because I was downtown a lot I went to the citywide
[37:47.840 --> 37:53.840]  garage sale to try to find some cheap art to hang on the walls and I had
[37:53.840 --> 38:02.480]  multiple people come up to me black and white and say we really like your show
[38:02.480 --> 38:07.960]  but it's I think it's time for you to choose a side that black folks tell me
[38:07.960 --> 38:11.000]  I like your show but let's do it for years but you know you need to decide
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.200]  which side you're gonna be on and then separately hours later I had white
[38:15.200 --> 38:19.200]  people say hey I'm not racist but I'm sick of people attacking me because I'm
[38:19.200 --> 38:22.800]  white and you know the police are doing what they need to these are bunch of
[38:22.800 --> 38:26.920]  racist thugs Alex and you know why are you all over the map I'm trying to stop
[38:26.920 --> 38:30.840]  this from happening I don't want to be forced into a group I want to be part of
[38:30.840 --> 38:35.960]  a group that promotes liberty private property freedom and prosperity I want
[38:35.960 --> 38:40.480]  to stop abortion a 52% of black people I don't like the fact that 26% of white
[38:40.480 --> 38:44.880]  people aren't even born I don't want to abort Hispanic babies black babies or
[38:44.880 --> 38:48.800]  white babies because they're all babies I have empathy for a black baby just like
[38:48.800 --> 38:54.760]  I have it for a white baby but I tell you I get upset whenever I see people I
[38:54.760 --> 39:00.480]  know they're in Ferguson black leaders coming over to the camera and saying why
[39:00.480 --> 39:06.600]  aren't you saying it's black people being attacked in fall wars because it's
[39:06.600 --> 39:10.720]  all of our rights being attacked when the cops fire at reporters who aren't
[39:10.720 --> 39:14.720]  doing anything wrong and arrest Washington Post reporters who are in
[39:14.720 --> 39:19.400]  McDonald's they are attacking their own future their own safety net we're all in
[39:19.400 --> 39:24.120]  this together I realize the globalist are on the outside manipulating this
[39:24.120 --> 39:31.640]  entire thing playing us like we're fools and the Justice Department the proof
[39:31.640 --> 39:36.080]  is up on info wars.com people need to put this out on Facebook Twitter
[39:36.080 --> 39:42.960]  everywhere nation of Islam and new black Panthers directing violent protest in
[39:42.960 --> 39:57.960]  Ferguson again I've had Lewis Farrakhan plug me on air and say Alex Jones
[39:57.960 --> 40:02.280]  warned the government you try to confiscate our guns it's gonna cause a
[40:02.280 --> 40:06.440]  civil war and he agreed we don't need that but then separately and I don't
[40:06.440 --> 40:11.080]  expect Lewis Farrakhan runs his whole organization is believe me I can't I got
[40:11.080 --> 40:15.400]  great reporters and I can't control what they do it's just part of free will but
[40:15.400 --> 40:19.280]  he needs to call for calm because we've got proof in this article that the
[40:19.280 --> 40:25.360]  nation of Islam is in there stirring up violence at least the leaders there
[40:27.600 --> 40:35.360]  DOJ communist new black Panthers hijacked Ferguson protest and again I've
[40:35.360 --> 40:38.680]  drawn my line in the sand they're gonna use the civil unrest and what's
[40:38.680 --> 40:43.760]  happening the pull to try to bring in martial law nationwide as I've been
[40:43.760 --> 40:47.760]  saying and they're already dubbing this in the AP you name it as a coming race
[40:47.760 --> 40:53.440]  war and you're gonna have a whole new age of political correctness to prove
[40:53.440 --> 40:59.000]  that whites aren't racist you've got to do a B and C and we need more government
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.080]  funding the inter cities and more blah blah which won't help the people in the
[41:03.080 --> 41:11.480]  inner cities government help from LBJ the Klan member on record is what did this
[41:11.480 --> 41:16.280]  to the greatest extent to the black community the black community was 150
[41:16.280 --> 41:21.280]  degrees different they weren't perfect so they weren't a 180 that's how they were
[41:21.280 --> 41:27.480]  150 degrees different in many metrics and studies lower crime rates than black
[41:27.480 --> 41:34.240]  neighbor than the white neighborhoods in the 50s total difference today highest
[41:34.240 --> 41:39.600]  crime rate undoubtedly black neighborhoods period killing each other and
[41:39.600 --> 41:43.720]  the government ship drugs into those areas and did all sorts of psyops so
[41:43.720 --> 41:49.200]  that's my point it's still a real threat this racism that's been simmering and
[41:49.200 --> 41:53.680]  breeding in the in these black areas is real but nevertheless it's been
[41:53.680 --> 41:59.040]  manipulated and so I'm trying to go all the way over the top here and just get
[41:59.040 --> 42:03.600]  people to pull outside the paradigm see the system from outside the box and
[42:03.600 --> 42:08.000]  stop it I want to give out the toll free number we've already heard from much of
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.840]  Ferguson residents we've heard from my reporters we've heard from other
[42:11.840 --> 42:16.360]  reporters we've heard from geopolitical analysts and cultural analysts on this I
[42:16.360 --> 42:21.640]  want to hear from police and military National Guard regular army did we or did
[42:21.640 --> 42:26.560]  we not write articles on July 17th weeks before this started saying prepare for
[42:26.560 --> 42:30.520]  race war and a stage race war in fact if you want to find where I said it go back
[42:30.520 --> 42:37.840]  to July 17th in the first hour because I did this video report and I got Watson
[42:37.840 --> 42:41.520]  to write the article and I'm not bragging but my name should be on that
[42:41.520 --> 42:46.680]  article because I was so concerned about this that I worked with Paul to write
[42:46.680 --> 42:51.440]  that article I shot the video report I broke it all down had my reporters
[42:51.440 --> 42:56.640]  covered it I said the next shoe to drop is black on white stage race war run by
[42:56.640 --> 43:00.680]  the Justice Department and I said at the start of the shower I said I don't
[43:00.680 --> 43:04.000]  remember when I said it but look it up folks and you'll find it and my
[43:04.000 --> 43:12.040]  reporters searched race war Alex Jones and they found the YouTube and the
[43:12.040 --> 43:18.880]  info wars com article where I said it all army trains to combat black
[43:18.880 --> 43:24.720]  Americans 82,000 views it needs 50 million if we're gonna stop this fact
[43:24.720 --> 43:28.160]  that two o'clock today I want to shoot another report with my predictions out
[43:28.160 --> 43:34.720]  of this for the nightly news tonight a warning to stop the race war and quite
[43:34.720 --> 43:41.080]  frankly that's what this is right now but they are preparing 24-7 for this
[43:41.080 --> 43:46.160]  because through MTV through the social engineering through the Django
[43:46.160 --> 43:49.880]  Unchained I know for a fact Quentin Tarantino works with the Justice
[43:49.880 --> 43:55.160]  Department and that he and Robert Rodriguez meet with them and brag that
[43:55.160 --> 44:00.760]  they're set to get the numbers very 30 million a project from the government
[44:00.760 --> 44:07.560]  and that's why Rodriguez met secretly with Obama and that's why Rodriguez is
[44:07.560 --> 44:11.520]  is absolutely out to get me basically is what I've been told by high-level people
[44:11.520 --> 44:15.080]  from every angle of the Hollywood community here in Austin because he is
[44:15.080 --> 44:20.840]  Obama and Quentin Tarantino I've run into him and he looks at me I run to
[44:20.840 --> 44:26.360]  Tarantino not once but twice and he literally begins just shaking when he
[44:26.360 --> 44:29.320]  sees me and I go the other direction because there's no point because
[44:29.320 --> 44:35.960]  imagine their power trip being part of the government machete go around kill
[44:35.960 --> 44:39.240]  all the white people white people are shooting the pregnant Hispanic women
[44:39.240 --> 44:44.920]  know the Planned Parenthood's doing that shooting them with a scalpel right in the
[44:44.920 --> 44:52.920]  uterus why was the paramilitary police aiming guns at Josh Owens a guy with a
[44:52.920 --> 45:01.320]  professional camera see it's all bad it's all set up for us all to collide
[45:01.320 --> 45:07.640]  with each other in a race war it's all a joke are we that big of suckers I'm gonna
[45:07.640 --> 45:15.280]  tell you again state funding is on record I got it pulled you you got it
[45:15.280 --> 45:21.080]  pulled for these race war films being put up about Rodriguez and they've got
[45:21.080 --> 45:25.960]  just department money at least Rodriguez brags at parties and media events
[45:25.960 --> 45:31.960]  that he's getting money from Obama that I've got the witnesses of don't forget I
[45:31.960 --> 45:36.120]  got the script four months before machete came out and he said it wasn't a
[45:36.120 --> 45:40.560]  real script turned out it was the official final script
[45:43.440 --> 45:48.480]  I'm gonna say that again the government is running these movies and TV shows you
[45:48.480 --> 45:56.200]  can turn on any TV show out there any TV show out there drama sitcom the
[45:56.200 --> 45:59.120]  patriots are terrorists I'm gonna explain how this works again I'm going to
[45:59.120 --> 46:01.800]  your phone calls toll free number to join us I should give the number out for
[46:01.800 --> 46:12.480]  police and military it's 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 did I not over and over
[46:12.480 --> 46:18.520]  again tell you exactly what would happen I study this 24-7 I have nightmares
[46:18.520 --> 46:21.760]  about this stuff I had dreams all night about this stuff where I was trying to
[46:21.760 --> 46:29.520]  work this out in my head how to stop it and I explained this if they turn loose
[46:29.520 --> 46:34.600]  the inner city folks and the illegals to burn down the country I will be
[46:34.600 --> 46:38.560]  cheering the military when they put them down and I've said this hundreds of
[46:38.560 --> 46:42.920]  times not because I wanted it to happen but because the flames will be coming my
[46:42.920 --> 46:50.320]  direction and then we'll be sold on the tyranny and then Americans that actually
[46:50.320 --> 46:54.400]  work and want to have a future will have to leave the nation or join with the
[46:54.400 --> 47:00.560]  New World Order see the Democrats have tried to arrest me set me up dirty
[47:00.560 --> 47:03.520]  tricks just like they're doing to Rick Perry the Republicans never did that to
[47:03.520 --> 47:12.120]  me they forced me to basically tentatively still say everything I
[47:12.120 --> 47:15.760]  believe and stand up against the Republicans when they're being bad but
[47:15.760 --> 47:19.360]  they said no you promote guns and anti-abortion you're a Republican you're
[47:19.360 --> 47:26.480]  with them and we're going to get you if we can see see they fall in the New
[47:26.480 --> 47:32.280]  World Order forces you to choose a side when I want to build up these
[47:32.280 --> 47:36.280]  communities I want them to have freedom but you've got to be savvy enough to
[47:36.280 --> 47:40.280]  understand the mind control to be able to stop it and I don't know quite
[47:40.280 --> 47:44.240]  frankly at this point how we stop it because there's too many Django on
[47:44.240 --> 47:48.480]  chains there's too many Jamie Foxx's that are going to push race war there's too
[47:48.480 --> 47:52.360]  many Al Sharptons and they're all on the government payroll and quite frankly
[47:52.360 --> 47:56.960]  I've tried as hard as I can and then so many black folks I see that are racist
[47:56.960 --> 48:00.560]  online are like yeah we're gonna kill you crackers you're all scared you gotta
[48:00.560 --> 48:04.600]  be kidding the do you know how war like the whole European culture has been
[48:04.600 --> 48:10.840]  forever and how many weapons and guns and bunkers are ready right now I mean
[48:10.840 --> 48:15.520]  it's a total joke nobody's coming to my office nobody's coming to my house
[48:15.520 --> 48:24.720]  nobody I mean give me a break I don't have some thrill wanting to have a race
[48:24.720 --> 48:28.480]  war with a bunch of black people I don't have some thrill wanting to have a race
[48:28.480 --> 48:33.280]  war with anybody I don't want to have a war with the cops I've said that 50,000
[48:33.280 --> 48:39.000]  times what is MSNBC say every time a cop gets killed that I'm behind it and I
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.080]  want it because they know full well I'm not like Al Sharpton and the rest of
[48:43.080 --> 48:47.360]  these Justice Department people I'm trying to stop it and the proof's up on
[48:47.360 --> 48:53.520]  info wars.com we got Ron in New York as a police officer Raul whose Navy Wolverine
[48:53.520 --> 48:59.000]  whose National Guard I want to hear from state police in Missouri I want to hear

[49:04.400 --> 49:11.040]  calls but here's some good news police tell Detroiters to buy guns in city torn
[49:11.040 --> 49:17.080]  apart by race issues and crime that's the kind of police chief we need and now
[49:17.080 --> 49:23.200]  citizens are marching in Detroit openly with their M16s by the way it's a black
[49:23.200 --> 49:28.680]  police chief see that's what you need is leaders that say we're all gonna stand
[49:28.680 --> 49:34.120]  up you see anybody looting the business you call the police or if they get near
[49:34.120 --> 49:39.160]  you have a gun you take them out see in Detroit they got scores people get shot
[49:39.160 --> 49:43.720]  every week who are robbing and raping suddenly the crime rates starting to go
[49:43.720 --> 49:49.840]  down there's so many thugs have been shot the answer is to say hey you want to
[49:49.840 --> 49:52.800]  protest you protest you go out and try to loot a shop or whatever you're gonna
[49:52.800 --> 49:58.480]  get shot it'll stop real quick but see that's not been done they've attacked
[49:58.480 --> 50:02.800]  the reporters instead they allowed looting to go on that's now been confirmed

[55:48.520 --> 55:52.400]  have reporters there what happens if people get shot even if they're the
[55:52.400 --> 55:57.760]  cops are getting shot at they shoot back the controlled media will shell it like
[55:57.760 --> 56:02.480]  riots are needed and then it's racially based and then riots will pop up
[56:02.480 --> 56:07.400]  everywhere and anyone defending themselves will be called racist and then
[56:07.400 --> 56:11.240]  you see what all the armored vehicles are for this is Obama's crisis I
[56:11.240 --> 56:15.320]  predicted it there'll be even other crisis this is how they try to bring in a
[56:15.320 --> 56:19.400]  permanent state of emergency Ron in New York what's your take on this as a
[56:19.400 --> 56:25.560]  police officer are you doing Alex good afternoon I'm retired a detective I'm
[56:25.560 --> 56:31.040]  just one I'll let you know by them not coming to a conclusion with their case
[56:31.040 --> 56:35.800]  they're inflaming things even more and more I'm sure the investigation process
[56:35.800 --> 56:39.200]  was done and they need to just bring it on the forefront they bring it on the
[56:39.200 --> 56:42.960]  forefront and all this stuff is going to stop you know like I said it's like a
[56:42.960 --> 56:47.080]  ticking bomb time bomb waiting to explode they just need to say you know
[56:47.080 --> 56:51.560]  what went down between the police officer and Mike Brown and then this will
[56:51.560 --> 56:57.440]  all be over as far as like you know my opinion I agree that would help and I
[56:57.440 --> 57:01.280]  respect that of you because you you've obviously lived through it but overall how
[57:01.280 --> 57:04.840]  bad do you think it'll get if people get shot let's say if you know 10
[57:04.840 --> 57:09.800]  protesters get shot three or four of them die it's gonna get ugly it's gonna
[57:09.800 --> 57:12.680]  get ugly you know in this country you know and like I said that's the last
[57:12.680 --> 57:16.800]  thing you know we want to see is you know race war you know I happen to be on
[57:16.800 --> 57:21.520]  you know I'm African-American male like I said you know I'm like the 20 years in
[57:21.520 --> 57:25.280]  the police force like I said this is just you know a time bomb you know waiting
[57:25.280 --> 57:30.120]  to explode and also another thing is like one big thing that I had with the
[57:30.120 --> 57:34.000]  Ferguson police that chief did on Friday was with you know releasing their
[57:34.000 --> 57:37.680]  videotape with Mike Brown you know like you said you know as he stated it had
[57:37.680 --> 57:41.600]  nothing to do with you know with him being shot and I think that even inflamed
[57:41.600 --> 57:47.000]  things even more you know but that's sure I mean it's an attempt to demonize
[57:47.000 --> 57:51.800]  Brown but you can also see the perspective is say look he's dangerous
[57:51.800 --> 57:56.120]  he's roughing people up this fits into the officer story that indeed this
[57:56.120 --> 58:00.280]  happened then that goes to the issue just like the former police officer I
[58:00.280 --> 58:03.560]  hadn't here last week constitutional lawyer why aren't all the police wearing
[58:03.560 --> 58:09.800]  cameras you're right I agree with you you know police officers should be you
[58:09.800 --> 58:13.680]  know wearing cameras because you know some of them do lie you know I'm here
[58:13.680 --> 58:17.120]  it's just like you know just like in the regular world you have but sure but if
[58:17.120 --> 58:21.400]  he's telling the truth it'll show Michael Brown attacking well but Alex to
[58:21.400 --> 58:27.080]  me is it justification to shoot him six times as far as them being unarmed no I
[58:27.080 --> 58:31.040]  mean obviously we've got cases of police shooting innocent people all over the
[58:31.040 --> 58:35.560]  country I'm just saying having a race war isn't gonna fix any of it but no I
[58:35.560 --> 58:39.560]  hear you more calls coming up stay with us open phones next hour the Fritz

[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:38.360]  accelerating here domestically that's not my view that's a fact I think we can
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.200]  safely say that I predicted that Obama would try to stage a race war with the
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:46.840]  media manipulating people regardless what you think of the cops what side
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:52.760]  you're on this is being manipulated towards a larger crisis all Obama calls
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:58.000]  for reconciliation all of his surrogates and minions try to stir it up this is

[01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:02.040]  start to unfold right before our eyes and I must say have you heard the story of
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:08.760]  the woman that was a spokesman for that officer on the radio this morning no okay
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:15.000]  she come on the radio this morning I heard it on WLW out of a Cincinnati oh
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.520]  yeah WLW yeah yeah they played her segment on there and she said that when
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:25.520]  he rolled up on that scene that these two gentlemen were in the middle of the
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:30.720]  road he rolled his window down and he said you know for him to get out of the
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:35.600]  road and they wouldn't you know they was cussing at him or something I don't know
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:40.760]  what was said but she said that he pulled over a few feet up the road from
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:47.840]  them on the like the the berm and was looking in his mirror at them and at
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:53.600]  that time he heard come over the radio about these suspects to be on the lookout
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:58.800]  for that had just robbed this store well he looked in his mirror and he thought
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:03.440]  my goodness that looks like the suspects are talking about so he started
[01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:09.320]  to pull it from the cruiser and this gentleman that got shot bull rushed him
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:15.480]  in back into his cruiser I gotta say that fits with the bullet holes in the
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:21.680]  front remember they'd all said his hands were up and that the again I don't think
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.840]  we know the total truth yet but just entertaining this they said the hands
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.640]  were up and they was shot in the back well he wasn't shot in the back and the
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:34.280]  police were trying to shoot center of mass why would there be bullet holes in
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:39.520]  his hands unless he was running forward with his hands in front of his chest
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:45.760]  well the story gets better because she she said that this officer had said that
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:50.560]  there was a struggle inside the cruiser the gun had went off inside the cruiser
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:57.720]  and then these two suspects took off well knowing now that he'd heard this
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:04.320]  felony call that it came out now another felony has taken place because he's
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:09.200]  tried to get this officer's gun inside the cruiser he deploys from the cruiser
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:15.040]  and these guys are back off of him and the story that he told was that you know
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.240]  the gentleman that got shot was saying you're not gonna do nothing you know and
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.920]  he was yelling back at him and the officer said that it seemed that he was
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:28.280]  on something I don't know well I'll say this I'll say this somebody email us

[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:38.560]  trying to stir things up and get them violent. Kurt Nemo has another article
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.800]  nation of Islam and new black panthers directing violent protests in
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:48.640]  Ferguson and now more nights of intense looting and burning. The National Guard
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:52.920]  is being deployed heavy armored vehicles have now shown up and are coming off the
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:57.760]  backs of 18 wheelers right now. Meanwhile a Ferguson cop threatens to
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:01.560]  shoot a journalist somebody's got to talk to these police man about their PR
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:06.200]  tactics I mean it just you could not turn the public against you in a more
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:11.760]  ridiculous way this is just bad folks everybody just wants to fight. Ferguson
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:16.040]  riots being exacerbated by violent provocateurs again that's Watson has two
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:20.560]  reports out on that National Guard ordered on the streets of Ferguson Missouri
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:25.400]  why were the police in Ferguson told not to stop the rampant looting on Friday
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:31.520]  night are we on the verge of renewed race riots with the turn in the war cycle
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:36.280]  2014 the highway patrol puts out a statement saying outsiders are coming
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:41.240]  into Ferguson from St. Louis and other cities to take advantage of it to engage
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:46.840]  in criminal activity well here's the deal anybody tries to rob my operation
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:51.920]  or my house I'm gonna shoot you I don't care if you're white or you're black I
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.800]  catch somebody coming in my house I'm gonna defend myself you you understand
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:01.120]  that but the political correct folks are gonna promote this and say it's okay
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.520]  the looting and rioting well they're just angry you know this is a new race
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.640]  war and a class war and this is what you get because of the inequities out there
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:14.240]  on and on and on and the establishment is going to let this happen to cause a
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:19.200]  big fight I want to go to Tom and Wolverine and Phil and Raul I want to go
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.800]  quickly but Jim is a deputy sheriff and he was breaking down what he heard on
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:27.200]  the radio and I've seen some of these reports as well this is what they put
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:34.920]  the police report basically what you're saying about what was seen and
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:40.200]  reportedly what happened so recap it and finish finish your story dealing with
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:44.040]  Michael Brown who again they tried to use a photo of the guy five years ago
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:48.160]  looking like a little kid I mean he is a big guy with all these thug pictures
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:53.160]  flipping people off with that hole I'm a gangster you know thug attitude I'm not
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:57.280]  saying he deserved to be shot in the back but now the autopsies out he was
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.320]  shot in the front and I'm not defending the police carte blanche I mean we've
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.600]  got checkpoints that are illegal we've got the police shooting rubber bullets
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:11.160]  and innocent reporters and lying about it we've got examples of all sorts of
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:16.040]  stuff we don't want the police state and a race war will sell the police state
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:20.600]  the federalization the armored vehicles which again are really meant for the
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:24.600]  tea party so after we've set the precedent here and had this splendid
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.800]  little race war it'll be fun to watch on television for some of the sick
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:32.280]  warriors out there we will be left with homeland security on the streets of
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.760]  America under the political correctness and then everyone will have to
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:41.440]  subscribe and subscribe to political correctness as the new religion to never
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:48.920]  allow the riots of 2014 again this is the false flag I'm not speculating I
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:54.480]  predicted it all on July 17th and did an emergency special report up on
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:12:00.440]  infowars.com and we'll put that on screen for TV viewers US Army trains to
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:05.040]  fight black Americans doomsday Disneyland facility uses practice
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:09.960]  ground for civil unrest and I say in the video and in the article the next
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:15.640]  shoot-a-drop will be exacerbating staging or or manipulating something like
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:22.680]  this into a conflagration and now we have the feds there openly manipulating
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:27.720]  this I mean look at all the race-baiting of MSNBC getting all this hyped up it's
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.440]  like a Ku Klux Klan channel for blacks and Hispanics or something but it's all
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:35.920]  a bunch of white globalist and neural-order engineers leftist that want
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:40.360]  clowered and piven to bring this country down shut off the power plants bring in
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:45.600]  unlimited illegals stir everybody up sell the idea that you're poor because of
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.280]  racist white people no you're poor because the globalist offshore I'm sorry
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:53.680]  I'm ranting I apologize Jim finish your story I'll go to everybody go ahead well
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:58.840]  Alex I'll tell you if what that woman said is true when he deployed from that
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:04.760]  cruiser this guy was taunting him and then he full rushed him again and after
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:10.120]  what he had just experienced inside that cruiser I must say I would have taken
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:15.680]  the same action that he took and what makes me absolutely vomit over this
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:20.320]  whole incident is how the how the globalist and how these people are
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:24.640]  turning this probably and I don't know because I haven't got all the facts yet
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:29.960]  what seems to me if this is true to be a justifiable act on this officer's part
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:34.600]  that these people are trying to turn us against each other and trying trying to
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:39.600]  get this country in such an upheaval to where this is going on all over the
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:44.440]  place and and I mean it's just it's sickening to be an officer in this
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.440]  country and to see you know that there are some good men out here that are
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:53.080]  trying to serve and protect their communities and then we all get kind of
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:57.360]  labeled in this one batch and it's not fair to the good officers that are out
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:00.360]  well exactly but that's how the black folks feel when the thugs come in from
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:04.440]  st. Louis and do all this and then they all lose their right to demonstrate and
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.920]  again the average cop I know is most police are really nice smart people
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.320]  that know what's going on I'm just honest about that most police I know are
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:16.000]  listeners that I run into and and and I don't just mean they come up to me
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.360]  because they're listeners I mean I talk to other police and they say a lot of
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:23.400]  police are awake to what's happening we don't want to make the police our enemy
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:27.160]  we don't want the globalists to get this whole thing stirred up so they can
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:30.680]  fully federalize them and then turn around and use them against the Tea
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:34.420]  Party I just want to figure out how to diffuse the situation I appreciate your
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:41.480]  call let's go ahead now and go to Raul in California thanks for holding her on
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:50.240]  the air yes sir hello hey don't I'm calling I'm thinking thank you for your
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:55.960]  time for to forgive me for to come talk on there I was in the Navy for two and
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:15:00.640]  a half years I got a military because of all colleagues at a military because when
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:04.840]  I was in there I see something that is struck the disturbing you know we were
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:09.840]  when we're in Guam deployed we're being trained on the mock on the kind like a
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:16.080]  mock American normal cookie cutter home neighborhood you know we're being trained
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:21.000]  to go in there shut it down several command and and pretty much anybody they
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:27.280]  did not did they did not go with the was going on with the March along we we had
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.560]  to defend them and arrest them and we're being trained to go around in confiscate
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:34.920]  weapons you know well that's it it is admitted that the military especially
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:39.880]  the last seven years has accelerated its training for martial law and for gun
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:44.160]  confiscation look at Katrina for all the good old boys out there that just see a
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:50.600]  bunch of thugs and hey let's crush these looters understand once New Orleans
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:54.120]  descended into chaos they went to the high and dry areas and confiscated the
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:59.640]  guns so people need to understand that this globalist manipulation is just
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:04.120]  that a manipulation and I don't know how to stop it now because you've got
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:08.960]  Justice Department people you've got the racist thug new Black Panther Party in
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:13.840]  the middle of this clearly trying to stir it up and it's a serious situation
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:19.680]  Wolverine in Tennessee your National Guard what's your breakdown on this well
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:24.040]  Alex I mean I said well first of all it's an honor to talk to you but secondly I'm
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:27.560]  in the National Bar's training for this because that's what we're designed for the
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:31.160]  National Guard you know what I mean and now you got like a new battlefield game
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:35.160]  you actually hunt down tea partiers with a gas and flag both of the enemies and
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:38.760]  the video games and like you say complete style from that perspective too
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:43.560]  also I've got a cousin in the Navy he rolled up on a FEMA camp and me and him
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:47.840]  have been talking and he thinks that what's going to end up happening Alex is
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.480]  they keep cutting all the benefits of the military they just cut a for tuition
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.560]  and the GI Bill and stuff they're going to keep cutting back and then they're
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:59.360]  going to say okay National Guard if you want your benefits back go arrest these
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:03.080]  American citizens here they're protesting and a lot of people want to
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:06.120]  go with it because they want their benefits back and I hate to say but I
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:11.320]  believe that's the truth you're absolutely right before they brought in all
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.560]  these you in controls the National Parks they cut their pay for a year and then
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:19.400]  said do what we say and the money will come back and that's what they do they
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:26.240]  they socially engineer people and it's now come out that they do have the
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.320]  Justice Department they're running things and provocaturing things to try to
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.720]  stir this up and it's another betrayal of the entire community especially black
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:40.680]  folks I appreciate your call fill in New Jersey we're moving quick now retired
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:45.880]  special operations Phil what is your breakdown on this well you know unfortunately
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:50.600]  Alex I think it's everything that you've been saying come until unfold and I
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:54.520]  guess quote one of your guests at Yale and quite frequently if something's
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:57.200]  going on over here what's going on on the other side that's kind of more
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:02.280]  important you know if this is happening there's got to be something else bigger
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:04.880]  happening behind our backs that isn't making it out there and I
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:08.560]  unfortunately I think that you're kind of spot on with it and also I wanted to
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:12.960]  kind of mention to you about something that I was I was a part of in the special
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.560]  operations community that was happening at my unit was how we were trying to
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:22.160]  set up actually being set up called Tom ox domestic operations but what that was
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:30.000]  is basically getting some of us to backfill FBI teams on using door to door
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.440]  basically you know door kicking here in the United States and we you know we're
[01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:39.280]  trying to they were trying to write a proposal for it on the military side the
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:42.280]  side they weren't going to do it because there's better if the better approach
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:47.440]  was it to have the FBI write it so that got pushed up the FBI change man we
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:51.160]  make its way down to the military side sure that's been going on since the 80s
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:57.480]  secretly we were given a secret document by an FBI agent on I-35 during an army
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:01.920]  checkpoint and we don't know to this day whether he gave it to it on purpose or it
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:06.480]  was a mistake but it was classified and the documents on info wars.com it
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:14.040]  made the news and it said that regular army was doing checkpoints door kicking
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:19.440]  warrant service all under the cover of bomb disposal EOD but that's only the
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:26.360]  cover and yes the FBI is over it domestically so that's but but let's
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:31.160]  say it was a one on a Richter scale it's like a 50 now I mean it was very secret
[01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:34.480]  of back then but but Mike Hanson was on the side of the road the police had
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:37.640]  threatened to arrest him he got back 200 yards FBI agent pulls up in the black
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:41.960]  sedan gets out and goes here is for the press this is what's going on now you
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:46.360]  need to leave or you're gonna get arrested and Mike Hanson said okay he
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:50.640]  already gotten footage got in his car left and it was a secret document and
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:55.880]  in an unmarked FBI car just pulls up here's your document we're just like

[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.600]  truck driver that can barely pay his rent to almost be killed because well
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:39.240]  somebody else died so it's your fault you need to die and this is how the left's
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:43.640]  gonna take over America they're going to stage all this provocateur this use a
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:49.400]  tragedy to bring this into place and then have the middle class I don't care
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:54.520]  what color you are cheering the National Guard on as they stop riots around
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:59.520]  the country which actually stirs up more riots and then the establishment will
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:05.040]  stage terror attacks claiming that it's the right wing and the veterans that are
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:10.040]  angry at the government and so now Homeland Security's got to arrest all
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:14.560]  of them and I keep telling you this is the plan you notice it's just following
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:20.840]  the script I know the New World Order fill in New Jersey retired special ops
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:27.880]  my second police state film the takeover from from the year 2000 has video
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:32.560]  of the Army checkpoint video of the document where it says do not hesitate
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:39.400]  us you know do not hesitate to call us 24 hours a day seven days a week we're
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:46.040]  ready to serve warrants whatever you want we're here and the issue is secret
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:51.920]  government totally illegal the end of Posse commentators just like the NSA
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:57.640]  the rest of it they sell all this illegal stuff as part of the drug war
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:02.740]  all the whole time it's being built up to target the American people during the
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:06.440]  total takeover so how do you get the right wing to accept troops on the
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:12.800]  streets use them against black people this is the full spectrum dominance
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:16.880]  mastery of what they're carrying out and I cringe to think what's going to
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.840]  happen with the National Guard as demonstrations start to spread nationwide
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:29.400]  because you've got provocateurs from the Justice Department inside right now we
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:33.080]  have the articles in the video and the proof up on info wars.com any other
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:38.160]  points Phil yeah Alex I think I mean you're completely on with that like how
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.640]  do you get the right wing to go with it I think they're already on board with
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:44.120]  this like how do you how you're able to sell their can you know their their
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:47.720]  supporters on going along with it they're good you know the mainstream you
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:51.440]  know left and right are playing in the same tent they're just enemies out on
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:55.720]  the you know world stage you know another point I want to bring up is that
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:59.080]  they've been across five different websites during the commercial break and
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.200]  I'm seeing all this different information and that one thing that's out
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:06.160]  there is like how does this guy get shot in his hand he sticks for on the firearms
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.200]  instructor also I'll tell you one of the most difficult weapons that I've you
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:14.640]  know had to help people learn how to shoot is a handgun and from 25 excuse me
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:18.680]  from 25 yards they can't even hit the steel plate so that shot in the hand
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:24.080]  was probably a lucky shot to that guy I probably couldn't do it again so well
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.800]  I mean if somebody's bull rushing you they're going to have their hands out
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:33.360]  in front of their chest you're going to be shooting center of mass where some
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:39.680]  of the bullet holes are it's going to go through your hands like his hands are
[01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:42.680]  up over his head and it goes back to all the stuff that you keep on saying it's
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:45.240]  a disinformation and like I'm just sitting back trying to get all the
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:48.600]  information to make an intelligent decision about this without passing
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:53.800]  judgment well the police have been caught lying so many times that I get
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:28:00.560]  people not buying what they're saying but that's a separate issue from the
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:06.480]  fact that the globalist wanted to stabilize this country and for all of
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:10.200]  us that's what we should be worried about that's what we should be focused
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:14.520]  on is what is the Justice Department the new black Panther Party and all these
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:19.160]  acorn type groups down there what are they doing and they're trying to stir
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:25.040]  things up to make it even bigger and the police did things like attacking
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:29.240]  reporters and then lying about it that only hurts their credibility so it's a
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:36.320]  perfect storm of screw-ups here or it's being done on purpose Tom in New York
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:40.520]  former police what's your view on all this all right let's go to this real
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:44.080]  fast and be right on the point with it because your first two callers were
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:48.680]  correct the first thing is we need to come back to the initial event in your
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:54.200]  second caller that described the woman that has given testimony saying that
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:58.520]  she is a friend of the fiance or girlfriend of the officer involved in
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:03.680]  this in her account it matches up with other details the witnesses that took
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:07.800]  video that you can find on YouTube but that were at the scene where Michael
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:11.600]  Brown's body was laying in the street a man can be heard in the background
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:16.040]  describing how when the officer pulled up on him people surrounding him were
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:20.840]  questioning his positioning in the street and from that they started asking
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:25.160]  well how did he get in that exact position a man could be heard saying in
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:31.240]  the background that initially he was up on the truck he ran turned around came
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:35.720]  back towards the vehicle and several times what he described as dumping
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:39.760]  meaning unloading the cliff on what would have been Michael Brown he thought
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:46.000]  he was missing him which then ties in to also the story that the woman had given
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.240]  claiming that when she had spoiled I don't hear about this on the march stay with us

[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:04.440]  them free. If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:11.640]  for an outright ban picking up every one of them Mr. and Mrs. America turn them
[01:33:11.640 --> 01:33:15.600]  all in I would have done it. But I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:20.000]  that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not in the hands of criminals.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.760]  There just have to be repetitive about this it's not enough to simply have a
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:28.480]  catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday we need to do this every
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:32.440]  day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:37.080]  in a vastly different way. Enough, enough, enough.
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:41.360]  Mayor Bloomberg, how are you doing? Jason, I go to Brooklyn. Okay. In the spirit of gun control will you disarm
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:56.000]  your entire security team? You'll get back to me. They may feel that it's
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.440]  part of a romanticized culture there's there's a there's an aspect of this a
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:05.200]  kind of Wild West cowboy dirty harry aspect there's also an aspect. So they're
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:11.200]  macho men and they gotta have a gun. Go ahead make my day. Anybody that wants to disarm me
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:16.840]  and drop dead. A trio of would-be burglars picked the wrong Albuquerque
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.800]  house to break into. Police say when the three teens tried open the door a brave
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:26.760]  little girl was waiting for them locked and loaded. It's harder to use a the
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:41.000]  assault weapon that hits something that is a shotgun, okay? You don't need AR-15. It's
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:51.840]  harder to aim. It's harder to use. In fact, you don't need 30 rounds to protect
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:58.840]  yourself. Why shotgun? Why shotgun? Vice President Biden and I had a meeting with
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:05.120]  a group of technology people and talk about how guns can be made more safe by
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:10.200]  making them either through fingerprint identification the gun talks to a
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:13.520]  bracelet or something that you might wear. Anybody that wants to make me
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:19.800]  unarmed and helpless people that want to literally create the proven places where
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:24.320]  more innocents are killed called gun-free zones. We're gonna beat you. We're gonna
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.640]  vote you out of office or suck on my machine gun. That's why you're going to
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:31.640]  fail and the establishment knows no matter how much propaganda the Republic
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:35.480]  will rise again when you attempt to take our guns. Guns will be taken. No one will
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:39.400]  be able to be armed. We will take all weapons. I believe that as Americans we
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:43.480]  have a right arm ourselves against criminals but we don't need the ability
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:47.640]  arm ourselves against the army or the police. United States military is not
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:52.080]  out to get us. The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:57.320]  buying screen. It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition. The
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:36:02.160]  second amendment is there so and it was put in there not for hunting and
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:05.840]  fishing like they like to say because back when they did it if you didn't
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:10.480]  hunt or fish you didn't eat. It was put in there so the citizens would have the
[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.520]  ability if their government became oppressive they could defend themselves
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:19.480]  against oppressive government. Hitler took the guns. Stalin took the guns.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:23.960]  Mal took the guns. Fidel Castro took the guns. Hugo Chavez took the guns. And I'm
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:28.960]  here to tell you 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:39.200]  I don't want that man to have a gun. I wouldn't feel comfortable having an
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:44.720]  argument with him in his home where he had access to his 50 weapons. Challenge
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:49.280]  Alex Jones to a boxing match. Show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:54.400]  and pop them. I'd love to see that. In uniform.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:14.040]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. We're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not backing down if you want to come and take us.
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:18.120]  And their answer is they're going to open the borders up and instantly let anybody
[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:21.560]  that comes here vote and get free welfare. They're going to send the Justice
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:24.320]  Department in to stir up the black community that's got some real issues,
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:28.320]  some real beefs, but at the same time they're selling race war as legitimate
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:33.920]  now even in Time Magazine saying it's part of a legitimate class struggle while
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:39.480]  the ultra-rich fund the whole de-evolution of the country. Up on
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:45.120]  drugsreport.com. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Coming race war won't be about race, but
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:51.560]  it is a race war. Jesse Jackson booed after fundraising from the podium.
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:58.600]  Protester, if I've got a die tonight I won't mind. 57% of blacks in a poll think
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:05.480]  cop guilty of murder. Obama to meet with Holder. Oh to try to fix things. And the
[01:38:05.480 --> 01:38:11.880]  DOG, the DOJ, Communist, New Black Panthers, hijacked Ferguson protest. That
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:18.240]  article is up on info wars.com. It's top linked on drudgereport.com. Missouri
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:26.360]  governor calls in troops, snubs, White House, pot found in teens body. I would
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:29.280]  imagine more than that was found according to eyewitness reports. He
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:34.160]  seemed like he was really crazed especially in that video robbing the
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:40.880]  store. But again that isn't why the cop was out basically originally making
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:45.880]  contact with him. There's gonna be tragedies like this anyway you slice it.
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:56.440]  So what's the larger issue here? It's the time of crisis. It's the organized
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:00.760]  crises. It's the White House not letting a good crisis go to waste. You know this
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:06.400]  came out on Friday. If folks want to see photos of the officer, Yahoo News
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:11.320]  covered it. Photos. Ferguson officer Darren Wilson earned police honor before
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:16.600]  fatal shooting. Patrolman's father recently sought prayers for a very
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:26.200]  challenging family situation. Six months before he shot and killed an unarmed
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:29.840]  teenager, police officer Darren Wilson earned accommodation for his extraordinary
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:34.040]  effort. The line of duty Yahoo News confirmed the award through February 11th
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:38.920]  Ferguson City Council meeting minutes and photos Wilson's father posted to his
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:43.120]  Facebook page. Very proud of my son Darren Wilson on receiving a
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:47.520]  commendation from his police department. John Wilson wrote on February 11th
[01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:51.920]  congratulations son. One image shows Wilson shaking hands and receiving the
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:56.200]  commendation from Ferguson police chief Jackson. In a second photo the tall and
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:06.680]  slender Wilson brandishes a smile as he returns to his seat. 28 year old officer.
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:15.400]  What he did to earn the commendation is not immediately known. So trying to
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:20.560]  figure out exactly what's going on with all this. While IS runs around murdering
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:24.960]  Christians all over the Middle East, while the dollar devalues, while the new
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:28.400]  hoax has put out that Russia invaded with armored vehicles and they all got
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:32.280]  blown up with no photos or videos and now it's basically admitted to be a total
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:38.240]  hoax, stuff is getting crazy and the last thing we need is a bunch of
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:42.880]  destabilization to give the system a pretext to come down everybody. I'm gonna
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:47.720]  go back to Tom then Chris, Michael, John, Alex and others that are patiently
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:53.760]  holding here today. I do want to focus in next hour on some of the news we haven't
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:59.280]  covered. Fritz Springmeier will be with us for 30 minutes and author, researcher,
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:03.520]  lecturer, dealing on what makes the globalist tick, what their mindsets are
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:08.160]  and then I had a chance to sit down with Joe Rogan for probably 45 minutes
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:14.840]  Saturday when he was here in town. It's a video interview. I'm gonna air about six
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:20.840]  seven minutes of that exclusively here with the host of UFC, well-known movie
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:25.640]  star, host of Fear Factor and scores of other shows. We had a really good talk,
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:28.120]  one of the best interviews I've ever done with Joe and I've been I've been
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.760]  interviewing Joe since 99. I've known him since 98. We've become good friends over
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:36.200]  the years and he just becomes more and more popular. In fact, he has about the
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:41.960]  most popular podcast out there for just general topics. We have the most popular
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:45.800]  political but he has one of the most popular, not the most popular in general
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:49.360]  topics, his video podcast and he's definitely a cultural phenomenon,
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:54.480]  sells out 10,000 person arenas all over the United States. He's got a new comedy
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:58.960]  special coming out and we're gonna go hunting soon. He's gonna come to Texas,
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:03.160]  we're gonna go hunting and videotape it. He was saying he wants to do that and he
[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:07.760]  said, when are you coming to LA to be on my podcast? Someday. I just never go to
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:13.000]  LA as everybody knows but it was good to see Joe and a few days we'll air the
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.600]  whole interview at the end of the nightly news but we'll air part of that
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:20.080]  today where he talks about Ferguson, he talks about the police state, talks about
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:25.480]  Obama, he talks about how he knew Robin Williams. Robin Williams was a fan of Joe
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:31.080]  Rogan so that is coming up as well today. I want to go to London, England. Paul Joseph
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:37.960]  Watson has been watching this from afar looking at how they have been using the
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:41.960]  riots in England a few years ago to bring in draconian controls against
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:47.840]  everyone as well. Paul, it's very hard to get people to pull outside the controlled
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:51.680]  political spectrum and see it from outside the box but I want to get your
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:55.400]  expert analysis of this and the research you're doing, the video clips you have,
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:01.720]  the eyewitnesses including elected black leaders in the area who are saying that
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:07.560]  this is provocateur. They were the same leaders who said last week Ferguson police
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:12.360]  stood down that's now been confirmed by the state police so these are some
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:19.480]  pretty credible people that are saying that there are provocateurs working for
[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:23.440]  people that we know work for the Justice Department throwing things at the
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:29.040]  police and now gunshots. Someone shot at the police last night, someone shot at
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:34.040]  their helicopter last week and then the police go into animal mode and start
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:38.200]  shooting reporters with rubber bullets, just shooting anyone they can shoot.
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:42.720]  This is a recipe for disaster. Paul Joseph Watson, thank you for joining us.
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:47.960]  Good to be here, Alex. Get into it. What's your view on this and break down
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:53.360]  your story that's top linked on drudgereport.com dealing with the DOJ
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:58.240]  communist and new black Panthers, hijacked Ferguson protest, leader of
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:03.360]  Meligin Group, pictured coordinating with police. Well, it's a shame that that's top
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:06.520]  linked on drudging away, Alex, because I've got an even bigger story that's
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:10.080]  probably going to be up by the end of the show. Of course, we've been talking
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:14.120]  about riots, preparations for civil unrest. Literally, I mean, you've been
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:17.320]  doing it for over 10 years, police state documentaries. We've been doing it
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:21.680]  intensively over the past several months, including just a month ago with the
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:26.280]  article you mentioned earlier about preparing for black Americans, preparing
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:31.400]  to arrest them, in turn them. But this is a new document and the headline that I've
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:36.800]  gone with is US Army preparing for, quote, full-scale riots in US. And we've
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:40.960]  had these kind of document releases before. Normally, they take two years
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:43.840]  from the point where they're written to the point where they actually come
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:49.400]  public. But this one's recent. It's just from April 21st, Department of the Army,
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:56.040]  2014, it's called Civil Disturbances. And it basically gets into how they're
[01:44:56.040 --> 01:45:02.160]  preparing for full-scale riots in Conus within the continental United States.
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:08.800]  They talk about demonstrations, protests. They talk about anti-WTO protests. They
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:16.320]  talk about ethnic hatred, civil unrest from urban situations that
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:21.000]  arise out of highly emotional, social, and economic issues. The most shocking
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.760]  aspect of it is they are talking about lethal response as a part in the
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:31.400]  document, which is entitled, lethal response for crowd control, sniper response.
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:36.760]  Remember, this is both outside and within the United States. And it says,
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:42.400]  sniper response ensure that target leaders or troublemakers are targeted,
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:47.920]  exploit the psychological effect of an attack. They talk about escalate
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:52.240]  gradually, starting with a small caliber single round and work up to a large
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:58.960]  caliber automatic. And this is targeting, quote, unarmed civilians within the
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:00.240]  United States.
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:04.880]  So here's the headline. Army prepares to shoot and kill unarmed civilians. This is
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:09.440]  Nazi Germany. And when did this document come out, Paul?
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:14.240]  It came out publicly two days ago. It's been on the Internet for two days.
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:19.520]  But also there's an update to Civil Disturbances 3-39.33 that we got two
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:22.960]  years ago that Drudge linked to, where they were training the processes into
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:27.040]  the camps, VR, social security numbers. This is what I see happening, Paul, and
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:30.640]  I've been saying it for months intensely. Again, they sell the public on
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:34.640]  martial law because cities are burning. But then the main training is for the
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:39.600]  Tea Party and gun owners. And then next phase, the gun confiscation begins on the
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:44.000]  nationwide basis like Katrina, civil war breaks out. And the police and
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:49.160]  military are already honed and ready to follow orders. That's why the city who's
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:51.960]  been training with the military, remember two years ago,
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:56.840]  they're all around St. Louis, that's why they were targeting leaders and our
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:01.720]  reporters with the 223s and aiming at them because this was obviously federal
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:06.040]  training to decapitate the press. My God, Paul, and you're saying in the
[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:10.360]  document they talk about shooting unarmed Americans.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:15.480]  Yeah, I mean that's, it's lethal response for crowd control and it's within
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:20.520]  the United States against quote, unarmed civilians. That is an unprecedented statement.
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:23.480]  When is your article coming out? I am blown away.
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:26.600]  I'll try and get it up before the end of the show, but they've also got a
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:32.360]  diagram of the human body. And they talk about deadly force final target areas.
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:37.560]  And I basically highlight the back of the neck, the head, the heart, and the spine
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:41.400]  as the key target areas which will induce unconsciousness,
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:47.640]  serious bodily injury, shock, or death from the snipers, from the high caliber
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:51.080]  weapons that they talk about earlier. Well, this is treason, ladies and
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:54.680]  gentlemen, because again, it'll all look reasonable when the cities are burning,
[01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:58.520]  as I've said a thousand times literally, but it's all scripted.
[01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:02.440]  And then we're all supposed to play along with the giant scripted event.
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:07.560]  Paul, is there any way in your view to avert this?
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:12.520]  I think if they continue to push it, I mean, it's coming to a head, isn't it?
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:17.000]  In fact, what's funny about this document is it says that...
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.440]  Let me get the exact quote. Oh my god, I just found chapter 3,
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:26.200]  3-13 on how to kill unarmed U.S. citizens targeting the spine and the heart.
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:31.720]  I mean, this... Exactly, it's shocking....escalation of trauma chart.
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:35.640]  Yeah, and they show the human body the key areas that they would need to hit in
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:38.280]  order to basically kill people. And again, you know...
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:43.640]  They also say target the target the genitals. That's good, go ahead.
[01:48:43.640 --> 01:48:49.240]  We talked about it when the 2010 document, which came out two years later, got released,
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:52.120]  there was this huge wave of denial from people saying,
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:56.600]  this is for foreign occupation, this is not domestic, even though they said over
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:00.520]  and over again, conus within the continental United States.
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:05.080]  Yes, it's also for outside, but it's also for inside the United States.
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:08.040]  So just to get ahead of that expected denial,
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:12.200]  it says it's for domestic as well as foreign occupation.
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:17.480]  And they talk about how Posse Comitatus and the Constitution of the United States
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:21.400]  does not apply, that's the quote, under the exception
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:24.680]  where the right of the U.S. government to ensure the preservation of public order
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:29.400]  and carrying out governmental operations within its territorial limits by force,
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:34.760]  if necessary, under emergency authority, a sudden expected civil disturbance.
[01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:38.440]  Unbelievable. Disaster or calamity. So this is domestic.
[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:46.680]  I am just speechless at this point. I knew when I went in 99 to Marine Corps training
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:51.960]  urban warfare operations in San Francisco and Oakland,
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:55.640]  they were training to confiscate guns and training to execute patriots,
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:59.880]  but then they would parade black people around in front of the news cameras
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:03.400]  and say, oh, it's for inner city people using underlying racism,
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:05.560]  but then the real training was for patriots,
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:07.800]  and I learned that from police chiefs and others.
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:11.720]  So now we see a long-term plan that they've had since Clinton
[01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:15.720]  preparing to go operational. There's got to be some way to stop this, Paul,
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:19.080]  because once the military starts a civil war with the patriots,
[01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:23.240]  because first it'll be against the, quote, minorities,
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:26.120]  it'll be ordered by the Democrats to go out and burn and riot,
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:30.520]  but then they'll subside, then the real war starts against the patriots.
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:35.160]  This is a total nightmare, Paul. You can see the master plan.
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:39.080]  I'm skipping this network break. It's so important. I'm skipping this network break.
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:42.520]  Paul, I am just speechless right now, and I'm also speechless.
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:46.600]  I'm not bragging. It's so scary that we have accurately, and no one else has,
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:54.440]  literally predicted the entire paradigm and actually figured out what they would pull.
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:58.440]  And for those that don't understand, they're going to come after the liberty movement,
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:03.640]  claiming that we will start blowing up federal facilities or attacking minority groups.
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:09.080]  So they'll use the race war as the pretext to come in as the referee.
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:12.200]  And again, the military and the police, they're in the middle of it too.
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:15.720]  They're compartmentalized just like we are. They will then stage false flags
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.440]  to blame on the liberty movement that will escalate the rioting.
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:24.520]  And then the answer will be take out the leaders and they will literally arrest me,
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:30.040]  Ron Paul, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry's already going to jail today, or tomorrow he's got to go to jail.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:36.360]  I mean, we're all just going to go to jail. And by the way, I'm not joking about this.
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:38.040]  Some people say, well, I thought you don't like Rick Perry.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:43.800]  Rick Perry was a Democrat before. Rick Perry talks a lot of good talk,
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:48.440]  but waffles, but compared to Obama, I mean, it's not bad. It doesn't matter.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:52.280]  If Republicans were arresting innocent Democrats, filmmakers,
[01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:55.640]  they were going into Democrat churches and taking their 501 C threes.
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:59.000]  If the Republicans were involved in a political purge
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:02.840]  of Republicans or Democrats, I would come out against it.
[01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:06.920]  So there's the backdrop of Dinesh de Souza getting arrested,
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:12.360]  the IRS going after pro-life groups, MSNBC saying, of course we're going after you, you're racist.
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:17.240]  MSNBC saying, I'm behind the Boston bombing with no proof.
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:23.560]  They crossed a Rubicon, folks. It means they've been given authorizations to lose lawsuits.
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:28.760]  It means that they know a future is coming where lawsuits won't matter.
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:33.320]  They've taken off the gloves. They've put battle axes in their hands.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:39.000]  They're not just taking gloves off, folks. They are a criminal group taking over.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.920]  And that's why so many Republican leaders go, sure, you can put our
[01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:47.400]  troops under you in control. Sure, you can open the borders up if you want to without even an
[01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:52.600]  executive order. Sure, you can do, sure, you can do whatever you want because they're going for
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:58.600]  broke and they've decided to go along with it. They're being blackmailed. Paul, we have predicted
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:04.760]  all of this. We have covered all of this. Undoubtedly, this is them preparing to move.
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:09.320]  We may be able to back them off. Cooler heads may prevail. But I got to tell you,
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:16.040]  the general public's so ignorant. A lot of these welfare queens are so arrogant and they're so
[01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:21.320]  racially hateful. They just love it. They're walking right into a trap. Do you have any idea
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:28.440]  how to turn this around, Paul Watson? I think the only hope is to reach out to people within
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:33.800]  the police, the National Guard and the military. Similar to, you know, the wave of police brutality
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:38.600]  has had the effect of making some police wake up to the fact that people's constitutional rights
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:43.400]  need to be respected, which is why we see more and more examples of, you know, when people are
[01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:47.880]  out filming the police, some of those officers come up and say, no, I totally understand. You've
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:53.080]  got a right to film the police. I've got no problem with that because of the videos they've seen on
[01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:58.600]  YouTube about people getting harassed for it. So I think the more exposed this information becomes,
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:02.600]  the more that people within the police and the military will wake up to it. And that will
[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:07.240]  obviously have an effect on their own individual behaviour and the choices they make. But you're
[01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:12.600]  talking earlier about how this has been applied domestically. Remember Concorde City, New Hampshire,
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:18.120]  when they applied for the grant for the armoured Bearcat vehicle last year, the police chief
[01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:25.320]  specifically said that it was needed to, quote, coat with the threat posed by libertarians and
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:30.280]  occupy activists in the region. That's right. They mix libertarians and tea partiers in
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:35.480]  with al-Qaeda, you name it. That's because the main training the Justice Department has said
[01:54:35.480 --> 01:54:38.840]  is for returning veterans, Christians, gun owners, libertarians,
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:45.080]  mainline conservatives, constitutionalists. We're not telling people this in a vacuum.
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:50.840]  You know, Joe Rogan said to me, he goes, I can't believe 15, 16 years ago, you told me the NSA
[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:55.480]  was spying on me, how they were doing it. You told me they were preparing for martial law.
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:59.480]  And now it's all coming true. You know, you must have a crystal ball. And I said, no, Joe,
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:07.160]  I've got the documents. It's all in the Rand Corporation National Stabilization Force plan.
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:15.560]  And the point is the globalist engineer the destabilization to then sell the takeover,
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:22.600]  just like they ship the drugs in to destabilize the country as a pretext to take control of the
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:30.120]  society. It goes as far back as the 80s, doesn't it, Alex, with Rex 84, because they were talking
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:34.840]  about locking people up who were considered national security threats. That was a quote
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:41.720]  under the auspices of a national emergency. US Army War College 2008 warned the United States
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:47.000]  may experience massive civil unrest in the wake of a series of crises, which it's strategic shock.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:51.640]  And that's in relation to an economic collapse, which again, people are talking about another
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:56.360]  economic collapse in the works. So it's not as if this is a secret. Sometimes it takes a couple
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:01.160]  of years for the documents to be released, but we're merely quoting from the documents. And
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:06.120]  then we see events like Ferguson unfold. So yeah, we don't have a crystal ball. We're just paying
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:11.240]  attention to what the government's doing behind the scenes. And let's not forget, they're not
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:17.080]  preparing for contingencies. They're saying this will happen while the border is completely wide
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:21.960]  open. And we'll all have this big distraction now of more demonstrations, riots, looting,
[01:56:22.760 --> 01:56:31.560]  as the most unsavory elements of thug life show up now, the MTV culture,
[01:56:32.680 --> 01:56:38.840]  with all their liberal fellow travelers to promote the rioting and looting. This is just a disaster
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:43.240]  upon a disaster. And we all got a taste for the Washington Post reporter being arrested.
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:48.120]  Our reporters peacefully out there being attacked of what the police are ready to do,
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:54.120]  playing right into the hands of this whole disaster. And this is also the globalist can
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:59.080]  rob the country blind. Paul Watson, I'm going to let you go so you can get that report up.
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:07.400]  If you can get it done by overdrive, I can hardly even broadcast right now, folks. This is so epic.
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:12.600]  This is so huge. Try to get your article out by the end so I can have you on for another 15,
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:17.720]  20 minutes of overdrive so that we have a special report to show the document and go over for people.
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:22.520]  Try. I'm going to let you go, Paul. Get your, get your basic report up right now. Put in there
[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:26.840]  how we predicted it, my video from July 17th, where I said they're going to stage race riots,
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:32.040]  bring in martial law that way, stage the terror attacks, blame it on the Tea Party. And then
[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:35.480]  then they're going to try to come after me and others. And I just, I'm so sick of it.
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:45.160]  I appreciate you. Appreciate you, Paul. All right. Thanks. It's like a marathon. I've been doing this
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:51.720]  19 years and I've had special forces try to set fires and blame them on me in Florida.
[01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:55.240]  I've been, I've had so much stuff. I won't even get it all the stuff I've seen.
[01:57:56.920 --> 01:58:01.160]  It's just the public has no idea how much danger we're in. This is real. And I hope all the people
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:06.040]  at salon and the Huffington Post and all you guys that make jokes about this and, you know, Alex
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:11.560]  Jones, haha. Look, it's all true. The NSA spying, the cancer viruses and the vaccines, all of it.
[01:58:11.560 --> 01:58:16.440]  I know a lot of you know this. You plan on the authoritarian takeover. You're actually just purely
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:21.080]  evil people, but a lot of you aren't. You're trendy liberals that got hired to be part of this.
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:25.000]  You've gone along with it. You do not want to go along with this. Okay. I'm warning you.
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:33.240]  This is so dangerous. This is so evil. This is so bad. We've got to stop the civil war.
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:38.040]  I'll tell the police too. I think 300,000 of you are going to get killed in this
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:41.160]  conservatively. Please support the broadcast. Spread the word about it.

[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:03.560]  straight from the faucet. Next, we had them try a sample of tap water filtered with a

[01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:14.360]  water tastes like it's good water. Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride,
[01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:19.320]  chlorine, glyphosate and many others. Studies prove that these substances are linked to an

[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:27.960]  All right, Tom, Chris, Alex, Michael, John, we'll get to all of you. We've got guests coming up,
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:33.080]  obviously. Dead and new justice to Fritz Pringmeyer to have them on when all this is going on.
[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:37.000]  Talk about the Illuminati. We'll get a quick update from him and then I promise to have him
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:43.400]  up for an hour whenever this rioting craziness ends. I don't have a feeling that it may not.
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:47.000]  This is part of the global destabilization we're witnessing right now.
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.640]  Tom in New York, you held, you were finishing up a statement. Go ahead.
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:57.720]  Alex, I'm really trying to help you and everybody else involved with it. So I'm going to slow down
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:01.000]  and we're going to take this real quick point by point because these are the most important
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:06.120]  points I think that have been made so far in all this. Again, getting back to what your second
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:13.160]  caller stated about somebody close to the officer's significant other calling in a St. Louis radio
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:18.280]  station last week, given a statement that was passed on to her, which I personally myself
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:24.120]  cannot bet, does match up with eyewitness counts during the shooting of Michael Brown
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:30.280]  that both put him exactly in the same position in the street, both for what was said to have
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:35.560]  occurred in the shooting that he was charging the officer in the exact distance. Now with these two
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:41.400]  people never having met, I cannot believe that this is only a coincidence. As well, the Ferguson
[02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:47.160]  police chief on Friday in his initial police conference did give contradictory statements
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:52.120]  for anybody paying attention to that very specifically. And I say that to anybody out
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:57.880]  there that is former law enforcement or still currently involved, you did hear the detailed
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:03.960]  timeline of the events that occurred that 1148, Darren Wilson was responding to a medical call
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:08.440]  for which he was cleared due to the ambulance arriving on the scene and his presence was
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:17.800]  no longer necessary. At 1151, the theft call came in between 1151 and 1154. The description of the
[02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:23.800]  suspect and the strong armed robbery was given over that radio. You cannot tell me from 1148
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:31.960]  to 1154, Darren Wilson did not receive this information. So at some point upon his encounter
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:37.640]  with Michael Brown, he was aware of his status as a suspect. I highly doubt in the frame of
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:44.040]  mind that he was in, he was not still holding the box of Swisher Sweets, which going back to that,
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:47.960]  if you let me continue on this, please, it's a very important point. I used to work with
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:54.200]  anti theft apprehension back in New York. Most thieves are usually criminals of opportunity.
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:03:00.760]  Being something petty in small time as this, if Mr. Brown and no way had any involvement
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:07.080]  with any form of narcotics in the system during this altercation, then I do not believe he would
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:11.400]  have blatantly entered your store in broad daylight, gone over the counter, taken what he wanted.
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:15.400]  Sure. He was obviously bombed out of his brain when you watch the video and they get Swisher
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:21.000]  Sweets, folks get those to load them with the marijuana. That's the style of smoking it.
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:27.000]  Two or three of these, he grabbed an entire box. No, I know. That matches up with the statement
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:33.560]  given by the significant other's friend. Okay. So all these events leading up together,
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:38.520]  the police chief saying that they cannot be connected. This was after that midday lunch
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:43.160]  break. They talk later on in this afternoon. Sure. Sure. But look, look, look, the larger
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:46.680]  point I'm trying to get at here, I keep saying the issue, the issue, the issue is that they're
[02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:53.080]  trying to start a race war. Obama and the globalist want this. They've already made preparations for
[02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:58.600]  it. That's what I'm getting at. And they're going to then switch it and flip it onto the Tea Party
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:04.760]  because that's what the real training is for nine times out of 10. They are training to take on
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:09.720]  American gun owners. Can you imagine what that will look like for the police and military?
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:14.680]  Because I'll be right next to you in it. But the thing about it is this, we got to nip this thing
[02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:21.240]  in the bud and go back to the original incident that set all this off. And right now, another
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:27.240]  big thing I think that is being hugely overlooked and all this, you cannot tell me that the St.
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:32.440]  Louis Police Department, as well as the medical examiner's office has never collected forensic
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:38.520]  evidence, a gun and autopsy and a murder victim. Now, if the significant other story is correct,
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:45.560]  the gun was supposedly trying to be taken away from the officer inside the vehicle at his
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:51.480]  hip position. Now, Dorian, Michael Brown's friend, who I don't know what credibility you can give to
[02:04:51.480 --> 02:04:56.680]  him being involved in the robbery, one foot behind him and not consider an accomplice,
[02:04:56.680 --> 02:05:00.920]  said that he was. I hear you. I'll have to come back again. We got a guest. This is Alex Jones

[02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:07.320]  years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and detoxify. Most people know
[02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:13.720]  that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world. Iodine is key to so many of the body's
[02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:19.240]  functions, especially the thyroid. I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group. You now
[02:07:19.240 --> 02:07:25.080]  know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb. Then about a
[02:07:25.080 --> 02:07:29.800]  year ago he said, listen, if you think this is powerful, I'm going to come out with rare earth,
[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:35.800]  deep earth crystals. And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.

[02:08:10.520 --> 02:08:14.200]  resistance. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:32.200]  All right, Frick Springmeyer is the best-selling author, researcher. He's been a political
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:38.280]  president as well, totally set up for exposing a lot of the bizarre rituals that the globalists are
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:43.480]  into exposing some of the stuff that goes on in England with all the child kidnapping and the
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:49.320]  rest of it. He's going to be with us about 15, 20 minutes and I'll go back to your calls because
[02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:55.160]  this information is so important with Tom and Chris and Michael and John and Alex,
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:09:01.400]  former police, current police, national guard folks to talk about the Ferguson, Missouri situation
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:07.880]  that is clearly being stirred up by the Justice Department to then cause riots nationwide as
[02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:13.480]  a pretext to shell the public on troops and military on the street. It's all been premeditated
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:19.880]  and now more and more eyewitness accounts are coming out. I was just watching CNN saying indeed
[02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:27.720]  that Brown had charged the police officer and had tried to get his gun away. I don't know what the
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:33.880]  truth is. I know there's massive manipulation going on and I know that Paul Watson on air broke
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:44.600]  last hour and will be joining us in overdrive next hour. The incredible information absolutely
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:52.280]  over the top ladies and gentlemen that the new official civil unrest army manual has been declassified.
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:59.480]  It was written two years ago. They released it two days ago and Paul Watson has an article
[02:09:59.480 --> 02:10:06.200]  detailing it coming out in less than an hour at infowars.com and the army goes further than ever
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:12.280]  and says we are preparing to use lethal force against nonviolent demonstrators
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:18.360]  and how to kill U.S. citizens. It's an update from the document two years ago. It's the same
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:23.480]  document. They just updated. It's the manual where they talk about processing our social
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:30.840]  security numbers into the emergency centers establishment act. This is it. Now remember
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:35.080]  the real training 90 plus percent of it is for gun owners veterans tea party
[02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:41.000]  and the justice department says white people are number one threat. I mean so racial imagine
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:46.280]  if they said black people are the threat. So separately they're getting ready to target gun
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:51.960]  owners conservatives libertarians Christians gun owners whatever. We harp on that. We're the folks
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:56.440]  that expose it. We're the experts. I only tell you that because we are the experts. I am the expert
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:02.440]  on this. OK. I learned about this 18 years ago because of insiders. I've been on ever since
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:06.920]  we know what we're talking about. It's coming to a head. This is the time to be praying ladies and
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:12.840]  gentlemen because they want to start a civil war in this country between gun owners and the police
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:19.560]  the military. If that happens a lot of police and military say well I won't be part of that. I believe
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:25.880]  you. The problem is they're going to stage such horrendous terror attacks and blame it on domestic
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:32.360]  groups that it will be a shy op and I question your resolve. Look at Katrina and the gun confiscation
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:37.880]  under orders. Didn't go into the eighth ward or ninth ward where all the looting was going on.
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:43.000]  They went into the high and dry wealthy areas and took those guns and handcuffed those citizens
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:47.320]  and they never got them back. And when we were getting reports of it at the time from police
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:54.760]  officers that were listeners by name. Listers said that isn't true in 2005. You're lying Alex.
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:01.080]  It came out weeks later. All the guns will be taken. No one will be allowed to be armed.
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:08.520]  Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs just got back late last night from St. Louis, Missouri where he spent
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:15.240]  the last week in the combat zone and hit by the rubber bullet. Fresh off three weeks at the border
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:22.040]  and all the rest of the craziness down there. He's volunteering to turn right back around with
[02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:27.560]  a fresh group of reporters. Kit Daniels and Marcos Morales. Marcos is going right. He's able to go.
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:31.960]  They're turning around in an hour. They got to leave in 20 minutes. They're going on an airplane.
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:36.360]  They're going back. Fritz Springmer all give us his overall big picture view on this. Talk
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:42.600]  some about Robin Williams death and how many murders are going on in Hollywood. When a star
[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:47.720]  no longer can make money as a star, they make money as a dead star. Could he have been killed?
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:51.160]  We're going to be talking about that briefly already had him scheduled. He'll be back with us
[02:12:51.160 --> 02:12:55.960]  as soon as this crisis is over in the next few weeks for a full hour via video Skype. We
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:13:00.840]  sell his book. We're the only people that do sell it because we put it back in print. Bloodlines of
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:06.760]  the Illuminati, the size of a phone book, which I used to think half of it was nuts. So much of it
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:11.560]  after it was written 15 years ago has come true that it really is an important book to read. We
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:18.200]  have it infowarstore.com. Everything's 10% off by the way until tomorrow at infowarstore.com.
[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:22.120]  I should remind you we are listener supported. It's very expensive to send reporters up there.
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:25.880]  But Joe, I wanted to spend a few minutes with you before you turn around and leave.
[02:13:25.880 --> 02:13:32.200]  You're in studio with us. Man, you look. I mean, I saw you just a week and a half ago.
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:36.680]  You didn't look as jacked as you do right now. What's happened? Have you gotten back in combat
[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:41.560]  mode or something? Well, that I honestly, I think the super male vitality as well. I mean,
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:45.560]  I'll hop in all these fences with these MRAPs chasing me and lasers pointed my chest. It makes
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:50.920]  you get amped up. I mean, I'm telling you, I'm out there running lives are you streaming trying
[02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:53.560]  to get everything because the only way people in America are going to wake up to what's really
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:57.960]  going on and what can happen in their neighborhood is to actually see what's going on and not watch
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:02.200]  what CNN and Fox and all these guys are telling you from the roped off little sheet pens that
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:06.200]  they have. It's ridiculous. The only way that the Americans are actually see what's going to happen
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:11.320]  is if we continue to get out there on the front lines and watch both sides of this collapse.
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:16.360]  Well, it was thugs at first, then it was good people for a few days. Now the thugs have descended.
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:20.360]  I mean, that's what I see from the outside. Is that accurate? Yeah, Saturday was a whole
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:24.040]  different story. I was looking at you were there for the looting. Yes, I was like,
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:29.800]  this is not going to be good. The protestors started turning on a swat in the cameras at us.
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:34.120]  Josh got a surrounded one of the girls came out of the crowd and ran and try to push my
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:38.760]  uh, you stream feed out of the way because you're white just because I was recording, you know,
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:41.720]  because they just didn't want it. But it was funny because you're yelling for their their
[02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:44.920]  amendments. They want to be able to say what they want to say, but then they started swatting
[02:14:44.920 --> 02:14:48.760]  at our cameras and saying that we couldn't film. Well, I've been watching the fees. There's a lot
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:52.280]  of racist talk going on. Oh yeah, there's a lot of stuff. So before it was the locals saying we
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:56.520]  want our town back, you know, retired and hardworking black folks. It's kind of a retiree.
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:00.040]  It's what I've read. Is that accurate? Yeah. And now the thugs have showed up from St. Louis.
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:05.800]  Well, but I would say like around 637 o'clock at night, that's when the locals who live there,
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:09.640]  the families that actually work and have jobs and do everything, that's when they go to bed.
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:13.160]  They lock up like, I don't want any part of this. You can see them coming out and grabbing their kids
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:17.320]  off the street. Then it's the out of towners and people that come out doing donuts on the road,
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:21.240]  acting full screaming, driving up at the police, standing in front of the businesses,
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:25.640]  trying to protect them, throwing stuff and saying F the police, you know, we don't have to do anything
[02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:29.240]  what you guys say. You got guns, we got guns and they're sitting there with their mask on,
[02:15:29.240 --> 02:15:34.920]  jumping up and down. Does anybody have any idea what the globalists are doing?
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:40.040]  If this gets out of hand, then the military will crush them. That will start a larger race war.
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:44.120]  And then like Judo, they're going to flip it onto the Tea Party. Joe, you went to the secret
[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:48.600]  training bases. We've got the video of them training to intern blacks en masse. We've been
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:54.200]  warning people since July when we figured out the combo, the combination of what they were planning,
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:58.440]  the final pieces. Have we not accurately predicted exactly what was going to happen?
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:03.400]  Exactly. It's happening now. And like you said earlier, the police aren't even stopping the
[02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:08.120]  looting. They sit back and they allow it. They were letting these guys drive around the street
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:13.560]  recklessly, almost hitting crowds of people that were standing and praying. People hanging out the
[02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:17.960]  side of the vehicle with, you know, mass throwing up game signs, driving at crowds of people and
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:21.320]  the cops are just sitting there watching. And then they would leave the store.
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:25.000]  Well, the cops argument is we try to run them off and you get mad at us.
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:30.680]  Yeah. But the only time it ever gets violent, violent is when they just line up and they just
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:35.160]  start shooting into the crowd. Well, I was about to say, obviously the police should swarm out
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:39.720]  against criminals. Then they'd be cheered by the crowd, guard the First Amendment, protect the
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:45.000]  press, go after people doing bad. Then they'd be praised. But no, they've set up the training
[02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:49.880]  where it always goes bad like this. Yeah. I mean, you know, the one guy, we saw the one guy throw
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:54.280]  the bottle. Why not go get that one guy and then let the demonstration continue. What they did is
[02:16:54.280 --> 02:17:00.920]  they looked at one bottle, just be the flashpoint for everything. Sirens going off smokes, flashbangs,
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:04.520]  and then just attacking people, lining up, marching and shooting into a crowd.
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:08.600]  Well, I've also seen some black leaders say that only blacks are being shot out with rubber
[02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:13.720]  bullets. Is that true? Negative. Because I got shot. There was a white lady. She was a minister
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:18.920]  in the local town right there in Ferguson. She has a huge bruise. It takes up her whole stomach.
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:22.760]  I mean, it was worse than mine. I mean, hers was actually ripped a little bit.
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:26.760]  But you told me they were clearly targeting the press. Oh, definitely. That's the first
[02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:31.000]  time in my own country I've really felt threatened. Well, they've never targeted press during riots.
[02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.200]  The police have always wanted the press there to cover what really happened
[02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:37.800]  so they could show the rioters. But why in the world would they target you?
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:40.760]  Well, the scariest thing is when you hear them get on the radio and they say,
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:47.000]  turn off all recording equipment. That just blows my mind. And then the last, it was Saturday,
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:54.040]  they said, if you do not disperse the streets, we will arrest you and or by other means necessary.
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:59.560]  They added that on this time. So that's when the next following night, shootings and all that.
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:04.840]  So they're now quoting Malcolm X, the police as they attack people. I mean, that's what's so crazy
[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:10.520]  about this is it's the worst possible combination. Well, listen, get out of here. Great job. Everybody
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:15.240]  will be praying for each show. We really appreciate you. And last night I predicted I said today or
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:19.800]  the next day, the National Guard will be called. When I landed, I talked to do, I said, I guarantee
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:24.840]  you the National Guard will be in play. And sure enough, here we are today. Well, get out there
[02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:28.920]  about a night, but listen, I don't want you on the front lines anymore. You've done enough
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:33.480]  and get go by. I told him yesterday. I don't know if we had the time. I didn't mean to send you.
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:38.760]  You need to get expensive gas mask. And once I got worked fine, it's just your car didn't have his
[02:18:38.760 --> 02:18:46.200]  on his tight. Well, but your eyes, you need them with the goggles and I just don't want you guys
[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:52.120]  being heroes out there. All right. Just just stand back. All right. I don't have that. You're not
[02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:55.960]  allowed to get in trouble. Just come on. Go cover it from the periphery. I'm going to stay off to
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:19:00.120]  the side. That way I can see them converging on each other. The sides are fine. It's usually if
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:03.800]  you're just in the middle of the road right there. That's where everything's being shot to. If I get
[02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:07.640]  back like on some of the side businesses, like I was able to Saturday and kind of stay around the
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:12.280]  corner of the building and film out, I got good stuff. Now when the cops roll past you and you're
[02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:15.400]  doing that, are they doing anything to you now? They started pointing sniper rifles at me and me
[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:19.720]  and Jakari had to run. We were chased for a little while and then I had to run five miles
[02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:23.640]  out of the city of Ferguson, come back around in the pouring rain. Well, that's why it looks like
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:28.600]  you've lost 20 pounds. Yeah. There's been a lot of running. I was like, you walk in, I don't even
[02:19:28.600 --> 02:19:32.120]  recognize you. I mean, you weren't fat. You were a little chubby like me. Yeah. I mean, man,
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:40.440]  it's called the Ferguson Workout Secret. I feel like 10 years younger, bro. It's been good for
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:46.040]  you getting gas. You owe me for sending you. Pay me for the special work. I've been drinking like
[02:19:46.040 --> 02:19:51.320]  two bottles of water a day in like a granola bar. That's about it. All right, well, be safe. You
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:56.920]  guys, you know, force me with you. Viacandios, Joe Biggs, when I come back with our special guest,

[02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:11.560]  Well, you heard it from Joe Biggs. He's been there. A bunch of thugs came to town, just like the
[02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:16.440]  state police said, that are just attacking and burning and looting things and it's disgusting,
[02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:24.360]  almost running over prayer visuals. This is what the Democratic Party is promoting. Truly
[02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:31.240]  disgusting. Again, Fritz Springmeyer, author of this phone book-sized book in my hand,
[02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:40.840]  Bloodlines the Illuminati, available only at infowarstore.com, reads like a nightmare horror
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:46.040]  movie, but so much of it that he wrote about it here back in the mid-90s when this book came out,
[02:24:46.760 --> 02:24:54.760]  what, 96, 97, turned out to be true and came out in mainstream media. It is bizarre and I can't
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:59.960]  prove all of it, but a lot of it over the years has turned out to be accurate. Really amazing book
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:07.800]  available at infowarstore.com or by calling toll-free 888-2533139. I appreciate Fritz coming
[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:12.120]  in today to do this via Skype. Skype looks great. That's one reason I haven't had him on as much as
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:15.720]  his internet's been bad, but he looks like he's got a good internet. So Fritz, I want to invite
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:20.200]  you on to the nightly news the next few weeks and do a full hour in the near future with us
[02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:27.960]  here on the syndicated radio show. So we'll get that set up as soon as this Ferguson thing either
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:33.080]  escalates or downgrades. We're really trying to focus on this because it's part of a larger
[02:25:33.080 --> 02:25:39.080]  globalist plan. What is your gut watching this unfold? I mean, we have the evidence they are
[02:25:39.080 --> 02:25:46.280]  provocaturing this and preparing race war as a pretext for martial law. What's your view on that?
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:52.840]  Well, first I want to comment that you're on top of it and there's not a whole lot of
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:59.080]  information that I can give on the details of what's transpiring that you're not giving.
[02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:05.960]  You're doing a good job of covering it, but what I can do is give the larger context,
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:12.120]  because as you've been telling your audience, I did a lot of research on the Illuminati.
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:21.000]  This is a part of a program. There's programs and then there's sub-programs underneath that.
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:28.360]  At the top of the agenda is population reduction, but they're also trying to
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:36.760]  break up the United States, take us back down to where we're manageable, split us up.
[02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:43.720]  We're going to have order out of chaos, but first we've got to create the chaos. So two years ago
[02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:49.960]  when I was in studio with you, you were holding up and showing the audience my books on the
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:57.560]  trauma-based mind control. When I did work with the victims of this trauma-based mind control,
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:27:05.800]  I was trying to be a friend and a free therapist to them. I wasn't charging people for the help I
[02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:11.560]  gave and people came from around the world to my house to get assistance. One of the things that I
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:18.440]  discovered, and this wasn't only just something I discovered, but some other Christian ministers
[02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:24.120]  that were also working with victims of trauma-based mind control also discovered this, is that all
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:32.520]  of these people have programming for this period of chaos, Armageddon programming, where the elite
[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:38.520]  of the world, we're going to create Armageddon-type scenarios where we have these plagues, where we
[02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:47.480]  have these riots, we have this chaos, we have a financial crisis. Christine Lagarde, who's head
[02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:53.320]  of the IMF, she's been talking about, we need a global reset, structural reforms, there's all these
[02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:59.160]  financial... Rand Corporation says that global wars needed to save the New World Order. It's
[02:27:59.160 --> 02:28:05.160]  chaos psychology, where you bring in the chaos to then get the public to beg for the solution.
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:12.040]  Exactly, and they're going to have people asking for, you know, we got this Ebola scare,
[02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:19.080]  and now Monsanto's going to make billions of dollars off of, you know, they create a problem,
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:25.240]  then they give the solution, and they make money through the whole Hegelian dialectic process.
[02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:36.520]  So, you know, the Department of Agriculture, Vilsack, was Monsanto, and Monsanto even gave
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:44.600]  him a jet to travel around as he was governor. So, we've got these Illuminati members salted in
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:50.520]  in our government, you know, John Kerry, who is Department of State, Skoll and Bones, Skoll and
[02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:57.400]  Bones set up as a branch of the Bavarian Illuminati, which was a branch of the Illuminati in general.
[02:28:57.400 --> 02:29:04.760]  So, we got all these members, you've probably been watching this too, you know, how so many members
[02:29:04.760 --> 02:29:10.120]  in the president's cabinet will be council on foreign relations, which was Illuminati controlled
[02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:17.880]  organization. So, they've put their people in, they've programmed people all through all levels
[02:29:17.880 --> 02:29:24.840]  of society. So, what we see happening at Ferguson, some of those people that are on both sides of
[02:29:24.840 --> 02:29:29.880]  the issue, some of the police, some of the demonstrators, some of these people coming from
[02:29:29.880 --> 02:29:36.040]  St. Louis to cause problems, these people have been programmed to do this. This is actually pretty
[02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:42.680]  intense, sophisticated mind control. One of the things that I discovered in working with these
[02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:47.880]  Illuminati victims of mind control is even the people that supposedly on all sides- Hold on,
[02:29:47.880 --> 02:29:51.640]  I want to hear this, stay there, and then the phone calls are coming up. The empires will be
[02:29:51.640 --> 02:29:55.480]  on a whole hour next week, just setting up next week guys, third hour. We're gonna come back,
[02:29:55.480 --> 02:30:02.520]  then I promise I'll go to Tom, Alex, Chris, John, and others. City of Austin tap water versus filtered
[02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:07.080]  City of Austin tap water. I didn't, I taste dirt in it. God knows what's in this. These people
[02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:12.200]  just sampled City of Austin tap water straight from the faucet. Next, we had them try a sample
[02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:18.040]  of tap water filtered through the Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system. Now one is better. Tastes
[02:30:18.040 --> 02:30:22.440]  like nothing. Yep, I know what good water tastes like, it's good water. Most tap water contains
[02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:28.040]  added substances like fluoride, fluorine, glyphosate, and many others. Studies prove that these
[02:30:28.040 --> 02:30:32.200]  substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues including tooth decay,
[02:30:32.200 --> 02:30:35.960]  lower in IQ, and even cancer. It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're
[02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:42.280]  drinking tap water. The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances leaving
[02:30:42.280 --> 02:30:47.080]  only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water. Okay, this is very tasty. It's good water,

[02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:34.040]  and when i do the bad guy loves the second amendment in george washington
[02:34:34.040 --> 02:34:41.880]  that's brainwashing earlier this year in january the pentagon came out and said we're
[02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:45.640]  going to stop lying because of matt drudge so to stop lying we're going to engage in
[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:50.600]  psyops domestically and they changed the law so they could that's the lie we're going to stop lying
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:58.840]  by openly lying and the military itself is more psyop than anybody that's why the military
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:03.080]  is the most awake group out there all we've got to be careful about alienating them because they're
[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:08.280]  the people that aren't ignorant like the public and do know they've been training for gun confiscation
[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:11.960]  and do know all this is happening we're going to go to your calls and give you the floor and move
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:16.360]  quickly to the next person so that folks holding for an hour because a guest came on after fritz
[02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:22.600]  leaves us here in a moment i'm going to go into overdrive with the joe rogan and more
[02:35:24.120 --> 02:35:27.640]  but fritz you're going to the nightly news tomorrow night with 30 minutes next week on
[02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:32.440]  the radio for an hour a lot of time people in news obviously move a guest if it's not on topic
[02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:37.160]  you are on topic it's important i want to delve into these documents and discuss it but
[02:35:37.160 --> 02:35:43.480]  the culture itself is brainwashing the fluoride in the water to lower iq and to make other drugs
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:49.880]  have a higher effect as an adjuvant that's pharma key of mind control putting 25 million kids on
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:56.360]  ritalin another 60 million on prozac type drugs death education increasing suicides we're in a
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:36:01.880]  mind control culture where the president says two plus two equals five and if you built a business
[02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:07.320]  you didn't build it i mean aren't we already basting and just general mind control fritz
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:13.720]  springmeyer author of bloodlines the illuminati yes exactly and i wanted to finish my thought
[02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:19.640]  just when we took break and that was uh in in a place like ferguson what they have done is
[02:36:20.200 --> 02:36:25.800]  and this is going to happen repeatedly in the united states when you have these riots and stuff
[02:36:25.800 --> 02:36:31.240]  they have actually programmed people with this trauma-based mind control to become leaders
[02:36:31.240 --> 02:36:37.880]  of the rioters they're people that have been taken and trained part of their certain parts of their
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:43.320]  minds alters that you can see the type of programming i'm talking about if you watch this
[02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:52.600]  charles bronson movie telephone and and so these people can be triggered and uh then they will
[02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:59.640]  become they will go into their leadership mode where you have a crowd and they will take
[02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:05.640]  uh control of the crowd so that's a little scary because if you're somebody who's sincerely
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:12.440]  protesting the next thing you know you'll be caught up in a movement that's controlled by
[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:17.880]  the elite and you won't even know it the the people that are taking control of the crowd as well
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:25.560]  as the police you've got this this controlled chaos and so uh yeah we're we're looking at some
[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:31.560]  um serious things coming down the pike you've been warning people you've been talking about how our
[02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:39.480]  government is is ready for the financial crisis and and chaos how they've stocked up on on the
[02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:47.000]  weapons and um so you're you're on top of it and i appreciate that you're warning people um this is
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:54.600]  definitely uh um things that are on the illuminati agenda and then the long-range plans like i'm
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:38:03.560]  talking about are uh to take us down to population reduction so you can you can rest assured that
[02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:11.000]  after they stress us out with um a number of things like a financial crisis then they uh
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:18.760]  you know and the american dollar will be dethroned as a world reserve currency then we will we will
[02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:27.240]  see uh the plagues come in i think that this is um just uh save uh this is just scaring people
[02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:33.080]  right now with the Ebola thing i i i'm concerned i agree they're just getting everything in place
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:40.040]  the compartmentalization the preparation while deindustrializing posing as the saviors uh
[02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:44.600]  and again the average copper military or bureaucrat doesn't even know that's how the i mean the
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:49.640]  globalists all have written that in public books tragedy and hope uh brzezinski's books
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:54.920]  ecoscience literally hundreds of books they've written men in power is a political retrospective
[02:38:54.920 --> 02:39:00.280]  written by the german chancellor helmut schmidt all admitting how they do this that's what's so
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:07.880]  crazy is so much of it is admitted and now they're just selling everyone on the idea of authoritarian
[02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:13.240]  control for security but really the authoritarian controls coming in to take out their real enemy
[02:39:13.240 --> 02:39:20.040]  any wealthy or middle class folks that aren't part of the system right they're solidifying
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:29.880]  their control as if they need more control well fritz i gotta say you are on fire today

[02:40:56.280 --> 02:41:00.360]  sold out isn't it that's why it's on the site now so when i tell you something's selling out folks
[02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:10.440]  i'm not making it up that's infowarslife.com 10 off everything books videos infowars.com camo hats
[02:41:12.280 --> 02:41:18.600]  nickel and brass patriot belt buckles a bunch of those have sold out now we've got a few of the

[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:40.840]  crisis point yet all of this is to maneuver us into that position the survival mega seed volts
[02:41:40.840 --> 02:41:48.680]  best price non-gmo super high quality at prices no one else can top 10 off with promo code
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:56.440]  1 0 at checkout applies a blanket 10 off your entire order we already had the lowest price
[02:41:56.440 --> 02:42:01.160]  on almost everything or very competitive you know we signed agreements and stuff that we
[02:42:01.160 --> 02:42:05.000]  can't even sell stuff or even lower because that drives down the whole market of some of the stuff
[02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:10.600]  we carry the best stuff well i can do 10 off the whole blanket at checkout i guess there is they
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:16.840]  told me silver bullet was sold out but i do see it up there that's confusing the point is infowars
[02:42:16.840 --> 02:42:27.560]  life.com infowarsstore.com 8882533139 and whatever you do spread the word about the broadcast
[02:42:28.760 --> 02:42:32.840]  spread the word about your local m&f and affiliates and support those local sponsors
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:37.080]  or become a sponsor in ass stations that are carrying us on the weekend to carry us during the
[02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:40.920]  week or if they're carrying us at night tell them carry us during the day that's what happens with
[02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:45.560]  almost every affiliate they carry us on the weekend with a live sunday show then they pick us up
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:50.760]  weeknights then they carry us live and that's what happens because people are hungry for the truth and
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:57.400]  look i'm here trying to cover the sensational nature of reality to get people out of their comfort
[02:42:57.400 --> 02:43:03.960]  zone to get them out of their trance so they see how serious things are so we get past the normalcy
[02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:09.400]  bias and people get upset we can turn back the tide obama opening the borders without even an
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:15.000]  executive order an executive order would be treason just doing it putting our military
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:21.560]  under u n control and nato running all these scams fast and furious shutting down our power plants
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:29.240]  common core looting the treasury with banker bailouts i mean it is just it's insane we have a chance
[02:43:29.240 --> 02:43:35.160]  to turn it around if we decide we can if we decide to get involved and quit only caring about football
[02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:41.400]  or or dancing with the stars anybody who watches cop shows where every episode a gun owner is going
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:46.040]  to mass murder people or a veteran is going to mass murder i mean none of that's really happening
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:50.920]  statistically conservatives and libertarians have the lowest crime rate look it up the justice
[02:43:50.920 --> 02:44:02.280]  department's own numbers constitutionalist the lowest crime rate i mean you start researching
[02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:07.320]  patriots we are like the most law-abiding good people what does the government do oh they're the
[02:44:07.320 --> 02:44:11.720]  bubbles they're going to rebel well of course you try to take our guns or stick us in a femacamp
[02:44:11.720 --> 02:44:15.720]  yeah we're not going to go loot stores and throw them all off cocktails you know what's going to
[02:44:15.720 --> 02:44:21.560]  happen and the globalists want to execute the military and the police running that operation
[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:26.600]  and i keep telling people this hidden a game okay i'm going to shut up now tom in new york
[02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:30.520]  you've been holding since earlier you made some points finished in one minute right now i got to
[02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:35.400]  get to chris and john and alex and brian and others go ahead you got it you're getting your
[02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:39.960]  edge back but that's exactly it this whole needs to stop so that everybody stops being played pawns
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:45.960]  in this the corral everybody into what you're talking about i'm begging the st louis county
[02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:52.120]  corner medical examiner's office as well as a forensic text out there come forward with
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:57.160]  the evidence you have you know whether there was an altercation that happened inside that vehicle
[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:02.520]  whether or not michael brown was shot in a running forward position they know exactly what went on
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:06.920]  that triggered this whole event i'm begging them to come forward despite the fact that the feds have
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:15.320]  now taken over the autopsy and explain why that's important why that's important is because this
[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:20.200]  whole thing was triggered by what was believed to be the execution of an unarmed man by a member
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:27.640]  of law enforcement once that truth comes out as to what the reality was that set this off
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:33.560]  the whole jiggle be up the feds organize chaos to play everybody as pawns against each other to
[02:45:33.560 --> 02:45:40.440]  bring in martial law as you continually hammer on every day again that operation can be destroyed
[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:45.640]  pushed by the wayside it will not stop them completely but at least we can move past this
[02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:50.760]  one point of chaos where this thing explodes that's a great point how to get past the point of chaos
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:55.480]  thank you so much because i just want to have a country i want to have stability i don't want
[02:45:55.480 --> 02:46:01.080]  to have a civil war you got a bunch of idiot thugs trying to get one going not the police
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:07.160]  shooting reporters for no reason it's just a disaster it why aren't they releasing it because
[02:46:07.160 --> 02:46:13.800]  a lot of witnesses are confirming what the police said now black witnesses so why aren't they releasing
[02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:21.240]  it the whole thing's very suspicious and again people like well it's one dead guy out of all
[02:46:21.240 --> 02:46:25.320]  the other stuff happening why is it such a big deal because the media is making it a big deal
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:29.240]  chris in vegas former police officer your take on the situation thanks for holding
[02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:38.040]  christ you're still there come back to him and see if he's there alex in minnesota former army
[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:43.560]  what is your take on this hey alex i just want to talk a little bit about how us just sit back
[02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:48.760]  and look at this situation it just reminds me of the first of a war how missouri is involved
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:54.120]  again and i'm a student of history i just find it ironic that the same players are involved
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:58.200]  involved again and i think we should all just sit back and look at what's going on
[02:46:58.200 --> 02:47:02.200]  and then the second point is i think we have a problem with the bully culture and it's just
[02:47:02.200 --> 02:47:07.160]  everywhere now you know i was thinking that the other day in the car listening to talk radio
[02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:14.920]  about the thug uh knockout game culture about redneck groups acting like thugs
[02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:21.240]  the police doing that you either have a bully culture or you don't and you're right it's bully
[02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:27.640]  culture it's men that think it's tough to get in groups and then mess with people that aren't
[02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:32.600]  doing anything and if you look at the thugs running around bullying our reporters and they
[02:47:32.600 --> 02:47:39.640]  were doing that the last three days now they mirror the police it's like the thugs and the cops
[02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:47.240]  are acting like the same thing is that what you're getting at alex yeah definitely what i see is
[02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:53.640]  is um whether it was we see mike brown in the video was being a bully uh whether the police
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:57.320]  they were being bullies with him but definitely the police were being bullied with bullies with
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:48:02.840]  the protesters and like you said the protesters being bullies against you guys it's just a pervasive
[02:48:02.840 --> 02:48:08.840]  thing i think what's wrong with our country is uh our value on human dignity human dignity
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:15.720]  and we don't value life anymore that's right started out with 53 million babies getting killed
[02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:21.640]  in the last 40 years people say bad stuff can never come here it has come here people say oh it
[02:48:21.640 --> 02:48:26.680]  can never happen here it did happen here and now it's getting worse great points alex great call
[02:48:27.880 --> 02:48:33.320]  is chris back from vegas let's check that okay chris uh former police what's your view on this
[02:48:34.440 --> 02:48:41.000]  well i'm calling from fringin region zone nine on a truth giad on info wars thank you very much alex
[02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:45.560]  well thanks for calling chris what do you think's going on well you're exactly right this is a mass
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:53.560]  syops operation using the hog galley and dialectic problem reaction solution and they're trying to
[02:48:53.560 --> 02:49:01.640]  divide and conquer creating a false paradigm of race-based division using the uh black groups
[02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:08.680]  versus the white groups the white police of furgusson in the state against the new black
[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:16.920]  panthers brought in by the department of justice as their local crisis management uh observers
[02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:23.480]  this is classic sun sue arts of war that you're seeing here absolutely
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:33.240]  where do you see it going well what i really see is on gateway pundit they had uh a map
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:39.000]  furgusson's house and several different uh media units from the lamestream media had published
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:46.360]  critical details and uh done production showing exactly where darin wilson lives it's my contention
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:52.200]  that what they will do is a chris donner sort of thing there will be some sort of illusion of a
[02:49:52.760 --> 02:49:58.200]  takeout of darin wilson to diffuse the issue he'll be put into the witness for a protection
[02:49:58.200 --> 02:50:04.440]  program and rotated to some other remote jurisdiction or given a plush retirement to keep quiet forever
[02:50:05.080 --> 02:50:09.480]  and made to disappear like they do here in los vegas and other locations when they get caught
[02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:14.920]  doing criminal things that makes a large you are correct that's singing in and others are

[02:55:02.120 --> 02:55:07.800]  military to go along with this the destabilization will be real though just like is killing people
[02:55:07.800 --> 02:55:13.800]  is real it's just the globalists funded them protected them turned them loose the furguson
[02:55:13.800 --> 02:55:19.960]  family has now come out and said that their son was murdered and they've got this medical examiner
[02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:27.880]  come in from town uh celebrity medical examiner saying it was an execution obviously to to stir
[02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:34.600]  all this up a lot more this is going from bad to worse by the minute and don't worry the globalists
[02:55:34.600 --> 02:55:39.720]  will have other tricks up their sleeves to destabilize chris other points where do you see all this
[02:55:39.720 --> 02:55:44.920]  going and you were getting uh to seven two seven seven and the plans were complete in total disarmament
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:51.960]  the u.s by an esco and the u.n under treaty 1961 and the plan to use civil unrest to do it
[02:55:52.920 --> 02:55:58.280]  well absolutely in fact pritz was speaking of the same thing but by and to the illuminati
[02:55:58.280 --> 02:56:05.400]  that ten united states code 2358 the strong thermonational defense act of 1961 was actually
[02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:11.640]  prescott bush uh tim plate and of course its progeny is the national defense authorization
[02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:17.480]  act are likely in the truth community call it the kill the patriot act and i think what you're
[02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:22.920]  seeing here is what we talked about the last time i was on the asymmetrical form of war this is a
[02:56:22.920 --> 02:56:29.320]  form of war against the american people it is a slow boiling throg style of it where they
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:35.320]  implicated by incrementalism and this is exactly what we're seeing and if they can stir up a
[02:56:35.320 --> 02:56:41.080]  confrontation even if they have to put provocateurs in the off in the audience like they did last
[02:56:41.080 --> 02:56:47.880]  night with a protesting crowd to fire shots on the police to provide the stimulus to provoke
[02:56:47.880 --> 02:56:55.320]  the police reaction they seek to uh elicit then doesn't matter whether it's the protesters do it
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:59.560]  or the provocateurs do it they'll still have the same result they're looking for to create an
[02:56:59.560 --> 02:57:06.280]  effectual war on the streets of st louis we're going to find out the national guard is showing up
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:11.400]  there with heavy armored vehicles and we're going to have reporters there all i know is the national
[02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:17.880]  guard better not target my reporters uh i wonder how they got the police to target innocent reporters
[02:57:17.880 --> 02:57:22.600]  on the news i mean is that meant to demonize the police why would they follow those orders
[02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:29.800]  because your truth-based news reporting has put the sunshine of light on these global
[02:57:29.800 --> 02:57:35.560]  terrorists in the white house the department of justice eric holder the scheister for the pretend
[02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:44.760]  to potis rock hussein obama and his criminal cabal that is perpetrating this devious form
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:49.800]  of revolutionary takeover of this country under the guise of protecting the public
[02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:54.920]  from all these terrorists well the military that i talked to gets it a lot of the police are starting
[02:57:54.920 --> 02:58:01.640]  to get it i just i just can't see from a catbird seat the mountain of catbird seat really how the
[02:58:01.640 --> 02:58:07.400]  game's going but uh if we end up losing to this i don't i don't know what to say because we know
[02:58:07.400 --> 02:58:12.600]  their game plan it's just can people realize that we know what we're talking about or will we allow
[02:58:12.600 --> 02:58:17.880]  the globalists to win with cloward and pevin with this destabilization program what do you think
[02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:23.960]  i think we have one player alex and that's if a large element of the military is awake enough to
[02:58:23.960 --> 02:58:28.920]  know what's going on if they're being used as pawns in this global game i agree but what do
[02:58:28.920 --> 02:58:33.000]  they do when 10 000 people are trying to shoot them or burn them it just the fight happens

[03:01:15.640 --> 03:01:22.200]  doesn't even have an idea what's going on when this is so serious paul watson's article just went
[03:01:22.200 --> 03:01:26.600]  live we'll put it on screen he's joining us in the next segment john in texas thanks for holding
[03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:33.000]  you're on the air hi alex go ahead we're up in the 1960s alex i was in high school when all these
[03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:37.960]  riots broke out in the 60s and in fact i lived the hour outside of detroit when the detroit riot
[03:01:37.960 --> 03:01:43.320]  broke out and one of the things that we got out of those riots of the 1960s with a 1968 gun control
[03:01:43.320 --> 03:01:48.120]  act and one of the things they used to push it was the black revolutionaries were easily able to
[03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:52.040]  order guns through the mail and stuff and that was one of the selling points that's how they passed
[03:01:52.040 --> 03:02:00.120]  the 68 gun control act and i'm seeing the same people back then that were working to start the
[03:02:00.120 --> 03:02:05.480]  riot the commonest revolutionaries funded by the taxes and foundations they're the same people
[03:02:05.480 --> 03:02:09.160]  that's probably in Ferguson they're probably were working in other cities right now trying to get
[03:02:09.160 --> 03:02:14.040]  things riled up as it is as we speak now that's right we need to show how black riots were used
[03:02:14.040 --> 03:02:19.640]  in the 60s to restrict the second amendment and you better believe that's the game plan now
[03:02:19.640 --> 03:02:23.960]  and the and you won't hear any conservative media talking about the government and the
[03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:30.760]  ford foundation and the justice department only drudge dare link to our article proving d o j and
[03:02:30.760 --> 03:02:37.480]  communist are working with new black panthers to hijack ferguson protest only drudge will tell
[03:02:37.480 --> 03:02:44.120]  people that other than info wars dot com and this is totally scripted it makes me want to throw up
[03:02:46.520 --> 03:02:51.080]  yeah so if riots break out another city that likes we know we know who's responsible for it
[03:02:51.080 --> 03:02:54.840]  who's behind it and what's going to come out is more more gun control more restrictions
[03:02:57.720 --> 03:03:02.440]  absolutely i appreciate your call god bless you by the way paul has his headline out the
[03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:08.760]  headline's not hardcore enough he's listening right now document army preparing to use lethal force
[03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:15.160]  against unarmed americans during full-scale riots in the u.s that is super hardcore but i can't think
[03:03:15.160 --> 03:03:22.600]  of something as super hardcore as the document itself civil disturbances april 2014 released
[03:03:22.600 --> 03:03:28.680]  two days ago our listeners just sent it to us today approved for public release distribution
[03:03:28.680 --> 03:03:35.000]  is unlimited headquarters department of the army and it's how to process your social security numbers
[03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:40.120]  were to shoot americans who were unarmed how to terrorize the public by killing the citizens
[03:03:40.840 --> 03:03:46.040]  and then you wonder why the police following this manual that's what you got to do courses on this
[03:03:46.040 --> 03:03:52.840]  to get the armored vehicles then you wonder why they fired an unarmed reporters it's to terrorize
[03:03:52.840 --> 03:03:58.440]  the public which actually they're lying to them it only makes the public get more mad this is so
[03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:05.320]  diabolical we're going to get to tom in missouri uh as well during the interview with paul watson
[03:04:05.320 --> 03:04:11.000]  i'm going to try to focus when we go to break come back and get into all this we need to red link

[03:08:31.720 --> 03:08:41.320]  of the army released at army dot mill two days ago approved for public release last friday released
[03:08:41.320 --> 03:08:51.400]  on saturday it details the use of lethal force was snipers of unarmed americans during full scale
[03:08:51.400 --> 03:08:58.600]  riots in the united states now i've known for a long time they're training in what they call zombie
[03:08:58.600 --> 03:09:04.680]  wave attack the public would get video of the army and marines training to mow down mainly
[03:09:04.680 --> 03:09:10.920]  rural people in john deere caps cowboy cats overalls you name it we've been covering this for years
[03:09:10.920 --> 03:09:17.320]  we've got video of it mowing down peaceful protesters and drills i made films like police
[03:09:17.320 --> 03:09:22.600]  state 2000 on the subject so the last four or five years they call it zombie attack training
[03:09:22.600 --> 03:09:28.840]  you can look up army trains to take on zombies marines train to take on zombies and so they
[03:09:28.840 --> 03:09:33.880]  just put some you know green paint on them or whatever and have them act like zombies and
[03:09:33.880 --> 03:09:40.760]  claim it's all a joke when really they're desensitizing and dehumanizing us to the military
[03:09:40.760 --> 03:09:48.520]  and practicing to mow down masses of people and the larger zombie meme has been used to sell this
[03:09:48.520 --> 03:09:56.680]  idea then on july 17th we did a special 29 minute report and an article detailing how the military
[03:09:56.680 --> 03:10:06.520]  was going to prime the pump with staged race war between blacks and whites for the civil unrest
[03:10:06.520 --> 03:10:13.480]  as a pretext to roll martial law out with a cover story while the real internal training
[03:10:14.920 --> 03:10:20.440]  that's going on is to go after american gun owners just like that claim is for people in the
[03:10:20.440 --> 03:10:27.560]  eighth or ninth ward who are looting in katrina really it's the high and dry areas gun confiscations
[03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:35.480]  so we understand this program and we're showing the articles on screen for tv viewers radio
[03:10:35.480 --> 03:10:45.400]  listeners look them up for yourself back in july we detailed the same army manual now it's been
[03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:52.760]  updated the story is on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com we need you to get out to
[03:10:52.760 --> 03:10:58.920]  everybody you know paul watson i want to give you the floor to calmly walk through all of this
[03:10:58.920 --> 03:11:06.760]  in the segment we have right now because again a new listener a new viewer just thinks hey you
[03:11:06.760 --> 03:11:11.800]  got people about to riot you got looting going on they got to maintain order the armored vehicles
[03:11:11.800 --> 03:11:16.840]  have already been delivered the army practice taken over all of st louis two years ago with regular
[03:11:16.840 --> 03:11:24.040]  army they began to announce their national stabilization force north com this is scripted
[03:11:24.040 --> 03:11:29.320]  it to get the military the police and the public to go along with it to set the precedent
[03:11:31.080 --> 03:11:38.920]  fighting with a bunch of al sharpton justice department run provocateurs it's a simulated battle
[03:11:40.200 --> 03:11:46.920]  it'll be real thugs getting shot useful idiots with the police to set the precedent for wider
[03:11:46.920 --> 03:11:51.480]  martial law paul watson a do you concur with that analysis b let's get into your news article
[03:11:51.480 --> 03:11:56.360]  i do alex and that's what i've been saying for years and that's what i said on
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:12:02.680]  thursday i believe it was when i put out a video saying that ferguson was a trial balloon for this
[03:12:02.680 --> 03:12:07.720]  wider crackdown that they've been planning which is why the the militarization the tactics that
[03:12:07.720 --> 03:12:13.800]  they used are designed to inflame the tensions because they've been preparing for and fostering
[03:12:13.800 --> 03:12:20.840]  these riots for years and this is a new document out the us army called civil disturbances it was
[03:12:20.840 --> 03:12:27.960]  released it was written in april 2014 released recently approved for public release distribution
[03:12:27.960 --> 03:12:32.840]  is unlimited so whereas you know before we had to wait at least a couple years until we saw this
[03:12:32.840 --> 03:12:40.040]  kind of stuff now we've got it within four months it's basically a training manual for how the us
[03:12:40.040 --> 03:12:49.400]  army will deal with domestic disturbances and crowd control and civil unrest within the united
[03:12:49.400 --> 03:12:55.480]  states again within conus the continental united states the most shocking aspect of it as you've
[03:12:55.480 --> 03:13:02.600]  mentioned is a section entitled lethal response which outlines how they would deal with quote
[03:13:02.600 --> 03:13:09.720]  crowd control of quote unarmed civilians and the primary method of dealing with that according
[03:13:09.720 --> 03:13:17.480]  to the us army's own document ensure that target leaders or troublemakers are targeted exploit
[03:13:17.480 --> 03:13:25.640]  the psychological effect of an attack this attack is a quote sniper response directed against unarmed
[03:13:25.640 --> 03:13:33.720]  civilians then under a separate heading entitled small arms direct fire they stay escalate gradually
[03:13:33.720 --> 03:13:38.920]  starting with a small caliber single round and work up to a large caliber automatic so they're
[03:13:38.920 --> 03:13:44.040]  talking about shooting unarmed civilians it's important to stress that they have a you know this
[03:13:44.040 --> 03:13:49.720]  is a 132 page document they've got a whole graduated response build up to this they're not
[03:13:49.720 --> 03:13:55.640]  going to just show up and start shooting people but this is the ultimate if the stuff hits the
[03:13:55.640 --> 03:14:00.760]  fan this is what they're being directed to do sniper response against unarmed civilians
[03:14:01.800 --> 03:14:09.400]  then another chart called escalation of trauma chart figure three to four this outlines how
[03:14:09.400 --> 03:14:17.320]  they would deal with people using riot batons and they've got three levels of trauma gray white
[03:14:17.320 --> 03:14:24.280]  and patterned gray the final one is quote deadly force final target areas so this is where they
[03:14:24.280 --> 03:14:31.320]  would whack people with a riot baton in order to cause the necessary injuries to incapacitate
[03:14:31.320 --> 03:14:38.760]  the target and cause quote serious bodily injury shock or death again it's a graduated response
[03:14:38.760 --> 03:14:43.480]  they're not going to start doing this immediately but this this is the beal and end all for dealing
[03:14:43.480 --> 03:14:48.600]  with unruly crowds and they go through the different areas of the body which could cause death if
[03:14:48.600 --> 03:14:55.960]  somebody's whacked on the head with a a riot baton you know back of the next spine head and solar
[03:14:55.960 --> 03:15:03.480]  plexus so they've got actual charts directing us troops on how to take out americans within the
[03:15:03.480 --> 03:15:09.240]  continental united states and as you mentioned before it's in line with previous military
[03:15:09.240 --> 03:15:15.880]  documents which say the same thing they talk about using lethal force to deal with unruly
[03:15:15.880 --> 03:15:20.920]  crowds within the united states and i want to explain they have engineered the deindustrialization
[03:15:20.920 --> 03:15:25.880]  the power prices increasing the food prices increasing the collapse just like the engineered
[03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:31.240]  the arab spring we told people that a year before it happened google released the info that they
[03:15:31.240 --> 03:15:38.680]  organized it in watford england and so they are using their computer systems to war game this
[03:15:39.560 --> 03:15:46.600]  and all of humanity is under attack so they are orchestrating the foundation run new black panthers
[03:15:46.600 --> 03:15:54.120]  and the al sharp and fbi informants and others to go stir stuff up then cause the clash so they
[03:15:54.120 --> 03:16:04.680]  can sell this idea but remember behind the scenes 24 7 the main training is to take on gun owners
[03:16:06.040 --> 03:16:12.280]  so once they're done crushing the inner city people and and using the welfare riots that are
[03:16:12.280 --> 03:16:17.640]  coming as the pretext they will then go after everybody else including the police and their
[03:16:17.640 --> 03:16:23.320]  pensions this is the end of freedom in america none of this should be going along with this this
[03:16:23.320 --> 03:16:28.280]  is the coming out of the nsa the coming out of the cell phone kill switches the coming out of the
[03:16:28.280 --> 03:16:34.520]  surveillance the coming out of the m reps and the sound cannons right as they all get delivered
[03:16:34.520 --> 03:16:40.520]  and right as the saint louis police and others were told get ready for marshal law in the last
[03:16:40.520 --> 03:16:46.040]  few months paul we've seen a flurry of activity getting ready for this and then right on time
[03:16:46.040 --> 03:16:51.960]  this starts this and then now the family is out here with this quote celebrity medical examiner
[03:16:51.960 --> 03:16:56.280]  stirring it up saying he was executed and i've looked at it there's no evidence of that
[03:16:58.200 --> 03:17:02.840]  this this this is bad news and then a lot of dumb down people go why are you for the cops
[03:17:02.840 --> 03:17:08.200]  don't you want to have a burn everything down this will destroy everybody this is so stupid
[03:17:08.200 --> 03:17:13.080]  but i tell you americans have killed 53 million babies and said they weren't human so maybe we
[03:17:13.080 --> 03:17:18.120]  just deserve to live under this i mean it's just if the public is so stupid and the police are
[03:17:18.120 --> 03:17:23.000]  dumb enough to shoot at reporters for no reason maybe maybe this is a country that's just done paul
[03:17:23.560 --> 03:17:27.880]  i mean i know the riots in your country they allowed them to go on and provocateur a bunch
[03:17:27.880 --> 03:17:35.640]  of it and got caught to expand the police state this is sick paul paul watson well the key point
[03:17:35.640 --> 03:17:40.920]  that i emphasized was the fact that when the police were actually needed to deal with the looting
[03:17:41.480 --> 03:17:47.880]  both on the first night and on the friday night they were completely evil but they were out in
[03:17:47.880 --> 03:17:53.880]  force when it came to teargassing algae's era journalists and firing rubber bullets at peaceful
[03:17:53.880 --> 03:18:01.640]  protesters because remember after the first night of looting it was largely peaceful up until friday
[03:18:01.640 --> 03:18:06.520]  night remember i think it was on thursday night they had some of the police come out and walk with
[03:18:06.520 --> 03:18:11.880]  the demonstrators so then everybody's thinking oh this is de-escalating because they've actually
[03:18:11.880 --> 03:18:18.360]  followed some semblance of common sense and withdrew the militarized goon squads pointing snipers at
[03:18:18.360 --> 03:18:23.640]  people and this looks like it could be calming down then immediately the next night they're out
[03:18:23.640 --> 03:18:29.720]  they're back out in force again and again it goes back to that militarized police state tactic only
[03:18:29.720 --> 03:18:35.480]  inflames tensions it only encourages more violence from the crowd and from the other elements that
[03:18:35.480 --> 03:18:41.960]  have poured in like the new black panthers which of course the original black panthers have completely
[03:18:41.960 --> 03:18:47.400]  distanced themselves from this organization because it's proven to be militant radicalizing
[03:18:47.400 --> 03:18:54.600]  in some cases violent and this guy shabazz this new black panther leader was pictured working with
[03:18:55.160 --> 03:19:01.000]  the local police down there a couple of days ago which is quite odd because at the very same time
[03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:06.680]  the fbi put out a warning saying that the new black panthers were quote advocating violence
[03:19:06.680 --> 03:19:12.120]  against the police and yet here's the leader of them coordinating with the police you've got others
[03:19:12.120 --> 03:19:18.840]  writing incendiary messages on facebook then of course you've got a history of new black panthers
[03:19:18.840 --> 03:19:26.920]  being outed as federal informants like richard aoki who was outed as an fbi informant in 2012
[03:19:26.920 --> 03:19:32.760]  you've got communists down there who look like they're part of the violence throwing the molotov
[03:19:32.760 --> 03:19:38.520]  cocktails so as soon as those elements came in on friday night whereas before it was largely
[03:19:38.520 --> 03:19:44.760]  peaceful then we saw the violence which justified in the eyes of the authorities and the media
[03:19:44.760 --> 03:19:51.160]  the subsequent crackdown so it's a symbiotic relationship the militarized police state the
[03:19:51.160 --> 03:19:55.640]  dhs which of course is part of that with the contracts for the armored vehicles they only
[03:19:55.640 --> 03:20:01.080]  benefit from more violence and they they sure got it as soon as these rogue elements arrived
[03:20:01.080 --> 03:20:09.000]  on friday night well paul you have broken this down with absolute precision
[03:20:11.480 --> 03:20:14.760]  i'm gonna be back on the nightly news tonight trying to condense this down to three or four
[03:20:14.760 --> 03:20:21.000]  minutes so people have a short video they can send friends and family but if this if this video we
[03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:25.960]  put out from this live show is an hour long everyone should forward it to friends and family
[03:20:25.960 --> 03:20:32.200]  this is a premeditated takeover it's going to be made to look like it's just responding to
[03:20:32.200 --> 03:20:41.480]  current events it's not we have got to warn everybody now before it's too late and try
[03:20:41.480 --> 03:20:48.280]  to turn this around you're a smart guy watchin i respect your view on things i'm going to be
[03:20:48.280 --> 03:20:52.360]  thinking on the show ends here in a few minutes about what i can do to try to turn this around
[03:20:53.240 --> 03:20:59.320]  even if we can't turn it around it's our moral responsibility too do you have any idea in your
[03:20:59.320 --> 03:21:08.840]  gut on ways to diffuse this or stop it obviously reach out to the military and the police but
[03:21:08.840 --> 03:21:13.800]  they're going to be getting attacked by real people so how do you expect them not to respond
[03:21:13.800 --> 03:21:19.160]  and then you've got people and the police taking orders to escalate things attacking reporters
[03:21:19.160 --> 03:21:26.200]  arresting reporters and mcdonald's attacking our people you can see how the training itself
[03:21:26.840 --> 03:21:33.400]  is designed to escalate things so do you have any views on how we can turn this around
[03:21:35.640 --> 03:21:41.160]  i would encourage people to get behind a huge campaign which is embryonic in some cases but
[03:21:41.160 --> 03:21:45.960]  we've certainly seen it to completely defund and eventually abolish the department of homeland
[03:21:45.960 --> 03:21:52.040]  security because that's where these local police departments are getting the grants to buy the
[03:21:52.040 --> 03:21:58.360]  armored vehicles to buy the military style weapons that are the tools of this militarized police
[03:21:58.360 --> 03:22:05.000]  state so it's all emanating from the dhs which of course was put in place to fight terrorists
[03:22:05.000 --> 03:22:11.800]  back after 9 11 now it's harassing people with six carloads of dhs goons who go to somebody's house
[03:22:11.800 --> 03:22:18.120]  who owns a land rover which might or might not violate the epa's emission rules so it's an as
[03:22:18.120 --> 03:22:26.120]  you see the article about two girls fighting with uh paddles rowboat paddles in a front yard so dhs
[03:22:26.120 --> 03:22:32.680]  in an m-wrap showed up i mean this is getting wild and you just said it just like in katrina
[03:22:32.680 --> 03:22:38.520]  fema stood down cut police communications to make it as bad as possible to bring in the army and
[03:22:38.520 --> 03:22:45.640]  gun confiscate they got their funding roughly doubled for emergencies so now by making this as
[03:22:45.640 --> 03:22:52.120]  bad as possible they can come in as the saviors get even more funding and legitimize the m-wraps
[03:22:52.120 --> 03:22:57.640]  the helicopters the drones all of it which is really being prepared for the american people
[03:22:57.640 --> 03:23:03.880]  exactly and i mean a lot of people on the on the so-called rye conservatives just don't realize it
[03:23:03.880 --> 03:23:10.360]  they've been coddled into this belief that this is just a bunch of hoodlums which granted it's
[03:23:10.360 --> 03:23:14.840]  it's turning out to be that way because a lot a lot of them have descended on the scene as criminal
[03:23:14.840 --> 03:23:23.240]  opportunities but you know they had fps homeland security agents guarding tea party and anti irs
[03:23:23.240 --> 03:23:29.720]  rallies earlier this year so it's not just trained about against you know poor black people in these
[03:23:29.720 --> 03:23:37.080]  minority communities it's destined to be used against everyone so we need to protect everybody's
[03:23:37.080 --> 03:23:42.040]  constitutional rights and you know try and reach out to those military people in the cops and say
[03:23:42.040 --> 03:23:46.920]  that this is going to be directed against their families in the future and well a lot of them know
[03:23:46.920 --> 03:23:53.800]  well a lot of them know that poll but it's just incrementally rolled out the warrantless blood
[03:23:53.800 --> 03:24:00.600]  checkpoints the the helicopters the the surveillance looking through the walls the threat fusion centers
[03:24:00.600 --> 03:24:07.000]  all the illegal NSA surveillance the point is the bad guys run the top of the pyramid and so it doesn't
[03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:12.280]  matter how good the guys are at the bottom of the middle this country is being converted into an
[03:24:12.280 --> 03:24:19.080]  state and now the army would put in a public document that they're preparing to quote shoot
[03:24:19.080 --> 03:24:27.000]  peaceful people and to mow down crowds of peaceful people the headline should be army prepares to
