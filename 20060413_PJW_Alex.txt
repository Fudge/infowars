[00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:09.155]  In 30 minutes, we got Daniel Estelan joining us from Madrid, Spain for a report on the Bilderberg Group and what the global rulers are up to.
[00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:19.042]  Of course, one of their main plans is open borders, destroying national sovereignty, Pan-American Union, European Union, Asian Union, one world currency, one world tax.
[00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:21.103]  We'll get into all of it and the open border situation.
[00:00:21.764 --> 00:00:23.245]  Get his take on that.
[00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:25.707]  We will have open phones today as well.
[00:00:25.707 --> 00:00:30.170]  And then later in the third hour, I've got a guest who writes for a mainstream publication in Canada.
[00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.171]  He's only had two articles refused.
[00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:36.294]  One was on 9-11, the other on Charlie Sheen and 9-11.
[00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:37.876]  And they're just told, no, we don't run that.
[00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:42.159]  See, there is a blackout on positive pieces.
[00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.800]  No, we're not looking for positive pieces on that.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.942]  No, we only allow negative pieces.
[00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:49.684]  Or, no, we're not picking your story up.
[00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:53.102]  But that's why the mainstream media is in so much trouble.
[00:00:53.102 --> 00:00:55.823]  And then here are the other type of articles I have in front of me.
[00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:58.003]  I love this one that Paul Watson put out.
[00:00:58.003 --> 00:01:04.424]  White House claims no agenda to attack Iran, but Easter Bunny is real and not fictitious.
[00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:05.585]  That's really funny.
[00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:07.305]  And Paul wrote this one.
[00:01:07.305 --> 00:01:10.386]  Claims 7-7 bombers planned to drown tens of thousands.
[00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:14.106]  Group caught attempting to explode bomb under Thames River.
[00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:15.426]  Disappeared.
[00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:17.107]  Oh, government group.
[00:01:17.107 --> 00:01:18.327]  Just more proof of that.
[00:01:20.498 --> 00:01:22.820]  I mean, there's so much here.
[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.640]  There's so much here.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.641]  Also, Cheney got booed.
[00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:36.068]  The credibility of dissenting viewpoint, Cheney was booed when he threw the opening pitch at a baseball game and the media is trying to spin that.
[00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:40.710]  It's just an example of how unpopular these individuals are.
[00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.651]  Then I have stories here.
[00:01:42.478 --> 00:01:43.518]  This is the Times of London.
[00:01:43.518 --> 00:01:46.620]  Drug companies inventing diseases to boost their profits.
[00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.080]  Their own memos, their own documents are coming out.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.701]  We don't need memos and secret documents to know this.
[00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:55.483]  We can watch what they're doing and tell what their plan is.
[00:01:55.483 --> 00:02:01.425]  Then I have another one, Associated Press, where they're going to start ripping the teeth out of prisoners if you have gold.
[00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:06.347]  This is just Nazi behavior out in the open because, oh, you owe fines and fees.
[00:02:06.347 --> 00:02:07.687]  We're going to take your gold.
[00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.341]  Again, I've entered the ninth circle of hell.
[00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:15.122]  We have entered the twilight zone.
[00:02:15.122 --> 00:02:23.586]  We've got to give up all our rights because the terrorists are about to attack us, but there are millions of people running around saying we're taking America over with our media covering up what they're really saying and doing.
[00:02:23.586 --> 00:02:26.588]  Paul Watson, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:02:26.588 --> 00:02:28.589]  Good to be here, Alex.
[00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:29.730]  Let's start out with your
[00:02:31.172 --> 00:02:35.335]  Your report about how they don't plan to attack Iran, but the Easter Bunny is real not fictitious.
[00:02:35.335 --> 00:02:46.902]  I mean, we knew two years ago that they did an emergency funding of tens of billions of dollars to produce over 200 mini bunker-busting nukes.
[00:02:46.902 --> 00:02:49.724]  No telling what else the government is going to do with all those mini-nukes.
[00:02:49.724 --> 00:02:51.745]  I'm sure detonate one and claim the terrorists did it.
[00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:58.869]  They want to destroy too much of their real estate, just 10 or 15 city blocks instead of a whole city, when they bomb us here in the near future.
[00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:02.671]  I predict there's an 80% plus chance that'll happen in the next two years.
[00:03:02.671 --> 00:03:07.513]  But, I mean, they openly are saying they're going to attack them.
[00:03:07.513 --> 00:03:09.534]  They're openly gearing up for it.
[00:03:09.534 --> 00:03:15.017]  The memos have come out from London that they're planning to attack Iran in the next 6 to 10 months.
[00:03:15.017 --> 00:03:17.178]  But no, they say it's a conspiracy theory, Paul.
[00:03:17.178 --> 00:03:18.299]  There's no plan.
[00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:18.779]  Tell us about it.
[00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:23.452]  Right, well, yeah, it came out on Sunday.
[00:03:23.452 --> 00:03:32.315]  Seymour Hersh said they were planning on using these bunker busters to attack the underground nuclear sites in Iran.
[00:03:32.315 --> 00:03:36.116]  Wild Speculation Bush called it on Monday.
[00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:39.857]  Rumsfeld called it Fantasyland.
[00:03:39.857 --> 00:03:44.259]  Jack Straw, the UK Foreign Secretary, called it Completely Nuts.
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.883]  So, when it happens, we're going to bring those quotes back to light and expose them for the lies they are.
[00:03:50.883 --> 00:04:03.490]  The Bunkerbusters themselves, um, I link to articles from September 2004 where Israel purchased 500 of them from the United States.
[00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.150]  So today it's a new story.
[00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.131]  It's missing the point.
[00:04:06.756 --> 00:04:18.502]  And then yesterday, World Tribune carried an article saying that the Council on Foreign Relations in a meeting had been told that basically it's a done deal.
[00:04:18.502 --> 00:04:22.665]  Dick Cheney wants it, Donald Rumsfeld wants it, and it's going to happen.
[00:04:22.665 --> 00:04:34.611]  So I suppose the upcoming Bilderberg meeting will kind of put the rubber stamp exactly on when it's going to be, as happened with the Iraq War where they delayed it for half a year or so.
[00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:49.600]  But with Iran, we have this situation where they are a signatory to this NPT treaty, Non-Proliferation Treaty, whereas India are not.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.222]  India being the country that nearly went to nuclear war with Pakistan in 2002.
[00:04:56.222 --> 00:05:02.004]  And before that, the British and American military establishment were arming both sides.
[00:05:02.754 --> 00:05:09.037]  But we can sell sophisticated nuclear technology to India, and it's not a problem.
[00:05:09.037 --> 00:05:09.977]  Why?
[00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:15.260]  Because as Henry Kissinger said two or three weeks ago, India is part of the New World Order.
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.681]  Iran, being a rogue state, is not.
[00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:28.045]  So it's not about who has nukes, it's about whether the countries that have them are part of the Anglo-American control establishment.
[00:05:28.045 --> 00:05:29.846]  Well you're absolutely right, but
[00:05:31.238 --> 00:05:44.389]  Yeah, Israel purchased 500 conventional bunker busters that can also be converted rather quickly to carry hydrogen bombs within them.
[00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.352]  And of course, they penetrate to 20 feet and then detonate.
[00:05:47.352 --> 00:05:53.477]  And then at the same time, top generals, generals who are known as being conservative, who recently retired,
[00:05:54.568 --> 00:06:16.930]  have gone public and said yes indeed this is going on the brass is threatening to revolt this is gonna start world war three that's exactly what Cheney and Bush and their controllers want they're in deep trouble their whole agenda is in deep trouble if they attack Iran with yes ladies and gentlemen hundreds of nukes they say over 200 sites that they plan to hit
[00:06:17.683 --> 00:06:20.865]  If they do that, Iran has no choice whether you love them or hate them folks.
[00:06:20.865 --> 00:06:23.686]  I don't particularly love people in Iran that run the government there.
[00:06:23.686 --> 00:06:35.951]  They had a more moderate government and our government tried to push them around so the extremists got into power and they're gonna fight back or if they don't fight back properly and can't strike the U.S.
[00:06:35.951 --> 00:06:37.952]  the globalists will and claim they did it.
[00:06:37.952 --> 00:06:43.315]  Then we're gonna have national conscription and we're gonna march off into the new world order.
[00:06:43.315 --> 00:06:45.576]  And meanwhile the border will be open here and
[00:06:46.252 --> 00:06:51.136]  You know, when you go to the TSA, they can take your shoes off and say your feet stink and laugh at you.
[00:06:51.136 --> 00:06:55.019]  By the way, Paul, did you hear at the start of the show how I got laughed at yesterday leaving LAX?
[00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:58.422]  They made me take my shoes off and then laughed and said my feet stunk.
[00:06:58.422 --> 00:07:00.624]  By the way, my feet didn't stink, folks.
[00:07:00.624 --> 00:07:02.766]  It was just totally made up.
[00:07:02.766 --> 00:07:05.688]  But, I mean, this is what America's turned into.
[00:07:05.688 --> 00:07:08.531]  I'm being prodded by people saying I have stinky feet.
[00:07:08.531 --> 00:07:09.491]  Ha ha ha!
[00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:11.413]  But it's for security, but the border's wide open.
[00:07:12.631 --> 00:07:21.953]  Yeah, last week there was an 83-year-old woman in a wheelchair at Denver International who had had a stroke, a hip replacement, a heart attack.
[00:07:21.953 --> 00:07:33.456]  She was under doctor's orders not to stand up, but the TSA insisted on dragging her out of her wheelchair and giving her a full body search because she may have been a terrorist.
[00:07:33.456 --> 00:07:38.057]  I guess the profile for terrorists is now 83-year-old grandmothers with hip problems.
[00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:43.260]  By the way, the documents have come out.
[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.522]  They are encouraged to be mean to us.
[00:07:45.522 --> 00:07:48.123]  We're being trained, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:48.123 --> 00:07:49.144]  We're being gelded.
[00:07:49.144 --> 00:07:52.726]  We're being domesticated.
[00:07:52.726 --> 00:08:05.033]  And then the solution is truth-telling machines at Moscow Airport, which I guess the TSA are probably salivating over, whereby one of the questions is,
[00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.673]  And this is, you don't fly if you fail the test.
[00:08:08.673 --> 00:08:12.936]  One of the questions is, have you ever lied to the authorities?
[00:08:12.936 --> 00:08:17.618]  Who in their entire life hasn't lied to some authority or another?
[00:08:17.618 --> 00:08:29.164]  But they're going in Moscow airports, so that's the next expansion of the police state in the airports, getting you used to it, which eventually will be on all street corners and shopping malls, the same kind of technology.
[00:08:29.164 --> 00:08:32.226]  Yeah, five airports for four years, and the U.S.
[00:08:32.226 --> 00:08:33.847]  CBS News reported four years ago
[00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:47.031]  And that's something I know of, have a passive MRI that brain scans you and then if a certain area of your brain is active, it shows you're angry, you must be a terrorist.
[00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:52.153]  Now again folks, we've proven that the lie detector test, the old one, is a fraud.
[00:08:52.153 --> 00:08:54.214]  It's not now really admissible in court.
[00:08:54.214 --> 00:08:55.634]  It's being phased out.
[00:08:55.634 --> 00:08:59.936]  So they just come out with more sophisticated black boxes with a computer screen
[00:09:01.172 --> 00:09:18.731]  And oh, this shows that you're angry, this shows that you're bad, this shows you're lying, so it's not just that you're quote on a no-fly list because we say so, now it's well it's not like Nazi Germany where Jews can't travel, or now American patriots can't travel, it's that the computer says you're bad.
[00:09:18.731 --> 00:09:21.614]  Yeah, there's also a guy
[00:09:22.535 --> 00:09:38.503]  In a taxi heading for an airport in Britain, who was singing along to some, uh, clash punk records in the taxi, uh, the taxi driver informed the airport police that he was a potential terrorist because he was singing along to some punk songs.
[00:09:39.415 --> 00:09:41.076]  Um, and they investigated him.
[00:09:41.076 --> 00:09:55.080]  So, again, that Stasi society that's being encouraged, especially in Britain with the massive poster campaign, um, encouraging people to inform on their neighbors, inform on people who drive vehicles or own houses.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.781]  By the way, you're not, by the way, you're not joking.
[00:09:56.781 --> 00:10:01.282]  It actually says drives vehicles, own houses, pays their bills a certain way.
[00:10:01.282 --> 00:10:02.843]  And then we have the Virginium.
[00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:30.030]  federally written manual for all state employees saying uh... what what's the exact quote property rights activist yes that it says they are terrorist but but but if you're an illegal alien running around waving a foreign flag saying you're going to take over and wearing a t-shirt advocating the killing of all white males above the age of sixteen oh by the way a point made by my staff who did go down to videotape and cover
[00:10:32.195 --> 00:10:35.097]  In the last two days, the local demonstrations and protests.
[00:10:35.097 --> 00:10:41.563]  I'll be playing some clips on the TV show tonight and put it on the website for members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:10:41.563 --> 00:10:48.128]  If you go out for a land rights rally, second amendment rally, or I've gone for a rally for a little black girl wrongly jailed.
[00:10:48.128 --> 00:10:52.012]  I've been to a march for a Hispanic man shot in the back.
[00:10:52.012 --> 00:10:53.033]  Okay?
[00:10:53.033 --> 00:10:56.856]  And they will have riot cops bugging their eyes out at you, trying to start problems.
[00:10:57.665 --> 00:11:04.268]  I mean, you can have 50 people marching, and they're there, in the Darth Vader outfits, you know, the black mask, the helmets, everything.
[00:11:04.268 --> 00:11:09.171]  None of them out for the illegal aliens taking over highways, running around, foaming at the mouth.
[00:11:09.171 --> 00:11:10.912]  Paul?
[00:11:10.912 --> 00:11:18.216]  No, and it was now admitted the Pentagon initiated surveillance against tiny little anti-war groups.
[00:11:18.216 --> 00:11:26.160]  And now you've got the sight of millions of Mexicans, Latinos, demonstrating, sometimes violently,
[00:11:26.838 --> 00:11:36.369]  And the media has to be balanced on it, but they're not balanced when the minute men do anything, they're demonised as vigilantes, as Bush called them himself.
[00:11:36.369 --> 00:11:43.978]  But, you know, Bush is foreclosing the borders, we're told, when he calls the people who are behind the active movement to do that, vigilantes.
[00:11:44.893 --> 00:11:47.335]  By the way, the same thing's happening in your country.
[00:11:47.335 --> 00:12:00.003]  Blair is trying to make the citizens of the UK have absolutely no rights, but then he's caught, and this is mainstream news, signing secret documents and agreements to try to accelerate bringing in illegals.
[00:12:00.003 --> 00:12:01.684]  Right, exactly.
[00:12:01.684 --> 00:12:13.992]  And one of the forefronts of the propaganda to introduce the ID card is based on stopping illegal immigration when he's behind the push to ramp it up massively.
[00:12:14.873 --> 00:12:16.114]  Well, the folks I was with in L.A.
[00:12:16.114 --> 00:12:22.060]  this weekend watched a little bit of TV, so I saw some of it, and I also listened to talk radio driving around in traffic.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.261]  And you hear them call her and call her.
[00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:25.804]  Yeah, it's horrible, these illegal aliens, the open borders.
[00:12:25.804 --> 00:12:30.128]  I just love George W. I mean, there's a disconnect, Paul.
[00:12:30.128 --> 00:12:33.131]  Let's switch gears, shift gears here for a second.
[00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:38.050]  Yeah, they were apprehended the night before by uniformed police who the source said it was an obvious attempt to
[00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:06.132]  By the way, we continue to be blessed in these attacks.
[00:13:06.132 --> 00:13:08.874]  The attacks are horrible, but I'm saying on 9-11,
[00:13:25.976 --> 00:13:31.878]  Cheney meant to get the Capitol, Air Force didn't follow orders, shot down 93, and again with London.
[00:13:31.878 --> 00:13:49.402]  Time into, uh, 93, not flight 93, in 1993, the two retarded men they hired, literally retarded, even though the FBI showed them through their agent twice how to park it up against the column, they didn't park it up against the column, and so it didn't bring down one of the towers.
[00:13:49.402 --> 00:13:52.883]  So over and over again, Paul, they keep screwing up and it saves a lot of lives.
[00:13:52.883 --> 00:13:53.603]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:13:54.494 --> 00:14:05.841]  Yeah, which is why, you know, you say to people, well, 9-11 didn't necessarily have to be orchestrated by a large group of people because of the drills confusing the air control people.
[00:14:05.841 --> 00:14:12.845]  And they say, well, if it was orchestrated by a small group of people, surely they'd make mistakes in such a massive operation.
[00:14:12.845 --> 00:14:13.765]  Well, they always do.
[00:14:13.765 --> 00:14:20.289]  9-11 was, at one point on 9-11, there were reports that nine different planes had been hijacked.
[00:14:20.289 --> 00:14:21.470]  That was never clarified.
[00:14:22.214 --> 00:14:28.477]  Um, obviously Flight 93 as well was shot down, so it was meant to be a much bigger attack in scope.
[00:14:28.477 --> 00:14:36.200]  Um, the second wave kind of on 9-11, the real attack, the planes with the diversion, the real attack was the collapse of the buildings.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.742]  And it seems in the case of 7-7, that this fifth bomb was set to explode.
[00:14:42.542 --> 00:14:54.567]  Either simultaneously with the others or immediately afterwards, therefore drowning all the rescue personnel, as happened on 9-11 with killing a lot of the rescue personnel with the collapse of the building.
[00:14:54.567 --> 00:14:59.189]  Which then creates heroes for the government and then gets the cops behind the system.
[00:14:59.189 --> 00:15:01.791]  We lost men, we're taking everybody's rights.
[00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:03.932]  But the good cops in London did stop this.
[00:15:03.932 --> 00:15:04.672]  Give us more details.
[00:15:05.845 --> 00:15:13.028]  Yeah, and immediately on the scene with Special Branch and MI5, they told the uniformed officers to keep quiet.
[00:15:13.028 --> 00:15:25.032]  And then subsequent attempts by the uniformed officers to track and trace what happened to these terrorists were met with complete silence and they, quote, vanished into thin air.
[00:15:25.032 --> 00:15:31.475]  So if this was a real terrorist organization that the government had stopped and the government had foiled an attack,
[00:15:32.293 --> 00:15:37.921]  You know, why would they fail to jump on it as a glorious success in the war on terror?
[00:15:37.921 --> 00:15:44.530]  Because they could have used it as gas mileage for the propaganda war for ID cards and, you know, keeping troops in Iraq.
[00:15:45.582 --> 00:15:47.143]  Um, ad infinitum.
[00:15:47.143 --> 00:15:52.166]  So why would they cover it up if it was such a great success that they had foiled the attack?
[00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:55.888]  Well, I mean, we know that the head of the bombers was a SWAT, known MI6.
[00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:57.809]  That's mainstream news.
[00:15:57.809 --> 00:15:58.970]  I mean, clearly they're off.
[00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.650]  Clearly the cops stopped them.
[00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:04.753]  And then they, they, they covered it up and let their agents get away.
[00:16:04.753 --> 00:16:12.497]  Yeah, because the final report, which hasn't had any play in the media, it's basically quietly released, says that
[00:16:13.271 --> 00:16:18.013]  None of the four bombers, 7-7 bombers, had any links to Al-Qaeda.
[00:16:18.013 --> 00:16:42.381]  So it was not an Al-Qaeda operation, which again backs up our assertion that these guys were dupes who thought they were role players in this exercise targeting the same locations at the exact same time on the morning of 7-7, which is statistically, if you're talking about it being coincidental... There's 48 zeros on the number.
[00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:42.641]  Yeah.
[00:16:44.194 --> 00:17:09.337]  So, the explanation that the British National Party had for it, that the government is somehow covering up and not blaming it on this wider Muslim hate campaign, by releasing this final report not implicating them in it, is totally inconsistent with the facts, because up until that final report, and I've got a link to it in the article,
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:19.362]  Britons were bombarded with propaganda from the government and media saying that Al-Qaeda had attacked London and that this was an Al-Qaeda operation.
[00:17:19.362 --> 00:17:27.524]  So the fact that the final report says it doesn't, and it's quietly released, proves that these guys were the dukes that we said they were all along.
[00:17:27.524 --> 00:17:31.024]  Well, the final report on Spain says it wasn't Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:31.024 --> 00:17:31.925]  Yep.
[00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:35.945]  And then Scotland Yard, real detectives, say these guys weren't bombers and were set up.
[00:17:35.945 --> 00:17:39.006]  I mean, that's not Paul Watson or Alex Jones, that's Scotland Yard.
[00:17:39.702 --> 00:17:41.443]  The real cops know what's going on.
[00:17:41.443 --> 00:17:45.984]  We'll be right back.
[00:17:45.984 --> 00:17:49.085]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:17:49.085 --> 00:17:51.006]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:17:51.006 --> 00:17:56.008]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:17:56.008 --> 00:18:00.870]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.991]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:08.214]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:18:08.214 --> 00:18:13.078]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:18:13.078 --> 00:18:17.702]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:18:17.702 --> 00:18:25.189]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:18:25.189 --> 00:18:27.771]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:18:27.771 --> 00:18:29.533]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:51.564]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:18:51.564 --> 00:18:58.008]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:18:58.008 --> 00:19:06.693]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:19:06.693 --> 00:19:13.697]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:19:14.017 --> 00:19:19.061]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:19:19.061 --> 00:19:24.806]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:19:24.806 --> 00:19:28.209]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight or nightlight.
[00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:36.235]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:47.091]  I'm good.
[00:20:01.969 --> 00:20:02.249]  I think so.
[00:20:22.128 --> 00:20:22.248]  Uh-oh!
[00:20:22.248 --> 00:20:23.689]  A guy was listening to Led Zeppelin!
[00:20:52.387 --> 00:20:58.950]  In the taxi cab, amongst other things, the clash as well, and the taxi driver thought it was terror.
[00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.151]  Are they gonna come arrest me?
[00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:02.111]  Listen to the terrorism.
[00:21:02.111 --> 00:21:10.715]  Turn it up.
[00:21:10.715 --> 00:21:12.396]  One more time.
[00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:13.696]  Here's the... Listen to it.
[00:21:13.696 --> 00:21:19.319]  Terrorism.
[00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:20.359]  Welcome back.
[00:21:20.359 --> 00:21:21.700]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:21:22.515 --> 00:21:24.036]  Your host.
[00:21:24.036 --> 00:21:28.059]  I'm going to keep Paul with us five minutes from the next hour, and then Daniel Esselstyn joins us from Madrid, Spain.
[00:21:28.059 --> 00:21:32.062]  We'll have open phones the next hour, and another great guest in the third hour as well.
[00:21:32.062 --> 00:21:33.283]  Totally jam-packed for you.
[00:21:33.283 --> 00:21:35.685]  I am back in the saddle and loving it.
[00:21:35.685 --> 00:21:38.047]  I thought of something just a second ago.
[00:21:38.047 --> 00:21:44.532]  I was out front of my office, and I guess three or four Hispanic folks were at the business next door that I've never met.
[00:21:44.532 --> 00:21:46.774]  They said, Hey Alex Jones, I appreciate what you're doing.
[00:21:47.406 --> 00:21:49.548]  They're all, you know, wearing UT shirts and hanging out.
[00:21:49.548 --> 00:21:51.610]  They had some of their, I guess, white friends with them.
[00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:52.991]  See, we all get along real good.
[00:21:52.991 --> 00:22:02.220]  We never really thought about each other being different until all these southerner Mexicans came in here and our government told us that this was Mexico and they told us it was Mexico.
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:09.047]  It's kind of like, say you're from New York and then somebody from Texas comes up there and tells you they're taking over.
[00:22:09.668 --> 00:22:13.430]  I mean, certainly Mexicans, historically, have got a place in Texas.
[00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.431]  Northern Mexicans in Tejanos are as Texan as it gets.
[00:22:16.431 --> 00:22:18.252]  More Texan than anybody.
[00:22:18.252 --> 00:22:23.414]  But you've got all these people from Southern Mexico with a real population in Central Mexico.
[00:22:23.414 --> 00:22:24.834]  Ballooning has happened.
[00:22:24.834 --> 00:22:29.616]  And they're up there, up here now, with their government and others, trying to get everybody fighting with each other.
[00:22:29.616 --> 00:22:31.277]  And I don't appreciate it and I don't like it.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.822]  And it's just disgusting, but that's a side issue.
[00:22:34.822 --> 00:22:40.726]  Paul, before we hit a few final news items with you, I want to get your take on the bird flu that popped up supposedly last week there.
[00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:42.447]  We are ending the special today.
[00:22:42.447 --> 00:22:45.989]  In fact, I got back to town and it was going to end yesterday, but it is over today.
[00:22:45.989 --> 00:22:53.514]  If you're taking it down in, what, two hours and five minutes, you won't be able to get the five-plus months free when you sign up for a year.
[00:22:53.514 --> 00:22:58.978]  You pay for a little over six months, you get five-plus months, 5.3 months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:58.978 --> 00:22:59.618]  Tell folks about it.
[00:23:00.948 --> 00:23:12.995]  Yeah, it's going to be taken down about an hour after the show ends, so you need to hurry and get it, because we're going to have quite a considerable break before we run that yearly special again.
[00:23:12.995 --> 00:23:21.120]  So you get five months free, which is about, what, $15 off the normal price, which is $54.95.
[00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:25.282]  $39.95 for a whole year.
[00:23:25.282 --> 00:23:28.983]  Now to explain that, you already get three months free whenever you sign up for a year.
[00:23:28.983 --> 00:23:30.924]  We've just added a few more months.
[00:23:30.924 --> 00:23:37.187]  People will do that math and go, what do you mean, you know, $50 something to $39, that's not... So explain that to people.
[00:23:37.187 --> 00:23:50.952]  Yes, it's based on the fact that if you paid monthly $5.95 a month, you already saved three months by getting the standard yearly, which is $54.95, but with this spring special,
[00:23:51.804 --> 00:23:58.088]  Compared to paying monthly, you get over five months free by paying $39.95 upfront.
[00:23:58.088 --> 00:24:03.411]  But it's being taken down very shortly, so we encourage people to go and get it.
[00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:09.835]  And if you don't want to do that, folks, go get a monthly $5.95, download, burn all my films to DVD or disc, give them to people.
[00:24:09.835 --> 00:24:11.195]  It's a great activist tool.
[00:24:11.195 --> 00:24:14.737]  Tell people, Paul, some of the stuff that's on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:14.737 --> 00:24:16.999]  Yeah, there's already a library of
[00:24:18.067 --> 00:24:32.603]  Alex Jones' television show, going back to April 2004, two years worth of in-studio reports, field location reports like the one I've just put up with the protest of Keane, and
[00:24:34.844 --> 00:24:40.866]  Every major audio interview from the Alex Jones Show, the one with Daniel Estulin, will be going up later tonight.
[00:24:40.866 --> 00:24:43.627]  Every Alex Jones documentary.
[00:24:43.627 --> 00:24:47.968]  Dozens of documentaries from other authors that we've been given permission to post.
[00:24:47.968 --> 00:24:54.490]  So for $5.95 you can just go and download everything you need and cancel if you really want to do that.
[00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.111]  My book, your book,

[00:25:38.352 --> 00:25:41.454]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:25:41.454 --> 00:25:48.036]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfalls, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:25:48.036 --> 00:25:55.519]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.

[00:26:27.601 --> 00:26:27.841]  Big Brother.
[00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:51.422]  Well, I'm back.
[00:26:51.422 --> 00:27:02.911]  I'm back in Austin, out in the City of Angels this weekend over the last two days in very important business in the fight against the New World Order that someday in the future
[00:27:20.965 --> 00:27:22.126]  Well, you'll get to hear about it.
[00:27:22.126 --> 00:27:23.727]  It's very exciting.
[00:27:23.727 --> 00:27:26.589]  But maybe sooner than later, who knows.
[00:27:26.589 --> 00:27:29.452]  But Paul Watson riding shotgun with us for another five minutes.
[00:27:29.452 --> 00:27:33.395]  A few other news items from London, from England and globally.
[00:27:33.395 --> 00:27:36.757]  And then we've got Daniel Estelan joining us from Spain to talk about Bilderberg Group.
[00:27:36.757 --> 00:27:38.298]  I think a lot of other news we'll be covering.
[00:27:38.298 --> 00:27:39.819]  Paul, there's a lot of other issues.
[00:27:39.819 --> 00:27:49.607]  Let me get your take on how we knew it was Bush that ordered the leak to burn Valerie Plame to go after Wilson, the ambassador on the yellowcake uranium situation, because he wouldn't lie for them.
[00:27:49.847 --> 00:27:51.068]  Well, you're the Cheney getting booed one.
[00:27:51.068 --> 00:27:53.970]  I've got a weakness for going to football matches twice a month.
[00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:56.111]  And I know what a boo sounds like and what a cheer sounds like.
[00:27:56.111 --> 00:27:56.912]  For a start,
[00:28:17.822 --> 00:28:19.043]  And by the way, think about that.
[00:28:42.637 --> 00:28:50.801]  They always have the most popular baseball players with them, or they have some guy in a wheelchair, and it still, still is backfiring on them.
[00:28:50.801 --> 00:28:54.663]  Yeah, and my take on it was the media response.
[00:28:54.663 --> 00:29:05.769]  Reuters, cheers, boos, as Cheney opens a baseball game, with cheers before boos, and capitalized, suggesting that he got more cheers than boos, when it was the opposite way around.
[00:29:05.769 --> 00:29:07.790]  So the Washington Post is even worse, because
[00:29:08.638 --> 00:29:23.723]  They suggested that the boos were a result of the fact that he threw a bad pitch, which bounced before the guy caught it, which is outright lying because he was getting booed as he walked onto the field, which the video clearly shows.
[00:29:23.723 --> 00:29:28.144]  By the way, that's a top story.
[00:29:28.144 --> 00:29:29.945]  I should have told you to get that, Scott.
[00:29:29.945 --> 00:29:31.905]  It's at thetopofprisonplanet.com.
[00:29:31.905 --> 00:29:33.146]  You go grab that audio for us.
[00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:33.606]  Thank you.
[00:29:33.606 --> 00:29:34.146]  Sorry, go ahead, Paul.
[00:29:35.518 --> 00:29:42.444]  Yeah, so I expanded it into this journalistic code of ethics whereby everything has to be balanced.
[00:29:42.444 --> 00:29:50.230]  So they have to say you got cheers as well when it was 80% to 20% so they totally missed the target intentionally.
[00:29:50.230 --> 00:30:04.882]  And the Washington Post outright lies but don't get picked up on it and there won't be a retraction but we, the alternative bloggers if you want to call us that, if we make one little faux pas then we get emails saying we're charlatans.
[00:30:05.618 --> 00:30:12.021]  So I expanded it into a thing which is why it's called the credibility of the dissenting viewpoint.
[00:30:12.021 --> 00:30:17.323]  Because if you're in the alternative media, you're kind of held to a higher standard.
[00:30:17.323 --> 00:30:22.405]  Because you have to prepare yourself for the backlash of people who believe in the dominant paradigm.
[00:30:22.405 --> 00:30:23.365]  But that's good!
[00:30:23.365 --> 00:30:26.006]  That's good because what doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
[00:30:26.972 --> 00:30:36.156]  Yeah, which is why you'll notice alternative bloggers laboriously source everything they say with hyperlinks to mainstream news sources.
[00:30:36.156 --> 00:30:40.237]  Mainstream news and commentary pieces don't do that.
[00:30:40.237 --> 00:30:46.420]  So because we're held to such a higher standard, we have to be more careful that everything's proven and documented, which is why
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:58.429]  The dissenting viewpoint is always more credible, which is kind of the subject of a new book by Michael Parenti that's coming out, so I just expanded it into that in the article.
[00:30:59.708 --> 00:31:00.368]  Well done!
[00:31:00.368 --> 00:31:04.070]  You know, they have that little song, you're a good man, Charlie Brown.
[00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:07.152]  You're a good man, Paul Watson.
[00:31:07.152 --> 00:31:15.157]  Hey, I appreciate all your hard work, Paul.
[00:31:15.157 --> 00:31:18.398]  And I want to get you to check in with us before this weekend.
[00:31:18.398 --> 00:31:22.100]  I like these little 30 minute info bombs that you drop on us.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.741]  And I appreciate your hard work.
[00:31:23.741 --> 00:31:24.862]  I appreciate the whole crew.
[00:31:25.905 --> 00:31:28.629]  And say hi to your brother for me.
[00:31:28.629 --> 00:31:30.151]  And we'll be talking to you real soon.
[00:31:30.151 --> 00:31:37.101]  Paul, I hope you will go over to PrisonPlanet.tv because we're closing the special in just a couple hours.
[00:31:37.101 --> 00:31:39.565]  So, Vaya con Dios, Waddy.
[00:31:39.565 --> 00:31:41.788]  Alright, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:41.788 --> 00:31:42.189]  Stay with us.
[00:31:44.784 --> 00:31:51.926]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:31:51.926 --> 00:31:53.507]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[00:31:53.507 --> 00:31:55.847]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:31:55.847 --> 00:31:58.208]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:31:58.208 --> 00:32:03.490]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11, this is the film for you.
[00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:07.511]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:32:07.771 --> 00:32:09.611]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:20.414]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:32:20.414 --> 00:32:22.515]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
