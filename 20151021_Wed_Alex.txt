[00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:06.249]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:08.010]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.771]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:11.351]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:12.912]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:17.093]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.093 --> 00:00:21.135]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.368 --> 00:00:32.374]  Former Congressman Ron Paul will be joining us at the start of the next hour.
[00:00:32.374 --> 00:00:42.346]  And then Michael Schneider from the Economic Collapse blog will be joining us to cover the economy and a lot of other big major world developments.
[00:00:42.346 --> 00:00:45.570]  Coming up... at the bottom...
[00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:49.008]  of the hour.
[00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:58.316]  I don't normally get into just hype-related stories, but because there was so much news coverage of it, I happened to look into it a little bit, and I can give my view.
[00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:11.167]  I wouldn't really call it an opinion, but my view, my perspective, on whether or not the new Star Wars is anti-white.
[00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:12.248]  Because they've got CNN,
[00:01:13.883 --> 00:01:23.442]  Fox News all jumping on the bandwagon after WorldNetDaily ran a story a few days ago that Drudge picked up simply asking the question pointing out sites that were making that claim.
[00:01:25.014 --> 00:01:37.224]  I think clearly you can say the whole political correct agenda is anti-human, anti-culture, and therefore anti-Western civilization, anti-white, but it's anti-everybody else at the same time as well.
[00:01:37.224 --> 00:01:42.748]  It's playing different groups off against each other, obviously, but I'll give you my view on that at the bottom of the hour.
[00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:48.093]  I do not think that having a black lead actor is meant to be anti-white.
[00:01:48.093 --> 00:01:50.735]  There should be a black lead actor if he's a good actor.
[00:01:52.796 --> 00:02:00.360]  No one is going to say that the Black Jedi Master character that they had in Episode 1, 2, and 3 was bad.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:11.186]  Nobody complained about Samuel L. Jackson playing Mace Windu because he's a good actor and he pulled it off, defeating Emperor Palpatine.
[00:02:11.186 --> 00:02:12.607]  This guy just looks like
[00:02:14.124 --> 00:02:19.285]  He has the same acting abilities as the other individual that played Anakin Skywalker.
[00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:22.326]  People didn't dislike him because he was white.
[00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:25.507]  They disliked him because he wasn't very masculine.
[00:02:25.507 --> 00:02:28.408]  He didn't carry the role across.
[00:02:28.408 --> 00:02:38.350]  I mean, James Earl Jones' voice in a seven foot tall armored guy in black with a samurai helmet on, breathing on a respirator, is intimidating.
[00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:47.830]  This guy running around in a Stormtrooper outfit has the feel of an after-school movie.
[00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.791]  See, I said I'd cover it at the bottom of the hour.
[00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:51.992]  I'm already doing it.
[00:02:51.992 --> 00:02:56.433]  But there's some other big twists to this that are more important.
[00:02:56.433 --> 00:02:58.993]  I wouldn't say this film's anti-white.
[00:02:58.993 --> 00:03:01.354]  It's anti-male, though.
[00:03:02.304 --> 00:03:05.466]  And so the rest of the story is coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:14.792]  Because look, this is not really important overall, except the overall programming that is going on, that's what we've really got to be aware of.
[00:03:14.792 --> 00:03:17.093]  That's, in my view, what we've got to be looking at.
[00:03:17.093 --> 00:03:20.135]  So, that's coming up.
[00:03:20.135 --> 00:03:25.459]  Now, speaking of political correctness being nothing but cultural tyranny,
[00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:32.635]  Banned students suspended over racist fruit basket gift.
[00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:43.077]  Teams give each other gifts during football games, especially things like homecoming and other special events.
[00:03:43.077 --> 00:03:46.498]  And I've looked at the story.
[00:03:46.498 --> 00:03:49.899]  They gave them a fruitcake, which is customary in the fall and winter.
[00:03:51.221 --> 00:04:00.845]  And because it had small pieces of watermelon in amongst the dozens of other fruits, well, that is racist, just like brown bags are racist.
[00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:08.848]  Now, building Planned Parenthood in the middle of black neighborhoods and having Planned Parenthood say they're there to exterminate the black weeds, that is not racist.
[00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:13.010]  But watermelon, ladies and gentlemen, in a fruitcake,
[00:04:14.181 --> 00:04:26.326]  In amongst the nuts and the cherries and the pieces of pineapple and grapes and chunks of strawberry, dried fruit, is evil.
[00:04:26.326 --> 00:04:32.789]  And so now they are, the school says, they apologize, that it was quite evil.
[00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:34.470]  So we're all going to be saved.
[00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.470]  And that ties into...
[00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:40.692]  France prosecutes political leader Le Pen.
[00:04:40.692 --> 00:04:43.373]  She's set to be the next president, probably, in polls.
[00:04:43.373 --> 00:04:47.274]  But no, she's facing a year in prison for criticizing radical Islam.
[00:04:47.274 --> 00:04:47.955]  That's illegal.
[00:04:47.955 --> 00:04:50.035]  And that ties into this report.
[00:04:50.035 --> 00:04:55.177]  Finnish police banned from identifying migrants as criminal suspects.
[00:04:55.177 --> 00:04:55.757]  Stay with us.
[00:04:55.757 --> 00:04:57.038]  It's a big broadcast coming up.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.565]  It was 30 years ago, in 1985, that Doc and Marty went back another 30 years, to 1955.
[00:05:05.565 --> 00:05:08.567]  Then, they went back to the future, to today.
[00:05:08.567 --> 00:05:12.870]  Where we're going, we don't need roads.
[00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.373]  Well, there's no flying cars, and it isn't the roads they say we don't need.
[00:05:16.373 --> 00:05:19.315]  They tell us where we're going, there won't be any drivers.
[00:05:19.315 --> 00:05:24.278]  And there's no hoverboards or self-lacing shoes, but at least we're not plagued with fax machines.
[00:05:24.278 --> 00:05:25.680]  Oh, sweet 21 gigawatts!
[00:05:26.567 --> 00:05:35.010]  You may just need a lightning strike for power, since Obama and the EPA are trying to shut down most of the power plants.
[00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.391]  But the movie's future resembles the present in a couple of very strange ways.
[00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:51.635]  The Cubs got in the World Series, and even stranger... Discover how, in 1979, Biff successfully lobbied to legalize gambling and turned Hill Valley's dilapidated courthouse into a beautiful casino hotel.
[00:05:51.635 --> 00:05:53.115]  I just want to say one thing.
[00:05:53.115 --> 00:05:54.475]  God bless America.
[00:05:54.475 --> 00:05:56.156]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:05:58.812 --> 00:06:02.334]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:02.334 --> 00:06:10.579]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:16.002]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:16.002 --> 00:06:18.524]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[00:06:29.844 --> 00:06:32.065]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.

[00:06:37.048 --> 00:06:38.748]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:06:38.748 --> 00:06:40.349]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.831]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:06:43.831 --> 00:06:45.812]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:06:45.812 --> 00:06:47.913]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:06:47.913 --> 00:06:49.914]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[00:06:58.659 --> 00:07:00.280]  You can feel it in the air.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.801]  Jack Frost is near.
[00:07:01.801 --> 00:07:06.664]  Seasons are changing and it's time to start reinforcing your body's natural defenses.

[00:07:53.888 --> 00:07:54.328]  Ancient Defense.
[00:08:12.555 --> 00:08:17.418]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:17.418 --> 00:08:27.564]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.564 --> 00:08:30.106]  Rising up my friends.
[00:08:30.106 --> 00:08:32.107]  It is the thrill of the fight.
[00:08:32.107 --> 00:08:34.028]  The thrill of the challenge.
[00:08:34.028 --> 00:08:40.472]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live worldwide broadcast.
[00:08:41.474 --> 00:08:59.259]  We are going to be here for the next four hours live because we have the fourth hour coming up today of course being hosted by one of the Nightly News crew and of course with special reports from yours truly with three hours 11 a.m.
[00:08:59.259 --> 00:09:00.399]  to 2 p.m.
[00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:03.380]  Central Time hosted by yours truly.
[00:09:04.437 --> 00:09:06.358]  I forgot to tell you guys during the break.
[00:09:06.358 --> 00:09:10.781]  I ignored it during the first five minutes, but I can't handle it during this 12-minute segment.
[00:09:10.781 --> 00:09:17.726]  You've got an ultra-high squeal going down my line, and I meant to tell you during the break, so I forgot to do that.
[00:09:17.726 --> 00:09:18.806]  So I'm going to tell you now.
[00:09:18.806 --> 00:09:19.807]  Thank you.
[00:09:19.807 --> 00:09:21.928]  Try to whatever you got flipped on there to flip it off.
[00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:23.169]  Thank you.
[00:09:23.169 --> 00:09:31.394]  All right, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, the fight between Donald Trump and Jeb Bush over the fact that 9-11
[00:09:33.683 --> 00:09:38.684]  Happened on the watch of George W. Bush is heating up.
[00:09:38.684 --> 00:09:39.844]  We've got some clips of that.
[00:09:39.844 --> 00:09:42.324]  We're going to be going over.
[00:09:42.324 --> 00:09:50.486]  Also, NASA gives it a 99% probability of a 5.0 earthquake in Los Angeles in the near future.
[00:09:50.486 --> 00:10:02.888]  That's what our seismologists have been saying on the broadcast as well, that it's the only area in the Ring of Fire that is not triggered yet, and it's overdue to be triggered.
[00:10:04.935 --> 00:10:08.237]  Just on a political correctness front, these are not our top stories.
[00:10:08.237 --> 00:10:09.738]  I'm just getting to these first.
[00:10:09.738 --> 00:10:16.421]  Texas teen arrested for homemade clock that looked exactly like a briefcase bomb and wouldn't say it wasn't a bomb.
[00:10:16.421 --> 00:10:18.002]  Total stunt, obviously.
[00:10:18.002 --> 00:10:20.383]  His father's done stunts before.
[00:10:20.383 --> 00:10:21.924]  Is now to move to Qatar.
[00:10:23.544 --> 00:10:26.907]  Which will be, or Qatar, perfect place for him.
[00:10:26.907 --> 00:10:33.853]  The folks obviously that are working with Saudi Arabia are based over there in all the fun happening in the Middle East right now.
[00:10:33.853 --> 00:10:42.980]  And he's visited with the White House repeatedly, met with Obama again this weekend, and has been meeting with world Islamic leaders and U.S.
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.304]  Islamic leaders about what a poor little victim he is.
[00:10:47.304 --> 00:10:49.146]  Isn't that just special?
[00:10:49.146 --> 00:10:51.768]  And the reason I get to that first is coming up
[00:10:55.828 --> 00:11:00.913]  We're going to look at how the globalists create the crisis to then offer the solution, which is total control.
[00:11:00.913 --> 00:11:09.342]  They don't bring in groups that won't assimilate and then just basically let those groups operate on their own.
[00:11:09.342 --> 00:11:12.726]  Those groups then demand that the West adopt
[00:11:14.229 --> 00:11:33.975]  Whatever the cause du jour is, whatever the flavor of the day is, just to set a precedent and then you're arrested, you're fined, you're feed, you're demonized, you're shut down by the political correct police if you don't comply to whatever the new form of domination is.
[00:11:33.975 --> 00:11:35.655]  And here are the reports with video.
[00:11:35.655 --> 00:11:40.337]  We have video of Marie Le Pen appearing in French court
[00:11:41.571 --> 00:11:45.575]  And she faces one year in prison and massive fines.
[00:11:45.575 --> 00:11:51.520]  She is the presidential front runner in many polls right now and so their answer is just arrest her.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:56.224]  France prosecutes political leader for criticizing Muslims.
[00:11:56.224 --> 00:11:58.806]  Marie Le Pen faces year in prison and more.
[00:12:06.055 --> 00:12:13.118]  Welcome to the next level of oppression, and that ties into something we know has been going on here in the United States for a long time.
[00:12:13.118 --> 00:12:24.823]  If you don't hear the race of a suspect in a murder or a hit and run or a carjacking, if you hear white male, then you know it was a white male.
[00:12:24.823 --> 00:12:31.847]  But if you don't hear what the suspect looks like, they just say a man robbed a woman at this park.
[00:12:31.847 --> 00:12:34.868]  He was driving a blue Ford Chevy or whatever he was driving.
[00:12:37.048 --> 00:12:39.489]  Then you know it was a, quote, minority.
[00:12:39.489 --> 00:12:42.710]  And this is an unspoken rule of political correctness.
[00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.071]  Again, just setting the precedent on information management.
[00:12:46.071 --> 00:12:54.373]  And once you get the media and the police lying in concert on one subject, then they can segue into every other very quickly.
[00:12:55.592 --> 00:13:00.555]  Finnish police ban from identifying migrants as criminal suspects.
[00:13:00.555 --> 00:13:09.300]  Authorities want to, quote, avoid racist backlash from critics of migrant influx.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:15.264]  And in Germany, they arrest you and take your children if you criticize the government's open borders.
[00:13:15.264 --> 00:13:16.845]  Boy, I thought you had free speech, didn't you?
[00:13:18.328 --> 00:13:19.148]  Collapse!
[00:13:19.148 --> 00:13:30.893]  Sweden raped and robbed by migrants and that's the words of their own government that they are collapsing right now as the government accelerates advertising that if you can get there everything's free.
[00:13:30.893 --> 00:13:34.094]  This is part of the government committing suicide against their own culture.
[00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:40.392]  Migrants stay in four-star hotels while poor Germans lose their homes.
[00:13:40.392 --> 00:13:47.095]  Paul Joseph Watson article on Infowars.com, linked on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[00:13:47.095 --> 00:13:50.937]  Low-income families evicted to make way for asylum seekers.
[00:13:50.937 --> 00:13:52.137]  Also the elderly.
[00:13:52.137 --> 00:14:01.041]  This started happening a month ago, but we have a new report linking through to mainstream national German television, reporting on it with a straight face like it's a good thing.
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:10.011]  Migrants are being housed in a four-star hotel in Germany, while Germans themselves are being told to leave their homes to make way for asylum seekers.
[00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:20.745]  See, you know, you think, oh, you work your whole life for the government or whatever, and you get government-assisted living, part of your bill paid for in government housing, but you still basically pay rent.
[00:14:20.745 --> 00:14:26.768]  Then all of a sudden you wake up, you need to leave when you're 75 years old, because we're going to put an Islamic family in.
[00:14:26.768 --> 00:14:28.428]  And people say, well, don't be anti-Islamic.
[00:14:28.428 --> 00:14:29.209]  That's right.
[00:14:29.209 --> 00:14:34.131]  Show you're not anti-Islamic, because groups identifying as Islamic are going to get your house.
[00:14:35.848 --> 00:14:48.218]  The Four Star Hotel, the sheer number of asylum seekers making their way into the Saxony region has resulted in an accommodations crisis, while the Matrium Hotel in
[00:14:50.046 --> 00:14:55.430]  Holley, now being used to house at least 80 migrants who began arriving last week.
[00:14:55.430 --> 00:15:03.936]  The four-star hotel boasts an indoor swimming pool, sauna and fitness room, and is located just a 10-minute walk from the historic Old Town.
[00:15:03.936 --> 00:15:14.404]  And then we have the illegals complaining, too, that they're not getting enough welfare quick enough, and German schoolchildren are sent to make their beds and clean their facilities.
[00:15:16.923 --> 00:15:22.768]  Trump, revoke passports for those who go to fight for ISIS.
[00:15:22.768 --> 00:15:26.030]  Would look at closing certain mosques.
[00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:32.235]  And again, the media is acting like this is the most evil statement ever made in the history of humankind.
[00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:36.158]  If you have a mosque, it's really a political organization calling for murder and death and whatever.
[00:15:36.158 --> 00:15:37.599]  I don't think you close it.
[00:15:37.599 --> 00:15:41.362]  I think you indict the leadership of it.
[00:15:41.362 --> 00:15:43.964]  But the issue is they're demonizing Trump for that.
[00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:51.498]  I mean, if you go fight for ISIS, you should be arrested when you try to return to this country.
[00:15:51.498 --> 00:16:00.604]  It's a known terrorist organization, but that's still not happening because the truth is ISIS is a Western NATO Saudi Arabian proxy army.
[00:16:00.604 --> 00:16:02.746]  Now, we've got video of this as well coming up.
[00:16:02.746 --> 00:16:14.674]  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whether you agree with him or disagree with him, love him or hate him, or neutral, what Benjamin Netanyahu
[00:16:16.391 --> 00:16:20.773]  What he said in his latest speech in a meeting with Merkel is true.
[00:16:20.773 --> 00:16:30.157]  The Grand Mahdi of Jerusalem was one of the most powerful Mahdis, Muftis in the world at the time.
[00:16:30.157 --> 00:16:44.763]  And it's mainline World War II history that he basically invited the Nazis into the Middle East and that they were basically invited into places like Libya after the Italians invaded.
[00:16:48.044 --> 00:16:50.024]  France basically invited Hitler in as well.
[00:16:50.024 --> 00:16:54.966]  That is, most of the government stood down, and then a week later was put back in power by the Nazis.
[00:16:54.966 --> 00:17:12.130]  So, it's true that the grand leader of the Islamic movement in the Middle East, really, at that time, was a Nazi, went to Germany, was buddies with Hitler, encouraged Hitler to kill all the Jews, and so
[00:17:13.308 --> 00:17:18.950]  Merkel came out and said, no, Muslims have no part in killing Jews.
[00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.071]  It's all Germans' fault.
[00:17:21.071 --> 00:17:23.292]  I guess modern Germans, it's their fault too.
[00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:26.953]  So it's all part of this guilt complex.
[00:17:26.953 --> 00:17:41.659]  Germany on Wednesday said that responsibility for the Holocaust lay with the Germans after Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu sparked controversy before a visit to Berlin by saying a Muslim elder had convinced Hitler to exterminate the Jews.
[00:17:43.476 --> 00:17:46.997]  And then he goes over the fact that that went on.
[00:17:46.997 --> 00:17:54.339]  There's really not any secret that there is a love affair with the Nazis to this day in many areas of the Middle East.
[00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:55.519]  But the left doesn't care.
[00:17:55.519 --> 00:18:08.423]  They love teaming up with radical Islam because it is anti-Western and they're anti-Western and really want to mount the Renaissance and true liberalism on the wall as a safari trophy.
[00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:14.965]  Infamous refugee jungle camp swells out of control.
[00:18:14.965 --> 00:18:17.208]  France begged to bring in army.
[00:18:17.208 --> 00:18:21.013]  They even have their own discos, bars, and shops.
[00:18:21.013 --> 00:18:24.657]  There's video of that up on InfoWars.com.
[00:18:24.657 --> 00:18:28.101]  Meanwhile, this is how ninnying and politically correct we're getting in the U.S.
[00:18:28.101 --> 00:18:28.902]  School fights
[00:18:30.362 --> 00:18:46.706]  against five-year-olds using sexist language like he and she, father and mother, boy and girl, and they're traumatizing the poor little five-year-olds with cameras on the buses to analyze their speech patterns and call them in and dress them down for their speech.
[00:18:46.706 --> 00:18:51.667]  Because what you learn in public school and in other accredited facilities as well
[00:18:53.248 --> 00:19:02.752]  Is how to control what you say and have limited language and be completely uptight and upset in a basket case of mental illness.
[00:19:02.752 --> 00:19:05.914]  And that ties in with this next story that I mentioned earlier.
[00:19:05.914 --> 00:19:10.576]  Banned students suspended over a racist fruit basket.
[00:19:10.576 --> 00:19:14.378]  It had been deemed first by the team when there was an investigation as not racist.
[00:19:14.378 --> 00:19:15.178]  It was a fruitcake.
[00:19:16.636 --> 00:19:16.896]  I don't know.
[00:19:35.209 --> 00:19:42.313]  Obviously, if you give watermelon to a team that has some black people on it, it must be racist secret code.
[00:19:42.313 --> 00:19:48.817]  So we're all looking for racist secret codes, and the school has apologized for the fact that that was happening.
[00:19:48.817 --> 00:19:54.601]  I mean, I guess schools can't serve watermelon, period, because it's so evil.
[00:19:54.601 --> 00:19:57.503]  And of course, they're going to expand that out now to brown bags and everything else.
[00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:06.259]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[00:20:06.259 --> 00:20:10.560]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.941]  We typically do the same thing.
[00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:14.962]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[00:20:14.962 --> 00:20:17.182]  But have you considered heat storage?
[00:20:17.182 --> 00:20:19.383]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[00:20:19.383 --> 00:20:21.664]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[00:20:21.664 --> 00:20:23.304]  How will I keep my family warm?
[00:20:23.304 --> 00:20:25.785]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[00:20:25.785 --> 00:20:29.846]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[00:20:30.666 --> 00:20:31.787]  Another concern?
[00:20:31.787 --> 00:20:35.768]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[00:20:35.768 --> 00:20:38.350]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.331]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:45.153]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[00:20:45.153 --> 00:20:49.795]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[00:20:49.795 --> 00:20:51.796]  Don't get stuck in the cold.

[00:20:53.436 --> 00:20:54.797]  You'll never be cold again.

[00:21:58.396 --> 00:22:05.118]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[00:22:05.118 --> 00:22:10.580]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:15.121]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[00:22:15.121 --> 00:22:19.403]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[00:22:19.403 --> 00:22:23.664]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit, and the family you want to protect.
[00:22:24.244 --> 00:22:27.387]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[00:22:27.387 --> 00:22:30.329]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[00:22:30.329 --> 00:22:34.753]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:35.854]  They did.
[00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:40.918]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[00:22:40.918 --> 00:22:42.059]  They did.
[00:22:42.059 --> 00:22:45.922]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[00:22:45.922 --> 00:22:48.284]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:49.805]  This will affect us all.
[00:22:49.805 --> 00:22:51.627]  You can watch the video for free right now

[00:23:27.774 --> 00:23:31.237]  So you've got to take a state construction license exam or certification.
[00:23:31.237 --> 00:23:33.679]  Can't decide on what books or what chapters to study?
[00:23:33.679 --> 00:23:37.943]  Discover right now how you can eliminate unnecessary books and wasted study time.
[00:23:38.123 --> 00:23:38.503]  I think so.
[00:24:05.285 --> 00:24:20.593]  They came and took it all away The lanes in the middle The places where you used to play It was an inside job By the well-connected Young middle-throaters
[00:24:44.054 --> 00:24:45.395]  I think so.
[00:24:55.678 --> 00:25:09.968]  Once dubbed the great humanitarian power by its ex-prime minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt, Sweden is on the edge of a brutal collapse due to a wave of entitled immigrants, raping Sweden's women at a rate of 53.2 percent.
[00:25:09.968 --> 00:25:14.832]  Women who commit rapes work very marginally.
[00:25:14.832 --> 00:25:15.973]  They are often unemployed.
[00:25:15.973 --> 00:25:17.554]  They come from traumatized countries.
[00:25:17.554 --> 00:25:21.717]  Some of them, at least in the last five years, have been asylum seekers.
[00:25:23.419 --> 00:25:25.781]  Hey!
[00:25:25.781 --> 00:25:27.123]  Welcome to Sweden.
[00:25:27.123 --> 00:25:30.066]  This is the number one rape capital of Europe.
[00:25:30.066 --> 00:25:36.834]  Some say that this is because Sweden is very progressive and aware of destructive patriarchal norms, which is why our definition
[00:25:36.914 --> 00:25:41.497]  of rape is broader than in other countries, and more considerate to the victims.
[00:25:41.497 --> 00:25:53.426]  Others say that it's because of our massive levels of immigration, where we import thousands of people from countries in the Middle East and Africa, places that don't really have the best views on women's rights.
[00:25:53.426 --> 00:25:55.827]  But it doesn't matter who is right.
[00:25:55.827 --> 00:26:00.350]  We will never know who is right, because we aren't allowed to talk about it.
[00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:03.593]  Here in Sweden, everything is considered racist.
[00:26:04.213 --> 00:26:14.141]  Danish historian Lars Hedegaard warned the final consequence of the West, and above all, Sweden's immigration policies, that the economy will collapse.
[00:26:14.141 --> 00:26:16.283]  Because who is going to pay for it all?
[00:26:16.283 --> 00:26:22.367]  Increasing taxes on wage earners in Sweden to pay for the influx of illegal immigrants is not enough.
[00:26:22.367 --> 00:26:33.156]  In August, Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson said the government is looking at borrowing large sums of money from the European Investment Bank to pay for illegal immigration.
[00:26:33.576 --> 00:26:45.140]  Why has one government after another chosen to spend Swedish taxpayers' money to support and shelter citizens of other countries, while some of them try to kill us?
[00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:55.883]  Asked Ingrid Karlbist, after a Swedish woman and her son were stabbed to death at an IKEA store in Västerås, Sweden, by Abraham Ukba-Gabir, an illegal immigrant.
[00:26:55.883 --> 00:27:00.665]  Ukba-Gabir said he lost control after learning he was going to be deported to Italy.
[00:27:00.845 --> 00:27:04.949]  He killed an innocent woman and her son to make people understand him.
[00:27:04.949 --> 00:27:12.175]  Prior to the murders, Sweden's third largest city, Malmö, experienced ethnic violence between groups of immigrants.
[00:27:12.175 --> 00:27:19.000]  The gangs, described as youths by the Swedish media, used guns, bombs and hand grenades to mark their turf.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.263]  In August, the Swedish migration board, Migrationsverket,
[00:27:22.463 --> 00:27:32.493]  ...recorded almost as many reports of threats and violence in asylum accommodation as throughout the whole of 2014, according to Swedish newspaper Dagens Jättar.
[00:27:32.493 --> 00:27:42.522]  In Sweden, which does not usually report the nationality of rapists, a just-released study by Swedish police revealed that Muslim men, who constitute only 2% of the population,
[00:27:43.783 --> 00:27:57.069]  are responsible for 77.6 percent of rapes giving once peaceful Sweden the highest rape rate in Europe and the second highest in the world next to South Africa.
[00:27:57.069 --> 00:28:07.093]  Currently illegal immigrants are being housed in former royal mansions and Sweden is building housing for the chaotic violent army taking over and raping their own country.
[00:28:07.333 --> 00:28:11.980]  Ultimately, I want to see every single woman in this country coming from head to toe.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.642]  I want to see the hand of the thief cut.
[00:28:13.642 --> 00:28:15.665]  I want to see adults restored to death.
[00:28:15.665 --> 00:28:17.507]  I want to see Sharia law in Europe.
[00:28:17.507 --> 00:28:18.849]  And I want to see it in America as well.
[00:28:24.278 --> 00:28:43.844]  And the presidential frontrunner in national polls, LePen, comes out and mildly criticizes that their borders are wide open and they shouldn't be paying for foreigners free health care and she is in court indicted facing one year in prison for her hate speech.
[00:28:43.844 --> 00:28:46.625]  Now you think about that and now
[00:28:48.379 --> 00:28:57.681]  Finnish police, they're also now announcing this in Sweden, are going to ban the release of crime statistics on race or religion.
[00:28:57.681 --> 00:29:04.102]  And it's not even that Muslims on average, as I look at the demographics and the numbers, are like this in their own countries.
[00:29:04.102 --> 00:29:11.343]  The West is a toilet bowl for jihadis, criminals, rapists, scum.
[00:29:11.343 --> 00:29:14.404]  That's why upwards of 80% of them are military-age men.
[00:29:15.768 --> 00:29:36.424]  And they're making the trek to Europe to feed off the schmucks, the jokes, the passive, self-hating, self-loathing, cuckold Westerners who a lot of the left are literally having political orgasms right now.
[00:29:36.424 --> 00:29:38.606]  This is so delicious to them.
[00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:46.873]  And the uglier the slums, the more rotting housing, the more society collapses, the happier they get.
[00:29:46.873 --> 00:29:48.253]  They hate prosperity.
[00:29:48.253 --> 00:29:49.654]  They hate the West.
[00:29:49.654 --> 00:29:52.155]  The Empire's on the run.

[00:31:07.316 --> 00:31:09.058]  And I'm gonna do that right now.
[00:31:09.058 --> 00:31:14.445]  I have never, in my 20 years on air, seen a time where it's more important to be prepared.
[00:31:14.705 --> 00:31:19.428]  Even most mainline analysts are now saying we've entered this critical juncture.
[00:31:19.428 --> 00:31:21.249]  We've got to get prepared.
[00:31:21.249 --> 00:31:24.251]  Everyone knows I'm obsessed with win-win situations.

[00:31:56.577 --> 00:32:02.083]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:32:02.083 --> 00:32:06.988]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[00:32:07.008 --> 00:32:07.328]  I don't know.
[00:32:28.416 --> 00:32:29.536]  BrainForce is here.
[00:32:29.536 --> 00:32:31.757]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:32:31.757 --> 00:32:36.738]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:32:36.738 --> 00:32:38.438]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[00:32:38.438 --> 00:32:40.039]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:32:40.039 --> 00:32:43.520]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.500]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.400]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.601]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:49.601]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:32:49.601 --> 00:32:55.202]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:12.443 --> 00:33:15.425]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[00:33:15.425 --> 00:33:21.309]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:41.932 --> 00:33:47.153]  On this worldwide Wednesday transmission.
[00:33:47.153 --> 00:33:52.414]  We're going to go to one of these other John Bowne reports here in just a moment.
[00:33:52.414 --> 00:34:01.356]  And then after we do that, I'm going to come back and give you my breakdown.
[00:34:01.356 --> 00:34:07.318]  On Star Wars, The Force Awakens.
[00:34:07.318 --> 00:34:09.038]  And is it, quote, anti-white?
[00:34:10.694 --> 00:34:27.703]  You know, I think that really is a wrong criticism of the film and it really classically illustrates how this whole divide and conquer strategy works.
[00:34:27.703 --> 00:34:32.706]  And then we are going to get into the other geopolitical news today.
[00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:47.209]  And the latest with what the stabilization program is engaging in here domestically, ahead of Ron Paul joining us and others today.
[00:34:47.209 --> 00:34:52.613]  But John Bowne's been filing so many of these special reports as of late.
[00:34:52.613 --> 00:34:54.074]  They're all so important.
[00:34:54.074 --> 00:34:54.635]  Here's another one.
[00:34:56.095 --> 00:35:07.001]  In a private meeting, Attorney General Loretta Lynch told lawyers representing media organizations that the Justice Department will not send journalists to jail for doing their job.
[00:35:07.001 --> 00:35:21.508]  A commitment that previous Attorney General Eric Holder had made after the Obama administration charged more journalists and legitimate government whistleblowers with espionage than all other presidents combined since the passage of the 1917 Espionage Act.
[00:35:21.508 --> 00:35:24.930]  You know, having good men in positions of power and authority
[00:35:26.363 --> 00:35:29.766]  We're willing to fight for what's right.
[00:35:29.766 --> 00:35:31.528]  That's a rare thing.
[00:35:31.528 --> 00:35:33.870]  That's a powerful thing.
[00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:37.334]  It's something that shapes our future in ways we don't even understand.
[00:35:38.137 --> 00:35:57.329]  Whether it was targeting CIA whistleblower John Curacao for exposing the agency's torture program, seizing Associapress phone records, prosecuting Chelsea Manning, or going after journalists James Risen and James Rosen, Holder undoubtedly oversaw the largest attack on the First Amendment in modern history.
[00:35:57.529 --> 00:36:04.893]  We have always been, and we, I believe, continue to be, in too many ways, essentially, a nation of cowards.
[00:36:04.893 --> 00:36:15.498]  Holder, who was found to be the least popular politician in the United States, according to a Hart Research poll, was arguably the most criminal government official within the Obama administration.
[00:36:15.498 --> 00:36:19.640]  Among his many crimes, a select few have remained at center stage.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:26.104]  Well, Daryl Issa, the congressman, has told Eric Holder, admit you knew.
[00:36:27.046 --> 00:36:48.996]  Admit you lied because now they've got the emails, the witnesses that Holder was running the ATF, the FBI, the DEA and four other agencies in not only ATF ordering gun shops to sell guns but two ATF agents that were coming in and selling them to Mexican drug cartels.
[00:36:48.996 --> 00:36:55.079]  Now a top CBS News reporter says the White House screamed and swore at her
[00:36:56.099 --> 00:37:06.004]  Overfast and furious, and that they're actually panicking over the fact that this could bring down this mafia White House.
[00:37:06.004 --> 00:37:14.468]  Celica Still, who's in federal prison for selling a couple shotguns, he's a former DEA agent, retired school teacher, they set him up.
[00:37:14.468 --> 00:37:20.551]  Six years ago on my show, he told me that Sinaloa was allowed to ship drugs in the United States
[00:37:21.875 --> 00:37:36.841]  And that Los Zetas that was trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, Mexican Commandos, were going to have a fake defection to the drug cartels, but really it was a covert secret war against other cartels not laundering their money through the proper Mexican and U.S.
[00:37:36.841 --> 00:37:37.121]  banks.
[00:37:37.481 --> 00:37:47.244]  That's how I knew two and a half years ago when Holder, the Attorney General, started demonizing the Second Amendment saying we've got to restrict gun ownership because of the problems in Mexico.
[00:37:47.244 --> 00:37:54.627]  I knew from Selly and others that they were already, even before Obama got in office, shipping guns into Mexico.
[00:37:56.591 --> 00:37:58.013]  And drugs back in.
[00:37:58.013 --> 00:37:59.495]  Here are some of the headlines.
[00:37:59.495 --> 00:38:02.960]  Operation Fast and Furious is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:06.765]  There's the head of the Sinaloa cartel, number two in command, but the head of the U.S.
[00:38:06.765 --> 00:38:07.746]  operation.
[00:38:07.746 --> 00:38:11.311]  And the feds have now come into court and said it's true, he worked for us.
[00:38:11.311 --> 00:38:13.534]  National security has been declared.
[00:38:14.335 --> 00:38:16.457]  Here it is from over a month ago.
[00:38:16.457 --> 00:38:17.058]  Documents.
[00:38:17.058 --> 00:38:20.882]  Fed allegedly allowed a Sinaloa cartel to move cocaine to the U.S.
[00:38:20.882 --> 00:38:22.124]  for information.
[00:38:22.124 --> 00:38:25.368]  That's now since been confirmed in federal court.
[00:38:25.368 --> 00:38:27.671]  The feds have declared national security.
[00:38:27.671 --> 00:38:30.574]  So Sinaloa was hired to knock out competition.
[00:38:30.574 --> 00:38:32.456]  They were laundering their money through the proper banks.
[00:38:33.297 --> 00:38:33.898]  Here's another one.
[00:38:33.898 --> 00:38:38.643]  Taxpayers paid for Fast and Furious plan to arm Sinaloa drug cartel.
[00:38:38.643 --> 00:38:43.548]  So again, it's not just guns directly shipped by ATF Sinaloa.
[00:38:43.548 --> 00:38:52.778]  Sinaloa has been confirmed to be allowed, they're the main cartel along with Texas-Mexico border, to bring in around half of the 500 billion dollars a year in drug money.
[00:38:53.559 --> 00:39:06.406]  The rest of the story is this is like Iran-Contra with the Reagan administration shipping guns down to Central and South America to drug cartels to knock out their competition and then ship the cocaine into the U.S.
[00:39:07.958 --> 00:39:09.999]  Business has always stayed the same.
[00:39:09.999 --> 00:39:16.401]  Eric Holder, who has publicly stated his desire to brainwash the public to think negatively about gun ownership.
[00:39:16.401 --> 00:39:21.683]  And what we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people.
[00:39:21.683 --> 00:39:27.485]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[00:39:27.485 --> 00:39:32.166]  It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[00:39:32.166 --> 00:39:36.728]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[00:39:37.168 --> 00:39:39.609]  About guns in a vastly different way.
[00:39:39.609 --> 00:39:50.773]  Attorney General Lynch is following the modus operandi of her predecessor to a T. She has done absolutely nothing to investigate the executives at HSBC for laundering cartel drug money.
[00:39:50.773 --> 00:39:57.315]  In the words of former Senate investigator Jack Bloom, they took every imaginable form of illegal and illicit business.
[00:39:57.315 --> 00:40:01.496]  Despite the bank's involvement in the largest terrorism and drug money laundering case in U.S.
[00:40:01.496 --> 00:40:05.758]  history, Holder had refused to prosecute any of the HSBC executives.
[00:40:06.238 --> 00:40:11.262]  And according to Holder, the economy would have suffered if any of the bank's leaders faced punishment.
[00:40:11.262 --> 00:40:17.106]  Holder had also refused to prosecute any Wall Street CEOs for their role in the country's financial crisis.
[00:40:17.106 --> 00:40:23.230]  Holder's career will go down as possibly the most criminal ever executed by an Attorney General of the United States.
[00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:32.016]  The fact that Loretta Lynch had to assure the American people that she would not arrest journalists when we already have a First Amendment, granting that protection, is a red flag.
[00:40:32.316 --> 00:40:36.197]  Criminals still run the United States Department of Justice.
[00:40:36.197 --> 00:40:41.479]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:40:41.479 --> 00:40:46.500]  Those are the type of reports that air basically every night during the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:53.142]  7 to 8 o'clock Central Standard Time now on satellite systems stations across North America.
[00:40:53.142 --> 00:40:56.543]  Details at Infowars.com forward slash affiliates.
[00:40:58.302 --> 00:41:02.846]  And we have links at Infowars.com forward slash show as well.
[00:41:02.846 --> 00:41:15.716]  The free video links, audio links, podcast, Droid app, iPhone app, and a lot more.
[00:41:15.716 --> 00:41:21.941]  I'm going to give a brief breakdown to the new Star Wars movie.
[00:41:21.941 --> 00:41:24.643]  I guess you could call it episode seven.
[00:41:28.882 --> 00:41:39.828]  That happens decades after Return of the Jedi and that giant teddy bear advertisement for small children.
[00:41:39.828 --> 00:41:44.571]  Star Wars was new and interesting and original in 1977.
[00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:48.534]  By the early 1980s, it was old hat and total 21st century propaganda.
[00:41:56.582 --> 00:42:01.545]  Selling cheap plastic toys to children.
[00:42:01.545 --> 00:42:06.648]  By 2015, it is something far worse.
[00:42:06.648 --> 00:42:14.672]  Now, the question has been asked by CNN, by World Net Daily, by many others.
[00:42:14.672 --> 00:42:20.515]  Is the new Star Wars anti-white?
[00:42:20.515 --> 00:42:25.118]  And CNN makes a joke out of it and basically says, look at all the hate on Twitter.
[00:42:26.636 --> 00:42:39.446]  Because a couple of different sites affiliated with white nationalists and people said, you know, what is this, a movie with a black guy as the lead in Star Wars?
[00:42:39.446 --> 00:42:45.230]  Star Wars is supposedly a bunch of white people from the 1970s.
[00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:49.874]  And it shows how the population is obsessed with fantasy, not reality.
[00:42:52.045 --> 00:42:58.391]  I mean, this was a story told a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
[00:42:58.391 --> 00:43:00.973]  1977 is a different world from 2015.
[00:43:06.656 --> 00:43:12.902]  And so on its face, having a black lead actor I don't think is anti-white.
[00:43:12.902 --> 00:43:29.797]  But when you look at all the political correctness, where French prosecutors have indicted the presidential front-runner Le Pen for criticizing radical Islam, when Finnish police have been banned from identifying migrants as criminal suspects in the majority of rapes and murders,
[00:43:34.221 --> 00:43:45.444]  When the media won't report when black people attack white people in this country and cover up those statistics, yes, there is an anti-white agenda.
[00:43:45.444 --> 00:43:55.446]  But you can't exaggerate it and project it on to a Disney production of Star Wars.
[00:43:55.446 --> 00:43:56.426]  Now that said,
[00:43:58.581 --> 00:44:02.705]  The anti-white agenda is just an anti-human agenda.
[00:44:02.705 --> 00:44:06.728]  It is a globalist agenda.
[00:44:06.728 --> 00:44:13.735]  But when you drill down into these movies, they're first and foremost about selling toys.
[00:44:13.735 --> 00:44:19.800]  So if you can have, that's where they make 80% of their money in a franchise like Star Wars.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.882]  They've made what, last time I checked,
[00:44:24.204 --> 00:44:26.546]  Four billion off the movies.
[00:44:26.546 --> 00:44:28.788]  Saw a factoid in Time Magazine a year ago.
[00:44:28.788 --> 00:44:29.488]  Was it?
[00:44:29.488 --> 00:44:30.869]  I'm sure it's higher now.
[00:44:30.869 --> 00:44:33.451]  Four billion on the movies.
[00:44:33.451 --> 00:44:35.933]  Ten billion on toys.
[00:44:35.933 --> 00:44:45.220]  And at least another ten billion just on franchise fees for the video games.
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:48.643]  So it's about video games and it's about toys.
[00:44:48.643 --> 00:44:50.004]  And it's about a vehicle.
[00:44:50.004 --> 00:44:52.606]  I'm not saying anything we don't know, but let's be conscious about this.
[00:44:54.431 --> 00:45:06.467]  To have people shell out money for Star Wars video games, Star Wars toys, Star Wars birthday parties, Star Wars lightsabers, all the rest of it.
[00:45:06.467 --> 00:45:08.930]  And sure, some of it's fun, so what?
[00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:10.532]  It's free market.
[00:45:10.532 --> 00:45:12.414]  But Disney separately
[00:45:14.554 --> 00:45:31.518]  Has put out the new Captain America, who's black, and who fights white people who are constitutionalist, Sons of the Serpent, Sons of Liberty, the Culpepper Flag, who go out and attack the poor, innocent migrants coming across the border.
[00:45:31.518 --> 00:45:41.540]  So yes, Disney, that owns ABC and Marvel Comics, is anti-white, is anti-gun, and is beyond leftist, it is totalitarian.
[00:45:43.757 --> 00:45:52.469]  So yes, this is overall part of the rebranding, part of the larger divide and conquer.
[00:45:52.469 --> 00:45:56.816]  So that young black kids can grow up believing they're going to get ahead battling white people.
[00:45:58.257 --> 00:46:06.441]  But never knowing the real threat, institutions like Planned Parenthood, fluoride in the water, poisons in the vaccines, the list goes on and on.
[00:46:06.441 --> 00:46:10.763]  Just type in fluoride, worse for blacks than whites.
[00:46:10.763 --> 00:46:14.304]  You can get all the statistics and numbers on that for yourself.
[00:46:14.304 --> 00:46:19.467]  And that's on average, the physiology.
[00:46:19.467 --> 00:46:23.108]  Now, I'll give you the rest of the story right now.
[00:46:23.108 --> 00:46:26.930]  I think there's also a big backlash on Twitter against this new lead character.
[00:46:29.164 --> 00:46:34.950]  We can put some of those articles on screen for folks.
[00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:47.484]  In the fact that he's bought into it all and come out and said, oh, you don't like having a black lead person in the role, get used to it.
[00:46:47.484 --> 00:46:50.047]  And his name is John Boyega.
[00:46:53.353 --> 00:47:07.100]  Well, there was a big backlash against somebody else in a lead male role, because he obviously wasn't masculine enough and didn't have any presence, and that was Hayden Christensen, who played Anakin Skywalker and then Darth Vader.
[00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:13.563]  I mean, I would have Hayden Christensen play a wimp in a movie, I wouldn't have him play Darth Vader.
[00:47:15.865 --> 00:47:27.490]  See, there wasn't a backlash against having James Earl Jones be the voice of Darth Vader, or Darth Vader being black in color, because it was ominous, there was presence, it all meshed together, it worked.
[00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:35.794]  The real rejection of John Boyega, born in 1992,
[00:47:38.331 --> 00:47:42.152]  Is that he has the classical narcissistic daze look in his eye.
[00:47:42.152 --> 00:47:44.672]  He comes across as about like a five-year-old.
[00:47:44.672 --> 00:47:48.613]  He doesn't have any presence.
[00:47:48.613 --> 00:47:53.394]  And it just makes the movie look like a complete joke.
[00:47:53.394 --> 00:47:58.335]  But he's meant to have 12-year-old kids think he's cool and manly.
[00:47:58.335 --> 00:48:01.175]  Because somebody really manly a little kid doesn't identify with.
[00:48:01.175 --> 00:48:05.456]  When you're 10, you don't identify with a 25-year-old special ops guy.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:11.083]  You identify with a 14-year-old that's a few years older than you and acts tough.
[00:48:11.083 --> 00:48:23.291]  And so you have to understand, this is pure programming to hook young kids, just like they admit Ewoks were meant to sell little girls and little boys millions of fur dolls.
[00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:27.674]  Kenner and George Lucas could not crack the female market.
[00:48:27.674 --> 00:48:35.960]  90% of their market was male, so they made that whole horrible movie, Return of the Jedi, about trying to sell girls Ewoks.
[00:48:36.832 --> 00:48:39.473]  It flopped, no one wanted him.
[00:48:39.473 --> 00:48:50.516]  Just like Jar Jar Binks has a Caribbean black accent, he has gray skin, in episode one, and was a giant flop.
[00:48:50.516 --> 00:48:55.877]  It wasn't because he had an African slash Caribbean accent.
[00:48:55.877 --> 00:48:56.677]  Me likey!
[00:48:56.677 --> 00:49:03.539]  It was because it was ridiculous, it was a stupid character, and you aren't gonna have
[00:49:05.649 --> 00:49:10.051]  Caribbean Islanders a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.
[00:49:10.051 --> 00:49:12.312]  It's just that it's so stupid.
[00:49:12.312 --> 00:49:13.912]  It's so badly done.
[00:49:13.912 --> 00:49:15.653]  It's horrible cinema.
[00:49:15.653 --> 00:49:17.094]  It's disgusting.
[00:49:17.094 --> 00:49:18.494]  It's a failure.
[00:49:18.494 --> 00:49:23.076]  It's a fraud.
[00:49:23.076 --> 00:49:24.677]  That's why people don't like it.
[00:49:24.677 --> 00:49:27.598]  Now, let me give you the rest of the story.
[00:49:27.598 --> 00:49:29.058]  The really rest of the story.
[00:49:29.058 --> 00:49:30.019]  Here's the Washington Post.
[00:49:34.485 --> 00:49:50.619]  And there was an article out on CNN this week where the Pentagon said, yes, we're going to begin making women register with Selective Service for a potential draft.
[00:49:50.619 --> 00:49:54.202]  Military.com, October 14th, just last week.
[00:49:56.397 --> 00:49:57.758]  And that's the rest of the story.
[00:49:57.758 --> 00:50:00.000]  At one level, it's about selling toys.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:08.446]  At another level, if you've got women, and the top bad guy's a woman, the top person battling the bad guy, the heroine, is a woman.
[00:50:08.446 --> 00:50:15.011]  That's so you can sell girls all the action figures and toys as well, but that's only at the money-making level.
[00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:25.760]  The message is approved, because whether it's The Martian or any other new movie you see, there's admitted orders, even in video games like Gamergate, that all heroes and bosses be women.
[00:50:26.707 --> 00:50:34.810]  So whether it's Game of Thrones or whether it's Star Wars or whatever it is, suddenly almost all the bosses and authority figures are women.
[00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:41.632]  That's to hype women in a power trip into believing joining the military is going to empower them and they're going to be the boss.
[00:50:41.632 --> 00:50:48.415]  That's only meant to screw up the military ahead of getting rid of human militaries altogether in the next 20 years and moving to robots.
[00:50:48.875 --> 00:50:59.223]  So women are being used to spike the military, bring it down, at the same time break down civilization and prepare them for the workforce to pay taxes.
[00:50:59.223 --> 00:51:01.965]  This hour of GCN brought to you by LeSic.

[00:51:14.295 --> 00:51:18.258]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S.
[00:51:18.258 --> 00:51:21.340]  politicians argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.901]  Does that sound right to you?

[00:54:07.355 --> 00:54:10.558]  Alright, here's my final comment so far.
[00:54:10.558 --> 00:54:15.242]  I'm going to have to shoot a produced report showing all the documents, all the articles, all the background.
[00:54:15.242 --> 00:54:16.944]  I've shown some of it here if you're a TV viewer.
[00:54:16.944 --> 00:54:23.349]  Radio listeners can just search any term I throw out for yourself.
[00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:28.214]  But bottom line, The Force Awakens is a joke on the public.
[00:54:28.214 --> 00:54:31.477]  But I'm not singling out J.J.
[00:54:31.477 --> 00:54:32.598]  Abrams and Disney.
[00:54:35.316 --> 00:54:42.663]  Everything coming out of mainstream Hollywood is basically weaponized and pointed at you and your family.
[00:54:42.663 --> 00:54:54.053]  I've talked to a lot of high-level directors, producers, and they've said they're not allowed to put good messages in films.
[00:54:54.053 --> 00:54:55.755]  They just don't get funded.
[00:54:55.755 --> 00:54:59.819]  It has to fit into a certain parameter that it's internationally deployed,
[00:55:01.783 --> 00:55:22.328]  That the Chinese accept it, the Chinese government, that it promote globalism, that it promote women not being mothers but working in the system so the state can raise the children, that it stir up racial division in the name of fighting it, and that of course it make huge amounts of money.
[00:55:23.786 --> 00:55:28.613]  But I'll say this, I've been surprised by the writer and director J.J.
[00:55:28.613 --> 00:55:37.425]  Abrams of The Force Awakens in some of his Star Trek remakes that have come out.
[00:55:37.425 --> 00:55:39.669]  I was not really a fan of Star Trek, pretty cheesy.
[00:55:41.633 --> 00:55:44.157]  Overall, you know, some good plots.
[00:55:44.157 --> 00:55:47.321]  I like the old Star Trek from the 60s for entertainment value.
[00:55:47.321 --> 00:55:54.711]  It's the best unintentional comedy in the world with William Shatner, you know, battling the lizard creature.
[00:55:55.983 --> 00:56:08.413]  The fight scene, but the last Star Trek I saw where the government runs a false flag to launch a new war, I mean, you know, that's a good plot.
[00:56:08.413 --> 00:56:11.636]  He almost redeemed himself, George Lucas, with Episode 3.
[00:56:11.636 --> 00:56:20.703]  And he said, I wrote this because of the Iraq War, I changed how Episode 3 goes, and this shows what happened on 9-11.
[00:56:20.703 --> 00:56:22.484]  Well, a criminal group in the government ran 9-11.
[00:56:24.875 --> 00:56:31.196]  The problem was is that the public didn't even understand episode three and they had all these headlines in CNN and others.
[00:56:31.196 --> 00:56:35.937]  I shot reviews of it saying, no one understands episode three.
[00:56:35.937 --> 00:56:37.378]  The plot doesn't make sense.
[00:56:37.378 --> 00:56:40.138]  It makes perfect sense.
[00:56:40.138 --> 00:56:47.380]  A criminal in government that wants to become a dictator stages terror attacks against his home planet, making himself the victim and the hero.
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:54.501]  He gets dictatorial power out of the strike and then takes out the old republic, claiming that they were part of a plan to overthrow the government.
[00:56:56.687 --> 00:56:58.948]  It's what you've seen happen, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:58.948 --> 00:57:08.833]  And George Lucas told the Cannes Film Festival, when it was being released a few years after 9-11, that indeed this is what he believed happened on 9-11.
[00:57:08.833 --> 00:57:11.734]  What an incredible statement!
[00:57:11.734 --> 00:57:17.717]  And as bad as George Lucas is, it looks like, though, Disney's getting ready to do an even worse job with the franchise.
[00:57:17.717 --> 00:57:19.358]  So it's very saddening.
[00:57:19.358 --> 00:57:24.080]  I will go see it to analyze the propaganda, but it's just meant to sell toys and get women in the military.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.505]  And to get blacks to join the military.
[00:57:28.505 --> 00:57:31.190]  So they can go arm Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:34.014]  It's a pretty sickening spectacle of mind control.
[00:57:34.014 --> 00:57:35.717]  And I hope folks are smart enough to pick up on it.
[00:57:35.717 --> 00:57:36.559]  I'm sure you are.
[00:57:36.559 --> 00:57:37.721]  I'm done for now talking about it.
[00:57:40.345 --> 00:57:42.566]  Super Mill Vitality is back in stock.
[00:57:42.566 --> 00:57:44.766]  It is amazing what it's done for myself.
[00:57:44.766 --> 00:57:47.547]  It has close to a five star review.
[00:57:47.547 --> 00:57:52.808]  It was like 4.5, 4.6, 4.7 depending on the average of the day.
[00:57:52.808 --> 00:57:55.709]  It is back in stock now and will ship directly out to you and your family.
[00:57:55.709 --> 00:57:57.930]  Your purchase supports the broadcast.
[00:57:58.790 --> 00:58:09.557]  We also have a lot of amazing other products like Survival Shield, Nacinide, Nacinide on X2, Brain Force, which is the healthy, focused energy pill that I take every day.
[00:58:09.557 --> 00:58:11.698]  I mean, if I'm especially tired, take one.
[00:58:11.698 --> 00:58:12.318]  Boom!
[00:58:12.318 --> 00:58:15.060]  Massive amounts of good, clean energy.
[00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:17.562]  Brain Force is available as well.
[00:58:17.562 --> 00:58:23.805]  Knockout, which is, again, an amazing sleep aid, and I remember to take it, has nine different healthy compounds.
[00:58:23.805 --> 00:58:28.108]  Not just melatonin and valerian root, it all works synergistically, and it's less than half

[01:00:06.115 --> 01:00:07.877]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.877 --> 01:00:09.639]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:11.241]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:12.783]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.783 --> 01:00:16.967]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.967 --> 01:00:21.032]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.817 --> 01:00:31.283]  He's set to join us via satellite uplink in full living color from his TV studios in South Texas.
[01:00:31.283 --> 01:00:36.047]  Former Congressman Ron Paul is set to join us coming up.
[01:00:36.047 --> 01:00:41.912]  We're going to talk about the economy, the situation in Syria, and a lot more.
[01:00:41.912 --> 01:00:45.795]  Netanyahu has caused a big uproar by linking Palestinians to the Holocaust.
[01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:52.622]  You know, I think the Holocaust does get overused to push political agendas.
[01:00:52.622 --> 01:00:58.303]  I mean, if you won't turn your guns in, the ADL will come out and call you an anti-Semite.
[01:00:58.303 --> 01:01:06.846]  But you really can link the Grand Mufti, the Grand Imam of Jerusalem in World War II to the Nazis.
[01:01:06.846 --> 01:01:10.186]  I mean, he went to Germany, they traveled there, he was buddies with Hitler.
[01:01:10.186 --> 01:01:12.167]  He did encourage Hitler to kill all the Jews.
[01:01:13.274 --> 01:01:14.814]  That is a fact.
[01:01:14.814 --> 01:01:24.756]  The rest of the story is there were also some rich, powerful Jewish organizations that wouldn't let Jews get out of Germany or Europe without paying them protection money that they then shared with the Nazis.
[01:01:24.756 --> 01:01:41.779]  And then Roosevelt, praised by so many Jewish groups, wouldn't let the Jewish migrants, true refugees, political persecution, get into the United States in 39, 40, 41, 42 when their ships would show up in New York City at Ellis Island.
[01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:51.902]  So, the truth is, you can link the Nazis to a bunch of the founders of Israel.
[01:01:51.902 --> 01:01:55.205]  And there have been Jewish professors that have written articles about this.
[01:01:55.205 --> 01:02:00.210]  And boy, you raise this with a white supremacist, this is the thing that will make them the maddest.
[01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:03.514]  Because Hitler good, Jews bad.
[01:02:03.514 --> 01:02:05.316]  Hitler God, Jews the devil.
[01:02:07.318 --> 01:02:12.883]  I mean, look at George Soros.
[01:02:12.883 --> 01:02:27.715]  He was 13, 14, 15, 16 years old during the four years of World War II, helping ferret out and round up Jews, and he knew how they hid their money and what they did for bosses above him who were Jewish, and then he was protected.
[01:02:29.485 --> 01:02:34.587]  The truth is the Jewish Mafia, and that's why Dr. Steve Pachinik hates the Jewish Mafia so much.
[01:02:34.587 --> 01:02:36.548]  His family barely got out of Russia.
[01:02:36.548 --> 01:02:40.490]  Some of them got killed in the Holocaust.
[01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:43.311]  And of course his family told him about how they weren't allowed into the U.S.
[01:02:43.311 --> 01:02:46.912]  They had to go to Cuba when he was a little kid during World War II.
[01:02:48.686 --> 01:02:51.527]  He's told that story before, and I mean, that's just a fact.
[01:02:51.527 --> 01:02:53.427]  It's not just his story.
[01:02:53.427 --> 01:03:00.849]  That's why you get a lot of academic Jews and people that they call self-hating Jews, who aren't the leftist type.
[01:03:00.849 --> 01:03:03.110]  There's that type too that's self-hating.
[01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:12.692]  There's more of a populist or right-wing Jew who doesn't like some of the folks that founded Israel because, well, they killed their family.
[01:03:12.692 --> 01:03:14.193]  They helped the Nazis kill their families.
[01:03:15.464 --> 01:03:21.348]  And then sit there and play the part of the victims of it while they sat out on the sidelines.
[01:03:21.348 --> 01:03:28.573]  Hitler, of course, was going to work to, when he took over Russia, to make an area of southern Russia the new Israel.
[01:03:28.573 --> 01:03:34.216]  And Hitler was also looking to ship the Jews to Palestine, which he saw as their homeland.
[01:03:34.216 --> 01:03:40.220]  That's why he met with the Grand Mufti, who said, no, we don't want them here.
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:41.061]  Can you just kill them?
[01:03:41.966 --> 01:03:48.852]  And the last few years of World War II, Hitler did actually, because I've read the Pulitzer Prize winning books on the subject.
[01:03:48.852 --> 01:03:53.456]  I mean, these are quotes by Hitler to go ahead with the final solution.
[01:03:53.456 --> 01:04:06.247]  They didn't decide to go with the final solution until Hitler started losing at the beginning of the Battle of Leningrad and then Stalingrad.
[01:04:07.793 --> 01:04:15.037]  There was a tank battle south of that city about six months before where the Germans started to really think they were going to lose, started building towards that.
[01:04:15.037 --> 01:04:23.161]  So then it shifted, don't shake the Jews down and get their money through the Jewish handlers that Hitler was working with.
[01:04:23.161 --> 01:04:25.883]  Just go ahead and kill them.
[01:04:25.883 --> 01:04:27.944]  And so they went to a policy of killing everybody.
[01:04:27.944 --> 01:04:30.445]  And of course they were killing a bunch of other groups.
[01:04:30.445 --> 01:04:35.928]  It is true that it's wrong that Hollywood only focuses on Jews that were killed.
[01:04:35.928 --> 01:04:36.489]  I mean, I think
[01:04:37.873 --> 01:04:43.720]  Millions of Ukrainians killed by the Nazis, millions of Russians, I think millions of Poles killed.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.124]  I think they're just as valuable as Jewish people that were killed.
[01:04:46.124 --> 01:04:52.892]  But, on the other side of that equation, there's people that defend Hitler, when, I mean, Hitler was a complete out-of-control lunatic.
[01:04:52.892 --> 01:04:55.015]  I mean, just look at him, listen to him.
[01:04:55.015 --> 01:04:56.056]  I mean, look what he did to Germany.
[01:04:59.468 --> 01:05:05.519]  It was 30 years ago in 1985 that Doc and Marty went back another 30 years to 1955.
[01:05:05.519 --> 01:05:08.725]  Then, they went back to the future, to today.
[01:05:08.725 --> 01:05:10.889]  Where we're going, we don't need roads.
[01:05:12.808 --> 01:05:16.312]  Well, there's no flying cars, and it isn't the roads they say we don't need.
[01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:19.255]  They tell us where we're going, there won't be any drivers.
[01:05:19.255 --> 01:05:26.522]  And there's no hoverboards or self-lacing shoes, but at least we're not plagued with fax machines.
[01:05:26.522 --> 01:05:32.148]  You may just need a lightning strike for power, since Obama and the EPA are trying to shut down most of the power plants.
[01:05:34.952 --> 01:05:39.315]  But the movie's future resembles the present in a couple of very strange ways.
[01:05:39.315 --> 01:05:51.642]  The Cubs got in the World Series, and even stranger... Discover how, in 1979, Biff successfully lobbied to legalize gambling and turned Hill Valley's dilapidated courthouse into a beautiful casino hotel.
[01:05:51.642 --> 01:05:53.043]  I just want to say one thing.
[01:05:53.043 --> 01:05:54.444]  God bless America.
[01:05:54.444 --> 01:05:56.125]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:05:58.897 --> 01:06:02.858]  Secret 12, InfoWarsLife's vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:09.160]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:16.462]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:06:16.462 --> 01:06:25.244]  InfoWarsLife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[01:06:25.564 --> 01:06:31.730]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:36.575]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[01:06:36.575 --> 01:06:40.158]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth, right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[01:06:40.158 --> 01:06:42.060]  No needles, no injections.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:43.702]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:06:43.702 --> 01:06:44.903]  Try it for yourself.
[01:06:44.903 --> 01:06:45.984]  Discover the secret, Secret 12.

[01:06:58.624 --> 01:07:07.713]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:07.713 --> 01:07:16.121]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:16.121 --> 01:07:20.785]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:20.985 --> 01:07:27.769]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:27.769 --> 01:07:34.953]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:34.953 --> 01:07:41.977]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:41.977 --> 01:07:46.459]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:07:46.459 --> 01:07:49.661]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:07:49.841 --> 01:07:52.805]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:33.757 --> 01:08:35.198]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[01:08:35.198 --> 01:08:41.060]  Thank you so much for joining us on this October 21st, 2015 worldwide broadcast.
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:46.022]  We're now eight minutes plus into the second hour today.
[01:08:46.022 --> 01:08:54.885]  There is so much I want to ask former Congressman and of course Medical Doctor Ron Paul about what's happening currently in our world.
[01:08:54.885 --> 01:08:56.446]  The race for the Speakership.
[01:08:57.186 --> 01:09:09.575]  The Tea Party Rebellion that he and others helped create, the situation in Syria, the rapidly degrading economy, but also political persecution.
[01:09:09.575 --> 01:09:11.456]  And I wanted to cover this first.
[01:09:11.456 --> 01:09:18.541]  Ted Cruz came out and said that he's worried about Internet freedom, that there's major talk about censoring the Internet in the Senate.
[01:09:19.701 --> 01:09:34.052]  Matt Drudge was on with us, giving us an exclusive interview a few weeks ago, saying that he talked face-to-face with a Supreme Court Justice at dinner that said they've got the votes, they're coming to restrict free speech next year.
[01:09:34.052 --> 01:09:40.977]  Hillary has now announced that if she's elected, she will try for a national gun buyback and a repeal of the Second Amendment.
[01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:42.538]  That's actually a quote.
[01:09:42.538 --> 01:09:45.280]  So the statements are very bold right now.
[01:09:46.121 --> 01:09:52.606]  And we're seeing a massive continued IRS persecution of conservative and libertarian groups.
[01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:56.369]  I wanted to not so much ask Ron Paul his view of this.
[01:09:56.369 --> 01:09:58.050]  I mean, I want to do that.
[01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:00.272]  I also wanted to ask him what we should do.
[01:10:00.272 --> 01:10:07.478]  I mean, I think it shows how effective the Liberty Movement is, that the system wants to silence us.
[01:10:07.478 --> 01:10:10.880]  But at the same time, I think we have to address this.
[01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:21.366]  And really discuss how we're supposed to respond to it, because Matt Drudge said he's been told by high-level government folks the persecution's about to kick into high gear.
[01:10:21.366 --> 01:10:24.267]  He visited me two weeks ago to deliver that message.
[01:10:24.267 --> 01:10:26.869]  A lot of other high-level people are telling me the same thing.
[01:10:26.869 --> 01:10:31.551]  I know with your context, sir, you must be getting the same intel, so can you speak to this?
[01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:37.274]  I mean, in Europe, they're arresting Germans that criticize open borders.
[01:10:37.274 --> 01:10:41.376]  It's not just here, but totalitarianism seems to be spreading its wings.
[01:10:45.094 --> 01:10:52.482]  You know, when I left Congress a couple years ago, I listed several things that I thought were the greatest danger to us.
[01:10:52.482 --> 01:10:56.266]  And the top one was freedom of expression, the First Amendment.
[01:10:56.266 --> 01:11:04.535]  Because if we're not allowed to express ourselves, it makes it so difficult for us to compete with the propagandas from our government and from the media.
[01:11:04.535 --> 01:11:06.818]  So I think that it is crucial.
[01:11:07.518 --> 01:11:22.955]  But you know, we are so hypocritical when it comes to our government because they pretend that we should support the issue of knowing the truth and knowing what's going on with government and we even write laws to protect the whistleblowers who are telling us the truth.
[01:11:24.116 --> 01:11:31.078]  But now we have numerous whistleblowers that are put in prison, you know, if they tell the truth.
[01:11:31.078 --> 01:11:39.481]  Matter of fact, the real irony is, is the chairman of the agency that's supposed to be in charge of protecting all the whistleblowers, he got fired.
[01:11:39.781 --> 01:11:44.622]  Because he told the truth about the whistleblower program, it really doesn't work.
[01:11:44.622 --> 01:12:03.806]  Now this is getting worse, and there's a lot going on right now, but you know, just recently when we read about the death of Ernest Schiff, he was actually in prison and killed by our government because he spoke out about the unconstitutionality of the way taxes were being collected.
[01:12:03.806 --> 01:12:07.587]  And it wasn't so much that he was not a violent person, he wasn't for
[01:12:07.847 --> 01:12:14.229]  Anarchy or anything else, and I don't think he ever said the statement that there should be no taxes either.
[01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:33.153]  But, because he said what the government was doing was unconstitutional, and the government told him, you're not allowed to talk about that, and he did, and when he was 77 they put him in jail for 14 more years and literally, I think, killed him, you know, because it was a death sentence and it was a life sentence and he didn't get his medical care.
[01:12:33.153 --> 01:12:35.414]  So that's how ruthless the government is.
[01:12:35.794 --> 01:12:39.038]  Now, Erwin Schiff, I think, is a good lesson, because what was he saying?
[01:12:39.038 --> 01:12:43.823]  He was challenging the financing of a government that's run away.
[01:12:43.823 --> 01:12:55.476]  So the same way, if somebody tells us the truth about what's going on in the Middle East, and how we have involved ourselves in these wars illegally, and lied ourselves into these wars, our presidents have,
[01:12:56.056 --> 01:12:57.617]  Uh, you know, they can't tolerate that.
[01:12:57.617 --> 01:13:00.558]  They cannot tolerate the truth about our foreign policy.
[01:13:00.558 --> 01:13:05.740]  They cannot tolerate the truth about why they are ruthless in collecting taxes.
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:09.861]  And they're not going to tolerate the truth about how the Federal Reserve is run.
[01:13:09.861 --> 01:13:16.264]  That's why I always believed that the Federal Reserve, if everybody knew about it, and more people know about it now than
[01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:17.544]  Ever before.
[01:13:17.544 --> 01:13:20.886]  If the people knew about it, they wouldn't support the Federal Reserve.
[01:13:20.886 --> 01:13:23.427]  And fortunately, there's a lot of people waking up.
[01:13:23.427 --> 01:13:24.947]  But so much is done in secret.
[01:13:24.947 --> 01:13:26.788]  The bailouts are done in secret.
[01:13:26.788 --> 01:13:29.169]  So it's secret government that is the real issue.
[01:13:29.169 --> 01:13:35.272]  And when you talk about the ultimate secrets of government, then you become an enemy of the state.
[01:13:35.272 --> 01:13:40.354]  And when you have an empire, truth is treason in the empire of lies.
[01:13:40.354 --> 01:13:43.435]  And right now, people are considered treasonous.
[01:13:43.875 --> 01:13:47.978]  If they start telling us the plain truth about what our government's doing to us.
[01:13:47.978 --> 01:13:48.599]  That's right.
[01:13:48.599 --> 01:13:52.522]  RonPaulLibertyReport.com, one of many powerful sites.
[01:13:52.522 --> 01:13:57.506]  He's doing syndicated radio vignettes, daily television, reaching millions of people.
[01:13:57.506 --> 01:14:01.309]  And that's why they're coming in and wanting to censor and wanting to control and wanting...
[01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:05.452]  to shut down competition because we're peacefully taking action.
[01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:35.612]  You know, you were told don't sell this book anymore.
[01:14:35.612 --> 01:14:37.834]  You were told don't give speeches anymore.
[01:14:37.834 --> 01:14:40.215]  So I'm going to send you to prison for the maximum sentence.
[01:14:40.215 --> 01:14:49.882]  So they admittedly sent him to prison and then killed him in prison, as you said, Ron Paul, and you're a medical doctor speaking to this, for his speech.
[01:14:49.882 --> 01:14:59.808]  And that's where America has gotten to, where I've now had feds contact me, multiple feds, and tell me that the word is, I shut up or they're going to set me up.
[01:14:59.808 --> 01:15:01.610]  And that's where this country's come to.
[01:15:02.731 --> 01:15:05.093]  And it's very, very sad.
[01:15:05.093 --> 01:15:07.997]  Specifically, though, solutions.
[01:15:07.997 --> 01:15:18.949]  What do we do, sir, in the face of this if they do try to declare some civil emergency, if there's some false flags like OKC blamed on patriots?
[01:15:19.429 --> 01:15:22.871]  We're trying to fix this peacefully, and I think we're winning peacefully as well.
[01:15:22.871 --> 01:15:27.234]  They're escalating, but what do we do if they start World War III with the Russians?
[01:15:27.234 --> 01:15:33.777]  What do we do if they start federalizing the state houses that we know the Defense Department's been tasked to prepare to do?
[01:15:33.777 --> 01:15:40.121]  What do we do when truth becomes stranger than fiction and they become nakedly tyrannical against us?
[01:15:43.595 --> 01:15:55.283]  Well, when it's domestic, and they are at us all the time, I don't advocate violence, as a matter of fact, for moral reasons, but for practical reasons.
[01:15:55.283 --> 01:15:57.404]  They have way more guns than we have.
[01:15:57.404 --> 01:16:01.227]  But also know that truth can win out in the end.
[01:16:01.587 --> 01:16:05.369]  So it's getting the message out, whether it's your program or what I do and others.
[01:16:05.369 --> 01:16:07.331]  There's more now than ever before.
[01:16:07.331 --> 01:16:18.517]  So I think the most important regulation or law that we have to protect is our right to use the Internet and do our programming.
[01:16:18.517 --> 01:16:22.059]  And this is being systematically attacked.
[01:16:22.059 --> 01:16:28.543]  It's being attacked not only by our own governments and sometimes corporate interests, who knows, but sometimes it's international.
[01:16:28.543 --> 01:16:29.284]  But if we
[01:16:29.684 --> 01:16:31.305]  If we don't lose that, that's going to be very bad.
[01:16:31.305 --> 01:16:36.707]  I happen to be optimistic about that, although I'm not technically, you know, astute to how it works.
[01:16:36.707 --> 01:16:39.468]  But I think we'll get around it.
[01:16:39.468 --> 01:16:41.409]  I think the Internet's too big.
[01:16:41.409 --> 01:16:46.732]  So education is it to expose and counteract the propaganda.
[01:16:46.732 --> 01:16:55.536]  Almost always the people don't want war and then they get talked into it because they're told that you were going to be attacked and if you don't support us you're unpatriotic and you're un-American.
[01:16:55.956 --> 01:16:59.277]  But just think on the issue of Syria right now.
[01:16:59.277 --> 01:17:07.979]  They changed the Prime Minister in Canada because Canada got too cozy with sending planes over there and fighting and participating in our foreign policy.
[01:17:07.979 --> 01:17:13.301]  In the same way when the American people spoke out a couple years ago when Obama wanted to bomb
[01:17:13.781 --> 01:17:18.443]  Uh, Syria, the people said no, but Obama, of course, went ahead and did it anyway.
[01:17:18.443 --> 01:17:28.246]  And the British people spoke out, which was a very historic event a couple years ago, and voted against giving the authority to their Prime Minister to go ahead.
[01:17:28.246 --> 01:17:29.746]  So the people are with us.
[01:17:29.746 --> 01:17:40.310]  Our job is to reach these people, and of course this is where I do become a bit optimistic about what's happening, because I think the young people realize that we're in an economic crisis.
[01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:42.971]  I think they know there's something very suspicious going on with our
[01:17:45.912 --> 01:18:04.599]  Our foreign policy as well as the Federal Reserve and the financing and they like personal liberty and they like the internet and I just think the answers that we can find in a free society and sound money is so great and all we have to do is get enough believers and the government will change.
[01:18:04.599 --> 01:18:07.059]  The government is a reflection of the people's attitude.
[01:18:07.059 --> 01:18:08.420]  Right now the attitude is still
[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:14.585]  A lot of people are getting welfare, and a lot of people are talked into supporting the military-industrial complex.
[01:18:14.585 --> 01:18:20.011]  But we're running out of money, and this is good, because what are they going to do?
[01:18:20.011 --> 01:18:21.712]  They have to change their mind.
[01:18:21.712 --> 01:18:28.479]  As long as they think there's a handout, whether it's the rich or the poor, they're going to keep doing that, and they're going to keep milking the middle class.
[01:18:28.479 --> 01:18:30.701]  And the middle class just keeps shrinking and shrinking.
[01:18:31.121 --> 01:18:50.167]  So, we are winning this for practical reasons, but we still have a long way to go, and it's education, it's learning to help and get people to have confidence that a free society is not only a better society, it's more peaceful and there's more prosperity, and that is what people have to vote for.
[01:18:50.167 --> 01:19:00.670]  Even if there's a point of resistance, I said I'm against the use of violence to counteract the government, but I'm not opposed to people just going on strike and saying, look, I've had enough of this, I'm not going to participate.
[01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:18.244]  But that's rough too, because you have to suffer the consequence of this, and that is peaceful resistance, and I'm not even sure where I would come down on that under certain circumstances, but that's ultimately the way laws get changed, is a resistant movement supported by the people,
[01:19:18.604 --> 01:19:23.706]  And our Congress, on occasion, will respond when they know there's enough Americans who said enough is enough.
[01:19:23.706 --> 01:19:29.628]  Of course, that's what the battle is right now in Washington, is there's an outcry from the people about Washington.
[01:19:29.628 --> 01:19:33.369]  Still, they don't know how to handle it, and they won't change their tune.
[01:19:33.369 --> 01:19:39.611]  And it's led by Republican and Democratic leaders, and yet there's a core of people now in Washington that said enough is enough.
[01:19:40.464 --> 01:19:48.269]  I totally agree with you and we're reaching that historic crossroads right now where the social engineers admit they're losing the hearts and minds.
[01:19:48.269 --> 01:19:57.176]  They're trying to accelerate their program and they're looking for that line in the sand to push us so hard we start getting violent.
[01:19:57.176 --> 01:20:00.398]  I agree violence is not the answer offensively.
[01:20:00.398 --> 01:20:07.103]  Obviously defensively we have a right to protect ourselves but the good news is I talked to a lot of government people and others.
[01:20:07.103 --> 01:20:08.524]  They're awake to what's happening.
[01:20:09.504 --> 01:20:17.308]  What do you think the establishment's going to do to try to use the crisis they've helped exacerbate to even bring in more tyranny?
[01:20:17.308 --> 01:20:24.011]  Because you've always talked about this key time coming when big government implodes.
[01:20:24.011 --> 01:20:25.932]  Their answer will be more government.
[01:20:25.932 --> 01:20:29.754]  What do we do at this key juncture to make sure people understand the truth?
[01:20:32.816 --> 01:20:37.737]  Well, it is still back to education and the various methods of doing that.
[01:20:37.737 --> 01:20:42.638]  But if it comes, if push comes to shove and there's violence in the street, they're going to look for a strong man.
[01:20:42.638 --> 01:20:48.280]  They're going to look for somebody who's authoritarian and said, well, the violence in the cities won't last.
[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:50.860]  And then people will say, yeah, that's right.
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.521]  We can't have anarchy.
[01:20:52.521 --> 01:20:54.041]  And they'll capitulate.
[01:20:54.341 --> 01:21:09.665]  But they will come, and you know, the gun control issue is alive and well, and I'm for gun control, I'm for taking the guns away from the bureaucrats, the government, and taking the guns, or restricting the gun use, and the President's starting wars.
[01:21:09.665 --> 01:21:20.067]  But no, they will come, and that will be, if there is a confiscation or more registration, people are going to have to make up their mind whether they're going to not participate in that.
[01:21:20.347 --> 01:21:21.328]  Same way with gold.
[01:21:21.328 --> 01:21:27.591]  Gold, guns protect us physically, and gold is real money, so when they destroy money, gold has always been the haven.
[01:21:27.591 --> 01:21:30.152]  It's not something I've invented, nor you invented.
[01:21:30.152 --> 01:21:38.416]  It's been around for 6,000 years where real money is gold, and even though Bernanke told me, sorry Ron, gold is no longer money.
[01:21:38.416 --> 01:21:39.436]  Gold is still money.
[01:21:39.436 --> 01:21:40.557]  So what are you going to do?
[01:21:40.557 --> 01:21:45.800]  Are you going to say, you know, are we going to be complacent like we were, the American people were in the 1930s?
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:49.362]  Roosevelt comes in and says, all right, we've got to take over.
[01:21:49.362 --> 01:21:53.767]  Turn in all your gold at $20 an ounce.
[01:21:53.767 --> 01:21:54.647]  And look at what that did.
[01:21:54.647 --> 01:21:57.630]  It took us a lot of years to get the right to own gold again.
[01:21:57.630 --> 01:22:03.636]  So they may not come and try to collect the gold, but I think what they'll try to do is tax the gold.
[01:22:03.976 --> 01:22:27.878]  Just remember the first attack on trying to regulate drugs was to put a huge tax on marijuana, and that morphed into this horrendous drug war that's going on, which is such an excuse for the violation of our liberties, along with the excuse we've got to collect taxes because you're un-American if you don't pay your fair share, and that's why the tax authorities get out of hand.
[01:22:28.839 --> 01:22:38.263]  We probably don't have much time left, but Lewis Lerner is a typical example of how they use a tax laws and to punish those of us who are speaking out.
[01:22:38.263 --> 01:22:40.964]  That is a typical example of curtailing free speech.
[01:22:40.964 --> 01:22:46.066]  At least she was caught and she's out of it, but that attitude still remains.
[01:22:46.066 --> 01:22:46.766]  It certainly does.
[01:22:46.766 --> 01:22:57.111]  In the few minutes we've got left, looking at this election, looking at Rand Paul, looking at how he's really the only candidate that isn't for expanding the war in Syria.
[01:22:59.424 --> 01:23:02.343]  What is your view on the Russian entry into Syria?
[01:23:06.394 --> 01:23:09.155]  Well, I look at it in a practical way.
[01:23:09.155 --> 01:23:11.856]  I look for what our policy should be.
[01:23:11.856 --> 01:23:16.178]  We shouldn't have been in there and we should leave, and then that leaves it up to the neighborhood to take care of it.
[01:23:16.178 --> 01:23:32.745]  We're in 152 countries, and if we're saying, okay, we gotta watch out, we gotta be terrified, and we have to do anything we can to stop the Russians exerting their program, which is next to their border, whether it's Ukraine or whether it's Syria.
[01:23:34.486 --> 01:23:41.033]  They have a treaty with one country, with one base, and I think they have one aircraft carrier.
[01:23:41.033 --> 01:23:42.854]  So they want to keep that base.
[01:23:42.854 --> 01:23:45.397]  So I would say that's more their business.
[01:23:45.397 --> 01:23:50.562]  And I sort of get a charge out of the fact that Kerry says, oh, those Russians are not too smart.
[01:23:50.562 --> 01:23:52.524]  They're going to get bogged down in Syria.
[01:23:52.884 --> 01:23:53.805]  Well, maybe so.
[01:23:53.805 --> 01:23:55.946]  If they do, maybe it'll be like Afghanistan.
[01:23:55.946 --> 01:23:59.048]  But why should we blag ourselves?
[01:23:59.048 --> 01:24:02.530]  How could it be any worse than what we're doing to ourselves?
[01:24:02.530 --> 01:24:13.077]  So I would let Russia and the Turks and the Kurds and these other people be involved and take care of it.
[01:24:13.077 --> 01:24:15.038]  And maybe if we withdrew some of our
[01:24:15.498 --> 01:24:20.801]  Financial and military support over there, maybe Saudi Arabia wouldn't be so aggressive.
[01:24:20.801 --> 01:24:25.964]  Maybe they'd have to deal with Yemen all by themselves.
[01:24:25.964 --> 01:24:32.867]  That whole area would become more peaceful and they would work on things much more peacefully.
[01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:43.593]  But I don't think that if we compare Russia exerting themselves to protect one naval base outside their country compared to us being in 152 countries and being the
[01:24:45.695 --> 01:24:50.059]  Assuming the role of a total policeman of the world, no comparison.
[01:24:50.059 --> 01:24:51.961]  RonPaulLibertyReport.com.
[01:24:51.961 --> 01:24:54.003]  One final question on the election.
[01:24:54.003 --> 01:24:59.068]  Obviously I'm supporting Rand Paul because I know he's followed the Constitution.
[01:24:59.068 --> 01:25:00.129]  He won't flip-flop.
[01:25:00.569 --> 01:25:02.270]  I like the other candidates.
[01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:04.692]  Obviously, I like a lot of what Donald Trump has to say.
[01:25:04.692 --> 01:25:18.923]  It's very populist, it's very constitutional in some cases, but he said things about, you know, loving Hillary in the past and being for assault weapons bans, so I don't really trust him in the final equation, but what is your view of Donald Trump overall?
[01:25:18.923 --> 01:25:23.046]  Do you think he's healthy for the campaign, healthy for the debate, or do you think he's unhealthy?
[01:25:26.923 --> 01:25:35.249]  Well, if there was an absolute guarantee that the American people wouldn't be sucked in and make him president, you know, it'd be just entertainment.
[01:25:35.249 --> 01:25:38.831]  And we would look at, like you point out, some good things, some bad things.
[01:25:38.831 --> 01:25:46.296]  You could look at the good things and say, you know, he can do things and get away with which many of us never could do.
[01:25:46.296 --> 01:25:53.861]  But he's a powerful personality and he makes fun of the political process in the Republican and Democratic Party.
[01:25:53.861 --> 01:25:56.743]  At the same time, he doesn't get pushed around with the media.
[01:25:57.243 --> 01:26:06.247]  But I think trouble is coming and he would have to live up to his word.
[01:26:06.247 --> 01:26:08.148]  I will take charge.
[01:26:08.148 --> 01:26:09.549]  I will get things done.
[01:26:09.549 --> 01:26:10.789]  I know what's good.
[01:26:10.789 --> 01:26:11.710]  I'm not looking for that.
[01:26:11.710 --> 01:26:15.671]  That to me is exactly the opposite of a libertarian society.
[01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:17.612]  I don't want to tell people what to do.
[01:26:17.612 --> 01:26:18.833]  I don't want to run the economy.
[01:26:18.833 --> 01:26:20.533]  I don't want to tell the world what to do.
[01:26:20.533 --> 01:26:23.895]  I want to deliver the liberty back to the individual at the individual.
[01:26:24.335 --> 01:26:32.020]  And local people take care of these problems, but I don't think Donald Trump would respond to that as the conditions break down.
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:41.927]  I think he would use not only the bully pulpit, I think he'd become a very tough bully to take over just the whole situation.
[01:26:42.347 --> 01:26:47.271]  He does look ready to get on a big white horse, and that is exactly what this country doesn't need.
[01:26:47.271 --> 01:26:56.339]  And I think people's support for him shows the backlash against teleprompter politics, and I think that's the real issue there.
[01:26:56.339 --> 01:27:01.123]  Former Congressman Ron Paul, thank you so much for the time, and just please continue your great work.
[01:27:04.977 --> 01:27:06.118]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:27:06.118 --> 01:27:06.438]  You bet.
[01:27:06.438 --> 01:27:06.798]  Take care.
[01:27:06.798 --> 01:27:09.140]  There goes former Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.822]  About a second delay there on the feed.
[01:27:11.822 --> 01:27:18.528]  We, again, really appreciate the work he's done and the work you've done supporting him.
[01:27:18.528 --> 01:27:29.777]  He ran for office three times and failed all three, but succeeded in becoming a focal point to help build a liberty movement to challenge the globalists.
[01:27:29.777 --> 01:27:32.399]  And that's the real value of what's happened.
[01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:34.590]  Rand Paul isn't perfect.
[01:27:34.590 --> 01:27:35.230]  I'm not perfect.
[01:27:35.230 --> 01:27:36.531]  Nobody's perfect.
[01:27:36.531 --> 01:27:40.812]  But we do want to restore this republic.
[01:27:40.812 --> 01:27:43.052]  And people want confidence.
[01:27:43.052 --> 01:27:46.573]  They want to hear somebody that tells it like it is.
[01:27:46.573 --> 01:27:52.955]  And I hope that Donald Trump is for real.
[01:27:52.955 --> 01:27:55.355]  But I know one thing's for sure.
[01:27:55.355 --> 01:27:57.716]  This is not a boring time to be alive.
[01:27:57.716 --> 01:28:01.437]  We've got front row seats now.
[01:28:01.437 --> 01:28:02.377]  Going into the future.
[01:28:04.983 --> 01:28:08.306]  And we're going to see exactly what is going to happen.
[01:28:08.306 --> 01:28:09.967]  We will find out.
[01:28:09.967 --> 01:28:14.191]  And of course I make that statement about front row seats for a reason.
[01:28:14.191 --> 01:28:18.795]  We've become a nation and a world of spectators.
[01:28:18.795 --> 01:28:23.399]  And people need to do a little less spectating and a little more action.
[01:28:23.399 --> 01:28:29.284]  It really frightens me in a good way, in a humbling way.
[01:28:29.284 --> 01:28:31.566]  When I realized this radio slash TV show
[01:28:32.856 --> 01:28:39.800]  Has the power to change legislation, to put issues out there, to sometimes win debates, to sometimes change history.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:47.985]  It makes me sit back in front of this chair and the ominous responsibility knowing I reach tens of millions of people a week.
[01:28:47.985 --> 01:28:53.368]  And I just think to myself, you know, you better do a good job, buddy, because this is for all the marbles.
[01:28:53.368 --> 01:29:01.113]  Then I think about the arrogant establishment types who just want the power of being famous and just want the money.
[01:29:02.375 --> 01:29:18.607]  And are just puppets who let their teleprompters be loaded full of disinformation, who go out there with their polished talking points and regurgitate them over and over again onto the faces and heads of the American people.
[01:29:18.607 --> 01:29:24.992]  And all the numbers show that program of regurgitation is causing a massive backlash.
[01:29:24.992 --> 01:29:28.295]  I haven't gotten to James Woods countering Bernie Sanders in his tweets.
[01:29:30.618 --> 01:29:33.521]  Bernie Sanders endorsed communist China and how great they treat women.
[01:29:33.521 --> 01:29:35.262]  I'm not kidding.
[01:29:35.262 --> 01:29:41.007]  And he said they have such great infant care and great family leave.
[01:29:41.007 --> 01:29:47.172]  It's like endorsing British health care, UK health care, National Health Service and saying we need that here.
[01:29:47.172 --> 01:29:49.074]  Americans have never been over there under it.
[01:29:49.074 --> 01:29:52.176]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.176 --> 01:29:54.859]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.982 --> 01:29:59.563]  A U.S.
[01:29:59.563 --> 01:30:05.408]  high school student has reportedly hacked the personal AOL account of CIA Director John Brennan.
[01:30:05.408 --> 01:30:17.758]  According to the hacker, everything from a 47-page application for top-secret security clearance to details of the agency's harsh interrogation techniques were discovered in the breach, notes the New York Post.
[01:30:17.758 --> 01:30:19.280]  The October 12 intrusion
[01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:28.764]  began after the hacker was able to trick workers at Verizon into providing Brennan's personal information and duping AOL into resetting his password.
[01:30:28.764 --> 01:30:37.607]  Law enforcement sources speaking with the Post were shocked at the hacker's actions, noting that the agency would undoubtedly make an example of the hackers if possible.
[01:30:37.867 --> 01:30:45.692]  We've previously seen the CIA brag about how they're collecting your information, going as far as saying they could spy on you through your dishwasher.
[01:30:45.692 --> 01:30:53.157]  All manner of alphabet agencies can gather your information without a warrant, but if you take it from them, they have a problem with that.

[01:33:08.641 --> 01:33:17.149]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:55.023 --> 01:33:56.804]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:56.804 --> 01:33:57.445]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:57.445 --> 01:34:01.208]  Central Standard Time we're here live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:34:01.208 --> 01:34:19.061]  We just had former Congressman Ron Paul on agreeing that political persecution is accelerating and is expanding in this country but that overall we are winning.
[01:34:21.175 --> 01:34:22.996]  And that's the good news.
[01:34:22.996 --> 01:34:33.825]  But that's why they're trying to come in and censor us, because they know we're having an effect.
[01:34:33.825 --> 01:34:46.535]  I'm going to cover a wide spectrum of news here in a moment, and then I'm going to open the phones up again for first-time callers specifically, if you have any comments about some of the amazing things Ron Paul said.
[01:34:46.535 --> 01:34:48.357]  It gives me a headache to actually sit back
[01:34:49.833 --> 01:34:54.797]  And try to think of all the interesting news making statements that Ron Paul made.
[01:34:54.797 --> 01:35:06.627]  I should have written notes down while he was on, because if I don't, then I won't get any articles out or videos out that really have the headline in them to help make sure that information goes viral.
[01:35:06.627 --> 01:35:15.114]  Because it's not just that we're covering key information here, it's that if we don't present it with a lot of fanfare, it'll be lost like pearls before swine.
[01:35:18.305 --> 01:35:21.147]  And I'm not talking about you, the swine, my friends.
[01:35:21.147 --> 01:35:25.449]  You are the pearls getting the information out of the public.
[01:35:25.449 --> 01:35:38.297]  But if it's not packaged for our porcine brethren, they won't even take a second look at it.
[01:35:38.297 --> 01:35:41.459]  So how you package the information is half the battle.
[01:35:41.459 --> 01:35:46.602]  Because what we cover here is so sensational, if we don't put it out in a sensational fashion,
[01:35:48.061 --> 01:35:51.342]  It falls on deaf ears.
[01:35:51.342 --> 01:36:02.946]  So many times Drudge has pointed out in articles and tweets he's put out, and also here on the show, that people ought to take themselves seriously that write for InfoWars.
[01:36:02.946 --> 01:36:05.427]  You ought to take yourself seriously if you write for a little blog.
[01:36:06.223 --> 01:36:10.848]  You ought to take yourself seriously if you go out and shoot news videos for a YouTube channel.
[01:36:10.848 --> 01:36:13.871]  Because you're just as important as some New York Times writer.
[01:36:13.871 --> 01:36:15.873]  Your perspective, your view.
[01:36:15.873 --> 01:36:21.319]  I can never understand when I would go out and cover a press event the arrogance of ABC News reporters.
[01:36:21.319 --> 01:36:24.443]  The arrogance of New York Times reporters.
[01:36:24.443 --> 01:36:28.067]  And they couldn't ever believe that I didn't care about being on their shows.
[01:36:30.831 --> 01:36:32.472]  What are you doing here setting up a camera?
[01:36:32.472 --> 01:36:34.934]  What do you want to try to get on our show?
[01:36:34.934 --> 01:36:36.335]  I'm like, what, you're going to go live?
[01:36:36.335 --> 01:36:37.917]  I might bullhorn it, yeah.
[01:36:37.917 --> 01:36:39.418]  No, I don't want to be interviewed by you.
[01:36:39.418 --> 01:36:41.659]  I don't care.
[01:36:41.659 --> 01:36:43.941]  We get media requests now less and less.
[01:36:43.941 --> 01:36:50.226]  It used to be like every day, come on Nightline, come on this, come on that, come on Good Morning America.
[01:36:50.226 --> 01:36:54.990]  And they would email back or call back and say, you really don't want to come on?
[01:36:57.574 --> 01:37:05.399]  And I'd be like, in the past, let me guess, you want to tape something today and have it in the morning, right?
[01:37:05.399 --> 01:37:05.779]  Well, yeah.
[01:37:05.779 --> 01:37:06.979]  How'd you know that?
[01:37:06.979 --> 01:37:09.041]  Well, you're a live show, aren't you?
[01:37:09.041 --> 01:37:10.061]  This is like five years ago.
[01:37:10.061 --> 01:37:12.282]  I would still have these conversations.
[01:37:12.282 --> 01:37:13.543]  Yes, we are.
[01:37:13.543 --> 01:37:18.086]  Let me guess, the anti-gunners are going to be live.
[01:37:18.086 --> 01:37:20.047]  Well, yeah, they are going to be live.
[01:37:20.047 --> 01:37:24.269]  Because see, the person calling me up wasn't part of making real decisions.
[01:37:24.269 --> 01:37:24.970]  Nine times out of 10.
[01:37:28.334 --> 01:37:33.176]  And I'd say, do you ever think why the opposition's gonna be live and I'm gonna be taped?
[01:37:33.176 --> 01:37:40.298]  Because you're gonna take all my good points out, let them know what my points were before, to try to destroy my points and give them double the time.
[01:37:40.298 --> 01:37:41.738]  So guess what?
[01:37:41.738 --> 01:37:43.959]  Find somebody else to do it.
[01:37:43.959 --> 01:37:49.581]  I'm not gonna get in the arena with you with my arms tied behind my back, okay?
[01:37:49.581 --> 01:37:52.201]  Alright, but we reach like 10 million people a morning.
[01:37:52.201 --> 01:37:53.542]  Good for you!
[01:37:57.592 --> 01:38:04.918]  I'm going to reach people with straight up information and we'll see who ends up reaching the most people in the end.
[01:38:04.918 --> 01:38:07.880]  And now those shows have like 5 million viewers.
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:15.086]  They used to have like 30 million viewers 20 years ago per morning show, ABC, NBC, CBS.
[01:38:15.086 --> 01:38:17.007]  They're already dead.
[01:38:17.007 --> 01:38:18.989]  They're already over.
[01:38:18.989 --> 01:38:20.050]  It's already a joke.
[01:38:21.377 --> 01:38:24.438]  And so I guess Drudge is right when he says, why are we on Facebook?
[01:38:24.438 --> 01:38:25.838]  Why are we on Twitter?
[01:38:25.838 --> 01:38:27.339]  Why are we on YouTube?
[01:38:27.339 --> 01:38:31.260]  We need to not even give any energy to those platforms.
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:40.703]  And until recently, I couldn't do that because I couldn't pay for the bandwidth of having, you know, three, four, five million video views a day.
[01:38:40.703 --> 01:38:45.124]  And I guess I really still can't pay for it.
[01:38:46.428 --> 01:39:03.204]  But we are rapidly approaching a point where bandwidth will be so inexpensive unless they screw the internet up with all these treaties, like TPP, that we will be able to have our own video platform that's free to the public and not subscription.
[01:39:03.204 --> 01:39:05.907]  And that leads me to the next point, a plug.
[01:39:05.907 --> 01:39:07.869]  I never promote PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:07.869 --> 01:39:09.551]  I really should cut a new radio ad for it.
[01:39:11.007 --> 01:39:15.988]  It's been around 14 years and it's had some bumps over the years.
[01:39:15.988 --> 01:39:17.028]  It runs really well now.
[01:39:17.028 --> 01:39:20.489]  I want to thank all of you that have been with us for the long haul.
[01:39:20.489 --> 01:39:21.349]  And it's subscription.
[01:39:21.349 --> 01:39:24.010]  20 people can use it with each membership.
[01:39:24.010 --> 01:39:25.850]  It's $5.95 a month.
[01:39:25.850 --> 01:39:27.371]  That just pays for the bandwidth.
[01:39:27.371 --> 01:39:38.693]  And your memberships help then pay for us to then be able to put out videos for free and have free video feeds for the general radio audience and reach new people.
[01:39:40.114 --> 01:39:42.116]  And that's what it's going to take to defeat the globalists.
[01:39:42.116 --> 01:39:46.500]  You know, ABC, NBC, you name it, have been losing money forever.
[01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:58.110]  But their umbrella companies finance the subsidiaries at a loss.
[01:39:58.110 --> 01:40:00.232]  Because it's a propaganda fee.
[01:40:02.233 --> 01:40:05.595]  To get their trillions in no-bid weapons contracts in the next decade.
[01:40:05.595 --> 01:40:09.897]  To get their trillions in drug sales that are totally bad for you.
[01:40:09.897 --> 01:40:12.698]  To get their police state agenda through.
[01:40:12.698 --> 01:40:17.701]  To continue, they've got to pay to engage in brainwashing.
[01:40:17.701 --> 01:40:21.123]  So it doesn't matter that they're losing money.
[01:40:21.123 --> 01:40:28.707]  Because in their other interest, they are making money hand over fist, and more importantly, consolidating markets.
[01:40:28.707 --> 01:40:30.648]  Because money is just an ends.
[01:40:31.781 --> 01:40:35.984]  Is a means, an ends to justify a means.
[01:40:35.984 --> 01:40:44.128]  They want money to dominate markets and shut down their competition and take over.
[01:40:44.128 --> 01:40:50.712]  But what does matter, the fact that they're losing money, that's just an embarrassment to them.
[01:40:50.712 --> 01:40:56.776]  What really hurts them is their audiences shrinking at an accelerated pace.
[01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:22.195]  Until, all they are, like MSNBC and CNN, have now reached this point, and Rolling Stone Magazine, you name it, not singling them out, it's just an example, they have reached the point of being literal, not veritable, but literal facades.
[01:41:22.195 --> 01:41:25.996]  Like the front of a house in Hollywood, but there's nothing behind it.
[01:41:25.996 --> 01:41:29.037]  Looks like an old western town, but there's nothing through the door.
[01:41:29.974 --> 01:41:41.698]  You step through the door and they are, you know, storing more theater apparatuses.
[01:41:41.698 --> 01:41:44.619]  It is a facade.
[01:41:44.619 --> 01:41:55.082]  And they're just there to keep up appearances and to keep milking advertisement agencies and sponsors who don't know that the heart already stopped.
[01:41:59.423 --> 01:42:04.904]  And so it is really important to understand we are at that crossroads as Ron Paul said just 20 minutes ago.
[01:42:04.904 --> 01:42:08.445]  Things are accelerating.
[01:42:08.445 --> 01:42:19.748]  The future of the world is being decided right now and every bit of energy you put towards resisting the globalist is going to come back tenfold to you.
[01:42:19.748 --> 01:42:22.609]  In my view, historically.
[01:42:22.609 --> 01:42:25.730]  Right now is the time to be putting in the maximum effort
[01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:30.291]  Where we've got one yard to go.
[01:42:30.291 --> 01:42:33.494]  We're in the last two minutes of the game.
[01:42:33.494 --> 01:42:40.199]  We can get the first down, to use a football analogy, and then move us 20 more yards into the end zone.
[01:42:40.199 --> 01:42:47.805]  We can get there, but we've got to get this first down right now, and then we can keep moving the ball into the end zone.
[01:42:47.805 --> 01:42:51.888]  That's how close this game is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:51.888 --> 01:42:52.789]  With two minutes left.
[01:42:54.011 --> 01:43:01.702]  If we get the first down, if we maintain possession, if we move into the end zone, the other side is not even going to have time for a...
[01:43:05.697 --> 01:43:08.759]  reception of the kickoff and a chance to run it down the field.
[01:43:08.759 --> 01:43:10.560]  They're going to lose.
[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:13.041]  But it doesn't mean we're in the catbird seat.
[01:43:13.041 --> 01:43:19.965]  If we keep making wrong moves, if we don't realize how serious a time this is, we will lose everything.
[01:43:19.965 --> 01:43:21.746]  They're coming for your children.
[01:43:21.746 --> 01:43:23.367]  They're coming for your guns.
[01:43:23.367 --> 01:43:24.868]  They're coming for your health.
[01:43:24.868 --> 01:43:26.849]  They're coming with forced inoculations.
[01:43:26.849 --> 01:43:28.510]  They're coming with world government.
[01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:30.351]  They're coming with secret treaties.
[01:43:30.351 --> 01:43:31.691]  It's all admitted now.
[01:43:31.691 --> 01:43:32.512]  There's no more room
[01:43:35.947 --> 01:43:38.209]  There's no more chance.
[01:43:38.209 --> 01:43:41.692]  There's no more time for denials.
[01:43:41.692 --> 01:43:46.916]  While they were building the world government, they denied it existed.
[01:43:46.916 --> 01:43:54.322]  Now that it's out in the open, are you going to just acquiesce and go along with it?
[01:43:55.885 --> 01:43:58.866]  And believe me, you don't have to save the world by yourself.
[01:43:58.866 --> 01:44:05.227]  You vote with your dollars, you vote with your mouth, you vote with your feet, you vote with your prayers, you vote with your actions.
[01:44:05.227 --> 01:44:08.528]  The globalists are dead meat.
[01:44:08.528 --> 01:44:14.189]  All of their top corporations are in deep trouble.
[01:44:14.189 --> 01:44:16.390]  Except for Goldman Sachs at the very top and JP Morgan.
[01:44:17.759 --> 01:44:19.780]  And they're in a consolidation phase.
[01:44:19.780 --> 01:44:29.766]  A member of the head of JP Morgan in an internal email to their hundreds of executives a few months ago said, we have reached the final phase.
[01:44:29.766 --> 01:44:33.489]  This is going to be, you know, absolutely insane.
[01:44:33.489 --> 01:44:35.530]  We are in fortress mode.
[01:44:35.530 --> 01:44:39.793]  We are set to make it through this and then dominate on the other side.
[01:44:39.793 --> 01:44:42.114]  This will be our greatest triumph.
[01:44:42.114 --> 01:44:43.195]  I'm paraphrasing the email.
[01:44:43.195 --> 01:44:45.356]  You can read it for yourself.
[01:44:45.356 --> 01:44:45.776]  Just type in
[01:44:47.219 --> 01:44:53.582]  JP Morgan's email on the future.
[01:44:53.582 --> 01:44:54.782]  Infowars.com.
[01:44:54.782 --> 01:44:56.943]  It'll come up for you.
[01:44:56.943 --> 01:44:58.944]  Because this is it.
[01:44:58.944 --> 01:45:13.309]  And those few globalist corporations and groups and families that can make it through this global meltdown and be on the other side with all their unlimited cash and their central bank's power to issue currency to them.
[01:45:13.309 --> 01:45:14.830]  This is the true takeover.
[01:45:15.512 --> 01:45:32.157]  World government's about getting the laws and regulations in place to take your farm, take your ranch, take your house, conscript your children, arrest you for environmental crimes and infractions that are gonna make the drug war look like a walk in the park.
[01:45:32.157 --> 01:45:39.019]  It is the setup for the next big phase rollout of totalitarianism.
[01:45:39.019 --> 01:45:40.179]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:45:45.391 --> 01:45:46.412]  800-259-9231.
[01:45:46.412 --> 01:46:06.022]  A few years ago, they had months of really bad fires east of Austin and west of Austin, all around Austin, to where no matter where you lived, ash would rain down on your car, like you lived in LA or something in the summer.
[01:46:06.022 --> 01:46:10.204]  It's very Dante-ish, very Dante's Inferno.
[01:46:15.529 --> 01:46:25.832]  And I liken it to being somebody in a neighborhood when the winds would kick up, it would suddenly go from just eating a few acres an hour to eating hundreds of acres every few minutes.
[01:46:25.832 --> 01:46:29.933]  And the fire departments would pull up to people's houses and say, get out.
[01:46:29.933 --> 01:46:33.693]  You know, basically follow us to the evacuation route.
[01:46:33.693 --> 01:46:37.694]  And some people wouldn't leave and would be burned up in their homes.
[01:46:37.694 --> 01:46:39.875]  You talk about being in denial.
[01:46:39.875 --> 01:46:43.596]  I'm not here being a fear monger when I tell you how serious the stakes are.
[01:46:45.489 --> 01:46:49.211]  How high the stakes are.
[01:46:49.211 --> 01:46:56.254]  I'm here trying to get people that'll listen to move into action against the New World Order.
[01:46:56.254 --> 01:47:02.517]  Because running is not the solution in this fight.
[01:47:02.517 --> 01:47:05.798]  Running is like getting on your knees.
[01:47:05.798 --> 01:47:08.499]  There's nowhere to run.
[01:47:08.499 --> 01:47:13.562]  And if we would just identify the New World Order and get aggressive with them,
[01:47:14.781 --> 01:47:20.907]  And not be scared of them and realize that they've abused us, they've persecuted us, they've hurt us.
[01:47:20.907 --> 01:47:24.411]  They don't have a hope of getting out of this.
[01:47:24.411 --> 01:47:27.654]  They have bit off way more than they can chew.
[01:47:27.654 --> 01:47:31.798]  Basically every operation they're running is stuck in the mud right now.
[01:47:31.798 --> 01:47:34.901]  This is what always happens to tyrants.
[01:47:34.901 --> 01:47:37.584]  They just hope they can reshuffle politicians in Europe.
[01:47:39.505 --> 01:47:52.128]  And reshuffle politicians here and use political correctness intimidation to intimidate people into shutting up.
[01:47:52.128 --> 01:48:07.972]  And they hope the leftover fumes of prosperity is enough for people to just sit complacent another year, another decade, until we wake up and robots have replaced everything.
[01:48:07.972 --> 01:48:08.892]  Driving your cars.
[01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:17.937]  Construction, manufacturing, with no exit strategy for jobs for humans in the future.
[01:48:17.937 --> 01:48:29.407]  So you're made dependent on the bureaucracy, on the technocracy, on the robots, so that the terms of your human surrender to dehumanization
[01:48:31.032 --> 01:48:32.853]  This can be laid out to you.
[01:48:32.853 --> 01:48:34.113]  You will eat what we say.
[01:48:34.113 --> 01:48:36.054]  You will sleep where we say.
[01:48:36.054 --> 01:48:37.555]  You will live where we say.
[01:48:37.555 --> 01:48:38.755]  You will take what we say.
[01:48:38.755 --> 01:48:40.496]  You will take the inoculations.
[01:48:40.496 --> 01:48:41.797]  You will talk like we say.
[01:48:41.797 --> 01:48:45.538]  Or you won't get your energy rations.
[01:48:45.538 --> 01:48:47.639]  You won't get your carbon credits.
[01:48:47.639 --> 01:48:49.780]  You won't get to buy and sell.
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:51.481]  They're not just going to get rid of cash, folks.
[01:48:51.481 --> 01:48:53.542]  They're going to get rid of money itself.
[01:48:53.542 --> 01:48:55.462]  Everything is going to be energy credits.
[01:48:55.462 --> 01:48:57.663]  It's all been laid out by the Club of Rome in 1967.
[01:49:00.526 --> 01:49:03.728]  I show their white papers in Endgame.
[01:49:03.728 --> 01:49:10.011]  We're talking about an established plan to end human civilization as we know it.
[01:49:10.011 --> 01:49:15.913]  Now, are you gonna go along with that?
[01:49:15.913 --> 01:49:22.277]  It's also more important than ever to spread the word about this broadcast and to realize they're doing everything they can to shut it down.
[01:49:22.277 --> 01:49:26.098]  So please don't take it for granted.
[01:49:26.098 --> 01:49:29.160]  Please tell people about the local Aminefim affiliates you listen to.
[01:49:30.967 --> 01:49:52.283]  Pray for this broadcast, pray for liberty, pray for an awakening, and also support us by getting the amazing water filtration system, storable foods, incredibly high quality nutraceuticals like Lung Cleanse and Liver Shield that's back in stock, and Survival Shield Nacin Iodine X2, and Super Mel Vitality that's now back in stock.
[01:49:53.084 --> 01:50:02.467]  And 20% off things like Secret 12, Vitamin B12, and the other amazing products at Infowarslife.com.
[01:50:02.467 --> 01:50:12.090]  15% off Ancient Defense, which you need in the fall and winter, which has, again, scores of known herbs.
[01:50:12.090 --> 01:50:14.931]  I forget, I think it's something like 40, it's ridiculous.
[01:50:14.931 --> 01:50:20.733]  All concentrated in together that are known to boost immunity.
[01:50:21.837 --> 01:50:22.778]  Will it shave you?
[01:50:22.778 --> 01:50:23.879]  Is it the answer to everything?
[01:50:23.879 --> 01:50:26.561]  No, but it's something else you can do for yourself.
[01:50:26.561 --> 01:50:31.825]  And the ritual of taking high quality supplements gets you into thinking about eating good.
[01:50:31.825 --> 01:50:33.867]  Gets you into thinking about sleeping more.
[01:50:33.867 --> 01:50:35.509]  Gets you into thinking about your health.
[01:50:36.423 --> 01:50:37.943]  And it supports this broadcast.
[01:50:37.943 --> 01:50:41.404]  It's a win-win-win on so many different fronts.
[01:50:41.404 --> 01:50:43.384]  So, Infowarslife.com.
[01:50:43.384 --> 01:50:44.865]  Please shop with the good guys.
[01:50:44.865 --> 01:50:45.645]  Our call toll free.
[01:50:45.645 --> 01:50:47.405]  We can answer all your questions and take your order.
[01:50:47.405 --> 01:50:48.725]  888-253-3139.
[01:50:48.725 --> 01:50:58.947]  I'm gonna get to that James Woods excoriating Bernie Sanders straight ahead.
[01:50:58.947 --> 01:51:01.427]  You wouldn't go swimming with sharks without a cage, would you?
[01:51:01.427 --> 01:51:02.448]  Hey!
[01:51:02.448 --> 01:51:03.608]  Has anyone seen Larry?
[01:51:05.464 --> 01:51:09.966]  It's in our nature to protect ourselves, especially when protection is simple and affordable.
[01:51:09.966 --> 01:51:16.229]  That's why IDStronghold.com has been providing affordable RFID protection for over 10 years.
[01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:26.533]  IDStronghold wallets protect you from electronic pickpockets who pass near you with a scanner and steal your credit and debit card info, as well as data from other cards containing RFID chips.
[01:51:26.533 --> 01:51:34.797]  IDStronghold.com, the original maker of shielded wallets, is a technology company, so we understand how to best protect you against intrusive radio waves.
[01:51:35.077 --> 01:51:41.340]  ID Stronghold wallets are designed to block RFID signals, open or closed, no matter where on the wallet you put your cards.
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:47.522]  Most other RFID wallets on the market were designed with only fashion in mind and don't shield properly, if at all.
[01:51:47.522 --> 01:51:53.424]  If you're shopping for your next wallet, be sure to get the protection you deserve by going to idstronghold.com.
[01:51:53.424 --> 01:51:57.046]  Because getting anything else is like being the next victim in a Jaws movie.
[01:51:58.963 --> 01:52:06.727]  Numana, the true pioneer of healthy storable foods and preparedness products, has gone and done it again.
[01:52:06.727 --> 01:52:14.190]  Numana is now the first food storage company in the country to offer organic powdered milk free of hormones.
[01:52:14.190 --> 01:52:18.052]  Our goal is to change the way you look at storable food.
[01:52:18.052 --> 01:52:25.535]  Numana is GMO free, contains no high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, or artificial ingredients.
[01:52:26.255 --> 01:52:34.096]  Numanis' great tasting and easy to fix meals are perfect for emergencies or a quick dinner for your family this weekend.
[01:52:34.096 --> 01:52:43.138]  We also offer the revolutionary Defender Pack, which combines organic superfoods with the GMO free meals our customers rave about.
[01:52:43.138 --> 01:52:45.298]  Go to powerprepper.com or call 877-817-9829 today to learn more.
[01:52:45.298 --> 01:52:45.579]  That's 877-817-9829.
[01:52:54.661 --> 01:52:58.904]  Hey, Berky Guy here.
[01:52:58.904 --> 01:53:00.726]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[01:53:00.726 --> 01:53:02.487]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[01:53:02.487 --> 01:53:04.448]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?

[01:53:19.159 --> 01:53:22.421]  Join them by visiting GoBerkey.com or call me, the Berkey Guy, at 877-886-3653.
[01:53:22.421 --> 01:53:22.821]  That's 877-886-3653.
[01:53:22.821 --> 01:53:24.543]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.
[01:53:30.086 --> 01:53:31.167]  Get back to nature.

[01:53:53.887 --> 01:53:56.509]  Feel the thrill only at slingbow.com.
[01:54:07.333 --> 01:54:09.254]  Welcome back.
[01:54:09.254 --> 01:54:11.155]  Thank you for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:11.155 --> 01:54:17.717]  We're going to be taking your calls over the next hour with a special guest that's joining us as well.
[01:54:17.717 --> 01:54:30.542]  Look, Bernie Sanders saying that China is good for infants' rights or babies' rights is like saying radical Islam is good for women's rights.
[01:54:30.542 --> 01:54:32.943]  It's like saying kryptonite is good for Superman.
[01:54:34.687 --> 01:54:46.823]  This is a guy that runs around saying we need to get our free socialist health care like England with its nightmare National Health Service that has millions of Brits a year traveling to the United States for basic health care.
[01:54:46.823 --> 01:54:49.427]  Medical terrorism.
[01:54:49.427 --> 01:54:50.488]  And James Woods.
[01:54:50.488 --> 01:54:52.351]  Man, I wish I could get James Woods on the show.
[01:54:54.437 --> 01:55:03.824]  I was at a Hollywood dinner one time with a bunch of folks that thought I was really great because I was exposing 9-11, a bunch of famous actors, and I went, do any of you guys know James Woods?
[01:55:03.824 --> 01:55:05.705]  I really like him in different movies.
[01:55:05.705 --> 01:55:07.486]  I think he's a great actor.
[01:55:07.486 --> 01:55:18.814]  And they all looked at me like I had just said, let's eat baby for dinner or something, and just did not even respond to what I said.
[01:55:18.814 --> 01:55:21.236]  But I tell you, I would love to get James Woods on the show.
[01:55:23.396 --> 01:55:29.462]  Hollywood actor, Democrat, both destroy Bernie Sanders for praising communist China.
[01:55:29.462 --> 01:55:33.725]  China has notoriously killed female infants for population control, you utter moron.
[01:55:33.725 --> 01:55:35.027]  James Woods tells Sanders.
[01:55:37.051 --> 01:55:54.821]  After Bernie Sanders praised China for providing 14 weeks of taxpayer-paid maternity leave, both, yeah, then they come and do medical exams to kill the baby if it's a girl, both Hollywood actor James Woods and Democratic pundit Kristen Powers pointed out the Communist regime also kills infants for population control.
[01:55:54.821 --> 01:56:02.525]  Well, you won't be getting any Disney jobs now because if you criticize Communist Chinese in any way, Disney will blackball you.
[01:56:02.525 --> 01:56:04.066]  This is how totalitarianism works.
[01:56:07.748 --> 01:56:14.016]  And he goes on, them tweeting at Senator Sanders, at Sen.
[01:56:14.016 --> 01:56:15.438]  Sanders.
[01:56:15.438 --> 01:56:20.685]  Except for babies they force women to abort, Senator.
[01:56:20.685 --> 01:56:23.629]  Totally and completely sickening.
[01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:24.991]  And look, Sanders isn't stupid.
[01:56:24.991 --> 01:56:25.792]  He knows what he's doing.
[01:56:27.176 --> 01:56:31.020]  When he gets up and goes, Cuba has a very nice system!
[01:56:31.020 --> 01:56:33.122]  We need one like it!
[01:56:33.122 --> 01:56:36.144]  You deserve something free!
[01:56:36.144 --> 01:56:39.688]  And uh, Walmart people have too much money!
[01:56:39.688 --> 01:56:42.571]  We need to, to, to redistribute!
[01:56:42.571 --> 01:56:43.852]  Redistribute it!
[01:56:47.841 --> 01:56:50.822]  Because communist systems work so well.
[01:56:50.822 --> 01:56:52.162]  Oh, excuse me!
[01:56:52.162 --> 01:56:53.343]  Excuse me!
[01:56:53.343 --> 01:56:59.925]  I'm not a communist, even though I endorsed them, and all these videos are coming out.
[01:56:59.925 --> 01:57:03.706]  It's all an act, I don't comb my hair.
[01:57:03.706 --> 01:57:06.887]  I'm a democratic socialist.
[01:57:06.887 --> 01:57:14.829]  Which means, we vote to take all your money away, and then we collapse like Venezuela.
[01:57:14.829 --> 01:57:16.190]  I can't really do the best Bernie Sanders.
[01:57:19.332 --> 01:57:25.575]  I mean, he criticizes the Federal Reserve on the surface until they're about to audit it, then he's the deciding vote to kill the audit of the Senate.
[01:57:25.575 --> 01:57:26.896]  Failed by one vote.
[01:57:26.896 --> 01:57:29.357]  Thank you, Mr. Sanders.
[01:57:29.357 --> 01:57:35.480]  Colonel Sanders.
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:38.681]  What a disgusting human being.
[01:57:38.681 --> 01:57:41.022]  Preying on his moron constituency.
[01:57:41.022 --> 01:57:46.845]  Let me tell you, there's only one group of constituents I've seen on C-SPAN that looks more pathetic, more weak, more stupid.
[01:57:49.022 --> 01:57:49.783]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:57:49.783 --> 01:57:50.983]  I'm not saying this to be mean.
[01:57:50.983 --> 01:57:58.528]  I look into the eyes of hardcore Democrat supporters and they look like people I know that are seriously brain damaged and can't talk.
[01:57:58.528 --> 01:57:59.829]  They have that same look.
[01:57:59.829 --> 01:58:03.231]  Like they've been hit upside the head by a frying pan.
[01:58:03.231 --> 01:58:05.113]  Permanently.
[01:58:05.113 --> 01:58:07.374]  And I actually feel sorry for them.
[01:58:07.374 --> 01:58:12.638]  And then they've been conditioned just to giggle and say, I'm an intellectual, I'm an intellectual, and giggle and walk away.
[01:58:12.638 --> 01:58:14.239]  Notice we always try to talk to Democrats.
[01:58:14.239 --> 01:58:16.080]  We go, talk to us about why you're for gun control.
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:17.381]  I'm not going to talk to you.
[01:58:17.381 --> 01:58:18.742]  Then a handler comes over and goes, don't talk.
[01:58:20.114 --> 01:58:22.756]  They can't even talk.
[01:58:22.756 --> 01:58:42.831]  And then their leader is some guy with his hair sticking out going... Meanwhile, the big megabags fund all the socialists to consolidate wealth and give chicken feed to the public to make them dependent.
[01:58:42.831 --> 01:58:43.812]  Dependent.
[01:58:43.812 --> 01:58:46.014]  Domesticated animals are dependent.
[01:58:46.014 --> 01:58:47.075]  You are dependent.
[01:58:47.075 --> 01:58:48.075]  You are dependent.
[01:58:48.075 --> 01:58:48.776]  You are dependent.
[01:58:48.916 --> 01:58:53.178]  Many of the products at Infowarslife.com are true game changers.
[01:58:53.178 --> 01:58:57.420]  They are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold by prescription.
[01:58:57.420 --> 01:59:04.704]  But when we look at a product like Survival Shield Nason Iodine X2, it's something that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years.
[01:59:04.884 --> 01:59:15.557]  The federal government mandated from the 20s until the 70s that iodine, a crude form of it, be added to table salt because of the incredible health problems that dietary deficiency in iodine was causing.
[01:59:15.557 --> 01:59:19.081]  I want to challenge the listeners who've not tried X2 for yourselves.
[01:59:19.081 --> 01:59:20.223]  What do you have to lose?
[01:59:20.223 --> 01:59:22.926]  You are the tip of the spear in the fight for human liberty and
[01:59:23.046 --> 01:59:28.651]  You're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed my life and many other people's lives that I know.
[01:59:28.651 --> 01:59:31.954]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[01:59:31.954 --> 01:59:36.138]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[01:59:36.138 --> 01:59:38.460]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[01:59:38.460 --> 01:59:45.426]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:59:50.868 --> 01:59:53.472]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:04.813 --> 02:00:09.638]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.638 --> 02:00:11.219]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.219 --> 02:00:12.761]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.761 --> 02:00:16.965]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.965 --> 02:00:21.029]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:38.237 --> 02:00:39.657]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[02:00:39.657 --> 02:00:42.618]  We have a special guest joining us in the next segment.
[02:00:42.618 --> 02:00:44.038]  We'll continue calls then as well.
[02:00:44.038 --> 02:00:45.779]  Bill in California, you're on the air.
[02:00:45.779 --> 02:00:47.659]  Go ahead.
[02:00:47.659 --> 02:00:48.179]  Alex?
[02:00:48.179 --> 02:00:49.559]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:49.559 --> 02:01:04.902]  I just wanted to say before my Alzheimer's kicks in that I used to watch Fox News and I sent several emails to Bill O'Reilly asking him simple questions like, can you discuss the Globalist, the New World Order, things like that.
[02:01:04.902 --> 02:01:06.703]  I never get a response, never get anything.
[02:01:07.685 --> 02:01:08.726]  A damn thing about it.
[02:01:08.726 --> 02:01:17.070]  So now I don't watch him anymore, and I don't like what Kelly did to Trump, the way she's just being on her high soapbox.
[02:01:17.070 --> 02:01:18.831]  But anyway, I'm off of there.
[02:01:18.831 --> 02:01:21.533]  I don't believe anything they say, so I'm a convert.
[02:01:21.533 --> 02:01:29.557]  And the other thing I wanted to say is what concerns me about guns is the fact that if anybody is watching these 1,500 jihadists
[02:01:33.601 --> 02:01:34.002]  That's good.
[02:01:51.866 --> 02:01:55.949]  And the third thing... The FBI's come out and said that they're not allowed to track them.
[02:01:55.949 --> 02:01:59.431]  Homeland Security then lied and said, oh, of course we do.
[02:01:59.431 --> 02:02:00.091]  But it's not 1,500.
[02:02:00.091 --> 02:02:01.672]  That's the first wave.
[02:02:01.672 --> 02:02:05.054]  They want hundreds of thousands, admittedly, to be brought in.
[02:02:05.054 --> 02:02:10.017]  And then Le Pen, again, I already mentioned this, but I want to cover it more.
[02:02:10.017 --> 02:02:11.899]  She has been arrested, brought into court.
[02:02:12.796 --> 02:02:17.221]  For saying that we're being colonized and this is a radical Islamic invasion.
[02:02:17.221 --> 02:02:20.945]  I mean, you don't even have free speech in Europe to point out what's happening.
[02:02:20.945 --> 02:02:26.090]  That's how sick and evil these governments are and they want to do that here.
[02:02:26.090 --> 02:02:29.413]  And so, I'll be honest, I heard all this Islamophobia stuff.
[02:02:30.481 --> 02:02:32.182]  And I thought it was exaggerated.
[02:02:32.182 --> 02:02:33.944]  I thought it was, you know, over the top.
[02:02:33.944 --> 02:02:37.106]  But I guess the globalists have done the demographics.
[02:02:37.106 --> 02:02:45.112]  If they've got a million, 200 million Islamists, they can ship a few hundred million of them in here, which they already got 40 million illegals here.
[02:02:45.112 --> 02:02:47.594]  Well, the illegals don't want to destroy the country on average.
[02:02:47.594 --> 02:02:49.535]  Well, if they bring in radical jihadis, they do.
[02:02:50.296 --> 02:02:56.357]  And they walk around with burning torches saying, your women will wear hoods, you will not drink beer, or I will kill you.
[02:02:56.357 --> 02:02:58.178]  And they go, well that's their culture, let them do it.
[02:02:58.178 --> 02:03:00.258]  I mean, at a certain point, I'm fed up.
[02:03:00.258 --> 02:03:07.679]  I'm not against Muslims, but the Muslims I see running around the streets saying, you'll do what I say, you'll convert and all this.
[02:03:07.679 --> 02:03:11.040]  Well, I'm not converting to anybody under orders.
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:15.601]  And so, the left now is using radical Muslims as their bully.
[02:03:16.778 --> 02:03:24.619]  And the radical Muslims just sit there licking their feet, but only so long, because they will bite the hand that feeds them, and I'm just sick of it.
[02:03:24.619 --> 02:03:25.140]  What about you?
[02:03:25.140 --> 02:03:27.760]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:41.502]  Where migrants are given four-star hotels in Germany, where people are being arrested for criticizing open borders, where they're saying you're teaching elementary students, saying boy or girl is sexist, calling them to the principal's office.
[02:03:41.502 --> 02:03:44.083]  I mean, this is a total cult of brainwashing.
[02:03:45.803 --> 02:03:47.164]  I believe the same thing.
[02:03:47.164 --> 02:03:57.374]  Just to interject, I have a son-in-law who is a police officer up here, and so he goes to different trainings that are put on by the FBI, and he said they're pretty much a joke.
[02:03:57.374 --> 02:04:02.038]  They'll go to a mall and do a mock mall invasion or something like that.
[02:04:02.038 --> 02:04:05.841]  And then, let's see, the other thing I wanted to say was
[02:04:07.734 --> 02:04:14.857]  Are people aware, I don't know if this is old or redundant, but that the Bushes have bought 200,000 acres in Paraguay.
[02:04:14.857 --> 02:04:16.178]  It's been a couple years ago.
[02:04:16.178 --> 02:04:17.919]  They have their own port.
[02:04:17.919 --> 02:04:19.880]  They have their own military.
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:22.261]  And it's a fact, from what I know.
[02:04:22.261 --> 02:04:24.222]  No, that's true.
[02:04:24.222 --> 02:04:27.083]  And reportedly, Ken Lay staged his death and he's down there.
[02:04:27.083 --> 02:04:29.464]  Serious news media has seen him down there.
[02:04:29.464 --> 02:04:31.725]  Ken Lay just lives there.
[02:04:31.725 --> 02:04:35.247]  If, uh, I was just going to say a key indicator of when the, uh,
[02:04:35.953 --> 02:04:43.137]  What's going to hit the fan is when people, if they ever see the change in the bushes head out, and they're not around, it's imminent.
[02:04:43.137 --> 02:04:43.597]  That's right.
[02:04:43.597 --> 02:04:46.458]  It's not just the bushes that bought that 200,000 acres.
[02:04:46.458 --> 02:04:49.600]  All these other globalists bought a bunch of land there around them as well.
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:55.143]  Look, the bushes got a lot of the German wealth after World War II.
[02:04:55.143 --> 02:04:56.563]  Prescott was the head Nazi lawyer.
[02:04:56.563 --> 02:04:57.364]  They're super rich.
[02:04:59.443 --> 02:05:05.374]  It was 30 years ago, in 1985, that Doc and Marty went back another 30 years to 1955.
[02:05:05.374 --> 02:05:08.379]  Then, they went back to the future, to today.
[02:05:08.379 --> 02:05:11.104]  Where we're going, we don't need roads.
[02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:16.174]  Well, there's no flying cars, and it isn't the roads they say we don't need.
[02:05:16.174 --> 02:05:19.117]  They tell us where we're going, there won't be any drivers.
[02:05:19.117 --> 02:05:26.384]  And there's no hoverboards or self-lacing shoes, but at least we're not plagued with fax machines.
[02:05:26.384 --> 02:05:32.029]  You may just need a lightning strike for power, since Obama and the EPA are trying to shut down most of the power plants.
[02:05:34.813 --> 02:05:39.195]  But the movie's future resembles the present in a couple of very strange ways.
[02:05:39.195 --> 02:05:51.441]  The Cubs got in the World Series, and even stranger... Discover how, in 1979, Biff successfully lobbied to legalize gambling and turned Hill Valley's dilapidated courthouse into a beautiful casino hotel.
[02:05:51.441 --> 02:05:52.921]  I just want to say one thing.
[02:05:52.921 --> 02:05:54.302]  God bless America.
[02:05:54.302 --> 02:05:55.983]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:05:58.467 --> 02:06:01.969]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:06:01.969 --> 02:06:10.233]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:06:10.233 --> 02:06:15.656]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:06:15.656 --> 02:06:18.177]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:06:18.177 --> 02:06:20.278]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:06:28.368 --> 02:06:29.469]  BrainForce is here.
[02:06:29.469 --> 02:06:31.689]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:06:31.689 --> 02:06:36.672]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:06:36.672 --> 02:06:38.372]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[02:06:38.372 --> 02:06:39.953]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:06:39.953 --> 02:06:43.455]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:06:43.455 --> 02:06:45.436]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:06:45.436 --> 02:06:46.336]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:06:46.336 --> 02:06:47.556]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:06:47.556 --> 02:06:49.537]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[02:06:49.537 --> 02:06:55.140]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:06:58.081 --> 02:06:58.662]  I want my candy!
[02:06:58.662 --> 02:06:59.622]  I want my baby again!
[02:06:59.622 --> 02:07:01.324]  Mine, mine, mine!
[02:07:01.324 --> 02:07:11.052]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[02:07:11.052 --> 02:07:13.754]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[02:07:13.754 --> 02:07:17.297]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it.
[02:07:17.297 --> 02:07:20.039]  Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system.
[02:07:20.179 --> 02:07:23.621]  And are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[02:07:23.621 --> 02:07:28.764]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs.
[02:07:28.764 --> 02:07:35.148]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[02:07:35.148 --> 02:07:42.613]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.
[02:07:42.873 --> 02:07:50.420]  Introducing ChildEase with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential nutrients that taste great.

[02:07:54.023 --> 02:07:56.966]  That's ChildEase exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:08:11.584 --> 02:08:16.287]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:16.287 --> 02:08:25.333]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:25.333 --> 02:08:29.375]  Look at this idiot.
[02:08:29.375 --> 02:08:35.199]  See, Star Wars tickets that comes out in December are being priced for $10,000 for resellers.
[02:08:39.209 --> 02:08:45.852]  Meanwhile, they're doing stunts in China as stormtroopers swarm the Great Wall.
[02:08:45.852 --> 02:08:48.013]  It's truly ridiculous.
[02:08:48.013 --> 02:09:04.001]  And now that we have Disney owning the Star Wars franchise, the political correctness is only going to get that much worse.
[02:09:07.168 --> 02:09:16.811]  Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, they caught the government spying on politicians, spying on movie stars, spying on the general public, spying on the press.
[02:09:16.811 --> 02:09:21.053]  And so the government's answer was to just legalize what was already illegal.
[02:09:22.824 --> 02:09:24.145]  Here it is out of the Daily Mail.
[02:09:24.145 --> 02:09:28.608]  Security Service is given new rights to spy on your phones and computers.
[02:09:28.608 --> 02:09:37.015]  Dizzying range of electronic surveillance equipment set to be made available to MI5, MI6, and GCHQ under new laws.
[02:09:37.015 --> 02:09:40.717]  Oh, it's just now going to be available.
[02:09:40.717 --> 02:09:51.105]  Meanwhile, Migration Group, headed up by the UN and Peter Sutherland, says the world must be ready for more diversity.
[02:09:51.105 --> 02:09:52.026]  And diversity means
[02:09:54.017 --> 02:10:02.865]  5 million, 10 million people come into your small country, 50 million come into your big country, and then they get everything free.
[02:10:02.865 --> 02:10:06.308]  They get filled full of entitlement if they want it for free.
[02:10:06.308 --> 02:10:07.689]  Others don't want it for free and go work.
[02:10:09.281 --> 02:10:13.726]  And they're turned into basically a new political underclass that gets to vote.
[02:10:13.726 --> 02:10:15.608]  Isn't that just cute?
[02:10:15.608 --> 02:10:21.634]  And that ties into Marie Le Pen stands for trial for Muslim street prayer outbursts.
[02:10:21.634 --> 02:10:30.343]  They call it an outburst that she gave a speech saying this is the beginning of an occupation and quoted Imams saying they were colonizing France.
[02:10:35.174 --> 02:10:40.218]  She compared the occupation to the Nazi occupation of France.
[02:10:40.218 --> 02:10:45.343]  And the people working with the radical Islamists is taking over as the equivalent to V.C.
[02:10:45.343 --> 02:10:47.945]  French, who opened the door for Hitler.
[02:10:47.945 --> 02:10:49.786]  France just stood down, folks.
[02:10:49.786 --> 02:10:51.208]  And that's what's happening under globalism.
[02:10:51.208 --> 02:10:54.370]  You don't stand down to Hitler.
[02:10:54.370 --> 02:10:58.133]  You stand down to globalism and all that it brings.
[02:10:58.133 --> 02:11:03.338]  Horror as Christian migrant brutally beaten with baton in refugee camp on video.
[02:11:07.096 --> 02:11:14.800]  Well, it is true that the folks aren't too tolerant of Christians, but that's okay, because Christians aren't a politically correct, protected group.
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:23.704]  They're not as sexy and cool as, you know, the folks that rock the casbah.
[02:11:23.704 --> 02:11:27.926]  Meanwhile, mystery deaths in Sierra Leone, Africa, spread fear of Ebola relapses.
[02:11:27.926 --> 02:11:32.888]  Reuters and a nurse that had been clear of Ebola for six months came back down with it.
[02:11:33.834 --> 02:11:35.716]  Now, we've always known, some people continue to be carriers.
[02:11:35.716 --> 02:11:37.777]  Folks, there's been Ebola all over the world.
[02:11:37.777 --> 02:11:41.721]  There's been a cover-up of Ebola.
[02:11:41.721 --> 02:11:44.143]  That's some of the news on that front.
[02:11:44.143 --> 02:11:46.665]  What about these little juicy headlines?
[02:11:46.665 --> 02:11:51.009]  Look, they told me an hour ago that Biden was giving a speech, that he was stepping down.
[02:11:51.009 --> 02:11:52.850]  I've got the reasons for it right here in front of me.
[02:11:52.850 --> 02:11:54.532]  In fact, I meant to print that, guys.
[02:11:54.532 --> 02:11:55.673]  You bring me Biden's statement in.
[02:11:55.673 --> 02:11:56.774]  Thanks, I forgot to ask for that.
[02:12:04.602 --> 02:12:08.824]  This means that Hillary, who gets, what was the headline I saw?
[02:12:08.824 --> 02:12:13.166]  Double the corporate contributions of all other candidates combined.
[02:12:13.166 --> 02:12:16.568]  Not just Democrats.
[02:12:16.568 --> 02:12:18.609]  Because the Feds don't know who to bet on.
[02:12:18.609 --> 02:12:20.290]  The globalists don't know who to bet on right now.
[02:12:20.290 --> 02:12:22.591]  They don't want to give Ronald Trump money.
[02:12:22.591 --> 02:12:24.312]  They think Jeb's going to lose now.
[02:12:24.312 --> 02:12:25.793]  They were giving him a lot of money.
[02:12:25.793 --> 02:12:32.256]  And so Hillary gets more money than everybody else combined, and then some.
[02:12:32.256 --> 02:12:32.897]  Showing that
[02:12:34.727 --> 02:12:37.869]  She's the one.
[02:12:37.869 --> 02:12:44.592]  And that if they didn't run Biden, that means that the establishment is bowing and kneeling to her.
[02:12:44.592 --> 02:12:52.617]  Meanwhile, they want to cover their bases and make sure they've got Republicans that are going to work with them.
[02:12:52.617 --> 02:12:57.279]  Representative Ryan seeks unity from House GOP to run for Speaker.
[02:12:57.279 --> 02:13:00.601]  You gotta love, though, getting back to this, how Hillary
[02:13:02.361 --> 02:13:02.861]  Is that true?
[02:13:21.155 --> 02:13:23.517]  And she just sits up there to her moron constituents.
[02:13:23.517 --> 02:13:25.898]  I mean, these are real morons.
[02:13:25.898 --> 02:13:33.823]  She supported torture, the Patriot Act, the NDAA, Fast and Furious, radicalizing the jihadis, turning them loose.
[02:13:33.823 --> 02:13:40.808]  I mean, you talk about evil, lied about being in a firefight and being shot at and holes in the plane in Serbia.
[02:13:40.808 --> 02:13:41.828]  None of it was true.
[02:13:41.828 --> 02:13:43.890]  Brian Williams has to step down in disgrace?
[02:13:43.890 --> 02:13:44.470]  Not Hillary?
[02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:45.511]  Because she's a woman!
[02:13:47.079 --> 02:13:52.980]  And I'm not criticizing her because she wants my guns or is a big fat liar or has had me persecuted before.
[02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:58.121]  No, I'm doing it because I don't want a woman over me.
[02:13:58.121 --> 02:14:01.362]  They'll probably have a salon headline, Jones admits it's because she's a woman.
[02:14:01.362 --> 02:14:03.822]  No, it's called satire, idiots.
[02:14:03.822 --> 02:14:09.283]  When you're not writing articles about how great pedophilia is or how I ought to be killed.
[02:14:09.283 --> 02:14:10.783]  And people say, oh, they do it to be sensational.
[02:14:10.783 --> 02:14:11.704]  No, they don't.
[02:14:11.704 --> 02:14:13.744]  This is who they are, turned over to evil.
[02:14:16.476 --> 02:14:18.457]  They mean business!
[02:14:18.457 --> 02:14:19.478]  We mean business, too!
[02:14:19.478 --> 02:14:23.220]  To quote John Wayne, fill your hand.
[02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:29.143]  I love how these chicken necks try to intimidate people.
[02:14:29.143 --> 02:14:41.771]  There's a quote, a good quote from the movie Elysium, where the head dictator says, you're lucky I'm here or you'd be hung.
[02:14:45.336 --> 02:14:47.397]  And he goes, hanging?
[02:14:47.397 --> 02:14:48.899]  We do the hanging around here!
[02:14:48.899 --> 02:14:52.641]  Go ahead!
[02:14:52.641 --> 02:15:00.287]  Take our restraint as weakness and fill your stinky little hands.
[02:15:00.287 --> 02:15:01.528]  Because we do the hanging around here.
[02:15:01.528 --> 02:15:03.129]  Let's find out.
[02:15:03.129 --> 02:15:04.350]  Go ahead.
[02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:07.872]  Keep pushing.
[02:15:07.872 --> 02:15:13.036]  Representative Ryan seeks unity from House GOP to run for Speaker.
[02:15:17.714 --> 02:15:18.575]  Isn't that nice?
[02:15:18.575 --> 02:15:19.215]  Unity!
[02:15:19.215 --> 02:15:27.180]  Oh, the Republicans are in shambles as they get behind Paul Ryan, who wants open borders, gun control, everything else in the past, but now he doesn't want that.
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:29.322]  Everything's okay.
[02:15:29.322 --> 02:15:33.965]  And then we have the CNN headline, Paul Ryan's new partner, Obama!
[02:15:33.965 --> 02:15:36.907]  They're supporting putting Paul Ryan in.
[02:15:36.907 --> 02:15:40.089]  Conservative activists are targeting Paul Ryan, National Review reports.
[02:15:42.042 --> 02:15:47.546]  But don't worry, political reports on Harry Reid offer surprise support for Ryan as Speaker.
[02:15:47.546 --> 02:15:50.248]  And of course, that doesn't matter, he's in the Senate.
[02:15:50.248 --> 02:15:55.072]  Pelosi says they've got him to vote, so the Democrats will put him in with the Republicans.
[02:15:55.072 --> 02:16:01.557]  And whoever votes for Ryan as a Republican, get him out of office.
[02:16:01.557 --> 02:16:03.979]  Ryan's also come out against Thomas Jefferson.
[02:16:03.979 --> 02:16:05.560]  You can't make that up.
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:06.781]  That's in the Washington Times.
[02:16:06.781 --> 02:16:10.384]  He's a perfect candidate, isn't he?
[02:16:10.384 --> 02:16:10.985]  Joe Biden?
[02:16:13.436 --> 02:16:16.597]  Of course, has stepped down.
[02:16:16.597 --> 02:16:18.938]  Joe Biden won't run for president.
[02:16:18.938 --> 02:16:25.081]  But he says he will not be silent.
[02:16:25.081 --> 02:16:26.601]  We'll cover more of that dribble later.
[02:16:26.601 --> 02:16:31.143]  Of course, Joe Biden also told us that he would not be coming after any of our firearms.
[02:16:31.143 --> 02:16:33.064]  None of them!
[02:16:33.064 --> 02:16:36.045]  Total lie!
[02:16:36.045 --> 02:16:37.466]  Okay.
[02:16:37.466 --> 02:16:41.207]  I am very, very pleased.
[02:16:41.207 --> 02:16:42.408]  I just had my bio here.
[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:46.001]  Or my guests.
[02:16:46.001 --> 02:16:46.781]  And now I don't.
[02:16:46.781 --> 02:16:47.962]  Here it is.
[02:16:47.962 --> 02:16:51.925]  I'm very, very pleased to have the author of the Economic Collapse blog.
[02:16:51.925 --> 02:16:53.005]  He carries stuff every day.
[02:16:53.005 --> 02:16:53.766]  He's a prolific writer.
[02:16:53.766 --> 02:16:55.327]  Really great research.
[02:16:55.327 --> 02:16:57.408]  Just links to what he's saying.
[02:16:59.244 --> 02:17:04.185]  And he joins us, he's the author of two books, The Beginning of the End and Get Prepared Now.
[02:17:04.185 --> 02:17:06.386]  Look, I wish there wasn't a quote, incoming.
[02:17:06.386 --> 02:17:10.907]  They have a designed implosion that they want to then bring in their world government on top of.
[02:17:10.907 --> 02:17:15.968]  But even though it's called the Economic Collapse Blog, he reports on a lot of other geopolitical activities and developments.
[02:17:15.968 --> 02:17:18.128]  Here are some of his latest articles.
[02:17:18.128 --> 02:17:23.449]  America looks a lot like Nazi Germany did just prior to World War II.
[02:17:23.449 --> 02:17:26.150]  A lot of economists are saying that, and a lot of historians as well.
[02:17:27.622 --> 02:17:32.543]  Goodbye middle class, 51% of all American workers make less than $30,000 a year.
[02:17:32.543 --> 02:17:35.644]  That's this article that's out today.
[02:17:35.644 --> 02:17:39.585]  Global trade is collapsing as the worldwide economic recession deepens.
[02:17:39.585 --> 02:17:41.286]  That was yesterday.
[02:17:41.286 --> 02:17:45.887]  Preview of World War III, Russia is putting on a display of firepower that is shocking the world.
[02:17:46.806 --> 02:17:47.926]  That's all coming up.
[02:17:47.926 --> 02:17:50.307]  But let me just ask Michael Snowden, he'll be with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:17:50.307 --> 02:17:52.108]  We've got the fourth hour coming up.
[02:17:52.108 --> 02:17:54.009]  We'll take some calls as well.
[02:17:54.009 --> 02:18:05.934]  Out of all the things going on, what for you, as somebody in the new real media, don't want to say alternative media, what for you concerns you most in this conflagration of craziness?
[02:18:05.934 --> 02:18:08.815]  Because you have a lot of articles for folks who don't know who you are, most of them do.
[02:18:10.046 --> 02:18:17.774]  The Read Info Wars every day, where you'll have like, you know, 50 points, 60 points, 100 points, that just show all the craziness going on.
[02:18:17.774 --> 02:18:21.238]  Is this a method of the madness or has the elite gone completely insane?
[02:18:22.717 --> 02:18:25.199]  I think the elite are going completely insane.
[02:18:25.199 --> 02:18:33.666]  I think right now we're seeing this huge push toward a global government, a global economy, and a global religion.
[02:18:33.666 --> 02:18:38.230]  For example, what just happened at the end of September with these new global goals?
[02:18:38.230 --> 02:18:46.998]  It was one of the biggest pushes and steps toward a global government we've ever seen, and yet the alternative media is not really talking that much about it.
[02:18:47.518 --> 02:18:57.631]  If you go on YouTube, you can pull up this video where some of the biggest celebrities in the entire world, they're telling us we need to get behind these new global goals that the UN just put out there.
[02:18:57.631 --> 02:19:02.697]  You know, they took Agenda 21, which we've heard about for years, and this is kind of the next generation.
[02:19:02.697 --> 02:19:03.118]  There's these 17
[02:19:04.239 --> 02:19:08.362]  Global goals that they're saying we have to get behind, we have to support.
[02:19:08.362 --> 02:19:17.367]  And when they launched this in September, they did September 25th, the Pope traveled to New York City to give the address to kick off this conference where it was unveiled.
[02:19:17.367 --> 02:19:24.272]  And virtually every single nation on the entire planet willingly signed up for these 17 global goals.
[02:19:24.272 --> 02:19:29.035]  And then the next day, September 26th, in Central Park in New York City,
[02:19:29.535 --> 02:19:39.686]  They held what was called a Global Citizen Festival, where Beyonce and many of the largest musical acts in the entire world, they held this great musical festival.
[02:19:39.686 --> 02:19:43.169]  They said, we've got to get behind these global goals.
[02:19:43.169 --> 02:19:46.373]  And essentially, it's a template for a new world order.
[02:19:46.793 --> 02:19:54.600]  Let's talk about those 17 goals when we come back with the man that heads up EconomicCollapseBlog.com, Michael Schneider.
[02:19:54.600 --> 02:19:55.641]  I'm Alex Jones.

[02:21:57.765 --> 02:22:01.306]  Young people are supposed to be full of energy and recover quickly from exercise.
[02:22:01.306 --> 02:22:04.908]  Their age should give them a great advantage to feeling good all the time.
[02:22:04.908 --> 02:22:10.830]  However, young people of today are dealing with the same nutrient-deficient food as everyone else in America.

[02:22:22.075 --> 02:22:25.016]  At the end of a tiring work shift, I used to not do much around the house.
[02:22:25.256 --> 02:22:35.643]  Since I started taking the new Technology Enhance One World Way after work, I have so much energy when I get home that I'm able to take long walks, do chores, and even honey the do list from the wife.
[02:22:35.643 --> 02:22:40.346]  It's plenty enough energy to get things done around the house and time to settle down before bedtime.

[02:24:12.942 --> 02:24:17.226]  But I got one.
[02:24:17.226 --> 02:24:19.268]  You're the devil in disguise.
[02:24:30.888 --> 02:24:35.833]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment and this story.
[02:24:35.833 --> 02:24:43.701]  Five back-to-the-future Big Brother predictions that came true, which are welling in technologies, was the movie right about.
[02:24:43.701 --> 02:24:51.790]  We break it all down in the article put out by Kit Daniels and Infowars.com just about five minutes ago.
[02:24:53.615 --> 02:25:02.342]  I want to get into these 17 global planks and the fact that suddenly world government is being openly announced with our guest Michael Schneider.
[02:25:02.342 --> 02:25:09.147]  But first, King Paul, I'm reading from Drudge, King Paul pledged allegiance by Friday.
[02:25:09.147 --> 02:25:13.651]  He has an F rating from conservative groups.
[02:25:13.651 --> 02:25:18.815]  Of course, he's being endorsed by Obama and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi.
[02:25:18.815 --> 02:25:21.277]  People say, well, that'll hurt him.
[02:25:21.277 --> 02:25:22.678]  No, they're going to vote for him.
[02:25:24.411 --> 02:25:29.763]  They've got the Democrats are all being told, get ready to vote for Paul Ryan.
[02:25:29.763 --> 02:25:32.208]  What does that tell you about the Republican leadership?
[02:25:34.721 --> 02:25:37.202]  I mean, this is as big as the presidential election for me.
[02:25:37.202 --> 02:25:44.425]  And, Schneider, I want to get back into global government, why you think they're accelerating it right now, what else you're looking at, but what do you make of this speaker race?
[02:25:44.425 --> 02:25:46.766]  I mean, this is such a big thing.
[02:25:46.766 --> 02:25:49.167]  Paul Ryan is so bad news.
[02:25:49.167 --> 02:25:51.528]  We just had a decade of Boehner.
[02:25:51.528 --> 02:25:57.491]  I mean, can't we just have some good, decent second party in Congress, not one party?
[02:25:57.491 --> 02:25:58.811]  Isn't this getting obvious?
[02:25:58.811 --> 02:26:03.033]  Do you think they're really arrogant enough to install the Democrat votes, Paul Ryan?
[02:26:04.668 --> 02:26:17.551]  It makes me so angry because we just saw the Republican leadership pave the way for Obama with this fast-track negotiating authority for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was a giant step toward integrating the global economy.
[02:26:17.551 --> 02:26:29.853]  This Trans-Pacific Partnership is going to cover 40% of global GDP, you know, and basically Obama's putting all kinds of things in this treaty that he couldn't get through Congress any other way.
[02:26:29.853 --> 02:26:34.094]  So, you know, we've seen the Republicans advance the Obama agenda this way,
[02:26:34.674 --> 02:26:40.139]  But see, the Republican leadership in Congress, they're essentially just another plank of the Democrats.
[02:26:40.139 --> 02:26:44.222]  They don't want the true conservatives to take control no matter what.
[02:26:44.222 --> 02:26:48.805]  And so they're willing to do anything, the Republicans and the Democrats, to keep them from happening.
[02:26:48.805 --> 02:26:51.868]  It makes me so angry because we don't have a choice.
[02:26:51.868 --> 02:26:59.394]  One way or the other, the agenda of the globalists is going to advance, and they don't give us any other options.
[02:27:02.273 --> 02:27:08.276]  I asked this question of Ron Paul earlier, I ask it of everybody, and I want your take as I read your articles, you're obviously a smart guy.
[02:27:08.276 --> 02:27:11.358]  Are they accelerating it because they're behind schedule?
[02:27:11.358 --> 02:27:13.999]  Or because they're ahead of schedule?
[02:27:13.999 --> 02:27:15.100]  Or because they're arrogant?
[02:27:16.005 --> 02:27:20.408]  And, you know, why are they moving so quick when it's waking up so many people?
[02:27:20.408 --> 02:27:26.493]  I mean, why would Hillary come out and say, yeah, we want to repeal the Second Amendment and have mass gun confiscation?
[02:27:26.493 --> 02:27:31.297]  I mean, they're really almost making us passe when the Pope's calling for world government.
[02:27:31.297 --> 02:27:36.861]  So how do they have the Southern Poverty Law Center saying none of this is happening while their official mouthpieces
[02:27:38.288 --> 02:27:43.531]  Openly announce and confirm everything we've said, exploding our credibility.
[02:27:43.531 --> 02:27:47.773]  Are they, exploding it in a good way, are they just that disconnected?
[02:27:47.773 --> 02:27:48.253]  What's happening?
[02:27:49.554 --> 02:27:52.756]  Well, I think they just have extreme amounts of arrogance.
[02:27:52.756 --> 02:27:55.078]  They control the mainstream media.
[02:27:55.078 --> 02:28:03.985]  Essentially, more than 90% of everything we get through our television, through the media, is controlled by just six gigantic media corporations.
[02:28:03.985 --> 02:28:12.211]  The Washington Post recently reported that the average American watches 293 minutes of television a day.
[02:28:12.211 --> 02:28:17.815]  Now, that's almost five hours of television a day.
[02:28:18.275 --> 02:28:30.628]  And so, like I said, more than 90% of what's being fed into our minds, this programming, and they call it programming for a reason, and so they control what we think about, what we talk about with our friends, with our family at the water cooler.
[02:28:30.628 --> 02:28:36.093]  It's a sporting event we just saw, something on television, a television show, what we saw on the news.
[02:28:36.093 --> 02:28:39.877]  And so they tell us what to think, what to talk about with our family and friends.
[02:28:40.337 --> 02:28:42.999]  And so they feel like they've got total control.
[02:28:42.999 --> 02:28:46.040]  And what they like to do is they like to create a great crisis.
[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:49.983]  And so I believe that we are headed into a time of great economic crisis.
[02:28:49.983 --> 02:28:53.685]  A global recession has already started, and we can talk about those numbers.
[02:28:53.685 --> 02:29:01.970]  And when they bring this moment of great crisis, they use these crises to bring the problem, then there's a reaction, and then they bring the solution.
[02:29:01.970 --> 02:29:07.633]  And so I think they're accelerating it, and they're preparing us to go into this time of great crisis.
[02:29:07.633 --> 02:29:09.214]  And every solution they're going to offer us
[02:29:09.594 --> 02:29:14.416]  It's going to involve more centralization, more globalization, more militarization.
[02:29:14.416 --> 02:29:22.921]  You know, we just saw the Obama administration come out and say, okay, we're creating this brand new position that's going to focus on domestic extremists.
[02:29:22.921 --> 02:29:26.422]  Of course, it's not the communists, it's not the leftists they're going to focus on.
[02:29:26.422 --> 02:29:31.665]  They're going to focus on people like us, people that watch your show, people that come to my websites.
[02:29:31.665 --> 02:29:33.426]  They're the people that they want to focus on.
[02:29:33.946 --> 02:29:34.947]  Absolutely, stay there.
[02:29:34.947 --> 02:29:36.629]  Let's cover that when we come back.
[02:29:36.629 --> 02:29:41.414]  And they admit, I mean, the Supreme Court's warning people and others, they're coming for free speech right now.
[02:29:41.414 --> 02:29:43.836]  I mean, this is their totalitarian move.
[02:29:43.836 --> 02:29:46.599]  This is a full-on war, folks.
[02:29:46.599 --> 02:29:48.201]  Are you going to join in on the fight?
[02:29:48.201 --> 02:29:49.582]  We're on the march.
[02:29:49.582 --> 02:29:52.125]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.125 --> 02:29:54.788]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.612 --> 02:30:09.722]  The 21 Gun Salute, a time-honored tradition that has been celebrating veterans for years, is now banned by an Iowa high school.
[02:30:09.722 --> 02:30:18.993]  According to an NBC affiliate, administrators at Belle Plaine High School say that the salute, quote, promotes gun violence, end quote, but common sense hasn't
[02:30:19.053 --> 02:30:19.593]  We're good to go.
[02:30:39.111 --> 02:30:53.341]  In other schools across the nation, anti-gun hysteria has manifested in students being suspended or expelled for playing with toy guns, biting pastries into gun shapes, and even making gun gestures with their hands.
[02:30:53.341 --> 02:30:57.264]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[02:30:58.695 --> 02:31:02.538]  As any regular listener knows, I don't script what I have to say.
[02:31:02.538 --> 02:31:07.221]  I do my research, and then I tell it like it is, and let the chips fall where they may.
[02:31:07.221 --> 02:31:08.982]  And I'm gonna do that right now.
[02:31:08.982 --> 02:31:14.626]  I have never, in my 20 years on air, seen a time where it's more important to be prepared.
[02:31:14.626 --> 02:31:19.169]  Even most mainline analysts are now saying, we've entered this critical juncture.
[02:31:19.329 --> 02:31:21.169]  We've got to get prepared.
[02:31:21.169 --> 02:31:24.150]  Everyone knows I'm obsessed with win-win situations.

[02:31:56.479 --> 02:32:01.981]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:32:01.981 --> 02:32:06.783]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[02:32:06.783 --> 02:32:07.244]  I don't know.
[02:32:28.334 --> 02:32:29.455]  BrainForce is here.
[02:32:29.455 --> 02:32:31.656]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[02:32:31.656 --> 02:32:36.660]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:32:36.660 --> 02:32:38.341]  There's always hidden additives in your food.
[02:32:38.341 --> 02:32:39.942]  Even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:32:39.942 --> 02:32:43.425]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:32:43.425 --> 02:32:45.406]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[02:32:45.406 --> 02:32:46.347]  It doesn't have stimulants.
[02:32:46.347 --> 02:32:47.548]  It doesn't have garbage in it.
[02:32:47.548 --> 02:32:49.529]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[02:33:08.641 --> 02:33:14.803]  If you let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up.
[02:33:14.803 --> 02:33:19.805]  Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one.
[02:33:19.805 --> 02:33:24.666]  And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life.
[02:33:24.666 --> 02:33:26.667]  It's not about food.
[02:33:26.667 --> 02:33:29.208]  It's about keeping those ants in line.
[02:33:35.911 --> 02:33:38.053]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:38.053 --> 02:33:48.661]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:48.661 --> 02:33:51.042]  Shane.
[02:33:51.042 --> 02:33:53.124]  Roscoe.
[02:33:53.124 --> 02:33:53.524]  Raymond.
[02:33:55.422 --> 02:34:06.255]  Jimmy, Mike, we'll get to all your calls coming up here in a few minutes and our guests can ride shotgun with us and obviously comment on anything you raise because he writes every day about what's happening in our world and makes a lot of important points.
[02:34:06.255 --> 02:34:07.296]  Michael Schneider joins us.
[02:34:08.277 --> 02:34:09.078]  I want to get someone to this.
[02:34:09.078 --> 02:34:19.965]  America looks a lot like Nazi Germany did prior to World War II as well, but I'm not here trying to bash Islam in general because the truth is the West has done a lot to destabilize those countries.
[02:34:19.965 --> 02:34:30.333]  The State Department for 60 years has tried to radicalize Islam with textbooks that were funded and other things as a quote, bulwark against the Soviet Union.
[02:34:30.333 --> 02:34:36.117]  The truth is Saudi Arabia was put in by British intelligence in the last 90 years.
[02:34:36.117 --> 02:34:36.878]  The truth is
[02:34:39.002 --> 02:34:41.684]  That they've set them up to dominate the region.
[02:34:41.684 --> 02:34:43.486]  And look at this Daily Mail story.
[02:34:43.486 --> 02:34:48.870]  This has been out for a few days, but it's really gotten crazy now, the details.
[02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:53.894]  I'm a prince, this came out from the police, and I can do whatever I want.
[02:34:53.894 --> 02:35:03.702]  Cocaine-crazed Saudi royal threatened to kill Los Angeles mansion staff who watched him being pleasured by a male aide who he ordered to watch.
[02:35:06.465 --> 02:35:11.088]  And now these same people, he's one of the top princes, is threatening to attack Russia.
[02:35:11.088 --> 02:35:12.088]  We'll just have nuclear war!
[02:35:12.088 --> 02:35:17.292]  Just because this guy thinks he's invincible and wants to throw a Tinder tantrum.
[02:35:17.292 --> 02:35:22.175]  And then it goes on to the mansion full of female escorts.
[02:35:22.175 --> 02:35:26.738]  Then I guess that wasn't enough for him.
[02:35:26.738 --> 02:35:32.181]  He would tell women, you're going to go upstairs, I will be there in two minutes, and you will do whatever I want.
[02:35:32.181 --> 02:35:33.682]  If not, then I will kill you!
[02:35:36.852 --> 02:35:39.113]  Imagine living in a country under these people.
[02:35:39.113 --> 02:35:42.334]  I mean, they didn't control but about 100 square miles and it was 200 square miles.
[02:35:42.334 --> 02:35:48.496]  If you go back to like 1901, they controlled a caravan route going by Mecca.
[02:35:48.496 --> 02:35:54.037]  And they literally are a band of kidnappers, robbers, who then called themselves royal.
[02:35:54.037 --> 02:35:55.778]  The British gave them weapons.
[02:35:55.778 --> 02:35:56.378]  They took over.
[02:36:00.834 --> 02:36:01.795]  I mean, it is just crazy.
[02:36:01.795 --> 02:36:06.058]  And they've been feeding on the poor Arabs and Muslims in the area ever since.
[02:36:06.058 --> 02:36:09.181]  I mean, there is just... It's such a joke.
[02:36:09.181 --> 02:36:16.187]  I mean, look at the photo I'm showing TV viewers of the current king of Saudi Arabia.
[02:36:16.187 --> 02:36:19.610]  And these guys own part of Fox News and all its propaganda.
[02:36:24.141 --> 02:36:31.547]  But the feminist groups, which is like Hillary, want to say mom and dad, boy and girl, father and mother is hurtful.
[02:36:31.547 --> 02:36:41.675]  I want to tell five-year-olds, you know, call them into the principal's office for saying boy or girl, or a kid says I want some gum, and they go that sounds like gun, and they lock the school down.
[02:36:41.675 --> 02:36:43.377]  We're being taught to be these basket cake
[02:36:44.437 --> 02:36:56.185]  Case mental patients, afraid of words, while we have Ferrari, Lamborghini driving Saudi princes, you know, running into people and saying, I can do whatever I want, and they've got diplomatic immunity, they can.
[02:36:56.185 --> 02:37:02.910]  But it's not just these guys that are doing this with their conspicuous consumption.
[02:37:02.910 --> 02:37:10.515]  The UN, the globalists, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the British Royalty, they're all into the same stuff.
[02:37:10.515 --> 02:37:11.376]  Jimmy Savelle.
[02:37:13.715 --> 02:37:16.956]  The admitted pedophile running the BBC racket.
[02:37:16.956 --> 02:37:19.017]  Best friends with Prince Charles.
[02:37:19.017 --> 02:37:21.738]  God help us!
[02:37:21.738 --> 02:37:25.599]  These people see us as animals, as meat on a plate to be eaten.
[02:37:25.599 --> 02:37:27.260]  Well, I'm not your slave.
[02:37:27.260 --> 02:37:38.784]  I'm not here to be under your world government where you're tax exempt above the law and can kill whoever you want and have disarmed us so you don't have any fear of what you do to us with your armed mercenaries.
[02:37:40.367 --> 02:37:42.954]  Thank God our founders put a Second Amendment in.
[02:37:42.954 --> 02:37:44.959]  Thank God they knew what was coming.
[02:37:44.959 --> 02:37:48.308]  And now here we are, putting up the final fight against all of you.
[02:37:50.029 --> 02:37:52.530]  Going back to Michael Steiner, I appreciate joining us.
[02:37:52.530 --> 02:37:54.331]  The Economic Collapse Blog.com.
[02:37:54.331 --> 02:37:56.032]  Get into your 17 points.
[02:37:56.032 --> 02:38:01.515]  Get into the parallels with America and what we saw before World War II and other points you think are key to cover.
[02:38:01.515 --> 02:38:16.703]  But before that, what do you make of the most corrupt, crazy people known to be involved in the import and export of children, known to have harems full of kidnapped women, and now they come here to America and they go, we're above the law, no one can touch us.
[02:38:16.703 --> 02:38:17.783]  And you know what?
[02:38:17.783 --> 02:38:18.644]  They are above the law.
[02:38:19.304 --> 02:38:22.886]  And do they want to drag our daughter off the street into one of these spider holes?
[02:38:22.886 --> 02:38:24.327]  They can!
[02:38:24.327 --> 02:38:26.789]  And we're just to sit here and take it, my friend.
[02:38:26.789 --> 02:38:29.551]  I mean, our humiliation is really getting crazy.
[02:38:29.551 --> 02:38:31.172]  Go ahead.
[02:38:31.172 --> 02:38:32.572]  Yeah, just look at the Clintons.
[02:38:32.572 --> 02:38:39.397]  They've got a trail of skeletons and dead bodies going all the way back to the 1980s, and yet the mainstream media leaves them alone.
[02:38:39.397 --> 02:38:44.660]  Bill Clinton has been documented that Bill Clinton, he's still sleeping around with women.
[02:38:44.660 --> 02:38:47.382]  One of his recent girlfriends was known as the Energizer.
[02:38:47.802 --> 02:38:51.703]  And that was the code name that the Secret Service agents had for her.
[02:38:51.703 --> 02:38:53.064]  She would bring them cookies.
[02:38:53.064 --> 02:38:56.525]  It's all been documented, and yet the mainstream media doesn't talk about it.
[02:38:56.525 --> 02:39:01.166]  Hillary Clinton has had a trail of female lovers that goes back for many, many years.
[02:39:01.166 --> 02:39:03.247]  The mainstream media says nothing about it.
[02:39:03.247 --> 02:39:08.668]  And yet candidates that they don't like, they pick on any little thing, any little word, any little phrase that they say.
[02:39:08.668 --> 02:39:12.450]  The mainstream media jumps on those things, yet the Clintons are untouchable.
[02:39:12.450 --> 02:39:13.730]  They don't talk about any of those.
[02:39:14.250 --> 02:39:23.917]  Scandals in the mainstream media is is shameful here in the United States in the way that they treat favored candidates rather than unfavored candidates.
[02:39:23.917 --> 02:39:26.099]  I mean the corruption is all around us.
[02:39:26.099 --> 02:39:29.501]  You know, I in the old days before I did what I do today.
[02:39:29.501 --> 02:39:32.664]  I worked in as an attorney right in the heart of Washington DC.
[02:39:32.664 --> 02:39:34.245]  I saw the corruption all around me.
[02:39:34.625 --> 02:39:35.986]  It was horrible.
[02:39:35.986 --> 02:39:47.354]  And I remember back in those days, about a decade ago, I would put on my headphones sometimes when I could while I was at work and listen to the Alex Jones Show right there in the bowels of Washington, D.C.
[02:39:47.354 --> 02:39:51.497]  And in those days, your internet feed kind of sounded like it was coming out of a tin can.
[02:39:51.497 --> 02:39:53.758]  This was like a decade ago or so.
[02:39:53.758 --> 02:39:58.562]  But I was becoming so concerned about the direction of this country because we saw the corruption all around us.
[02:39:58.562 --> 02:40:01.364]  But now it's gone to an entirely new level.
[02:40:02.185 --> 02:40:04.647]  But see, most Americans are feeling good about things.
[02:40:04.647 --> 02:40:16.341]  The other day my wife and I were watching television, and we saw some footage of Nazi Germany before World War II, and they had these beautiful parades, the pageantry, the beauty of everything that was going on.
[02:40:16.741 --> 02:40:22.784]  But it really masked an evil and an insidious agenda which was going on underneath.
[02:40:22.784 --> 02:40:25.426]  And I believe the same thing is true in America today.
[02:40:25.426 --> 02:40:28.147]  You turn on the television, everything's so beautiful.
[02:40:28.147 --> 02:40:29.668]  We've got our football games.
[02:40:29.668 --> 02:40:31.489]  The bands are playing.
[02:40:31.489 --> 02:40:34.390]  Everything looks just so clean and wonderful and beautiful.
[02:40:34.390 --> 02:40:36.492]  And people say, oh, America's so great.
[02:40:36.492 --> 02:40:37.192]  But underneath,
[02:40:37.732 --> 02:40:41.274]  Is a wickedness and an evil and an insidious agenda.
[02:40:41.274 --> 02:40:44.175]  We truly are becoming just like Nazi Germany.
[02:40:44.175 --> 02:40:49.157]  We once fought a great war to rid the world of the Nazis, but now we're becoming just like them.
[02:40:51.047 --> 02:41:12.700]  And to illustrate that, Bernie Sanders comes out and says, we need to have China-style family leave, and James Woods goes, you utter moron, but he's not a moron, he knows what he's doing, you utter moron, China has killed 50 million girls, including many of them after they're born, what do you mean we should mimic what Communist China has done?
[02:41:13.663 --> 02:41:20.704]  But see, while you have real sexism killing women, China gets praised for, quote, putting women in positions of power.
[02:41:20.704 --> 02:41:29.366]  It's this inversion, or this twisting, where women are being forced into the workforce by design to take over the children.
[02:41:29.366 --> 02:41:32.447]  They're being prepared for selective service for the draft.
[02:41:32.447 --> 02:41:35.047]  That's being sold like some wonderful right.
[02:41:35.047 --> 02:41:37.148]  You get to be enslaved as well.
[02:41:37.148 --> 02:41:39.188]  And then meanwhile, a national news story
[02:41:41.035 --> 02:41:52.257]  Dealing with Target doing a joke ad, putting Luke Skywalker's head on Princess Leia's body as a joke, as a trendy joke.
[02:41:52.257 --> 02:41:54.238]  I wouldn't wear a Star Wars shirt, but I might wear that one.
[02:41:54.238 --> 02:41:54.678]  It's funny.
[02:41:54.678 --> 02:41:56.878]  I mean, you only wear one to be nerdly.
[02:41:56.878 --> 02:41:58.739]  You wear one as a joke.
[02:41:58.739 --> 02:42:01.059]  You don't wear it because you're cool.
[02:42:01.059 --> 02:42:04.000]  I mean, I do wear Star Wars shirts occasionally because they're so ridiculous.
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:06.701]  But, I brought the dark side.
[02:42:06.701 --> 02:42:07.521]  What did you bring?
[02:42:07.521 --> 02:42:10.102]  It's when Darth Vader's saying, you're a pawn of the Rebel Alliance.
[02:42:10.102 --> 02:42:10.643]  Don't trade her.
[02:42:10.643 --> 02:42:11.703]  Take her away.
[02:42:11.703 --> 02:42:13.544]  And they stuck Luke Skywalker's head on it.
[02:42:13.544 --> 02:42:14.904]  It's hilarious!
[02:42:14.904 --> 02:42:20.887]  They've banned the shirt because people complained on Twitter saying it was sexist.
[02:42:20.887 --> 02:42:24.668]  See, every hero has to be a woman now in the movies.
[02:42:24.668 --> 02:42:26.009]  I don't care if women are heroes.
[02:42:26.009 --> 02:42:27.249]  Great!
[02:42:27.249 --> 02:42:30.571]  I like movies where women are heroes, if they're a good actress.
[02:42:30.571 --> 02:42:33.792]  But if they're not a good actress, we don't want to see it.
[02:42:35.049 --> 02:42:36.852]  We don't want to be part of it.
[02:42:36.852 --> 02:42:39.576]  It's like the Anakin Skywalker character.
[02:42:39.576 --> 02:42:41.399]  A horrible actor.
[02:42:41.399 --> 02:42:44.705]  People hated him because he sucked.
[02:42:44.705 --> 02:42:44.985]  Okay?
[02:42:46.155 --> 02:42:48.976]  This new black actor they've got, the new star.
[02:42:48.976 --> 02:42:50.696]  I mean, people have seen him in the trailer.
[02:42:50.696 --> 02:42:54.718]  He looks like he's an after school, you know, special actor.
[02:42:54.718 --> 02:42:56.578]  I mean, he's a terrible actor.
[02:42:56.578 --> 02:42:57.198]  I can say that.
[02:42:57.198 --> 02:42:58.499]  I've been in some big movies.
[02:42:58.499 --> 02:43:00.119]  He's a terrible actor.
[02:43:00.119 --> 02:43:03.840]  And they've got plenty of black guys that can pull off a good role.
[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:06.981]  You know, like the guy they had playing the black Jedi leader.
[02:43:06.981 --> 02:43:07.821]  He's a great actor.
[02:43:10.071 --> 02:43:12.753]  Again, they turned that into, it must be racism.
[02:43:12.753 --> 02:43:13.533]  Well, yeah!
[02:43:13.533 --> 02:43:17.736]  They have white supremacists coming out, saying they're mad there's a black guy in a movie.
[02:43:17.736 --> 02:43:24.240]  So see, then their extremism, next to the other extremism, makes it look reasonable.
[02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:26.942]  Because really, nobody complained about Samuel L. Jackson.
[02:43:26.942 --> 02:43:35.148]  They are complaining about this new guy, because he looks like he's 12 years old, and he's a horrible actor, just like the other screwball's name, who happens to be white.
[02:43:35.148 --> 02:43:39.611]  But, again, the public is only informed about all this mindless minutia,
[02:43:40.311 --> 02:43:55.120]  I'll guarantee you folks that they really are scared at Target and have done this now, removing the Luke Skywalker from the t-shirt because showing a man again is sexist.
[02:43:55.120 --> 02:43:57.622]  Men existing is sexist.
[02:43:57.622 --> 02:43:59.023]  They don't get a joke.
[02:43:59.023 --> 02:43:59.983]  Why is it?
[02:43:59.983 --> 02:44:02.385]  What do you think about the modern so-called feminist movement?
[02:44:03.934 --> 02:44:05.075]  It makes me so angry.
[02:44:05.075 --> 02:44:10.540]  These little politically correct things which get blown up in the media, and that's what everyone gets all upset about.
[02:44:10.540 --> 02:44:15.645]  Meanwhile, there's these earth-shattering things that are happening.
[02:44:15.645 --> 02:44:21.450]  Over the past six months or so, we've had these Planned Parenthood videos come out where they show that
[02:44:21.950 --> 02:44:32.079]  You know, Planned Parenthood is killing millions of babies, chopping them up, harvesting their organs, selling them off to the highest bidder, where they're used in bizarre scientific experiments.
[02:44:32.079 --> 02:44:39.865]  This has been put on display for the whole world to see, and after all these videos have come out, the American people have clearly seen what's happening.
[02:44:39.865 --> 02:44:44.970]  Well, just recently in USA Today, a survey was taken, and they asked the American people
[02:44:45.410 --> 02:44:49.071]  They asked them, okay, should we cut off funding for Planned Parenthood?
[02:44:49.071 --> 02:44:52.552]  And when I first saw that, I thought, okay, maybe it'll be about 50-50.
[02:44:52.552 --> 02:45:04.195]  Well, what the survey found, by more than a two-to-one margin, the American people want the federal government to continue to give Planned Parenthood hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
[02:45:04.195 --> 02:45:11.077]  The question wasn't whether we should shut them down or not, but it was whether we should keep giving them hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money a year.
[02:45:11.077 --> 02:45:11.377]  It was 65% to 29%.
[02:45:11.377 --> 02:45:12.037]  So at this point,
[02:45:15.078 --> 02:45:22.080]  Only 29% of all Americans even want to cut off funding to Planned Parenthood after everything that's been revealed.
[02:45:22.080 --> 02:45:24.741]  You know, that tells me that America is done.
[02:45:24.741 --> 02:45:26.461]  America is finished.
[02:45:26.461 --> 02:45:27.862]  We're in decline.
[02:45:27.862 --> 02:45:29.782]  We're totally out of control.
[02:45:29.782 --> 02:45:31.503]  Social decay is all around us.
[02:45:31.843 --> 02:45:37.647]  We're the fattest, we're the stupidest, we're the most arrogant, we are exceptional slobs.
[02:45:37.647 --> 02:45:38.968]  And that doesn't mean all of us.
[02:45:38.968 --> 02:45:41.810]  We still are exceptionally good, those of us that are awake.
[02:45:41.810 --> 02:45:43.231]  We still have a lot of innovations.
[02:45:43.231 --> 02:45:46.113]  But man, you're right, we are rotting.
[02:45:46.113 --> 02:45:52.938]  And imagine how dangerous these piranha people will be, who have no empathy, who don't care about the unborn.
[02:45:52.938 --> 02:45:55.539]  Imagine how dangerous they'll be during a full collapse.
[02:45:56.460 --> 02:45:58.301]  I know that's something you've really researched.
[02:45:58.301 --> 02:46:03.444]  What do you expect to happen if there's a full collapse and not just a slow rot?
[02:46:03.444 --> 02:46:09.407]  Well, today we've got most of the population are packed in these mega city areas.
[02:46:09.407 --> 02:46:16.230]  Most people, over half the country, doesn't even have a three-day supply of emergency food or water.
[02:46:16.230 --> 02:46:19.692]  62% of all Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[02:46:20.132 --> 02:46:24.795]  And so, just like we saw in 2008, when things start happening, people start losing their jobs.
[02:46:24.795 --> 02:46:26.836]  They're not going to be able to pay the mortgage.
[02:46:26.836 --> 02:46:32.058]  Millions of people are going to lose their homes, I believe, in this next great wave of the crisis, which is coming.
[02:46:32.058 --> 02:46:34.199]  And people are going to become desperate.
[02:46:34.199 --> 02:46:35.840]  They're not going to have food for their children.
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:39.322]  They're going to be angry and frustrated already.
[02:46:39.322 --> 02:46:42.564]  We see anger and frustration at unprecedented levels in this country.
[02:46:43.004 --> 02:46:50.176]  So I believe that we are going to see civil unrest on a massive scale in this country, just like we saw in Ferguson, just like we saw in Baltimore.
[02:46:50.176 --> 02:46:53.322]  Spoiled rotten brats running around demanding everything.
[02:46:53.322 --> 02:46:54.363]  I mean, it's just sick.
[02:46:55.779 --> 02:46:58.481]  Yeah, in America today, according to the U.S.
[02:46:58.481 --> 02:47:06.006]  Census Bureau, 49% of all Americans live in a home that receives some form of aid from the federal government every single month.
[02:47:06.006 --> 02:47:07.807]  Well over 100 million Americans.
[02:47:07.807 --> 02:47:12.350]  So, government dependence has spiked to a higher level than ever before.
[02:47:12.350 --> 02:47:18.654]  You know, we've got people that are not self-sufficient, can't take care of themselves, and yet we see the moral decline.
[02:47:18.654 --> 02:47:22.437]  It's not like the Great Depression, when back then we had some hard times, but people could
[02:47:22.817 --> 02:47:28.983]  Handle it and work together and go through the tough times because there was more of a moral fiber in this nation.
[02:47:28.983 --> 02:47:34.268]  And I weep over this nation because I'm not like some of the people that talk about the downfall of America that hate America.
[02:47:34.268 --> 02:47:36.009]  I love the United States.
[02:47:36.009 --> 02:47:42.015]  So I hate the fact that we're seeing this happen to what was once such a great nation.
[02:47:42.015 --> 02:47:44.617]  I weep for the future that's lost.
[02:47:44.617 --> 02:47:47.440]  The future for our children, the future for our grandchildren.
[02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:48.361]  It's really tragic.
[02:47:49.758 --> 02:47:52.680]  Well, again, we're not just here complaining about problems, folks.
[02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:57.564]  It's a fact, and now they want to give us forced inoculations.
[02:47:57.564 --> 02:48:15.038]  So getting back to that question, I know you answered it, but the doubling down on forced inoculations, MSNBC announcing your kids belong to us, the boys and girls bathrooms being pulled out, all of it, is it an attempt to just totally demoralize us, or have the elite themselves gone completely insane?
[02:48:17.078 --> 02:48:20.601]  I think the elite have gone completely insane.
[02:48:20.601 --> 02:48:23.483]  I think they feel like it's time to go for broke.
[02:48:23.483 --> 02:48:27.186]  It's time to really upset the apple cart.
[02:48:27.186 --> 02:48:31.489]  So, a lot of people say, well, why would the elite want an economic collapse?
[02:48:31.489 --> 02:48:33.530]  You know, don't they want things to be stable?
[02:48:33.530 --> 02:48:38.614]  No, when there's a collapse, when there's crisis, it enables them to move things forward.
[02:48:38.614 --> 02:48:41.216]  And I believe we're already seeing the start of this, Alex.
[02:48:41.696 --> 02:48:58.008]  In fact, the largest bank in the Western world, British banking giant HSBC, huge new world order bank, they recently came out and they said that global GDP expressed in US dollars is already down 3.4% this year.
[02:48:58.008 --> 02:49:02.492]  So according to them, we're already in a global dollarized recession.
[02:49:02.492 --> 02:49:07.175]  They also said that global trade is down 8.4% so far this year.
[02:49:07.175 --> 02:49:08.856]  I see it everywhere.
[02:49:08.856 --> 02:49:10.478]  I mean, the economy is stalling.
[02:49:11.403 --> 02:49:17.899]  While the media continues to tell us everything is okay, when do you think the next big plunge is going to be, or will it just be a slow decline?
[02:49:19.454 --> 02:49:23.516]  Well, I believe we have been seeing this decline, which has extended over years.
[02:49:23.516 --> 02:49:27.658]  I believe we have years ahead of us, but I believe it's going to greatly accelerate.
[02:49:27.658 --> 02:49:30.280]  Now, a lot of people, they were hyping up September.
[02:49:30.280 --> 02:49:33.541]  You know, we saw sales of emergency foods skyrocket.
[02:49:33.541 --> 02:49:36.103]  There was so much hype around September.
[02:49:36.103 --> 02:49:40.405]  And so then September came, and it didn't necessarily meet people's expectations.
[02:49:40.405 --> 02:49:42.626]  We did see earth-shattering things happen.
[02:49:42.626 --> 02:49:44.787]  Global financial markets went crazy.
[02:49:44.787 --> 02:49:47.809]  But because it didn't meet the expectations of the end of the world,
[02:49:48.029 --> 02:49:48.690]  We're good to go.
[02:50:09.545 --> 02:50:14.490]  And so we've seen, you know, all of a sudden, all these people out there have said, well, September has passed.
[02:50:14.490 --> 02:50:15.291]  Time to relax.
[02:50:15.291 --> 02:50:17.113]  I'm not going to stop preparing anymore.
[02:50:17.113 --> 02:50:19.155]  I believe that's a tragic mistake.
[02:50:19.155 --> 02:50:19.856]  Oh, it's crazy.
[02:50:19.856 --> 02:50:24.541]  And, you know, that's why it's not good when these Christian groups say, Jesus is coming next year and it doesn't happen.
[02:50:24.541 --> 02:50:26.583]  And they say, all Christians said that.
[02:50:27.303 --> 02:50:29.764]  Or I was saying, I don't believe the Shemitah is going to be anything.
[02:50:29.764 --> 02:50:32.304]  I don't believe these blood moons are going to do anything.
[02:50:32.304 --> 02:50:33.605]  The elite believe in them.
[02:50:33.605 --> 02:50:35.465]  A bunch of big stuff's happening.
[02:50:35.465 --> 02:50:39.606]  But, you know, the big events coming in the fall, the winter, next year, we don't know.
[02:50:39.606 --> 02:50:44.027]  All the indicators are there, but I'm so sick of the people that Planet X will come next year.
[02:50:44.027 --> 02:50:45.008]  It doesn't come.
[02:50:45.008 --> 02:50:46.068]  They go, now it's next year.
[02:50:46.508 --> 02:50:49.510]  And, you know, all this putting dates on stuff is wrong.
[02:50:49.510 --> 02:50:58.315]  All I know is we're sitting on top, thousands of trillions of derivatives, governments digging in for war, they're starting wars, much to the planet's indepression.
[02:50:59.517 --> 02:51:07.283]  NuMana, the true pioneer of healthy storable foods and preparedness products, has gone and done it again.
[02:51:07.283 --> 02:51:14.748]  NuMana is now the first food storage company in the country to offer organic powdered milk, free of hormones.
[02:51:14.748 --> 02:51:17.791]  Our goal is to change the way you look at storable food.

[02:51:58.527 --> 02:52:02.769]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:52:02.769 --> 02:52:03.410]  It's true.
[02:52:03.410 --> 02:52:07.552]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:52:07.552 --> 02:52:09.953]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:52:09.953 --> 02:52:14.416]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.

[02:54:11.630 --> 02:54:21.394]  Alright, I'm going to try to jam in some calls in this segment and the next, then I'm going to throw the baton to Rob Dew, who's hosting the fourth hour today and tell you about some of what's coming up with the Overdrive Show.
[02:54:21.394 --> 02:54:24.435]  But look at this article I meant to get to.
[02:54:24.435 --> 02:54:26.616]  It's up on DrugsReport.com.
[02:54:26.616 --> 02:54:37.021]  I'm going to shoot a Facebook mentions on this subject while the fourth hour's going, so that'll be archived for you on our Facebook page.
[02:54:37.021 --> 02:54:38.622]  But the NRA will fall.
[02:54:38.622 --> 02:54:39.242]  It's inevitable.
[02:54:40.256 --> 02:54:52.704]  And it basically admits, because of the immigrant inflow to big cities, and the people are getting higher educated, they mean brainwashed, that they will get the guns.
[02:54:52.704 --> 02:54:57.827]  And we live in a country where it's like, we will get your guns, you will fall, you will be assimilated, it's over.
[02:54:59.639 --> 02:55:01.099]  We will keep you safe.
[02:55:01.099 --> 02:55:01.980]  We love you.
[02:55:01.980 --> 02:55:02.820]  We love you.
[02:55:02.820 --> 02:55:03.800]  We love you.
[02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:07.081]  Well, it's a bunch of rich elites, like the Saudis.
[02:55:07.081 --> 02:55:07.661]  You can look it up.
[02:55:07.661 --> 02:55:08.941]  Give all this money to take our guns.
[02:55:08.941 --> 02:55:10.762]  Well, they have armed bodyguards.
[02:55:10.762 --> 02:55:14.442]  It's just a bunch of crooks that want us disarmed.
[02:55:14.442 --> 02:55:15.323]  Sick.
[02:55:15.323 --> 02:55:18.163]  Shane in Missouri, you're on the air with our guest Michael Snyder.
[02:55:18.163 --> 02:55:21.404]  Go ahead.
[02:55:21.404 --> 02:55:23.164]  Okay, that was an exciting call.
[02:55:23.164 --> 02:55:25.105]  Roscoe in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:55:25.105 --> 02:55:25.465]  Go ahead.
[02:55:26.570 --> 02:55:31.234]  This will sound unimportant because no one ever talks about it, but that's exactly what makes it important.
[02:55:31.234 --> 02:55:36.998]  And it's about legislated clock resetting.
[02:55:36.998 --> 02:55:40.261]  By what authority does 2am ever become 3am?
[02:55:40.261 --> 02:55:42.342]  A clock was once a scientific instrument.
[02:55:42.342 --> 02:55:45.585]  It's not meant to tell you what time to go to work and what time to go home.
[02:55:45.585 --> 02:55:49.108]  It's to tell you where your piece of the earth is pointed toward the sun.
[02:55:49.108 --> 02:55:55.693]  Sure, under global warming, they may have us shut our thermostats higher to comply with what they're saying, even though we're about to have a record cold winter.
[02:55:56.653 --> 02:56:03.901]  Well, here in the air conditioner belt, it's just common knowledge, it doesn't save electricity, it makes you use more electricity.
[02:56:03.901 --> 02:56:13.391]  They expanded daylight saving under the 2005 energy bill, so now we're on daylight saving 8 months of the year, and only on standard time, 4 months of the year.
[02:56:14.271 --> 02:56:20.554]  And people 30ish or younger don't even have any idea that it's happening.
[02:56:20.554 --> 02:56:25.475]  Here's the real conspiracy of time zones and daylight savings time and different global systems.
[02:56:25.475 --> 02:56:31.718]  It's an attempt to get other countries to sign on to the system as well for global standardization.
[02:56:31.718 --> 02:56:35.719]  WMQM Lister, 1600 AM there in Tennessee.
[02:56:35.719 --> 02:56:36.800]  It's a great point.
[02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:38.640]  Let's ask Schneider about that.
[02:56:38.640 --> 02:56:41.522]  Looks innocuous on the surface, but a lot of folks don't like it.
[02:56:41.522 --> 02:56:42.242]  What's your view?
[02:56:43.479 --> 02:56:46.762]  Well, this is just another example of the micromanaging of our society.
[02:56:46.762 --> 02:56:51.907]  Every year, thousands of new laws and rules and regulations are added on top of what we already have.
[02:56:51.907 --> 02:56:54.949]  Our liberties and freedoms are more restricted every single year.
[02:56:54.949 --> 02:56:59.473]  So we're less free today, as Americans today, than we've ever been before in history.
[02:56:59.473 --> 02:57:04.578]  So this is just another example of how they micromanage and tightly constrain our lives.
[02:57:05.714 --> 02:57:06.994]  Well said.
[02:57:06.994 --> 02:57:08.535]  Roscoe, do a video on it.
[02:57:08.535 --> 02:57:09.795]  Write an article about it for us.
[02:57:09.795 --> 02:57:14.777]  We'll publish it at InfoWars.com if it's decent quality.
[02:57:14.777 --> 02:57:16.218]  Riders at InfoWars.com.
[02:57:16.218 --> 02:57:16.698]  Show tips.
[02:57:16.698 --> 02:57:17.678]  Send articles in, folks.
[02:57:17.678 --> 02:57:18.959]  Send in your commentary.
[02:57:18.959 --> 02:57:20.239]  We want to hear from you.
[02:57:20.239 --> 02:57:21.700]  Raymond in South Carolina.
[02:57:21.700 --> 02:57:22.380]  You're on the air.
[02:57:22.380 --> 02:57:24.000]  Go ahead.
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:24.861]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:57:24.861 --> 02:57:28.062]  Good.
[02:57:28.062 --> 02:57:31.663]  First of all, I just want to let you know I'm a South Carolina National Guard member.
[02:57:32.102 --> 02:57:49.740]  And I'm also a college student here in FEMA Region 4, and I recently called my congressman, Trey Gowdy, to ask why four of my state representatives voted for the TTP fast track bill that you guys have been talking about.
[02:57:51.204 --> 02:58:07.288]  And of course I couldn't get a hold of him, but one of his aides said that, he basically fed me a whole line of rhetoric that that wasn't the bill, they're gonna have plenty of time to vote for it, all they were voting for, it was a vote before the vote sort of thing.
[02:58:07.288 --> 02:58:17.931]  It was a vote to give the president the authority to negotiate the deal in secret, and then the Congress has to certify it, but they've never voted down a trade promotion authority once it's been given to a president.
[02:58:19.427 --> 02:58:22.489]  Exactly, which was what I had mentioned to him.
[02:58:22.489 --> 02:58:35.415]  And I was stressing to him that why would you guys vote for a trade bill like this when this is one of the things that Donald Trump is running on how we quote-unquote... Hold on, stay there.
[02:58:35.415 --> 02:58:36.355]  I want to hear what he said.
[02:58:36.355 --> 02:58:37.456]  Back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:37.456 --> 02:58:38.896]  Some stations don't carry it, they should.
[02:58:38.896 --> 02:58:40.037]  It's the fourth hour.
[02:58:40.037 --> 02:58:43.799]  It's coming up with myself, Rob Dew and others and Michael Steiner.
[02:58:43.799 --> 02:58:44.519]  Visit GCNlive.com today.

[02:59:42.047 --> 02:59:44.228]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:01.423 --> 03:00:08.053]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.053 --> 03:00:11.037]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:14.449 --> 03:00:30.416]  Raymond from South Carolina was calling up the congressman that's heading up the Benghazi committee and was trying to bring up this big international secret treaty that they've signed on to that the public can't see, that Congress has to go in a locked room to see, and he was going through their responses to him.
[03:00:30.416 --> 03:00:32.757]  Go ahead, Raymond.
[03:00:32.757 --> 03:00:33.358]  Sure thing, Alex.
[03:00:34.557 --> 03:00:50.429]  The main point I wanted to bring up to them was that by voting for a bill like this, the TPP, it's one of the main things that Donald Trump has been running on is our negotiation of trade deals and how quote-unquote we've been losing on every front.
[03:00:50.429 --> 03:00:51.750]  America is losers.
[03:00:51.750 --> 03:00:55.412]  That's one of the things that he says all the time.
[03:00:55.412 --> 03:00:56.393]  And when I brought that up,
[03:00:56.809 --> 03:01:03.795]  They said that they totally agree with me, they don't want it to look like a bad deal, but they voted for it nonetheless.
[03:01:03.795 --> 03:01:18.527]  But the main reason I called, that was a side point, one of the other callers that brought up the TPP, the main reason I called was about a couple of the comments that Dr. Paul made about the goings-on with Russia and the world.
[03:01:21.539 --> 03:01:50.102]  I've actually been trying to take a very big picture look at this, and from what I can tell, given some of my background in the military and some of the steps that we personally have taken, I believe that the whole ordeal in the Ukraine was very telling for what has been going on now, because the media, and especially our government, has been controlling the narrative on Russia for a long time.
[03:01:50.977 --> 03:02:06.408]  And there's no way that they didn't know Russia was going to be forced into action in Syria once Syria melted down because of how pivotal that region is for them economically.
[03:02:06.408 --> 03:02:08.569]  They knew it was just a matter of time.
[03:02:08.569 --> 03:02:15.534]  So instead of having Russia coming in and looking justified, they had to control the narrative beforehand.
[03:02:16.098 --> 03:02:30.064]  And make them already look vilified in the national media, so that they already have... Sure, or they were trying to divert them off Syria onto Ukraine, and they thought Russia would abandon Ukraine, but they failed to predict that outcome.
[03:02:30.064 --> 03:02:32.024]  Thank you for the call, great points.
[03:02:32.024 --> 03:02:40.388]  I'll try to go to Jimmy and Mike and Shane and others, but we've got... or you'll probably be able to talk to Rob Dewey coming up, but... Schneider, you got any comments on the whole situation in Syria?
[03:02:41.624 --> 03:02:42.365]  I sure do.
[03:02:42.365 --> 03:02:44.989]  Why are there still targets for Russia to bomb?
[03:02:44.989 --> 03:02:46.070]  We were told that the U.S.
[03:02:46.070 --> 03:02:56.805]  military had been in there for over a year bombing ISIS, bombing them into oblivion, yet the Russians have come in and they've identified dozens of ISIS targets, command centers,
[03:02:57.365 --> 03:02:59.567]  Uh, weapons depots, etc, etc.
[03:02:59.567 --> 03:03:04.450]  So we've seen video of Russia bombing dozens of targets inside Syria, so could the U.S.
[03:03:04.450 --> 03:03:09.334]  military either not find those targets, or did the Obama administration not want them bombed?
[03:03:09.334 --> 03:03:17.279]  Something smells very, very funny, because Russia's found tons and tons of ISIS targets to bomb, that supposedly we were not able to bomb in over a year.
[03:03:17.279 --> 03:03:19.321]  That, something seems very wrong to me.
[03:03:19.821 --> 03:03:30.053]  Well, the first attacks a month ago, or the key ones, or 23 days ago, hitting all the al-Nusra command bases that are really running ISIS, they cut the head off the snake.
[03:03:30.053 --> 03:03:34.418]  I mean, it was funny that they thought Russia would follow Western propaganda.
[03:03:34.918 --> 03:03:39.241]  That Al-Nusra is a good group and isn't running the show with Al-Qaeda.
[03:03:39.241 --> 03:03:48.286]  So I just love how the Russians chopped Al-Qaeda's head off and then all their little minions ran around like chickens with their heads cut off as well when Papa got taken down.
[03:03:48.286 --> 03:03:49.707]  It was very funny.
[03:03:49.707 --> 03:03:51.308]  Let's go ahead real quick.
[03:03:51.308 --> 03:03:55.651]  Jimmy in Michigan, what's your point on the militia?
[03:03:55.651 --> 03:04:00.514]  Yes, just a couple of... It's more of a correction than a disagreement with you.
[03:04:03.080 --> 03:04:06.703]  You have the facts a little bit wrong about Hattari.
[03:04:06.703 --> 03:04:23.155]  One of the things that really made the Feds jump, and they moved way too fast, is the fact that we had been, Hattari and the Michigan Militia Corps Wolverines, had been working with the County Sheriff here in Washtenaw County.
[03:04:23.155 --> 03:04:30.340]  No, that's what I said on air, was that they were trying to work with local government and be legitimate, so they sent in infiltrators to set up the group.
[03:04:31.943 --> 03:04:35.587]  Well, the infiltrators were already there before that happened.
[03:04:35.587 --> 03:04:36.928]  That was the thing.
[03:04:36.928 --> 03:04:41.713]  And we started getting some really, really good... I tell you what, I want to hear this, but we're out of time for the part I'm hosting.
[03:04:41.713 --> 03:04:42.874]  Thank you, Michael Snyder.
[03:04:42.874 --> 03:04:44.195]  Stay on hold, Jimmy.
[03:04:44.195 --> 03:04:49.680]  I guarantee you, Rob Doo will come to you, Mike, Shane, and others, Mel, that are holding.
[03:04:49.680 --> 03:04:51.602]  The 4th Hour rolls on.
[03:04:51.602 --> 03:04:55.906]  Nightly News Tonight, 7 o'clock Central, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:04:55.906 --> 03:04:56.327]  Stay with us.
[03:04:59.415 --> 03:05:04.518]  It was 30 years ago, in 1985, that Doc and Marty went back another 30 years to 1955.
[03:05:04.518 --> 03:05:08.340]  Then, they went back to the future, to today.
[03:05:08.340 --> 03:05:11.022]  Where we're going, we don't need roads.
[03:05:12.634 --> 03:05:16.136]  Well, there's no flying cars, and it isn't the roads they say we don't need.
[03:05:16.136 --> 03:05:19.078]  They tell us where we're going, there won't be any drivers.
[03:05:19.078 --> 03:05:26.343]  And there's no hoverboards or self-lacing shoes, but at least we're not plagued with fax machines.
[03:05:26.343 --> 03:05:31.987]  You may just need a lightning strike for power, since Obama and the EPA are trying to shut down most of the power plants.
[03:05:34.781 --> 03:05:39.145]  But the movie's future resembles the present in a couple of very strange ways.
[03:05:39.145 --> 03:05:50.815]  The Cubs got in the World Series, and even stranger... Discover how, in 1979, Biff successfully lobbied to legalize gambling and turned Hill Valley's dilapidated courthouse into a beautiful casino hotel.
[03:05:50.815 --> 03:05:52.877]  I just want to say one thing.
[03:05:52.877 --> 03:05:54.258]  God bless America.
[03:05:54.258 --> 03:05:55.960]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.

[03:06:55.535 --> 03:06:58.756]  Hey, how you doing, Al?
[03:06:58.756 --> 03:06:59.836]  Good, brother.
[03:06:59.836 --> 03:07:01.656]  Just recently started using your products.
[03:07:01.656 --> 03:07:03.497]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[03:07:03.497 --> 03:07:07.358]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives.
[03:07:07.478 --> 03:07:10.140]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation.
[03:07:10.140 --> 03:07:12.562]  But doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[03:07:12.562 --> 03:07:20.847]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[03:07:20.847 --> 03:07:23.990]  We do the Super Male and the Super Female Vitality.
[03:07:23.990 --> 03:07:25.531]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[03:07:25.531 --> 03:07:28.573]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[03:07:28.573 --> 03:07:30.234]  Saving a ton of money there.
[03:07:30.234 --> 03:07:33.336]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested
[03:07:33.336 --> 03:07:33.896]  We're good.
[03:08:00.120 --> 03:08:05.527]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:05.527 --> 03:08:07.811]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:21.059 --> 03:08:21.980]  We are back!
[03:08:21.980 --> 03:08:24.042]  It's the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:08:24.042 --> 03:08:26.805]  I'm your host, Rob Dew, sitting in.
[03:08:26.805 --> 03:08:28.987]  And we have a variety of hosts here on the fourth hour.
[03:08:28.987 --> 03:08:31.069]  It's kind of a hodgepodge of what's going on.
[03:08:31.069 --> 03:08:32.711]  Recapping some news that happened today.
[03:08:32.711 --> 03:08:36.774]  And we had an especially news-making event today with Ron Paul.
[03:08:36.774 --> 03:08:42.480]  Every time he shows up on the show, this time via beautiful video Skype from his studios down near Houston.
[03:08:42.480 --> 03:08:45.183]  I believe in Victoria, Texas is where he's located.
[03:08:45.843 --> 03:08:48.424]  And he got into a variety of topics.
[03:08:48.424 --> 03:08:51.465]  We're putting those up on InfoWars right now.
[03:08:51.465 --> 03:09:03.248]  But one I wanted to get specifically to, and I'm also going to go to your calls here, we're going to finish up with Jimmy, but I want to play with what Dr. Paul, this is what he had to say about the Russian-Syrian situation.
[03:09:03.248 --> 03:09:04.808]  So let's go to that clip right now.
[03:09:05.703 --> 03:09:23.870]  Looking at this election, looking at Rand Paul, looking at how he's really the only candidate that isn't for expanding the war in Syria, what is your view on the Russian entry into Syria?
[03:09:23.870 --> 03:09:26.651]  Well, I look at it in a practical way.
[03:09:26.651 --> 03:09:27.131]  I look first
[03:09:27.915 --> 03:09:33.656]  That what our policy should be, we shouldn't have been in there and we should leave, and then that leaves it up to the neighborhood to take care of it.
[03:09:33.656 --> 03:09:50.221]  We're in 152 countries, and if we're saying, okay, we gotta watch out, we gotta be terrified, and we have to do anything we can to stop the Russians exerting their program, which is next to their border, whether it's Ukraine or whether it's Syria.
[03:09:51.961 --> 03:09:55.743]  They have a treaty with one country, with one base.
[03:09:55.743 --> 03:09:58.505]  And I think they have one aircraft carrier.
[03:09:58.505 --> 03:10:00.346]  So they want to keep that base.
[03:10:00.346 --> 03:10:02.867]  So I would say that's more their business.
[03:10:02.867 --> 03:10:08.070]  And I sort of get in charge out of the fact that Kerry says, oh, those Russians are not too smart.
[03:10:08.070 --> 03:10:10.372]  They're going to get bogged down in Syria.
[03:10:10.372 --> 03:10:11.292]  Well, maybe so.
[03:10:11.292 --> 03:10:13.453]  If they do, maybe it'll be like Afghanistan.
[03:10:13.453 --> 03:10:16.555]  But why should we blive ourselves down?
[03:10:16.555 --> 03:10:19.697]  How could it be any worse than what we're doing to ourselves?
[03:10:20.237 --> 03:10:30.565]  So I would let Russia and the Turks and the Kurds and these other people be involved and take care of it.
[03:10:30.565 --> 03:10:38.311]  And maybe if we withdrew some of our financial and military support over there, maybe Saudi Arabia wouldn't be so aggressive.
[03:10:38.311 --> 03:10:43.475]  Maybe they'd have to deal with Yemen all by themselves.
[03:10:43.475 --> 03:10:44.376]  That whole area.
[03:10:44.696 --> 03:10:50.340]  Would become more peaceful and they would work out things much more peacefully.
[03:10:50.340 --> 03:11:06.893]  But I don't think that if we compare Russia exerting themselves to protect one naval base outside their country compared to us being in 152 countries and assuming the role of total policeman of the world, no comparison.
[03:11:11.337 --> 03:11:21.040]  And that was Ron Paul with a basic, common sense, non-interventionist message that he's been known for all through the years he's been in Congress and now even retired.
[03:11:21.040 --> 03:11:23.040]  We don't need to be involved in Russia.
[03:11:23.040 --> 03:11:24.601]  We don't need to be involved with Syria.
[03:11:24.601 --> 03:11:27.702]  You know, why do we have over 150 bases around the world?
[03:11:27.702 --> 03:11:29.002]  How much money is that costing us?
[03:11:29.642 --> 03:11:35.825]  And would that money be better spent here on the United States, maybe on fixing our crumbling infrastructure?
[03:11:35.825 --> 03:11:37.546]  Or providing jobs for people?
[03:11:37.546 --> 03:11:43.148]  Like, you know, the government does love to provide jobs, and in some ways it is good at doing that, in some ways.
[03:11:43.148 --> 03:11:46.470]  But I think maybe we give everybody tax breaks.
[03:11:47.190 --> 03:11:55.172]  Maybe we let businesses decide how they want to spend their money and in hiring people and expanding and creating more jobs here.
[03:11:55.172 --> 03:12:02.154]  That's what you get when you have a lower tax base, but we can never convince people like Bernie Sanders to do that.
[03:12:02.154 --> 03:12:10.497]  Let's go to, I want to let Jimmy finish up and then we have Mike and Shane also on the line and they actually want to talk about what Dr. Ron Paul said earlier today.
[03:12:10.497 --> 03:12:14.398]  But Jimmy, go ahead and recap with everything you said earlier and continue on.
[03:12:16.955 --> 03:12:19.396]  Okay.
[03:12:19.396 --> 03:12:26.398]  What we were doing is running for different offices at the township level.
[03:12:26.398 --> 03:12:29.839]  We had secured some of them.
[03:12:29.839 --> 03:12:33.400]  We became precinct delegates in the Republican Party.
[03:12:33.400 --> 03:12:35.280]  Not that most of us are Republicans.
[03:12:35.280 --> 03:12:38.141]  It's just that it made more logic.
[03:12:38.141 --> 03:12:39.861]  It was more logical to be a Republican.
[03:12:39.861 --> 03:12:41.142]  It's a good place to start.
[03:12:41.142 --> 03:12:42.122]  I agree.
[03:12:42.122 --> 03:12:42.362]  Yeah.
[03:12:43.177 --> 03:12:52.543]  Right, and now that you see what we've done and what we're working toward here in Michigan, I think it was the right move to make.
[03:12:52.543 --> 03:12:55.405]  And we were getting just tons of good press.
[03:12:55.405 --> 03:13:08.294]  We were in the Ann Arbor News, we had been on the local news stations here in Detroit, and they had done some interviews with several of us.
[03:13:08.294 --> 03:13:12.297]  And that, I think, is truly why the feds move faster.
[03:13:13.089 --> 03:13:19.073]  Then they should have moved, because they never really had any evidence on anyone.
[03:13:19.073 --> 03:13:28.780]  The only thing that they had was this Jersey Steve guy, who was the FBI plant that made these bombs, and Dave Stone looked at him.
[03:13:28.780 --> 03:13:31.321]  So somehow he was guilty.
[03:13:31.321 --> 03:13:38.126]  And that was all they had, and they just failed to get a conviction.
[03:13:38.126 --> 03:13:39.507]  As a matter of fact, we even had
[03:13:40.109 --> 03:13:46.110]  The former county sheriff was going to testify on behalf of the Huttari people.
[03:13:46.110 --> 03:14:03.033]  Right, but what happened was they tried that whole case basically in the media, throwing it out there that these guys were terrorists, terrorists, terrorists, but then finally when it comes out that they've all been cleared except this one guy who's got questionable background, not much mention of that, you're right.
[03:14:03.033 --> 03:14:08.594]  Right, and the local papers and the local news media
[03:14:09.235 --> 03:14:12.156]  Did carry the story truthfully.
[03:14:12.156 --> 03:14:18.037]  It was the national media that tried to cover up and backpedal and lie.
[03:14:18.037 --> 03:14:21.938]  They even wanted us to go on Nightline and a couple of other things.
[03:14:21.938 --> 03:14:30.099]  We were approached by ABC and none of it ever panned out because we weren't crazy.
[03:14:30.099 --> 03:14:34.660]  When you're a logical, common-sense, down-to-earth person, they don't want to talk to you.
[03:14:34.660 --> 03:14:37.041]  They want to talk to somebody like David Duke.
[03:14:37.041 --> 03:14:38.381]  They want to talk to a lunatic.
[03:14:41.259 --> 03:14:47.042]  Yeah, I mean, that's clearly what they want, and they weren't getting that from us.
[03:14:47.042 --> 03:14:57.067]  And, you know, this whole investigation started out of... The FBI was actually investigating another militia group, the Southeastern Michigan Volunteer Militia.
[03:14:57.067 --> 03:15:01.989]  They ferreted them out, and then they said, look, you don't want to watch us.
[03:15:01.989 --> 03:15:03.210]  We're not doing anything wrong.
[03:15:03.210 --> 03:15:05.371]  Go look at these majority guys.
[03:15:05.371 --> 03:15:10.073]  So that's how they wound up, and they hired some of their people to infiltrate.
[03:15:13.927 --> 03:15:22.272]  And if you look up, anybody can do a search out there for FBI creates terror plots, FBI's creating the terror threats, FBI's goading people.
[03:15:22.272 --> 03:15:25.814]  They get somebody in a compromising position and say, look, now you work for us.
[03:15:25.814 --> 03:15:27.295]  We want you to go infiltrate.
[03:15:27.295 --> 03:15:34.019]  We want you to find some people who can be duped and say you're going to give them $10,000 if they go blow up a bridge, which I think happened in Ohio.
[03:15:34.019 --> 03:15:35.380]  This guy was getting his tenants.
[03:15:35.860 --> 03:15:42.226]  Who he thought weren't very smart in getting them to admit that they wanted to blow up a bridge, but he was getting all the materials, he was getting everything.
[03:15:42.226 --> 03:15:43.827]  Here's the bomb, just go do it.
[03:15:43.827 --> 03:15:49.092]  These guys wouldn't have done this on their own, but when they're entrapped like that, they do do that, and that happens a lot.
[03:15:49.092 --> 03:15:52.955]  And in Hatari's case, it definitely looks like the same thing was going on.
[03:15:52.955 --> 03:15:54.136]  Thanks for your call, Jimmy.
[03:15:54.136 --> 03:15:56.518]  Mike in Tennessee, what did you have to talk about?
[03:15:56.518 --> 03:15:59.141]  I know Dr. Paul did talk about gun control today.
[03:15:59.141 --> 03:16:00.542]  What was your perspective on that?
[03:16:01.533 --> 03:16:10.263]  Well, what I was referring to is earlier, Alex asked Dr. Paul about people revolting, and Dr. Paul said the problem is that they have all the guns.
[03:16:10.263 --> 03:16:11.725]  And, well, that's true.
[03:16:11.725 --> 03:16:15.369]  However, they don't have people behind those guns.
[03:16:15.369 --> 03:16:20.716]  Remember, when the people address the order-givers, the order-takers have no orders to follow.
[03:16:22.347 --> 03:16:23.247]  That is true.
[03:16:23.247 --> 03:16:29.430]  But what we have to look at is when they create these autonomous drone killing systems, which they are in development right now.
[03:16:29.430 --> 03:16:31.831]  There's a ground vehicle version of that.
[03:16:31.831 --> 03:16:33.932]  We've got plenty of drones up in the skies.
[03:16:33.932 --> 03:16:35.893]  That is where they still can come after us.
[03:16:35.893 --> 03:16:39.114]  But you also have to have pilots and people repairing these things.
[03:16:39.114 --> 03:16:41.575]  And I'm sure there's kill switches on them and everything else.
[03:16:41.575 --> 03:16:42.756]  So you are right about there.
[03:16:43.496 --> 03:16:46.438]  Well, Dr. Paul referred to some younger people and I'm one of those.
[03:16:46.438 --> 03:16:48.479]  My biggest question is where do you start to prepare?
[03:16:48.479 --> 03:16:49.160]  I mean, it might be too late.
[03:17:14.065 --> 03:17:18.086]  Or just irrelevant at this point, but where do you start?
[03:17:18.086 --> 03:17:19.186]  It's never too late.
[03:17:19.186 --> 03:17:36.831]  You have to find, I think you find a group of like-minded people, and you decide, maybe you pull your resources together, maybe look at a piece of land out of town, get some storable food, get a good water filter system that doesn't need electricity, or water pumps, and get books, because when the internet goes down, you're not going to have
[03:17:38.591 --> 03:17:43.475]  Access to information that you would have had normally through your phone or through your computer.
[03:17:43.475 --> 03:17:47.538]  So get books on survival, get seeds, get ready.
[03:17:47.538 --> 03:17:50.540]  If stuff does go down that you're prepared, get a bug out bag.
[03:17:50.540 --> 03:18:01.548]  I've got friends in California and they all have bug out bags because I think it just came out that they're predicting within the next 30 months of a category or a Richter scale 5.0 earthquake in the LA area.
[03:18:02.128 --> 03:18:16.215]  So you have to be prepared because it may not be martial law in the end of the you know an end of the world type scenario with like an EMP attack but it could be a natural disaster that the feds want to use as a case to come in and take people's guns which is what they did in Katrina.
[03:18:16.215 --> 03:18:22.919]  So it's never too late to prepare and if you start today you're that much more ahead of the game than the people who haven't started at all.
[03:18:22.919 --> 03:18:24.220]  So just know that once
[03:18:25.494 --> 03:18:30.076]  Once the word goes out that stuff's collapsing, you got about two days of food in the grocery store.
[03:18:30.076 --> 03:18:31.737]  So you need to prepare accordingly.
[03:18:31.737 --> 03:18:36.419]  There's plenty of resources out there, you know, for people out there like yourself.
[03:18:36.419 --> 03:18:37.239]  So it's never too late.
[03:18:37.239 --> 03:18:39.040]  And the fact that you're young is good.
[03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:40.120]  It means you got a lot of energy.
[03:18:40.120 --> 03:18:44.202]  So hopefully you have time to put all that preparedness in.
[03:18:44.202 --> 03:18:50.705]  Guys, if you could pull up the computer in here, somebody put together this interesting little Bill O'Reilly versus Alex Jones.
[03:18:50.705 --> 03:18:53.266]  I guess they, and they got Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs in there.
[03:18:53.986 --> 03:18:56.508]  Uh, really interesting what you can do with computers now.
[03:18:56.508 --> 03:19:06.614]  I guess he built this into a game, put the skins together, put the t-shirts, and uh, so he's created a little wrestling match between Bill O'Reilly and Alex Jones.
[03:19:06.614 --> 03:19:14.500]  And uh, we've got, we've got Bill O'Reilly and his Fox Minions, and there's I guess Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson are also featured in this video.
[03:19:15.160 --> 03:19:19.385]  But pretty interesting what you can do nowadays, and people are holding up 9-11 truth signs.
[03:19:19.385 --> 03:19:21.507]  I mean, that's a great way to wake people up.
[03:19:21.507 --> 03:19:23.109]  Maybe somebody goes, man, what's 9-11 truth?
[03:19:23.109 --> 03:19:25.692]  And they search it, and then they start telling their friends about it.
[03:19:26.710 --> 03:19:27.791]  And that's how this stuff happens.
[03:19:27.791 --> 03:19:31.393]  So this is just one little way to, you know, fight the InfoWars.
[03:19:31.393 --> 03:19:32.574]  I'm not sure who made this.
[03:19:32.574 --> 03:19:36.856]  Let's just see where they put it on as wrestling with politics.
[03:19:36.856 --> 03:19:37.717]  There it is.
[03:19:37.717 --> 03:19:38.918]  So we'll be back with more.
[03:19:38.918 --> 03:19:44.721]  I'm going to have Leanne McAdoo in here talking about her latest foray into the cleansing world.
[03:19:44.721 --> 03:19:46.062]  She started her first day of cleanse.
[03:19:46.062 --> 03:19:48.524]  We're going to see what she's up to with that.
[03:19:48.524 --> 03:19:51.926]  And Jakari Jackson will be in at the end of the show previewing today's nightly news.
[03:19:51.926 --> 03:19:54.768]  So it's the 4,000th Rob Dew of OverdriveInfoWars.com.
[03:19:58.976 --> 03:20:03.358]  Do you lay awake at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[03:20:03.358 --> 03:20:07.419]  Do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[03:20:07.419 --> 03:20:12.902]  How can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens that are beginning to emerge in the world today?
[03:20:12.902 --> 03:20:16.463]  Give yourself peace of mind with Supernatural Silver.
[03:20:16.463 --> 03:20:23.986]  Supernatural Silver is turning heads around the world as a new weapon in the fight against bacteria, viruses, and fungus.

[03:20:59.130 --> 03:21:04.892]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[03:21:04.892 --> 03:21:19.337]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[03:21:19.597 --> 03:21:27.583]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[03:21:27.583 --> 03:21:33.068]  And when you visit Infowarslife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[03:21:33.068 --> 03:21:36.730]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[03:21:36.730 --> 03:21:40.874]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[03:21:40.874 --> 03:21:44.737]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[03:21:45.177 --> 03:21:49.300]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.

[03:22:21.919 --> 03:22:25.780]  We'll never use outside packers or use relabeled food from another company.

[03:23:01.226 --> 03:23:05.867]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages, or war.
[03:23:05.867 --> 03:23:10.148]  Each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared.
[03:23:10.148 --> 03:23:11.528]  We typically do the same thing.
[03:23:11.528 --> 03:23:14.548]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water.
[03:23:14.548 --> 03:23:16.769]  But have you considered heat storage?
[03:23:16.769 --> 03:23:18.969]  I'm talking about staying warm in the cold.
[03:23:18.969 --> 03:23:21.269]  Here are some things for you to consider.
[03:23:21.269 --> 03:23:22.890]  How will I keep my family warm?
[03:23:22.890 --> 03:23:25.370]  The standard answers are firewood, coal, or propane.
[03:23:25.370 --> 03:23:29.431]  But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move, is you can't take it with you.
[03:23:30.271 --> 03:23:31.392]  Another concern?
[03:23:31.392 --> 03:23:35.376]  There may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke, like in times of war.
[03:23:35.376 --> 03:23:37.958]  There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel.
[03:23:37.958 --> 03:23:41.942]  The answers may be simpler and less costly than you think.
[03:23:41.942 --> 03:23:44.744]  For these answers, go to FortressClothing.com.
[03:23:44.744 --> 03:23:49.388]  Again, FortressClothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma.
[03:23:49.388 --> 03:23:51.390]  Don't get stuck in the cold.
[03:23:51.390 --> 03:23:53.052]  FortressClothing.com.
[03:23:53.052 --> 03:23:54.393]  You'll never be cold again.
[03:24:13.206 --> 03:24:17.572]  Alright, if you're watching scenes, there's some Info Wars off the grid and signs.
[03:24:17.572 --> 03:24:18.413]  I love it.
[03:24:18.413 --> 03:24:19.975]  Whoever put this together did a great job.
[03:24:19.975 --> 03:24:23.019]  There's Sha'Carri Jackson giving it to a Fox News commentator.
[03:24:24.731 --> 03:24:29.015]  You know, it's good to do this in the computer realm.
[03:24:29.015 --> 03:24:34.159]  Because we don't want to have violence in real life unless it comes to defending yourself and whatnot.
[03:24:34.159 --> 03:24:39.323]  But I think it's just great the way technology has come that you can really personalize and make videos like this.
[03:24:39.323 --> 03:24:43.046]  But where is Leanne McAdoo in this?
[03:24:43.046 --> 03:24:45.088]  Yeah, you should be a manager like they used to have.
[03:24:45.088 --> 03:24:48.030]  Don't make me the ring girl.
[03:24:48.030 --> 03:24:48.691]  Wonder Woman.
[03:24:50.187 --> 03:24:52.328]  And Leah McAdoo is joining me in studio now.
[03:24:52.328 --> 03:25:00.333]  By the way, it turns out the Texas clock kid, Fox News was reporting this, speaking of Fox News, Ahmed is to move with his family to Qatar.
[03:25:00.333 --> 03:25:05.597]  I tweeted out last night, and you can follow me at DewsNews, D-E-W-S-N-E-W-Z.
[03:25:05.597 --> 03:25:08.659]  Do you think TSA will let him board the plane with his clock?
[03:25:08.659 --> 03:25:09.880]  His special clock.
[03:25:09.880 --> 03:25:11.901]  Do you think that they're going to do that?
[03:25:11.901 --> 03:25:14.182]  You guys can get a shot of that tweet if you want right here on my phone.
[03:25:15.296 --> 03:25:17.719]  But do you think they're going to say, oh, that's fine.
[03:25:17.719 --> 03:25:19.241]  He's just a smart kid.
[03:25:19.241 --> 03:25:20.902]  We're going to let him board the plane with his clock.
[03:25:20.902 --> 03:25:22.584]  It's not a suspicious package.
[03:25:22.584 --> 03:25:24.006]  I mean, ridiculous.
[03:25:24.006 --> 03:25:26.429]  And I'd love to see if he can get his clock on.
[03:25:26.429 --> 03:25:27.069]  There it is right there.
[03:25:27.069 --> 03:25:30.053]  Do you think TSA will let him board the plane with his clock?
[03:25:31.337 --> 03:25:31.937]  I don't know.
[03:25:31.937 --> 03:25:35.779]  I don't think... Well, didn't he just meet with... He gave the president a hug.
[03:25:35.779 --> 03:25:37.880]  A different president there.
[03:25:37.880 --> 03:25:39.001]  Not Syria.
[03:25:39.001 --> 03:25:43.563]  I can't recall, but he's basically known as the butcher because he's slaughtering all of his citizens.
[03:25:43.563 --> 03:25:44.004]  Really?
[03:25:44.004 --> 03:25:47.105]  Yeah, that was last weekend, right before he met with our president.
[03:25:47.105 --> 03:25:47.946]  That might be Liam Hackett.
[03:25:47.946 --> 03:25:49.126]  He's just making the rounds.
[03:25:49.126 --> 03:25:51.347]  Is that... I don't know.
[03:25:51.347 --> 03:25:51.788]  It could be.
[03:25:53.106 --> 03:25:54.728]  There it is!
[03:25:54.728 --> 03:25:56.249]  Oh my gosh, Leanne Mack.
[03:25:56.249 --> 03:25:57.910]  We're watching this live.
[03:25:57.910 --> 03:26:00.293]  Are you going to take on Dana Perino, maybe?
[03:26:00.293 --> 03:26:02.014]  She looks like a dude.
[03:26:02.014 --> 03:26:02.995]  Wow.
[03:26:02.995 --> 03:26:04.036]  You're really getting it handed to you there.
[03:26:04.036 --> 03:26:06.598]  This is the Ronda Rousey.
[03:26:06.598 --> 03:26:08.360]  Wow, ground and pound.
[03:26:08.360 --> 03:26:10.662]  That's Infowars vs Fox News Smackdown.
[03:26:10.662 --> 03:26:12.664]  You can find it all on Infowars.com.
[03:26:12.664 --> 03:26:13.124]  Now, Leanne.
[03:26:14.474 --> 03:26:18.461]  Last night, you started your cleanse with your friend.
[03:26:18.461 --> 03:26:20.886]  Well, technically today is day one.
[03:26:20.886 --> 03:26:24.432]  Yes, we prepped everything last night to just get it all ready.
[03:26:24.432 --> 03:26:26.215]  The ultimate six-day cleanse, right?
[03:26:27.032 --> 03:26:28.233]  It is.
[03:26:28.233 --> 03:26:29.893]  So far, you know, it's been very easy.
[03:26:29.893 --> 03:26:35.555]  I think I got, it might be a little easier for me because I'm already pretty much a vegetarian, so I'm... Oh, and you're superior to all of us.
[03:26:35.555 --> 03:26:37.756]  I'm used to eating nothing but salads all day.
[03:26:37.756 --> 03:26:38.396]  Yeah.
[03:26:38.396 --> 03:26:43.958]  There's, there's a, y'all that shot a video last night, we're going to premiere tonight about, about you guys talking about it, like how easy it is.
[03:26:43.958 --> 03:26:48.620]  You went to the store for about an hour, got all the ingredients that you need and, uh,
[03:26:48.820 --> 03:26:49.961]  And that was only like $60.
[03:26:49.961 --> 03:26:51.983]  That's not bad.
[03:26:51.983 --> 03:26:58.669]  And that's including buying a $10 thing of olive oil and bay leaves, which is why those things are so expensive.
[03:26:58.669 --> 03:27:00.150]  I always pick those out of my food.
[03:27:00.150 --> 03:27:01.151]  You're supposed to eat those?
[03:27:01.151 --> 03:27:02.412]  Well, it's for the soup.
[03:27:02.412 --> 03:27:03.893]  So it flavors the soup.
[03:27:03.893 --> 03:27:07.676]  So that's breakfast, lunch, and dinner for about four days.
[03:27:07.676 --> 03:27:08.557]  So it was like $40.
[03:27:08.557 --> 03:27:11.360]  And that's distilled water that you guys were getting, right?
[03:27:11.360 --> 03:27:11.620]  Correct.
[03:27:12.020 --> 03:27:12.580]  Yes.
[03:27:12.580 --> 03:27:14.081]  Looks like some small watermelons.
[03:27:14.081 --> 03:27:15.761]  Very racist with the watermelons.
[03:27:15.761 --> 03:27:16.242]  I know.
[03:27:16.242 --> 03:27:17.122]  Super racist.
[03:27:17.122 --> 03:27:20.243]  You got your Bragg's apple cider vinegar, which is really good.
[03:27:20.243 --> 03:27:21.864]  How to do it?
[03:27:21.864 --> 03:27:23.684]  Well, we don't have it here, but how to do it?
[03:27:23.684 --> 03:27:25.065]  I shoot that stuff straight.
[03:27:25.065 --> 03:27:25.845]  Oh my gosh.
[03:27:25.845 --> 03:27:26.645]  I don't know how you do it.
[03:27:26.645 --> 03:27:30.467]  There's actually, we have a clip of me doing the taste test with the mixture.
[03:27:30.467 --> 03:27:31.627]  Yes.
[03:27:31.627 --> 03:27:32.127]  This morning.
[03:27:32.127 --> 03:27:33.708]  If you guys have that, let's go and roll it.
[03:27:33.708 --> 03:27:34.568]  Here she is.
[03:27:34.568 --> 03:27:35.849]  Give us some audio on this.
[03:27:35.849 --> 03:27:36.389]  Here she goes.
[03:27:38.419 --> 03:27:41.962]  She's drinking the apple cider vinegar mixture with a little lemon.
[03:27:41.962 --> 03:27:42.983]  A little lemon that helps.
[03:27:42.983 --> 03:27:50.770]  His face is priceless.
[03:27:50.770 --> 03:27:51.951]  And the cat hiss.
[03:27:51.951 --> 03:27:52.391]  Okay.
[03:27:52.391 --> 03:27:52.812]  Wow.
[03:27:52.812 --> 03:27:54.433]  It wasn't that bad.
[03:27:54.433 --> 03:27:55.394]  I put a lemon in mine.
[03:27:56.400 --> 03:27:57.180]  Wasn't that bad.
[03:27:57.180 --> 03:27:58.641]  It really was not that bad.
[03:27:58.641 --> 03:28:02.003]  The thing that was just weird about it was because you kind of... It's a shock to your system.
[03:28:02.003 --> 03:28:06.165]  You get that vinegar kind of in your nasal passages a little bit.
[03:28:06.165 --> 03:28:10.127]  And I have a death fear of pickles, but I drink apple cider vinegar.
[03:28:10.127 --> 03:28:10.508]  What?
[03:28:10.508 --> 03:28:11.888]  Yeah, don't eat pickles though.
[03:28:11.888 --> 03:28:13.409]  Do not, do not approach me.
[03:28:13.409 --> 03:28:14.150]  No, don't pitch.
[03:28:14.150 --> 03:28:14.990]  Well, maybe.
[03:28:14.990 --> 03:28:16.851]  I like some peppers or whatnot.
[03:28:16.851 --> 03:28:18.512]  It's very good for your digestive tract.
[03:28:18.672 --> 03:28:20.754]  Well, that's why I drink the vinegar, the apple cider vinegar.
[03:28:20.754 --> 03:28:25.278]  So you've got the three InfoWarsLife products that you're using right now for this.
[03:28:25.278 --> 03:28:26.058]  Right.
[03:28:26.058 --> 03:28:34.906]  Now the typical cleanse that's there, that you're given all the directions for at InfoWarsLife.com is for the liver shield and the oxy powder.
[03:28:34.906 --> 03:28:43.513]  But I'm also taking the deep cleanse as well because I figure, you know, if I'm going to go for it, I might as well go all the way, go deep, you know, go big or go home.
[03:28:44.694 --> 03:28:52.397]  I'm just taking the dropper fulls of this and then this is what, well not that, this is in the apple cider vinegar mixture and everything so.
[03:28:52.397 --> 03:28:53.077]  Right.
[03:28:53.077 --> 03:28:54.698]  It's been pretty simple so far.
[03:28:54.698 --> 03:28:56.538]  I have tons of energy and it's only day one.
[03:28:56.538 --> 03:28:57.699]  Well that's good.
[03:28:57.699 --> 03:29:04.261]  I think you're going to go through a detox at some point so you might not be as glowing as you are now in a few days but you're doing it over the weekend.
[03:29:04.261 --> 03:29:05.942]  It's a six day cleanse.
[03:29:05.942 --> 03:29:06.662]  Anybody can do it.
[03:29:06.662 --> 03:29:12.384]  I have not done it yet but I have used Oxy Powder many times and it's an amazing product with the results you get from it.
[03:29:12.384 --> 03:29:14.445]  Yeah, Emmy lost 16 pounds last time she did it.
[03:29:14.465 --> 03:29:15.946]  The first time I did it, I lost 12.
[03:29:15.946 --> 03:29:16.787]  In five days?
[03:29:16.787 --> 03:29:17.188]  Yeah.
[03:29:17.188 --> 03:29:20.591]  And that's pretty amazing considering that usually men lose weight faster.
[03:29:20.591 --> 03:29:21.052]  Right.
[03:29:21.052 --> 03:29:24.495]  So you guys are going to be posting a video diary, hashtagging stuff.
[03:29:24.495 --> 03:29:25.776]  Check out your Twitter feed.
[03:29:25.776 --> 03:29:28.859]  We'll be posting stuff on the Alex Jones Channel on InfoWars.
[03:29:28.859 --> 03:29:34.505]  And hopefully this will encourage other people to cleanse their body, to get ready, or you know, whatever's coming down the pipe.
[03:29:34.725 --> 03:29:36.026]  Maybe you just want a healthier lifestyle.
[03:29:36.026 --> 03:29:40.648]  Maybe you just want to live longer and see your grandkids and your kids, maybe your great-grandkids.
[03:29:40.648 --> 03:29:42.569]  You know, it's coming.
[03:29:42.569 --> 03:29:44.089]  So we're going to have actually a tech report.
[03:29:44.089 --> 03:29:46.950]  We're going to play a bit of it that you did later on in the hour.
[03:29:46.950 --> 03:29:47.451]  So stay tuned.
[03:29:47.451 --> 03:29:48.331]  It's the 4th hour.
[03:29:58.849 --> 03:29:59.409]  A U.S.
[03:29:59.409 --> 03:30:05.273]  high school student has reportedly hacked the personal AOL account of CIA Director John Brennan.
[03:30:05.273 --> 03:30:17.622]  According to the hacker, everything from a 47-page application for top-secret security clearance to details of the agency's harsh interrogation techniques were discovered in the breach, notes the New York Post.
[03:30:17.622 --> 03:30:19.143]  The October 12 intrusion
[03:30:19.383 --> 03:30:28.626]  began after the hacker was able to trick workers at Verizon into providing Brennan's personal information and duping AOL into resetting his password.
[03:30:28.626 --> 03:30:37.468]  Law enforcement sources speaking with the Post were shocked at the hacker's actions, noting that the agency would undoubtedly make an example of the hackers if possible.
[03:30:37.728 --> 03:30:45.550]  We've previously seen the CIA brag about how they're collecting your information, going as far as saying they can spy on you through your dishwasher.
[03:30:45.550 --> 03:30:53.013]  All manner of alphabet agencies can gather your information without a warrant, but if you take it from them, they have a problem with that.
[03:30:53.013 --> 03:30:56.554]  You can find more reports on InfoWars.com.
[03:30:58.533 --> 03:31:02.035]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:02.035 --> 03:31:10.301]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:31:10.301 --> 03:31:15.725]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:31:15.725 --> 03:31:18.247]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[03:31:18.247 --> 03:31:20.348]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[03:31:20.348 --> 03:31:24.531]  Secure your DNA force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:31:28.382 --> 03:31:29.503]  BrainForce is here.
[03:31:29.503 --> 03:31:31.724]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:31:31.724 --> 03:31:36.707]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:31:36.707 --> 03:31:40.009]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:31:40.009 --> 03:31:43.491]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:31:43.491 --> 03:31:45.472]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:31:45.472 --> 03:31:47.574]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:31:47.574 --> 03:31:49.575]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:31:49.575 --> 03:31:55.158]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:31:58.340 --> 03:32:01.843]  Infowarslife.com, oil of oregano formulation.
[03:32:01.843 --> 03:32:07.448]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.
[03:32:07.448 --> 03:32:15.796]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[03:32:15.796 --> 03:32:21.461]  Sourced from top leading manufacturers to ensure a concentrated level of bioactive ingredients.
[03:32:21.901 --> 03:32:31.025]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy-to-use capsules, you will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[03:32:31.025 --> 03:32:37.247]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[03:32:37.247 --> 03:32:44.010]  Wild-crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[03:32:44.010 --> 03:32:49.032]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[03:32:49.352 --> 03:32:51.073]  You know, Australia's a good example.
[03:32:51.073 --> 03:32:52.353]  Canada's a good example.
[03:32:52.353 --> 03:32:53.153]  The UK is a good example.
[03:32:53.153 --> 03:32:53.393]  Why?
[03:32:53.393 --> 03:32:55.334]  Because each of them had mass killings.
[03:32:55.334 --> 03:32:57.655]  Somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.
[03:33:13.980 --> 03:33:17.183]  Well, this is something we should politicize.
[03:33:17.183 --> 03:33:18.244]  I'm not going to carry a gun.
[03:33:18.244 --> 03:33:19.946]  I don't want to be involved in a gunfight.
[03:33:19.946 --> 03:33:32.519]  If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[03:33:38.024 --> 03:33:39.586]  Go ahead.
[03:33:39.586 --> 03:33:41.087]  Make my day.
[03:33:41.087 --> 03:33:45.432]  The notion that gun laws don't work is not borne out by the evidence.
[03:33:45.432 --> 03:33:51.278]  He says that the Chicago police had a plan over this bloody 4th of July weekend.
[03:33:51.278 --> 03:34:00.107]  Nonetheless, as you indicated, Corey, there was a count of casualties that could have been from Afghanistan or Iraq.
[03:34:00.107 --> 03:34:00.568]  We'll make it.
[03:34:01.824 --> 03:34:05.126]  Harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns.
[03:34:05.126 --> 03:34:12.649]  In many cases the offenders, felons, some out on parole, some out on bond.
[03:34:12.649 --> 03:34:19.712]  We have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their families from violence.
[03:34:19.712 --> 03:34:23.234]  There are people at high levels in this government who have
[03:34:24.275 --> 03:34:25.978]  Bodyguards.
[03:34:25.978 --> 03:34:28.242]  24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[03:34:28.242 --> 03:34:30.626]  The average American does not have that.
[03:34:30.626 --> 03:34:34.493]  Mayor Bloomberg, why can you defend yourself but not...
[03:34:35.356 --> 03:34:36.477]  The majority of Americans.
[03:34:36.477 --> 03:34:39.000]  I mean, look at the team of security you got!
[03:34:39.000 --> 03:34:41.822]  Every day, every school, at every level.
[03:34:41.822 --> 03:34:47.628]  One thing that I think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this.
[03:34:47.628 --> 03:34:54.595]  And we need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[03:34:54.975 --> 03:34:58.918]  Was this the weapon of choice for a new kind of terrorist?
[03:34:58.918 --> 03:35:06.924]  When a five-year-old girl said she and a classmate should shoot each other with bubbles, the school called it a terrorist threat.
[03:35:06.924 --> 03:35:10.927]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[03:35:10.927 --> 03:35:14.810]  You know, the right to bear arms is because that's the last form of defense against tyranny.
[03:35:14.810 --> 03:35:17.392]  Lay down your arms, you damn rebels!
[03:35:19.096 --> 03:35:23.220]  But we don't need the ability to arm ourselves against the army or the police.
[03:35:23.220 --> 03:35:24.721]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[03:35:24.721 --> 03:35:26.122]  would you see that happening?
[03:35:26.122 --> 03:35:30.646]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[03:35:30.646 --> 03:35:33.709]  The clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[03:35:33.709 --> 03:35:33.789]  Us.
[03:35:33.789 --> 03:35:41.776]  Just saying, we're not turning our guns in and we're not running and we're not knocking down.
[03:35:41.776 --> 03:35:43.818]  If you want us, come and take us!
[03:35:44.519 --> 03:35:49.534]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:35:49.534 --> 03:35:50.999]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:36:02.501 --> 03:36:11.906]  Boy, seeing a video like that makes me proud to be an American and proud to be working at InfoWars and proud to be talking about the issues that stuff like the mainstream media won't touch.
[03:36:11.906 --> 03:36:18.910]  I was noticing at the end of this SmackDown video, I hadn't even seen this until I sat in here today, but they show, Bill, there it is right there.
[03:36:18.910 --> 03:36:21.571]  There's the dinosaur media being carted off.
[03:36:21.571 --> 03:36:23.432]  They're dying dead.
[03:36:23.432 --> 03:36:25.193]  The alternative media is replacing them.
[03:36:25.193 --> 03:36:28.175]  The alternative media is moving to TV, which is one of the things we're doing.
[03:36:28.175 --> 03:36:31.817]  We're moving to TV, too, because we want to spread the message of liberty to everybody.
[03:36:31.957 --> 03:36:49.567]  We think everybody, even if you don't have an internet connection, should be able to catch this message and help spread it because if we don't, the socialists will take over and they will take everything you have and redistribute it while they live in their far-off bubble Elysium-type cities and we all just, you know, live in hell on earth.
[03:36:49.567 --> 03:36:58.953]  Now, today is October 21st, 2015 and if you watched Back to the Future, I think it was Part 2, Marty goes
[03:36:59.833 --> 03:37:02.515]  From the present back into the future.
[03:37:02.515 --> 03:37:04.257]  And it's October 21st, 2015.
[03:37:04.257 --> 03:37:10.323]  And by that time, Biff Tannen had taken over.
[03:37:10.323 --> 03:37:14.066]  And of course, we know he's sort of like an allegory to Trump.
[03:37:14.066 --> 03:37:15.287]  And this came out of the Daily Beast.
[03:37:15.287 --> 03:37:21.292]  There's a very specific analogue between Biff Tannen, the bully and bad guy, in almost every timeline of Back to the Future Part 2.
[03:37:21.292 --> 03:37:24.716]  And a certain political figure who's rather popular in the United States right now.
[03:37:25.256 --> 03:37:26.696]  He's been handed the keys to the fortune.
[03:37:26.696 --> 03:37:30.017]  He's unrepentant that he's used that fortune exclusively for himself.
[03:37:30.017 --> 03:37:33.078]  He even become a public advocate for plastic surgery on women.
[03:37:33.078 --> 03:37:37.119]  Well, Trump has said a lot of other things that they don't mention in this article, funny enough.
[03:37:37.119 --> 03:37:42.241]  But yeah, I believe there is probably they were looking at the future and saying, well, maybe we will have President Trump one day.
[03:37:42.241 --> 03:37:46.882]  I believe there was a Rage Against the Machine video show people holding signs for President
[03:37:47.282 --> 03:37:47.582]  Trump.
[03:37:47.582 --> 03:37:50.143]  So who knows if we will see that being a reality.
[03:37:50.143 --> 03:37:54.324]  Doesn't look like the Cubs are going to make it to the World Series, even though they're very close.
[03:37:54.324 --> 03:37:56.685]  But it looks like the Mets are going to beat them.
[03:37:56.685 --> 03:37:57.845]  That was another prediction.
[03:37:57.845 --> 03:37:58.686]  And back to the future.
[03:37:58.686 --> 03:38:04.668]  Here's a one-minute presentation that we've been playing today on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:38:04.668 --> 03:38:05.488]  This is the fourth hour.
[03:38:05.488 --> 03:38:07.289]  But here we actually put some video to it.
[03:38:07.289 --> 03:38:08.369]  So this is from David Knight.
[03:38:09.415 --> 03:38:14.519]  It was 30 years ago, in 1985, that Doc and Marty went back another 30 years, to 1955.
[03:38:14.519 --> 03:38:20.123]  Then, they went back to the future, to today.
[03:38:20.123 --> 03:38:21.183]  Hey Doc, we better back up.
[03:38:21.183 --> 03:38:23.125]  We don't have enough road to get up to 88.
[03:38:23.125 --> 03:38:24.225]  Roads?
[03:38:24.225 --> 03:38:26.387]  Where we're going, we don't need roads.
[03:38:27.634 --> 03:38:31.136]  Well, there's no flying cars, and it isn't the roads they say we don't need.
[03:38:31.136 --> 03:38:34.077]  They tell us where we're going, there won't be any drivers.
[03:38:34.077 --> 03:38:41.341]  And there's no hoverboards or self-lacing shoes, but at least we're not plagued with fax machines.
[03:38:41.341 --> 03:38:46.963]  You may just need a lightning strike for power, since Obama and the EPA are trying to shut down most of the power plants.
[03:38:49.881 --> 03:38:54.265]  But the movie's future resembles the present in a couple of very strange ways.
[03:38:54.265 --> 03:39:06.254]  The Cubs got in the World Series, and even stranger... Discover how, in 1979, Biff successfully lobbied to legalize gambling and turned Hill Valley's dilapidated courthouse into a beautiful casino hotel.
[03:39:06.254 --> 03:39:09.937]  I just want to say one thing.
[03:39:09.937 --> 03:39:11.779]  God bless America.
[03:39:11.779 --> 03:39:13.460]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:39:18.704 --> 03:39:19.945]  All right, and there it is.
[03:39:19.945 --> 03:39:22.387]  That was from David Knight.
[03:39:22.387 --> 03:39:24.688]  5 Back to the Future Big Brother Predictions That Came True.
[03:39:24.688 --> 03:39:32.573]  That's a Kit Daniels article that just came out today on, I guess, the 30th anniversary of Back to the Future, which was a big hit back in the 80s.
[03:39:33.914 --> 03:39:38.459]  Movies were made back in the 80s that still ring true today.
[03:39:38.459 --> 03:39:42.502]  Getting back to Russia, we had Ron Paul earlier in the show talking about Russia.
[03:39:42.502 --> 03:39:44.665]  And here's an article from Kurt Nemo.
[03:39:44.665 --> 03:39:46.266]  Guys, roll this video while I read this.
[03:39:46.266 --> 03:39:48.749]  This is actual video that you can see in the article.
[03:39:48.749 --> 03:39:49.669]  It's embedded in there.
[03:39:49.669 --> 03:39:52.853]  Russian video reveals hellish carnage in Syria.
[03:39:53.959 --> 03:40:03.947]  Earlier this week, Russian television released an HD video of a devastated Jabar in the eastern suburb of Damascus, where jihadists and the Syrian government are battling.
[03:40:03.947 --> 03:40:08.851]  The video, allegedly shot by a drone, shows tanks firing amidst hellish wreckage of buildings.
[03:40:09.938 --> 03:40:12.862]  And you can see that on screen right now if you're watching this.
[03:40:12.862 --> 03:40:18.629]  If you're listening to this on radio and you'd like to see some of this, log on to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:40:18.629 --> 03:40:27.160]  You can see, I'm not sure if those are militants or if it's the Russians helping out with the Syrians, but they're launching airstrikes.
[03:40:27.921 --> 03:40:30.083]  That is amazing looking HD video.
[03:40:30.083 --> 03:40:31.204]  I tell ya, right?
[03:40:31.204 --> 03:40:33.125]  That is just amazing.
[03:40:33.125 --> 03:40:34.166]  Bring back the video, guys.
[03:40:34.166 --> 03:40:41.072]  I mean, that is just unbelievable that we're able to get this quality of video from a battle zone.
[03:40:41.072 --> 03:40:46.496]  And we're seeing firsthand what the Russians could do in a month, which we couldn't do in a year.
[03:40:46.496 --> 03:40:47.757]  In fact, it was September 24th.
[03:40:49.699 --> 03:40:50.379]  I don't know.
[03:41:11.388 --> 03:41:11.789]  I don't know.
[03:41:11.789 --> 03:41:12.990]  What were they doing that we weren't?
[03:41:12.990 --> 03:41:14.992]  Maybe we weren't really trying to win that war.
[03:41:14.992 --> 03:41:20.479]  Maybe we were just trying to exacerbate this and have regime change in Syria.
[03:41:20.479 --> 03:41:24.904]  Which, Russia has a treaty with Syria, so they're bound to come protect him.
[03:41:24.904 --> 03:41:25.745]  They have a treaty with him.
[03:41:26.288 --> 03:41:28.809]  You know, here in our country, we were told not to make treaties.
[03:41:28.809 --> 03:41:32.051]  That was one thing George Washington said, don't get mired in treaties.
[03:41:32.051 --> 03:41:39.034]  Because that's, or it was either him or Thomas Jefferson said that, don't get mired in those because that's what leads to more conflict later down the road.
[03:41:39.034 --> 03:41:41.655]  Let the neighborhood clean out their own neighborhood.
[03:41:41.655 --> 03:41:46.517]  Now here is a very creepy video that was put out five months ago, but the Daily Mail is just covering it.
[03:41:47.834 --> 03:41:49.095]  Super, super creepy.
[03:41:49.095 --> 03:41:53.500]  It shows a man in a plague mask, which looks like a giant beak.
[03:41:53.500 --> 03:41:58.145]  And I guess since Halloween, this video has now been making the rounds.
[03:41:58.145 --> 03:42:05.252]  Creepy video of masked figure featuring cryptic threats towards Barack Obama and the White House sets social media in a spin.
[03:42:05.252 --> 03:42:09.136]  The creepy footage, go ahead and roll the footage guys, you can go to the YouTube channel and
[03:42:10.117 --> 03:42:10.957]  Play that.
[03:42:10.957 --> 03:42:12.118]  It's not much to look at.
[03:42:12.118 --> 03:42:19.981]  It kind of reminds me of The Ring or one of those weird videos like after you watch this and suddenly you'll turn into a demon or something.
[03:42:19.981 --> 03:42:25.203]  Figures a medieval style plague doctor mask and a black robe who stares silently as strange noises play in the background.
[03:42:25.203 --> 03:42:27.104]  And these noises are very strange.
[03:42:27.104 --> 03:42:28.164]  You can hear them right there.
[03:42:29.182 --> 03:42:31.504]  And let's not put too much of that out there.
[03:42:31.504 --> 03:42:35.227]  I don't want to trigger anybody if this is a triggering mechanism.
[03:42:35.227 --> 03:42:37.429]  It just made me want to drink my coffee faster.
[03:42:37.429 --> 03:42:41.313]  It contains numerous cryptic messages, which appear to be a sinister threat.
[03:42:41.313 --> 03:42:50.721]  Even the name itself, if you go to the YouTube video and look at the name, it's posted in binary code, which people have translated muerto or muerte, which means death in Spanish.
[03:42:50.721 --> 03:42:54.644]  Dios de los muertos is the day of the dead, which happens the day after Halloween.
[03:42:54.644 --> 03:42:56.225]  There is the binary code.
[03:42:56.946 --> 03:42:58.310]  For that.
[03:42:58.310 --> 03:43:01.397]  And supposedly there's a coded message in there that says kill the president.
[03:43:02.560 --> 03:43:10.342]  But what I find is most interesting is people did spectrograph analysis of the audio and they showed a visual representation of it.
[03:43:10.342 --> 03:43:18.243]  If you scroll down guys you can see that and show it to all the people out there watching at Infowars.com forward slash show or on the live feed on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:43:18.243 --> 03:43:25.425]  There's the first one which they say shows a visual representation which shows a woman being tortured.
[03:43:25.425 --> 03:43:30.306]  Also a DVD was sent out and they did a spectrograph analysis of that and it's got this weird skull with some more
[03:43:30.806 --> 03:43:38.314]  Cryptic letters, so is this just a hoax who knows but if you go to the about on the YouTube page It shows a Russian email address for the account.
[03:43:38.314 --> 03:43:41.357]  I actually sent him an email said are they interesting going public?
[03:43:41.357 --> 03:43:47.924]  Talking about that click on the the name and go to about in there And you can actually see it gives you a Russian email address there.
[03:43:47.924 --> 03:43:50.447]  It is a e tbx at mail.ru so
[03:43:53.115 --> 03:43:58.839]  I sent him an email to contact him, see if they want to talk about it, because it is showing a threat against the President.
[03:43:58.839 --> 03:44:00.059]  Maybe they want to talk about that.
[03:44:00.059 --> 03:44:03.361]  What do they mean about that threat?
[03:44:03.361 --> 03:44:03.942]  Who knows?
[03:44:03.942 --> 03:44:10.125]  But it was interesting, very creepy, and after listening to that audio, I decided to share a little bit with the audience out there.
[03:44:10.125 --> 03:44:18.811]  Now, last night on the InfoWars Nightly News, we premiered Part 2 of a tech report showing the satanic roots between what's going on in this transhumanist technology.
[03:44:18.811 --> 03:44:20.692]  In this Part 2 that we premiered last night,
[03:44:21.880 --> 03:44:28.564]  We looked at, it starts off with how the Unabomber has affected transhumanists like Bill Joy and Ray Kurzweil.
[03:44:28.564 --> 03:44:34.067]  So we're going to play the first five minutes of that, and there is an article which you can go check out and see the rest of it.
[03:44:34.067 --> 03:44:38.470]  I don't know if I have it here on my stack or not, but it's in InfoWars under the SciTech section.
[03:44:38.470 --> 03:44:51.338]  But let's roll that first five minutes of the report showing the connection between the Unabomber, who was a Luddite, lived in technology-free zones out in the cabin in the woods, a literal hermit, and between what the Futurists were talking about.
[03:44:52.856 --> 03:44:57.418]  Robots, cyborgs, and life extension technology.
[03:44:57.418 --> 03:45:00.639]  These terms are familiar to any fan of science fiction.
[03:45:00.639 --> 03:45:06.041]  But now, to some disbelief, these technologies are a science reality.
[03:45:06.041 --> 03:45:21.166]  In part one of this report, we expose some startling connections between 19th and 20th century secret societies, their occult technological experiments, and the emerging automated prison society that is rapidly descending upon us.
[03:45:21.906 --> 03:45:28.049]  In Part 2, we look at a possible motivation for the elite who are financing this emerging new world.
[03:45:28.049 --> 03:45:32.151]  A world whose construction started centuries ago.
[03:45:32.151 --> 03:45:38.795]  In April of 2000, Wired Magazine published an article, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[03:45:38.795 --> 03:45:42.357]  It was written by Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy.
[03:45:42.357 --> 03:45:46.799]  In it, he quotes Ray Kurzweil's book, The Age of Spiritual Machines.
[03:45:48.391 --> 03:45:53.955]  If the elite are ruthless, they may simply decide to exterminate the mass of humanity.
[03:45:53.955 --> 03:46:05.602]  If they are humane, they may use propaganda or other psychological or biological techniques to reduce the birth rate until the mass of humanity becomes extinct, leaving the world to the elite.
[03:46:07.389 --> 03:46:15.897]  What makes this article, quote, even more interesting than one tech pioneer quoting another is the footnote at the bottom of the article.
[03:46:15.897 --> 03:46:22.183]  The passage Kurzweil quotes is from Ted Kaczynski's Unabomber Manifesto, which was published jointly
[03:46:22.643 --> 03:46:29.985]  Under duress by the New York Times and the Washington Post to attempt to bring his campaign of terror to an end.
[03:46:29.985 --> 03:46:38.828]  Why would tech industry leaders go out of their way to quote Kaczynski's Unabomber manifesto in not one but two separate publications?
[03:46:39.508 --> 03:46:53.421]  Well, for those of you who skipped past the 35,000 word manifesto that appeared in both the New York Times and Washington Post on the morning of September 22, 1995, there were some very telling things printed on those pages.
[03:46:54.674 --> 03:47:00.678]  Within his article, Joy himself writes about the quote, I am no apologist for Kaczynski.
[03:47:00.678 --> 03:47:06.181]  His bombs killed three people during a 17-year terror campaign and wounded many others.
[03:47:06.181 --> 03:47:10.764]  Kaczynski's actions were murderous and, in my view, criminally insane.
[03:47:10.764 --> 03:47:15.227]  He is clearly a Luddite, but simply saying this does not dismiss his argument.
[03:47:15.227 --> 03:47:21.451]  As difficult as it is for me to acknowledge, I saw some merit in the reasoning in this single passage.
[03:47:21.451 --> 03:47:23.012]  I felt compelled to confront it.
[03:47:23.892 --> 03:47:28.937]  We at InfoWars share a similar point of view as Joy about the Manifesto.
[03:47:28.937 --> 03:47:32.359]  Like Bill Joy, we do not consider ourselves Luddites.
[03:47:32.359 --> 03:47:35.922]  We often discuss humanity's fate, traveling the stars.
[03:47:35.922 --> 03:47:47.752]  However, we also recognize that some of the words written within Ted Kaczynski's text shouldn't be simply dismissed as writings of a madman, but should be given special attention and careful thought.
[03:47:48.533 --> 03:47:57.675]  Before he was the Unabomber, Kaczynski was considered a child prodigy and he was accepted into Harvard College at the age of 16.
[03:47:57.675 --> 03:48:10.598]  He was among 22 students who were research subjects in what has been described as brutalizing psychological experiments conducted by Henry Murray and rumored to be part of the MKUltra program.
[03:48:11.994 --> 03:48:18.496]  Kaczynski was an eyewitness to some of the most cutting-edge technological experiments of his day.
[03:48:18.496 --> 03:48:25.739]  It seems reasonable that Kurzweil, Joy, and others might be interested to see what insights he reveals in his writings.
[03:48:27.287 --> 03:48:35.909]  Kaczynski's manifesto touches upon a wide range of subjects, including this one in paragraph 157, where he writes, As experimenters have demonstrated, feelings such as hunger, pleasure, anger,
[03:48:48.012 --> 03:48:51.515]  In that last phrase, Kaczynski accurately describes experiments dealing with mind control technology.
[03:48:51.515 --> 03:48:54.617]  These mind control experiments weren't isolated in elite university labs.
[03:48:54.617 --> 03:48:57.339]  They were conducted on a large portion of the population.
[03:49:17.114 --> 03:49:18.795]  Often times within the military.
[03:49:18.795 --> 03:49:28.002]  Secretary of Energy O'Leary during the Clinton administration admitted over half a million Americans were used as experimental guinea pigs for various programs.
[03:49:28.002 --> 03:49:37.549]  Many, many of them military personnel as well as other people that really didn't have the right or who used to speak up for themselves.
[03:49:37.549 --> 03:49:43.793]  Tech journalist Dr. Nick Begich has been covering the subject of mind control technology for more than 25 years.
[03:49:45.254 --> 03:49:54.640]  The idea of using mind control techniques in modern warfare, this is the direction in which we're headed.
[03:49:54.640 --> 03:50:07.948]  That is the direction in which we're headed and if you look at, who is it, the Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh, rumored to be part of a, he thought he said he had a microchip in him and said he was all drugged up.
[03:50:09.417 --> 03:50:10.697]  He disappeared for a while.
[03:50:10.697 --> 03:50:19.639]  I think it was a director who appeared on the Alex Jones Show, actually shot some footage of him inside a tank when he supposedly wasn't in the military at the time.
[03:50:19.639 --> 03:50:22.260]  And the footage is a dead ringer for McVeigh.
[03:50:22.260 --> 03:50:30.262]  Then you look at James Holmes, the killer who was involved in different mind control programs at his university, one of which was run by a DARPA scientist.
[03:50:30.862 --> 03:50:38.646]  Really makes you think how far they've come since they had Kaczynski strapped to a chair with electrodes going into his brain and what happened to him.
[03:50:38.646 --> 03:50:45.269]  He actually, you know, he pushed away from it and then looked at the future and said, you know, in his way, he thought he was doing something.
[03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:46.310]  You know, was he right?
[03:50:46.310 --> 03:50:46.890]  Was he wrong?
[03:50:46.890 --> 03:50:47.270]  Who knows?
[03:50:47.270 --> 03:50:48.511]  Only time will tell.
[03:50:48.511 --> 03:50:50.792]  It's technology, though, and we definitely have to be wary of it.
[03:50:50.792 --> 03:50:53.233]  Experts, thought manipulation technology is already here.
[03:50:53.233 --> 03:50:54.293]  It's on Infowars.com.
[03:50:54.293 --> 03:50:56.915]  Watch the whole video and go back and watch part one.
[03:50:56.915 --> 03:50:58.155]  This is Rob Duke for the 4th Hour.
[03:50:58.155 --> 03:50:59.276]  Jakari Jackson coming up next.
[03:50:59.810 --> 03:51:08.514]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was told I'd be on disability for the rest of my life.
[03:51:08.514 --> 03:51:09.994]  What did I do?
[03:51:09.994 --> 03:51:17.937]  I created ExtendoVite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:17.937 --> 03:51:26.361]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you, so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.

[03:51:32.066 --> 03:51:35.729]  I'm 60 years old now and I still work every day.

[03:51:37.430 --> 03:51:38.632]  That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:38.632 --> 03:51:41.654]  Xtendivite is only $69.95 for a 2-month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:51:58.754 --> 03:52:02.456]  As any regular listener knows, I don't script what I have to say.
[03:52:02.456 --> 03:52:07.077]  I do my research and then I tell it like it is and let the chips fall where they may.
[03:52:07.077 --> 03:52:08.837]  And I'm gonna do that right now.
[03:52:08.837 --> 03:52:10.938]  I have never in my 20 years on air
[03:52:11.398 --> 03:52:11.778]  We're good.
[03:52:30.523 --> 03:52:31.143]  I think so.
[03:52:59.730 --> 03:53:07.733]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day and the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.
[03:53:07.733 --> 03:53:13.216]  They've got hordes of salesmen out there trying to scare you into signing one of their long-term contracts.
[03:53:13.216 --> 03:53:18.118]  You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.
[03:53:18.118 --> 03:53:21.639]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.
[03:53:21.639 --> 03:53:24.060]  But there's a better way to protect your home.

[03:54:11.034 --> 03:54:15.139]  Fresh off his World Wrestling Federation Tour, or his WWE, whatever.
[03:54:15.139 --> 03:54:16.060]  There's Jakari Jackson.
[03:54:16.060 --> 03:54:17.182]  He's getting a bat right now.
[03:54:18.942 --> 03:54:22.403]  Man, but that prompted Ventura to come in.
[03:54:22.403 --> 03:54:24.263]  Yeah, the governor comes in then.
[03:54:24.263 --> 03:54:27.884]  If you have no idea what I'm talking about, we have it posted on InfoWars.com.
[03:54:27.884 --> 03:54:33.725]  Go to SmackDown InfoWars vs Fox News.
[03:54:33.725 --> 03:54:37.586]  I thought that was like a clip from a news show where people were standing up with InfoWars shirts on.
[03:54:37.586 --> 03:54:39.707]  That's how realistic these video games have gotten.
[03:54:39.707 --> 03:54:41.307]  Yeah, I noticed that this morning.
[03:54:41.307 --> 03:54:45.068]  I was over at Biggs' desk and Alex came in and he's looking at it.
[03:54:45.068 --> 03:54:46.168]  He's like, post that right now.
[03:54:46.668 --> 03:54:49.669]  So we've got it posted.
[03:54:49.669 --> 03:54:51.470]  It's pretty entertaining.
[03:54:51.470 --> 03:54:53.471]  I think it's called Wrestling with Politics.
[03:54:53.471 --> 03:54:54.771]  Wrestling with Politics.
[03:54:54.771 --> 03:54:57.132]  It only has 270 views.
[03:54:57.132 --> 03:54:58.653]  People, let's give this guy a bunch of views.
[03:54:58.653 --> 03:54:59.934]  Let's give him a bump.
[03:54:59.934 --> 03:55:05.616]  And he also has Alex Fighting Pierce and Governor Ventura and a bunch of other people in there as well.
[03:55:05.616 --> 03:55:07.397]  He has stuff about the debates and all that.
[03:55:08.357 --> 03:55:17.359]  This is kind of funny, but it shows that we're getting into that pop culture meme and area where the stuff we say can't just be dismissed anymore.
[03:55:17.359 --> 03:55:20.580]  It's actually being, you know, people are taking their time to say, hey, these guys are credible.
[03:55:20.580 --> 03:55:25.461]  I'm going to do a whole video game about them and showing some of the signs like 9-11 truth and all that.
[03:55:25.461 --> 03:55:27.182]  Anyway, that's not why I got you in here, Jakari.
[03:55:27.182 --> 03:55:28.722]  Tonight, you're hosting the Nightly News.
[03:55:28.722 --> 03:55:29.162]  You're back.
[03:55:29.162 --> 03:55:30.523]  You took a week off.
[03:55:30.523 --> 03:55:33.564]  Right before that, you were chasing the president around in Oregon.
[03:55:33.564 --> 03:55:35.304]  And right before that, we were chasing around the Pope.
[03:55:35.404 --> 03:55:42.866]  Praising the Pope, you've been on several chasing missions and logging many miles on foot and on rental car, by train, by air.
[03:55:42.866 --> 03:55:47.427]  I mean, this last two months you've probably done more traveling than you've done most of the year.
[03:55:47.427 --> 03:55:52.669]  Yeah, that Pope trip was probably about a week, but the latest trip was only two or three days.
[03:55:52.669 --> 03:55:58.190]  But you know, as far as travel, that's a lot of travel because we had to fly into Portland and then drive down to the city where the college was.
[03:55:58.190 --> 03:56:00.671]  So we had a lot of travel miles.
[03:56:00.871 --> 03:56:04.112]  But enough of that, let's talk about the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:56:04.112 --> 03:56:05.613]  What is going on tonight?
[03:56:05.613 --> 03:56:08.594]  So of course we're going to talk about the very, very sad news.
[03:56:08.594 --> 03:56:12.956]  I'm sure you want to wipe your eyes for this, that Joe Biden is not going to be running for president.
[03:56:12.956 --> 03:56:18.338]  I was actually hoping for more creepy Uncle Joe, like getting next to Hillary and sticking his nose in there.
[03:56:18.338 --> 03:56:19.799]  Yeah, those are some weird photos of him.
[03:56:19.799 --> 03:56:21.160]  Very weird, creepy Uncle Joe.
[03:56:21.160 --> 03:56:22.560]  Doing all kinds of weird stuff.
[03:56:22.560 --> 03:56:25.721]  And also, you know, go out on your balcony and shoot your shotgun off.
[03:56:25.721 --> 03:56:26.862]  Buy a shotgun!
[03:56:27.302 --> 03:56:28.742]  Ridiculousness.
[03:56:28.742 --> 03:56:37.785]  And it is Back to the Future Day, so we're going to talk about the things that pertain to that, and not about the Cubs winning the World Series, but Kit has a real in-depth article.
[03:56:37.785 --> 03:56:45.427]  It breaks down how the world has changed since the movie first came out, and you know, the different changes that we could see that were somewhat foreshadowed.
[03:56:45.427 --> 03:56:47.607]  Even from the 80s to now, it's complete.
[03:56:47.607 --> 03:56:50.008]  The internet has definitely made the world a different place.
[03:56:50.008 --> 03:56:53.469]  I think for the better overall, but you know, you have the good with the bad, so.
[03:56:53.789 --> 03:56:58.392]  Yeah, I mean, it's always good and bad, but you know, you just try to make the balance the best way you can.
[03:56:58.392 --> 03:57:01.894]  Of course, we have the full video that you were talking about earlier with Leigh-Anne.
[03:57:01.894 --> 03:57:03.055]  She's going through her cleanse.
[03:57:03.055 --> 03:57:06.337]  Her and her friend, Emmy, who actually just got here, they're going to do a photo shoot.
[03:57:06.337 --> 03:57:12.301]  I guess they're going to post those pictures a little bit later so people can track their progress and, you know, see how the cleanse works for them.
[03:57:12.301 --> 03:57:15.744]  You know, because I'm like you, I haven't done the full cleanse, but I have taken the oxy powder.
[03:57:16.670 --> 03:57:18.271]  Yeah.
[03:57:18.271 --> 03:57:23.453]  I'll tell you man, this stuff, it'll clean you out.
[03:57:23.453 --> 03:57:28.675]  It'll clean you out and if you follow the regimen, you know, I think it says start with five and then increase.
[03:57:28.675 --> 03:57:30.696]  Yeah, I was doing four.
[03:57:30.696 --> 03:57:33.397]  Four is usually enough for me, but you know, different people have different... I take seven.
[03:57:33.937 --> 03:57:34.337]  Oh wow.
[03:57:34.337 --> 03:57:34.938]  Seven.
[03:57:34.938 --> 03:57:36.319]  And it works man, let me tell you.
[03:57:36.319 --> 03:57:44.744]  So I find it best, I usually take mine at night and when I do take it I try to take it with a little apple cider vinegar and a couple glasses of water.
[03:57:44.744 --> 03:57:46.405]  Make sure you're well hydrated.
[03:57:46.405 --> 03:57:47.006]  Exactly.
[03:57:47.006 --> 03:57:55.772]  And drink water all day long and it helps keep everything clean because all the crap out there that we eat, that we drink, that, you know, the radiation from
[03:57:56.332 --> 03:58:04.698]  Electromagnetic sources from TVs, from phones, I mean it all has an impact on our bodies and you're a pretty healthy guy, but it does take a lot of work to be healthy.
[03:58:04.698 --> 03:58:08.581]  But I think, you know, the benefits definitely outweigh the effort that you put in.
[03:58:08.581 --> 03:58:14.846]  And just like Group always says, you know, we go through all these efforts to clean the exterior, but we do very little to clean the interior.
[03:58:15.226 --> 03:58:15.526]  There you go.
[03:58:15.526 --> 03:58:17.947]  So you need to do something to clean out the inside of your mind.
[03:58:17.947 --> 03:58:24.171]  Yeah, the globalists have convinced us that it's all about how you look, not about how you feel and how you are on the inside.
[03:58:24.171 --> 03:58:25.511]  Join Jakari tonight, 7 p.m.
[03:58:25.511 --> 03:58:26.892]  Central, for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:58:26.892 --> 03:58:27.432]  I'm Rob Dew.
[03:58:27.432 --> 03:58:28.453]  This has been the fourth hour.
[03:58:28.453 --> 03:58:32.155]  You can check out InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:58:32.155 --> 03:58:32.835]  Thanks for watching.
