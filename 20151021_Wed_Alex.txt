[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:22.680]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.680 --> 00:32.600]  Former Congressman Ron Paul will be joining us at the start of the next hour. And then
[00:32.600 --> 00:37.320]  Michael Snyder from the Economic Collapse Blog will be joining us to cover the economy
[00:37.320 --> 00:49.200]  and a lot of other big major world developments coming up at the bottom of the hour. I don't
[00:49.200 --> 00:55.000]  normally get into just hype-related stories, but because there was so much news coverage
[00:55.000 --> 00:59.400]  of it, I happen to look into it a little bit and I can give my view, I wouldn't really
[00:59.400 --> 01:11.400]  call it an opinion, but my view, my perspective on whether or not the New Star Wars is anti-white
[01:11.400 --> 01:17.640]  because they've got CNN, Fox News all jumping on the bandwagon after WorldNet Daily ran
[01:17.640 --> 01:22.080]  a story a few days ago that Drudge picked up simply asking the question, pointing out
[01:22.080 --> 01:27.440]  sites that were making that claim. I think clearly you can say the whole political correct
[01:27.440 --> 01:34.000]  agenda is anti-human, anti-culture, and therefore anti-Western civilization, anti-white, but
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.240]  it's anti everybody else at the same time as well. It's playing different groups off
[01:38.240 --> 01:42.600]  against each other, obviously, but I'll give you my view on that at the bottom of the hour.
[01:42.600 --> 01:48.520]  I do not think that having a black lead actor is meant to be anti-white. There should be
[01:48.520 --> 01:55.040]  a black lead actor if he's a good actor. No one is going to say that the black Jedi
[01:55.040 --> 02:01.000]  master character that they had in episode one, two, and three was bad. Nobody complained
[02:01.000 --> 02:07.920]  about Samuel L. Jackson playing Mace Windu because he's a good actor and he pulled it
[02:07.920 --> 02:15.040]  off, you know, defeating Emperor Palpatine. This guy just looks like he has the same acting
[02:15.040 --> 02:20.360]  abilities as the other individual that played Anakin Skywalker. People didn't dislike him
[02:20.360 --> 02:26.400]  because he was white. They disliked him because he wasn't very masculine. He didn't carry
[02:26.400 --> 02:33.640]  the role across. I mean, James Earl Jones' voice in a seven foot tall armored guy in
[02:33.640 --> 02:42.200]  black with a samurai helmet on, breathing on a respirator, is intimidating. This guy
[02:42.200 --> 02:48.000]  running around in a stormtrooper outfit, it has the feel of an after school movie. See,
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.720]  I said I'd cover it at the bottom of the hour. I'm already doing it. But there's some other
[02:52.720 --> 03:00.240]  big twists to this that are more important. I wouldn't say this film's anti-white. It's
[03:00.240 --> 03:05.360]  anti-male, though. And so the rest of the story is coming up at the bottom of the hour
[03:05.360 --> 03:11.360]  because look, this is not really important overall except the overall programming that
[03:11.360 --> 03:16.160]  is going on. That's what we really got to be aware of. That's, in my view, what we've
[03:16.160 --> 03:23.000]  got to be looking at. So that's coming up. Now, speaking of political correctness being
[03:23.000 --> 03:32.920]  nothing but cultural tyranny, banned students suspended over racist fruit basket gift. Teams
[03:32.920 --> 03:41.320]  give each other gifts during football games, especially things like homecoming and other
[03:41.320 --> 03:49.120]  special events. And I've looked at the story. They gave them a fruitcake, which is customary
[03:49.120 --> 03:54.720]  in the fall and winter. And because it had small pieces of watermelon in amongst the
[03:54.720 --> 04:01.200]  dozens of other fruits, well, that is racist, just like brown bags are racist. Now, building
[04:01.200 --> 04:03.800]  Planned Parenthood in the middle of black neighborhoods and having Planned Parenthood
[04:03.800 --> 04:10.600]  say they're there to exterminate the black weeds, that is not racist. But watermelon,
[04:10.600 --> 04:17.400]  ladies and gentlemen, in a fruitcake, in amongst the nuts and the cherries and the pieces
[04:17.400 --> 04:28.680]  of pineapple and grapes and chunks of strawberry dried fruit is evil. And so now they are,
[04:28.680 --> 04:34.520]  the school says, they apologize that it was quite evil. So we're all going to be saved.
[04:34.520 --> 04:42.040]  And that ties in to France prosecutes political leader, Le Pen. She's set to be the next president
[04:42.040 --> 04:47.360]  probably in polls, but no, she's facing a year in prison for criticizing radical Islam.
[04:47.360 --> 04:53.000]  That's illegal. And that ties into this report. Finish police banned from identifying migrants
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.440]  as criminal suspects. Stay with us. It's a big broadcast coming up.
[04:57.440 --> 05:06.120]  It was 30 years ago in 1985 that Doc and Marty went back another 30 years to 1955. Then they
[05:06.120 --> 05:13.720]  went back to the future to today. We're going, we don't need roads. Well, there's no flying
[05:13.720 --> 05:17.440]  cars and it isn't the roads they say we don't need. They tell us where we're going. There
[05:17.440 --> 05:22.160]  won't be any drivers. And there's no hoverboards or self lacing shoes, but at least we're
[05:22.160 --> 05:29.400]  not plagued with fax machines. You may just need a lightning strike for power says Obama
[05:29.400 --> 05:36.320]  and the EPA are trying to shut down most of the power plants. But the movie's future
[05:36.320 --> 05:40.840]  resembles the present in a couple of very strange ways. The Cubs got in the world series
[05:40.840 --> 05:46.640]  and even stranger. Discover how in 1979, Biff successfully lobbied to legalize gambling

[08:49.480 --> 08:55.280]  coming up today. Of course, being hosted by one of the nightly news crew and of course
[08:55.280 --> 09:01.680]  with special reports from yours truly with the three hours 11am to 2pm central time
[09:01.680 --> 09:07.080]  hosted by yours truly. I forgot to tell you guys during the break. I ignored it during
[09:07.080 --> 09:11.760]  the first five minutes, but I can't handle it during this 12 minute segment. You've got
[09:11.760 --> 09:16.800]  an ultra high squeal going down my line and I'm in to tell you in the break. So I forgot
[09:16.800 --> 09:20.920]  to do that. So I'm going to tell you now. Thank you. Try to whatever you got flipped
[09:20.920 --> 09:25.520]  on there to flip it off. Thank you. All right, continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, the
[09:25.520 --> 09:37.040]  fight between Donald Trump and Jeb Bush over the fact that 911 happened on the watch of
[09:37.040 --> 09:42.560]  George W. Bush is heating up. We've got some clips of that we're going to be going over.
[09:42.560 --> 09:50.640]  Also NASA gives it a 99% probability of a 5.0 earthquake in Los Angeles in the near future.
[09:50.640 --> 09:56.400]  That's what our seismologists have been saying on the broadcast as well, that it's the only
[09:56.400 --> 10:05.080]  area in the ring of fire that is not triggered yet and it's overdue to be triggered. Just
[10:05.080 --> 10:09.240]  on a political correctness front. These are not our top stories. I'm just getting to these
[10:09.240 --> 10:14.840]  first. Texas team arrested for homemade clock that looked exactly like a briefcase bomb
[10:14.840 --> 10:19.400]  and wouldn't say it wasn't a bomb. Total stunt, obviously. His father's done stunts
[10:19.400 --> 10:27.200]  before is now to move to Qatar, which will be our cutter. Perfect place for him. The
[10:27.200 --> 10:31.520]  folks, obviously, that are working with Saudi Arabia are based over there in all the fun
[10:31.520 --> 10:36.400]  happening in the Middle East right now. He's visited with the White House repeatedly, met
[10:36.400 --> 10:42.920]  with Obama again this weekend and has been meeting with world Islamic leaders and U.S.
[10:42.920 --> 10:49.280]  Islamic leaders about what a poor little victim he is. Isn't that just special? The
[10:49.280 --> 10:57.800]  reason I get to that first is coming up. We're going to look at how the globalists create
[10:57.800 --> 11:02.120]  the crisis to then offer the solution, which is total control. They don't bring in groups
[11:02.120 --> 11:09.520]  that won't assimilate and then just basically let those groups operate on their own. Those
[11:09.520 --> 11:17.920]  groups then demand that the West adopt whatever the cause du jour is, whatever the flavor of
[11:17.920 --> 11:24.240]  the day is, just a set of precedent and then you're arrested, you're fined, you're feed,
[11:24.240 --> 11:31.360]  you're demonized, you're shut down by the political correct police if you don't comply
[11:31.360 --> 11:36.720]  to whatever the new form of domination is. And here are the reports with video. We have
[11:36.720 --> 11:44.080]  video of Marie Le Pen appearing in French court and she faces one year in prison and
[11:44.080 --> 11:49.720]  massive fines. She is the presidential frontrunner in many polls right now and so their answer
[11:49.720 --> 11:56.640]  is just arrest her. France prosecutes political leader for criticizing Muslims. Marie Le
[11:56.640 --> 12:09.300]  Pen faces year in prison and more. So welcome to the next level of oppression and that ties
[12:09.300 --> 12:13.320]  into something we know has been going on here in the United States for a long time. If you
[12:13.320 --> 12:22.080]  don't hear the race of a suspect in a murder or a hit and run or a carjacking, if you hear
[12:22.080 --> 12:27.240]  white male, then you know it was a white male. But if you don't hear what the suspect looks
[12:27.240 --> 12:33.600]  like, they just say a man robbed a woman at this park. He was driving a blue Ford Chevy
[12:33.600 --> 12:40.680]  or whatever he was driving. Then you know it was a quote minority and this is an unspoken
[12:40.680 --> 12:45.960]  rule of political correctness. Again, just setting the precedent on information management
[12:45.960 --> 12:51.440]  and once you get the media and the police lying in concert on one subject, then they
[12:51.440 --> 12:58.640]  can segue into every other very quickly. Finish police ban from identifying migrants
[12:58.640 --> 13:06.160]  as criminal suspects. Authorities want to quote avoid racist backlash from critics of
[13:06.160 --> 13:13.800]  migrant influx. And in Germany, they arrest you and take your children if you criticize
[13:13.800 --> 13:18.920]  the government's open borders. Boy, I thought you had free speech, didn't you? Collapse
[13:18.920 --> 13:23.640]  Sweden raped and robbed by migrants and that's the words of their own government that they
[13:23.640 --> 13:28.440]  are collapsing right now as the government accelerates advertising that if you can get
[13:28.440 --> 13:33.440]  there, everything's free. This is part of the government committing suicide against their
[13:33.440 --> 13:40.520]  own culture. Migrants stay in four star hotel while poor Germans lose their homes. Paul
[13:40.520 --> 13:47.120]  Joseph Watson article on info wars dot com linked on drugs report dot com right now low
[13:47.120 --> 13:52.720]  income families evicted to make way for asylum seekers. Also the elderly started happening
[13:52.720 --> 13:58.640]  a month ago, but we have a new report linking through to mainstream national German television
[13:58.640 --> 14:03.240]  reporting on it with a straight face like it's a good thing. Migrants are being housed
[14:03.240 --> 14:08.320]  in a four star hotel in Germany. All Germans themselves are being told to leave their homes
[14:08.320 --> 14:13.240]  to make way for asylum seekers. See, you know, you think, oh, you work your whole life for
[14:13.240 --> 14:18.120]  the government or whatever and you get government assisted living a part of your bill paid for
[14:18.120 --> 14:22.000]  in government housing, but you still basically pay rent. Then all of a sudden you wake up,
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.600]  you need to leave when you're 75 years old because we're going to put an Islamic family
[14:26.600 --> 14:30.840]  in and people say, well, don't be anti Islamic. That's right. Show you're not anti Islamic
[14:30.840 --> 14:35.880]  because groups identifying as Islamic are going to get your house.
[14:35.880 --> 14:42.160]  The four star hotel, the sheer number of asylum seekers making their way into a Saxony region
[14:42.160 --> 14:51.520]  has resulted in an accommodations crisis. While the matrium hotel in Halle now being
[14:51.520 --> 14:56.600]  used to house at least 80 migrants who began arriving last week, the four star hotel, Boston
[14:56.600 --> 15:01.560]  indoor swimming pool sauna and fitness room. And it's located just 10 minute walk from
[15:01.560 --> 15:07.720]  the historic old town. And then we have the illegals complaining too that they're not
[15:07.720 --> 15:12.920]  getting enough welfare quick enough and German schoolchildren are sent to make their beds
[15:12.920 --> 15:17.160]  and clean their facilities.
[15:17.160 --> 15:24.280]  Trump revoke passports for those who go to fight for ISIS would look at closing certain
[15:24.280 --> 15:29.640]  mosque. And again, the media is acting like this is the most evil statement ever made
[15:29.640 --> 15:34.480]  in the history of humankind. If you have a mosque, it's really a political organization
[15:34.480 --> 15:38.760]  calling for murder and death and whatever. I don't think you close it. I think you are
[15:38.760 --> 15:47.840]  indict the leadership of it. But the issue is they're demonizing Trump for that. I mean,
[15:47.840 --> 15:51.600]  if you go fight for ISIS, you should be arrested when you try to return to this country. It's
[15:51.600 --> 15:56.640]  a known terrorist organization, but that's still not happening because the truth is ISIS
[15:56.640 --> 16:02.440]  is a Western NATO Saudi Arabian proxy army. Now we've got video of this as well coming
[16:02.440 --> 16:08.320]  up Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whether you agree with him or disagree with
[16:08.320 --> 16:18.240]  him, love him or hating or neutral. What Benjamin Netanyahu said in his latest speech in a meeting
[16:18.240 --> 16:27.280]  with Merkel is true. The Grand Maudi of Jerusalem was one of the most powerful Maudi's Mufti's
[16:27.280 --> 16:34.080]  in the world at the time. And it's mainline World War II history that he basically invited
[16:34.080 --> 16:41.480]  the Nazis into the Middle East and that they were basically invited into places like Libya
[16:41.480 --> 16:50.560]  after the Italians invaded. France basically invited Hitler in as well. That is most the
[16:50.560 --> 16:55.680]  government stood down and then a week later was put back in power by the Nazis. So it's
[16:55.680 --> 17:05.360]  true that the grand leader of the Islamic movement in the Middle East really at that time was
[17:05.360 --> 17:11.720]  a Nazi, went to Germany, was buddies with Hitler, encouraged Hitler to kill all the Jews.
[17:11.720 --> 17:20.080]  And so Merkel came out and said, no, Muslims have no part in killing Jews. It's all Germans
[17:20.080 --> 17:27.240]  fault. I guess modern Germans, it's their fault too. So it's all part of this guilt complex.
[17:27.240 --> 17:31.480]  Germany on Wednesday said that responsibility for the Holocaust to lay with the Germans after
[17:31.480 --> 17:37.280]  Israel's prime minister, Jan Jan, who sparked controversy before a visit to Berlin by saying
[17:37.280 --> 17:45.680]  a Muslim elder had convinced Hitler to exterminate the Jews. And then he goes over the fact that
[17:45.680 --> 17:50.800]  that went on. There's really not any secret that there is a love affair with the Nazis
[17:50.800 --> 17:56.240]  to this day in many areas of the Middle East. But the left doesn't care. They love teaming
[17:56.240 --> 18:02.080]  up with radical Islam because it is anti-western and they're anti-western and really want to
[18:02.080 --> 18:12.760]  mount the Renaissance and true liberalism on the wall as a safari trophy. Infamous refugee
[18:12.760 --> 18:18.120]  jungle camp swells out of control. France begged to bring in army. They even have their own
[18:18.120 --> 18:26.680]  discos, bars and shops. There's video of that up on infowars.com. Meanwhile, this is how
[18:26.680 --> 18:31.320]  knitting and politically correct. We're getting in the U.S. School fights against five-year-olds
[18:31.320 --> 18:38.920]  using sexist language like he and she, father and mother, boy and girl. And they're traumatizing
[18:38.920 --> 18:44.200]  the poor little five-year-olds with cameras on the buses to analyze their speech patterns
[18:44.200 --> 18:48.960]  and call them in and dress them down for their speech. Because what you learn in public school
[18:48.960 --> 18:55.800]  and in other accredited facilities as well is how to control what you say and have limited
[18:55.800 --> 19:03.000]  language and be completely uptight and upset at a basket case of mental illness. And that
[19:03.000 --> 19:08.440]  ties in with this next story that I mentioned earlier. Band students suspended over a racist
[19:08.440 --> 19:13.640]  fruit basket. It had been deemed first by the team when there was an investigation as
[19:13.640 --> 19:20.040]  not racist. It was a fruitcake. And the fruitcake had, I guess it doesn't say, but the average
[19:20.040 --> 19:25.280]  one has about 20 different fruits and nuts, dried apples, dried cherries are my favorite
[19:25.280 --> 19:31.000]  in them. I like fruitcakes, dried pineapple, dried watermelon and things like that. That
[19:31.000 --> 19:35.600]  was the problem. Folks identified there were some small pieces of watermelon and obviously
[19:35.600 --> 19:40.700]  if you give watermelon to a team that has some black people on it, it must be racist
[19:40.700 --> 19:47.000]  secret code. So we're all looking for racist secret codes and the school has apologized
[19:47.000 --> 19:52.680]  for the fact that that was happening. I mean, I guess schools can't serve watermelon period
[19:52.680 --> 19:56.800]  because it's so evil. And of course, they're going to expand that out now, the brown bags
[19:56.800 --> 19:58.480]  and everything else.
[19:58.480 --> 20:07.120]  Earthquake, floods, winter storms, prolonged power outages or war. Each of us have had that
[20:07.120 --> 20:12.000]  moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared. We typically do the same thing.
[20:12.000 --> 20:15.880]  We start with food storage, then we address the need for water. But have you considered
[20:15.880 --> 20:20.440]  heat storage? I'm talking about staying warm in the cold. Here are some things for you
[20:20.440 --> 20:25.400]  to consider. How will I keep my family warm? The standard answers are firewood, coal or
[20:25.400 --> 20:29.360]  propane. But the problem with that, if you need to be on the move is you can't take
[20:29.360 --> 20:33.880]  it with you. Another concern, there may come a time when you need to stay warm without
[20:33.880 --> 20:38.400]  smoke, like in times of war. There may even come a time when you can't burn fuel. The
[20:38.400 --> 20:45.040]  answers may be simpler and less costly than you think. For these answers, go to fortressclothing.com.
[20:45.040 --> 20:50.440]  Again, fortressclothing.com has the answers to your heat storage dilemma. Don't get stuck

[22:34.760 --> 22:43.520]  They did. Before that, I warned that.com companies would crash. They did. Those who listened
[22:43.520 --> 22:48.360]  had a chance to save themselves. But this has nothing to do with the stock market. This

[24:52.720 --> 25:01.400]  Once dubbed the great humanitarian power by its ex-prime minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt,
[25:01.400 --> 25:06.680]  Sweden is on the edge of a brutal collapse due to a wave of entitled immigrants, raping
[25:06.680 --> 25:24.960]  Sweden's women at a rate of 53.2 percent. And bleeding the economy of the country dry.
[25:24.960 --> 25:30.640]  Hey, welcome to Sweden. This is the number one rape capital of Europe. Some say that
[25:30.640 --> 25:35.800]  this is because Sweden is very progressive and aware of destructive patriarchal norms,
[25:35.800 --> 25:40.520]  which is why our definition of rape is broader than in other countries, and more considerate
[25:40.520 --> 25:45.240]  to the victims. Others say that it's because of our massive levels of immigration, where
[25:45.240 --> 25:50.120]  we import thousands of people from countries in the Middle East and Africa, places that
[25:50.120 --> 25:55.840]  don't really have the best views on women's rights. But it doesn't matter who is right.
[25:55.840 --> 26:00.560]  We will never know who is right, because we aren't allowed to talk about it. Here in
[26:00.560 --> 26:07.040]  Sweden, everything is considered racist. Danish historian Lars Hedegaard warned the
[26:07.040 --> 26:12.720]  final consequence of the West and above all, Sweden's immigration policies that the economy
[26:12.720 --> 26:18.360]  will collapse. Because who is going to pay for it all? Increasing taxes on wage earners
[26:18.360 --> 26:23.320]  in Sweden to pay for the influx of illegal immigrants is not enough. In August, Finance
[26:23.320 --> 26:29.360]  Minister Magdalena Andersen said the government is looking at borrowing large sums of money
[26:29.360 --> 26:35.080]  from the European investment bank to pay for illegal immigration. Why has one government
[26:35.080 --> 26:41.040]  after another chosen to spend Swedish taxpayers' money to support and shelter citizens of
[26:41.040 --> 26:47.680]  other countries while some of them try to kill us? Asked Ingrid Carlvist after a Swedish
[26:47.680 --> 26:53.280]  woman and her son were stabbed to death at an Ikea store in Vastra, Sweden by Abraham
[26:53.280 --> 26:59.000]  Uqba Gabir. An illegal immigrant Uqba Gabir said he lost control after learning he was
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.800]  going to be deported to Italy. He killed an innocent woman and her son to make people
[27:03.800 --> 27:10.040]  understand him. Prior to the murders, Sweden's third largest city, Malmo, experienced ethnic
[27:10.040 --> 27:15.360]  violence between groups of immigrants. The gangs described as youths by the Swedish media
[27:15.360 --> 27:20.720]  used guns, bombs, and hand grenades to mark their turf. In August, the Swedish Migration
[27:20.720 --> 27:25.920]  Board Migrations Vergett recorded almost as many reports of threats and violence and asylum
[27:25.920 --> 27:31.800]  accommodation as throughout the whole of 2014, according to Swedish newspaper Dagens
[27:31.800 --> 27:37.080]  Jättar. In Sweden, which does not usually report the nationality of rapists, a just
[27:37.080 --> 27:42.640]  released study by Swedish police revealed that Muslim men who constitute only 2% of
[27:42.640 --> 27:51.000]  the population are responsible for 77.6% of rapes, giving once peaceful Sweden the highest
[27:51.000 --> 27:57.600]  rape rate in Europe and the second highest in the world, next to South Africa. Currently,
[27:57.600 --> 28:02.600]  illegal immigrants are being housed in former royal mansions, and Sweden is building housing
[28:02.600 --> 28:08.120]  for the chaotic violent army, taking over and raping their own country.
[28:08.120 --> 28:12.160]  Ultimately, I want to see every single woman in this country come from head to toe. I want
[28:12.160 --> 28:15.920]  to see the hand of the thief cuts. I want to see a daughter stone to death. I want to
[28:15.920 --> 28:19.200]  see Sharia law in Europe, and I want to see it in America as well.
[28:19.200 --> 28:21.200]  John Bowne for IfWars.com.
[28:21.200 --> 28:31.920]  And the presidential front runner in national polls, LePen, comes out and mildly criticizes
[28:31.920 --> 28:36.280]  that their borders are wide open and they shouldn't be paying for foreigners, free healthcare,
[28:36.280 --> 28:44.000]  and she is in court, indicted, facing one year in prison for her hate speech. Now you
[28:44.000 --> 28:51.280]  think about that. And now, Finnish police, they're also now announcing this in Sweden,
[28:51.280 --> 28:58.520]  are going to ban the release of crime statistics on race or religion. And it's not even that
[28:58.520 --> 29:02.120]  Muslims on average, I looked at the demographics and the numbers, are like this in their own
[29:02.120 --> 29:11.960]  countries. The West is a toilet bowl for jihadis, criminals, rapists, scum. That's why upwards
[29:11.960 --> 29:18.000]  of 80% of them are military-aged men. And they're making the trek to Europe to feed
[29:18.000 --> 29:31.040]  off the schmucks, the jokes, the passive, self-hating, self-loathing, cuckold Westerners, who a lot
[29:31.040 --> 29:38.360]  of the left are literally having political orgasms right now. This is so delicious to
[29:38.360 --> 29:45.960]  them. And the uglier the slums, the more rotting housing, the more society collapses, the happier
[29:45.960 --> 29:52.920]  they get. They hate prosperity, they hate the West. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones

[33:20.500 --> 33:45.620]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, on this worldwide Wednesday transmission.
[33:45.620 --> 33:51.140]  We're going to go to one of these other John Bowne reports here in just a moment.
[33:52.260 --> 33:56.340]  And then after we do that, I'm going to come back and give you my breakdown
[34:01.140 --> 34:03.620]  on Star Wars, The Force Awakens.
[34:07.060 --> 34:14.180]  And is it quote, anti-white? I think that really is a wrong criticism of the film.
[34:14.180 --> 34:23.220]  And it really classically illustrates how this whole divide and conquer strategy works.
[34:27.540 --> 34:32.660]  And then we are going to get into the other geopolitical news today.
[34:34.100 --> 34:42.180]  And the latest with what the stabilization program is engaging in here domestically ahead
[34:42.180 --> 34:49.140]  of Ron Paul joining us and others today. But John Bowne's been filing so many of these
[34:49.140 --> 34:54.580]  special reports as of late. They're all so important. Here's another one.
[34:55.940 --> 35:01.540]  In a private meeting, Attorney General Loretta Lynch told lawyers representing media organizations
[35:01.540 --> 35:06.820]  that the Justice Department will not send journalists to jail for doing their job.
[35:06.820 --> 35:11.780]  A commitment that previous Attorney General Eric Holder had made after the Obama administration
[35:11.780 --> 35:16.660]  charged more journalists and legitimate government whistleblowers with espionage than all other
[35:16.660 --> 35:22.900]  presidents combined since the passage of the 1917 Espionage Act. You know, having good men
[35:22.900 --> 35:30.420]  in positions of power and authority who run the fight for what's right, that's a rare thing.
[35:31.380 --> 35:37.300]  It's a powerful thing. It's something that shapes our future in ways we don't even understand.
[35:37.300 --> 35:44.260]  Whether it was targeting CIA whistleblower John Kirchow for exposing the agency's torture program,
[35:44.980 --> 35:49.780]  seizing Associated Press phone records, prosecuting Chelsea Manning or going after
[35:49.780 --> 35:55.380]  journalist James Ryzen and James Rosen, Holder undoubtedly oversaw the largest attack on the
[35:55.380 --> 36:01.220]  First Amendment in modern history. We have always been and we, I believe, continue to be in too
[36:01.220 --> 36:07.300]  many ways, essentially a nation of cowards. Holder, who was found to be the least popular
[36:07.300 --> 36:12.020]  politician in the United States according to a heart research poll, was arguably the most
[36:12.020 --> 36:17.220]  criminal government official within the Obama administration. Among his many crimes, a select
[36:17.220 --> 36:24.980]  few have remained at center stage. Well, Daryl Issa, the congressman, has told Eric Holder,
[36:24.980 --> 36:31.460]  admit you knew. Admit you lied because now they've got the emails, the witnesses that Holder was
[36:31.460 --> 36:41.140]  running the ATF, the FBI, the DEA and four other agencies in not only ATF ordering gun shops to
[36:41.140 --> 36:48.900]  sell guns, but two ATF agents that were coming in and selling them to Mexican drug cartels.
[36:48.900 --> 36:57.540]  Now, a top CBS news reporter says the White House screamed and swore at her overfast and furious,
[36:58.260 --> 37:05.860]  and that they're actually panicking over the fact that this could bring down this mafia White House.
[37:05.860 --> 37:10.660]  Celica Still, who's in federal prison for selling a couple shotguns, he's a former DEA agent,
[37:10.660 --> 37:18.340]  retired schoolteacher, they set him up. Six years ago on my show, he told me that Sinaloa
[37:18.340 --> 37:24.420]  was allowed to ship drugs in the United States and that Los Zetas that was trained at Fort Benning,
[37:24.420 --> 37:29.300]  Georgia, Mexican commandos, were going to have a fake defection to the drug cartels,
[37:29.300 --> 37:34.980]  but really it was a covert secret war against other cartels not laundering their money
[37:34.980 --> 37:39.300]  through the proper Mexican and U.S. banks. That's how I knew two and a half years ago,
[37:39.300 --> 37:43.140]  when Holder, the attorney general, started demonizing the Second Amendment and saying,
[37:43.140 --> 37:49.140]  we've got to restrict gun ownership because the problems in Mexico, I knew from selling others
[37:49.140 --> 37:54.580]  that they were already, even before Obama got in office, shipping guns into Mexico
[37:56.420 --> 38:02.020]  and drugs back in. Here are some of the headlines. Operation Fast and Furious is just the tip
[38:02.020 --> 38:06.180]  of the iceberg. Here's the head of the Sinaloa cartel, number two in command, but the head of
[38:06.180 --> 38:10.420]  the U.S. operation, and the feds have now come into court and said, it's true, he worked for us.
[38:10.420 --> 38:17.780]  National security has been declared. Here it is from over a month ago. Documents fed allegedly
[38:17.780 --> 38:23.700]  allowed Sinaloa cartel to move cocaine to the U.S. for information that's now since been confirmed
[38:24.420 --> 38:29.540]  in federal court. The feds have declared national security. So Sinaloa was hired to knock out
[38:29.540 --> 38:33.860]  competition. They were laundering their money through the proper banks. Here's another one.
[38:33.860 --> 38:40.660]  Taxpayers paid for Fast and Furious plan to arm Sinaloa drug cartel. So again, it's not just guns
[38:40.660 --> 38:46.020]  directly shipped by ATF Sinaloa. Sinaloa has been confirmed to be allowed. They're the main
[38:46.020 --> 38:52.500]  cartel along with Texas, Mexico border to bring in around half of the $500 billion a year in drug
[38:52.500 --> 38:58.900]  money. The rest of the story is this is like Iran Contra with the Reagan administration shipping
[38:58.900 --> 39:04.500]  guns down to Central and South America to drug cartels to knock out their competition and then
[39:04.500 --> 39:11.460]  ship the cocaine into the U.S. Business has always stayed the same. Eric Holder who has publicly
[39:11.460 --> 39:16.900]  stated his desire to brainwash the public to think negatively about gun ownership. And what we need
[39:16.900 --> 39:22.100]  to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people. One thing that I
[39:22.100 --> 39:27.140]  think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about
[39:27.140 --> 39:32.020]  this. It's not enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday.
[39:32.020 --> 39:36.980]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[39:36.980 --> 39:42.340]  about guns in a vastly different way. Attorney General Lynch is following the modus operandi
[39:42.340 --> 39:48.820]  of her predecessor to a T. She has done absolutely nothing to investigate the executives at HSBC for
[39:48.820 --> 39:54.020]  laundering cartel drug money. In the words of former Senate investigator Jack Bloom, they took
[39:54.020 --> 39:58.740]  every imaginable form of illegal and illicit business. Despite the bank's involvement in the
[39:58.740 --> 40:03.780]  largest terrorism and drug money laundering case in U.S. history, Holder had refused to prosecute
[40:03.780 --> 40:09.140]  any of the HSBC executives. And according to Holder, the economy would have suffered if any of
[40:09.140 --> 40:14.420]  the bank's leaders faced punishment. Holder had also refused to prosecute any Wall Street CEOs
[40:14.420 --> 40:19.300]  for their role in the country's financial crisis. Holder's career will go down as possibly the
[40:19.300 --> 40:24.420]  most criminal ever executed by an attorney general of the United States. The fact that Loretta Lynch
[40:24.420 --> 40:28.660]  had to assure the American people that she would not arrest journalists when we already have a
[40:28.660 --> 40:34.500]  First Amendment granting that protection is a red flag. Criminals still run the United States
[40:34.500 --> 40:43.460]  Department of Justice. John Bowne for Infowars.com. Those are the type of reports that air basically
[40:43.460 --> 40:49.700]  every night during the Infowars Nightly News, 7 to 8 o'clock Central Standard Time now on

[41:15.540 --> 41:22.740]  I'm going to give a brief breakdown to the new Star Wars movie. I guess you could call it
[41:22.740 --> 41:36.260]  Episode 7. That happens decades after Return of the Jedi and that giant teddy bear advertisement
[41:36.260 --> 41:49.060]  for small children. Star Wars was new and interesting and original in 1977. By the early 1980s,
[41:49.060 --> 41:58.660]  it was old hat and total 21st century propaganda selling cheap plastic toys to children.
[42:01.380 --> 42:10.580]  By 2015, it is something far worse. Now, the question has been asked by CNN, by WorldNet Daily,
[42:10.580 --> 42:23.380]  by many others. Is the new Star Wars anti-white? And CNN makes a joke out of it and basically says,
[42:23.380 --> 42:31.380]  look at all the hate on Twitter because a couple of different sites affiliated with white
[42:31.380 --> 42:38.180]  nationalists and people said, you know, what is this? A movie with a black guy as the lead in
[42:38.180 --> 42:45.940]  Star Wars? Star Wars is supposedly a bunch of white people from the 1970s. And it shows how
[42:45.940 --> 42:55.860]  the population is obsessed with fantasy, not reality. I mean, this was a story told a long time ago
[42:55.860 --> 43:08.420]  in a galaxy far, far away. 1977 is a different world from 2015. And so on its face, having a
[43:08.420 --> 43:14.740]  black lead actor, I don't think is anti-white. But when you look at all the political correctness
[43:15.380 --> 43:21.060]  where French prosecutors have indicted the presidential frontrunner, Le Pen, for criticizing
[43:21.060 --> 43:28.100]  radical Islam, when Finnish police have been banned from identifying migrants as criminal suspects in
[43:28.100 --> 43:38.420]  the majority of rapes and murders, when the media won't report when black people attack white people
[43:38.420 --> 43:46.100]  in this country and cover up those statistics, yes, there is an anti-white agenda. But you can't
[43:46.100 --> 43:56.340]  exaggerate it and project it on to a Disney production of Star Wars. Now that said,
[43:58.420 --> 44:04.180]  the anti-white agenda is just an anti-human agenda. It is a globalist agenda.
[44:06.580 --> 44:11.780]  But when you drill down into these movies, they're first and foremost about selling toys.
[44:11.780 --> 44:18.980]  So if you can have, because that's where they make 80% of their money in a franchise like Star
[44:18.980 --> 44:27.460]  Wars, they've made what? Last time I checked, $4 billion off the movies, saw a factoid in Time
[44:27.460 --> 44:34.900]  Magazine a year ago, was it? I'm sure it's higher now, $4 billion on the movies, $10 billion on toys,
[44:34.900 --> 44:41.700]  and at least another $10 billion just on franchise fees for the video games.
[44:45.060 --> 44:50.820]  So it's about video games and it's about toys and it's about a vehicle. I'm not saying anything we
[44:50.820 --> 44:58.180]  don't know, but let's be conscious about this. To have people shell out money for Star Wars video
[44:58.180 --> 45:06.500]  games, Star Wars toys, Star Wars birthday parties, Star Wars lightsabers, all the rest of it. And
[45:06.500 --> 45:15.780]  sure, some of it's fun, so what? It's free market. But Disney separately has put out the new Captain
[45:15.780 --> 45:23.220]  America who's black and who fights white people who are constitutionalist, sons of the serpent,
[45:23.220 --> 45:29.620]  sons of liberty, the cold pepper flag, who go out and attack the poor innocent migrants coming
[45:29.620 --> 45:38.820]  across the border. So yes, Disney that owns ABC and Marvel Comics is anti-white, is anti-gun,
[45:38.820 --> 45:48.340]  and is beyond leftist, it is totalitarian. So yes, this is overall part of the rebranding,
[45:48.340 --> 45:54.820]  part of the larger divide and conquer. So that young black kids can grow up believing they're
[45:54.820 --> 46:00.900]  going to get ahead battling white people, but never knowing the real threat, institutions like
[46:00.900 --> 46:06.500]  Planned Parenthood, fluoride in the water, poisons in the vaccines, the list goes on and on. Just
[46:06.500 --> 46:13.460]  type in fluoride, worse for blacks than whites. You can get all the statistics and numbers on that
[46:13.460 --> 46:21.380]  for yourself and that's on average the physiology. Now I'll give you the rest of the story right now.
[46:22.900 --> 46:26.900]  I think there's also a big backlash on Twitter against this new lead character.
[46:28.980 --> 46:31.940]  We can put some of those articles on screen for folks.
[46:34.820 --> 46:42.340]  In the fact that he's bought into it all and come out and said, oh, you don't like having a black
[46:42.340 --> 46:50.020]  lead person in the role get used to it. And his name is John Boyega.
[46:53.220 --> 46:57.700]  Well, there was a big backlash against somebody else in a lead male role because he obviously
[46:57.700 --> 47:01.620]  wasn't masculine enough and didn't have any presence. And that was Hayden Christiansen
[47:02.260 --> 47:09.300]  who played Anakin Skywalker and then Darth Vader. I mean, I would have Hayden Christiansen play a
[47:09.300 --> 47:17.060]  wimp in a movie. I wouldn't have him play Darth Vader. See, there wasn't a backlash against
[47:17.060 --> 47:21.940]  having James Earl Jones be the voice of Darth Vader or Darth Vader being black in color
[47:22.500 --> 47:28.740]  because it was ominous. There was presence. It all meshed together. It worked. The real rejection
[47:28.740 --> 47:41.940]  of John Boyega born in 1992 is that he has the classical narcissistic days look in his eye.
[47:41.940 --> 47:45.940]  He comes across as about like a five year old. He doesn't have any presence.
[47:48.340 --> 47:50.900]  And it just makes the movie look like a complete joke.
[47:50.900 --> 47:58.980]  But he's meant to have 12 year old kids think he's cool and manly because somebody really
[47:58.980 --> 48:04.340]  manly a little kid doesn't identify with. When you're 10, you don't identify with a 25 year old
[48:04.340 --> 48:10.900]  special ops guy. You identify with the 14 year old that's a few years older than you and acts tough.
[48:10.900 --> 48:16.180]  And so you have to understand this is pure programming to hook young kids just like they
[48:16.180 --> 48:20.980]  admit Ewoks were meant to sell little girls and little boys millions of fur dolls.
[48:23.220 --> 48:30.100]  Kenner and George Lucas could not crack the female market. 90% of their market was male.
[48:30.100 --> 48:35.940]  So they made that whole horrible movie return of the Jedi about trying to sell girls Ewoks.
[48:36.660 --> 48:44.260]  It flopped no one wanted them. Just like Jar Jar Binks has a Caribbean black accent.
[48:44.260 --> 48:52.740]  He has gray skin in episode one and was a giant flop. It wasn't because he had an African slash
[48:52.740 --> 49:02.180]  Caribbean accent. Me likey. It was because it was ridiculous. It was a stupid character.
[49:02.180 --> 49:09.860]  And you aren't going to have Caribbean Islanders a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.
[49:09.860 --> 49:16.900]  It's just that it's so stupid. It's so badly done. It's horrible cinema. It's disgusting.
[49:16.900 --> 49:19.140]  It's a failure. It's a fraud.
[49:22.820 --> 49:26.420]  That's why people don't like it. Now let me give you the rest of the story.
[49:27.380 --> 49:29.940]  The really rest of the story. Here's the Washington Post.
[49:34.260 --> 49:38.580]  And there was an article out in CNN this week where the Pentagon said,
[49:38.580 --> 49:44.420]  yes, we're going to begin making women register with selective service for a potential draft.
[49:50.420 --> 49:58.180]  Military.com October 14th, just last week. And that's the rest of the story. At one level,
[49:58.180 --> 50:03.700]  it's about selling toys. At another level, if you've got women and the top bad guys, a woman,
[50:03.700 --> 50:10.100]  the top person battling the bad guy, the heroine is a woman, that's so you can sell girls all the
[50:10.100 --> 50:15.940]  action figures and toys as well. But that's only at the money making level. The message is approved
[50:15.940 --> 50:20.340]  because whether it's the Martian or any other new movie you see, there's admitted orders even in
[50:20.340 --> 50:27.700]  video games like Gamergate that all heroes and bosses be women. So whether it's Game of Thrones
[50:27.700 --> 50:33.940]  or whether it's Star Wars or whatever it is, suddenly almost all the bosses and authority figures
[50:33.940 --> 50:39.060]  are women. That's to hype women in a power trip into believing joining the military is going to
[50:39.060 --> 50:43.540]  empower them. And then they're going to be the boss. That's only meant to screw up the military
[50:43.540 --> 50:48.740]  ahead of getting rid of human militaries altogether in the next 20 years and moving to robots.
[50:48.740 --> 50:54.340]  So women are being used to spike the military, bring it down at the same time, break down
[50:54.340 --> 51:01.220]  civilization and prepare them for the workforce to pay taxes. This Hour of GCN, brought to you by

[53:53.460 --> 53:56.980]  For thou art my rock and my fortress, Psalm 31-3.
[54:08.180 --> 54:12.500]  All right, here's my final comment so far. I'm gonna shoot a produced report showing all the
[54:12.500 --> 54:16.500]  documents, all the articles, all the background. I've shown some of it here on your TV,
[54:16.500 --> 54:24.180]  if you were radio listeners can just search any term I throw out for yourself. But bottom line,
[54:24.820 --> 54:32.580]  the force awakens is a joke on the public. But I'm not singling out JJ Abrams and Disney.
[54:35.140 --> 54:41.140]  Everything coming out of mainstream Hollywood is basically weaponized and pointed at you and
[54:41.140 --> 54:47.780]  your family. I've talked to a lot of high level directors, producers, and they've said they're
[54:47.780 --> 54:57.460]  not allowed to put good messages in films. They just don't get funded. It has to fit into a certain
[54:57.460 --> 55:04.260]  parameter that it's internationally deployed, that the Chinese accept it, the Chinese government,
[55:04.260 --> 55:12.420]  that it promote globalism, that it promote women not being mothers but working in the system so
[55:12.420 --> 55:17.940]  the state can raise the children, that it stir up racial division in the name of fighting it,
[55:19.220 --> 55:26.500]  and then of course it make huge amounts of money. But I'll say this, I've been surprised by the
[55:26.500 --> 55:37.060]  writer and director JJ Abrams of The Force Awakens in some of his Star Trek remakes that have come
[55:37.060 --> 55:44.660]  out. I was not really a fan of Star Trek, pretty cheesy. Overall, some good plots. I like the old
[55:44.660 --> 55:50.980]  Star Trek from the 60s for entertainment value. It's the best unintentional comedy in the world
[55:50.980 --> 56:00.820]  with William Shatner battling the lizard creature, the fight scene, but the last Star Trek I saw
[56:00.820 --> 56:06.660]  where the government runs a false flag to launch a new war, I mean, that's a good plot.
[56:08.260 --> 56:12.980]  He almost redeemed himself, George Lucas, with episode three and he said, I wrote this
[56:13.700 --> 56:19.220]  because of the Iraq war. I changed how episode three goes and this shows what happened on 9-11.
[56:19.220 --> 56:26.740]  Well, a criminal group in the government ran 9-11. The problem was is that the public didn't even
[56:26.740 --> 56:31.780]  understand episode three and they had all these headlines and CNN and others. I shot reviews
[56:31.780 --> 56:38.340]  of it saying no one understands episode three. The plot doesn't make sense. It makes perfect sense.
[56:39.940 --> 56:44.340]  A criminal in government that wants to become a dictator stages terror attacks against his home
[56:44.340 --> 56:49.940]  planet, making himself the victim and the hero. He gets dictatorial power out of the strike and
[56:49.940 --> 56:54.500]  then takes out the old republic, claiming that they were part of a plan to overthrow the government.
[56:56.500 --> 57:01.380]  It's what you've seen happen, ladies and gentlemen, and George Lucas told the Cannes Film Festival
[57:02.020 --> 57:07.700]  when it was being released a few years after 9-11 that indeed this is what he believed happened
[57:07.700 --> 57:14.580]  on 9-11. What an incredible statement. And as bad as George Lucas is, it looks like though
[57:14.580 --> 57:19.140]  Disney's getting ready to do an even worse job with the franchise. So it's very saddening.
[57:19.140 --> 57:23.540]  I will go see it to analyze the propaganda, but it's just meant to sell toys and get women in the
[57:23.540 --> 57:31.300]  military and to get blacks to join the military. So they can go arm Al Qaeda and ISIS. It's a
[57:31.300 --> 57:35.620]  pretty sickening spectacle of mind control and I hope folks are smart enough to pick up on it.
[57:35.620 --> 57:42.900]  I'm sure you are. I'm done for now talking about it. SuperMailVitality is back in stock. It is
[57:42.900 --> 57:49.780]  amazing what it's done for myself. It has a close to a five-star review. It was like 4.5, 4.6, 4.7,

[58:13.300 --> 58:20.020]  of good clean energy. BrainForce is available as well. Knockout, which is again an amazing sleep aid
[58:20.020 --> 58:25.060]  and I remember to take it, has nine different healthy compounds. I just melatonin and valerian
[58:25.060 --> 58:29.540]  root. It all works synergistically and it's less than half the price the leading competitor
[58:29.540 --> 58:36.340]  that has similar compounds in it. So very affordable and it funds the operation infowarslife.com,

[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:37.060]  Former Congressman Ron Paul is set to join us coming up. We're going to talk about the economy,
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:44.820]  the situation in Syria and a lot more. Netanyahu has caused a big uproar by linking Palestinians
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:52.500]  to the Holocaust. You know, I think the Holocaust does get overused to push political agendas.
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:56.820]  I mean, if you won't turn your guns in, the ADL will come out and call you an anti-Semite.
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:06.180]  But you really can link the grand Mufti, the grand Imam of Jerusalem in World War II to
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:10.020]  the Nazis. I mean, he went to Germany. They traveled there. He was buddies with Hitler.
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:16.100]  He did encourage Hitler to kill all the Jews. That is a fact. The rest of the story is there
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:20.980]  were also some rich, powerful Jewish organizations that wouldn't let Jews get out of Germany or
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:24.820]  Europe without paying them protection money that they then shared with the Nazis. And then in
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:29.700]  Roosevelt, praised by so many Jewish groups, wouldn't let the Jewish migrants,
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:38.500]  true refugees, political persecution, get into the United States in 39, 40, 41, 42 when their ships
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:49.700]  would show up in New York City at Ellis Island. So the truth is, you can link the Nazis to a
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:54.180]  bunch of the founders of Israel. And there have been Jewish professors that have written articles
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:59.060]  about this. And boy, you raised this with a white supremacist. This is the thing that will make them
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:07.300]  the maddest because Hitler, good Jews, bad Hitler, God, Jews, the devil. But you could show them
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:12.820]  historians that have written books and Nuremberg trial information. I mean, look at George Soros.
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:19.300]  He was 13, 14, 15, 16 years old during the four years of World War II, helping ferret out and
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:24.580]  round up Jews. And he knew how they had their money and what they did for bosses above him
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:32.340]  who were Jewish. And then he was protected. So the truth is, the Jewish mafia, and that's why Dr.
[01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:36.980]  Steve Pacinac hates the Jewish mafia so much, his family barely got out of Russia. Some of them got
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:42.820]  killed in the Holocaust. And of course, his family told him about how they weren't allowed into the
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:49.380]  U.S. They had to go to Cuba when he was a little kid during World War II. He's told that story
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:55.860]  before. And I mean, that's just a fact, not just his story. That's why you get a lot of academic
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:03:01.460]  Jews and people that they call self-hating Jews who aren't the leftist type. There's that type,
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:07.780]  too, that's self-hating. There's more of a populist or right-wing Jew who doesn't like some of the
[01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:13.540]  folks that founded Israel because, well, they killed their family. They helped the Nazis kill
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:18.980]  their families and then sit there and play the part of the victims of it. Well, they sat out on
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:25.060]  the sidelines. Hitler, of course, was going to work to, when he took over Russia, to make an
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:31.300]  area of southern Russia the new Israel. And Hitler was also looking to ship the Jews to
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:38.580]  Palestine, which he saw as their homeland. And that's why he met with the grand Mufti who said,
[01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:43.540]  no, we don't want them here. Can you just kill them? And the last few years of World War II,
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:48.900]  Hitler did, actually, because I've read the Pulitzer Prize-winning books on the subject. I mean,
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:54.340]  these are quotes by Hitler to go ahead with the final solution. They didn't decide to go with
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:04:05.140]  the final solution until Hitler started losing at the beginning of the Battle of Leningrad and
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:11.380]  then Stalingrad. And there was a tank battle south of that city about six months before where the
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:15.140]  Germans started to really think they were going to lose, started building towards that. So then
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:20.580]  it shifted. Don't shake the Jews down and get their money through the Jewish handlers that
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:27.460]  Hitler was working with. Just go ahead and kill them. And so they went to a policy of killing
[01:04:27.460 --> 01:04:31.460]  everybody. And of course, they were killing a bunch of other groups. It is true that it's wrong
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:38.820]  that Hollywood only focuses on Jews that were killed. I mean, I think millions of Ukrainians
[01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:44.020]  killed by the Nazis, millions of Russians, I think millions of Poles killed. I think they're
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:47.860]  just as valuable as Jewish people that were killed. But on the other side of that equation,
[01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:52.980]  there's people that defend Hitler. I mean, Hitler was a complete out-of-control lunatic. I mean,
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:56.020]  just look at him, listen to him. I mean, look what he did to Germany.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:05.380]  It was 30 years ago in 1985 that Doc and Marty went back another 30 years to 1955.
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:11.220]  Then they went back to the future, to today. We're going, we don't need roads.
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:16.740]  Well, there's no flying cars and it isn't the roads they say we don't need. They tell us where
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:21.380]  we're going, there won't be any drivers. And there's no hoverboard or self-lacing shoes,
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:28.660]  but at least we're not plagued with fax machines. You may just need a lightning strike for power.
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:32.020]  Says Obama and the EPA are trying to shut down most of the power plants.
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:39.860]  But the movie's future resembles the present in a couple of very strange ways. The Cubs got in

[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:54.260]  You just want to say one thing. God bless America.

[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:20.900]  arabica beans. We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:14.180]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:38.180]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen. Welcome. Thank you so much for joining us on this October 21st,
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:45.220]  2015 worldwide broadcast. We're now eight minutes plus into the second hour today.
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:52.340]  There is so much I want to ask former congressman and of course medical doctor Ron Paul about what's
[01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:58.500]  happening currently in our world, the race for the speakership, the Tea Party rebellion that he
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:08.340]  and others helped create, the situation in Syria, the rapidly degrading economy, but also political
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:13.940]  persecution. And I wanted to cover this first. Ted Cruz came out and said that he's worried about
[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:18.500]  internet freedom, that there's major talk about censoring the internet in the Senate.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:24.660]  Matt Drudge was on with us giving us an exclusive interview a few weeks ago saying that he talked
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:29.540]  face to face with the Supreme Court justice at dinner that said they've got the votes.
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:35.540]  They're coming to restrict free speech next year. Hillary has now announced that if she's
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:41.140]  elected she will try for a national gun buyback and a repeal of the Second Amendment. That's
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:48.420]  actually a quote. So the statements are very bold right now and we're seeing a massive continued
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:55.540]  IRS persecution of conservative and libertarian groups. I wanted to not so much ask Ron Paul
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:10:00.500]  his view of this. I mean, I want to do that. I also wanted to ask him what we should do.
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:06.500]  I mean, I think it shows how effective the liberty movement is that the system wants to
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:13.300]  silence us. But at the same time, I think we have to address this and really discuss how we're
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:18.660]  supposed to respond to it because Matt Drudge said he's been told by high-level government folks
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:24.100]  the persecution is about to kick into high gear. He visited me two weeks ago to deliver that message.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:28.100]  A lot of other high-level people are telling me the same thing. I know with your context, sir,
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:32.900]  you must be getting the same intel. So can you speak to this and you're, I mean, in Europe,
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:38.420]  there are resting Germans that criticize open borders. Just it's not just here,
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:41.300]  but the Talitarianism seems to be spreading its wings.
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:49.780]  You know, when I left Congress a couple years ago, I listed several things that I thought were
[01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:56.100]  the greatest danger to us. And the top one was freedom of expression, the First Amendment.
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:01.220]  Because if we're not allowed to express ourselves, it makes it so difficult for us to compete with
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:06.740]  the propagandists from our government and from the media. So I think that is, it is crucial.
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:13.460]  But, you know, we are so hypocritical when it comes to our government because they pretend
[01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:18.580]  that we should support the issue of knowing the truth and knowing what's going on with government
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:25.060]  and we even write laws to protect the whistleblowers who are telling us the truth. But now we have
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:31.220]  numerous whistleblowers that are put in prison, you know, if they tell the truth. Matter of
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:36.740]  fact, the real irony is, is the chairman of the agency that's supposed to be in charge of protecting
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:43.300]  all the whistleblowers, he got fired because he told the truth about the whistleblower program.
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:48.820]  It really doesn't work. Now, this is getting worse and there's a lot going on right now. But,
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:55.460]  you know, just recently when we read about the death of Errin Schiff, he was actually in prison
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:12:01.300]  and killed by our government because he spoke out about the unconstitutionality of the way
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:07.620]  taxes were being collected. And it wasn't so much that he was not a violent person, he wasn't for
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:12.500]  anarchy or anything else. And I don't think you ever said the statement that there should be no
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:19.540]  taxes either. But because he said what the government was doing was unconstitutional and the government
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:24.180]  told him, you're not allowed to talk about that. And he did. And when he was 77, they put him in
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:30.020]  jail for 14 more years and literally, I think, killed him, you know, because it was a death
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:34.820]  sentence and it was a life sentence and he didn't get his medical care. So that's how ruthless the
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:39.300]  government is. Now, in Errin Schiff, I think it's a good lesson because what was he saying? He was
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:45.620]  challenging the financing of a government that's runaway. So the same way, if somebody tells us
[01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:51.220]  the truth about what's going on in the Middle East and how we have involved ourselves in these wars
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:56.900]  illegally and lied to ourselves into these wars our presidents have, you know, they can't
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:13:01.700]  tolerate that. They cannot tolerate the truth about our foreign policy. They cannot tolerate the
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:07.620]  truth about why they are ruthless in collecting taxes. And they're not going to tolerate the truth
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:13.380]  about how the Federal Reserve is run. That's why I always believe that the Federal Reserve,
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:17.940]  if everybody knew about it and more people know about it now than ever before, if the people
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:22.500]  knew about it, they wouldn't support the Federal Reserve. And fortunately, there's a lot of people
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:27.460]  waking up. But so much is done in secret. The bailouts are done in secret. So it's secret
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:32.340]  government that is the real issue. And when you talk about the ultimate secrets of government,
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:38.820]  then you become an enemy of the state. And when you have an empire, truth is treason in the
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:45.380]  empire of lies. And right now people are considered treasonous if they start telling us the plain
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:50.660]  truth about what our government is doing to us. That's right. Ron Paul, libertyreport.com,
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:55.620]  one of many powerful sites. He's doing syndicated radio vignettes, daily television,
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:14:00.260]  reaching millions of people. And that's why they're coming in and wanting to censor and wanting to
[01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:06.340]  control and wanting to shut down competition, because we're peacefully taking action. Erwin
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:11.060]  Schiff that died, Peter Schiff, frequent guest here, one of the top advisors, of course, to Ron
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:16.100]  Paul's campaign previously on economics. His dad was still chained down even when he couldn't speak
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:22.180]  anymore. And they basically wouldn't give him any medical care. And he died after spending 13 of a
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:27.620]  14 year prison sentence. And I remember it was in the Las Vegas Review Journal when the judge said
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:31.700]  in the courtroom, I remember covering it on air when he first went to prison 13 years ago,
[01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:37.700]  you know, you were told don't sell this book anymore. You were told don't give speeches anymore.
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:42.340]  So I'm going to send you to prison for the maximum sentence. So he admittedly sent him to
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:48.420]  prison and then killed him in prison. As you said, Ron Paul, you're a medical doctor speaking to this
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:54.420]  for his speech. And that's where America has gotten to where I've now had feds contact me
[01:14:54.420 --> 01:15:00.180]  multiple feds and tell me that the word is I shut up or they're going to set me up. And that's
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:08.420]  where this country's come to. And it's very, very sad. Specifically, though, solutions. What do we
[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:15.380]  do, sir, in the face of this? If they do try to declare some civil emergency, if there's some
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:21.300]  false flags like OKC blamed on patriots, we're trying to fix this peacefully. And I think we're
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:26.020]  winning peacefully as well. They're escalating. But what do we do if they start World War Three
[01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:30.580]  with the Russians? What do we do if they start federalizing the state houses that we know the
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:36.420]  Defense Department's been tasked to prepare to do? What do we do when truth becomes stranger
[01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:45.220]  than fiction and they become nakedly tyrannical against us? Well, when it's when it's domestic
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:53.940]  and they are at us all the time, I don't advocate violence, a matter of fact, for moral reasons.
[01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:59.620]  But for practical reasons, they have way more guns than we have. But I also know that truth can win
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:05.220]  out in the end. So it's getting the message out, whether it's your program or what I do and others,
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:11.620]  there's more now than ever before. So I think the most important regulation or law that we have to
[01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:21.460]  protect is our right to use the internet and do our programming. And this is being systematically
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:26.020]  attacked. It's being attacked not only by our own governments and sometimes corporate interests,
[01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:31.220]  who knows, but sometimes it's international. But if we lose that, that's going to be very bad. I
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:36.580]  happen to be optimistic about that, although I'm not technically astute to how it works.
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:43.940]  But I think we'll get around it. I think the internet's too big. So education is it to expose
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:49.940]  and counteract the propaganda. Almost always the people don't want war, then they get talked into
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:53.460]  it because they're told that you were going to be attacked. And if you don't support us,
[01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:59.140]  you're unpatriotic and you're un-American. But just think of on the issue of Syria right now,
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:04.180]  they changed the prime minister in Canada because Canada got too cozy with sending
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:08.660]  planes over there and fighting and participating in our foreign policy. In the same way, when
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:14.340]  the American people spoke out a couple of years ago when Obama wanted to bomb Syria,
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:19.780]  the people said no. But Obama, of course, went ahead and did it anyway. And the British people
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:24.980]  spoke out, which was a very historic event a couple of years ago and voted against giving the
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:30.900]  authority to their prime minister to go ahead. So the people are with us. Our job is to reach
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:36.180]  these people. And of course, this is where I do become a bit optimistic about what's happening
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:40.100]  because I think the young people realize that we're in an economic crisis.
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:47.140]  I think they know there's something very suspicious going on with our foreign policy
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:51.380]  as well as the Federal Reserve and the financing and they like personal liberty and they like the
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:58.900]  internet. And I just think the answers that we can find in a free society and sound money
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:04.580]  is so great. And all we have to do is get enough believers and the government will change. The
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:09.380]  government is a reflection of the people's attitude. Right now, the attitude is still. A lot of people
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:14.340]  are getting welfare. A lot of people are talked into supporting the military industrial complex.
[01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:20.180]  But we're running out of money and this is good because what are they going to do? They have
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:24.820]  to change their mind. As long as they think there's a handout, whether it's the rich or the poor,
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:28.420]  they're going to keep doing that and they're going to keep milking the middle class. And the
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:34.340]  middle classes keep shrinking and shrinking. So we are winning this for practical reasons,
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:39.220]  but we still have a long way to go and it's education, it's learning to have and get people
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:45.620]  to have confidence that free society is not only a better society, it's more peaceful and
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:51.140]  there's more prosperity. And that is what people have to vote for. Even if there's a point of
[01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:56.420]  resistance, I said I'm against the use of violence to counteract the government. I'm not opposed to
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:19:00.900]  people just going on strike and saying, look, I've had enough of this. I'm not going to participate.
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:06.180]  But that's rough too because you have to suffer the consequence of this. And that is peaceful
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:11.940]  resistance. And I'm not even sure where I would come down on that under certain circumstances.
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:18.420]  But that's ultimately the way laws get changed is a resistant movement supported by the people.
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:22.900]  And our Congress on occasion will respond when they know there's enough Americans who said
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:27.380]  enough is enough. Of course, that's what the battle is right now in Washington is there's
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:31.540]  a outcry from the people about Washington and still they don't know how to handle it and
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:36.100]  they won't change their tune. And it's by Republican and Democratic leaders. And yet
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:41.460]  there's a core of people now in Washington. They said enough is enough. I totally agree with you.
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:46.260]  And we're reaching that historic crossroads right now where the social engineers admit
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:50.900]  they're losing the hearts and minds. They're trying to accelerate their program. And they're
[01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:57.940]  looking for that line in the sand to push us so hard. We start getting violent. I agree violence
[01:19:57.940 --> 01:20:03.380]  is not the answer offensively. Obviously, defensively, we have a right to protect ourselves.
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:08.020]  But the good news is I talked to a lot of government people and others, they're awake to what's
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:14.100]  happening. What do you think the establishment is going to do to try to use the crisis? They've
[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:20.020]  helped exacerbate to even bring in more tyranny because you've always talked about this key time
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:26.420]  coming. When big government implodes, their answer will be more government. What do we do
[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:29.700]  at this key juncture to make sure people understand the truth?
[01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:38.580]  Well, it is still back to education and the various methods of doing that. But if it comes,
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:42.500]  if push comes to shove and there's violence in the street, they're going to look for a strong man.
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:47.220]  They're going to look for somebody who's authoritarian and said, well, the violence in the
[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:52.340]  cities won't last. And then people will say, yeah, that's right. We can't have anarchy,
[01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:59.540]  and they'll capitulate. But they will come. And the gun control issue is alive and well.
[01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:04.980]  And I'm for gun control. I'm for taking the guns away from the bureaucrats, the government,
[01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:09.940]  and taking the guns or restricting the gun use and President is starting wars. But no,
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:15.620]  they will come. And that will be if there is a confiscation or more registration,
[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:20.180]  people are going to have to make up the mind whether they're going to not participate in that.
[01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:25.140]  Same way with gold. Gold, the guns protect us physically and gold is real money. So when they
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:30.260]  destroy money, gold has always been the haven. It's not something I've invented or you invented.
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:35.860]  It's been around for 6000 years where real money is gold. And even though Bernanke told me gold,
[01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:40.660]  sorry, Ron, gold is no longer money. Gold is still money. So what are you going to do? Are you
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:45.700]  going to say, you know, are we going to be complacent like we were the American people were in the
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:50.820]  1930s? Roosevelt comes in and say, all right, we got to take over, turn in all your gold at
[01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:56.500]  $20 an ounce. And, and look at what that did. It took us a lot of years to get the right to own
[01:21:56.500 --> 01:22:02.660]  gold again. So they may not come and try to collect the gold. But I think what they'll try to do is
[01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:08.740]  tax the gold. Just remember the first attack on trying to regulate drugs was to put a huge tax
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:15.780]  on marijuana and that morphed into this horrendous drug war that's going on, which is such an excuse
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:21.140]  for the violation of our liberties along with the excuse, we got to click, click taxes because
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:27.380]  you're un-American if you don't pay your fair share. And that's why the tax authorities get out
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:33.540]  of hand. And of course, we probably don't have much time left. But Lewis Lerner is a typical example
[01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:38.980]  of how they use a tax laws and to punish those of us who are speaking out. That is a typical
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:44.420]  example of curtailing free speech. At least she was caught and she's out of it. But that attitude
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:49.460]  still remains. It certainly does. In the few minutes we've got left, looking at this election,
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:56.100]  looking at Rand Paul, looking at how he's really the only candidate that isn't for expanding the
[01:22:56.100 --> 01:23:08.580]  war in Syria. What is your view on the Russian entry into Syria? Well, I look at it in a practical
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:12.980]  way. I look first at what our policy should be. We shouldn't have been in there and we should
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:18.020]  leave and then that leaves it up to the neighborhood to take care of it. We're in 152 countries and
[01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:23.620]  if we're saying, okay, we got to watch out, we got to be terrified and we have to do anything we can
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:30.180]  to stop the Russians exerting their program, which is next to their border, whether it's
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:38.100]  whether it's Ukraine or whether it's Syria. They have a treaty with one country, with one base.
[01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:43.300]  And I think they have one aircraft carrier. So they want to keep that base. So I would say
[01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:48.260]  that's more their business. And I sort of get in charge out of the fact that Kerry says,
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:52.740]  oh, those Russians are not too smart. They're going to get bogged down in Syria.
[01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:57.300]  Well, maybe so if they do, maybe it'll be like Afghanistan. But why should we why should we
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:02.340]  block ourselves now? How could how could it be any worse than what we're doing to ourselves?
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:11.220]  So I would let I would let Russia and the Turks and, you know, the Kurds and these other people
[01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:17.140]  be involved and take care of it. And maybe if we withdrew some of our financial and military
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:21.940]  support over there, maybe Saudi Arabia wouldn't be so aggressive. Maybe they'd have to deal with
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:28.740]  the Yemen with Yemen all by themselves. So that whole area would become more peaceful and they
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:35.300]  would work out more work on things much more peacefully. But I don't think that if we if we
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:42.020]  compare Russia exerting themselves to protect one naval base outside their country, compared to us
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:49.300]  being in 152 countries and being assuming the role of total policemen of the world, no comparison.
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:54.740]  Ron Paul Liberty Report.com. One final question on the election. Obviously, I'm supporting
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:25:01.060]  Rand Paul because I know he's followed the Constitution. He won't flip flop like the other
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:06.340]  candidates. Obviously, I like a lot of what Donald Trump has to say. It's very populist. It's very
[01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:10.820]  constitutional in some cases, but he said things about, you know, loving Hillary in the past and
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:15.300]  being four assault weapons man. So I don't really trust him in the final equation. But
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:20.980]  but what is your view of Donald Trump overall? Do you think he's healthy for the campaign,
[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:23.060]  healthy for the debate, or do you think he's unhealthy?
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:31.620]  Well, if there was an absolute guarantee that the American people wouldn't be sucked in and
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:36.580]  making president, you know, it'd be just entertainment and he would and we would look at the
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:40.260]  like you point out some good things, some bad things. You could look at the good things and say,
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:46.900]  you know, he can do things and get away with with which many of us never could do. But he's a
[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:52.820]  powerful personality and he he makes fun of the political process and Republican and Democratic
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:26:01.300]  Party. At the same time, he doesn't get pushed around with the media. But I think I think trouble
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:09.300]  is coming. And he would have to live up to his word. I will take charge. I will get things done.
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:14.180]  I know what's good. I'm not looking for that. That to me is exactly the opposite of a libertarian
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:19.140]  society. I don't want to tell people what to do. I don't want to run the economy. I don't want to
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:24.180]  tell the world what to do. I want to deliver the liberty back to the individual, let the individual
[01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:28.980]  and local people take care of these problems. But I don't think I don't think Donald Trump would
[01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:34.820]  respond to that as the conditions break down. I think he he would use the not only the bully
[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:42.180]  pulpit, I think he'd become a very tough bully to take over just the whole situation.
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:47.140]  He does look ready to get on a big wide horse. And that is exactly what this country doesn't need.
[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:53.620]  And I think people's support for him shows the backlash against teleprompter politics. And I
[01:26:53.620 --> 01:26:58.820]  think that's that's the real issue there. Former Congressman Ron Paul, thank you so much for the
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:06.660]  time. And just please continue your great work. Thank you very much. You better take care of
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:13.220]  there goes. Former Congressman Ron Paul about a second delay there on the feed. We again,
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:19.780]  really appreciate the work he's done and the work you've done supporting him. He ran for office three
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:28.340]  times and failed all three but succeeded in becoming a focal point to help build a liberty movement
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:32.340]  to challenge the globalist. And that's the real value of what's happened.
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:39.540]  Rand Paul isn't perfect. I'm not perfect. Nobody's perfect. But we do want to restore this republic.
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:44.820]  And people want confidence. They want to hear somebody that tells it like it is.
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:49.060]  And I hope that Donald Trump is for real.
[01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:58.660]  But I know one thing's for sure. This is not a boring time to be alive. We've got front row
[01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:08.500]  seats now going into the future. And we're going to see exactly what is going to happen. We will
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:14.740]  find out. And of course, I make that statement about front row seats for a reason. We become a
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:21.700]  nation and a world of spectators. And people need to do a little less spectating and a little
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:30.580]  more action. It really frightens me in a good way, in a humbling way. When I realize this radio
[01:28:30.580 --> 01:28:37.860]  slash TV show has the power to change legislation, to put issues out there, to sometimes win debates,
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:42.500]  to sometimes change history, it makes me sit back in front of this chair and the ominous
[01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:49.060]  responsibility knowing I reach tens of millions of people a week. And I just think to myself,
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:52.420]  you know, you better do a good job, buddy, because this is for all the marbles.
[01:28:53.060 --> 01:28:59.940]  And then I think about the arrogant establishment types who just want the power of being famous
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:06.900]  and just want the money and are just puppets who let their teleprompters be loaded full of
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:13.940]  disinformation, who go out there with their polished talking points and regurgitate them over and over
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:21.380]  again onto the faces and heads of the American people. And all the numbers show that program of
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:27.220]  regurgitation is causing a massive backlash. I haven't gotten to James Woods countering Bernie
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:33.380]  Sanders and his tweets. Bernie Sanders endorsed communist China and how great they treat women.
[01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:40.820]  I'm not kidding. And he said they have such great infant care and great family leave.
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:45.940]  It's like endorsing British health care, UK health care, national health service and saying we need
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:52.980]  that here to Americans have never been over there under it. The empires on the run. Alex Jones and
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:30:03.060]  the GCN radio network. A US high school student has reportedly hacked the personal AOL account
[01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:09.140]  of CIA director John Brennan. According to the hacker, everything from a 47 page application
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:14.500]  for top secret security clearance to details of the agency's harsh interrogation techniques
[01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:20.180]  were discovered in the breach, notes the New York Post. The October 12 intrusion began after the
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:25.620]  hacker was able to trick workers at Verizon into providing Brennan's personal information and
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:30.980]  duping AOL into resetting his password. Law enforcement sources speaking with the post
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:36.100]  were shocked at the hackers actions, noting that the agency would undoubtedly make an example
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:40.980]  of the hackers if possible. We've previously seen the CIA brag about how they're collecting
[01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:45.540]  your information, going as far as saying they could spy on you through your dishwasher.

[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:27.540]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:59.940]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central standard time, we're here live broadcasting
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:10.580]  worldwide. We just had former Congressman Ron Paul on agreeing that political persecution
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:18.980]  is accelerating and is expanding in this country but that overall we are winning.
[01:34:20.980 --> 01:34:25.460]  And that's the good news but that's why they're trying to come in and censor us
[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:37.300]  because they know we're having an effect. I'm going to cover a wide spectrum of news here
[01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:42.100]  in a moment and then I'm going to open the phones up again for first-time callers specifically
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:47.460]  if you have any comments about some of the amazing things Ron Paul said. It gives me a headache to
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:54.100]  actually sit back and try to think of all the interesting news making statements that Ron
[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:59.060]  Paul made and I should have written notes down while he was on because if I don't then I won't
[01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:04.500]  get any articles out or videos out that really have the headline in them to help make sure that
[01:35:04.500 --> 01:35:09.860]  information goes viral because it's not just that we're covering key information here it's that if
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:18.820]  we don't present it with a lot of fanfare it'll be lost like pearls before swine and I'm not talking
[01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:25.620]  about you the swine my friends you are the pearls getting the information out of the public but if
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:35.140]  it's not packaged for our poor scene brethren they won't even take a second look at it.
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:44.100]  So how you package the information is half the battle because what we cover here is so sensational
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:52.420]  if we don't put it out in a sensational fashion it falls on deaf ears. So many times Drudge has
[01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:56.260]  pointed out in articles and tweets he's put out and also here on the show
[01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:03.300]  that people ought to take themselves seriously that write for info wars you ought to take
[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:08.180]  yourself seriously if you write for a little blog you ought to take yourself seriously if you go out
[01:36:08.180 --> 01:36:12.340]  and shoot news videos for a youtube channel because you're just as important as some new
[01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:17.700]  york times writer your perspective your view I can never understand when I would go out and cover
[01:36:17.700 --> 01:36:23.220]  a press event the arrogance of abc news reporters the arrogance of new york times reporters
[01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:28.020]  and they couldn't ever believe that I didn't care about being on their shows
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:33.940]  what are you doing here setting up a camera what do you want to try to get on our show
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:39.300]  I'm like what you gonna go live I might bullhorn it yeah no I don't want to be interviewed by you
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:46.020]  I don't care we get media requests now less and less you should be like every day come on
[01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:51.780]  nightline come on this come on that come on good morning America and they would email back or call
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:37:00.900]  back and say you really don't want to come on and I'd be like in the past let me guess you want to
[01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:07.300]  tape something today and have it in the morning right well yeah how'd you know that well you're
[01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:11.140]  a live show aren't you this is like five years ago I would still have these conversations
[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:19.700]  yes we are let me guess the anti-gunners are going to be live well yeah they are going to be
[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:25.060]  live because see the person calling me up wasn't part of making real decisions nine times out of ten
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:32.260]  and I'd say do you ever think why the opposition is going to be live and I'm going to be taped
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:37.140]  because you're going to take all my good points out let them know what my points were before
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:43.780]  just try to destroy my points and give them double the time so guess what find somebody else to do it
[01:37:43.780 --> 01:37:47.300]  I'm not going to get in the arena with you with my arms tied behind my back okay
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:53.300]  all right but we reached like 10 million people in the morning good for you
[01:37:57.380 --> 01:38:01.860]  I'm going to reach people with straight up information and we'll see who ends up
[01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:08.420]  reaching the most people on the end and now those shows have like five million viewers they have like
[01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:18.020]  30 million viewers 20 years ago per morning show ABC NBC CBS they're already dead they're already over
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:24.900]  it's already a joke and so I guess drudge is right when he says why are we on Facebook why are we on
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:31.940]  Twitter why are we on YouTube we need to not even give any energy to those platforms and until
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:37.540]  recently I couldn't do that because I couldn't pay for the bandwidth of having you know three four
[01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:47.780]  five million video views a day and I guess I really still can't pay for it but we are rapidly
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:52.740]  approaching a point where bandwidth will be so inexpensive unless they screw the internet up
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:39:00.980]  with all these treaties like TPP that we will be able to have our own video platform that's free
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:06.500]  to the public and not subscription and that leads me to the next point a plug I never promote
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:14.820]  prisonplanet.tv I really should cut a new radio ad for it it's been around 14 years and it's had
[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:18.340]  some bumps over the years it runs really well now I want to thank all of you that have been with us
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:24.820]  for the long haul and it's subscription 20 people can use it with each membership it's 5.95 a month
[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:28.580]  that just pays for the bandwidth and your memberships
[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:36.580]  help then pay for us to then be able to put out videos for free and have free video feeds for
[01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:41.540]  the general radio audience and reach new people and that's what it's going to take to defeat the
[01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:49.220]  globalist you know ABC NBC you name it have been losing money forever but their umbrella companies
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:54.180]  finance the subsidiaries at a loss
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:40:04.820]  because it's a propaganda fee to get their trillions and no bid weapons contracts in the
[01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:09.780]  next decade to get their trillions in drug sales that are totally you know bad for you
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:16.660]  to get their police state agenda through to continue they've got to pay to engage in brainwashing
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:24.260]  so it doesn't matter that they're losing money because in their other interest they are making
[01:40:24.260 --> 01:40:30.180]  money hand over fist and more importantly consolidating markets because money is just an
[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:38.660]  ends is a means an ends to justify a means they want money to dominate markets and shut down
[01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:47.300]  their competition and take over but what does matter the fact that they're losing money that's
[01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:56.420]  just an embarrassment to them what really hurts them is their audiences shrinking at an accelerated
[01:40:56.420 --> 01:41:08.260]  pace until all they are like MSNBC and CNN have now reached this point and Rolling Stone magazine
[01:41:08.260 --> 01:41:14.500]  you name it not singling them out as just an example they have reached the point of being
[01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:19.620]  literal not veritable but literal facades
[01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:27.060]  like the front of the house in Hollywood but there's nothing behind it looks like an old western
[01:41:27.060 --> 01:41:33.220]  town but there's nothing through the door you step through the door and they are you know storing
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:47.140]  more theater apparatuses it is a facade and they're just there to keep up appearances and
[01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:55.060]  to keep milking advertisement agencies and sponsors who don't know that the heart already stopped
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:42:03.940]  and so it is really important to understand we are at that crossroads as Ron Paul said just 20
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:11.860]  minutes ago things are accelerating the future of the world is being decided right now and every
[01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:17.620]  bit of energy you put towards resisting the globalist is going to come back tenfold to you
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:25.700]  in my view historically right now is the time to be putting in the maximum effort
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:34.500]  where we've got one yard to go we're in the last two minutes of the game we can get the first
[01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:40.820]  down to use a football analogy and then move us 20 more yards into the end zone we can get there
[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:44.340]  but we got to get this first down right now and then we can keep moving the ball
[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:52.740]  into the end zone that's how close this game is ladies and gentlemen with two minutes left
[01:42:53.780 --> 01:43:00.020]  if we get the first down if we maintain possession if we move into the end zone the other side is
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:08.660]  not even going to have time for a reception of the kickoff and a chance to run it down the field
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:14.980]  they're going to lose but it doesn't mean we're in the cat bird seat if we keep making wrong moves
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:21.060]  if we don't realize how serious a time this is we will lose everything they're coming for your
[01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:25.780]  children they're coming for your guns they're coming for your health they're coming with forced
[01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:30.660]  inoculations they're coming with world government they're coming with secret treaties it's all
[01:43:30.660 --> 01:43:40.020]  admitted now there's no more room there's no more chance there's no more time for denials
[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:44.180]  while they were building the world government they denied it existed
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:48.020]  now that it's out in the open
[01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:57.380]  are you going to just acquiesce and go along with it and believe me you don't have to save the
[01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:02.340]  world by yourself you vote with your dollars you vote with your mouth you vote with your feet
[01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:09.060]  you vote with your prayers you vote with your actions the globalists are dead meat all of their
[01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:16.340]  top corporations are in deep trouble except for Goldman Sachs at the very top and JP Morgan
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:22.500]  and they're in a consolidation phase remember the head of JP Morgan and an internal email
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:28.900]  to their hundreds of executives a few months ago said we have reached the final phase
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:37.140]  this is going to be you know absolutely insane we are in fortress mode we are set to make it
[01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:42.660]  through this and then dominate on the other side this will be our greatest triumph i'm paraphrasing
[01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:54.580]  the email you can read it for yourself just type in JP Morgan's email on the future info wars.com
[01:44:54.580 --> 01:45:02.580]  it'll come up for you because this is it and those few globalist corporations and groups and families
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:07.700]  that can make it through this global meltdown and be on the other side with all their unlimited cash
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:16.260]  and their central banks power to issue currency to them this is the true takeover world governments
[01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:22.580]  about getting the laws and regulations in place to take your farm take your ranch take your house
[01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:28.900]  conscript your children arrest you for environmental crimes and infractions that are going to make the
[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:37.300]  drug war look like a walk in the park it is the setup for the next big phase rollout of
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:50.340]  totalitarianism toll free number to join us 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 a few years ago they had
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:56.900]  months of really bad fires east of austin and west of austin all around austin
[01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:03.860]  toward no matter where you lived ash would rain down your car like you lived in LA or something
[01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:10.180]  in the summer it's very daunteish very daunte's inferno
[01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:19.220]  and i liken it to being somebody in a neighborhood when the winds would kick up
[01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:23.380]  it would suddenly go from just eating a few acres an hour to eating hundreds of acres every few minutes
[01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:28.900]  and the fire departments would pull up to people's houses and say get out
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:35.060]  you know basically follow us to the evacuation route and some people wouldn't leave and would
[01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:41.700]  be burned up in their homes you talk about being in denial i'm not here being a fearmonger when
[01:46:41.700 --> 01:46:50.660]  i tell you how serious the stakes are how high the stakes are i'm here trying to get people that
[01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:59.220] 'll listen to move into action against the new world order because running is not the solution in this
[01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:09.140]  fight running is like getting on your knees there's nowhere to run and if we would just
[01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:16.660]  identify the new world order and get aggressive with them and not be scared of them and realize
[01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:23.060]  that they've abused us they've persecuted us they've hurt us they don't have a hope of getting out of
[01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:29.620]  this they have been off way more than they can chew basically every operation they're running is
[01:47:29.620 --> 01:47:36.340]  stuck in the mud right now this is what always happens to tyrants they just hope they can reshuffle
[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:47.620]  politicians in europe and reshuffle politicians here and use political correctness intimidation
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:56.660]  to intimidate people into shutting up and they hope the leftover fumes of prosperity
[01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:05.300]  is enough for people to just sit complacent another year another decade until we wake up and
[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:14.740]  robots have replaced everything driving your cars construction manufacturing with no exit strategy
[01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:22.020]  for jobs for humans in the future so you're made dependent on the bureaucracy on the technocracy
[01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:29.300]  on the robots so that the terms of your human surrender to dehumanization
[01:48:29.300 --> 01:48:36.660]  can be laid out to you you will eat what we say you will sleep where we say you will live where

[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:27.700]  saying that china is good for infants rights or babies rights is like saying radical islam
[01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:34.980]  is good for women's rights it's like saying kryptonite is good for superman this is a guy
[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:38.900]  that runs around saying we need to get our free socialist healthcare like england with
[01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:44.020]  this nightmare national health service that has millions of brits a year traveling to the united
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:51.940]  states for basic healthcare medical terrorism and james woods man i wish i could get james woods on
[01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:58.740]  the show i was at a hollywood dinner one time with a bunch of folks that thought i was really great
[01:54:58.740 --> 01:55:03.380]  because i was exposing 9-11 a bunch of famous actors and i went do any of you guys know james
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:08.980]  woods i really like him in different movies i think he's a great actor and they all looked
[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:14.900]  at me like i had just said let's eat baby for dinner or something and just did not even respond to
[01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:24.900]  what i said but i tell you i would love to get james woods on the show hollywood actor democrat
[01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:31.220]  both destroy bernie sanders for praising communist china china has notoriously killed female infants
[01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:38.420]  for population control you utter more on james woods tells sanders after bernie sanders praised
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:43.460]  china for providing 14 weeks of taxpayer paid maternity leave both yeah and they come into
[01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:48.260]  medical exams to kill the baby if it's a girl both hollywood actor james woods and democratic
[01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:53.620]  pundit christin powers pointed out the communist regime also kills infants for population control
[01:55:54.660 --> 01:55:59.460]  well you won't be getting any disney jobs now because if you criticize communist chinese in any
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:04.020]  way disney will blackball you this is how totalitarianism works
[01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:16.420]  and he goes on uh them tweeting at senator sanders at sin sanders except for babies they
[01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:25.140]  force women to abort senator totally and completely seconding and look sanders isn't stupid he knows
[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:34.020]  what he's doing when he gets up and goes cuba has a very nice system we need one like it you deserve
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:45.860]  something free and uh all my people have too much money we need to redistribute redistributed
[01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:54.900]  because communist systems were so well oh excuse me excuse me i'm not a communist even though i
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:57:01.780]  endorse them all these videos are coming out uh and then uh if it's all an act i don't call my hair
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:12.180]  i'm a democratic socialist which means we vote to take all your money away and then we collapse
[01:57:12.180 --> 01:57:16.180]  like uh vizuela i can't really do the best bernie sanders
[01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:22.820]  i mean he he criticizes the federal reserve on the surface till they're about to audit it then
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:27.860]  he's the deciding vote to kill the audit the senate failed by one vote thank you mr sanders
[01:57:29.220 --> 01:57:30.020]  colonel sanders
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:41.540]  what a disgusting human being praying on his moron constituency let me tell you
[01:57:41.540 --> 01:57:46.340]  there's only one group of constituents i've seen on c-span that looks more pathetic more weak more
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:53.220]  stupid i mean i'm sorry i'm not saying this to be mean i look into the eyes of hardcore democrat
[01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:58.500]  supporters and they look like people i know that are seriously brain damaged and can't talk they
[01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:05.380]  have that same look like they've been hit upside the head by a frying pan permanently and i actually
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:10.180]  feel sorry for them and then they've been conditioned just to giggle and say i'm an intellectual
[01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:14.500]  i'm an intellectual and giggle and walk away notice we always try to talk to democrats we go
[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:18.100]  talk to us about why you're for gun control i'm not going to talk to you then a handler comes over
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:24.740]  just don't talk they can't even talk and then their leader is some guy with his hair sticking out going
[01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:40.660]  meanwhile the big mega banks fund all the socialists to consolidate wealth and give chicken
[01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:45.860]  feed to the public to make them dependent dependent domesticated animals are dependent
[01:58:45.860 --> 01:58:51.220]  you are dependent you are dependent you are dependent many of the products and info wars life
[01:58:51.220 --> 01:58:56.500]  dot com are true game changers they are compounds that in many areas of the world are actually sold
[01:58:56.500 --> 01:59:01.700]  by prescription but when we look at a product like survival shield nasa and iodine x2 it's something
[01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:06.260]  that really has been hiding in plain view for over a hundred years the federal government mandated
[01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:11.540]  from the 20s until the 70s that iodine a crude form of it be added to table salt because of the
[01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:16.340]  incredible health problems that dietary deficiency and iodine was causing i want to challenge the
[01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:21.300]  listeners who've not tried x2 for yourselves what do you have to lose you are the tip of the spear
[01:59:21.300 --> 01:59:26.020]  in the fight for human liberty and you're getting a high quality product that has absolutely changed
[01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:30.900]  my life and many other people's lives that i know and the final reason to try x2 is that it's so hard
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:35.940]  to keep in stock we ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out
[01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:40.260]  it may be a month or two until more comes in i want to challenge all of you in the next week

[01:59:53.380 --> 02:00:11.940]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:27.860]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones

[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:46.100]  will continue calls then as well bill in california you're on the air go ahead
[02:00:47.460 --> 02:00:53.380]  alex yes sir i would just wanted to say before my Alzheimer's kicks in that i used to watch uh
[02:00:53.380 --> 02:01:00.180]  fox news and i sent several emails to uh bill ariley and uh asking him simple questions like
[02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:05.780]  can you discuss the globalist or the new world order things like that i never get a response
[02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:10.820]  never get anything he doesn't take a damn thing about it so now i'm i don't watch him anymore
[02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:17.140]  and i don't like what kelly did to uh trump the way she's just being on her high soap box but
[02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:22.100]  anyway i'm off of air i don't believe anything they say so i'm a convert and the other thing i
[02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:29.540]  wanted to say um is what concerns me about guns is the fact that uh i believe i if you think if
[02:01:29.540 --> 02:01:35.940]  anybody is watching these 1500 jihadists that obama brought into the country as to where they're
[02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:40.740]  going if they can buy guns if not are they going to be getting them and are they going to be working
[02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:45.780]  for femur who knows who's watching them and the rest of the migrants when they come in will they
[02:01:45.780 --> 02:01:52.500]  be able to buy guns how you know what i'm saying uh is there some underground and the third thing
[02:01:52.500 --> 02:01:57.460]  the FBI's come out said that that they're not allowed to track them the homeland security then
[02:01:57.460 --> 02:02:03.060]  lied and said oh of course we do but it's not 1500 that's the first wave they want hundreds of thousands
[02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:09.140]  admittedly to be brought in and then lapin again i already mentioned this but i want to cover it more
[02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:15.140]  she has been arrested brought into court for saying that we're being colonized and this is
[02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:20.420]  in the radical islamic invasion i mean you don't even have free speech in europe to point out what's
[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:27.220]  happening that's how sick and evil these governments are and they want to do that here and so i i'll be
[02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:32.900]  honest i heard all this islamophobia stuff and i thought it was exaggerated i thought it was you
[02:02:32.900 --> 02:02:37.540]  know over the top but i guess the globalists have done the demographics if they've got a
[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:42.660]  billion 200 million islamists so they can ship a few hundred million of them in here which they
[02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:46.820]  already got 40 million illegals here well the illegals don't want to destroy the country on
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:51.700]  average well if they bring in radical jihadis they do and they walk around with burning torches
[02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:56.660]  saying your women will wear hoods you will not drink beer or i will kill you and they go well
[02:02:56.660 --> 02:03:01.380]  that's their culture let them do it i mean in a certain point i'm fed up i'm not against muslims
[02:03:02.260 --> 02:03:06.660]  but but the muslims i see running around the street saying you'll do what i say you'll convert
[02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:14.500]  and all this well i'm not converting to anybody uh under orders and so the left now is using radical
[02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:20.660]  muslims as their bully and the radical muslims just sit there licking their feet but only so long
[02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:25.220]  because they will bite the hand that feeds them and i'm just sick of it what about you i mean
[02:03:25.220 --> 02:03:31.780]  this is getting crazy where migrants are given four-star hotels in germany where people are
[02:03:31.780 --> 02:03:36.900]  being arrested for criticizing open borders uh where they're saying you're teaching elementary
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:42.340]  students saying boy or girl is sexist calling them to the principal's office i mean this is a total
[02:03:42.340 --> 02:03:49.540]  cult of brainwashing well i believe the same thing and i've just to interject my i have a son-in-law
[02:03:49.540 --> 02:03:55.220]  who is a police officer up here and uh so he's he goes to different trainings that are put on by
[02:03:55.220 --> 02:04:00.740]  the fbi and he said they're pretty much a joke they'll go to a mall and do a mock uh mall invasion
[02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:06.260]  or something like that and then uh let's see the other thing i wanted to say was uh
[02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:13.140]  are people aware i don't know if this is old or redundant but uh that the bushes have bought 200
[02:04:13.140 --> 02:04:18.180]  thousand acres in paraguay it's been a couple years ago they have their own port they have their
[02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:25.700]  own military and it's it's a fact from what i know no that's true and reportedly ken lay staged his
[02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:32.020]  death and he's down there serious news media has seen him down there ken lay just lives there if uh
[02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:37.620]  i was just going to say a key indicator of when the uh wasn't going to hit the fan is when people
[02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:43.860]  if they ever see the change in the bushes head out and they're not around it's it's right it's not
[02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:48.260]  just the bushes that bought that 200 000 acres all these other globalists bought a bunch of land
[02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:54.980]  there around them as well but the the bushes got a lot of the german wealth after world war two
[02:04:54.980 --> 02:05:02.340]  kraskat was the head nazi lawyer they're super rich it was 30 years ago in 1985 that doc and marty
[02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:09.700]  went back another 30 years to 1955 then they went back to the future to today we're going we don't
[02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:16.500]  need roads well there's no flying cars and it isn't the roads they say we don't need they tell us
[02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:21.540]  where we're going there won't be any drivers and there's no hoverboard or self-lacing shoes but at
[02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:29.140]  least we're not plagued with fax machines you may just need a lightning strike for power says obama
[02:05:29.140 --> 02:05:36.740]  and the epa are trying to shut down most of the power plants but the movie's future resembles the

[02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:03.940]  the political correctness is only going to get that much worse
[02:09:06.980 --> 02:09:12.340]  meanwhile in the united kingdom they caught the government spying on politicians spying
[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:17.940]  on movie stars spying on the general public spying on the press and so the government's
[02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:24.420]  answer was to just legalize what was already illegal here it is out of the daily mail security
[02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:30.020]  services given new rights to spy on your phones and computers dizzying range of electronic

[02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:45.620]  now i'm going to be available meanwhile migration group headed up by the un and peter southerland
[02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:51.940]  says the world must be ready for more diversity and diversity means
[02:09:53.620 --> 02:09:57.940]  five million ten million people come into your small country 50 million come into your big country
[02:09:58.580 --> 02:09:59.940]  and then they get everything free
[02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:07.380]  they get filled full of entitlement if they want it for free others don't want it for free and go
[02:10:07.380 --> 02:10:14.260]  work and they're turned into basically a new political underclass that gets to vote isn't that
[02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:21.700]  just cute and that ties into marie lapin stands for trial for muslim street prayer outburst they
[02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:27.300]  call it an outburst that she gave a speech saying this is the beginning of an occupation and quoted
[02:10:27.300 --> 02:10:38.500]  imams saying they were colonizing france she compared the occupation to the nazi occupation of
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:44.740]  france and the people working with the radical islamists is taking over as the equivalent to
[02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:50.420]  vc french who opened the door for hitler france just stood down folks and that's what's happening
[02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:57.220]  under globalism you don't stand down to hitler you stand down to globalism and all that it
[02:10:57.220 --> 02:11:03.300]  brings horror as christian migrant brutally beaten with baton and refugee camp on video
[02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:11.540]  well it is true that the folks aren't too tolerant of christians but that's okay because
[02:11:11.540 --> 02:11:16.260]  christians aren't a politically correct protected group they're not as sexy and
[02:11:16.260 --> 02:11:20.420]  cool as you know the folks that rock the casbah
[02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:27.860]  law meanwhile mystery deaths in scarily on africa spread fear of Ebola relapses
[02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:32.900]  roiders and a nurse that had been clear of Ebola for six months came back down with it
[02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:36.900]  and we've always known some people continue to be carriers folks there's been Ebola all over the
[02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:44.420]  world there's been a cover-up of Ebola that's some of the news on that front uh what about
[02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:49.780]  these little juicy headlines uh oh look they told me an hour ago that biden was giving a speech
[02:11:49.780 --> 02:11:53.140]  that he was stepping down i've got the reasons for it right here in front of me
[02:11:53.140 --> 02:12:00.740]  in fact i meant to print that guys you bring me biden statement and thanks i forgot to ask for that
[02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:09.700]  this means that hillary who gets what was the headline i saw double the corporate
[02:12:09.700 --> 02:12:14.020]  contributions of all other candidates combined not just democrats
[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:20.740]  because the feds don't know who to bet on the globalists don't know who to bet on right now
[02:12:20.740 --> 02:12:24.740]  they don't want to give ronald trump money they think jeb's gonna lose now they were giving him
[02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:32.820]  a lot of money and so hillary gets more money than everybody else combined and then some showing that
[02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:42.820]  she's the one and that if they didn't run biden that means that the establishment is bowing
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:47.300]  and kneeling to her meanwhile they want to cover their bases and make sure they've got republicans
[02:12:47.300 --> 02:12:56.420]  that are going to work with them representative ryan seeks unity from house do p to run for
[02:12:56.420 --> 02:13:04.020]  speaker you got to love though getting back to this how hillary is the outsider candidate
[02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:08.740]  and is against the banker bailouts and is against the the dollar devaluation when she's one of the
[02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:16.260]  main authors of it back under clinton one and clinton two you now had obama it's like clinton three
[02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:22.740]  and four she's not they want clinton five and six and she just sits up there to her moron
[02:13:22.740 --> 02:13:29.300]  constituents i mean these are real morons she supported torture the patriot act the ndaa fast
[02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:35.940]  and furious radicalizing the jihad he's turning them loose i mean you talk about evil lied about
[02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:42.020]  being in a firefight and being shot at in holes in the plane in syria none of it was true ryan
[02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:48.340]  williams has to step down in disgrace not hillary because she's a woman and i'm not criticizing her
[02:13:48.340 --> 02:13:54.900]  because she wants my guns or is a big fat liar or has had me persecuted before now i'm doing it
[02:13:54.900 --> 02:14:00.500]  because i don't want a woman over me they'll probably have a salon headline jones admits it's
[02:14:00.500 --> 02:14:05.460]  because she's a woman no it's called satire idiots when you're not writing articles about how great
[02:14:05.460 --> 02:14:11.540]  pedophilia is or how ought to be killed and people say they do it to be sensational no they don't
[02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:19.300]  this is who they are turned over to evil they mean business we mean business too
[02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:27.460]  quote john wane fill your hand i love how these chicken necks try to intimidate people
[02:14:27.460 --> 02:14:37.220]  no there's a quote a good quote from the movie elysium
[02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:41.700]  where she says where the head dictator says you're lucky i'm here or you'd be hung
[02:14:45.140 --> 02:14:53.940]  and he goes hanging we do the hanging around here go ahead take our restrain his witness
[02:14:53.940 --> 02:15:03.300]  and fill your stinky little hands because we do the hanging around here just find out go ahead
[02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:12.980]  keep pushing representative ryan seeks unity from house gop to run for speaker
[02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:22.580]  in that nice unity oh the republicans are in shambles let's say get behind poll ryan who wants
[02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:27.460]  open borders gun control everything else in the past but now he doesn't want that it's everything's
[02:15:27.460 --> 02:15:34.820]  okay and then we have the CNN headline poll ryan's new partner obama they're supporting putting
[02:15:34.820 --> 02:15:42.420]  poll ryan in conservative activists are targeting poll ryan national review reports but don't worry
[02:15:42.420 --> 02:15:48.420]  political reports on harry reid offers surprise support for ryan a speaker and of course they
[02:15:48.420 --> 02:15:52.740]  oh that doesn't matter he's in the senate polosi says they've got him the vote so the democrats
[02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:58.820]  will put him in with the republicans and whoever votes for ryan as a republican get him out of office
[02:16:01.460 --> 02:16:06.260]  ryan's also come out against thomas jefferson you can't make that up now that's in the washington
[02:16:06.260 --> 02:16:14.500]  times he's a perfect candidate isn't he joe biden of course has stepped down
[02:16:14.500 --> 02:16:20.260]  him joe biden won't run for president but he says he will not be silent
[02:16:24.900 --> 02:16:29.140]  we'll cover more of that dribble later of course joe biden also told us that he would not
[02:16:29.140 --> 02:16:39.140]  be coming after any of our firearms none of them total lie okay i am very very pleased
[02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:48.980]  i just had my bio here for my guest and now i don't here it is i'm very very pleased to have
[02:16:48.980 --> 02:16:53.860]  the author of the economic collapse blog we carry this stuff every day his prolific writer really
[02:16:53.860 --> 02:17:00.900]  great research just links to what he's saying and he joins us he's the author of two books the
[02:17:00.900 --> 02:17:06.260]  beginning of the end and the and get prepared now look i i wish there wasn't a quote end coming
[02:17:06.260 --> 02:17:10.180]  they have a designed implosion that they want to then bring in their world government on top of
[02:17:10.740 --> 02:17:13.540]  but even though it's called the economic collapse blog he reports on a lot of other
[02:17:13.540 --> 02:17:19.140]  geopolitical activities and developments here some of his latest articles america looks a lot
[02:17:19.140 --> 02:17:25.140]  like nazi germany did just prior to world war two a lot of economists are saying that and a lot of
[02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:32.420]  historians as well goodbye middle class 51 of all american workers make less than 30 000 a year

[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:44.580]  deepens that was yesterday previous world war three russia is putting on a display of firepower
[02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:49.460]  that is shocking the world that's all coming up but let me just ask michael snider he'll be with us

[02:18:20.020 --> 02:18:25.780]  gone completely insane i think the elite aren't going completely insane we're i think we're right
[02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:32.500]  right now we're seeing this huge push toward a global government a global economy and a
[02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:37.540]  global religion for example what just happened at the end of september with these new global
[02:18:37.540 --> 02:18:43.460]  goals it was one of the biggest pushes and steps toward a global government we've ever seen and
[02:18:43.460 --> 02:18:48.900]  yet the alternative media is not really talking that much about it if you go on youtube you can
[02:18:48.900 --> 02:18:53.460]  pull up this video where some of the biggest celebrities in the entire world they're telling
[02:18:53.460 --> 02:18:58.420]  us we need to get behind these new global goals that the un just put out there you know they took
[02:18:58.420 --> 02:19:03.060]  agenda 21 which we've heard about for years and this is kind of the next generation there's these
[02:19:03.060 --> 02:19:09.140]  17 global goals that they're saying we have to get behind we have to support and when they launched
[02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:14.820]  this in september they did september 25th the pope traveled to new york city to give the address to
[02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:20.340]  kick off this conference where it was unveiled and virtually every single nation on the entire planet
[02:19:20.340 --> 02:19:27.860]  willingly signed up for these 17 global goals and then the next day is september 26th in central
[02:19:27.860 --> 02:19:33.940]  park in new york city they held what was called a global citizen festival where Beyonce and many

[02:19:39.540 --> 02:19:45.620]  they said we've got to get behind these global goals and essentially it's a template for a new

[02:24:37.540 --> 02:24:44.020]  predictions that came true which are welling in technologies was the movie right about we break
[02:24:44.020 --> 02:24:51.700]  it all down in the article put out by kit daniels and info wars dot com just about five minutes ago
[02:24:53.380 --> 02:24:58.980]  i want to get into these 17 you know global planks and the fact that suddenly world governments
[02:24:58.980 --> 02:25:05.540]  being openly announced uh with our guests michael schneider but first king paul i'm reading from drudge
[02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:14.260]  king paul pledge allegiance by friday he has an f rating from conservative grips of course
[02:25:14.260 --> 02:25:19.380]  he's being endorsed by obama and harry reid and people say and nancy polosi and people say well
[02:25:19.940 --> 02:25:26.580]  that'll hurt him no they're gonna vote for him they've got the democrats are all being told get
[02:25:26.580 --> 02:25:32.180]  ready to vote for paul ryan what does that tell you about the republican leadership
[02:25:32.180 --> 02:25:38.260]  i mean this is as big as the presidential election for me and schneider i want to get back in the
[02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:42.900]  global government why you think they're accelerating it right now what else you're looking at but what
[02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:48.420]  do you make of this speaker race i mean this is such a big thing paul ryan is so bad news
[02:25:48.980 --> 02:25:55.780]  we just had a decade of bainer i mean can't we just have some good decent second party
[02:25:55.780 --> 02:26:00.500]  in congress not one party isn't this getting obvious do you think they're really arrogant enough to
[02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:07.860]  install the democrat votes paul ryan it makes me so angry because we just saw the republican
[02:26:07.860 --> 02:26:12.340]  leadership pave the way for obama with this fast track negotiating authority for the
[02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:17.620]  trans pacific partnership which was a giant step toward integrating the global economy this
[02:26:17.620 --> 02:26:24.020]  trans pacific partnership is going to cover 40 percent of global gdp you know and and basically
[02:26:24.020 --> 02:26:29.060]  obama's putting all kinds of things in the street that he couldn't get through congress and any other
[02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:35.060]  way so what you know we've seen the republicans advance the obama agenda this way but but see
[02:26:35.060 --> 02:26:38.980]  you know the republican leadership in congress they're essentially just another plank of the
[02:26:38.980 --> 02:26:44.020]  democrats you know they don't want the true conservatives to take control no matter what
[02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:48.260]  and so they're willing to do anything the republicans and the democrats to keep them from from
[02:26:48.260 --> 02:26:53.860]  happening it makes me so angry because we don't have a choice one way or the other the agenda of
[02:26:53.860 --> 02:26:59.300]  the elite the the agenda of the globalist is going to advance and they don't give us any other options
[02:27:02.100 --> 02:27:05.700]  i asked this question of ron paul earlier i asked it of everybody and i want your take
[02:27:05.700 --> 02:27:09.460]  is i read your articles you're obviously a smart guy are they accelerating it because
[02:27:09.460 --> 02:27:15.060]  they're behind schedule or because they're ahead of schedule or because they're arrogant
[02:27:15.780 --> 02:27:20.820]  and you know why are they moving so quick when it's waking up so many people i mean
[02:27:20.820 --> 02:27:24.020]  why would hillary come out and say yeah we want to repeal the second amendment
[02:27:24.020 --> 02:27:28.340]  and have mass gun confiscation i mean they're really almost making us passay
[02:27:28.980 --> 02:27:32.500]  when the pope's calling for world government so so how do they have the southern poverty
[02:27:32.500 --> 02:27:39.220]  law center saying none of this is happening while their official mouthpieces openly announce and
[02:27:39.220 --> 02:27:45.540]  confirm everything we've said exploding our credibility are they exploding in a good way
[02:27:45.540 --> 02:27:52.100]  are they just that disconnected what's happening well i think they just have extreme amounts of
[02:27:52.100 --> 02:27:57.300]  arrogance they control the mainstream media that essentially more than 90 percent of everything
[02:27:57.300 --> 02:28:03.140]  we get through our television through the media is controlled by just six uh gigantic media
[02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:07.460]  corporations the washington post recently reported that the average american watches
[02:28:07.460 --> 02:28:18.100]  293 minutes of television a day now that's almost uh five hours of of that's of television a day
[02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:23.220]  and so like i said more than 90 percent of what's being fed into our minds this programming and
[02:28:23.220 --> 02:28:27.780]  they call programming for a reason and so they control what we think about what we talk about
[02:28:27.780 --> 02:28:32.740]  with our friends with our family at the water cooler it's a sporting event we just saw something
[02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:38.180]  on television and television show what we saw in the news and so they tell us what to think what to
[02:28:38.180 --> 02:28:43.380]  talk about with our family and friends and so they feel like they've got total control and what they
[02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:48.260]  like to do is they like to create a great crisis and so i believe that we are headed into a time of
[02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:53.540]  great economic crisis a global recession has already started and we can talk about those numbers
[02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:59.460]  and when they bring this moment of great crisis they use these crises to uh bring the problem
[02:28:59.460 --> 02:29:03.540]  then there's a reaction and then they bring the solution and so i think they're accelerating it
[02:29:03.540 --> 02:29:08.580]  and they're preparing us to go into this time of great crisis and every solution they're going
[02:29:08.580 --> 02:29:14.580]  to offer us is going to involve more centralization more globalization more militarization you know
[02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:19.700]  we just saw it you know the obama administration come out and say okay we're creating this brand
[02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:24.580]  new position is going to focus on domestic extremists of course it's not the communist
[02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:28.420]  it's not the leftist they're going to focus on they're going to focus on people like us people
[02:29:28.420 --> 02:29:33.780]  that watch your show people that come to my websites they're the people that they want to focus on
[02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:38.020]  absolutely stay there let's cover that when we come back and they admit i mean the supreme
[02:29:38.020 --> 02:29:42.500]  courts warning people and others they're coming for a free speech right now i mean this is their
[02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:49.460]  totalitarian move this is a full-on war folks are you going to join in on the fight we're on the march
[02:29:49.460 --> 02:29:58.900]  the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.500 --> 02:30:06.260]  the 21 gun salute a time-honored tradition that has been celebrating veterans for years
[02:30:06.900 --> 02:30:13.380]  is now banned by an iowa high school according to an nbc affiliate administrators at bell plane
[02:30:13.380 --> 02:30:18.980]  high school say that the salute quote promotes gun violence end quote but common sense hasn't
[02:30:18.980 --> 02:30:24.820]  completely left the area a member of the american legion a veterans organization offered up property
[02:30:24.820 --> 02:30:29.460]  near the school so the assembly could continue but the group is disappointed over the school's
[02:30:29.460 --> 02:30:34.900]  decision and fear it could reverberate to other parts of the state similar efforts to demonize
[02:30:34.900 --> 02:30:40.260]  firearms have already popped up in other schools across the country in other schools across the
[02:30:40.260 --> 02:30:47.140]  nation anti-gun hysteria has manifested in students being suspended or expelled for playing with toy
[02:30:47.140 --> 02:30:53.940]  guns fighting pastries into gun shapes and even making gun gestures with their hands you can find

[02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:16.500]  did prior to world war two as well but i'm not here trying to bash islam in general because
[02:34:16.500 --> 02:34:22.420]  the truth is the west has done a lot to destabilize those countries the state department for 60 years
[02:34:22.420 --> 02:34:27.060]  to try to radicalize islam with textbooks that were funded and other things as a quote
[02:34:27.060 --> 02:34:33.700]  bull work against the soviet union the truth is saudi arabia was put in by british intelligence
[02:34:33.700 --> 02:34:42.260]  in the last 90 years the truth is that they've set them up to dominate the region and look at
[02:34:42.260 --> 02:34:47.300]  this daily mail story this has been out for a few days but it's really gotten crazy now the details
[02:34:48.660 --> 02:34:55.380]  i'm a prince this came out from the police and i can do whatever i want cocaine craze saudi royal
[02:34:55.380 --> 02:35:02.740]  threatened to kill los angeles mansion staff who watched him being pleasureed by a male aid who he
[02:35:02.740 --> 02:35:09.780]  ordered to watch and now the same people he's one of the top princes is threatening to attack russia
[02:35:10.900 --> 02:35:14.500]  we'll just have nuclear war just because this guy thinks he's invincible and wants to throw a
[02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:22.980]  tinder tantrum and then it goes on to the mansion full of female escorts then i guess that wasn't
[02:35:22.980 --> 02:35:29.860]  enough for him he would tell women you're going to go upstairs i will be there in two minutes
[02:35:29.860 --> 02:35:33.700]  and you will do whatever i want if not then i will kill you
[02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:40.580]  imagine living in a country under these people i mean they didn't control but about a hundred
[02:35:40.580 --> 02:35:46.180]  square miles and it was 200 square miles if you go back to like 1901 that they controlled a caravan
[02:35:46.180 --> 02:35:53.300]  route going by mecca and they literally are a band of kidnapper robbers who then called themselves
[02:35:53.300 --> 02:36:02.660]  royal the british gave them weapons they took over i mean it is just cray and they've been feeding on
[02:36:02.660 --> 02:36:09.620]  the poor arabs and muslims in the area ever since i mean there is just it's such a joke i mean
[02:36:09.620 --> 02:36:13.060]  look at the photo i'm showing tv viewers of the current king of saudi arabia
[02:36:13.060 --> 02:36:20.900]  and these guys own part of fox news and all its propaganda
[02:36:23.940 --> 02:36:30.420]  but the feminist groups which is like hillary want to say mom and dad boy and girl father

[02:38:05.700 --> 02:38:11.620]  known to be involved in the important export of children known to have harems full of kidnapped
[02:38:11.620 --> 02:38:16.820]  women and now they come here to america and they go we're above the law no one can touch us and you
[02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:21.940]  know what they are above the law and they want to drag our daughter off the street into one of
[02:38:21.940 --> 02:38:27.460]  these spider holes they can and we're just to sit here and take it my my friend i mean our
[02:38:27.460 --> 02:38:33.300]  humiliation is really getting crazy go ahead yeah just look at the clinton's they've got a trail
[02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:38.020]  of skeletons and dead bodies going all the way back to the 1980s and yet the mainstream media
[02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:43.860]  leaves them alone bill clinton has been documented that bill clinton if he's still sleeping around
[02:38:43.860 --> 02:38:49.060]  with women one of his recent girlfriends was known as the energizer and that was the codename
[02:38:49.060 --> 02:38:54.020]  that the secret service agents had for her she would bring them cookies it's all been documented
[02:38:54.020 --> 02:38:58.580]  and let them yet the mainstream media doesn't talk about it hillary clinton has had a a trail of
[02:38:58.580 --> 02:39:03.220]  female lovers that goes back for many many years the mainstream media says nothing about it and
[02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:07.940]  yet candidates that they don't like they pick on any little thing any little word any little phrase
[02:39:07.940 --> 02:39:12.580]  that they say the mainstream media jumps on those things yet the clinton's are untouchable they don't
[02:39:12.580 --> 02:39:18.580]  talk about any of those scandals you know the the mainstream media is is shameful here in the
[02:39:18.580 --> 02:39:23.860]  united states in the way that they treat favored candidates rather than unfavorable candidates i
[02:39:23.860 --> 02:39:29.460]  mean the corruption is all around us you know i i in the old days before i did what i do today i
[02:39:29.460 --> 02:39:34.420]  worked in as an attorney right in the heart of washington dc i saw the corruption all around me
[02:39:34.420 --> 02:39:40.500]  it was horrible and i remember back in those days about a decade ago i would put on my headphones
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:45.700]  sometimes when i could at while i was at work and listen to the alex jones show right there in the
[02:39:45.700 --> 02:39:50.500]  bowels of washington dc and in those days your internet feed kind of sounded like it was coming
[02:39:50.500 --> 02:39:55.780]  out of a tin can this was like a decade ago or so but i i i was become so concerned about the
[02:39:55.780 --> 02:39:59.540]  direction of this country because we saw the corruption all around us but now it's gone to
[02:39:59.540 --> 02:40:05.140]  an entirely new level and but see most americans are feeling good about things the other day my
[02:40:05.140 --> 02:40:11.220]  wife and i were watching television and we saw some footage of nazi germany before world war two
[02:40:11.220 --> 02:40:16.580]  and they had these beautiful parades the pageantry the beauty of everything that was going on
[02:40:16.580 --> 02:40:22.180]  but it really masked an evil and and an insidious agenda which was going on there
[02:40:22.180 --> 02:40:26.500]  underneath and i believe the same thing is true in america today you turn on the television
[02:40:26.500 --> 02:40:32.260]  everything's so beautiful we've got our football games the bands are playing everything it looks
[02:40:32.260 --> 02:40:37.620]  just so clean and wonderful and beautiful and people say all america is so great but underneath
[02:40:37.620 --> 02:40:44.180]  is a wickedness and an evil and an insidious agenda we truly are becoming just like nazi germany we
[02:40:44.180 --> 02:40:49.140]  once fought a great war to rid the world of the nazis but now we're becoming just like them
[02:40:50.900 --> 02:40:58.340]  and to illustrate that bernie sanders comes out and says we need to have china style a family leave
[02:40:58.340 --> 02:41:03.780]  and james woods goes you utter moron but he's not a moron he knows what he's doing you utter moron
[02:41:03.780 --> 02:41:10.100]  on china has killed 50 million girls including many of them after they're born what do you mean we
[02:41:10.100 --> 02:41:16.420]  should mimic what communist china has done but see while you have real sexism killing women
[02:41:16.980 --> 02:41:21.860]  china gets praised for quote putting women in positions of power it's this inversion or
[02:41:21.860 --> 02:41:28.260]  this twisting where where women are being forced into the workforce by design to take over the
[02:41:28.260 --> 02:41:33.300]  children uh they're being prepared for selective service for the draft that's being sold like
[02:41:33.300 --> 02:41:39.140]  some wonderful right you get to be enslaved as well and then meanwhile a national news story
[02:41:40.900 --> 02:41:49.540]  dealing with target doing a joke ad putting luke skywalkers head on princess lia's body as a joke
[02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:54.900]  as a trendy joke i wouldn't wear a star wars shirt but i might wear that one it's funny
[02:41:54.900 --> 02:42:00.020]  i mean you only wear one to be nerdly you wear one as a joke you don't wear it because you're cool
[02:42:00.020 --> 02:42:05.780]  uh i mean i do wear star wars shirts occasionally because they're so ridiculous but i brought the
[02:42:05.780 --> 02:42:11.540]  dark side what did you bring to darth vader seeing your pond rubble alliance on trade i take her away
[02:42:11.540 --> 02:42:17.700]  and they stuck luke skywalkers head on it it's hilarious they've banned the shirt because people
[02:42:17.700 --> 02:42:24.420]  complained on twitter saying it was sexist see every hero has to be a woman now in the movies
[02:42:24.420 --> 02:42:28.820]  i don't care if women are heroes great i like movies where women are heroes if
[02:42:28.820 --> 02:42:35.460]  they're a good actress but if they're not a good actress we don't want to see it we don't want to
[02:42:35.460 --> 02:42:42.100]  be part of it you know it's like the the anakin skywalker character a horrible actor people hated
[02:42:42.100 --> 02:42:49.700]  him because he sucked okay this new black actor they've got the new star i mean people seen him
[02:42:49.700 --> 02:42:56.020]  in the trailer he looks like he's an after school uh you know special actor i mean he's a terrible
[02:42:56.020 --> 02:43:01.460]  actor i can say that i've been in some big movies he's a terrible actor and and and he's got plenty
[02:43:01.460 --> 02:43:05.860]  of black guys that can pull off a good role you know like the guy they had playing the black
[02:43:05.860 --> 02:43:13.540]  jedi leader is a great actor uh but again they turned that into it must be racism well yeah they
[02:43:13.540 --> 02:43:18.660]  have white supremacist coming out saying they're mad there's a black guy in a movie so see then their
[02:43:18.660 --> 02:43:25.380]  extremism next to the other extremism makes it look reasonable because really nobody complained
[02:43:25.380 --> 02:43:30.580]  about samuel l jackson they are complaining about this new guy because he looks like he's 12 years old
[02:43:30.580 --> 02:43:35.700]  and he's a horrible actor just like the other screwballs name who happens to be white but again
[02:43:35.700 --> 02:43:42.980]  the public is only informed about all this mindless minutia i'll guarantee you folks that that
[02:43:44.820 --> 02:43:50.980]  that they really are scared at target and have done this now uh removing uh the luke skywalker
[02:43:50.980 --> 02:43:58.100]  from the t-shirt because showing a man again is sexist men existing is sexist they don't get
[02:43:58.100 --> 02:44:04.340]  a joke why is it what do you think about the modern so-called feminist movement it makes me
[02:44:04.340 --> 02:44:08.580]  so angry these little politically correct things which get blown up in the media and that's what
[02:44:08.580 --> 02:44:14.340]  everyone gets all upset about meanwhile there's these but earth shattering things that are happening
[02:44:14.340 --> 02:44:19.780]  you know we had been over the past six months or so we've had these planned parenthood videos
[02:44:19.780 --> 02:44:25.060]  come out where they show that you know uh planned parenthood is killing millions of babies
[02:44:25.060 --> 02:44:29.620]  chopping them up harvesting their organs selling them up to the highest bidder where they're used
[02:44:29.620 --> 02:44:35.220]  in bizarre scientific experiments this has been put on display for the whole world to see and after
[02:44:35.220 --> 02:44:40.420]  all these videos have come out the american people are have clearly seen what's happening while just
[02:44:40.420 --> 02:44:46.180]  recently in us a today a survey was taken and they asked the american people they asked them
[02:44:46.180 --> 02:44:50.340]  okay should we cut off funding for planned parenthood and when i first saw that i thought okay
[02:44:50.340 --> 02:44:56.500]  maybe it'll be about 50 50 well what the survey found by more than a two to one margin the american
[02:44:56.500 --> 02:45:02.660]  people want the federal government to continue to give uh planned parenthood hundreds of millions
[02:45:02.660 --> 02:45:07.060]  of dollars a year not the question wasn't whether we should shut them down or not but it was whether
[02:45:07.060 --> 02:45:12.980]  we should keep giving them hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer money a year it was 65 to
[02:45:12.980 --> 02:45:18.820]  29 percent so at this point only 29 percent of all americans even want to cut off funding
[02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:23.780]  to plan parenthood after everything that's been revealed you know that tells me that america
[02:45:23.780 --> 02:45:31.300]  is done america is finished we're in decline we're totally out of control social decay is all around
[02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:36.660]  us we're the fattest we're the stupidest we're the most arrogant we are we are exceptional
[02:45:36.660 --> 02:45:41.620]  slobs and that doesn't mean all of us we still are exceptionally good those of us that are awake
[02:45:41.620 --> 02:45:47.220]  we still have a lot of innovations but man you're right we are rotting and imagine how
[02:45:47.220 --> 02:45:53.380]  dangerous these piranha people will be who have no empathy who don't care about the unborn imagine
[02:45:53.380 --> 02:45:57.380]  how dangerous they'll be during a full collapse i mean i i know that's something you've really
[02:45:57.380 --> 02:46:01.780]  researched what do you expect to happen if there's a full collapse and not just a slow rot
[02:46:03.300 --> 02:46:09.620]  well today we've got uh most of the population are packed in these mega city areas uh most
[02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:16.660]  people over half the country doesn't even have a a three-day supply of emergency food or water 62
[02:46:16.660 --> 02:46:22.260]  percent of all americans are living paycheck to paycheck and so just like we saw in 2008 when
[02:46:22.260 --> 02:46:26.180]  things start happening people start losing their jobs they're not going to be able to pay the mortgage
[02:46:26.740 --> 02:46:30.740]  millions of people are going to lose their homes i believe in this next great wave of the crisis
[02:46:30.740 --> 02:46:35.300]  which is is coming and people are going to become desperate they're not going to have food for their
[02:46:35.300 --> 02:46:39.780]  children they're going to be they're going to be uh angry and frustration already we see anger
[02:46:39.780 --> 02:46:44.820]  and frustration at unprecedented levels in this country so i believe that we are going to see civil
[02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:50.020]  unrest on a massive scale in this country just like we saw in furgus and just like we saw on
[02:46:50.020 --> 02:46:56.820]  spoil rotten brats running around demanding everything i mean it's just sick yeah in america
[02:46:56.820 --> 02:47:02.740]  today according to the u.s census bureau 49 of all americans live in a home that receives some
[02:47:02.740 --> 02:47:08.180]  form of aid from the federal government every single month well over 100 million americans so
[02:47:08.180 --> 02:47:13.780]  government dependence is spiked to a higher level than ever before you know we've got people that
[02:47:13.780 --> 02:47:18.500]  that are not self-sufficient can't take care of themselves and yet that we see the moral decline
[02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:23.220]  it's not like the great depression when back then we had some hard times but people could handle it
[02:47:23.220 --> 02:47:27.940]  and work together and go through the tough times because there was more of a moral fiber in this
[02:47:27.940 --> 02:47:32.260]  nation and i weep over this nation because i'm not like some of the people that talk about the
[02:47:32.260 --> 02:47:38.260]  downfall of america that hate america i love the united states so i hate the fact that we're seeing
[02:47:38.260 --> 02:47:45.140]  this happened to what was once such a great nation i weep for the future that's lost the future for
[02:47:45.140 --> 02:47:50.580]  our children the future for our grandchildren it's it's really tragic well again we're not just
[02:47:50.580 --> 02:47:56.100]  here complaining about problems folks it's a fact and now they want to give us forced inoculations
[02:47:56.100 --> 02:48:02.180]  so getting back to that question i know you answered it but the doubling down enforced
[02:48:02.180 --> 02:48:07.940]  inoculations msnbc announcing your kids belong to us the the boys and girls bathrooms being
[02:48:07.940 --> 02:48:13.940]  pulled out all of it isn't an attempt to just totally demoralize us or have the elite themselves
[02:48:13.940 --> 02:48:21.540]  gone completely insane i think the elite have gone completely insane i think they feel like
[02:48:21.540 --> 02:48:28.660]  it's time to go for broke it's time to to really upset the apple cart so a lot of people say well
[02:48:28.660 --> 02:48:33.860]  why would the elite want an economic collapse you know don't they want things to be stable no
[02:48:33.860 --> 02:48:38.900]  when there's a collapse when there's crisis it enables them to move things forward and i believe
[02:48:38.900 --> 02:48:44.340]  we're already seeing the the start of this alex in fact the largest bank in the western world
[02:48:44.340 --> 02:48:51.220]  british banking giant hsbc huge new world order bank they recently came out and they said that global
[02:48:51.220 --> 02:48:59.140]  gdp expressed in us dollars is already down 3.4 percent this year so according to them we're
[02:48:59.140 --> 02:49:06.660]  already in a global dollarized recession they also said that global trade is down 8.4 percent so far
[02:49:06.660 --> 02:49:12.740]  this year i see it everywhere i mean the economy is stalling while the media continues to tell us
[02:49:12.740 --> 02:49:17.380]  everything is okay when do you think the next big plunge is going to be or will it just be a slow
[02:49:17.380 --> 02:49:23.700]  decline well i believe we have been seeing this decline which is extended over years i believe
[02:49:23.700 --> 02:49:28.660]  we have years ahead of us but i believe it's going to greatly accelerate now a lot of people they were
[02:49:28.660 --> 02:49:34.180]  hyping up september you know we saw sales of emergency food skyrocket that there was so much
[02:49:34.180 --> 02:49:40.260]  hype around september and so then september came and it didn't necessarily meet people's expectations
[02:49:40.260 --> 02:49:45.460]  we did see earth shattering things happen global financial markets went crazy but because it didn't
[02:49:45.460 --> 02:49:51.060]  meet the expectations of the end of the world or total financial collapse that people were anticipating
[02:49:51.060 --> 02:49:55.620]  a lot of people have stopped preparing so my contacts in the emergency food industry tell
[02:49:55.620 --> 02:50:00.500]  me that their sales have dropped through the floor uh someone that i trust in the precious metals
[02:50:00.500 --> 02:50:05.140]  areas it told me precious metals and sales have dropped through the floor one author told me
[02:50:05.140 --> 02:50:10.660]  who writes about these things his sales of his books are down 80 percent and so we've seen you
[02:50:10.660 --> 02:50:15.380]  know all of a sudden all these people out there said well september is past time to relax i'm not
[02:50:15.380 --> 02:50:20.260]  going to stop preparing anymore i believe that's a tragic mistake oh it's crazy and you know that's
[02:50:20.260 --> 02:50:24.500]  why it's not good with these christian groups say jesus is coming next year and it doesn't happen and
[02:50:24.500 --> 02:50:29.300]  they said all christians said that uh or i was saying i don't believe the schmita is going to be
[02:50:29.300 --> 02:50:33.540]  anything i don't believe these blood moons are going to do anything the elite believe in them a
[02:50:33.540 --> 02:50:38.500]  bunch of big stuffs happening but you know the big events coming in the fall the winter next year we
[02:50:38.500 --> 02:50:43.700]  don't know all the indicators are there but i'm so sick of the people that planet x will come next

[02:54:34.260 --> 02:54:40.980]  be archived for you on our facebook page but the nra will fall it's inevitable and it basically
[02:54:40.980 --> 02:54:47.220]  admits because the immigrant inflow to big cities uh and the people are getting higher educated they
[02:54:47.220 --> 02:54:54.100]  mean brainwashed that uh they will get the guns and we live in a country where it's like we will

[02:55:31.060 --> 02:55:40.260]  and it's about the legislated clock resetting uh by what authority does 2am ever become 3am a
[02:55:40.260 --> 02:55:44.260]  clock was once a scientific instrument it's not meant to tell you what time to go to work and what
[02:55:44.260 --> 02:55:49.140]  time to go home it's to tell you where your piece of the earth is pointed toward the star
[02:55:49.140 --> 02:55:53.940]  under global warming they may have a set our thermostats higher to comply with what they're
[02:55:53.940 --> 02:55:57.940]  saying even though we're about to have a record cold winter well here in the air conditioner
[02:55:57.940 --> 02:56:03.780]  belt it's just the common knowledge it doesn't save electricity it makes you use more electricity
[02:56:03.780 --> 02:56:09.700]  they expanded daylight saving under the 2005 energy bill uh so now we're on daylight saving
[02:56:09.700 --> 02:56:17.300]  eight months of the year and only on standard time four months of the year and uh people 30ish or
[02:56:17.300 --> 02:56:22.900]  younger don't even have any idea that it's happening here's the real conspiracy of time zones and
[02:56:22.900 --> 02:56:27.540]  daylight savings time and different global systems it's an attempt to get other countries to sign
[02:56:27.540 --> 02:56:35.540]  on to the system as well for global standardization uh w m q m lister 600 a.m there in tennessee
[02:56:35.540 --> 02:56:40.420]  it's a great point let's let's ask snider about that looks innocuous on the surface but a lot of
[02:56:40.420 --> 02:56:46.020]  folks don't like it what's your view well this is just another example the micro managing of our
[02:56:46.020 --> 02:56:51.060]  society every year thousands of new laws and rules and regulations are added on top of what we already
[02:56:51.060 --> 02:56:56.500]  have our liberties and freedoms are more restricted every single year so we're less free today as
[02:56:56.500 --> 02:57:01.060]  americans today than we've ever been before in history so this is just another example of how
[02:57:01.060 --> 02:57:08.580]  they micromanage and tightly constrain our our lives well said uh roscoe do a video on it write
[02:57:08.580 --> 02:57:14.980]  an article about it for us we'll publish it at info wars dot com of its decent quality um writers
[02:57:14.980 --> 02:57:19.540]  at info wars dot com show tips send articles and folks send in your commentary we want to hear from
[02:57:19.540 --> 02:57:28.580]  you raymond in south carolina you're on the air go ahead how's it going alex good um first of all
[02:57:28.580 --> 02:57:33.780]  i just want to let you know i'm a south carolina national guard member and i'm also a college student
[02:57:33.780 --> 02:57:43.700]  here in semer region four and i recently called my congressman uh trai gowdy to ask why four of my
[02:57:43.700 --> 02:57:49.860]  state representatives voted for the ttp fast track bill that uh you guys have been talking about sir
[02:57:50.900 --> 02:57:57.700]  and uh of course i couldn't get a hold of him but one of his aides said that uh he basically
[02:57:57.700 --> 02:58:02.260]  fed me a whole line of rhetoric that that wasn't the bill they're going to have plenty of time to
[02:58:02.260 --> 02:58:08.020]  vote for it all they were voting for it was a vote before the vote sort of staying it was a vote to
[02:58:08.020 --> 02:58:12.500]  give the president the authority to negotiate the deal in secret and then the congress has to
[02:58:12.500 --> 02:58:17.460]  certify it but they've never voted down a trade promotion authority once it's been given to a
[02:58:17.460 --> 02:58:26.340]  president exactly which was what i had uh mentioned to him and i was stressing uh to him that why would
[02:58:26.340 --> 02:58:32.740]  you guys vote for a trade bill like this when this is one of the things that um don trump is running on
[02:58:32.740 --> 02:58:37.860]  how we quote unquote and i'd say there i want to hear what he said back in 70 seconds some stations

[02:59:51.060 --> 02:59:53.700]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:59:53.700 --> 03:00:07.860]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[03:00:07.860 --> 03:00:10.980]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:00:14.340 --> 03:00:19.060]  raymond from south carolina was calling up the congressman that's heading up the
[03:00:19.060 --> 03:00:23.540]  Benghazi committee and was trying to bring up this big international secret treaty that they've signed
[03:00:23.540 --> 03:00:29.060]  on to that the public can't see that congress is to go in a locked room to see and he was going
[03:00:29.060 --> 03:00:35.540]  through their responses to him go ahead there raymond sure thing alex the main point i wanted
[03:00:35.540 --> 03:00:42.980]  to bring up to them was that by voting for a bill like this the tp the tpp it's one of the main
[03:00:42.980 --> 03:00:47.460]  things that donald trump has been running on is our negotiation of trade deals and how quote
[03:00:47.460 --> 03:00:52.740]  unquote we've been losing on every front america is losers that's one of the things that he says
[03:00:52.740 --> 03:00:59.140]  all the time um and when i brought that up they said that uh they totally agree with me they don't
[03:00:59.140 --> 03:01:06.020]  want to look like a bad deal but they voted for it nonetheless but uh the the main reason i called
[03:01:06.020 --> 03:01:10.900]  that was a side point one of the other callers that brought up the tpp the main reason i called
[03:01:10.900 --> 03:01:18.180]  was about a couple of the comments that uh dr paul made about uh the goings on with russia in the
[03:01:18.180 --> 03:01:25.860]  world yes um i've actually been trying to take a very big picture look at this and from what i can
[03:01:25.860 --> 03:01:34.260]  tell uh given uh some of my background in the military and uh some of the steps that we personally
[03:01:34.260 --> 03:01:41.460]  have taken uh i believe that the whole ordeal in the ukraine was very telling for what has been
[03:01:41.460 --> 03:01:47.700]  going on now because the media and especially our government has been controlling the narrative on
[03:01:47.700 --> 03:01:56.980]  russia for a for a long time and there's no way that they didn't know russia was going to be forced
[03:01:56.980 --> 03:02:05.300]  into action in syria once syria melted down because of how pivotal that region is for them
[03:02:05.300 --> 03:02:10.260]  economically they knew it was just a matter of time so instead of having russia coming in
[03:02:10.900 --> 03:02:17.140]  and looking justified they had to control the narrative beforehand and make them already
[03:02:17.140 --> 03:02:22.100]  look vilified in the national media so that they already had or they were trying to divert them off
[03:02:22.100 --> 03:02:28.900]  uh syria onto ukraine and they thought russia would abandon ukraine but they failed to um predict
[03:02:28.900 --> 03:02:33.780]  that outcome thank you for the call great points i'll try to go to jimmy and mike and shane and
[03:02:33.780 --> 03:02:37.940]  others but we've got or you probably will talk to rob do coming up but uh schneider you got any
[03:02:37.940 --> 03:02:44.820]  comments on the whole situation in syria i sure do why are there still targets for russia to bomb
[03:02:44.820 --> 03:02:50.100]  we were told that the u.s military had been in there for over a year bombing isis bombing them
[03:02:50.100 --> 03:02:56.260]  into oblivion yet the russians have come in and they've identified dozens of isis targets command
[03:02:56.260 --> 03:03:02.660]  centers uh weapons depots etc etc so we've seen video of russia bombing dozens of targets inside
[03:03:02.660 --> 03:03:08.020]  syria so could the u.s military either not find those targets or did the obama administration
[03:03:08.020 --> 03:03:12.900]  not want them bomb something smells very very funny because russia's found tons and tons of
[03:03:12.900 --> 03:03:18.180]  isis targets to bomb that supposedly we were not able to bomb in over a year that if something
[03:03:18.180 --> 03:03:24.420]  seems very wrong to me well the first attacks a month ago or the key ones or 23 days ago hitting
[03:03:24.420 --> 03:03:29.860]  all the al nazar command bases that are really running isis they cut the head off the snake
[03:03:29.860 --> 03:03:36.100]  i mean i was funny that they thought russia would follow western propaganda that al nazar is a good
[03:03:36.100 --> 03:03:41.220]  group and isn't running the show with al qaeda so i just loved how the russians chopped al qaeda's
[03:03:41.220 --> 03:03:45.380]  head off and then all their little minions ran around like chickens with their heads cut off as
[03:03:45.380 --> 03:03:52.500]  well when papa got taken down it was very funny uh let's go ahead real quick jimmy in michigan
[03:03:52.500 --> 03:03:59.380]  what's your point on the militia yes uh it's just a couple of it's more of a correction than a
[03:03:59.380 --> 03:04:07.540]  disagreement with you uh these these have the facts a little bit wrong about chary one of the things
[03:04:07.540 --> 03:04:16.100]  that really made the feds jump and they were moved way too fast is the fact that we had been
[03:04:16.100 --> 03:04:21.860]  utari and the michigan militia corps wolverines had been working with the county sheriff here in
[03:04:21.860 --> 03:04:26.980]  washtar county no that's what i said on air was that they were trying to work with local government
[03:04:26.980 --> 03:04:32.980]  and be legitimate so they sent in infiltrators to set up the group well the infiltrators were
[03:04:32.980 --> 03:04:38.580]  already there before that happened that was the thing and we started getting some really
[03:04:38.580 --> 03:04:42.100]  i tell you what i want to hear this we're out of time for the part i'm hosting thank you michael
[03:04:42.100 --> 03:04:48.820]  snider stay on hold jimmy i i guarantee a rob do will come to you mike shane and others mel

[03:08:27.300 --> 03:08:31.700]  variety of hosts here on the fourth hour it's kind of a hodgepodge of what's going on recapping some
[03:08:31.700 --> 03:08:37.140]  news that happened today and we had an especially news making event today with ron paul every time
[03:08:37.140 --> 03:08:42.420]  he shows up on the show this time via beautiful video skype from his studios down near houston i
[03:08:42.420 --> 03:08:49.380]  believe victoria texas where he's located and he got into a variety of topics we're putting those
[03:08:49.380 --> 03:08:54.580]  up on info wars right now but one i wanted to get specifically to and i'm also going to go to your
[03:08:54.580 --> 03:08:59.700]  calls here i want to we're going to finish up with jimmy but i want to play with what dr paul
[03:08:59.700 --> 03:09:04.820]  this is what he had to say about the russian syrian situation so let's go to that clip right now
[03:09:05.620 --> 03:09:11.540]  looking at this election looking at ran paul uh looking at how he's really the only candidate
[03:09:11.540 --> 03:09:19.780]  that isn't for expanding the war in syria um what is your view on the russian entry into syria
[03:09:23.780 --> 03:09:29.300]  well i i look at it in a practical way i look for that what our policy should be we
[03:09:29.300 --> 03:09:32.420]  shouldn't have been in there and we should leave and then that leaves it up to the neighborhood
[03:09:32.420 --> 03:09:38.340]  to take care of it we're in 152 countries and if we're saying okay we got to watch out we got to
[03:09:38.340 --> 03:09:45.460]  be terrified and we have to do anything we can to stop the russians exerting uh their uh their
[03:09:45.460 --> 03:09:51.780]  program which is next to their border whether it's uh uh whether it's ukraine or whether it's syria
[03:09:51.780 --> 03:09:57.220]  uh they uh they have a treaty with one country with one base and they i think i have one one
[03:09:57.220 --> 03:10:03.220]  aircraft carrier so they want to keep that base so i would say that's more their business and i i
[03:10:03.220 --> 03:10:08.260]  sort of get in charge of the fact that kerry says oh those russians are not too smart they're gonna
[03:10:08.260 --> 03:10:14.260]  get bogged down in syria well maybe so if they do maybe it'll be like afghanistan but why should we
[03:10:14.260 --> 03:10:18.980]  why should we blog ourselves now how could how could it be any worse than what we're doing to
[03:10:18.980 --> 03:10:27.540]  ourselves so i would let uh i would let russia and uh the the turks and uh you know the curds
[03:10:27.540 --> 03:10:32.900]  and these other people be involved and take care of it and maybe if we withdrew some of our
[03:10:32.900 --> 03:10:38.420]  financial and military support over there maybe saudi arabia wouldn't be so aggressive maybe
[03:10:38.420 --> 03:10:44.740]  they'd have to deal with the yemen's with yemen all by themselves so that that whole area would
[03:10:44.740 --> 03:10:50.740]  become more peaceful and they would work out more work on things much more peacefully but i don't
[03:10:50.740 --> 03:10:57.620]  think that uh if we if we compare russia exerting themselves to protect one naval base outside
[03:10:57.620 --> 03:11:04.100]  their country compared to us being in our 152 countries and being the next assuming the role
[03:11:04.100 --> 03:11:14.100]  of total policeman of the world no comparison and that was wrong paul with a basic common sense
[03:11:14.100 --> 03:11:18.980]  non-interventionist message that he's been known for all through the years he's been in congress
[03:11:18.980 --> 03:11:24.900]  and now even retired we don't need to be involved in russia we don't need to be involved with syria
[03:11:24.900 --> 03:11:29.380]  you know why do we have over 150 bases around the world how much money is that costing us
[03:11:29.380 --> 03:11:34.180]  and would that money be better better spent here on the united states maybe on fixing our
[03:11:34.180 --> 03:11:38.740]  crumbling infrastructure or providing jobs for people like you know the government does love
[03:11:38.740 --> 03:11:45.220]  to provide jobs and in some ways it is good at doing that in some ways but i think maybe we give
[03:11:45.220 --> 03:11:51.300]  give everybody tax breaks maybe we let businesses decide how they want to spend their money and
[03:11:51.300 --> 03:11:56.740]  in hiring people and expanding and creating more jobs here that's what you get when you have a
[03:11:56.740 --> 03:12:02.980]  lower tax base but we can never convince people like bernie sanders to do that let's go to i
[03:12:02.980 --> 03:12:07.860]  want to let jimmy finish up and then we have mike and shane also on the line and they actually
[03:12:07.860 --> 03:12:12.820]  want to talk about what dr ron paul said earlier today but jimmy go ahead and recap with everything
[03:12:12.820 --> 03:12:23.220]  you said earlier and continue on okay uh what what we were doing is running for different
[03:12:23.220 --> 03:12:31.700]  offices in the at the township level we had secured some of them we became precinct delegates in
[03:12:31.700 --> 03:12:37.220]  the republican party not that most of us are republicans it's just that made more logic
[03:12:37.940 --> 03:12:44.100]  it was more logical to be a it's a good place to start i agree yeah right and now that you see
[03:12:44.100 --> 03:12:50.660]  what we've done uh and what we're working toward here in michigan um i think it was the right
[03:12:50.660 --> 03:12:58.580]  move to make and we were getting just tons of good press we were in the anabra news we had been on
[03:12:59.300 --> 03:13:07.780]  uh the local news stations here in detroit and they had done some interviews with uh several of us
[03:13:07.780 --> 03:13:14.900]  and that i think is truly why the feds move faster than they should have moved because they never
[03:13:14.900 --> 03:13:23.060]  really had any evidence on anyone uh the only thing that they had was this jersey steve guy who
[03:13:23.060 --> 03:13:31.460]  was the fbi plant had made these bombs and davestone looked at him so it somehow he was guilty and
[03:13:31.460 --> 03:13:38.900]  that was that was all they had and they they just failed to get a conviction as a matter of fact we
[03:13:38.900 --> 03:13:46.020]  even had the former county sheriff was going to testify uh on the behalf of the lukari people
[03:13:46.020 --> 03:13:51.780]  right but what happened was they tried that whole case basically in the media thrown it out there
[03:13:51.780 --> 03:13:56.180]  that these guys were terrorists terrorists but then finally when when it comes out that they've
[03:13:56.180 --> 03:14:00.660]  all been cleared except this one guy who's got you know questionable background not much mention
[03:14:00.660 --> 03:14:09.940]  of that you're right right and and the local papers and the local uh news media did carry the
[03:14:09.940 --> 03:14:15.380]  story truthfully at you know just it was the national media that they tried to cover up
[03:14:15.380 --> 03:14:21.540]  and back battle and lie uh they even wanted us to go on a nightline and a couple of other
[03:14:21.540 --> 03:14:28.660]  things we were approached by abc and and none of it ever panned out because we weren't crazy
[03:14:28.660 --> 03:14:34.660]  you know when you're a logical common sense down to a person they don't talk to you they
[03:14:34.660 --> 03:14:38.340]  want to talk to somebody like david duke you know they want to talk to a lunatic
[03:14:41.140 --> 03:14:47.380]  yeah i mean that's clearly what they want right and they weren't getting that from us and you
[03:14:47.380 --> 03:14:53.060]  know this whole investigation started out of they the fbi was actually investigating another
[03:14:53.060 --> 03:14:59.780]  militia group the southeastern michigan volunteer militia they fared it a mile and then they said
[03:14:59.780 --> 03:15:05.380]  look you don't want to watch us we're not doing anything wrong go look at these mucari guys so
[03:15:05.380 --> 03:15:12.900]  that's how they wound up and they hired some of their people to infiltrate uh huchari and so on and
[03:15:13.700 --> 03:15:19.060]  and if you look up anybody can do a search out there for fbi creates terror plots fbi's creating
[03:15:19.060 --> 03:15:24.500]  the terror threats fbi's goading people uh they get somebody in a compromising position and say
[03:15:24.500 --> 03:15:28.420]  look now you work for us we want you to go infiltrate we want you to find some people who
[03:15:28.420 --> 03:15:31.860]  could be duped and uh say you're going to give them ten thousand dollars if they go blow up a
[03:15:31.860 --> 03:15:36.420]  bridge which i think happened in ohio this guy was getting his tenants who he thought weren't
[03:15:36.420 --> 03:15:40.420]  very smart in getting them to admit that they wanted to blow up a bridge but he was getting
[03:15:40.420 --> 03:15:44.340]  all the materials he was getting everything here's the bomb just go do it these guys wouldn't
[03:15:44.340 --> 03:15:48.180]  have done this on their own but when they're in trap like that they do do that and that happens a
[03:15:48.180 --> 03:15:53.220]  lot and in the huchari's case it definitely looks like the same thing was going on thanks for your
[03:15:53.220 --> 03:15:57.940]  call jimmy mic in tennessee uh what did you have to talk about i know dr paul did talk about gun
[03:15:57.940 --> 03:16:04.100]  control today what was your perspective on that well what i was referring to is earlier alex asked
[03:16:04.100 --> 03:16:10.340]  dr paul about people revolting and dr paul said the problem is that they have all the guns and
[03:16:10.340 --> 03:16:16.980]  well that's true however they don't have people behind those guns remember when the people address
[03:16:16.980 --> 03:16:24.260]  the order givers the order takers have no orders to follow that is true but what we have to look
[03:16:24.260 --> 03:16:28.900]  at is when they create these autonomous drone killing systems which they are in development
[03:16:28.900 --> 03:16:33.780]  right now there's a ground vehicle version of that we've got plenty of drones up in the skies
[03:16:33.780 --> 03:16:38.340]  that is where they still can come after but you also have to have pilots and people repairing
[03:16:38.340 --> 03:16:42.420]  these things and i'm sure there's kill switches on them and everything else so you are right about
[03:16:42.420 --> 03:16:46.900]  there but they at this point now there there has to be people who will follow those orders
[03:16:46.900 --> 03:16:52.180]  unfortunately if you look at the 29 palm survey it was over 30 percent said they would fire on
[03:16:52.180 --> 03:16:56.580]  americans if they refused to get their guns so that and that was back in the 90s so who knows
[03:16:56.580 --> 03:17:01.540]  what it is now with all the brainwashing that's been going on chain what is your question or comment
[03:17:01.540 --> 03:17:10.260]  on dr paul well dr paul referred to some younger people and i'm one of those uh my biggest question
[03:17:10.260 --> 03:17:16.580]  is where do you start to prepare i mean it might be too late or just irrelevant at this point but
[03:17:16.580 --> 03:17:21.060]  where do you start it's never too late you have to find i think you find a group of like-minded
[03:17:21.060 --> 03:17:26.020]  people and you decide maybe you pull your resources together maybe look at a piece of land out of town
[03:17:27.380 --> 03:17:31.940]  get some storable food get a good water filter system that doesn't need electricity or water pumps
[03:17:32.500 --> 03:17:36.740]  and and and get books because when the internet goes down you're not going to have
[03:17:36.740 --> 03:17:42.500]  uh uh access to information that that you would have had normally through your phone or through
[03:17:42.500 --> 03:17:48.660]  your computer so get books on survival get seeds get ready if stuff does go down that you're
[03:17:48.660 --> 03:17:53.140]  prepared get a bug out bag i've i've got friends in california and they all have bug out bags
[03:17:53.140 --> 03:17:58.100]  because i think it just came out that they're predicting within the next 30 months of a category
[03:17:58.100 --> 03:18:04.100]  or a a Richter scale 5.0 earthquake in the la area so you have to be prepared because it may not
[03:18:04.100 --> 03:18:09.300]  be martial law in the end of the you know an end of the world type scenario with like an EMP attack
[03:18:09.300 --> 03:18:13.780]  but it could be a natural disaster that the feds want to use as a as a case to come in and take
[03:18:13.780 --> 03:18:19.060]  people's guns which is what they did in Katrina so it's never too late to prepare and if you start
[03:18:19.060 --> 03:18:23.460]  today you're that much more ahead of the game than the people who haven't started at all so just know
[03:18:23.460 --> 03:18:28.660]  that once once the word goes out that stuff's collapsing you got about two days of food in
[03:18:28.660 --> 03:18:34.900]  the grocery store so you need to prepare accordingly there's plenty of resources out there you know
[03:18:34.900 --> 03:18:38.500]  for people out there like yourself so it's never too late and the fact that you're young
[03:18:38.500 --> 03:18:43.380]  is good it means you got a lot of energy so hopefully you have time to put all that preparedness
[03:18:43.380 --> 03:18:48.500]  in uh guys if you could pull up the computer in here somebody put together this uh interesting
[03:18:48.500 --> 03:18:53.220]  little bill o'reilly versus alex jones i guess they and they got jacari jackson and joe bigs in there
[03:18:54.420 --> 03:18:58.260]  really interesting what you can do with computers now i guess he built this into a game put the
[03:18:58.260 --> 03:19:04.020]  skins together put the t-shirts and uh so he's created a little wrestling match between bill
[03:19:04.020 --> 03:19:10.420]  o'reilly and alex jones and uh we've got we've got bill o'reilly and his fox minions and there's
[03:19:10.420 --> 03:19:15.940]  i guess joe bigs and jacari jackson are also featured in this video but pretty interesting
[03:19:15.940 --> 03:19:20.500]  what you can do nowadays and people are holding up 9 11 truth signs i mean that's a great way
[03:19:20.500 --> 03:19:24.500]  to wake people up maybe somebody goes man what's 9 11 truth and they search it and then they start
[03:19:24.500 --> 03:19:29.380]  telling their friends about it and that's how this stuff happens so this is just one little way
[03:19:29.380 --> 03:19:33.540]  to you know fight the info war and i'm not sure who made this or here let's just see where they
[03:19:34.180 --> 03:19:39.620]  put it on is wrestling with politics there it is so we'll be back with more i'm going to have lian

[03:23:13.300 --> 03:23:18.820]  need for water but have you considered heat storage i'm talking about staying warm in the cold

[03:23:28.740 --> 03:23:33.940]  take it with you another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke
[03:23:33.940 --> 03:23:39.540]  like in times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler

[03:24:27.940 --> 03:24:33.460]  realm because we don't want to have violence in real life unless it it comes to defending yourself
[03:24:33.460 --> 03:24:36.980]  and whatnot but this i think is just great the way technology is common that you can really

[03:24:43.460 --> 03:24:46.900]  be a manager like they used to have all right you know but you come in with the chair don't make me

[03:29:58.660 --> 03:30:05.140]  a us high school student has reportedly hacked a personal aol account of cia director john brinnan
[03:30:05.140 --> 03:30:10.900]  according to the hacker everything from a 47 page application for top secret security clearance

[03:30:15.860 --> 03:30:21.940]  notes the new york post the october 12 intrusion began after the hacker was able to trick workers
[03:30:21.940 --> 03:30:27.540]  at verizon into providing brinnan's personal information and duping aol into resetting his
[03:30:27.540 --> 03:30:32.820]  password law enforcement sources speaking with the post were shocked at the hackers actions
[03:30:32.820 --> 03:30:37.860]  noting that the agency would undoubtedly make an example of the hackers if possible we've

[03:33:15.780 --> 03:33:20.740]  politicize i'm not going to carry a gun i don't want to be involved in the gun flight if i could have
[03:33:20.740 --> 03:33:28.900]  gotten 51 votes in the senate of the united states for an outright ban picking up every
[03:33:28.900 --> 03:33:42.100]  one of them mr and mrs america turn them all in go ahead make my day for the notion that
[03:33:42.100 --> 03:33:48.420]  gun laws don't work it's not born out by the evidence he says that the chicago police had a plan
[03:33:48.420 --> 03:33:55.700]  over this bloody fourth of july weekend nonetheless as you indicated cori there was a count of
[03:33:55.700 --> 03:34:02.740]  casualties that could have been from afghanistan or iraq will make it harder for law-abiding
[03:34:02.740 --> 03:34:08.100]  citizens and criminals will still get their guns in many cases the offenders uh felons
[03:34:08.100 --> 03:34:15.780]  a sum out on parole some out on bond we have to respect the tradition in this country of people
[03:34:15.780 --> 03:34:21.300]  who want to defend themselves and their families from violence there are people at high levels
[03:34:21.300 --> 03:34:29.220]  in this government who have bodyguards 24 hours a day seven days a week the average american
[03:34:29.220 --> 03:34:35.860]  does not have that may have limber why why why can you defend yourself but not the majority of
[03:34:35.860 --> 03:34:40.980]  americans i mean look at look at the team of security you got every day every school at every
[03:34:40.980 --> 03:34:45.940]  level one thing that i think is clear with young people and with adults as well is that we just
[03:34:45.940 --> 03:34:50.660]  have to be repetitive about this and we need to do this every day of the week and just really
[03:34:50.660 --> 03:34:56.740]  brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way was this the weapon of choice
[03:34:56.740 --> 03:35:02.580]  for a new kind of terrorist when a five-year-old girl said she and a classmate should shoot each
[03:35:02.580 --> 03:35:08.980]  other with bubbles the school calls it a terrorist threat a k-47s belonging to the hands of soldiers
[03:35:08.980 --> 03:35:13.540]  not in the hands of criminals you know the right to bear arms is because that's the last form of
[03:35:13.540 --> 03:35:20.500]  defense against tyranny lay down your arms you damn rebels but we don't need the ability to
[03:35:20.500 --> 03:35:25.620]  arm assess against the army or the police what kind of a situation in the u.s would you see that
[03:35:25.620 --> 03:35:29.380]  happening i mean we've got a lot of constitution listening to a lot of people that it's not
[03:35:29.380 --> 03:35:34.420]  our weapons discover this hurt you would help the government with potentially their biggest
[03:35:34.420 --> 03:35:41.620]  problem us to say we're not turning our guns in and we're not about it and we're not knocking down
[03:35:41.620 --> 03:35:50.420]  if you want to comment take us rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's alex
[03:35:50.420 --> 03:36:05.860]  john well i seen a video like that makes me proud to be an american and proud to be working
[03:36:05.860 --> 03:36:10.660]  in info wars and proud to be talking about the issues that stuff like the mainstream media
[03:36:10.660 --> 03:36:15.140]  won't touch i was noticing at the end of this smackdown video i didn't even seen this till i
[03:36:15.140 --> 03:36:20.660]  sat in here today but they show bill there it is right there there's the dinosaur media being
[03:36:20.660 --> 03:36:26.020]  carted off they're dying dead the alternative media is replacing them the alternative media
[03:36:26.020 --> 03:36:30.260]  is moving to tv was one of the things we're doing we're moving to tv too because we want to spread
[03:36:30.260 --> 03:36:33.540]  the message of liberty to everybody we think everybody even if you don't have an internet
[03:36:33.540 --> 03:36:39.700]  connection should be able to catch this message and help spread it because if we don't the socialists
[03:36:39.700 --> 03:36:44.100]  will take over and they will take everything you have and redistribute it while they live in their
[03:36:44.100 --> 03:36:50.820]  far off bubble elysium type cities and we all just you know live in hell on earth now today is
[03:36:50.820 --> 03:36:58.900]  october 21st 2015 and if you watched back to the future i think it was part two marty goes
[03:36:59.700 --> 03:37:05.860]  from the present back into the future and it's october 21st 2015 and by that time
[03:37:05.860 --> 03:37:14.020]  um biff tannen had taken over and of course we know he's sort of like an allegory to trump and
[03:37:14.020 --> 03:37:18.180]  this came out of the daily beast there's a very specific analog between biff tannen the bully
[03:37:18.180 --> 03:37:22.660]  and bad guy in almost every timeline back to the future part two and a certain political figure
[03:37:22.660 --> 03:37:26.580]  who's rather popular in the united states right now he's been handed the keys to the fortune
[03:37:26.580 --> 03:37:30.820]  he's unrepentant that he's used that fortune exclusively for himself even become a public
[03:37:30.820 --> 03:37:35.140]  advocate for plastic surgery on women well trump has said a lot of other things that they don't
[03:37:35.140 --> 03:37:39.380]  mention in this article funny enough but yeah i believe there is probably they were looking at
[03:37:39.380 --> 03:37:43.060]  the future and saying well maybe we'll have president trump one day i believe there's a rage
[03:37:43.060 --> 03:37:48.340]  against the machine video show people holding signs for president trump so who knows if we
[03:37:48.340 --> 03:37:53.060]  will see that being a reality doesn't look like the cubs are going to make it to the world series
[03:37:53.060 --> 03:37:56.580]  even though they're very close but it doesn't it looks like the the meds are going to beat them
[03:37:56.580 --> 03:38:00.020]  that was another prediction and back to the future and here's a one-minute presentation
[03:38:00.020 --> 03:38:05.380]  that we've been playing today on the info wars are on the alex jones show this is the fourth hour
[03:38:05.380 --> 03:38:11.220]  but here we actually put some video to it so this is from david night it was 30 years ago in 1985
[03:38:11.220 --> 03:38:18.180]  that doc and marty went back another 30 years to 1955 then they went back to the future to today
[03:38:19.860 --> 03:38:23.460]  hey doc we better back up we don't have enough roads to get up to 88 roads
[03:38:23.460 --> 03:38:30.180]  but we're going we don't need roads well there's no flying cars and it isn't the roads they say
[03:38:30.180 --> 03:38:35.060]  we don't need they tell us where we're going there won't be any drivers and there's no hoverboards
[03:38:35.060 --> 03:38:42.180]  or self-lacing shoes but at least we're not plagued with fax machines you may just need a
[03:38:42.180 --> 03:38:46.980]  lightning strike for power says obama and the epa are trying to shut down most of the power plants
[03:38:46.980 --> 03:38:54.820]  but the movie's future resembles the present in a couple of very strange ways the cubs got in
[03:38:54.820 --> 03:39:01.780]  the world series and even stranger discover how in 1979 biff successfully lobbied to legalize gambling
[03:39:01.780 --> 03:39:07.460]  and turned hill valleys dilapidated courthouse into a beautiful casino hotel you just want to say
[03:39:07.460 --> 03:39:19.940]  one thing god bless america forever wars dot com i'm david night all right and there it is that
[03:39:19.940 --> 03:39:24.820]  was from david night uh five back to the future big brother predictions that came true that's a
[03:39:24.820 --> 03:39:30.900]  kit daniel's article that just came out today on i guess the 30th anniversary of uh of back to the
[03:39:30.900 --> 03:39:36.660]  future which is a big hit back in the 80s lots of movies were made back in the 80s that still ring
[03:39:36.660 --> 03:39:42.660]  true today getting back to russia we had ron paul earlier in the show talking about russia and here's
[03:39:42.660 --> 03:39:47.060]  an article from kurt nimo and i guys roll this video while i read this this is actual video
[03:39:47.060 --> 03:39:51.940]  that you can see in the article it's embedded in there russian video reveals hellish carnage
[03:39:51.940 --> 03:39:58.900]  in syria earlier this week russian television released an hd video of a devastated jaw bar in
[03:39:58.900 --> 03:40:04.180]  the eastern suburb of demascus where jihadists in syria government are battling the video
[03:40:04.180 --> 03:40:10.020]  allegedly shot by a drone shows tanks firing amidst hellish wreckage of buildings and you
[03:40:10.020 --> 03:40:14.340]  can see that on screen right now if you're watching this if you're listening to this on radio and
[03:40:14.340 --> 03:40:19.540]  you'd like to see some of this log on to info wars dot com forward slash show you could see uh i'm
[03:40:19.540 --> 03:40:25.780]  not sure if those are uh militants or if it's the russians helping out with the syrians but
[03:40:25.780 --> 03:40:31.620]  they're launching airstrikes that is amazing looking hd video i tell you right that is just
[03:40:31.620 --> 03:40:37.060]  amazing link bring bring up bring back the video guys i mean that is just unbelievable that we're
[03:40:37.060 --> 03:40:44.580]  able to get this quality of video from a battle zone and we're seeing firsthand what uh the russians
[03:40:44.580 --> 03:40:51.620]  could do in a month which we couldn't do in a year in fact it was september 24th of i believe 2014
[03:40:51.620 --> 03:40:57.380]  that obama put out the message that we're going to start launching airstrikes again i against isis
[03:40:57.380 --> 03:41:03.460]  targets a whole year went by isis got stronger took more land now within a month russia has
[03:41:03.460 --> 03:41:08.340]  been proclaiming that they've taken out almost all the head leadership all their heavy equipment
[03:41:08.340 --> 03:41:13.700]  and their ammo depots so i don't know what were they doing that we weren't maybe we weren't really
[03:41:13.700 --> 03:41:19.620]  trying to win that war maybe we were just trying to uh exacerbate this and have regime change in
[03:41:19.620 --> 03:41:25.060]  syria which russia has a treaty with syria so they're bound to come protecting they have a
[03:41:25.060 --> 03:41:29.620]  treaty with them you know here in our country we were told not to make treaties that was one thing
[03:41:29.620 --> 03:41:33.620]  george washington said don't get mired in treaties because that's or either him or tom
[03:41:33.620 --> 03:41:37.940]  scheperson said that don't get mired in those because that's what leads to more conflict later
[03:41:37.940 --> 03:41:43.540]  down the road let the neighborhood clean out their own neighborhood now here is a very creepy video
[03:41:43.540 --> 03:41:49.060]  that was put out five months ago but the daily mail is just covering it super super creepy it
[03:41:49.060 --> 03:41:55.780]  shows a man in a plague mask which looks like a giant beak and uh i guess since halloween this
[03:41:55.780 --> 03:42:00.420]  of this video has now been making the rounds creepy video mass figure featuring cryptic
[03:42:00.420 --> 03:42:06.020]  threats towards barack obama and the white house sets social media in a spin the creepy footage
[03:42:06.020 --> 03:42:10.980]  and go ahead and roll the footage guys you can go to the youtube channel and and play that it's
[03:42:10.980 --> 03:42:15.860]  not much to look at it it kind of reminds me of the ring or one of those weird videos like after
[03:42:15.860 --> 03:42:21.140]  you watch this and suddenly you'll turn in to a demon or something figures a medieval style plague
[03:42:21.140 --> 03:42:25.380]  doctor mask in a black robe who stares silently a strange noises play in the background and these
[03:42:25.380 --> 03:42:30.980]  noises are very strange you can hear them right there and uh let's not let's not put too much of
[03:42:30.980 --> 03:42:35.620]  that out there i don't want to trigger anybody if this is a triggering mechanism it just made me
[03:42:35.620 --> 03:42:40.260]  want to drink my coffee faster it contains numerous cryptic messages which appear to be
[03:42:40.260 --> 03:42:44.500]  a sinister threat even the name itself if you go to the youtube video and look at the name it's
[03:42:44.500 --> 03:42:50.580]  posted in binary code which people have translated muerto or muerte which means death in spanish
[03:42:50.580 --> 03:42:55.300]  deos de los muertos is the day of the dead which happens the day after halloween there is the
[03:42:55.300 --> 03:43:01.380]  binary code for that and supposedly there's a coded message in there it says kill the president
[03:43:02.420 --> 03:43:08.660]  but what i find is most interesting is people did spectrograph analysis of the audio and they
[03:43:08.660 --> 03:43:12.740]  showed a visual representation of if you scroll down guys you can see that and show it's all the
[03:43:12.740 --> 03:43:16.900]  people out there watching at info wars.com forward slash show are in the live feed on
[03:43:16.900 --> 03:43:23.700]  prisonplanet.tv there's the first one which they say shows a visual representation which shows
[03:43:23.700 --> 03:43:28.340]  a woman being tortured also a dvd was sent out and they did a spectrograph analysis of that and
[03:43:28.340 --> 03:43:33.220]  it's got this weird skull with some more cryptic letters so is this just a hoax who knows but
[03:43:33.220 --> 03:43:38.180]  if you go to the about on the youtube page it shows a russian email address for the account
[03:43:38.180 --> 03:43:42.260]  i actually sent him an email said are they interesting going public talking about that click
[03:43:42.260 --> 03:43:47.620]  on the the name and go to about in there and you can actually see gives you a russian email address
[03:43:47.620 --> 03:43:56.100]  there it is aetbxatmail.ru so i sent him an email contact uh contact him see if they want to talk
[03:43:56.100 --> 03:43:59.940]  about it because it is showing a threat against the president maybe they want to talk about that
[03:43:59.940 --> 03:44:06.100]  what do they mean about that threat who knows but it was interesting very creepy and after
[03:44:06.100 --> 03:44:10.260]  listening to that audio i decided to share a little bit with the audience out there now
[03:44:10.260 --> 03:44:14.660]  uh last night on the info wars nightly news we premiered part two of the tech report showing
[03:44:14.660 --> 03:44:19.540]  the satanic roots between what's going on in this transhumanist technology and this part two that
[03:44:19.540 --> 03:44:26.260]  we premiered last night we looked at it starts off with how the unabomber has affected transhumanists
[03:44:26.260 --> 03:44:30.500]  like uh bill joy and ray Kurzweil so we're going to play the first five minutes of that
[03:44:30.500 --> 03:44:34.900]  and there is an article which you can go check out and see the rest of it i don't know if i have it
[03:44:34.900 --> 03:44:39.380]  here in my stack or not but it's in info wars under the side tech section but let's roll
[03:44:39.380 --> 03:44:43.860]  that first five minutes of the report showing the the connection between the unabomber who was a
[03:44:43.860 --> 03:44:49.140]  luddite lived in uh technology free zones out in the cabin in the woods a literal hermit and
[03:44:49.140 --> 03:44:57.300]  between what the futurists were talking about robots cyborgs and life extension technology
[03:44:57.300 --> 03:45:04.020]  these terms are familiar to any fan of science fiction but now to some disbelief these technologies
[03:45:04.020 --> 03:45:10.180]  are a science reality in part one of this report we expose some startling connections
[03:45:10.180 --> 03:45:16.660]  between 19th and 20th century secret societies their occult technological experiments and the
[03:45:16.660 --> 03:45:23.220]  emerging automated prison society that is rapidly descending upon us in part two we look at a
[03:45:23.220 --> 03:45:29.780]  possible motivation for the elite who are financing this emerging new world a world whose construction
[03:45:29.780 --> 03:45:37.380]  started centuries ago in april of 2000 wired magazine published an article why the future
[03:45:37.380 --> 03:45:43.300]  doesn't need us it was written by sun micro systems co-founder bill joy in it he quotes
[03:45:43.300 --> 03:45:51.220]  ray Kurzweil's book the age of spiritual machines if the elite are ruthless they may simply decide
[03:45:51.220 --> 03:45:57.140]  to exterminate the mass of humanity if they are humane they may use propaganda or other
[03:45:57.140 --> 03:46:02.580]  psychological or biological techniques to reduce the birth rate until the mass of humanity
[03:46:02.580 --> 03:46:09.860]  becomes extinct leaving the world to the elite what makes this article and quote even more
[03:46:09.860 --> 03:46:15.700]  interesting than one tech pioneer quoting another is the footnote at the bottom of the article
[03:46:15.700 --> 03:46:22.500]  the passage Kurzweil quotes is from Ted Kaczynski's unabomber manifesto which was published jointly
[03:46:22.500 --> 03:46:28.100]  under duress by the new york times and the washington post to attempt to bring his campaign
[03:46:28.100 --> 03:46:34.500]  of terror to an end why would tech industry leaders go out of their way to quote kaczynski's
[03:46:34.500 --> 03:46:41.140]  unabomber manifesto in not one but two separate publications well for those of you who skip past
[03:46:41.140 --> 03:46:46.820]  the 35 000 word manifesto that appeared in both the new york times and washington post on the
[03:46:46.820 --> 03:46:54.900]  morning of september 22nd 1995 there were some very telling things printed on those pages within
[03:46:54.900 --> 03:47:01.540]  his article joy himself writes about the quote i am no apologist for kaczynski his bombs killed
[03:47:01.540 --> 03:47:07.620]  three people during a 17 year terror campaign and wounded many others kaczynski's actions were
[03:47:07.620 --> 03:47:13.140]  murderous and in my view criminally insane he is clearly a luddite but simply saying this
[03:47:13.140 --> 03:47:18.660]  does not dismiss his argument as difficult as it is for me to acknowledge i saw some merit in
[03:47:18.660 --> 03:47:25.380]  the reasoning in this single passage i felt compelled to confront it we at info wars share
[03:47:25.380 --> 03:47:32.180]  a similar point of view as joy about the manifesto like bill joy we do not consider ourselves lidites
[03:47:32.180 --> 03:47:38.500]  we often discuss humanity's fate traveling the stars however we also recognize that some of the
[03:47:38.500 --> 03:47:44.500]  words written within ted kaczynski's text shouldn't be simply dismissed as writings of a madman
[03:47:44.500 --> 03:47:51.380]  but should be given special attention and careful thought before he was the unabomber kaczynski
[03:47:51.380 --> 03:47:58.180]  was considered a child prodigy and he was accepted into harvard college at the age of 16 he was among
[03:47:58.180 --> 03:48:04.340]  22 students who were research subjects in what has been described as brutalizing psychological
[03:48:04.340 --> 03:48:12.740]  experiments conducted by henry murray and rumored to be part of the mk ultra program kaczynski was
[03:48:12.740 --> 03:48:18.900]  an eyewitness to some of the most cutting-edge technological experiments of his day it seems
[03:48:18.900 --> 03:48:24.980]  reasonable that curse while joy and others might be interested to see what insights he reveals in
[03:48:24.980 --> 03:48:31.940]  his writings kaczynski's manifesto touches upon a wide range of subjects including this one in
[03:48:31.940 --> 03:48:39.060]  paragraph 157 where he writes it has been established beyond any rational doubt that human thought and
[03:48:39.060 --> 03:48:45.620]  behavior have a largely biological basis as experimenters have demonstrated feelings such as
[03:48:45.620 --> 03:48:52.580]  hunger pleasure anger and fear can be turned on and off by electrical stimulation of appropriate
[03:48:52.580 --> 03:48:58.660]  parts of the brain memories can be destroyed by damaging parts of the brain or they can be brought
[03:48:58.660 --> 03:49:05.460]  to the surface by electrical stimulation in that last phrase kaczynski accurately describes
[03:49:05.460 --> 03:49:11.620]  experiments dealing with mind control technology these mind control experiments weren't isolated
[03:49:11.620 --> 03:49:17.700]  in elite university labs they were conducted on a large portion of the population oftentimes
[03:49:17.700 --> 03:49:22.420]  within the military secretary of energy oliri during the equipment administration admitted
[03:49:22.420 --> 03:49:27.940]  over a half a million americans were used as experimental guinea pigs for various programs
[03:49:27.940 --> 03:49:35.140]  many many of them um military personnel um as well as as other people that really didn't have
[03:49:35.140 --> 03:49:40.500]  the right to really speak up for themselves tech journalist dr nick beggage has been covering the
[03:49:40.500 --> 03:49:48.580]  subject of mind control technology for more than 25 years the idea of using mind control techniques
[03:49:48.580 --> 03:49:55.540]  and modern warfare this is uh the direction in which we're we're headed that is the direction
[03:49:55.540 --> 03:50:01.460]  and which we're headed if you look at uh who is it the the oklahoma city bomber timothy mcvay
[03:50:01.460 --> 03:50:06.900]  rumored to be part of a uh in a might he thought he said he had a microchip in him and said he you
[03:50:06.900 --> 03:50:13.380]  know he was all drugged up he disappeared for a while uh i think it was a director who appeared
[03:50:13.380 --> 03:50:17.140]  on the alex joneshaw actually shot some footage of him inside a tank when he supposedly wasn't in
[03:50:17.140 --> 03:50:23.060]  the military at the time and the footage is a dead ringer for mcvay then you look at james
[03:50:23.060 --> 03:50:28.580]  holmes the the killer who was involved in different mind control programs at his university one of
[03:50:28.580 --> 03:50:33.300]  which was run by a DARPA scientist really makes you think how far they've come since they had
[03:50:33.300 --> 03:50:38.500]  kazinski strapped to a chair with electrodes and going into his brain and what happened to him
[03:50:38.500 --> 03:50:42.500]  he actually you know he he pushed away from it and then looked at the future and set out you
[03:50:42.500 --> 03:50:47.300]  know in his way he thought he was doing something you know was he right was he wrong who knows only
[03:50:47.300 --> 03:50:51.300]  time will tell it's technology though and we definitely have to be wary of it experts thought
[03:50:51.300 --> 03:50:55.460]  manipulation technology is already here it's on informers.com watch the whole video and go back

[03:54:15.940 --> 03:54:23.300]  he's getting a bat right now and well but that prompted venture to come in yeah the governor
[03:54:23.300 --> 03:54:27.860]  comes in then if you have no idea what i'm talking about we have it posted on info wars dot com go
[03:54:27.860 --> 03:54:34.740]  to smack down info wars vs fox news and um you know that looks so i thought that was like a clip
[03:54:34.740 --> 03:54:38.340]  from a news show where people were standing up with info wars shirts on that's how realistic
[03:54:38.340 --> 03:54:43.300]  these video games if yeah we i noticed that this morning i was over there big sis desk and alex
[03:54:43.300 --> 03:54:48.500]  came in and he's looking at it he's like post that right now so we we've got it posted and
[03:54:49.300 --> 03:54:53.700]  you know it's it's pretty entertaining i think it's called wrestling with politics wrestling
[03:54:53.700 --> 03:54:58.020]  of politics and he has a bunch of different it only has 270 views people let's give this guy a
[03:54:58.020 --> 03:55:03.300]  bunch of views let's give him a bump and he also has a alex fighting peers and uh governor ventura
[03:55:03.300 --> 03:55:07.540]  and a bunch of other people in there as well he has stuff about the debates and all that so
[03:55:08.180 --> 03:55:13.060]  this is kind of funny and client but you know it shows that we're we're getting into that pop culture
[03:55:13.060 --> 03:55:18.180]  meme an area where the stuff we say can't just be dismissed anymore it's actually being you know
[03:55:18.180 --> 03:55:21.700]  people are taking their time to say hey these guys are credible i'm going to do a whole video game
[03:55:21.700 --> 03:55:26.180]  about them and showing some of the signs like 9 11 truths and all that anyway that's not why i got
[03:55:26.180 --> 03:55:30.580]  you in here to car tonight you're hosting the nightly news your back you took a week off uh right
[03:55:30.580 --> 03:55:34.420]  before that you were uh chasing the president around in oregon and right before that we were
[03:55:34.420 --> 03:55:39.380]  chasing around the pope praising the pope you've been on several chasing missions and cut logging
[03:55:39.380 --> 03:55:44.900]  many miles on foot and on rental car by train by air yes i mean that this last two months you've
[03:55:44.900 --> 03:55:49.540]  probably done more traveling than you've done most of the year yeah i have geez that pope
[03:55:49.540 --> 03:55:52.980]  trip was probably about a week but the latest trip was only two or three days but you know
[03:55:52.980 --> 03:55:56.660]  as far as travel that's a lot of travel because we had to fly into portland and then drive down to
[03:55:56.660 --> 03:56:02.020]  the city where the college was so we had a lot of lot of travel miles but enough of that let's talk
[03:56:02.020 --> 03:56:06.820]  about the info wars nightly news what is going on tonight so of course we're going to talk about
[03:56:06.820 --> 03:56:11.460]  the very very sad news i'm sure you want to wipe your eyes for this that joe biden is not
[03:56:11.460 --> 03:56:16.020]  going to be running for president i was i was actually hoping for more creepy uncle joe like
[03:56:16.020 --> 03:56:20.180]  getting next to hillary and sticking his nose in there those are some weird photos of him very
[03:56:20.180 --> 03:56:25.380]  weird weird stuff so and also you know go out on your shot on your balcony shoot your shotgun
[03:56:25.380 --> 03:56:31.220]  right my shotgun ridiculousness and it is back to the future day so we're going to talk about
[03:56:31.220 --> 03:56:35.700]  the things that pertain to that and not about the cubs went in the the world series but
[03:56:35.700 --> 03:56:40.660]  kid has a real in-depth article it breaks down how the world has changed since the
[03:56:40.660 --> 03:56:44.340]  movie first came out and you know the different changes that we could see that were somewhat
[03:56:44.340 --> 03:56:48.740]  foreshadowed even from the 80s to now it's yeah completely the internet has definitely made the
[03:56:48.740 --> 03:56:52.740]  world a different place i think for the better overall but you know you have the good with the
[03:56:52.740 --> 03:56:57.220]  bad so yeah i mean it's it's always good and bad but you know you just try to make the
[03:56:57.220 --> 03:57:00.660]  balance the best way you can of course we have the full video that you were talking about earlier
[03:57:00.660 --> 03:57:04.740]  with leanne she's going through her cleanse her and her friend emi who actually just got here
[03:57:04.740 --> 03:57:08.420]  they're going to do a photo shoot i guess they're going to post those pictures a little bit later
[03:57:08.420 --> 03:57:12.100]  so people can track their progress and you know see how the cleanse works for them
[03:57:12.100 --> 03:57:15.700]  you know because like i'm like you i haven't done the full cleanse but i have taken the oxy powder
[03:57:16.580 --> 03:57:21.300]  yeah and the shot right there it works it works i'll tell you man this this stuff uh
[03:57:21.860 --> 03:57:26.580]  it work it'll clean you out it'll clean you out and if you follow the regiment you know i think
[03:57:26.580 --> 03:57:31.700]  it says start with five and then increase yeah i i was doing four four is usually enough for me
[03:57:31.700 --> 03:57:37.220]  but you know different people i take seven oh wow seven and it works man let me tell you so i find
[03:57:37.220 --> 03:57:41.940]  it best i usually take mine at night and when i do take it i try to take it with a little apple
[03:57:41.940 --> 03:57:47.460]  cider vinegar and a couple glasses of water make sure you're well hydrated exactly that and drink
[03:57:47.460 --> 03:57:53.300]  water all day long and it helps keep everything clean because all the crap out there that we eat
[03:57:53.300 --> 03:57:59.060]  that we drink that you know the radiation from electromagnetic sources from tv's from phones
[03:57:59.060 --> 03:58:03.300]  i mean it all has an impact on our bodies and you're a pretty healthy guy but it does take a
[03:58:03.300 --> 03:58:07.700]  lot of work to be healthy but i think you know the benefits definitely outweigh the effort that
[03:58:07.700 --> 03:58:11.700]  you put in and just like group always says you know we go through all these efforts to
[03:58:11.700 --> 03:58:16.820]  clean the exterior but we do very little to clean the interior there you go to do something to
[03:58:16.820 --> 03:58:20.820]  clean out the inside yeah the globalists have convinced us that it's all about how you look
