[00:00.000 --> 00:11.340]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.340 --> 00:18.880]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.880 --> 00:33.720]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you for
[00:33.720 --> 00:39.800]  joining us it is the 30th day of June on this Tuesday edition Tuesday June 30th
[00:39.800 --> 00:48.840]  2009 we're going to be live here for the next four hours coming up on the next
[00:48.840 --> 00:54.640]  hour we have a climatologist Dr. Tim Ball coming on to break down what's
[00:54.640 --> 00:58.240]  really happening with supposed climate change they're basically teaching
[00:58.240 --> 01:03.840]  children now that the seasons are abnormal and that we've got to have
[01:03.840 --> 01:09.080]  basically 76 degrees year-round or we've got to have population reduction to
[01:09.080 --> 01:12.920]  stop it and polar bears can't swim and so we've got to give up all of our
[01:12.920 --> 01:23.640]  rights and liberties as well so Dr. Tim Ball joining us we are also going to
[01:23.640 --> 01:29.600]  get an individual called Spencer Pratt on and the reason I'm having this
[01:29.600 --> 01:37.280]  individual on is I don't read the tabloids I don't watch TMZ on TV I
[01:37.280 --> 01:43.600]  really don't know who any of these people are I hardly know who Paris Hilton
[01:43.600 --> 01:50.480]  is but but these are these are I guess another echelon a lower echelon of
[01:50.480 --> 01:57.360]  people like that what's interesting is though that they I guess have been
[01:57.360 --> 02:06.360]  twittering back and forth with the Cyrus girl that plays Hannah Montana and so we
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.480]  had hundreds and hundreds of emails an hour yesterday coming in and thousands
[02:11.480 --> 02:16.320]  of Twitter's coming in asking us about us and hey if I can use the system's
[02:16.320 --> 02:20.960]  own ridiculous hype machine to reach young people about real issues and not
[02:20.960 --> 02:25.320]  Michael Jackson Paris Hilton I'll do it so we'll talk to this individual about
[02:25.320 --> 02:32.760]  the Twitter phenomenon is MTV TV show and supposedly he's waking up he and his
[02:32.760 --> 02:38.680]  girlfriend are waking up to the New World Order and figuring out that running
[02:38.680 --> 02:44.880]  around I guess basking in the media glow for absolutely no reason is not as
[02:44.880 --> 02:48.600]  important as the whole world government coming down on top of us but
[02:48.600 --> 02:52.280]  that's coming up in the last hour of the show we'll have them on 20 minutes or so
[02:52.280 --> 02:57.760]  that should be always informative to try to find out I from this sector of
[02:57.760 --> 03:04.600]  society that is I don't know what you call it kind of like the heart of the
[03:04.600 --> 03:14.600]  hype machine the what is Paris Hilton what is all of that just just tabloid for
[03:14.600 --> 03:22.320]  tabloid sake it's tabloid fame not even stemming from any type of media fame
[03:22.320 --> 03:25.920]  basically everybody in the office knows that these people are I have no idea who
[03:25.920 --> 03:33.840]  they are I really doesn't even register but we'll delve into that area and see
[03:33.840 --> 03:38.000]  how many people that this gentleman knows who are kind of in this strata of
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.200]  media that are waking up to the New World Order because when I talk to some
[03:43.200 --> 03:49.000]  music legend icon who's waking up but doesn't want to come on the air I can't
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.880]  ever get into it when I talk to some famous director who's awake to the New
[03:52.880 --> 03:57.040]  World Order but doesn't want to come on air I don't talk about it when I talk to
[03:57.040 --> 03:59.760]  some high-level politician who's a fan of the show but I want to come on there I
[03:59.760 --> 04:05.600]  can't get them on I can get a Jesse Ventura a Willie Nelson a Charlie Sheen
[04:05.600 --> 04:10.640]  a Rick Link letter you know we told you three or four months before was in the
[04:10.640 --> 04:15.480]  news that we'd woken up Bruce Willis I mean we have those type of successes but
[04:15.480 --> 04:20.320]  most of successes we can't ever tell you about and look if we can get the
[04:20.320 --> 04:23.320]  Hollywood people instead of them being controlled leftist or controlled right
[04:23.320 --> 04:28.960]  wing Republicans that is a major wound to the New World Order in their entire
[04:28.960 --> 04:35.800]  system so we'll delve into that some in the last hour today as we reach out to

[08:32.600 --> 08:39.640]  okay ladies and gentlemen here is the rundown of what we're gonna cover today
[08:39.640 --> 08:47.440]  and the four-hour transmission red alert the total takeover of America enters
[08:47.440 --> 08:52.160]  its final phase I want to thank listeners yesterday when this story went up on
[08:52.160 --> 08:57.120]  present planet dot com for making it go mega viral supernova it is all over the
[08:57.120 --> 09:00.480]  web let's continue to push it out there because everybody's looking at the
[09:00.480 --> 09:03.960]  federal takeover of health care the federal looting of the second
[09:03.960 --> 09:09.080]  amendment the federal takeover of all carbon activity all industry everyone's
[09:09.080 --> 09:15.160]  homes with the greenhouse gas tax passing the house racing through the
[09:15.160 --> 09:19.840]  Senate they see the clean water restoration act total federalization of
[09:19.840 --> 09:23.720]  all land in the United States because of water above ground or below ground total
[09:23.720 --> 09:28.800]  jurisdiction total criminality they see the absolute amnesty bill for complete
[09:28.800 --> 09:33.240]  legalization of all illegal aliens racing through the house but they see it
[09:33.240 --> 09:38.840]  all individually as separate pieces the bottom of the hour I'm gonna read all of
[09:38.840 --> 09:45.600]  Paul Joseph Watson's article on air titled red alert the total takeover of
[09:45.600 --> 09:55.280]  America enters its final phase and he's got six red alert points in here and
[09:55.280 --> 10:03.560]  there's many others but these are the six big ones and it is now final house
[10:03.560 --> 10:06.800]  procedural rules are very confusing depending on how a final vote was called
[10:06.800 --> 10:09.840]  we talked around Paul's office yesterday that original story we got up the
[10:09.840 --> 10:14.480]  daily Paul was incorrect but nobody's perfect we all make mistakes there was
[10:14.480 --> 10:17.800]  not a chance to call and get them to do a motion reconsidered the way the vote
[10:17.800 --> 10:23.360]  was originally called so that's a done deal in the house I guess we're kind of
[10:23.360 --> 10:26.640]  doing a ghost dance or something wishing that we could reverse what happened in
[10:26.640 --> 10:32.640]  the house and then now is in the Senate and Ron Paul's on record we're gonna
[10:32.640 --> 10:36.000]  play that clip later saying he talked to a bunch of Democrats they know it's
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.040]  criminal they know it's gonna kill the economy they know it's gonna shut
[10:39.040 --> 10:43.280]  everything down but there they will be destroyed by lobbyist and the lobbyists
[10:43.280 --> 10:48.160]  will fund their their opposition and the American people are drugged out of their
[10:48.160 --> 10:52.640]  minds watching TV all day and obsessed with celebrities and Michael Jackson so
[10:52.640 --> 10:55.320]  they won't go out and support these Congress people so they just sell out
[10:55.320 --> 10:59.400]  to the foreign banks and that's what's happening right now is just an
[10:59.400 --> 11:03.440]  absolute corporate takeover of the country so I'm gonna cover that story
[11:03.440 --> 11:12.680]  Iraq is cheer and fear CNN reports US pullout from cities and this was the
[11:12.680 --> 11:18.920]  plan all along after six years and three and a half months of occupation and
[11:18.920 --> 11:29.480]  11 years of siege before that let me see 1991 to 2003 it's almost 12 years of
[11:29.480 --> 11:36.280]  siege and in six years plus of occupation they've built giant permanent bases
[11:36.280 --> 11:41.240]  one of them holds 6,000 people they call it an embassy that's a shadow
[11:41.240 --> 11:46.640]  government parasite operation that has giant you know armed paramilitary
[11:46.640 --> 11:50.920]  intelligence forces inside who then run all the secret police and the torture
[11:50.920 --> 11:56.360]  gangs and the hit squads that's all on record and so they're gonna keep 50 to
[11:56.360 --> 12:03.960]  80,000 troops they still got 60 160,000 over there right now but the plan has
[12:03.960 --> 12:08.880]  always been under Bush and under Obama to keep 50 to 80,000 they debate the
[12:08.880 --> 12:18.600]  different numbers 50 to 80,000 50 to 80,000 troops there permanently and then
[12:18.600 --> 12:23.800]  rotate the other troops over into Pakistan and Afghanistan and into
[12:23.800 --> 12:28.280]  Georgia and circling Russia so that's what's happening well with the troops
[12:28.280 --> 12:33.880]  they've already conquered one zone and part of the force the army of the New
[12:33.880 --> 12:42.240]  World Order is what it is is moving on like locust to the next field so we'll
[12:42.240 --> 12:48.760]  go over some of that today all lawmakers challenge to read health care bill
[12:48.760 --> 12:58.920]  before voting on it and Republican leadership is now coming out and saying
[12:58.920 --> 13:03.640]  we are challenging the Democrats to allow us to read this because what they do
[13:03.640 --> 13:07.240]  is they bring out some of the proposals they bring out normally about 30% of
[13:07.240 --> 13:12.040]  the bill like this lash almost 1300 finally they were adding pages pulling
[13:12.040 --> 13:15.840]  pages it could have it was over 1500 at one point they now admit went back down
[13:15.840 --> 13:21.680]  to 1250 or so so it's being expanded it's having parts removed the lobbyists
[13:21.680 --> 13:26.400]  are all in there swarming over at the foreign lobbyists predominantly the
[13:26.400 --> 13:30.160]  Congress isn't even allowed to see it only a key few committee chairman and
[13:30.160 --> 13:33.880]  their staff which are bought and paid for by the lobbyist by their handlers
[13:33.880 --> 13:37.360]  them this is all on record this is admitted they've had the Republican and
[13:37.360 --> 13:42.080]  Democratic leaders of the House and Senate admit quote banks control
[13:42.080 --> 13:52.640]  Congress just completely dominated and so they're not letting the rank and
[13:52.640 --> 13:57.560]  file Democrats or any of the Republicans see the health care bill and what
[13:57.560 --> 14:03.640]  they'll do is now this week in the next week there they're they're blitzing us
[14:03.640 --> 14:07.280]  they're blitzkrieging us they're just racing past us they're gonna try to
[14:07.280 --> 14:17.760]  pass this thing lock stock and barrel hook line and sinker bum rushing us just
[14:17.760 --> 14:23.200]  like a linebacker you know taken down one of the wide receivers and breaking
[14:23.200 --> 14:27.760]  his ribs he hits him so hard that's what they're doing to the American people
[14:27.760 --> 14:34.680]  right now and they're saying can we please just see it and they're saying
[14:34.680 --> 14:44.600]  no sit down shut up this is the pimp game it's the same thing on total
[14:44.600 --> 14:48.120]  amnesty for the illegal aliens same thing on the new federalization
[14:48.120 --> 14:52.760]  Federal Reserve bill that will not just give them unlimited money and power and
[14:52.760 --> 14:56.200]  oversight they already have that but allow them to seize any and all
[14:56.200 --> 15:01.720]  businesses lands just total dictatorship the Supreme Court is in line with that
[15:01.720 --> 15:05.920]  with the new new London kilo decision on seizing private property for private
[15:05.920 --> 15:11.400]  interest I mean it's here this is the third world receivership just just like
[15:11.400 --> 15:16.200]  the IMF and World Bank take third world countries in receivership so lawmakers
[15:16.200 --> 15:19.960]  challenge to read health care bill before voting that's out of Politico we'll go
[15:19.960 --> 15:24.480]  over some of that Ireland commissioner says most EU countries would reject
[15:24.480 --> 15:31.040]  Libs and Treaty London Telegraph well no kidding they've only allowed three
[15:31.040 --> 15:37.520]  continental European countries what France the Netherlands and one other to
[15:37.520 --> 15:44.000]  vote in the last five years on Libs and Treaty expansion Lisbon I always
[15:44.000 --> 15:52.640]  call it Lisbon it's Lisbon treaty Ireland commissioners say most EU
[15:52.640 --> 16:00.800]  countries would reject Lisbon Treaty and Ireland voted last year and said no the
[16:00.800 --> 16:05.320]  media kept saying it's gonna be a landslide everybody's voting for it
[16:05.320 --> 16:11.520]  foreigners are trying to influence Irish to vote against it which was actually
[16:11.520 --> 16:15.920]  the opposite it was foreigners trying to push the Irish into going into the
[16:15.920 --> 16:20.320]  European Empire and waving all their hard-won liberties and freedoms the few
[16:20.320 --> 16:24.960]  they've got after British domination and that's all this EU is is an
[16:24.960 --> 16:31.480]  amalgamation of the British and European and American Empire and so the Irish
[16:31.480 --> 16:35.280]  saw through it beat it by a huge margin and so now they're back saying it's
[16:35.280 --> 16:39.640]  gonna pass everybody's for it and they're targeting kind of the fad-driven
[16:39.640 --> 16:45.240]  housewife or teenager type or kind of Joe Sixpack who just barely listens to
[16:45.240 --> 16:49.000]  the radio or reads the newspaper oh all my fellow Irish are for it I'm gonna vote
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.960]  for it you know just a mass hoax everybody's gonna vote for it everybody
[16:52.960 --> 16:58.800]  wants it that's the same stuff in the headlines foreigners are trying to
[16:58.800 --> 17:02.680]  pressure the Irish not to join well the Irish aren't gonna put up with fun and
[17:02.680 --> 17:08.040]  domination they're gonna wave all their rights and go under EU control they play
[17:08.040 --> 17:12.440]  little mind games with you but the Irish aren't buying now see the elite know the
[17:12.440 --> 17:17.160]  American people are so dumb down so ignorant of geography and world facts
[17:17.160 --> 17:21.520]  that here they just tell us there is no American Union and we're actually under
[17:21.520 --> 17:29.160]  it since 2005 under treaty March 24th 2005 it was signed it's openly announced
[17:29.160 --> 17:33.280]  all over the world they openly have North American Union summits Bush even gave
[17:33.280 --> 17:36.440]  press conferences about merging the American Union with the European Union
[17:36.440 --> 17:41.200]  and the transatlantic agreement with Merkel and Barroso it's an endgame and
[17:41.200 --> 17:47.040]  the public doesn't even know what continents are literally the average
[17:47.040 --> 17:54.720]  American is like Miss South Carolina who can't even talk such as Americans
[17:54.720 --> 18:00.520]  tax bugs helping freedom with them oh good back let's cue her up I want folks
[18:00.520 --> 18:06.200]  to hear that coming back if they need to be reminded now sure 30% of us are so
[18:06.200 --> 18:09.880]  know about geography know about the world basic facts understandable rights of
[18:09.880 --> 18:14.040]  Constitution but the elite are betting on the other 70% folks who don't even
[18:14.040 --> 18:18.280]  know of its day or night sometimes I mean they're just in a mind-numb days
[18:18.280 --> 18:26.120]  going from one bestial low-level instinct satiating their basic programming to
[18:26.120 --> 18:31.000]  the next but Ireland commissioner says most EU countries would reject Lisbon
[18:31.000 --> 18:36.760]  Treaty Ireland's EU Commissioner Charlie McGreevy has concluded that voters in
[18:36.760 --> 18:42.160]  most EU countries would reject the stalled Lisbon Treaty that matter they're
[18:42.160 --> 18:46.200]  just implementing it through executive fiat and now even telling the states
[18:46.200 --> 18:49.560]  that they have no control it's all the European Parliament which is a
[18:49.560 --> 18:57.320]  dictatorship his admission came as Brian Cohen the Irish Prime Minister was
[18:57.320 --> 19:01.320]  sent to announce the October 2nd as the date when Ireland holds its second
[19:01.320 --> 19:06.280]  referendum on the document that's right of course here we just have electronic
[19:06.280 --> 19:11.040]  voting machines since they killed Kennedy in 63 that's when voter news
[19:11.040 --> 19:13.920]  services took over they started feeding the ballots into computers for
[19:13.920 --> 19:18.320]  tabulation it didn't matter what exit poll showed anymore you know here it
[19:18.320 --> 19:22.680]  didn't matter if we vote that stuff down just they don't even care it's like
[19:22.680 --> 19:30.880]  because we're known as the idiots of the world we're known as well in the
[19:30.880 --> 19:38.520]  pimp game as the bitch hoes to use the term who will put up with anything the
[19:38.520 --> 19:43.560]  treaty which proposes the first time president of the European Council is
[19:43.560 --> 19:47.600]  highly contentious and was rejected by the Irish referendum of June of last
[19:47.600 --> 19:53.360]  year but current opinion polls suggest the Irish will vote yes this time yeah
[19:53.360 --> 20:01.480]  more fake polls more baloney more mass psychology with a ride back in the new

[24:20.120 --> 24:28.200]  AP report National Guard to seek volunteers for the border Rick Perry's
[24:28.200 --> 24:33.120]  done this George Bush did this there they constantly every year do a stunt
[24:33.120 --> 24:38.280]  where they take a rotation of guard one thousand five hundreds what they've done
[24:38.280 --> 24:44.520]  the last three or four times I've seen them do this and they take them and they
[24:44.520 --> 24:48.520]  stick them down on the border usually about 20 miles off the border and they
[24:48.520 --> 24:52.920]  have them run checkpoints on the highway searching people's cars and the troops
[24:52.920 --> 24:56.960]  aren't allowed to have any bullets in their m16s and the Mexican troops shoot
[24:56.960 --> 25:01.920]  at them and chase them off that's been in the news and so basically it's a drill
[25:01.920 --> 25:06.160]  taking our troops down there to teach them how to turn tail and run and show
[25:06.160 --> 25:12.320]  the show the white flag or like a white tailed deer running away throwing up
[25:12.320 --> 25:16.240]  their white tail I mean that's basically about what goes on so that'll be another
[25:16.240 --> 25:21.760]  stunt for Obama more deception more lies this whole climate change bill allows
[25:21.760 --> 25:25.800]  the federal government if it passes the Senate under international treaties to do
[25:25.800 --> 25:33.520]  whatever they want it's a blank check to home inspections regulate power plants
[25:33.520 --> 25:38.960]  gasoline oil plastic your homes businesses factories everything it's a
[25:38.960 --> 25:44.640]  blank check anything that puts off carbon and it'll tell you what type of
[25:44.640 --> 25:47.240]  windows to use in your house what type of construction what type of
[25:47.240 --> 25:53.600]  architecture what type of lighting well here is the Associated Press again
[25:53.600 --> 25:57.720]  White House announces new lighting standards and they say that the White
[25:57.720 --> 26:11.880]  House is going to pass efficiency standards for lamps and light bulbs and
[26:11.880 --> 26:19.040]  it goes on and on but let me just read part of this article aiming to keep the
[26:19.040 --> 26:25.480]  focus on climate change legislation which is a total fraud there is no unnatural
[26:25.480 --> 26:29.240]  climate change it's unless you're talking about all the terraforming they're
[26:29.240 --> 26:32.560]  doing in their secret projects that nobody will talk about President Barack
[26:32.560 --> 26:37.560]  Obama put a plug in for the administration's efforts to make lamps and
[26:37.560 --> 26:43.400]  lighting equipment use less energy but again sounds reasonable but it sets the
[26:43.400 --> 26:48.680]  precedent for the federal government to tell you what to do how to live what type
[26:48.680 --> 26:52.120]  of washer and dryer you can have what type of dishwasher you can have what
[26:52.120 --> 26:55.720]  type of light bulbs you can have what type of windows you can have what type
[26:55.720 --> 27:03.240]  of insulation you can have what type of car you can have it's total control it
[27:03.240 --> 27:11.280]  sets that precedent what type of toilet you can have I know light bulbs may not
[27:11.280 --> 27:17.720]  seem sexy well no actually those mercury based light bulbs you've made the light
[27:17.720 --> 27:28.120]  bulb companies adopt they're phasing out all the nice phosphorescence and going
[27:28.120 --> 27:36.160]  to the green headache light bulbs you have to call a toxic waste removal
[27:36.160 --> 27:40.120]  company of one breaks in your house I mean it's totally deadly and all the
[27:40.120 --> 27:46.240]  studies show it's deadly but they don't care all they care about is setting the
[27:46.240 --> 27:49.800]  precedence and make you submit to what they say and do it's like when the
[27:49.800 --> 27:55.520]  government 20 years ago made all the states put MBTE deadly gas additive that
[27:55.520 --> 28:01.680]  deforms fish and frogs and toads and hurts humans and absolutely causes
[28:01.680 --> 28:07.760]  cancer in all water supplies now because for 20 years they put it in the fuel now
[28:07.760 --> 28:13.600]  they've taken it out some company comes in lobbies chemical companies just make
[28:13.600 --> 28:20.840]  them put MBTE in the gas and they do it they make a close to a trillion bucks
[28:20.840 --> 28:26.760]  over 20 years hey good business I know light bulbs may not be sexy but this
[28:26.760 --> 28:31.640]  simple action holds enormous promise because 7% of all the energy consumed
[28:31.640 --> 28:36.160]  in America is used to light our homes and businesses the president said
[28:36.160 --> 28:40.760]  standing alongside energy secretary Steven Chu at the lighthouse Obama said
[28:40.760 --> 28:46.920]  the new efficiency standards he was announcing so he's announcing he's the
[28:46.920 --> 28:52.040]  dictator the decider for lamps would result in substantial savings between
[28:52.040 --> 28:58.360]  2012 and 2042 saving consumers to 4 billion annually oh yes conserving
[28:58.360 --> 29:03.040]  enough energy to power every US home for 10 months reducing emissions equal to the
[29:03.040 --> 29:08.520]  amount produced by 166 million cars a year and limiting the need for as many as
[29:08.520 --> 29:13.920]  14 coal powered plants so see the message here is we got to have less
[29:13.920 --> 29:19.040]  development is bad and then I've got the Royal Commission on population I have
[29:19.040 --> 29:22.560]  the State Department random 200 where they all say they're gonna shut the
[29:22.560 --> 29:26.520]  power off and the food supply off and tax you at such a high rate you can't
[29:26.520 --> 29:30.800]  afford to have any children and so this is all about its eugenics they're
[29:30.800 --> 29:34.440]  turning the power off they get you under their control in an industrialized
[29:34.440 --> 29:39.120]  society do everything they can to get you addicted to industry and then they
[29:39.120 --> 29:43.680]  start seizing the industry and shutting it down that's what more a strong says
[29:43.680 --> 29:47.120]  they're gonna do so you can't have children and that's a quote from him
[29:47.120 --> 29:55.840]  stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[32:08.440 --> 32:12.400]  a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and

[32:15.680 --> 32:20.120]  job security you are always in danger of losing your job unless you take

[33:45.680 --> 33:52.160]  like such as in South Africa and Iraq everywhere like such as and I believe
[33:52.160 --> 33:58.320]  that they should our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S. or
[33:58.320 --> 34:03.560]  should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries so we
[34:03.560 --> 34:08.160]  will be able to build up our future for our children. Thank you very much South
[34:08.160 --> 34:16.840]  Carolina and you know why she can't talk can't speak because all she does is
[34:16.840 --> 34:22.400]  watch television and pop culture from the time she was in diapers and that's
[34:22.400 --> 34:26.760]  what the American people have turned into and they are the army that the new
[34:26.760 --> 34:32.520]  world order is going to use to take over the planet. Of course the question was
[34:32.520 --> 34:37.120]  why can't the majority of Americans find Iraq on a map and you found out why
[34:37.120 --> 34:42.840]  she said we need to help them such as and South Africa learning help them
[34:42.840 --> 34:47.080]  because she has this image of she's the God person she's the American she's a
[34:47.080 --> 34:52.080]  genius everybody else are knuckle-dragging idiots when she is the
[34:52.080 --> 35:00.160]  knuckle-dragging idiot that I bet she knows all about Paris Hilton I bet she
[35:00.160 --> 35:05.120]  knows all about Twitter I bet she knows all about how to apply lipstick
[35:05.120 --> 35:10.880]  properly and she'll have kids with some rich guy and the kids will be on Pro
[35:10.880 --> 35:18.680]  Zack and Ritalin and you know end up having some horrible future because
[35:18.680 --> 35:23.240]  she's one of the more well-to-do women most the young girls growing up see her
[35:23.240 --> 35:27.640]  as an idol as an icon they're gonna end up basically being hookers in the world
[35:27.640 --> 35:33.360]  sex industry you know that's the big growth industry that's what the largest
[35:33.360 --> 35:40.440]  portion of American girls become now is horse from land of the free and home of
[35:40.440 --> 35:50.040]  the brave to land of the dumb down prostitutes the slaves and if we admit
[35:50.040 --> 35:53.960]  how far our nation has fallen if we admit how we've been conned and screwed
[35:53.960 --> 35:57.560]  and lied to and if we admit we don't know how the world works and we're
[35:57.560 --> 36:03.440]  ignorant then we can set about improving ourselves myself included but if we
[36:03.440 --> 36:06.920]  don't it's just gonna get worse and worse and worse in this managed economy
[36:06.920 --> 36:11.520]  and the dumb down mass are going to be used as a weapon against the middle
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.200]  class and property owners and business owners and people that aren't dumb down
[36:16.200 --> 36:20.280]  and people that have made something of themselves because the establishment is
[36:20.280 --> 36:25.240]  hiring millions of these dumb down ne'er-do-wells every year who were on
[36:25.240 --> 36:29.080]  little petty power trips and turning them loose against the general public
[36:29.080 --> 36:34.360]  and they're converting the entire economy into a giant police state
[36:34.360 --> 36:37.360]  control grid
[36:44.520 --> 36:52.600]  that's how this system works we have fallen a long way so I'll get more into
[36:52.600 --> 36:55.920]  that coming up but dealing with White House announces new lighting standards
[36:55.920 --> 37:00.880]  for not just the type of live bulbs you could have but now the type of power this
[37:00.880 --> 37:05.400]  is federal zoning that can go into the lamp what type of lamp you can have
[37:05.400 --> 37:10.480]  itself where you don't have a choice you've got to use the light bulbs they
[37:10.480 --> 37:14.600]  prescribe and then of course the federal standards will only be with a certain
[37:14.600 --> 37:19.120]  global company that puts out a certain type of light bulb because only that one
[37:19.120 --> 37:22.240]  type of light bulb will fit the certain socket and there'll be a patent on that
[37:22.240 --> 37:27.160]  socket this is all about an organized economy where everything is controlled
[37:27.160 --> 37:31.360]  everything is vertically integrated where the resources are artificially
[37:31.360 --> 37:36.360]  reduced until you can't survive you can't live that's why they want the
[37:36.360 --> 37:39.920]  illegal aliens there that's what the illegal aliens are above the law is you
[37:39.920 --> 37:45.040]  can't run them off they got to break the bank bankrupt the states with welfare
[37:45.040 --> 37:51.440]  they've got to break the middle class by lowering the wages where if you're in
[37:51.440 --> 37:56.240]  the system paying taxes you can't survive the globalist can create all the
[37:56.240 --> 38:00.080]  fiat currency they want to fund their government operation they tax you to
[38:00.080 --> 38:07.160]  control you so do they say oh we've got great new light bulbs or open up
[38:07.160 --> 38:14.640]  innovation and just have people adopt systems that do save energy no it's
[38:14.640 --> 38:23.320]  about making you adopt systems that they control by the way every day I see
[38:23.320 --> 38:30.080]  news articles like this one that was from Yahoo news the cover charge at the
[38:30.080 --> 38:37.240]  club an RFID implant it works for Fido so why not for you that's the line that
[38:37.240 --> 38:40.680]  Tommy Thompson when he traveled to high schools across the country telling kids
[38:40.680 --> 38:43.920]  middle schools and high schools they needed to take implantable chips to be
[38:43.920 --> 38:47.000]  safe and then now they have national studies saying what's the number one
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.880]  fear of children that they'll be kidnapped even though there are thousands
[38:50.880 --> 38:55.960]  of times more likely to be hit by a car or drowned but see the teachers and the
[38:55.960 --> 39:00.760]  feds all scare them and tell them you got to take chips the same RFID implants
[39:00.760 --> 39:07.240]  use identifying lost pets are now being adapted for use on you and me and not
[39:07.240 --> 39:11.320]  how one might have originally expected as with all pioneering technologies it's
[39:11.320 --> 39:16.960]  leisure pursuits that are getting the first stab at the tech and yes if you
[39:16.960 --> 39:22.040]  read the army's own report from 68 declassified in 2000 picked up by the
[39:22.040 --> 39:31.480]  Federation American scientist in my book dissent and deterring 2002 as you go to
[39:31.480 --> 39:36.240]  the army's own sites and read this they say that the entire population by 2025
[39:36.240 --> 39:42.320]  will have implantable tracker chips with radio identification devices this is in
[39:42.320 --> 39:50.600]  the 60s they charted our future and that they would do it by having the elderly
[39:50.600 --> 39:56.840]  have them who were senile was the term they use they hadn't yet put all the
[39:56.840 --> 40:02.200]  heavy metals in our food so you'd get all cybers when you're 20 as large part
[40:02.200 --> 40:06.320]  of the population now as they go that's normal oh look these CAT scans their
[40:06.320 --> 40:11.840]  brains are full of mercury lead and aluminum doesn't matter have more you
[40:11.840 --> 40:19.120]  know they cut the haircare products the deodorants the the foods filled with it
[40:19.120 --> 40:26.680]  oh it's good the eugenicist and now the public's like Miss South Carolina let's
[40:26.680 --> 40:34.760]  play a fluoride head a brain filled with heavy metals also also in living her
[40:34.760 --> 40:40.080]  life in front of a TV set never even thinking about that she's on a planet or
[40:40.080 --> 40:44.440]  how the world operates or where power comes from or where food comes from or
[40:44.440 --> 40:49.440]  where shelter comes from just did silly dingley going through life like it's all
[40:49.440 --> 40:58.160]  a big shopping mall why do you think this is I personally believe that yes
[40:58.160 --> 41:05.880]  Americans are unable to do so because some people out there in our nation don't
[41:05.880 --> 41:11.440]  have bounce and I believe that our education like such as in South Africa
[41:11.440 --> 41:19.000]  and Iraq everywhere like such as and I believe that they should our education
[41:19.000 --> 41:24.600]  over here in the US should help the US or should help South Africa it should
[41:24.600 --> 41:29.360]  help die rack in the Asian countries so we will be able to build up our future
[41:29.360 --> 41:36.640]  thank you very much thank you very much good job we've devastated her mind by
[41:36.640 --> 41:40.560]  the way the feds have federal standards for testing we've had the former head of
[41:40.560 --> 41:43.760]  policy Department of Education on Charlotte-Israeby she produced a book the
[41:43.760 --> 41:47.760]  size of the Dallas phone book that we sell at info wars dot com about half of
[41:47.760 --> 41:52.600]  it is documents actual government documents that the federal testing is
[41:52.600 --> 41:56.000]  to gauge how much they've dumbed you down that's why they always increase the
[41:56.000 --> 42:04.640]  funding when the test scores drop and then the population is even stupider it's
[42:04.640 --> 42:10.440]  designed to dumb you down it's all and that's why all the public knows is
[42:10.440 --> 42:15.200]  greed and envy and that they want your house in your car and the government's
[42:15.200 --> 42:19.400]  gonna give them a job to come take it that's all they know they're like pig
[42:19.400 --> 42:24.360]  demons out there running around rooting around for truffles but the truffles are
[42:24.360 --> 42:33.120]  your life your money your dreams giant herds of of hogs just snuffling and
[42:33.120 --> 42:41.160]  gruffling and digging around mindlessly and squealing it's like a dangerous
[42:41.160 --> 42:46.720]  stampede of elephants on PCP or something running us off the edge of a
[42:46.720 --> 42:55.200]  cliff being driven by their masters the ring rates and so it goes into how to
[42:55.200 --> 42:58.240]  get into the best topless bars and get into the best clubs where all the
[42:58.240 --> 43:02.880]  trendies go and what these clubs do is they go hire petty celebrities to come
[43:02.880 --> 43:09.080]  there and be there on the weekends and stand up on top stages and just everybody
[43:09.080 --> 43:13.760]  wants to go and then feel big and feel important just like cockatoos will fight
[43:13.760 --> 43:19.360]  to the death sometimes to see which one gets to sit the highest up in the tree
[43:19.360 --> 43:22.400]  you know I've been in some of the hottest clubs in the country the few times
[43:22.400 --> 43:28.040]  about in California or Las Vegas and get invited by people there and they'll
[43:28.040 --> 43:32.400]  sit there with bouncers taking you level after level up to the you know highest
[43:32.400 --> 43:35.840]  stage in the bar and everyone's just looking at you up there with the
[43:35.840 --> 43:40.240]  celebrities like like like you're on Mount Olympus and all I can think is how
[43:40.240 --> 43:44.360]  in the world did I get here I want to get out of here I wish I was out on a
[43:44.360 --> 43:48.320]  bass boat somewhere looking into the beautiful green blue water and watching
[43:48.320 --> 43:53.080]  fish and minnows race around the bottom and you know watch a group of deer come
[43:53.080 --> 43:58.760]  out and drink at sunset or at dawn I'm thinking this is hell take me to the
[43:58.760 --> 44:05.880]  Caribbean I want to skin dive down 30 feet you know the secret to skin diving
[44:05.880 --> 44:09.880]  is when you go down below about 20 feet it pressurizes your lungs and forces
[44:09.880 --> 44:15.200]  masses of oxygen out of your lungs that that you have all these little airbags
[44:15.200 --> 44:20.960]  in your lungs little tiny airbags and so when you bring air in it usually takes
[44:20.960 --> 44:25.080]  four or five breaths to cycle in the air and out the air when you take a big
[44:25.080 --> 44:29.600]  breath though and go down below 20 feet it pressurizes your lungs and then
[44:29.600 --> 44:34.720]  forces all that air out into your bloodstream and also pressurizes the blood
[44:34.720 --> 44:39.560]  somehow to where you get super oxygenated you're like boosted you just make
[44:39.560 --> 44:42.920]  yourself go down about 30 feet it's like whoa I think it's been a minute or so
[44:42.920 --> 44:46.640]  down there it's unbelievable but you got to get yourself psyched up to get past
[44:46.640 --> 44:56.920]  the mental tick almost or or or reflex to want to have air it's anyways I'm
[44:56.920 --> 45:00.120]  still see I'm dreaming I'm dreaming about being on the ocean floor with no
[45:00.120 --> 45:08.240]  tanks side issue the point here is ladies and gentlemen that I'm in hell
[45:08.240 --> 45:13.000]  with the beating music and all these you know gorgeous women you know number
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.280]  tens all around you the few times I've been drug out the clubs by celebrity
[45:17.280 --> 45:22.880]  friends and the music's beating the lights are flashing and these things are
[45:22.880 --> 45:27.600]  all set up the same where they lead the VIPs up to the higher levels but you know
[45:27.600 --> 45:31.480]  that's VIPs that are actually just out wanting to have a few drinks they have
[45:31.480 --> 45:36.240]  these petty celebrities that go to these other clubs and the local trendies will
[45:36.240 --> 45:41.240]  do anything to get into them to feel like their celebrity so they will be
[45:41.240 --> 45:45.560]  injected with chips and that's what the Pentagon said in 68 they said for
[45:45.560 --> 45:48.880]  security reasons we can get make government people take chips military
[45:48.880 --> 45:55.080]  take chips we can have the senile take chips prisoners take chips and we'll
[45:55.080 --> 46:02.080]  make it about security for wealthy people and trendiness VIP see they make it
[46:02.080 --> 46:06.360]  trendy they can make I guarantee you they had big stars get up on TV for a
[46:06.360 --> 46:09.440]  year or two and say splitting your throat is wonderful that you would see
[46:09.440 --> 46:12.240]  young people splitting their throats because that's the cool thing to do
[46:12.240 --> 46:16.640]  literally I mean the feds did death education starting nationwide in the
[46:16.640 --> 46:20.040]  early 90s where they put kids and mock coffins and teach them how to die and
[46:20.040 --> 46:23.240]  roll them up in blankets and tell them don't commit suicide this is what it's
[46:23.240 --> 46:27.280]  like don't take you know all these pills did you know you could take normal
[46:27.280 --> 46:30.680]  pills and kill yourself and the kids go home and do it kind of like the dare
[46:30.680 --> 46:34.000]  program increased drug use that was proven in studies because they go this
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.600]  is marijuana this is how you smoke it makes you feel really good don't do it
[46:38.600 --> 46:45.320]  this is cocaine this is speed this is the type of place you buy it everybody I
[46:45.320 --> 46:48.960]  talked to says they were sitting there in class going well I remember sex
[46:48.960 --> 46:55.000]  education in the eighth grade remember sitting there looking at the girls next
[46:55.000 --> 47:01.680]  to me on hmm the girls looking over me hmm and then just immediately we all went
[47:01.680 --> 47:07.080]  out and went out on dates and had sex eighth ninth grade I mean that's how it
[47:07.080 --> 47:13.120]  works and they know that they're not stupid in this death education they
[47:13.120 --> 47:18.000]  teach people yeah you can even take your shoelaces and go in a bathroom stall
[47:18.000 --> 47:21.640]  and tie it around the edge of the door and hang yourself and the little girls
[47:21.640 --> 47:26.600]  go and kill themselves five minutes later you know don't don't hang yourself
[47:26.600 --> 47:31.600]  when you're depressed and they think oh they go hang themselves almost no
[47:31.600 --> 47:36.280]  suicide now it's prolific it's all eugenics teaching you how to kill
[47:36.280 --> 47:39.480]  yourselves that's why they promote homosexuality because they don't want
[47:39.480 --> 47:43.880]  you having kids go to the cover page at least last week of Planned Parenthood
[47:43.880 --> 47:48.040]  it's all about same-sex marriage and I'm not attacking people that are doing
[47:48.040 --> 47:52.520]  their same-sex marriage or people that are gay or whatever I don't hate you I'm
[47:52.520 --> 47:57.680]  not out to get you I don't mean particularly care the issue is that
[47:57.680 --> 48:04.160]  you are the eugenics apple of their eye they like what you're doing and they
[48:04.160 --> 48:07.800]  want you to then go out and attack heterosexuals and persecute us and you
[48:07.800 --> 48:12.560]  see PS to grab people's kids to then supply you with with adopted children
[48:12.560 --> 48:15.760]  that's what I don't like about you I don't like that your culture doesn't
[48:15.760 --> 48:22.480]  produce children so you got to come Rob ours so you're like oh let me have my
[48:22.480 --> 48:25.400]  rights I just want to do what I want you're in my own bedroom go ahead I'm
[48:25.400 --> 48:30.480]  you know I'm not obsessed with that I'm not hung up on with that like all the
[48:30.480 --> 48:33.920]  fake Republican leaders who are all constantly caught in bathrooms are trying
[48:33.920 --> 48:43.600]  to bugger children I don't you know I'm not obsessed and hung up on it but I do
[48:43.600 --> 48:47.040]  know that almost every family court judge I've studied in the country that
[48:47.040 --> 48:55.960]  sees his kids is a lesbian or a gay man and they feed the kids to the child
[48:55.960 --> 48:59.440]  protection system that are then given to gay and lesbian families and I'm
[48:59.440 --> 49:05.040]  telling you your head hunting of children is bad news and very very wicked
[49:05.040 --> 49:09.960]  and I you know what you're committing a crime and you need to face up to the fact
[49:09.960 --> 49:15.120]  that you don't reproduce so decide that you're not going to have children or if
[49:15.120 --> 49:18.480]  you're gonna go out and get somebody to donate sperm to you than more power to
[49:18.480 --> 49:23.800]  you but don't sit there and kidnap kids all day what you're doing is wrong it
[49:23.800 --> 49:29.480]  needs to be talked about but anyway side issue you give up on reproduction which
[49:29.480 --> 49:34.360]  is what the whole point of the species is is to forward the species people say
[49:34.360 --> 49:39.200]  well you know that's primitive mind and that's what we are it's what we do we
[49:39.200 --> 49:43.440]  are what we are it is what it is
[49:45.720 --> 49:53.520]  comprended I've already digressed specifically one beach oriented
[49:53.520 --> 49:58.200]  Barcelona nightclub the Baja Club they go on in Florida too is using the
[49:58.200 --> 50:03.120]  implants to free customers from burdens oh it frees you to have a tracking chip
[50:03.120 --> 50:07.600]  of having to carry their purses and wallets make sense when you're spending
[50:07.600 --> 50:12.720]  the day in a bikini and flip flops where do you keep your ID so you don't think
[50:12.720 --> 50:17.960]  about anything just enjoy yourself drink the tap water take the inoculation
[50:17.960 --> 50:25.160]  just enjoy yourselves don't think about anything take the chip it frees you you
[50:25.160 --> 50:31.120]  get to get into the top area of the club with the wink wink bimbos instead the
[50:31.120 --> 50:36.040]  bouncer just scans your arm with an RFID reader and you're in and since you can't
[50:36.040 --> 50:40.920]  carry a credit card or cash either the implants do double-duty and it goes in
[50:40.920 --> 50:44.800]  to how great it is see constantly pushing how you got to have it and then we
[50:44.800 --> 50:47.600]  say oh by the way we don't want the government to make us take chips they
[50:47.600 --> 50:53.800]  go you insane schizophrenic there's no plan to make anybody take chips yeah
[50:53.800 --> 50:58.840]  they've just already implanted most of special forces

[54:27.240 --> 54:52.680]  I want to play this clip from the today show from back in late May and I've got
[54:52.680 --> 55:00.960]  Fox and CNN and CNBC and BBC but I'm just gonna play one of them because every
[55:00.960 --> 55:05.040]  time I get up on the radio and I read mainstream news articles where the
[55:05.040 --> 55:09.880]  government says they're preparing to forcibly inoculate the people of the
[55:09.880 --> 55:14.760]  United States the UK Canada Europe coming up in the fall now that doesn't
[55:14.760 --> 55:19.040]  mean they're going to do it but they've implemented level 6 now I told you this
[55:19.040 --> 55:24.640]  back in April now it's public but since then they've been getting everybody
[55:24.640 --> 55:27.560]  ready in the last month or forced inoculations and even using the term
[55:27.560 --> 55:35.160]  martial law on Fox and CNN now this is total hype I mean this flu has killed
[55:35.160 --> 55:41.640]  less than 50 people regular flu kills 37,000 a year now I think that's an
[55:41.640 --> 55:44.600]  exaggerated number they kind of use that as a cover for a lot of old people that
[55:44.600 --> 55:48.800]  just die of being old but the point is this flu is nothing unless they're
[55:48.800 --> 55:53.040]  going to release something else that's a mutation of it that they're going to
[55:53.040 --> 55:57.600]  claim was naturally occurring we know this flu is engineered we know they're
[55:57.600 --> 56:03.840]  really gearing up for a martial law takeover using a flu outbreak a pandemic
[56:03.840 --> 56:08.000]  as the cover and they've engaged level 6 which means forced quarantine forced
[56:08.000 --> 56:13.000]  inoculations martial law I've read the executive order on air day after day
[56:13.000 --> 56:21.720]  fact here is the executive order I had it my stack I'll find it in a minute it's
[56:21.720 --> 56:30.320]  13,300 and something the point is here is mainstream television what the
[56:30.320 --> 56:35.560]  today's show where they're saying the same thing here it is that the Obama
[56:35.560 --> 56:38.880]  administration is considering implementing a new fall vaccination program
[56:38.880 --> 56:43.800]  against the flu a plan that would require Americans to get not one not two but
[56:43.800 --> 56:48.160]  three flu shots dr. Nancy's not a minute as NBC's chief medical editor Nancy
[56:48.160 --> 56:52.040]  good morning I'm very unprecedented this is how would this work well here's the
[56:52.040 --> 56:56.920]  idea on the first Saturday when we knew swine flu was an issue the Centers for
[56:56.920 --> 57:00.560]  Disease Control held a conference and we were already talking with those of us
[57:00.560 --> 57:05.680]  who listened in about how you can ramp up manufacturing this new vaccine on top
[57:05.680 --> 57:08.880]  of the old vaccine it's a lot of time right about five months and the decision
[57:08.880 --> 57:12.080]  was made if we're going to get the normal flu vaccine to the general public in
[57:12.080 --> 57:16.720]  the fall to hold it up while we figure out the swine flu was perhaps going to
[57:16.720 --> 57:21.040]  put the entire population at risk so at that moment the decision was made we
[57:21.040 --> 57:26.000]  will go into normal flu production for the normal vaccine like it like it is
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.240]  figure out this right for seasonal flu figure out what the swine flu really is
[57:30.240 --> 57:34.040]  and then perhaps tag team a second vaccine on top of it that's why they
[57:34.040 --> 57:37.600]  didn't combine them into one shot but why two additional shots for swine flu
[57:37.600 --> 57:40.960]  for the normal seasonal flu that you and I talk about every year there's a herd
[57:40.960 --> 57:47.160]  immunity to some extent that's enough shot now they call us a herd the herd
[57:47.160 --> 57:51.800]  immunity and it just goes on but see how they slip that in you will be required
[57:51.800 --> 58:02.960]  you will have to the executive orders 13,375 13,375 and their continuity of
[58:02.960 --> 58:08.120]  government martial law takeover grid needs an excuse and in the fall you're
[58:08.120 --> 58:12.160]  going to have the new Bank of the World being openly set up taking over the US
[58:12.160 --> 58:17.040]  that bills introduced all the other legislation going through you won't care
[58:17.040 --> 58:19.760]  as long as they're fear mongering if they go ahead and legalize all the
[58:19.760 --> 58:23.720]  illegals and everything else because they're going to be fear mongering using
[58:23.720 --> 58:27.400]  this as a smoke screen it'll make the Michael Jackson distraction and
[58:27.400 --> 58:33.000]  diversion pale and significance so there you have it we're going to come back
[58:33.000 --> 58:36.520]  hit some other news and we got a climatologist coming on about what's
[58:36.520 --> 58:41.760]  really going on with so-called manmade global warming stay with us thank you
[58:41.760 --> 58:52.160]  for listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today this is Alex Jones with five good
[58:52.160 --> 58:55.960]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer number
[58:55.960 --> 58:59.480]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.480 --> 59:04.160]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:04.160 --> 59:08.320]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[59:08.320 --> 59:12.600]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:12.600 --> 59:15.920]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded especially with the high
[59:15.920 --> 59:19.320]  demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane and dangerous summer
[59:19.320 --> 59:22.800]  storm season is here again every year thousands of families lose their power
[59:22.800 --> 59:26.960]  from weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides
[59:26.960 --> 59:30.800]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[59:30.800 --> 59:34.600]  power generators offered by solution from science a longtime sponsor of ours

[59:57.440 --> 1:00:00.600]  radio network
[1:00:04.280 --> 1:00:12.040]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:19.560]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:42.920]  Alex Jones we're going live at prisonplanet.tv 8 after when we start the
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:51.880]  next segment so stay with us for that but we're just going through life like
[1:00:51.880 --> 1:01:00.160]  we're in some type of days there are real serious environmental crises going
[1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:07.600]  on there are thousands of genetic engineering firms that are open-air
[1:01:07.600 --> 1:01:13.160]  testing pharmacological cross species crops crops that have human DNA animal
[1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:18.680]  DNA insect DNA some of these crops have over a hundred different organisms in
[1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:26.000]  them which causes DNA bleeding mutations each generation it gives rise to
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:31.720]  super viruses super bacteria we're already seeing bizarre forms of fungus
[1:01:31.720 --> 1:01:36.400]  that has never been recorded to eat living flesh is now eating living flesh
[1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:43.920]  it's wiping out whole bat colonies white nose bat the bats are being killed by
[1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:50.240]  the white nose syndrome there is just all sorts of insane stuff going on there
[1:01:50.240 --> 1:01:55.600]  are genetically modified corn plants and wheat plants and canola jumping into
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:02:00.320]  oak trees I mean this is in the news it's wiping the bees out confirmed
[1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:07.480]  German British Dutch Russian studies Chinese studies on honeybees the
[1:02:07.480 --> 1:02:16.200]  unifying factor is the honeybees have the BT corn pesticide in their tummies
[1:02:16.760 --> 1:02:21.680]  because they genetically engineer the crop the corn to have it its
[1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:33.040]  pollination have a live pesticide in it that's produced by a fungus now they
[1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:36.320]  argue well this fungus is already occurring in plants yes at about a
[1:02:36.320 --> 1:02:40.160]  thousand times less that strength see that's only one little point I'm making
[1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:44.040]  it's thousands of these I know about I mean listen you
[1:02:44.040 --> 1:02:48.280]  environmentalist want to freak out about something genetic engineering but see
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:51.880]  that's something legitimate have you heard some call for governmental control
[1:02:51.880 --> 1:03:00.000]  and hearings and no serious controls on genetic engineering but see the elites
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.600]  are all 89 years old they don't want to die so they're just do whatever you got
[1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:09.640]  to you know grow livers inside cows for humans grow humanoids inside the
[1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:14.680]  uterus of cows take the clones put them in the cow so you can you know grow the
[1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:21.480]  child up larger so I can get a proper size liver number 10 years ago BBC now
[1:03:21.480 --> 1:03:26.920]  they were growing human embryos and cows and you know that's just the stuff they
[1:03:26.920 --> 1:03:32.040]  admit you imagine what's off record all of this going on all of this threatening
[1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:36.040]  the environment all of this threatening our planet all of this violating the
[1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:40.600]  very fabric of the genetic color of the planet they're not going to do anything
[1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:45.320]  about it they're going to put a tax on carbon dioxide that plants breathe it is
[1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:54.160]  the sickest most degenerate joke you can imagine because the elites are racing
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:59.720]  to not die and the scientists the mad scientist are saying let us do any
[1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:03.120]  scientific tests anything we want to do and we'll be able to get you to life
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:07.320]  extension and we'll be able to extend it out another 30 40 years and by then we'll
[1:04:07.320 --> 1:04:10.520]  be able to keep you alive indefinitely and they're openly bragging about this
[1:04:10.520 --> 1:04:13.640]  and government white papers we've sourced and covered and gone over in my
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:18.680]  film in game but how are they going to keep the general public from having
[1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:24.200]  access to all of this neo feudalism the environmental cult religion the carbon
[1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:32.520]  tax and it is now here upon us it is now happening and you better grow up folks
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:38.760]  and stop caring about Paris Hilton and Michael Jackson and start realizing just
[1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:43.520]  how serious this really is
[1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:51.120]  we'll be right back with our guest on the other side of this quick break I'm

[1:08:19.800 --> 1:08:23.240]  Alex Jones
[1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:45.000]  we are simulcasting the syndicated radio transmission at prisonplanet.tv
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:52.120]  today thank you so much for joining us and we are now eight minutes into the
[1:08:52.120 --> 1:08:58.200]  second hour today Dr. Tim Ball is a climatologist PhD retired university
[1:08:58.200 --> 1:09:02.960]  professor in global warming skeptic he heads the natural resources stewardship
[1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:07.360]  project as the former head of friends of science a non-profit organization of
[1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:14.640]  those are skeptical of human cause global warming and Dr. Ball I would just
[1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:26.200]  add for all of the viewers out there can speak to the fact that 37,000
[1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:33.360]  scientists wrote a letter to the Congress and they signed a petition saying
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:38.360]  man-made global warming is an absolute fraud and to that Al Gore being questioned
[1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:42.200]  a month ago said oh and I'm sure that they believe we didn't land on the moon
[1:09:42.200 --> 1:09:46.080]  either these are conspiracy theorists well you're not a scientist Al Gore
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:50.600]  you're a con artist that owns the major carbon trading company also own a
[1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:53.840]  controlling share in Occidental petroleum you're an oil man you're a
[1:09:53.840 --> 1:09:57.920]  hypocrite the big energy companies are behind this as well this is a way to
[1:09:57.920 --> 1:10:02.480]  rape the people put us into neo feudalism and control the resources this is a
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:08.080]  vertical integration of society to say that man-made global warming is real is
[1:10:08.080 --> 1:10:12.040]  to say that Al Gore invented the internet I mean that arrogant person in the
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:18.640]  early 90s said he invented the internet which in no literature anywhere it's
[1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:23.040]  well known that DARPA and also some British scientists I mean I mean they're
[1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:27.480]  credited in the encyclopedia for inventing the internet in the 60s my
[1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:32.160]  father was at UT in the 60s when they were he knew some of the research
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:35.560]  departments that were you know talking about the internet before it had that
[1:10:35.560 --> 1:10:41.920]  name computerized data transfer systems over phone lines in case of nuclear war
[1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:48.040]  I mean this is like saying Al Gore discovered that the earth is round and
[1:10:48.040 --> 1:10:53.320]  not Copernicus it's like saying Al Gore discovered dynamite and and not no
[1:10:53.320 --> 1:11:02.600]  Nobel it is just he is a con artist of the highest order and the science of the
[1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:06.120]  we've probably interviewed over a hundred climatologists physicists here on
[1:11:06.120 --> 1:11:10.760]  air the fact is the vast majority say it's a total fraud only research
[1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:16.200]  scientists who are on government or environmental group land grabbing group
[1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:19.920]  payroll come out and say it's real and they've been caught mainstream news
[1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:24.920]  fixing the buoy data lying and saying that buoys and weather stations showed
[1:11:24.920 --> 1:11:29.520]  record heat in Siberia or a record heat in Africa turned out we've had record
[1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:36.480]  cold but school kids are now being taught that seasons are unnatural even so
[1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:41.360]  this is very and that Al Gore says we need to terraform the planet because now
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:46.240]  they're not saying global warming anymore because that's been proven to be a
[1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:49.200]  fraud then it was climate change but people go well wait climate change the
[1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:53.240]  normal cycle now the PR firms have come out in the New York Times and said the
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:58.120]  White House has ordered everybody to say deteriorating atmosphere now they
[1:11:58.120 --> 1:12:01.680]  actually brought some truth out and we're gonna go to the professor because
[1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:05.240]  according to climatologists we've interviewed the earth is in a very low
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:10.560]  carbon dioxide oxygen level according to the different bog samples they've
[1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:13.640]  gotten from hundreds of thousands of years ago ice core samples and that
[1:12:13.640 --> 1:12:18.200]  plants and animals like higher carbon dioxide and oxygen but that's
[1:12:18.200 --> 1:12:22.520]  biologists we've had on on that subject dr. Tim ball climatologists joins us
[1:12:22.520 --> 1:12:26.680]  just an amazing researcher and we're honored to have him for the next 40
[1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:31.160]  45 minutes thank you for coming on sir well thanks for the opportunity and by
[1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:35.240]  the way Alex they've switched also but they went and I call it moving the
[1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:39.880]  goalposts as you said global warming when they discovered that the
[1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:44.000]  temperatures were going down but the CO2 was still going up so that they they
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:48.120]  switched into climate change then when we started to explain to the public that
[1:12:48.120 --> 1:12:50.920]  they're look the climate change is naturally all the time and much much
[1:12:50.920 --> 1:12:55.720]  more than they understand and then they switched again as you said the
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:12:59.920]  politicians came up with that term but I've also they're also using terms like
[1:12:59.920 --> 1:13:04.200]  climate chaos and climate catastrophe and of course you got to keep this care
[1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:09.440]  factor up the fear factor up to to bamboozle people and push your agenda
[1:13:09.440 --> 1:13:19.240]  so yeah it's it's really disturbing what's going on well sir break down the
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:24.320]  basics for people of what's really going on the fact that the majority of
[1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:28.720]  scientists that I've seen you know the UN's got 2,000 scientists a bunch of
[1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:32.240]  them came out and said we didn't even agree to their theory they just put our
[1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:37.800]  names on this you guys have 37,000 and growing and then this this blanket live
[1:13:37.800 --> 1:13:43.040]  man-made climate change is real and anybody that questions it is a
[1:13:43.040 --> 1:13:48.920]  conspiracy theorist yeah well of course once once you start to get to the name
[1:13:48.920 --> 1:13:52.920]  calling at hominem as is put said in Latin that then you you know that you're
[1:13:52.920 --> 1:13:57.680]  losing the argument but just to put this whole thing in perspective you have to
[1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:03.480]  think about Alex why the focus on co2 it's such a small part of the total
[1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:08.280]  atmospheric system and mechanisms in fact it's a very small part of the
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:13.920]  greenhouse gases it's less than 4% and it's very interesting the EPA with their
[1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:19.560]  latest changes where they're gonna make co2 a toxic substance and methane and
[1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:23.880]  so on they don't even mention the most important greenhouse gas which is water
[1:14:23.880 --> 1:14:29.040]  vapor it's 95% of the greenhouse gases by volume so you really have to ask your
[1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:32.720]  question why the co2 and my whole career I've gone through this and by the way
[1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:37.400]  you know the numbers they come up with all of the consensus is and as you
[1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:44.200]  mentioned the 2500 with the IPCC and now the 37,000 with the Oregon petition and
[1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:49.520]  so on but consensus is not a scientific fact and so I'm a bit leery about the
[1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:54.880]  those numbers you really need to look at why the focus on co2 and what's going
[1:14:54.880 --> 1:15:01.920]  on here and and the answer when you dig deep goes back to a gentleman by the
[1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:07.320]  name of Morris Strong now he's currently in China and I understand he's moved
[1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:12.600]  there to escape charges by the US government of his involvement with
[1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:19.280]  Kofi Annan and their sons in the food for oil in the Iraq situation but he is
[1:15:19.280 --> 1:15:23.960]  he set up there to sell carbon credits out of China and just like Al Gore
[1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:28.840]  profiting from it and also with George Soros to build very very cheap small
[1:15:28.840 --> 1:15:34.360]  cars to import to the US but Murray Strong about 30 years ago said the
[1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:38.680]  problem for the planet are the industrialized nations and isn't it our
[1:15:38.680 --> 1:15:44.160]  responsibility to get rid of them now I'm not gonna say that industry hasn't
[1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:48.320]  created some small problems no question but the vast majority of what they've
[1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:53.160]  done has been for the betterment of human beings and so on and but you need
[1:15:53.160 --> 1:15:58.600]  to think about how would you go about destroying the industrialized nations
[1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:02.720]  now if you think about those industrialized nations like the engine
[1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:06.680]  in a car because that's a very good analogy for them they were a carbon
[1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:12.800]  based society that you can you can stop the engine by squeezing the fuel line
[1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:18.720]  but if you do that immediately people will scream you saw this recently with
[1:16:18.720 --> 1:16:24.120]  the increase in gasoline prices and everybody's immediately mad but if you
[1:16:24.120 --> 1:16:29.080]  could show that the byproduct of those industrialized nations is destroying the
[1:16:29.080 --> 1:16:34.160]  planet then you can effectively shut down those industrialized nations that's
[1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:40.160]  why co2 the byproduct of burning the fossil fuels became the focus and then
[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:46.320]  strong when he was asked by Elaine Dewar in a book called cloak of green as she
[1:16:46.320 --> 1:16:50.520]  said well why didn't you run in politics and he said you can't do anything as a
[1:16:50.520 --> 1:16:55.440]  politician I'm gonna write I went to the UN where I could get all the money I
[1:16:55.440 --> 1:17:00.040]  wanted with no accountability whatsoever and he set up the United Nations
[1:17:00.040 --> 1:17:06.520]  environment program that became the the foundation for it as they he if that
[1:17:06.520 --> 1:17:11.560]  you the United Nations environment program to find climate change as human
[1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:15.960]  caused climate change and then he set up the intergovernmental panel on climate
[1:17:15.960 --> 1:17:22.200]  change which was to do the scientific investigation of it and as you pointed
[1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:26.000]  out they list 2,500 people but but less than 500 of them are actually
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:33.880]  scientists and what I've served on a lot of commissions and inquiries and one
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:38.280]  of the things that I learned to Alex is that commissions of inquiry are
[1:17:38.280 --> 1:17:44.480]  wonderful things for politicians because it allows them to defer the heat so an
[1:17:44.480 --> 1:17:47.520]  issue comes up and says oh we need a commission of inquiry okay we'll have a
[1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:52.240]  commission of inquiry then the media can go to the politicians say oh sorry we
[1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:57.480]  can't comment till we get the report we don't know what we're looking at it by
[1:17:57.480 --> 1:18:01.760]  the time the report comes in of course the issue has become not not that
[1:18:01.760 --> 1:18:06.240]  critical the media have moved on to other things and so on so it differs but
[1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:11.240]  they also control the output of these commission reports and as I said I I
[1:18:11.240 --> 1:18:16.760]  experienced this firsthand by the terms of reference that they write just to put
[1:18:16.760 --> 1:18:21.000]  that in in in a US perspective you think about the Warren Commission into the
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:25.680]  Kennedy assassination and several times they asked Judge Warren well why didn't
[1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:29.480]  you look at this and in his response quite often was what it wasn't in my
[1:18:29.480 --> 1:18:35.520]  terms of reference and so that's how they control the output and so this is
[1:18:35.520 --> 1:18:40.240]  what Murray Strong did when he set up the IPCC he wrote the terms of reference
[1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:45.000]  one of the first terms of reference is that the climate change definition is
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:50.240]  that you only look at human causes of climate change and then the second thing
[1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:55.720]  that they did was they wrote it so that you do the science report or the
[1:18:55.720 --> 1:19:00.600]  technical report as it's called that's been set aside and then you write the
[1:19:00.600 --> 1:19:06.160]  summary for policymakers which is done by bureaucrats and politicians and the
[1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:10.560]  summary for policymakers is released before the science report is released
[1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:15.640]  and in 2007 it was done in April and the science report came out in November
[1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:19.520]  but that said the summary then goes to the people that wrote the science
[1:19:19.520 --> 1:19:24.160]  report and says make sure your science report agrees with what we've written in
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:29.440]  the summary so this is like an executive of a company saying to the employees
[1:19:29.440 --> 1:19:33.680]  look I've written a summary I want you to write a report that confirms my
[1:19:33.680 --> 1:19:39.120]  summary yeah it's totally totally rigged and they cynically know all this it's
[1:19:39.120 --> 1:19:43.000]  about eugenics and you read a quote I'm actually doing research on Murray Strong
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:47.720]  right now for a film I was reading that quote last night and I even went and
[1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:54.440]  found the videos of him saying we've got to have a law for a license not even
[1:19:54.440 --> 1:19:59.840]  one child the eugenicists will decide if you have any children they've seized

[1:23:58.600 --> 1:24:24.720]  today
[1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:33.480]  I was just on 93.7 K.L.B. J. with Charlie Hodge for four minutes into a freedom nugget on there
[1:24:35.160 --> 1:24:39.960]  during the break and he told me this breaking news and I actually heard this driving in on 590
[1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:44.760]  briefly this morning. I wasn't really paying attention it was something about panhandlers
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:50.520]  begging for money for the police and yeah they throw them back in jail and they're parole
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:54.200]  and so there's this aggressive halfway house group that's why they have them handed out the
[1:24:54.200 --> 1:24:59.480]  slips of paper and really get in your face it's to go give it to the government. They're actual
[1:24:59.480 --> 1:25:05.960]  slaves. I mean there's no end to the evil. Now imagine the diabolical nature of the scam.
[1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:12.360]  Maurice Strong back in the 70s and 80s got a lot of criticism for saying you should have to have a
[1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:16.040]  license to have children and they put it in Hollywood movies and culture and then all the
[1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:21.640]  yuppies say well of course there's too many people yeah but they mean you too and so Planned
[1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:25.720]  Parenthoods eugenics. Maurice Strong courses a front for the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation
[1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:30.440]  that's on record. I even have video clips. We have time all placing clips of him talking about
[1:25:30.440 --> 1:25:34.840]  I got in trouble for saying you should have a license to have children but it needs to be forced
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:41.800]  and State Department memorandum 200 is on record uh saying they wanted to force people
[1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:47.400]  not to have kids and and how to use war and famine and and to get countries and so much debt
[1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:52.360]  that all the government spending goes to debt instead of the people and so society's collapse
[1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:57.000]  we're talking to climatologist Dr. Tim Ball and you know last time we had him when he got into
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.840]  the science of how global warming wasn't man-made it is natural it's actually a good thing but
[1:26:00.840 --> 1:26:05.000]  unfortunately we're going into a cooling cycle with the ice caps of Mars getting bigger and
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:10.280]  some of the moons of of Jupiter and Saturn refreezing that have become liquid they were
[1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:15.880]  liquid methane now they're freezing uh and uh notice he's just talking about what the overall
[1:26:15.880 --> 1:26:20.280]  agenda is and I think that's the way to counter these people instead of arguing with people
[1:26:20.280 --> 1:26:25.000]  that say they invented the internet and things it's better just to show they're a pack of criminals
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:29.720]  trying to vertically integrate the economy and carry out eugenics but I think that's the direction
[1:26:29.720 --> 1:26:36.440]  you were going Dr. Ball yes and um I think that um one of the things that they very cleverly done
[1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:42.520]  and and as you know Alex you can win any argument by just uh distracting from the wider picture by
[1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:50.280]  focusing on one small point and um the focusing on co2 to the distraction of the much wider issues
[1:26:50.280 --> 1:26:55.480]  is really how they've they've perpetuated this and of course then anybody that dared to stand up
[1:26:55.480 --> 1:27:01.800]  and and question it is immediately attacked oh climate skeptic well uh I was called that years
[1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:05.640]  ago I'm proud of that all scientists should be scared they're trying to make it a hate crime in
[1:27:05.640 --> 1:27:12.440]  Europe uh you're a kind of denying the holocaust oh yeah and and James Hansen the the head of NASA
[1:27:12.440 --> 1:27:17.160]  guess who who just was arrested for protesting at a coal plant as a civil servant which makes you
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:22.680]  wonder what's going on but he's made statements like we should be in jail and um we've got David
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:27.480]  Suzuki up here in Canada saying the same thing that the people should be in jail he also says
[1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:32.360]  humans are maggots that basically need to be exterminated yeah well and one of the things
[1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:36.920]  that when you look at the whole environmental movement and by the way we needed to become more
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:42.920]  aware of our it's a bunch of gibbering control freaks to get off on pressing on the nerve of power
[1:27:42.920 --> 1:27:48.920]  they've hijacked legitimate concerns against pollution and things like that exactly and and um
[1:27:48.920 --> 1:27:54.040]  and I wanted the way that it's coming back on them a little bit Alex is that I dealt with my whole
[1:27:54.040 --> 1:28:00.280]  career with extremism and wondered what its purpose was and I finally realized that it's the
[1:28:00.280 --> 1:28:05.480]  extremists that define the limits for the majority I give you an example feminism of
[1:28:05.480 --> 1:28:10.520]  very necessary changes and still a lot of changes needed but the majority of women were saying well
[1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:15.240]  how far do we go with this then the extremists started doing silly things and the majority said
[1:28:15.240 --> 1:28:19.560]  oh no no now we're going we're losing more than we're gaining well the same things happen with
[1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:26.200]  the environmental it got hijacked by the extremists uh in Greenpeace and Sierra Club and and uh
[1:28:26.200 --> 1:28:31.640]  Kennedy and all of these other people and um now they're reaching the point where they're
[1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:36.520]  they're they're just being completely illogical and so the majority of people are starting to say
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:41.240]  well hang on a minute well wait it's not illogical if you want to kill the majority of the planet I
[1:28:41.240 --> 1:28:45.800]  mean oh they've admitted in studies that if they put in these carbon cuts it would kill half the
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:51.640]  third world oh sure and and so we saw that with the biofuels I mean that the switch to the biofuels
[1:28:51.640 --> 1:28:57.160]  and what did that do to food supply around the world and people dying yeah so it's so it's crazy
[1:28:57.160 --> 1:29:02.920]  like a fox oh yeah absolutely absolutely and by the way and I've written articles about this Alex
[1:29:02.920 --> 1:29:09.880]  that there there is a very deep seated anti-humanity or in in in the underlying the environmental
[1:29:09.880 --> 1:29:13.640]  movement you know and it's sort of if we could just get rid of all the people on the planet
[1:29:13.640 --> 1:29:17.720]  would be a great place to live well do you know what an underball stay there long segment coming
[1:29:17.720 --> 1:29:22.520]  up this was a short segment I want you to go over that how you think we beat them what do we do about
[1:29:22.520 --> 1:29:28.360]  this gargantuan climate bill that creates these commasars that are over all areas of the economy
[1:29:28.360 --> 1:29:35.320]  over 30 agencies who just do whatever regulations they want look if humans are so bad Suzuki you
[1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:41.400]  little twit you control freak you fake intellectual kill yourself stop saying kill african babies

[1:33:24.200 --> 1:33:33.320]  hated we're talking to climatologist dr. tim bulb and he's done a lot of great work warning people
[1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:41.560]  getting the word out gonna ask him in a moment some of the best ways to find some of his writings
[1:33:41.560 --> 1:33:49.320]  and materials he's put out we really appreciate him taking time out to talk to us today sir you've
[1:33:49.320 --> 1:33:53.480]  read their own writings you know what they're doing they brag about it then they tell the public it's
[1:33:53.480 --> 1:33:58.760]  about humanity and our children and jobs jobs jobs that was what they said over and over again as
[1:33:58.760 --> 1:34:03.640]  they passed the climate takeover bill it's not just about eugenics though it's like a total
[1:34:03.640 --> 1:34:08.600]  soviet society where everything's micromanage and we have these big global corporations who love it
[1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:12.760]  because they're monopoly capitalists they know the biggest profits are made out of controlled
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:18.120]  partnerships with government and you say people are waking up and they are waking up so they go
[1:34:18.120 --> 1:34:24.920]  from global warming to climate change to a deteriorating atmosphere to carbon poison i've seen dozens
[1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:30.120]  of video games dozens free on the nicolodian website other places for kids where carbon
[1:34:30.120 --> 1:34:35.560]  monsters try to kill kids and the kids practice killing the carbon monsters they teach it's
[1:34:35.560 --> 1:34:41.000]  an absolute fact it's toxic waste it will kill you you can tell the general public the scientific
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:48.440]  name of water and they will panic most of them and say ban it if you go out and talk to a crowd of
[1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:55.320]  people that happens so you've got the floor break down who these people are how we counter them
[1:34:55.320 --> 1:34:59.560]  where you see this fight going what you think of the world right now all across europe and the
[1:34:59.560 --> 1:35:06.360]  united states and canada falling to the climate cops falling to the new green tyranny the home
[1:35:06.360 --> 1:35:10.680]  inspections the shutting down of the factories the energy taxes what what in the world are we
[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:21.560]  going to do well it's a big the power of the media the spin doctors has reached global proportions
[1:35:22.520 --> 1:35:27.640]  and one of the things that's really problematic about it is the great bastion of freedom is the
[1:35:27.640 --> 1:35:35.080]  is the u.s and the freedom for the individual in the u.s and and it's being destroyed and and what's
[1:35:35.080 --> 1:35:41.080]  ironic about it is that um china is just ignoring all of what they're doing china's not going to
[1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:47.240]  sign any climate bill china's in fact china are not only holding your debt now but they're also
[1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:52.920]  saying oh well but you part of Kyoto you've got to pay us uh for for the damage that you've done
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:57.960]  so the country that's holding most of your debt is telling you you've got to pay them as well
[1:35:57.960 --> 1:36:05.000]  so it's um it's pretty disturbing on a on a global scale uh when and i tell people you hear a lot of
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:11.720]  anti-americanism especially up here in canada and and um i say look if you think of the u.s as a
[1:36:11.720 --> 1:36:17.720]  problem as a superpower you ain't seen nothing yet china will be a lot worse uh because china looks
[1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:25.480]  after china period and uh so uh what do we this this is all what's happening on a larger uh scale
[1:36:25.480 --> 1:36:30.520]  it's also of course why maris strong has moved there he's got it on the ground floor and what's
[1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:37.480]  going on in china and um so that that's part of the difficulty but um what they what they needed
[1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:43.320]  was a vehicle they needed a vehicle to uh control the public they needed a vehicle that the public
[1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:49.160]  they knew that most the public wouldn't understand and of course um the environment became the big
[1:36:49.160 --> 1:36:53.720]  issue as we've discussed an important issue everybody realized you've got to keep your own
[1:36:53.720 --> 1:37:02.200]  home clean um and so people bought into it um but uh they didn't realize that it was was a trojan
[1:37:02.200 --> 1:37:08.440]  horse uh that these people were using uh to infiltrate and of course then within that the
[1:37:08.440 --> 1:37:15.720]  the more strong uh focus on co2 and controlling of the energy because um you see i mentioned
[1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:20.360]  about the engine you can you can shut the engine down by squeezing the fuel line you can also stop
[1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:25.000]  the engine by plugging the exhaust and of course that's what they're doing with with pointing the
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:32.840]  finger at co2 and but one of the other one of the other problems is that um the science uh that
[1:37:32.840 --> 1:37:37.240]  where we're first where we need to focus is on the co2 say okay you brought us down to that let's
[1:37:37.240 --> 1:37:42.520]  look at what what the arguments are the scientific arguments now the hypothesis and scientists work
[1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:50.120]  by hypothesis they say well if if if this could happen those ifs are assumptions so for example
[1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:54.760]  Einstein's theory of relativity assumes that nothing can go faster the speed of light well
[1:37:54.760 --> 1:37:59.880]  if you find something going faster the speed of light then the formula equals mc2 essentially
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:05.560]  becomes redundant because it's only as valid as the assumption on which it's built the fundamental
[1:38:05.560 --> 1:38:14.440]  assumption in the ipcc uh hypothesis which of course strong was the architect of was that um human
[1:38:14.440 --> 1:38:22.600]  co2 uh is is um or co2 is a greenhouse gas that is it traps heat it's going to increase in an
[1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:28.040]  amount because humans are producing more of it and that as temperature as co2 goes up the
[1:38:28.040 --> 1:38:34.840]  temperature will rise those were the assumptions well uh first of all the most the most fundamental
[1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:43.000]  one that um with co2 increase the temperature will rise there's no evidence anywhere in any record of
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:49.080]  any duration for any time period in the history of the earth in which co2 increase pre-ceased
[1:38:49.080 --> 1:38:55.560]  temperature change in every record is exactly the opposite and the most famous one alex is the
[1:38:55.560 --> 1:39:00.520]  ice core record which they came out with it so look there it is the temperature going up and down
[1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:06.760]  over a 400 000 year record and there's the co2 going up and down and that the the scientists the
[1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:11.480]  british and the french scientists jowl's let the time i remember when this came out in the 80s said
[1:39:11.480 --> 1:39:16.280]  look don't rush to judgment on this but of course they rushed to judgment here it is there's the
[1:39:16.280 --> 1:39:24.600]  proof we now know that temperature change precedes co2 so co2 is not driving temperature at all let
[1:39:24.600 --> 1:39:30.440]  alone the human portion of it so for those that don't know doctor let's be specific yeah uh major
[1:39:30.440 --> 1:39:35.720]  universities hundreds of firms it's all on record they go out and test the ice core samples going
[1:39:35.720 --> 1:39:40.920]  back hundreds of thousands of years yep and it all fits the what we saw in the start of the
[1:39:40.920 --> 1:39:47.320]  bronze age 90 000 years ago it all shows uh that warming period 1500 years ago in europe
[1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:51.720]  when there was the big uh you know the vineyards everywhere that aren't there now in northern
[1:39:51.720 --> 1:39:59.960]  europe and in england that that the co2 follows after a temperature increases uh then there's
[1:39:59.960 --> 1:40:05.880]  obviously more life things melt more co2 gets released because of water vapor a lot of different
[1:40:05.880 --> 1:40:11.640]  reasons you're the climatologist you can explain it oh no but what al gore did is he moved it he
[1:40:11.640 --> 1:40:17.480]  cheated and because they're very close on the graph but it comes after he moved it to coincide go
[1:40:17.480 --> 1:40:23.000]  ahead yeah exactly and and by the way one of the things that that was not very widely publicized
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:29.320]  was that a week before he got his Nobel prize um and i thought the oscar was appropriate because
[1:40:29.320 --> 1:40:34.120]  it was from the land of make believe but they don't know price the Nobel prize is a different
[1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:41.160]  issue but the week before he got it a parent in england went took the movie to court and said
[1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:45.560]  but my son's been forced to watch this four times there are major scientific errors in it
[1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:49.800]  and i want if they're going to show it i want a warning a government warning against what's
[1:40:49.800 --> 1:40:56.440]  wrong with this movie the judge ruled that the movie was propaganda actually he didn't use that
[1:40:56.440 --> 1:41:02.360]  term specifically but he said it's it's politically biased and he said there are nine major errors
[1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:07.480]  and the one you just mentioned is one of them the shifting off the curves to coincide now that was
[1:41:07.480 --> 1:41:11.800]  a week before i got the Nobel prize now you could say okay well the Nobel committee couldn't have
[1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:18.200]  time had to have time to uh see that judgment and so on but the rulings the judge made were already
[1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:22.760]  in the literature so the Nobel prize committee didn't do their homework they'd already decided
[1:41:22.760 --> 1:41:27.800]  that they were going to give it to him and uh and that was the end of it so so i don't think ever
[1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:33.160]  in history is a Nobel prize been given to somebody whose work has been found criminally wrong
[1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:37.800]  you know before he got it it's absolutely amazing well why don't they just give him a
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:42.680]  Nobel prize for vending the internet or how about for for how about a Nobel prize hold on how about
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:48.920]  a Nobel prize for kitty hawk let's just say he did that too how about a Nobel prize um fun you
[1:41:48.920 --> 1:41:55.080]  know instead of madame curry for you know and vending x-rays yeah yeah all right it's um well of
[1:41:55.080 --> 1:41:59.400]  course it one of the things that we're seeing here and then some people have referred to this is the
[1:41:59.400 --> 1:42:05.000]  big lie the bigger the lie you tell the the more people will believe it and of course it one of
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:10.440]  the things that's amazing and you mentioned this to the top of the program that um he's he's challenging
[1:42:10.440 --> 1:42:15.800]  other people saying they're not qualified and they flatter thurs and blah blah blah but nobody
[1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:21.800]  ever says well you know what qualifications you have you got and um and this is this is the amazing
[1:42:21.800 --> 1:42:29.640]  thing about how he's able been able to survive and and get away with what he has but it's uh it's
[1:42:29.640 --> 1:42:35.480]  this whole thing about propaganda and because it's purely propaganda and so what we got to keep
[1:42:35.480 --> 1:42:41.640]  focusing on and and this is this is where you asked about how we how we deal with this is start to
[1:42:41.640 --> 1:42:47.000]  look at okay what is co2 and by the way one of the things alex said that we talked about extremism
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:52.680]  um the first thing that's happening is that the politicians generally worldwide but not
[1:42:52.680 --> 1:42:59.160]  the us are realizing that uh the climate or cap and trade and and anything to do with that is
[1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:03.960]  going to be harmful to the economy so they're they're you they're backing off on it that way
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:08.200]  the other thing is that i know from all the politicians i've talked to around the globe
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:15.000]  and i had a chance to listen to back left close in in new york and that's ahead of the year for
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:19.160]  those that don't know yeah he said ahead of the year you were president of chucklebacky but he
[1:43:19.160 --> 1:43:23.880]  had you know one of the things that these politicians uh they've been bullied into silence
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:28.040]  because they when you talk to them off the record they said yeah look we know what you're saying we
[1:43:28.040 --> 1:43:33.880]  understand that but it's it's absolute political suicide to go out there and suggest because you're
[1:43:33.880 --> 1:43:38.200]  immediately or we don't care about the planet you don't care about the children about the future
[1:43:38.200 --> 1:43:43.640]  and they're bullied into silence and when you look at exxon for example here's a corporation that's
[1:43:43.640 --> 1:43:50.600]  been admittedly spent 16 million on climate research well i wouldn't invest in an oil company
[1:43:50.600 --> 1:43:54.600]  an energy company that wasn't looking at what the climate was going to do and what the demand for
[1:43:54.600 --> 1:43:59.000]  their product was going to be they've said they're not going to put any more money into it i mean
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:04.040]  it's just ludicrous but they're bullied by these people in into silence well yeah that was in the
[1:44:04.040 --> 1:44:08.600]  new york times that david rockefeller rex tell us and said it was all fraud because it is and
[1:44:08.600 --> 1:44:12.600]  rockefeller showed up at the board meeting and said i'm going to fire all of you i still own this
[1:44:12.600 --> 1:44:17.800]  company you're going to go out and say not only is it real but you want a global carbon tax that
[1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:23.320]  was in the news and rex tell us in the next week went on tv and said i was wrong man may
[1:44:23.320 --> 1:44:30.520]  global warming is real and he said quote we need a global tax yeah oh yeah and of course the other
[1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:37.400]  thing is that the government using the taxpayers money is is uh as you inferred or directly mentioned
[1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:44.200]  is buying off corporations i mean they have all this idea about about green jobs and one of the
[1:44:44.200 --> 1:44:50.200]  things that frustrates me about this alex isn't just that um that the u.s and the policies the
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:57.800]  cap and trade and so on um it is not scientifically based i would i would i would be more willing
[1:44:57.800 --> 1:45:05.720]  to be less cynical and skeptical about it if the ideas and proposals were new that they were genuinely
[1:45:05.720 --> 1:45:12.040]  new of innovative ways but they're not they these are these ideas that are that they're in the cap
[1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:17.480]  and trade and what epa are doing have been tried by other countries and have been a disaster well
[1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:20.680]  let me stop you're right there and then we'll go over this but you mentioned something earlier
[1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:27.000]  about 10 minutes ago and and for for the decade plus i've been aware of this takeover plan for
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:32.280]  their own documents and what morris strong had said and and and green crossing green shield and
[1:45:32.280 --> 1:45:38.440]  mckelgore bachoff and david rockefeller and the un openly saying reduce our numbers down to 500
[1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:46.600]  million ever since they started pushing that i knew that china india mexico and 160 other third
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:51.640]  world and developing countries wouldn't have to make the cuts and it was really a way to deindustrialize
[1:45:53.080 --> 1:45:59.080]  the west but now what you just said is true now they're saying oh okay we're going to do
[1:45:59.080 --> 1:46:04.200]  retroactive carbon taxing and we've got to pay three billion a year to china a billion a year to
[1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:11.240]  mexico called iran's on tv saying and and obama saying yes we're going to take taxpayer money
[1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:15.160]  and give it to you and then you're going to pay it to the imf and world bank mainly the
[1:46:15.880 --> 1:46:21.400]  imf is the new bank of the world as your carbon credits so it more than just eugenics that's
[1:46:21.400 --> 1:46:27.160]  you know the overall system it's a money laundering operation for more international aid
[1:46:27.160 --> 1:46:31.000]  where instead of the money going to the imf and world bank they own its dictators
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:35.480]  or corrupt systems who then keep the money and then hand the resources over to the bankers
[1:46:35.480 --> 1:46:39.640]  this is countries they've already bought off in the third world will now just take the money
[1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:46.760]  keep part of it and pay the rest right back to david rockefeller i mean this is just i mean
[1:46:46.760 --> 1:46:51.720]  that this is this is what con artists would come up with if they were just told think of the most
[1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:57.160]  ridiculous out in the open con so even if you believe carbon dioxide's a deadly poison that
[1:46:57.160 --> 1:47:03.640]  kills plants kills animals it's like nerve gas the point is that we're all one planet if china
[1:47:03.640 --> 1:47:10.120]  and india don't make cuts and all our jobs move there there will be more of this vx nerve gas known
[1:47:10.120 --> 1:47:16.840]  as carbon dioxide almost as deadly as dihydrogen monoxide also water that deadly nerve gas more
[1:47:16.840 --> 1:47:24.360]  than nerve gas released now can you explain that to us well yeah i mean one of the things
[1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:29.160]  about the kiyoto and and you have to go back again tomorrow strong he grew up on a farm
[1:47:29.160 --> 1:47:35.880]  in southern manitoba in canada and the family were socialist extreme almost to the point
[1:47:35.880 --> 1:47:42.600]  of communism and um in just to give you an idea winnipeg the only city in north america that
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:47.800]  had a democratic elected communist on the city council but marie strong now he admits it he's
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:52.920]  a hardcore piece of filth go ahead oh yeah okay but it one of the things of course it's underlying
[1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:59.960]  that is is a redistribution of wealth and we talked about the ipcc but the kiyoto accord
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:06.520]  that came out of and by the way this is another of his big operations was the real conference in
[1:48:06.520 --> 1:48:13.320]  1992 which um george bush the elder refused to go to george herbert bush refused to go to
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:20.200]  but but the kiyoto accord and the carbon credits was a transfer of wealth it was a socializing
[1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:25.640]  of taking the wealth the wealth from those people that had worked hard and succeeded
[1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:31.960]  and giving it to those that were were not working hard not succeeding so this was part of this this
[1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:40.920]  whole um strategy and of course again the vehicle was the co2 and and by the way the carbon credits
[1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:49.000]  is very interesting uh because um that idea originally uh with the ipcc they were trying
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:55.320]  to get the the uh kiyoto through the u.s and as you recall this uh 95 to nothing the u.s senate
[1:48:55.320 --> 1:49:01.720]  voted against it when our goal was the vice president and it was 95 to nothing against
[1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:05.880]  when the inventor of the internet was vice president yeah and well you should have gone
[1:49:05.880 --> 1:49:11.960]  on the internet and then and and veigled some more votes but the europeans the europeans are
[1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:17.320]  with strong and sir john houghton who was the head of the uk met office and so on these people
[1:49:17.320 --> 1:49:23.720]  trying to get the americans on board uh said look what what can we do to um make this attractive
[1:49:23.720 --> 1:49:28.520]  to you but the u.s came back and said look give you give us some credit for the carbon we're
[1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:33.960]  taking out of the atmosphere um because one of the things that you don't hear much about alex is
[1:49:33.960 --> 1:49:41.160]  that yeah we produce about seven and a half gigatons of co2 a year but we remove 50 percent of that
[1:49:41.160 --> 1:49:47.400]  through agriculture and forestry and so uh but i don't like that either i mean i've talked a lot
[1:49:47.400 --> 1:49:53.640]  of other climatologists and biologists that have done the studies on plants isn't a carbon dioxide
[1:49:53.640 --> 1:49:59.640]  rich atmosphere better for overall life cycle carbon cycle on the planet and aren't we at a very
[1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:05.800]  low point according to the research oh yeah we're at 385 parts per million which is the lowest level
[1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:11.720]  in 600 million years and um one of the things that's interesting that confirms this sure would it so
[1:50:11.720 --> 1:50:18.920]  and his son craig have done an enormous amount of research on putting plants into enriched co2
[1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:25.080]  atmospheres and they found that almost all plants function better at between a thousand and 1200
[1:50:25.080 --> 1:50:29.800]  parts per million in other words three times what they currently are getting so you could
[1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:35.400]  legitimately argue that plants are malnourished but what's more important alex is that if you
[1:50:35.400 --> 1:50:41.160]  look at the last 300 million years the average level of co2 in the atmosphere has been around
[1:50:41.160 --> 1:50:47.160]  a thousand to 1200 parts per million and some commercial operations greenhouses are taking
[1:50:47.160 --> 1:50:51.480]  advantage of that by pumping that level into the greenhouse and getting four times the yield on
[1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:56.920]  their plants so yeah but the hormone doctor he doesn't kill the plants it's now a toxic nerve
[1:50:56.920 --> 1:51:03.240]  gas the news says oh my god they breathe it stay with us millions of americans are beginning to
[1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:08.200]  realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the us and the world and for the

[1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:41.080]  people should visit to read all your great writings and research well there's two that i
[1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:48.680]  contribute to on a regular basis one is uh canada free press dot com that's all one word and um if
[1:54:48.680 --> 1:54:54.280]  they go to uh i just have an article in there on mondia my articles usually appear on monday
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:55:00.040]  and um that they have a columnist archive that that that they can tap into and there's about
[1:55:00.040 --> 1:55:07.480]  35 articles on there fantastic yeah the other the other site that i contribute to and i have
[1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:12.280]  a group i helped set up that you mentioned in the in the promo was friendsofscience.org
[1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:19.960]  absolutely friendsofscience.org yeah that one focuses on the science the canada free press
[1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:24.520]  is a mix of the science and and the political implications well i mean we've proven the
[1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:29.800]  scientific case because it's it's i mean really elementary uh or at least it seems as a layman
[1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:34.040]  compared to a lot of other scientific questions yeah we know plants breathe carbon dioxide and we
[1:55:34.040 --> 1:55:39.320]  know during the break you you were mentioning world food supply morris strung also says
[1:55:39.320 --> 1:55:44.600]  and kissinger says shut down world food supply and that's also part of what this whole greenhouse
[1:55:44.600 --> 1:55:50.440]  gas uh taxes about well yeah there's no question about that and and you as i mentioned earlier
[1:55:50.440 --> 1:55:56.840]  with the biofuels you see how marginal we are and um one of the things that everybody forgets
[1:55:56.840 --> 1:56:01.960]  is that um and i i've got a quote that i made up a long time ago there are no farms in the
[1:56:01.960 --> 1:56:07.240]  cities but there's no cities without farms and um if you ignore the agricultural base
[1:56:07.240 --> 1:56:13.000]  that's the base of any economy and well instead they're taking that over with the animal ID
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:19.400]  primus society from australia to canada the us they are swat teeming amish for selling milk
[1:56:19.400 --> 1:56:25.240]  swat teeming egg sellers i mean they're really squeezing and and and these environmental green
[1:56:25.240 --> 1:56:29.720]  brigades are just showing and i'm not bashing folks with ponytails and bergen stocks but
[1:56:29.720 --> 1:56:34.040]  now they got sidearms and they were showing up on farms and ranches and go and look
[1:56:34.040 --> 1:56:40.520]  and they're basically communist yeah well it's it's um you know that it organic is all very
[1:56:40.520 --> 1:56:45.800]  nice and there's a niche market for that but if we if we went totally organic you have to cut
[1:56:45.800 --> 1:56:51.320]  every force in the world down to grow the amount of food we're currently producing and and and
[1:56:51.320 --> 1:56:57.240]  and it i'm trying to think of the guy Dennis Avery a wonderful book called saving the planet
[1:56:57.240 --> 1:57:01.880]  with plastics and pesticides and uh he's saying you know if they really wanted to save these
[1:57:01.880 --> 1:57:05.880]  ecologies and environments they're talking about we should increase the yields on the land we're
[1:57:05.880 --> 1:57:10.760]  currently farming and uh we could do that very easily i mean we look at the increase of corn
[1:57:10.760 --> 1:57:15.080]  yields over the last little while now there are some side effects no question we but we
[1:57:15.080 --> 1:57:20.840]  can monitor those and and take care of those but uh to just shut it all down is certainly not a
[1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:27.320]  solution at all but that's that gives you ultimate control i guess well the problem is the big agribusiness
[1:57:27.320 --> 1:57:31.720]  own their areas and they don't leave the land fallow but you drive around the united states
[1:57:31.720 --> 1:57:37.960]  in the world there's farm areas not being used everywhere well and that was one of the problems
[1:57:37.960 --> 1:57:45.400]  i had with george uh w bush's uh uh policies or agricultural policies were put um people were
[1:57:45.400 --> 1:57:50.680]  buying farms simply to get the government subsidies it was a better investment than going into the
[1:57:50.680 --> 1:57:55.960]  stock market and that was the fallow land uh whether we were being paid not to grow them and it's
[1:57:55.960 --> 1:58:02.280]  just insanity um and of course they they uh they don't want uh stockpiling of food at all because
[1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:09.160]  that that uh they lose control that way but um no the i think the agricultural base is is is a
[1:58:09.160 --> 1:58:16.600]  very important part of this and that's why um i mean we talk about uh paying people to uh
[1:58:16.600 --> 1:58:21.880]  sequester co2 well the farmers are already doing it why aren't they getting a subsidy for the 50%
[1:58:21.880 --> 1:58:26.600]  of co2 they're taken out of the atmosphere well there's some environmental uh global warming
[1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:32.680]  wackos that think trees are producing co2 and so they're bad do five more minutes with this doc
[1:58:32.680 --> 1:58:37.240]  because i want you to finish your thoughts and where you see this going uh you seem to think
[1:58:37.240 --> 1:58:47.880]  they're losing steam stay with us thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today
[1:58:47.880 --> 1:58:55.320]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:58:55.320 --> 1:58:59.960]  this summer number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[1:58:59.960 --> 1:59:05.240]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[1:59:05.240 --> 1:59:10.360]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[1:59:10.360 --> 1:59:15.240]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[1:59:15.240 --> 1:59:19.320]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead number four the hurricane and dangerous
[1:59:19.320 --> 1:59:23.480]  summer storm season is here again every year thousands of families lose their power from
[1:59:23.480 --> 1:59:28.600]  weather related outages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[1:59:28.600 --> 1:59:33.560]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[1:59:33.560 --> 1:59:40.120]  a long time sponsor of ours you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's

[1:59:53.640 --> 1:59:58.840]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[1:59:58.840 --> 2:00:12.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:00:13.240 --> 2:00:21.560]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:21.560 --> 2:00:28.920]  very very exciting we're going to have dr ball in studio coming up a few weeks here with us
[2:00:28.920 --> 2:00:33.560]  i want to have him down here to discuss some things with us and also for a eugenics film
[2:00:35.080 --> 2:00:41.720]  i'm making a population control film after the current one i'm making so definitely very very
[2:00:41.720 --> 2:00:46.120]  important very very exciting okay in closing i've been throwing in my two cents quite a bit here
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:50.760]  it seems that they're beginning to stall out i mean right as they get victories
[2:00:50.760 --> 2:00:55.160]  right as they pass it in the house and it's going to the senate and they may be able even to even
[2:00:55.160 --> 2:00:59.560]  do that they're going to have trouble implementing this because when nancy polosi and others lie
[2:00:59.560 --> 2:01:05.960]  and say it's about jobs uh even their own white papers admit this is meant to shut down jobs so
[2:01:05.960 --> 2:01:10.840]  so where do you see their their movement going well i think there's a couple of things one one
[2:01:10.840 --> 2:01:17.560]  i mentioned was that the economy has refocused a lot of the politicians and um and of course
[2:01:17.560 --> 2:01:21.800]  they're getting word from their constituents and by the way one thing i rely on alex is is
[2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:26.680]  there's a huge well of common sense in the ordinary people they don't uh they're a bit
[2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:31.480]  pop i said it all when he said i i don't know how she does it but she does it so there's that
[2:01:31.480 --> 2:01:38.120]  underlying skepticism amongst the people and and um things things uh one of the things that i've
[2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:44.360]  noticed is with the cooling that's been going on since 2000 uh initially they said oh well it's
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:49.480]  just a one-year anomaly now they're saying well yeah it it's slight cooling but it's just
[2:01:49.480 --> 2:01:53.560]  going to go back to warming again and then when they when they were pushed on it they said well
[2:01:53.560 --> 2:01:59.240]  no but this cooling's due to warming that was so illogical that even people that don't understand
[2:01:59.240 --> 2:02:04.200]  the science were saying hang on a minute hold on a minute here and um and of course the fact
[2:02:04.200 --> 2:02:10.280]  that the cooling trend will continue um we'll we'll uh and and we'll see it again this winter
[2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:15.720]  we'll see it with the harvest problems across the u.s and the world that's going on right now
[2:02:16.440 --> 2:02:21.160]  canada we're very very late with our planting and seedings down about 20 and that's because of
[2:02:21.160 --> 2:02:25.960]  that big yellow thing in the sky they say has nothing to do with heat exactly and by the way
[2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:31.000]  that's another part of the the intergovernmental panel on climate change the they don't consider
[2:02:31.000 --> 2:02:38.040]  the sun as as a factor because it's not humans don't have control of it and and so that that's
[2:02:38.040 --> 2:02:44.360]  uh those these sorts of things are are making the people start to realize even though they don't
[2:02:44.360 --> 2:02:50.120]  understand uh that uh no that there's there's a lot of uh of nonsense being sold but i mean i see
[2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:56.280]  them on the news saying the sun has nothing to do with it that is so asinine on its face i mean
[2:02:56.280 --> 2:03:02.040]  isn't the sun the main driver of temperature totally you pick up any any meteorology or climate
[2:03:02.040 --> 2:03:06.280]  textbook the very first thing they tell you is the source of energy for the atmosphere is the sun
[2:03:06.280 --> 2:03:11.640]  and then then these people proceed to ignore it the analogy i've used alexis is like saying my car
[2:03:11.640 --> 2:03:15.320]  is not running very well but i'm not going to look at the engine which is the sun and i'm not
[2:03:15.320 --> 2:03:19.800]  going to look at the transmission which is water vapor the most important greenhouse gas and i mean
[2:03:19.800 --> 2:03:24.200]  ignore the differential i'm going to look at one knot on the right rear wheel which is co2 and oh
[2:03:24.200 --> 2:03:27.960]  by the way i'm only going to look at one thread within that nut which is the human portion of
[2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:33.080]  co2 and that's what i'm going to that's how i'm going to resolve the problems with my car it's that
[2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:40.280]  that's incredibly wrong in scientific terms but it was just one quick comment alex a lot of people
[2:03:40.280 --> 2:03:47.800]  forgotten that they had a world conference on population in 1994 and guess who was the organizer
[2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:55.800]  and keynote speaker was our friend Al Gore no oh yeah so uh he's been at that game with the
[2:03:55.800 --> 2:04:01.480]  population thing for a long time too but and of course a lot of it grows out of the as we talked
[2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:07.800]  off the air about the club of Rome limits to growth and and paul erlich and all of his wrong
[2:04:07.800 --> 2:04:13.400]  predictions uh he's still out there making them and dr ball it won't hurt my feelings because
[2:04:13.400 --> 2:04:17.880]  i know you're a very busy man you're also coming to town uh in about a week and a half two weeks
[2:04:18.680 --> 2:04:22.280]  but if you want to go ahead and get into him now if you need to leave we can do it when you're in
[2:04:22.280 --> 2:04:29.800]  studio well it doesn't it doesn't matter do it either way let's do one more segment get into that
[2:04:29.800 --> 2:04:33.960]  because you haven't gotten into uh their actual numbers and their statements on population control
[2:04:33.960 --> 2:04:38.040]  right and we'll do one more segment with you then i'm going to take calls folks and cover a bunch of
[2:04:38.040 --> 2:04:43.320]  other news that we haven't gotten into and i want to read the article that paul watson did the red
[2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:48.600]  alert article also that view cannons saying climate bills that transfer of wealth to world
[2:04:48.600 --> 2:04:54.360]  government they're going all over youtube removing that video i've never seen them remove a video so
[2:04:54.360 --> 2:05:00.040]  fast they are really scared of that people finding out this is a global tax so we'll uh talk about
[2:05:00.040 --> 2:05:05.160]  that as well this is alex jones have you heard of the millionaire patriot well you should he has

[2:09:04.520 --> 2:09:08.680]  hosts you're an angel but i've seen other hosts please some other hosts yeah i've seen them
[2:09:08.680 --> 2:09:12.600]  throw stuff throw fits i don't know why that's because they get nervous being on air my problem
[2:09:12.600 --> 2:09:17.080]  is i forget i'm on air and almost fall asleep at the time i can get up before a crowd of 5000
[2:09:17.080 --> 2:09:21.880]  people and literally start falling asleep i've done this so long and so much i didn't get butterflies
[2:09:21.880 --> 2:09:27.400]  13 14 years ago when i'm getting front of crowds and now it's not butterflies it's oh okay uh you
[2:09:27.400 --> 2:09:35.000]  know i'm just so used to it but anyways now i've been demonized by the bbc and then we'll cover
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:39.960]  this at the bottom of the hour this just came out folks i'm getting hit by national media every day
[2:09:39.960 --> 2:09:45.640]  i said i was going to have michelle bachman the state uh the u.s congresswoman on because
[2:09:45.640 --> 2:09:49.640]  ted anderson knows one of her campaign people and was just going to call he said hey you want
[2:09:49.640 --> 2:09:54.760]  bachman on i know you know we know and i said yeah he goes well you'll probably get her on next week
[2:09:54.760 --> 2:10:01.960]  well then that became gawker minnesota newspapers will she go on jones's show attacking me and
[2:10:01.960 --> 2:10:05.240]  then they called his campaign her campaign manager he said well i didn't know about that
[2:10:05.240 --> 2:10:11.960]  and then it's like alex is a liar i mean ladies and gentlemen we are being micromanaged and tracked
[2:10:11.960 --> 2:10:17.400]  and everything we do being gone over with a white glove it is it is really getting insane
[2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:20.440]  by the way scintilla mckinney has been kidnapped by israeli troops
[2:10:21.160 --> 2:10:25.240]  mike reveros the last person i know to interview her we're going to get him on here in about 20
[2:10:25.240 --> 2:10:31.720]  minutes to give us a quick update on what's happening with that going back to uh dr tim
[2:10:31.720 --> 2:10:38.840]  bald climatologist uh doc you're going to get into the overall population reduction agenda itself
[2:10:38.840 --> 2:10:45.640]  that global warming is just the governmental economic energy straightjacket to as you said
[2:10:45.640 --> 2:10:50.200]  put a kink in the hose for the fuel for civilization they get us under civilization they get us
[2:10:50.200 --> 2:10:55.800]  urbanized what they said by design to control us and domesticate us then they start incrementally
[2:10:55.800 --> 2:11:01.240]  like we're a howl nine thousand turning off the civilization they're really just a bunch of control
[2:11:01.240 --> 2:11:06.120]  freaks break it down for us yeah just a quick comment on your question to your staff there i
[2:11:06.120 --> 2:11:12.120]  think that that what what i get from you is that we can disagree but we don't have to be disagreeable
[2:11:12.120 --> 2:11:19.160]  but anyway absolutely yeah and beyond that um the the whole idea about overpopulation of course
[2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:24.520]  starts with the malphos back in the 18th century and arguments that all the populations are growing
[2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:31.560]  the food supply and so on one of the things that um it makes the u.s so successful and so powerful
[2:11:31.560 --> 2:11:37.400]  is that it has been more successful in producing uh food to feed its people than any other nation
[2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:43.480]  on the planet in fact um not only growing enough for itself but exporting to the world and um from
[2:11:43.480 --> 2:11:49.880]  that surplus food of course comes surplus time and you set up the civilization what happens over time
[2:11:49.880 --> 2:11:57.560]  is that the population shift and right now you've got into us a two percent of the population that
[2:11:57.560 --> 2:12:04.440]  are officially listed as farmers but 18 percent 20 percent rural population but people move into
[2:12:04.440 --> 2:12:10.840]  the cities and they become disconnected from the food supply and once they're once of course you're
[2:12:10.840 --> 2:12:19.000]  dependent upon uh what's in the supermarket uh you are you're effectively lost control uh once
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:24.040]  you can't feed yourself and um and of course we're seeing the same thing going on in china i mean
[2:12:24.040 --> 2:12:29.400]  the massive thing that's occurred in china is the shift of the population from the rural areas
[2:12:29.400 --> 2:12:35.000]  they've gone from about 80 percent to rural uh down to less than 50 percent in about 10 years
[2:12:35.560 --> 2:12:42.120]  and um the demand for homes and so on is driving a lot of that economy and and so the the population
[2:12:42.120 --> 2:12:49.560]  idea um it really got to a peak um back in the 70s now one of the things that drove it and this is
[2:12:49.560 --> 2:12:55.080]  when i started my climate career was that global cooling was the consensus then and that's why i'm
[2:12:55.080 --> 2:13:00.280]  not a consensus person because they're all we know in the cia we're doing reports on oh the world's
[2:13:00.280 --> 2:13:05.480]  overpopulated and we and we're not going to be able to feed ourselves with this global cooling
[2:13:05.480 --> 2:13:12.280]  and um uh out of that of course the club of rome and there was a meeting in rome in 1976 about the
[2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:19.240]  world's going to starve to death by the year 2000 and um and the the simplistic computer models which
[2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:24.200]  are at the basis of all of these problems we're just saying oh well here's the trend and it's
[2:13:24.200 --> 2:13:29.960]  going to continue and the world simply can't survive pass and all of those predictions are wrong
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:35.960]  but somehow they still got the floor and people like paul erlich uh who was the one that was pushing
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:42.360]  the overpopulation idea was at the heart of that and then of course uh gore we're organizing that
[2:13:42.360 --> 2:13:48.600]  conference in in um in uh chiro egypt uh what better place than to say oh look there's poverty
[2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:54.920]  due to overpopulation right outside the window and um that that idea of the world's overpopulated
[2:13:54.920 --> 2:14:00.520]  because the question you gotta ask is um which populations that we got too many of which ones
[2:14:00.520 --> 2:14:06.760]  are we gonna eliminate how are we gonna thin the herd i mean just just frightening implications to
[2:14:06.760 --> 2:14:11.160]  all of the of this focus upon the world over population that's right that's right it's seen
[2:14:11.160 --> 2:14:16.120]  as common knowledge by any of the intelligency to go the people bomb we've got to call the
[2:14:16.120 --> 2:14:21.320]  population well then ask who are we going to call who are we going to kill and then you look at
[2:14:21.320 --> 2:14:25.720]  the point you just made that we're actually concentrated populations and that once the
[2:14:25.720 --> 2:14:30.680]  nation becomes industrialized they actually begin to have a negative population growth like europe
[2:14:30.680 --> 2:14:39.720]  of 1.3 japan with 1.3 idly with even lower 1.2 europe is dying russia is dying the united states
[2:14:39.720 --> 2:14:46.520]  is dying if it wasn't for the massive immigrant replacement influx and so and the un admits
[2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:52.040]  that if they just industrialized the third world uh that uh it would actually lift them up and they
[2:14:52.040 --> 2:14:58.600]  wouldn't have so many children but you read the world population report put out by the un you
[2:14:58.600 --> 2:15:04.520]  read the world commission on population put out by the british government they say that population
[2:15:04.520 --> 2:15:09.720]  and industrialization is the threat and so they say we're not going to give them industrialization
[2:15:09.720 --> 2:15:15.160]  we're going to let their population swell to keep them down and then we're going to use birth control
[2:15:15.160 --> 2:15:21.320]  and sterilization and war and famine to then call that mass so use the people bomb as a weapon
[2:15:21.320 --> 2:15:28.360]  to keep the third world down then kind of exterminate them with war famine and uh sterilization
[2:15:28.360 --> 2:15:33.960]  so the eugenicists aren't even doing what they're saying it's not some high and mighty uh you know
[2:15:33.960 --> 2:15:40.840]  eugenics's view that's bad enough but with some rationale this is just a cover story for kind of
[2:15:40.840 --> 2:15:47.080]  low level thugs to carry out the eugenics the top guys are just playing a global game of risk
[2:15:47.080 --> 2:15:52.120]  to knock out all their enemies exactly and and uh the what you're talking about there is the
[2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:57.400]  demographic transition and everybody can google that phrase demographic transition and it's the
[2:15:57.400 --> 2:16:05.480]  well documented um showing that as you become industrialized the uh first of all the death
[2:16:05.480 --> 2:16:10.840]  rate uh goes down and the birth but then they're followed by the birth rate goes down and then
[2:16:10.840 --> 2:16:16.200]  the population starts to decline and of course a lot of countries are offsetting this by paying
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:23.400]  people to have a third child i know kebeck up in canada here italy's done it um but also a lot
[2:16:23.400 --> 2:16:29.160]  of countries it's being masked by immigration and um if you look at that in the u.s and the
[2:16:29.160 --> 2:16:35.800]  discussion about immigration so it's masking uh the actual demographic transition that's going on
[2:16:35.800 --> 2:16:41.160]  and um yeah that's why germany and france are full of north africans and eros because they i mean
[2:16:41.160 --> 2:16:47.480]  some german cities have half the population they did just 40 years ago yeah yeah oh there's no
[2:16:47.480 --> 2:16:53.880]  there's no question and and as i said the the at that conference in rome in 1976 one of the one of
[2:16:53.880 --> 2:16:59.480]  the arguments by a lot of the countries was look let us industrialize and that will cause the
[2:16:59.480 --> 2:17:06.680]  population to decline and uh and of course that was rejected completely but uh yeah the the the
[2:17:06.680 --> 2:17:13.000]  whole idea about uh if you want a limit by the way just very interesting thing alex is that um you
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:20.520]  can calculate this out yourself but if you but the average family of about 2.7 2.8 people um you
[2:17:20.520 --> 2:17:26.920]  could put them in 1000 square foot homes on 3000 square foot lots with roads and parks and uh
[2:17:27.880 --> 2:17:33.880]  the normal facilities and the population under those conditions which would be ideal in most of
[2:17:33.880 --> 2:17:39.720]  the world all of the world's population could fit in the southern half of alberta now would
[2:17:39.720 --> 2:17:45.320]  albertans like that probably not but it gives you an idea when you look at canada for example here
[2:17:45.320 --> 2:17:51.320]  we are the second largest country in the world and we've got a population equal to california
[2:17:52.200 --> 2:17:58.520]  and so when you start talking about overpopulation it absolute nonsense um and of course the other
[2:17:58.520 --> 2:18:04.280]  thing that came out of that conference in chiro they were pointing the finger at at uh asia and
[2:18:04.280 --> 2:18:09.160]  africans oh they're overpopulated the country with the highest population density in the world is
[2:18:09.160 --> 2:18:14.600]  the netherlands but they got one of the highest standards of living so so when you start to look
[2:18:14.600 --> 2:18:20.600]  at the statistics and what was going on with all of this um the overpopulation thing and and it's a
[2:18:20.600 --> 2:18:25.160]  thing that people fear oh you know i don't want people to buy neighborhood exactly it's that it's
[2:18:25.160 --> 2:18:31.640]  not industrialized is why calcutta is a cesspit it is because it's it's not industrialized that
[2:18:31.640 --> 2:18:37.800]  mexico city is a hell pit we've got to industrialize them with the new clean industries but the global
[2:18:37.800 --> 2:18:42.040]  is when you really read their papers they're suppressing all that that's why it's so sickening
[2:18:42.040 --> 2:18:47.720]  they claim oh we want to make you adopt new clean systems they're actually vertically integrating
[2:18:47.720 --> 2:18:54.120]  things cutting off the capital of the world in their own documents to suppress clean development
[2:18:54.120 --> 2:19:00.040]  and they want dirty sprawling third world because it's a ball and chain that keeps these people down
[2:19:00.040 --> 2:19:06.600]  folks you can just google his name and read all of his great writings i really appreciate dr tim ball
[2:19:06.600 --> 2:19:12.120]  climatologist joining us and i'm going to have my producer call you right now and book those

[2:19:30.840 --> 2:19:35.880]  there taking action i think we're starting to uh to really turn the tide against these people
[2:19:35.880 --> 2:19:40.920]  that's why they really pressed and passed this climate takeover in the house but i think that's
[2:19:40.920 --> 2:19:45.240]  the beginning of the end for him thank you so much dr ball thank you i thanks for the opportunity

[2:24:14.440 --> 2:24:19.720]  al-qaeda to try to kill muhman qaddafi and others that later was confirmed by mainstream news
[2:24:19.720 --> 2:24:27.400]  came out and suddenly said he was on the side and then after they arrested the individual that made
[2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:34.200]  the 777 ripple effect which i think is a very good film very very well done his website then started
[2:24:34.200 --> 2:24:41.400]  having comments about how he might be the messiah or something this is a classic m i-5 m i-6 shaken
[2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:47.000]  bank because they know that sounds crazy they know that's where they that's their favorite way to
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:51.240]  try to discredit the information we're putting out is to have something come out that's really
[2:24:51.240 --> 2:24:58.600]  credible and then have the person involved with it so that they're the messiah and uh this is the
[2:24:58.600 --> 2:25:04.280]  bbc has a big tv program coming out on this they've done two attacking me on 9 11 but it doesn't
[2:25:04.280 --> 2:25:08.680]  change the fact that local news that day reported the police were chasing down arabs all over the
[2:25:08.680 --> 2:25:14.280]  city and shooting them that these were the people that had taken part in the drill that day of a
[2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:19.240]  mock bombing of the very trains and bus that were attacked at the exact same place exact same time
[2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:25.640]  now that's bbc admitting that live that day how strange it was a drill the exact same trains and
[2:25:25.640 --> 2:25:31.000]  exact same bus being attacked at the exact same time just like 9 11 exact same buildings exact
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:36.760]  same place exact same time and i go over all that evidence in terror storm a history of government
[2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:47.400]  sponsored terrorism and there's no doubt this is a psi op and uh you know mr hill used the
[2:25:47.400 --> 2:25:58.360]  pseudonym wadib out of the dune book which i guess means uh the kind of the prophet so they say that
[2:25:58.360 --> 2:26:04.200]  means he's a prophet then it wasn't on his side at first after he gets arrested it pops up saying he
[2:26:04.200 --> 2:26:13.080]  thinks he's jesus or something basically uh this is very very bizarre but regardless the film itself
[2:26:13.080 --> 2:26:22.280]  is devastating but he's in jail so unmasking the mysterious seven seven conspiracy theory
[2:26:23.400 --> 2:26:28.120]  it's kind of like that doctor with the anthrax firstly said it was two other people
[2:26:28.120 --> 2:26:33.960]  or not they didn't did it the fbi said it wasn't weaponized the fbi said it was cheap no big deal
[2:26:33.960 --> 2:26:39.000]  made in a bathtub probably in a bucket but a bathtub in a bucket was the quote turns out it's
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:44.440]  the most weaponized ever seen u.s. government super strain miniaturized coded in bentonite
[2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:50.040]  just the miniaturization process cost over a hundred million dollars in equipment huge plants
[2:26:50.840 --> 2:26:57.720]  just one of the miniaturization miniaturization tanks in fact google google for folks on tv right
[2:26:57.720 --> 2:27:06.600]  now anthrax production and it'll show the giant tanks they used to make it and we're talking about
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:12.520]  a facility close to the size of an aircraft carrier to make this stuff giant complexes
[2:27:13.960 --> 2:27:17.960]  and they said no it was just made in the basement and then the white house was on sypro the anthrax
[2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:24.920]  fighting antibiotic on september 10 three and a half weeks before enemies of bush at american media
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:30.040]  who took photos of his daughters falling down drunk at austin and democrats and other people got
[2:27:30.040 --> 2:27:37.400]  mailed the weaponized anthrax the white house is on the drug to fight it but then they grab the doctor
[2:27:39.160 --> 2:27:45.480]  they commit him and then he dies in a straight jacket taking prescription Tylenol locked down
[2:27:45.480 --> 2:27:51.160]  but then the news says he committed suicide at his home but then local news admits he was killed
[2:27:51.160 --> 2:27:55.160]  at the mental institution why the fbi grabbed him taking his drug he dies
[2:27:55.160 --> 2:28:04.120]  so classic intelligence operation classic i mean that'd be like if the government came
[2:28:04.120 --> 2:28:08.760]  and grabbed me and took me to a mental institution and then i supposedly killed myself with drugs
[2:28:08.760 --> 2:28:13.400]  a day later and then they put on the news alex jones committed suicide and there was no mention
[2:28:13.400 --> 2:28:18.680]  that they grabbed me for no reason and put me in a mental institution because the doctor they've
[2:28:18.680 --> 2:28:23.240]  now pending on believed it was the government and was doing his own investigation and in contact
[2:28:23.240 --> 2:28:29.400]  with the fbi and they said look this guy's too close to us grab him kill him say he did it and
[2:28:29.400 --> 2:28:33.720]  now the dna has come out and other things proving it wasn't him at the mailbox so that's in the
[2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:37.720]  news but we'll talk about that with mike revero briefly coming up here because he's also an expert
[2:28:37.720 --> 2:28:46.200]  on that unmasking the mysteries mysterious seven seven conspiracy theory bbc and they go over the
[2:28:46.200 --> 2:28:50.600]  unbelievable coincidence of the drills that morning and peter powers who won't talk to the media
[2:28:50.600 --> 2:28:56.360]  he'll literally run and hide if he sees alternative media asking him about it and then they say dune
[2:28:56.360 --> 2:29:00.840]  clips uh john hill
[2:29:05.400 --> 2:29:08.440]  he lived in ireland where they arrested him and had him extradited to england
[2:29:09.720 --> 2:29:15.160]  for mailing people copies of the film uh he is uh he's really john hill from sheffield that's where
[2:29:15.160 --> 2:29:21.000]  the watsons are from his alias moidebe is a fictional character in the science fiction film dunes they
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:27.240]  make that sound like he's insane because of an internet handle a film starring sting and kyle
[2:29:29.000 --> 2:29:34.120]  mcluan about an intergalactic freedom fighting so they so they use that act like he's crazy
[2:29:34.840 --> 2:29:40.600]  none of the film is about dune he just has the internet handle moidebe so they say because
[2:29:40.600 --> 2:29:48.440]  that's an aerobic term that means he's a what a al-qaeda see so because of your internet handle
[2:29:48.440 --> 2:29:53.640]  you're now with al-qaeda and then it gets into he thinks he's jesus we're on the march the empires
[2:29:53.640 --> 2:30:03.080]  on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network this is alex jones and i want to tell you again

[2:33:19.720 --> 2:33:20.760]  snipe at me in here
[2:33:24.120 --> 2:33:28.520]  a document on moidebe's website reveals he believes he is the messiah and that george
[2:33:28.520 --> 2:33:33.720]  lucas wrote star wars that are being told telepathically to write it by the very force to which the
[2:33:33.720 --> 2:33:41.000]  films refer he's been arrested and facing extradition to uk on a charge of preventing the
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:45.480]  courts of justice by sending dvds of the seven seven ripple effect of the judge
[2:33:45.480 --> 2:33:48.760]  and the jury foreman in linked to the trial and the attacks
[2:33:52.360 --> 2:33:56.040]  this hasn't stopped the film alex jones jones who runs internet site
[2:33:56.040 --> 2:34:01.880]  and the u.s radio show devoted to conspiracy theories claims the seven seven ripple effect
[2:34:01.880 --> 2:34:05.640]  has been just exploding all over the website since hill's arrest
[2:34:05.640 --> 2:34:14.040]  i said exploding all over the web you know we don't run a conspiracy website peter powers of
[2:34:14.040 --> 2:34:19.160]  visor consultancy former head of scotland yard public relations said they ran a drill of the
[2:34:19.160 --> 2:34:25.240]  exact same trains and bus being exact being attacked in the exact same way the exact same time
[2:34:26.920 --> 2:34:29.960]  why did they do that as a cover story in case any government operatives
[2:34:29.960 --> 2:34:36.440]  get caught by other government agencies who aren't part of the staged attack the false flag
[2:34:36.440 --> 2:34:41.560]  they can say oh it's just part of a drill they camouflage the funding for the terror attack
[2:34:41.560 --> 2:34:49.160]  through the drill and it goes on and on and on i mean the white house right now publicly
[2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:56.840]  the last two white houses has wahhabiist suni groups attacking the iranian government
[2:34:56.840 --> 2:35:04.360]  on record and then obama goes on tv and says it's a conspiracy theory that the cia is involved in
[2:35:04.360 --> 2:35:12.200]  iran with this uh color revolution or that they have any terror groups operating when it's publicly
[2:35:12.200 --> 2:35:18.760]  admitted micro vero popping in for 1015 minutes from what really happened dot com i want to get
[2:35:18.760 --> 2:35:24.440]  you on on a host of issues but first off what do you know about synthia mckinney i heard you saying
[2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:28.520]  you were going to have her on last week i didn't hear if she was there or not but it's coming in
[2:35:28.520 --> 2:35:35.640]  here that israel attacks justice boat kidnaps human rights workers israel attacks her boat
[2:35:36.760 --> 2:35:44.280]  this is coming out being released by one of the aid organizations she's with today israeli
[2:35:44.280 --> 2:35:49.880]  occupation forces attacked and bombarded free gaza movement both the spirit of humanity
[2:35:49.880 --> 2:35:55.800]  abducting 21 human rights workers in 11 countries including nobel laureate maried
[2:35:57.080 --> 2:36:02.200]  marguerite and former u.s congresswoman synthi mckinney the passengers of crew are being forcibly
[2:36:02.760 --> 2:36:08.120]  dragged towards israel this is an outrageous violation of international law against us
[2:36:08.760 --> 2:36:13.880]  our boat was on israeli waters and we were on a human rights mission to gaza mike
[2:36:13.880 --> 2:36:20.840]  why does israel keep doing this this is bad pr to ram the boat a few weeks ago and almost sink it
[2:36:21.400 --> 2:36:26.280]  and then now to do this and they're in international waters i'm surprised they don't
[2:36:26.280 --> 2:36:30.360]  just pull a uss liberty and torpedo it and then say the easter bunny did it
[2:36:31.320 --> 2:36:37.560]  yeah it is a serious situation here they were in international waters uh they're actually in a port
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:43.160]  in israel now the ship has basically been hijacked by the israeli navy and uh the people
[2:36:43.160 --> 2:36:46.920]  basically taken into custody including six journalists and synthi mckinney
[2:36:46.920 --> 2:36:52.760]  and the aid workers what makes this extremely serious is that as you say the initial contact
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:36:57.640]  between the israeli navy and the aid book uh boat took place in international water
[2:36:57.640 --> 2:37:02.840]  and the israeli navy was actively jamming their navigation systems their gps their radar
[2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:07.480]  it was very difficult to get any messages out because of all the jamming they were reduced
[2:37:07.480 --> 2:37:12.760]  to trying to find where they were with a sextant and a compass and uh it was just a very very
[2:37:12.760 --> 2:37:16.920]  difficult situation was in the middle of the night uh when this this happened
[2:37:16.920 --> 2:37:22.120]  and of course the big situation here is the corporate media which made such a big stink
[2:37:22.120 --> 2:37:26.520]  about the arrest of the staffers at the british embassy in tehran and they were claiming it was
[2:37:26.520 --> 2:37:31.640]  a new hostage crisis they're staying silent about this the same media that was screaming about the
[2:37:31.640 --> 2:37:37.960]  samali pirates hijacking ships in samali territorial waters this hijacking in international waters
[2:37:37.960 --> 2:37:42.840]  involving humanitarian aid ship so far is not being mentioned at all on the american corporate
[2:37:42.840 --> 2:37:48.040]  media that i have found yet in fact uh it's really pretty much confined to the to the alternative
[2:37:48.040 --> 2:37:53.000]  media your radio show and our websites are the only ones actively working to get this story out
[2:37:54.040 --> 2:37:59.160]  well how do we know they were in international waters i mean i believe it is was extremely
[2:37:59.160 --> 2:38:04.840]  bold but uh a how do we confirm this and then b i guess that's why the mainstream media should
[2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:09.240]  be reporting on this the u.s embassy should be making a big deal out of this i mean even
[2:38:09.240 --> 2:38:14.280]  if israelis are quote the ally of the united states this would be an incident if the british
[2:38:14.280 --> 2:38:19.400]  government came out in international waters and ran that almost sunk a ship and then the next time
[2:38:19.400 --> 2:38:25.720]  it came by went and grabbed it and is towing it in to i guess disappear i mean what comes next if
[2:38:25.720 --> 2:38:30.600]  our media won't talk about it will they line sent the mckinney and the nobel laureate up and shoot
[2:38:30.600 --> 2:38:35.480]  him in the back of the head i mean that's what happened with the u.s is liberty well the situation
[2:38:35.480 --> 2:38:41.160]  here is definitely it's a tremendous diplomatic crisis here and the u.s can basically stand back
[2:38:41.160 --> 2:38:46.120]  and try and pretend it's no big deal but the reality is that this boat was carrying the very
[2:38:46.120 --> 2:38:52.360]  sort of materials that barack obama had just requested israel start to allow into gaza mostly
[2:38:52.360 --> 2:38:57.400]  bags of cement things like that construction materials and so what israel has basically
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:02.360]  done is thumb its nose at barack obama pretty much on the same day the congress just put through
[2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:07.240]  some new loan guarantees for israel to go on building settlements in the illegal occupied
[2:39:07.240 --> 2:39:14.680]  territories of of palestine and so it is amazing israel is basically uh... on top of simply this
[2:39:14.680 --> 2:39:20.120]  act of piracy on the high seas in this violation of international law israel is literally almost
[2:39:20.120 --> 2:39:25.160]  seems like daring the united states trying to do something or at least trying to show that the u.s
[2:39:25.160 --> 2:39:29.480]  can't do anything that the u.s is going to be forced to go on spending money in israel
[2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:32.920]  and israel is just going to do what it wants whether it's building more settlements
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:37.960]  or ceasing ships with former congresswomen on them israel is completely out of control here
[2:39:37.960 --> 2:39:42.120]  and they're basically i mean the move to make would be just let her bring the medicine and
[2:39:42.120 --> 2:39:50.760]  cement in and then it wouldn't be a big p.r. koo for syntia mckinney and the free gaza groups
[2:39:50.760 --> 2:39:56.600]  i mean it's it's i guess just israel just does not care yeah israel doesn't care they they're
[2:39:56.600 --> 2:40:01.240]  convinced that if they spend enough money if they control enough media that their world
[2:40:01.240 --> 2:40:06.280]  image can be repaired i mean after the the disaster of operation cast lead uh... they're
[2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:10.360]  spending millions of dollars to run ads believe it or not they're even running ads on my radio
[2:40:10.360 --> 2:40:16.120]  show here on gcn and it's it's astounding the arrogance that's on display here uh... because
[2:40:16.120 --> 2:40:20.920]  you're right the world is seeing israel is literally trying to enforce mass starvation
[2:40:20.920 --> 2:40:26.280]  on the people of gaza hold on just a minute hold on just a minute mike who's running ads on your
[2:40:26.280 --> 2:40:33.000]  show believe it or not the israeli tourism authority is running ads on my show oh i know
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:40.040]  what that is that's that's uh... u.s a radio network news yeah that the that's yeah that
[2:40:40.040 --> 2:40:45.320]  they're not running ads on genesis that's uh... that's uh... news that stations request and about
[2:40:45.320 --> 2:40:50.440]  the only news out there is fox a bc in u.s a radio news job
[2:40:50.440 --> 2:40:55.400]  i've heard those ads uh... men that is just incredible uh... mike
[2:40:55.400 --> 2:41:00.760]  uh... well i mean it's just a disaster and do we know what's going to happen to senty
[2:41:00.760 --> 2:41:06.120]  and mckinney or are they going to water border or let her go or or will the media even care
[2:41:07.240 --> 2:41:12.600]  well the media obviously is not caring they're still all caught up with michael jackson and i've
[2:41:12.600 --> 2:41:17.320]  been around the tv channels this morning searching for any indication that this is even showing up
[2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:22.760]  on the radar of the corporate media and so far i haven't found it uh... it's all distraction out
[2:41:22.760 --> 2:41:27.640]  there in the uh... in the corporate media as far as what is going to happen hotheads has actually
[2:41:27.640 --> 2:41:33.240]  confirmed that the israeli navy did see is the ship so it's no longer just a case of rumor and it's
[2:41:33.240 --> 2:41:39.080]  oh just a free gaza people making spurious claims hotheads has confirmed that this has in fact happened
[2:41:39.080 --> 2:41:43.720]  the ship is in port uh... the crew and passengers are in custody right now
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:49.640]  what happens next is israel's going to make a big stink about violations of their national sovereignty
[2:41:49.640 --> 2:41:54.520]  forgetting of course that gaza is occupied territory and technically
[2:41:54.520 --> 2:41:59.320]  uh... you know israel doesn't have a say what goes on in gaza's waters of course we know
[2:41:59.320 --> 2:42:03.480]  that's definitely not what's going on israeli forces routinely
[2:42:03.480 --> 2:42:08.520]  uh... shoot up palestinian fishing boats because israel wants to harvest those waters
[2:42:08.520 --> 2:42:14.120]  and again this is all about forced starvation the israelis are literally trying to starve the gaza's
[2:42:14.120 --> 2:42:17.880]  into giving up and leaving because they israel covets that land
[2:42:20.120 --> 2:42:24.600]  well you know israel's argument on record is that we took the land over here from the
[2:42:24.600 --> 2:42:28.120]  native americans so what's wrong with them taking some of that land and they say hey
[2:42:28.120 --> 2:42:32.280]  you had no claim to the american indians our ancestors had some claim to this it's just
[2:42:32.280 --> 2:42:39.000]  incredible tribal warfare it it never seems to end and uh... it's it's a really scary on
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:44.520]  on on another note the video obviously surfaced we've got it up at info wars dot com and prison
[2:42:44.520 --> 2:42:49.720]  planet dot com but micro farah i want to get your view on obama saying i will never sign
[2:42:49.720 --> 2:42:55.000]  signing statements that go against the will of congress now he's signing seven huge signing
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:43:01.320]  statements literally drawing out whole areas of bills which really is a constitutional but he's
[2:43:01.320 --> 2:43:07.640]  ordering the bureaucracies to ignore congress and now saying he has that power so that's going on
[2:43:07.640 --> 2:43:12.440]  then we also have axle rod and others making the rounds on the sunday news shows saying
[2:43:12.440 --> 2:43:17.880]  yeah we're going to go ahead and raise taxes on everybody and on health care below two hundred
[2:43:17.880 --> 2:43:23.080]  fifty thousand dollars and they're saying obama promised to compromise so he made pledges he
[2:43:23.080 --> 2:43:29.080]  wouldn't raise taxes and he made pledges uh... he wouldn't do signing statements but now he made
[2:43:29.080 --> 2:43:32.120]  pledges to compromise that means lying to people
[2:43:32.120 --> 2:43:36.120]  i mean this guy is broken every promise he said he would
[2:43:37.800 --> 2:43:42.040]  yeah it's absolutely true i think the the the amount of time it takes for obama to break
[2:43:42.040 --> 2:43:48.200]  any of his promises can be measured with an egg timer these days and his word is absolutely worthless
[2:43:48.200 --> 2:43:51.560]  uh... and maybe we ought to sell egg timers that say obama truth
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:43:57.080]  measuring device or something like that but it uh... really he's he's been this incredible
[2:43:57.080 --> 2:44:03.080]  disappointment because we all i know you didn't you know but there were so many people who supported
[2:44:03.080 --> 2:44:09.880]  him as at least marginally better than john mccain because we were you know expecting that there
[2:44:09.880 --> 2:44:13.560]  were going to be changes brought in it was going to be the white house and congress were going to
[2:44:13.560 --> 2:44:18.440]  be in democratic hands we expected there would be changes it isn't nothing has changed at all
[2:44:18.440 --> 2:44:22.200]  uh... our soldiers are still in iraq yes they're leaving the cities
[2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:25.960]  which is kind of a token cosmetic thing only but they're not leaving iraq they're just
[2:44:25.960 --> 2:44:29.800]  moving to more difficult quarters they're changing their locations within iraq but
[2:44:29.800 --> 2:44:34.760]  they're still garrisoning the country it's still a u.s vassal state they're still trying to kick up
[2:44:34.760 --> 2:44:41.400]  a war in iran with this provocation of the attempted coup d'etat and uh... it really is i am convinced
[2:44:41.400 --> 2:44:46.920]  our government knows that the end is near for the economy and that the only way they can survive
[2:44:46.920 --> 2:44:52.200]  is to kick up a major war on which they can blame the economic hardships because otherwise
[2:44:52.200 --> 2:44:56.600]  absent a major war the american people are going to put the blame for the destroyed economy right
[2:44:56.600 --> 2:45:03.720]  where it belongs on the federal government might briefly on every front this bill does
[2:45:03.720 --> 2:45:10.440]  the feds to federalize the whole country under water rights of this uh... clean water restoration
[2:45:10.440 --> 2:45:15.720]  act the bill to give the federal reserve power over all financial operations and quote anything
[2:45:15.720 --> 2:45:21.480]  that affects the economy so the entire nation bills to restrict and ban most types of firearms
[2:45:21.480 --> 2:45:30.920]  compulsory service uh... the global carbon tax uh... total amnesty i've never seen such a wild rush
[2:45:30.920 --> 2:45:36.680]  to get it all done and the hate crimes legislation passing the house word for word saying if you
[2:45:36.680 --> 2:45:42.600]  hurt someone's feelings you're going to be arrested no more free speech i mean it this is
[2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:48.200]  they know we're waking up to him so they're just going for broke right now that's exactly right
[2:45:48.200 --> 2:45:52.840]  this is a big rush it's a big hurry they know that they're it's an erase against the clock because
[2:45:52.840 --> 2:45:58.360]  the american people are waking up uh... i'm i'm surprised that the american people haven't been
[2:45:58.360 --> 2:46:03.320]  writing to this point but it has to happen at some point there's going to be a catalyzing event
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:07.160]  where the american people are going to say okay we can't go on pretending that this is going to
[2:46:07.160 --> 2:46:11.960]  correct itself the government is completely out of control it is a tyrannical dictatorship
[2:46:11.960 --> 2:46:17.080]  it is a fascist economy uh... they're basically moving to slam the door on all of us to make
[2:46:17.080 --> 2:46:21.240]  us so helpless we can't fight back and we've got to decide that we're going to fight back while we
[2:46:21.240 --> 2:46:27.160]  still have the means and the option to do so well mike the reason i knew obama was bad news is
[2:46:27.880 --> 2:46:31.240]  eight nine months before the election he was saying some really good things and i said well
[2:46:31.240 --> 2:46:35.720]  this guy if he's for real they're going to put a bullet in him or or they're going to bring some
[2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:41.640]  scandal out and get rid of him but then as he started to get ready to win he started flip
[2:46:41.640 --> 2:46:47.480]  flopping on almost everything i saw his advisors i saw him getting four times the wall street money
[2:46:47.480 --> 2:46:52.680]  that john mccain did so it wasn't that i was for john mccain i just knew that obama was the chosen
[2:46:52.680 --> 2:46:57.480]  one and of the establishment was saying he was the chosen one there was no way he was going to
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:47:05.160]  honor all these pledges the solemn pledges he had made and so now it's just total betrayal
[2:47:05.160 --> 2:47:11.080]  and when i see him go to the middle east and say i want to be friends with iran
[2:47:11.080 --> 2:47:15.560]  a month ago i went on air and i said they're about to try to overthrow him during this election
[2:47:15.560 --> 2:47:19.800]  sure enough that happened and he's lying saying the cia isn't involved when they're
[2:47:19.800 --> 2:47:25.240]  involved on record so obama says he's not involved in the honduran coup and now it
[2:47:25.240 --> 2:47:31.960]  comes out the cia is running the whole thing i mean it's just this guy is a good liar he's the
[2:47:31.960 --> 2:47:38.600]  best liar we've seen a long time he's very very wicked i mean because he enjoys lying he really
[2:47:38.600 --> 2:47:46.440]  does a good job of it uh and so it's very scary but but final point i'd like to hear from you on
[2:47:46.440 --> 2:47:50.600]  you've really done great research what really happened dot com on the anthrax case in three
[2:47:50.600 --> 2:47:55.080]  minutes or less break down that whole saga and then them grabbing him and killing him in the
[2:47:55.080 --> 2:48:00.360]  mental institution now the dna comes out proving it wasn't him the third patsy because that ties
[2:48:00.360 --> 2:48:05.320]  into this bbc they've grabbed and arrested this guy that made this seven seven documentary and
[2:48:05.320 --> 2:48:11.000]  now they're saying he's schizophrenic and thinks he's god uh this seems to be their favorite mo
[2:48:11.960 --> 2:48:16.440]  well this is a tactic that's right out of the the soviet union uh anybody who had information
[2:48:16.440 --> 2:48:20.120]  that was damaging to the government and they couldn't disprove or discredit him they'd declare
[2:48:20.120 --> 2:48:24.520]  them insane and lock them in a mental hospital and the the the media would basically say well you
[2:48:24.520 --> 2:48:29.960]  can't listen to anything this guy says because he's a nutcase and this is a common tactic and the us
[2:48:29.960 --> 2:48:35.400]  is certainly used to before uh jim garrison's trial you were talking about uh the shaken bake tactic
[2:48:35.400 --> 2:48:41.240]  jim garrison's trial against clay shaw was destroyed by a witness who sounded really good and convincing
[2:48:41.240 --> 2:48:45.560]  up until he started admitting that he was worried about his daughter being replaced by a duplicate
[2:48:45.560 --> 2:48:50.760]  and completely destroyed garrison's case as far as the anthrax case is concerned they've been trying
[2:48:50.760 --> 2:48:55.320]  to blame it on arabs and so forth and so on when that fell apart they started to find a patsy the
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:49:00.680]  bottom line is the hartford corrent reported there was a scientist actually caught entering the storage
[2:49:00.680 --> 2:49:06.600]  area where the anthrax was kept without authorization after being fired over a racially motivated
[2:49:06.600 --> 2:49:11.080]  attack on an egyptian co-worker that scientist has never been investigated but investigated by
[2:49:11.080 --> 2:49:16.920]  the fbi he's still working within the us defense establishment he is very protected we have this
[2:49:16.920 --> 2:49:21.800]  core of people who can do anything they want and they're never touched by the law they're above the
[2:49:21.800 --> 2:49:27.720]  law we saw that with the apax by case with rosen and wiseman they were never arrested now uh
[2:49:27.720 --> 2:49:34.040]  uh they're contacting the office of special plans uh he's being cut free uh there's this
[2:49:34.040 --> 2:49:39.000]  protected core of subversives within our government they can't be touched no matter what they do
[2:49:41.320 --> 2:49:45.720]  yeah there's a whole bunch of cores of subversives you can do whatever they want but they had to at
[2:49:45.720 --> 2:49:53.080]  least burn made off and the other scammer out of texas looks like uh he's gonna get in trouble but uh
[2:49:53.080 --> 2:50:01.240]  my god it's it's just really incredible to see all of this come into pass i mean mike everything
[2:50:01.240 --> 2:50:06.760]  the new world order is built everything the globalists have worked so hard to set up we're now at the
[2:50:06.760 --> 2:50:11.000]  point where they're trying to put the capstone on the pyramid but under them the whole pyramid
[2:50:11.000 --> 2:50:17.640]  shaking and falling apart they've got an army of ants fixing the pyramid as it's collapsing so they're
[2:50:17.640 --> 2:50:23.880]  building it as fast as it's collapsing uh it is a losing battle though the new world order will
[2:50:23.880 --> 2:50:30.520]  fall humanity will defeat them i absolutely agree uh they've waited too long too late and they never
[2:50:30.520 --> 2:50:35.880]  quite understood just how the alternative media and the internet change the fundamental flow of

[3:00:41.640 --> 3:00:49.640]  they are just simply swimming in the ether into which they were born but we attempt to understand
[3:00:49.640 --> 3:00:56.680]  popular culture we attempt to from the outside look in on it and hopefully enter the matrix and
[3:00:56.680 --> 3:01:02.200]  remove some of the mind slaves from the system and try to get them to see outside the box at the
[3:01:02.200 --> 3:01:10.280]  larger world now again i should pay more attention to popular culture i i pay attention to the news
[3:01:10.280 --> 3:01:15.800]  to congress legislation to technology trade publications i don't really know much about
[3:01:15.800 --> 3:01:21.400]  paris hilton and michael jackson i just know he likes little kids and gives them the jesus juice
[3:01:22.520 --> 3:01:30.840]  but spencer pratt and his girlfriend are some of the hottest reality tv stars out there and i
[3:01:30.840 --> 3:01:35.400]  started getting all these calls and emails and twitters yesterday about the girl that plays
[3:01:35.400 --> 3:01:41.880]  hannah montana this siris girl which i do know a little bit about i i try to tune it out
[3:01:42.760 --> 3:01:50.600]  the you know 20 vehicle to sell products to the 20s uh and uh that somebody was twittering her and
[3:01:50.600 --> 3:01:56.760]  she was asking what is info wars so that led us down this path to spencer pratt uh who everybody
[3:01:56.760 --> 3:02:01.640]  in the office knows who he is so i i plead ignorance i read upon him last night and i've heard he's

[3:02:06.200 --> 3:02:11.240]  to have somebody like that become aware of what's going on and kind of as a reach into the matrix
[3:02:11.240 --> 3:02:16.040]  and reach more of these people in the false reality that is modern television and this

[3:03:05.800 --> 3:03:12.520]  a copy of the obama deception and then end game and then we watched uh masters of tears and the
[3:03:12.520 --> 3:03:19.240]  nine eleven chronicles matrix the evil police state trilogy american dictators i mean we've
[3:03:19.240 --> 3:03:28.520]  we watched i mean my head's gonna spray without stone okay so you've got your wife uh hidey on
[3:03:28.520 --> 3:03:33.720]  with you as well i apologize i've forgotten that i've seen you guys have gotten married uh how long
[3:03:33.720 --> 3:03:39.800]  ago did you guys start researching this uh hidey and spencer um i would say several months ago but
[3:03:39.800 --> 3:03:46.120]  i've always been a big christian so i knew about the march of the beast and you know the anti christ
[3:03:46.120 --> 3:03:53.080]  and the end of the world but i just never realized who it was i always knew it would come i felt like
[3:03:53.080 --> 3:03:59.160]  in my time since i was a child but this is a whole different awakening with that and with what's
[3:03:59.160 --> 3:04:05.240]  really going on every day in the world well i don't think the establishment's gonna like you guys uh

[3:04:17.240 --> 3:04:23.320]  but i mean all over pop magazines tv david letterman all these other shows uh maybe you
[3:04:23.320 --> 3:04:27.480]  can also explain to me because i know about the new world order and about the whole control grid
[3:04:27.480 --> 3:04:34.360]  but also uh maybe you can explain to me and others exactly what this phenomenon is of your type of
[3:04:34.360 --> 3:04:39.640]  celebrity as well so we can better understand how to reach out to these uh young people so we've

[3:08:07.160 --> 3:08:18.600]  Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montauk Pratt actors from the hills on mtv and a bunch of other
[3:08:19.480 --> 3:08:26.200]  reality tv shows are on with us and again the reason i'm doing this is everybody keeps talking
[3:08:26.200 --> 3:08:34.360]  about twitter for the last year as folks know the revolution in iran the cia was pumping the
[3:08:34.360 --> 3:08:39.560]  state department through twitter that that's even mainstream news and so we're getting all
[3:08:39.560 --> 3:08:47.080]  these calls and thousands of twitter messages about miley cirrus the billy ray cirrus's
[3:08:47.080 --> 3:08:52.600]  daughter the place hannah montana which of course everybody knows this is a giant icon now with
[3:08:52.600 --> 3:09:02.120]  little girls and and teenagers out there that uh spencer pratt and uh hidey montauk we're sitting
[3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:07.240]  there twittering her and she's saying what's info wars and so then that gets all these young girls
[3:09:07.240 --> 3:09:12.200]  and teenagers to go look at info wars dot com so that's great this is exactly who we want to reach
[3:09:12.200 --> 3:09:15.880]  we want these kids at least to stop drinking sodium fluoride that gives them bone cancer
[3:09:15.880 --> 3:09:20.760]  dental fluorosis and brain damage and calcifies every major organ and causes pancreatic cancer
[3:09:20.760 --> 3:09:24.920]  and diabetes you can google each one of those terms and get mainstream news admitting that
[3:09:24.920 --> 3:09:30.680]  we want girls to know that a lot of these uh birth control uh drugs actually sterilize them
[3:09:30.680 --> 3:09:35.640]  we want women to know the un's been caught adding sterilization hormones to tetanus shots
[3:09:35.640 --> 3:09:40.920]  we want to reach young women especially who are targeted by the globalist and so this is kind of
[3:09:40.920 --> 3:09:47.720]  an inrun in the back door of the uh cultural mind control system to have somebody like spencer pratt
[3:09:47.720 --> 3:09:54.680]  and hidey montauk pratt uh on with us because the system is using these type of young icons to keep
[3:09:54.680 --> 3:09:58.520]  people in the matrix to have them breaking out of the matrix is a big deal so i'm going to try to
[3:09:58.520 --> 3:10:04.520]  shut up for a few minutes and let spencer pratt and hidey montauk uh husband and wife talk about
[3:10:04.520 --> 3:10:10.520]  your awakening to the new world order the films and now what you want to say in your message that
[3:10:10.520 --> 3:10:15.720]  has been followed by young people uh where you're going with this information that you've now
[3:10:15.720 --> 3:10:22.920]  discovered uh well like i said you know it's a recent awakening i really do feel like we took
[3:10:22.920 --> 3:10:28.600]  the the blue pill or whatever in matrix and i feel like you really did pull it out little mechanical
[3:10:28.600 --> 3:10:35.320]  thing out the back of my brain because uh hidey and i both are as i should say spidey have have
[3:10:35.320 --> 3:10:41.480]  read to the situation we were out of this planet where you know there's so much attention and focus
[3:10:41.480 --> 3:10:48.200]  on so many the wrong issues like for instance ourselves like how are we so famous when you
[3:10:48.200 --> 3:10:53.480]  know the climate bill is not even a trending topic on twitter for us three days i've just kept on
[3:10:53.480 --> 3:10:58.360]  asking everybody out as my followers how is this not a trending topic we got everything
[3:10:58.360 --> 3:11:04.920]  for michael jackson uh you know jimmy fox was a trending topic oh even how i ran was a trending
[3:11:04.920 --> 3:11:10.520]  topic but nothing about you know the biggest bill you know since the patriot are getting passed
[3:11:10.520 --> 3:11:14.520]  with nobody reading it and the people who do want to read it they say you can't even read it and
[3:11:14.520 --> 3:11:19.240]  they're not even giving anybody time and they're changing the name of the bill and i mean it's just
[3:11:19.240 --> 3:11:23.560]  it's mind-boggling that they're trying to say there's global warming right now and you know that
[3:11:23.560 --> 3:11:28.040]  the ice caps are melting and the polar bears are going to drown and we all know about the
[3:11:28.040 --> 3:11:33.800]  builders of the polar bears we mean the new pieces of ice and we all know that uh at least anybody
[3:11:33.800 --> 3:11:39.000]  who does their research based on does knows that it was the coolest winter in years in an arctic
[3:11:39.000 --> 3:11:45.720]  that was a 30 percent right yeah almost almost 40 percent it got it got larger and thicker
[3:11:46.280 --> 3:11:52.200]  so i mean it's just shocking to me and after i watched your dvds and you know if this isn't
[3:11:52.200 --> 3:11:58.520]  conspiracy theories these are factual evidence it's just stuff that the mainstream media does not
[3:11:58.520 --> 3:12:03.960]  present to the public you don't see you know i didn't learn any of this i went to usc for eight
[3:12:03.960 --> 3:12:10.520]  years this is the craziest thing ready for this my best friend since kindergarten is a 180 iq
[3:12:10.520 --> 3:12:17.560]  trillion mathematician genius you know he got top of his class usd marshal school of business
[3:12:17.560 --> 3:12:22.280]  you know he's a peak time investment banker i called him the other day i said real quick i said
[3:12:22.280 --> 3:12:28.600]  brian serious question i do you know the federal reserve is is a private company and it's not
[3:12:28.600 --> 3:12:33.960]  federal as if this is federal is federal express and he goes what are you talking about he goes yes
[3:12:33.960 --> 3:12:40.440]  it is and i'm arguing here with my genius genius friend who lives and breathes business and everything
[3:12:40.440 --> 3:12:46.120]  and he was shocked like i just told him you know i don't even know what i told him he was so just
[3:12:46.120 --> 3:12:50.680]  shocked and blown away by the fact that he couldn't believe that the federal reserve that he you know
[3:12:50.680 --> 3:12:56.520]  he's been to business school and he doesn't even know this and i mean i felt dirty almost threw up
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:13:01.720]  but i had to tell my friend who's an investment banker who works for a major firm that the federal
[3:13:01.720 --> 3:13:08.600]  reserve is not is not a you know american part of the the government you know incredible so
[3:13:09.320 --> 3:13:14.040]  we also want to get a hidey to pop in here when did you first start waking up you said one of your
[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:21.960]  managers or one of hidey's managers gave you the obama deception music producer of mine and we
[3:13:21.960 --> 3:13:27.080]  were in the studio one night and he was watching this and he said you guys need to watch this you
[3:13:27.080 --> 3:13:31.480]  need to know you're the youth of america you need to know what's going on in america you need to know
[3:13:31.480 --> 3:13:37.560]  what's going on in this world and i've always been he's yeah i call him dumb head but we didn't know
[3:13:38.120 --> 3:13:45.000]  so we started watching this and then censor ordered every single dvd and then non-stop
[3:13:45.000 --> 3:13:50.760]  researching your website and the internet and everything now for at least a month all day every
[3:13:50.760 --> 3:13:55.800]  day so we've just been trying to figure out the truth and i've always been a very big christian
[3:13:55.800 --> 3:14:01.320]  so i've always known you know the mark of the beast and anti christ and jesus coming back so
[3:14:01.880 --> 3:14:07.160]  to me it all makes sense it's not a foreign concept and especially now that they're trying to do the
[3:14:07.160 --> 3:14:12.840]  tips i you will have to kill me before i get a tip that would never happen the fact that people are
[3:14:12.840 --> 3:14:19.000]  even already okay with this is thickening i could throw up right now a chip are we dogs dogs don't
[3:14:19.000 --> 3:14:26.520]  even deserve it well absolutely in fact have you guys seen all the newscast saying we all need
[3:14:26.520 --> 3:14:31.080]  chips old people need them prisoners the troops a lot of them have been secretly chipped the
[3:14:31.080 --> 3:14:36.600]  mexican herney general made his employees take chips and now to get in the cool clubs in europe
[3:14:36.600 --> 3:14:42.280]  in the us they want you to take a chip uh and and they've got federal officials going around
[3:14:42.280 --> 3:14:47.640]  telling people we all need to take chips and the churches aren't saying anything because they've
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:54.280]  been 501c3 federalized and and you have the clergy response teams where fema has secretly
[3:14:54.280 --> 3:15:01.240]  federalized the churches i mean this is this is very serious this is very serious and it says
[3:15:01.240 --> 3:15:06.360]  in the bible that is the mark of the beast and that is the sign of worshiping the devil so over
[3:15:06.360 --> 3:15:14.440]  my dead body would i ever get a chip in my body my body belongs to jesus christ to god alone and
[3:15:14.440 --> 3:15:19.640]  no one will ever put anything in me i will not worship the devil i will not be conformed to
[3:15:19.640 --> 3:15:26.040]  this world that will not happen and people should stand up because i am not you know being covered
[3:15:26.040 --> 3:15:31.720]  up by fema right now i am a disciple of jesus and i will speak out to christians and i will let
[3:15:31.720 --> 3:15:36.920]  people know this is not right this is well we may have to put you in the homeland security
[3:15:36.920 --> 3:15:41.240]  myac report what do you guys think about all these reports saying gun owners christians
[3:15:41.240 --> 3:15:46.840]  conservatives people that won't accept the new world order are terrorist and homeland security
[3:15:46.840 --> 3:15:53.640]  was really set up for us not for al-qaeda i mean it's just so terrifying if you look at history
[3:15:53.640 --> 3:15:58.440]  when they start taking away your gun rights just like hitler did just like moose the looney did
[3:15:58.440 --> 3:16:03.800]  just like i'm now the dumb did it's like that's when you know i mean i'm i'm i need to learn
[3:16:03.800 --> 3:16:09.000]  the constitution way better but i know there's uh you'll know the quote but something about uh
[3:16:09.000 --> 3:16:15.560]  when the the lawful take away your guns they become the unlawful is that it well yeah the
[3:16:15.560 --> 3:16:19.560]  declaration of independence uh states over and over again that when the government becomes
[3:16:19.560 --> 3:16:24.200]  abusive and oppressive at your right to go up against them and that the constitution bill
[3:16:24.200 --> 3:16:28.760]  rights only points out your god-given rights rights you already had it's kind of like they had laws
[3:16:28.760 --> 3:16:34.520]  that black people weren't human beings but natural law said they were human beings and had a right
[3:16:34.520 --> 3:16:38.680]  if somebody was beating them up with a head with a bull whip to jerk the whip away and kill the
[3:16:38.680 --> 3:16:44.040]  person that was doing it so kind of like nazi germany they said you know hitler said it was his
[3:16:44.040 --> 3:16:49.480]  law that he could kill whoever he wanted but the people really had a right to stand up against
[3:16:49.480 --> 3:16:55.000]  hitler and try to stop him so i mean that's really what's happening there is that tyranny
[3:16:55.000 --> 3:17:00.360]  always tries to disarm the people what are your friends saying in the last few months as you guys
[3:17:00.360 --> 3:17:08.120]  have been kind of getting away from being so obsessed with image or tv or success and fame
[3:17:08.120 --> 3:17:12.040]  uh you know which is the number one goal of most people now in the united states and
[3:17:12.040 --> 3:17:17.160]  worldwide uh into these type of subjects what are your what are your friends and family and
[3:17:17.160 --> 3:17:22.280]  neighbors and colleagues saying i mean they're all you know because media has been so good
[3:17:22.280 --> 3:17:27.800]  at labeling you know you know anybody with facts and trying to you know take away from the status
[3:17:27.800 --> 3:17:32.920]  course conspiracy theories so at first they're like oh you know there is to make them just the
[3:17:32.920 --> 3:17:38.920]  truth feels crazy but the reality is you give them an obama deception dvd and you say how about we
[3:17:38.920 --> 3:17:43.800]  have this conversation after you watch this dvd next thing you know you got i got my friends
[3:17:43.800 --> 3:17:49.080]  you know twittering info wars you know and and that's just so powerful it's just they have you
[3:17:49.080 --> 3:17:54.760]  have to be presented with the facts and nobody ever is and that's why i'm so i feel so privileged
[3:17:54.760 --> 3:17:59.400]  that god did give us the opportunity to have so many people be aware of us whether they're like
[3:17:59.400 --> 3:18:04.760]  us or not they have their voice to hear our voice and my voice is now going to be be aware of the
[3:18:04.760 --> 3:18:10.200]  info wars that are attacking your mind and you know it's just it's just so sick because i mean once
[3:18:10.200 --> 3:18:15.160]  you really put us on the floor i like my dad who's a dentist has been telling me my whole life
[3:18:15.160 --> 3:18:19.720]  do not use toothpaste with fluoride you know you don't listen to your dad especially when he's a
[3:18:19.720 --> 3:18:25.160]  dentist he's just like eh i don't want to use my bleaching toothpaste i'm not listening to you
[3:18:25.160 --> 3:18:30.040]  and then i'll watch you documentaries and and you are a science about you know what fluoride
[3:18:30.040 --> 3:18:34.760]  does and how they use fluoride in concentration camps and fluoride was the first thing put in
[3:18:34.760 --> 3:18:40.520]  the water for Iraqi people and if right now you know how hard it is for me to go to market
[3:18:40.520 --> 3:18:46.760]  and even find a drinking water bottle that says fluoride free or even to find a toothpaste that
[3:18:46.760 --> 3:18:51.320]  says fluoride free but i'm trying to stock up on these because they don't even exist anymore
[3:18:51.320 --> 3:19:00.600]  yeah what a small world my dad's a dentist too wow well small world now uh guys uh
[3:19:00.600 --> 3:19:04.680]  Heidi we're about to go to break but what has it been like for you talking to friends and
[3:19:04.680 --> 3:19:09.720]  family and neighbors now that you're kind of shifting your view they take me very seriously
[3:19:09.720 --> 3:19:15.160]  because i've always been a very serious Christian and most Christians understand what's going on
[3:19:15.160 --> 3:19:19.320]  they understand they're being persecuted they understand this is the end of the world
[3:19:19.320 --> 3:19:25.480]  they understand the new world order the one world currency is all in revelations in the bible
[3:19:25.480 --> 3:19:30.200]  so they're taking me very seriously and they know when i mean something that it's a message and
[3:19:30.200 --> 3:19:37.080]  i'm not just full of things and i tell the truth and you know Jesus says to hate evil and to cling
[3:19:37.080 --> 3:19:43.880]  what is good you know so also we're being a knot and i mean it's just a very scary thing and first

[3:24:14.520 --> 3:24:17.560]  after this one and i'll get into a bunch of other questions maybe we'll take a few calls
[3:24:19.240 --> 3:24:24.760]  heidi you were trying to tell a story before we hit that break i was just saying about birth control
[3:24:24.760 --> 3:24:29.960]  because i got very scared about it the other day and i felt like god was telling me that this was
[3:24:29.960 --> 3:24:35.000]  something just created by the government that is really bad for my body and i was just getting sick
[3:24:35.640 --> 3:24:41.800]  and i researched it and one of the uh founding people who invented birth control said it was
[3:24:41.800 --> 3:24:47.720]  the worst thing that they've ever done they wish they never created it how it morally
[3:24:47.720 --> 3:24:55.160]  corrupted society is just sticking to him how it devalues women how it causes depression
[3:24:55.160 --> 3:25:00.840]  how it can cause cancer how it sterilizes your body and what it does to your body
[3:25:00.840 --> 3:25:07.640]  how most women are suicidal sometimes on it and in fact in two in order to even stabilize
[3:25:07.640 --> 3:25:13.640]  the population right now each woman would have to have three children that the population is
[3:25:13.640 --> 3:25:19.320]  decreasing so much that population control is just a myth that's right because the eugenicists
[3:25:19.320 --> 3:25:24.120]  want to kill the west because they see that as their competition then they're going to kill the
[3:25:24.120 --> 3:25:29.400]  third world but that's the key for all these racist white people that go yeah kill the africans
[3:25:29.400 --> 3:25:34.600]  kill the asians yeah we need to get rid of them they're being reduced as well and and exactly
[3:25:34.600 --> 3:25:40.600]  europe's got 1.3 population the united states we take out the illegal alien influx it's about 1.4
[3:25:41.480 --> 3:25:46.840]  so that's a really so so you guys really do know your stuff on this you really i guess had a crash
[3:25:46.840 --> 3:25:53.240]  course in all of this or were you already aware of aware of a lot of these issues before you saw
[3:25:53.240 --> 3:25:59.560]  my films no your film definitely put us in a crash course schooling system we needed to really learn
[3:25:59.560 --> 3:26:05.960]  our facts and it inspired us to a whole new level and we love our guns we go shooting all the time
[3:26:05.960 --> 3:26:12.120]  we love our guns my dad loves his guns and they're for your protection they're not taking it out of
[3:26:12.120 --> 3:26:16.760]  the hands of bad guys they're the ones who can still get the guns they're the ones who will have
[3:26:16.760 --> 3:26:22.440]  the guns in the streets and the people the police officers who you know abuse their authority as i've
[3:26:22.440 --> 3:26:29.800]  seen many times in your case it makes me disgusted and i hate what is evil and i feel so bad for the
[3:26:29.800 --> 3:26:34.600]  people in this world because they just have no idea what's going on and i'm praying for this world
[3:26:34.600 --> 3:26:39.880]  and i'm praying for obama and i'm praying that these people will somehow get a conscience or
[3:26:39.880 --> 3:26:47.160]  something because it's just sick and saddening and i really i know the end is very near well
[3:26:47.160 --> 3:26:51.880]  certainly the end of the civilization as we know it because of technological developments and
[3:26:51.880 --> 3:26:57.640]  all the other lines that are projecting right now to this mega crossroads this this this key time
[3:26:58.200 --> 3:27:05.720]  that society is entering right now specifically with the girl that plays Hannah Montana
[3:27:06.680 --> 3:27:14.600]  this Cyrus girl who is such a mega star around the world one of you guys was texting her from
[3:27:14.600 --> 3:27:20.120]  the exchange i saw and we posted at prisonplanet.com and she said what is info wars and just from that
[3:27:20.120 --> 3:27:24.680]  we got thousands of twitter's and emails and more pouring in the day from new listeners
[3:27:24.680 --> 3:27:29.800]  and young people trying to find out what's going on and you know trying to discover what's happening
[3:27:29.800 --> 3:27:35.240]  i mean that is so valuable to see that going on i hope that you guys and others can reach out
[3:27:36.120 --> 3:27:41.800]  to miss cyrus and explain to her she's being used by the globalists who want to restrict free
[3:27:41.800 --> 3:27:47.560]  speech with the cyber bullying act that states and i'm going to read it after the break word for
[3:27:47.560 --> 3:27:52.760]  word that if you hurt someone's feelings the government's going to come charge you with a
[3:27:52.760 --> 3:27:57.480]  felony and put you in prison the end of the first amendment i mean obviously bullying isn't a nice
[3:27:57.480 --> 3:28:03.160]  thing but having the feds come arrest people for their speech uh this is i don't think she wants
[3:28:03.160 --> 3:28:09.800]  to be known as the person that helped kill america no and i know miley and i she's a great girl and
[3:28:09.800 --> 3:28:14.840]  i was twittering her about it because i want everyone to be aware about it and she had no idea
[3:28:14.840 --> 3:28:21.000]  and it's very hard to find out about you because they try to keep info wars and alex jones everything
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:26.840]  very hidden and secretive because they know that the weapon used against them is truth and truth
[3:28:26.840 --> 3:28:31.880]  hurts and that's what they're trying to hide from everyone and you know we want to make everyone
[3:28:31.880 --> 3:28:37.000]  aware of what's going on before it's too late and i saw what you're saying about the bully act and
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:43.480]  that is just robbing everyone of freedom of speech that's saying if i put up a bible verse on my twitter
[3:28:43.480 --> 3:28:48.760]  then i can be hurting people's feelings and be persecuted for it and that's not america and it's
[3:28:48.760 --> 3:28:56.360]  so sad that it's gotten this far well i want to be clear we're not saying that miley syris is bad
[3:28:56.360 --> 3:29:02.040]  and i said that day one i said she was being used no of course yeah i'm agreeing with you she just
[3:29:02.040 --> 3:29:08.040]  she hasn't known none of us know it's very hard to find out so the fact that she showed interest
[3:29:08.040 --> 3:29:15.160]  in this really made a big difference to so many little girls and to so many people that is just
[3:29:15.160 --> 3:29:21.400]  it was such a blessing have you gotten any feedback from her about uh the cyber bullying now i haven't
[3:29:21.400 --> 3:29:25.800]  but i'm definitely going to talk to her about it i want to talk to her in person about it too and
[3:29:25.800 --> 3:29:30.280]  well the minute you do please let us know because i want to get you on to tell us what she said or
[3:29:30.280 --> 3:29:35.480]  get her on with you that would be huge to have miley syris on here but if the cia here's they're
[3:29:35.480 --> 3:29:40.040]  going to contact her daddy who's all mobbed up with the government i mean i'm sure he's a friendly
[3:29:40.040 --> 3:29:44.920]  person as well and probably try to stop her from coming on but they definitely don't want the info
[3:29:44.920 --> 3:29:51.880]  or going all those young girls stay there uh heidi and spencer this is amazing information we're on

[3:32:55.880 --> 3:33:14.040]  again that number 1-800-409-5633 Heidi is our guest so is Spencer Mr. and Mr. Pratt
[3:33:14.600 --> 3:33:21.000]  honey Montag and Spencer Pratt here and literally i had no idea how big these guests
[3:33:21.000 --> 3:33:25.560]  are in the whole pop culture thing the whole office knows who they are jaren's like a fan
[3:33:25.560 --> 3:33:31.080]  he was telling me i read people magazine every week and uh you'll keep track of this and i think
[3:33:31.080 --> 3:33:35.480]  they're misunderstood by the media and that's what bermas is saying jason here in the office he's
[3:33:35.480 --> 3:33:42.440]  saying that the media enjoys quote throwing you guys under the bus can you explain that to me uh
[3:33:43.560 --> 3:33:47.800]  because what i'm getting here from the office is is you guys are all over tv all over the news
[3:33:47.800 --> 3:33:52.600]  covers of magazines you know when i started looking into you yesterday i recognized your faces and
[3:33:52.600 --> 3:33:56.280]  names even though i hadn't really been paying attention to pop culture because i've got to
[3:33:56.280 --> 3:34:00.680]  remember that pop culture is where it's all at most americans don't even check the news
[3:34:00.680 --> 3:34:07.560]  much less go deep into it so uh what is your relationship with the media uh we used to have a
[3:34:07.560 --> 3:34:12.440]  phenomenal relationship with the media they've kind of turned on us now because they've created us
[3:34:12.440 --> 3:34:19.560]  into such a monstrous same monster in their opinion that like we like for instance certain
[3:34:19.560 --> 3:34:25.240]  websites can't even have us on their website because we are overshadowing all the other
[3:34:25.240 --> 3:34:29.080]  stars that they're trying to promote and everything like they made us too big like
[3:34:29.080 --> 3:34:34.680]  they're abominatized us and now they kind of made mistakes because there are other people
[3:34:34.680 --> 3:34:39.480]  they're trying to promote don't even have value on their websites anymore so you know they kind of
[3:34:39.480 --> 3:34:45.560]  turned on us but in the beginning the reason why we got so big is because the girl television show
[3:34:45.560 --> 3:34:51.560]  the reality show we were both on uh this the narrator didn't get along with us so she's the
[3:34:51.560 --> 3:34:58.680]  narrator so the skewer the manipulation of the angle of being able to narrate the show just like
[3:34:58.680 --> 3:35:04.440]  american government can narrate our media it's the same exact principles like so they can either
[3:35:04.440 --> 3:35:09.240]  put a positive right on you or a negative right we took the negative right and and smiled and went
[3:35:09.240 --> 3:35:14.760]  with it and you know we're very appreciative of you know good press negative press whatever
[3:35:14.760 --> 3:35:20.200]  because then again now we have a bigger you know reach to talk about our strength and you know
[3:35:20.200 --> 3:35:25.800]  the new world ever take over so you were telling me during the break though that your life uh has
[3:35:25.800 --> 3:35:31.240]  has has really changed uh can you uh say that in your own words for the audience but but uh really
[3:35:32.040 --> 3:35:37.000]  challenge young people to spread the word about the new world order takeover that we're in the
[3:35:37.000 --> 3:35:42.840]  middle of i mean uh it's beyond a life change like when i said you uh gave me the matrix
[3:35:42.840 --> 3:35:47.720]  pool you know i really feel like i'm out of the matrix and we're driving around in that little
[3:35:47.720 --> 3:35:52.760]  little spaceship in the sewer and you're you're at the helm because i mean what young people need
[3:35:52.760 --> 3:35:59.560]  to realize what i didn't realize is that video games and all these free blogs which is you know
[3:35:59.560 --> 3:36:04.920]  no substance just you know just evil you know our blogs are just making fun of people you know
[3:36:04.920 --> 3:36:09.720]  breaking people down you know getting the right comments you know it's just like the the bathroom
[3:36:09.720 --> 3:36:16.760]  wall you know on the internet and for for me just yesterday i'm 25 years old and it took me
[3:36:16.760 --> 3:36:23.240]  you know yesterday to delete on my bookmarks on my iphone and my computer all these news
[3:36:23.240 --> 3:36:29.240]  websites that feed me you know just popcorn news and all my blogs that you know about hollywood
[3:36:29.240 --> 3:36:35.000]  and the music industry all this stuff that has no meaning in our lives right now when exactly they
[3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:40.600]  want to get you they want to get you drunk on petty issues like that story from yahoo news
[3:36:41.240 --> 3:36:47.640]  that the cover charge at this club an rfid implant and it says take the chips you don't
[3:36:47.640 --> 3:36:52.920]  have to worry about money worry about nothing just party and have a good time it says to take a
[3:36:52.920 --> 3:36:57.880]  burden off of you to free customers are the burdens of having to carry their purses and
[3:36:57.880 --> 3:37:02.840]  wallets but really you're being enslaved to a chip to track and trace everything you do
[3:37:02.840 --> 3:37:09.800]  to bring you into this electronic straightjacket this this electronic prison or plantation or neo
[3:37:09.800 --> 3:37:16.200]  surf uh a feudalist system and it's sold as if it's so good and then the girls and the boys and
[3:37:16.200 --> 3:37:22.280]  the teenagers the young people are all so insecure because they don't look like a hidey or they don't
[3:37:22.280 --> 3:37:27.640]  look like a spencer that then makes them insecure so the establishment can come in and then sell
[3:37:27.640 --> 3:37:34.200]  them the products and then make them never feel like empowered entities or creatures alive one
[3:37:34.200 --> 3:37:40.520]  time on this planet as a test by god to see where they go in the future i think it's very exciting
[3:37:40.520 --> 3:37:46.680]  that you guys is you know these big pop culture icons are now having this metamorphosis to the
[3:37:46.680 --> 3:37:51.400]  new world order is it fair to say you guys have woken up then to the matrix in the new world order
[3:37:51.400 --> 3:37:57.880]  that would be an understatement we've definitely woken up to what's going on and to the new world
[3:37:57.880 --> 3:38:04.360]  order and to a real matrix that there is in the world it's not just in seriousness it's nothing
[3:38:04.360 --> 3:38:10.200]  to do with that that's a word that they've created to make people sound crazy it's like you only sound
[3:38:10.200 --> 3:38:15.240]  crazy if you don't believe what everyone believes if you're not a sheep but that's not what god says
[3:38:15.240 --> 3:38:19.960]  and now that people are trying to play god on this earth it's very scary and i pray for their
[3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:25.880]  souls because there's a lot more than this life and do not mess with god or his people because
[3:38:25.880 --> 3:38:32.040]  there will be punishment for it and this is a very scary thing and chips are disgusting i keep hearing
[3:38:32.040 --> 3:38:38.040]  this and i can't even believe it it's done such a good job at making computers seem cool and you
[3:38:38.040 --> 3:38:45.240]  need the new technology to knew anything at any cost that is such a lie that is so disgusting
[3:38:45.240 --> 3:38:53.320]  it's been we're incriminating ourselves by laziness and it's very sad and i really pray for america
[3:38:53.320 --> 3:38:59.400]  and that everybody wakes up because this trip is the end of humanity well i will tell you what
[3:38:59.400 --> 3:39:04.280]  what happened is old hollywood the really big stars they're all awake to this and i know
[3:39:06.040 --> 3:39:10.600]  a lot of these people and a lot of them have have reached out to me publicly but most of them off
[3:39:10.600 --> 3:39:15.720]  record and they're totally aware of the technological control grid they're totally aware of the vaccines
[3:39:15.720 --> 3:39:20.120]  in the fluoride in the new world order they're totally freaked out just trying to do their
[3:39:20.120 --> 3:39:25.960]  movies to make money so they can you know live outside the country or live in an armored compound
[3:39:25.960 --> 3:39:30.760]  they're not into fame anymore they're totally freaked out but just playing along with the system
[3:39:31.560 --> 3:39:37.880]  then there's kind of the new hollywood super hype that just bypasses movies and films
[3:39:37.880 --> 3:39:44.520]  and just moves right to these kind of pop creations like you guys but to have you kind of at the front
[3:39:44.520 --> 3:39:50.440]  lines of the matrix system taking over people's brains to have you breaking out of the matrix all
[3:39:50.440 --> 3:39:56.440]  because one of your music managers or friends showed you the obama deception and then that led you
[3:39:56.440 --> 3:40:02.600]  down deeper into the rabbit hole is just so incredibly exciting now in the last few months
[3:40:02.600 --> 3:40:07.640]  since you started waking up to this have you seen the media come after you even more because folks
[3:40:07.640 --> 3:40:12.600]  in my office that are aware of what's happening they say it seems the last few months the media's
[3:40:12.600 --> 3:40:18.520]  even been savaging you that much more i feel like they're just getting angrier and angrier but i feel
[3:40:18.520 --> 3:40:24.040]  like the world is just getting angrier and angrier i don't even think it's necessarily that they want
[3:40:24.040 --> 3:40:29.400]  to come harder after us to distract people even more from what's going on in their own lives so
[3:40:29.400 --> 3:40:34.040]  they're not thinking oh wow i'm in debt the government's taking over what are we going to do
[3:40:34.040 --> 3:40:39.240]  they're thinking oh well hidey and spencer are blah blah blah but that is so sad
[3:40:42.120 --> 3:40:48.440]  absolutely i see people cheating each other more i see the public lying i see infighting i see
[3:40:48.440 --> 3:40:54.280]  government getting more corrupt it it it really is like the fall of rome everything is accelerating
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:41:02.360]  towards this collapse and they mean to build on those ashes this world government which
[3:41:02.360 --> 3:41:07.000]  it's planned stated in my film in game blueprint for global enslavement on record
[3:41:07.560 --> 3:41:13.080]  is to kill at least 80 percent of us and i'm sorry folks that's more important than if your
[3:41:13.080 --> 3:41:19.400]  botox is working that's more important than michael jackson is the lion state for all his fans at the
[3:41:19.400 --> 3:41:27.560]  neverland uh pervert ranch it's more important that barack obama is running a pimp game of lying
[3:41:27.560 --> 3:41:33.560]  to everybody about everything he said he would do uh than whether or not anna nicole smith was
[3:41:33.560 --> 3:41:40.120]  murdered what do you guys say to that i mean what really hit me is when you started you know i'm
[3:41:40.120 --> 3:41:46.680]  you know uncovering all the evidence of how you know obama's just all tied into all of these energy
[3:41:46.680 --> 3:41:51.880]  companies and it's just like bush and his whole crew they're all about the oil but america when
[3:41:51.880 --> 3:41:57.080]  they're ready to revolutionize and get you know really make a stand you know just they threw an
[3:41:57.080 --> 3:42:03.400]  obama and now he's oh god oh you're totally right everybody was done with oil but i got this new
[3:42:03.960 --> 3:42:09.880]  hustle over here which is energy but i i'm sure you don't realize that i have a piece of you know
[3:42:09.880 --> 3:42:16.520]  let's push this down to everybody exactly for those that don't know obama owns stock in two of the
[3:42:16.520 --> 3:42:21.240]  mercantile energy trading companies with al gore that's now mainstream news we told people about
[3:42:21.240 --> 3:42:26.520]  it the obama deception but it's now mainstream news we saw the federal filings and al gore is the
[3:42:26.520 --> 3:42:30.760]  majority owner of occidental petroleum one of the biggest oil companies in the world and what it is
[3:42:30.760 --> 3:42:35.640]  is artificial scarcity they're just creating a monopoly where they're going to charge you more
[3:42:35.640 --> 3:42:40.680]  for regular energy and restrict the amount of energy you get well i've been asking questions here for
[3:42:40.680 --> 3:42:45.560]  you know 25 30 minutes you guys get into whatever subjects you want to discuss what about government
[3:42:45.560 --> 3:42:51.080]  sponsored terror what about 9 11 what about governments staging terror attacks is 9 11 an
[3:42:51.080 --> 3:42:56.920]  inside job from your research uh not from my research but from your research is 100 percent is
[3:42:56.920 --> 3:43:05.640]  because all i can't even believe that it took me to see your film to know about baby seven how did
[3:43:05.640 --> 3:43:11.000]  that not hit the mainstream media how did like oh and my favorite clip in your film is when the
[3:43:11.000 --> 3:43:16.120]  owner of the real trade center he goes just i said bring it down i mean i don't know the
[3:43:16.120 --> 3:43:21.080]  statistics but i've watched documentaries on billions blowing up buildings they charge the
[3:43:21.080 --> 3:43:26.200]  buildings up for like two weeks to like a month how do they just do enough bombs to break down
[3:43:26.200 --> 3:43:31.240]  billion seven so beautifully you look like a half hour you know like that that just made me sick
[3:43:32.360 --> 3:43:36.680]  well you just joined the ranks of andres von mulow former german defense minister
[3:43:37.480 --> 3:43:42.840]  high-level members of the japanese government you just joined the ranks of charlie sheen and
[3:43:42.840 --> 3:43:47.880]  willy nelson and governor jesse ventura and countless others on this show that have gone
[3:43:47.880 --> 3:43:54.760]  public for 9 11 truth is just the first time spencer that you've uh in a media venue spoken
[3:43:54.760 --> 3:44:00.760]  about 9 11 you believe uh being an inside job i mean that's how the media is how can i never even
[3:44:00.760 --> 3:44:05.960]  be asked about that until today uh you're the first person who's even asked me about 9 11
[3:44:05.960 --> 3:44:10.840]  but this is something that's so big in in american history we've already forgotten about
[3:44:10.840 --> 3:44:16.520]  our two planes terrorist gun industry let's not investigate close up the fires when i read on
[3:44:16.520 --> 3:44:23.080]  your site info wars dot com that obama already he just he did he just ended up lost it against
[3:44:23.080 --> 3:44:31.080]  his five family for the 9 11 family like i mean i just i want to clear up well i have to tell you
[3:44:31.080 --> 3:44:35.800]  both of you i hadn't talked to you before you came on we you know we saw you guys twittering so we
[3:44:35.800 --> 3:44:40.440]  contacted you my wife was actually up here and she thought it was a good idea to do it and i'm
[3:44:40.440 --> 3:44:44.280]  glad she had the idea because now speaking to you for the last 40 minutes you guys really
[3:44:44.280 --> 3:44:48.520]  know your stuff you've really been listening to the show you've done your research and you've
[3:44:48.520 --> 3:44:57.080]  also got courage uh so uh i just really appreciate uh you guys sharing your voyage your awakening
[3:44:57.080 --> 3:45:01.880]  with us and of course it just gets deeper down the rabbit hole from here uh hidey what's your view
[3:45:01.880 --> 3:45:08.600]  on government sponsored terror at 9 11 i think um i think it's really sad and i think they're doing it
[3:45:08.600 --> 3:45:15.080]  in small ways as well as big ways you know the oklahoma city bombings i saw that whole clip
[3:45:15.080 --> 3:45:19.800]  and how there were two men in there and several men and other bombs going off there were what
[3:45:19.800 --> 3:45:24.360]  four bombs in that building and two went off right away i mean the fact that they can just
[3:45:24.360 --> 3:45:30.120]  cover things up and the fact that they are so smug about it they don't even really care about
[3:45:30.120 --> 3:45:35.800]  anyone else in this and the other night in uh downtown la they're doing those drills that are
[3:45:35.800 --> 3:45:42.840]  in your video the blackhawks taking over downtown la 10 nights in a row what do they need to do
[3:45:42.840 --> 3:45:49.800]  downtown in la for scaring the people actually terrorizing la getting ready for whatever they're
[3:45:49.800 --> 3:45:55.640]  getting ready for it's just really sad and sick and people are like oh it must be for a movie it's
[3:45:55.640 --> 3:46:01.320]  not for a movie this is the government you're not in a hollywood set it's done such a good job of
[3:46:01.320 --> 3:46:06.360]  making everyone live through movies and video games that you don't really feel like this is life
[3:46:06.360 --> 3:46:11.560]  but people this is life and you have won and it's given to you by god and that's the only person
[3:46:11.560 --> 3:46:16.440]  who should tell you what you should do it says in the bible that we should be free men and only
[3:46:16.440 --> 3:46:22.840]  answer to god i'm only scared of god you can do certain things to my body anything but jesus is
[3:46:22.840 --> 3:46:29.400]  the only one that i would bow down to and be scared of no king but king jesus amen that was the
[3:46:29.400 --> 3:46:34.120]  revolutionary war cry that don't teach in schools incredible you're absolutely right we're being
[3:46:34.120 --> 3:46:40.040]  sucked into a matrix i'll sit there at a restaurant with my children and my wife and my kids we don't
[3:46:40.040 --> 3:46:44.120]  watch a lot of tv at home very little and they'll just like zombies be watching and all the other
[3:46:44.120 --> 3:46:49.640]  kids are like zombies watching the tv even if it's the you know soccer game or kanducky derby or
[3:46:49.640 --> 3:46:55.400]  or you know fox news they're watching it and other kids are sitting there playing video games while
[3:46:55.400 --> 3:47:00.520]  they're at the table you know kids at other tables with their parents not even communicating with
[3:47:00.520 --> 3:47:06.840]  their family i mean people are literally being programmed by this and and having pop sensations
[3:47:06.840 --> 3:47:12.920]  like yourselves come out and expose this is going to be a big blow against the establishment but
[3:47:12.920 --> 3:47:18.920]  all i could say is guys get ready to be attacked because i think you're going to have even more
[3:47:18.920 --> 3:47:23.320]  attacks from the mainstream media but i think no weapon formed against you will prosper i think
[3:47:23.320 --> 3:47:28.600]  that's gonna backfire and only give you more attention amen and i agree and we are in jesus's
[3:47:28.600 --> 3:47:33.720]  hands and you can persecute us you can say whatever you want that's fine because we are not conformed
[3:47:33.720 --> 3:47:39.640]  to this world we are living for eternal life and i pray for all these souls and that's the only thing
[3:47:39.640 --> 3:47:45.960]  that matters well this is this has been an incredible interview we got about 12 minutes or so left
[3:47:45.960 --> 3:47:51.000]  with a break in the middle uh other points about the new world order what else have you been noticing
[3:47:51.000 --> 3:47:56.280]  because once you come out of the matrix and this is happening to me in phases as well when i first
[3:47:56.280 --> 3:48:01.240]  got on air 13 years ago it was more of a mainline kind of ron paul libertarian and then i kept
[3:48:01.240 --> 3:48:07.320]  discovering stuff was real and a newspaper reporter said come to behemian grove try to sneak in uh and
[3:48:07.320 --> 3:48:12.280]  i snuck in and got the footage and there were world leaders doing a mock human sacrifice and vanity
[3:48:12.280 --> 3:48:18.680]  fair snuck in and got arrested but not before they saw homosexual orgies with so-called christian
[3:48:18.680 --> 3:48:27.080]  republican leaders and you know my whole issue is is that truth is so much crazier than the fiction
[3:48:27.080 --> 3:48:31.880]  they put on the news and tv that's all a distraction to keep from seeing the real world uh
[3:48:32.520 --> 3:48:39.160]  heidi spencer your comments on bohemian grove and this whole luciferian system i mean honestly i can't
[3:48:39.160 --> 3:48:44.360]  even imagine listeners who haven't seen your beauty on the bohemian grove it just sounds like so far
[3:48:44.360 --> 3:48:49.720]  fetched and conspiracy theory so anybody who's listening that thinks that sounds crazy you need
[3:48:49.720 --> 3:48:55.560]  to watch it for yourself when you see all these powerful world leaders you know business people
[3:48:55.560 --> 3:49:02.600]  politicians bearing roads you know screaming the fire as they're that the ash that the fake human
[3:49:02.600 --> 3:49:07.720]  is getting burned and they're all screaming and they're wearing clothes it's like these are not the
[3:49:07.720 --> 3:49:12.840]  people i want running my country this is anybody dressed in a cloak and around the fire is not
[3:49:12.840 --> 3:49:20.200]  supposed to be running america in fact i just thought to try to pull up on youtube the clip of
[3:49:20.200 --> 3:49:26.760]  the high priest and when they practiced the mock burning of the child how that horrible scream
[3:49:27.720 --> 3:49:33.240]  and and and then the the media said well alex you snuck in it was just a play but i was there
[3:49:33.240 --> 3:49:39.400]  with the old men in the audience they were getting off on it and in a type of religious rapture other
[3:49:39.400 --> 3:49:45.560]  hollywood folks you talked to about this stuff uh are they saying yeah i knew this was going on all
[3:49:45.560 --> 3:49:50.280]  along but just didn't know the full picture or i knew something was wrong in my gut or are they
[3:49:50.280 --> 3:49:55.720]  saying hey you're just a cook well we're kind of our own entity we're we're like bonnie and
[3:49:55.720 --> 3:50:01.320]  Clyde over here so we have just been telling the people who matter the most in our lives which are
[3:50:01.320 --> 3:50:06.680]  our family and friends and our twitter fans and trying to really get the whole world aware but
[3:50:06.680 --> 3:50:11.240]  i saw that clip that i was praying to jesus that that was not a real child that they were
[3:50:11.240 --> 3:50:17.240]  mock burning because i heard that scream and that was a gut wrenching that that's a crazy
[3:50:17.240 --> 3:50:23.160]  crazy sacrifice and this country was founded on the bible our forefathers this is a christian
[3:50:23.160 --> 3:50:28.040]  country and people have seemed to forgot that by now that there's all these religions and which
[3:50:28.040 --> 3:50:33.880]  one and any religions okay no in the bible it says you can only get to the father through the son
[3:50:33.880 --> 3:50:38.040]  and that is what our country knew and that's what our forefathers our founding fathers
[3:50:38.040 --> 3:50:45.080]  in the constitution and i do not want some leucarian illuminati devil worshiping people

[3:55:26.600 --> 3:55:32.120]  uh i think you're gonna get a lot of feedback from this show today and so that's why i want to
[3:55:32.120 --> 3:55:36.440]  have you back in the next few days and talk about the feedback you get from people in the media
[3:55:36.440 --> 3:55:41.160]  your friends your colleagues but also your fans tell us the listeners out there about your websites
[3:55:41.160 --> 3:55:49.320]  and twitter accounts uh well my twitter is uh at spencer pratt and my wife is at hidey montag
[3:55:49.320 --> 3:55:54.600]  but the only thing anybody should be paying attention to is at info wars because we're
[3:55:54.600 --> 3:56:00.440]  running out of time i i feel i'm so sorry to america that i have distracted you for the last
[3:56:00.440 --> 3:56:06.520]  two and a half years with all of mine and my wife antics that you know we're all about our selfishness
[3:56:06.520 --> 3:56:11.560]  and about our own fame and you know our own success when we should have been way more concerned
[3:56:11.560 --> 3:56:17.160]  about the success of america and what it stands for and you know the issues that are so much
[3:56:17.160 --> 3:56:21.320]  more important than any of the things i've ever talked about in the media what they do is they
[3:56:21.320 --> 3:56:27.000]  use your obsession with who you are and how you look to put that same obsession on other people
[3:56:27.000 --> 3:56:30.840]  so that we're also obsessed with how we look and what we're saying and so insecure
[3:56:30.840 --> 3:56:36.440]  that we can't ever see the wider world around us hidey comments on that i definitely agree with that
[3:56:36.440 --> 3:56:43.480]  and you know with uh this whole media and with all the girls and how you're supposed to look and
[3:56:43.480 --> 3:56:47.960]  you know the truth is these people in the media wouldn't even act like that if it wasn't their
[3:56:47.960 --> 3:56:53.720]  job and you know it's our job now to really inform people and to step back from that and
[3:56:53.720 --> 3:56:59.000]  to educate people and you know there are kids who listen and these kids need to secure their
[3:56:59.000 --> 3:57:03.880]  own future because no one's going to do it for you and these people are just snakes coming out and
[3:57:03.880 --> 3:57:10.120]  it's it's very sad and it's very painful to watch and you know i'm just really really praying for
[3:57:10.120 --> 3:57:16.120]  america and i'm really praying for this world because it's a very sad, vapid, shallow world
[3:57:16.120 --> 3:57:21.080]  that they put everyone into the only thing they care about i mean it is it's very very shallow
[3:57:21.080 --> 3:57:27.240]  in the meanwhile we're in the ice cold you know thousand league deep new world order ocean focused
[3:57:27.240 --> 3:57:35.880]  on this mile wide inch deep mainstream media uh in closing tell folks about your current tv show
[3:57:35.880 --> 3:57:39.960]  are we going to see any of these messages on the show are they going to edit that out no they would
[3:57:39.960 --> 3:57:47.000]  definitely edit that out because it's only about the drama in our lives and with other characters
[3:57:47.000 --> 3:57:52.280]  and storyline and but we will definitely try to get this message out wherever we can whenever we
[3:57:52.280 --> 3:57:58.280]  can and as often as we can and where our assaults and prayers are with you too and we thank you for
