[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:43.760]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones okay my friends
[00:43.760 --> 00:52.520]  we are live thank you so much for joining us it's the big SOPA internet protest day and there's
[00:52.520 --> 00:59.240]  other draconian bills meant to hack up control of the internet also in the Congress and we're
[00:59.240 --> 01:05.760]  gonna be going over some of those here in the broadcast today and I would ask callers when
[01:05.760 --> 01:11.600]  we open the phones up to give us your view on the future of the internet and free speech as a whole
[01:11.600 --> 01:16.680]  because the rest of the Bill of Rights and Constitution is under assault and free speech is
[01:16.680 --> 01:22.200]  under attack in Europe as well in fact guys I forgot to tell you this print me a BBC article
[01:22.200 --> 01:33.440]  about Romania Romanian government says new EU rules go back to Soviet Union listen to BBC
[01:33.440 --> 01:39.800]  last night BBC radio and they were and it was members of the Romanian Parliament and others
[01:39.800 --> 01:44.840]  there's other governments saying we can't be part of this new euro expansion it gets rid of our
[01:44.840 --> 01:52.040]  sovereignty to a central power it restricts free speech and they were going over how the euro is a
[01:52.040 --> 01:57.880]  tyranny well that's what Gorbachev is called the euro but in a good way he's called it the you know
[01:57.880 --> 02:05.200]  the European Soviet England has upwards of 80 well 80 plus percent of its laws actually made by
[02:05.200 --> 02:12.880]  the unelected bureaucracy so this is the type of news that we have we're gonna be breaking down also
[02:12.880 --> 02:19.960]  CBS News is reporting like it's the best thing since sliced bread New York moves to deploy body
[02:19.960 --> 02:26.600]  scanners on street and search for guns these are body scanners on street poles that blast through
[02:26.600 --> 02:33.760]  your clothing and they've got clips of the video up on CBS News we have our own article written by
[02:33.760 --> 02:38.080]  Kurt Nemo giving you some background on it of course there's no mention in their article about
[02:38.080 --> 02:45.080]  radiation danger but it shows the man's gluteus maximus shows his butt you can watch other videos
[02:45.080 --> 02:50.240]  of the system they're installing and they're quote testing right now and you can see the frontal
[02:50.240 --> 02:57.440]  genitals just all part of government and the military industrial complex turning the entire
[02:57.440 --> 03:04.880]  United States and Western world into a giant high-tech nightmare prison and charting through DARPA
[03:04.880 --> 03:09.920]  the development of that system they act like the internet's just growing on its own and all these
[03:09.920 --> 03:15.840]  developments are just happening and oh it's the future and kids in the future will only learn
[03:15.840 --> 03:21.960]  off video games and everyone's gonna be hooked in all the time no they're they're engineering the
[03:21.960 --> 03:29.560]  internet to be a matrix insertion system to where you can't do business or even live if you're not
[03:29.560 --> 03:36.200]  basically just infold it in the new Microsoft browser systems are mouse-free and it follows your
[03:36.200 --> 03:42.480]  eye for more than a decade most shopping centers and stores actually have cameras scanning your
[03:42.480 --> 03:48.440]  eye and following it for market data of what you look on what you linger on it's being put into
[03:48.440 --> 03:53.640]  databases to control you I hear talk show hosts just the last few weeks announcing look they're
[03:53.640 --> 03:57.480]  flying over our houses with infrared looking through them it's incredible they've been doing
[03:57.480 --> 04:03.840]  that for 25 years two years ago TSA announced what we already knew was going on from our sources
[04:03.840 --> 04:10.240]  driving around with vans blasting your home with high-powered radiation looking right through
[04:10.240 --> 04:20.240]  your walls this is the type of craziness that is going on so again I want to open the phones
[04:20.240 --> 04:23.920]  up and break down what do you see happening in 2012 what do you think of the whole new
[04:23.920 --> 04:30.600]  world order operation and what do you think of people really waking up a reddit Wikipedia others
[04:30.600 --> 04:35.880]  is shutting down today to point out the attack on the internet we are just linking on info wars
[04:35.880 --> 04:41.960]  and prison planet to to congress and ways to lobby for free speech and a free internet to see
[04:41.960 --> 04:46.480]  they make you dependent on the web then they start taking control of it like having the public
[04:46.480 --> 04:51.760]  build roads and then handing them over to private companies it's a it's a theft going on and I
[04:51.760 --> 05:02.040]  would explain internet to and the Trojan horse of control coming up stay with us hi folks this

[08:24.360 --> 08:29.840]  all right my friends we're going to be covering a lot of different incredibly important issues
[08:29.840 --> 08:37.440]  obviously here today a host of issues the world is really waking up to the fact that
[08:37.440 --> 08:45.040]  governments and select corporations have openly in the last decade announced a cocktail of
[08:45.040 --> 08:50.560]  different strategies to basically take over the free internet as we know it and turn it
[08:50.560 --> 08:59.680]  into a glorified cable box that has your four or five thousand choices on it that are owned by a
[08:59.680 --> 09:06.560]  handful of companies and they want to use regulation taxation no due process copyright claims
[09:07.280 --> 09:16.160]  internet blacklisting search engine blacklisting and a lot of other systems and filters to basically
[09:16.160 --> 09:25.440]  uh start phasing out the free internet that we've known and the system before a decade ago was arrogant
[09:25.440 --> 09:31.520]  and said the general average person will never compete with quote professional corporate dinosaur
[09:31.520 --> 09:38.960]  whore media but in the last decade their arrogance began to dissipate a bit and they said wow
[09:40.240 --> 09:45.280]  we're losing market share to the quote alternative media and now about two years ago
[09:45.280 --> 09:50.640]  the different actuaries were put out by different market research firms that now more people get
[09:50.640 --> 09:58.480]  their news from quote alternative media and trusted a lot more than abc cbs nbc fox msnbc
[09:58.480 --> 10:03.920]  and the rest of them and what was left of their credibility has pretty much completely dissipated
[10:04.960 --> 10:10.320]  channels like msnbc their top shows maybe half million viewers i mean it is a complete joke
[10:10.320 --> 10:16.960]  uh fox routinely had five million viewers six seven eight years ago now their top shows might
[10:16.960 --> 10:25.840]  have two and a half three million it's all shrinking and transferring into the internet
[10:26.480 --> 10:34.000]  transferring into people doing news out of their basement transferring to kind of a hybrid of
[10:34.000 --> 10:40.640]  shoestring media uh you know growing over time into something quote more organized and uh
[10:41.920 --> 10:47.680]  polished like what we do here with the daily three hour radio tv show the nightly news the
[10:47.680 --> 10:53.120]  documentary films the news websites the special news reports and the rest of it uh we are leading
[10:53.120 --> 10:59.360]  the charge in what is seen as the new media as rollingstone magazine newark daily news and many
[10:59.360 --> 11:06.560]  other even establishment dinosaur publications uh have pointed out we reach 15 million people
[11:06.560 --> 11:12.160]  conservatively a week one way or another and it's growing exponentially how can the system compete
[11:12.160 --> 11:18.640]  with that i mean to reach 15 million people a week something like the new york times has to spend
[11:19.360 --> 11:25.440]  what is it 300 plus million dollars a year but that's not going on here
[11:25.440 --> 11:34.640]  we're doing this for a few million dollars a year so that's why the system has an incentive
[11:35.200 --> 11:41.840]  to try to come in and to try to start curtailing and and and and censoring the web but they've
[11:41.840 --> 11:49.120]  got other plans if you go back 10 or 11 years and read the minutes of what's called internet to
[11:49.120 --> 11:55.840]  consortium meetings that they've had in austin texas yearly london tokyo chicago toronto
[11:57.360 --> 12:01.440]  if you go read these meetings a lot of times the name of the conference will be
[12:02.080 --> 12:07.440]  the internet is dead long live the death of the internet and they announce internet two will be
[12:07.440 --> 12:16.160]  these government corporate super uh you know high res high bandwidth systems and to enter into our
[12:16.160 --> 12:23.280]  system you will have to sign on as a subcarrier so it'll be you know basically google forward slash
[12:23.280 --> 12:28.560]  in your website and then you'll waive all your rights but then you'll be trusted content and
[12:28.560 --> 12:35.680]  then the system itself is going to launch hack attacks and denial of service systems and spamming
[12:35.680 --> 12:41.840]  things and viruses to basically shut down what is the old internet so there'll be this this
[12:41.840 --> 12:49.200]  basement wild wild west system that's crumbling and falling apart and then you'll have the big gleaming
[12:49.840 --> 12:55.360]  you know modern shopping mall version where you have to go through the digital tsa
[12:56.320 --> 13:02.160]  groper's the virtual groper's and you'll be retina scanned and face scanned to even be able to get
[13:02.160 --> 13:08.960]  on the internet that's all being announced there'll be taxes regulations all these special
[13:08.960 --> 13:16.240]  certifications and the government can delist you from the web delist your website uh there are now
[13:17.200 --> 13:23.840]  cases where where we're microsoft on record uh and yahoo and others to a great extent google not as
[13:23.840 --> 13:30.960]  much uh they didn't really play ball helped build the great wall of the great berlin wall the great
[13:30.960 --> 13:37.520]  electronic uh wall of china to uh to where their internet basically doesn't work very well and you
[13:37.520 --> 13:45.760]  can't visit most websites period uh just because they've screwed it up and so it is microsoft
[13:47.120 --> 13:54.160]  along with cisco and others that are supporting sopa uh they're teamed up with hollywood and the
[13:54.160 --> 14:02.400]  recording industry and then you've got uh google against sopa uh and you've got uh thousands of
[14:02.400 --> 14:06.480]  other big technology sites that are against it as well obviously the drudge reports against it
[14:06.480 --> 14:12.080]  we're against it uh but you also have the international property uh right uh act you've
[14:12.080 --> 14:20.400]  got international treaties sopa is only one torpedo fired directly at our free speech
[14:22.080 --> 14:27.760]  and it is the the details of the bill that proves that you're always told it's one thing
[14:27.760 --> 14:32.480]  like you're told oh this is so we can spy on al qaeda we're gonna have the nsa spy on all of you
[14:32.480 --> 14:36.640]  and it turns out as for the general public or this whole war on terrorist for al qaeda then you get
[14:36.640 --> 14:40.960]  the internal documents none of it's even about al qaeda it's all about people that are for property
[14:40.960 --> 14:48.240]  rights second amendment who are libertarian uh who want to have the republic uh reinstated real
[14:48.240 --> 14:56.000]  americans we're told oh this is for al qaeda but then you learn it's for us citizens and the whole
[14:56.000 --> 15:03.840]  thing uh affects uh us citizens uh the whole uh program is so you can be disappeared and
[15:03.840 --> 15:10.160]  flown secretly with a black bag over your head uh to some uh european uh country where you're
[15:10.160 --> 15:17.760]  basically interrogated tortured killed and then they just had people like mit romney and barack
[15:17.760 --> 15:22.000]  obama get up there and defend it and what did mit romney say two nights ago in the debate
[15:22.000 --> 15:27.440]  he said you can trust me with this power no the founder said don't trust the president with
[15:27.440 --> 15:32.880]  dictator power don't let him have that power and if they try to have that power it's treason
[15:33.760 --> 15:40.160]  i mean we've got a clip up on info wars dot com about sopa uh with uh Lieberman senator Lieberman
[15:40.160 --> 15:46.560]  same guy pushing and helping right the uh india a saying look we need to be able to shut down parts
[15:46.560 --> 15:52.160]  of the internet or all of it to protect america we need what the chinese have i mean that is a that
[15:52.160 --> 16:00.080]  is a open in your face quote that we're talking about in fact we'll uh put that article uh up on
[16:00.080 --> 16:10.640]  screen uh for folks that are uh watching us right now uh at prisonplanet.tv sopa protest
[16:10.640 --> 16:17.360]  shut down websites the washington post is reporting it uh new york times protest on web uses
[16:17.360 --> 16:23.840]  shut down to take on two uh piracy bills which are not piracy bills they're due process takeover
[16:23.840 --> 16:31.520]  systems sopa in the p i p a damage uh the free speech today we fight back that's what reddit
[16:31.520 --> 16:36.960]  is saying as they basically go dark and just point out what's happening uh here's the big article
[16:36.960 --> 16:40.880]  um that you want to get out to everybody and again we'll uh put this up for folks
[16:40.880 --> 16:49.360]  from info wars dot com we'll actually show people the article of this um the secret behind sopa
[16:50.720 --> 16:57.280]  it's the end of the internet as we know it uh and it goes on the secret behind behind sopa
[16:57.280 --> 17:03.600]  the so-called anti piracy bill this is an info wars dot com article up at info wars dot com
[17:03.600 --> 17:08.160]  and prismplanet.com if you want to find this and get it out to people
[17:12.640 --> 17:18.080]  if you want to get this out to people uh you can basically go to the site get it and email it out
[17:18.080 --> 17:24.240]  to folks so they understand what's really happening the secret behind sopa is the so called anti
[17:24.240 --> 17:29.840]  piracy bill which is today the target of an unprecedented backlash with wiki leaks and other
[17:29.840 --> 17:36.320]  major websites going dark to protest the legislation has nothing to do with piracy or copyright theft
[17:36.320 --> 17:42.960]  it's all about the formal effort to mimic communist china's system of internet censorship
[17:45.280 --> 17:49.120]  but don't take our word for it listen to what joe Lieberman and you can watch the clip right
[17:49.120 --> 17:57.120]  there co-sponsor of the p i p a and sopa sister version in the senate said about the purpose
[17:57.120 --> 18:03.440]  of the uh behind the u.s government's efforts to control the internet under the guise of cyberspace
[18:04.080 --> 18:09.360]  Lieberman characterized fears that the u.s government would use such powers to censor
[18:09.360 --> 18:15.600]  political content as total misinformation that's how they always say total misinformation but then
[18:15.600 --> 18:21.360]  admit it yet goes on to admit that the purpose behind the agenda to mimic china's ability to
[18:21.360 --> 18:28.400]  disconnect parts of the internet in case of war adding we need to do that here too that's the quote
[18:28.400 --> 18:34.320]  of course communist china's war is not against foreign terrorist or hackers it's targeted against
[18:34.320 --> 18:40.400]  people who dare to use the internet to express dissonant voices against government atrocities
[18:40.400 --> 18:46.400]  or corruption china's system of internet policing is about crushing freedom of speech and has nothing
[18:46.400 --> 18:52.880]  to do with legitimate security concerns as Lieberman well knows and again the big it companies created
[18:52.880 --> 18:58.880]  by DARPA created by the cia funded given the big contracts here in the united states in europe
[18:58.880 --> 19:06.080]  are the very groups that help build the great electronic berlin wall of china this is on record
[19:06.080 --> 19:10.560]  and i told you for years this is how they would come out for the web in the name of copyright
[19:10.560 --> 19:17.600]  and they're now doing it when they've got all the other laws that amply deal with that and more
[19:19.120 --> 19:25.680]  the uh you know different takedown notices uh the digital millennium copyright act all of it
[19:25.680 --> 19:33.360]  continuing heavily uh largely failed in its bid to use fears over cyber warfare bearing in mind
[19:33.360 --> 19:37.120]  it was the united states in israel who launched the stuxnet attack to achieve the ultimate goal
[19:37.120 --> 19:42.720]  of internet control Lieberman has returned with the same agenda only under different guys the protect
[19:42.720 --> 19:48.560]  intellectual property act of which he is a co-sponsor i'm going to give you the latest on this then big
[19:48.560 --> 19:55.280]  news with iran iran threatens to torpedo u.s aircraft carriers three u.s warship stationed in
[19:55.280 --> 20:00.240]  waters near straight of hormuz ron paul is filed suit against someone will tell you about that
[20:00.240 --> 20:07.440]  folks have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on
[20:07.440 --> 20:11.680]  if so this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear because there's never
[20:11.680 --> 20:17.040]  been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead here's why solar power
[20:17.040 --> 20:22.400]  generators are now available from our friends at solutions from science one of our oldest sponsors
[20:22.400 --> 20:27.680]  their emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most unlike

[24:08.800 --> 24:16.560]  let me do this i want to get back into how the system intends to try to maintain control over
[24:16.560 --> 24:23.120]  information and how the so-called establishment mainstream media is teamed up with government
[24:23.120 --> 24:29.200]  and has an incentive to go along with this to shut down their competition the arrogant system
[24:29.200 --> 24:40.560]  thought that it could sell the public and the world on a curtailed censored gatekeeper internet
[24:40.560 --> 24:48.000]  under the guise of cyber security and copyright but the world is not buying it the people are not
[24:48.000 --> 24:56.000]  buying it and this is just another example of how every time humanity stands up we are having
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.560]  success we're having victory in fact i have a special report that i shot yesterday with erin
[25:02.560 --> 25:07.520]  dykes that we're going to have ready tomorrow that basically breaks down the fact that humanity
[25:07.520 --> 25:16.080]  is rising humanity is waking up and that 2012 is a year when the tyrants are coming out into the
[25:16.080 --> 25:27.360]  open out of a desperate need to try to dominate humanity back into submission but the fact that
[25:27.360 --> 25:38.320]  on monday the congress people supporting the the the sopa bill and and other accompanying legislation
[25:38.320 --> 25:44.080]  came out and said okay we're going to shelve it for now now that was a possum move and i said that
[25:44.080 --> 25:51.200]  on monday now they're back saying they're going to try to vote on it on the 24th next week but it's
[25:51.200 --> 25:58.080]  still a victory that they're having to go from openly promoting it and saying yeah it's for
[25:58.080 --> 26:02.640]  your own good just saying okay we're not going to sign it right now we're not going to pass it
[26:02.640 --> 26:07.520]  right now remember when they were having trouble with the ndaa and secret arrest of citizens
[26:07.520 --> 26:12.560]  obama came out and said i'll veto that people like oh well problem solved let let them pass it
[26:12.560 --> 26:18.640]  and i was like he's going to sign it he's going to sign it so you do need to contact the criminals
[26:18.640 --> 26:26.800]  in congress and let them know that you're aware of the fact that that that you're aware of their
[26:26.800 --> 26:30.320]  crimes and that they want to start shutting down free speech because they're desperate
[26:31.120 --> 26:35.360]  but let them know that the genie is out of the bottle that that you're aware of what they've
[26:35.360 --> 26:41.840]  done but more importantly than any of this lobbying the congress critters and the and the and the
[26:41.840 --> 26:50.320]  district of criminals up there in dc is to appreciate alternative independent press
[26:50.320 --> 26:55.920]  whether it's talk radio internet whether it's that radio show you listen to locally or whether
[26:55.920 --> 27:03.920]  it's a national show or whether it is a website you visit or whether it's an author as free speech
[27:03.920 --> 27:10.960]  comes under attack we either all stand together or we hang separate and this is an issue just like
[27:10.960 --> 27:18.320]  the tsa groping and humiliating people that transcends party lines ideological affiliation
[27:18.320 --> 27:27.520]  religion and it's something that really unifies people on basic issues of freedom and it is that
[27:28.720 --> 27:35.920]  brotherhood that sisterhood that that that common humanity of us coming together that scares
[27:35.920 --> 27:42.720]  the globalist more than anything so learn to flex our muscles learn the power we have by voting
[27:42.720 --> 27:48.080]  with our dollars and with boycotts and with blackouts and with demonstrations but more
[27:48.080 --> 27:56.400]  importantly than all of that exercise your free speech or what does the old cliche say use your
[27:56.400 --> 28:06.480]  free speech or lose it use your muscles or lose it use your brain or lose it all the study show
[28:06.480 --> 28:12.720]  chemicals included but Alzheimer's is accelerated by being lackadaisical by watching a lot of tv
[28:12.720 --> 28:19.360]  by being passive by not challenging yourself by not doing word puzzles number puzzles by not doing
[28:19.360 --> 28:28.160]  new things the system while i support internet freedom and while i want to keep it open and
[28:28.160 --> 28:34.560]  free to us to the extent it is now because it's not totally free as you know understand though
[28:34.560 --> 28:39.680]  the globalist social engineers did design it and it has backfired on them in some ways they're not
[28:39.680 --> 28:44.560]  god they're not in total control but listen to me carefully in the pentagon zone words in the
[28:44.560 --> 28:48.720]  reports we've broken down we're gonna do more reports on this in the future they admit it's
[28:48.720 --> 28:53.520]  going to be a surveillance system worldwide wiretaps what they called it that's the www the
[28:53.520 --> 28:59.200]  joke it's not worldwide web it's worldwide wiretap and it's a web that captures you when DARPA
[28:59.200 --> 29:05.040]  invented this and the cia deployed this in the 60s they always planned on using it not as a
[29:05.040 --> 29:12.960]  emergency communication system that they told you about that was the public rollout but as a system
[29:12.960 --> 29:21.920]  to have nsa capability not just on faxes phone calls and radio transmissions and u hf v hf
[29:21.920 --> 29:28.400]  but to have everything we do in commerce be digital if you want a cashless society you've
[29:28.400 --> 29:36.560]  got to have a really flashy roach trap that tricks people into going into it that everything gets
[29:36.560 --> 29:43.520]  on to show then you can take control through that of the entire grid all right i'm gonna give the

[33:33.120 --> 33:41.680]  look here's the bottom line i want to try to make this as just simple as i can there is a scientific
[33:41.680 --> 33:48.880]  dictatorship of eugenicists who believe they're better than everybody and who have a disdain
[33:48.880 --> 33:58.560]  for humanity and we live in a organized planned society to a great extent the new world order
[33:58.560 --> 34:09.360]  is the attempt worldwide to force compliance within the confines of that structure and then by
[34:09.360 --> 34:17.680]  increment to beta test and sell the public ongoing deeper into it and what's happening is as i pointed
[34:17.680 --> 34:23.360]  out on the nightly news last night we're going into a praetorian class type system just like with
[34:23.360 --> 34:30.560]  the romans where the gentry class it was known did whatever they wanted and told the low level
[34:30.560 --> 34:36.560]  minions what was going to be done and everything was about submitting to that authority and that's
[34:36.560 --> 34:41.680]  what police checkpoints are about that's what government hin pecking everyone is about that's
[34:41.680 --> 34:47.360]  what all the regulations are about that's what the police bug in their eyes out at you and the tsa
[34:47.360 --> 34:54.160]  groping you and your wife and your children it is about hey we're in your comfort zone we're coming
[34:54.160 --> 34:59.040]  to your door and saying we're here to give your child shots even though there's not a law because
[34:59.040 --> 35:04.400]  we feel like it and we got guns hey we're going to raise your property taxes to where you can't pay

[35:24.800 --> 35:30.560]  going to move their x-ray division to china i mean every day i see articles where republicans and
[35:30.560 --> 35:37.680]  democrats vote to fund moving our jobs overseas while telling us all day they want to give us jobs
[35:38.720 --> 35:44.560]  the united states you judge a tree by its fruits has gone from the number one most educated
[35:44.560 --> 35:54.560]  the number one longest lived number one in patents number one at the olympics number one in every
[35:55.280 --> 36:04.640]  category 60 years ago number one admired the most freedoms the most private property
[36:05.840 --> 36:14.480]  the the wildest culture the best literature everything america was the gold standard now
[36:14.480 --> 36:22.720]  under new world order control 60 years later roughly we are number one in obesity number one
[36:22.720 --> 36:30.960]  in cancer number one in diabetes number one in heart disease number one in birth defects look
[36:30.960 --> 36:42.080]  this up number one in autism number one number one we are below because i see the numbers of
[36:42.080 --> 36:45.440]  60th worldwide but they're not counting some other third world countries that are above us
[36:45.440 --> 36:52.560]  but we are at least number 60 in longevity and health in the united states from number one to
[36:52.560 --> 37:05.200]  number 60 we are a petri dish we are being tested on we are being manipulated i mean every day
[37:06.240 --> 37:10.880]  i see government reports coming out admitting the number one cause of polio worldwide i've got one
[37:10.880 --> 37:16.240]  here today is the vaccine in the government in un's own report world health organization
[37:17.920 --> 37:24.320]  i know for a fact the vaccine makers aren't just screwing up with all these vaccines adding
[37:24.320 --> 37:31.040]  other viruses and other rna and dna and micro plasms they're doing it on purpose and i've got all
[37:31.040 --> 37:36.480]  the documents i showed them again on the nightly news last night i mean i know this crime is being
[37:36.480 --> 37:47.600]  committed but your average doctor down the street your average doctor is just compartmentalized
[37:47.600 --> 37:51.920]  and believes whatever the american medical association and the american pediatric association
[37:51.920 --> 37:56.320]  tells them and the american psychiatry association tells them and they just do whatever they're
[37:56.320 --> 38:02.240]  told and as their patients have convulsions or as nurses get paralyzed at the hospital
[38:02.240 --> 38:09.520]  or as their own child gets damaged most of them cannot admit to themselves that this is conscious
[38:09.520 --> 38:17.600]  and no last night i had a guest on an investigative reporter and and and he pointed out that abc news
[38:17.600 --> 38:23.200]  reported on this in 2001 congress released it in 2000 we covered it then and even had
[38:23.200 --> 38:28.560]  care congressman dan burton on at the time he found out his grandson was was brain damaged
[38:28.560 --> 38:34.560]  uh you know two years old talking healthy bouncing on his knee giggling learning his abc's took
[38:34.560 --> 38:41.200]  third round of shots had a convulsion and couldn't talk anymore he subpoenaed the records from the
[38:41.200 --> 38:50.400]  cdc he found them having meetings years before one meeting at at a methodus retreat that they
[38:50.400 --> 38:54.880]  rented out and they were in there going yeah it's up several thousand percentage points massive
[38:54.880 --> 39:00.480]  brain damaging autoimmune responses we've got to cover this up or the entire government will fall
[39:00.480 --> 39:05.600]  and we'll lose all credibility and then in the minutes they say but i do suggest you tell all
[39:05.600 --> 39:10.880]  your families do not take the shots i've had state attorneys on i had the state attorney on from
[39:10.880 --> 39:14.960]  maryland five years ago when they you know ordered quote two thousand to go to the courthouse to be
[39:14.960 --> 39:20.800]  inoculated in public school they quote be arrested and i got him on i said it's a hoax there's no law
[39:20.800 --> 39:27.040]  you got to take that shot and he goes you ought to be a lawyer on the radio he goes he he goes
[39:27.040 --> 39:34.320]  you're right i don't vaccinate my kids like because you're smart you should be one of them because i
[39:34.320 --> 39:41.440]  know a con job then then that makes me special and then i go hey look at all these idiots i'll
[39:41.440 --> 39:46.480]  just lie to them because my bosses at the state told me to tell people you'll be arrested if you
[39:46.480 --> 39:55.120]  don't take the shot and they're on cnn they showed dogs and police and riot gear and two thousand
[39:55.120 --> 40:01.360]  youth with their parents was like three thousand plus people total and crying people saying saying
[40:01.360 --> 40:06.080]  my other baby got sick they're mainly black my my my baby got sick from a shot i don't want to
[40:06.080 --> 40:11.040]  do it but i don't want them to arrest my other babies and i was just desperately on the air
[40:11.040 --> 40:15.440]  just wishing i had more affiliates wishing i could reach more people just to tell folks hey
[40:15.440 --> 40:22.800]  they're lying to you and then you get the guy on who's on the news and you say uh you're threatening
[40:22.800 --> 40:28.640]  to arrest them for truancy aren't you which they're truant when you kick them out for not taking
[40:28.640 --> 40:33.920]  the shot when you have no authority to kick them out for being truant and he goes you ought to be
[40:33.920 --> 40:41.120]  a lawyer you're right and i don't vaccinate my kids i'm just doing what the state tells me to do
[40:41.120 --> 40:45.840]  oh so the state tells you go out a lot of people you know go out there and bamboozle them go out
[40:45.840 --> 40:51.280]  there and and and and manipulate them through color of law and again i i know i've got all
[40:51.280 --> 40:55.600]  this soap and news and all this other world news but just veer back to the vaccines because
[40:57.200 --> 41:01.040]  i i did that interview yesterday with that mother who they sent the cps and state police
[41:01.040 --> 41:07.040]  after because she wouldn't vaccinate her child and then i looked at the comments and the emails
[41:07.040 --> 41:12.640]  on the videos that are on youtube now and from the nightly news last night and it's military
[41:12.640 --> 41:17.680]  people all talking going yeah we were tested for this genetic disorder my wife and i and they say
[41:17.680 --> 41:24.960]  it's impossible for our son to have it but he has it and it turns out that about 20 people just in my
[41:24.960 --> 41:31.360]  unit now have children with this uh they made all the pregnant women too even if you're pregnant
[41:31.360 --> 41:38.000]  the military uh take the h1n1 which before three years ago they never told pregnant women take any
[41:38.000 --> 41:45.760]  shot but instead of see they're testing can they say pregnant women it's most important for you to
[41:45.760 --> 41:51.600]  take it when the insert says pregnant women don't take it see it's all an exercise in craziness
[41:52.640 --> 41:57.120]  hey let's see if they'll go through body scanners and let us stick our hands down their pants
[41:57.120 --> 42:01.840]  first for a year we'll rub them on the outside then after that we'll start going in the waistband
[42:01.840 --> 42:07.760]  and then we'll start going in the pants and into the body with dirty gloves let's do it with miss usa
[42:14.240 --> 42:20.800]  they know what they're doing it's dog training it's absolutely breaking your will where you'll
[42:20.800 --> 42:25.520]  do whatever they want so when they take your pension fund take your bank account devalue the
[42:25.520 --> 42:32.320]  dollar jack up your water and power prices you will just sit there feeling powerless and let them do it
[42:34.080 --> 42:39.280]  because the criminals have figured out they've already gone a million miles and they know you're
[42:39.280 --> 42:45.200]  pushing back so they can warp 10 million ahead it won't matter if we push back 10 million miles
[42:45.200 --> 42:52.400]  they're still got a million miles on us so they're just bum rushing psychological warfare exercising
[42:52.400 --> 42:58.960]  all this tyranny upon us to just try to totally overwhelm us and send us into catatonic learned
[42:58.960 --> 43:05.120]  helplessness it's all right out of their psychological warfare manuals but if you're
[43:05.120 --> 43:20.320]  conscious to this you can turn it around but we face a devastating situation in our society
[43:20.320 --> 43:27.120]  i'm gonna say it again and i'm going to the other news and your calls america is now the beta
[43:27.120 --> 43:32.560]  testing ground along with england and then it's rolled into europe and the rest of it you take
[43:32.560 --> 43:38.160]  california where four months ago the governor signed a bill that they give your children
[43:38.160 --> 43:42.720]  inoculations without even telling you that they did it but they get around the fourth
[43:42.720 --> 43:48.560]  inoculation bit saying your 11 or 12 year old gave them permission they sit them in a brainwashing
[43:48.560 --> 43:54.960]  class show them scary videos of people dying from papillomavirus that kills about 3 000 a year
[43:57.120 --> 44:01.040]  the vaccine in the insert says it doesn't even protect you from it and actually causes problems
[44:01.040 --> 44:05.760]  but they have you know they don't tell the kids that and they say it's your right to have an abortion
[44:05.760 --> 44:10.960]  in the class it's your right to go on riddling or prozac and we have school nurses that can get you
[44:10.960 --> 44:16.880]  with a government's psychologist this is on record and it's your right to take these shots
[44:16.880 --> 44:23.040]  and when they had the lady from the state on cnn i played the clip yesterday what did she say
[44:23.040 --> 44:26.640]  she said hey your kids are using drugs your kids are having sex your kids are having abortions
[44:26.640 --> 44:32.800]  without you knowing so we're going to give them shots without you knowing that's just as outrageous
[44:32.800 --> 44:37.840]  to say and we're going to stick our hands down your pants and she said it with a straight face
[44:37.840 --> 44:48.240]  and even the cnn talking head said excuse me excuse even the host broke their their matrix
[44:48.240 --> 44:53.040]  conditioning for a minute and snapped out of it and went because obviously that that person's a
[44:53.040 --> 44:58.400]  parent i didn't look it up i can tell the woman is middle-aged woman a reporter uh anchor she says
[44:58.400 --> 45:05.280]  excuse me the parents don't you're saying it's crazy that they be told and she's like what
[45:05.280 --> 45:10.800]  what you mean the government's gonna gonna stick their hands down my pants and put me in a microwave
[45:10.800 --> 45:16.800]  oven you mean the tsa setting up checkpoints on the highway you see you've got to to really let
[45:16.800 --> 45:23.920]  it sink in and just it and just wake up to how crazy it is i'm not the crazy guy on the radio
[45:23.920 --> 45:28.800]  as the corporate media calls me because i cover real news and get freaked out about real issues
[45:28.800 --> 45:37.920]  and don't cover fluff and mindless garbage i'm a normal person who the mind control doesn't work
[45:37.920 --> 45:44.560]  on the only way it works on me is making me frustrated and angry because once you're awake
[45:44.560 --> 45:50.000]  and once you've studied it it's everywhere i was talking to my wife last night because i was sitting
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.320]  i got home at eight o'clock she was about to you know we're about to go read stories but the kids
[45:54.320 --> 45:58.800]  to bed and she and i had some dinner leftovers there i was sitting there at the kitchen table eating
[45:59.760 --> 46:06.640]  and i was watching on the ipad uh the nightly news uh that was just re-airing as i taped it last
[46:06.640 --> 46:11.600]  night it it aired from seven to eight and it was it was re-streaming and she heard the interview
[46:11.600 --> 46:16.320]  with the investigative journalist uh you know about all these brain damaged children now he woke up
[46:16.320 --> 46:22.320]  because of his son you know uh getting nine shots in one day because they demanded it and
[46:22.320 --> 46:27.520]  how he went from talking and giggling and laughing to you know just not even talking and and and
[46:27.520 --> 46:31.920]  explosive diarrhea for four years they wouldn't tell them why it was happening and they they
[46:31.920 --> 46:36.400]  discovered ways to reverse it and she looked at my children who were all sitting around they were
[46:36.400 --> 46:40.960]  listening to it and she said see that's why you're not vaccinated but we've had to say no to the
[46:40.960 --> 46:46.560]  nurses and people that pressure us that's why you're hardly ever sick and that's why you're so healthy
[46:46.560 --> 46:52.560]  and it's why you know you're you're you're doing so well and she looked at me and she said you know
[46:52.560 --> 46:57.520]  you haven't watched television in years other than movies you watch but she said you know i don't
[46:57.520 --> 47:03.360]  watch any of the drama shows anymore because like i told you about three years ago all of them all of
[47:03.360 --> 47:12.080]  the women's shows sitcoms medical shows csi she said almost every episode there's a child molester
[47:12.080 --> 47:18.800]  or a child murderer or a terrorist who also doesn't vaccinate their children and she said my god i
[47:18.800 --> 47:24.160]  just think about all these innocent people who are watching entertainment not realizing it's
[47:24.160 --> 47:31.120]  brainwashing i mean think of how creepy it is that they're saying it's the law you've got to take
[47:31.120 --> 47:39.040]  vaccines and they are lying to people and saying it isn't saying we'll shoot you up without consent
[47:39.040 --> 47:46.720]  and doctors are calling the police on people and the the the tv shows are saying you've got to be
[47:46.720 --> 47:53.120]  vaccinated and the movies and just everything and you've got these adults these doctors i know a
[47:53.120 --> 47:57.680]  doctor here in town who's pro vaccine and writes articles for the paper and everything known the
[47:57.680 --> 48:04.640]  doctor for years and uh when i do run into her occasionally she's friends of the family you know
[48:04.640 --> 48:09.440]  you know it's just disdain because i don't believe that i should take hundreds of shots and that i
[48:09.440 --> 48:14.880]  even question anything and if you bring up with these people well look at all the nurses getting
[48:14.880 --> 48:18.960]  paralyzed and doctors getting sick from the shots i mean i can show you reports i don't want to see
[48:18.960 --> 48:27.840]  them and when you talk to these people that push this stuff they never have friends they get home
[48:27.840 --> 48:34.960]  at six or seven and they turn on their favorite show and their friend is the simulated hospital show
[48:34.960 --> 48:41.920]  with the queen b women running everything taking people's kids on the show and forcing vaccines
[48:41.920 --> 48:48.560]  on people and that's that government produced mind control is their family and is their world
[48:48.560 --> 48:55.040]  and they take this synthetic piped in propaganda and they go out and then take it to us in the real
[48:55.040 --> 49:00.960]  world simulating anomalous they're in trances their brainwaves are right at you know this is now
[49:00.960 --> 49:08.640]  coming out right at sleep level the general public is is literally a zombie they are in a trance
[49:10.320 --> 49:16.400]  and these sitcoms and dramas all attack ron paul with subliminals uh and other things
[49:18.160 --> 49:23.360]  and and and and and so you you wonder why the general public can't wake up you're either a
[49:23.360 --> 49:29.040]  you're either a waker you aren't because they're on fluoride they're on all these other chemicals
[49:29.040 --> 49:34.240]  there's bisphenol a estrogen mimicers it's in everything they're watching tv an average of
[49:34.240 --> 49:38.480]  four and a half hours a day the youth are basically already in the matrix doing nothing but playing
[49:38.480 --> 49:44.960]  video games and acting trendy they don't even have real personalities now the language is shrinking
[49:44.960 --> 49:50.320]  to where now the average youth even if they make decent grades cannot really talk or they talk in
[49:50.320 --> 50:00.320]  shorthand you know best friend ever k jibble dribble they're reducing the language everyone's
[50:00.320 --> 50:07.120]  plugged in it's totally insane the men are watching sports the cancer rates are exploding the curse

[50:14.480 --> 50:23.440]  damage and the death accelerated they expected parents to get angry and and their war gaming
[50:23.440 --> 50:28.800]  right now how to deal with it how to spin it and so now that record numbers aren't taking vaccines

[57:44.560 --> 57:52.080]  later bragged that uh they did it to help huntsman uh the uh video was called china john
[57:52.640 --> 57:56.640]  implying that ron paul doesn't like asians and then that's good you know when somebody
[57:57.280 --> 58:01.680]  creates something and attributes to you they need to get sued so good job to ron paul
[58:01.680 --> 58:07.760]  paul and uh you know the the the the corporate dinosaur media needs to retract it as well
[58:09.120 --> 58:13.200]  it's one thing if somebody makes a mistake everybody does that but when it's malicious

[1:09:32.880 --> 1:09:37.920]  this week and said okay we'll change the bills but that's only to try to stunt opposition
[1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:44.000]  but they are starting to buckle to the pressure now i want to hit a few other news articles

[1:09:56.080 --> 1:10:00.640]  vaccines they've got out in this attempt all over the country to inject children in public
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:08.240]  schools without parental consent it's now going on illegally nationwide california actually passed a
[1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:14.560]  law to do it but a law that is unconstitutional is still illegal as well marbury versus madison
[1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:22.400]  but we are certainly not in kansas anymore and it's going to get crazier from this point on out
[1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:27.760]  and i want to break down later after dr blalock leaves us in the next hour
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:33.120]  the architecture of this new world order from the internet angle
[1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:41.440]  you see government is threatened at one level by the internet because it's destroying their
[1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:46.720]  credibility but the big hitters they're actually created by darpa and cia funding like google
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:52.560]  they're saying don't censor it but not because they're against overt censorship but because this
[1:10:52.560 --> 1:11:00.000]  is hamfisted by congress and will screw up the infrastructure itself when google and the heads
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:05.600]  of google obviously attend belterberg understand let the web grow some more where everything's
[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:12.960]  dependent on it so they can track and trace everything and then start to put filters on it
[1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:20.160]  slowly to consolidate the power google just thinks they're trying to lower the drawbridge
[1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:26.880]  on freedom a little too early i'm going to be breaking that down coming up in the next hour
[1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:32.720]  but i do want to go to a rob greg ed michelle nate and others but first
[1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:48.720]  let me get to the tsa news that i have if you go to info wars dot com we have a plethora of
[1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:51.840]  articles that we've done breaking this down in the past they're linked to

[1:12:07.040 --> 1:12:12.160]  is this has been going on a long time it's a violation of your privacy it's a violation of
[1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:28.240]  attempt to mimic because the feds are involved and it also exposes you to radiation risk
[1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:34.560]  but here's the article nypd commissioner ryan kelly told cbs news in new york his department
[1:12:34.560 --> 1:12:42.080]  is looking to deploy terahertz imaging detection scanners on the street in the war on illegal guns
[1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:48.800]  now remember whatever they say they're looking at it that's like the head of the office of science
[1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:55.200]  the white house science are his first speech three and a half years ago was to say hey guess what
[1:12:55.200 --> 1:13:01.440]  we've already been testing for decades terraforming or geoengineering the atmosphere with aluminum

[1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:17.120]  classified but so far it's been a a test and that's what they're saying when you watch the cbs

[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:40.640]  um there's a few things on my radar uh i like to say that i moved uh from michigan down to
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:46.560]  north carolina this year and there's definitely huge difference as far as the number of people
[1:25:46.560 --> 1:25:52.320]  that talk about what's going on and are awake to what's going on and and thank god i i kind of
[1:25:52.320 --> 1:25:57.280]  followed my dream and uh we moved down here and this is the place where i need to be because
[1:25:57.280 --> 1:26:03.200]  i'm telling you there's definitely pockets of this uh country they're definitely more awake than
[1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:09.520]  others and i hope uh you know i'm kind of you know slowly passing along everything that i'm
[1:26:09.520 --> 1:26:15.120]  learning to the people that are at least you know open to listening to it because there's a lot of
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:20.480]  people that don't really they don't want their their heads in the dirt you know so but um but
[1:26:20.480 --> 1:26:25.840]  you're saying that you're finding more people awake in north carolina than you found in michigan
[1:26:25.840 --> 1:26:32.400]  oh i i'm telling you my friends up in michigan they pretty much disowned me and down here and
[1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:36.240]  we didn't move because so when you talk about the bill of rights and constitution that's that's
[1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:41.600]  evil in america yeah we're the bad guys well no i talked about 9 11 because you know i i remember
[1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:46.080]  that day when building 7 came down i was eating dinner i'm like what the hell oh i've got police
[1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:50.240]  on tape saying get back they're gonna blow it up man i talked to the deputy head of emergency
[1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:53.920]  management he said yeah they blew it up and so they they killed him a few weeks later
[1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:58.800]  i mean i even interviewed people hey you're the deputy head yeah they blew it up oh they killed
[1:26:58.800 --> 1:27:04.560]  him oh no big you know i've had quite a few guests they killed the dc madame i told her on air i said
[1:27:04.560 --> 1:27:09.680]  they're probably gonna kill you a month later dead a murderer just you know all the new world
[1:27:09.680 --> 1:27:14.640]  order is really nice people though everything's fine yeah i'm supposed to just ignore all the
[1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:19.120]  news feeds a cop saying it back they're blowing up the building yeah i'm just supposed to ignore
[1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:25.680]  that yeah it's coming down right away yeah just and then i talked to the actual cops who were on
[1:27:25.680 --> 1:27:31.520]  the video in new york i ended up going to new york repeating and meeting them meeting the cops who
[1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:37.280]  were on video on tv they're like yeah there was a countdown and uh the the feds told us they weren't
[1:27:37.280 --> 1:27:41.600]  supposed to tell us there was a countdown but for our safety they nicely told us they were gonna
[1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:48.240]  blow it up get back i mean i'm talking to cops who saw it they blew it up they said on the news
[1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:53.920]  they blew it up national news said they blew it up and i'm a conspiracy theorist
[1:27:56.720 --> 1:28:01.360]  yeah well you know buildings fall down like that it's uh you know physics is different in uh new
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:06.640]  york okay so let's get real that's why it is in new york buildings fall down again and and two
[1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:12.080]  passports were found in the rubble that day and if you believe that i mean this is those passports
[1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:19.680]  are made of stuff tougher than Thor's hammer then the devil's uh derriere i mean that these are the
[1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:27.200]  hardest things on the planet and that's reasonable that the plane flew in and that out of their jackets
[1:28:27.200 --> 1:28:32.320]  they exploded in the flame through the building down to the ground with the collapse of the buildings
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:38.800]  and the five feet of dust and all the bedlam and were found that day that's totally reasonable sir
[1:28:38.800 --> 1:28:43.200]  and if you don't believe it you're crazy that's like a needle in a haystack you know that's an
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:49.680]  easy thing to do oh sir come on the government loves you hey there's two people that i i've kind
[1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:54.640]  of heard and i've been listening to your show quite a while um i read her book dr judy wood
[1:28:55.360 --> 1:29:01.600]  she actually discusses energy filled weapons that were that she theorizes that were used on 911
[1:29:02.240 --> 1:29:07.280]  and the you know i for a long time i thought it was nano thermite that brought the buildings down
[1:29:07.280 --> 1:29:10.480]  well let me just be clear because i'm going to break and then i'll come back with other calls
[1:29:10.480 --> 1:29:18.960]  and dr blalock i have never criticized preemptively people that get into speculative theories about
[1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:24.320]  911 and not even so much her but others out of the gates attacked me and said you know five years
[1:29:24.320 --> 1:29:31.920]  ago you won't cover this and so i mean automatically it's like convert to this idea i just go with 911
[1:29:31.920 --> 1:29:38.160]  what i can prove the hijackers according to even mainstream media were trained at us bases
[1:29:38.160 --> 1:29:45.280]  and were protected by the cia and the side now that's a fact and there's all these other facts
[1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:51.360]  i stick to what i can prove that proves the official story is a fairy tale we're on the march

[1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:55.440]  is dr russell blalock he is a retired board certified neurosurgeon author he's a former
[1:34:55.440 --> 1:34:59.600]  clinical assistant professor of neurology at the university of mississippi medical center
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:04.240]  he is the author of numerous books and numerous scientific articles including excitotoxins
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:10.560]  in 94 and it's now gone to the mainline literature uh on neutrosuite and a lot more 2002 on natural
[1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:16.000]  strategies for cancer patients 2003 and writes a monthly newsletter the blalock wellness report
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:22.800]  blalock has uh uh just uh you know an amazing job over the years exposing the h1n1 shot all of it
[1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:28.000]  and he joins us here today to get into california saying we're going to shoot your kids up with
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  garter cell without even telling the parents that's now law um but you can't really legalize
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:37.680]  tyranny you can't have a law saying black people are slaves i don't care if you have a law the
[1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:45.040]  law's bull but also we had an article on info wars dot com that he wants to correct it's fluoride
[1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:50.160]  link to number one cause of death and new research and in his analysis he says yes
[1:35:50.880 --> 1:35:56.560]  in his email to us yes it is connected to the plaques but not in the way you're saying so he's
[1:35:56.560 --> 1:36:02.480]  going to flesh that out we'll have an update uh added to one of our great authors uh uh research
[1:36:02.480 --> 1:36:07.600]  on that front as well but i had a lot of scientists on who talk about it you know related to the
[1:36:07.600 --> 1:36:12.160]  calcification also in the joints not just the arteries but i'm not a medical doctor or brain
[1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:17.920]  surgeon so we'll get that from dr blalock uh here in a moment dr blalock uh we've seen record
[1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:22.800]  numbers not taking the shots it came out that the h1n1 did cause Guillain beret something you
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:27.680]  predicted it did come out that they knew this it did come out that in the canadian government
[1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:33.280]  studies as you know in university studies that it reduced your normal uh autoimmune response to
[1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:38.400]  regular flu by half i mean there's really an awakening happening right now so they're coming
[1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:44.000]  down with both feet on us and they've got cdc programs as you know calling people's homes
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:50.960]  sending letters uh local funded health departments by the feds are going door to door now saying
[1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:57.840]  we're here to give your child a shot just total color of law hoaxing uh is this desperation or
[1:36:57.840 --> 1:37:06.640]  what's behind it and and what's the basics on these vaccines sir well it is uh desperation
[1:37:06.640 --> 1:37:13.520]  and the problem they have now is a lot of good hard sciences coming out showing that these
[1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:21.440]  vaccines are not safe particularly due to the adjuvant aluminum aluminum compounds uh there's
[1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:28.000]  a group out of vancouver uh and friends uh with these researchers and they've written several
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:34.720]  articles that are very powerful showing that this is not safe there's also uh immunologists at work
[1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:40.480]  with autoimmune diseases that are showing that a number of autoimmune diseases are being related
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:49.280]  to these vaccines uh narcolepsy was occurring in these small children uh in australia they they
[1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:55.840]  blocked the vaccine because of the the uh onset of this narcolepsy in these small children in norway
[1:37:56.880 --> 1:38:02.480]  this is devastating neurological damage and we have a very good mechanism to explain this
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:08.400]  i've written several articles in peer review journals in which i explain how this mechanism
[1:38:08.400 --> 1:38:14.880]  works and why the vaccines is doing this well they can no longer completely ignore this because it's
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:22.320]  in uh the prestigious journals now and that terrifies them i've never seen such promotion
[1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:30.160]  of vaccines as occurred after this h1n1 you would have thought after all the material that i gave
[1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:36.160]  you showing that even the cdc knew it uh and the world health organization knew it that they were
[1:38:36.160 --> 1:38:41.280]  caught in their lives and the damage that was done to millions of people worldwide you think
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:45.840]  uh they would have backed off this push for vaccines but no they doubled their effort
[1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:53.440]  uh which is terrifying because it's destroying the lives of tens of millions if not hundreds of
[1:38:53.440 --> 1:39:02.800]  millions of children and adults worldwide so it's a severe act of desperation they're going to
[1:39:02.800 --> 1:39:09.920]  churches they're going to pharmacies uh everywhere i go into pharmacies just signs everywhere now this
[1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:18.400]  year we had i looked on the cdc site zero deaths no deaths from flu uh yet they were pushing it as if
[1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:24.400]  the streets were littered with dead bodies from the flu and yet sir i see articles even in mainstream
[1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:32.720]  news every day about uh this company fine for 15 babies dying an illegal vaccine test uh this
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:37.760]  nurse died one hour after flu shot uh i mean i talked to people i have a guy who works here
[1:39:37.760 --> 1:39:43.360]  whose wife's an rn she knows a nurse in a wheelchair a young nurse from it three years later from the
[1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:48.560]  shot they made her take or they threatened to fire her i mean this is a scourge but then i'm
[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:54.160]  seeing some doctors and nurses now going public at you know thanks to you and others work and as
[1:39:54.160 --> 1:39:59.440]  you said peer reviewed journals coming out and confirming uh your pioneering research and others
[1:39:59.440 --> 1:40:05.440]  but on the other side i'm seeing other doctors and including doctors i know personally uh through
[1:40:05.440 --> 1:40:12.800]  family connections and things who are becoming almost like jihadi's or uh i guess the term could be uh
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:19.520]  they're on some type of crusade wild eyed saying arrest people that don't take it there's never
[1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:24.880]  been a problem from vaccines they're totally perfect so those that have been out there pushing it
[1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:29.920]  forever at the low level they're not going to admit they were wrong so it's almost like people
[1:40:29.920 --> 1:40:34.160]  who've been involved in abortion will never admit it's wrong most of them because they don't want
[1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:39.120]  to admit what they've done do you see what i'm saying well the people that are that are coming
[1:40:39.120 --> 1:40:45.760]  out with these shrill replies about the safety when you pin them down i mean when they're gonna
[1:40:45.760 --> 1:40:52.560]  debate me not a more debate me or any any of the other people who question the safety uh you find
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:58.800]  out they know absolutely nothing about neurological injury they know absolutely nothing about the
[1:40:58.800 --> 1:41:06.160]  immune response in the brain uh from vaccination for instance uh dr paul offit who is their leading
[1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:13.760]  cheerleader uh he admitted on uh videotape that he didn't know anything about neurology
[1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:19.600]  and he couldn't imagine what mechanism could connect vaccines to seizures and other neurological
[1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:26.000]  injuries i've written extensively about it i've had uh at least 10 articles written
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:31.920]  demonstrating how systemic immune overstimulation could produce brain damage and
[1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:38.080]  malformed brains and children but sir i'm not a brain surgeon neurologist like you are
[1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:42.720]  i just know that i've talked to literally thousands of parents over the years
[1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:48.000]  and i've seen the medical reports that you take the 18 month old in for the third round of shots
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:53.040]  a lot of times they have a convulsion right there in in the clinic or right there in the car or that
[1:41:53.040 --> 1:41:59.920]  night and billy never talks again he wakes up like a six month old baby when the day before
[1:41:59.920 --> 1:42:05.680]  he was running around reading his abc's and catching the football i mean it's pretty obvious i mean
[1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:11.120]  i'm not a rocket scientist but if i watch a truck run over somebody and they've got broken legs i
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:16.880]  don't think well they just broke their legs magically the truck ran them over well if this
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:23.840]  was anything other than vaccines you would see an immediate banning of this overnight i remember back
[1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:30.240]  when uh little premature children babies were being born and a lot of them were ending up blind
[1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:37.440]  and they didn't know why uh then some uh intrepid investigator discovered well when you use 100
[1:42:37.440 --> 1:42:44.240]  percent oxygen in these little cribs and these premies it destroys the eyes uh well they didn't
[1:42:44.240 --> 1:42:51.200]  deny it and and wait and see if they could prove it absolutely they changed the oxygen percentage
[1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:57.040]  and blindness disappeared what was the full what the blindness disappeared again what was the um
[1:42:57.840 --> 1:43:02.480]  the drug in the 50s that caused the hundreds of thousands of the babies that have the short arms
[1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:08.000]  and legs from the uh it was a tranquilizer women were taking while pregnant they told them it was
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:15.520]  okay yeah it was thalidomide and thalidomide was a very safe tranquilizer for adults but it
[1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:22.080]  produced a gross terrible uh malfamations in these small babies well they didn't wait one second to
[1:43:22.080 --> 1:43:29.440]  ban thalidomide and then they didn't launch this uh uh attack on anyone who made a connection
[1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:34.400]  between thalidomide and these malformation they immediately banned thalidomide and the
[1:43:34.400 --> 1:43:41.040]  malformation stopped well the government for instance uh they know a lot of this and that's
[1:43:41.040 --> 1:43:47.280]  why they refuse absolutely and I have a framers and epidemiologists who applied for a million
[1:43:47.280 --> 1:43:54.000]  dollar grant to compare unvaccinated children in the Amish community with vaccinated children
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:44:00.160]  their whole health parameters very good design study they refused to fund it they've never uh
[1:44:00.160 --> 1:44:07.360]  uh given any funding for any study that will compare vaccinated and unvaccinated children
[1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:11.520]  in terms of their total health because they know what it's going to show it's going to show that
[1:44:11.520 --> 1:44:18.960]  the unvaccinated children are infinitely healthier and there is good scientific evidence in a
[1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:25.040]  mechanism by which this over vaccination that we're doing now in the world uh the United States
[1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:30.480]  is worse than any country in the world can destroy the immune system making these children more
[1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:35.440]  susceptible to infections they're going to have a higher death rate from minor infections
[1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:43.680]  and they know that and that that fuels uh the panic for more vaccines uh we have college students
[1:44:43.680 --> 1:44:49.280]  are told you have to get all the childhood vaccines again now you're thinking all of us
[1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:54.400]  went through college the university and we didn't have any problem with meningitis and all these
[1:44:54.400 --> 1:44:59.520]  other things they're talking about today i don't remember a single student ever dying
[1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:06.240]  but now suddenly it's such an emergency we have to make sure every college student is vaccinated
[1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:12.400]  well i i have treated college students who were just destroyed one was a very brilliant young lady
[1:45:13.200 --> 1:45:18.560]  daughter of a friend of mine who took these vaccines and she was just devastated neurologically
[1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:26.960]  and uh uh physically we did some things and bought her through it but it there's no question it was
[1:45:26.960 --> 1:45:32.400]  due to the vaccine her father's a physician doctor blalock joining us right now why
[1:45:33.600 --> 1:45:39.120]  if i'm studying this for decades what is the strategy of the big pharma because obviously
[1:45:39.120 --> 1:45:45.520]  as they damage more and more people the tide is turning against them is it short-term profit i know
[1:45:45.520 --> 1:45:50.800]  we've talked about eugenics population reduction are they just trying to set the precedent where
[1:45:50.800 --> 1:45:56.080]  they can get away with whatever they want whenever they want i mean what is the method of this madness
[1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:03.440]  well if you look at it a very close parallel to what we're seeing now was the eugenics movement
[1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:09.600]  and the in the 20s and 30s up to the 50s they told us the same thing this is for public health
[1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:16.880]  uh unless we get rid of these bad gene pools we're going to ruin society and all of us are
[1:46:16.880 --> 1:46:23.600]  going to pay it is an emergency public health issue that we round up these people forcibly sterilize
[1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:30.160]  them against their will even put them in in concentration gulags which if you read uh uh
[1:46:30.160 --> 1:46:36.480]  the book by black about the history of eugenics in the united states where they forcibly uh
[1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:43.840]  sterilized thousands of young women against their will and they used the same argument well now we
[1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:48.880]  look back on and we say oh this was an atrocity in american history that we allowed public health
[1:46:48.880 --> 1:46:56.480]  officials to put these people in gulags and in fact there was a very well known uh ophthalmologist
[1:46:56.480 --> 1:47:01.840]  who said anyone who wears glasses should be sterilized because we don't want to promote
[1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:06.880]  blindness in the united states now this is a matter of record he even submitted a bill
[1:47:07.520 --> 1:47:13.200]  to the new york state legislature to have it where people with glasses would be forcibly
[1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:20.080]  sterilized now this is where this insanity can lead well with that parallel in mind here we come
[1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:25.840]  with a vaccine policy that is just as dangerous or more dangerous it's destroying brains destroying
[1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:31.920]  immune systems and we're saying oh it's a public health emergency that these people be vaccinated
[1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:37.200]  now these cheerleaders that you're talking about these physicians who just uh get livid over this
[1:47:37.200 --> 1:47:43.120]  and wild eyed they're the people who are listening to this propaganda they are listening to propaganda
[1:47:43.120 --> 1:47:49.360]  that says oh we're going to return to the days of mass death from measles uh if we don't mass
[1:47:49.360 --> 1:47:56.000]  vaccinate people enforceably well if you look back before we had a measles vaccine which i grew
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:01.840]  up under those days i didn't have anybody in any of my classes die from measles all of us got the
[1:48:01.840 --> 1:48:07.920]  measles i don't remember anybody in town uh who had children that died from the measles by the way
[1:48:07.920 --> 1:48:12.080]  i've got three children none of them ever vaccinated and they've all had the measles
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:17.600]  and it was no big deal well it's not saying that there weren't children who died from the measles
[1:48:17.600 --> 1:48:23.520]  they were immune suppressed or sick from other diseases like leukemia and they will die but this
[1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:28.560]  whole idea that we've got to massively vaccinate are we going to return to those days well the
[1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:34.560]  days they're talking about are in the 1800s and 1700s they're not talking about in modern times
[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:40.480]  when there was a sanitation and better food that's what caused the drastic fall in these diseases
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:46.400]  and the low mortality rate if you look at the mortality of diseases for which there's no vaccine
[1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:52.080]  in the united states it had the lowest death rate and complication rate anywhere in the world well
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:48:57.360]  doctor what about this i mean i i see articles all the time i saw one in cbs news just a few
[1:48:57.360 --> 1:49:02.000]  weeks ago again every year where they're giving these polio vaccines all over the world and it's
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:08.880]  causing uh basically it's like it's weaponized super deadly polio and now i've got a report right
[1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:17.360]  here the main cause globally now of polio is the vaccine yeah they even named it vaccine mediated polio
[1:49:18.080 --> 1:49:22.480]  because the world health organization admitted it was being caused by the vaccine now the
[1:49:22.480 --> 1:49:28.960]  interesting thing was in the united states we recognized that the live polio vaccine was the
[1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:35.440]  only cause of polio in the united states after the 1960s every case was caused by the vaccine
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:40.880]  so they outlawed it you could only use the killed vaccine in the united states so the drug companies
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:46.720]  took the live virus polio vaccine and bought it to the third world and started mass vaccinating them
[1:49:46.720 --> 1:49:52.880]  knowing it was going to cause epidemics of polio well then there's an article in the world health
[1:49:52.880 --> 1:49:59.680]  journal which says well yes we did create an epidemic of this special vaccine called polio
[1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:06.240]  but now that we've triggered it we have to double our efforts at vaccination this shows the insanity
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:11.920]  of these people but as you said they are coming down with both feet with their propaganda right
[1:50:11.920 --> 1:50:16.800]  now in a desperation i see it backfiring dr blalock we're about to go to break but briefly
[1:50:16.800 --> 1:50:22.480]  what are you seeing out there in the public well the public is uh a lot wiser than the
[1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:27.760]  medical profession overall itself particularly the pediatrician they understand what's happening
[1:50:27.760 --> 1:50:32.240]  because like you say they read these stories they talk to their friends and say my child was
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:38.480]  perfectly normal and doing really well was vaccinated two days later uh they end up with
[1:50:38.480 --> 1:50:45.440]  seizures that's uncontrollable or or neurological deterioration so you know any rational mind when
[1:50:45.440 --> 1:50:49.680]  you're looking at cases all over the world everybody's having the same experience it's that
[1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:56.080]  close association only an idiot with the denial only an idiot or somebody in denial because
[1:50:56.080 --> 1:50:59.840]  they've been shooting kids up and don't want to admit it live back with dr blalock will give

[1:54:16.240 --> 1:54:21.360]  shots is hurting people i mean the u.s. number one in obesity number one in cancer
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:28.080]  no i'm just number one right down the line and and and we're the main beneficiaries of this medical
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:34.160]  mafia going back to dr russell blalock md retired brain surgeon neurologist
[1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:41.040]  i we've only got this short segment one more little segment with you dr blalock and there's
[1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:48.720]  so much obviously to to talk about but anything else you think you should add on vaccines before
[1:54:48.720 --> 1:54:54.880]  we get some into fluoride well the really frightening thing about the vaccines is that
[1:54:54.880 --> 1:54:59.600]  these people know that they're endangered so they're trying to push mandated vaccines in the
[1:54:59.600 --> 1:55:04.960]  states that means you have no choice whatsoever uh well a lot of the states that have mandated
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:11.600]  vaccines like hpv the garden cell uh there's a lot of options opting out that's allowed whether
[1:55:11.600 --> 1:55:18.480]  some articles recently in and jama the journal the am a we said we ought to get rid of the ability
[1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:23.440]  for these parents to opt out and these children should be forced to be vaccinated well they know
[1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:30.560]  that if they have to debate this uh they're gonna lose so they want to go to legislatures and judges
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:35.600]  have this mandated so you're you have no choice they'll take your child away and forcefully vaccinate
[1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:40.080]  them and then when the child is destroyed neurologically they'll give them back to you and say now
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:46.080]  oh take care of the child uh we don't think it anything do the vaccine well uh this is happening
[1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:51.120]  thousands of times tens of thousands of time and listen i was talking to this nurse and others a
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:54.960]  lot of times when they make you get it and then now you're in a wheelchair they don't even want to
[1:55:54.960 --> 1:56:01.200]  see you it's like you don't even exist they take no responsibility exactly and the doctors say
[1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:06.080]  there's no way that could be connected to the vaccine when there's a very good mechanism you
[1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:11.680]  can do this an experimental animal uh you vaccinate them with the same thing that's used as a
[1:56:11.680 --> 1:56:16.400]  immune adjuvant in the vaccine you'll produce neurological injury you'll produce paralysis
[1:56:16.400 --> 1:56:22.640]  briefly uh from your research and others what what on average is happening in the brain because it's
[1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:26.720]  i mean you always hear it's when they give them the double the triple uh one one reporter i was
[1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:31.600]  talking to they said oh your child's behind we'll give them nine shots six shots nine different
[1:56:31.600 --> 1:56:39.360]  viruses and it was that night convulsions uh and for four years you know screwed up guts everything
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  well it is absolutely proven if you massively stimulate the immune system systemically that
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:53.200]  is by a vaccine it will massively activate the brain's special immune system which is governed by
[1:56:53.200 --> 1:57:01.040]  microglia cells and these pour out excitotoxins into the brain as well as inflammatory cytokines
[1:57:01.040 --> 1:57:07.120]  for months even years and that's what's producing the damage in the death in these children well
[1:57:07.120 --> 1:57:12.480]  this has been done experimentally in animals and thousands of laboratories all over the country
[1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:18.720]  this is a very hot topic yet we ignore this research that shows that if you do this you're
[1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:24.400]  going to get this damage and that the brain is highly vulnerable at this age we just totally
[1:57:24.400 --> 1:57:29.600]  ignore it and a parallel that uh well what if you say it's important that people take their
[1:57:29.600 --> 1:57:34.400]  hypertensive medications so we should make it where we don't tell them there that there's
[1:57:34.400 --> 1:57:39.280]  complications to these medications because that might scare them away from taking the medicine
[1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:44.000]  so we can start lying about side effects of drugs and everything else that has to do with
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  surgery or anything else we just won't tell people that things can happen and that's exactly what
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:55.520]  they're doing with vaccine they all admit these these complications occur but they say well if the
[1:57:55.520 --> 1:58:00.880]  public finds out they'll be afraid to get the vaccine and then we won't be yeah so they claim
[1:58:00.880 --> 1:58:05.120]  it's this trade-off but then we know it's producing uh immunity we know it's not even protecting
[1:58:05.120 --> 1:58:08.800]  people in most cases so it's it's a fraud when you break it down we're about to go to break
[1:58:08.800 --> 1:58:13.760]  with just five more minutes with you but looking at autoimmune responses this wasn't it the swine
[1:58:13.760 --> 1:58:18.880]  flu that killed tens of millions it was an over autoimmune response in the lungs that actually
[1:58:18.880 --> 1:58:22.880]  killed people i mean it's well known that a regular virus a lot of times kills you from
[1:58:22.880 --> 1:58:29.200]  the autoimmune response correct doctor well your body's overreaction to the vaccine absolutely
[1:58:29.200 --> 1:58:36.160]  and to the virus but you see this is this goes to an informed consent issue patients and families
[1:58:36.160 --> 1:58:45.760]  are being denied informed exactly stay there back in one minute you are listening to gcm visit gcm
[1:58:45.760 --> 1:58:56.000]  live dot com today hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:59:02.080]  this is our last chance to not relive history is it finishing off this agenda that we're pulling
[1:59:02.080 --> 1:59:08.560]  the rug from underneath americans at home i've turned menace influence on our president in congress
[1:59:08.560 --> 1:59:14.720]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens
[1:59:14.720 --> 1:59:21.120]  to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:25.760]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[1:59:25.760 --> 1:59:32.880]  tim geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[1:59:32.880 --> 1:59:40.320]  like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy
[1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:46.960]  a fall of the republic on dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high
[1:59:46.960 --> 1:59:59.040]  quality at prison planet dot tv waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:00:05.600 --> 2:00:12.880]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:00:12.880 --> 2:00:21.760]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:23.360 --> 2:00:28.240]  yeah if you just tuned in dr blaylock i was breaking down the fact that it's on the inserts of
[2:00:28.240 --> 2:00:32.560]  these vaccines the doctors and people that tell you oh there's no mercury in there or this doesn't
[2:00:32.560 --> 2:00:38.160]  cause neurological disorders they know full well it's on the stinking insert instead what the big
[2:00:38.160 --> 2:00:44.320]  companies do or or when you go to the pharmacy is they have fact sheets that aren't the actual
[2:00:44.320 --> 2:00:48.880]  sheet it's a bunch of propaganda and they go oh everything's fine honey and it's because these
[2:00:48.880 --> 2:00:53.360]  cold-blooded companies want to make money and more they want to set the precedent to basically
[2:00:53.360 --> 2:00:56.880]  carry out eugenics in the four minutes we've got left with dr blaylock them are coming back with
[2:00:56.880 --> 2:01:04.080]  your calls and a bunch of big news here on this wednesday edition you'd send us a note and we always
[2:01:04.080 --> 2:01:13.040]  appreciate being updated we posted an article at info wars.com titled fluoride linked the number one
[2:01:13.040 --> 2:01:17.280]  cause of death and new research that being heart attacks right out of cancer you know it's linked
[2:01:17.280 --> 2:01:24.480]  to cancer too that's been admitted and then you explained a subtlety in the article the specific
[2:01:24.480 --> 2:01:31.200]  connection of fluoride to plaques in the arteries and where the author may have misunderstood the
[2:01:31.200 --> 2:01:37.520]  scientific research dr blaylock break that down for us yeah the article was misinterpreted
[2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:44.160]  this is an area of research once you're trying to find ways to scan people to see how much
[2:01:44.160 --> 2:01:48.960]  calcification they have in the coronary artery because we know that's strongly correlated to
[2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:55.440]  death from heart attack so they found that you can radio label fluoride in order to put a radioactive
[2:01:55.440 --> 2:02:01.520]  tag on the fluoride injected in the person and it'll accumulate in these calcified plaques and so
[2:02:01.520 --> 2:02:09.040]  you can see them so it's not that the fluoride by this study was causing the plaque or causing
[2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:16.240]  the calcification it's just a way to diagnostically look at it now taking it further looking at the
[2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:26.000]  research that really connects the two what we see is that fluoride avidly attaches to calcium
[2:02:26.560 --> 2:02:33.440]  and cells that make calcium so when you look at fluorosis for instance the spine will become
[2:02:33.440 --> 2:02:39.120]  so calcified so many bone spurs on it it'll crush the spinal cord and a person can compare
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:46.400]  beleaguered ligaments in the neck will become calcified and produce quadriplegia and it and
[2:02:46.400 --> 2:02:52.240]  according to the literature only fluoride overdosing can produce this condition and they've done this
[2:02:52.240 --> 2:02:55.680]  for a long long time this is one of the oldest studies the things i've seen out there so it
[2:02:55.680 --> 2:03:03.200]  basically creates just a sludge in the body and and and i guess to simplify it collects the calcium
[2:03:03.200 --> 2:03:09.520]  and things and allows it to bond together right that fluoride will bond to the calcium plaque
[2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:14.800]  well fluoride is a highly reactive metal and the studies have shown when it binds to that
[2:03:15.520 --> 2:03:21.920]  calcium plaque it produces high levels of free radical damage to the vessel wall well that's
[2:03:21.920 --> 2:03:28.560]  what produces atherosclerosis so basically what they're showing is that if you're ingesting fluoride
[2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:34.880]  it accumulates in the calcium and that makes the calcium infinitely more harmful and makes the
[2:03:34.880 --> 2:03:42.160]  atherosclerosis progress much more rapidly and extensively this has been shown in the brain
[2:03:42.160 --> 2:03:47.920]  any calcification in the brain for instance pineal gland accumulates fluoride they've
[2:03:47.920 --> 2:03:54.480]  examined pineal glands in humans and found that the levels of fluoride were 10 000 parts per million
[2:03:54.480 --> 2:04:01.280]  an enormous level of fluoride there's also a connection to excitotoxicity we know that
[2:04:01.280 --> 2:04:08.240]  excitotoxicity is occurring in the walls of these blood vessels these heart arteries and that produces
[2:04:08.240 --> 2:04:14.560]  calcification then the fluoride combines with the calcium and worsens the excitotoxicity
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:21.840]  i serve on the editorial board of the journal fluoride which is the only journal
[2:04:21.840 --> 2:04:27.760]  uh that deals with fluoride research in the world it's the fluoride uh the international
[2:04:27.760 --> 2:04:32.320]  fluoride research i tell you what dr. blalock we were intended to have you go right now you've
[2:04:32.320 --> 2:04:36.080]  got to come back i want you to finish this thought for just two minutes on the other side
[2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:41.440]  and then we'll also for the full audience give people the websites blalockwellnesscenter.com
[2:04:41.440 --> 2:04:47.440]  and valuable information blalockwellnesscenter.com and russell blalockmd.com but i want you to be
[2:04:47.440 --> 2:04:53.120]  able to finish this thought because this really is a true public service announcement the system
[2:04:53.120 --> 2:04:59.040]  has known forever that fluoride calcifies in the bones the joints the arteries everywhere
[2:05:00.880 --> 2:05:05.120]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[2:05:05.120 --> 2:05:09.600]  seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[2:05:09.600 --> 2:05:14.160]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed
[2:05:14.160 --> 2:05:18.800]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our
[2:05:18.800 --> 2:05:23.600]  friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[2:05:23.600 --> 2:05:29.520]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food

[2:08:45.520 --> 2:08:53.440]  patiently holding but i've held dr rustle blalock md uh retired brain surgeon neurologist and of
[2:08:53.440 --> 2:08:59.840]  course author and researcher uh over because he brought up some information uh dealing with the
[2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:06.320]  direct connection with heart disease all sorts of degenerative diseases of the of the spine and
[2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:13.760]  bones and hips and cartilage with fluoride that's added to the water the pineal gland but then
[2:09:13.760 --> 2:09:18.320]  and while he was talking they ran in here with a new article that just went up on info wars dot
[2:09:18.320 --> 2:09:22.720]  com and i read this during the break and he's in a comment on this before he leaves as well
[2:09:22.720 --> 2:09:29.120]  because it's exactly what he was saying 30 minutes ago when he first joined us a ma american medical
[2:09:29.120 --> 2:09:36.160]  journal that's the big and make participation in vaccine trials mandatory and it's got the link i
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:39.920]  didn't just believe paul watson's headline i went and he's one of our great writers but i went and
[2:09:39.920 --> 2:09:46.160]  clicked on it it's titled should participation in vaccine clinical trials be mandated we're talking
[2:09:46.160 --> 2:09:53.440]  about the aids vaccine all of it and they say in here the public does not trust them anymore and so
[2:09:53.440 --> 2:10:00.960]  let's just make them take it well yeah because we've gone from 1 in 25 000 with autism to 1 in 68
[2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:05.600]  because neurological disorders are off the charts and you've got direct graphs of whoever takes the
[2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:11.120]  most vaccines in the country has the highest rates of all these problems and we're talking about
[2:10:11.120 --> 2:10:17.600]  pancreas cancer we're talking about heart disease brain problems neurological disorders i mean this
[2:10:17.600 --> 2:10:22.560]  is a plague i know i'm ranting dr blalock but uh every time i get you on it just there's so many
[2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:29.120]  points this is a armageddon this is a holocaust going on and as you said during the break we're
[2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:34.160]  talking they are scared to death this validates let's cover this first then briefly get into the
[2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:40.160]  fluoride and heart disease situation but i mean this is a big deal this is exactly what you were
[2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:46.320]  just saying uh yeah it's terrifying and the public should be terrified because this is
[2:10:46.320 --> 2:10:52.880]  this sort of a national socialist idea that that hitler ran his regime under is that uh people are
[2:10:52.880 --> 2:10:59.760]  cattle uh we're the elite we're the intelligent and you just have to do it we tell you and trust us
[2:10:59.760 --> 2:11:04.960]  and if you don't trust us we'll make you do it well uh that was the eugenicist idea that's how
[2:11:04.960 --> 2:11:10.960]  they ran eugenics program and now historically we look back and we say well thousands of people were
[2:11:10.960 --> 2:11:18.800]  ruined uh and and we were wrong well that's why you don't give elitists that much power and these
[2:11:18.800 --> 2:11:24.720]  people are saying well parents are stupid uh doctors that disagree are stupid the researchers
[2:11:24.720 --> 2:11:29.760]  that disagree are stupid and we just have to make them do it against their will we'll take their
[2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:36.640]  children away and we'll give them non-vaccines and uh you know 10 years from now when all of this is
[2:11:36.640 --> 2:11:43.040]  proven they'll say well we just didn't know at the time well that doesn't do 10 million 20 million
[2:11:43.040 --> 2:11:49.520]  people uh any good because their children were destroyed their lives were destroyed it cost this
[2:11:49.520 --> 2:11:55.040]  nation hundreds of billions of dollars in health care uh that they come back and say well we made
[2:11:55.040 --> 2:12:01.440]  a mistake uh that's why you don't allow them to force people to do things when i was treating
[2:12:01.440 --> 2:12:06.320]  patients i didn't force them to have surgery that i thought they should have that was their decision
[2:12:07.120 --> 2:12:11.600]  i didn't force them to take medications they didn't want to take i just told them what i
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:17.840]  knew uh to be the possible facts and and they figured it out that's that's why we're individuals
[2:12:17.840 --> 2:12:24.320]  uh in this country and we have freedom uh we don't have elites that dictate to us that we're
[2:12:24.320 --> 2:12:29.840]  going to follow their plan and that leads us into another area as you said here two years ago and
[2:12:29.840 --> 2:12:35.200]  they said it can never happen it's law we now see physicians quitting and drugs going bankrupt
[2:12:35.200 --> 2:12:40.160]  they're being told what treatments they can give people we're seeing them now saying well if somebody
[2:12:40.160 --> 2:12:45.280]  has got a low IQ and they're 10 years old they don't get that kidney transplant even though we've
[2:12:45.280 --> 2:12:50.400]  got it uh we see bill gates saying yeah don't give an old lady treatment hire 10 teachers
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:55.200]  they're now admitting death panels they're now admitting government control of medicine
[2:12:56.480 --> 2:13:02.080]  well when i analyzed the obama health care bill when it first came out i told people every bit of
[2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:08.400]  this uh and all the nice sayers oh that's not what they mean well now it's obvious it is what they
[2:13:08.400 --> 2:13:13.760]  mean it's obvious it's in these bills it's obvious physicians are not going to have any choice about
[2:13:13.760 --> 2:13:18.240]  treatment they're going to be told what to do if they don't do it they're going to take their license
[2:13:18.240 --> 2:13:23.120]  away and i'll tell you what's coming is a federal medical license so if you're going they're going
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:28.000]  to take it away from states you will get a federal medical license if you don't do what they say you
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:35.360]  cannot practice anywhere in the united states wow it is just tyranny at mock 10 at every level in
[2:13:35.360 --> 2:13:41.360]  closing um blalock wellness center dot com russell blalock md dot com two different sides
[2:13:41.360 --> 2:13:47.200]  incredible information invaluable you want the real research from a real expert these are the
[2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:56.400]  sites on so many uh issues uh in closing of fluoride and its connection to heart disease and other
[2:13:56.400 --> 2:14:03.120]  ailments well one thing they know fluoride is highly reacted with aluminum it forms an aluminum
[2:14:03.120 --> 2:14:10.720]  fluoride complex that is powerfully brain damaging and powerfully aggravates atherosclerosis
[2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:17.440]  and it does so at 0.5 parts per million that's half of what's in the water they also put aluminum
[2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:24.560]  in all drinking water so you have aluminum fluoride in your water and we have all the people in 75
[2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:31.440]  percent of the country drinking aluminum fluoride every day and our research says it is a powerful
[2:14:31.440 --> 2:14:38.160]  brain toxin and is strongly linked to atherosclerosis so you can look at this research yourself
[2:14:38.160 --> 2:14:43.360]  uh it's extensive and we wonder why we lead the world now in neurological disorders and heart
[2:14:43.360 --> 2:14:48.960]  disease uh and you said before the break for those that just joined us it just it vines with the
[2:14:48.960 --> 2:14:55.280]  calcium and just clogs the arteries up yes highly reactive it's producing a combination
[2:14:55.280 --> 2:15:01.680]  that produces intense free radical generation lipid peroxidation which is what causes the artery
[2:15:01.680 --> 2:15:08.080]  to close off and kills you in a heart attack or stroke so we know that and their answer is i'm
[2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:13.280]  sure you've seen this in the news put statins in the water make five-year-olds take statin pills
[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:17.920]  and now they're talking about lithium in the water uh so the troops don't commit suicide i mean it's
[2:15:17.920 --> 2:15:24.000]  like we woke up in the twilight zone doctor well once you once you legitimize putting fluoride
[2:15:24.000 --> 2:15:29.440]  in the water we're in cavities that open it up to every drug uh so now we could put tranquilizers
[2:15:29.440 --> 2:15:34.400]  we could put mind-altering drugs we can put everything into the water supply uh you know i
[2:15:34.400 --> 2:15:38.960]  can't prescribe a statin drug without explaining all the complications well if you put it in water
[2:15:38.960 --> 2:15:43.280]  supply how you're going to explain the complications to everybody who drinks their water and that's
[2:15:43.280 --> 2:15:47.440]  another subject with statins due to the brain we'll have to have you back up again play like
[2:15:47.440 --> 2:15:52.800]  wellnesscenter.com russellblaylockmd.com god bless you doc great job and uh you got to feel
[2:15:52.800 --> 2:15:56.880]  vindicated because i know you've been criticized nationally and just everything you keep talking
[2:15:56.880 --> 2:16:02.640]  about is just being verified i have sky news that's fox out of england uh with the headline
[2:16:02.640 --> 2:16:09.360]  that you know top scientists now recognize uh that the flu vaccines actually hurting people i mean
[2:16:09.360 --> 2:16:14.240]  it's all coming out i wonder what's going to happen to all the pushers of this who knew this
[2:16:14.960 --> 2:16:18.960]  we know from the documents the cdc and others where it all comes out i mean i think they
[2:16:18.960 --> 2:16:24.640]  should be held responsible oh they should be in prison i mean they they destroyed the lives
[2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:30.400]  of tens of millions of people they should pay for it with criminal penalties i have one more
[2:16:30.400 --> 2:16:36.000]  questions i never asked you this well how did you start to wake up to all this stuff well i was
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:41.840]  like most physicians say 30 years ago i believed all this stuff i thought vaccines were safe but
[2:16:41.840 --> 2:16:46.320]  i was very interested in nutrition the more i dug into it the more i got into the actual
[2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:52.480]  mechanism of disease and learned that a very intimate molecular biology of disease i i discovered
[2:16:52.480 --> 2:16:57.920]  all these things and i know how vaccines work i know what they do to the brain i know about
[2:16:57.920 --> 2:17:03.760]  how the brain is formed what affects uh constant immune stimulation to have on the developing
[2:17:03.760 --> 2:17:10.320]  brain the adult brain and the linked uh Alzheimer's Parkinson's uh so it just opened up a lot of doors
[2:17:10.320 --> 2:17:15.360]  and and and clarify these things most physicians don't know this they don't look at this research
[2:17:16.400 --> 2:17:20.080]  so this this is new to them they've never heard of it and now they're trying to bring
[2:17:20.080 --> 2:17:23.840]  a new federal dark age where you're not even allowed to look at this basically you just do
[2:17:23.840 --> 2:17:28.560]  what the federal computer tells you dr. blalock talk to you again soon thank you thank you god
[2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:34.320]  bless you god bless you that was an amazing interview and powerful and folks the bible says
[2:17:34.320 --> 2:17:40.080]  the people perish for lack of knowledge you need to get this information out to your son your
[2:17:40.080 --> 2:17:44.080]  daughter who are about to have a child you need to get it out to your family you need to get it
[2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:49.360]  out to grandma who's drinking that city tap water you need to get this information out to people
[2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:56.720]  my total desire is not to make money not to be famous it's fine to have enough money to be comfortable
[2:17:56.720 --> 2:18:02.880]  and not have my car break down and the kids can have new shoes but on my hierarchy of needs that's
[2:18:02.880 --> 2:18:12.240]  not what's important my desire what i'm going for what makes me tick is that i'm freaked out by
[2:18:12.240 --> 2:18:17.680]  watching our cancer rate go to number one and explode off the chart and every other degenerative
[2:18:17.680 --> 2:18:23.440]  type thing i mean we're dying i mean this is a holocaust going on right now a soft kill holocaust
[2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:33.520]  and people call me goody two shoes or or a hero for a hero i mean if i knew my neighbor was about
[2:18:33.520 --> 2:18:39.120]  to you know do something on their roof and they were gonna get electrocuted i'd tell them i mean
[2:18:39.120 --> 2:18:47.200]  it's not folks it's not heroic it's normal human instinct when you're watching all this horrible
[2:18:47.200 --> 2:18:51.680]  it's normal if you see a little kid who gets out the back door or whatever because mom's asleep
[2:18:51.680 --> 2:18:56.320]  they're about to walk out in front of a train to run up and grab them that's not heroic that's not
[2:18:56.880 --> 2:19:02.880]  that's not special but dr. blalox is he's a good guy but only because he'll go up against the pressure
[2:19:03.440 --> 2:19:09.920]  and and and being demonized but i mean i wouldn't say he's a hero i don't think he would say he's a
[2:19:09.920 --> 2:19:16.640]  hero and the reason i point out that we're not heroes is it's not extraordinary to be informed
[2:19:16.640 --> 2:19:21.360]  it shouldn't be it's not extraordinary to reach out to people and warn them it's not
[2:19:21.360 --> 2:19:26.080]  extraordinary to learn about science it's interesting people like oh that's boring the public
[2:19:26.080 --> 2:19:33.600]  school system makes it boring on purpose this is on record so you don't get the the the bug of
[2:19:33.600 --> 2:19:42.880]  creativity and inquisitiveness it's addicting to become knowledgeable about world systems it's
[2:19:42.880 --> 2:19:50.000]  addicting warning people and and then you learn you have power you learn that the only thing that
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:54.320]  evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing okay i promise
[2:19:54.320 --> 2:20:00.000]  we're going right to your calls bam bam bam on the other side then big news blitz coming up today

[2:25:00.320 --> 2:25:05.840]  who they gave the money to you give the bankers money and then you're in debt to the bankers
[2:25:05.840 --> 2:25:12.320]  because you bailed them out that's what happens when banksters run your economy you can't make
[2:25:12.320 --> 2:25:17.360]  up this weirdness greg in new york then ed michael greg and scott greg you're on the air welcome

[2:25:22.480 --> 2:25:30.000]  yes sir my son introduced you in my first time caller and uh he was telling about hr 3166 yes
[2:25:30.960 --> 2:25:36.960]  yeah that worries me completely um i actually i call a senator from new york state here in
[2:25:36.960 --> 2:25:44.400]  aster her name is hillard uh hillibrand and uh her secretary answered the phone and said
[2:25:44.400 --> 2:25:47.920]  that you tell me about that yeah you need to talk right into your telephone because you were
[2:25:47.920 --> 2:25:53.600]  breaking up there just just talk right into the receiver uh you uh you you talked to who
[2:25:54.320 --> 2:25:59.280]  the one of the secretaries there from her senator office and she didn't know nothing about the bill
[2:25:59.280 --> 2:26:02.880]  she's like i'm sorry i can't i don't know nothing about the bill you have to contact a
[2:26:02.880 --> 2:26:07.600]  different number and but we don't know nothing about the bill now you're talking about the bill
[2:26:07.600 --> 2:26:14.720]  to basically throw you in prison if you don't uh if you don't uh you'll pay all your credit card
[2:26:14.720 --> 2:26:20.320]  debts that are impossible to pay well basically your citizenship being taken away and it's
[2:26:20.320 --> 2:26:27.760]  where my citizenship has been taken away right she's well but sir you said hr 3156 uh there is the
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:33.200]  act uh to to strip citizens and it may be in a of a similar number that they're trying to pass
[2:26:33.200 --> 2:26:38.000]  yeah where they say well we can secretly arrest citizens if we want we can also just strip your
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:44.960]  citizenship and take you to one of our secret prisons somewhere uh yes uh that uh that act
[2:26:44.960 --> 2:26:49.360]  is also moving through congress okay so the other thing is through that really bothers me
[2:26:49.360 --> 2:26:55.440]  1.2 trillion dollar ceiling just been passed hopefully not today but they're talking 1.2 trillion
[2:26:55.440 --> 2:27:04.480]  in debt on top of what we all know but you've got to understand the the 15.14 trillion is a
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:17.120]  it is a big uh chunk of change but remember last time i checked 16 trillion to one federal reserve
[2:27:17.120 --> 2:27:22.000]  group tens of trillions more on top of that it's 27 plus trillion total and we haven't
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:28.800]  gotten numbers in over a year to the bankers in bailouts okay so so they're always telling
[2:27:28.800 --> 2:27:35.360]  countries about oh you've got this big debt but really that big debt uh is nothing the reason
[2:27:35.360 --> 2:27:40.800]  we're in debt and they're raising taxes is because we've signed on to the banksters derivatives
[2:27:40.800 --> 2:27:46.640]  garbage ponzi scam i appreciate your call interesting points uh let's go to michael in

[2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:45.520]  listeners can get it wrong i can get it wrong and then you know somebody gets a 200 phone calls
[2:33:45.520 --> 2:33:49.840]  but i'm always happy for people to plug websites the problem is then everybody lines up
[2:33:49.840 --> 2:33:54.560]  to call in just to plug stuff and then it becomes more like a swap meet show or something
[2:33:54.560 --> 2:33:58.080]  i used to be so in lenient years ago people would call in and say i got a tractor for sale
[2:33:58.080 --> 2:34:02.880]  and i was like are you kidding they're like yeah no yeah i said this isn't some saturday morning

[2:34:23.200 --> 2:34:28.240]  we're protesting at the federal building the federal courthouse for a number of reasons mainly
[2:34:28.240 --> 2:34:34.960]  the federal reserve system being federal and then the second reason is the federal court system the
[2:34:34.960 --> 2:34:42.480]  u.s supreme court that handed the decision down citizens united which gives unlimited monetary
[2:34:42.480 --> 2:34:48.320]  power to the corporations to donate to their political prostitute of their choice that's right
[2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:54.160]  they restrict the individual giving money but but but even let foreigners basically fence the money
[2:34:54.160 --> 2:34:59.680]  through and do that so so briefly what time and where is it that's right and i just wanted everybody
[2:34:59.680 --> 2:35:06.160]  to remember too columbus ohio is the city where the united nations met the one time only they met
[2:35:06.160 --> 2:35:13.040]  out of new york they met in columbus ohio so uh just keep that in mind it's the city of the beast

[2:38:31.840 --> 2:38:36.080]  you know keep you on air to make sure we get to talk to you but i know the network sometimes says
[2:38:36.080 --> 2:38:40.960]  i have the biggest long-distance bill of any host because most people just take calls as they come
[2:38:40.960 --> 2:38:45.680]  in it's like we have a guest but the guest the guest is going to hold ron paul is going to hold

[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:24.480]  always people chasing off robbers or shooting people and um listen i probably see we should
[2:39:24.480 --> 2:39:29.280]  have a segment every day on the radio or at least on the nightly news where people defend themselves
[2:39:29.280 --> 2:39:34.480]  we know it's 20 something times people frustrate crime for every time a gun gets used in a crime
[2:39:34.480 --> 2:39:40.480]  but i mean they're just blasting home invaders everywhere and the corporate media dinosaur
[2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:46.080]  always criticizes it like should this old man have shot the armed robbers police are looking at
[2:39:46.080 --> 2:39:50.800]  arresting him they're always trying to imply it's wrong because they don't want you to understand
[2:39:50.800 --> 2:39:57.120]  that only you can protect yourself sorry go ahead well at least our local news they back us up pretty

[2:41:46.080 --> 2:41:51.840]  it's been going on for decades so you know little things just little things one little thing wakes
[2:41:51.840 --> 2:41:56.080]  someone up and leads them to where you're at i mean you're full of so much information that
[2:41:56.640 --> 2:42:01.120]  when you when you when you rest that on somebody they're going oh my god you know but so we got
[2:42:01.120 --> 2:42:06.640]  to start them small which does work but here's here's what i wanted to get to i had a customer in
[2:42:06.640 --> 2:42:12.240]  09 that had told me she she works for the secret service here in arizona and what she had mentioned
[2:42:12.240 --> 2:42:18.000]  to me was generally when they're assigned to uh one of the candidates it's usually uh april of
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:24.400]  may of the of the year of the vote basically but she said what happened was obama was assigned
[2:42:24.960 --> 2:42:30.560]  secret service in 07 and she said we knew then he was the next president none of us here like the
[2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:37.440]  man and the other thing i'm going to get to is uh my my nephew who is stationed in san diego he
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:44.400]  says the ceo's keep talking to him about turning their guns on the american citizens which these
[2:42:44.400 --> 2:42:51.600]  guys in the platoons refuse to do so so my thought and another thought i'm sorry i'm spitting this
[2:42:51.600 --> 2:42:57.280]  all out i've got i'm just like you i got a lot of things in my mind but what i've noticed is the gop
[2:42:58.560 --> 2:43:05.600]  the gop is is is uh definitely afraid of ron paul going third party which means
[2:43:05.600 --> 2:43:12.000]  the ron paul supporters in this country we have more power than than we know and this is what they're
[2:43:12.000 --> 2:43:17.840]  afraid of it's a lot of the ron paul supporters that i've talked to said it's either ron paul or
[2:43:17.840 --> 2:43:24.560]  no vote at all which means obama will get it again so the fact is the gop needs to come to our side
[2:43:24.560 --> 2:43:29.920]  and realize this that we you're right but the problem is we've got an article on info wars.com
[2:43:29.920 --> 2:43:38.880]  today bane capitol now the drudge report's also got a story on it bane capitol its top guy has gone
[2:43:38.880 --> 2:43:45.200]  to work for obama i mean look at huntsman who worked with obama uh you know that's the problem
[2:43:45.200 --> 2:43:52.080]  obama is terrible but he's a puppet and mit romney is a puppet but when mit romney gets in you watch
[2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:58.640]  so many libertarians and conservatives will give into it because oh he's got an r before his name
[2:43:58.640 --> 2:44:03.360]  and let's face it not that they're really racist it's just that you know he's a white guy and he
[2:44:03.360 --> 2:44:08.800]  looks like a kindle so you know he talks like a fatherly person it must be okay in fact we have that
[2:44:08.800 --> 2:44:13.360]  mit romney video comparing him to hitler because you have you have been able to read the german i'll
[2:44:13.360 --> 2:44:19.360]  i'll actually read the subtitle of what hitler's saying to break it down but the issue is will they
[2:44:19.360 --> 2:44:24.800]  totally go to sleep once mit romney gets in and i think he's a ringer i think it will be obama
[2:44:24.800 --> 2:44:29.360]  if mit romney is the i mean but again things don't always go the way they want it i talked to high
[2:44:29.360 --> 2:44:34.640]  level republican operatives who told me you know two three years ago you watch the front runner
[2:44:34.640 --> 2:44:38.960]  they're going to compare him to reagan is going to be rick perry and he went to front runner
[2:44:38.960 --> 2:44:44.480]  they compared him to reagan he couldn't lose but people aren't playing the old ball game they kind
[2:44:44.480 --> 2:44:50.000]  of woke up well he went to bill deberg he supports forced inoculation he supported nap the super
[2:44:50.000 --> 2:44:55.760]  highway uh you know he does all this well we don't like him and so then they woke up to newt
[2:44:55.760 --> 2:45:02.000]  genrich being bad i saw sarah palin endorse newt genrich today i mean if that doesn't discredit her
[2:45:02.000 --> 2:45:09.520]  forever i mean listen newt folks newt genrich carbon taxes open borders i mean the list goes on and on
[2:45:10.560 --> 2:45:17.360]  so so it's just it's super bad news and i hear you and i appreciate your point i really i really
[2:45:17.360 --> 2:45:22.640]  hear what you're saying i have told ron paul on and off air that i think you should run third party
[2:45:23.920 --> 2:45:30.240]  he understands though that if that causes obama to get in they will forever demonize campaign for
[2:45:30.240 --> 2:45:37.280]  liberty they will and say they did that but but my issue is it's all coming to a head right now
[2:45:37.280 --> 2:45:42.320]  anyways and yeah they've got an electoral strategy to get ron paul type libertarians
[2:45:42.320 --> 2:45:46.000]  elected everywhere as republicans across the country and it's starting to happen
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:50.320]  they're sending quite a few new people to congress and it's building and ron paul's they're
[2:45:50.320 --> 2:45:54.480]  kind of hitting the bar bar for everybody win lose or draw we win and he knows that and he said that
[2:45:55.680 --> 2:46:01.120]  i've explained to you the private strategy years ago now ron paul's public about it people understand
[2:46:01.120 --> 2:46:11.600]  that and it's just that if they lock him out with fraud in florida under states they will say the
[2:46:11.600 --> 2:46:17.040]  prompt the the presumptive guy is mit romney even though ron paul has gained the last week
[2:46:17.040 --> 2:46:22.400]  under five points in in several national polls i mean he's gaining on romney and as people learn
[2:46:22.400 --> 2:46:30.720]  about romney it's over for him it's over so right now in the next month or two we've got a turbo charge
[2:46:30.720 --> 2:46:35.760]  to push ron paul right up beneath romney despite all their statements that he can't win he's in
[2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:41.600]  second place and gaining in the worst race and again that shows how discredited the corporate
[2:46:41.600 --> 2:46:49.520]  dinosaur prostitute media is and i'm telling you uh if ron paul ran third party clearly as a way to
[2:46:49.520 --> 2:46:57.760]  educate people and to really go after democrats as well it would pull from both uh and and i
[2:46:57.760 --> 2:47:03.280]  in my gut know it's the right thing to do he probably won't do it just because he's got the
[2:47:03.280 --> 2:47:07.600]  the campaign for liberty strategy to get people elected through the system which is a great strategy
[2:47:08.560 --> 2:47:17.040]  um and ron paul probably won't run third party folks uh but uh i say all in because you know we
[2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:23.920]  need to continue shoving ron paul out there in front of everybody because then people see the
[2:47:23.920 --> 2:47:29.440]  alternative and it pulls the curtain back on the wizard of os it it it's a game changer
[2:47:29.440 --> 2:47:36.080]  because the system is so ridiculously corrupt just calling them just getting on the field they
[2:47:36.080 --> 2:47:41.840]  fold and all hades is about to break loose ron paul is surging because everything he's talked
[2:47:41.840 --> 2:47:47.360]  about is coming true wait till it all comes true they're gonna have to shut the web down and arrest
[2:47:47.360 --> 2:47:52.960]  alex jones when when if they go forward with this new world order because my credibility will be so
[2:47:52.960 --> 2:47:58.800]  high i'm gonna be the biggest thing in this country folks you think ron paul's big after ron paul who
[2:47:58.800 --> 2:48:04.720]  is their alex jones ron paul uh what andrew paul tano got a nice show on fox business about 100
[2:48:04.720 --> 2:48:09.920]  thousand viewers i got 15 million folks i got one youtube channel with about three million viewers
[2:48:09.920 --> 2:48:14.400]  a week i'm gonna shoot a video right now and a million people will watch it i got 15 million
[2:48:14.400 --> 2:48:20.160]  viewers a week i mean we're the big dog in town folks and the system knows that they're not gonna
[2:48:20.160 --> 2:48:24.960]  let us operate if this goes forward this is serious they won't let us operate because we're cleaning
[2:48:24.960 --> 2:48:30.400]  their clock let's let's go to this mitt romney clip here it is this is a vote for mitt romney's
[2:48:30.400 --> 2:48:37.760]  a vote for the uh new world order and uh here it is how late it is i believe that abortion should be
[2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:42.400]  safe and let's start that over and let's skip the break let's uh let's start that clip over because
[2:48:42.400 --> 2:48:48.320]  it doesn't make sense without the without the intro on it uh we're gonna recue uh we're gonna skip this
[2:48:48.320 --> 2:48:54.240]  network break here this information is too important uh this exposes mitt romney uh and it's
[2:48:54.240 --> 2:48:59.440]  it's it's up on the youtube channel we got it uploaded three times and uh i guess the others
[2:48:59.440 --> 2:49:03.760]  were eras but it's it's up there now on the youtube channel it's not on the front page info wars
[2:49:03.760 --> 2:49:08.960]  that's been a dead video since yesterday in the featured video area uh but uh here's the video
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:14.000]  we're gonna get it out one way or the other this is a vote for mitt romney is a vote for the new
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:21.360]  world order and it's got hitler in it and i'm going to uh read uh over uh the german uh
[2:49:21.360 --> 2:49:24.400]  um subtitles here they're in english here it is
[2:49:32.400 --> 2:49:36.640]  i believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country i have since the time
[2:49:36.640 --> 2:49:42.080]  that my mom took that position when she ran in 1970 as a u.s. senate candidate i believe that
[2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:46.960]  since rovie wade has been the law for 20 years that we should sustain and support it and i
[2:49:46.960 --> 2:49:52.400]  sustained right there that law let's start it over again great job guys uh again this is
[2:49:52.400 --> 2:49:58.880]  mitt romney and you can find him voting on the bills supporting governments paid for abortion
[2:49:59.440 --> 2:50:03.120]  i mean he might as well be the director of plan parenthood that this is the fruits of the tree
[2:50:03.920 --> 2:50:07.920]  and you know he's got rotten demonic apples hanging off of him and now he says oh i'm all for
[2:50:07.920 --> 2:50:13.760]  the unborn i want to get rid of rovie wade and whether you're for it or against it he's a liar
[2:50:13.760 --> 2:50:22.080]  just like obama he's a liar now he's against open borders the guy's totally for amnesty
[2:50:22.080 --> 2:50:28.720]  carbon taxes abortion gun control i mean he is a stinking new world order piece of trash
[2:50:29.920 --> 2:50:35.840]  by the way he admits he pays 15 taxes you know i pay uh just federal if you counter all together
[2:50:35.840 --> 2:50:41.760]  about 40 percent let's see the big rich guys they've gotten all the laws written where they're
[2:50:41.760 --> 2:50:47.520]  pretty much exempt you know google and general motors and all and they pay zero and they get
[2:50:47.520 --> 2:50:56.000]  taxpayer money general motors so so so so so let's go back uh to to this bobblehead
[2:50:58.160 --> 2:51:09.120]  that conservatives in a poll i saw a few days ago rasmussen they think they think he's the one
[2:51:09.120 --> 2:51:13.680]  who represents him this is the big conservative for them and and they said ron paul isn't the
[2:51:13.680 --> 2:51:18.560]  conservative i mean that's like saying george washington isn't the conservative they want to
[2:51:18.560 --> 2:51:24.560]  elect mouse satan because he is i mean this is the mindlessness of the mainline drooling
[2:51:24.560 --> 2:51:32.320]  conservative who listens to talk radio owned by bane capitol most the big host uh who will not tell
[2:51:32.320 --> 2:51:38.240]  you about mitt romney of her life dependent on it because he owns them let's go ahead and go to the
[2:51:38.240 --> 2:51:43.920]  club i believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country i have since the time that
[2:51:43.920 --> 2:51:49.840]  my mom took that position when she ran in 1970 as a u.s. senate candidate i believe that since roe v
[2:51:49.840 --> 2:51:55.280]  wade has been the law for 20 years that we should sustain and support it and i sustain and support
[2:51:55.280 --> 2:52:01.120]  that law and the right of a woman to make that choice um but i believe the world is getting warmer
[2:52:01.680 --> 2:52:06.240]  i i i can't prove that uh but i believe based on what i read that the world world is getting
[2:52:06.240 --> 2:52:12.960]  warmer hit pause no you want carbon taxes because big hedge funds are all supporting it because you
[2:52:12.960 --> 2:52:19.920]  get to rob people at every level and pay it into your coffers and in a global tax a global consumption
[2:52:19.920 --> 2:52:24.800]  tax i mean right here in austin they said your power rate's going up 80 on average it's for the earth
[2:52:24.800 --> 2:52:29.200]  of course it goes to direct cartels that use government to shut down their competition
[2:52:29.200 --> 2:52:33.200]  but they just get up and wave a magic wand and say for the earth and the hippies and all the
[2:52:33.200 --> 2:52:38.720]  trendies just fall down and say gang rapists and the majority of austinites say hey we don't want
[2:52:38.720 --> 2:52:43.600]  this and the city just says hey we have electronic fraud i've proven it at the state level state
[2:52:43.600 --> 2:52:48.480]  certification level they said there's fraud but it's elections go forward i'm just totally ruled
[2:52:48.480 --> 2:52:54.160]  in this town by a bunch of scum and that little scumbag mitt romney is going to sit up there
[2:52:55.360 --> 2:52:59.520]  and you know where's the Mormon church decrying him on his abortion loving
[2:52:59.520 --> 2:53:05.840]  i mean you know i don't get up here and bash Mormons or other affiliated you know christian
[2:53:05.840 --> 2:53:09.840]  groups or whatever but i mean the Mormons say they're against abortion well you need to decry
[2:53:09.840 --> 2:53:17.280]  this little devil then oh but now he says now he says he's against abortion i'll tell you there's
[2:53:17.280 --> 2:53:22.400]  no end to it let's go back to him number two i believe that humans contribute to that governor
[2:53:22.400 --> 2:53:27.520]  romney as president would you have signed the national defense act as written yes i would have
[2:53:27.520 --> 2:53:35.760]  and i do believe that it's appropriate to have in in our nation the capacity to detain people
[2:53:36.480 --> 2:53:44.000]  who who are threats to this country who are members of al Qaeda stop right there this is so
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:48.320]  important back up to the beginning of the global warming part again please notice you know because
[2:53:48.320 --> 2:53:52.560]  in the full clip he's asked will you support carbon taxes and all this and he says well
[2:53:52.560 --> 2:53:57.120]  think the war it's getting warmer and i do think humans are doing it so you just go ahead and pay me
[2:53:57.120 --> 2:54:07.840]  mr big banker that money and it's just all a big sick joke and and and again how do you get
[2:54:07.840 --> 2:54:15.200]  conservatives to elect an an abortion loving open border promoting carbon taxing obama care
[2:54:15.200 --> 2:54:22.080]  writing sniveling weirdo you know there's lots of people that look like a nice pastor who got
[2:54:22.080 --> 2:54:25.920]  dead bodies in the basement you know that's so many women getting the car with guys that look like
[2:54:25.920 --> 2:54:32.800]  mint romney because he's clean cutting a suit and just like obama you get in the car with another
[2:54:32.800 --> 2:54:40.480]  lying sack of garbage and i don't want to hear any so-called republican conservatives ever
[2:54:40.480 --> 2:54:47.360]  criticize obama bought idiots oh thank you president i'm gonna have free cars and housing
[2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:51.760]  and everything my problems are all solved did your problems get solved did the government
[2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:57.840]  take good care of you did he did he deliver everything you want and it goes into a hitler
[2:54:57.840 --> 2:55:02.160]  clip that that's similar to basically what what romney's saying she's like i want to be able to
[2:55:02.160 --> 2:55:07.600]  detain terrorists no this is citizens indefinitely forever with no charges and no one knows where
[2:55:07.600 --> 2:55:14.320]  you went but but let's go back to the clip sir this is mint romney here it is um but i believe
[2:55:14.320 --> 2:55:19.520]  the world is getting warmer i i i can't prove that uh but i believe based on what i read that the
[2:55:19.520 --> 2:55:23.760]  world world is getting warmer uh and number two i believe that humans contribute to that
[2:55:24.480 --> 2:55:28.880]  governor romney as president would you have signed the national defense act as written
[2:55:28.880 --> 2:55:31.360]  yes i would have and i do believe that it's appropriate
[2:55:33.040 --> 2:55:40.240]  it's a problem i'm real madly in in our nation the capacity to detain people who who are threats
[2:55:40.240 --> 2:55:48.800]  to this country who are members of alcatel here's hitler hitler so well i and so will we all hitler
[2:55:48.800 --> 2:55:53.440]  toil and work for the resurrection of the german nation he'll fix it
[2:55:57.440 --> 2:56:05.920]  people of germany give us four years and i swear that as i took office so i will leave it
[2:56:05.920 --> 2:56:15.600]  i did it not for reward i did it for you there's meant romney
[2:56:17.200 --> 2:56:22.240]  internationally president obama has adopted an appeasement strategy he believes america's role
[2:56:22.240 --> 2:56:26.720]  as leader in the world is a thing of the past no he's warmongering everywhere america must
[2:56:26.720 --> 2:56:32.320]  and will lead the future he doesn't see the need for overwhelming american military superiority
[2:56:32.320 --> 2:56:36.880]  i will insist on the military so powerful no one would ever think of challenging it
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:45.120]  there's like this weird so this is how liberty does with a nurse applause
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:50.000]  there's like this weird thing with american men and and and others around the world where
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:55.040]  they think a big military is like part of their power they're like we need the biggest military
[2:56:55.040 --> 2:57:00.480]  this isn't your military this military works for the foreign banks that robbed and took this
[2:57:00.480 --> 2:57:06.080]  country by fraud and force i mean they're publicly now telling you what i told you more than a decade
[2:57:06.080 --> 2:57:11.680]  ago they're training the entire military to wage war on you bubba jack the targets they're shooting
[2:57:11.680 --> 2:57:18.560]  are wearing john deer hats literally and you better get that through your brain real quick i can
[2:57:18.560 --> 2:57:24.240]  show the new york times where they're training to take on disgruntled vets and training ugon groups
[2:57:24.240 --> 2:57:30.960]  to do it youth groups national security forces telescreens going up everywhere saying spy on your
[2:57:30.960 --> 2:57:40.240]  neighbors literally all over the u.s it's not just in uh in chicago or new york they're putting
[2:57:40.240 --> 2:57:45.600]  in body scanners on the streets mobile trucks i read you that earlier i mean it's all coming
[2:57:46.480 --> 2:57:51.120]  and let me tell you something in the future if we don't stand up to this now they're going to get
[2:57:51.120 --> 2:57:54.880]  the sheep and go along with this and when you and when they pull you over and want to take your child
