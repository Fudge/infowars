[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[00:05.000 --> 00:11.000]  Came in last night at half past ten That baby of mine wouldn't let me in
[00:11.000 --> 00:17.000]  So move it on over, move it on over Move it on over, move it on over
[00:17.000 --> 00:22.000]  Move over little dog, cause the big dog's moving in
[00:22.000 --> 00:28.000]  She's changed the lock on our front door My door key don't fit no more
[00:28.000 --> 00:31.000]  So get it on over, move it on over
[00:31.000 --> 00:37.000]  Scoot it on over, move it on over Move over skinny dog, cause the fat dog's moving
[00:37.000 --> 00:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that there is a massive move to bully the American people
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.000]  and our president into submission of the globalist agenda
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  and they've shown that there is no end to how much they will ratchet this up
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  and how much social discord, how much violence they will push
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  I have got CNN, MSNBC, clips, so many
[01:03.000 --> 01:07.000]  I'm not even playing them every day just because there's too many
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  but we are going to play some of them today where they are legitimizing violence
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  saying go out, get violent and they've got congressmen, senators on TV saying
[01:15.000 --> 01:22.000]  Trump's always been a racist, we have the proof, he's KKK with no proof
[01:22.000 --> 01:29.000]  Next level lying hysteria and corporate businesses all over are sending out of their email list
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  all sorts of weird made up rumors about Trump and racist and how Nazis are hiding under every corner
[01:35.000 --> 01:42.000]  and then their own mentally ill constituents, customers are then running out
[01:42.000 --> 01:49.000]  and stabbing white people and shooting white people because they have short hair or blonde hair
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.000]  it's in the news every day
[01:52.000 --> 01:56.000]  now obviously we are going to go over all this today
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  they've introduced legislation to forcibly psychologically test the president
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.000]  all of this is again to unseat the election of the American people
[02:05.000 --> 02:09.000]  all of this is an attempt to say you are mentally ill
[02:09.000 --> 02:15.000]  all of this is an attempt to say that you are the enemy and you are the problem
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.000]  and then you go look at the constituency of the average democrat now
[02:21.000 --> 02:33.000]  and it is the most sad group of people, of ne'er-do-wells, of losers, of lost people
[02:33.000 --> 02:37.000]  and that doesn't mean we even like the republicans
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  but if you go look at a democratic party rally or event
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  it's like they've been run over a car a couple times
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  they look soulless, the mental illness rates, the neurotic behavior
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  they're making chirping noises
[02:53.000 --> 03:00.000]  I mean it is a group of people that make the cast of the monsters look normal
[03:00.000 --> 03:04.000]  and they are completely lost, they are completely freaked out
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.000]  and they are just threatened by culture in general and they want to bully full control of it
[03:10.000 --> 03:18.000]  and I know you know that but this free society has produced a bunch of third, fourth generation
[03:18.000 --> 03:21.000]  spoiled, rotten, desperate, crazy people
[03:21.000 --> 03:28.000]  and they are being played like a strativarius by the establishment
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  and it's again in the WikiLeaks and in the statements
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.000]  it is just incredible to be caught between the vicious sociopathic, psychopathic
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  monocracy globalist, psych warfare experts
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.000]  and then giant unwashed masses
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  and because we won't euthanize them, because we won't kill them
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  the eugenicists are using them and preparing them as lemming armies
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  to run over us and they want to genocide us in an act of coming of age
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  so our Christian ethos to not annihilate these people
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  is being used by the very eugenicists
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  who every time I talk to a globalist, high level, off record
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  they say, Alex, they are going to tear you apart, they are animals, join us
[04:15.000 --> 04:20.000]  help affect things from the inside, we've got to have an orderly extermination of these people
[04:20.000 --> 04:26.000]  and then I go, but that's evil and that will blow back on everybody
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  and we can try to lift them up, they are like, nope, the decision has been made
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  and you will just be destroyed with them if you don't join us
[04:32.000 --> 04:37.000]  and then I go out and see the public and they want to kill me
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  in love to Sirius
[04:40.000 --> 04:46.000]  and they just make jokes and gibber at me and then roll around in their ugliness
[04:46.000 --> 04:50.000]  and then just absolutely throw it back in my face
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  and say, no, no, no, we are going to kill you
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  We are going to kill you
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  The concentration of power, the excess of power
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  was always the chief concern of the founders of this country
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  it was why the anti-fiddleists opposed the constitution
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.000]  they believed they put safeguards in the constitution to abuse that concentration of power
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  but as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing
[05:51.000 --> 05:57.000]  the real constraints upon them are only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions
[05:57.000 --> 06:22.000]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight

[08:21.000 --> 08:28.000]  The rulers of this earth are hell bent to enslaving and dominating the human spirit
[08:28.000 --> 08:34.000]  Controlling free will and stealing the gift that God gave us
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  He envisioned us in his mind and spoke it into existence
[08:39.000 --> 08:45.000]  But their attempt to eclipse human destiny will be their own undoing
[08:45.000 --> 08:52.000]  The designs of the enemy will only be used at the end to destroy them
[08:52.000 --> 09:04.000]  Because it'll be the globalists that in truth destroy themselves
[09:04.000 --> 09:11.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, coming up, I'm gonna break down what's really gonna happen in Afghanistan
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  Not what you think you heard from the president
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  It's all coming up. This is the Infowar
[09:19.000 --> 09:41.000]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to Iraq from the front lines of the Infowar
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.000]  And yes, the enemy calls it a war
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  They call themselves the resistance when they're the establishment
[09:48.000 --> 09:55.000]  They're openly on CNN, MSNBC, everywhere calling for violence against the American people
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  Calling for physical intimidation
[09:59.000 --> 10:04.000]  It's happened. Mainline sites like Jihad Watch, who I want to get on
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  Who just exposed radical Jihad groups worldwide calling for violence
[10:09.000 --> 10:16.000]  And the overthrow of the West, they have been banned from commerce by PayPal
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  And other conservative sites got hit today
[10:20.000 --> 10:27.000]  If lawsuits aren't filed and this racketeering is allowed to continue, we'll be next
[10:27.000 --> 10:31.000]  That's why we've entered the season of the lawsuit, not because we're litigious
[10:31.000 --> 10:36.000]  But because they're moving against everyone right now
[10:36.000 --> 10:43.000]  Against our free speech. We either get engaged legally and also on the streets and financially
[10:43.000 --> 10:51.000]  Or triple down our information war and financially flood libertarian, conservative, patriotic
[10:51.000 --> 10:56.000]  And Christian organizations that are fighting the globalist with capital and with energy
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  And with will and with resistance and with prayer, then we will fall
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  But I'm here to tell you we're not going to fall. That's why the enemy is so angry
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  They can feel the fact that our will is far surpassing them
[11:09.000 --> 11:15.000]  And we're finally watching these arrogant, lazy scumbags give us their full attack
[11:15.000 --> 11:20.000]  And all it's doing is causing us to get stronger
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  Forcing us out of the cocoon and into the next level
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.000]  Alright, I've always just wanted a piece of the action of the fight against the globalist
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.000]  I never even dreamed that we'd be the prominent tip of the spear
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.000]  I was just simply there to raise the alarm bell for others
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.000]  And now ladies and gentlemen, you see the next wave of awakening happening
[11:42.000 --> 11:49.000]  And so the giant counter offensive that the globalists have launched is their desperate battle of the balls
[11:49.000 --> 11:56.000]  It is their water loo. It is their day to meet their fate
[11:56.000 --> 12:04.000]  Now, let me go ahead and break down for everybody. The big news here obviously
[12:04.000 --> 12:20.000]  This is very complex and it's also extremely simple like anything that is based in nuance, subtlety, brute force, reality, history, and experience
[12:20.000 --> 12:27.000]  Trump has done everything he said he would do seven months in
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  And he's only been blocked on three big measures by Congress, but he's done everything he said he'd do
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.000]  He's gotten much of it done and he's fought to get the rest of it through
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  He said, I will fight, I will succeed, and I will keep moving forward till we get it all done
[12:42.000 --> 12:55.000]  And in seven months he's had a devastating group of major body blows and uppercuts to the jaw of the new world order
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  I don't need to list all the things that have happened to the enemy, he keeps saying he's a failure, he's a joke, he's mentally ill
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  Because they're saying you're a failure, you're a joke, you're mentally ill, you're demoralized, you're defeated
[13:05.000 --> 13:10.000]  Let me tell you something, you go out to a Democratic party event or you go out to any of these liberal events
[13:10.000 --> 13:17.000]  They are absolutely lost, sad dregs of society
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  They look like the little creatures in the little mermaid from Disney, the Hans Christensen story
[13:22.000 --> 13:31.000]  They turn into a movie of the little slaves, the little souls that Ursula with Flotsam and Jetsam have down in her little grotto
[13:31.000 --> 13:38.000]  At the bottom of the ocean, the people that she's tricked to give their will to, they've turned their will over to her
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  And if you look at little creatures down at the bottom of the grotto, you gotta pull that up
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.000]  You see what these people physically look like, and you can even see what they once looked like
[13:49.000 --> 14:05.000]  But there's the shadow of them now, they have been vampirically, spiritually signed on to this and then they are just sucked dry
[14:05.000 --> 14:10.000]  They look like little slaves that have had much of their essence sucked in the dark crystal
[14:10.000 --> 14:20.000]  They're like bringing in the food and stuff for the Skeksis and bumbling around, and it's very sad until you realize
[14:20.000 --> 14:25.000]  All that's left of them is the enemy's hate for humanity and life and honor and strength and beauty
[14:25.000 --> 14:33.000]  And so they are just ravenous little demons, and then you realize, oh my god, it's all spiritual, it's real
[14:33.000 --> 14:42.000]  These people are husk of what they were, and peering out of them
[14:42.000 --> 14:49.000]  I was in Seattle and there were lots of nice families and crowds and groups of people and all the colors of the rainbow
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.000]  You know, Asian folks, Hispanic, black, white, half the folks were mixed
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.000]  And our listeners were always lightenerized, smart, had facts, were going places
[14:58.000 --> 15:03.000]  You'd see a guy walking over with a great looking woman on his arm, you knew he'd be a listener
[15:03.000 --> 15:09.000]  You know, folks with kids on their shoulders, happy, down at the market
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  Good looking women waving at you
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  And then you'd see the people that hated me, one of them would notice me, like a zombie, they'd go, ugh
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  And all of a sudden the light would come to their eyes a little bit like ahhh
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  And then they'd look around, they'd wait till a crowd of folks got there, knowing a few of them would be in the crowd
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  But it was all subconscious, it was all coward driven
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  Group, group together now, now say it, f you, f you, not you
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  And then run away and try to watch to see if someone did something to me
[15:38.000 --> 15:45.000]  Because they're manipulated by their masters, so everything they do is also a shadow of what their masters do
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.000]  And so it goes up the hierarchy
[15:50.000 --> 15:57.000]  So it's just crazy to realize that like zombies
[15:57.000 --> 16:01.000]  They're kind of moving around slow at first so one of them notices you and goes
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.000]  BRAAAAAAANNNNNNAAAAAAAH
[16:03.000 --> 16:05.000]  And those go ahhh
[16:05.000 --> 16:10.000]  And like one of them's kind of leaning up against the wall and go, ehh, ehh, ehh, ehh, ehh, ehh, ehh
[16:10.000 --> 16:17.000]  And they walk over, they go Nazi, Nazi, Nazi, I am an intellectual, I am scientist
[16:17.000 --> 16:25.360]  like, wow. Another one walks over, not cheese, I'm afraid of them. And then literally a minute
[16:25.360 --> 16:29.160]  later you see them like in like a corner of a door like eating a booger in front of you
[16:29.160 --> 16:34.800]  and they're like, I mean, it's just like, whoa, I'm not kidding. They would walk over
[16:34.800 --> 16:38.480]  and like eat boogers in front of me. And then I like that happened like twice. It's like
[16:38.480 --> 16:44.060]  a spirit. It's like they're run by some program. And it's crazy. It's not like agent Smith
[16:44.060 --> 16:48.040]  gets into their body and he's all cool and a suit and well spoken. It's like something
[16:48.040 --> 16:54.400]  else jumps in and it's like slimer from Ghostbusters. And it's like, I've already run into this spirit
[16:54.400 --> 16:57.880]  two or three times today. And then you run into another one and you get to where you
[16:57.880 --> 17:03.720]  recognize the spirits. And you realize this is like avatar or something. But it's not
[17:03.720 --> 17:08.440]  like advanced aliens came and inject into their bodies. It's like some interdimensional
[17:08.440 --> 17:13.080]  thing happened where like trillions of goblin spirits or something came into the planet.
[17:13.080 --> 17:20.920]  I don't know. And then it physically takes them over. Excuse me. I know this is insane.
[17:20.920 --> 17:28.080]  It is insane. You've got to go out and experience it for yourself. And all they see is you're
[17:28.080 --> 17:35.040]  awake and you're alive and you care. And they take the fact that you care as a way to bludgeon
[17:35.040 --> 17:39.720]  you and beat you and bully you, telling you you're a bad person, knowing you want to be
[17:39.720 --> 17:47.480]  a good person until you turn your will over to them. And then they smile and go, I mean,
[17:47.480 --> 17:51.200]  the universities, they get your young people on there, they bully them and they come submit
[17:51.200 --> 17:56.560]  and the professors walk around and go, I mean, literally anybody that's been to college has
[17:56.560 --> 18:00.320]  experienced it. And so I've sat there in college, let me test this out. I'm going to write the
[18:00.320 --> 18:06.440]  most socialist paper I can and go from getting a, you know, an 85 to a 100. And I'd even
[18:06.440 --> 18:11.360]  misspell everything and just had it horrible. There was just 100. And they'd say, you want
[18:11.360 --> 18:14.720]  to come have coffee with me after I say, oh, I've got to go. And that's when I got out
[18:14.720 --> 18:24.560]  of college. I'm like, this is totally fake. This is complete fraud. I've basically, since
[18:24.560 --> 18:28.440]  I was a young person, I'd lie about taking wallet money on my dad's wallet or stealing
[18:28.440 --> 18:33.560]  beer out of the neighbor's golf cart. I did stuff like that. Because you know, I'm going
[18:33.560 --> 18:37.880]  to 14 and I'm going to knock on this girl's door and I want to grab a six pack and go
[18:37.880 --> 18:41.720]  hang out on the top of the golf course, whether at night, drink beer, I got to get some beer.
[18:41.720 --> 18:45.280]  But other than that, I really don't lie because I'm so into the truth. I'm neurotic about
[18:45.280 --> 18:53.960]  it. And you look at these people, they're just all completely into deception and into
[18:53.960 --> 18:58.600]  lies where they've lied to themselves so much that they're just on a whole nother
[18:58.600 --> 19:10.000]  planet. Now, speaking of lies, that was a few times I tested it in US history and psychology
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.440]  and all the basic classes they made you go to just to see if this was truly the fraud
[19:15.440 --> 19:21.840]  I'd heard it was. And as soon as I just wrote lies, that's all they wanted. I'm like, I
[19:21.840 --> 19:26.480]  just got like a 98 for a bunch of lies here. Let me turn one in. You still hand wrote papers
[19:26.480 --> 19:32.640]  back then. If you wanted, let me turn one in. That's just got misspellings and unlegible.
[19:32.640 --> 19:40.480]  Got a 100 for that. I turned in horrible crap. That was deformed and ugly. And they went,
[19:40.480 --> 19:47.880]  Oh, well done. Now you will. You say two plus two equals five. Now you have the spirit.

[24:19.240 --> 24:24.320]  There's a video that's up on infowars.com right now that one of our new video editors
[24:24.320 --> 24:30.320]  went out and shot on the streets of Dallas at an anti-Trump rally. He talks about the
[24:30.320 --> 24:35.920]  fact that he'd never been to one of these and that it was shocking that it was actually
[24:35.920 --> 24:42.280]  true that it was a collection of mentally ill people acting like goblins. They even
[24:42.280 --> 24:47.760]  did a weird anti-Trump ritual. They've had witches all over the country. Call for spirits
[24:47.760 --> 24:53.540]  to come into our dimension to attack Trump. Whether you believe in any of this or not,
[24:53.540 --> 24:59.240]  when you go out and you look at them and you experience them, they're not acting. You'll
[24:59.240 --> 25:05.960]  run into one of them and then be in another city and it's like the same person but a different
[25:05.960 --> 25:14.040]  body. They say the same weird stuff and the same little jokes and gibber like demons.
[25:14.040 --> 25:18.840]  Now more and more people are seeing the footage I'm talking about and they're experiencing
[25:18.840 --> 25:25.760]  it and it's like what is it? Because I growing up was Christian but I was more atheistic in
[25:25.760 --> 25:29.720]  my mind. I wasn't sure if all this stuff was real. I knew that the establishment churches
[25:29.720 --> 25:35.800]  were annoying. I knew I didn't like that. I knew they were full of baloney. But when
[25:35.800 --> 25:41.360]  you look at the behavior of these people, it's just a bunch of losers. And then every
[25:41.360 --> 25:47.480]  culture talks about times and civilization when people become decadent and then become
[25:47.480 --> 25:53.720]  demon-possessed. The Asians say it. Ancient Indian texts say it. The ancient Chinese texts
[25:53.720 --> 25:58.480]  say it. The ancient African texts say it. The ancient Greek texts say it. The ancient
[25:58.480 --> 26:03.800]  Babylonian texts say it. The ancient Druidic texts say it. The ancient Mesoamerican Mayan
[26:03.800 --> 26:10.600]  cultures say it. They say that there's times when all of a sudden people go insane and
[26:10.600 --> 26:16.160]  are entered by evil spirits and begin to act out and try to destroy all that's good. They
[26:16.160 --> 26:21.560]  want to sexualize your children. They want to force you to take vaccines. They want to
[26:21.560 --> 26:29.840]  pull down our sovereignty. They want to bring people in that have diseases. And then they
[26:29.840 --> 26:34.960]  act just like insane demonic creatures. So is this just an area of the brain that gets
[26:34.960 --> 26:42.800]  activated? The lower animal brain? The reptile brain, as it's called? Or is it something
[26:42.800 --> 26:49.400]  different? Are they picking up a broadcast? The power structure, the social engineers
[26:49.400 --> 26:56.760]  seem to know what they're doing, though. And they've created these giant hordes of unwashed
[26:56.760 --> 27:04.000]  masses of every race, color, and creed who are unified by a spirit of hatred, a spirit
[27:04.000 --> 27:11.160]  that hates life, and a spirit that above all wants to control the prosperous, the honorable.
[27:11.160 --> 27:18.440]  Those that want to be pure. Those that resonate with the light. Those that love God are hated
[27:18.440 --> 27:24.480]  by those that love death. All those that hate me love death, Jesus Christ said. You won't
[27:24.480 --> 27:29.000]  find Jesus Christ in one of these establishment churches. But let me tell you something. You
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.040]  go out and you go to one of these anti-Trump events, or you go to a mainline Democratic
[27:34.040 --> 27:39.160]  Party event, and they'll tell you, hell, it's even in mainline literature now, that they
[27:39.160 --> 27:44.200]  believe killing babies is a sacrament. They believe it's to hurt Christians. They believe
[27:44.200 --> 27:48.480]  it gives them power, and they get off on it, and they'll tell you, I kill my babies and
[27:48.480 --> 27:54.800]  I like it. And I tell me more, and they go, Satan, Satan. And they're not trying to shock
[27:54.800 --> 27:59.760]  you when they eat their buggers or tell you they love Satan. They're not acting like Linda
[27:59.760 --> 28:06.720]  Blair because they're trying to be bad. They by approximation have given themselves over
[28:06.720 --> 28:11.000]  to the spirit and given themselves over to the media and given themselves over to the
[28:11.000 --> 28:21.800]  spirit of this world. And now it's all they've got. And they want you destroyed, and they're
[28:21.800 --> 28:27.880]  not going to give up until it happens. Go to their parades, go to their events, go and
[28:27.880 --> 28:32.680]  experience it. And they bully each other, and they fight with each other, and they try
[28:32.680 --> 28:40.520]  to make themselves more extreme over and over and over again, hissing hatefully, wanting
[28:40.520 --> 28:50.600]  to pull down everything. They're not tolerant. They're intolerant of you. They believe you're
[28:50.600 --> 29:01.160]  mentally ill because they're confused, they're lost, and they're led by a resonance, an
[29:01.160 --> 29:07.040]  archetype, a spirit. And that's what you've got to know is that when you're facing these
[29:07.040 --> 29:13.000]  people, you've seen the behavior, you've seen it all. They're not learning this from
[29:13.000 --> 29:20.200]  each other. Maybe it's in the ether, the group collective, but it's the same thing in Washington
[29:20.200 --> 29:26.840]  DC or in Washington state. It's the same thing in Minneapolis, Minnesota or Tampa, Florida.
[29:26.840 --> 29:32.760]  When you see these people, it's the same deal. They're turned over. They're so dumbed down,
[29:32.760 --> 29:39.440]  so poisoned, so lost that they are just empty screens, I guess, resonating lower energy,
[29:39.440 --> 29:43.680]  whatever you want to call it. And it's like weird broadcasts from other dimension. It's
[29:43.680 --> 29:48.040]  all distorted. It's blind. It's upset. And it just wants to kill you.
[29:48.040 --> 30:00.680]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[31:08.400 --> 31:14.120]  of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems. The same team based right

[31:34.480 --> 31:40.360]  or avoid most toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't. The Alexa Pure
[31:40.360 --> 31:46.120]  Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet

[33:23.000 --> 33:30.000]  We are back live. I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com. We're not the fake news. We're the real news
[33:35.760 --> 33:42.760]  dedicated to justice and civilization and a future, a constructive global destiny enacted
[33:42.760 --> 33:49.760]  by individuals, but manifested collectively. That's how we'll defeat these armies of evil.
[34:00.900 --> 34:07.900]  Look at DrudgeReport.com. Phoenix braces for Trump. Pence is going to join him. I was
[34:07.900 --> 34:14.900]  told last week that the president is strongly considering pardoning Joe Arpaio at this rally
[34:16.880 --> 34:23.880]  tonight. And I've been told that his pardon has been green-lighted. We first reported
[34:24.120 --> 34:28.760]  that two weeks ago. Fox News confirmed with the Trump administration that it's been drafted
[34:28.760 --> 34:33.600]  up by the law firms. It's being reviewed by the chief counsels and that the president
[34:33.600 --> 34:39.160]  has said he intends to do it. Now, he could change his mind, but he doesn't do that very
[34:39.160 --> 34:46.160]  often. Talk about Afghanistan here in just a moment. But look at what else is on DrudgeReport.com.
[34:46.160 --> 34:53.160]  Paper. Google's secretly recording you through your mobile phone. That is shocking. The sun's
[34:55.000 --> 35:00.840]  reporting it. Paranoid Android. How Google is secretly recording you through your mobile
[35:00.840 --> 35:06.400]  phone. Monitoring millions of conversations every day and storing the creepy audio files.
[35:06.400 --> 35:13.080]  How about the illegal audio files? How about systems given to AI that then decides your
[35:13.080 --> 35:18.960]  algorithm and decides a detailed advertising package off what you're doing? That pays for
[35:18.960 --> 35:25.960]  the main snooping. Then they make money off stealing your literal thoughts, hopes and dreams.
[35:25.960 --> 35:32.960]  But then there's secondary sales of the information to other corporations, to other groups, and
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.760]  they're inside your phone. How can you trust anything that they claim they forensically
[35:37.760 --> 35:43.960]  find on a digital device when they're all backdoored, wide open, not back alleys, but
[35:43.960 --> 35:48.880]  big giant interstate thoroughfares for whoever wants to come through? Because governments
[35:48.880 --> 35:55.000]  have demanded, via the Telecommunications Act here and similar laws globally, unified giant
[35:55.000 --> 35:59.000]  backdoors that are bigger than the front doors. You're sitting there with your little
[35:59.000 --> 36:03.280]  computer phone that's tracking everything you're doing. You think it's this little window
[36:03.280 --> 36:08.120]  you're looking into, into the universe, but actually it's a giant doorway from everyone
[36:08.120 --> 36:14.120]  else to you. And I've always warned everybody, I've always broke it down and we told you
[36:14.120 --> 36:21.120]  with the patents and we told you with the information that was sent out to the shareholders.
[36:21.120 --> 36:28.120]  In 2005 by Google, Google was only seven years old then. And they said, we're going to activate
[36:31.600 --> 36:36.600]  the microphones and soon there'll be cameras on all the new platform phones. They called
[36:36.600 --> 36:43.200]  them smartphones then coming out. And they said, an example is if the dog's barking, we'll
[36:43.200 --> 36:50.200]  know you have a dog and then we'll have dog food ads pop up. I was, I mean if it's happened
[36:51.280 --> 36:56.120]  about six, seven years ago in the office, we did tests where we'd go in and talk about
[36:56.120 --> 37:00.280]  stuff in front of the group of computers and then a day later the exact ad, not stuff we've
[37:00.280 --> 37:04.920]  been searching would pop up. And I said, let's just not videotape this and show it because
[37:04.920 --> 37:08.480]  it'll just be too much, people won't believe it. I already knew what was going on. Here
[37:08.480 --> 37:15.480]  they are admitting it's happening. Oh, but see, I'm the fake news because, I mean it's
[37:16.600 --> 37:19.640]  like I was telling people on the street, they're like, ah, screw you. One of you right-wingers
[37:19.640 --> 37:24.360]  ran over a poor girl and I'd say, well, I didn't do that. I don't endorse that. You're
[37:24.360 --> 37:28.520]  just projecting that onto me. But I said, what about the, you know, 15 debt or whatever
[37:28.520 --> 37:35.280]  in Barcelona today? Ah, shut up. It's fake news. Then one guy stood next to his boy
[37:35.280 --> 37:41.480]  for him. He goes, actually that did happen. He goes, ah, whatever, shut up. Because you're
[37:41.480 --> 37:48.480]  already so intellectual. You're already just so intellectual, just frolicking around. 39
[37:51.600 --> 37:58.040]  shootings in Chicago this weekend, nine deaths, no national media outrage. And the president
[37:58.040 --> 38:02.920]  retweeted that and what did the news say? They said, the president's tweeted a racist
[38:02.920 --> 38:08.840]  alt-writer, Jack Pasobak. Nothing racist, none of it true. Does it matter? They'll just
[38:08.840 --> 38:13.520]  have Tom Brokaw come on. I'm Tom Brokaw and we've got to have a lot of courage right
[38:13.520 --> 38:19.480]  now to stand against all these Nazis like Alex Jones. And I told everybody they're
[38:19.480 --> 38:25.960]  like role players. It's like children's make-believe in these liberal groups. That's kind of the
[38:25.960 --> 38:31.280]  gateway to it is it's fantasy land. They dress up in superhero outfits and in Captain America
[38:31.280 --> 38:35.800]  outfits. I see the video all over the country and they show up and run around screaming
[38:35.800 --> 38:40.480]  Nazi, Nazi. And then they beat up old women with American flags. And then I was telling
[38:40.480 --> 38:45.000]  the crew about it. They found articles today where they've got the LARPers, the live action
[38:45.000 --> 38:51.600]  role play people, showing up in Phoenix today. And it now it isn't live action. See, they
[38:51.600 --> 38:57.280]  always wanted to battle and fight evil wizards and, you know, be Conan the barbarian. But
[38:57.280 --> 39:03.920]  now, now they're going to really go out and fight Nazis. And it doesn't matter the families
[39:03.920 --> 39:09.240]  coming out to hear Trump aren't Nazis. It doesn't matter in role playing land. You can
[39:09.240 --> 39:13.240]  just say anyone's a Nazi, including an old man in a wheelchair and beat the living snot
[39:13.240 --> 39:17.960]  out of them or hit him in the head with a with a tire iron or a bike lock because you're
[39:17.960 --> 39:26.040]  a hero. And then they'll have CNN and MSNBC and the Washington Post go well cops deserve
[39:26.040 --> 39:30.160]  to die. They've been doing bad things. And you know, the public's all Nazis that support
[39:30.160 --> 39:35.600]  Trump. And so, you know, that's what's going to happen. And then and then when we finally
[39:35.600 --> 39:43.400]  stand up to them, they're going to call it, Oh my gosh, someone punched back.
[39:43.400 --> 39:47.440]  How Google secretly recording you through your mobile monitoring millions of conversations
[39:47.440 --> 39:54.000]  every day and storing the creepy audio files. How about illegal? You may have accidentally
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.760]  triggered the listening device, allowing it to record incriminating convos with steamy
[39:59.760 --> 40:05.200]  gossip. And they even write it like, Oh, it's your fault. Yeah, you didn't read the 20 pages
[40:05.200 --> 40:11.000]  of stuff, the updates, you click some button or it loaded in, they're already doing it.
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.760]  And then when they get caught, they go, oopsie, that was a mistake all the time. Facebook,
[40:14.760 --> 40:18.520]  Twitter, Google, they all have these all the time, like, Oh, accidentally reactivate everybody's
[40:18.520 --> 40:24.160]  stuff for a year. Oh, we got caught. We're going to quit that now. Did you know that
[40:24.160 --> 40:28.600]  Google's been recording you without your knowledge? God, I didn't know that. But you
[40:28.600 --> 40:36.480]  know, a major newspaper reported it. So you know what? I just learned that. I just learned
[40:36.480 --> 40:42.720]  that you're about to learn what's happening in Afghanistan. And it's the current policy
[40:42.720 --> 40:53.760]  and we'll see if he can finagle it. Because it is a very sophisticated maneuver the president's
[40:53.760 --> 40:58.040]  engaged in, but I'm going to break that down in a minute. So the president's going to be
[40:58.040 --> 41:02.640]  speaking there in Phoenix, political leaders and law enforcement officials in Arizona are
[41:02.640 --> 41:08.000]  on high alert at a president Trump's campaign rally Tuesday night in Phoenix. The big question
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.400]  is whether there'll be more supporters of Trump inside the Phoenix Convention Center,
[41:12.400 --> 41:18.400]  which holds 29,000 or protesters outside. Oh, there'll be more supporters there, but
[41:18.400 --> 41:24.400]  they'll try to block them from getting in rioting. It's like they did it at the inauguration.
[41:24.400 --> 41:28.120]  And then they'll show footage of before Trump even speaks, you know, gives the speech and
[41:28.120 --> 41:32.880]  say, Oh, look, no one was there. It's another tactic of deception, just like we see in the
[41:32.880 --> 41:39.440]  WikiLeaks. Then they'll be violent. And they'll say the president's tearing America apart.
[41:39.440 --> 41:43.480]  He needs to stop these rallies and he still hasn't repudiated white supremacist even though
[41:43.480 --> 41:48.960]  he does it over and over again like a parrot. Repudiate white supremacist, repudiate Nazis,
[41:48.960 --> 41:54.160]  repudiate KKK, repudiate Nazis, repudiate KKK. Hey, you know they never repudiated him.
[41:54.160 --> 41:58.560]  Repudiate David Doug, repudiate David Doug, repudiate David Doug. You know, I've never
[41:58.560 --> 42:03.880]  heard you repudiate David Doug in the same press conferences. I repudiate David Doug five
[42:03.880 --> 42:08.920]  minutes later. You never repudiated. I just repudiated. Repudiate, repudiate, repudiate,
[42:08.920 --> 42:18.400]  repudiate, repudiate. Trump's response to the violence at a white supremacist rally
[42:18.400 --> 42:23.160]  in Charlottesville, Virginia has become the biggest controversy to date of his presidency.
[42:23.160 --> 42:28.360]  And then of course, they don't show you his response. They just say the response. That's
[42:28.360 --> 42:34.400]  a skillful deceptor at the, at the Hill. Don't even say he said bad stuff. Just say his response.
[42:34.400 --> 42:38.760]  And then you've kind of delicately lied. These things must be done delicately at the ministry
[42:38.760 --> 42:45.480]  of truth. Right? Winston, as if your time in the noose isn't coming at the hands of
[42:45.480 --> 42:53.880]  your masters, not me. Trump's response. Oh my. The violence at a white supremacist rally
[42:53.880 --> 42:58.600]  in Charlottesville, Virginia has become the biggest controversy to date of his presidency.
[42:58.600 --> 43:02.920]  The Phoenix rally as a result has become an opportunity for Trump's opponents to show
[43:02.920 --> 43:12.440]  their force. You're powerful when you stumble around and attack old women. Some GOP leaders
[43:12.440 --> 43:18.200]  such as Governor Doug Ducey have steered clear of the rally entirely. That's right. It's
[43:18.200 --> 43:22.280]  all peer pressure. Steer clear. Be part of the follower group over here. We're safe under
[43:22.280 --> 43:27.860]  the wings of Hillary. As she eats us, eats our liver one at a time. Trump is moving ahead
[43:27.860 --> 43:33.200]  with the event, despite a plea from Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat. That's right.
[43:33.200 --> 43:40.040]  Just stay away. You've done enough, Mr. President. We've already got to pull the security clearances
[43:40.040 --> 43:43.640]  of any of your supporters in the military. Because after all, you're not allowed to support
[43:43.640 --> 43:53.320]  the commander in chief. That's treason in bizarro world. Stanton said in a statement
[43:53.320 --> 43:58.160]  that he's disappointed that Trump would hold a campaign rally, going to campaign rally.
[43:58.160 --> 44:03.640]  It's a rally for the agenda, not for his election. So that's a lie, too. While the nation is
[44:03.640 --> 44:08.280]  still healing. Oh, this is a quote from the tragic events of Charlottesville. How dare
[44:08.280 --> 44:12.040]  him hold a rally to criticize radical Islam when they're killing everybody left and right
[44:12.040 --> 44:17.600]  a hundred times Charlottesville. But see, you control reality hill. So you tell us your
[44:17.600 --> 44:25.080]  whole upside down lying article. Phoenix police chief Jerry Williams, see, they're all coming
[44:25.080 --> 44:31.360]  together here, said in a statement that her force will have maximum staffing during the
[44:31.360 --> 44:35.600]  visit. Yeah, I wonder if they'll order a stand down and like attack all the Trump supporters.
[44:35.600 --> 44:39.840]  They'll probably do that. I mean, that's how bad this has gotten. Stanton said the city's
[44:39.840 --> 44:44.600]  committed to keeping everyone inside and outside in the area safe. Imagine if we have all Democrat
[44:44.600 --> 44:48.520]  run cities, what they'll do. Gosh, should be hellish. But Phoenix police is always professional.
[44:48.520 --> 44:52.240]  The FBI Department of Homeland Security have been great about coordinating with law enforcement.
[44:52.240 --> 44:57.240]  Well, we'll see if that happens. Things are changing there in Phoenix. Sheriff wise and
[44:57.240 --> 45:10.160]  police rise all of it. So we'll see what happens. There's that hill story. All about peer pressuring
[45:10.160 --> 45:15.520]  everyone into submission. Now, let me give you the big Afghanistan news. The names of
[45:15.520 --> 45:21.640]  the streams on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and stuff today on the show have titles like
[45:21.640 --> 45:30.120]  learn tomorrow's news today. But really, you should say learn the news of 15 years from
[45:30.120 --> 45:41.880]  now today. It is 15 years ago that I told you the cameras and microphones are watching
[45:41.880 --> 45:46.160]  you and how the algorithm works and how they data store it what they do. And it was 20 years
[45:46.160 --> 45:53.400]  ago, I told you about all the NSA stuff, but I'm going to give you the maximum prime analysis
[45:53.400 --> 46:02.160]  of exactly what Trump's doing in Afghanistan. And this is what the president is intending
[46:02.160 --> 46:11.200]  to do. That does not mean that's how this is going to end up. And before I go there,
[46:11.200 --> 46:18.000]  let me just give you some background as any real analysis would microcosm, Arab Spring,
[46:18.000 --> 46:27.440]  Sun Brotherhood, radical Jihad movements, ISIS explosion. That's all fomented by the
[46:27.440 --> 46:32.920]  globalist by the UN by the WTO by the IMF by the EU to open Europe's borders and have
[46:32.920 --> 46:39.360]  that giant influx to quote colonize Europe. That's all declassified. Soros, Sodiak boats
[46:39.360 --> 46:43.320]  by the hundreds a day, faring the people across from North Africa and the Middle East
[46:43.320 --> 46:48.680]  in unvetted dumping a man, knife attacks, bombings, mass runovers every day, isn't even
[46:48.680 --> 46:53.960]  news now. It's just it's just background noise. AQ con, you know, all these, you know, the
[46:53.960 --> 46:56.960]  mayor of London just say, get used to it. It's life. Just get used to it. We're going
[46:56.960 --> 47:07.040]  to kill you and run your life. So all that's happened. Five years ago, they launched the
[47:07.040 --> 47:12.160]  Arab Spring as an ISIS cover. Our military is ordered to pull out of Iraq and leave all
[47:12.160 --> 47:17.200]  the weapons, everything just in the storage facilities, just waiting, claiming, Oh, it's
[47:17.200 --> 47:22.800]  for the Iraqi National Guard that, you know, will run at the first site. They've been trained
[47:22.800 --> 47:29.320]  to fail by trained to fail. That have you one guy training a thousand people literally
[47:29.320 --> 47:36.000]  and like eight guys training 20 something thousand. They leave all the weapons in there.
[47:36.000 --> 47:41.880]  They pull out Obama opens it up. They give them the first load of weapons in Benghazi.
[47:41.880 --> 47:45.920]  They invade Iraq, take over part of the West there going to the east of Syria. It's all
[47:45.920 --> 47:52.360]  staged start the civil war. Our military five years ago says, we're not going to be part
[47:52.360 --> 47:55.360]  of this anymore. We're not going to be the Air Force for Al Qaeda and ISIS. They tell
[47:55.360 --> 48:01.560]  Congress, Congress comes out, Rand Paul, Senator Ted Cruz, they do a great job. We stopped
[48:01.560 --> 48:05.560]  that. We worked with the Russians, knock them out. They're basically defeated right now.
[48:05.560 --> 48:10.800]  And Trump says, you know what? Now Obama was actually talking about pulling out of Afghanistan.
[48:10.800 --> 48:16.320]  Trump had said it should never been done. But then Trump says, hmm, the last place they've
[48:16.320 --> 48:21.960]  got now is a stronghold is Afghanistan. And if we just pull out immediately, they're going
[48:21.960 --> 48:29.880]  to go in and set up shop again there. The answer is actually pull out for real, but make a
[48:29.880 --> 48:35.640]  deal with the different tribes for economic development per zone of the natural resources,
[48:35.640 --> 48:42.520]  where it would them. That's what was really announced last night. Block China from moving
[48:42.520 --> 48:47.760]  in by a set piece threatening to use India against Pakistan and Pakistan doesn't sue
[48:47.760 --> 48:54.040]  for peace with Trump. Actually engaging in geopolitical brinkmanship, something that
[48:54.040 --> 48:57.520]  Obama wouldn't do. That was all announced for people that knew what they were listening
[48:57.520 --> 49:01.720]  to last night. He always told you what he would do. And that is, I'll never tell you
[49:01.720 --> 49:07.680]  what I'm really going to do militarily. So he said, we're going to go in to kill terrorists.
[49:07.680 --> 49:14.360]  That means kill the Taliban, Al Qaeda, ISIS, remove those people. And I won't tell you
[49:14.360 --> 49:19.720]  that we've got a commitment forever. If other people don't do their part. And really he's
[49:19.720 --> 49:24.880]  saying a peace deal and then a pullout and left Afghanistan actually run themselves,
[49:24.880 --> 49:30.480]  but in a Balkanized fashion. But to do that, when massive military comes in, it looks like
[49:30.480 --> 49:36.960]  military is expanding, but really it's the main force to pull the other force out. Like
[49:36.960 --> 49:41.200]  there's more people at your house. When you move, then we're probably ever there because
[49:41.200 --> 49:45.440]  you're packing stuff up. Neighbors are coming over to say bye. And you've got the movers
[49:45.440 --> 49:51.560]  coming in to load the truck. But it looks like when the movers pull up, Oh, more people
[49:51.560 --> 49:56.480]  at your house until you recognize it's moving truck. Well, they don't want it to look like
[49:56.480 --> 50:02.400]  that. So it's going to look like a build up, but it's really going to be a pullout. And
[50:02.400 --> 50:06.840]  I wrestled with whether or not I was going to tell everybody this because I don't want
[50:06.840 --> 50:10.720]  to give away the US strategy, but smart people already know this. I made some phone calls
[50:10.720 --> 50:15.120]  last night. I talked to some contractors. I talked to some military people. I talked
[50:15.120 --> 50:19.440]  to some folks in intelligence agencies last night. And I talked to some other folks that
[50:19.440 --> 50:24.400]  are real smart just on the ground to say what were you told? And they were told me the exact
[50:24.400 --> 50:29.960]  same thing I was told last night in about eight different phone calls I made. We should
[50:29.960 --> 50:33.760]  get Pachennic on. I bet he says exactly what I'm about to say on the other side and not
[50:33.760 --> 50:40.120]  because he's listening to me because that's what's going on. Trump intends to go in there
[50:40.120 --> 50:46.760]  with an evacuation force, make deals, pull out and let them have their sovereignty and
[50:46.760 --> 50:51.040]  their chance. And he's going to use India putting pressure on Pakistan to do that because
[50:51.040 --> 50:54.720]  it's really Pakistan running the whole show. But we're not going to leave all the armories
[50:54.720 --> 50:59.280]  full of weapons and infrastructure for the Taliban and al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[50:59.280 --> 51:04.600]  Do you owe more than $10,000 to the IRS? Are you facing potential wage garnishments, levies

[53:32.200 --> 53:36.260]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years. I've helped thousands and I can
[53:36.260 --> 53:40.520]  help you too. I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing
[53:40.520 --> 53:46.520]  as a hopeless case. Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt. With the IRS's new
[53:46.520 --> 53:51.760]  programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem. Call 800-34-NO-TAX.

[54:22.760 --> 54:27.680]  You want to know what Donald Trump really said in last night's speech? Well, it's everything
[54:27.680 --> 54:33.120]  he said on the campaign trail. That he's going to follow his instincts and that he's going
[54:33.120 --> 54:39.320]  to get us out of Afghanistan. You notice, he didn't say in the speech, I'm not going
[54:39.320 --> 54:43.840]  to follow my instincts. He said, my instincts are we should never have been there, but now
[54:43.840 --> 54:50.280]  I'm behind the desk in the Oval Office and, well, that changes things. If we announce
[54:50.280 --> 54:56.600]  an evacuation, it'll be like Saigon in 1975 with people hanging off the helicopter skids
[54:56.600 --> 55:02.520]  on top of the hotels trying to get out. The C-130 is overloaded with men, women and children
[55:02.520 --> 55:09.520]  marked for death once the North got full control. So the real victory is deception and war.
[55:14.200 --> 55:18.000]  Tell everybody that you're beefing things up so that you see all the equipment being
[55:18.000 --> 55:23.480]  moved around on the ground. And what looks like an expansion is actually the beginning
[55:23.480 --> 55:30.480]  of a pullout in the next 12 months. But then how does he secure that? The globalists kept
[55:30.680 --> 55:34.560]  al-Qaeda and ISIS still operating. They protected them all over the world. They use them as
[55:34.560 --> 55:40.680]  an excuse to be there. Trump is actually going to kill them all just like they've done in
[55:40.680 --> 55:46.280]  Syria and Iraq and crushed and defeated ISIS and al-Qaeda. And you never hear about that
[55:46.280 --> 55:50.760]  on the news. But he and our military have succeeded. So he's actually going to go in,
[55:50.760 --> 55:55.680]  in the problem, kill the terrorists, not try to occupy the country. The Afghans are going
[55:55.680 --> 56:02.680]  to see that and historically stand down. Then we'll work through corporate systems with
[56:02.760 --> 56:07.480]  all the different tribes that want economic development for their lithium and their other
[56:07.480 --> 56:12.120]  rare earth minerals and their natural gas and their oil cutting out China. And the deals
[56:12.120 --> 56:17.400]  are being made. But the globalists want a destabilization and an excuse to actually stay there and just
[56:17.400 --> 56:21.920]  make money for the contractors. And that's not going to be done. The globalists didn't
[56:21.920 --> 56:26.520]  want to defeat China and cut them off. But Trump's now doing it with India, with pressure
[56:26.520 --> 56:31.440]  on Pakistan. And if you look at all the chess pieces, it's a master move. But you don't tell
[56:31.440 --> 56:36.720]  people when you're coming. You don't tell people when you're going. You tell people,
[56:36.720 --> 56:42.400]  American people what you're going to do. But then he told you, but military wise, I'm never
[56:42.400 --> 56:46.640]  going to tell folks what we're doing exactly. I'm going to deceive our enemies. I'm going
[56:46.640 --> 56:51.760]  to tell you the truth. I'm going to deceive our enemies. That's exactly what he's doing.
[56:51.760 --> 56:58.920]  But not really deceiving them because all out in the open is the real pieces of the plan.
[56:58.920 --> 57:04.720]  Go in, actually knock out the terrorists, knock out the Al Qaeda, knock out the ISIS, pull
[57:04.720 --> 57:11.120]  the troops out, come in with economic development, put pressure on Pakistan through India and
[57:11.120 --> 57:16.160]  others to make them stop supporting Al Qaeda and ISIS and tell Pakistan, you can actually
[57:16.160 --> 57:21.000]  run Afghanistan like you always wanted to, but you got to get off our back. Now that's
[57:21.000 --> 57:25.680]  what Trump is attempting to do. And I believe it is the very best plan, knowing all the
[57:25.680 --> 57:30.000]  different factors, studying it, getting exclusive interviews with Hamid Ghul, the former head
[57:30.000 --> 57:36.000]  of Pakistani intelligence and everybody else on and off air. Don't just talk to him. Trump's
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.880]  plan is the very best for America, American business and for our veterans that have bled
[57:40.880 --> 57:45.280]  so much over there to actually defeat the Wahhabist scourge that we've actually been
[57:45.280 --> 57:50.720]  propping up at a globalist level. The globalists create the enemy, prop up the enemy. Trump's
[57:50.720 --> 57:55.360]  not doing that. We're going to devastate the actual Al Qaeda, ISIS, bring in economic
[57:55.360 --> 58:01.040]  development and pull out. We're giving them a carpet of gold instead of a carpet of bombs
[58:01.040 --> 58:09.160]  if they accept it. Now, before we go any further, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to just spend
[58:09.160 --> 58:12.840]  a few seconds here telling you, I told you we're selling out a lot of products. Michael
[58:12.840 --> 58:18.280]  ZX sold out. Rainforest is set to sell out the next few days. So it's no longer on sale.
[58:18.280 --> 58:23.960]  The great new tropic. All right. Knockout selling out. DNA forces selling out. Silver bullet

[58:49.960 --> 58:55.280]  of you already know. I am a voracious consumer of news and information. And in the last four
[58:55.280 --> 59:00.520]  or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment
[59:00.520 --> 59:05.440]  is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better
[59:05.440 --> 59:11.200]  nutrition than we do today. And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals
[59:11.200 --> 59:16.440]  that they were hunting, killing and then processing. And so I set out to develop caveman, but
[59:16.440 --> 59:23.040]  to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients
[59:23.040 --> 59:28.840]  known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time. Info wars isn't just

[59:56.360 --> 01:00:10.840]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:48.840]  We are back live. Millie Weaver, the video of the amazing eclipse of Gavin Wintz yesterday.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.400]  He's going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour just to talk about how amazing
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:58.720]  it was and how it's seen by a different folks is a different portend or omen. And we're
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:03.880]  also going to be opening the phones up. If you just joined me coming up the next segment,
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:11.160]  I'm going to be playing clips of Trump's speech last night on the situation in Afghanistan.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:18.720]  And during the speech, I said knowing Trump and knowing his background. I hope that this
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.600]  is him understanding. You can't just announce an evacuation and then turn over all the infrastructure
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.040]  to al-Qaeda ISIS. They'll know you're pulling out and and and doing with transition. They
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:35.800]  will attack. So what you do is you announce a buildup. You do go in and build up, turn
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:41.960]  the military loose to just kill and destroy, seek and destroy, search and clear all of
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:47.360]  the al-Qaeda ISIS forces. And then once they've all been wiped out, a lot of them are on CIA
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.840]  payroll. I mean, you know, old payroll from Obama. Once they've been dealt with, once
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:57.560]  they've been taken out, then you can go in and make the business deals with the different
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:02.800]  tribal chiefs. That's how it is. You cannot democratize Afghanistan because they'll kill
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:07.640]  you because they're always at war with each other because there isn't a Afghanistan. There's
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:14.600]  a bunch of past tune, a Connie network tribalist that are also half the population of Pakistan
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:22.680]  and Pakistan can't control them either. You try to, they kill you. So it's their country.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:26.680]  It's been their country for thousands of years. All they know is people always try to invade
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:30.120]  and take it from them from all different sides, north, south, east and west. And all they
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:35.800]  know is they kill you. But if we come to them and say we're liberating you from an oppressive
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:43.160]  central government, it took a couple hundred US special forces six months to completely
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:54.000]  kick the Taliban out of Afghanistan in 2001, early 2002. The problem is we had to quote,
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.360]  you know, make a deal to basically not quote, stay. Well, then when we did stay, then all
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:04.880]  the tribes started fighting again and they started outlying themselves with ISIS and
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:11.560]  Al Qaeda again in an attempt to kick us out. And then that's why you've got the ongoing
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:16.520]  bombings and killings and people get shot, their arms and legs blown off and the trillions
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:21.240]  of dollars we've spent. And that's the big boondoggle. The big banks didn't want a good
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:25.920]  policy for US sovereignty. They didn't want to make business deals and go in there and
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:32.280]  actually have infrastructure and have to pay the locals. They'd rather go in and just have
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:38.880]  trillions of dollars spent on a failed war that saps American money, power and treasure
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:44.320]  and allows China to continue its globalist economic expansion where they're taking over
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:50.360]  the world through economic operations and Trump sees that and says, no, we're going
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:58.360]  to beat you, China economically. We built you. We put Mao in. We set your country up.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.680]  We let you have our markets and you screwed us over for it. And now we're taking that
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.520]  back from you. So get ready. We're going to hit you with military containment and we're
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:11.840]  going to hit you with economic growth and expansion and all your one sided deals are
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:17.760]  over and we're going to go in and build up India and a Pakistan wants to play ball. We'll
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.880]  work with them. If they don't, we're going to hit them with economic development in
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.800]  Afghanistan and in India and cut you off another Spencer operation. You want to know the whole
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:33.400]  plan? Here it is. I don't need to talk to Trump to know it. I said, well, that's what
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.200]  it probably is last night when I was watching, but I wasn't sure that I made phone calls
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:43.760]  and that is currently the plan. The big question is can Trump execute it or will they try to
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:49.520]  sidetrack it? They failed so far in a big test in Syria. They tried to expand the war,
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:54.320]  take out a sod and Trump has said, no, can Trump contain the generals? Can he control
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:59.160]  McMaster? You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout

[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:10.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance from the front lines of
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:35.520]  the information war. It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:48.960]  The men and women of our military operate as one team with one shared mission and one
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:58.080]  shared sense of purpose. They transcend every line of race, ethnicity, creed and color to
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:08.400]  serve together and sacrifice together in absolutely perfect cohesion. That is because all service
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:18.560]  members are brothers and sisters. They are all part of the same family. It's called the
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:27.520]  American family. They take the same oath, fight for the same flag and live according to the
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:36.520]  same law. But despite all these speeches, he's always given the NAAC awards. He got 30 years
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:45.720]  ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago. Despite all of that, despite other things, I'm not going
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:53.400]  to stay on here. They still continue to call the president a racist because it's all they've
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:58.960]  got. And once they get away with lying and once you can have Tom Brokaw say he's a racist
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:05.280]  or Tom Brokaw say Alex Jones is a racist, the sky's the limit. And so they have no
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:11.240]  qualms. They have no standards. They have no governors. They have nothing now. They are
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:19.160]  fully committed to outdoing each other in the control corporate media to destroy the president.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:27.600]  It's quite a spectacle. So every day I have the clips with CNN, MSNBC legitimizing violence.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:33.240]  I've got MSNBC legitimizing an end to the First Amendment saying it's bad, it's racist.
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:38.800]  See, once you can say everything's racist, you can ban everything. Arizona Congressman,
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:46.840]  President Trump's clearly racist and just an abject liar. MSNBC test card describes
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:51.160]  President Trump as the trash man. And this is what I've noticed over and over again before
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:58.040]  I play these clips. Every time they attack us and we really pull back and look at their
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:04.840]  attack, whatever they've just done, we're going to play some of this video in a moment.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:15.080]  Whatever they've just done ends up backfiring on them. It's incredible. It's like Buzzfeed
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:20.000]  went, the same folks that made up the PP dossier on Trump, they're getting sued over that.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.320]  They admit it's a fraud now. They went and had a bunch of our products tested by a top
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:30.520]  California lab. This California has the strongest state laws in the world where there's more
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:37.680]  lead in the air or in an apple than you can have in products there and say it's California
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:43.520]  level. So we send our stuff to the top California labs already to be tested at California standards.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:48.320]  We use big firms that manufacture our supplements already that are already tested. But we go
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:52.920]  further and test it again, even though we're not required to, because we want to have those
[01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:58.080]  tests and just double down. So we're out of things sometimes. It takes months sometimes
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.640]  to get things tested. Or then an ingredient we got doesn't pass California standards
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:07.000]  and we got to then send it back and try to get something that does. Most people don't
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.520]  do that. And it just shows how it blew up in their face when they went, okay, there's
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:15.600]  nothing in it. It's totally clean. But it's overpriced. Look at this B12. This is the
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:25.120]  best in the country, the lab says. And it's $35. There's a 17. They didn't even know that
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:28.920]  the B12 company they picked as all over the country known to be the best. We went and
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:35.240]  private labeled with them. I'm not even doing a plug right now. I'm just showing how this
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:44.400]  backfires on them. So here it is. It hit me. They're calling him the trash man on the slate
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:48.760]  of the video. For those that don't know how broadcast TV works. When you have a clip, they'll
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:56.280]  put a rainbow color card at the front and the back. And that way folks picking up the
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:02.840]  feed or picking up the clip from other networks, other affiliates, they've got a scope that
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.800]  can look at that color bar and they can dial the scope off the colors they're sending out.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:13.680]  That shows you what color scheme they're broadcasting. So you can then match up your colors with
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:22.680]  theirs or change it if you want to. And you put the name of the clip or the subject file
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:28.800]  like in the NFL, it'd be post game highlights or it'd be year highlights or it'd be coming
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:33.720]  up. You have names of files. We have them here. We have the same stuff here. Even though
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:38.600]  we don't send clips out to a bunch of networks, still that's just how clips work. We can punch
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:44.680]  up the whole rainbow screen behind you right now if you'd like. NBC used to use a peacock
[01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:51.320]  and had all the colors and people would dial to that. But they're calling him the trash
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:58.960]  man. But what's the trash man do? They think that's an insult. Who is a trash man? He's
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:04.080]  a hard working person in sanitation that goes out, does a rough job with dogs attacking
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.160]  you and driving around with cars everywhere and hanging off that vehicle. That's a manly
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:13.160]  job and getting there and taking people's trash and throwing it in a big truck and smashing
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:18.480]  it and driving the landfill. That's a very honorable job. I think of a trash man as a
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:26.560]  very honorable, hard working job. See, I'm not an elitist, but the folks at MSNBC, to
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:33.440]  them the trash man's the lowest thing. He takes out their garbage. He is a garbage man.
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:42.680]  He's covered in garbage. He's dirty. He's down in the goblins' nest. What's trash
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:54.720]  man do? Trash man takes out the trash. So even their own attacks out of their own demonic
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:02.760]  mouths comes the truth. Out of the mouths of little babes. You're the trash man. They're
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:06.640]  literally Oscar the Grouch popped up out of the trash. Your cat's belong to me. Use the
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:13.520]  words I say. You're all racist. They're like dirty, hateful, degenerate, heroin-head comics
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:19.280]  or something on CNN MSNBC. I mean, they're just so reprobate, so nihilistic, so desperate,
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:26.120]  so unhappy, so annihilated. Did misery lose company? They're like, ah, the trash man.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:30.840]  Go to trash man, Ben. Yeah, the trash man said more stuff today. And then you hear what
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:39.080]  he said. Bring people together. Build the economy. Appreciate hard work and teachers
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:43.960]  and firefighters and police and farmers and our military. And let's all have honor again
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.760]  and let's come together. And then he's getting the economy going. And they're like, ah, shut
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:55.280]  up, you trash man, racist. Meanwhile, it's like a little evil satanic Oscar the Grouch
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:01.760]  on PCP popped up in the trash can. Have you noticed trash trash can man that you're being
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:12.080]  taken to the trash by the trash man? So I love it. We now have Trump's new name. He's
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:19.360]  the trash man. Here comes the trash man. He's up there early every morning. He's working
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:24.440]  late in the night. He's going into all the dangerous places and all the nice places.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:29.040]  He's going to every town, every house, but he's not like Santa Claus that doesn't exist.
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:35.320]  Suppose he brings you free stuff. That's a democratic party. He really is a trash man.
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:40.720]  He shows up. He pulls up that big stinking trash can full of baby diapers and rotten
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:45.040]  food and all the rest of the crowd. And he gets in there and he walks over and he dumps
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:50.880]  that right in there for you. And the glass and the dangerous stuff, all the things that
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.880]  are in there, he gets his hands dirty to clean up the garbage, to clean up the crap off the
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:02.080]  sidewalk.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:09.760]  They call him the trash man. I think that's his name. Donald Trump's the trash man showing
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:14.320]  up in a nice suit, right? And early clicking his heels saying, I'm ready to take that trash
[01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:21.160]  out for you. And you know what? He's been taking the trash out, destroying ISIS that Obama
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:27.820]  turned loose around the world, that Hillary funded, deporting record numbers of felons
[01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:31.440]  and criminals doing just what he said he did. They're not deporting little kids and people
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:36.000]  like that, unless they don't even have parents here. They're going after the criminals. 69%
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.920]  reduction in illegals coming across the first six months. You're like, that's racist. Really,
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:45.120]  Mexico will torture you if they catch you there illegally. They'll take all the money
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:49.720]  out of your wallet, but it's okay. The Mexico does it. Oh, some people have been deported
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:56.840]  up to 40 times, rapists, serial killers and Trump's doing his job. We're a country. We
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.720]  have borders. We're open. We want you to come here, but not if you're a criminal, not if
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:06.520]  you're a felon. And you know what? If you got leprosy, if you're going to come here,
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:09.880]  we're at least going to know you got leprosy and send you to a clinic under Obama. They
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:15.360]  let people in with leprosy and TB and everything else and didn't even treat them when the
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.680]  border patrol that people came wanting medical help saying, I have leprosy. I have leprosy.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:25.600]  Sometimes they were getting a leprosy case every day on the Texas border. I was told
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:31.200]  this by medical people, health department people said, I just think you were crazy,
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:36.280]  Alex. We're getting leprosy cases and told to be quiet about them. We've got whole wards
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:43.880]  of drug-resistant TB, leprosy, plague. You know they still got plague down in Guatemala.
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:47.440]  People coming out of Venezuela didn't used to have the plague. They used to be as rich
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:52.560]  as we were. They got plague down there because the sewage is running in the streets because
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:58.840]  the trashmen don't come anymore. Just like Seattle. I was like, that's not dog cramp
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:02.800]  on the ground. There was homeless CCs all over the place and I should have taken our
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:07.120]  cameras and shown it but I couldn't even do it. It would be like a homeless guy splayed
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:13.200]  out with urine all over the ground and piles of crap and nobody cares. Cops driving by
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:17.000]  and it wasn't that I was some angel. I couldn't help it even though they're total drug addicts.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:22.160]  I just couldn't help but give them money or take homeless in and say, do you want a sandwich?
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.640]  Do you want some food? And it was like a night and then while I'm buying them sandwiches,
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:30.000]  I got people going, F you Alex Jones, F you. They don't want to help those homeless.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.920]  They just want to see homeless so they feel better than them because they look all homeless
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:37.760]  and whacked out too. That's what it is. They need to give the liberal underclass somebody
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:42.800]  to look down on. That's why they got all the homeless there. They don't take care of them.
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:48.240]  I started figuring it all out. It's just like, man, these people are sick. We'll be back,
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:55.320]  ladies and gentlemen, with a live. I've got some key intel straight ahead. Stay with us.

[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:46.160]  15 years ago telling you Google was listening to you over the droid phones when they were
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:53.160]  first coming out. And now it's in mainstream news today. Paper, Google secretly recording
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:59.160]  you through your mobile. All confirmed. Oh my gosh. Isn't it amazing? Turns out what you're
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:06.160]  saying is valuable to those AI algorithms. Think about that. What if I put a microphone
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:11.660]  on your house to, quote, see what you wanted to buy from me so I knew who you were and
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:18.160]  all your secrets? And then they've got computers collating at no wonder Amazon run by the CIA.

[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:39.160]  that? I didn't know that because you are subconscious most of the time and your conscious can only
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:43.660]  focus on a tiny bit of your consciousness, but the computer is sitting there logging
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:52.160]  it all. It knows you better than your mama, your daddy, your greedy, greedy granny that
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:27:00.160]  go beep, beep, beep down the Sesame Street. Ain't no mountain high enough. Ain't no valley
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:06.160]  low enough to keep them from getting all your data. Well, it's okay because Bezos is liberal.
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:12.160]  I am Bezos. Oh, Apple has slave factories. Oh, that's all right. We're liberal. Hey, cool,
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:19.160]  you know, share a party, serves up, dude. Yeah. Oh, we're all real cool guys. Yeah.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:24.160]  We're all psychopaths. They're just sitting by going, how fast can we just kill all these
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:29.160]  people? The earth's going to be so nice when I can go thousands of square miles, not look
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:34.160]  at one of these subhumans. But we're getting rid of their families. We're getting rid of
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:38.160]  the strongest ones right now that we can't hire. Shutting them down and we'll have full
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:46.160]  control soon as if someone with that type of uncool attitude will ever be given the real
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.160]  level by God. You people are stupid. You're so blind, you think you're willing to exercise
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:57.160]  pure evil. And so you somehow are going to transcend us. When you have it transcended
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:03.160]  you sunk all the way to the bottom. And you're looking into the fishbowl going, look at those
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:08.160]  people there in hell, because you're already so cold and so devoid of God and so disconnected
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:15.160]  from reality that you don't even know what you've done. Do you know what you've done?
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:23.160]  You're guilty of attacking yourself. But cancer isn't conscious, isn't. It believes,
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:29.160]  even had a consciousness that it is transcended. It transcends the bounds of its world. It's
[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:37.160]  a God. It can do whatever it wants until the host is killed. The globalists are not symbiotic
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:50.160]  colony organisms. The globalists are cancer. A demonic, twisted, failed mutation in space,
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:29:06.160]  in time, a color. There's no color in a black hole. There's not even blackness. It's just
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:18.160]  silence, dead space. But an oozing oil slick kind of streams out behind it. It's a color,
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:31.160]  they all see it. It's like a rainbow, but not the rainbow. It's like a slime, a smell,
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:40.160]  a stench, a smell of failure, and the God of failure, the God of cancer. We'll be back.
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:08.160]  We'll be back.
[01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:57.160]  We'll be back.

[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:23.600]  went shot that of the eclipse and I went boy I sure wish I'd have gone outside
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:27.080]  for that because I've seen a few eclipses they were nothing like this but the way
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:30.440]  he shot it I guess it was a really good spot where he shot it for the middle of
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:35.800]  the country it looks like something out of a movie and then he added info wars
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:41.960]  calm into it and it just lets you know what a magic incredible universe we live
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:45.360]  in so we're gonna go in a moment the last five minutes of a great report they
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:50.340]  followed yesterday but I want to play that little intro piece with 2001 space
[01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:54.680]  odyssey music on the front of it here it is
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:02.640]  again for radio it's not as powerful but the song is always powerful look at
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:07.000]  that actually shot
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:24.560]  the last scale of yours I love it and it just gets better
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:28.280]  globalists are just here to test this for the next level and the challenges is
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:39.120]  gonna get more intense after that so good job to Gavin and Millie just they're
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:43.160]  so good in the field they're great here I just wish we could find more reporters
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:47.600]  like them I mean I'd hired 10 new reporters the problem is just going
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:50.520]  through all the resumes and the people and the rest of it there's so many great
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:56.160]  folks but and we all see the funding to do it but it is amazing now come up or
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:00.600]  actually show you the raw footage of it in there right here on air but the name
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:07.640]  of the video it's on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com right now the
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:14.080]  name of it will pull it up on screen is that it brings people together total
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:18.000]  eclipse the Sun brings humanity together and I think it really does because we
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.400]  all look at the same moon we all look at the same Sun our ancestors looked at it
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:25.960]  you've had the shared experiences we're the humans and the globalists believe
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:29.320]  they're breaking away from humans that they want to control the environment to
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:33.200]  such an incredible level that they're gonna change who they are because they
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:36.880]  believe they're ugly and fallen well that's because they're spiritually ugly
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:40.840]  and fallen if they had a connection to God they would realize that they don't
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:45.200]  need to exterminate everybody and merge with machines to be somebody they don't
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:49.000]  have to run everybody else's life and control everybody and surveil everybody
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.880]  to be somebody they could be somebody by actually being honorable and good and
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:59.880]  opening up that channel to the divine to God but they don't want that and
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:03.840]  meanwhile they got the antifa the bikers for Trump and other groups planning
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:12.160]  to protest Trump's Phoenix rally but look at that deceptive headline antifa's
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:16.920]  bikers for Trump and other groups planning to protest Trump's Phoenix
[01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:23.880]  rally well bikers for Trump aren't protesting Trump but that's Phoenix
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:29.320]  headline Phoenix Times headline who writes these it's like Trump's doing a
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:33.040]  campaign stop and everybody wishes he would come how dare the president even
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:37.160]  coming yeah and anybody in the military that like seem they'd have their
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:40.960]  security clearance taken yeah as you hear jack besovics and naval intelligence
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:45.280]  president like see yeah he's lost the security clearance you can't have a
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:51.720]  security clearance like president it's just a huge no-platforming shaming thing
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:56.560]  like we're all a bunch of cowards and like a bunch of leftist defecating on

[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:22.800]  around so they can look down on they love misery and then they want to point
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:25.760]  everybody else and just shout a bunch of lies we want a million a moment but

[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:05.880]  the president's mentally ill doesn't matter all the statistics all the
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:10.320]  university studies show liberals are nine times more likely to be mentally ill
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:15.520]  six times more likely to steal nine times more likely not to give the
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:24.000]  charity and depending on the study many many times to have less hygiene they're
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:32.000]  dirty lazy lion cheating stealing frauds and then they go and they bully other
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.680]  well-meaning people to go I guess I'm a liberal I guess I'm a progressive because
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:39.240]  I'm sure not the evil blue blood Republicans and I'm like of course you're
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:46.400]  not neither am I I am a real progressive I want to progress science I want more of

[01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:03.440]  time into the future with incredible adventure they don't want that they
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:08.240]  want to run your life the new feminist magazines I always told you they said
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:11.120]  this probably they're like we kill babies there's a kind of ritual for our
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:17.320]  freedom it's a sacrament kill your baby oh because it freaks out the
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:22.720]  Christians say it's the Satan we don't really mean that even though at night we
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:31.440]  got kids we can't dance control now that's the spirit
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:36.000]  pull up that photo I tweeted out last week or Debbie Washman Schultz and
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  Hillary it's in the photo I mean that's a real photo of them at a campaign
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:51.680]  Hillary's like and then Schultz is all just robbing stealing everything putting
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:55.880]  horrible hardcore radical Muslims in charges blow up churches enslave the
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:42:00.240]  women but women is slavery sell them on the slave ships they take little girls
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:04.080]  100 men rape them till they die and they're just like you say something to
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:07.760]  liberal they screw you we're gonna get you so of course we're doing that the
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:14.200]  Muslims were allied with them you'll never stop them you'll never stop us I
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:19.040]  actually had this top Pentagon globalist guy what was his name Thomas Barnett
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:23.600]  John Harmon heard it during a break years ago he was coming on he calls for
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:26.720]  world government because our military works for global government kind of
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:30.240]  trying to mainline the whole deal and he thought I was Alex S. Jones of the
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:34.160]  Shorenstein Center because that guy had a syndicated radio show his family used
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:40.400]  on the New York Times and he goes excuse me this is the Alex Jones of
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.720]  informers he was I'm not talking to him and I'm sitting there and I go Harman
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:47.360]  let me talk to him see patches the call-through I go listen defend your
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:51.880]  ideas just come on because you listen here you're never gonna win we're gonna
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:55.960]  defeat you I mean watch like you listen he was here for me like nope not doing
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:02.480]  I said listen we're gonna defeat you he goes you'll never defeat us I was like
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:08.760]  whoa Harman heard it he's like that's right because they just dial into this
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:15.360]  evil and it's a spirit they're just like and the reason I'm illustrating this
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:22.280]  is because that's who you're facing they don't want prosperity they want to
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:26.520]  screw you over so let's play this clip and go to Millie Arizona Congress when
[01:43:26.520 --> 01:43:32.640]  President Trump is clearly racist and just an abject liar no representative
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:40.560]  Ruben Gallego you lie here it is and to call the president of the United States
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:47.400]  a racist is a big statement yeah I kind of realized that and that's why I'm
[01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:50.440]  seeing it and then sad that I have to say it but look you have to look at other
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:56.360]  aspects of this one you know his Muslim ban where did that come from obviously
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:00.680]  that was it you know a campaign rally it's a statement that he tried to turn
[01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:08.040]  into policies and actually executing that again it's it's unfortunately we
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:11.360]  have to say it but at some point if somebody has been acting the same way
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:15.920]  since the 1970s particularly using racial animus for you whether political
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:20.120]  game whatever game it is what it is and the press may not want to admit it other
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:27.640]  politics may not want to see awards but this is who the president is and we have to see their vote amount or we have to figure out how to pen a man
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:35.040]  he says these are his own words he's the least racist person you've ever met he
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:38.760]  says a lot of things but look one we have to also admit that he's just an
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:45.040]  abject liar why don't you hit pause no one they never show where he says the
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:48.840]  racist stuff just like the me or it's it'll it's always in print edited
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:53.960]  together word continue that they're a racist but the man is like you know I
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:58.680]  apologize to the American public but we elected a racist as president he's
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:02.600]  irresponsible with his words you know I'm sure in his heart he doesn't think he
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:08.620]  is but look back since the 1970s and this is what you you have the guy up on
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:13.880]  high using the magic word racist no proof no nothing he's the liar using
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:20.680]  race so that guy's the racist the racist pig is representative Ruben Gallego
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:25.640]  he's a racist pig little wimpy pig up there you know trying to get us all
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:29.720]  fighting with each other what a joke let's bring Millie Weaver in just on the
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:34.320]  general hysteria being there at Charlottesville a week and a half ago
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:38.800]  everything you witness the ugliness of the globalist their lies and now those
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:43.840]  saying the beauty of that total eclipse the sun well we've seen all this division
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:47.720]  in the country right now and a lot of it's being perpetuated by the mainstream
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:51.400]  media and some of these deep state operatives that are trying to create
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:57.240]  the environment for civil unrest in the country to blame it on President Trump
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:01.640]  but I'll tell you what a lot of people all drove out from all around the United
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:06.600]  States to come and see the eclipse and so there were people from different areas
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:12.120]  and even the East Coast down there in Spring City Tennessee a little tiny
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:17.400]  town and so it's interesting and really cool to see everyone come together just
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:23.000]  in peace and harmony to witness a miraculous event and to actually see
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:28.440]  this eclipse now I will say this seeing the eclipse on camera is completely
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:33.520]  different from seeing it in person I was expecting to see something similar to
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:37.680]  what you see on film but the problem is is typically in order to film the
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:41.960]  eclipse you have to have filters of your camera because it's so bright and it'll
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:46.360]  blow out the lens but when you actually see it in real life like it's like the
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:51.440]  difference between seeing black and white television from the from the 60s
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:57.240]  versus seeing it now an HD with full color and everything it was amazing it
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:02.880]  was absolutely beautiful and profound so I'm just really I feel really blessed to
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:06.120]  have been able to go there and see it and if you actually look at our footage
[01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:12.840]  it's pretty bizarre but when the eclipse actually burst into the screen you can
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:18.960]  see a little bird or I think it's a dove flying across over the eclipse and
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:23.520]  Gavin actually slowed it down and you can actually see wings flapping and what's
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:30.400]  really interesting about that is the filters on the lenses only show really
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:35.800]  bright lights so I'm wondering how was this bird so bright you know it lit up I
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:40.120]  saw that because it almost looks like on there either a tiny bug or a bird but
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:44.520]  it's so small how would be picked up that like flies it spins up yeah like it's
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:49.720]  like it's warping off into the eclipse yeah so that was pretty interesting to
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:55.800]  see and it just it was a very amazing thing to see very spiritual experience
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:48:00.360]  and I'm just so happy I hope that maybe the nation can try to come together
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:05.400]  after you know all coming together like they did during the eclipse because that
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.480]  was just really nice to see and you know we are we are seeing this division in
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:13.760]  the country but I feel like a lot of the division we're seeing it's being created
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:19.400]  and it's being over exaggerated most Americans just want to be united and
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:23.040]  they want to go about their lives and live normal happy lives they don't want
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:28.040]  this this this warring and fighting that we're seeing in the country right now
[01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:34.200]  you guys put together an 11 minute piece it's on info wars.com we're also
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:38.760]  gonna post it on facebook.com that really shows this beautiful footage but
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:42.440]  here's the last five minutes of it that even though radio listeners can't see
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:48.160]  it we can pick up from your voice the excitement here it is well all in all it
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:52.200]  looks like people have come from all over the United States right now along
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:57.120]  this path that this eclipse is going to take where we can see the moon come and
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:02.880]  block out the sun and we will see this wonderful corona surrounding it and it's
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:06.840]  just going to be so amazing to see you guys this is very exciting and it just
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:10.880]  kind of speaks to some of the craziness that we're seeing right now in our
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:19.200]  country because you know this path takes a path directly dividing the nation in
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:23.800]  half and maybe this is an opportunity for us to all come together as a nation
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:29.680]  witness this wonderful whether it be a biblical event or just an amazing rare
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:36.600]  solar or celestial event it's an opportunity for us Americans to come
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:48.960]  together and witness some of the wonders of this world so we are nearing
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:53.480]  total eclipse right now and some pretty bizarre events are happening it is
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:58.800]  starting to get noticeably darker it looks almost like it's nighttime and
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:02.520]  you can hear the bugs have all come out the crickets have come out there's a
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:07.160]  cadence have come out and here it is guys we are witnessing the eclipse you can
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:29.040]  see right now
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:35.880]  wow what we are seeing right now is so unbelievably beautiful right now I mean
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:42.800]  it just looks out of this world it is so beautiful and everyone is just looking
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:47.800]  up mesmerized it looks like it's nighttime outside it it has drastically
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:59.640]  gotten cooler it's just amazing to see I'm looking at it on video right now and
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:04.000]  then I'm looking at it up in the sky and how beautiful it is in the sky
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.840]  greatly outweighs what you see on the camera you can't even capture even
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:13.920]  closely what you're seeing on the camera so what did you think of the eclipse it
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:19.040]  was one of the most incredible experiences in my life I drove here all
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:25.000]  the way from New Jersey and it was totally worth it so glad I did it it
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.720]  was awesome the most awesome thing I've ever seen in my life I've never
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:33.280]  witnessed one I'm 51 it's awesome I miss work for it and it was well worth
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:39.720]  every minute I'm glad you invited me what did you think of it I'm speechless I
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:44.920]  never seen anything like that either I hope I'm alive for the next one yes what
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:48.840]  do you think of it you can't put it into words you you see solar eclipses on
[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:54.480]  television and pictures and whatnot until you experience one personally I'm
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:59.800]  seriously it it just touches a person it touches a person doesn't it look so much
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:04.880]  different than what you see on film yes totally different it there's nothing to
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:08.680]  describe seeing it live you're sitting here and you're watching it the Sun is
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:14.040]  slowly disappearing and then it's totally covered and it's like it's just it
[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:18.520]  just puts you in awe of the universe it's awesome awesome just look up and
[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:21.600]  think how how far the difference is between the size of the Sun and the
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:25.360]  moon and how different the distances are and they come out from here to be the
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:28.920]  same size I don't try to tell me that's a random chance that's a creator showing
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:34.960]  off oh it was incredible it was spectacular thing I've ever seen I thought
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:40.640]  it was beautiful what did you think of it I want to cry it was it was very
[01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:45.320]  emotional see how the Sun was coming up it was it was it was great it was worth
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:50.720]  it and anybody who didn't get to see it I'm sorry it was miraculous and it just
[01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:54.720]  was like a spotlight shining down on you it was it was wonderful it's kind of
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:58.000]  interesting to look all the way around and you could it looked like a sunset or
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.080]  sunrise all the way 360 and also the crickets are all still chirping because
[01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:08.200]  they thought it was night for a while it was very cool the we also liked how the
[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:14.760]  shadows got very crisp it was totally in a lifetime adventure just to see that
[01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:19.200]  happen it was pretty great what do you think of it awesome no one I'm young and
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:48.200]  ought to see it was it worth it sure was so what is this here that you're showing it's a pair of binoculars that just made it a little device so that you can view it through the binoculars on a piece of white paper very cool yeah we drove three hours from Huntsville I'm just I'm really glad the globalists return the Sun I I think that Donald Trump helped with those negotiations
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:55.440]  and I'm glad we reached a good ending well all in all it was a miraculous event
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:54:00.520]  definitely something that came off as heavenly and out of this world and I
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:04.440]  wouldn't miss it to save my life if we have that opportunity again in my
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:11.560]  lifetime this is Millie weaver signing off for info wars dot com I want to make a
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:16.120]  few points here notice those gentlemen at the end showed their historical
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:21.840]  knowledge to our camera crew when they said oh I want to thank the globalists
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:28.600]  for returning the Sun because I'm sure Donald Trump had something to do with
[01:54:28.600 --> 01:54:33.760]  that negotiation and this is something that happens over and over again
[01:54:33.760 --> 01:54:37.320]  throughout history when people didn't understand science they would be told by
[01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:41.560]  the priesthood that the Sun won't come back unless you politically give us
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:46.720]  control of your lives it was offerings of food you name it and so early on
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:51.800]  elites learn to guard knowledge and not give the general public knowledge so
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:55.440]  that's one microcosm of all of this I've got a couple other points I want to
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:55:02.120]  make about this eclipse that have touched me personally but I wanted to get
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:07.480]  some other to be of use from Millie Millie on this as well well it was just
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:12.080]  so bizarre to see the different phenomena that happened the leaves had
[01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:15.560]  weird shadows of the eclipses all over the ground reflecting off the trees
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:21.040]  everything was brighter like the reflections off of things the light was
[01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:26.160]  so bright it actually hurt your eyes just walking around the Sun was really
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:30.800]  hot and beating down because it when the moon was coming into contact with the
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:35.720]  Sun it like creates like a reflection and it just gets really hot everything's
[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:39.160]  really bright and then when those shadows start coming in the shadows are
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:46.120]  really crisp and then when it gets dark that you hear the the crickets coming out
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:49.800]  and the bugs come out that come out at nighttime it looked like there was a
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:56.640]  sunset 360 around us so that's kind of how that that looked I was expecting it
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:02.360]  to get really dark like pitch black dark and no it's actually more like dusk and
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:06.240]  basically it looks completely different from what you see on camera you're
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:10.440]  essentially seeing like an x-ray on camera that's like an x-ray it's not
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:17.080]  even you see the full detail of the moon like a light blueish grayish moon with
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:23.120]  the blueish sky behind you know dark navy blueish light blue sky instead of
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:26.440]  just being a black circle and a corona around it it was blue it was more
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:30.920]  gorgeous let me make a few points here because this is a window as I say a
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:37.900]  rosetta stone a skeleton key into the universe in that I personally get so
[01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:41.160]  focused on fighting the globalist even though I say we should transcend them by
[01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:45.240]  looking at the universe around us our children all of God's incredible gifts I
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:49.400]  personally was so focused yesterday on fighting the New World Order that I
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:55.680]  didn't even go outside to see the eclipse myself I was just here on air not
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:57:00.560]  even covering the eclipse just wrestling with the New World Order trying to wake
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:05.280]  people up instead of going out and having the communal experience of not
[01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:09.360]  interfacing with the television and the matrix and the computers and this false
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:13.560]  creation but going out communally with all these millions of other fellow
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:19.200]  humans of every race color and creed all one race looking at this ancient
[01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:23.840]  spectacle together and I made this commitment to go see more beautiful
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:27.720]  things to spend more time with my family to more and more compartmentalized fight
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:31.960]  the globalist but then also learn to turn it off and go back to my humanity so I
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:36.400]  really dropped the ball but as an example of how focused I am so I'm sad
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:41.040]  about it but I'm proud of it but then also getting into the fact that you did
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:46.000]  see it in person versus the matrix of seeing it through a lens through a
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.280]  computer that's how the matrix in the computer silicon world in VR is a
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:54.280]  fraud you don't feel the air the crickets you don't feel that intense heat
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:57.700]  and then it cool off and get cold then it get hot again or share it with other
[01:57:57.700 --> 01:58:02.120]  people or hear their voices or smell their pheromones or have your little
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:05.680]  boy that I could hear you had there in the background looking up and seeing
[01:58:05.680 --> 01:58:10.040]  that and experiencing that for yourself it just shows you how the real world
[01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:14.480]  this dimension is the real world not the false ones they've built what was it
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:19.280]  like for your son he was amazed he was like moon moon and he was pointing up
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:25.080]  and smiling and everyone was just in awe of it it was beautiful blue moon and
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:29.120]  there was the month yet with her child looking up together into the universe
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:34.200]  into the future but also standing in the present with the past beneath us all in
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:37.680]  great unison together with a little pathetic globalist trying to be God
[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:43.020]  running around trying to dumb us down so they could be God over a throng of

[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:12.400]  it would be right in line with the eclipse yesterday I think it's good to
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:17.480]  look back on the eclipse and our shared humanity and it's very touching I feel a
[02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:24.800]  sense of kinship with Gavin Wentz and Millie Weaver and other son and all of
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:30.720]  this shared event together and the majesty and the giganticness of it and
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:34.240]  it's only a tiny microcosm of the hundreds of billions of chronicle
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:38.960]  galaxies that are already out there in this incredible spectrum that we're all
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:43.040]  living in the third dimension the most stable dimension with all these other
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:47.480]  dimensions above us dimensions below us really humanity on a launch pad to the
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:51.960]  future already doing godlike things people five thousand years ago would see
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:56.360]  what we've already done is godlike but we have that the mind of children but the
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:00.880]  power of the gods of Olympia and again there are people that would rob that
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:06.280]  future from us I just ask humanity how can you let these people have control
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:11.440]  they're desperate and freaking out right now because it is the crying whales of
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:15.680]  dying animals as they realize they're never going to fully enslave us they're
[02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:20.680]  only applying the pressure that will help humanity transcend Millie well
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:25.880]  what's actually cool is this eclipse went west and east and there's gonna be
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:30.600]  another eclipse that's a good news for those of you guys who missed it in 2024
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:35.360]  this one will be going south and north and it actually will be coming through
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:39.880]  Austin Texas so that's a bright side right there for those of you who had
[02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:44.440]  missed it because they are rare events and it's kind of interesting that it's
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:49.960]  gonna make a cross directly in the middle of America I think the middle point
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:54.960]  for the crosses somewhere in Missouri but the whole thing has just been so
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:02:02.760]  wonderful to see and the amount of unity and just the spirit the feeling that you
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:05.800]  know was there with all those people who came from all over I saw people from
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:11.320]  New Jersey even from the Boston area everybody from all around the United
[02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:16.000]  States people from Florida all came to that little tiny town in Tennessee to
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:21.320]  stand together and witness something great witness nature and witness what
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:27.200]  the world we live in is like and and a miracle that you can see that the
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:32.360]  creator has put forward for us and like I was saying it was so different in person
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:36.880]  versus in camera and that's why you saw some of those people's reactions where
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:40.240]  they're saying this is absolutely beautiful
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:49.920]  yeah I heard somebody getting really exciting out there
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:52.960]  somebody outside your car maybe we should talk to them mainly it's just
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:56.120]  beautiful hearing you describe all this and again sharing this human
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:59.480]  experience together that's why the globalists are obsessed with getting us
[02:02:59.480 --> 02:03:03.200]  out of nature and into these false systems people aren't having barbecues
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:07.760]  they're not outside anymore you walk by people's houses it's glowing blue I walk
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:11.120]  around on the green belt at night by my house and I can look up to another
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:15.480]  neighborhood where there's golf courses and all I see is glowing blue and I'll
[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:18.960]  walk along and look in people's houses from you know 100 yards away and I can
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:22.880]  see big jumbo TVs and to be one thing if you've got knowledge from TV or watch
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:26.520]  the movie sometimes on your TV I'm not saying it's pure evil I'm saying the way
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:32.000]  it's been deployed is sucking us out of reality and bringing us into this matrix
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.680]  but we're using television right now to hopefully get folks to spend less time
[02:03:35.680 --> 02:03:41.480]  watching it and more time outdoors definitely and it was a great thing for
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:45.720]  families to all come together and be able to see this and the fact that the
[02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:49.800]  path was cutting the United States in half a lot of people were thinking well
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:54.560]  is this a biblical prophecy or what is this and then you have people on the
[02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:57.640]  other hand who were saying oh well this is just science and we're out here
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:03.800]  witnessing an amazing planetary event and people saying it's just science or
[02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:06.800]  saying they're the priesthood they have all the knowledge and knowledge is
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:11.320]  stopped obviously it's all science and as we learn more science we learn much
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:15.840]  of the old fables and things were abstract projections or archetypes of
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:22.640]  greater truths that people were trying to understand exactly I just hope that my
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:28.240]  feeling I got out of this is we need to work hard to create unity in the country
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:33.440]  and get this division away because to experience such a horrific event in
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:37.640]  Charlottesville and then experience such a beautiful and miraculous event with
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:42.440]  people all coming together and loving each other it really spoke like we need
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:46.280]  to create unity exactly because again they create the disunity hoping we play
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:55.040]  along with it they're the media they're the enemy you deserve a deep restful

[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:07.880]  tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign
[02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:12.560]  air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own
[02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:18.320]  air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:23.280]  pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy

[02:07:53.800 --> 02:08:10.000]  before America can be great again she must be free again you're listening to
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:21.800]  the Alex Jones show listening to Millie we were earlier was very powerful
[02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:26.480]  describing seeing the total eclipse of the sun with her own two eyes with her
[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:32.640]  son versus seeing when it looks like on a camera I've talked to so many genetic
[02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:36.440]  engineers and they say having the genetic code even having the CRISPR
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:40.080]  system being able to edit it in lifetime is like having a photo of a bingal
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:46.440]  tiger versus the actual bingal tiger so humanity has incredible technology and
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:50.360]  we interface together through this technology but still all the studies
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:55.920]  show it's making us weaker stupider slower as we're removed from the natural
[02:08:55.920 --> 02:09:01.440]  environment seeing the eclipse together versus seeing it on television two
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:05.360]  entirely different things because it's obviously not just visual it's also
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:09.520]  hearing the birds start to sing and go to sleep and the crickets get awake and
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:13.560]  start playing their violins and and and hearing the laughter of children and
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:20.560]  witnessing it for yourself and smelling you know the fresh-cut grass out there in
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:26.360]  the park and then physically seeing it the moon is blue and the coronas
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:32.200]  actually almost electric green and it's like I never saw this before I saw it
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:36.200]  on television and it was totally different because you weren't seeing an
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:39.840]  eclipse you were seeing a digital facsimile of it and even with our
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:44.600]  incredible technology it was nothing close to the real thing
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:50.560]  powerful now joining us is Harry Dent formerly worked with bank capital really
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:54.800]  smart economists best-selling author Harry Dent.com he's made a lot of
[02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:57.680]  accurate predictions and he's been predicting the last few years that we
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:02.120]  would see an economic downturn in the economy we've seen that many areas of
[02:10:02.120 --> 02:10:05.840]  the world I obviously want him to be wrong not because he's not a smart guy
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:09.280]  or I like him I understand it's all a big bubble I understand demographic
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:13.200]  cliffs I understand what he's saying is dead on but we've been so tied down by
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:18.000]  globalism and artificial systems and regulations and all this that if we could
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:21.680]  get rid of Obamacare we could cut taxes and we could cut regulations the
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:25.680]  economy would come soaring back and I said that a year ago you know months
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:29.880]  before Trump even won the election and Dent said well they've got a few tricks
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:35.320]  left I guess but he said I'm thinking push it much further Ron Paul agrees
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:39.260]  with him and says when the economy goes down it's not Trump's fault but that he
[02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:43.360]  thinks there could be a 50% correction very very soon now I'm not trying to say
[02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:47.720]  that's gonna happen because you know they even blame me and daily beasts in
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:51.080]  places they went to the New York Stock Exchange they said the market went up and
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:54.600]  they said we tracked it back to Alex Jones when he played that clip of the FBI
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:58.840]  director saying former director at the time saying that Trump never asked him
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:06.680]  to obstruct justice and that made the stock market go up well because we played
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:10.120]  it they were gonna ignore it in the media folks picked it up Rush Limbaugh picked
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:14.120]  it up Fox picked it up but before they even did Wall Street picked it up and
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:20.680]  the market went up so I want to be real careful about this about bragging it's
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:25.800]  just a fact we I mean I happen to know the strategy for Afghanistan and I want
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:28.920]  to tell the listeners don't worry Trump really means to pull out but to do it
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:32.120]  it's got to look like we're building up as you see a lot of folks moving around
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:37.120]  that's really a pullout to make them sue for peace use Pakistan via India putting
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:40.520]  pressure on them to actually have an economic deal Trump's actually offering
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:44.680]  Afghanistan a great deal and is planning to pull out the next year or two that is
[02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:49.040]  the timetable now the bullet generals manipulate him who knows but we've
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:53.240]  defeated ISIS basically in six months seven months so Trump's really
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:56.520]  delivering the question is can he keep the generals from expanding it like they
[02:11:56.520 --> 02:12:00.240]  want to do in Syria I don't know but I almost want to get up here and say hey
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:04.480]  don't worry I called a bunch of my contacts they confirmed what I was
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:09.560]  suspecting Trump never tells the enemy what he's gonna do so he's saying we're
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:13.040]  gonna build up that's actually the cover for the pullout then I talked to some
[02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:16.760]  other folks this morning or smart that contacts they said that's the word we'll
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:20.720]  see if that's the case so there's my preface with Harry Dent Harry Dent comm
[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:25.240]  joining us to get into the state of the economy the state of the world and what
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:31.720]  he thinks is really about to happen cuz I want to see you proven wrong well let
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:35.680]  me comment on the eclipse real quick I've got a good friend in London a guy
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:39.800]  that came up to me in a presentation it said you know the last time we had an
[02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:45.320]  eclipse like this that was this strong total eclipse and cut right across all
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:49.440]  the way across the United States good eclipses don't hit everywhere they hit
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:54.440]  in specific areas he said this happened at the beginning of the Civil War I also
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:13:00.280]  look back the last one like this also happened in 1918 when we had this big
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:06.560]  influenza pandemic and stuff that killed like tons of people and and affected
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:10.480]  20 I was about to say they made fun of me this week saying that generally these
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:16.680]  are a lot of times are seen as harbors of war doom calamity well and usually
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:20.000]  turning points sometimes they can be positive but more often than not I mean
[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.920]  we've been in a very strong economy so it means a new beginning something big
[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:29.840]  across roads yes these I mean again these don't hit a place like the United
[02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:35.200]  States this solid very often and when they do it usually is a sign that it's
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:38.160]  gonna be big by the way you're not into mumbo jumbo you I mean your your
[02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:41.160]  charts been proven some of the most accurate out there dealing with even
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:45.160]  not just demographics but sunspots and even the agents do this no one really
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:49.480]  knows how it works it's not mumbo jumbo it's really something's going on I mean
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:53.080]  what is it with the sunspots let's continue down this this line well you
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:57.120]  know I mean sunspots are a real thing they go up and down in approximate 10
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:02.760]  year cycles but they can vary from 8 to 13 a guy named Ned Davis had a 10 year
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:08.160]  decennial cycle for many decades and it worked every the first two to three years
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:13.680]  of every decade saw recessions and stock crashes early 60s early 70s early 80s
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:18.520]  early 90s early 2000 and then it wasn't there an eclipse the day Christ was
[02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:26.440]  killed yes right 30 the day they did finally document that and also the key
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:30.560]  turning point in the Revolutionary War for George Washington and they said
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:33.280]  well they've been losing everything and they said we think this is Providence
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:36.880]  now I'm getting freaked out because I mean I was thinking because they
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:39.880]  confirmed for the through the Roman historians that it was true and through
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:44.040]  Josephus the Jewish historian but then now with computer maps they know the day
[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:47.880]  they hung Christ high on Golgotha they got really freaked out because boom
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:54.120]  total eclipse right over Christ hanging can you imagine the sky's got dark so I
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:14:58.200]  mean this sort of stuff again people think you know sunspots look they go up
[02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:03.760]  and down the biggest corner if you look at the economy regardless of anything I
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:07.880]  say about demographics and other trends and cycles we get a recession about
[02:15:07.880 --> 02:15:12.960]  every 10 years sometimes it's eight sometimes it's 11 that's the sun 2008
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:17.320]  yeah it goes up and it brings more energy to everybody and people get more
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:22.240]  optimistic and when it goes down things go down and and I look I when when I
[02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:26.120]  finally got turned on to the Sunspot cycle thing by one of the largest fund
[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:35.520]  managers in the country I went back 150 years 88% of the recessions as far back
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:39.320]  as we can track them in this country happen in the downside of the Sunspot
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:46.200]  cycle and if you look at major financial crises like 2008 9 or 73 to 74 and 30 to
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:52.720]  32 and stuff 100% 11 out of 11 major financial crises happen when this
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:57.720]  Sunspot cycle was pointing down and it is pointing down and demographic cycles
[02:15:57.720 --> 02:16:02.400]  are pointing down geopolitical cycles have been pointing down since 9-11 I've
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:07.920]  been tracked I tracked those back 200 years and now this is a great chart we
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:12.360]  have in addition to the kind of whole debt deleveraging and bubbles bursting
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:16.760]  I've talked about in bubbles all week first there's no zero exception I'll tell
[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:19.760]  you what's scary Ron Paul agrees with you that's what I said earlier he's
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:22.600]  big this is not Trump's fault he's doing a lot of good stuff trying to get the
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:27.960]  economy going but but but he's saying he says we're overdue as he called it
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:33.160]  himself there's no way to get out of a bubble easily they have to deleverage
[02:16:33.160 --> 02:16:37.800]  stocks have to go down real estate has to go down banks have to fail companies
[02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:42.760]  have to fail and reorganize but what I'm saying now and over the last year is
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:49.360]  that we don't just have a 1930s like debt deleveraging coming we have the
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:55.560]  greatest political social revolution since democracy itself in the late 1700
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:17:02.520]  democracy met industrial revolution and free market capitalism I Adam Smith the
[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:07.400]  first oh and only great economists in history as far as I see and we've been
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:11.760]  booming ever since because this is a perfect partnership you know democracy
[02:17:11.760 --> 02:17:15.360]  is more inclusive like the lady you were talking to earlier and capitalism
[02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:21.800]  rewards meritocracy and innovation and survival of the fittest and it took
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:26.680]  these two to come together to really make the magic juice and now we're
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:32.960]  killing and globalization has been booming since World War two the first
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:38.640]  surge was from the mid 1800s into World War one when we had steamships and then
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:42.560]  railroads to facilitate trade so globalization took off for the first
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:48.200]  time in history and guess what globalization retreated from 1913 to
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:54.320]  1945 like 32 33 years I think we're seeing the same thing now this whole
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:59.840]  backlash Trump hit it on the head when he said look it's not the 1% that's the
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:02.800]  problem even though they are and the everyday person doesn't like the fact
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:06.320]  that the top point one to one percent are running away with all the wealth which
[02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:10.680]  they have been in the last few decades they're more worried about immigrants
[02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:13.760]  competition with immigrants and illegal emigrants they're more worried about
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:19.800]  foreign competition and labor and but they they really didn't like globalization
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:23.360]  like globalization made everybody prosperous for a while now now a lot of
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:29.800]  people are saying no it's more harm than good Trump hit that cord one the kind of
[02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:35.880]  rural vote by I mean he didn't win like 60 to 40 he won like 80% in a lot of
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:40.520]  rural counties and that's what tipped the election and that's why the polls
[02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:43.720]  didn't pick it up they're pulling people in cities and stuff they don't they're
[02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:48.160]  not talking to people out let's expand on that because the elites really want
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:52.000]  him gone even though they're able to defeat Trump which I think will happen
[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:57.400]  now the public's mad at them he it's not Trump he's just a manifestation of the
[02:18:57.400 --> 02:19:01.360]  fact the public's rejected them then how does that tie into all the forecast
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:06.680]  showing a cliff could we escape it with the end of Obamacare with a tax cut
[02:19:06.680 --> 02:19:11.680]  because it seems for now Trump is stage it off a little bit Japan has been
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:16.800]  stimulating on a level that's three times and from three times longer than
[02:19:16.800 --> 02:19:20.440]  anything Europe the United States has done and they still average zero growth
[02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:23.920]  of the last two or three decades you can't yeah some of these things will
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:27.840]  make things better of course if you can cut health care cars of course if you
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:31.320]  cut taxes that's going to be good for business it's not going to expand our
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:36.480]  economy because businesses already have too much capacity and if you think we
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:43.320]  don't have too much capacity go to China sure it's the problem of how
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:48.080]  good we've got it with production going on we're actually transcending you know
[02:19:48.080 --> 02:19:52.160]  being able to work but then that hurts into lazy slobs so what happens by now

[02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:05.040]  material that he's been researching Harry dent dot com this this eclipse
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:07.680]  information is intriguing don't get into the state of the economy where they've
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:10.840]  been worried things it's going because there was a total eclipse of the Sun
[02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:16.440]  geographically over Israel and Golgotha the day he was killed they've now
[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:20.000]  proven with mathematics and computers that indeed the historians were correct
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:23.680]  the Bible's right it happened right before the Civil War started it happened
[02:25:23.680 --> 02:25:27.040]  with the Spanish flu started it's normally a harbinger of really big
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:31.840]  change doom destruction you name it the ancients always thought that now it's
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:36.560]  not mumbo jumbo that this keeps happening where the solar flares we now
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:39.720]  know like the ancients said actually caused the rain they caused nuclei when
[02:25:39.720 --> 02:25:42.360]  they come into the atmosphere they thought it was just potash now they know
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:45.880]  the ancients were right the sunspots are associated with rain they didn't know
[02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:49.960]  why they just knew it sunspots are associated with booms and bust so what
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:55.280]  does this big massive once in a lifetime last time we had this was 1776 at the
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:58.840]  start of the war and was seen as a harbinger of our victory so Harry dent
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:04.040]  what does this signify I've been saying for the last year and now the media
[02:26:04.040 --> 02:26:08.480]  saying I've been saying we have a civil war coming it's not maybe you know
[02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:13.760]  cannons and stuff but the red states and the blue states the right and the
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:17.960]  left just as we just saw in Charlottesville have nothing in common I've
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:24.840]  got research from Pew that I published last year it showed from 2004 into now
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:30.360]  the left and Democrats have gotten more far left and the republics have
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:34.040]  gotten more far right and so there's no common ground that's why we can't get
[02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:39.400]  any bills passed in Congress and I really think I mean we I've never seen this
[02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:44.280]  much polarization and politics in social values you do have to go back to the
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:47.720]  civil war to see this even in the great depression when the rich were rich like
[02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:51.480]  now and the everyday person wasn't making much progress then we had a great
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:56.560]  depression and 25% unemployment people were still not this much at each other's
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:01.640]  throat so you know we I think this is global I mean why do we have wars in the
[02:27:01.640 --> 02:27:04.720]  Middle East where are the places we have wars in the Middle East where there's
[02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:10.200]  Shias and Sunnis together in the same country like Iraq and Syria and Iran and
[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:13.840]  Afghanistan we don't have wars in the rest of the Muslim world so much these
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:18.680]  two groups are different and they can't get along so why not break into
[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:23.960]  political entities where people have more common values I really think that we
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:29.560]  either gonna approach or have some sort of split between red America and blue
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:34.440]  America and I think as long as we can still trade and have a large economic
[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:39.640]  zone and stuff and maybe a common dollar I think this would be better because I
[02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:43.720]  don't see any way to bring these two together sure but here's the problem the
[02:27:43.720 --> 02:27:48.800]  the parasitic left wants to colonize and is taking over Austin I'm not a right
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:51.840]  winger I'm a libertarian their authoritarians they tried to beat me up
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:55.360]  everywhere and physically attacked me last week in Seattle I mean it's like a
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:28:00.560]  cult our soldiers were getting attacked less on average in Iraq I mean that they
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:05.440]  saw me as the devil they believe their own propaganda they have gone crazy it is
[02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:09.360]  the left saying kill the president lying about everything I believe that they've
[02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:13.720]  gone completely insane so how would we ever split off because they won't do that
[02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:19.120]  they'll come here and make us their slaves make us their titty mama what I
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:26.200]  think if they rearrange the Middle East and in the Iran in these shea part of
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:30.680]  Iraq got together and they're right next to each other and then the Sunni parts
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:34.000]  of Iran and Iraq got together I don't think you have big warfare over there as
[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:37.360]  long people in their own communities with people like them why would they
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:40.560]  most the war in the Middle East is creating the countries and sticking them
[02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:44.240]  together when before they were split up along religious and ethnic lines you're
[02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:49.480]  absolutely right I'm just saying the blue the red would love to let the losers go
[02:28:49.480 --> 02:28:52.760]  all kill each other and crap on the streets and Satan worship and fall off
[02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:56.440]  the edge of the earth but that you said they always follow us around
[02:28:56.440 --> 02:29:02.640]  demographically statistically they need blood we don't need them okay let me
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:07.400]  throw another thing in and then you just pull up this stock chart I have it we
[02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:11.240]  have this much polarization and an economy that's still doing pretty well
[02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:15.960]  imagine if we go into a deep recession like 2008 and I think it's gonna be
[02:29:15.960 --> 02:29:19.920]  deeper because the government's just pumped up the economy artificially there
[02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:23.320]  is no demographic let's stay there stay there you absolutely right when this
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:27.400]  thing goes belly up which it will no matter what Trump does long-term I
[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:30.440]  think you probably longer than things I think I've been proven right last year

[02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:09.280]  and the GCN radio network you know I hate to say I'm right again but last night
[02:33:09.280 --> 02:33:13.320]  and this morning I laid out that the president's actually planning to pull
[02:33:13.320 --> 02:33:18.040]  out of Afghanistan but he's gonna do it with a big force so that as people are
[02:33:18.040 --> 02:33:23.160]  being pulled out it basically looks like actually more coming in because of
[02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:27.880]  all the movement going on and that they're brokering a deal between India
[02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:31.920]  and Pakistan using India to put pressure on Pakistan and then using
[02:33:31.920 --> 02:33:37.400]  economic offers to Afghanistan to then sure up the government and get rid of
[02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:41.560]  the al-qaeda ISIS problem something bipartisanly the globalists have been
[02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:46.240]  using as a destabilizing force and a program phase two to take over Europe
[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:50.440]  and destabilize it and Trump said we're just getting rid of that whole plan
[02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:54.920]  that's done so you're seeing a whole new plan I've been watching Rex Tillerson
[02:33:54.920 --> 02:33:57.880]  during the breaks and reading the transcripts he's basically saying that
[02:33:57.880 --> 02:34:02.640]  on television right now now how did I know this was the plan because Trump's
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:06.120]  doing stuff with what he calls I love a term he used last night never heard
[02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:13.000]  before moral realism your moral person but then your realist about it and you're
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:16.920]  not all Machiavelli just because you can think all Machiavelli and doesn't mean
[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:20.400]  you go do it just because you could come up with some schemes and then
[02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:25.240]  execute them how about just do what's normal and natural and good and then you
[02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:30.200]  win just because you're so successful already so that's what I believe the
[02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:33.600]  plan was then I made a few phone calls last night I talked to some fellows I
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:38.680]  know here also at the office that have a lot of contacts and I said what is it
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:42.800]  you've heard this is they also the same thing it's a pullout but an actual
[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:46.480]  plan to wipe out the Al Qaeda ISIS scum instead of leaving them there like
[02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:49.480]  Obama did in Iraq when they pulled out and gave them all the weapons on purpose
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:54.280]  so that's coming up with dr. Steve Pachinic I don't know his view but I
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:57.320]  know he's got a lot of contacts as well one of the co-founders dealt before it's
[02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:00.800]  that's selling author in psychological operations for different operations in
[02:35:00.800 --> 02:35:05.520]  the CIA and State Department co-authored stuff with Tom Clancy will get his take
[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:10.960]  on this and the big question is can he control the generals and actually have
[02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:16.160]  them execute this plan like they've actually done crushing ISIS in seven
[02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:20.760]  months doing what he said he do they want to start a wider war and knock out
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:24.700]  Assad and destabilize more stuff Trump really has a stabilization plan that's
[02:35:24.700 --> 02:35:28.160]  actually good for everybody including us and he said we're gonna go on there
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:32.760]  economically and get all the rare earth minerals yeah and they'll want us to come
[02:35:32.760 --> 02:35:36.720]  in there so we'll talk to him just in a few minutes but going back to Harry Dent

[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:12.560]  five three three one three nine okay going back to our economist friend Mr.
[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:16.600]  Danny's got a few more charts to show you and talking about a really bleak
[02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:20.360]  situation saying what happens when the economy goes under and America's already
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:24.640]  basically been put into a civil war destabilization position by certain
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:31.400]  parties well I think okay things are just polarized now if the economy goes
[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:34.800]  down there's much higher unemployment and stocks are crashing and people are
[02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:40.120]  losing wealth and the real estate and our homes going down like in 2008 or how
[02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:44.120]  much more polarized are things going to be it I hate to say it's one reason I'm
[02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:48.640]  in Puerto Rico right now they've been in a recession for 10 years and there's no
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:53.960]  polarization here you don't have that same sort of thing so if they can bring
[02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:57.920]  up the stock chart I always want to make this point because every time I'm in the
[02:37:57.920 --> 02:38:03.040]  mainstream media like CNBC and financial stations they're always like oh
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:08.600]  this isn't a bubble well if you look at we've had four bubbles now 87 this is a
[02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:14.840]  bubble boom just like the early 1900s that entered in the roaring 20s and then
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:20.120]  the Great Depression we had a bubble in 87 40% crash in two weeks most of it in
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:25.920]  two days then we had a bubble the tech bubble into early 2000 big crash then we
[02:38:25.920 --> 02:38:31.360]  had the next bubble in the 2007 not as big bigger crash and now we've got the
[02:38:31.360 --> 02:38:35.400]  greatest bubble of all I mean all these experts are saying oh this isn't a bubble
[02:38:35.400 --> 02:38:39.480]  because stocks are not as overvalued as they were in early 2000 and the tech
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:44.040]  bubble the tech bubble was in every fundamental trend that I study was a
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:49.640]  hundred percent technology booming geopolitical cycle very positive
[02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:55.000]  demographics the strongest stage of the baby boom spending cycle and the sun's
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:01.040]  hot cycle was hot during that all those things and then then it cracked so this
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:06.120]  bubble has to burst I mean real estate is so expensive that most people can't
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:09.080]  afford it especially the young millennials coming in I just saw an
[02:39:09.080 --> 02:39:13.560]  article Hong Kong is the most expensive real estate market in the world when you
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:17.960]  compare it to income as it's all of China but especially Hong Kong guess what
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:21.960]  they're selling now in Hong Kong for poor young people trying to work and make
[02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:28.840]  a living 61 square foot closet condo 61 square feet that's a bed that folds down
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:34.080]  and in a little toilet and a sink in a little dresser that's your house that's
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:37.200]  what people can afford there sure so as they put people into this pressure
[02:39:37.200 --> 02:39:40.200]  cooker and his Amazon builds its new buildings where even gets its employees
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:44.600]  money to live in Amazon buildings they're triple the cost but they basically
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:48.400]  make them live there as the pressure cooker goes up when do we get the young
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:53.280]  millennials and folks actually blame you know the top 10 of 1% the parasitic
[02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:56.960]  fake liberal globalist instead they're trying to get their own people to blame
[02:39:56.960 --> 02:40:00.520]  free market as if free markets the reason this is happening to them when
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:05.000]  like you said it's artificiality that's causing it yeah yeah we don't if we had
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:08.760]  free markets we wouldn't be in this mess because it's the government that
[02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:12.480]  every time the economy goes down it doesn't let the economy rebalance and
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:16.880]  flush out but Trump has said Trump has said real estate is too high then they
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:20.440]  say he's trying to plunge the market when he's just being honest about it but
[02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:26.000]  then if we do let it plunge that hurts us too so what do we do well I need to
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:30.200]  say it real estate has to come down and that's gonna hurt banks and lenders and
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:33.520]  it's gonna hurt people who own real estate I don't own any real estate
[02:40:33.520 --> 02:40:38.440]  except an island off of Puerto Rico I'm renting here in super duper condo in
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:42.800]  San Juan because I don't want to own real estate my island places my getaway
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:47.720]  also is moving from 25 acre to five acre zoning so it could drop in half and
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:52.800]  I'd still be ahead because now I got five lots instead of one so so I have an
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:58.480]  owned real estate since late 2005 because we did predict the real estate crash
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:41:03.320]  in late 2005 when everybody said oh this isn't a bubble bubbles or bubbles they
[02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:08.720]  go up exponentially they get crazy they get so let me ask you how long till you
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:12.520]  think this bubble is gonna pop and and look I think you've been saying any time
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:16.240]  now for a year or so hasn't Trump stayed that off with with the regulation cuts
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:21.680]  yeah well number one today first of all we ran an infographic before the
[02:41:21.680 --> 02:41:26.800]  election saying why Trump was more likely to win than the poll said then
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:30.400]  when he won and the markets went up and said they went down overnight they
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:34.120]  crashed overnight but they went soaring up the next day on high volume and I and
[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:38.880]  I came out and said to our subscribers hey I'm sorry this bubble ain't burst and
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:44.040]  yet we got at least 20% this is a real rally because the markets would like to
[02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:49.200]  see cuts and taxes cuts and regulations and they do believe we can get 4% of
[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:54.000]  growth again I do not believe that's possible in this high debt declining
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:59.360]  demographic stage of our economy but I told people look we we're gonna go up
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:04.720]  20% well we're getting close to that I don't think we're there yet at this point
[02:42:04.720 --> 02:42:09.160]  the rally starting to show some some aging sign but I I'm guessing a few
[02:42:09.160 --> 02:42:13.920]  months from now I do think this is gonna peak and I do think of you know
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:20.240]  before I showed three cycles a 250 year cycle back the American Revolution 84
[02:42:20.240 --> 02:42:24.560]  year populist movement cycle and a 28 year financial cycle these things are
[02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:30.480]  all coming together right in late 2017 right on this eclipse so I think
[02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:33.080]  something that I'll tell you the biggest sign in me how it's real simple
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:37.040]  Janet Yellen comes out I don't know a month or so ago and said oh the banks
[02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:40.520]  are now in great shape and I don't think we'll see a financial crisis for the
[02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:44.440]  rest of our lifetime that is the classic sign that's what Irving Fisher the
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:49.000]  leading economist in nine two months not even God can say this shit no no no I
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:52.400]  hear you but you've got all the new science all the new technology all the
[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:55.880]  new innovations and and big regulations being cut off of us and
[02:42:55.880 --> 02:43:00.920]  exuberance maybe salmon can swim upstream maybe exuberance and people
[02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:04.440]  knowing that the big banks want to you know kind of block the stock market to
[02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:10.120]  scuttle Trump maybe we can overpower him but I agree all the classical points all
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:14.480]  the signatures are saying you're right Ron Paul says it's coming but it's not
[02:43:14.480 --> 02:43:18.800]  Trump's fault we'll see who's right unfortunately or fortunately very very
[02:43:18.800 --> 02:43:23.720]  soon thank you mr. Dent okay thank you Alex there you go folks a smart guy I'm
[02:43:23.720 --> 02:43:26.920]  at a lot of accurate predictions you know the top guys for he left main capital
[02:43:26.920 --> 02:43:32.000]  smart cookie and Ron Paul agrees with him now another smart guy that predicted
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:35.720]  the EU would break up to me ten years ago on air that predicted the power would
[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:40.520]  devolve back to the south in the Midwest and to the southwest and away from the
[02:43:40.520 --> 02:43:45.800]  east and west coast but the Democrats would become a you know side a political
[02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:51.200]  party of mental patients that's now happening but also he's worked a lot with
[02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:55.520]  the Pentagon in planning and things Dr. Steve Pachinik Steve Pachinik.com needs
[02:43:55.520 --> 02:43:59.720]  no introduction I was sitting there watching last night knowing that for
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:03.000]  months Trump's were having meetings every week had meetings last week at Camp
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:08.040]  David to finally discuss what he would do and I might take away from it is is
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:12.120]  that he's planning a very strong retreat or a true build down they always
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:15.280]  claim they're gonna build down they never do but he's first gonna actually take
[02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:19.080]  out the real opposition instead of playing with it like the globalists have
[02:44:19.080 --> 02:44:22.200]  been doing to then bring in a real economic deal that will benefit the
[02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:26.480]  United States India and Pakistan but that if Pakistan doesn't want to play
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:30.480]  ball then he's gonna really use India and others to basically crush them
[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:34.620]  economically and start playing hardball now I know Dr. Pachinik has a lot of
[02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:38.560]  contacts he won't tell us anything classified I don't need to talk to folks
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:43.000]  about secret stuff to to see that's what I got then I talked to a couple guys I
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:47.760]  know we have a lot of contacts and they just basically said that they had heard
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:53.280]  without me telling him what I thought basically what I just said but then I
[02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:56.960]  kind of feel bad if that's really what's going on we're a big enough show now
[02:44:56.960 --> 02:45:01.600]  where if he's not gonna tell him the strategy because you don't tell us what
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:04.360]  you're gonna do but then you don't want his constituents to get mad and these
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:08.840]  betrayed us you know I'm kind of in a quandary here but Trump always told us
[02:45:08.840 --> 02:45:12.480]  what he was gonna do that he never lied to us he hasn't lied to us but he said
[02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:16.200]  I will not tell the enemy what I'm gonna do and I will be I don't want to say
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:19.760]  deceptive but I will put all options on the table when we do something
[02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:23.360]  militarily because you never tell folks what the options are or then you've
[02:45:23.360 --> 02:45:27.200]  eliminated those options what I think we're seeing is real presidential
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:33.760]  strategy here and my gut is the exit is a very strong victory pulling out with
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:37.360]  an economic deal not giving the extremists a safe haven and cutting off
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:42.040]  the globalist operation of playing footsie with the Al Qaeda slash ISIS folks
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:46.440]  dr. Botanic that's a mouthful but is that someone accurate or is that wrong it's
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:51.480]  completely wrong not only as the president lied to the American public
[02:45:51.480 --> 02:45:57.280]  but more importantly the generals Mattis McMasters the people we helped to put
[02:45:57.280 --> 02:46:02.600]  in have lied to themselves and to the American public these are generals who
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:07.760]  know better than to say that more troops putting into a constant war an
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:12.800]  insurgency will clean out fifth area of Afghanistan when I've been in
[02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:17.440]  Afghanistan they don't know the history Trump again repeats that we were
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:22.680]  attacked in 9-11 this is always about 9-11 I told you from day one when I
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:27.160]  came on this show it wasn't about break barred or banning or any of the guys it
[02:46:27.160 --> 02:46:32.200]  was about guys like me and others who said these generals are cowards they're
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:36.680]  moral intellectual cowards I've known that about McMaster because we paid him
[02:46:36.680 --> 02:46:41.880]  I knew that about matters but I had warned my men in G2 you put these guys in
[02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:46.720]  and they act in a different way I will turn against you and I will have every
[02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:51.920]  American turn against you because this is a disaster there is no strategy
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:57.920]  putting in more men McMaster is an idiot he knows very well does nothing the
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:03.080]  effect that you're gonna put pressure on Pakistan is absurd the Pakistani and
[02:47:03.080 --> 02:47:08.560]  Pompeo's the smartest knows that this was created by a ISI the interservice
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:14.840]  intelligence agency and the CIA then created the interservice now let me
[02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:21.040]  just put get further there was no terrorist attack from Afghanistan or Iraq
[02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:26.480]  and these generals know it they're lying they're coward moral cowards and
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:31.280]  they're ineffectual and I say that as a former rear admiral and a military
[02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:37.280]  officer who resigned my commission with honor and I find them disgraceful this
[02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:42.320]  is the most absurd thing you could have done Trump has now unnoticed that we
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:46.360]  will work against them the alternative right and the Tea Party started with
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:51.160]  guys like me and Steve quail and the others in Montana said this is enough
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:56.720]  this 9-11 was an inside attack by CIA furthermore not one of those general
[02:47:56.720 --> 02:48:02.160]  knows any idea how cars they came in there I was there the days I'll make
[02:48:02.160 --> 02:48:07.400]  hollers up the neocon who was born in Afghanistan a CIA operative who worked
[02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:13.560]  for me in the West Bank in Gaza a total moron who never did anything productive
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:19.240]  in his life brought in cars I into Afghanistan where there's heroin
[02:48:19.240 --> 02:48:22.800]  dealing brother so let me ask you this we're gonna skip the break you got
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:26.040]  plenty of time hold on because I want to be clear I don't call up yes and
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:29.960]  pre-set up what we're gonna talk about I respect dr. Pachennick hold on I'm
[02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:33.920]  going to you and I respect his views and I'm not saying I disagree with him I'm
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:40.560]  saying Trump believes the strategy is to go in and build up and pull out that's
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:45.440]  what the troops and even mid-level people and high level are being told so
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:49.800]  that's what I said is it looks like he thinks he's telling the truth to go in
[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:53.920]  and get us out but I agree it's never worked it's a quagmire it puts more
[02:48:53.920 --> 02:48:57.440]  targets on the ground I said last night on air I don't know how India is going
[02:48:57.440 --> 02:49:01.240]  to really put real pressure on Pakistan I thought that would cement them more
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:05.800]  into the economy networks and all of it but I'm trying to be positive and put
[02:49:05.800 --> 02:49:08.280]  out all sides because here's the thing dr. Pachennick here's the thing dr.
[02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:11.920]  Pachennick I talked to your smart guy and I talked to you a few days before
[02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:15.800]  the election and remember our private conversation so the thing is I'm right
[02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:19.920]  sometimes when you're wrong so so all I'm saying is I'm not I'm not saying you're
[02:49:19.920 --> 02:49:23.800]  wrong I'm saying and this is bold statements by you and I respect him I
[02:49:23.800 --> 02:49:26.280]  want to hear him we have you on for a whole hour tomorrow if you want to take
[02:49:26.280 --> 02:49:29.160]  calls about it because I mean look if Trump's really taken a sideways slide
[02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:34.200]  his support of that bad health care bill just wanting to get a win was when he
[02:49:34.200 --> 02:49:37.440]  lost a lot of his support with people because it was a bad move he did that he
[02:49:37.440 --> 02:49:40.920]  hasn't gone after the vaccine makers he's done some bad things a lot of good
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:44.600]  things too and I see the globalist hating his guts is this the beginning of
[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:47.960]  the sellout by him like Bannon has kind of signaled this isn't the same
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:51.720]  administration what are you saying is really happening what's really happening
[02:49:51.720 --> 02:49:55.880]  is Bannon was correct that our military is creating a self-delusional
[02:49:55.880 --> 02:50:01.760]  scenario McMasters has never won a war he wrote a book which shamefully tells
[02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:05.680]  about dereliction of duty and he's committing the very dereliction of duty
[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:11.120]  he knows that in order to increase his prestige and his presence he's brought
[02:50:11.120 --> 02:50:16.120]  in matters also who never won a war every one of those generals had been out
[02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:19.560]  of Iraq they came in right now I understand generals always want to fight
[02:50:19.560 --> 02:50:22.680]  the war there by his loss to prove they can do it so let's but I agree with you
[02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:26.040]  if it is delusion they really believe they're going to win with this plan
[02:50:26.040 --> 02:50:28.760]  though and they really believe they're gonna let the military actually wipe
[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:32.360]  out the real ISIS and Al Qaeda folks that we know we've been protecting so
[02:50:32.360 --> 02:50:36.360]  isn't this a different strategy or are you saying it's all bull it's bullshit
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:43.600]  the real it by the CIA the real ISI was created by the CIA the real Al Qaeda was
[02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:47.440]  created by the CIA what are you talking about we don't have a war on terror this
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:52.840]  is 16 years of insurgency in a place that's not even a country McMaster knows
[02:50:52.840 --> 02:50:57.960]  that Mattis knows that I've been in Afghanistan but you're saying I understand
[02:50:57.960 --> 02:51:02.680]  you have it you're saying Trump then the thing I'm a big mistake he should have
[02:51:02.680 --> 02:51:06.960]  gone with his impulse he knew better not to listen to the general notice he said
[02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:10.720]  that did you watch the speech he said my instinct says don't do this I don't care
[02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:14.800]  what a man says I hear what a man does and he went against his instincts he
[02:51:14.800 --> 02:51:19.360]  was brought in for his instincts not to hear the generals and we actually help
[02:51:19.360 --> 02:51:23.560]  the generals to come in to stop a war that was my mistake and others but we
[02:51:23.560 --> 02:51:27.280]  will get rid of these generals they should have been court martial for the
[02:51:27.280 --> 02:51:30.960]  arrogance and the stupidity and the number of let me stop you then let me
[02:51:30.960 --> 02:51:34.720]  stop you then because I want to look at this then as if you're right he looked
[02:51:34.720 --> 02:51:38.840]  forced last night he didn't want to get to that part he said my instinct say
[02:51:38.840 --> 02:51:43.080]  this is bad but now I'm behind the desk and things are different well how did
[02:51:43.080 --> 02:51:47.320]  they get him to do this when he's very pigheaded and always does what he thinks
[02:51:47.320 --> 02:51:51.360]  is best because you got to remember when his father wanted to get rid of him and
[02:51:51.360 --> 02:51:55.360]  put him into disciplinary action he was sent to a military academy he then
[02:51:55.360 --> 02:51:59.920]  refused to serve in Vietnam so he basically looks to generals as if they
[02:51:59.920 --> 02:52:03.560]  are their mentors and fathers these generals are what I call idiots of
[02:52:03.560 --> 02:52:07.800]  aunts they know what they read but they don't know how to create a war and a
[02:52:07.800 --> 02:52:12.920]  win a war unlike Eisenhower and Marshall who knew exactly how initiate a war and
[02:52:12.920 --> 02:52:18.280]  stop the war they've never done it and a control war it's not even how they
[02:52:18.280 --> 02:52:23.640]  execute a war they are a disaster mad dog matters is a disaster he hasn't
[02:52:23.640 --> 02:52:28.200]  really created anything other than his reputation he reads all these books
[02:52:28.200 --> 02:52:33.520]  again you seem really mad the military sources I've talked to are disgusted by
[02:52:33.520 --> 02:52:39.200]  this and they're a lot of really right-wing men will die Trump has now
[02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:43.720]  created a greater greater graveyard for our man which shouldn't have been in the
[02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:47.400]  first place it's absolutely what about his argument what about his argument
[02:52:47.400 --> 02:52:51.000]  that since we've lost so many troops we've now got to win this the only way to
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:55.000]  win it is to kill everyone in Afghanistan we went it's exactly what
[02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:59.080]  happened in Vietnam we kept on putting more and more men until we lost 50,000
[02:52:59.080 --> 02:53:03.120]  men's lives one quarter of a million and we killed three million the Vietnamese
[02:53:03.120 --> 02:53:05.880]  and we lost the war and we where we walked out of there
[02:53:05.880 --> 02:53:09.320]  McMaster and now we conquered them via the economy wait well what about Trump's
[02:53:09.320 --> 02:53:13.720]  taking about we're gonna offer you a carpet of gold he said money in cars
[02:53:13.720 --> 02:53:19.200]  the Afghanistan is so corrupt they're running billions of dollars the CIA knows
[02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:23.280]  that we know it it was nothing let's bring up the opium opium production was
[02:53:23.280 --> 02:53:28.840]  3% worldwide out of there in 2001 now it's 97% out of Afghanistan what's
[02:53:28.840 --> 02:53:33.760]  going on the opium okay the opium is a crucial element of export our Marines
[02:53:33.760 --> 02:53:37.280]  protected of whatever getting in I don't even have to talk about opium let's
[02:53:37.280 --> 02:53:40.600]  talk about let's get into the real stuff you say you want to stop it then tell
[02:53:40.600 --> 02:53:46.160]  folks what's going on what's going on is that Pakistan in India for 75 years
[02:53:46.160 --> 02:53:51.160]  have been shooting at each other on a daily basis over Kashmir have we stopped
[02:53:51.160 --> 02:53:56.960]  it no can we stop it possibly but we don't need soldiers for that I need a
[02:53:56.960 --> 02:54:02.080]  Rex Tillerson who's smarter than they are who ran a $400 billion company who
[02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:06.440]  understands negotiation diplomacy I don't need an idiot who's been reading
[02:54:06.440 --> 02:54:11.440]  Socrates or some moral books and has no idea what he's doing help matters
[02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:16.760]  tries to impress everybody that he's read a philosophy book we paid him money
[02:54:16.760 --> 02:54:20.960]  in the Clancy franchise I was not happy I was hoping that he would act in a more
[02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:25.360]  professional way but I taught at the war college this man's an idiot he's
[02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:29.800]  basically should have been court marshal for this decision he's performing
[02:54:29.800 --> 02:54:34.640]  dereliction of duty the problem is our generals have been pan they have been
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:40.240]  patsy's they have been treated like feminine like prima donnas if this was
[02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:44.800]  George Marshall I would have fired 600 of those generals on top as he did in
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:48.720]  World War one and we won the war we're gonna have a bloodbath that you've
[02:54:48.720 --> 02:54:52.840]  never seen before and I've warned you and I wasn't getting correct this is not
[02:54:52.840 --> 02:54:57.880]  about terrorism that's bullshit this is not about 9-11 that's bullshit because
[02:54:57.880 --> 02:55:01.400]  it's a no more cussing because we can only delay and then and then it
[02:55:01.400 --> 02:55:05.560]  has to build back up I get represented anyway I get represented anyway Alex
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:09.120]  doesn't matter you can see I'm furious because we helped to put in these
[02:55:09.120 --> 02:55:13.240]  generals and I thought they were smart enough I had half a brain you did during
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:17.760]  the campaign after warned them don't let them go wild don't expand these wars in
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:21.760]  these wars he went right into that does Trump not get any credit though that he
[02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:27.000]  controlled them so far and didn't let them expand the war in Syria yes no credit
[02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:31.000]  whatsoever this is not a question of a grade this is a question what we call
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:35.440]  the existential moment you want to go to war it takes six seconds to go to war
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:39.760]  you want to get out of war it's taken us 17 years to find out what the hell we're
[02:55:39.760 --> 02:55:43.960]  doing there we don't belong there men are dying there every day we have no
[02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:49.160]  strategy and putting more men into the place is not principal rationality or
[02:55:49.160 --> 02:55:53.360]  principal morality there's the question why are they doing it you agree it's
[02:55:53.360 --> 02:55:58.040]  delusional and they think there's a plan to extricate this is true this is six
[02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:02.440]  trillion dollars in that war and who's gonna make money KBR who makes money in
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:07.120]  Africa KBR what are we doing Djibouti the same thing I've got soldiers who come
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:11.000]  back and say what the hell was I doing in Africa why my Djibouti's who dance
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:15.280]  who mind the soldiers have no idea what they're doing this why don't we do what
[02:56:15.280 --> 02:56:19.720]  China doesn't just go with economic power and take over I agree with you we
[02:56:19.720 --> 02:56:23.240]  don't have the brains I thought Trump would be smart enough to do that Alex
[02:56:23.240 --> 02:56:27.760]  you just hit it on the head China went into Djibouti and instead of using guns
[02:56:27.760 --> 02:56:32.440]  they built 400 miles of railroads from Djibouti to Ethiopia what do we do we
[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:37.040]  signed a bunch of young Christian kids you don't speak they don't speak Arabic
[02:56:37.040 --> 02:56:40.600]  they don't speak French and we send them to guns to some millions and then to
[02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:44.600]  support corrupt individuals that's our military they're dysfunctional we have
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:49.120]  billions of dollars invested in men who have never really done anything in the
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:53.560]  real life and they have been treated like prima donnas it's the most socialist
[02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:58.200]  system I've ever seen they get up every day they know what to do you're saying
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:03.640]  it's basically like it's like paths of glory but America style this is like
[02:57:03.640 --> 02:57:09.240]  paths of childishness this is these are pansies these are not men these aren't
[02:57:09.240 --> 02:57:13.040]  men who went out to create jobs these aren't men who went out and risked their
[02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:17.120]  lives to do something creative these are men who got addicted to some kind of
[02:57:17.120 --> 02:57:21.120]  shooting and have no idea what it means they have no idea what regime change
[02:57:21.120 --> 02:57:25.360]  means one of the reasons why I left the the National War College was these men
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:30.200]  men like McMaster and Mattis and others were stupid and after a while you
[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:34.640]  couldn't really talk to them and when the Iraq war occurred I said to all of
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:38.600]  these guys going in you're gonna lose and you won't even know what you're doing
[02:57:38.600 --> 02:57:43.200]  you will be in there for years on end because Paul Wolfowitz and so but here's
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:46.400]  the thing I mean maybe they're not stupid maybe they're parasites and all
[02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:50.520]  they want the money a war brings that's fine I don't care how you say it they're
[02:57:50.520 --> 02:57:55.160]  stupid they're parasites they are mouth and tense these are missing throats of
[02:57:55.160 --> 02:57:58.920]  arses okay well why do people seem to think then that this is really a build
[02:57:58.920 --> 02:58:03.960]  down for real to then go in claim we've made a deal with them paper it over and
[02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:07.160]  then haul ass out of there you're from your sources you think this is a real
[02:58:07.160 --> 02:58:10.560]  escalation of invasion because notice he didn't say any numbers he didn't say
[02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:16.800]  any numbers let me tell me what do you think no it's nonsense it's absolute
[02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:21.920]  nonsense this is not a strategy it's a cockamamie a series of tactics that
[02:58:21.920 --> 02:58:26.080]  McMaster has no idea what he's talking about he's gonna back in the back of
[02:58:26.080 --> 02:58:29.800]  70 seconds that Paul was coming up to fourth hour told by the tune in in four

[03:00:37.800 --> 03:00:40.800]  respect we have different views people ask how does one guess say one thing the
[03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:43.640]  other guess is nothing because we're not scripted folks we're having a real
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:49.040]  college of ideas that means a spectrum of panting on of ideas and I tend to
[03:00:49.040 --> 03:00:53.060]  think if he's right the way this is going this is the first big screw up of
[03:00:53.060 --> 03:00:57.280]  Trump I'm trying to see it from what Trump's been sold on that it's a way to
[03:00:57.280 --> 03:01:01.200]  you know go in negotiate actually take out the Al Qaeda and terrorist folks that
[03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:05.080]  aren't working with us that we've been protecting as Jenick said pull out and
[03:01:05.080 --> 03:01:09.080]  then have a business deal with them but not you know have people hanging off
[03:01:09.080 --> 03:01:13.200]  helicopters but I get Trump wanting to be macho looking up to the common dot when
[03:01:13.200 --> 03:01:16.320]  he went to military school when daddy sent him there because he was a bad boy
[03:01:16.320 --> 03:01:20.960]  and chasing so many skirts or whatever so he's also a psychiatrist so in the last
[03:01:20.960 --> 03:01:23.920]  four minutes we have finish up your points dr. Pachennick I'd like to invite
[03:01:23.920 --> 03:01:27.960]  you back on tomorrow during David Knight's transmission you happy the two
[03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:33.040]  accidents that occurred in Singapore and in Japan Harbor is indicative of how
[03:01:33.040 --> 03:01:38.680]  incompetent we have had in terms of our Navy leadership our commander in this
[03:01:38.680 --> 03:01:43.680]  that in the Pacific I mean these are people who are not trained to do what
[03:01:43.680 --> 03:01:47.680]  they're supposed to do an unordinary day we have young men and women who are
[03:01:47.680 --> 03:01:51.400]  going into combat they don't know what they're shooting at they have no idea
[03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:57.040]  what the issues are the generals make up these nonsensical stories and theories
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:02.680]  that are absurd these generals knew damn well in a 9-11 was an inside job the CIA
[03:02:02.680 --> 03:02:06.840]  did it even the general who was involved had to confess it to me because I
[03:02:06.840 --> 03:02:12.760]  oversaw these boys and now they say oh this is a retribution for 9-11 for
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:18.520]  terrorists in in Afghanistan let me tell you Zalmay Khalaza brought in the
[03:02:18.520 --> 03:02:23.640]  Taliban when I was in the deputy assistant secretary of state under Bush
[03:02:23.640 --> 03:02:28.400]  senior and Reagan and he brought them into the White House now would you bring
[03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:32.800]  the so-called terrible Taliban into the White House to meet Reagan how do the
[03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:36.560]  generals explain that how do the generals explain that cause they was brought
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:42.040]  in by Zalmay Khalaza who's never fought in our country a CIA operative train at
[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:46.320]  the American School in Lebanon and brought in cause a from Silver Springs
[03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:51.080]  Maryland a delicatessen no I'm saying because we've run these people to a
[03:02:51.080 --> 03:02:55.160]  certain extent now if we actually turn them off or kill the ones that aren't
[03:02:55.160 --> 03:02:58.320]  working with us then we could actually have peace I think that's what Trump
[03:02:58.320 --> 03:03:03.520]  may be trying to do no Trump as he has no understanding what wars are bad he has
[03:03:03.520 --> 03:03:08.480]  no understanding what it means to begin a war to initiate and to complete a war
[03:03:08.480 --> 03:03:11.840]  neither these generals none of these generals were involved in finishing a
[03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:16.840]  war they're not like Eisenhower who went in commanded the European Alliance went
[03:03:16.840 --> 03:03:21.560]  to Korea stopped the war and that was it same thing with George Marshall we don't
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:25.320]  have that kind of brains here what we have what I call facti Jordan or
[03:03:25.320 --> 03:03:30.080]  idiot savants they read books they may believe they're scholar warriors and I
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:33.840]  gotta tell you I supported some of them because I thought they would stop Trump
[03:03:33.840 --> 03:03:38.640]  from being impulsive and going to war I was wrong I was wrong that's why I'm
[03:03:38.640 --> 03:03:43.560]  furious because instead of doing their duty to the Republic not to themselves to
[03:03:43.560 --> 03:03:48.600]  the Republic the Republic is in no way in danger from anybody in Afghanistan or
[03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:54.360]  Iraq that was evident after 9-11 so what do we have a regurgitation of some
[03:03:54.360 --> 03:03:59.760]  nonsensical theory with nonsensical strategy that doesn't even exist and I
[03:03:59.760 --> 03:04:05.040]  will guarantee you we will have another bloodbath because already many men
[03:04:05.040 --> 03:04:09.520]  have died they don't want to talk about the guys who are off record the ones who
[03:04:09.520 --> 03:04:14.280]  come in under either blackwater or Prince I knew Prince he was talking to a
[03:04:14.280 --> 03:04:18.960]  bunch of us intelligence officer all he cared about is to have a cheaper war on
[03:04:18.960 --> 03:04:23.680]  the come and basically if you look at his history as a seal he was pretty
[03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:28.480]  pathetic he was not a great seal he was not even great in his training you can
[03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:33.400]  ask a lot of guys who worked with it so what you have here I'm sure David is
[03:04:33.400 --> 03:04:36.440]  gonna have you on I want to have you back on you're wound up we want to hear
[03:04:36.440 --> 03:04:41.200]  this tomorrow 8 a.m. Central it gets you on with David Knight info wars.com
[03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:43.880]  forward slash show the feeds are all there and station is starting to pick it
[03:04:43.880 --> 03:04:48.120]  up whole watch it's coming up straight ahead we'll be back
[03:04:48.120 --> 03:04:53.520]  Joe Bix here with info wars.com today I want to talk to you about guns why we
[03:04:53.520 --> 03:04:57.640]  have them why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them and
[03:04:57.640 --> 03:05:02.040]  why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against
[03:05:02.040 --> 03:05:06.280]  it in the press I believe every good journalist needs to know why the second
[03:05:06.280 --> 03:05:10.240]  amendment must be considered more essential than the first amendment this
[03:05:10.240 --> 03:05:15.240]  may be a bitter pill to swallow but the right to keep and bear arms is not an
[03:05:15.240 --> 03:05:20.160]  outdated dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the red
[03:05:20.160 --> 03:05:26.480]  coats no it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776 the
[03:05:26.480 --> 03:05:30.040]  original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain 10 of what the

[03:08:10.360 --> 03:08:15.360]  we are live it is the fourth hour of the alex jones show with me your host Paul
[03:08:15.360 --> 03:08:20.080]  Joseph Watson speaking to you from somewhere in the rotting corpse of
[03:08:20.080 --> 03:08:25.600]  Western Europe of course over the last two weeks we've had basically a purge of
[03:08:25.600 --> 03:08:29.480]  conservatives happening across the internet they're attacking people
[03:08:29.480 --> 03:08:33.840]  financially sabotaging people every single level imaginable I'm gonna get
[03:08:33.840 --> 03:08:38.040]  into that first I want to read you something that the British writer
[03:08:38.040 --> 03:08:45.160]  Brendan O'Neill said speaking about the new definition of anti fascists the new
[03:08:45.160 --> 03:08:50.680]  definition that the media the political class the left has embraced over the
[03:08:50.680 --> 03:08:55.960]  past 10 days or so listen to what he said about what constitutes an anti
[03:08:55.960 --> 03:09:03.880]  fascist in 2017 quote so being so today being anti fascist means destroying
[03:09:03.880 --> 03:09:09.480]  historic monuments censoring people you don't like starting fires on campus to
[03:09:09.480 --> 03:09:13.640]  prevent people from speaking calling for certain books protests and the flags to
[03:09:13.640 --> 03:09:18.360]  be outlawed refusing to take a stand against gangs and violent misanthropes
[03:09:18.360 --> 03:09:23.480]  who've massacred hundreds of people for the crime of being free and believing
[03:09:23.480 --> 03:09:29.200]  in democracy incessantly referring to everyone by their race and having more
[03:09:29.200 --> 03:09:34.600]  sleepless nights over the Jewish state than any other state is that right what's
[03:09:34.600 --> 03:09:40.440]  next show how anti fascist you are by measuring people's skulls before deciding
[03:09:40.440 --> 03:09:46.680]  if they're a good or a bad person that's literally what's the word what has come
[03:09:46.680 --> 03:09:51.560]  to be defined as anti fascist and it's accelerated it's intensified over the
[03:09:51.560 --> 03:09:57.660]  past 10 days the mainstream media the left has embraced the alt left has
[03:09:57.660 --> 03:10:04.120]  embraced violent and T for thugs and declared them to be heroes do you think
[03:10:04.120 --> 03:10:08.600]  for a second that's gonna come back on them is it already coming back on them
[03:10:08.600 --> 03:10:14.720]  I mean I remember being on the show two weeks ago two three weeks ago joking
[03:10:14.720 --> 03:10:21.480]  with Alex Jones because I got a haircut which is now the new Nazi haircut now
[03:10:21.480 --> 03:10:25.640]  let's put it aside for the moment but it's literally the most popular haircut
[03:10:25.640 --> 03:10:30.920]  in the entire Western world for men aged between 18 and 40 now that doesn't
[03:10:30.920 --> 03:10:37.600]  matter you get a haircut a short back and sides you're a Nazi now we covered
[03:10:37.600 --> 03:10:42.240]  this a couple of days ago I'm gonna flash back to it now man stabbed after
[03:10:42.240 --> 03:10:47.440]  haircut gets him mistaken for a neo-nazi this is out of the New York Post this
[03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:52.800]  Colorado man is avowedly not a neo-nazi but he believes is long on top buzzed on
[03:10:52.800 --> 03:10:58.560]  the side haircut got him mistaken for one and nearly stabbed to death by a
[03:10:58.560 --> 03:11:04.240]  confused anti fascist now this was Joshua with 26 years old who escaped his
[03:11:04.240 --> 03:11:09.920]  brush with hairdo do their old tongue and cheek and joke you about it with a
[03:11:09.920 --> 03:11:14.720]  defensive slice to the hand and three stitches quote apparently my haircut is
[03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:18.840]  considered a neo-nazi statement he told the post-saturday as is the kill gone at
[03:11:18.840 --> 03:11:25.120]  20,000 Facebook shares so literally one of these hysterical popped up frothing
[03:11:25.120 --> 03:11:29.800]  at the mouth social justice warriors the new anti fascist at the left the
[03:11:29.800 --> 03:11:35.440]  political flash the media has embraced tried to kill this guy because of his
[03:11:35.440 --> 03:11:40.360]  haircut because they now think having a certain type of hairstyle means you're
[03:11:40.360 --> 03:11:45.760]  a neo-nazi I mean you've all seen the meme everyone who disagrees with me is
[03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:51.600]  Hitler they've now actually put that into effect and anything is fascistic
[03:11:51.600 --> 03:11:57.520]  behavior anything mandates anything justifies violent attack even murder
[03:11:57.520 --> 03:12:02.680]  these are the people the political class and the mainstream media have embraced
[03:12:02.680 --> 03:12:09.200]  and endorsed since Charlottesville over the past 10 days and look what happened
[03:12:09.200 --> 03:12:14.880]  this is out of our teeth Texas man charged with trying to bomb Houston
[03:12:14.880 --> 03:12:20.280]  Confederate statue that's right literally an all left terrorist tried to
[03:12:20.280 --> 03:12:26.840]  plan an IED in a public place because he was radicalized by mainstream media
[03:12:26.840 --> 03:12:33.880]  hysteria once again the question is will CNN disavow I mean I disavowed the
[03:12:33.880 --> 03:12:38.240]  quote alt-right nine frigging months ago of course that hasn't stopped them
[03:12:38.240 --> 03:12:43.880]  claiming that I'm alt-right in every single hit piece since I disavowed the
[03:12:43.880 --> 03:12:50.080]  alt-right the fascistic race obsessed elements of it nine months ago CNN
[03:12:50.080 --> 03:12:54.120]  embraced the alt-left after Charlottesville you remember we had the
[03:12:54.120 --> 03:13:01.040]  story they literally changed the headline on CNN at the request of Antifa the
[03:13:01.040 --> 03:13:06.600]  headline that said oh Antifa is seeking peace through violence yes it actually
[03:13:06.600 --> 03:13:15.800]  said that George Orwell rolls in his grave CNN embracing endorsing Antifa the
[03:13:15.800 --> 03:13:21.760]  violent alt-left the group listed by the New Jersey Department of Homeland
[03:13:21.760 --> 03:13:27.400]  Security as a terrorist organization yeah they're your new heroes what do you
[03:13:27.400 --> 03:13:33.360]  think is gonna happen now we have people planting or attempting to plan IED
[03:13:33.360 --> 03:13:38.320]  explosives in public places because they're triggered by offensive statues
[03:13:38.320 --> 03:13:42.680]  this is literally what we see in America right now this is the start of Civil
[03:13:42.680 --> 03:13:49.320]  War and the mainstream media is pushing it they contrived it they created it the
[03:13:49.320 --> 03:13:53.680]  article continues a man captured while trying to blow up a Confederate monument
[03:13:53.680 --> 03:13:58.160]  in Houston Texas on Saturday has been charged with a federal crime Andrew
[03:13:58.160 --> 03:14:04.320]  Cecil Schneck tried to drink the liquid explosives this is how mental he is when
[03:14:04.320 --> 03:14:08.720]  he was approached by officers Schneck 25 was spotted among the bushes near the
[03:14:08.720 --> 03:14:12.480]  statue of Confederate officer Richard Dowling in Houston's Herman Park on
[03:14:12.480 --> 03:14:17.280]  Saturday evening after protest is demanding the removal of the statue
[03:14:17.280 --> 03:14:23.040]  clashed with those who wanted to see it remain a park ranger saw Schneck holding
[03:14:23.040 --> 03:14:27.720]  several boxes including what appeared to be duct tape and wires according to
[03:14:27.720 --> 03:14:32.120]  court documents cited by the Houston press Schneck tried to drink from a
[03:14:32.120 --> 03:14:37.800]  plastic bottle he was carrying liquid turned out to be nitroglycerin Abe
[03:14:37.800 --> 03:14:42.480]  Martin as US Attorney for the Southern District of Texas said Monday a white
[03:14:42.480 --> 03:14:48.160]  powder found inside one of the boxes was identified as hexamethylene
[03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:55.240]  triperoxide diamine a chemical used in detonators this is the violent alt left
[03:14:55.240 --> 03:15:00.760]  literally trying to plan explosives that will kill people anyone in the
[03:15:00.760 --> 03:15:07.320]  vicinity because they're hopped up on hysteria from mainstream media Trump
[03:15:07.320 --> 03:15:12.920]  derangement syndrome Schneck was charged with attempting to militia maliciously
[03:15:12.920 --> 03:15:19.440]  damage or destroy property receiving federal financial assistance so he goes
[03:15:19.440 --> 03:15:23.320]  on they raided his home this is an alt left terrorist this is one of the very
[03:15:23.320 --> 03:15:27.800]  individuals and we've been warning about this forever we warned before the
[03:15:27.800 --> 03:15:34.360]  migrant crisis that these jihadists these refugees would turn jihadists that's
[03:15:34.360 --> 03:15:38.000]  exactly what happened we were proven right on that now it's happening in the
[03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:41.840]  case of the violent alt left they're attacking people for their frigging
[03:15:41.840 --> 03:15:47.760]  haircuts trying to kill people for their hairstyles and they call us the
[03:15:47.760 --> 03:15:52.840]  extremists you see how this works people trying to plan alt left terrorists
[03:15:52.840 --> 03:15:58.920]  trying to plan IEDs in public plot parks to blow up statues because they're
[03:15:58.920 --> 03:16:06.720]  offended you see where this is going to lead you see where this is going oh but
[03:16:06.720 --> 03:16:13.160]  Jay Johnson the former DHS head head of Homeland Security under Obama says that
[03:16:13.160 --> 03:16:18.840]  the removal of Confederate statues is a matter of Homeland Security this is that
[03:16:18.840 --> 03:16:23.240]  of American Mirror former Obama administration official Jay Johnson said
[03:16:23.240 --> 03:16:26.720]  the removal of Confederate statues was a matter of public safety and Homeland
[03:16:26.720 --> 03:16:32.600]  Security so he's saying they need to be removed for the security of the American
[03:16:32.600 --> 03:16:38.600]  people while alt left terrorists are trying to blow them up with high-powered
[03:16:38.600 --> 03:16:48.280]  explosives with IEDs absolutely incredible Jake Tapper of CNN is literally
[03:16:48.280 --> 03:16:54.920]  punching posting puncher Nazi memes on his Twitter account while these alt left

[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:04.960]  having the wrong haircut let that sink in we had another video yesterday which I
[03:17:04.960 --> 03:17:10.240]  posted on Infowars.com of a black Trump supporter who was holding a Milo
[03:17:10.240 --> 03:17:17.320] ianopolis book and a free speech rally another violent alt left thug terrorist
[03:17:17.320 --> 03:17:22.520]  walked straight up to him viciously punches him in the face oh so you called

[03:17:33.240 --> 03:17:40.280]  you this is the start if we allow them to push this narrative to continue to
[03:17:40.280 --> 03:17:45.600]  push this narrative that the most virulently hateful and violent people
[03:17:45.600 --> 03:17:53.120]  involved in politics in America today the alt left and Tifa black lives matter
[03:17:53.120 --> 03:17:58.080]  they're the good guys if we allow them to push that narrative it's going to end

[03:19:38.480 --> 03:19:43.040]  mainstream media as soon as they start smashing stuff up and salting people

[03:20:51.080 --> 03:20:55.280]  information and in the last four or five years doing more and more research I
[03:20:55.280 --> 03:20:59.840]  came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[03:20:59.840 --> 03:21:04.440]  that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do

[03:23:47.280 --> 03:24:09.360]  we're live as the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show now a couple of weeks back I
[03:24:09.360 --> 03:24:14.000]  talked about the purge that was coming of libertarian conservative voices
[03:24:14.000 --> 03:24:19.480]  basically anyone with a dissenting opinion all of whom are now neo-nazis
[03:24:19.480 --> 03:24:23.440]  of course anyone with any kind of dissenting opinion is a neo-nazi black
[03:24:23.440 --> 03:24:29.200]  white Hispanic does matter this is a purge now the purge has only deepened in
[03:24:29.200 --> 03:24:36.400]  that two weeks since I made that YouTube video just yesterday rebel media who of
[03:24:36.400 --> 03:24:41.400]  course many of their reporters have been on this show of course owned by Ezra
[03:24:41.400 --> 03:24:47.640]  Levant a Jewish man rebel media had their website basically deleted from the
[03:24:47.640 --> 03:24:53.280]  internet their DNS server was swept out from underneath them because there was a
[03:24:53.280 --> 03:24:59.440]  targeted campaign to try and convince their domain name host that they were a
[03:24:59.440 --> 03:25:07.600]  neo-nazi outfit the hysteria knows no bounds this is a company owned by Ezra
[03:25:07.600 --> 03:25:12.040]  Levant who is Jewish they pulled their website because they said it was a
[03:25:12.040 --> 03:25:18.200]  neo-nazi website are you starting to get a picture of the absolute relentless
[03:25:18.200 --> 03:25:24.600]  hysteria that is gripping America right now anyone anyone that diverts from the
[03:25:24.600 --> 03:25:31.400]  narrative is now being card and feathered this is out of Reuters Canada's
[03:25:31.400 --> 03:25:34.960]  conservative rebel media said a technology company stopped directing
[03:25:34.960 --> 03:25:38.080]  traffic to its website making it inaccessible to some users around the
[03:25:38.080 --> 03:25:42.760]  world on Monday as a site known for tirades against Muslims and refugees
[03:25:42.760 --> 03:25:48.600]  scrambled to get back online so they didn't name the company that took the
[03:25:48.600 --> 03:25:54.720]  website offline they scrambled to get it up on another domain host finally did it
[03:25:54.720 --> 03:25:59.240]  was down for half of the day in many areas of the world but again that is
[03:25:59.240 --> 03:26:04.040]  absolutely chilling remember we talked about YouTube we talked about Twitter we
[03:26:04.040 --> 03:26:07.960]  talked about Facebook oh it's a private company they can send to who they like
[03:26:07.960 --> 03:26:13.120]  well how about if somebody just wipes your entire website off the internet
[03:26:13.120 --> 03:26:18.960]  what if you own a radio station they just take that down they just take off the
[03:26:18.960 --> 03:26:26.680]  air if you're a TV channel when does it become tyrannical you can't make the
[03:26:26.680 --> 03:26:29.640]  argument that it's just a private company they can do what they want when
[03:26:29.640 --> 03:26:34.560]  they're literally strangling people preventing them from being able to
[03:26:34.560 --> 03:26:40.760]  exercise their first amendment right on any platform Pamela Geller just earlier
[03:26:40.760 --> 03:26:46.840]  today tweeted a paypal has cancelled again financial sabotage bright box
[03:26:46.840 --> 03:26:51.920]  advertisers have been targeted what they're now down to 25 advertisers they
[03:26:51.920 --> 03:26:59.000]  had hundreds before the left the alt left lost the argument so they have to
[03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:05.960]  resort to censorship and financial sabotage it's dirty tricks all the way

[03:31:53.440 --> 03:31:57.640]  information and in the last four or five years doing more and more research I
[03:31:57.640 --> 03:32:02.160]  came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact
[03:32:02.160 --> 03:32:06.720]  that our ancient ancestors in many cases had much better nutrition than we do
[03:32:06.720 --> 03:32:11.680]  today and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they
[03:32:11.680 --> 03:32:16.560]  were hunting killing and then processing and so I set out to develop caveman but

[03:33:09.440 --> 03:33:14.880]  we're live on the Alex Jones show now of course President Trump came out after
[03:33:14.880 --> 03:33:20.840]  the violence in Charlottesville rightly blamed both sides now of course it was
[03:33:20.840 --> 03:33:25.400]  tragic that the girl was killed in the terrorist attack and let's call it what
[03:33:25.400 --> 03:33:29.640]  it was it was a politically motivated violence that meets the definition of
[03:33:29.640 --> 03:33:35.360]  terrorism of course we had an alt left terrorist shoot congressman Scalise
[03:33:35.360 --> 03:33:40.720]  another Republican congressman back a few months ago now we have alt left
[03:33:40.720 --> 03:33:46.000]  terrorists trying to plan IEDs in public parks to blow up statues because
[03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:51.280]  they're offended we have alt left thugs trying to murder people because they
[03:33:51.280 --> 03:33:57.240]  have the wrong haircut and these thugs these terrorists are being empowered
[03:33:57.240 --> 03:34:01.840]  they're being put on a pedestal by the mainstream media by the establishment by
[03:34:01.840 --> 03:34:07.240]  the political class by Silicon Valley who is now taking their advice to shut
[03:34:07.240 --> 03:34:13.800]  down websites like rebel media this purge is accelerating now we have the
[03:34:13.800 --> 03:34:19.480]  alt left and T for these refused fascism groups completely drooling
[03:34:19.480 --> 03:34:25.120]  hysterical morons but again given currency and brace endorsed by the
[03:34:25.120 --> 03:34:30.520]  mainstream media planning mass riots in multiple major US cities on November
[03:34:30.520 --> 03:34:35.680]  4th this is on info wars dot com right now these cities include New York City
[03:34:35.680 --> 03:34:41.520]  Austin Chicago Los Angeles San Francisco they justify it and I read this so you
[03:34:41.520 --> 03:34:45.680]  don't have to because it was torturous let's be honest they justified it with
[03:34:45.680 --> 03:34:50.880]  a long diatribe posted on the revolutionary communist party website
[03:34:50.880 --> 03:34:55.400]  which I had the pleasure to visit earlier today in which they go through this
[03:34:55.400 --> 03:35:01.600]  frothing hysterical deranged justification where they explained this
[03:35:01.600 --> 03:35:07.440]  is unlike any situation before so the same rules do not apply ordinary
[03:35:07.440 --> 03:35:13.080]  protests will just not do so they literally cite a book called the coming
[03:35:13.080 --> 03:35:18.480]  civil war which is written by the chairman of the revolutionary communist
[03:35:18.480 --> 03:35:23.920]  party they talk about agitation they talk about politically provocative
[03:35:23.920 --> 03:35:28.880]  actions this is the unrest that they're planning for November 4th and they're
[03:35:28.880 --> 03:35:34.520]  building up to it for months in advance because this is the big push they actually
[03:35:34.520 --> 03:35:38.120]  think they're going to overthrow the president of the United States of course
[03:35:38.120 --> 03:35:41.600]  they're not going to do that they're going to stand around waving communist
[03:35:41.600 --> 03:35:46.760]  flags smashing Starbucks windows and attacking anyone who dares disagree with
[03:35:46.760 --> 03:35:51.280]  them and for that CNN is going to celebrate them because they're moderate
[03:35:51.280 --> 03:35:56.120]  they're liberal they're progressive it's now progressive to stab people for
[03:35:56.120 --> 03:36:00.520]  having the wrong haircut it's now progressive to plan explosives in parks
[03:36:00.520 --> 03:36:07.760]  because you're offended by a statue these are the mental deficiencies that
[03:36:07.760 --> 03:36:10.960]  have been endorsed by the mainstream media do you think this narrative is
[03:36:10.960 --> 03:36:15.120]  going to blow up in their face you damn right it is and we're going to be here
[03:36:15.120 --> 03:36:21.680]  when it does it already is so they're planning a mass riot basically on
[03:36:21.680 --> 03:36:27.440]  November 4th it's all contrived nobody in their day-to-day experiences with
[03:36:27.440 --> 03:36:32.440]  other race has this kind of problem it's completely contrived it's completely
[03:36:32.440 --> 03:36:40.720]  inauthentic this is a clash contrived by the political class by the alt-left to
[03:36:40.720 --> 03:36:47.160]  frighten to create this fake moral panic that leads to Silicon Valley over
[03:36:47.160 --> 03:36:53.040]  reacting crushing freedom of speech that leads to websites literally being shut
[03:36:53.040 --> 03:36:57.720]  down PayPal accounts being shut down patreon accounts being shut down
[03:36:57.720 --> 03:37:03.960]  advertisers being withdrawn from websites because they lost the argument so
[03:37:03.960 --> 03:37:10.240]  they have to resort to dirty tricks every single time thankfully a lot of
[03:37:10.240 --> 03:37:14.960]  people are rejecting this contrived race war which has been ginned up by the
[03:37:14.960 --> 03:37:19.000]  alt-left and the political class and here's one of them this is candy zoans
[03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:23.360]  and we're gonna try and get her on the show next week I believe she spoke to
[03:37:23.360 --> 03:37:28.720]  the contrived race war and how it's just not reflected in normal people's lives
[03:37:28.720 --> 03:37:34.920]  normal decent people's everyday lives here's the clip I mean there are what
[03:37:34.920 --> 03:37:40.000]  6,000 clansmen left in our nation you want me to actually process that as a
[03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:44.880]  legitimate fear every day when I wake up it's Donald Trump's fault that they're
[03:37:44.880 --> 03:37:51.440]  feeling energized it's a promise fall that black lives matters violent both of
[03:37:51.440 --> 03:37:56.080]  you children in your room it's obviously the media's fault I mean the media is
[03:37:56.080 --> 03:38:01.560]  creating this entire narrative and it is crazy absolutely crazy to me that
[03:38:01.560 --> 03:38:06.440]  people have not figured this out covering it use your brain I mean the
[03:38:06.440 --> 03:38:10.440]  media is literally simulating a reality right now and it is fascinating to watch
[03:38:10.440 --> 03:38:15.120]  people fall for it over and over again my only person in the world that relies
[03:38:15.120 --> 03:38:19.880]  on her own experiences a dictate what's going on in the world hey maybe it's me
[03:38:19.880 --> 03:38:23.920]  maybe I live in a bubble where black people and white people actually get
[03:38:23.920 --> 03:38:28.120]  along every day they went to the gym this morning a white girl signed me in
[03:38:28.120 --> 03:38:32.000]  and handed me a towel no beef I was trying to figure out how to use this
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:36.520]  weight machine and a black trainer came over and helped me no drama I even went
[03:38:36.520 --> 03:38:40.920]  to the coffee shop thereafter and a Spanish girl made my latte with an
[03:38:40.920 --> 03:38:46.840]  extra shot all good in the hood it was a great day so you'll have to forgive me
[03:38:46.840 --> 03:38:51.440]  for not realizing that the figurative racial sky was burning and it was up to
[03:38:51.440 --> 03:38:55.040]  me to choose a side because if I had known I obviously would have picked
[03:38:55.040 --> 03:39:01.400]  none of you losers honestly everybody involved in this fake racial war is a
[03:39:01.400 --> 03:39:06.760]  loser so please spare me the statuses and your white guilt and her black pride
[03:39:06.760 --> 03:39:10.680]  I really don't care to see it you know what's gonna happen if we keep down this
[03:39:10.680 --> 03:39:14.360]  path we are actually going to allow the media to create those divisions we're
[03:39:14.360 --> 03:39:19.440]  none-existent fire okay there was Candice Owens talking about the contrived
[03:39:19.440 --> 03:39:22.480]  race what we're gonna try and get her on the show next week and that's
[03:39:22.480 --> 03:39:26.040]  exactly right because an African-American woman speaking there for those of you
[03:39:26.040 --> 03:39:30.800]  listening on the radio we also had Charles Barkley coming out a couple of
[03:39:30.800 --> 03:39:35.480]  days ago saying the vast majority of African-Americans don't give a damn
[03:39:35.480 --> 03:39:40.600]  about frigging statues of people from 200 years ago they care about education
[03:39:40.600 --> 03:39:44.840]  they care about jobs they care about their family that's what normal moderate
[03:39:44.840 --> 03:39:51.360]  thinking people care about they don't want a race war who does it benefit but
[03:39:51.360 --> 03:39:57.400]  again as we see in Europe basically Western civilization is in one of its
[03:39:57.400 --> 03:40:03.440]  final stages of collapse we've completely lost faith and confidence in our
[03:40:03.440 --> 03:40:09.360]  own civilization in our own history and leftists who assert their hatred for the
[03:40:09.360 --> 03:40:14.320]  West as Theodore Dalrymple the British writer said will very soon be taken at
[03:40:14.320 --> 03:40:20.560]  their word by others and that's what's happening in Europe which moves me on to
[03:40:20.560 --> 03:40:27.880]  the next article this is also up on info wars.com Germany journalist gets six
[03:40:27.880 --> 03:40:33.760]  months suspended sentence for criticizing Islam this is yet another
[03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:39.560]  horror story out of Merkel land a journalist in Germany has been given a
[03:40:39.560 --> 03:40:43.840]  six-month suspended jail sentence for posting a historical photo on Facebook
[03:40:43.840 --> 03:40:49.760]  making the argument that Islam is a fascist ideology so this is Michael
[03:40:49.760 --> 03:40:56.720]  Sturzenberger who posted a photo on Facebook of a Nazi official shaking hands
[03:40:56.720 --> 03:41:01.480]  with Amin al-Hussaini the grand mufti of Jerusalem during World War two he went
[03:41:01.480 --> 03:41:06.920]  on to make the point Hitler was allied with Muslim nations with Muslim
[03:41:06.920 --> 03:41:11.240]  governments during World War two he went on to compare the Quran to Hitler's
[03:41:11.240 --> 03:41:17.240]  Mein Kempf for that thought crime he was given a six-month suspended jail
[03:41:17.240 --> 03:41:22.520]  sentence so if he breaks that at any point over the next three and a half
[03:41:22.520 --> 03:41:31.280]  years by criticizing Islam he will be landed in jail this is what's happening
[03:41:31.280 --> 03:41:37.280]  in Germany in Europe instead of addressing the crisis of mass Islamic
[03:41:37.280 --> 03:41:42.720]  immigration which has completely swamped Europe as basically will ensure
[03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:47.440]  demographically it's the dead sir now there's no coming back from it that
[03:41:47.440 --> 03:41:52.080]  Europe will completely change within our own lifetimes it won't be Europe
[03:41:52.080 --> 03:41:58.520]  anymore but instead of addressing the crisis of that Europe's leaders whose
[03:41:58.520 --> 03:42:02.720]  policies created this nightmare in the first place have decided to persecute
[03:42:02.720 --> 03:42:07.800]  those warning about it and again I go back to what I was saying before
[03:42:07.800 --> 03:42:11.760]  Europeans have been indoctrinated to lose faith in their own culture and
[03:42:11.760 --> 03:42:17.160]  historical legacy and the beginning of that is now also happening in America
[03:42:17.160 --> 03:42:22.240]  which is what you see with these statues being torn down now the void in
[03:42:22.240 --> 03:42:28.160]  America is being filled by unhinged hysterical insane violent alt leftists
[03:42:28.160 --> 03:42:35.240]  and black lives matter over in Europe it's being filled by Islamists now if
[03:42:35.240 --> 03:42:40.280]  you read the strange death of Europe by the British author Charles Murray you
[03:42:40.280 --> 03:42:44.920]  will see that it's basically game over demographically Europe is finished
[03:42:44.920 --> 03:42:53.720]  okay within most people living now in Sweden for example there'll be less
[03:42:53.720 --> 03:42:58.760]  ethnic Swedes living in Sweden than foreigners within most of our lifetimes
[03:42:58.760 --> 03:43:04.680]  okay you bring in people from a different part of the world from a
[03:43:04.680 --> 03:43:08.520]  different continent if you bring in North Africans you bring in people from
[03:43:08.520 --> 03:43:12.960]  the Middle East into Sweden Sweden is no longer Sweden it's going to turn into
[03:43:12.960 --> 03:43:19.560]  something else that's guaranteed and demographically even with just the
[03:43:19.560 --> 03:43:24.400]  migrants that are in Sweden now even if you stopped it if there were no more
[03:43:24.400 --> 03:43:28.960]  Muslim migrants migrants from North Africa coming into Sweden there will be
[03:43:28.960 --> 03:43:35.960]  less ethnic Swedes in Sweden than foreign migrants within our own lifetimes by
[03:43:35.960 --> 03:43:40.520]  the end of this century in virtually every Western European country the
[03:43:40.520 --> 03:43:46.840]  native population will be a minority okay that's without any more immigration
[03:43:46.840 --> 03:43:50.840]  because the migrants currently living there are actually having children the
[03:43:50.840 --> 03:43:58.920]  native population isn't it's game over it's done so you see this process which
[03:43:58.920 --> 03:44:02.840]  has been allowed to take place because Europeans have lost faith in their own
[03:44:02.840 --> 03:44:07.600]  culture in their own civilization in their own history now whether they
[03:44:07.600 --> 03:44:14.160]  realize it or not the barbarians will fill that void Islam will fill that
[03:44:14.160 --> 03:44:19.280]  void because it's a more aggressive culture it's a political system and
[03:44:19.280 --> 03:44:25.320]  now the people who are pointing that out that demographic fact which is
[03:44:25.320 --> 03:44:30.880]  incontrovertible and inevitable at this point unless you had an authoritarian
[03:44:30.880 --> 03:44:38.040]  right-wing regime across the continent which is never going to happen the
[03:44:38.040 --> 03:44:43.400]  people who are pointing that out are now being targeted for persecution for
[03:44:43.400 --> 03:44:49.000]  imprisonment now you can go read what he actually said in his Facebook post again
[03:44:49.000 --> 03:44:55.440]  he just posted a historical photo of a Nazi shaking hand with the grand mufti
[03:44:55.440 --> 03:45:01.760]  of Jerusalem alongside a passage of text pointing out that Islam is a fascist
[03:45:01.760 --> 03:45:07.080]  belief system oh and by the way isn't it amazing how anti-fascists suddenly
[03:45:07.080 --> 03:45:14.000]  stopped caring about fascism once you put islamo before it and that tells the
[03:45:14.000 --> 03:45:18.520]  whole story doesn't it but because of his thought crime if he so much as does
[03:45:18.520 --> 03:45:24.040]  the word negative about Islam over the next three and a half years he will be
[03:45:24.040 --> 03:45:31.400]  in jail for six months for criticizing Islam this in a modern European
[03:45:31.400 --> 03:45:37.080]  country okay so when we talk about political correctness we're talking
[03:45:37.080 --> 03:45:43.360]  about Silicon Valley companies aligning themselves with the state to persecute
[03:45:43.360 --> 03:45:48.320]  people to lock them up for what they've said on the internet that's where it
[03:45:48.320 --> 03:45:53.520]  crosses the line from this lame argument I hear over and over again oh it's just
[03:45:53.520 --> 03:45:58.160]  a private company they can do what they like Facebook is literally working with
[03:45:58.160 --> 03:46:02.520]  x stars the officials to hunt down thought criminals in Germany and lock
[03:46:02.520 --> 03:46:09.920]  them up of course it's happened since 2015 since Angela Merkel oversaw this
[03:46:09.920 --> 03:46:16.000]  nightmare policy which she herself later had to admit was a complete mistake and
[03:46:16.000 --> 03:46:22.160]  has ruined the country of importing overwhelmingly Muslim migrants which
[03:46:22.160 --> 03:46:27.760]  sparked mass sexual assaults in places like Cologne which sparked soaring
[03:46:27.760 --> 03:46:32.520]  crime rates which they tried to cover up but which later came out anyway which
[03:46:32.520 --> 03:46:38.520]  sparked terror attacks in Germany that had never been seen before suicide
[03:46:38.520 --> 03:46:46.320]  bombers blowing themselves up outside music festivals tax attackers people
[03:46:46.320 --> 03:46:50.000]  shooting people dead on the streets you've seen it over and over again people
[03:46:50.000 --> 03:46:55.120]  driving vans into a Christmas market in Berlin all of that thanks to Angela
[03:46:55.120 --> 03:47:03.760]  Merkel's humanitarianism now we see it in Finland now we see it in Russia now we
[03:47:03.760 --> 03:47:09.400]  see it in Barcelona and it's only going to get worse but again every time an
[03:47:09.400 --> 03:47:15.320]  attack happens European leaders capitulate even more the culture the
[03:47:15.320 --> 03:47:22.840]  society capitulates even more embraces Islam and Islamism even more the terror
[03:47:22.840 --> 03:47:31.080]  attacks work you've seen the BBC legitimizing the full burqa literally
[03:47:31.080 --> 03:47:36.440]  the full burqa despite the fact that the very first Arab Muslim feminist groups
[03:47:36.440 --> 03:47:42.840]  in Egypt discarded the burqa as part of their search for freedom for free
[03:47:42.840 --> 03:47:48.640]  speech for education the BBC is now and others in Britain in different European
[03:47:48.640 --> 03:47:53.400]  countries remember we had the head out of Germany with the blonde woman dancing
[03:47:53.400 --> 03:47:57.560]  around saying embrace tolerance while she's literally wearing a hijab dancing
[03:47:57.560 --> 03:48:04.480]  to Turkish music okay they've capitulated they've submitted and after
[03:48:04.480 --> 03:48:10.040]  every single terror attack after every child dismembered massacred in the
[03:48:10.040 --> 03:48:17.080]  streets by a jihadist driving a van they capitulate more and more and more now
[03:48:17.080 --> 03:48:23.240]  I'm seeing DIY adverts for hardware stores in Britain where the people in
[03:48:23.240 --> 03:48:29.400]  them are wearing hijabs they're trying to normalize it this is
[03:48:29.400 --> 03:48:33.560]  capitulation this is submission that's why the terror attacks are not going to
[03:48:33.560 --> 03:48:39.480]  stop even when you get a majority Muslim population in places like Sweden
[03:48:39.480 --> 03:48:44.160]  which again will happen within our lifetimes and in different countries
[03:48:44.160 --> 03:48:47.800]  the terror is not going to stop the violence is not going to stop because
[03:48:47.800 --> 03:48:52.520]  of course the primary victims of terror attacks or are the Muslims because
[03:48:52.520 --> 03:48:59.640]  Muslims kill each other so even when you submit the violence is not going to
[03:48:59.640 --> 03:49:06.960]  stop okay the mass molestation is not going to stop but if you criticize it
[03:49:06.960 --> 03:49:11.040]  then you're under threat of being locked up for six months like this German
[03:49:11.040 --> 03:49:16.320]  journalist speaking about mass sexual assault gang rape of woman on public
[03:49:16.320 --> 03:49:22.000]  bus and shockwaves across Morocco and they're claiming that there are protests
[03:49:22.000 --> 03:49:26.160]  over this I mean I read stories about it all the time the boss allowing a
[03:49:26.160 --> 03:49:30.040]  terrorist several of them were Moroccan we've seen several other examples
[03:49:30.040 --> 03:49:35.000]  recently of these terrorists being Moroccan that's the culture they
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:38.960]  literally have something called Tahrirosh Gamiah otherwise known as the
[03:49:38.960 --> 03:49:45.520]  rape game where if a woman's on her own they attack her they gang rape her you've
[03:49:45.520 --> 03:49:50.480]  seen the videos you've seen the Laura Logan video this is their culture and
[03:49:50.480 --> 03:49:54.480]  some cultures are better than others but our leaders have decided in their
[03:49:54.480 --> 03:50:01.200]  infinite wisdom to import this culture into the West that's why sexual assaults
[03:50:01.200 --> 03:50:05.600]  have skyrocketed that's why the police in Sweden have been covering them up at
[03:50:05.600 --> 03:50:09.800]  music festivals for years the German authorities tried to cover them up
[03:50:09.800 --> 03:50:14.520]  remember for three days after the mass molestation in cloning thousands of
[03:50:14.520 --> 03:50:20.960]  women attacked the media the politicians said nothing well they can't cover it up
[03:50:20.960 --> 03:50:25.680]  any longer but again as I talked about earlier the demographics clearly suggest
[03:50:25.680 --> 03:50:31.640]  that for Europe it is too late and the continent at least Western Europe can
[03:50:31.640 --> 03:50:38.800]  now only serve as a warning to America of the course not to follow we'll be back
