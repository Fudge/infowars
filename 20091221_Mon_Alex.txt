[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  secret societies and we can't get Ventura on obviously because he doesn't have a telephone

[02:19.000 --> 02:31.000]  now Paul Watson wrote a story so did Aaron Dykes via my analysis on Friday
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  headline Alex Jones Copenhagen births world government framework despite fallout over
[02:37.000 --> 02:44.000]  science fraud and a lot of people said but the media says it completely failed and it
[02:44.000 --> 02:53.000]  did largely fail but the dictators that run the EU and the UN and our country and England
[02:53.000 --> 02:59.000]  Gordon Brown namely being the kingpin said we don't care we're implementing this regardless
[02:59.000 --> 03:06.000]  and now Gordon Brown has given speeches saying just that and we have the news headlines here
[03:06.000 --> 03:16.000]  in Telegraph they'll be nowhere to run from the new world government that is just some
[03:16.000 --> 03:24.000]  of the news that I have on this front here's another headline spy drones to enforce CO2

[03:39.000 --> 03:45.000]  the carbon emissions from power plants namely also President Obama in a new world order

[08:05.000 --> 08:31.000]  on the GCN radio network
[08:31.000 --> 08:37.000]  in the last month we spent a lot of time on health care but once the house past it and
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  the Senate said they have the sixty votes there it really isn't much we can do other
[08:42.000 --> 08:48.000]  than have the states block it and have lawsuits filed in the state and federal courts because
[08:48.000 --> 08:59.000]  this system is unconstitutional it is government crony crony capitalism and we're going to be
[08:59.000 --> 09:06.000]  breaking that down quite a bit later in the broadcast today I still want to mainly focus
[09:06.000 --> 09:13.000]  on Copenhagen in the first hour a little bit into the second hour because as big as the
[09:13.000 --> 09:22.000]  power grab of health care is it is nothing compared to global governance being openly
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  established now here's the good news we're making the tyrants act like tyrants in the
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  two week meeting they were unable to get the majority of nations to sign on third world
[09:35.000 --> 09:43.000]  second world and developing nations the problem is the private IMF and world bank front companies
[09:43.000 --> 09:50.000]  for the private central banks fully and illegitimately and illegally have seized control in the last
[09:50.000 --> 09:58.000]  hundred years of Europe the United States Australia New Zealand and Japan in the last fifty and
[09:58.000 --> 10:04.000]  they have announced in Gordon Brown is on showing the deal that they don't care if the
[10:04.000 --> 10:10.000]  agreement wasn't signed on to they are going to implement the taxes in the United States
[10:10.000 --> 10:18.000]  in Canada in England in Western Europe in Japan in Australia and New Zealand they don't
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.000]  care it will be implemented that's why we call it the Anglo-American establishment because
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.000]  one of their top strategist professor Carol Quigley the head of the Georgetown political
[10:29.000 --> 10:36.000]  science department Bill Clinton's main mentor wrote two books one the Anglo-American establishment
[10:36.000 --> 10:42.000]  that was widely publicized and the other written specifically for the State Department but it
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.000]  got out to the public nine hundred pages titled tragedy and hope and he explained that it isn't
[10:48.000 --> 10:55.000]  the British Empire that rules the planet it is the skeletal structure left over by the
[10:55.000 --> 11:01.000]  British Empire and their governing system their shadow government imperial system that they
[11:01.000 --> 11:09.000]  use in India and in many other nations that that structure that system is what is being
[11:09.000 --> 11:18.000]  used to carry out the global governance so it is that system that is being used that system
[11:18.000 --> 11:27.000]  that Cecil Rhodes when he died gave over four billion dollars and that was in the numbers
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.000]  of close to a hundred years ago so the equivalent of trillions he gave all of his money to the
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  establishment of global governance and he wrote books how they were going to establish global
[11:38.000 --> 11:46.000]  governance through the British Empire model and so the British Empire and the Royals of
[11:46.000 --> 11:52.000]  England are some of the biggest owners of the system and it's a global consortium of
[11:52.000 --> 12:00.000]  corporations that now own the planet through fraud through chicanery through larceny through
[12:00.000 --> 12:07.000]  their criminal activity through private corporate intelligence agencies governmental
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  intelligence agencies that take their orders from private networks the private networks
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.000]  through global privatization are not really privatizing government the private corporations
[12:19.000 --> 12:26.000]  are becoming government with their mercenaries with their corporate spies and so we have had
[12:26.000 --> 12:33.000]  global government at least since the nineteen fifties but it wasn't complete it wasn't total
[12:33.000 --> 12:38.000]  and so the globalist have been lobbying the states and other units of federal systems
[12:38.000 --> 12:46.000]  worldwide to standardize zoning to standardize police to standardize and raise the taxing
[12:46.000 --> 12:52.000]  system through the model of the OECD the organization of economic economic and cooperative
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.000]  development that was set up to reorganize Europe after the Marshall plan via the Marshall plan
[12:58.000 --> 13:05.000]  and it's an emergency receivership system that comes into nations they destroy they bankrupt by
[13:05.000 --> 13:12.000]  design and then the globalists take over and so what's happened is the global government is
[13:12.000 --> 13:18.000]  already in place they just tried to through the hype of man-made global warming and now
[13:18.000 --> 13:22.000]  climate change because the earth is cooling so they've shifted terms again first global freezing
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.000]  global warming global freezing in the seventies global warming in the eighties and nineties early
[13:28.000 --> 13:36.000]  two thousands now in the late two thousands they are shifting into climate change itself that
[13:36.000 --> 13:42.000]  way they can never get pinned down again if it gets hotter or colder so all of that is now
[13:42.000 --> 13:49.000]  happening so that's in place but it's fraudulent they need to get the legislatures and the
[13:49.000 --> 13:53.000]  governments of the world who are already predominantly dominated by these banking
[13:53.000 --> 13:59.000]  interest to openly on paper through treaties signed over what's left of their sovereignty
[13:59.000 --> 14:07.000]  that failed so they are simply announcing publicly the structure that was already there the
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.000]  agreement that was signed on to was signed on to by the u.s. Europe England and just a few
[14:12.000 --> 14:19.000]  other countries on Friday evening in the Saturday morning that agreement is now public
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.000]  I did a video announcement on Friday about it we wrote stories Friday Saturday and Sunday
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  on it on Sunday scores of mainstream newspapers the Wall Street Journal the London
[14:30.000 --> 14:41.000]  Telegraph and others reported exactly what we told you on Friday that Gordon Brown is right
[14:41.000 --> 14:48.000]  is writing the agreement because a blank check was signed on to by Europe in the United
[14:48.000 --> 14:55.000]  States and England Canada and a few other nations that they would give unlimited taxing
[14:55.000 --> 15:03.000]  power to a private banking board established through the World Bank and IMF and now Gordon
[15:03.000 --> 15:09.000]  Brown is openly on television announcing that he is the leader of it he set up the G20 as
[15:09.000 --> 15:15.000]  well back when he was the underling of Tony Blair he is one of the most powerful people
[15:15.000 --> 15:24.000]  in the world Gordon Brown and he is openly announcing that the West will levy taxes against
[15:24.000 --> 15:31.000]  its people as if the banker bailout takeover wasn't bad enough and the planned implosion
[15:31.000 --> 15:36.000]  of the economy for vertical consolidation integration as if that wasn't bad enough that
[15:36.000 --> 15:43.000]  they will now levy unilaterally taxes to be paid to the IMF and World Bank and that the
[15:43.000 --> 15:51.000]  EU will now go into all the third world nations and will chronicle their industrial development
[15:51.000 --> 15:57.000]  and that if they don't unilaterally themselves as well cut their carbon emissions which is
[15:57.000 --> 16:03.000]  a death sentence for tens of millions a year conservatively I had said hundreds of millions
[16:03.000 --> 16:08.000]  were at starvation level the UN actually says 900 million are on starvation level every year
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.000]  over 15 million starved a death a year this will conservatively increase it by more than
[16:12.000 --> 16:21.000]  10 million a year we're talking about mega death mega death deaths in the millions and
[16:21.000 --> 16:26.000]  they are announcing that if those nations don't make cuts the IMF and World Bank that
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  have already bought them off paid them off they give Nigeria again a good example billion
[16:31.000 --> 16:37.000]  dollar loan in the 70s Nigeria is paid back with interest over 60 billion in just one
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  loan another 3 billion dollar loan they've paid back over 40 billion still they're in
[16:42.000 --> 16:47.000]  more debt they can never get out of debt so they take our tax money give it to the IMF
[16:47.000 --> 16:52.000]  and World Bank but in the past Congress every year would be arm twisted into this under
[16:52.000 --> 17:00.000]  the name of aid to other countries but it's not aid it's it's funding for the private
[17:00.000 --> 17:05.000]  IMF and World Bank in foreign aid to come in and take over those countries and that's
[17:05.000 --> 17:11.000]  in State Department memorandum 200 of course from 1973 with Dr. Henry Kissinger stating
[17:11.000 --> 17:16.000]  it is to reduce population and if the countries don't reduce population and don't cut food
[17:16.000 --> 17:21.000]  supplies their governments won't be given the billions of dollars so it's a payoff so
[17:21.000 --> 17:28.000]  what's been announced is that world government is here whether you like it or not and here
[17:28.000 --> 17:35.000]  is the London Telegraph on that they'll be nowhere to run from the new world order and
[17:35.000 --> 17:41.000]  it goes on to say the committee to save the world Barack Obama Nicholas Arcozzi Angela
[17:41.000 --> 17:46.000]  Merkel Gordon Brown other leaders at the Copenhagen talks shined an agreement for their
[17:46.000 --> 17:51.000]  nations unilaterally to fund the creation of the global governance system again they're
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  just coming out of the closet it was built behind the giant steel curtains now they've
[17:55.000 --> 18:02.000]  rolled this juggernaut this warmock this colossus of tyranny and death and genocide out into
[18:02.000 --> 18:08.000]  the open dressing it up as the savior of the world here's another key article London Telegraph
[18:08.000 --> 18:14.000]  Copenhagen climate summit plans for EU to police countries emissions Gordon Brown is
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.000]  drawing up plans for the European Union to become a global warming policeman monitoring
[18:19.000 --> 18:28.000]  individual countries compliance with cutting carbon emissions compliance with carbon cutting
[18:28.000 --> 18:34.000]  targets so these nations didn't sign on but through the IMF and World Bank they're controlled
[18:34.000 --> 18:40.000]  but the West in England Gordon Brown is saying that even if the parliament doesn't pass all
[18:40.000 --> 18:47.000]  these new taxes he will implement it in the United States the last week and a half Obama
[18:47.000 --> 18:53.000]  has said quote even if Congress and the Senate won't ratify this I will unilaterally order
[18:53.000 --> 18:59.000]  quote a command and control system to cut and quote it won't be pretty so it's like a mobster
[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  saying give me what I want or I won't be pretty Bob I'm going to smash your face in so just
[19:05.000 --> 19:11.000]  open tyranny in your face and there are other headlines out of the Wall Street Journal President
[19:11.000 --> 19:18.000]  Obama and the New World Order here's another one on the Washington Post Copenhagen climate

[24:02.000 --> 24:08.000]  this is a huge opportunity for new jobs new industries and new services we believe that
[24:08.000 --> 24:13.000]  in the United Kingdom we can create something in order of 400,000 jobs over the next few years
[24:13.000 --> 24:19.000]  from our low carbon industries and services alone but I also want to emphasize that France
[24:19.000 --> 24:25.000]  and Britain and I believe all the other European countries recognize that to make possible a
[24:25.000 --> 24:31.000]  climate change deal which secures the future of our environment we have to work together
[24:31.000 --> 24:37.000]  to provide sufficient finance so that our developing country partners can make the changes that are
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  necessary in their climate change policies to benefit the whole world so there's never been
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  any doubt that we would have to put up some money from the richest countries we have already
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.000]  agreed that there is money in the order of 10 billion dollars to be found over the next
[24:53.000 --> 24:59.000]  three years we are able to finance that from the money that we are announcing today and
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.000]  I believe the rest of the European Union will come on board this is the joint enterprise
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  of France Britain and many other European countries to make possible what I believe is
[25:09.000 --> 25:19.000]  absolutely essential for the world and that's a climate change agreement.
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.000]  So that's how the spin works they say there's no doubt this is happening there's no doubt
[25:25.000 --> 25:30.000]  we need these taxes oh the agreement went really well but it actually all blew up in their face
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.000]  but they don't care their dictatorial they're going to take more money from the west shut down
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  more of our industries he lied and said it'll give you more jobs and then quote
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  give it to the third world now that means give it to the IMF and World Bank and that's
[25:44.000 --> 25:53.000]  actually in scores of newspapers breaking down the actual plan breaking down the program
[25:53.000 --> 26:00.000]  of control and so they're going to take your tax money in the nations they control the west
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  and start giving it to the IMF and World Bank and the IMF and World Bank with his private
[26:05.000 --> 26:12.000]  board funded by your tax money will start monitoring the system worldwide and developing the global
[26:12.000 --> 26:18.000]  governance structure further now here is a short one minute clip from the European Union
[26:18.000 --> 26:26.000]  Parliament with a British member breaking down the basic fraud in Brussels.
[26:26.000 --> 26:33.000]  Well Mr President I take the opportunity of wishing the East European cities well in the
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  coming of the very early skiing season and snow and ice that's come there what of course
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  is indicative of the fact that as independent science has now confirmed that the globe is
[26:44.000 --> 26:52.000]  actually cooling and has been cooling since 2002 broadly flat since 1998 so we're all
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.000]  talking about something here which isn't happening I've heard time and time again members here
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.000]  talk of CO2 as a pollutant a pollutant it's a life-giving natural gas it gives me the
[27:02.000 --> 27:07.000]  impression that some of our members haven't had the benefit of a formal education isn't
[27:07.000 --> 27:13.000]  this really just about the state being able to get its hand in ordinary people's trouser
[27:13.000 --> 27:20.000]  pocket to steal get more tax from them isn't this all about political control isn't all
[27:20.000 --> 27:28.000]  this about politics and big business the whole thing's a sham this bogus hypothesis this
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.000]  ridiculous nonsense that man made CO2 is causing global warming enough please before we damage
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000]  irrevocably the global economy.
[27:39.000 --> 27:45.000]  Absolutely but there's this idea that the UN and the IMF and World Bank are stupid and
[27:45.000 --> 27:51.000]  believe that the earth is dying because of CO2 that the sea levels are rising when they're
[27:51.000 --> 27:58.000]  not rising they know it's a fraud they need something to scare people into relinquishing
[27:58.000 --> 28:06.000]  their rights and freedoms now coming up later I'm going to play several clips from CNN where
[28:06.000 --> 28:12.000]  they have the former Microsoft head the head of Microsoft Development and Science this
[28:12.000 --> 28:18.000]  guy's got a security clearance above ultra calling for geoengineering or terraforming the
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.000]  planet with giant blimps that spray out sulfur dioxide now remember the White House Science
[28:25.000 --> 28:31.000]  are John P. Holdren is already announced in his first speech 11 months ago as the new
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  science are the first thing he said was we've been testing spraying from aircraft nuclei
[28:37.000 --> 28:44.000]  to quote cool the planet now we're looking at going fully operational and they're suddenly
[28:44.000 --> 28:49.000]  admitting that they're already geoengineering the planet so they're just throwing it out
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.000]  there like it's no big deal hiding it in plain view just like they're announcing global
[28:53.000 --> 28:58.000]  government out there like it's no big deal in plain view in plain sight.
[28:58.000 --> 29:03.000]  Meanwhile I have national reporters here every week to interview me for magazines and
[29:03.000 --> 29:08.000]  newspapers I show them these clips I give them documents and they won't even look at them
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.000]  and I say see they're setting up a private global government and they say but don't they
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.000]  mean something different but of global government than what you mean and I show them
[29:16.000 --> 29:21.000]  specific white papers where they state it's a global government to bring in a police state
[29:21.000 --> 29:28.000]  that's a quote a planetary regime to dominate and control all human activities but they
[29:28.000 --> 29:35.000]  don't care because the public for 20 plus years was taught there's no such thing and
[29:35.000 --> 29:39.000]  so people don't like to admit they've been conned so even as global governments being
[29:39.000 --> 29:45.000]  openly set up people can't resist it because they're so weak-minded it's incredible I'm
[29:45.000 --> 29:50.000]  called a crazy person because I read government documents.
[29:50.000 --> 30:00.000]  We're on the march the empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[30:00.000 --> 30:05.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[30:05.000 --> 30:09.000]  Number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[30:09.000 --> 30:14.000]  Number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[30:14.000 --> 30:19.000]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:19.000 --> 30:20.000]  technology is coming.
[30:20.000 --> 30:25.000]  Number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[30:25.000 --> 30:29.000]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[30:29.000 --> 30:34.000]  Number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families
[30:34.000 --> 30:36.000]  lose their power from weather related onages.
[30:36.000 --> 30:41.000]  Number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[30:41.000 --> 30:45.000]  folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science
[30:45.000 --> 30:52.000]  sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[30:52.000 --> 31:00.000]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.

[33:47.000 --> 33:48.380]  This is clear.
[33:48.380 --> 33:53.660]  The global government is manipulating the weather, and I believe preparing to cause major
[33:53.660 --> 34:01.600]  weather disasters as a pretext for everyone to submit to global government.
[34:01.600 --> 34:05.940]  Problem reaction solution, just as Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag to set up a police
[34:05.940 --> 34:11.480]  state in Germany, or just as the czars would bomb their political enemies and then blame
[34:11.480 --> 34:12.980]  them for it.
[34:12.980 --> 34:19.720]  This is a massive setup developing, we'll be covering that coming up in the next hour.
[34:19.720 --> 34:24.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, for the balance of the hour, in Jesse Ventura's stead, because
[34:24.560 --> 34:31.080]  the governor has now escaped to Mexico for a few months, we have Michael Braverman,
[34:31.080 --> 34:37.400]  the executive producer of Conspiracy Theory, and again, when I say this is a trailblazing
[34:37.400 --> 34:44.520]  groundbreaking series that's gotten the highest ratings in the history of true TV, which has
[34:44.520 --> 34:53.000]  had some incredibly highly rated television shows, it is not hype.
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.240]  This show blew away my expectations.
[34:58.240 --> 35:01.720]  When I saw the episodes, I'd seen sections of them, heard about the shows, consulted
[35:01.720 --> 35:08.040]  some on the first seven episodes, appeared in quite a few of the episodes.
[35:08.040 --> 35:12.360]  I trusted Jesse Ventura, because I talked to him over a year ago when he visited with
[35:12.360 --> 35:17.840]  me for three days in Austin, and he said, look, I have final cut on this, and I'm not
[35:17.840 --> 35:19.880]  going to do it unless they do what I want.
[35:19.880 --> 35:23.880]  He goes, I don't know if all this stuff's real, but I'm setting out with an open mind,
[35:23.880 --> 35:26.600]  and we would have big arguments and stuff about, you know, just how bad the New World
[35:26.600 --> 35:27.600]  Order was.
[35:27.600 --> 35:32.640]  And the shows really set out with an open mind and discover that, yes, global warming
[35:32.640 --> 35:37.280]  is a hoax, and discover, yes, there is Big Brother, and discover, yes, the government's
[35:37.280 --> 35:40.840]  hiding what really happened with 9-Eleven, we're not completely sure what happened,
[35:40.840 --> 35:43.680]  but we know the official story, he's got holes in it that are giant.
[35:43.680 --> 35:46.000]  I mean, this is groundbreaking.
[35:46.000 --> 35:52.000]  Nothing like this, truly from an objective perspective, has ever aired on national television.
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.200]  And I cannot tell you how honored I am to be involved with this.
[35:56.200 --> 36:01.840]  This is groundbreaking, and their global warming special made major news in a lot of papers
[36:01.840 --> 36:07.120]  because they got Ben Santor of the UN to admit he cut out sections of his own report, where
[36:07.120 --> 36:12.720]  their own scientist at the UN told them that man was not causing global warming.
[36:12.720 --> 36:14.960]  Joining us is Michael Braverman.
[36:14.960 --> 36:19.680]  Michael, incredible job, and thank you for including me in this program.
[36:19.680 --> 36:23.640]  So, Alex, thank you so much, and we're thrilled to have you.
[36:23.640 --> 36:29.240]  Well, I mean, tell people about the brainchild of this, and the hell you went through to
[36:29.240 --> 36:34.480]  get it on TV, and your doubts you could even get it on, and now the amazing success, and
[36:34.480 --> 36:36.520]  then what's coming up in the next few episodes.
[36:36.520 --> 36:41.640]  Well, I actually had a gentleman's bet with Jesse Ventura, with the governor, that the
[36:41.640 --> 36:43.520]  show would never see the light of day.
[36:43.520 --> 36:49.760]  Even after they picked the show up and said, okay, y'all can do seven episodes, he still
[36:49.760 --> 36:50.760]  did not believe.
[36:50.760 --> 36:55.000]  And I guess part of me didn't believe either that they would actually ever air these shows.
[36:55.000 --> 37:02.600]  They are so explosive, and we do have, we call it two revelations per show.
[37:02.600 --> 37:07.680]  We do have two facts per show that we work really hard on finding out, and some of your
[37:07.680 --> 37:12.720]  listeners may know it, but I guarantee you the general public doesn't, and the reaction
[37:12.720 --> 37:14.840]  has been pretty amazing.
[37:14.840 --> 37:23.040]  Well, I mean, I can't watch a lot of television, and especially these, you know, reality shows,
[37:23.040 --> 37:26.320]  but the shows are really riveting.
[37:26.320 --> 37:32.720]  I mean, they're riveting, and it's a real, who done it, Perry Mason investigation.
[37:32.720 --> 37:33.720]  It's amazing.
[37:33.720 --> 37:37.920]  Well, thank you, and, you know, we try to make them obviously really entertaining.
[37:37.920 --> 37:42.480]  We don't want to do it dry, documentary, so we try to keep it entertaining, and we try
[37:42.480 --> 37:46.800]  to keep it moving fast, and thank you for the compliment about being a who done it,
[37:46.800 --> 37:51.400]  because that's what we were really trying to get at, to get some information out there
[37:51.400 --> 37:56.240]  that people don't know, but you've got to do it in an entertaining way, otherwise,
[37:56.240 --> 37:58.760]  you know, no one's going to watch.
[37:58.760 --> 38:03.240]  You have to be really, really entertaining to the general public, who may not be up
[38:03.240 --> 38:06.520]  to speed on some of these topics.
[38:06.520 --> 38:14.920]  Well, you've certainly done that, Michael, and let's spend some time on some of the
[38:14.920 --> 38:19.880]  previous episodes, and then give people a little bird's eye view inside scoop on what's
[38:19.880 --> 38:24.040]  coming up Wednesday night, and the next Wednesday night.
[38:24.040 --> 38:29.520]  Of course, Big Brother airs Wednesday night, 10 p.m. Eastern, 9 p.m. Central, and then,
[38:29.520 --> 38:33.520]  of course, next Wednesday, it's going to be the secret society episode that gets into
[38:33.520 --> 38:36.560]  the population reduction control, everything.
[38:36.560 --> 38:41.080]  I'm a huge part of that program, and very, very excited about it.
[38:41.080 --> 38:45.400]  But specifically, the global warming special, I mean, you went right to the heart of it,
[38:45.400 --> 38:48.440]  to Maury Strong, sent cameras to China.
[38:48.440 --> 38:50.640]  You went and interviewed the UN scientist.
[38:50.640 --> 38:53.240]  You went and interviewed myself.
[38:53.240 --> 38:58.520]  You got George Hunt, who's refused to do interviews in the last decade.
[38:58.520 --> 39:01.880]  We got him to talk, and he worked with Strong for over five years.
[39:01.880 --> 39:04.320]  I mean, this was an amazing television show.
[39:04.320 --> 39:09.960]  Well, thank you, and, you know, the thing about getting those people is we worked really
[39:09.960 --> 39:16.920]  hard, as I said before, about coming up with stuff that even people that are up to speed
[39:16.920 --> 39:19.880]  on this may not know, or may not have had the chance to know.
[39:19.880 --> 39:24.320]  I mean, there's a guy named Ben Stanter, you know, a lot of people had said, oh, Ben Stanter
[39:24.320 --> 39:29.600]  put the data, and for him to admit on camera, as you said, well, yeah, I did, and of course
[39:29.600 --> 39:32.640]  he has an explanation for it.
[39:32.640 --> 39:37.840]  You know, and when we were doing the show, the network was really scared, oh, you know,
[39:37.840 --> 39:39.240]  how can you attack global warming?
[39:39.240 --> 39:43.280]  You know, everyone knows global warming is a bad thing, and even Governor Ventura was
[39:43.280 --> 39:45.240]  like, oh, I believe in global warming.
[39:45.240 --> 39:50.360]  At the end of the show, all of us involved in it, behind the scenes, all looked at each
[39:50.360 --> 39:54.360]  other and went, wow, we really came up with some information.
[39:54.360 --> 40:00.920]  Then, that too, climate change, which validated everything we said, absolutely validated everything
[40:00.920 --> 40:01.920]  we said.
[40:01.920 --> 40:05.800]  So, we all sat around the production office, sort of, we're patting ourselves on the back,
[40:05.800 --> 40:11.280]  but wow, we were ahead of that curve, and you know, we really were, and that was a really
[40:11.280 --> 40:12.280]  good feeling.
[40:12.280 --> 40:17.720]  Let's talk about that, and the last three months, because, I mean, these shows are
[40:17.720 --> 40:18.720]  very fresh.
[40:18.720 --> 40:20.560]  They were being shot right up to the last minute.
[40:20.560 --> 40:26.320]  I was in Los Angeles just a month and a half ago, organizing with you guys the George Hunt
[40:26.320 --> 40:33.640]  interview, and then you guys had the show in the can three, four weeks ago, right as
[40:33.640 --> 40:35.360]  climate gate breaks.
[40:35.360 --> 40:40.280]  You guys already had a bunch of climate gate, where the UN and others were caught red-handed
[40:40.280 --> 40:41.800]  faking data.
[40:41.800 --> 40:51.160]  Then the coup de gras, the icing on the cake, the absolute proof comes out, only verifying
[40:51.160 --> 40:53.400]  what you guys had separately discovered.
[40:53.400 --> 40:55.360]  That shows what a good investigation you were doing.
[40:55.360 --> 41:00.640]  You interviewed Lord Moncton and so many others, right before Moncton already burst
[41:00.640 --> 41:04.960]  on the scene here in the U.S. and became a phenomenon with tens of millions of views
[41:04.960 --> 41:09.080]  on YouTube, of his speeches, and the interviews we've done here live on the radio.
[41:09.080 --> 41:15.000]  I mean, perfect timing as the entire global warming, man-made global warming fraud burst
[41:15.000 --> 41:16.160]  into flames.
[41:16.160 --> 41:17.400]  The television show airs.
[41:17.400 --> 41:20.160]  I mean, talk about Providence.
[41:20.160 --> 41:22.680]  That's almost revolutionary war-level Providence.
[41:22.680 --> 41:27.320]  Well, yeah, I mean, I'd like to think it's that important.
[41:27.320 --> 41:28.320]  We did get lucky.
[41:28.320 --> 41:35.360]  You know, the thing that convinced me was, Richard Lyndon, I know you saw him, he's a
[41:35.360 --> 41:39.920]  classic MIT professor, you know, I doubt he knows how to, you know, burn his car on or
[41:39.920 --> 41:46.040]  change a light bulb, and his whole life, but in climate, and this guy is an MIT professor,
[41:46.040 --> 41:47.040]  no accident.
[41:47.040 --> 41:51.720]  He doesn't work for the oil company, and he's paid by anybody but MIT.
[41:51.720 --> 41:55.120]  And I talked to him on the phone, he didn't want to do the interview, he said, well, you
[41:55.120 --> 41:59.480]  know, it's very complicated, climate change is very, you know, there's just so many issues.
[41:59.480 --> 42:03.080]  I said, well, if people are pushing the data, why are they doing it?
[42:03.080 --> 42:07.520]  And he said, there was a pause on the phone, and he said, money and power.
[42:07.520 --> 42:11.800]  I said, you're my guy.
[42:11.800 --> 42:14.480]  And also, you guys, this is really reality TV.
[42:14.480 --> 42:19.760]  You shot in your war room with Jesse and yourself and other members of the production, you're
[42:19.760 --> 42:24.880]  all arguing about whether it's real or not, and Jesse says, well, I think they're making
[42:24.880 --> 42:29.880]  money off this, but it still might be real, and you are the guy who says, no, guys, I've
[42:29.880 --> 42:31.560]  seen the documentation.
[42:31.560 --> 42:33.280]  It looks like this is a scam.
[42:33.280 --> 42:36.720]  I mean, I got to hand it to you, and that was shot, what, three, four or five months ago,
[42:36.720 --> 42:39.720]  I'm not sure of the date, but I know it was shot at the beginning of the production of
[42:39.720 --> 42:41.240]  the Global Warming episode.
[42:41.240 --> 42:44.800]  You turn out to be the guy who was right from the beginning on the TV show.
[42:44.800 --> 42:50.040]  Well, I read the research really carefully, and I'll say something funny, this coming
[42:50.040 --> 42:53.800]  week's episode, this Wednesday night, exactly the opposite happened.
[42:53.800 --> 42:57.760]  You'll see me in the war room, and I really get into it with Jesse about his brother
[42:57.760 --> 43:03.720]  issue to do a little segue here, but him and he and I really got into it, and it wasn't
[43:03.720 --> 43:04.720]  fake.
[43:04.720 --> 43:09.680]  We got hot at each other, because I was kind of saying, well, wait a minute, I'm not saying
[43:09.680 --> 43:15.600]  the Patriot acts are a good thing, but if a couple of terrorists are sitting on cell phones
[43:15.600 --> 43:19.440]  and there are rallies having a burger, and they're talking about blowing up the ball
[43:19.440 --> 43:23.960]  that I'm about to go into with my family, I damn well want to know about it.
[43:23.960 --> 43:29.160]  We got really hot at me, because that's what I felt at the beginning of the episode.
[43:29.160 --> 43:34.000]  What you don't see is, because we didn't have time, at the end of the episode, when I look
[43:34.000 --> 43:41.240]  at him and I go, I don't know if I can curse on your show, but I don't know, I go, holy
[43:41.240 --> 43:47.040]  earth, you were right, and I was wrong, so the drama of the episode is real.
[43:47.040 --> 43:52.000]  Again, you'll see me in the war room just really getting hot at him, but he gets hot
[43:52.000 --> 43:53.000]  at me.
[43:53.000 --> 43:56.280]  So, it's really interesting what happened, how we changed during the show.
[43:56.280 --> 44:01.840]  Yeah, for folks that don't know, Jesse's for real, getting to hang out with him over
[44:01.840 --> 44:07.280]  the last three, four years, I guess four years ago when I first met him, and being off-camera,
[44:07.280 --> 44:14.480]  he's really a smart guy, he's multifaceted, but he really does get angry in arguments,
[44:14.480 --> 44:20.360]  or not even so much angry, he gets very focused and very, very adamant and serious driving
[44:20.360 --> 44:23.120]  around in the Hill Country, where they might have had huge arguments, so when people see
[44:23.120 --> 44:31.600]  these arguments, this really happens, I mean, Ventura really does turn into a big bear.
[44:31.600 --> 44:37.240]  Yeah, and he's passionate, he's absolutely a believer, we are not going to do a show
[44:37.240 --> 44:44.000]  unless he believes in it, you know, and here's a guy who sits and reads all day long, you
[44:44.000 --> 44:47.760]  know, spends his time really doing the research, really doing the reading, and we don't do
[44:47.760 --> 44:51.800]  a topic unless he believes in it, you know, global warming was a bit of a push, because
[44:51.800 --> 44:55.000]  as I say at the beginning, he didn't believe in it, but at the end of the episode, and
[44:55.000 --> 45:00.080]  now with climate change, he was totally a convert.
[45:00.080 --> 45:03.880]  And it's not just a who-done-it, everyone watching is literally brought along with
[45:03.880 --> 45:08.560]  the process, and I have to say it, this is something new in reality TV, usually it's
[45:08.560 --> 45:14.040]  some rich teenager with her boyfriend getting drunk and fighting with her parents on the
[45:14.040 --> 45:20.960]  telephone and car wrecks, this is a bunch of researchers, and Governor Jesse Ventura
[45:20.960 --> 45:27.680]  literally trying to get to the bottom of something, you are transported there to the debates,
[45:27.680 --> 45:32.320]  to the interviews, to the different places in the world that you guys travel.
[45:32.320 --> 45:38.720]  Yeah, and as I say, that backstage stuff, that war room stuff, that stuff is real,
[45:38.720 --> 45:45.240]  we, you know, and you'll see there, our other guy, Alex Piper, he's their skeptic, he and
[45:45.240 --> 45:48.880]  the Governor, we really get into it, I mean, you should just put half of the camera, these
[45:48.880 --> 45:53.520]  guys will just go toe-to-toe, and they'll battle it out, they will absolutely battle
[45:53.520 --> 45:55.520]  it out.
[45:55.520 --> 46:00.880]  It's amazing, I know you don't want to give people too much of a spoiler on this, but
[46:00.880 --> 46:06.360]  for our listeners, Michael Brieverman, executive producer of the number one new television show
[46:06.360 --> 46:13.320]  on TruTV, conspiracy theory that airs 10 p.m. Eastern, 9 p.m. Central every Wednesday night,
[46:13.320 --> 46:18.560]  give us a little bit of a window into this week's episode that airs in 48 hours.
[46:18.560 --> 46:25.240]  Well, I want to say one thing that your listeners, Alex, if there's one show in this series
[46:25.240 --> 46:32.320]  that you're going to watch, make it this week, this week's show, and obviously I have a little
[46:32.320 --> 46:36.640]  stake in it, but this week's show blew me away when I started doing the research with
[46:36.640 --> 46:38.520]  staff when I started doing the research.
[46:38.520 --> 46:43.960]  I can tell you, without hyping it, there are two facts in this show, which is the Big
[46:43.960 --> 46:48.800]  Brother conspiracy, this one tonight, there are two facts that will absolutely blow you
[46:48.800 --> 46:49.800]  away.
[46:49.800 --> 46:56.840]  There's stuff that we uncovered that I didn't know about, and I'm a pretty good researcher,
[46:56.840 --> 47:03.160]  and we put it on the screen, and again, I don't think it's hyping or being modest to
[47:03.160 --> 47:07.600]  say that there's a couple of revelations, I'll call them, that will absolutely shock
[47:07.600 --> 47:11.520]  you and get you over the head, and you're going to be sitting at home going, I didn't
[47:11.520 --> 47:12.520]  know that.
[47:12.520 --> 47:20.680]  It's a call to action, because if we don't do something in five, ten, three, six years,
[47:20.680 --> 47:24.920]  whatever it is, we are going to be living on the prison planet.
[47:24.920 --> 47:30.120]  Absolutely, now talking to Ventura a year ago when the pilot was shot, which is the
[47:30.120 --> 47:34.160]  9-11 episode, the rest of it was shot this year, and talking to you behind the scenes
[47:34.160 --> 47:38.480]  and others, whatever you want to say about the mainstream media, they have never allowed
[47:38.480 --> 47:44.320]  anything like this to air before, and it was really hard to get this on the air.
[47:44.320 --> 47:50.320]  I remember just two days before the Harp special aired, Jesse privately said to me still,
[47:50.320 --> 47:55.200]  I don't think it's going to air, I mean, when you guys say that, that's not hype, genuinely
[47:55.200 --> 47:59.160]  Ventura didn't think it was going to air, I don't know how this big brother is going
[47:59.160 --> 48:04.280]  to air, I don't know how the 9-11 aired, why, because I know there's a lot of control
[48:04.280 --> 48:07.960]  over the media, you know, every person in a production company or at a network isn't
[48:07.960 --> 48:12.240]  a globalist agent, but they, you know, don't like to go with things that are too controversial
[48:12.240 --> 48:16.760]  against the government, how is this getting on the air, I mean, how did you guys do this?
[48:16.760 --> 48:20.480]  I mean, you've done something no one's ever done.
[48:20.480 --> 48:26.120]  Well, I give all the credit to the governor, the governor was so passionate as I said before,
[48:26.120 --> 48:30.840]  he went to the network, I went with him, and he sat there and looked at the boss of the
[48:30.840 --> 48:35.680]  network in the eye, I give everybody credit here, including the boss of the network, he
[48:35.680 --> 48:41.440]  looked him in the eye and said, you let me do this show, you let me cover the topics,
[48:41.440 --> 48:45.760]  the information I want to cover, I will guarantee you people will watch, and that's exactly
[48:45.760 --> 48:46.760]  how it turned out.
[48:46.760 --> 48:50.160]  And, you know, I'm the first guy, because I work in the TV business, I'm the first
[48:50.160 --> 48:57.320]  guy to knock no final TV executive, because I've met my share of them, but I will give
[48:57.320 --> 49:02.680]  true TV an amazing amount of credit that they actually followed through, and they had the
[49:02.680 --> 49:06.880]  courage of their convictions, and they put the show on, and as I say, you know, the governor
[49:06.880 --> 49:11.040]  lost his gentleman's bet with me and everybody else, but those would ever see the light of
[49:11.040 --> 49:14.480]  day, but here we are, so it's kind of a miracle.
[49:14.480 --> 49:22.560]  Well, Wednesday night, 10 p.m. Eastern, 9 p.m. Central, folks, we need this show to continue
[49:22.560 --> 49:27.960]  to be an even bigger success, because this will force mainstream media to understand
[49:27.960 --> 49:32.560]  that the American people are waking up and want the truth, and that if the mainstream
[49:32.560 --> 49:36.280]  media doesn't start covering these issues, they're going to lose all their viewers, and
[49:36.280 --> 49:41.880]  I think at the heart of it, I remember three years ago, I was talking to a Hollywood film
[49:41.880 --> 49:44.600]  director, and I don't know if she's still there, I don't know the details, but he was
[49:44.600 --> 49:50.040]  talking about a new head of court TV, and that it was going to shift to a new format,
[49:50.040 --> 49:55.680]  and he said they were looking then at these issues, and then I talked to a BBC producer
[49:55.680 --> 50:00.640]  who also makes shows for the U.S., and I know that true TV even three years ago was looking
[50:00.640 --> 50:06.280]  at this, so I think Ventura with his gravitas and his history and yourself, Michael Braverman,
[50:06.280 --> 50:11.960]  the right place, the right time, the right people, the right brains, cable television,
[50:11.960 --> 50:17.320]  has to start doing something avant-garde to get viewers, and I think that's the real reason
[50:17.320 --> 50:22.960]  that this is airing, and also you guys did this on a shoestring for TV productions, and
[50:22.960 --> 50:28.280]  so you guys also gambled a lot, you bet a lot of your time and energy on this, and so
[50:28.280 --> 50:30.280]  again, I salute you, Michael.
[50:30.280 --> 50:34.600]  I will thank you, and our production partners do too, and again, I give all the credit to
[50:34.600 --> 50:39.560]  the governor because he is the spearhead, he was the point of the spear on this whole
[50:39.560 --> 50:40.560]  show.
[50:40.560 --> 50:44.760]  And you guys put amazing amounts of energy into this final segment with Michael Braverman,
[50:44.760 --> 50:48.800]  the executive producer of Conspiracy Theory, you can see it this Wednesday night, and we
[50:48.800 --> 50:56.200]  come back, we're going to do five minutes on next week's episode, Secret Societies.
[50:56.200 --> 50:59.600]  This one is a barn burner, stay with us.

[52:02.120 --> 52:05.880]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[52:05.880 --> 52:09.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[52:09.000 --> 52:13.360]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[52:13.360 --> 52:14.360]  at home.
[52:14.360 --> 52:19.040]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[52:19.040 --> 52:20.040]  calling the shots.
[52:20.040 --> 52:25.320]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[52:25.320 --> 52:28.640]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[52:28.640 --> 52:34.480]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing
[52:34.480 --> 52:35.480]  world government.
[52:35.480 --> 52:39.840]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and their arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[52:39.840 --> 52:41.840]  is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[52:41.840 --> 52:47.400]  Today, it seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[52:47.400 --> 52:49.240]  a fall of the Republic.

[54:36.320 --> 54:59.440]  latest
[54:59.440 --> 55:03.240]  be. Something's rotten in the state of Denmark if it isn't. In the three or four minutes
[55:03.240 --> 55:10.240]  we've got left with Michael Braverman. Looking forward to the secret society episode next
[55:10.240 --> 55:15.940]  week in case we don't get you back on to talk about it next Wednesday. Give us a little
[55:15.940 --> 55:17.440]  window into that.
[55:17.440 --> 55:24.600]  Well that is another mindblower. You know, this is something that I think the governor
[55:24.600 --> 55:29.800]  also was a little bit skeptical about when we started. You know, I mean you can sit around
[55:29.800 --> 55:34.360]  and talk and I know you do Alex and you do a fantastic job. You know, you can say that
[55:34.360 --> 55:37.840]  there are these groups that build a burden. You know, society and they're out there and
[55:37.840 --> 55:41.720]  they're right in the world. Everyone's going to roll their eyes and go, yeah, sure. But
[55:41.720 --> 55:46.080]  when you started, you know, when we started to dig into it, we found some stuff. As I
[55:46.080 --> 55:49.640]  say, you know, anybody who watches these shows, whether you like the shows or not,
[55:49.640 --> 55:52.840]  you're going to turn that TV off, but you're going to walk away, or you're going to sit
[55:52.840 --> 55:56.880]  on your couch and you're going to go, wow, I didn't know that. You're going to see some
[55:56.880 --> 56:02.560]  facts about the Bilderberg that I guarantee you, even people who are regular listeners
[56:02.560 --> 56:06.880]  to your show and really into this stuff didn't know. So that's our promise to the viewers
[56:06.880 --> 56:11.840]  is that there's going to be new facts, new things that hopefully will be mindblowing
[56:11.840 --> 56:16.440]  every week. And there are things about the Bilderbergs and other secret societies that
[56:16.440 --> 56:22.120]  I got to be honest with you. They scared me.
[56:22.120 --> 56:29.840]  Well, I did consulting for a scanner, darkly produced in 2005 with Keanu Reeves, writer
[56:29.840 --> 56:33.800]  Woody Harrelson, a bunch of others. Of course, I'm in the film and I did consulting with
[56:33.800 --> 56:38.400]  Tommy Pallotta, one of the producers and Richard Linkler, the director. And I thought
[56:38.400 --> 56:42.640]  I knew everything. They discovered a bunch of stuff that I had trouble believing until
[56:42.640 --> 56:46.800]  I saw the documents. So yeah, I mean, don't think you ever know it all folks. I know you
[56:46.800 --> 56:51.160]  guys did deep research and have discovered some things that when I found out about it
[56:51.160 --> 56:56.440]  and then went and looked it up, it's just, it's so horrible.
[56:56.440 --> 57:02.040]  Well, it's amazing what's going on. As you say, Alex, never gets reported in the mainstream
[57:02.040 --> 57:06.000]  media, but I think that's changing and hopefully it's changing. I'll say one thing. You mentioned
[57:06.000 --> 57:12.000]  Hollywood. I get calls from people that aren't allowed to go to Washington and want to break
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  that down.
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.600]  Michael, your phone's breaking up a little bit. Can you get closer to it?
[57:16.600 --> 57:17.600]  Yeah, how about now, Alex?
[57:17.600 --> 57:18.600]  Sounds good. Go ahead.
[57:18.600 --> 57:22.600]  I was going to say really quickly, you mentioned Hollywood. I get calls, I would say, on a
[57:22.600 --> 57:30.600]  weekly basis. I'm on Hollywood and I'm born to see big, big movies or big movies.
[57:30.600 --> 57:34.280]  Michael, you know, I think it's your, because I know you're on a cell phone doing a screening
[57:34.280 --> 57:36.280]  and an event and I apologize.
[57:36.280 --> 57:40.600]  Yeah, yeah. I mean, just in closing, finish up, yeah. Get in close to the microphone.
[57:40.600 --> 57:45.400]  Yeah, I'm pretty close. So anyways, just to reiterate, there's people, I get calls on
[57:45.400 --> 57:51.960]  a weekly basis from big stars, TV stars, movie stars, people that everybody would know, want
[57:51.960 --> 57:57.680]  to talk about are starting to believe in this stuff. I can't put them on TV yet, but if
[57:57.680 --> 58:02.360]  we get picked up, people support us and we go on. I think there's going to be some reveal
[58:02.360 --> 58:07.160]  shockers hopefully in the second season about people stepping out of the shadows, famous
[58:07.160 --> 58:11.920]  people. You see on TV and you've seen the movies stepping out of the shadows and standing
[58:11.920 --> 58:13.920]  up and being counted.
[58:13.920 --> 58:17.240]  Yeah, that's what I've found and obviously I'm not in the Hollywood and I'm not a big
[58:17.240 --> 58:23.360]  TV producer like yourself, but I can't believe the, I mean, the top name Hollywood stars.
[58:23.360 --> 58:28.000]  Obviously, Charlie Sheen, people like Jesse Ventura that have come on my show that we've
[58:28.000 --> 58:34.240]  woken up to a certain extent. Charlie's completely awake and Ventura's waking up. It's just,
[58:34.240 --> 58:38.240]  it's a huge iceberg that we only see the tip of. Michael Breiberman stay there. Let me
[58:38.240 --> 58:42.360]  say bye to you during the break.
[58:42.360 --> 58:50.320]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.

[1:00:05.200 --> 1:00:30.480]  I'm going to play a short clip. I'm going to play more of it coming up in the next hour.
[1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:47.920]  I'm going to play a short clip. I'm going to play more of it coming up in the next hour.
[1:00:47.920 --> 1:01:17.760]  I'm going to play a short clip. I'm going to play a short clip.
[1:01:17.760 --> 1:01:47.440]  I'm going to play a short clip. I'm going to play a short clip.
[1:01:47.440 --> 1:02:17.280]  I'm going to play a short clip. I'm going to play a short clip.
[1:02:17.280 --> 1:02:47.120]  I'm going to play a short clip. I'm going to play a short clip.
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:52.920]  It has come on air a bunch and this is basically all he thinks about and works on, but he tells
[1:02:52.920 --> 1:02:58.440]  me separately, not just people I've been contacted by or I've met with, but then I talk to other
[1:02:58.440 --> 1:03:05.360]  directors, other movie stars. Basically, 80% of all the top stars are completely obsessed
[1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:10.760]  with this. It's not snowboarding. It's not hookers they're obsessed with. It's not partying.
[1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:16.120]  It's not surfing. They are obsessed with this. Hollywood is on fire and awake to the new
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:21.320]  world order. How do we get them to come out and then you get a cultural shift away from
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:27.000]  the fake left that Hollywood has been known as? Michael, we are sitting on top of something
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:28.760]  really big. Do you get that feeling?
[1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:34.240]  Yeah, I think we could be. But you've got to understand one thing. Charlie Sheen, when
[1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:41.480]  he came out of the shadows, he has taken unbelievable abuse. Unbelievable abuse. I will go so far
[1:03:41.480 --> 1:03:46.280]  to say he's probably hurt his career, even though he's got a nice career. Obviously he's
[1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:51.080]  on a TV show, but it takes courage because the left, the old left, that really still
[1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:57.480]  runs Hollywood, they are militantly opposed to anybody talking about these issues, militantly
[1:03:57.480 --> 1:04:02.840]  opposed. That's something that we all deal with. He really starts to come out. I applaud
[1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:05.840]  him for taking huge amount of courage.
[1:04:05.840 --> 1:04:10.480]  Again, I'm aware of this. Most people aren't. You're more aware of it than I am. Michael
[1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:15.080]  Brayberman, again, big TV producer with a lot of hit shows and things under his belt.
[1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:20.400]  That's what I'm saying. I don't think listeners realize the sea change this signifies and
[1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:23.280]  I don't see how they're not going to pick it back up with these record ratings. But
[1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:28.080]  as you said, there's a lot of powerful people out there. That's why it's so important.
[1:04:28.080 --> 1:04:33.720]  This show even be a bigger hit because ladies and gentlemen, you will see top movie stars
[1:04:33.720 --> 1:04:40.240]  on television on this program and you guys are trailblazers. And so to the victor goes
[1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:45.360]  the spoils. Michael, you certainly have hit the barbed wire. You are like Lewis and Clark,
[1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:49.840]  you and Jesse Ventura, and I am just ecstatic to be involved. We're going to let you go.
[1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:52.720]  I'm going to say bye to you during this break, but we will let you go now to get back to
[1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:58.680]  your meeting. It airs this Wednesday night. The Big Brother special folks tell everybody
[1:04:58.680 --> 1:05:03.600]  you know, this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar
[1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:08.560]  power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[1:05:08.560 --> 1:05:13.600]  bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:05:13.600 --> 1:05:18.680]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:23.320]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[1:05:23.320 --> 1:05:28.960]  is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:33.280]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[1:05:33.280 --> 1:05:37.440]  of families lose their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power
[1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:41.760]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe
[1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:46.080]  in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:53.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:59.920]  doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[1:05:59.920 --> 1:06:05.880]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[1:06:05.880 --> 1:06:10.560]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly
[1:06:10.560 --> 1:06:15.680]  into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory system
[1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:20.720]  is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator
[1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:27.200]  infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the
[1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:32.680]  silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream. With continued legislation threatening the
[1:06:32.680 --> 1:06:38.520]  sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the
[1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:43.840]  Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making
[1:06:43.840 --> 1:06:51.000]  production fast and simple. Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:57.880]  technology of the Silver Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[1:06:57.880 --> 1:07:05.960]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:11.720]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from
[1:07:11.720 --> 1:07:16.400]  underneath the Americans at home. We've turned a tremendous influence on our president and
[1:07:16.400 --> 1:07:22.240]  Congress, and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:27.280]  as American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:33.200]  nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes
[1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:37.600]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking
[1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:41.800]  for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to? Today seems
[1:07:41.800 --> 1:07:48.560]  like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[1:07:48.560 --> 1:07:54.640]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right
[1:07:54.640 --> 1:08:05.600]  now at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[1:08:05.600 --> 1:08:12.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:21.920]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:08:21.920 --> 1:08:27.920]  Man, that Michael Braverman conversation just blew me away. See, I don't bug all these
[1:08:27.920 --> 1:08:32.400]  Hollywood people, and, you know, Braverman called me every few weeks. I call him. We
[1:08:32.400 --> 1:08:36.240]  talk. I'm going to be a bigger part as a consultant, bigger part of the TV show, already
[1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:40.640]  the biggest part outside of Intera, with conspiracy theory, number one show on true
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:45.280]  TV right now, highest ratings ever for a new show, exposing Al Gore as a fraud, Maury
[1:08:45.280 --> 1:08:51.000]  Strong, the New World Order, Brad Pitt, Bruce Willis, all freaking out. I mean, you just
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:55.640]  can't. It doesn't get any better than this. You've got the old Hollywood order, the old
[1:08:55.640 --> 1:08:59.560]  left. You've got Michael Braverman, who's pretty high-powered, talking about the old
[1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:03.640]  left freaking out, because it's not a left-right issue. They just want to keep that paradigm
[1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:08.920]  in place. There is a rebellion in Hollywood. I have known about this for at least a decade,
[1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:15.000]  big time for six years, and Charlie Sheen broke the ice on this. I just, we are so close,
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:21.120]  ladies and gentlemen, we are so close to shifting the entire paradigm. That was some breaking
[1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:25.240]  news that you just heard. Just like conspiracy theory, last week with Ventura, I got Bill
[1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:31.800]  Santor on video to admit he cut out five scientists in his own internal report for the IPCC saying
[1:09:31.800 --> 1:09:36.040]  man does not contribute to global warming, that the earth may not even be warming. This
[1:09:36.040 --> 1:09:40.040]  is incredible. Okay, for the rest of the hour, then I'm getting into the terraforming being
[1:09:40.040 --> 1:09:44.600]  announced to geoengineering on CNN. Now the global warming control freaks want to quote
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:48.840]  control our weather, probably so they can create calamities and get their pretext for
[1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:59.440]  global taxes. James Dilling-Pold is a best-selling author, journalist, author, TV critic, daily
[1:09:59.440 --> 1:10:05.640]  telegraph. He also writes for so many other great publications. He's a British journalist
[1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:10.320]  and novelist, was educated at Christ Church, Oxford. He is a member of several, author
[1:10:10.320 --> 1:10:15.600]  of several novels and two nonfiction books, How to Be Right, The Essential Guide to Making
[1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:21.480]  Lefty Liberals History, and Welcome to Obama Land. I have seen the future and it doesn't
[1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:25.680]  work. He writes for the Daily Telegraph and is a TV critic for the spectator. He has a
[1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:31.000]  blog, The Daily Telegraph, which he uses to disprove man-made climate change. And this
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:35.360]  is so exciting to have him on because he's one of the most prolific and detailed writers
[1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:41.640]  in the telegraph. We've got big headlines out about global government being established.
[1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:46.760]  We've got Gordon Brown. There will be nowhere to run from the New World Order. That's another
[1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:51.920]  great writer of the telegraph, Janet Daley. We have another one, Copenhagen Climate Summit,
[1:10:51.920 --> 1:10:58.880]  planned for EU to police countries emissions. And that's James Kirkup, if I think I'm pronouncing
[1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:02.680]  it right. So just great job over there at the telegraph. And it's good to have James
[1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:07.240]  Dilling-Poll on with us. Sir, wonderful to have you. Thank you for having me, Alex.
[1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:14.040]  I tell you, is it safe to say that the man-made global warming fraud has crashed and burned
[1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:19.440]  like the Hennenberg? I think we shouldn't count our chickens. Obviously, Christmas came
[1:11:19.440 --> 1:11:26.760]  early for you and me. First of all, with Climate Gate. And second, with the spectacular failure
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:33.760]  of the Copenhagen carbon fest loving. But I think we've got a long way to go. But don't
[1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:41.360]  forget, we've got, what, 20 years since the warmest started putting about this story.
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:46.120]  You remember the Rio conference? Yes. It was organized by your friend and mine, Maurice
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:55.520]  Strong. Now, we skeptics have got a lot of catching up to do before we can undo all the
[1:11:55.520 --> 1:11:59.680]  damage which has already been done. All the lies and propaganda which has been put about
[1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:06.040]  by the mainstream media. All the mechanisms that have been put in place by Kyoto, for
[1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:13.160]  example, for carbon trading. You've got the carbon trading floor set up up in Chicago.
[1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:19.200]  You've got 10% owned by Goldman Sachs, for example. So you've got a lot of people out
[1:12:19.200 --> 1:12:26.960]  there who are, who stand to make a lot of money out of this whole ATW thing. And they
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:34.480]  aren't going to surrender that money easily. Absolutely. We have different numbers. Some
[1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:40.680]  say over 100 billion in the U.S. spent on this fraud and in buying off the scientists
[1:12:40.680 --> 1:12:44.960]  literally because you can't get funding unless you believe in the chicken little scenario.
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:49.960]  Any idea how much globally has been spent by governments and corporations pushing this
[1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:56.920]  takeover? All I know at the moment is that the global carbon trading market is currently
[1:12:56.920 --> 1:13:03.480]  worth about $120 billion. Now, this, don't forget, is trading something that doesn't
[1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:09.360]  actually exist really. It's just thin air, isn't it? Carbon. CO2. We breathe it out.
[1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:14.880]  The idea that traders have created a mechanism whereby they can trade the stuff that we all
[1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:22.120]  exhale is Enron economics writ large. And funnily enough, the guy who invented CO2 trading
[1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:30.320]  was none other than Ken Lay, the guy who founded Enron. And this market, this false market,
[1:13:30.320 --> 1:13:36.760]  is estimated to increase into the trillions within the next two decades. So we're going
[1:13:36.760 --> 1:13:43.120]  to be finding that the world's most valuable traded commodity, even more valuable than
[1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:50.360]  oil or gold, is this CO2 thing. And the only way this market can survive is by pan-global
[1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:57.160]  government regulation. So if America says no to cap and trade, that means that the bottom
[1:13:57.160 --> 1:14:03.240]  will fall out of the carbon trading market. And a lot of bad people, including Al Gore
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:07.640]  and I think Morris Strong, will end up losing a lot of money, which is why I think it's
[1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:13.320]  very much in everybody's interest that we urge, for example, the U.S. Senate, when it
[1:14:13.320 --> 1:14:19.920]  votes next year, to vote out cap and trade. Because that will be, I suspect, the real
[1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:23.320]  death knell of this great scam.
[1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:28.840]  Absolutely. Now Gordo Brown, the unelected prime minister of England that no one can
[1:14:28.840 --> 1:14:35.160]  seem to get rid of, he is saying, oh, I'm writing the agreement that the industrialized
[1:14:35.160 --> 1:14:40.680]  nations have signed on, even if the third world got wise and bolted, that the West will
[1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:45.520]  give money to the IMF and World Bank, I guess, to dangle in front of the third world to sign
[1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:49.760]  on, which of course, conservative estimates have it at 10 million a year extra that will
[1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:56.200]  starve to death, who are living on that razor's edge between starvation and life. He's saying
[1:14:56.200 --> 1:15:01.560]  that they're just going to go ahead and implement it. Obama, last week, said, look, command
[1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:08.160]  and control. I don't care if the Senate doesn't ratify or go along. I'm going to use the EPA
[1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:15.560]  to declare CO2 as some type of deadly nerve gas. I mean, so they're just openly coming
[1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:22.920]  out as dictatorial creatures, and now they say the EU, and break this down for us, the
[1:15:22.920 --> 1:15:29.200]  EU is going to now keep track of everyone, even if you don't sign on. They're going
[1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:35.120]  to be your minder and hold back your IMF World Bank dole if you don't go along with it.
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:41.760]  Well, the European Union, certainly the European Socialist Superstate, has been a very early
[1:15:41.760 --> 1:15:52.280]  adopter of the whole carbon trading mechanisms. They are forcing all the member states to
[1:15:52.280 --> 1:16:00.480]  reduce their CO2 levels by X amount by 2020, and the various libtard governments have mostly
[1:16:00.480 --> 1:16:08.880]  embraced this wholeheartedly. It's interesting that the European Union has formed on this.
[1:16:08.880 --> 1:16:15.120]  Almost all the member states of the European Union went on those rare occasions where their
[1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:20.040]  people have had the chance to vote on the issue about whether or not they want to be
[1:16:20.040 --> 1:16:27.800]  part of this ever-increasing socialist superstate. They always say no. What does the European
[1:16:27.800 --> 1:16:34.080]  Union do? It always says, okay, we're just going to ignore the voter's request, democratic
[1:16:34.080 --> 1:16:40.120]  request, and we're going to carry on as usual and ride roughshod over their desires. This
[1:16:40.120 --> 1:16:48.680]  practice is also being adopted by the ATW, the International Global Warming Movement.
[1:16:48.680 --> 1:16:55.360]  Never mind all the scientific evidence that emerges, and it is emerging all the time,
[1:16:55.360 --> 1:16:59.600]  that global warming is not man-made, and even if there is global warming going on, it is
[1:16:59.600 --> 1:17:04.560]  not catastrophic. Never mind all scientific evidence. We are going to carry on with our
[1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:09.920]  program as before, completely disregarding. I don't know how presumably all your listeners
[1:17:09.920 --> 1:17:16.480]  are onside, Alex, but the thing I noticed blogging on this subject on the Internet is
[1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:25.440]  just how many people out there on the Internet are feeling betrayed by their government,
[1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:29.920]  by their newspapers, which are not telling them the truth about it.
[1:17:29.920 --> 1:17:35.520]  And that was my next point. I read ABC News. I read literally hundreds of the comments.
[1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:38.960]  I don't even really read the story. I go to the comments, and the mainstream media keeps
[1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:42.760]  shoveling the lie that everyone agrees that the earth is warming. Everyone agrees that
[1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:46.600]  polar bears are all dying, which is a total lie. Everyone agrees we've got to have a global
[1:17:46.600 --> 1:17:53.880]  government. And then literally 95% of the comments are saying we're sick of you liars,
[1:17:53.880 --> 1:17:57.400]  and they're well thought out. They're writing their own little mini articles with links
[1:17:57.400 --> 1:18:02.960]  to facts. There is a rebellion. I think the mainstream media, is this what you're getting
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:09.440]  at? The mainstream media is committing sepicoe by continuing the party line.
[1:18:09.440 --> 1:18:15.720]  Alex, your analysis is absolutely spot on. There is no question that this will be seen
[1:18:15.720 --> 1:18:21.840]  in the future when people analyze the deaths of the MSM. This will be the point where the
[1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:28.480]  MSM killed itself, because it has refused to move with the times. It's refused to address
[1:18:28.480 --> 1:18:33.520]  the issues that are of concern to its readers. I mean, unless you buy the idea that every
[1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:39.760]  single person, or 95%, as you say, of the people who use the internet are completely
[1:18:39.760 --> 1:18:48.480]  mad, unless you buy the theory, what you have to accept is that the interests of the people
[1:18:48.480 --> 1:18:54.760]  are not being served by, for example, the BBC, by pretty much every newspaper, like the New
[1:18:54.760 --> 1:19:00.320]  York Times, to the Times of London, and so on. They are being completely ignored. All
[1:19:00.320 --> 1:19:05.200]  these newspapers, and of course the BBC as well, and of course most of the mainstream
[1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:11.800]  TV networks in the US, apart from possibly Fox, all these organizations employ environment
[1:19:11.800 --> 1:19:18.520]  correspondence. All these so-called environment correspondence, they might as well be writing
[1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:24.800]  press releases for Greenpeace or Al Gore. They're lab dogs. They never question the
[1:19:24.800 --> 1:19:29.760]  scientific issues. They're not interested in finding out the truth. All they care about
[1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:34.960]  is towing a particular line, which is, the world is getting hotter. It's all our fault.
[1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:37.120]  We must spend more money now.
[1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:43.680]  Unbelievable. Let's continue then talking about the sepaku. That's when, I guess, the Japanese
[1:19:43.680 --> 1:19:48.840]  term for when they commit suicide with a short sword. That is pretty much what the mainstream
[1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:55.120]  media has already got the knife in. They're now pulling it up into their ribcage, completing
[1:19:55.120 --> 1:20:01.640]  the act of sepaku, and all I can say is more power to them. We'll be right back.
[1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:06.840]  This is an emergency alert. People don't die of H1N1 infection. They die from system-wide
[1:20:06.840 --> 1:20:11.920]  intoxication and toxic shock. Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection
[1:20:11.920 --> 1:20:17.200]  and immune hyperstimulation. Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize
[1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:22.320]  your body, adding to your death risk. Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections,

[1:21:02.400 --> 1:21:06.440]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone, but this is our
[1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:12.440]  last chance to not relive history. Is it finishing off this agenda? They'll be pulling the rug
[1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:17.280]  from underneath Americans at home. I have a tremendous influence on our president
[1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:22.440]  in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[1:21:22.440 --> 1:21:27.960]  us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies
[1:21:27.960 --> 1:21:33.520]  of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on
[1:21:33.520 --> 1:21:38.160]  its ashes, constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[1:21:38.160 --> 1:21:42.280]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:48.120]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:54.640]  of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch

[1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:05.320]  Gold isn't for you. Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier
[1:22:05.320 --> 1:22:10.000]  gold and precious metal investing firms. I get it. You wouldn't buy gold if you believed
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:14.040]  that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions
[1:22:14.040 --> 1:22:18.320]  of dollars like bailout candy, that social security would be there for you. That's not
[1:22:18.320 --> 1:22:23.840]  what's happening. You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation,
[1:22:23.840 --> 1:22:27.920]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure. If all
[1:22:27.920 --> 1:22:32.080]  looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold. For the realists, there have
[1:22:32.080 --> 1:22:37.680]  never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold. Since 2001, the U.S. dollar index
[1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:43.480]  has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%. Right now, savvy investors are adding gold
[1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:47.640]  to their portfolios. You should, too. Find out what they know. Call us and I'll send

[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:14.440]  Daily Telegraph, writer. James Dillingpole is our guest. He's a best-selling author.
[1:24:14.440 --> 1:24:18.960]  Nonfiction books like How to Be Right, The Essential Guide to Making Left Liberals History,
[1:24:18.960 --> 1:24:23.640]  and Welcome to Obama Land. I've seen your future and it doesn't work. And he writes
[1:24:23.640 --> 1:24:27.400]  for The Daily Telegraph and is a TV critic for The Spectator. He has a blog at The Daily
[1:24:27.400 --> 1:24:34.640]  Telegraph which he uses to disprove man-made climate change. JamesDillingPole.com is the
[1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:43.400]  website that's James Dillingpole, D-E-L-I-N-G-Pole.com. Okay, you got cut off by the satellite break.
[1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:48.760]  You were getting into the mainstream media committing suicide because they just are
[1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:49.760]  such arrogant elitists. Continue.
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:54.800]  Well, I'm going to say how fantastic it's been for people like you and me because we
[1:24:54.800 --> 1:25:00.160]  are the guys who are putting out the truth when the people, the guardians of the truth
[1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:06.440]  are no longer doing their job. We used to rely on newspapers like The Times and so on to
[1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:11.280]  be telling us what's going on in the world and instead their response seems to be to
[1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:19.200]  accuse us all of false consciousness. If only the government spend a bit more educating
[1:25:19.200 --> 1:25:24.480]  us about global warming, then we'd see the truth seems to be their line. And this ain't
[1:25:24.480 --> 1:25:31.680]  so. I've never come across a greater disjunct between what real people think about something
[1:25:31.680 --> 1:25:36.360]  and what the government and the media and so on are telling them to think. It's extraordinary.
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:42.520]  I think we've got a divided world. It's like we're living in parallel universes where on
[1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:48.800]  the one hand you've got big government, big oil, big business, the green movement. And
[1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:54.920]  on the other hand, you've got ordinary people. We're living in different universes.
[1:25:54.920 --> 1:25:59.920]  That's a key point that you just raised is that the control left always says, oh, you're
[1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:03.440]  working for the oil companies if you don't believe in manmade global warming. But then
[1:26:03.440 --> 1:26:09.320]  I go look at the main funders. It's big corporations, big oil, the stock markets who want a new
[1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:14.880]  derivative. They don't care if taxes get passed on the average blue collar or middle-class
[1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:20.320]  worker with a family and bills to pay. I mean, truly it is the people of the world. And now
[1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:25.920]  when you go to any comment page, whether it's YouTube or you name it, literally 90% or more
[1:26:25.920 --> 1:26:31.840]  agree with reality. And you've got this 10% telling us we're kooks. We're weirdos. We're
[1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:37.640]  crazy. One more example, hundreds of articles a day literally announcing global government,
[1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:42.080]  announcing world government. But then we talk about it and we get called kooks. I mean,
[1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:48.680]  this is crazy. Yeah, but that's because the people who are pushing ATW haven't got any
[1:26:48.680 --> 1:26:54.040]  arguments or facts on their side. So all they can do is resort to throwing out these
[1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:59.640]  accusations, for example, that deniers, so-called deniers, you know, that's to make us look
[1:26:59.640 --> 1:27:07.840]  like holocaust deniers. We are sponsored by big oil. Any scientist who speaks out against
[1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:14.080]  man-made global warming, they instantly say, oh, well, he's in the pay of the carbon industry.
[1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:21.160]  Well, the fact is that the carbon industry and big oil moved out of denialism a very
[1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:27.760]  long time ago. They sponsor eco-conferences. They're heavily exposed to the carbon trading
[1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:35.800]  market. They see ATW as a big opportunity to make money. That's how big companies operate.
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:40.760]  So, of course, they're not going to back the slide that they think is not being championed.
[1:27:40.760 --> 1:27:45.080]  Wasn't it Ken Lay in the mid-1990s with Al Gore that had a bunch of meetings with oil
[1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:49.920]  company execs that explained to them that this was a giant scam? They should jump on
[1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:56.600]  board? That was exactly what Ken Lay said. And I think, you know, people in the financial
[1:27:56.600 --> 1:28:02.680]  industries, they don't go in there because they care about mother nature or because
[1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:06.800]  they want to look after polar bears. They do it because, funnily enough, they want to
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:11.280]  make money. And whatever they see is the best way of making money is the means that they
[1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:20.040]  will choose. That's the nature of finance. But it doesn't mean to say that they've got
[1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:26.040]  rightness or truth on their side. They're just vultures picking over whatever they can.
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:34.280]  Well, they certainly are. How do you see the collapse of the mainstream media unrolling?
[1:28:34.280 --> 1:28:37.800]  I mean, if they are committing suicide, what is that process going to look like?
[1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:41.240]  I think it's going to be messy because I think what they're going to do when they realize
[1:28:41.240 --> 1:28:44.920]  the mistake they've made, they are going to start fighting back. And we're already
[1:28:44.920 --> 1:28:50.520]  seeing this. Have you noticed, for example, how certain media organizations are now trying
[1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:57.200]  to ban people from linking to articles on news sites?
[1:28:57.200 --> 1:29:00.760]  That's where I was going next. And we're going to come back and talk about that. You've got
[1:29:00.760 --> 1:29:07.080]  Australia saying we're going to employ Chinese-style net censorship of political stuff we don't
[1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:11.920]  like. The government will decide off of a complaint system. We've got England talking
[1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:17.200]  about maybe we should restrict. We've got Canada, the U.S. now talking about it. I agree.
[1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:21.520]  They're going to try to shut us up. Oh, definitely. In the same way that they're trying to shut
[1:29:21.520 --> 1:29:27.200]  down the, the talk radio stations in America, under the fairness doctrine, this, this idea
[1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:32.280]  that because talk radio tends to favor the right rather than the left, because that's
[1:29:32.280 --> 1:29:36.160]  because the right has got all the ideas and the left got none whatsoever. And no one wants
[1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:38.840]  to listen to a Libertad throwing on, throwing on about it.
[1:29:38.840 --> 1:29:45.240]  You know, for that reason, they have decided, oh, well, this is unfair. We must get big
[1:29:45.240 --> 1:29:51.160]  government to step in. James, stay there. Got a break again. We'll come right back.
[1:29:51.160 --> 1:29:58.560]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:29:58.560 --> 1:30:05.680]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[1:30:05.680 --> 1:30:10.280]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[1:30:10.280 --> 1:30:15.320]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your
[1:30:15.320 --> 1:30:20.760]  only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts?
[1:30:20.760 --> 1:30:25.360]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[1:30:25.360 --> 1:30:29.400]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[1:30:29.400 --> 1:30:33.680]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[1:30:33.680 --> 1:30:38.720]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your
[1:30:38.720 --> 1:30:44.280]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.

[1:33:52.720 --> 1:33:59.240]  mainstream media engages in lies. We're going to go back to our amazing guest, author, researcher,
[1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:05.720]  newspaper writer, James Dillingpole in just a moment. I want to encourage listeners to
[1:34:05.720 --> 1:34:13.000]  not procrastinate for Christmas. You can still give a gift of truth, a prisonplanet.tv membership
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:17.920]  as we fight the prisonplanet. All 20 plus of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book and
[1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:22.920]  any book format, the last two hours of the radio show every day, we simulcast a full television
[1:34:22.920 --> 1:34:27.600]  show here with the radio for prisonplanet.tv members, the higher quality podcast with the
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:33.560]  commercials cut out for prisonplanet.tv members, go create a username and passcode and give
[1:34:33.560 --> 1:34:38.800]  yourself a gift of a prisonplanet.tv membership, $5.95, and you sign up for a year, that's
[1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:43.840]  a month, you get it for like $3, so it's five plus months free when you sign up in the month
[1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:49.720]  of December. And six computers can simultaneously log on with the same username passcode, so
[1:34:49.720 --> 1:34:53.840]  give yourself a prisonplanet membership and then give your friends and family one or two
[1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:56.920]  people, I wouldn't give it to more because then it will lock you out if you all log on
[1:34:56.920 --> 1:35:03.000]  at the same time, the username and passcode for prisonplanet.tv and an e-card, so it's
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:08.400]  last minute shopping, give them a $5.95 trial membership or give them a year and save close
[1:35:08.400 --> 1:35:13.000]  to half off at prisonplanet.tv. And until the end of the year, we're offering my new
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:17.080]  film, Follow the Republic, that exposes how the big banks and others are behind the phony
[1:35:17.080 --> 1:35:22.920]  green movement to take over, the entire climate scam fraud, this two hour, 24 minute film,
[1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:28.440]  you can get it and get a Obama Joker t-shirt that the mainstream media here called to be
[1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:33.360]  banned. They said it should be illegal to criticize the president, literally on record.
[1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:38.400]  You get one of those shirts free when you get the DVD at infowars.com and the secure
[1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:42.680]  online video bookstore, shopping cart and all the other books and videos that are there.

[1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:16.560]  I want to sit back and let you talk about whatever you think is most important, how
[1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:20.600]  they're implementing global governance by stealth through this carbon system, how they're
[1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:24.480]  saying we don't care if countries didn't sign on, we're going to start regulating and controlling
[1:36:24.480 --> 1:36:30.960]  you. But when we got cut off, you were talking about censorship and how they're openly announcing
[1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:36.880]  how great it is to keep everyone safe. And there's been calls for Lord Monkton in major
[1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:42.400]  papers in England, that he's a climate tyrant, and that he should be charged with treason
[1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:50.000]  literally. I mean, you cannot make this level of brazen tyranny up. So, sir, please continue
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  along those lines.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:58.080]  Yeah, well, I think that the AGW scam, the anthropogenic global warming scam, is the
[1:36:58.080 --> 1:37:02.040]  big one. I mean, there are other problems in the world, you know, Obamacare and things
[1:37:02.040 --> 1:37:08.280]  like that, and Islamophagism obviously is a big, big problem. But I would say that the
[1:37:08.280 --> 1:37:15.600]  issue whose evil creeping tentacles delve into ever deeper recesses of our lives, the
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:22.360]  really big one, the dangerous beast, is undoubtedly manmade global warming and the industry pushing
[1:37:22.360 --> 1:37:31.520]  this idea. Because it is an excuse to tax humanity on a scale never before envisaged.
[1:37:31.520 --> 1:37:39.080]  They are talking, the International Energy Agency reckons that to reduce manmade global
[1:37:39.080 --> 1:37:46.440]  warming to a suitable level, it is going to cost $45 trillion. Now, the human mind cannot
[1:37:46.440 --> 1:37:52.280]  conceive even what a billion looks like. A trillion is considerably more than that.
[1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:56.560]  And where is this money going to come from, and where is it going to go? Well, the place
[1:37:56.560 --> 1:38:02.160]  it's going to go is into the pockets of third world kleptograph dictators. It's going to
[1:38:02.160 --> 1:38:07.160]  go into the pockets of people like Morris Strong, Al Gore, into the pockets of all
[1:38:07.160 --> 1:38:11.880]  the people who we know has been caught with Saddam and others wandering aid money back
[1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:19.920]  to themselves. This scam is just unbelievable. It's done
[1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:26.640]  in the name of environmental righteousness. I think what half of these yogurt weaving
[1:38:26.640 --> 1:38:31.520]  crusty loons supporting the green movement don't realize is that the people they're
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:40.320]  in bed with are the most vicious ideological opposites. Who would have thought that people
[1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:44.840]  like, oh God, I don't know if you're familiar with this guy, George Mondio, have you ever
[1:38:44.840 --> 1:38:45.840]  come across him?
[1:38:45.840 --> 1:38:50.680]  He openly calls for world government, carbon credit, ration cards.
[1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:58.320]  Yeah, that's the one. But this guy, whatever his sad reason, he wants to bomb us all back
[1:38:58.320 --> 1:38:59.320]  to the agrarian.
[1:38:59.320 --> 1:39:00.320]  He's a control freak.
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:05.800]  Yeah, well, he wants us to live in yurts and to travel around in coracles, and so we don't
[1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:09.720]  have the wheel anymore. And maybe we'll probably even be banned by, we'll just have to sit
[1:39:09.720 --> 1:39:11.200]  around shivering in caves.
[1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:15.800]  Well, actually, Europe has been banning in some countries and putting taxes on the
[1:39:15.800 --> 1:39:17.440]  fireplaces and space eaters.
[1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:23.720]  Oh, yeah, I mean, I must say, one of my great pleasures in life is going to a pub, an English
[1:39:23.720 --> 1:39:29.400]  pub, and sitting outside where there is one of those outdoor heaters, and having a cigarette
[1:39:29.400 --> 1:39:32.560]  which, you know, which we're just about allowed to have in this country.
[1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:34.040]  And that puts out carbon, too.
[1:39:34.040 --> 1:39:39.720]  Yeah, well, exactly. I like to do my, do my bit, strike my tiny blow in the Great War
[1:39:39.720 --> 1:39:46.800]  for freedom. Yeah, but I mean, it is an odd scenario where you've got all these crazies
[1:39:46.800 --> 1:39:52.320]  going to the Copenhagen to protest in their polar bear costumes and stuff. And the people
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:57.640]  they're actually marching in support of are the most vicious form of capitalist. You could
[1:39:57.640 --> 1:39:58.640]  possibly imagine.
[1:39:58.640 --> 1:40:02.800]  Now, I believe in the capitalist system, but I believe in the capitalist system that favors
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:08.320]  the little man, that favors the kind of hardworking entrepreneur, small businessman. What I don't
[1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:13.120]  like is corporatism. You know, I mean, this is what, this is exactly what happened under
[1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:14.120]  Nazi Germany.
[1:40:14.120 --> 1:40:16.560]  It's a piratical system of looters.
[1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:22.200]  Yeah, exactly. Well, this is what happened under Naziism. Hitler allowed certain favored
[1:40:22.200 --> 1:40:27.840]  business concerns to prosper under his fascist regime. And this is exactly what's happening
[1:40:27.840 --> 1:40:34.160]  in the world now. Certain favored big businesses which can afford the, to absorb the massive
[1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:39.320]  cost, which are going to be imposed on us all by carbon trading and so on. These businesses
[1:40:39.320 --> 1:40:44.520]  are going to, going to thrive, but, but people like, like you and me, and your listeners
[1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:47.160]  are going to be screwed something rotten.
[1:40:47.160 --> 1:40:52.160]  And those big businesses will pay their cut to the Hermann Görings and Joseph Goebbels
[1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:54.160]  and Adolf Hitler's of today.
[1:40:54.160 --> 1:41:00.160]  Yeah. I don't think these analogies are inappropriate either. I mean, you know, William
[1:41:00.160 --> 1:41:05.720]  Crystal, who died recently, they were one of the founders of neoconservatism. He wasn't
[1:41:05.720 --> 1:41:12.360]  so interested in the great clash between, between, you know, the free West and the Soviet
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:18.520]  Union. What interested him far more was the war between liberalism and I suppose what
[1:41:18.520 --> 1:41:23.600]  you'd call libertarianism. Because I think he sensed that this is a much more subtle
[1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:28.200]  and dangerous war that was going on because a lot of people don't realize it's happening.
[1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:32.720]  Because, because you know that there's no evil Soviet empire trying to, you know, point
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:38.240]  at SS20, that is anymore. People imagine that the great clash of civilizations is over.
[1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:43.880]  Actually, what happened now is that we are fighting a guerrilla war of ideas against
[1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:51.800]  it, it, it, it's for the right of the individual to enjoy his liberty versus big government
[1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:54.120]  which wants to take our liberty away from us.
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:41:58.280]  Which is allied with select global corporations that don't want a free market. They want a
[1:41:58.280 --> 1:42:03.760]  government that can deliver them monopolies. Yeah, absolutely. And I suppose when one starts
[1:42:03.760 --> 1:42:09.640]  talking about using words like conspiracy, people on the liberal left say, aha, you're
[1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:14.000]  just another conspiracy freak. You're making all this stuff up. I would say it's only
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:20.080]  50% of conspiracy in that. For example, people in the green, green movement don't share
[1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:25.120]  the same goals as, as people, you know, in big business who are making money out of it.
[1:42:25.120 --> 1:42:32.480]  What happened is that a rag bag of, of different, different people just happened to have found
[1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:37.120]  a common theme whose ideals they share, but for completely different reasons. So you've
[1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:41.640]  got the greens who want us all to live in, in, you know, mud huts and stuff and, and,
[1:42:41.640 --> 1:42:47.720]  and, and, um, bath, restore the barter system and, uh, abandon fun and work is just each
[1:42:47.720 --> 1:42:53.400]  other, you know, raw, raw leaves and give up meat and stuff. And then on the other hand,
[1:42:53.400 --> 1:42:58.120]  you've got the sinister big business interest who just wants to line their pockets. You
[1:42:58.120 --> 1:43:03.720]  know, uh, couldn't be more different, but they have found a common cause and that cause
[1:43:03.720 --> 1:43:07.800]  is ATW. Well, here's the Greek prime minister, Bilderberg
[1:43:07.800 --> 1:43:12.840]  at Copenhagen. We are observing the birth of global governance and you link through,
[1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:18.440]  he made these quotes. It's in the official Copenhagen, uh, record. We have Herman von
[1:43:18.440 --> 1:43:23.560]  Rumpi. I could play the clip again, but I played it literally 30, 40 times saying, this
[1:43:23.560 --> 1:43:27.400]  is the first year of global governance. We have Bandkai moon in the New York times and
[1:43:27.400 --> 1:43:32.560]  an editorial he wrote saying the green movement is the funding mechanism for global government.
[1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:37.000]  We have Al Gore saying it. We have Gordon Brown saying it. They're all admittedly setting
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:41.840]  it up. But then when we say, okay, we don't want your global government. And again, here's
[1:43:41.840 --> 1:43:47.280]  the London telegraph or, or, or daily telegraph, uh, uh, uh, headlines saying they'll be nowhere
[1:43:47.280 --> 1:43:52.640]  to run from the new world government. Uh, but, but, but again, they're, they're trying
[1:43:52.640 --> 1:43:57.240]  to tell us that they're announcing this, but then we're not allowed to oppose it as if
[1:43:57.240 --> 1:44:01.960]  we're so stupid, they can announce global government, but then tell us it doesn't exist.
[1:44:01.960 --> 1:44:06.640]  What is the psychological tactic there of say Monbiot? I mean, it's real fast cause you,
[1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:12.480]  I mean, you just, uh, you brought him up. Monbiot writes books, writes articles every few weeks,
[1:44:12.480 --> 1:44:17.280]  a new story. He signs petitions calling for a dictatorial world government to carry out
[1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:22.440]  environmental austerity, but then he writes articles attacking myself and others saying
[1:44:22.440 --> 1:44:26.880]  we're lunatics and none of this exists. I mean, does he think we're so stupid? He has
[1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:30.720]  such disrespect for us. I mean, what is the psychological tactic there?
[1:44:30.720 --> 1:44:37.640]  You know, in some ways, Alex, we are stupid. You know, just in the 1930s, Hitler wrote
[1:44:37.640 --> 1:44:45.200]  this book called mine camp in which he stated explicitly exactly what his plan was. He hated
[1:44:45.200 --> 1:44:51.120]  the Jews. He hated the Slavs. He wanted to, to destroy the Slavic intervention. He wanted
[1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:57.040]  a, a form of new world order with him, Adolf Hitler in charge. How did people respond to
[1:44:57.040 --> 1:45:02.760]  this? Oh, he's just a, he's just a sad little German Austrian in need of a bit more love.
[1:45:02.760 --> 1:45:07.680]  You know, uh, we, we don't need to rearm against this guy. It's all going to be okay. This
[1:45:07.680 --> 1:45:12.920]  is the power of wishful thinking. People do not want to deal with a reality that doesn't
[1:45:12.920 --> 1:45:19.920]  suit them. And I think it's the same with, uh, this HGW conspiracy. Now, as you say,
[1:45:19.920 --> 1:45:25.120]  people, you know, the club of Rome, various people have been very explicit about this.
[1:45:25.120 --> 1:45:31.240]  And this is, of course, the classic, um, way fascist movements operate. I don't really
[1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:38.640]  read, read, uh, Jenna Goldberg's rather excellent book, liberal fascism. He describes how, uh,
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:45.800]  in order for fascist regimes to take over, they need, uh, a crisis. And if that crisis
[1:45:45.800 --> 1:45:49.160]  doesn't actually exist, they need to invent the crisis. I mean, this is what you've got
[1:45:49.160 --> 1:45:55.400]  Rama manual saying as well, haven't you? Yes. An opportunity of this crisis. And of course,
[1:45:55.400 --> 1:46:01.040]  the idea that the world is going to end, uh, due to catastrophic manmade global warming
[1:46:01.040 --> 1:46:06.840]  is the best crisis you could ever imagine, which is why so many people have, have, have
[1:46:06.840 --> 1:46:12.040]  um, been, have been gathering round this wonderful theme and, and, and working it up for all
[1:46:12.040 --> 1:46:18.080]  their worth because this is their excuse they need. You know, this crisis is so important
[1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:22.640]  that it is, it is far too important to be left to the, uh, to the people of the, of
[1:46:22.640 --> 1:46:27.320]  the, the world's constituent countries to vote on the issue. It's so important. This
[1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:33.400]  must be taken away from the people and it must be, it must be decided by experts, experts
[1:46:33.400 --> 1:46:38.560]  from the United nations in future. They will, they will take power, even over-elected government.
[1:46:38.560 --> 1:46:43.360]  They will notice how they always say in all their talking points, whether it's David DeRoth
[1:46:43.360 --> 1:46:48.600]  child or whether it's Ban Ki-moon, whether it's Al Gore or Gordon Brown, they always
[1:46:48.600 --> 1:46:54.040]  say the time for talk and debate is over. This is the way it is.
[1:46:54.040 --> 1:46:58.720]  That's absolutely right. And again, that, that is a classic product of Nazism and fascism.
[1:46:58.720 --> 1:47:03.960]  It's all about action, action now, because action means that you don't have to think
[1:47:03.960 --> 1:47:09.480]  about anything, anything, anything anymore. And of course this is, this is why, why Al
[1:47:09.480 --> 1:47:16.800]  Gore says in his propaganda, his Lenny Riefenstahl type propaganda movie, an inconvenient truth,
[1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:23.880]  why he says that, uh, consensus has been reached, the science is settled. Because once you
[1:47:23.880 --> 1:47:29.320]  do that, you instantly pull the rug from those who say, hang on, the debate isn't over, hang
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:33.240]  on, let's talk about this, hang on, there's a few more facts that are slowly beginning
[1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:39.160]  to emerge, hang on, it isn't settled at all. Um, if you say act now, we must act now,
[1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:43.280]  we must stop thinking, you are overriding these people, you are overriding the arguments.
[1:47:43.280 --> 1:47:48.320]  And of course, as we've agreed, the arguments are not in these people's favor. The facts
[1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:52.560]  are not in their favor, which is why they try and, uh, ride rush all over those facts
[1:47:52.560 --> 1:47:55.120]  as quickly as they can.
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:48:00.360]  You're absolutely right. But again, I see the momentum beginning to shift against them.
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:05.280]  And before the last break, and we got cut off, you brought up internet censorship. This
[1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:10.480]  is openly being announced globally. They're now even, uh, Senator Jay Rockefeller has
[1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:14.840]  said, quote, we'd be better off never inventing the internet. They're now openly saying in
[1:48:14.840 --> 1:48:19.600]  Australia, oh, we're going to censor political views we don't like or people that leak things
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:25.280]  on WikiLeaks. We're going, we're now going to block this. Uh, they're really moving to
[1:48:25.280 --> 1:48:30.560]  do this. People better take them serious. Can you speak to that and how we, how we block
[1:48:30.560 --> 1:48:36.480]  this completely openly authoritarian, undemocratic, uh, fraud?
[1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:40.440]  Well, there's two things that stay here. Are you familiar with the, with the work of the
[1:48:40.440 --> 1:48:43.240]  Italian Marxist thinker, Antonio Gramsci?
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:44.240]  Yes.
[1:48:44.240 --> 1:48:49.240]  Gramsci, of course, was the guy who said that in order for the left to win the, uh, win
[1:48:49.240 --> 1:48:55.720]  the political war, it must first win the cultural war. And, and, and there must be a long march
[1:48:55.720 --> 1:49:00.040]  on the institutions. And so what happened is that little by little over the years, the
[1:49:00.040 --> 1:49:04.520]  liberal left captured the, uh, seats of learning, the universities, which are of course all
[1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:05.520]  left-wing.
[1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:06.520]  They had the long view of history.
[1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:11.920]  Yeah, exactly. They took over the, over the newspapers. They took over the schools. They
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:17.000]  took over every aspect. I mean, the music industry, uh, pretty much every aspect of
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:20.720]  our culture is controlled by the liberal left.
[1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:25.120]  But I wouldn't even call them liberal left. They're just criminals that call themselves
[1:49:25.120 --> 1:49:28.200]  liberal so they can be the bleeding heart and you're the bad conservative.
[1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:32.440]  Well, call them what you will. The point is that, that, that up until very recently, until
[1:49:32.440 --> 1:49:38.880]  Al Gore invented the internet, which I'm sure he's regretting now, until Al Gore invented
[1:49:38.880 --> 1:49:44.360]  the internet, we didn't really have a way of expressing our dissent to all this. And
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:47.800]  now this thing comes along the internet and it's fantastic because it means that people
[1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:53.560]  like you and me can, can express ourselves and, and, and, and tell our version of the
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:58.480]  truth, which is actually the real truth as it happens. Um, and of course, how does the
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:04.440]  liberal left, the how do the crazies respond to all this by trying to shut down this medium
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:09.160]  of, of free expression? They're going to try and do it. I don't think, and this is the
[1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:14.120]  one bit of hope I can offer to your listeners today, I don't think they can get away with
[1:50:14.120 --> 1:50:19.400]  it. If China can't do it, if China can't close down the internet, then I think nobody
[1:50:19.400 --> 1:50:24.240]  can. But I, I agree with, we've got to resist the terms to do so. We've got, well, they
[1:50:24.240 --> 1:50:29.560]  partially blockaded it and, and, and it's a process, but then they just make the alternative
[1:50:29.560 --> 1:50:34.400]  information that much more, uh, in demand. But regardless, they're openly announcing
[1:50:34.400 --> 1:50:39.520]  their intention to, which shows everyone who these people really are. Yeah. Well, of course,
[1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:43.120]  already you've got some of the places on the internet, which have been captured by the
[1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:47.640]  liberal left. I mean, are you familiar with the case about Wikipedia? Oh, it's a complete
[1:50:47.640 --> 1:50:52.080]  fraud. Half of what they've got about me will stay there. Tell us about it when we get back.
[1:50:52.080 --> 1:50:55.880]  Final segment with our guests. Certainly we'll have to have him back. Very impressive, uh,
[1:50:55.880 --> 1:51:01.640]  information. But yeah, Wikipedia, it's a fraud.
[1:51:01.640 --> 1:51:05.220]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary
[1:51:05.220 --> 1:51:09.680]  to maintain good health with so many places to choose from. Deciding where and what to

[1:52:01.040 --> 1:52:05.120]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid
[1:52:05.120 --> 1:52:09.880]  seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[1:52:09.880 --> 1:52:13.800]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true, seeds have
[1:52:13.800 --> 1:52:17.280]  all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could
[1:52:17.280 --> 1:52:21.800]  even happen again. So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:28.000]  mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply

[1:52:55.320 --> 1:53:00.920]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:11.440]  The controlled leftoids using Bush's unpopularity and all the bad things he did boomeranged into
[1:54:11.440 --> 1:54:17.200]  power and are intensifying everything Bush did and adding a lot of new tyrannies in. And
[1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:20.760]  whenever you listen to the controlled left, all they talk about is how smart they are
[1:54:20.760 --> 1:54:24.720]  and what geniuses they are and how stupid everybody else is. And it's all just a bunch
[1:54:24.720 --> 1:54:31.040]  of prattle. I mean, they're a religious cult. And a great example of this is Wikipedia.
[1:54:31.040 --> 1:54:35.120]  They've got my name spelled wrong, almost all the info is wrong, and they won't let
[1:54:35.120 --> 1:54:39.960]  us change it. They use the worst photo of me they can. They're caught constantly in
[1:54:39.960 --> 1:54:42.840]  this info. You were getting into that, James Dillingpole.
[1:54:42.840 --> 1:54:47.760]  Yes, I'm disappointed. One of my favorite Wikipedia entries ever was the one that said
[1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:54.880]  I was voted the sexiest man alive by this girl's school in Wiltshire in England. And
[1:54:54.880 --> 1:55:01.440]  somebody wanted to cancel it out. But on a more sinister point, this guy, William Connolly,
[1:55:01.440 --> 1:55:02.440]  have you heard of this guy?
[1:55:02.440 --> 1:55:03.440]  Yes.
[1:55:03.440 --> 1:55:11.360]  William Connolly was a sort of an officially appointed Wikipedia moderator. And this guy,
[1:55:11.360 --> 1:55:21.360]  Doctored, will re-wrote 5,428 articles about global warming. So any article that didn't
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:28.360]  suit his version of events, either warmest version events, he simply either destroyed
[1:55:28.360 --> 1:55:33.960]  or altered to his point of view. This guy actually eliminated the medieval warm period.
[1:55:33.960 --> 1:55:37.840]  For example, on Wikipedia, which is the site, of course, everyone goes to these days for
[1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:43.800]  their information. So even the internet isn't safe. And it's the same with Google. I mean,
[1:55:43.800 --> 1:55:50.240]  you're presumably familiar with how Google has been squashing references to Climate
[1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:51.240]  Gate.
[1:55:51.240 --> 1:55:52.240]  Yes.
[1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:58.240]  When I first wrote about that story, I think within the first fortnight, Climate Gate had
[1:55:58.240 --> 1:56:04.120]  got something like 30 million Google hits. If you look now, it's gone down to something
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:10.720]  like 16 million. How can it have fewer hits than it had two weeks ago? It's crazy.
[1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:15.120]  Well, we know Schmidt, the CEO of Google, openly says he wants a world government and
[1:56:15.120 --> 1:56:16.120]  world taxes.
[1:56:16.120 --> 1:56:21.720]  Is that right? It's not the same as Gavin Schmidt. He's the climate guy.
[1:56:21.720 --> 1:56:28.120]  No, no, the head of Google is a huge supporter of Al Gore.
[1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:34.720]  Oh, no. We should all kill ourselves now before it gets any worse.
[1:56:34.720 --> 1:56:40.160]  Well then there's the hypocrisy of these guys. All the big climate change heads like Bloomberg
[1:56:40.160 --> 1:56:45.760]  and Gore and Soros and of course, Ted Turner, they have some of the biggest carbon footprints
[1:56:45.760 --> 1:56:46.760]  in the world.
[1:56:46.760 --> 1:56:53.040]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, look at, look at, I mean, the guy in charge of the IPCC, Dr.
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:57.400]  Regenda Pichare, I don't know how long he's going to last with all stuff that's been coming
[1:56:57.400 --> 1:57:00.280]  up about him. If you've been reading about that, it's just extraordinary.
[1:57:00.280 --> 1:57:04.880]  Yeah, tell folks about how he gets steel mills shut down in England to move them to India.
[1:57:04.880 --> 1:57:13.120]  Oh, it's extraordinary. The Regenda Pichare, the guy who's in charge of the IPCC, supposedly
[1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:19.280]  neutral, neutral panel, which is in charge of giving us the accurate figures on how much
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:25.160]  climate is changing and how much we need to spend to stop this disaster happening. This
[1:57:25.160 --> 1:57:32.760]  guy is in need up to the armpits in businesses which stand to make money out of carbon trading.
[1:57:32.760 --> 1:57:39.120]  So this guy is saying, oh, we need stiffer regulation on carbon. And on the other hand,
[1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:45.800]  he's making millions out of carbon trading. One of the things he managed to do was to,
[1:57:45.800 --> 1:57:54.320]  well, he's allied with this Indian conglomerate called Tata. And Tata owns this steel company
[1:57:54.320 --> 1:58:02.760]  in Britain. And it recently closed down this steel company. Why? Because by shifting around
[1:58:02.760 --> 1:58:10.600]  its carbon credit, it could make over, I think, a billion pounds just for having closed down
[1:58:10.600 --> 1:58:16.800]  this business and then set up one in India instead, producing the same amount of carbon
[1:58:16.800 --> 1:58:22.480]  but just under the special terms of global carbon trading rules, India is somehow exempt.
[1:58:22.480 --> 1:58:27.240]  So it's all OK. I mean, it is just the massive scam.
[1:58:27.240 --> 1:58:31.160]  James Dillingpole, I know you've got a lot of stuff to do. We've got a one minute break.
[1:58:31.160 --> 1:58:33.880]  I'm going to ask you during the break if you can come back for five minutes and finish
[1:58:33.880 --> 1:58:39.600]  up on a few other issues dealing with this global takeover through the fake environmental
[1:58:39.600 --> 1:58:40.600]  movement.
[1:58:40.600 --> 1:58:50.640]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:50.640 --> 1:58:55.280]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[1:58:55.280 --> 1:58:59.600]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:58:59.600 --> 1:59:03.960]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:59:03.960 --> 1:59:09.000]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[1:59:09.000 --> 1:59:10.960]  grid technology is coming.
[1:59:10.960 --> 1:59:15.280]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[1:59:15.280 --> 1:59:20.320]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous
[1:59:20.320 --> 1:59:24.520]  weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their
[1:59:24.520 --> 1:59:26.480]  power from weather related onages.
[1:59:26.480 --> 1:59:31.200]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:59:31.200 --> 1:59:35.040]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:59:35.040 --> 1:59:36.400]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[1:59:36.400 --> 1:59:42.920]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the
[1:59:42.920 --> 1:59:49.920]  government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[2:00:12.920 --> 2:00:27.400]  We have now reached the second half of our radio broadcast. We're simulcasting the next
[2:00:27.400 --> 2:00:32.080]  two hours at prisonplanet.tv. You can watch us in living color and see all the documents
[2:00:32.080 --> 2:00:38.480]  and video clips coming up, singing in, as the former head science advisor to Microsoft
[2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:42.320]  saying they need to terraform the planet to save us from global warming. Turns out Bill
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:48.400]  Gates has got the big patents on that, and we'll open the phones up as well. James Dillingpole
[2:00:48.400 --> 2:00:52.600]  is a best-selling author. He writes for The Daily Telegraph and the TV critic for The
[2:00:52.600 --> 2:00:58.120]  Spectator, JamesDillingpole.com, is his website, and he's one of the leading people out there
[2:00:58.120 --> 2:01:04.400]  exposing the fraud of man-made global warming, absolutely spot on, as they say over in England.
[2:01:04.400 --> 2:01:07.080]  And I say cheers to him with Christmas coming up.
[2:01:07.080 --> 2:01:12.480]  In the last four minutes we've got left in this segment, chronicling climate gait, that
[2:01:12.480 --> 2:01:17.320]  was only one blip that got a bunch of attention. We've had Ben Sander with the fraud at the
[2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:24.520]  UN. We've had Al Gore lying about carbon dioxide going up simultaneously with temperature.
[2:01:24.520 --> 2:01:26.440]  Chronicles some of the fraud of these people.
[2:01:26.440 --> 2:01:35.920]  Yeah. One of the great defenses offered by the warmest is that climate gait was an unimportant
[2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:41.560]  affair involving a few insignificant scientists that just won, you know, obscure establishment
[2:01:41.560 --> 2:01:47.160]  in the boggy Fenlands of eastern England, and it doesn't matter. The fact is that climate
[2:01:47.160 --> 2:01:52.920]  gait, what it did, was confirm what a select band of brave scientists and bloggers and
[2:01:52.920 --> 2:02:00.280]  people have been saying all along, which is that the whole system is rotten to the core.
[2:02:00.280 --> 2:02:08.200]  Now these scientists exposed in the climate gait emails just also happened to be the small
[2:02:08.200 --> 2:02:14.960]  cabal of scientists who write the IPCC papers on global warming. These guys are the lead
[2:02:14.960 --> 2:02:20.120]  authors. You know, one of the big names that keeps cropping up in those emails is Michael
[2:02:20.120 --> 2:02:28.840]  Mann. And Michael Mann is the American scientist who invented the infamous hockey stick curve.
[2:02:28.840 --> 2:02:34.000]  That was the one, the great big curve that Al Gore, in an inconvenient truth, he shows
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:40.440]  this graph of how global temperatures are rising and he has to mount on this kind of
[2:02:40.440 --> 2:02:47.280]  crane lifting device because the curve is so steep upwards that only with this crane
[2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:51.680]  can he rise to point it out and everyone in the audience laughs. The fact is that this
[2:02:51.680 --> 2:02:56.360]  graph, which was invented by Michael Mann to show how dramatically the world is heating
[2:02:56.360 --> 2:03:04.800]  up, has been proved wrong, not once but twice, by these two heroic scientists called McIntyre
[2:03:04.800 --> 2:03:09.520]  and McKittrick. And McIntyre and McKittrick have been on the case of the warmest for
[2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:15.640]  a very long time and they've been using one of them as an economist, the other as a statistician.
[2:03:15.640 --> 2:03:20.840]  And what they've been doing is using their skills to analyze all the data that has been
[2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:27.120]  used by these warmest scientists and they've proved beyond doubt that these guys aren't
[2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:30.800]  cooking the books, they are fiddling with them. And they called it a fraud and then
[2:03:30.800 --> 2:03:36.880]  the emails came out confirming exactly what they were saying with the fraudsters talking
[2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:41.600]  about them and how they had to suppress this information. That's exactly right. And what
[2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:49.040]  the fraud, what these scientists have been doing is skimming off millions and millions
[2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:54.760]  of dollars worth of funding and denying that funding to any scientist who disagree with
[2:03:54.760 --> 2:04:01.960]  this meme that about ATW. This is part of the problem. Those emails not only show them
[2:04:01.960 --> 2:04:08.000]  cooking the books, but they also show them bullying the opposition into silence, trying
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:14.200]  to ensure that any journals that want to give work to dissenting scientists, that they don't
[2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:18.560]  do so. And if they try to do so, they want to get them shut down. Now, this is completely
[2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:21.240]  wrong. This is not how science advances.
[2:04:21.240 --> 2:04:25.640]  Well, unfortunately, James Dillingpole, we are out of time. Thank you for spending so
[2:04:25.640 --> 2:04:29.200]  much time with us. Then there's the other frauds like polar bears are all dying when
[2:04:29.200 --> 2:04:34.360]  their numbers are way up, saying they can't swim to school children. I mean, the frauds
[2:04:34.360 --> 2:04:39.360]  go on and on. And the key here is they know it's a fraud. It's part of their agenda. Have
[2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:42.880]  a great Christmas and thank you for spending so much time with us. Happy Christmas, Alex.
[2:04:42.880 --> 2:04:43.880]  Thanks a lot.
[2:04:43.880 --> 2:04:47.640]  You bet. Take care. There he goes, ladies and gentlemen. We're going to come back and
[2:04:47.640 --> 2:04:53.640]  get into the rest of the story. Their power grab where they openly say they want to terraform
[2:04:53.640 --> 2:04:58.360]  the planet. Then your phone calls on what's happening with the health care power grab.
[2:04:58.360 --> 2:05:01.360]  Stay with us.
[2:05:01.360 --> 2:05:06.080]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:10.720]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[2:05:10.720 --> 2:05:15.680]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your
[2:05:15.680 --> 2:05:21.120]  only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts?
[2:05:21.120 --> 2:05:25.720]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[2:05:25.720 --> 2:05:29.760]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[2:05:29.760 --> 2:05:34.040]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[2:05:34.040 --> 2:05:39.200]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your
[2:05:39.200 --> 2:05:44.040]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm
[2:05:44.040 --> 2:05:52.440]  Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633

[2:06:00.480 --> 2:06:05.120]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[2:06:05.120 --> 2:06:09.200]  you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food
[2:06:09.200 --> 2:06:14.240]  that makes you sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate.
[2:06:14.240 --> 2:06:18.600]  There is a solution. Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have

[2:08:02.600 --> 2:08:09.160]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[2:08:09.160 --> 2:08:15.040]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:15.040 --> 2:08:27.720]  Obamacare cleared its biggest hurdle in the Senate. It has one more hurdle, the full vote,
[2:08:27.720 --> 2:08:31.360]  coming up they're saying the next three to four days. Then it goes to conference between
[2:08:31.360 --> 2:08:37.680]  the House and Senate. If it can get to conference, it has a 90% chance, and that's a dead reckoning.
[2:08:37.680 --> 2:08:48.480]  No one's sure of passing and being on Obama's desk in the first couple of weeks of 2010.
[2:08:48.480 --> 2:08:54.720]  So that is coming up. We're going to be breaking that down. Again, headline, Senate Health
[2:08:54.720 --> 2:09:05.480]  Bill passes major test, health plans on collision course with the House. Also coming up, Senator
[2:09:05.480 --> 2:09:11.280]  says White House foes of health care bill are birthers, right-wingers, militias, Aryan
[2:09:11.280 --> 2:09:15.320]  groups. And that's what the Mayak and Homeland Security Report says. It says if you don't
[2:09:15.320 --> 2:09:20.300]  like the Federal Reserve ripping you off, if you don't like Obama spending more money
[2:09:20.300 --> 2:09:25.640]  in the last year or less than all Presidents before him combined, you are a danger to the
[2:09:25.640 --> 2:09:32.200]  country. And so that is coming up. Look, I want to just play, there's two parts. We're
[2:09:32.200 --> 2:09:39.560]  just going to play the first part from YouTube of CNN and former Microsoft head talk of geoengineering
[2:09:39.560 --> 2:09:50.840]  the planet, part one of two. And Fareed Zachariah talks with the former chief technology officer
[2:09:50.840 --> 2:09:56.400]  of Microsoft. And they talk about how easy it is to put up these giant blimps up into
[2:09:56.400 --> 2:10:04.640]  the upper atmosphere, putting out sulfur dioxide to negate the effects of carbon dioxide. Now,
[2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:13.600]  out in the open, they're talking about geoengineering terraforming. The issue is they're already
[2:10:13.600 --> 2:10:20.240]  using this. They've already got weather modification blimps up. In fact, I printed it last night
[2:10:20.240 --> 2:10:24.920]  and wanted to give it to you this morning when I was here at like 10. The headline was to
[2:10:24.920 --> 2:10:32.720]  find one of the articles was UFO over Salt Lake. And it's a giant blimp. These blimps
[2:10:32.720 --> 2:10:38.720]  are on record flying around spraying the atmosphere and surveilling people. I got, I have the
[2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:42.880]  Washington Post, New York Times six, seven years ago when they announced they were putting
[2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:46.960]  these blimps up for multiple reasons. But then the local news, they call the Air Force and
[2:10:46.960 --> 2:10:52.560]  say, what, what is this? They go, we don't know. So the locals go, it's a flying saucer.
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:58.840]  Same thing over Russia. You can see the propellers on the thing. They use propellers even on
[2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:05.960]  the most high tech blimps. You can see the blisters of solar panels on the sides to power
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:10.680]  it. These are unmanned giant blimps that stay up for years. So they announced they deploy
[2:11:10.680 --> 2:11:17.760]  them, then make it classified. And the public's like, Martians, Martians, no, it's surveillance
[2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:22.960]  and weather modification blimps. And I go on shows like man cow nationally syndicated.
[2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:27.240]  He makes fun of me saying it doesn't exist even though I give them the articles. I'm
[2:11:27.240 --> 2:11:35.640]  the crazy man. I'm the crazy man in psychology today, believing in this because I, in fact,
[2:11:35.640 --> 2:11:42.400]  just Google for everybody on TV right now. After you do UFO over Salt Lake, I printed
[2:11:42.400 --> 2:11:45.600]  it last night. It should be in the printer.
[2:11:45.600 --> 2:11:51.560]  Jared's got the video. Google this. Homeland security launches blimps. You'll get MSNBC.
[2:11:51.560 --> 2:11:58.160]  Watch. Homeland security launches blimps. And you'll see a giant blimp being launched
[2:11:58.160 --> 2:12:05.680]  over DC rising up in the photo from MSNBC. And it literally hundreds of other, so six,
[2:12:05.680 --> 2:12:09.720]  seven, eight years ago, they announced all this. Now the blimps are everywhere and people
[2:12:09.720 --> 2:12:17.520]  are in Dallas and people are in Salt Lake and people are in Moscow going aliens, aliens.
[2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:23.040]  There it is. UAV satellites, blimps, Homeland security. That's from Homeland Security Newswire.
[2:12:23.040 --> 2:12:32.200]  Raytheon blimp ideal for surveillance cruise missions detection. So you guys found a bunch
[2:12:32.200 --> 2:12:40.200]  of them. But the point is all of this is going on. Add source MSNBC after it or Newsweek.
[2:12:40.200 --> 2:12:49.280]  Oh, you found MSNBC. Oh, oh, again, super blimps. That's not the same article. Eyes
[2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:54.560]  in the sky for Homeland Security. Scroll down. They may have just taken the photo off. There's
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:13:00.760]  a bunch of them is my point. And they do this. They announce a world government and they
[2:13:00.760 --> 2:13:06.120]  say it doesn't exist. You're a cook if you talk about it. They announce in 1992 a scientist
[2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:10.840]  won a Nobel Prize or was it 93? We've covered this. I'm doing research the last few years
[2:13:10.840 --> 2:13:18.400]  on chemtrails for a film I'm making. And they admit that they have adding the jet fuel
[2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:22.320]  so that the air traffic controllers don't know the pilots don't know. There's only three
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:28.360]  or four big manufacturers of the jet fuel for your mainline airports. It's added. It's
[2:13:28.360 --> 2:13:39.800]  designed to disperse nuclei for cloud formation, ammonium, sulfur dioxide, barium salts, aluminum
[2:13:39.800 --> 2:13:45.880]  dioxide, and it disperses it into the atmosphere. And so by 95, they launched tests and suddenly
[2:13:45.880 --> 2:13:50.080]  people went, I never saw a condensation trail last morning to men or two. That thing's been
[2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:56.200]  up there for five hours. It's turned into a cloud bank. Well, what's going on? And then
[2:13:56.200 --> 2:14:03.000]  the White House Science R comes out and is first speech to an AP meeting. There it is,
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:07.440]  Eyes in the Sky for Homeland Security, the exact photo I told you about. That's from
[2:14:07.440 --> 2:14:12.480]  2005, Homeland Security blimps and look at it over the Washington Monument. Blow that
[2:14:12.480 --> 2:14:18.880]  up for folks, please. But then I go on national radio shows and get made fun of. The public
[2:14:18.880 --> 2:14:24.680]  wants to believe it's flying saucers. In fact, since I'm already covering this, let's go
[2:14:24.680 --> 2:14:31.320]  ahead and I sent you several clips from ABC News and others where they're going, is it
[2:14:31.320 --> 2:14:37.120]  flying saucers? You know, is it aliens? And they got these things over Moscow. Now, when
[2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:42.640]  you watch the CNN piece, they show giant V shaped blimps. And those are the really big
[2:14:42.640 --> 2:14:50.240]  ones that go up to 100,000 feet or higher and just hover around in circles. And it's
[2:14:50.240 --> 2:14:55.160]  so high up you got to have a telescope to look at them. I mean, literally, if I had
[2:14:55.160 --> 2:14:59.560]  the time, I could, they got one over Dallas. It looks at all of Texas. I could drive up
[2:14:59.560 --> 2:15:03.520]  there on a clear day, scan around with it with a filter because it's white. You got
[2:15:03.520 --> 2:15:07.800]  to see it behind the background with like a brown filter. I took astronomy in school
[2:15:07.800 --> 2:15:12.840]  and own a couple of telescopes. The point is, and I could look around and find them.
[2:15:12.840 --> 2:15:16.840]  And I could put it on the news and people would think it was a giant alien craft. No,
[2:15:16.840 --> 2:15:21.520]  but, but notice it's the same thing they just saw over Moscow was one of the blimps taking
[2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:27.640]  off. And of course the Russians have them, but the really high tech ones are V shaped
[2:15:27.640 --> 2:15:34.240]  giant and CNN shows these in the piece coming up. But, but first that's one of the more
[2:15:34.240 --> 2:15:38.400]  primitive design ones of Homeland security right there on screen. I sent you a bunch
[2:15:38.400 --> 2:15:42.080]  of clips just, just, just show one of the local news clips of Salt Lake City where
[2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:50.040]  they think, you know, the government won't say what it is, but, but is it aliens or is
[2:15:50.040 --> 2:15:57.760]  it a secret craft? It's a blimp. It's a blimp. It's a blimp. I'm not the conspiracy theorist.
[2:15:57.760 --> 2:16:06.160]  I have the facts. Why does the public believe it's aliens instead of a blimp? Here it is,
[2:16:06.160 --> 2:16:09.760]  giant UFO over Salt Lake. This is one of the shorter clips. You can go watch longer ones.
[2:16:09.760 --> 2:16:13.760]  Go ahead and turn it up.
[2:16:13.760 --> 2:16:19.400]  What's hovering over Salt Lake City is in a rocket, a blimp, a UFO. A strange object
[2:16:19.400 --> 2:16:24.520]  seen in the skies has residents scratching their heads. The craft floated overhead for
[2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:29.560]  several minutes before disappearing. Salt Lake air traffic controllers said their radar
[2:16:29.560 --> 2:16:33.240]  didn't pick up anything and they have no knowledge of the craft.
[2:16:33.240 --> 2:16:38.080]  Yeah. See, that's the issue. I mean, you look, it's a blimp with tail fins. Looks like the
[2:16:38.080 --> 2:16:45.000]  Hindenburg. It's got propellers on it. I mean, this would be like if the red Baron landed
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:51.000]  a biplane, a red biplane in front of your house and the news came and showed it and
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:56.600]  said, we don't know what this craft is. It'd be like if a 777 landed at George W. Bush
[2:16:56.600 --> 2:17:01.680]  or HW Bush Airport in Houston and everyone ran on the tarmac saying, we don't know what
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:08.160]  this is. See, they treat you like your morons and there's longer, there's like a nine minute
[2:17:08.160 --> 2:17:14.120]  ABC newscast where they marvel and the government won't say what it is and maybe it's a UFO
[2:17:14.120 --> 2:17:20.580]  and the government said they didn't see anything. They treat you like children and just tell
[2:17:20.580 --> 2:17:26.400]  you it doesn't exist and you're seeing things when giant blimps are flying around. Now,
[2:17:26.400 --> 2:17:30.960]  I've looked into this story from a few years ago and I looked into the Dallas stories and
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:37.720]  clearly they have military bases there. They are launching blimps and they're only seen
[2:17:37.720 --> 2:17:45.600]  when they launch because when they go up to 100 to 120,000 feet, they are tiny and people
[2:17:45.600 --> 2:17:51.440]  with telescopes, there's literally hundreds of videos online where people with telescopes
[2:17:51.440 --> 2:17:56.840]  run around freaking out thinking they found UFOs and people with powerful telescopes privately
[2:17:56.840 --> 2:18:02.880]  owned keep seeing giant craft orbiting the earth and you look at the photos of them.
[2:18:02.880 --> 2:18:08.200]  It's giant space stations. 90 plus percent of the space program in the U.S. and Russia
[2:18:08.200 --> 2:18:14.920]  has always been military. They've got space planes. I mean, you really think Virgin Galactic,
[2:18:14.920 --> 2:18:21.720]  Virgin Atlantic is the only group that has space planes. A private airline company has
[2:18:21.720 --> 2:18:27.680]  a couple of spaceships and they launch missions into space for tourists, but the government
[2:18:27.680 --> 2:18:31.840]  doesn't have a space plane and NASA can't get one off the ground. Give me a break.
[2:18:31.840 --> 2:18:36.160]  Werner von Braun in the 20s and 30s drew up the space shuttle in Germany when he was
[2:18:36.160 --> 2:18:43.420]  the head of the German and the Hitlerian program in the 30s. He was the head of NASA's program.
[2:18:43.420 --> 2:18:48.600]  That is an ancient tinker toy that you are shown. The reason they go with blimps is
[2:18:48.600 --> 2:18:54.280]  because they're so inexpensive. It's much cheaper to have surveillance blisters, infrared
[2:18:54.280 --> 2:19:02.120]  scanners and face scanners and license plate readers and weather modification packages
[2:19:02.120 --> 2:19:07.240]  on blimps than it is to launch them with payloads because the space planes are not good at
[2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:11.440]  bringing large payloads up from the intel I have, though they have some larger space
[2:19:11.440 --> 2:19:15.440]  planes now that are highly classified that have leaked. Still, they use booster rockets
[2:19:15.440 --> 2:19:21.440]  to get them into the atmosphere, but a blimp, you put it up there in the edge of the atmosphere.
[2:19:21.440 --> 2:19:29.920]  It's up above. It can video and scan multiple states. That's what's going on on record.
[2:19:29.920 --> 2:19:38.960]  On record. Now, when we come back, they talk about chemtrail blimps. Chemtrail blimps with
[2:19:38.960 --> 2:19:46.680]  the former chief technology officer of Microsoft about geoengineering from CNN. We're just
[2:19:46.680 --> 2:19:51.360]  going to come back, go right into this clip, then we'll go out to break. I'll come back
[2:19:51.360 --> 2:19:57.280]  on the other side of the bottom of the hour and comment on this. The full video is linked
[2:19:57.280 --> 2:20:00.960]  at infowars.com.
[2:20:00.960 --> 2:20:05.280]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt. Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?

[2:20:19.040 --> 2:20:24.440]  our monthly payments by a little over $500. No more mortgage. Where have they been all
[2:20:24.440 --> 2:20:27.720]  of our life? If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody. Whenever
[2:20:27.720 --> 2:20:31.720]  I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number. I'm Larry

[2:21:01.040 --> 2:21:05.240]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate,
[2:21:05.240 --> 2:21:09.360]  and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do. You can buy it
[2:21:09.360 --> 2:21:15.480]  at Here'sWhatYouDo.net, as an e-book for $6, or the book for $10, and we have an audio
[2:21:15.480 --> 2:21:19.720]  book on its way for you commuters as well. Here's What You Do tells you exactly what
[2:21:19.720 --> 2:21:25.560]  to do to survive and thrive in these harsh economic times. This book will work for anyone,
[2:21:25.560 --> 2:21:30.360]  rich, poor, middle class. It doesn't matter. This book truly has the information that can
[2:21:30.360 --> 2:21:34.080]  make you wealthy, and it will tell you how to protect your wealth as well. You know the
[2:21:34.080 --> 2:21:37.960]  government isn't looking out for you. You need to look out for yourself. The economy
[2:21:37.960 --> 2:21:42.080]  is bad, but it's probably going to get worse. You must prepare and make sure you are able
[2:21:42.080 --> 2:21:47.480]  to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones. Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and
[2:21:47.480 --> 2:21:54.600]  start today. Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net. That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net. One last time.
[2:21:54.600 --> 2:22:01.000]  This is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:05.040]  Originally we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency to ensure
[2:22:05.040 --> 2:22:10.840]  purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[2:22:10.840 --> 2:22:15.760]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the Fiat Continental System. Wisdom being
[2:22:15.760 --> 2:22:20.840]  lost with time. The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with
[2:22:20.840 --> 2:22:26.480]  private business, creating the largest Fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[2:22:26.480 --> 2:22:30.440]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our
[2:22:30.440 --> 2:22:34.800]  elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original
[2:22:34.800 --> 2:22:39.120]  value. Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world
[2:22:39.120 --> 2:22:43.680]  reserve currency. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I'm offering a book that explains how the
[2:22:43.680 --> 2:22:50.800]  system works. Call me today at 800-686-2237. I will give you a silver dollar free just

[2:24:00.600 --> 2:24:05.800]  But I just can't see the world coming together to reduce CO2 emissions to the levels that
[2:24:05.800 --> 2:24:11.480]  will actually stop it. I can't see China or India doing it, which in and of itself would
[2:24:11.480 --> 2:24:16.680]  doom the project. And I really can't see western countries making the kinds of drastic changes
[2:24:16.680 --> 2:24:22.360]  that would be required to cut CO2 emissions. And if we did, there are still lots of CO2
[2:24:22.360 --> 2:24:27.440]  up in the atmosphere right now and it will cause global warming anyway. All of which
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:33.480]  made me want to know, are there other approaches? Are there other strategies we might pursue?
[2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:38.720]  In that spirit and in the wake of the Copenhagen summit, here is a fascinating conversation,
[2:24:38.720 --> 2:24:43.840]  a fascinating set of ideas, concrete ideas to solve the problem of global warming and
[2:24:43.840 --> 2:24:51.440]  energy without going down the Copenhagen-Kirta route or in addition to going down the Copenhagen-Kirta
[2:24:51.440 --> 2:24:52.440]  route.
[2:24:52.440 --> 2:24:58.720]  Nathan Miribald, you've been looking into the issue of global warming and you've brought
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:03.520]  all your expertise. I mean, you're a trained physicist. You've spent years as the Chief
[2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:09.560]  Technology Officer at Microsoft, so you understand the science, the economics. What is it that
[2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:14.680]  you think when you look at what is going on, what was going on in Copenhagen?
[2:25:14.680 --> 2:25:20.560]  Here's the real problem, or one of the many aspects of the problem. When you emit CO2,
[2:25:20.560 --> 2:25:26.200]  a good fraction of it, at least 20%, maybe even a little more, will stay for thousands
[2:25:26.200 --> 2:25:33.120]  of years. So it's not like it goes up and then it can go away after a little bit. As
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:38.080]  we continue to emit CO2, it continues to make the problem worse, and then even if we stopped
[2:25:38.080 --> 2:25:43.120]  cold turkey, it'll be there for a long period of time. If you wanted a problem that was
[2:25:43.120 --> 2:25:49.000]  almost perfectly designed to be difficult for us to grapple with, this would be it.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:56.840]  Because the cost is very high, the solution is going to require a lot of sacrifice, but
[2:25:56.840 --> 2:26:03.240]  the benefit is diffuse and global and way out in the future. That's the kind of problem
[2:26:03.240 --> 2:26:05.200]  humans are bad at.
[2:26:05.200 --> 2:26:11.240]  And that's why you have a fundamental problem with the idea, the whole approach of limiting
[2:26:11.240 --> 2:26:14.440]  carbon emissions as the solution to global warming.
[2:26:14.440 --> 2:26:19.680]  I think that you have to be an incredible optimist, or you have to believe that it's
[2:26:19.680 --> 2:26:25.360]  not a severe problem, to think that that's the only solution we should investigate right
[2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:32.520]  now. Okay, this building has fire extinguishers and a fire system, but it's probably unlikely
[2:26:32.520 --> 2:26:38.000]  there'll be a fire today. It's a low probability event, but it's important enough that we really
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:44.480]  have to have all of this infrastructure and alarms and firemen that will race up here
[2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:45.480]  and so forth.
[2:26:45.480 --> 2:26:46.480]  Because although it's...
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:51.440]  Okay, we're going to come back and play the rest of it, but I want to just counter
[2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:58.960]  what you just heard. People watching at PrismPlanet.tv, on the screen when they introduce him,
[2:26:58.960 --> 2:27:03.440]  they say a new plan to save the world.
[2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:12.400]  So they're now going from saying the oceans may rise by a few inches and a few polar bears
[2:27:12.400 --> 2:27:20.520]  might die, which is an extreme fraud, to putting out the visual idea, the asinine statement
[2:27:20.520 --> 2:27:29.120]  that the planet may be destroyed, ambitious plan to save the planet. On screen, they're
[2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:33.160]  saying we are saving the planet.
[2:27:33.160 --> 2:27:41.720]  And then the Microsoft former head of technology says, but we have a plan. And when we come
[2:27:41.720 --> 2:27:48.760]  back, we're going to play that where they show these giant blimps to spray sulfur dioxide
[2:27:48.760 --> 2:27:57.760]  into the atmosphere. Now, how can the globalists, the UN, the United States, Britain, go and
[2:27:57.760 --> 2:28:04.040]  put up these blimps at the north and south pole, as he says they're going to do, without
[2:28:04.040 --> 2:28:12.220]  asking the rest of the world? Also, what are these chemtrail devices, these aerosol devices
[2:28:12.220 --> 2:28:16.720]  really going to do? He talks about tipping points. That's what the father of weather
[2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:22.760]  weapons meteorologist Ben Livingston, who flooded Vietnam during the war, who created
[2:28:22.760 --> 2:28:29.400]  hurricanes, weakened hurricanes, now declassified, came on the show and explained to you that
[2:28:29.400 --> 2:28:33.840]  it's tipping points they can manipulate. We already know there's a giant covert weather
[2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:38.400]  modification program that John P. Holder in the White House Science are now admits was
[2:28:38.400 --> 2:28:45.200]  just a test that they're now going operational. So see, they now have to introduce it to you.
[2:28:45.200 --> 2:28:51.000]  Now, what they don't tell you upfront is that Bill Gates, and let's search this during
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:58.600]  the break and show people when we come back, owns patents on hurricane killing systems
[2:28:58.600 --> 2:29:05.440]  or hurricane strengthening systems. The search would be Bill Gates, patents, hurricane weather
[2:29:05.440 --> 2:29:11.480]  control. I forget the exact headlines. He also has the patents on this. So this is his
[2:29:11.480 --> 2:29:17.240]  corporate minion. And of course, Microsoft itself is an NSA slash CIA front, so is IBM.
[2:29:17.240 --> 2:29:22.280]  That's come out on record. And so the globalists are going to play God. They're going to control
[2:29:22.280 --> 2:29:27.140]  your weather. Harp, I've had the director of Harp on admitting that they can ignite the
[2:29:27.140 --> 2:29:32.800]  atmosphere with Harp. Then there in the break, the Air Force came on the line, griped at
[2:29:32.800 --> 2:29:37.560]  him and said, don't talk about that. John Harmon heard that. The guy running the show
[2:29:37.560 --> 2:29:42.360]  in Minnesota. I'm down here in Austin. I got to get John on to talk about that. I always
[2:29:42.360 --> 2:29:47.560]  talk about having talk about, but we should have him on. But the issue is there is weather
[2:29:47.560 --> 2:29:51.800]  modification going on. We're going to come back and finish up with this. We're on the
[2:29:51.800 --> 2:30:01.600]  March. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones
[2:30:01.600 --> 2:30:06.200]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one,
[2:30:06.200 --> 2:30:10.520]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two,
[2:30:10.520 --> 2:30:14.600]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[2:30:14.600 --> 2:30:20.040]  to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[2:30:20.040 --> 2:30:25.480]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:30.840]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather
[2:30:30.840 --> 2:30:35.200]  is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[2:30:35.200 --> 2:30:40.400]  weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance
[2:30:40.400 --> 2:30:44.240]  and peace of mind folks. I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[2:30:44.240 --> 2:30:49.680]  from science. One of my oldest sponsors, you can get more information at www dot my solar

[2:32:04.720 --> 2:32:10.920]  alone. This is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[2:32:10.920 --> 2:32:15.960]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have tremendous influence
[2:32:15.960 --> 2:32:21.240]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent
[2:32:21.240 --> 2:32:26.840]  upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies
[2:32:26.840 --> 2:32:32.800]  the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:32:32.800 --> 2:32:37.720]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists they're
[2:32:37.720 --> 2:32:41.880]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the check out to. Today
[2:32:41.880 --> 2:32:47.960]  seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[2:32:47.960 --> 2:32:54.920]  Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com or watch it online
[2:32:54.920 --> 2:33:08.400]  right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:33:08.400 --> 2:33:15.120]  Up on screen for prisonplanet.tv viewers you can read the headline. USA Today Hurricane
[2:33:15.120 --> 2:33:21.280]  Calming Technology. Hill Gates has a plan and then you find out he has all these weather
[2:33:21.280 --> 2:33:28.960]  control patents because he's a government consortium front. A shadow government front
[2:33:28.960 --> 2:33:33.720]  they give him all the patents they had decades ago. Everything he talks about everything
[2:33:33.720 --> 2:33:38.520]  they have in these patents is at least 30 years old. The Stanford Research Institute
[2:33:38.520 --> 2:33:46.360]  for the Navy Weapons Laboratory had patents for doing exactly what they talk about here
[2:33:46.360 --> 2:33:53.440]  in 1967. That's now been declassified as of four years ago and I saw a story where the
[2:33:53.440 --> 2:33:57.800]  name Ben Livingston was in there as the father of weather weapons, how they flooded Vietnam
[2:33:57.800 --> 2:34:02.560]  when there were no clouds that were going to create them, how in the 40s he was the
[2:34:02.560 --> 2:34:09.640]  first guy to fly into typhoons that are over 50 miles an hour. In some cases even faster
[2:34:09.640 --> 2:34:16.720]  200 miles an hour total. Again in the Pacific the hurricanes get even more powerful. They
[2:34:16.720 --> 2:34:20.960]  call them the typhoons. He flew into those. I mean this guy's amazing and we have that
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:25.920]  video interview by the way where they became to Austin at prisonplanet.tv. They had all
[2:34:25.920 --> 2:34:31.280]  of this and so now they're introducing it to you. Oh we could put blimps up. Oh we've
[2:34:31.280 --> 2:34:37.520]  been testing with aircraft spraying. Oh this is a giant program in full swing and we know
[2:34:37.520 --> 2:34:45.120]  they're already manipulating the weather and the issue is they could create horrible catastrophic
[2:34:45.120 --> 2:34:51.680]  weather events with this. That's on record and then tell you it's natural and scare
[2:34:51.680 --> 2:34:58.760]  everyone into submitting to global government. This is literally the elite playing god. That's
[2:34:58.760 --> 2:35:02.240]  what they're doing. That's what they want. That's why the Pentagon calls it owning the
[2:35:02.240 --> 2:35:06.960]  weather and that's one of their declassified reports. Just Google Pentagon report owning
[2:35:06.960 --> 2:35:14.640]  the weather in 2025. They already own it folks. Here it is. Arms and firemen that will race
[2:35:14.640 --> 2:35:20.120]  up here and so forth because although it's low probability it's severe. In this case
[2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:25.440]  we don't even know what the probability is of how severe it can be without there being
[2:35:25.440 --> 2:35:31.280]  very severe consequences. We also don't know when we're gonna get around to getting serious.
[2:35:31.280 --> 2:35:36.560]  So it seems to me that we need to have a plan B. We need to have a way to buy ourselves
[2:35:36.560 --> 2:35:44.760]  some time. If it starts getting serious quickly. Now what else could you do and the answer
[2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:50.720]  is a topic called geoengineering which says can we directly try to intervene. So to use
[2:35:50.720 --> 2:35:56.520]  an analogy we all know we're supposed to eat right and exercise a lot. And if we did that
[2:35:56.520 --> 2:36:03.040]  we would a lot of heart disease, diabetes, tons of other diseases we'd be better off.
[2:36:03.040 --> 2:36:08.480]  Turns out that's hard for people to do. And as a result you also have interventions that
[2:36:08.480 --> 2:36:13.560]  you would do like heart surgery that you might do to get a stent put in or to have a bypass
[2:36:13.560 --> 2:36:19.320]  operation because if you neglect the problem long enough that's what you have to do. Well
[2:36:19.320 --> 2:36:25.120]  the equivalent of that surgery in this case are means to directly intervene. Now one approach
[2:36:25.120 --> 2:36:30.200]  is to take the CO2 and suck it out of the atmosphere. Now how do you do that? We return
[2:36:30.200 --> 2:36:39.000]  or we turn actually to Benjamin Franklin. In 1783 there's a volcano called Laki in Iceland
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:46.680]  I've been there to visit it that erupted causing a tremendous winter in 1784 in the
[2:36:46.680 --> 2:36:53.000]  northern hemisphere. So Benjamin Franklin gives a paper, he says it was the volcano.
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:37:01.080]  Well we know today through lots of... How did he figure that out? He has a great, it's
[2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:06.600]  wonderful, I wish I had the text to read here because it's in this sort of quaint English
[2:37:06.600 --> 2:37:13.520]  of that era where he says that it blocked the many rays of the sun. And so far as we
[2:37:13.520 --> 2:37:20.920]  know today Ben was right. And we know this because in 1991 a Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines
[2:37:20.920 --> 2:37:26.160]  exploded. There's been lots of volcanoes since then but a very large volcano that's got a
[2:37:26.160 --> 2:37:31.280]  tremendous amount of power will put a lot of gases and particles into the very upper
[2:37:31.280 --> 2:37:36.720]  atmosphere, the stratosphere. Mount Pinatubo did. It caused global temperatures to drop
[2:37:36.720 --> 2:37:43.440]  by about 1 degree Fahrenheit for about a year, year and a half afterwards. Now that's interesting
[2:37:43.440 --> 2:37:47.400]  because that's about the amount of global warming that we have today. So if you could
[2:37:47.400 --> 2:37:53.960]  just have a Mount Pinatubo every year. A Mount Pinatubo on demand would do it. And what
[2:37:53.960 --> 2:37:58.920]  is it doing? What is the chemical process? It's spewing sulfur dioxide into the upper
[2:37:58.920 --> 2:38:07.520]  atmosphere. Why is that good? So when you have small aerosol particles light will scatter
[2:38:07.520 --> 2:38:15.200]  off of them. That scattering is why, one range of that is why the sky is blue. Another range
[2:38:15.200 --> 2:38:19.520]  of that scattering is why milk is white actually. So it turns out sulfur dioxide is very good
[2:38:19.520 --> 2:38:24.880]  at scattering light. And if you have sulfur dioxide, it gives the rotten eggs smell in
[2:38:24.880 --> 2:38:33.880]  part or that hydrogen sulfides at Yellowstone or other places you have geysers. Enough of
[2:38:33.880 --> 2:38:39.640]  those particles will scatter light. If you had a system for delivering sulfur dioxide
[2:38:39.640 --> 2:38:46.480]  into the upper atmosphere, you could easily dim the earth by, dim the sun by one percent
[2:38:46.480 --> 2:38:51.720]  and even do it in a way that wouldn't be visible. So how do you pump sulfur dioxide into the
[2:38:51.720 --> 2:38:55.840]  upper atmosphere on demand? The first things that you'd think of like all that's loaded
[2:38:55.840 --> 2:39:02.560]  into 747s and carry it up are way too expensive. So you need it cheap way to get a lot of stuff
[2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:08.160]  up there. So we set out to invent something like that. We've come up with actually a couple
[2:39:08.160 --> 2:39:13.800]  ways to do it, but I'll tell you the simplest one, which is you run a hose to the sky. It
[2:39:13.800 --> 2:39:22.720]  sounds nuts, but you take a hose, you suspend it on a series of balloons, helium balloons.
[2:39:22.720 --> 2:39:28.560]  You want to run it 25 kilometers up because that takes you up into the stratosphere. Now
[2:39:28.560 --> 2:39:34.440]  the 25 kilometer garden hose. Now that's the interesting part. If you go through a calculation
[2:39:34.440 --> 2:39:43.280]  of how much you need, in our best scheme, it's like a fat garden hose. The total amount
[2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:48.920]  of rate that you're pumping is about 30 gallons a minute. That's less than a swimming pool
[2:39:48.920 --> 2:39:56.640]  pump. So it's actually a very manageable sized problem once you come up with this idea that
[2:39:56.640 --> 2:40:02.040]  you put the stuff up there. The best place to put it is in very high latitudes. That's
[2:40:02.040 --> 2:40:08.920]  very far north or in the southern hemisphere, very far south. So northern Canada, Russia,
[2:40:08.920 --> 2:40:14.760]  someplace like that, that's up 60, 70 degrees north. So run one of these garden hoses at
[2:40:14.760 --> 2:40:22.040]  the north pole, basically one at the south pole. Turn them on every year and you've solved
[2:40:22.040 --> 2:40:27.040]  the problem of global warming. Well, we've done a series of computer simulations that
[2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:35.700]  tell us exactly that. That one of these units at 60 to 70 north with a set of assumptions
[2:40:35.700 --> 2:40:43.240]  about how you put the aerosol up there would negate global warming as we have it today.
[2:40:43.240 --> 2:40:47.000]  And by putting it up there, it would particularly protect the Arctic. And once you protect the
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:53.220]  Arctic, you shut off a bunch of these potential tipping point mechanisms. Once you cool the
[2:40:53.220 --> 2:40:57.120]  Arctic, our simulations show that in fact you draw enough heat from the rest of the
[2:40:57.120 --> 2:41:01.600]  hemisphere that you bring the rest of the hemisphere into line. And you don't have any
[2:41:01.600 --> 2:41:08.720]  severe dislocations of the weather. And it's worth pointing out, your stuff is all computer
[2:41:08.720 --> 2:41:15.240]  simulations, but of course, so are the predictions that the IPCC model uses to predict very bad
[2:41:15.240 --> 2:41:19.960]  stuff happening. So if we believe those computer simulations, there's no reason to assume yours
[2:41:19.960 --> 2:41:20.960]  are wrong.
[2:41:20.960 --> 2:41:26.640]  Well, I think, yes, we use the same kind of computer simulations, the same sort of software
[2:41:26.640 --> 2:41:32.720]  with the same sort of assumptions. Now, neither one of them is perfect, but it gives us confidence
[2:41:32.720 --> 2:41:36.400]  and at least as much confidence as we would have in the other directions. Now, of course,
[2:41:36.400 --> 2:41:39.960]  before you really deploy it, you'd want to run some more simulations and you'd want to
[2:41:39.960 --> 2:41:43.960]  do some small scale experiments. There's a lot of things to do to sort of responsibly
[2:41:43.960 --> 2:41:48.720]  build the full case. But from what we can tell, this is an idea that has incredible
[2:41:48.720 --> 2:41:49.720]  promise.
[2:41:49.720 --> 2:41:56.280]  Now, our people, our government's knocking on your doors. So not so far.
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:42:01.360]  And we will be back with Nathan Mervold, more on global warming, the future of energy and
[2:42:01.360 --> 2:42:03.640]  a way to power the whole world.
[2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:11.440]  Okay. That's enough. You can watch part two at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, or you
[2:42:11.440 --> 2:42:20.080]  can go directly to YouTube and pull the cliff up. It's seeing in a former Microsoft head
[2:42:20.080 --> 2:42:22.760]  talk of geoengineering the planet.
[2:42:22.760 --> 2:42:27.720]  Okay. I wrote some notes during that and I want to go over those notes. Then we're going
[2:42:27.720 --> 2:42:32.840]  to give the number out, open the phones up and get into the government grab of healthcare.
[2:42:32.840 --> 2:42:36.600]  And I'm not taking these in any particular order.
[2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:41.440]  This is their way through the fear of global warming to not just tax you, but set up a
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:49.240]  global agreement for weather modification. And there's actually a 1970s UN treaty that
[2:42:49.240 --> 2:42:54.600]  the US and others signed on to on weather weapons. So see, while they've been telling
[2:42:54.600 --> 2:42:59.880]  you none of this existed, now being declassified incrementally because they're getting ready
[2:42:59.880 --> 2:43:02.320]  to go public with it.
[2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:06.360]  While they've been busy manipulating and testing all of this, they now tell you that they're
[2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:12.040]  just now getting around to testing. So they want to set up a global weather bureau and
[2:43:12.040 --> 2:43:18.720]  Bill Gates has been given all of the secret technologies because what's now declassified
[2:43:18.720 --> 2:43:23.080]  five years ago, four and a half years ago, four sulfur dioxide from aircraft, sulfur
[2:43:23.080 --> 2:43:27.720]  dioxide from blimps. We have the documents associated press. You name it. Report it on
[2:43:27.720 --> 2:43:32.560]  it. I just said, Oh, look, there's been Libby's and they say he's the main inventor. Call
[2:43:32.560 --> 2:43:37.280]  him up. Yeah, we control hurricanes. It was all certified. I don't know why they let these
[2:43:37.280 --> 2:43:42.360]  hurricanes do what they did. I talked to other meteorologists and experts. They go, Yeah,
[2:43:42.360 --> 2:43:46.760]  these hurricanes like Katrina don't act like hurricanes normally do. You got double eyes
[2:43:46.760 --> 2:43:53.600]  in some of them. Strange behavior, aircraft scene, spring, while this is going on, they
[2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:58.760]  can strengthen them or weaken them. So you have a global weather bureau. They openly
[2:43:58.760 --> 2:44:03.200]  want to set up. Bill Gates has now said this. We predicted they would do this years ago
[2:44:03.200 --> 2:44:07.640]  because we know how they operate. We have enough info. We understand their program.
[2:44:07.640 --> 2:44:15.800]  They create the crisis, whether real or manufactured. They offer the solution. It goes on. Again,
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:21.440]  they sell it all with climate fear. The public thinks well, if they're going to put blimps
[2:44:21.440 --> 2:44:26.280]  up in the upper atmosphere and aircraft and spray us why it must be real if the government's
[2:44:26.280 --> 2:44:33.600]  doing this. It's a giant corporate boondoggle, a new global weather bureau that will spend
[2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:39.160]  hundreds of billions a year on already going on secretly now being declassified. It takes
[2:44:39.160 --> 2:44:44.400]  global agreements to get this set up, which is what they want globalization. It can also
[2:44:44.400 --> 2:44:49.800]  cover what they're doing and cover all their weather weapon programs that are happening.
[2:44:49.800 --> 2:44:56.440]  NASA reported three years ago that the earth in the last decade has become 20% darker than
[2:44:56.440 --> 2:45:00.440]  in the hundred years it was accurately measured before that. Because there's all this new
[2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:06.240]  hazy cloud cover formed by the chemtrails. That's just the low altitude aerosol spraying.
[2:45:06.240 --> 2:45:12.960]  When I use chemtrail, that's the colloquial common term for it. They have literally thousands
[2:45:12.960 --> 2:45:16.680]  of documents that he classified this year where department of energy, department of
[2:45:16.680 --> 2:45:22.400]  the army, department of the air force, they're just all out spraying globally. And it's all
[2:45:22.400 --> 2:45:28.320]  black budget and secret how much they're spending. It's giant program manipulating the weather.
[2:45:28.320 --> 2:45:33.240]  The earth is now 20% darker at least. I mean, we're living in the middle of Buck Rogers
[2:45:33.240 --> 2:45:41.680]  folks, but the general public doesn't understand it. Continuing, he says, yes, we'll use the
[2:45:41.680 --> 2:45:50.840]  same software that we've used for the global warming models, all centralized, fraud driven
[2:45:50.840 --> 2:45:56.240]  by United Nations groups. So more scams. You'll never know what they're really doing. It's
[2:45:56.240 --> 2:46:01.440]  a cover for their weather weapons and weather manipulation. And then they say, oh, well,
[2:46:01.440 --> 2:46:05.120]  we'll test this on a small scale. They've already been testing on a giant scale with
[2:46:05.120 --> 2:46:09.400]  harp. And that's just one location. They've got them in Europe on record, smaller stations
[2:46:09.400 --> 2:46:14.840]  all over the country where the Pentagon admits they're testing it and ionizing the atmosphere
[2:46:14.840 --> 2:46:20.000]  along with the barium salts, aluminum dioxide, sulfur dioxide, they're projecting. When
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:24.320]  he said these things reflect back into space, that's only a small part of it. They also
[2:46:24.320 --> 2:46:30.720]  form nuclei for clouds. That's the main driver. According to the climatologist, we've interviewed
[2:46:30.720 --> 2:46:38.960]  here. It's the nuclei, the potash, other things that we put into the atmosphere form nuclei,
[2:46:38.960 --> 2:46:45.720]  milk stacks, forest fires, but even more importantly, space dust, micro meteors coming in by the
[2:46:45.720 --> 2:46:51.040]  millions every day. That's a conservative estimate. Those are breaking up in the atmosphere, forming
[2:46:51.040 --> 2:46:56.160]  nuclei that water particles freeze onto in the upper atmosphere, becoming larger, micro
[2:46:56.160 --> 2:47:02.560]  hail. Then as it comes into the lower atmosphere, it heats back up, creating water vapor that
[2:47:02.560 --> 2:47:08.920]  you know as clouds. You understanding this? So when they say test on a small scale, there's
[2:47:08.920 --> 2:47:13.200]  no way to test these technologies on a small scale and know what it's going to do in the
[2:47:13.200 --> 2:47:23.600]  giant Terra scale or planetary Geo scale. So test on the small scale. What a fraud. They're
[2:47:23.600 --> 2:47:27.600]  already testing on a giant scale. You just weren't supposed to know about it. Now they're
[2:47:27.600 --> 2:47:34.720]  going public with it, namely because they want to publicly use it and since 1995, researchers,
[2:47:34.720 --> 2:47:39.360]  meteorologists, scientists, people have gone up in aircraft behind the chemtrails. They
[2:47:39.360 --> 2:47:44.760]  said it's barium salts, aluminum dioxide, sulfur dioxide. It's being dispersed in jet
[2:47:44.760 --> 2:47:50.160]  fuel. We've done studies. You could clearly do this and have it disperse the nuclei. Then
[2:47:50.160 --> 2:47:54.600]  John P. Holdren, White House science are who also wrote the book, Eco Science, calling
[2:47:54.600 --> 2:47:58.840]  for putting stuff in the water to sterilize you and your family. And he wants a planetary
[2:47:58.840 --> 2:48:04.800]  government, read his own book. He comes out and says, yeah, we got jets. They're going
[2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:11.360]  to spray the clouds and create clouds to protect you from global warming. Three years ago,
[2:48:11.360 --> 2:48:15.720]  government approved textbooks nationwide in public schools. Two of them came out for
[2:48:15.720 --> 2:48:20.840]  seventh and eighth graders use all over the country where they teach the kids the government
[2:48:20.840 --> 2:48:28.120]  is spraying trails to create sunscreen to protect you. So see they're teaching the kids.
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:34.760]  Looks like time magazine for kids in two different issues. One five years ago, one three years
[2:48:34.760 --> 2:48:39.840]  ago that I know of. I was sent this. They have time magazine free for kids in school.
[2:48:39.840 --> 2:48:44.560]  Federal government pays for it and it says your parents don't understand the future.
[2:48:44.560 --> 2:48:47.760]  They're old fashioned, but you're cool. You're going to take a microchip that you're going
[2:48:47.760 --> 2:48:51.960]  to buy and sell with and then no one will be able to take your identity. See they're
[2:48:51.960 --> 2:48:56.000]  teaching your kids their chemtrailing. They're teaching your kids that microchips are good.
[2:48:56.000 --> 2:48:59.440]  They're teaching your kids global warming is real and to come home and rebuke you. That's
[2:48:59.440 --> 2:49:05.520]  on the news now. We told you about it before it was on the news. It's a total scientific
[2:49:05.520 --> 2:49:10.120]  dictatorship. They're manipulating the weather. They're manipulating our genetics. I haven't
[2:49:10.120 --> 2:49:15.600]  even gotten to this yet. Last night, we're up here working late on a film. I ordered
[2:49:15.600 --> 2:49:22.640]  for the office a couple of Papa John's pizzas and I don't consider it total junk food, but
[2:49:22.640 --> 2:49:28.600]  it certainly is fattening and the pizzas come in and I'm putting pepper. I love pepper.
[2:49:28.600 --> 2:49:35.760]  I'm dumping a whole packet of pepper on my pizza and I read the label and it says crushed
[2:49:35.760 --> 2:49:44.640]  red peppers treated with radiation. Zoom in on this for me. Crushed red peppers treated
[2:49:44.640 --> 2:49:48.800]  with radiation. You're going, what does it have to do with chemtrailing? What does it
[2:49:48.800 --> 2:49:53.000]  have to do with genetic engineering? Ladies and gentlemen, I can't describe to you the
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:50:06.480]  information I know that is publicly available and mainstream news. I can't begin to eat.
[2:50:06.480 --> 2:50:16.120]  I mean, look, I mentioned last night how five years ago in 2004, the EPA approved spring
[2:50:16.120 --> 2:50:25.560]  live viruses on most meat. And people don't believe me. Here's, here's New York Times.
[2:50:25.560 --> 2:50:32.800]  Agency approves first use of viruses as food additive live viruses. Here is ABC News viral
[2:50:32.800 --> 2:50:38.800]  meat spray advancing food safety. I have newscast where they say mercury is good for your children's
[2:50:38.800 --> 2:50:46.760]  brains and that melamine is good for babies when it kills people. The government says
[2:50:46.760 --> 2:50:51.520]  that they want to put lithium in your water. The government admittedly puts over 150 chemicals
[2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:56.760]  in your water already that cause cancer and sterilize you. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies
[2:50:56.760 --> 2:51:02.320]  and gentlemen, do you understand what's going on?
[2:51:02.320 --> 2:51:07.760]  This is big John Lipscomb. World government and all its tyranny is rapidly approaching.
[2:51:07.760 --> 2:51:12.440]  The choices you make today will determine your level of suffering and freedom tomorrow.
[2:51:12.440 --> 2:51:18.960]  I have two solutions for you so you and your family can stay strong and free. Patriot food

[2:52:09.920 --> 2:52:14.840]  off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've
[2:52:14.840 --> 2:52:19.920]  turned an innocent influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[2:52:19.920 --> 2:52:26.160]  shards. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[2:52:26.160 --> 2:52:31.800]  the republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell bent
[2:52:31.800 --> 2:52:36.680]  on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner,
[2:52:36.680 --> 2:52:41.120]  Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[2:52:41.120 --> 2:52:45.560]  do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington

[2:55:20.920 --> 2:55:26.960]  air. I've done an hour and 55 minutes, 30 seconds of radio today and haven't plugged
[2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:30.200]  any of our sponsors. I want to let you know about some of the folks that made today's
[2:55:30.200 --> 2:55:35.680]  show possible. Did you know you can be drinking fresh, clean water right from the air you
[2:55:35.680 --> 2:55:39.760]  breathe? No, this isn't something out of a science fiction book. Our sponsor, Ecoloblu,
[2:55:39.760 --> 2:55:43.160]  the Ecoloblu-28 machine will allow you to do just that. It's easy to use and it will
[2:55:43.160 --> 2:55:47.800]  make up to 7.5 gallons of water per day. This is their base unit. They have other ones like
[2:55:47.800 --> 2:55:52.560]  the Ecoloblu-30. It grabs water right out of the air, puts it through seven filters.
[2:55:52.560 --> 2:55:57.200]  The Ecoloblu-30 puts it through 12-stage filtering process, including reverse osmosis
[2:55:57.200 --> 2:56:06.800]  and carbon. That's Ecoloblu.com, E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E.com, or give them a call, 800-69-1-6043. It is
[2:56:06.800 --> 2:56:15.000]  the best you can get. Ecoloblu.com, or 800-69-1-6043. Also, I'll tell you about front-site firearms

[2:57:37.120 --> 2:57:43.360]  85% or more off-supermarket prices because there's no middleman, the factory direct,
[2:57:43.360 --> 2:57:47.680]  the food's all from right here in America except for the bananas. eFoodsDirect.com or

[2:58:05.040 --> 2:58:09.120]  Go by quick. We're going to start that hour. I'm going to take phone calls. I'm going
[2:58:09.120 --> 2:58:14.120]  to get some into the healthcare takeover and the latest on that front. Then I'm going
[2:58:14.120 --> 2:58:19.680]  to get into what's being done to your food and water, just how far along this is and
[2:58:19.680 --> 2:58:24.040]  how it's being done by design. The average business or company owner, they're not part
[2:58:24.040 --> 2:58:30.280]  of it. It's all done compartmentalized. It's all done by a centralized system. We're going
[2:58:30.280 --> 2:58:34.680]  to break that down coming up towards the end of the show in the last 15 minutes. First,
[2:58:34.680 --> 2:58:43.240]  phone calls and a news blitz straight ahead in the fourth and final hour. Stay with me.

[2:58:51.560 --> 2:58:56.160]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[2:58:56.160 --> 2:59:00.600]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[2:59:00.600 --> 2:59:05.800]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your
[2:59:05.800 --> 2:59:11.240]  only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts.
[2:59:11.240 --> 2:59:15.840]  When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food?
[2:59:15.840 --> 2:59:19.880]  Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[2:59:19.880 --> 2:59:24.160]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems
[2:59:24.160 --> 2:59:29.200]  if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your
[2:59:29.200 --> 2:59:34.120]  life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm
[2:59:34.120 --> 2:59:42.520]  Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633
[2:59:42.520 --> 2:59:54.000]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[2:59:54.000 --> 3:00:01.000]  Raging War on Corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[3:00:01.000 --> 3:00:16.240]  Okay, I'm on a phone blitz. I always try to do this, but the call's always bring up
[3:00:16.240 --> 3:00:20.040]  some interesting info. We get stuck on one caller for 20 minutes. Each caller, you got
[3:00:20.040 --> 3:00:24.240]  one minute. Mark in Oregon, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:00:24.240 --> 3:00:27.240]  Greetings, Alex. Hey, buddy.
[3:00:27.240 --> 3:00:31.680]  Alex, I'd like to truly wish you and yours and all of us the very best new year for our
[3:00:31.680 --> 3:00:37.280]  families and for our fight against this evil. Alex, I'd like to harken back just with two
[3:00:37.280 --> 3:00:43.520]  quick comments here that you could comment on for me, please, to your conversation with
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:47.880]  Mr. Braverman in the beginning of the program. Alex, when I think of Hollywood, I think of
[3:00:47.880 --> 3:00:54.080]  a tremendous publicity value on a great scale of magnitude. If the numerous world-famous
[3:00:54.080 --> 3:01:00.320]  Hollywood stars who are opposed to the New World Order agenda will come out publicly,
[3:01:00.320 --> 3:01:05.720]  it would not counting your worthy self, it would be the most devastating blow to New
[3:01:05.720 --> 3:01:10.760]  World Order implementation that has yet occurred. I'd like to ask all of you good people in
[3:01:10.760 --> 3:01:16.400]  Hollywood to please come forward and assist the cause of truth and all of humanity's
[3:01:16.400 --> 3:01:21.280]  very survival. Mark, I hear you and I appreciate your call. For those that don't know, Michael
[3:01:21.280 --> 3:01:27.280]  Braverman, one of the executive producers on conspiracy theory, was on with us today.
[3:01:27.280 --> 3:01:32.200]  I'm a consultant on the show. It's groundbreaking this guy on the air. And he talked about the
[3:01:32.200 --> 3:01:41.440]  old fake left establishment doesn't want any New World Order info on TV or on television
[3:01:41.440 --> 3:01:48.760]  or on movies, cable broadcast TV, whatever the case is. And how this show from our perspective,
[3:01:48.760 --> 3:01:54.480]  the true perspective is groundbreaking. And I've talked about it a lot, but he never
[3:01:54.480 --> 3:02:00.960]  brought up the fact that Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, Woody Harrelson, and I threw those names
[3:02:00.960 --> 3:02:06.800]  out and he went, yeah, that's the names. How did you know that? I told you folks, you can't
[3:02:06.800 --> 3:02:18.160]  believe Bruce Willis. I mean, you heard because I was never going to bring it up on air because
[3:02:18.160 --> 3:02:24.360]  it was private info, but Rick Linklater felt like doing it. So he did because nobody told
[3:02:24.360 --> 3:02:30.920]  him to keep it on the lowdown that Bruce Willis has been in Austin, making a movie with those
[3:02:30.920 --> 3:02:39.480]  three years ago with my good friend, Rick Linklater. And this is like Hollywood, Texas next
[3:02:39.480 --> 3:02:44.200]  to Canada. This is one of the biggest areas in the world for making films. New Zealand's
[3:02:44.200 --> 3:02:49.160]  another place, Australia, but it's inexpensive to make films. There's a lot of Hollywood
[3:02:49.160 --> 3:02:53.400]  stars come through and they hear my radio show. They see my access TV show years ago.
[3:02:53.400 --> 3:02:58.840]  But in this case, Rick Linklater gave a bunch of my films to Bruce Willis and Bruce had
[3:02:58.840 --> 3:03:04.320]  a complete awakening to the left right paradigm. And there's some other behind the scenes stuff
[3:03:04.320 --> 3:03:11.480]  I'm not going to get into as it was private. But then whenever, this is just one case example,
[3:03:11.480 --> 3:03:18.200]  then whenever Rick Linklater talked about Bruce Willis' awakening from my films, because
[3:03:18.200 --> 3:03:23.080]  Rick's a big fan of the show and gave him a bunch of my films, at the time Terror, Storm,
[3:03:23.080 --> 3:03:28.520]  and Martial Law, that Bruce said, now I understand how both parties are controlled. We talked
[3:03:28.520 --> 3:03:31.680]  about that. Michelle Malkin came out and said it's impossible. It can't be true, but she
[3:03:31.680 --> 3:03:37.240]  didn't call Bruce Willis. She just said it can't be true. Then Bruce a few months later
[3:03:37.240 --> 3:03:41.160]  gave an interview to Vanity Fair and he said the same people that killed Kennedy run America,
[3:03:41.160 --> 3:03:46.200]  they control both parties. I've had an awakening to the New World Order. Now I didn't even bug
[3:03:46.200 --> 3:03:52.680]  Rick or Bruce to try to stay in contact with Bruce Willis and try to push it. And Bruce
[3:03:52.680 --> 3:03:56.200]  Willis wants to find out how to get a hold of me and wants to come on. He can because
[3:03:56.200 --> 3:04:00.120]  I'm going to wake up the general public and I can't count on things that may or may not
[3:04:00.120 --> 3:04:03.760]  happen. Charlie Sheen called me up out of the blue. I'd never talked to him and said
[3:04:03.760 --> 3:04:09.640]  I want to go public. And you know, I sit there and talk to count of Reeves, Woody Harrelson,
[3:04:09.640 --> 3:04:14.080]  a lot of other people over the years and you know, they're all into this info. They order
[3:04:14.080 --> 3:04:18.080]  my videos when they come out. I'll, you know, I talk to him every once in a while and they
[3:04:18.080 --> 3:04:24.800]  go, yeah, I'll come on sometime, but I'm not sure because they know that the establishment
[3:04:24.800 --> 3:04:30.360]  will try to hurt their careers. As long as you want to be a fake leftist, it's fine or
[3:04:30.360 --> 3:04:35.960]  be a right winger like Tom Selleck, it's fine. But the point is all the old socialists are
[3:04:35.960 --> 3:04:42.480]  dying off in Hollywood and I'm telling you 80% or more of Hollywood is anti New World
[3:04:42.480 --> 3:04:48.080]  Order. This is all they talk about all they're into. The awakening is accelerating and the
[3:04:48.080 --> 3:04:56.880]  globalists are in trouble there because the big studios are losing control of their people
[3:04:56.880 --> 3:05:02.520]  and that's what's happening. It's very exciting. This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you
[3:05:02.520 --> 3:05:06.800]  about the a cola blue atmospheric water generator that produces pure drinking water right from
[3:05:06.800 --> 3:05:10.560]  the humidity in the air. No, this isn't science fiction. It's very real. I know because I

[3:06:00.760 --> 3:06:05.400]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[3:06:05.400 --> 3:06:09.800]  you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center buying their processed food that makes
[3:06:09.800 --> 3:06:15.880]  you sick? Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a solution.

[3:07:00.760 --> 3:07:05.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:07:05.400 --> 3:07:09.720]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:07:09.720 --> 3:07:14.040]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:07:14.040 --> 3:07:19.120]  allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[3:07:19.120 --> 3:07:23.760]  grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid
[3:07:23.760 --> 3:07:29.400]  is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:07:29.400 --> 3:07:33.720]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands
[3:07:33.720 --> 3:07:38.400]  of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[3:07:38.400 --> 3:07:42.600]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[3:07:42.600 --> 3:07:46.680]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can

[3:08:00.200 --> 3:08:08.080]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:08:08.080 --> 3:08:16.600]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to your calls. Julio in Illinois, you're on the air.
[3:08:16.600 --> 3:08:21.240]  Alex Jones, good afternoon, Freedom Fighter. I was watching Bloomberg News about 20 minutes
[3:08:21.240 --> 3:08:27.120]  ago. They said the Copenhagen deal kind of fell short, which is great news. And then
[3:08:27.120 --> 3:08:32.920]  last night, at 1217, Central Time, I saw the scum known as the United States Senators,
[3:08:32.920 --> 3:08:39.480]  well, the 60 of them on the Democratic side. With the audacity to pass this bill at midnight.
[3:08:39.480 --> 3:08:44.720]  That's my comment. My question to you, sir, is I mentioned this on Jason Bermas's show
[3:08:44.720 --> 3:08:49.640]  last night, but I think for you, I think you guys need to bring on the air constitutional
[3:08:49.640 --> 3:08:56.160]  lawyers to see if we can, as Freedom Fighters, get set to press charges on the puppet master
[3:08:56.160 --> 3:09:00.520]  known as Barack Hussein Obama. We clearly know that he violated the Logan Act by bringing
[3:09:00.520 --> 3:09:05.760]  president of the world at the U.N. And every bill he signs from then on, including receiving
[3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:10.000]  the Nobel Peace Prize without the consent of Congress, everything he's done after-
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:15.000]  Yeah, that's a cash payment by a foreign group. So after he's done all of that, everything
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:19.880]  he's done after the U.N. meeting in New York City has been impeachable offenses against
[3:09:19.880 --> 3:09:23.600]  the Constitution, against the Logan Act. And what they're doing is, what Nixon did
[3:09:23.600 --> 3:09:28.640]  right on up to Obama now, is they set the precedent to violate the Constitution and
[3:09:28.640 --> 3:09:29.640]  get away with it.
[3:09:29.640 --> 3:09:34.320]  So there's a guy, Mark Levin. He's from New York. He's a great constitutional lawyer.
[3:09:34.320 --> 3:09:38.280]  He's a Freedom Fighter. He goes after these people. You need to get on some constitutional
[3:09:38.280 --> 3:09:41.200]  lawyers so we can get rid of these puppet masters. And then at the same time-
[3:09:41.200 --> 3:09:44.080]  Yeah, but Mark Levin is also a neo-con. He's pro-war.
[3:09:44.080 --> 3:09:46.960]  Oh, that's not good then. Well, never mind about him. But-
[3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:50.920]  No, I mean, that's okay. It's just, I'm just saying, you know, you've got the right wing
[3:09:50.920 --> 3:09:55.640]  all right now, kind of as the patriots. But remember what happens once they get in power.
[3:09:55.640 --> 3:09:59.720]  We need to remove both leaderships, because they're all rotten to the core. But I tell
[3:09:59.720 --> 3:10:05.880]  you, this Obama has taken it to new levels. I appreciate your points, Hulia, though. Well-said.
[3:10:05.880 --> 3:10:09.200]  Let's talk to Randy in Florida. Randy, you're on the air.
[3:10:09.200 --> 3:10:14.160]  Hey, Alex. How you doing? First time caller, long-time listener. Thanks to all you guys
[3:10:14.160 --> 3:10:21.480]  over there, Prince of Planet and InfoWars for everything you guys have done. You there?
[3:10:21.480 --> 3:10:28.440]  Yes, sir. Yes. I haven't heard anything about it, but over here in Central Florida, I'm
[3:10:28.440 --> 3:10:33.040]  in Pointe Anna. And, man, I'll tell you what, it's less than every 10 minutes you're seeing
[3:10:33.040 --> 3:10:38.120]  a plane flying over and they're laying out vast amounts of contrails here. And it's
[3:10:38.120 --> 3:10:43.400]  easy to fit it out to the, you know, the storms that are headed up north. We're getting in
[3:10:43.400 --> 3:10:49.240]  the skies after several hours, though. You start seeing a little, it kind of looks like
[3:10:49.240 --> 3:10:52.920]  a rainbow in the sky, but they're laying flat. You know, now it's a little bit of rain.
[3:10:52.920 --> 3:10:57.720]  Yeah, it's chemicals. You have planes at 3, 4, 5,000 feet in hot weather. It's not ice
[3:10:57.720 --> 3:11:02.960]  crystals and they're spraying chemicals. And now the White House admits it's been a long-term
[3:11:02.960 --> 3:11:07.440]  secret program. They mixed it in with the jet fuel. The pilots don't even know they're
[3:11:07.440 --> 3:11:12.520]  coming in on their regular runs and it's darkening the atmosphere. And I just played CNN last
[3:11:12.520 --> 3:11:16.640]  hour with the former head of Microsoft admitting that they own the patents. They're going to
[3:11:16.640 --> 3:11:17.640]  do it globally.
[3:11:17.640 --> 3:11:22.480]  Well, I've been taking pictures of this over the last several days. I'm going to send them
[3:11:22.480 --> 3:11:26.560]  in. I'm also going to put them up on a website. I'd also like to, you know, say something
[3:11:26.560 --> 3:11:30.000]  out to the people. You know, this morning watching Senator Barrasso and others speaking
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:35.400]  on, you know, the issues, how they're so imbalanced and the differences between the
[3:11:35.400 --> 3:11:40.600]  right and left and billions of new, you know, new tax, taxations. And the government hopefully
[3:11:40.600 --> 3:11:45.400]  admitted it's got no control. You know, the president's basically willing to sign any
[3:11:45.400 --> 3:11:51.000]  bill in the order, you know, to play. And that, you know, we've completely lost any
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:52.800]  sign of control or any reasoning.
[3:11:52.800 --> 3:11:58.080]  No, I hear you. I hear you Randy. I hear you and I appreciate your call. Look, Bush triple
[3:11:58.080 --> 3:12:04.880]  the size of government. Obama promised to cut government and spent more than Bush, Clinton,
[3:12:04.880 --> 3:12:16.360]  Bush's daddy, uh, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, uh, Nixon, all the way back to
[3:12:16.360 --> 3:12:24.960]  George Washington. That's a fact of $4 trillion deficit and counting in 2009. That's just
[3:12:24.960 --> 3:12:31.400]  the deficit now, not all the obligations and government health care and more wars and more
[3:12:31.400 --> 3:12:39.320]  taxes and carbon taxes. It is a mass looting, Randy. It is criminal government, snatching
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:43.440]  and stealing everything that's even nailed down. They're taking the kitchen sink. They're
[3:12:43.440 --> 3:12:48.000]  pulling up the tile. They're ripping out the wood paneling. They are robbing us blind.
[3:12:48.000 --> 3:12:52.880]  They are taking everything and leaving a police state behind as a rearguard action to protect
[3:12:52.880 --> 3:12:57.720]  themselves. Let's go ahead and talk to Tony in Illinois. Tony, go ahead.
[3:12:57.720 --> 3:13:01.680]  Hey Alex, it's great to talk to you. Uh, you know, it's funny you were mentioning about
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:06.360]  the, you're on Mancow. You know, I'm from the Chicago area. So I had a listen. We obviously
[3:13:06.360 --> 3:13:10.480]  know who he is. And when I heard you on there, I knew right away, you were, you know, the
[3:13:10.480 --> 3:13:13.440]  first shot in there, but I told you, you held your own. You did great.
[3:13:13.440 --> 3:13:16.520]  Well, no, I mean, I've been on, I mean, let me just make this point for you. Go on. I've
[3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:23.120]  been on Mancow show probably 50, 60, 70, maybe a hundred times. I mean, I'm on there almost
[3:13:23.120 --> 3:13:27.200]  every week. They asked me to come on for 10, 15 minutes. I do it and he's invited me up
[3:13:27.200 --> 3:13:31.600]  there and he's invited me to events and he's nice. It's just that he's still, when I talk
[3:13:31.600 --> 3:13:35.800]  about the White House science are, he gives a press conference and says, we're terraforming
[3:13:35.800 --> 3:13:41.200]  the planet. We're manipulating the weather and they have their guys on CNN. He still laughs
[3:13:41.200 --> 3:13:46.760]  at me because I mean, it's like mainstream media tells me there's no new world order
[3:13:46.760 --> 3:13:53.400]  being set up when I have a giant stack of mainstream news articles here in front of
[3:13:53.400 --> 3:13:57.280]  me today where they're calling for global government. I mean, that was the point I
[3:13:57.280 --> 3:14:02.400]  was making. Yeah, you know what? If you look at it, you know, you listen to the radio
[3:14:02.400 --> 3:14:07.000]  and even, you know, talk shows, there's a lot into the right and they both argue against
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:10.600]  each other and they've gotten the American people so against each other because they
[3:14:10.600 --> 3:14:14.400]  argue they're left to the right side that they're not seeing what's in the middle.
[3:14:14.400 --> 3:14:17.600]  Like, you know, you're in the middle. I'm in the middle and we're seeing what's going
[3:14:17.600 --> 3:14:21.320]  on here. Our country and they even give you a fake medal. Fake medal means you're a socialist
[3:14:21.320 --> 3:14:26.440]  instead of a communist. You know, the Republicans are the socials, the Democrats are the communists.
[3:14:26.440 --> 3:14:30.200]  It's all command and control. I'm not in the left, right or middle. I'm outside their
[3:14:30.200 --> 3:14:36.240]  fake paradigm. I'm anti-corruption. Yeah, exactly. Anti-corruption, pro-constitution.
[3:14:36.240 --> 3:14:40.720]  Let's get this country back on track, which sometimes seems like it's an impossible feat,
[3:14:40.720 --> 3:14:45.240]  but if we keep up the good fight, I believe we should overcome this and hopefully, you
[3:14:45.240 --> 3:14:49.760]  know, we keep spreading the word, your word, my word. And I try to keep everyone as formed
[3:14:49.760 --> 3:14:53.440]  as possible. And when you come on and you give your, all your data and you say, here's
[3:14:53.440 --> 3:14:56.880]  the data right here, right in front of me, you can look up yourself. Sometimes people
[3:14:56.880 --> 3:15:00.440]  are too lazy to do that, but that's what you want people to do. So if you actually read
[3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:04.440]  it online or read that government piece of paper you have there, then you know what,
[3:15:04.440 --> 3:15:08.720]  it's legitimate. And that's how we convince people the truth and what's going on.
[3:15:08.720 --> 3:15:14.840]  I hear you and I appreciate your call. Let's go ahead and talk to Trent in Canada. Trent,
[3:15:14.840 --> 3:15:15.840]  you're on the air.
[3:15:15.840 --> 3:15:21.160]  All right. You know, with the establishment coming forward and stating that they're doing
[3:15:21.160 --> 3:15:26.080]  the spraying, how is it that we don't know for sure that they're the ones that are responsible
[3:15:26.080 --> 3:15:30.000]  for this alleged climate change or whatever is happening that they figure is wrong?
[3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:33.720]  And that's what I'm pointing out. A lot of the stuff that's happening in the States
[3:15:33.720 --> 3:15:38.080]  right now is a lot of stuff that happened in Canada back in the 80s, you know, with
[3:15:38.080 --> 3:15:43.120]  the GST being put in and gun registration happening. And, you know, I think it's a matter
[3:15:43.120 --> 3:15:48.400]  of having the U.S. equalize with Canada for this North American Union, I think.
[3:15:48.400 --> 3:15:53.360]  Yeah, that's what globalization is. That's what they say is taking Americans and Canadians
[3:15:53.360 --> 3:15:57.520]  and British rights so we can be like all the other countries that live under tyranny.
[3:15:57.520 --> 3:16:05.440]  Yeah. Are they planning to have this also be equalized like with the European Union?
[3:16:05.440 --> 3:16:10.880]  Yes. In fact, it's in my film, In Game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, now out for three
[3:16:10.880 --> 3:16:17.760]  years, we show a press conference with Merkel and Barroso of the EU, Angela Merkel, the
[3:16:17.760 --> 3:16:25.080]  head of Germany and the head of the EU at the time, Barroso. And Bush says we have integrated
[3:16:25.080 --> 3:16:30.480]  North America through the SPP. We are now signing a treaty for Atlantic integration
[3:16:30.480 --> 3:16:35.880]  with Europe and North American Union. I mean, they have press conferences saying we've
[3:16:35.880 --> 3:16:41.240]  already merged and the public doesn't even know because nobody but Lou Dobbs would cover
[3:16:41.240 --> 3:16:47.680]  it and now they've run Lou Dobbs out. Well, I was so I wanted to point out so thanks a
[3:16:47.680 --> 3:16:53.680]  lot and the best to you. Trent, thank you so much. Great points. Mike and Vermont disagrees.
[3:16:53.680 --> 3:17:01.400]  Mike, go ahead. Yeah, Alex. This is Mike from Vermont. I disagree with you on the Chem
[3:17:01.400 --> 3:17:09.080]  Trail comments you made regarding the being the fuel, being contaminated with whatever
[3:17:09.080 --> 3:17:13.200]  and that the pilots don't know what they're doing. You know, don't realize it. I disagree
[3:17:13.200 --> 3:17:18.760]  with that because up here, I mean, I've watched them turn it on and off at will. U-turns,
[3:17:18.760 --> 3:17:24.240]  X's, these... Now, there are some special craft, big white craft and they've been photographed
[3:17:24.240 --> 3:17:29.080]  in Arizona where there's hundreds of them out at military bases, highly secure fences,
[3:17:29.080 --> 3:17:32.840]  many miles back. People have got to get up on mountains with telephoto lenses and they're
[3:17:32.840 --> 3:17:38.520]  just taken off and landing 24-7 and they've got bases everywhere. So yes, you have special
[3:17:38.520 --> 3:17:43.280]  Chem Trail planes that are chemically spraying and the Department of Energy admits that.
[3:17:43.280 --> 3:17:48.000]  The details are classified, but I'm saying evidence is they're adding lower amounts of
[3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:54.160]  it to general jet fuel. Go ahead. Oh, okay. Yeah, in that case, yeah, I agree. But yeah,
[3:17:54.160 --> 3:17:57.800]  but these guys, you know, I say they know exactly what they're doing. They miss the
[3:17:57.800 --> 3:18:04.200]  sky up every day. I mean, it's a daily thing. Folks, think back pre-1995 to those big blue
[3:18:04.200 --> 3:18:08.120]  skies that you had almost all the time when there weren't clouds. Now it's always a ratty
[3:18:08.120 --> 3:18:13.600]  haze. Every day I walk out in Austin at like 4,000 feet. It's a haze drifting down made
[3:18:13.600 --> 3:18:21.000]  up of the Chem Trails. Exactly, exactly. Well, that's about it, Alex. That's the only
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:25.920]  thing I thought... I didn't realize what you were getting out there. I might have misunderstood
[3:18:25.920 --> 3:18:31.200]  it. No, no, I hear you and I appreciate your call. That's my problem is that if I'm going
[3:18:31.200 --> 3:18:39.520]  to take calls and go over subjects, I've always got 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 times the evidence
[3:18:39.520 --> 3:18:48.560]  and facets and info. It's like when you hear the term fluoride, that is a catchall term
[3:18:48.560 --> 3:18:54.560]  under federal law for over 150 chemicals put in water on average. They have authorization
[3:18:54.560 --> 3:19:01.040]  to put over 300 in and all of them are associated with infertility in men and women, with cancer,
[3:19:01.040 --> 3:19:07.920]  with bone fractures, with bone cancer. There are thousands of government studies admitting
[3:19:07.920 --> 3:19:14.440]  that just sodium fluoride in water doubles men's chances of bone cancer. People don't
[3:19:14.440 --> 3:19:19.160]  believe me. I'll do it live on TV right now, as I'm casting on radio. Google fluoride
[3:19:19.160 --> 3:19:23.760]  bone cancer. When we come back from break, I'll show you mainstream studies. That's
[3:19:23.760 --> 3:19:30.080]  just one thing. They know it's sterilizing you. They know it makes you passive. That's
[3:19:30.080 --> 3:19:35.800]  why your sperm counts down. They know irradiating food destroys its food value. They know spring
[3:19:35.800 --> 3:19:40.000]  live virus is almost the meat you eat is deadly. That's all coming up. I'm going to cover
[3:19:40.000 --> 3:19:46.440]  it from mainstream news. Folks, we're so far gone. We're so deep into it. We've been incrementally
[3:19:46.440 --> 3:19:50.560]  taught to accept this and now they've been covertly doing it for decades. Now they're
[3:19:50.560 --> 3:19:55.600]  saying, Oh, we're going to put lithium and prozac in your water to make you happy. Oh,
[3:19:55.600 --> 3:20:00.080]  we are sterilizing you in the water. Oh, we are irradiating your food. Oh, we are spraying
[3:20:00.080 --> 3:20:06.160]  viruses on your beef. Hi, this is Steve Shank. Alex and I have talked about food security
[3:20:06.160 --> 3:20:10.840]  for your family for years. Now we're into the holiday season, the happy time of year
[3:20:10.840 --> 3:20:15.080]  when friends and family come together and food is always the expression of our shared
[3:20:15.080 --> 3:20:20.440]  love and caring. This year, the E foods holiday special food supply has the two things that
[3:20:20.440 --> 3:20:25.480]  you've asked for most easy to make prepared meals that taste great and a smaller than
[3:20:25.480 --> 3:20:29.880]  one year supply for greater affordability. I don't have to tell you that the trouble
[3:20:29.880 --> 3:20:37.360]  times and loss of freedoms that we only anticipated in 2008 have arrived in our lives with a vengeance.
[3:20:37.360 --> 3:20:42.200]  This holiday special is designed to bring peace and security to you and yours and comes
[3:20:42.200 --> 3:20:49.840]  with a free seven day responder for you to give to someone less fortunate. Call 800-409-5633
[3:20:49.840 --> 3:20:58.520]  or on the web, eFoodsDirect.com. That's 800-409-5633. We here at eFoods Direct wish you peace,
[3:20:58.520 --> 3:21:04.880]  security and plenty this holiday season. Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[3:21:04.880 --> 3:21:10.480]  in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing
[3:21:10.480 --> 3:21:16.080]  off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. I have tremendous
[3:21:16.080 --> 3:21:21.440]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think
[3:21:21.440 --> 3:21:27.320]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic
[3:21:27.320 --> 3:21:33.000]  identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[3:21:33.000 --> 3:21:37.880]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're
[3:21:37.880 --> 3:21:41.960]  arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make
[3:21:41.960 --> 3:21:47.280]  the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington D.C.,
[3:21:47.280 --> 3:21:55.160]  we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[3:21:55.160 --> 3:22:02.360]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv. On the average,
[3:22:02.360 --> 3:22:06.600]  Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live
[3:22:06.600 --> 3:22:11.880]  out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy,
[3:22:11.880 --> 3:22:16.400]  housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line. Is this a
[3:22:16.400 --> 3:22:20.480]  flaw for the enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve note forcing
[3:22:20.480 --> 3:22:25.200]  us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions and more
[3:22:25.200 --> 3:22:29.840]  can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman
[3:22:29.840 --> 3:22:34.640]  Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power. A
[3:22:34.640 --> 3:22:39.320]  gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel. Hi, this is

[3:24:03.920 --> 3:24:15.160]  The preacher man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi river she's a gold grime.
[3:24:15.160 --> 3:24:20.120]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you
[3:24:20.120 --> 3:24:32.080]  go downtown. I live back in the woods you see, a woman and the kids and the dogs and
[3:24:32.080 --> 3:24:41.520]  me. I got a shotgun, a rifle and a four wheel drive and a country boy can survive.
[3:24:41.520 --> 3:24:47.720]  I want to wish everybody a great Christmas Eve and Christmas coming up. I want to thank
[3:24:47.720 --> 3:24:51.720]  you for joining us today. I'm going to go to more of your phone calls and I'm going
[3:24:51.720 --> 3:24:56.520]  to get into the latest on healthcare. The White House is saying you're a Nazi, that's
[3:24:56.520 --> 3:25:01.040]  the Washington Times, that you're really a racist if you're against healthcare. If you
[3:25:01.040 --> 3:25:06.640]  call Obama socialists you're a racist. They're invoking race to divide people. But right
[3:25:06.640 --> 3:25:10.400]  now let's go to Randall in Mississippi. Randall, thanks for holding.
[3:25:10.400 --> 3:25:15.000]  Hello Alex, this is my first time calling and I want to say I appreciate your work and
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:22.760]  your passion. I'm going to let the New World Order know that I hate their guts and I haven't
[3:25:22.760 --> 3:25:26.720]  been drinking their four-dated water for the last two decades. I've been living in the
[3:25:26.720 --> 3:25:35.480]  country so I'm not passive and I'm not dumbed down. I'm spreading the word man.
[3:25:35.480 --> 3:25:40.640]  Let me add a point here before you go on. Every week or so I see articles in Australia,
[3:25:40.640 --> 3:25:45.720]  England, Europe, the U.S. or even small towns, we're talking when I saw last week was a
[3:25:45.720 --> 3:25:50.280]  town of less than 10,000 people, where the federal government spent hundreds of thousands
[3:25:50.280 --> 3:25:56.040]  of dollars in lobbying and gave them over a half million dollars just to put in the system
[3:25:56.040 --> 3:26:00.840]  to fluoridate the water. It's not because they care about your teeth folks. Go ahead.
[3:26:00.840 --> 3:26:06.280]  No, and I'm going to let you know it comes out of price to spread the word because there's
[3:26:06.280 --> 3:26:14.080]  this thing called gang stalking. If your listeners don't know what it is, Google it and that's
[3:26:14.080 --> 3:26:19.000]  what's been happening to me for the last two and a half years. I've been harassed 24-7
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:22.200]  and I don't care. That's the price you've got to pay.
[3:26:22.200 --> 3:26:27.000]  Well Randall, good to hear from you. I appreciate your call. Joe in Pennsylvania, Joe, you're
[3:26:27.000 --> 3:26:28.000]  on the air.
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:30.760]  That's the price you've got to pay.
[3:26:30.760 --> 3:26:36.560]  Turn your radio off, buddy. Okay, we'll come back to Joe in a minute. Eric in Pennsylvania,
[3:26:36.560 --> 3:26:37.560]  you're on the air.
[3:26:37.560 --> 3:26:46.640]  Hey Allison, nice to talk to you. I think that with all the chem trails and everything,
[3:26:46.640 --> 3:26:52.280]  I think they're trying to like accelerate an ice age. What do you think of that?
[3:26:52.280 --> 3:26:56.920]  John P. Holdren, the White House science are, believe we were going to have an ice age in
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:04.320]  the 70s and we are, the evidence shows, tipping towards, we're at the end of a 12,000 year
[3:27:04.320 --> 3:27:10.320]  warming cycle and they know the main ice age, the glacial periods come every 12,000 years.
[3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:16.240]  We've been in an interglacial period and all of the chem trail spraying does cool the earth
[3:27:16.240 --> 3:27:22.440]  and the earth has been cooling for nine years and they know that. So yes, I mean there's
[3:27:22.440 --> 3:27:27.840]  no telling what they're doing. They just admit they've had a long term global secret weather
[3:27:27.840 --> 3:27:33.760]  modification program going on. That's what's wrong with shadow national security government.
[3:27:33.760 --> 3:27:38.280]  We don't know what the truth is. These people have unlimited funding. They do whatever they
[3:27:38.280 --> 3:27:40.560]  want. They're playing God.
[3:27:40.560 --> 3:27:47.080]  Absolutely. Another thing, you talked about the, what they do with the food. I work in
[3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:52.760]  the restaurant industry and the fryer oil, they put silicone in it. It's called dimethyl
[3:27:52.760 --> 3:27:57.200]  polycylizane. It's silicone, like what they use in breast implants. When you heat it up
[3:27:57.200 --> 3:28:02.760]  to about 300 degrees, it turns into formaldehyde, which is cancer causing.
[3:28:02.760 --> 3:28:06.440]  Let me stop you for a minute. I've read about the special ingredients in a lot of French
[3:28:06.440 --> 3:28:12.880]  fry oil being carcinogens. You're telling me, because the stuff they put in breast implants
[3:28:12.880 --> 3:28:17.920]  is poisonous. You're telling me that's in the fry fryer grease? Absolutely. And they actually
[3:28:17.920 --> 3:28:23.960]  put it in, they actually put it in the cheese. If you just type in pizza hut and silicone,
[3:28:23.960 --> 3:28:28.960]  there's an article on wrench.com about how pizza hut puts it in their cheese and then
[3:28:28.960 --> 3:28:31.320]  they're giving it to the school kids. So that might be.
[3:28:31.320 --> 3:28:35.320]  Well, I've got to read that because that's questionable source, but I will, I will check
[3:28:35.320 --> 3:28:41.680]  into that for myself. I appreciate it. That is just, that is just amazing, amazing information.
[3:28:41.680 --> 3:28:50.440]  I mean, I don't doubt it, but I have to look at that for my, for myself. That's, I mean,
[3:28:50.440 --> 3:28:58.600]  who knows? In fact, where did it go? I had my Papa John's pepper that I was putting on
[3:28:58.600 --> 3:29:03.520]  my cheese pizza and it says crushed red pepper treated with radiation. I'm going to cover
[3:29:03.520 --> 3:29:07.600]  that after I come back and talk to John and PA, John and Florida, Michael in California
[3:29:07.600 --> 3:29:11.800]  and a few others. Then I'm going to briefly get into the latest on healthcare and then
[3:29:11.800 --> 3:29:17.520]  I'm going to spend a few minutes on how they're poisoning us. Just hit a few of the key points
[3:29:17.520 --> 3:29:23.880]  on that front today. We're going to break right now. I want to remind listeners, I'm
[3:29:23.880 --> 3:29:28.320]  a documentary filmmaker. You can see all my films in super high quality and watch the
[3:29:28.320 --> 3:29:35.200]  live TV, somalcast of the radio show at prisonplanet.tv. And it's not too late as a Christmas

[3:29:51.880 --> 3:30:02.160]  on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hello, this
[3:30:02.160 --> 3:30:06.640]  is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give
[3:30:06.640 --> 3:30:11.480]  you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can
[3:30:11.480 --> 3:30:17.160]  get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[3:30:17.160 --> 3:30:21.560]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will
[3:30:21.560 --> 3:30:26.000]  you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will
[3:30:26.000 --> 3:30:30.320]  it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go
[3:30:30.320 --> 3:30:34.880]  to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have
[3:30:34.880 --> 3:30:40.160]  a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How
[3:30:40.160 --> 3:30:45.280]  much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[3:30:45.280 --> 3:30:52.960]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check

[3:31:00.800 --> 3:31:05.440]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[3:31:05.440 --> 3:31:09.520]  you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food
[3:31:09.520 --> 3:31:14.560]  that makes you sick? Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate.

[3:33:22.680 --> 3:33:28.520]  every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Standard Time. Thank you so much for joining us. What
[3:33:28.520 --> 3:33:34.000]  I'm going to do first is go ahead and just get into a small snapshot. It's many times
[3:33:34.000 --> 3:33:37.640]  worse than I can even describe. Of what's in your water, what's in your food, what's
[3:33:37.640 --> 3:33:41.760]  happening. Then I'm going to briefly hit the latest on health care and then talk to John
[3:33:41.760 --> 3:33:48.520]  Michael Dan, Michael George and others that are patiently holding. For over 100 years,
[3:33:48.520 --> 3:33:53.840]  the eugenicist out of England, the U.S. and Germany, Hitler was only one brand of it,
[3:33:53.840 --> 3:33:59.200]  have been setting up health departments, secretly taking DNA samples from babies for the last
[3:33:59.200 --> 3:34:04.960]  37 years. That's now been declassified and been in the news. They wrote literally hundreds
[3:34:04.960 --> 3:34:08.320]  of government white papers we've covered here in the 50s where they said we want to
[3:34:08.320 --> 3:34:15.580]  put chemicals in the water to reduce fertility, to sterilize people, and to dumb people down
[3:34:15.580 --> 3:34:21.920]  and to reduce their life expectancy. And all over the country, drugs have been found in
[3:34:21.920 --> 3:34:29.640]  reservoirs at levels, in some cases, hundreds of times what they could be from sewage runoff.
[3:34:29.640 --> 3:34:34.080]  They've been found in mountain reservoirs. This has been in the Associated Press where
[3:34:34.080 --> 3:34:41.360]  it's original water, original rainwater, original glacier water, original mountain snow runoff.
[3:34:41.360 --> 3:34:47.440]  There is no sewage involved. It's original source water and there's Prozac and birth control
[3:34:47.440 --> 3:34:52.920]  and other things in it. Now, the U.S. government's proposed putting Prozac in the water, serotonin
[3:34:52.920 --> 3:34:56.920]  reuptake inhibitor type drugs. We've played those news clips. The Japanese government's
[3:34:56.920 --> 3:35:01.080]  been considering it. They've now been pushing putting lithium in the water, which is an
[3:35:01.080 --> 3:35:06.280]  anti-psychotic and talking about how natural it is and how it's no big deal and how it
[3:35:06.280 --> 3:35:11.160]  helps in suicide. They're talking about putting anti-cholesterol statins in the water. It's
[3:35:11.160 --> 3:35:15.680]  now coming out statins don't really mess with your cholesterol too much, that most cholesterol
[3:35:15.680 --> 3:35:20.840]  is good, and that it's causing liver problems. And that's mainstream news.
[3:35:20.840 --> 3:35:26.800]  So because myself and others have been exposing what they're putting in the water, what GMO
[3:35:26.800 --> 3:35:32.820]  food's doing from the real science, because all of this has been coming out, they're going
[3:35:32.820 --> 3:35:38.200]  from denying they're putting things in our water to coming out and saying, lead in toys
[3:35:38.200 --> 3:35:46.600]  is good. Melamine isn't bad for kids, even though it kills them and causes kidney failure.
[3:35:46.600 --> 3:35:52.640]  Mercury in shots actually helps your brain, doesn't harm it. Yeah, we are looking at putting
[3:35:52.640 --> 3:35:57.720]  stuff in your water and they're radiating more and more food. They're spraying live
[3:35:57.720 --> 3:36:02.720]  viruses on food. I want to go over all these mainstream media sources where they throw
[3:36:02.720 --> 3:36:10.400]  it in your face. But first off, to give you an idea about how prolific this is, last
[3:36:10.400 --> 3:36:15.920]  night we're up here late. I order a couple of Papa John's pizzas for the office. After
[3:36:15.920 --> 3:36:20.720]  my Sunday show, we're up here working on a film, actually two films. I'm working on
[3:36:20.720 --> 3:36:27.680]  my film, Jason Mermas is working on his. And I say, I'll order some pizzas. I'm putting
[3:36:27.680 --> 3:36:34.400]  red pepper on my pizza. And after I've already eaten a couple pieces of cheese pizza, I look
[3:36:34.400 --> 3:36:45.160]  down and it says crush red peppers by Papa John's crush red peppers treated with radiation.
[3:36:45.160 --> 3:36:49.440]  And then it's got a symbol of a flower. Oh, radiation is a flower. I'm going to lay this
[3:36:49.440 --> 3:36:57.760]  here on the table on the broadcast desk. So the document cam can zoom right in on that
[3:36:57.760 --> 3:37:08.240]  for everyone watching crush red peppers treated with radiation. And I wish I had an unused
[3:37:08.240 --> 3:37:12.880]  package so I could show it where I don't have the corner ripped off like I do there. But
[3:37:12.880 --> 3:37:18.000]  there's no way to focus a little bit better. I guess crush red peppers treated treated
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:27.560]  with with radiation. Now they tried to get a radiation of food past in the fifties. They
[3:37:27.560 --> 3:37:34.520]  had all this nuclear weapons waste, high power radioactive material. They don't mix actual
[3:37:34.520 --> 3:37:40.840]  radiation granules, radioactive substances in. They run food for just a few seconds through
[3:37:40.840 --> 3:37:45.720]  high power radiation beams that would kill you dead in a hammer. If you were in the radiation
[3:37:45.720 --> 3:37:51.480]  and it kills bacteria, kills other things. And this is so the food companies, scientists
[3:37:51.480 --> 3:37:55.160]  in the government wouldn't let them do it to what they approved. A radiation eight years
[3:37:55.160 --> 3:38:02.320]  ago because the studies all over the world showed it destroyed the value of the food.
[3:38:02.320 --> 3:38:07.320]  It killed the living enzymes in there, the ring structures, the cofactors. They did rat
[3:38:07.320 --> 3:38:15.400]  studies with it. Big problems. But this is crushed red pepper. Why irradiated? And most
[3:38:15.400 --> 3:38:18.600]  of the meat you're eating has been irradiated. A lot of the vegetables you're eating have
[3:38:18.600 --> 3:38:25.880]  been irradiated. This is only the tip of the iceberg. The GMO tomatoes and corn that they've
[3:38:25.880 --> 3:38:30.840]  mixed animal and insect in with cross species genetic engineering. They've crossed pigs
[3:38:30.840 --> 3:38:37.680]  and humans. They've crossed spiders and goats to create body armor. They won't believe me.
[3:38:37.680 --> 3:38:42.880]  Search engine, spider goats, CBS News Associated Press. Let's show them a photo of a part spider
[3:38:42.880 --> 3:38:48.320]  part goat for body armor production. Just anything you could imagine is going on. They've released
[3:38:48.320 --> 3:38:54.080]  fish in the open sea that are part insect, part plant. It gives rise to superviruses.
[3:38:54.080 --> 3:39:00.240]  It gives rise to super mutations in bacteria. This is the true environmental threat. Now
[3:39:00.240 --> 3:39:08.640]  here's an article from the Associated Press. August 19, 2006. This was approved in L5.
[3:39:08.640 --> 3:39:13.400]  Bacteria proves first use of viruses as food additive. A mix of bacteria killing viruses
[3:39:13.400 --> 3:39:20.360]  may be sprayed on cold cuts, weaners, and sausages is actually approved for all meat. To combat
[3:39:20.360 --> 3:39:24.800]  common microbes that kill hundreds of people a year, federal officials ruled Friday. The
[3:39:24.800 --> 3:39:29.600]  Food and Drug Administration approved it as a food additive. Now, they grow these in giant
[3:39:29.600 --> 3:39:39.520]  viral tanks off of meat. And in that, those products is the regular viruses in bacteria
[3:39:39.520 --> 3:39:44.080]  that were associated with it and the mutations occur. So they're not just spraying these
[3:39:44.080 --> 3:39:47.800]  viruses. Now, they said, well, you naturally have these viruses in your guts, but this
[3:39:47.800 --> 3:39:54.720]  is depending on which mixture over a thousand in some cases over 10,000 times more of these
[3:39:54.720 --> 3:40:04.960]  viruses than naturally occur in your gut. It's kind of like Monsanto has a form of corn
[3:40:04.960 --> 3:40:11.360]  that bugs won't eat because it has a naturally occurring fungus that grows that will kill
[3:40:11.360 --> 3:40:17.760]  bugs, but it's over a thousand times again stronger than the regular fungus and it grows
[3:40:17.760 --> 3:40:23.000]  inside the corn and then you eat it. That's one big reason a lot of honeybees are dying.
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:28.320]  The German universities have done the studies and found they have the genetically modified
[3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:33.520]  corn that has this natural pesticide in it in their tiny digestive tracts because unlike
[3:40:33.520 --> 3:40:37.960]  other animals, bees will still get the pollen, then they go die. And that's why they have
[3:40:37.960 --> 3:40:41.520]  the growth maps of where this is being grown in the U.S. and Europe where the bees are
[3:40:41.520 --> 3:40:45.120]  dying. In some cases, more than 80 percent. On average, we've lost half our bees in the
[3:40:45.120 --> 3:40:52.120]  U.S., half in Europe. So that's going on. So agency approves first use of viruses as
[3:40:52.120 --> 3:40:56.160]  food additive. In case you don't believe that, because I tell people this is going on, they
[3:40:56.160 --> 3:41:03.840]  don't believe it. Viral meat spray, advancing food safety, ABC News, says the food aisles
[3:41:03.840 --> 3:41:08.480]  don't seem very safe these days. There are still no firm answers as to what caused the
[3:41:08.480 --> 3:41:14.200]  coli breakout. Well, see, this allows them now when chicken and beef and poultry and
[3:41:14.200 --> 3:41:19.320]  pork has feces on it from the cows and pigs they slaughter and bacteria growing, they
[3:41:19.320 --> 3:41:23.320]  spray it down with bleach and try to clean it. Instead, they just leave it dirty and
[3:41:23.320 --> 3:41:27.440]  spray the viruses on it. So it allows them to feed you dirty, contaminated meat. The
[3:41:27.440 --> 3:41:33.320]  problem is most food poisoning is caused by the excrement, the secretion, the secretions
[3:41:33.320 --> 3:41:41.920]  of the bacteria. Their defecation is toxic. And that's the main toxin that gets you sick.
[3:41:41.920 --> 3:41:46.600]  So see, they just try to clean off the feces, the bacteria feces, and the animals own feces
[3:41:46.600 --> 3:41:51.400]  and blood from when they get hit in the head with a gas-powered hammer and blood spraying
[3:41:51.400 --> 3:41:55.080]  out everywhere. And they come in with giant razor blade cutters and slit its throat, start
[3:41:55.080 --> 3:41:59.200]  hacking big old pieces off, and it's rolling around in feces everywhere, and they're just
[3:41:59.200 --> 3:42:03.880]  slobbing that through. Then they take it in with big basters and just spray viruses all
[3:42:03.880 --> 3:42:12.480]  over it, bread and big old giant tanks. And they're feeding cows worldwide, rotten, ground
[3:42:12.480 --> 3:42:15.980]  up dead animals from the vet. That's come out in mainstream news. They take your dead
[3:42:15.980 --> 3:42:19.880]  animals, grind them up and awful with dead cows and sheep and everything else and feed
[3:42:19.880 --> 3:42:26.080]  rotten meat to cows when they're not even meant to eat meat. Pryon crystals then grow
[3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:30.240]  and get into the meat. You then eat it. They go to your brain, start growing because they're
[3:42:30.240 --> 3:42:36.160]  meant to grow in dead flesh. Now they got 25-year-olds getting Alzheimer's from it. That's really
[3:42:36.160 --> 3:42:41.480]  mad cow in America. This is what you're feeding your family, and this is eugenics. The globalist
[3:42:41.480 --> 3:42:45.880]  stated they were going to develop soft-kill weapons so they can give you something that
[3:42:45.880 --> 3:42:50.480]  makes you sick, that militates you and kills you in 10, 15, 20 years, and then the doctors
[3:42:50.480 --> 3:42:56.920]  aren't told how to diagnose it, and they don't know what's happening. Folks, there's thousands
[3:42:56.920 --> 3:43:01.200]  of these issues I could go over. And I've interviewed top scientists. Many of them
[3:43:01.200 --> 3:43:06.640]  making two, three, $4 million a year holding patents. They would feed, in one case in England,
[3:43:06.640 --> 3:43:13.920]  in the early 90s, GMO potatoes to rats. They would become sterilized. They would have their
[3:43:13.920 --> 3:43:20.440]  life expectancy cut in half. They would have mutations after birth, which is very rare.
[3:43:20.440 --> 3:43:27.200]  I mean, literally, like a horror movie. And then the scientists would go and say, we can't
[3:43:27.200 --> 3:43:31.880]  put this on the market. It's sterilizing. And they were told, shut up. Shut up. We're
[3:43:31.880 --> 3:43:37.560]  putting it on the market. They know it's sterilizing you. And all these CEOs and all these bankers,
[3:43:37.560 --> 3:43:42.560]  most of them aren't in on the larger program. They're eating it too. This is hurting all
[3:43:42.560 --> 3:43:47.440]  of us. If you're a bureaucrat, if you're an FBI agent, if you're a cop, if you're a
[3:43:47.440 --> 3:43:53.520]  CPS worker, you're an enforcer for this system. Did you get the memo not to drink the 150
[3:43:53.520 --> 3:44:01.360]  plus chemicals on average? In some cases over 300. They put from fertilizer manufacturing
[3:44:01.360 --> 3:44:07.440]  and aluminum manufacturing, aluminum production, purification, they take that toxic waste,
[3:44:07.440 --> 3:44:14.720]  mercury, lead, arsenic, hundreds of other chemicals, sodium fluoride, all these different acid
[3:44:14.720 --> 3:44:20.440]  complexes of fluoride, and they dump it in your water. It attacks your brain, your glands,
[3:44:20.440 --> 3:44:25.160]  calcifies in your bones, attacks fertility. Oh, look, spider goats start work on Wonder
[3:44:25.160 --> 3:44:30.680]  Web. What is that out of? Is that out of the, looks like the London Telegraph. Yeah, it
[3:44:30.680 --> 3:44:35.080]  is Telegraph. I recognize all the papers. That's the London Telegraph. See, spider goats, folks,
[3:44:35.080 --> 3:44:40.400]  you're in Buck Rogers, but it's a nightmare system. We're being slowly killed, slowly
[3:44:40.400 --> 3:44:45.520]  exterminated, and the people in pizza chains are told by their distributor, hey, we've
[3:44:45.520 --> 3:44:50.000]  got some low price irradiated stuff here for you, and they just put it on the shelves.
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:54.360]  They ship it to your house. They deliver it to you to where you can't even get a packet
[3:44:54.360 --> 3:44:59.800]  of pepper now that hasn't been irradiated, losing its food value. And that's bare minimum.
[3:44:59.800 --> 3:45:05.920]  What does irradiation do according to marcolla.com, a very trusted medical doctor source? Because
[3:45:05.920 --> 3:45:12.000]  it increases the shelf life of the food, it is used in large centralized facilities. Irradiation
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:16.040]  encourages globalization and consolidation of food production, distribution and retailing
[3:45:16.040 --> 3:45:20.520]  industries and allows you to be fed food that isn't as fresh. Research dating the 1950s
[3:45:20.520 --> 3:45:25.240]  has revealed a wide range of problems with animals that ate irradiated food, including
[3:45:25.240 --> 3:45:30.240]  premature death and a rare form of cancer, reproductive dysfunction, chromosomal abnormal
[3:45:30.240 --> 3:45:34.680]  abnormalities, liver damage, low weight gain, and vitamin deficiencies. And then they have
[3:45:34.680 --> 3:45:40.520]  all this sourced, a full medical source from the government's own document showing the
[3:45:40.520 --> 3:45:45.840]  sourcing on that. Irradiation destroys vitamins, essential fatty acids, and other nutrients
[3:45:45.840 --> 3:45:50.320]  and foods, sometimes significantly, and it just goes on and on. The process destroys
[3:45:50.320 --> 3:45:54.480]  80% of vitamin A and eggs, but the FDA nonetheless legalized irradiation of these products, goes
[3:45:54.480 --> 3:46:01.000]  on. There's all the sources, absolute fact. So, again, I'm only giving you a very tiny
[3:46:01.000 --> 3:46:08.880]  fraction of this. Let's now play a clip from MSNBC Hardball with their CNBC co-host coming
[3:46:08.880 --> 3:46:14.080]  on the Info Girl, the Info Babe, telling you, hey, what's wrong with lead in toys? Here
[3:46:14.080 --> 3:46:15.080]  it is.
[3:46:15.080 --> 3:46:19.240]  Hi, I think people should be careful what they wish for on China. If China were to revalue
[3:46:19.240 --> 3:46:23.640]  its currency, or China is to start making, say, toys that don't have lead in them or
[3:46:23.640 --> 3:46:24.640]  food that isn't poisonous.
[3:46:24.640 --> 3:46:26.640]  Can you get a little closer to the camera?
[3:46:26.640 --> 3:46:32.960]  Come in closer. They're price to production are going to go up, and that means prices
[3:46:32.960 --> 3:46:35.400]  at Walmart here in the United States are going to go up, too.
[3:46:35.400 --> 3:46:37.000]  Can you get a little closer to the camera?
[3:46:37.000 --> 3:46:41.480]  Yeah, the particular clip they found, I appreciate it. That's not the right clip. That's some
[3:46:41.480 --> 3:46:48.080]  joke clip. I know we wrote an article at prisonplanet.com. That is Matthews, and he did say, come
[3:46:48.080 --> 3:46:51.640]  in closer, and then she goes on to say, we've got to go ahead and have the poison toys,
[3:46:51.640 --> 3:46:54.080]  but then they, as a joke, put that clip back in.
[3:46:54.080 --> 3:46:58.400]  Let's do another search on that, or ask Watson. I want the original unedited clip for people.
[3:46:58.400 --> 3:47:04.680]  Okay, here's another clip. This is CBS News in Austin, but this went out nationwide,
[3:47:04.680 --> 3:47:09.960]  what they call a news package. The news is satelliteed to them with a script. The local
[3:47:09.960 --> 3:47:14.920]  news readers read it, but this went out nationwide on all CBS TV channels, telling you that a
[3:47:14.920 --> 3:47:21.300]  government study tells you that mercury is good for your brain when it's the most deadly
[3:47:21.300 --> 3:47:24.880]  heavy metal attacking brain cells. Here it is.
[3:47:24.880 --> 3:47:30.800]  It is tonight's medical headlines with medical watcher Porter Seema Maverick.
[3:47:30.800 --> 3:47:35.720]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies in the journal
[3:47:35.720 --> 3:47:40.680]  Pediatrics. There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives and vaccines
[3:47:40.680 --> 3:47:45.320]  might impair the neurological development of children. These new studies suggest that
[3:47:45.320 --> 3:47:49.680]  the opposite, that the preservatives, may actually be associated with improved behavior
[3:47:49.680 --> 3:47:55.240]  and mental performance. Okay, now here is Fox News telling you how
[3:47:55.240 --> 3:48:00.880]  great it is that Japan is looking at lithium in the water. And again, this is already all
[3:48:00.880 --> 3:48:06.040]  going on. You're now being told how great it is because the alternative media is exposing
[3:48:06.040 --> 3:48:09.120]  it. So they're saying, yeah, we're doing weather modification. Yeah, we're setting up
[3:48:09.120 --> 3:48:12.680]  a world government. Yeah, we're putting stuff in your water. You're now being, yeah, we're
[3:48:12.680 --> 3:48:16.840]  listening to your cell phones by law with a system that can track you and listen to you
[3:48:16.840 --> 3:48:21.440]  even when the phone's turned off. Yeah, there's, oh yeah, it's all happening. Here it is.
[3:48:21.440 --> 3:48:26.120]  It's 8.32 now with only two weeks left of 2009. We're taking a look back at some of
[3:48:26.120 --> 3:48:30.920]  the most interesting healthcare discoveries of the past year. Joining us is Fox 9 medical
[3:48:30.920 --> 3:48:34.240]  expert Dr. R. Kell Georgia to talk about it. Good morning.
[3:48:34.240 --> 3:48:39.080]  Good morning. First, the US has been adding a fluoride to its public water supply for
[3:48:39.080 --> 3:48:45.080]  decades and, of course, to prevent tooth decay. Well, now the searchers from Japan are suggesting
[3:48:45.080 --> 3:48:49.960]  that we add lithium. Good pause. Back it up a few seconds. Notice that she says, eh,
[3:48:49.960 --> 3:48:56.920]  we put fluoride in, eh, we put stuff in table salt, eh, lithium. You're being sold on this.
[3:48:56.920 --> 3:49:01.920]  I mean, this is, imagine 50 years ago a science fiction movie where they're putting stuff
[3:49:01.920 --> 3:49:07.200]  in your water and food. Well, they did write a science fiction book, 1932, Brave New World
[3:49:07.200 --> 3:49:11.480]  where they do drug you. And Aldous Huxley, who wrote it, his brother was a head eugenicist.
[3:49:11.480 --> 3:49:16.560]  He gave a 1962 speech at Berkeley saying, this is actually our plan. We are doing this. My
[3:49:16.560 --> 3:49:24.060]  book is nonfiction. Finish the clip. Tooth decay. Well, now the searchers from Japan
[3:49:24.060 --> 3:49:29.880]  are suggesting that we add lithium. So why is that? Well, they're actually not suggesting
[3:49:29.880 --> 3:49:33.620]  it, but they're certainly looking into it. Lithium is a medication that in prescription
[3:49:33.620 --> 3:49:38.960]  doses treats mood disorders in people with bipolar disorder or manic depressive illness.
[3:49:38.960 --> 3:49:44.520]  And what these researchers found in Japan is that it's, lithium is present in trace
[3:49:44.520 --> 3:49:48.960]  amounts in the normal water supply in some communities. And in those communities, they
[3:49:48.960 --> 3:49:53.840]  have a lower suicide rate. And so they're really investigating whether trace amounts
[3:49:53.840 --> 3:49:56.360]  of lithium... And they have a lower sex drive and a real
[3:49:56.360 --> 3:50:00.280]  piece and have brain damage....to really, in a positive way without having
[3:50:00.280 --> 3:50:03.480]  the bad effect... Oh, a positive way....to really affect the mood and decrease the suicide
[3:50:03.480 --> 3:50:08.080]  rate. Very interesting concept. You know, it's the same reason why we put iodine and
[3:50:08.080 --> 3:50:12.160]  salt, fluoride, and water. There's, there's many different examples of...
[3:50:12.160 --> 3:50:16.320]  All right. So there you are. It goes on and on how great it is and how wonderful it is
[3:50:16.320 --> 3:50:23.480]  and how we need it. And we did find the unedited clip on YouTube of the MSNBC host. It's a
[3:50:23.480 --> 3:50:28.600]  CNBC host on MSNBC with Chris Matthews. And he's sitting there and she's talking about
[3:50:28.600 --> 3:50:33.840]  how great it is to do this. You're being sold that poison is good. You're being told mercury
[3:50:33.840 --> 3:50:38.920]  is good for you. You're being told radiation is good for you. You're being told GMO crops
[3:50:38.920 --> 3:50:44.480]  is good for you. As all these new diseases pop up, as all this illness takes place,
[3:50:44.480 --> 3:50:48.840]  they get to kill you off early before you get social security, suck your savings out
[3:50:48.840 --> 3:50:53.400]  in medical care. The average doctor has no idea this is happening. We are all living
[3:50:53.400 --> 3:50:58.400]  in a nightmare science fiction control grid. Wake up, people. Have the mental strength
[3:50:58.400 --> 3:51:05.120]  to admit what's happening. Say no to government vaccinations. Say no to toxic overload. Say
[3:51:05.120 --> 3:51:10.360]  no to chemicals. Say yes to liquid zeolite. When you have fatigue, problem is concentrating

[3:52:03.160 --> 3:52:07.680]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[3:52:07.680 --> 3:52:13.440]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from
[3:52:13.440 --> 3:52:19.400]  underneath Americans at home. We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress and
[3:52:19.400 --> 3:52:24.600]  they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[3:52:24.600 --> 3:52:28.720]  citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies
[3:52:28.720 --> 3:52:34.280]  of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[3:52:34.280 --> 3:52:38.920]  its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're
[3:52:38.920 --> 3:52:43.040]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today
[3:52:43.040 --> 3:52:49.080]  it seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of
[3:52:49.080 --> 3:52:55.520]  the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching

[3:53:02.000 --> 3:53:07.200]  This is an emergency alert. People don't die of H1N1 infection. They die from system-wide
[3:53:07.200 --> 3:53:12.320]  intoxication and toxic shock. Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection
[3:53:12.320 --> 3:53:17.600]  and immune hyper-stimulation. Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize
[3:53:17.600 --> 3:53:23.120]  your body adding to your death risk. Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections,
[3:53:23.120 --> 3:53:27.120]  vaccinations, and drug toxicity. Call this number to get my free special report about

[3:54:07.240 --> 3:54:18.400]  I want listeners to really let this sink in. Think about it. Think about it long and hard.
[3:54:18.400 --> 3:54:22.840]  If the founding fathers discovered that the government was putting toxins in the water
[3:54:22.840 --> 3:54:28.920]  to brain damage them and make them more docile and pliable, would they get angry? Would your
[3:54:28.920 --> 3:54:34.720]  grandfather or your great-grandfather get violently angry if they were radiating food
[3:54:34.720 --> 3:54:40.200]  that destroys the food value and feeding it to his kids or grandkids? Would they get angry
[3:54:40.200 --> 3:54:45.000]  if hundreds of chemicals were being put in their water? Would they be angry if viruses
[3:54:45.000 --> 3:54:50.400]  were being sprayed on their meat? Yes. The reason you're not angry and the reason you're
[3:54:50.400 --> 3:54:56.840]  not like your grandparents or their parents is because, for at least 60 years, toxic chemicals
[3:54:56.840 --> 3:55:01.920]  have been put in your food and water. I have Times of London articles with the British
[3:55:01.920 --> 3:55:09.720]  and Australian government would ship rice with toxic sedatives on them and sterilants
[3:55:09.720 --> 3:55:15.960]  to Asia. This has been going on forever. You have a scientific dictatorship that does
[3:55:15.960 --> 3:55:21.700]  whatever it wants whenever it wants to you. The denial is over and because we've been
[3:55:21.700 --> 3:55:26.800]  exposing them, they know you're docile. They know you're partially drugged. You can still
[3:55:26.800 --> 3:55:32.000]  fight through it, get yourself cleaned up, then you'll feel your normal anger come back.
[3:55:32.000 --> 3:55:35.600]  That anger is to motivate you to get yourself out of a bad situation. And so now they're
[3:55:35.600 --> 3:55:41.000]  going, that's right. Lithium, that's right. Prozac in the water. Statins in the water.
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:44.320]  That's right. We're radiating your food. That's right. We're spraying viruses on it. That's
[3:55:44.320 --> 3:55:49.560]  right. We're feeding you GMO crops that sterilize everything that's fed it. That's right. That's
[3:55:49.560 --> 3:55:56.000]  right. Mercury is good for your baby. And I'm running out of time, but if you search
[3:55:56.000 --> 3:56:00.960]  engine, the term FDA says melamine, non-harmful, then you read the article. In fact, do that
[3:56:00.960 --> 3:56:05.320]  real fast. FDA says melamine, non-harmful. Remember a couple of years ago, all the Chinese
[3:56:05.320 --> 3:56:10.360]  plastic and food was killing people and making them sick. So the FDA just came out and said,
[3:56:10.360 --> 3:56:16.080]  we're just going to say it's not bad for you. What will they say next? Jumping off a 500
[3:56:16.080 --> 3:56:23.600]  foot cliff and it didn't bad for you. They think you're stupid. Are you? I meant to get
[3:56:23.600 --> 3:56:31.080]  into healthcare. Senate health bill passes major test health plans on collision course
[3:56:31.080 --> 3:56:37.440]  in the house. Washington Times reports Senate Winehouse foes of healthcare are birthers,
[3:56:37.440 --> 3:56:41.600]  right wingers and Arian groups. So this is a way to demonize anybody. You don't want
[3:56:41.600 --> 3:56:47.200]  government run healthcare. A big insurance company scam. Oh yeah, the big banks are
[3:56:47.200 --> 3:56:51.600]  behind this. That's on record. Their stocks are way up. Even the socialists don't want
[3:56:51.600 --> 3:56:56.880]  it now. They're finding out it's a scam on them. It's a ripoff. You have a banker bailout.
[3:56:56.880 --> 3:56:59.920]  It's a ripoff. You have global warming taxes. It's a ripoff. You have government health
[3:56:59.920 --> 3:57:08.200]  care. It's a ripoff. Everything's a ripoff. Everything's to consolidate wealth and power.
[3:57:08.200 --> 3:57:11.840]  Please warn everybody you know about this. Please reach out to your friends and family.

[3:58:53.120 --> 3:58:57.880]  you should consider buying a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could
[3:58:57.880 --> 3:59:02.360]  easily double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to
[3:59:02.360 --> 3:59:07.240]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government
[3:59:07.240 --> 3:59:12.280]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in
[3:59:12.280 --> 3:59:17.080]  some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist
[3:59:17.080 --> 3:59:21.840]  legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a
[3:59:21.840 --> 3:59:25.880]  threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather
[3:59:25.880 --> 3:59:29.320]  related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[3:59:29.320 --> 3:59:33.400]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[3:59:33.400 --> 3:59:37.560]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more
