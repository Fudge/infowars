[00:00.000 --> 00:12.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.640 --> 00:36.120]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex jones
[00:36.120 --> 00:43.280]  hard to believe it is already the 22nd day of December 2008 I did not do my
[00:43.280 --> 00:49.760]  Sunday show live yesterday that was not because of any desire I had to not do it
[00:49.760 --> 00:56.800]  I had some horrid stomach virus that kept me down from Saturday into this
[00:56.800 --> 01:02.960]  morning but I am about 90% back to normal for today so I am here ladies and
[01:02.960 --> 01:07.800]  gentlemen but I tell you when you really get sick and get a high fever it's
[01:07.800 --> 01:12.320]  almost cleansing I woke up this morning after being sick for a day and a half and
[01:12.320 --> 01:16.680]  just saw the world so much clearer it was kind of like a reset when a
[01:16.680 --> 01:20.840]  computer is not working as faster smoothly as it should be and you turn it
[01:20.840 --> 01:28.600]  off and turn it back on that's kind of how I feel today so a purifying
[01:28.600 --> 01:35.240]  experience I am back live and I am glad that you were tuned in to the broadcast
[01:35.240 --> 01:43.600]  today a lot of important news I want to cover today Dick Cheney did a fox news
[01:43.600 --> 01:50.600]  interview this weekend and said that the president isn't above the law he said
[01:50.600 --> 01:57.260]  the president is the law judge dread judge jury executioner supreme ruler the
[01:57.260 --> 02:04.840]  furor precept the furor system and then he chastised Biden in the control left
[02:04.840 --> 02:10.360]  right paradigm saying Biden's supposedly a constitutional lawyer he should know
[02:10.360 --> 02:16.800]  that article one of the Constitution doesn't apply to me and the news
[02:16.800 --> 02:21.000]  nationwide is now announcing dutifully that yes the vice president is above all
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.660]  laws now that made me think back to a couple years ago it's in my film
[02:26.660 --> 02:32.080]  terror storm general Hayden then head of the NSA who got caught lying about
[02:32.080 --> 02:38.960]  spying on the American people that warrants little effeminate demon then he
[02:38.960 --> 02:45.080]  went out with the national press club and said listen the fourth amendment does
[02:45.080 --> 02:48.240]  not say that we can't spy on you without warrants it just says we have to be
[02:48.240 --> 02:51.920]  reasonable about it so a constitutional lawyer gets up and says no the fourth
[02:51.920 --> 02:55.320]  amendment as if you need to be a constitutional lawyer to do this you step
[02:55.320 --> 03:01.760]  something says it says you have been probable cause oath or affirmation so
[03:01.760 --> 03:05.280]  not just probable cause not just probable cause you claim you've got to have
[03:05.280 --> 03:09.520]  witnesses and oath or affirmation and these people can't do this secretly they
[03:09.520 --> 03:13.920]  know the person you that that that you arrest with this knowledge or that you
[03:13.920 --> 03:18.040]  spy on this knowledge or that you raid with this knowledge you have to be able
[03:18.040 --> 03:25.160]  to put them in front of the person that they've accused face your accuser and
[03:25.160 --> 03:32.000]  he says no it does not say probable cause it says reasonable and he just kept
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.560]  repeating and he said it like four times in a row and then the exchanges
[03:35.560 --> 03:39.560]  intensified with the press and he said no it the fourth amendment does not say
[03:39.560 --> 03:47.000]  probable cause doesn't matter if it does doesn't matter if it clearly says
[03:47.000 --> 03:54.680]  that they have to have the evidence they have to see the dress hanging out the
[03:54.680 --> 04:01.400]  back of the trunk or they have to smell the marijuana or they have to see the
[04:01.400 --> 04:04.120]  guys running out of the bank with a black mask on and think well you know
[04:04.120 --> 04:09.680]  that I probable cause I thought that was the bank robbers so I pulled out my
[04:09.680 --> 04:14.120]  sidearm and told him to hit the ground or I was gonna open fire on them hands up
[04:14.120 --> 04:17.200]  and they didn't so I fold them full of lead well they'd say well that's due
[04:17.200 --> 04:22.880]  process that's probable cause I mean that's but no they're just saying look
[04:22.880 --> 04:30.000]  we'll just spy on all of you randomly with no warrants that's probable cause
[04:31.760 --> 04:39.560]  so we're gonna go over Cheney and Hayden today but again Biden and Obama are
[04:39.560 --> 04:42.440]  now saying they're not gonna prosecute anybody in the Bush administration
[04:42.440 --> 04:47.440]  they're not gonna go after anybody but turn abouts fair play I mean it was
[04:47.440 --> 04:50.960]  George Bush who left Bill Clinton alone remember that and pardon getting the
[04:50.960 --> 04:56.200]  rest of it we'll talk about that the economy a lot of big developments around
[04:56.200 --> 05:00.440]  the world stay with us we'll be right back
[05:00.440 --> 05:04.960]  hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[05:04.960 --> 05:08.240]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[05:08.240 --> 05:11.800]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[05:11.800 --> 05:15.040]  bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the Super
[05:15.040 --> 05:18.920]  Dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[05:18.920 --> 05:22.440]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[05:22.440 --> 05:26.240]  for special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off
[05:26.240 --> 05:30.720]  the telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out
[05:30.720 --> 05:34.400]  of thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the
[05:34.400 --> 05:38.200]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[05:38.200 --> 05:42.240]  nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many
[05:42.240 --> 05:46.440]  Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of
[05:46.440 --> 05:50.720]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food
[05:50.720 --> 05:54.440]  prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[05:54.440 --> 05:58.160]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[05:58.160 --> 06:01.760]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[06:01.760 --> 06:05.920]  but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[06:05.920 --> 06:09.960]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans
[06:09.960 --> 06:13.680]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends
[06:13.680 --> 06:17.760]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody
[06:17.760 --> 06:20.720]  out there listening it's very important for you understand that by having a
[06:20.720 --> 06:24.240]  supply of storeable food the government the new old order has a lot less control
[06:24.240 --> 06:28.480]  over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[06:28.480 --> 06:31.640]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[06:31.640 --> 06:35.640]  you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from
[06:35.640 --> 06:39.560]  E. Coli Salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese imports and they do it at

[07:05.640 --> 07:11.560]  today the first step is getting storeable food from his central Texas
[07:11.560 --> 07:17.040]  command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's
[07:17.040 --> 07:26.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network we are live ladies and gentlemen we're
[07:26.520 --> 07:33.600]  gonna be here for the next three hours and 52 minutes it is the 22nd of
[07:33.600 --> 07:42.760]  December 2008 coming up in the third hour today we have Peter Schiff who
[07:42.760 --> 07:49.320]  manages a multi-million dollar fund and is a Ron Paul's chief financial advisor
[07:49.320 --> 07:54.960]  who's become quite popular making the rounds on the financial news channels
[07:54.960 --> 07:59.960]  he'll be joining us to give us his forecast on what's coming up not just in
[07:59.960 --> 08:06.920]  some five-minute soundbite but in the lengthy interview coming up today it
[08:06.920 --> 08:11.040]  also looks like mr. Engdahl is going to be on with us as well so stay with us
[08:11.040 --> 08:16.240]  for that I also want to hear from the listeners and open the phones up in the
[08:16.240 --> 08:20.880]  first hour second hour third hour fourth hour today on any issue you wish to
[08:20.880 --> 08:37.480]  discuss 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 is the internet going down undersea
[08:37.480 --> 08:43.800]  subcables have just broken the London Times reported Saturday three of the
[08:43.800 --> 08:50.600]  four thousands of miles apart from each other were suddenly cut and of course
[08:50.600 --> 08:53.680]  you remember last year around the Middle East of the majority of the cables
[08:53.680 --> 08:59.120]  were also cut there in the Mediterranean and also in some of the other
[08:59.120 --> 09:07.840]  waterways around that area in route the internet networks company reports that
[09:07.840 --> 09:12.400]  three of their four internet subcables that run from Asia North America have
[09:12.400 --> 09:16.840]  been damaged these carry more than 75% of the traffic between the Middle East
[09:16.840 --> 09:23.800]  Europe and America it's hard to gather what this actually means it is that the
[09:23.800 --> 09:27.280]  internet is down more likely significantly slower than usual between
[09:27.280 --> 09:33.440]  the Middle East and the United States interesting story there here is another
[09:33.440 --> 09:42.040]  one and and this doesn't just deal with national DNA databases all over the
[09:42.040 --> 09:47.080]  western world for 35 years it also deals with the fact of just how ruthless and
[09:47.080 --> 09:51.040]  criminal the government is and again it's not the government the private
[09:51.040 --> 09:55.040]  corporations that masquerade his government that use it as a strip
[09:55.040 --> 10:00.920]  mining tool to rob and loot the public and dump the public down further in
[10:00.920 --> 10:05.920]  April of 2008 president Bush signed into law s 1858 which allows the federal
[10:05.920 --> 10:10.400]  government to screen the DNA of all newborn babies in the US this was to be
[10:10.400 --> 10:14.080]  implemented within six months meaning this collection is now being carried out
[10:14.080 --> 10:19.320]  congressman Ron Paul states that this bill is the first step towards the
[10:19.320 --> 10:25.120]  establishment of a national DNA database let's just stop right there we
[10:25.120 --> 10:28.440]  have a link to this natural news story up on info works dot com and prison
[10:28.440 --> 10:36.880]  planet dot com I learned 15 years ago back when I didn't know much that at
[10:36.880 --> 10:44.320]  birth if you were born in New Zealand Australia Canada the UK the US and a
[10:44.320 --> 10:48.320]  few other countries commonwealth nations the US is really still a commonwealth
[10:48.320 --> 10:51.920]  for all intents and purposes same programs same federal government style
[10:51.920 --> 10:57.880]  same system owned by the same people certainly and again I just discovered
[10:57.880 --> 11:00.960]  over time that we have all the same laws in the same order under the same names
[11:00.960 --> 11:05.480]  it's like call us commonwealth because we're the only non-commonwealth nation
[11:05.480 --> 11:10.520]  that behaves just like the commonwealth's
[11:10.600 --> 11:24.480]  those being under Queen of England Elizabeth the second number two but you
[11:24.480 --> 11:28.960]  know I learned about this 15 years ago that if you were 20 years or younger you
[11:28.960 --> 11:34.000]  had been in a DNA database I learned that Parkland Hospital when I was born in
[11:34.000 --> 11:42.640]  1974 took blood put me in a national DNA database you know now it's 35 years if
[11:42.640 --> 11:52.720]  you're born 73 forward in Australia the UK Canada the US New Zealand your blood
[11:52.720 --> 11:56.400]  was taken and it was put in an international DNA database and it was
[11:56.400 --> 12:01.640]  used of the government's claim that they own your blood they can patent
[12:01.640 --> 12:08.960]  different proteins or different DNA factors that are in there and the reason
[12:08.960 --> 12:11.560]  this is now making mainstream news is these companies come back to people
[12:11.560 --> 12:14.840]  decades later when they're having some DNA treatment done with their own body
[12:14.840 --> 12:18.160]  and they go oh did you know this company actually owns your blood yeah they bought
[12:18.160 --> 12:21.920]  the samples at birth and now to be able to have this gene therapy you've got to
[12:21.920 --> 12:26.280]  pay them for the right to use your own bone marrow
[12:26.280 --> 12:32.440]  they can also then specifically make a race specific bio weapon just for you
[12:32.440 --> 12:38.480]  or just for your family and it helps them with race specific bio weapons to
[12:38.480 --> 12:44.320]  know how to create systems that'll attack only certain groups or be more
[12:44.320 --> 12:50.640]  predisposed to attack certain groups but but all of this aside I went on air
[12:50.640 --> 12:55.280]  13 years ago and warned people and read federal international documents on air
[12:55.280 --> 13:00.200]  and then I don't know about 10 years ago I had a state rep on from Michigan and
[13:00.200 --> 13:03.680]  I had I remember about seven eight years ago a congressman on from South
[13:03.680 --> 13:08.560]  Carolina about it and we told everybody we said they're taking your blood at
[13:08.560 --> 13:12.200]  birth and they're putting it in a database and people would email me and
[13:12.200 --> 13:16.040]  call me and laugh at me and say you're a crazy person that wasn't a real
[13:16.040 --> 13:19.640]  congressman and this isn't a police state they're not secretly taking our
[13:19.640 --> 13:24.400]  blood for DNA databases and I said nonetheless five years the University of
[13:24.400 --> 13:30.440]  Texas runs the system for the federal government the US they're the main
[13:30.440 --> 13:35.360]  holder of it down in San Antonio they have another big one in Michigan one in
[13:35.360 --> 13:40.400]  California but the point is the main center is here in Texas and now because
[13:40.400 --> 13:43.680]  they were getting sued over it they just trick the mother at birth they say oh
[13:43.680 --> 13:48.560]  just sign this form we're testing your baby for for blood diseases why would
[13:48.560 --> 13:52.360]  you need to sign a form I mean we know they're lying that's not up for debate
[13:52.360 --> 13:59.120]  the point is why would you need to sign a form to check for blood diseases when
[13:59.120 --> 14:04.000]  they don't have you sign any other forms to check for problems they're not
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.600]  checking for blood diseases the reason they take three ampoules of blood one
[14:07.600 --> 14:12.160]  goes to the state health department one goes to the feds and then they sell the
[14:12.160 --> 14:25.160]  other one they get big money for it okay now this is the tyranny now they've been
[14:25.160 --> 14:36.080]  busy advertising to everybody they've been busy advertising that DNA is a
[14:36.080 --> 14:40.760]  hundred percent and why a third of the people on death row are innocent and I
[14:40.760 --> 14:46.160]  have no doubt that's true but they're only legitimizing DNA is a hundred
[14:46.160 --> 14:53.520]  percent because they've got half the country I would guess half the country's
[14:53.520 --> 14:58.800]  under 35 average life expectancy is what 74 for a male let's say a little bit
[14:58.800 --> 15:04.840]  under half the country they've got your blood they've got large amounts of it
[15:04.840 --> 15:16.760]  they've empirically suck multiple ampoules and they can frame you with this
[15:16.760 --> 15:20.920]  and they've been caught framing people with with their fingerprints yes
[15:20.920 --> 15:25.600]  fingerprints easy to frame somebody they just lift your prints and then they go
[15:25.600 --> 15:29.880]  place them at the scene well now they've thumb scanning to buy and sell and
[15:29.880 --> 15:33.680]  thumb scanning to get in the mall and thumb scanning to go to the library
[15:33.680 --> 15:37.360]  thumb scanning to do all this so of course you know they've got your fingers
[15:37.360 --> 15:41.840]  they've got your index finger they've got your thumb they've got your digital
[15:41.840 --> 15:45.160]  face photo so they can track you everywhere you go with their Pentagon
[15:45.160 --> 15:50.800]  face scanning cameras and all of this is being done so the bankers can carry
[15:50.800 --> 15:54.200]  out their criminal activities their dehumanization their enslavement of
[15:54.200 --> 15:58.920]  the people without us ever being able to challenge them all right I said I get
[15:58.920 --> 16:02.920]  into all the news I'm only covered two articles here world faces total financial
[16:02.920 --> 16:10.120]  meltdown bank of Spain chief we have the prime minister of Canada last week
[16:10.120 --> 16:13.760]  saying that we have Biden coming out saying things are far worse than he
[16:13.760 --> 16:20.280]  thought depression they're all doing this to destroy remaining confidence so
[16:20.280 --> 16:26.040]  there will be a world depression of course we told you they do that the
[16:26.040 --> 16:30.520]  governor of the bank of Spain on Sunday issued a bleak assessment of the
[16:30.520 --> 16:38.560]  economic crisis warning that the world faced a total financial meltdown
[16:38.560 --> 16:43.480]  unseen since the Great Depression the lack of confidence is total Miguel
[16:43.480 --> 16:52.760]  Angel Fernandez said in an interview with Spain's L Paris daily the inner bank
[16:52.760 --> 16:58.960]  lending market is not functioning and this is getting vicious cycles
[16:58.960 --> 17:04.560]  consumers are not consuming businesses are not taking on workers investors are
[17:04.560 --> 17:09.040]  not investing and the banks are not lending he goes on to say if it's not
[17:09.040 --> 17:16.040]  restored that we'll have a depression by 2010 basically he said this is the
[17:16.040 --> 17:23.280]  worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of 929 he said he said the
[17:23.280 --> 17:26.800]  European Central Bank of which he is a governing council member would cut
[17:26.800 --> 17:31.320]  interest rates in January of inflation expectations went much lower to below 2
[17:31.320 --> 17:36.640]  percent if among other variables we observe that inflation expectations go
[17:36.640 --> 17:43.880]  much below 2 percent it's illogical that we will lower rates regarding a dire
[17:43.880 --> 17:48.040]  situation in the United States he said he backed the decision by the US Federal
[17:48.040 --> 17:54.280]  Reserve to cut rates to zero in the face of a profound deflation fears of course
[17:54.280 --> 17:59.800]  you don't get low interest rates though you have a depression in the real

[23:29.200 --> 23:35.000]  know we didn't have an IRS back before until years after they set up the
[23:35.000 --> 23:43.640]  private federal reserve in 1913 but when they passed the federal reserve act
[23:43.640 --> 23:51.640]  before the Beatles and yesterday also gave us the income tax when a man it's
[23:51.640 --> 23:59.680]  still work and still would they'd have a constitutional amendment to do that
[23:59.680 --> 24:08.280]  that's right we built this country without an income tax did you know 100% of
[24:08.280 --> 24:16.520]  the income tax as you pay goes directly to the private Federal Reserve did you
[24:16.520 --> 24:23.040]  know you write your tax payment check to the Federal Reserve and they're an
[24:23.040 --> 24:32.400]  offshore bank with people like Madoff running it and they take that money they
[24:32.400 --> 24:35.320]  take that money and they come back and they buy up our media they come in they
[24:35.320 --> 24:39.160]  buy up our culture they strip mine our country they hand it over to foreign
[24:39.160 --> 24:43.960]  interest that's what you get for it and then with the income tax they write the
[24:43.960 --> 24:48.440]  code where it's impossible to you know pay them correctly or do it right because
[24:48.440 --> 24:51.880]  there is no right answer so penalties and interests let's say you don't pay a
[24:51.880 --> 24:56.160]  hundred dollars few years later they come back and want ten thousand or you
[24:56.160 --> 25:02.560]  don't pay a thousand dollars they want a hundred thousand it's mafia tax rate in
[25:02.560 --> 25:08.320]  this country is really about 60% see only criminals would come up with
[25:08.320 --> 25:11.720]  something like that a tax you can't figure out how to pay it right a tax
[25:11.720 --> 25:17.560]  that will destroy small businesses a tax that nobody can figure out you know
[25:17.560 --> 25:21.520]  fair taxes are ones on trade and commerce and buying and selling because you pay it
[25:21.520 --> 25:25.840]  one time it's even it's fair it's there let's see people are going let's have a
[25:25.840 --> 25:30.440]  fair tax then sorry they're going to give you a national sales tax which is
[25:30.440 --> 25:34.040]  going to be international on top of the income tax they're going to keep both of
[25:34.040 --> 25:40.040]  them and these evil people have found a way to pervert a fair tax they're going
[25:40.040 --> 25:42.400]  to use that to track and trace everything you buy selling do with your
[25:42.400 --> 25:47.800]  national ID card because it's going to be graduated a graduated sales tax so the
[25:47.800 --> 25:50.840]  poor don't have to pay it but really that's everything you do can be tracked
[25:50.840 --> 25:56.240]  and traced and then hey you bought too much stuff it shows your incomes 25
[25:56.240 --> 26:00.920]  thousand dollars a year but it shows you bought $30,000 worth of things this
[26:00.920 --> 26:07.160]  year so say you're gonna have to report everything you sell on ebay have to
[26:07.160 --> 26:12.120]  report all the yards you know let's report that old junker you sold you
[26:12.120 --> 26:17.160]  have to report that diamond ring you sold after grandma died this is a system of
[26:17.160 --> 26:24.040]  total regulation total control that is coming into place over the nation the
[26:24.040 --> 26:29.400]  world imagine criminals who want to be secure in the thought that that no one
[26:29.400 --> 26:33.280]  can resist them no one can stop them that no one is independent on a farm or a
[26:33.280 --> 26:38.120]  ranch that no one is independent medically that everybody is under their
[26:38.120 --> 26:46.960]  control that's what we're dealing with is as a society it's just horrible what
[26:46.960 --> 26:51.520]  they're constructing and and if you like tens of trillion stolen from
[26:51.520 --> 26:59.080]  taxpayers worldwide 8.5 trillion just eight weeks into the bank or takeover
[26:59.080 --> 27:03.360]  you've seen nothing yet I mean if you're enjoying what you've seen so far get
[27:03.360 --> 27:07.760]  ready because they want to create the depression so they can pose as your
[27:07.760 --> 27:13.040]  savior and give you national ID cards government paychecks where everything
[27:13.040 --> 27:19.200]  you do is under their control because the criminals want to make you be
[27:19.200 --> 27:22.960]  dependent on them they want to make you basically be their slaves be their
[27:22.960 --> 27:37.160]  servants when we come back I am going to get into Dick Cheney saying that not
[27:37.160 --> 27:42.760]  just the president but the president is above the law and he's telling Biden and
[27:42.760 --> 27:48.800]  Obama be sure and use all these new powers and he goes on to say hey the
[27:48.800 --> 27:52.840]  president and the vice president have the nuclear launch codes we can destroy
[27:52.840 --> 28:00.760]  the planet I mean that's quite a statement he's stating hey we are
[28:00.760 --> 28:13.600]  dictators of the planet by force du jour it's just a done deal we are the
[28:13.600 --> 28:19.680]  military industrial complex we can burn the planet to a crisp in five minutes if
[28:19.680 --> 28:26.400]  we want to and so to say that the president isn't the law to say the
[28:26.400 --> 28:31.680]  president isn't above the law his ass tonight and really Dick Cheney is being
[28:31.680 --> 28:36.600]  an absolutist he's being honest with you he's saying look we got the nukes we'll
[28:36.600 --> 28:41.320]  use them on you remember back when they were investigating 9-11 he said I'll
[28:41.320 --> 28:46.000]  meet the press about seven years ago he said look you're better not be any

[33:04.280 --> 33:10.320]  will cheat they will steal they will kill nobody was really sure he was
[33:10.320 --> 33:22.680]  for power and most of them when they get the power are completely unhappy you see a
[33:22.680 --> 33:30.400]  lot of conversions at that point worldly corrupt people will have a
[33:30.400 --> 33:43.120]  Scrooge Ian conversion will become true humanitarians and try to help their
[33:43.120 --> 33:55.600]  fellow man that's always beautiful and that happens but there's another type of
[33:55.600 --> 34:01.240]  elitist who truly thrives off of power and off all the signants and marks of
[34:01.240 --> 34:07.880]  rank and who just enjoys exercising raw power over populations
[34:07.880 --> 34:11.600]  and that's who we're talking about today and I'm going to get more into that in one
[34:11.600 --> 34:19.040]  moment than your phone calls at 1-800-25-99231 William Engel a historian

[34:28.080 --> 34:31.480]  minutes or a little bit less then we have Peter Schiff joining us and then
[34:31.480 --> 34:36.400]  Bill Veal attorney for April Gallup will be joining us coming up in the last
[34:36.400 --> 34:41.960]  hour today she of course survivor of the Pentagon attack right where the object
[34:41.960 --> 34:47.800]  came in right where the explosives went off and well we'll tell you all about the
[34:47.800 --> 34:52.560]  lawsuit and what it's alleging what it's saying in this exclusive this is the
[34:52.560 --> 34:57.880]  first time the lawsuits public but this is the first interview that I know of
[34:57.880 --> 35:03.880]  with mr. Veal since this has been filed we may even have Gallup on with us as
[35:03.880 --> 35:11.640]  well today I sound a bit slow today I got over the stomach bug I'm actually
[35:11.640 --> 35:21.760]  still not completely over it but I am here nevertheless okay finishing up with
[35:21.760 --> 35:26.960]  Dick Cheney and the nature of power let's go ahead and play the clip of Dick
[35:26.960 --> 35:35.320]  Cheney this is from Fox News Sunday saying that he is the law that the
[35:35.320 --> 35:41.720]  president and the vice-president are the law and that they have the thermal
[35:41.720 --> 35:45.520]  nuclear weapons and that that's absolute power
[35:48.320 --> 35:54.680]  John you have that clip yeah let's let's go ahead and roll that this is at the
[35:54.680 --> 35:59.600]  core of the controversies that I want to get to with you in a moment if the
[35:59.600 --> 36:04.280]  president during war decides to do something to protect the country is it
[36:04.280 --> 36:12.360]  legal and in general proposition I'd say yes you need to be more specific than
[36:12.360 --> 36:18.640]  that I mean but clearly when you take the oath of office on January 20th of 2001
[36:18.640 --> 36:23.200]  as we did and you take the oath to support and defend and protect the
[36:23.200 --> 36:27.080]  Constitution the United States against all enemies foreign to domestic there's
[36:27.080 --> 36:32.760]  no question about which responsibilities are in that regard and again I think
[36:32.760 --> 36:37.440]  that they're bound to be debates and arguments from time to time and
[36:37.440 --> 36:43.160]  wrestling back and forth about what kind of authority is appropriate in any
[36:43.160 --> 36:47.800]  specific circumstance but I think that what we've done has been been totally
[36:47.800 --> 36:52.120]  consistent with what the Constitution provides for the president of the United
[36:52.120 --> 36:57.600]  States now for 50 years is followed at all times 24 hours a day by a military
[36:57.600 --> 37:03.240]  carrying a football that contains the nuclear codes that he would use and be
[37:03.240 --> 37:07.680]  authorized to use in the event of a nuclear attack on the United States he
[37:07.680 --> 37:11.880]  could launch the kind of a devastating attack the world's never seen he doesn't
[37:11.880 --> 37:15.000]  have to check with anybody he doesn't have to call the Congress he doesn't have
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.600]  to check with the courts he has that authority because of the nature of the
[37:18.600 --> 37:24.160]  world we live in so what unfortunate but I think we're perfectly appropriate to
[37:24.160 --> 37:31.000]  take the steps of that all right now again national security dictatorship set
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.800]  up in 1947 the private offshore corporations completely take over the
[37:35.800 --> 37:39.360]  country at that time they've now been using it as an engine for global
[37:39.360 --> 37:43.640]  domination ever since and shaney rightfully says look the president can
[37:43.640 --> 37:51.840]  destroy the earth you know so physically he is dictator of the planet now it
[37:51.840 --> 37:55.440]  doesn't mean it's legitimate doesn't mean it's constitutional doesn't mean it's
[37:55.440 --> 37:59.640]  any of those things and that's why the White House says they can torture
[37:59.640 --> 38:03.800]  children in front of their parents that's why they say they can bury people
[38:03.800 --> 38:09.720]  alive and pull their fingernails out with pliers in their memos that's why
[38:09.720 --> 38:14.560]  whenever John you was you know asked at a council on farm relations meeting in
[38:14.560 --> 38:18.480]  Chicago can you torture children with pliers can you cross their testicles
[38:18.480 --> 38:25.600]  he said yes because you know if you can destroy the earth and I guess saying
[38:25.600 --> 38:31.260]  nobody can stop me then why can't you torture children and why can't you steal
[38:31.260 --> 38:36.560]  8.5 trillion and growing by a trillion ever every week why can't you just go
[38:36.560 --> 38:39.680]  ahead and take it and take it offshore and tell Congress hey you have no
[38:39.680 --> 38:48.720]  authority to see where the money went why can't you go ahead and take people's
[38:48.720 --> 38:52.600]  DNA at birth for 35 years and put it in a secret DNA database and then when
[38:52.600 --> 38:57.320]  people find out about it start bitching and complaining have president Bush just
[38:57.320 --> 39:02.680]  sign a bill making it law retroactively oh we caught the president
[39:02.680 --> 39:07.680]  murdering a bunch of people he likes to go out and then one of the DC parks at
[39:07.680 --> 39:10.920]  night and find young women and strangle them well we'll just pay how long has
[39:10.920 --> 39:15.280]  been strangling women oh six years we'll just pass a retroactive law he can
[39:15.280 --> 39:19.720]  strangle women oh we found out they've been spying on the American people for
[39:19.720 --> 39:23.960]  political control nothing to do with terrorism for years what do we do oh we
[39:23.960 --> 39:28.040]  just pass a law retroactively saying they can do it and by the way if you don't
[39:28.040 --> 39:33.600]  like it we got noobs what did the British Ministry of Defense report say
[39:33.600 --> 39:39.280]  last year what did the US government report say this year their future trends
[39:39.280 --> 39:43.920]  they said the militaries of the West work for the private institutions that are
[39:43.920 --> 39:47.800]  globalist that are going to destroy the middle class of the West middle class is
[39:47.800 --> 39:51.080]  going to riot they're going to try to legitimately take control of government
[39:51.080 --> 39:55.320]  the military works for the private offshore banks we may have to use
[39:55.320 --> 40:01.000]  neutron bombs on them just governments will probably use I mean they're saying
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.840]  governments are probably going to use they're saying they believe it's going to
[40:04.840 --> 40:11.280]  happen neutron bombs will be used on us see the nukes are for us folks just like
[40:11.280 --> 40:19.920]  they're for an Afghani or a Nigerian or a Venezuelan or a pit can islander pit
[40:19.920 --> 40:25.640]  Karen Islander it doesn't matter the nukes are for us and the giant arsenal of
[40:25.640 --> 40:30.240]  neutron bombs they're just radiation bombs they leave no residue kill all
[40:30.240 --> 40:34.440]  life forms the buildings the computers the water treatment plants the
[40:34.440 --> 40:39.000]  infrastructure it's all still there that's what they have in place and
[40:39.000 --> 40:43.360]  they're so psychopathic and so wild I have no doubt that the UN says they
[40:43.360 --> 40:47.120]  180% of us dead by a certain day if they can't do the food and the water and
[40:47.120 --> 40:56.000]  eugenics they may just start you know I mean with with a small fleet of robotic
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.040]  aircraft and they're converting the entire Air Force other than troop
[40:59.040 --> 41:03.520]  carriers over robotic they can have robotic centers and they admit they've
[41:03.520 --> 41:10.360]  built these which robotically load the neutron weapons on board the drone
[41:10.360 --> 41:16.760]  bombers and they could put them in the air over every major capital and of
[41:16.760 --> 41:20.520]  course each nation would do this to itself they would neutron their own
[41:20.520 --> 41:24.520]  population now you'll notice that if they plan to do that folks I'm not
[41:24.520 --> 41:29.280]  kidding this is a probable scenario I've really been studying them deeply and
[41:29.280 --> 41:32.200]  what they're into and I'm telling you that's why they don't care that's why
[41:32.200 --> 41:35.920]  they'll steal any amount of money from you it none of it even means anything
[41:35.920 --> 41:41.920]  these people know it's about the exercise of power they're nihilist and then
[41:41.920 --> 41:46.160]  they'll just hit every major city and then the next wave of drones will hit
[41:46.160 --> 41:50.240]  the smaller cities and the next wave of drones will hit the medium-sized cities
[41:50.240 --> 41:57.880]  and so down to the smaller cities and then none of this is going to matter
[41:57.880 --> 42:04.200]  anymore the Pentagon the military is run by psychopathic eugenicists that
[42:04.200 --> 42:14.160]  created Stalin Hitler Mao Lenin all of them and so when you get Dick Cheney
[42:14.160 --> 42:19.520]  running around saying look of course the president is above the law and above the
[42:19.520 --> 42:30.040]  Congress and and and he went further to attack Biden and to say well you know
[42:35.920 --> 42:39.080]  you know
[42:42.280 --> 42:47.840]  just incredible he went on to attack Biden and them and saying look they
[42:47.840 --> 42:52.040]  better want to use all these incredible powers we've expanded it's for America's
[42:52.040 --> 43:01.160]  safety besides Biden should know that you know the Constitution only limits the
[43:01.160 --> 43:06.920]  legislative not the executive and that's similar to the asinine statement
[43:06.920 --> 43:10.840]  made by Hayden over and over again but in particular the one that got the most
[43:10.840 --> 43:14.320]  attention was at the National Press Club two years ago where he said look we
[43:14.320 --> 43:21.400]  are above the law basically he said he said we can spy on whoever we want as
[43:21.400 --> 43:26.040]  long as we say it's reasonable and the constitutional law expert gets up and
[43:26.040 --> 43:34.520]  says no you got to have probable cause and other affirmation he says no no we
[43:34.520 --> 43:39.600]  don't that's not in there no it doesn't say that now see that's total disdain by
[43:39.600 --> 43:44.600]  Hayden it's total disdain by chain they're just saying we don't care what
[43:44.600 --> 43:55.240]  you say what you do we'll do whatever we want here is Hayden I think today we're
[43:55.240 --> 44:01.000]  having a computer problem loading these John are you there are you hearing me
[44:01.000 --> 44:12.200]  when I'm saying play these clips the the Hayden clip no the first one my
[44:12.200 --> 44:16.120]  understanding is that the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution specifies
[44:16.120 --> 44:22.760]  that you must have probable cause to be able to do a search that does not
[44:22.760 --> 44:28.440]  violate an American's right against unlawful ceases and search searches and
[44:28.440 --> 44:33.320]  seizures actually the Fourth Amendment actually protects all of us against
[44:33.320 --> 44:36.760]  unreasonable search and seizure but that's what the but the man says the
[44:36.760 --> 44:41.040]  measure is probable cause I believe the amendment says unreasonable search and
[44:41.040 --> 44:45.120]  seizure but does it not say proper the bill the court standard illegal
[44:45.120 --> 44:48.760]  standard search and see the legal standard is probable cause just to be
[44:48.760 --> 44:53.320]  very clear okay and believe me if there's any amendment to the Constitution that
[44:53.320 --> 44:56.240]  employees of the National Security Agency are familiar with it's the fourth
[44:56.240 --> 45:02.360]  right and and it is a reasonable to standard in the fourth amendment to
[45:02.360 --> 45:05.720]  quote the fourth amendment to the Constitution of the United States in
[45:05.720 --> 45:09.080]  its entirety the one the general in the NSA folks are so familiar with and know
[45:09.080 --> 45:13.360]  is about reasonableness and not about probable cause quote the right of the
[45:13.360 --> 45:17.200]  people to be secure in their person's houses papers and effects against
[45:17.200 --> 45:22.720]  unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated no warrant shall issue
[45:22.720 --> 45:28.480]  but upon probable cause supported by oath or affirmation and particularly
[45:28.480 --> 45:34.160]  describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized well
[45:34.160 --> 45:39.280]  maybe they have a different Constitution over there at the NSA so there you have
[45:39.280 --> 45:43.120]  it and I've got a bunch of other clips it's the same thing they have disdain
[45:43.120 --> 45:50.400]  for the public now how did they get the power to have a Sunday basically
[45:50.400 --> 45:53.800]  martial law and where the president can nuke the whole earth if he feels like
[45:53.800 --> 45:59.920]  it well that isn't actually what the law says and that's why under PDD 51
[45:59.920 --> 46:04.800]  president Bush says under an emergency Congress has no authority and by the way
[46:04.800 --> 46:09.160]  it doesn't take us being under nuke attack any financial any environmental or
[46:09.160 --> 46:15.360]  any disaster I choose the Congress is dissolved permanently at my pleasure
[46:15.360 --> 46:19.680]  cannot review what I'm saying and the governors are dissolved and the
[46:19.680 --> 46:24.000]  military is under my control and then now they're dissolving the governor's
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.960]  power over the military they're getting rid of the National Guard they're
[46:26.960 --> 46:30.240]  telling us troops are going on the streets and all of this will be continued
[46:30.240 --> 46:34.880]  and he's announced he's going to radically expand it by Barack Obama and
[46:34.880 --> 46:42.200]  Biden Joe Biden and Barack Obama so we're going into very dangerous times here
[46:42.200 --> 46:48.080]  ladies and gentlemen now who was somebody back in World War two that found
[46:48.080 --> 46:54.920]  out that the US was planning to give the nukes to Russia who was somebody that
[46:54.920 --> 47:01.160]  found out that 12,000 US soldiers had been picked up in a area of eastern
[47:01.160 --> 47:06.680]  Germany by the Soviets when they came through and the Soviets took those
[47:06.680 --> 47:12.360]  American soldiers this is on record mainline history 12,000 took US soldiers
[47:12.360 --> 47:19.240]  held by Nazis there was US soldiers held by Nazis held by the Germans in each
[47:19.240 --> 47:27.560]  Germany the Russians come through they grab them and the Russians wanted to
[47:27.560 --> 47:31.120]  use them for slave labor and gulags and to interrogate them about the US Army
[47:31.120 --> 47:38.800]  system and the Air Force well then the Army Air Corps and Patton complained so
[47:38.800 --> 47:43.200]  they killed him now we've always told you this and had guessed on now the
[47:43.200 --> 47:51.280]  documents somebody declassified the the diaries have been declassified and the
[47:51.280 --> 47:54.880]  writer of the book the London Telegraph says they're convinced that yes Patton
[47:54.880 --> 48:00.560]  was killed and this is an aid to the Queen and you know this he goes through
[48:00.560 --> 48:04.520]  the whole article why they kill Patton how they killed him you know Americans
[48:04.520 --> 48:08.000]  are told that an ox cart hitting that's not true they they rammed him with a
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.480]  truck and dumped him over and then jumped up in the truck and shot him in
[48:11.480 --> 48:15.760]  the throat in front of everybody with a low-velocity bullet to break his neck
[48:15.760 --> 48:19.400]  but so it wouldn't look like a bullet wound he still lived so they sent in the
[48:19.400 --> 48:25.720]  NKVD to killing under Wild Bill Donovan's orders the OSS you can go read
[48:25.720 --> 48:29.200]  that but I mean you know don't give me it's a patriotic military and a
[48:29.200 --> 48:36.120]  patriotic government I mean Patton was a mad dog killer when he was fighting
[48:36.120 --> 48:42.920]  another enemy but the point is that you know the greatest US general in World
[48:42.920 --> 48:49.240]  War two and they just killed him he said look you know the media says oh he
[48:49.240 --> 48:53.240]  hated the Russians well you can read his writings in his letters home and he was
[48:53.240 --> 48:57.120]  promising to go home and go to Congress he got freaked out when he said why is
[48:57.120 --> 49:03.360]  our government giving 12,000 US soldiers to the Russians why are we giving the
[49:03.360 --> 49:07.960]  Russians all the German scientists why are we being friends with them they are
[49:07.960 --> 49:11.120]  going to go at us they're gonna because he didn't understand the bigger picture
[49:11.120 --> 49:16.480]  they were meant to be given the nukes they were meant to be empowered but
[49:16.480 --> 49:22.640]  General George S. Patton was assassinated to silence his criticism of allied
[49:22.640 --> 49:27.280]  war leaders London Telegraph headline George S. Patton America's greatest
[49:27.280 --> 49:35.480]  combat general of World War two was assassinated after the conflict with the
[49:35.480 --> 49:42.840]  connivance of US leaders the newly unearthed diaries and colorful of the
[49:42.840 --> 49:45.880]  colorful assassin who they also interviewed before he died with a
[49:45.880 --> 49:52.080]  wartime office of strategic services the forerunner of the CIA the real that
[49:52.080 --> 49:56.440]  American spy chiefs wanted Patton dead because he was threatened to expose
[49:56.440 --> 50:01.160]  allied collusion with Russians at the cost of American lives then it mentions
[50:01.160 --> 50:07.480]  in here that dealing with US prisoners yeah 12,000 US troops he said what we're

[53:37.560 --> 53:43.840]  honor Patton wouldn't leave 12,000 US soldiers who'd been captured by the
[53:43.840 --> 53:52.120]  Russians out of German POW camps he wouldn't by the way the classic dis info
[53:52.120 --> 53:56.720]  operatives are even in this article we posted on info wars dot com trying to

[54:01.360 --> 54:05.280]  who was later on the 9-11 Commission and the dis info operative goes into the
[54:05.280 --> 54:10.040]  comments and says look they're saying this guy the assassin died in 99 but that
[54:10.040 --> 54:14.440]  he was in the 9-11 Commission it doesn't say that it says he worked for
[54:14.440 --> 54:18.320]  somebody who later was in the 9-11 Commission so see even the government
[54:18.320 --> 54:23.480]  operatives are on the site even happy that they killed Patton see it's it's
[54:23.480 --> 54:27.680]  part of a victory against honor a victory against goodness it's it's just
[54:27.680 --> 54:31.480]  reveling you know that's why they post these videos online of them shooting
[54:31.480 --> 54:36.360]  whole families in Iraq and then laughing so that's what's dangerous about the
[54:36.360 --> 54:40.280]  military mindset ladies and gentlemen because you know you fire bomb
[54:40.280 --> 54:43.680]  Dresden and kill half a million people in one night you bomb Hiroshima and
[54:43.680 --> 54:48.600]  Akasaki and kill over a million yeah what does it matter to kill three thousand
[54:48.600 --> 54:53.120]  on 9-11 to get your agenda through yeah what does it matter to break a few eggs
[54:53.120 --> 54:57.160]  yeah you know the president can nuke the whole earth so he's above the law all
[54:57.160 --> 55:01.000]  hail the president and I've been around military commanders they just grovel and
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.960]  like sexually get excited about the football and the nuke codes there you
[55:05.960 --> 55:10.240]  know they're into just the power of it yeah destroying our planet destroying
[55:10.240 --> 55:15.680]  our future destroying our children's future it's just a very sick group of
[55:15.680 --> 55:22.760]  ruthless people that are in control and you've got a sick population that thinks
[55:22.760 --> 55:26.440]  it's cute and says yeah turn the Middle East into a parking lot kill all the
[55:26.440 --> 55:30.560]  Muslims what you don't know is that the same elite doesn't care about you either
[55:30.560 --> 55:36.320]  Bubba and when Patton said hey you know what I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna sit
[55:36.320 --> 55:40.280]  down and shut up while the Russians take 12,000 of our troops and work them to
[55:40.280 --> 55:47.360]  death and torture them and they said you know what then die Patton die you can
[55:47.360 --> 55:51.720]  read his correspondence you know it's like well they say it's just the
[55:51.720 --> 55:55.280]  military and people die we don't want to upset the Russians see see once you
[55:55.280 --> 55:58.560]  don't care about Iraqis well you don't care about your own people see how that
[55:58.560 --> 56:03.320]  works folks they don't work for us they work for themselves and they all kill
[56:03.320 --> 56:09.240]  each other either as well oh man we're in trouble all right I'm gonna get more
[56:09.240 --> 56:15.160]  into that later let's talk to be in in Canada and then Robert and others go
[56:15.160 --> 56:20.120]  ahead man hey Alex it's good to talk to you let's talk to you I was taught I was
[56:20.120 --> 56:24.920]  watching Bloomberg today and I watched Fred good one day and he was pretty much
[56:24.920 --> 56:28.440]  foaming out of the mouth that made me made my blood boil enough I had to give
[56:28.440 --> 56:34.360]  me a call what I wanted to talk to you about was the Star reported that Canada
[56:34.360 --> 56:40.400]  will now be shareholders of General Motors and Chrysler did you hear about
[56:40.400 --> 56:43.440]  that yeah well everything's foreign-owned now that's what globalism is
[56:43.440 --> 56:48.120]  nothing can be American-owned they set up deals were basically only foreign
[56:48.120 --> 56:53.600]  countries and in foreign institutions can control us that's globalism it's
[56:53.600 --> 56:59.840]  about conquering us financially okay
[56:59.840 --> 57:04.880]  Chinese answer would be hey we got the football we can nuke it all don't even
[57:04.880 --> 57:09.080]  discuss what we do just go along with whatever we say and be glad if we let

[57:25.600 --> 57:30.480]  probably spying on your neighbors and if you won't take the job then they'll
[57:30.480 --> 57:33.640]  just you'll be one of the people that the neighbors report on that they put in a
[57:33.640 --> 57:40.040]  gulag and then you'll work 12 months out of the year 18 hours a day slaving with

[59:39.520 --> 59:45.760]  and how much trouble he's in no I hear you and it's horrible been hung up very
[59:45.760 --> 59:50.440]  very serious but it's designed that way to domesticate us to get us under their
[59:50.440 --> 59:54.800]  control let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Colorado Robert you're on the
[59:54.800 --> 59:59.840]  air welcome hey good morning thanks for making my call out a couple things number
[59:59.840 --> 1:00:05.400]  one you were asking the question earlier about who was a guy that found out about
[1:00:05.400 --> 1:00:10.000]  the US giving secrets of Russians during World War two were you alluding to
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:19.080]  Major Jordan's Diaries no no no I was mentioning I was talking about Pat
[1:00:19.080 --> 1:00:23.640]  okay okay you mean I you mean I did that whole ten minute spiel and I'm not a
[1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:26.520]  good communicator I guess and you didn't know I was talking about a murdering
[1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:31.200]  Patton well yeah you did say that but it just what clicked into my brain was
[1:00:31.200 --> 1:00:34.680]  Major Jordan's Diaries which was along the same lines he was a guy who found out
[1:00:34.680 --> 1:00:38.040]  basically the same thing that we were given secrets to the Russians and so on
[1:00:38.040 --> 1:00:41.600]  so forth that's what made me think of that no you said Patton so I guess that's
[1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:50.880]  my mistake um the other thing is that Alex back during the 2005 Hurricane
[1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:55.200]  Katrina in New Orleans you you were on the police pretty hard about they should
[1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:58.680]  be fired for relieving their pulse and so forth since then when I hear you
[1:00:58.680 --> 1:01:01.640]  mentioned it you've kind of softened your stance if you found out something
[1:01:01.640 --> 1:01:05.200]  different about what happened there or well yeah I mean we didn't know for three
[1:01:05.200 --> 1:01:09.600]  days that FEMA jammed all the cell phones and went in and physically cut all
[1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:13.800]  the police radio towers physically with fire axes and so within three or four
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:17.720]  days after I mean at first when it said that they walked off their post I said
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:21.320]  how dare them we didn't know that the feds had come in and cut their
[1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:27.040]  communications so I reversed myself immediately at that point that makes
[1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:30.880]  sense okay keep up the good work thank you I appreciate your call it's kind of
[1:01:30.880 --> 1:01:36.280]  like the first two hours of the NATO sneak attack on South Ossetia against
[1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:40.680]  the Russians CNN was announcing the Russians at snuck attack and I'm not
[1:01:40.680 --> 1:01:44.880]  even prepared to deal with lies of that level so I thought my god this is
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:49.360]  incredible CNN's reporting the Russians have snuck attack and then a couple
[1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:52.720]  hours later I went and read the foreign news and then even you know read
[1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:58.160]  addendums on CNN they're like well actually after Georgia attacks out
[1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:03.600]  Ossetia so I had to reverse myself I mean you know much can be made of these
[1:02:03.600 --> 1:02:09.680]  things but I mean I routinely get things wrong and then we go back and and you
[1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:16.400]  know correct that a lot has taken out of context as well it's like on y2k ABC news
[1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:24.280]  announces a missile has been fired from Russia at the United States and all the
[1:02:24.280 --> 1:02:27.080]  phones start ringing everybody's calling the show about it and I say that's not
[1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:32.680]  true so I run out during the break turn on ABC news and they're announcing it I
[1:02:32.680 --> 1:02:37.960]  go back on air and I say yeah it's happening and then about 10 minutes
[1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:42.040]  later we said no from norad it was just a scud missile and I said that was weird
[1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:47.880]  because they had the Russians with them at norad and the Russians in the US had
[1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:52.920]  a weird press conference after so that was some Psyop well what did co and tell
[1:02:52.920 --> 1:02:57.000]  pro to do they claimed I put out the story about the missile when it had been
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:01.160]  on ABC news and callers at the show be like a caller called in and said I just
[1:03:01.160 --> 1:03:04.440]  heard a missile was fired from Russia and I go okay let me check yeah they say
[1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:09.160]  that's true we don't know if this is true and then the government takes that
[1:03:09.160 --> 1:03:13.600]  edits it and says that I said Russia just you just out of nowhere I just came
[1:03:13.600 --> 1:03:18.320]  on air and announced that a missile been fired from Russia so that's the kind of
[1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:23.200]  deception that we deal with Jim Troy Maggie Eric we're gonna get to all of
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:33.040]  you with our guests F William Engdahl that's coming up after the break some of
[1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:35.800]  the other news I have later in the show I have time I'm gonna read this in its
[1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:40.160]  entirety general George S. Patton was assassinated to silence his criticism of
[1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:46.400]  allied war leaders one in Telegraph another one here robots ready to run
[1:03:46.400 --> 1:03:53.560]  the world I want to get to that out of Russia today more on the bill nobody
[1:03:53.560 --> 1:04:01.800]  noticed national DNA data bank now law and a lot more coming up today we'll
[1:04:01.800 --> 1:04:07.920]  also get more into Bernard Madoff the front man for a larger Ponzi swindles
[1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:12.720]  stay with us hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:16.080]  important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we
[1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:19.800]  need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand
[1:04:19.800 --> 1:04:22.920]  in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the
[1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:27.120]  Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:30.640]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:34.280]  for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned
[1:04:34.280 --> 1:04:38.600]  off the telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least
[1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:42.600]  out of thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the
[1:04:42.600 --> 1:04:46.400]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[1:04:46.400 --> 1:04:50.440]  nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many
[1:04:50.440 --> 1:04:54.680]  Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany superinflation the cost of a loaf of
[1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:58.920]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food
[1:04:58.920 --> 1:05:02.680]  prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[1:05:02.680 --> 1:05:06.400]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:10.000]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:14.160]  but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:17.680]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of
[1:05:17.680 --> 1:05:21.480]  Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my
[1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:25.680]  friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for
[1:05:25.680 --> 1:05:28.640]  everybody out there listening it's very important for you understand that by
[1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:31.840]  having a supply of storeable food the government the new old order has a lot
[1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:35.360]  less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[1:05:35.360 --> 1:05:39.120]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final
[1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:42.520]  equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship

[1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:28.360]  there to remember that just because those of us that listen to this show or
[1:07:28.360 --> 1:07:31.760]  that are informed about the New World Order and how the world really operates
[1:07:31.760 --> 1:07:34.680]  just because we know what's going on doesn't mean our neighbors our friends
[1:07:34.680 --> 1:07:38.240]  our family do and you may have tried to wake them up a year ago two years ago
[1:07:38.240 --> 1:07:43.720]  whatever and they weren't listening now people are more apt to listen and even
[1:07:43.720 --> 1:07:50.320]  if they don't listen now they will remember what you said today a year from
[1:07:50.320 --> 1:07:54.040]  now two years from now three years from now and that's the reason this radio
[1:07:54.040 --> 1:07:59.000]  show is just exploding exponentially my books the films and materials is because
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:03.600]  everything we talked about has come true everything we've discussed has

[1:09:42.400 --> 1:09:48.000]  as a library in the fight against the new world order believe me folks the
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.680]  reason Terry always tries to crack down on free speech is that free speech
[1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:55.480]  hurts Terry and that's why they're moving against the web and going with
[1:09:55.480 --> 1:09:58.640]  their full spectrum dominance right now because they know the things they're
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:02.520]  doing are so unpopular they're not gonna be able to get away with it that's why
[1:10:02.520 --> 1:10:06.520]  Cheney's trying to say hey we've got the nukes we can nuke all of you we're
[1:10:06.520 --> 1:10:10.240]  above the law we can torture children they're trying to just set a precedent
[1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:15.040]  that the sky's the limit you know 8.5 trillion stolen in eight weeks and
[1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:22.160]  and that's two week old numbers it just keeps growing I mean the level of once
[1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:26.200]  an abandoned and lawlessness we're seeing it must be met with resistance we
[1:10:26.200 --> 1:10:30.760]  must speak out against it so again prisonplanet.tv if you're not online

[1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:06.440]  Engdahl and if I try to describe everything he does it would take too
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:11.880]  long but his research bridges economics politics in the less known field of
[1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:16.080]  geopolitics his work is influenced by numerous economists but most especially
[1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:20.680]  by the German historian economist Frederick List he has authored the book
[1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:26.080]  a century of war Anglo-American oil politics the New World Order and he's
[1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:30.160]  done a lot of other work written for major publications around the world and
[1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:34.600]  he joins us for five minutes to the next hour then mr. Schiff joins us I
[1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:38.600]  appreciate you coming on your your new book doesn't come until January but
[1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:42.760]  we're gonna talk about it full spectrum dominance give us the full title mr.
[1:11:42.760 --> 1:11:47.000]  Engdahl and then break down what full spectrum dominance or complete
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:53.240]  technological enslavement system is okay Alex enjoying being being with you
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:59.800]  again the book full spectrum dominance the subtitle is I think tells it all
[1:11:59.800 --> 1:12:06.760]  it's totalitarian democracy in the New World Order and basically as I see it
[1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:12.840]  the the post-war us informal empire if you want to call it that the post-war us
[1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:18.880]  projection of power post 1945 was really based on two fundamental pillars one
[1:12:18.880 --> 1:12:25.440]  was the the power of Wall Street and the dollar-based system of then the gold
[1:12:25.440 --> 1:12:30.760]  standard and later simply the dollar-based fiat money system after 1971 the
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:34.520]  role of New York is the financial capital of the world as it had been with the
[1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:40.760]  British Empire century earlier was the key element to controlling the world or
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:46.080]  controlling the dominant trends of world politics in the post-war period that is
[1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:51.120]  now going up in flames with with the crisis that we're living through right
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:56.160]  now it's going to get horrendously worse it's the American economy is going to
[1:12:56.160 --> 1:13:00.600]  go through pure hell worse than anything in the 1930s and that means the second
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:04.920]  pillar is the only thing that the US elites have left and that is the
[1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:09.880]  military military power projection the Pentagon calls it full spectrum dominance
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:16.200]  now what what do I imply by that well number one they have to permanently try
[1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:22.560]  to take off of the table the potential of the nations of Western Europe Germany
[1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:28.880]  France Italy and so forth and Russia and China coming together perhaps with
[1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:35.440]  India at some point joining them and creating an economic trade zone or
[1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:40.080]  zone of cooperation whatever you want to call it but somewhere where they began
[1:13:40.080 --> 1:13:46.680]  being less dependent on the dollar system and more dependent on on protected
[1:13:46.680 --> 1:13:50.360]  kind of currency and trade zones that'll keep the real economies going in those
[1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:55.480]  places they have all the natural resources they require for that among
[1:13:55.480 --> 1:14:00.040]  them Russia has the the mineral resources Russia has the world's largest
[1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:04.720]  reserves of natural gas it has pipeline building capacities to China and so forth
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:11.640]  and Western Europe has the machine tools the advanced industry and and and that
[1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:16.120]  not but they lack the the labor base they lack the the demographic crisis in
[1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:20.480]  Germany and so forth it's beginning to kick in so if you combine that into a
[1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:24.880]  common economic space that is the one threat that the United States elites
[1:14:24.880 --> 1:14:30.160]  the American century if you want to call it simply can't cope with that
[1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:34.400]  Brazilian Brzezinski has said it repeatedly in his writings this is the
[1:14:34.400 --> 1:14:40.440]  number one threat the whole Cheney Pentagon agenda since he was Defense
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:46.160]  Secretary in 1992 has been about preempting preemptive wars are nothing
[1:14:46.160 --> 1:14:50.480]  more or less than preempting this kind of cooperation Eurasia so the book
[1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:56.680]  really is about that agenda and how unbeknownst to most most people certainly
[1:14:56.680 --> 1:15:01.440]  in Europe and in the United States because our media simply doesn't tell us
[1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:06.320]  in detail and certainly not our politicians the Pentagon has never
[1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:12.720]  stopped the Cold War it never for one second paused in its move to have total
[1:15:12.720 --> 1:15:19.880]  military dominance cyberspace outer space interspace the oceans the land and so
[1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:24.800]  forth and that is the Bush presidency and now it's being continued into Bush
[1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:29.440]  Mach 2 which is called Obama for some reason the Bush presidency is really
[1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:34.640]  about this carrying up this full spectrum dominance because they realized I
[1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:40.840]  think back in the 99 2000 period when the dot-com bubble was was pumped up and
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:45.320]  and inevitably crashed that they didn't have many more cards to play on the
[1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:50.880]  financial field and therefore they're going to have to turn to very hard
[1:15:50.880 --> 1:15:56.320]  military means so well doesn't this I mean doesn't this take us back to what
[1:15:56.320 --> 1:16:03.360]  we saw in the late 40s with the British Commission on population they say the
[1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:07.280]  Western world the US and England predominantly the Anglo-American elite
[1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:14.080]  are threatened by other populations developing their own industrial basis so
[1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:16.960]  we have to go around the world destabilizing nations getting them to
[1:16:16.960 --> 1:16:21.280]  have local theater wars I mean basically more you know great game
[1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:27.400]  geopolitical type stuff and and then they expanded they said carrying out
[1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:32.160]  eugenics but then domestically they say we've also got a done our own people
[1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:35.760]  down I mean this is in the documents that dumbing us down so we're more
[1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:42.080]  easily managed that that attacking and starving other nations playing them off
[1:16:42.080 --> 1:16:45.760]  against each other I mean this is really the policy and if you look at it
[1:16:45.760 --> 1:16:50.960]  from a cold-blooded military policy of you're the elites how do you dominate
[1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:54.640]  the world dividing conquer well I mean they might as well have us born without
[1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:58.440]  brains and you know I hate to give my ideas but but I mean that's what they're
[1:16:58.440 --> 1:17:03.920]  cold-bloodedly doing so so this really is the full spectrum dominance is
[1:17:03.920 --> 1:17:09.080]  control freaks on steroids micromanaging every facet of our lives I mean we
[1:17:09.080 --> 1:17:12.720]  can't act like the Pentagon is separately over here by itself doing all
[1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:16.840]  of this they work for the big Anglo-American banks and and and they're
[1:17:16.840 --> 1:17:19.600]  and they're given their marching orders and that is dominate the American
[1:17:19.600 --> 1:17:23.080]  people dominate the British people dominate the people of Europe who don't
[1:17:23.080 --> 1:17:28.080]  want to do this that's basically in slave everybody and then start wars all
[1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:31.800]  over the planet to wreck everything so there's nothing viable but you're one
[1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:36.920]  unipolar system yeah now that's in a nutshell that's what the the full
[1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:41.800]  spectrum book is documenting and putting it in a context where people can
[1:17:41.800 --> 1:17:47.200]  really understand a lot of these things that for example the the Darfur
[1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:52.640]  campaign is to take one one small example suddenly Hollywood actors start
[1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:57.040]  lining up to to be the great champions against the Sudanese genocide in
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:01.360]  Darfur southern Sudan and nobody tells them that the reason that the Bush
[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:05.480]  administration or Washington is talking about genocide in southern Sudan is
[1:18:05.480 --> 1:18:11.040]  because China has built oil pipelines to one of the richest oil potentials in
[1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:16.200]  all of Africa in the Darfur region all right stay there we'll be right back

[1:22:53.200 --> 1:22:58.200]  link to his website up on info wars.com right now
[1:22:58.200 --> 1:23:03.000]  William you know Dick Cheney comes out of the weekend and says look of course the
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:06.720]  president's above Congress and above the law he can nuke the entire earth if he
[1:23:06.720 --> 1:23:11.000]  wants to so they keep going back to this military power last year the British
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  Ministry of Defense said you know what the military really does work for
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:24.520]  financial interest and we may have to use neutron bombs on the general public
[1:23:24.520 --> 1:23:28.240]  if they try to get out of line or overthrow our government so within the
[1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:33.520]  officer corps it's even taught now that that they work for financial interest in
[1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:37.320]  our countries are basically gone and that it is tyranny and that tortures
[1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:42.840]  good and that secret arrest is good and that we're moving into a very dark phase
[1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:48.280]  of life and I guess these guys just enjoy the power where do you see all
[1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:55.760]  this going well certainly in terms of the US the military the Nordcom redeployments
[1:23:55.760 --> 1:24:03.200]  in in the last months toward domestic deployments and the building that up
[1:24:03.200 --> 1:24:07.280]  with with thousands of troops inside the United States is something that we
[1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:12.200]  haven't seen since the the bonus army march where the great hero general
[1:24:12.200 --> 1:24:16.240]  Douglas MacArthur started shooting on innocent women and children who were
[1:24:16.240 --> 1:24:21.440]  and veterans who were demanding payment during the depression of their World
[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:26.400]  War one bonuses on an early basis so they could feed their families and MacArthur
[1:24:26.400 --> 1:24:31.120]  comes in and starts wildly shooting they did that one on a technicality to get
[1:24:31.120 --> 1:24:35.560]  around popsicle metatus but what's happening now they just not even
[1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:40.600]  thinking about wasn't wasn't wasn't patent involved in that too patent was
[1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:46.240]  involved he was a he was a not yet a general but I think he was a captain or
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:51.360]  a major and he was involved in the in the blasting only say that because look
[1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:56.200]  how they paid him back when the Russians out of a US grabbed a bunch of US troops
[1:24:56.200 --> 1:25:00.080]  out of a German camp and he wanted them back and the Russians said no he threw a
[1:25:00.080 --> 1:25:05.240]  fit so you did you know the London telegraph is now reporting that yes I
[1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:09.880]  saw that this is quite interesting well my point is that's how he gets repaid
[1:25:09.880 --> 1:25:14.400]  yeah yeah I mean for all these guys that think it's cute and funny to kill US
[1:25:14.400 --> 1:25:20.280]  citizens and fun to ride down women and children look how it it it ends up there
[1:25:20.280 --> 1:25:24.960]  is no honor among thieves that's certainly true nothing personal just
[1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:30.440]  business absolutely up so so their master plan bottom line what are they
[1:25:30.440 --> 1:25:36.720]  shooting for what are they going to try to do well I think the old as I said at
[1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:41.040]  the beginning of the show Alex the only option that they have at this point is to
[1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:47.440]  use the mailed fist to take off the velvet glove and just try to project in
[1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:52.440]  in an economy that's going down the tubes they're in a very very shaky basis
[1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:58.440]  to do this but they you know these are people on the Titanic who simply
[1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:03.000]  fooled them the torpedoes full speed ahead kind of mentality and I don't
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:08.080]  think they're psychologically capable of recalibrating that the entire model
[1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:12.720]  that they built the American century on from 1939 is fundamentally flawed and
[1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:17.960]  they have to redesign the thing and and project a more modest profile in the
[1:26:17.960 --> 1:26:22.480]  world well what was the shift I mean we know that Biden and and and Obama are
[1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:26.960]  going to continue the same policies they're just puppets of the system but
[1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:33.600]  yeah but you know when Dick Cheney starts coming out and and you know
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:37.600]  talking about basically being God or when Hayden comes out and says the
[1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:41.680]  Fourth Amendment does not say we need to you know any due process or any
[1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:46.760]  probable cause entire war yeah but he's he's he's saying he says it doesn't
[1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:51.880]  even say that in the Fourth Amendment hmm I mean so we're seeing I mean we know
[1:26:51.880 --> 1:26:56.800]  they're not delusional but they believe I don't I don't know I'm not gonna swear
[1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:02.280]  that Alex I who knows what kind of a heart medication that Cheney is on and
[1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:08.080]  how it affects his mind well I mean we I mean we do remember Roe telling the
[1:27:08.080 --> 1:27:13.480]  Washington Post that we are history's actors you know that we control history
[1:27:13.480 --> 1:27:20.800]  and so that what everybody else says or thinks doesn't matter only we matter so
[1:27:20.800 --> 1:27:25.880]  there's definitely megalomania going on the point I'm making is that it when
[1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:33.080]  Hayden tells people the Fourth Amendment does not say probable cause when it does
[1:27:33.080 --> 1:27:38.800]  say probable cause that is a contempt yes well that they have nothing but
[1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:45.880]  contempt for any kind of constitutional procedure it's just it's they're in a
[1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:49.440]  they're in a domain where the world is moved beyond that for them and they're
[1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:56.120]  just you know power is the only language that the council in Washington and the
[1:27:56.120 --> 1:28:00.680]  final equation of that is forget your home forget your family forget your
[1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:05.760]  free market forget your future we have nukes we have militarized police shut up
[1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:12.520]  we're taking over we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[1:31:32.440 --> 1:31:39.880]  author researcher historian William Engdahl is our guest we're open the phones
[1:31:39.880 --> 1:31:47.600]  up here in about 10 minutes at 1-800-259-9231 it is the 22nd day of
[1:31:47.600 --> 1:31:53.920]  December 2008 is to program note I am getting over a stomach virus of some
[1:31:53.920 --> 1:31:58.400]  horrid type so I sound a little bit out of it today or different that is the
[1:31:58.400 --> 1:32:06.240]  reason mr. Engdahl continuing look I mean you're an expert on this you study
[1:32:06.240 --> 1:32:11.520]  this all the time I study it continually my audience does and I guess more and
[1:32:11.520 --> 1:32:16.760]  more of the solution you know to this whole problem is just historically
[1:32:16.760 --> 1:32:23.120]  looking at what happens when you get power tripping elites under control but
[1:32:23.120 --> 1:32:27.600]  nowhere in history did they have nuclear weapons or biological weapons to this
[1:32:27.600 --> 1:32:35.280]  extent and it's just every parallel every every scenario I look at it goes
[1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:41.200]  from bad to worse first specifically I mean I know you understand this is a
[1:32:41.200 --> 1:32:46.760]  controlled economic consolidation this is a military financial attack a strike
[1:32:46.760 --> 1:32:51.520]  on the middle class of the world but also on Russia and China and the Middle
[1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:57.160]  East to destroy their fledgling economies and again even the so-called
[1:32:57.160 --> 1:33:01.080]  elites of this country are tied in financially with these other nations
[1:33:01.080 --> 1:33:09.000]  isn't this a super class or super elite at the top of the elite who are really
[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:14.040]  bringing us towards the precipice and if you really analyze it it's not even for
[1:33:14.040 --> 1:33:18.800]  their interest long term but they just are hyper aggressive and so they can't
[1:33:18.800 --> 1:33:24.360]  help it I would answer that yes and no there is a super elite the so-called
[1:33:24.360 --> 1:33:30.280]  Davos consensus I hate that term but I've been to Davos nine times and I know
[1:33:30.280 --> 1:33:34.560]  what the consensus is or isn't around this but the idea of this globalization
[1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:39.200]  well that was the project and it tied in the top elites of Europe the top elites
[1:33:39.200 --> 1:33:46.280]  of Japan the top elites of many nations of world Brazil Mexico and so forth but
[1:33:46.280 --> 1:33:51.200]  there was a center of gravity to the project and now the thing has come to a
[1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:55.480]  point where where that that whole process is breaking down and it's not
[1:33:55.480 --> 1:34:02.160]  under control you know that the best-laid plans you can't control every
[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:06.280]  single thing and every single bean on the entire planet either you're gonna
[1:34:06.280 --> 1:34:12.760]  blow up the whole planet through nukes or through biological catastrophe or
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:18.120]  whatever or you're gonna come a cropper one way or the other they're just it
[1:34:18.120 --> 1:34:24.000]  the world is not responsive to computer programmed war scenarios no no I
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:28.080]  understand that I'm saying specifically from memory the last time you're on
[1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:33.040]  with us about them trying to control to consolidate power the financial crisis I
[1:34:33.040 --> 1:34:38.080]  agree they don't control what happens militarily and and also financially I
[1:34:38.080 --> 1:34:45.720]  don't I don't think we're in such a centrally controlled breakdown crisis
[1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:50.480]  that that they're gonna re regroup and so forth I think the thing is really
[1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:54.120]  gotten out of control of Paulson and and his Goldman Sachs cronies in the
[1:34:54.120 --> 1:34:58.840]  Treasury Department and certainly Bernanke when he ramps interest rates
[1:34:58.840 --> 1:35:03.680]  down to zero and desperately tries to you know pump liquidity into the system
[1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:06.880]  and keep the thing going it's not I understand but it was their nature to
[1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:10.200]  create the derivatives bubble so they could buy up real assets it was their
[1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:14.880]  nature we know banks like to control these implosions engineer them to
[1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:19.720]  consolidate but I agree that the greed is so great that it may be now falling
[1:35:19.720 --> 1:35:23.760]  apart some people want to say that the whole made-off thing is a conspiracy and
[1:35:23.760 --> 1:35:27.520]  it may be that at the end of the day so his sons and the rest of his company
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:31.040]  wouldn't go under he blew the whistle on himself I mean clearly he wasn't
[1:35:31.040 --> 1:35:35.960]  running this fifty to hundred billion dollar scam by himself but but just the
[1:35:35.960 --> 1:35:39.680]  fact that the former the founder of the Nasdaq and the former head of the
[1:35:39.680 --> 1:35:43.680]  Nasdaq would be you know now in so much trouble and people saying they never
[1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:48.360]  heard of him I mean that gives us an idea of this criminal class well Alex I see
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:53.840]  it the mad off thing is really the the symbol of the entire Wall Street dollar
[1:35:53.840 --> 1:35:59.720]  system is a giant Ponzi scheme and that's that's what it depends on sucking
[1:35:59.720 --> 1:36:04.240]  ever more volumes of money into the system and now the music stopped it
[1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:08.120]  stopped with the layman brothers decision to let it go under in the middle of
[1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:14.600]  September and that really has triggered unintended consequences I think and the
[1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:18.720]  way I see different national governments reacting in Europe and so forth
[1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:23.560]  they even the European Union which a lot of people thought was the unit of
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:27.280]  action in Europe is no longer the center of things it's it's national
[1:36:27.280 --> 1:36:31.040]  governments they said okay we've got to save our own behind here and we're
[1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:35.080]  facing elections next year not the bureaucrats in Brussels who are
[1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:39.240]  unelected so we got to do something to make sure the voter basis is at least
[1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:44.440]  halfway with us and that we don't have that problem here because they can
[1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:47.440]  control the two parties at such an extent and also have their voting machines
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:51.120]  that that part of the equation worrying about the voters doesn't matter yeah
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:56.000]  yeah well it's fortunately it's not quite that advanced in Europe yeah so we
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:59.600]  don't have total global full spectrum dominance and now now full spectrum
[1:36:59.600 --> 1:37:04.120]  dominance goes into everything I mean everything yeah yeah and now I think
[1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:07.960]  you're gonna see the the emphasis shift from the financial dominance to the
[1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:12.840]  military in order to get the financial back under control control world money
[1:37:12.840 --> 1:37:16.840]  you control the world and we've seen Obama say we're gonna I mean you think a
[1:37:16.840 --> 1:37:20.360]  trillion plus is a big defense budget how about how about a trillion and a
[1:37:20.360 --> 1:37:26.200]  half how about two trillion yeah yeah yeah well look at look at the fact that
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:30.840]  he renominated Robert Gates to be defense secretary and that says Robert
[1:37:30.840 --> 1:37:35.880]  Gates has spent most of his adult life as a house servant of the Bush dynasty I
[1:37:35.880 --> 1:37:42.360]  mean that says pretty much right there well you know Cheney's on TV making
[1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:46.560]  fun of Obama and Biden and that's the headline meanwhile they're groveling and
[1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:49.600]  and saying that they're gonna protect him and make sure he doesn't get any
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:55.520]  trouble regardless what you think of Obama or Biden I mean that shows that
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:38:00.680]  they know who the real power is yeah yeah yeah well there's just such an
[1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:05.880]  unbridled arrogance that's coming out of Washington it's it's it would be
[1:38:05.880 --> 1:38:10.640]  laughable if it if it weren't these people still have some hands on the
[1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:17.880]  levers of power and I guess the military men at the at the high levels they
[1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:24.400]  like it too but but you know it was too much for too much for Fox Fallon though
[1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:32.200]  the they had a cent come at the time when they wanted him to attack US ships
[1:38:32.200 --> 1:38:36.960]  with Navy SEALs he did resign over that we now know so at least some of them up
[1:38:36.960 --> 1:38:41.440]  there don't you know don't like staging terror attacks or or or maybe he didn't
[1:38:41.440 --> 1:38:46.320]  mind a terror attack maybe he didn't want to start World War three whatever
[1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:51.960]  yeah he certainly made clear that he wasn't on the on the program of Cheney's
[1:38:51.960 --> 1:38:58.680]  to launch a nuclear strike on Iran well I can throw out a lot of questions at you
[1:38:58.680 --> 1:39:04.040]  but other things that are on your minds as we talked a few months ago that you
[1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:10.680]  think are most important well I think the of course now much of the intelligent
[1:39:10.680 --> 1:39:14.720]  world has woken up to the fact that there is no regime change that's taken
[1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:19.160]  place with the US November elections that it's simply continuity of government
[1:39:19.160 --> 1:39:23.440]  continuity of the elites power behind the scene the permanent institutions I
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:27.560]  don't think we need to dwell on that that's really so obvious by now in the
[1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:35.000]  appointments that president elect Obama has made the the financial
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:40.960]  disintegration that's taking place at the spillover into the into the real
[1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:46.800]  economy is something I'd like to share a few thoughts with you on this because
[1:39:46.800 --> 1:39:51.200]  I've been looking at this closely over the last days it's an element that very
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:55.800]  few people have begun to speak up about openly in connection with the
[1:39:55.800 --> 1:40:01.440]  crisis and that is the dramatic demographic shift that's about to
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:07.320]  take place it's about to kick in 2011 2013 in that time period and that is
[1:40:07.320 --> 1:40:12.760]  that the baby boomer generation the generation that was born after the war
[1:40:12.760 --> 1:40:18.560]  beginning 45 46 however you want to date it but reached its peak around 65 that
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:24.240]  generation in about two years is going to come big time into retirement and
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:30.640]  this this is the generation that has allowed the financial boom of the post
[1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:37.040]  1982 period in in the US to be created on Wall Street it's made an industry out
[1:40:37.040 --> 1:40:42.240]  of the mutual funds with 401ks and all sorts of other savings for retirement
[1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:47.520]  because they were coming into their peak earning years the kids had gone to
[1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:50.880]  college and they had their home paid down most of them this is I'm talking
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:55.840]  about middle-class America this is the investor class yeah and you know the
[1:40:55.840 --> 1:41:01.200]  small private investor that's been the the lifeblood of Wall Street and now
[1:41:01.200 --> 1:41:07.080]  not only has the stock market tanked in the in the last months and to half its
[1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:10.400]  value at the beginning of the year it's going to tank a lot further as the
[1:41:10.400 --> 1:41:15.880]  economic crisis gets worse but the fact is now this generation is coming big
[1:41:15.880 --> 1:41:19.320]  time into retirement and right as they do they're not gonna have their money
[1:41:19.320 --> 1:41:23.080]  well they have to live off there for what they have to cash in so they're
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:29.160]  gonna cash in in a falling stock market a bond market and so forth and hyper
[1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:34.840]  inflation is on the cards for perhaps in nine twelve months at the rate that the
[1:41:34.840 --> 1:41:38.760]  Fed is is monetizing but William I mean that's it notice how this happened right
[1:41:38.760 --> 1:41:44.360]  in time for the moment they were about to cash in on their retirements and we
[1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:48.240]  have the cities the counties the states have all been investing in the secret
[1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:52.600]  double set of books the comprehensive annual financial reports you know about
[1:41:52.600 --> 1:41:56.800]  those right no I'm not familiar with that well see there's a there's a double set
[1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:01.040]  of books and so I'm saying from the evidence I have this is a planned
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:06.120]  swindle by these ruthless people to make sure the baby boomers don't get their
[1:42:06.120 --> 1:42:11.080]  money but continue with your thought okay well what the point the point that I
[1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:16.720]  was making is that people talk about a one or two year recession Nouriel
[1:42:16.720 --> 1:42:23.320]  Roubini who's got quite a following in the in the economic domain in recent
[1:42:23.320 --> 1:42:28.320]  months is talking about a five percent peak to trough dip in the recession I
[1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:33.920]  think this is just a rosy eyed optimism to the extreme we're gonna have a
[1:42:33.920 --> 1:42:37.760]  depression in the United States is gonna exceed anything we saw during the
[1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:43.680]  1930s it's gonna be categorized as a very great depression VGD and not just
[1:42:43.680 --> 1:42:47.960]  great depression by future economists if there any left around to calculate this
[1:42:47.960 --> 1:42:55.080]  and this 401 this baby boom retirement factor is gonna be the the thing that's
[1:42:55.080 --> 1:43:01.880]  gonna kick it into at least I see as a under most optimistic scenario a ten
[1:43:01.880 --> 1:43:08.720]  year process of depression in the US economy I don't see any any new blood
[1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:13.840]  coming into into the credit system that's gonna boost it up so in that
[1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:18.920]  environment I think the military option is going to be the option of last
[1:43:18.920 --> 1:43:26.320]  resort for the for the US power elites they will see no other no other chance
[1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:30.280]  now for those that don't understand history mr. Engel explained to them why
[1:43:30.280 --> 1:43:34.760]  in a bad economy there is a military option what the social architects
[1:43:34.760 --> 1:43:38.800]  believe that will do enough of the public but for themselves have people rally
[1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:44.320]  around the government around the flag as painful things happen at home further
[1:43:44.320 --> 1:43:52.520]  consolidate power create a create a growth sector in the economy well let's
[1:43:52.520 --> 1:43:58.040]  take the the best example for most Americans who are over 60 the great
[1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:05.600]  depression ended when Roosevelt began secretly at first letting contracts
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:10.000]  Pentagon contracts were the buildup for a coming war with with Germany and
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:16.760]  Japan which after 1939 after 41 rather after Pearl Harbor was called World War
[1:44:16.760 --> 1:44:26.480]  2 and it was that military spending huge military spending that brought the US
[1:44:26.480 --> 1:44:30.600]  out of the great depression but the military spending was by the government
[1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:35.480]  which had never been done on that scale before in American history and why was
[1:44:35.480 --> 1:44:40.800]  that an economic positive well it wasn't an economic positive because bombs and
[1:44:40.800 --> 1:44:49.080]  and jet airplanes and B-52s or whatever the bees were in those days are socially
[1:44:49.080 --> 1:44:54.360]  unproductive there they're a net minus on the war ended that those factories
[1:44:54.360 --> 1:44:59.680]  could now make our point yeah that's the point Alex when the war ended not only
[1:44:59.680 --> 1:45:05.200]  US factories were the state-of-the-art in the world production capacity all of
[1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:10.160]  Europe was a rubble heap Japan was bomb the smithereens nuclear and otherwise
[1:45:10.160 --> 1:45:17.000]  and the US had no rival on the planet that that could Russia had lost or the
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:23.040]  Soviet Union had lost 23 million of its prime youth in the slaughter there in
[1:45:23.040 --> 1:45:30.360]  Europe trying to defeat Nazi Germany and you a Roosevelt and after his death
[1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:34.600]  Truman and Churchill simply chuckled up their sleeve and and said well look
[1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:38.960]  they've slaughtered each other and now the US was in a position to declare what
[1:45:38.960 --> 1:45:45.560]  Henry Luce said in 1941 triumphally this is the dawn of the American century now
[1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:51.920]  think about that a minute what they knew was they had all of the world's monetary
[1:45:51.920 --> 1:45:58.680]  gold in Fort Knox or in the New York Federal Reserve vaults they had intact
[1:45:58.680 --> 1:46:05.520]  the production facilities they had the aluminum production they had the
[1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:08.880]  hydroelectric power in the Northwest that they built through the Great
[1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:14.800]  Depression on slave labor wages through public works programs and now the
[1:46:14.800 --> 1:46:19.240]  United States was in a in a position the United States elites led by the
[1:46:19.240 --> 1:46:25.760]  Rockefeller family back then David John D the third Nelson and Lawrence
[1:46:25.760 --> 1:46:32.320]  Rockefeller they were in a position literally to dominate the the entire
[1:46:32.320 --> 1:46:38.720]  world and that's the that's the kind of thinking that these elites have I'm
[1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:43.600]  convinced that that's what they're mulling around how they can do that how
[1:46:43.600 --> 1:46:48.360]  they can systematically defying the one nuclear power on the planet that can
[1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:52.400]  offer them a challenge and that's Russia as bankrupt as Russia is I was in
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:58.440]  Russia recently and I saw you have new cars everywhere in Moscow but you have
[1:46:58.440 --> 1:47:02.320]  20 million people living in an overcrowded condition in that city it's
[1:47:02.320 --> 1:47:07.480]  going to take at least 10 years for the social situation to stabilize in Russia
[1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:11.920]  under the best of conditions and now they have a collapsed energy price oil
[1:47:11.920 --> 1:47:19.880]  down in the in the 40s instead of over a hundred so this is it's going to be a
[1:47:19.880 --> 1:47:24.640]  very very dicey time for the entire world in the next month and I think if I
[1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:30.240]  want to leave your your listeners with one message is to see the reality of
[1:47:30.240 --> 1:47:33.320]  what's coming and not try to have illusions that there's going to be a
[1:47:33.320 --> 1:47:39.400]  one or two year post-war typical recession and that somehow Obama's going
[1:47:39.400 --> 1:47:46.600]  to have a kinder and and gentler America and and this and the other thing this is
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:55.440]  a an imperial system in desperation in irreversible decline the system is not
[1:47:55.440 --> 1:48:01.840]  not the people the people are the victims of the system but they they can't
[1:48:01.840 --> 1:48:04.960]  it's it's like the Roadrunner cartoons they're running off the cliff and they
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:13.080]  can't do anything to slow the legs down so 2009 is going to be as the Chinese
[1:48:13.080 --> 1:48:19.320]  say a very interesting year I agree with you we're gonna come back and this
[1:48:19.320 --> 1:48:24.520]  segment one other and take phone calls from Maggie Eric Tracy Don and Paul but
[1:48:24.520 --> 1:48:30.960]  when do you see the crises peaking somewhere out in 12,014 or so or this is
[1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:37.080]  so big such a massive shift somewhere in that in that ballpark between 12 and
[1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:47.000]  14 2012 2014 it's a this is this is going to really be a long drag I know the
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.400]  establishment is seems very pleased with all of us that you know they're gonna
[1:48:51.400 --> 1:48:55.200]  love the domestic police state they're gonna voice through on this I mean they've
[1:48:55.200 --> 1:49:01.680]  spent decades William setting all this up repairing all their preparations right
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:07.800]  on time for this moment I know it's by design I know it's been engineered and
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:14.120]  they have wrought something that is just absolutely horrific all right we'll be

[1:52:44.840 --> 1:52:50.240]  the night well the goodness is the establishment at least had to give us a
[1:52:50.240 --> 1:52:54.920]  fake savior like Obama they at least nodded towards the fact that they need
[1:52:54.920 --> 1:53:03.160]  the public fooled but it isn't working I'm jamming some calls here but William
[1:53:03.160 --> 1:53:11.200]  you know the point I was just thinking of I mean Obama could have appointed
[1:53:11.200 --> 1:53:18.720]  insiders who weren't well-known retreads again it shows an innate disdain for the
[1:53:18.720 --> 1:53:26.200]  public by the establishment sure sure a contempt deep down they have nothing
[1:53:26.200 --> 1:53:31.360]  but contempt for us normal people I think that's their fundamental weakness as
[1:53:31.360 --> 1:53:35.560]  well this isn't an aristocracy of excellence this is a degenerate
[1:53:35.560 --> 1:53:44.080]  paranoid elite that really belongs in in the cycle psychiatric care and not in
[1:53:44.080 --> 1:53:50.880]  government well they're gonna but I guess that's the Norman history to have
[1:53:50.880 --> 1:53:54.880]  nuts in control I mean that's what normally happens so that's the that
[1:53:54.880 --> 1:53:58.880]  that's the nature normal people don't want the power Maggie in Texas you're on
[1:53:58.880 --> 1:54:04.240]  the air with our guests go ahead oh hi Alex I got in line before your guests
[1:54:04.240 --> 1:54:09.760]  came on I understand go ahead okay I wanted to so my comment is a bit of
[1:54:09.760 --> 1:54:13.400]  topic but I would listen let me just tell you and everybody else something we
[1:54:13.400 --> 1:54:17.480]  don't screen the phone calls and so unless I specifically say it just for
[1:54:17.480 --> 1:54:26.120]  the guest it's fine yeah I would like to plug my new blog on fluoride and it is
[1:54:26.120 --> 1:54:37.560]  it is at www.fluoridefreeaustin01word.com and you guys are fighting to get
[1:54:37.560 --> 1:54:40.920]  fluoride removed out of the water here locally right well there are several
[1:54:40.920 --> 1:54:45.400]  different people working on it from several different angles I'm not the
[1:54:45.400 --> 1:54:49.160]  only one this is my particular contribution no I understand I'm saying
[1:54:49.160 --> 1:54:53.000]  there's an Austin movement yes yes there are there are a bunch of people and in
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:55:01.040]  fact one of them is under the umbrella of freedom force and John Bush whom you
[1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:06.040]  know is leading that is is deeply involved in that and there is another
[1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:11.520]  group our person somewhere who is also using the name fluoride free Austin and
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:17.080]  in fact I will I will admit that he had it first but he is doing it through my
[1:55:17.080 --> 1:55:20.800]  space you know I think activists should worry less about who's doing what first
[1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:25.000]  and right I'm not getting the fluoride out you know right the more people the
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:29.600]  more people the better and yes I will work with anybody who's interested in
[1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:33.960]  this subject this is my particular contribution and I'm going to be doing
[1:55:33.960 --> 1:55:38.160]  some reporting on that bug and I've been talking in front of the Austin City
[1:55:38.160 --> 1:55:43.040]  Council and recording my little lecture Maggie you keep it up we got to go
[1:55:43.040 --> 1:55:48.120]  because the segments over but William what about that subject what is the
[1:55:48.120 --> 1:55:52.680]  establishment going to do as the public becomes educated say on GMO foods and
[1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:57.480]  stops eating them and then the free market dictates then that we want
[1:55:57.480 --> 1:56:02.040]  organic what are they going to do as people find out about mercury in the
[1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:05.200]  vaccines or fluoride in the water and demand it out what are they going to do
[1:56:05.200 --> 1:56:09.000]  is the public just says no but but but the establishment wants to continue to
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:16.800]  carry out it's forced medication of the public well I think that's that's up for
[1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:21.560]  grabs and no one can predict when a population realizes how brutally they
[1:56:21.560 --> 1:56:26.400]  have been abused by the so-called misnamed health care that they've been
[1:56:26.400 --> 1:56:31.720]  given through the traditional mainstream hospitalization and the medical
[1:56:31.720 --> 1:56:36.680]  system in the last decades then they're gonna you're gonna have some pretty
[1:56:36.680 --> 1:56:42.360]  angry people and I saw a statistic recently that there are more people who
[1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:49.040]  die from mishandling mistakes in the hospital than die of cancer in the
[1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:53.560]  United States that's pretty frightening yeah 300,000 a year just from bad drug
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:57:02.160]  interactions stay there for one more segment thank you for listening to GCN
[1:57:02.160 --> 1:57:10.440]  visit GCN Live.com today a day unlike any other in the long course of American
[1:57:10.440 --> 1:57:15.560]  history a terrorist act of war against this country the enemy struck America on
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:21.080]  September 11th but who is the enemy Bin Laden this is his MO's we have to look
[1:57:21.080 --> 1:57:24.720]  to the Middle East we have to look to Osama bin Laden. Fabled enemies is the
[1:57:24.720 --> 1:57:28.520]  first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:32.720]  networks inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there are
[1:57:32.720 --> 1:57:38.480]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that
[1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:43.480]  some Israeli citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the
[1:57:43.480 --> 1:57:47.320]  hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli
[1:57:47.320 --> 1:57:51.200]  intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government and much much
[1:57:51.200 --> 1:57:56.480]  more. Fabled enemies get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high
[1:57:56.480 --> 1:58:01.200]  quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv either you
[1:58:01.200 --> 1:58:06.040]  are with us or you are with the terrorists
[1:58:06.040 --> 1:58:17.360]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:29.080]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:36.320]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[1:58:36.320 --> 1:58:46.400]  Alex Jones. Peter Schiff, financial expert, will be joining us coming up in about
[1:58:46.400 --> 1:58:51.240]  25 minutes. I'm gonna take your phone calls the next segment after our guest has
[1:58:51.240 --> 1:59:01.200]  left us so we can finish up with him. Going back to F. William Engdahl, William give
[1:59:01.200 --> 1:59:05.440]  folks your website tell them when your newest book is coming out and then I
[1:59:05.440 --> 1:59:09.360]  want to get into the other you know briefly other areas of full spectrum
[1:59:09.360 --> 1:59:13.200]  dominance. It's not just the military with the satellites and the face scanners
[1:59:13.200 --> 1:59:17.960]  going up worldwide to track everywhere we go in real time and you know full
[1:59:17.960 --> 1:59:23.280]  spectrum dominance the national ID cards to buy and sell set into a world ID
[1:59:23.280 --> 1:59:27.440]  system you know where the whole world's a prisonplanet. There's also other facets
[1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:34.320]  of full spectrum dominance and that's the medical but go ahead. Okay first of
[1:59:34.320 --> 1:59:46.160]  all the website is www.engdahl.oilgeopoliticsoneword.net
[1:59:46.160 --> 1:59:56.280]  my book the seeds of destruction the hidden agenda of genetic manipulation
[1:59:56.280 --> 2:00:04.320]  which is published by globalresearch.ca in Canada the in there I document the
[2:00:04.320 --> 2:00:12.200]  the second of three major control mechanisms of the post-war US elites
[2:00:12.200 --> 2:00:16.520]  you control the oil you control whole nations their economic growth rates and
[2:00:16.520 --> 2:00:22.400]  so forth you control food and you can control people. The third mean of course
[2:00:22.400 --> 2:00:27.080]  if you control money you control the whole world. The seeds of destruction was
[2:00:27.080 --> 2:00:30.720]  written from that standpoint there are a lot of books out there which talk about
[2:00:30.720 --> 2:00:39.080]  the the uncertainties of a diet of genetically modified soybeans or corn
[2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:45.680]  or whatever in our cattle feed and in our direct human consumption but what's
[2:00:45.680 --> 2:00:50.160]  lacking in the reason I wrote the book is the geopolitical background of this
[2:00:50.160 --> 2:00:54.040]  who financed this project in the beginning it didn't just pop out of thin
[2:00:54.040 --> 2:00:59.120]  air as a great advance of science it's based on absolutely wrong sciences
[2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:04.480]  based on reductionism upside down science I call it and it was designed
[2:01:04.480 --> 2:01:09.240]  and financed from the beginning back going to a project back in 1938 by the
[2:01:09.240 --> 2:01:13.440]  Rockefeller Foundation. Dr. Warren Weaver of the Rockefeller Foundation a
[2:01:13.440 --> 2:01:18.920]  physicist the atomic physicist said well let's apply the same concept as
[2:01:18.920 --> 2:01:24.000]  atomic physics to the field of biology and reduce life to a hard little ball of
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:29.560]  matter that we call a gene and these were dedicated passionate eugenicists the
[2:01:29.560 --> 2:01:33.480]  eugenicists are people who think you can build a master race in fact the same
[2:01:33.480 --> 2:01:38.600]  Rockefeller Foundation at that time was financing eugenics research in Nazi
[2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:42.200]  Germany. Yeah the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and others and literally every
[2:01:42.200 --> 2:01:47.160]  evil I find like putting mercury in vaccines or discovering how to you know
[2:01:47.160 --> 2:01:50.640]  that most cancer was viral and then putting it in vaccines and then owning
[2:01:50.640 --> 2:01:54.960]  the big cancer clinics and then literally controlling the whole industry and
[2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:59.720]  then even having fads you know studies in the 50s about how to make having
[2:01:59.720 --> 2:02:03.920]  cancer be part of the fad and then socializing it where it's a social event
[2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:07.880]  and the women go play and have fun while they die you know of cancer you know in
[2:02:07.880 --> 2:02:12.200]  the in the cancer ward and oh girl you've got it now too kind of how they may
[2:02:12.200 --> 2:02:17.440]  having AIDS fashionable I mean this is mass murder of the public of course it's
[2:02:17.440 --> 2:02:22.080]  unbelievable. You go back to the 1920s one of the first projects of the newly
[2:02:22.080 --> 2:02:26.480]  created Rockefeller Foundation which was a standard oil trust fortune at tax
[2:02:26.480 --> 2:02:31.880]  tax avoidance scheme for the Rockefeller fortune. They focused on
[2:02:31.880 --> 2:02:37.080]  education and especially on medical education in America. They closed down
[2:02:37.080 --> 2:02:41.880]  naturopathic clinics and hospitals all over the United States medical schools
[2:02:41.880 --> 2:02:47.080]  and allowed only those who followed the agenda the vaccination agenda and
[2:02:47.080 --> 2:02:53.720]  otherwise of the Rockefeller Foundation Rockefeller University for medical
[2:02:53.720 --> 2:02:59.760]  research and so forth and that define the entire field of how modern medicine
[2:02:59.760 --> 2:03:03.720]  is applied. That's how they take control they they take over industries and then
[2:03:03.720 --> 2:03:08.960]  the profits flow but it's really all about the control. Fire out the website
[2:03:08.960 --> 2:03:17.560]  sir www.engdahl.oilgeopolitics.net. All right sir good to hear from you.
[2:03:17.560 --> 2:03:21.720]  Hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[2:03:21.720 --> 2:03:25.000]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever. We need to be
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:28.560]  independent and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a
[2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:31.840]  red line if you have your own bread. You'll never have to go to the Super
[2:03:31.840 --> 2:03:35.680]  Dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:39.000]  simply prepare. Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bail
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:42.560]  out of a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it. They
[2:03:42.560 --> 2:03:46.880]  turned off the telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at
[2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:51.160]  least out of thin air. This money now owns the America and European banks. The
[2:03:51.160 --> 2:03:54.960]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[2:03:54.960 --> 2:03:59.000]  nothing and blast the cost of assassins particularly food beyond many
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:03.240]  Americans reach. In pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of
[2:04:03.240 --> 2:04:07.480]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks. Food
[2:04:07.480 --> 2:04:11.240]  prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[2:04:11.240 --> 2:04:14.960]  sight. The private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[2:04:14.960 --> 2:04:18.240]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves. The stores have less
[2:04:18.240 --> 2:04:22.360]  food but jack of prices to stay in business. Whatever happens in America we
[2:04:22.360 --> 2:04:25.920]  need to be prepared and be ready. Everything is zeroing in on food one
[2:04:25.920 --> 2:04:28.960]  third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other
[2:04:28.960 --> 2:04:33.480]  necessities. My friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get
[2:04:33.480 --> 2:04:36.320]  food. For everybody out there listening it's very important for you to
[2:04:36.320 --> 2:04:39.640]  understand that by having a supply of storable food the government the new old
[2:04:39.640 --> 2:04:43.480]  order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of
[2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:47.320]  self-sufficiency and preparedness. No one is gonna take care of your family in the
[2:04:47.320 --> 2:04:51.080]  final equation but you. You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship
[2:04:51.080 --> 2:04:55.200]  storable food that's safe from E. coli salmonella genetic alteration or Chinese
[2:04:55.200 --> 2:04:58.880]  imports and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.

[2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:52.520]  year a brookie light that's a great system you know how are you doing with
[2:09:52.520 --> 2:09:56.440]  the horrible global warming up there is it tropical in Connecticut right now or
[2:09:56.440 --> 2:10:00.720]  or are you experiencing the coldest temperatures in more than 20 years it's
[2:10:00.720 --> 2:10:04.480]  like I was you know I was looking forward to being able to open my pool up in
[2:10:04.480 --> 2:10:08.320]  January but I can't do that because it's like 20 degrees outside well listen if
[2:10:08.320 --> 2:10:12.160]  you'll just don't worry about the GMO food killing everybody and don't worry
[2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:15.320]  about the bad drug you know interactions killing 300,000 a year and
[2:10:15.320 --> 2:10:18.560]  don't worry about all the toxic waste on the real environmental problems you can
[2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:23.400]  just pay a bunch of taxes to private bankers carbon indulgences and then
[2:10:23.400 --> 2:10:27.240]  everything will be okay how's that sound and you know Alex that sounds great
[2:10:27.240 --> 2:10:30.840]  and I think if I can pay them the more I'll be able to sleep a little better
[2:10:30.840 --> 2:10:36.320]  at night because you know they they work so hard trying to try to you know get
[2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:41.080]  us under their thumb well even if you believe that man-made carbon dioxide and
[2:10:41.080 --> 2:10:45.760]  methane from Cal's flatulence is destroying the ozone layer and heating
[2:10:45.760 --> 2:10:51.880]  the earth up which of course it's not why moving it to China and India where
[2:10:51.880 --> 2:10:55.320]  they have no restrictions and and actually increasing the level of
[2:10:55.320 --> 2:10:59.160]  carbon dioxide how is that actually going to cool the earth down I mean even
[2:10:59.160 --> 2:11:05.840]  if we believe their official story I was gonna say Alex if you read their
[2:11:05.840 --> 2:11:09.520]  studies I mean people don't believe it when I tell them at work I say all you
[2:11:09.520 --> 2:11:13.360]  need to do is go and research and read what these elites are saying they're
[2:11:13.360 --> 2:11:17.280]  going to do I mean they come basically they come right out but they're counting
[2:11:17.280 --> 2:11:21.440]  on the average American citizen to basically just sit down and watch TV and
[2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:24.040]  not even pay attention well that's because they knew people were lazy they
[2:11:24.040 --> 2:11:27.440]  told them in the 50s you don't worry about government anymore you don't be
[2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:31.560]  involved anymore trust the elites there's no such thing as corruption it
[2:11:31.560 --> 2:11:34.960]  doesn't exist and it's like telling somebody there's no such thing as cancer
[2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:39.640]  go ahead and smoke five packs of cigarettes a day and then now we've got cancer
[2:11:39.640 --> 2:11:45.560]  and they're going but there's no such thing they're like no there is pal
[2:11:45.560 --> 2:11:51.280]  they're like no I heard Al Qaeda talks like that I heard Al Qaeda said hold on
[2:11:51.280 --> 2:11:56.880]  you know it's shut up I mean basically if you think that there's any
[2:11:56.880 --> 2:12:00.680]  corruption in our government you're with Al Qaeda I mean imagine what the
[2:12:00.680 --> 2:12:05.640]  government's done oh and that denial is their greatest ally and that's what
[2:12:05.640 --> 2:12:10.080]  people need to realize that denial is their best friend because it prevents
[2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:14.120]  people from researching it prevents people from taking action it prevents
[2:12:14.120 --> 2:12:18.280]  people from waking up and that they can the elites can just sit back and rub
[2:12:18.280 --> 2:12:21.720]  their hands together and you can see it on TV I remember back in the 90s and
[2:12:21.720 --> 2:12:25.120]  earlier you had shows that would portray the government is questionable
[2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:30.440]  corrupt dubious evil now you look at a lot of these programs I saw
[2:12:30.440 --> 2:12:34.400]  preview for this program where I see nothing but these these heroes quote
[2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:37.880]  unquote running around in their little ninja outfits bustin door downs it's a
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:42.400]  program called homeland security you could have knocked me over with a feather
[2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:48.360]  when I saw that one homeland security USA yeah these shows are the USA you're
[2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:54.840]  not against the USA are you and I'm hearing you know I like the way Alan
[2:12:54.840 --> 2:12:58.320]  Stang puts a shallow Sean Hannits with they're talking about these concerts
[2:12:58.320 --> 2:13:01.800]  they go to where everybody has a tear in his eye because they're singing about
[2:13:01.800 --> 2:13:06.160]  the war on terror and everything else with all these country stars well don't
[2:13:06.160 --> 2:13:10.680]  they realize that greed greed has replaced common sense in this country
[2:13:10.680 --> 2:13:13.800]  we've lost our way in large well no I hear you and I appreciate your call
[2:13:13.800 --> 2:13:17.880]  what's happened is people bought into the delusion they bought into the
[2:13:17.880 --> 2:13:21.400]  Republican the Democratic illusion they've bought into that we're the good
[2:13:21.400 --> 2:13:26.560]  guys and we're gonna kill some Arabs and it's good and we're gonna take our
[2:13:26.560 --> 2:13:31.000]  liberty so Alcada didn't get them and they have no idea they've been completely
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:39.040]  set up oh yeah Hannity has these Pentagon worshipping events and then
[2:13:39.040 --> 2:13:43.560]  meanwhile the Pentagon is a foreign alien group destroying America it's like
[2:13:43.560 --> 2:13:47.560]  the main seat of the cancer for the Federal Reserve it's taking over the
[2:13:47.560 --> 2:13:50.720]  United States overthrowing our nation like it like some third-world country
[2:13:50.720 --> 2:13:55.640]  and then meanwhile there's country stars everybody crying playing you know
[2:13:55.640 --> 2:14:01.640]  proud to be an American at least I know I'm free and then they talk about how
[2:14:01.640 --> 2:14:05.160]  they're giving the money to the children who lost their family members in Iraq
[2:14:05.160 --> 2:14:10.520]  how about don't send them to Iraq how about don't kill a million and a half
[2:14:10.520 --> 2:14:17.760]  Iraqis in the last five and a half years it doesn't matter all these
[2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:20.480]  illusional people their times running out they're gonna find out what they've
[2:14:20.480 --> 2:14:25.200]  helped the new order to Don and Alabama no no actually Tracy's next Tracy and in
[2:14:25.200 --> 2:14:31.040]  Mexico you're on the air hello Alex Alex the last time I spoke with you was
[2:14:31.040 --> 2:14:38.600]  about seven years ago I've been listening to you since you on shortwave and one
[2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:44.080]  thing that has always remained the same with you listening to you talking about
[2:14:44.080 --> 2:14:49.680]  this is you bring us wonderful information information we couldn't get
[2:14:49.680 --> 2:14:55.920]  anywhere else unless we spend all our time doing it which we can't but you've
[2:14:55.920 --> 2:15:05.360]  never told us where we can go who we can talk to what we can do to bring this to
[2:15:05.360 --> 2:15:11.880]  us to a to a halt because everything you suggested so far doesn't work it's not
[2:15:11.880 --> 2:15:16.720]  gonna work it's not designed to work they've got us by the you know what and
[2:15:16.720 --> 2:15:22.320]  the only box left is the cartridge box I want to know if there's any groups
[2:15:22.320 --> 2:15:29.920]  anywhere that are preparing for this to stand up and defend themselves and they
[2:15:29.920 --> 2:15:35.880]  are I'd like to join and the time for talking is over the time for listening
[2:15:35.880 --> 2:15:41.800]  is over and the time for waking idiots up is over it's time for us to do
[2:15:41.800 --> 2:15:52.560]  something it has been for years those are my thoughts what are yours well look
[2:15:52.560 --> 2:15:59.720]  as things get worse more people are gonna wake up and listen to what we have
[2:15:59.720 --> 2:16:04.840]  to say and it's during the greatest crisis that it's the time for talking I
[2:16:04.840 --> 2:16:08.920]  mean that's why the establishment pays tens of billions of dollars a year alone
[2:16:08.920 --> 2:16:15.520]  domestically for fake newscasts disinformation fake bloggers so 90% of
[2:16:15.520 --> 2:16:20.120]  a war according to the Pentagon is info war they use deception and lies and
[2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:24.480]  deceit and fake patriotism we use the truth and true patriotism to counter them
[2:16:24.480 --> 2:16:28.080]  by number one pointing out they're not American they're anti-american they
[2:16:28.080 --> 2:16:33.400]  work for offshore banks who've stolen 8.5 trillion people say that now is not
[2:16:33.400 --> 2:16:36.160]  the time for talking well that's because you've been awake for decades
[2:16:36.160 --> 2:16:42.640]  probably and unfortunately so many people that know what's going on have
[2:16:42.640 --> 2:16:47.680]  decided to just pull their pull their antenna in and and and and not wake
[2:16:47.680 --> 2:16:52.720]  people up not being involved anymore and so I see the establishment staging
[2:16:52.720 --> 2:16:56.560]  terror attacks all the time to try to say that we're violent so they have a
[2:16:56.560 --> 2:17:00.400]  pretext to crack down on the public so I don't think violence is the answer and
[2:17:00.400 --> 2:17:03.880]  that the people I hear on the radio talking about violence they never seem
[2:17:03.880 --> 2:17:07.800]  to be getting trouble for calling for that that's because they're feds if I
[2:17:07.800 --> 2:17:12.640]  called for that I'd be arrested very very quickly so no we need to hear a lot
[2:17:12.640 --> 2:17:17.000]  more talk and a lot louder and we need to hear it right now does that answer
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:21.880]  your question so your answer to my question is you think I'm a fit no
[2:17:21.880 --> 2:17:25.080]  that's not what I just said I said on the radio sir stay there I'll talk to you
[2:17:25.080 --> 2:17:29.400]  when we get back gold it's like nothing else on earth from the Romans through the

[2:21:30.520 --> 2:21:38.040]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[2:21:38.040 --> 2:21:45.920]  look what I said Tracy from New Mexico was the people on the air always calling
[2:21:45.920 --> 2:21:52.600]  for physical war to kill judges one of them is Hal Turner turned out he is a
[2:21:52.600 --> 2:21:59.520]  FBI informant you know they catch these white supremacists all the time run by
[2:21:59.520 --> 2:22:03.680]  feds so what I said was and this is what's not fair with the audience
[2:22:03.680 --> 2:22:08.720]  people don't take what I say they take what they want to hear me say okay I
[2:22:08.720 --> 2:22:13.720]  didn't call you a fed what I said is to communicate with me you had to call in
[2:22:13.720 --> 2:22:19.080]  and say I think the time for talking is over and don't worry the time for
[2:22:19.080 --> 2:22:23.520]  talking may come soon enough and then it'll be time for people that have
[2:22:23.520 --> 2:22:27.040]  done all this talking about how they're not going to talk to actually get in a
[2:22:27.040 --> 2:22:32.000]  shooting war you know I'm not going to a FEMA camp I'm not turning my firearms
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:39.920]  in I'm not going along with the New World Order but I mean I'm a radio host
[2:22:39.920 --> 2:22:44.880]  and it's not my job to charge off like George Washington and get into a
[2:22:44.880 --> 2:22:50.000]  shooting war with the feds and I'm not saying you're doing this I'm saying I'm
[2:22:50.000 --> 2:22:56.320]  criticized a lot by people for being all talk well our talk has defeated hundreds
[2:22:56.320 --> 2:23:00.440]  and hundreds of bad pieces of legislation our talk has exposed a lot of bad
[2:23:00.440 --> 2:23:06.920]  things a talk a few weeks ago shot down at least for now a constitutional
[2:23:06.920 --> 2:23:14.520]  convention is Tracy still there yeah we're still in the shape we're in we're
[2:23:14.520 --> 2:23:18.720]  still facing what we're facing nothing's changed okay well you're the commander
[2:23:18.720 --> 2:23:22.960]  then I mean I mean Tracy who are you gonna shoot stop stop who okay who is
[2:23:22.960 --> 2:23:31.160]  Tracy in New Mexico gonna go out and blast I'm not exactly sure well don't
[2:23:31.160 --> 2:23:37.320]  look for me to tell you waking up waking up people isn't stopping this they
[2:23:37.320 --> 2:23:42.600]  don't care if we're awake they don't care for watching them as long as we
[2:23:42.600 --> 2:23:47.920]  don't try to stop them they'll continue to do what they're doing as long as all
[2:23:47.920 --> 2:23:53.360]  we do is talk about it find out things let me throw let me throw let me throw
[2:23:53.360 --> 2:23:59.840]  something out here to you the police arrested about 3,000 people actually a
[2:23:59.840 --> 2:24:05.760]  little bit more than 3,000 people in New York in 2004 at the RNC I was there
[2:24:05.760 --> 2:24:12.120]  peaceful people AP reporters radio reporters spectator reporters you know
[2:24:12.120 --> 2:24:18.200]  even conservatives they put them in a FEMA camp pure 57 I had the police come
[2:24:18.200 --> 2:24:22.200]  over and threaten to arrest me for just videotaping and across the street now
[2:24:22.200 --> 2:24:26.520]  nobody got in a shooting war with the police lawsuits were filed they lost
[2:24:26.520 --> 2:24:30.960]  over a thousand lawsuits hundreds of millions of dollars and now the New
[2:24:30.960 --> 2:24:35.040]  York police don't claim you to permit to March now they don't claim there's free
[2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:39.920]  speech zones and all over the country take Austin Austin police would arrest
[2:24:39.920 --> 2:24:44.800]  you back a decade ago if you protested anywhere without a permit now they don't
[2:24:44.800 --> 2:24:49.400]  because they lost a bunch of lawsuits now I mean that example right there are
[2:24:49.400 --> 2:24:53.080]  you saying it would have been better for people just to just to blast the police
[2:24:53.080 --> 2:24:57.960]  I mean I'm I'm trying to understand this well I'm trying to understand it
[2:24:57.960 --> 2:25:02.920]  myself after you've done all this but you're saying nothing's better
[2:25:02.920 --> 2:25:06.640]  the people search sir they're being forced to admit there's world government
[2:25:06.640 --> 2:25:12.720]  now Congress has a 9% approval rating right now the lowest it's ever been and
[2:25:12.720 --> 2:25:17.000]  so in a way you're right you're right the people are awake but still they go
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:20.640]  forward but they go forward with less and less support more and more leaks out
[2:25:20.640 --> 2:25:26.120]  when Dick Cheney wanted to blow up US ships and blame it on Iran the Admiral
[2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:32.800]  resigned and then suddenly it was leaked to New Yorker magazine we have friends
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:36.960]  in government as well we don't want to just randomly go pick some innocent cop
[2:25:36.960 --> 2:25:41.840]  out you know who's who's who's who's parked in a doughnut you know places
[2:25:41.840 --> 2:25:47.680]  parking lot and walk up and shoot him in the head three times well I guess all
[2:25:47.680 --> 2:25:52.240]  this talking and all this waking up is gonna stop them from doing what they're
[2:25:52.240 --> 2:25:58.720]  doing we're just they're gonna be afraid that we've found them out no sir when it
[2:25:58.720 --> 2:26:02.560]  comes to listen listen violence is probably inevitable down the road
[2:26:02.560 --> 2:26:07.360]  like you see in Greece underplaces but on a much wider scale but we need to have
[2:26:07.360 --> 2:26:14.440]  as many people awake as we can before it comes to that well I'll agree I mean I
[2:26:14.440 --> 2:26:18.760]  mean I mean certainly understand my position and my job is to hope we wake
[2:26:18.760 --> 2:26:22.320]  up the police and military so they don't come to our houses to take us to FEMA
[2:26:22.320 --> 2:26:26.680]  camps is to wake up people that go to their churches so that they find out
[2:26:26.680 --> 2:26:30.680]  their preachers are secretly paid by FEMA and our spies so they can expose
[2:26:30.680 --> 2:26:33.960]  that in their church and hand out flyers in the parking lot after they're kicked
[2:26:33.960 --> 2:26:38.840]  out of church to break that church up so we can have real churches look the
[2:26:38.840 --> 2:26:44.640]  solution is in the mirror and all I'm saying is yes they're arrogant yes
[2:26:44.640 --> 2:26:48.280]  they're brutal yes they're stupid yes they want a physical fight and don't

[2:31:03.000 --> 2:31:09.880]  infowars.com and prisonplanet.com especially lately he's been on TV
[2:31:09.880 --> 2:31:13.080]  national international TV quite a bit over the years but he really doesn't need
[2:31:13.080 --> 2:31:17.680]  any introduction these days he's on television and mainline radio constantly
[2:31:17.680 --> 2:31:20.960]  because so many of his predictions have come true he's also one of the chief
[2:31:20.960 --> 2:31:25.000]  advisors the congressman Ron Paul when he was running for president Ron Paul
[2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:28.720]  gets a lot of his financial advice from Peter Sheff so I wanted to get Peter
[2:31:28.720 --> 2:31:33.640]  Sheff here on the show before we run out before the year is over mr. Sheff
[2:31:33.640 --> 2:31:38.120]  thanks for coming on with us well thanks for having me in the limited time we've
[2:31:38.120 --> 2:31:43.120]  got in this 30 minutes let's get right into it I mean what we've seen with the
[2:31:43.120 --> 2:31:47.120]  banker takeover bill they're given almost omnipotent power and then the San
[2:31:47.120 --> 2:31:51.600]  Francisco Chronicle reports two weeks ago 8.5 trillion is missing the
[2:31:51.600 --> 2:31:55.520]  Bloomberg is told that they won't the Federal Reserve won't tell them or
[2:31:55.520 --> 2:32:03.000]  several trillion two trillion of that has gone and now we have the AFP
[2:32:03.000 --> 2:32:09.520]  reporting the head of the private Spanish central banks saying world
[2:32:09.520 --> 2:32:14.440]  economic meltdown total meltdown worse than the Great Depression we have the
[2:32:14.440 --> 2:32:19.720]  prime minister of Canada saying similar things are what's really happening
[2:32:19.720 --> 2:32:26.640]  here and are these guys trying to cause a world depression well I don't think
[2:32:26.640 --> 2:32:29.760]  they're trying to I think it's going to happen although not necessarily
[2:32:29.760 --> 2:32:33.400]  worldwide I certainly think there's going to be a inflationary depression in
[2:32:33.400 --> 2:32:36.760]  the United States that hopefully the rest of the world will have a good sense
[2:32:36.760 --> 2:32:41.480]  not to follow us down that path because it's certainly you know it doesn't have
[2:32:41.480 --> 2:32:45.240]  to be but you know I think it's interesting to your men talking about
[2:32:45.240 --> 2:32:49.720]  all the bars being seated to the government to the Federal Reserve as if
[2:32:49.720 --> 2:32:52.880]  they didn't do enough damage with the powers that they already had just
[2:32:52.880 --> 2:32:56.280]  remember that the problem that we're facing right now was a result of
[2:32:56.280 --> 2:32:59.800]  government government interference in the free market a government manipulation
[2:32:59.800 --> 2:33:04.320]  of interest rates government attempts to artificially stimulate the economy by
[2:33:04.320 --> 2:33:10.280]  using monetary and fiscal policy by by interfering by guaranteeing certain
[2:33:10.280 --> 2:33:14.720]  debts to encourage a risk-taking in certain areas but this is up this we
[2:33:14.720 --> 2:33:18.560]  have been micro managing the economy into this gigantic bubble that has now
[2:33:18.560 --> 2:33:22.960]  burst and and now what we're supposedly learned from all this is that we need
[2:33:22.960 --> 2:33:26.680]  even more government that we need government doing even more than it did
[2:33:26.680 --> 2:33:30.840]  before more decisions need to be turned over to government more resources need
[2:33:30.840 --> 2:33:33.800]  to be allocated more government government should be picking the winners
[2:33:33.800 --> 2:33:37.800]  and losers and and reallocating wealth and and this is going to lead to a
[2:33:37.800 --> 2:33:41.360]  complete disaster much greater than anything we're trying to deal with now
[2:33:41.360 --> 2:33:45.440]  so a completely controlled economy and the mainstream media has really been
[2:33:45.440 --> 2:33:49.000]  involved in a huge hoax I'd like you to speak to that mr. chef saying that the
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:54.280]  free market did this when really this was crony capitalism this was this was
[2:33:54.280 --> 2:33:58.760]  groups of regulators in revolving doors between government and select brokerage
[2:33:58.760 --> 2:34:04.640]  firms and banks you know I mean take the made-off situation where the SEC was
[2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:09.200]  told about what he was doing but didn't enforce the rules they had yeah look
[2:34:09.200 --> 2:34:13.400]  this is certainly not a creature of capitalism but we would not be in this
[2:34:13.400 --> 2:34:18.760]  mess where we are more of a capitalistic economy it's only because a government
[2:34:18.760 --> 2:34:22.600]  was allowed to permeate into so much of our economy particularly the Federal
[2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:26.160]  Reserve being the chief culprit there none of this would have happened the
[2:34:26.160 --> 2:34:30.200]  bubbles wouldn't have been inflated and and so there would be no deflation of a
[2:34:30.200 --> 2:34:34.200]  bubble had it never been inflated in the first place and remember what's
[2:34:34.200 --> 2:34:37.920]  happening right now at least you know what the public precedes as being a
[2:34:37.920 --> 2:34:43.000]  problem which is falling home prices people losing their jobs credit no
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:47.200]  longer flowing but this is the problem this is all the consequence of the
[2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:51.040]  problem the problem is all the reckless borrowing and spending in the years that
[2:34:51.040 --> 2:34:54.760]  preceded the collapse and and why did all that take place that all took pace
[2:34:54.760 --> 2:34:59.320]  because the Federal Reserve because of the monetary policy to pursued that led
[2:34:59.320 --> 2:35:03.600]  to all this irresponsible borrowing both on Wall Street to finance
[2:35:03.600 --> 2:35:07.800]  speculation and on Main Street to speculate the finance consumption and
[2:35:07.800 --> 2:35:11.720]  speculate mr. Mr. Sheff all these bad decisions are coming back to fight us
[2:35:11.720 --> 2:35:15.360]  you you've got a great telephone it's over driving can you back off of it a
[2:35:15.360 --> 2:35:19.640]  bit sure sure fantastic I want we we're hearing you loud and clear but it was
[2:35:19.640 --> 2:35:26.200]  just over driving thank you specifically though we see hyperinflation in
[2:35:26.200 --> 2:35:30.320]  certain areas continuing and we see trillions of dollars being issued out
[2:35:30.320 --> 2:35:34.760]  into the world economy just by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury here
[2:35:34.760 --> 2:35:39.840]  alone and so there's talk of hyperinflation rearing its head in the
[2:35:39.840 --> 2:35:44.640]  next couple years so don't we really just have a depression within the real
[2:35:44.640 --> 2:35:50.440]  Main Street economy but then when it goes into the Wall Street economy that
[2:35:50.440 --> 2:35:56.320]  it's actually generating a competing force of inflation and how do you see
[2:35:56.320 --> 2:36:00.760]  those two things playing out well I mean it's all these problems are
[2:36:00.760 --> 2:36:04.120]  consequence of inflation the government has been too easy and has created too
[2:36:04.120 --> 2:36:08.960]  much money for a while the inflation the cheap money went into stocks and it
[2:36:08.960 --> 2:36:13.440]  went into real estate and distorted the economy and distorted our decision
[2:36:13.440 --> 2:36:18.080]  making process our consumption and savings of decisions and the economy is
[2:36:18.080 --> 2:36:22.440]  is way out of balance but right now as the market is trying to correct the
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:25.880]  imbalances brought about by all the inflation government created they're
[2:36:25.880 --> 2:36:30.560]  creating even more inflation and people don't understand how dangerous this
[2:36:30.560 --> 2:36:35.280]  inflation is going to be it is going to show up in consumer prices almost
[2:36:35.280 --> 2:36:40.640]  exclusively and in commodity prices right now the the the effect of all that
[2:36:40.640 --> 2:36:46.720]  inflation on prices is being hidden based on some of the shorter term effects
[2:36:46.720 --> 2:36:51.800]  downward pressures being put on prices that are the result of the lit leveraging
[2:36:51.800 --> 2:36:56.760]  and bankruptcies and and things like that but these are short-term factors the
[2:36:56.760 --> 2:37:01.080]  factors that are pushing prices down are temporary and they will go away soon
[2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:04.640]  whereas the factors that are going to be sending prices through the roof are
[2:37:04.640 --> 2:37:10.520]  simply gaining momentum as we speak how bad is this going to get very very bad
[2:37:10.520 --> 2:37:14.920]  it's unfortunate because you know the worse it gets the more the government
[2:37:14.920 --> 2:37:19.000]  is going to interfere to try to save us and so the more the government
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:23.400]  interferes the more they try to stimulate the economy the more they try to
[2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:28.000]  revive it the more they're going to stifle it you know basically you know
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:31.800]  there's a fire and the only way the government knows to put it out is with
[2:37:31.800 --> 2:37:37.440]  gasoline and the bigger the fire grows the more gasoline they throw on it and
[2:37:37.440 --> 2:37:41.360]  they don't make the connection between the bigger fire and the gasoline because
[2:37:41.360 --> 2:37:45.880]  the only thing they know about a fire is throw gas on it and so it's going to be
[2:37:45.880 --> 2:37:51.200]  a raging wildfire that's going to consume everything because the government
[2:37:51.200 --> 2:37:54.760]  is going to keep feeding it well don't the government bureaucrats also like the
[2:37:54.760 --> 2:37:59.280]  power they get by selectively handing out trillion dollars so it's you know
[2:37:59.280 --> 2:38:03.040]  there's you know there's a reason for this too it's kind of a
[2:38:03.040 --> 2:38:08.840]  self-perpetuating loop where the government likes the idea that they
[2:38:08.840 --> 2:38:13.160]  need more power and and and the worse the economy gets the more they can
[2:38:13.160 --> 2:38:17.920]  justify the power grab and the more likely citizens are to give up their
[2:38:17.920 --> 2:38:21.120]  rights and to give more power to government because they're convinced
[2:38:21.120 --> 2:38:24.640]  that the government's going to use that power benevolently for their benefit
[2:38:24.640 --> 2:38:28.000]  but of course we all know that power corrupts and when you give the government
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:31.760]  absolute power and help will corrupt absolutely Peter said basically what
[2:38:31.760 --> 2:38:34.920]  we're doing Peter chef I mean you've been very successful in investments
[2:38:34.920 --> 2:38:38.480]  investing you know over a billion dollars you're getting great returns for
[2:38:38.480 --> 2:38:42.800]  folks your predictions are what have been even more stunningly accurate out
[2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:47.520]  there where do you see the United States in six months a year two years give us
[2:38:47.520 --> 2:38:51.400]  a forecast of you know not not where you'd like us to go or where different
[2:38:51.400 --> 2:38:55.720]  decisions of you or Ron Paul we're running the Treasury but but where you
[2:38:55.720 --> 2:39:00.200]  think they're taking us well they're taking us in the wrong direction I mean
[2:39:00.200 --> 2:39:06.280]  we you know what we need in this country is we need to to address the the root
[2:39:06.280 --> 2:39:10.720]  causes of these imbalances our lack of savings why is it that we're not saving
[2:39:10.720 --> 2:39:14.520]  enough money well interest rates are too low they need to be much higher people
[2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:20.000]  need to be rewarded for saving and we need to make it expensive to borrow you
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:23.560]  know we need to produce more we need we need to make more stuff not consume more
[2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:27.440]  stuff and in order to do that we need more capital and again we need more
[2:39:27.440 --> 2:39:31.960]  savings to get more capital we also need capital to be efficient which means we
[2:39:31.960 --> 2:39:35.400]  means we need less regulations right we need fewer regulations not more
[2:39:35.400 --> 2:39:39.120]  regulations we need a smaller government because if we have we're going to get
[2:39:39.120 --> 2:39:43.160]  more capital if we have lower taxes but we can't get lower taxes unless we get
[2:39:43.160 --> 2:39:46.840]  a smaller government but right now everything we're doing we're getting
[2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:50.480]  more regulation bigger government more expensive government more onerous
[2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:55.600]  regulation we're trying to force feed more credit into the American economy
[2:39:55.600 --> 2:39:59.520]  we're keeping interest rates much too low we're encouraging all of the wrong
[2:39:59.520 --> 2:40:03.800]  behavior and we're punishing all the right behavior we're bailing out companies
[2:40:03.800 --> 2:40:07.640]  that should be failing that should be going bankrupt and we're taxing or
[2:40:07.640 --> 2:40:11.200]  taking money away from the companies that are successful and that we need to
[2:40:11.200 --> 2:40:16.840]  expand and and and we can't have a successful economy where you take all
[2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:22.880]  the free market forces and cage them and instead resources are allocated
[2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:28.040]  companies fail and succeed based on the whims of politicians and you know it's
[2:40:28.040 --> 2:40:32.640]  not a function of you know how who you are how good you can do something but
[2:40:32.640 --> 2:40:37.160]  who you know and what political connections you have and and that's not
[2:40:37.160 --> 2:40:43.080]  how to run the economy well let's take the case of a Bernard Madoff I mean
[2:40:43.080 --> 2:40:47.440]  we've got this guy with their saying 50 to a hundred billion dollars no one
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:51.040]  seems to know big banks involved with him big brokerage firms involved
[2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:55.880]  investing with him and he's now claiming that he alone ran this whole scam
[2:40:55.880 --> 2:41:00.120]  generated the spreadsheets what was mailed out to investors that no one
[2:41:00.120 --> 2:41:04.080]  including his sons didn't know sounds like he's taken the fall for a bunch of
[2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:08.080]  other people well it sounds like he is I mean he's seven years old he probably
[2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:11.840]  figures you know you know how bad is the life sentence for him he's probably I'm
[2:41:11.840 --> 2:41:16.080]  sure that other people knew I just can't believe that he could have orchestrated
[2:41:16.080 --> 2:41:20.800]  the whole thing and not a single other person in his organization knew that
[2:41:20.800 --> 2:41:24.040]  that these trades weren't being made that you know that the returns were phony
[2:41:24.040 --> 2:41:28.440]  but you know the bigger issue here and I think there's two issues number one is
[2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:33.440]  theoretically all of this happened under the watchful eye of the SEC and to a
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:38.760]  lesser extent FINRA the companies that regulate broker dealers and investment
[2:41:38.760 --> 2:41:42.640]  managers and if they couldn't catch that I mean what what I mean I mean that's
[2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:46.440]  kind of ridiculous that they couldn't catch it but I think that a lot of people
[2:41:46.440 --> 2:41:51.040]  one of the reasons that so many people just kind of accepted that it was true
[2:41:51.040 --> 2:41:54.240]  was because they assumed that the government was regulating it all and
[2:41:54.240 --> 2:41:59.520]  assumed that government regulators were on the job protecting the fraud and I
[2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:04.800]  think in general government regulation does more harm than good and for no other
[2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:09.640]  reason then it breeds complacency I think the public you know would have been a
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:13.680]  lot more skeptical of a Maddox had their bit made off rather had there been no
[2:42:13.680 --> 2:42:18.040]  SEC had there been no FINRA had people realize that that that you know that
[2:42:18.040 --> 2:42:21.800]  there that there are dishonest people they might have done a better job the
[2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:25.920]  free market might have done a much better job of policing this then then the
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:29.760]  government did yeah here's an also I think you know I think the bigger lesson
[2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:34.280]  here is that Ponzi schemes don't work and they don't work when the product when a
[2:42:34.280 --> 2:42:37.840]  private citizen tries it but they also don't work when the government does it
[2:42:37.840 --> 2:42:41.600]  which means social security is going to meet the fate the same fate that was my
[2:42:41.600 --> 2:42:46.400]  next point that off that was my next point but instead the Ponzi scheme's
[2:42:46.400 --> 2:42:51.440]  gotten so big with you know thousands of quadrillions or whatever globally that
[2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:56.480]  when does that Ponzi scheme come do you are we seeing the Ponzi scheme fall I
[2:42:56.480 --> 2:42:59.840]  mean yeah I think we are we first of all remember there's a lot of naturally
[2:42:59.840 --> 2:43:03.800]  occurring Ponzi schemes in the market the housing bubble was a Ponzi scheme the
[2:43:03.800 --> 2:43:07.640]  stock market bubble was a Ponzi scheme oil the whole idea was that you have a
[2:43:07.640 --> 2:43:11.440]  greater fool there the investment returns not come from the investment but
[2:43:11.440 --> 2:43:15.800]  from cashing out to a greater fool that's all Ponzi dynamic think about the
[2:43:15.800 --> 2:43:20.480]  way the United States operates its budget we borrow money forever the
[2:43:20.480 --> 2:43:24.760]  national debt always gets bigger it never gets smaller whenever the debts
[2:43:24.760 --> 2:43:28.820]  mature we have to go borrow more money to pay it off but the final
[2:43:28.820 --> 2:43:32.800]  we have interest payment we have to go deeper into debt but in the final
[2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:36.600]  equation that's what Dick Cheney says he says we have the nukes and we can nuke
[2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:41.760]  the whole planet you know he said that Sunday on Fox News and he did you well
[2:43:41.760 --> 2:43:45.240]  I mean he said the president is all powerful you can't question the
[2:43:45.240 --> 2:43:50.840]  president's power after all he's got the nuclear football so what so what does he
[2:43:50.840 --> 2:43:53.960]  mean by that that if people don't want to buy our bonds we're gonna do I don't
[2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:58.000]  know what that means every time he gives a speech now or talks he just says the
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:02.360]  president's above law no one can question him I can play the clip if you
[2:44:02.360 --> 2:44:05.280]  want to hear at the point is I mean that's just that's a nonsense and it's
[2:44:05.280 --> 2:44:08.760]  very frightening that somebody is even saying that and that you know and we're
[2:44:08.760 --> 2:44:13.320]  just you know allowing it but I mean I think that's the delusional megalomania
[2:44:13.320 --> 2:44:17.520]  and I mean now Obama's coming in promising to give people millions of
[2:44:17.520 --> 2:44:22.040]  jobs and more taxes and I like the way he changed his mind he said you know he's
[2:44:22.040 --> 2:44:25.480]  changing he's not gonna do two million jobs with three million jobs so why not
[2:44:25.480 --> 2:44:29.360]  five million jobs why not ten million jobs I mean like like he can just create
[2:44:29.360 --> 2:44:33.040]  jobs of however many he decides when he's gonna create your shift he's not
[2:44:33.040 --> 2:44:36.600]  stupid he may not be as smart as an economist or investors you are but they
[2:44:36.600 --> 2:44:41.480]  know that raising taxes is gonna hurt the economy well they're not even
[2:44:41.480 --> 2:44:45.680]  planning on rate except they might raise taxes on employers you know but you
[2:44:45.680 --> 2:44:49.120]  know they're they're not talking about big tax hike increases they're just
[2:44:49.120 --> 2:44:53.360]  talking about printing money see the problem is they think that printing
[2:44:53.360 --> 2:44:58.160]  money and spending it is is as good as actually earning it or you know that
[2:44:58.160 --> 2:45:03.080]  that wealth can come from a printing press and they don't understand how
[2:45:03.080 --> 2:45:07.080]  legitimate wealth is created they are just going I mean how bad I mean you say
[2:45:07.080 --> 2:45:11.040]  it's gonna get very bad what is very bad 24 months from now what's the
[2:45:11.040 --> 2:45:16.200]  united states very bad is is very bad is a runaway inflation very bad is a
[2:45:16.200 --> 2:45:22.480]  shortages of basic goods of food and energy products that we now take for
[2:45:22.480 --> 2:45:26.880]  granted becoming a prohibitively expensive and hard to come by because of
[2:45:26.880 --> 2:45:32.720]  government in price controls because of distribution problems what we're
[2:45:32.720 --> 2:45:37.200]  looking at is sky-high interest rates for everybody but the government the
[2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:39.720]  only people that are gonna be able to borrow is gonna be the government and
[2:45:39.720 --> 2:45:43.920]  all they will do is give us money that doesn't buy anything I mean I mean we're
[2:45:43.920 --> 2:45:48.280]  talking about a situation where instead of worrying about you know Mexicans
[2:45:48.280 --> 2:45:51.840]  coming across the border we're gonna be worrying about merit americans going in
[2:45:51.840 --> 2:45:54.720]  the other direction well that's already happening with a lot of wealthy people
[2:45:54.720 --> 2:45:57.640]  that see the writing on the wall yeah but wait till it's not just wealthy people
[2:45:57.640 --> 2:46:00.480]  wait till it's young people who are looking for opportunities and know they
[2:46:00.480 --> 2:46:03.920]  don't find any here because the government is spiteful them all well
[2:46:03.920 --> 2:46:07.560]  that's my when people when people immigrated that you know second
[2:46:07.560 --> 2:46:10.920]  generation americans start you know going back to their their home country
[2:46:10.920 --> 2:46:13.560]  you know where their parents came from because there's more opportunities
[2:46:13.560 --> 2:46:17.600]  outside the United States and within that that's where we're headed because
[2:46:17.600 --> 2:46:23.440]  the bureaucrats like a horde of locusts came to the United States and basically
[2:46:23.440 --> 2:46:27.600]  ate it down to the bone I want to come back and talk about solutions way to
[2:46:27.600 --> 2:46:31.880]  avert this if it can be averted or ways to individually protect ourselves in a
[2:46:31.880 --> 2:46:35.920]  final short segment with Peter Schiff and we'll tell you about his website and
[2:46:35.920 --> 2:46:40.480]  more the information he has also his radio show that he does but speaking of
[2:46:40.480 --> 2:46:44.320]  government solutions you know they've announced 20,000 battle-hardened trips
[2:46:44.320 --> 2:46:49.360]  for homeland security for north america under north com the army war college
[2:46:49.360 --> 2:46:53.880]  now says they are preparing to engage militarily the american people that the
[2:46:53.880 --> 2:46:58.640]  people try to remove the government in washington in the spirit of 1776 that
[2:46:58.640 --> 2:47:03.400]  the military will engage us where do you see that going
[2:47:03.400 --> 2:47:06.480]  as you know it would you say again I thought I was going to a break no no
[2:47:06.480 --> 2:47:09.560]  I mean I was we're gonna go to break them we're gonna come back but I was
[2:47:09.560 --> 2:47:13.120]  asking you briefly you've heard about the plan well they're already doing it to
[2:47:13.120 --> 2:47:16.800]  put 20,000 u.s. troops on the streets to engage the american people
[2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:22.320]  I hadn't heard about that really you haven't heard about that no I mean I
[2:47:22.320 --> 2:47:25.400]  wouldn't be surprised if we're mean ultimately as I said I've been
[2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:30.440]  forecasting that there would be civil unrest and and riding in response to you
[2:47:30.440 --> 2:47:34.360]  know government credit shortages and a lack of opportunity a lot of people are
[2:47:34.360 --> 2:47:37.160]  gonna be losing their jobs in the next several years and because of government
[2:47:37.160 --> 2:47:40.360]  policy they're not gonna find new jobs and I think unemployed people who are
[2:47:40.360 --> 2:47:44.520]  hungry get very frustrated and I thought maybe the government want knows that
[2:47:44.520 --> 2:47:47.840]  this is gonna happen they're trying to get the troops in advance you know on
[2:47:47.840 --> 2:47:51.880]  the streets in advance but I mean they've been quietly setting us up for
[2:47:51.880 --> 2:47:55.840]  decades but now they announced north com homeland security is for the american
[2:47:55.840 --> 2:48:01.840]  people that's quite a totalitarian shift isn't it yeah but it's a shift in the
[2:48:01.840 --> 2:48:06.800]  in the wrong direction and we're headed there fast okay sir there's several

[2:52:11.280 --> 2:52:14.440]  could fix government what would be the good moves there to fix this but
[2:52:14.440 --> 2:52:17.960]  obviously that's not going to happen secondarily what can we do
[2:52:17.960 --> 2:52:23.000]  individually from your educated opinion sir well individually is about the
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:26.920]  only thing we can do I mean we could try to influence the politicians but it
[2:52:26.920 --> 2:52:30.000]  doesn't look like that's gonna work I mean they've got us on this course
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:34.640]  they're gonna drive this bus right over the edge of a cliff and you know we can
[2:52:34.640 --> 2:52:38.000]  try to scream and get them to change course but the bottom line is we're
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:41.800]  probably gonna go over that cliff so the best thing that we can do is try to get
[2:52:41.800 --> 2:52:45.080]  off the bus ourselves and and that's what I'm helping people do with their
[2:52:45.080 --> 2:52:48.800]  investments with trying to understand that it's the dollar that's going to be
[2:52:48.800 --> 2:52:52.880]  the big casualty here the value of our money and that if people want to protect
[2:52:52.880 --> 2:52:56.360]  their wealth that they don't want to be stuck foot in the bill for all the bail
[2:52:56.360 --> 2:53:00.120]  outs and all the stimulus packages they need to get their money out of US assets
[2:53:00.120 --> 2:53:03.920]  they need to be out of dollars completely out of US currency that means out of
[2:53:03.920 --> 2:53:08.640]  money market CDs bonds if you can out of US real estate I think out of most US
[2:53:08.640 --> 2:53:12.720]  stocks and move your money abroad I mean being foreign currencies being foreign
[2:53:12.720 --> 2:53:16.840]  government bonds corporate bonds foreign stocks around the world owning assets
[2:53:16.840 --> 2:53:21.400]  that earn their revenues and pay their dividends what about all this dollar and
[2:53:21.400 --> 2:53:25.440]  certainly owning up owning precious metals owning gold only silver having
[2:53:25.440 --> 2:53:29.760]  having some physical gold in your possession having more gold outside the
[2:53:29.760 --> 2:53:34.880]  United States where it might be even safer investing in mining companies and
[2:53:34.880 --> 2:53:39.240]  people have to understand and plan for what's going to happen as bad as it's
[2:53:39.240 --> 2:53:44.000]  going to be we can at least plan for it we can at least try to minimize the
[2:53:44.000 --> 2:53:49.280]  impact on our own lives and our own finances although in many respects you
[2:53:49.280 --> 2:53:54.640]  know the way it's going to play out in our personal lives I may way over over
[2:53:54.640 --> 2:53:59.040]  shadow any success we might have I was about to say I mean crime is already
[2:53:59.040 --> 2:54:02.840]  exploding how bad do you think it's going to get well look I certainly think
[2:54:02.840 --> 2:54:06.720]  it's going to get worse as economic conditions worsen and I don't think we're
[2:54:06.720 --> 2:54:10.200]  as civil as society I mean maybe I'm wrong here but I don't think we're as
[2:54:10.200 --> 2:54:14.800]  civil as our grandparents were during the 1930s I don't think that the type of
[2:54:14.800 --> 2:54:18.920]  hardship that we're gonna have is gonna be greeted the way it was I think we
[2:54:18.920 --> 2:54:22.360]  have an entire generation of dependency in this country of people who think
[2:54:22.360 --> 2:54:25.400]  they're entitled to something well sir I think a lot of people are gonna are
[2:54:25.400 --> 2:54:29.720]  gonna react very differently than the way our grandparents I think it's worse
[2:54:29.720 --> 2:54:35.360]  than that I mean I agree with you if 90% of our forebears were agrarian and now
[2:54:35.360 --> 2:54:40.240]  we're 90% urban even if they were nice people socially how are they gonna feed
[2:54:40.240 --> 2:54:44.720]  themselves you know yeah I mean it's as I said it's it's gonna be difficult and
[2:54:44.720 --> 2:54:48.800]  it's it's already amazing and in the nation that supposedly so abundant right
[2:54:48.800 --> 2:54:54.080]  when it comes to food you know 90% of our seafood is imported you know I mean
[2:54:54.080 --> 2:54:57.720]  it's crazy we have all these oceans two oceans we have all these lakes yet we
[2:54:57.720 --> 2:55:01.360]  import 90% of our fish well in closing now when the dollar collapses and that
[2:55:01.360 --> 2:55:05.440]  fishes and coming in you know it's not going to be there and it's not you know
[2:55:05.440 --> 2:55:08.480]  it's not like we got a bunch of boats and fishermen ready to go you know to
[2:55:08.480 --> 2:55:12.400]  pick up the slack no you're absolutely right well let me take level warming and
[2:55:12.400 --> 2:55:17.000]  closing even if you believe that but our breath you know our breathing and our
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:22.160]  cars and cow flatulences is killing the earth moving everything to China and
[2:55:22.160 --> 2:55:25.960]  India where they have no standards is gonna boost the level of those gases so
[2:55:25.960 --> 2:55:30.000]  it's the same thing government is literally killing our economy well
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:33.200]  that's it I mean what we've got to do is kill government before it kills us
[2:55:33.200 --> 2:55:36.600]  they're like a cancer and you know the cancer keeps getting bigger and bigger
[2:55:36.600 --> 2:55:42.240]  and bigger and we're feeding a cancer as opposed to trying to fight it off all
[2:55:42.240 --> 2:55:46.440]  right have a great Christmas and have a great new year and I look forward to

[2:57:25.960 --> 2:57:43.480]  we have April Gallup's lawyer Bill Veal on the line with us our listeners five
[2:57:43.480 --> 2:57:49.480]  six months ago raised money with April Gallup here on the show be able to
[2:57:49.480 --> 2:57:53.920]  file suit against George Bush and Dick Cheney for the 9-11 attacks in this
[2:57:53.920 --> 2:57:57.160]  lawsuit they're going to get discovery unless they declare national security
[2:57:57.160 --> 2:58:00.320]  which should be very very interesting that should be revealing in and of
[2:58:00.320 --> 2:58:07.480]  itself the ex GI plaintiff alleges she has been denied government support since
[2:58:07.480 --> 2:58:11.480]  then because she raised painful questions about the inexplainable failure of
[2:58:11.480 --> 2:58:14.920]  military defense at the Pentagon that day the suit charges that Cheney
[2:58:14.920 --> 2:58:18.760]  Rumsfeld admires conducted a conspiracy to facilitate the attacks and alleges
[2:58:18.760 --> 2:58:22.440]  that other unnamed individuals and foreknowledge she was there smelling the
[2:58:22.440 --> 2:58:26.680]  explosives she was right in the zone with the supposed aircraft hit you know
[2:58:26.680 --> 2:58:30.880]  cutting cleanly through the walls no no airplane wreckage found and then they
[2:58:30.880 --> 2:58:33.840]  showed up at the hospital telling her what she did see and basically
[2:58:33.840 --> 2:58:37.040]  threatening her that's what she started asking questions she brought her baby
[2:58:37.040 --> 2:58:41.160]  to work that day which she's been authorized to do they were then claiming
[2:58:41.160 --> 2:58:44.040]  that you know she shouldn't have done that as if she could go into the building
[2:58:44.040 --> 2:58:50.040]  without them knowing she had her baby just an amazing story with April Gallup
[2:58:50.040 --> 2:58:55.360]  and so I wanted to get her lawyer on to first recap what happened to her and
[2:58:55.360 --> 2:59:00.040]  then why he's chosen to take this case and where the case is going this is a
[2:59:00.040 --> 2:59:04.280]  landmark obviously landmark case in its importance and if it goes anywhere
[2:59:04.280 --> 2:59:10.520]  extremely important historical so thank you thanks for coming on sir no you
[2:59:10.520 --> 2:59:15.480]  bet short segment now just just recap what happened to April why she's suing
[2:59:15.480 --> 2:59:22.920]  and then let's get to the details of the suit itself well you know she was the
[2:59:22.920 --> 2:59:27.920]  first date back from maternity leave and she showed up at the Pentagon and she
[2:59:27.920 --> 2:59:32.680]  was going to take her kid to daycare and they said no we want you to go in there
[2:59:32.680 --> 2:59:36.880]  and finish up them some job that had to be done at the at the computer and they
[2:59:36.880 --> 2:59:41.640]  say you can take a kid to daycare if you get finished at so she went in and
[2:59:41.640 --> 2:59:48.120]  basically sat down and turned the computer on and you know the place just
[2:59:48.120 --> 2:59:52.640]  blew up there were enormous explosions and she was not
[2:59:52.640 --> 2:59:57.840]  unconscious and you know came to after some period of time that she really
[2:59:57.840 --> 3:00:05.000]  didn't know how long that was and managed to gather herself and her child
[3:00:05.000 --> 3:00:11.240]  two months old up and and she and other people who were in similar position
[3:00:11.240 --> 3:00:18.400]  managed to struggle out through the dust and the smoke and and and what fire
[3:00:18.400 --> 3:00:23.880]  there was that wouldn't have been much fire at that point and you know stepping
[3:00:23.880 --> 3:00:31.280]  over you know all kinds of debris and and probably people all that just feel
[3:00:31.280 --> 3:00:36.040]  and hardly any fire yeah well yeah I mean there were fires coming out of the
[3:00:36.040 --> 3:00:43.240]  computers that she remembers but what she her her her primary focus and her
[3:00:43.240 --> 3:00:49.480]  memory of getting out of there was just through smoke and dust and then she saw
[3:00:49.480 --> 3:00:55.240]  light and people were kind of helping her and and she struggled out onto the
[3:00:55.240 --> 3:01:01.200]  onto the lawn there she stepped over the last barrier of the wall and basically
[3:01:01.200 --> 3:01:06.600]  collapsed out on the on the lawn there and next thing she knew she was in the
[3:01:06.600 --> 3:01:14.600]  hospital I mean it's just a horrendous moment of anybody's life but she is an
[3:01:14.600 --> 3:01:21.920]  inspiring character in so many ways and you know you just can't let her be
[3:01:21.920 --> 3:01:26.120]  courageous by herself that she's inspired she in that way and so the only
[3:01:26.120 --> 3:01:32.880]  people with the ability to find justice under these circumstances are lawyers
[3:01:32.880 --> 3:01:36.640]  and and I happen to be one so well Bill that was the next thing I was going to
[3:01:36.640 --> 3:01:40.920]  say to Bill Ville here you are courageous you have a lot of courage they
[3:01:40.920 --> 3:01:43.960]  clearly a lot of evidence shows they just whacked a guy you know involved with
[3:01:43.960 --> 3:01:47.920]  Carl Rowe for exposing some things and we know they kill people every day you
[3:01:47.920 --> 3:01:53.480]  know they kill 3,000 on 9-11 so they'll they'll stoop to anything so we'll be
[3:01:53.480 --> 3:01:57.320]  praying for you here and we come back specifically why you decided to take the
[3:01:57.320 --> 3:02:03.120]  case what her standing is and what it's alleging where this is going I mean
[3:02:03.120 --> 3:02:07.920]  imagine folks we have a plaintiff who clearly has the standing because she was
[3:02:07.920 --> 3:02:13.120]  in a victim of the attack and they're going forward the suit we'll tell you
[3:02:13.120 --> 3:02:18.120]  exactly why when we get back with our guest again I'm Alex Jones this is the
[3:02:18.120 --> 3:02:23.960]  GCN radio network websites are prison planet dot TV and info wars net please
[3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:30.120]  stay with us hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's
[3:02:30.120 --> 3:02:33.480]  important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we
[3:02:33.480 --> 3:02:36.960]  need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to
[3:02:36.960 --> 3:02:40.320]  stand in a red line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the
[3:02:40.320 --> 3:02:44.520]  Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[3:02:44.520 --> 3:02:48.240]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for
[3:02:48.240 --> 3:02:52.000]  special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the
[3:02:52.000 --> 3:02:56.480]  telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out of
[3:02:56.480 --> 3:03:00.560]  thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the exploding
[3:03:00.560 --> 3:03:04.320]  inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and
[3:03:04.320 --> 3:03:08.440]  blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many Americans
[3:03:08.440 --> 3:03:12.320]  reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread
[3:03:12.320 --> 3:03:16.880]  doubled every two days until it reached over 4 billion marks food prices are
[3:03:16.880 --> 3:03:21.080]  skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private
[3:03:21.080 --> 3:03:24.720]  banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough
[3:03:24.720 --> 3:03:28.480]  money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices
[3:03:28.480 --> 3:03:32.360]  to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and be
[3:03:32.360 --> 3:03:36.040]  ready everything is zeroing it on food one third of Americans have to choose
[3:03:36.040 --> 3:03:39.840]  between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it
[3:03:39.840 --> 3:03:43.800]  takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there
[3:03:43.800 --> 3:03:46.720]  listening it's very important for you understand that by having a supply of
[3:03:46.720 --> 3:03:50.160]  storeable food the government the new-old order has a lot less control over
[3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:54.640]  you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one
[3:03:54.640 --> 3:03:57.960]  is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you you know e
[3:03:57.960 --> 3:04:01.800]  foods direct comm is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from E coli

[3:04:31.840 --> 3:04:39.120]  first step is getting storeable food he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones
[3:04:39.120 --> 3:04:43.200]  on the GCN radio network
[3:04:47.160 --> 3:04:54.240]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen and our guest is attorney bill veal bill
[3:04:54.240 --> 3:05:02.400]  tell us a little about yourself I know you're involved in 9-11 truth specifically
[3:05:02.400 --> 3:05:07.960]  why you decided to take this on and then let's get into the suit itself because
[3:05:07.960 --> 3:05:15.760]  it is bringing out a lot of really powerful information well I'm a I did
[3:05:15.760 --> 3:05:20.560]  30 some years as a public defender I retired as chief assistant in
[3:05:20.560 --> 3:05:26.160]  Contra Costa County a couple of years ago and at that point I was pretty much
[3:05:26.160 --> 3:05:35.320]  like normal average Americans you know unbelieving and I didn't have any
[3:05:35.320 --> 3:05:41.680]  particular suspicions about 9-11 and you know a colleague of mine threw a book at
[3:05:41.680 --> 3:05:49.000]  me one day and I started reading and you know I was inspired by you know at the
[3:05:49.000 --> 3:05:53.600]  time I was inspired by the enormity of the the atrocity to take in place and
[3:05:53.600 --> 3:05:59.200]  no matter who did it but after you you do the reading and you do the research and
[3:05:59.200 --> 3:06:06.160]  you you learn about what went on then you become inspired by the just stunning
[3:06:06.160 --> 3:06:14.040]  you know unbreath-taking colossal sense of the nature of the crime itself and
[3:06:14.040 --> 3:06:19.840]  the overwhelming arrogance of the people who were engaged in the most powerful
[3:06:19.840 --> 3:06:24.720]  people in the world and their thought that they could get away basically with
[3:06:24.720 --> 3:06:28.680]  what they did well they think they can get away they think they can get away
[3:06:28.680 --> 3:06:34.000]  with stealing 8.5 trillion with the banker takeover I mean I mean arrogance
[3:06:34.000 --> 3:06:38.520]  who would think they would write up memos saying we can torture children in
[3:06:38.520 --> 3:06:41.560]  front of their parents and then being questioned about it and saying yes the
[3:06:41.560 --> 3:06:47.280]  president has that power but I'm sorry I interrupt go ahead well so I'm inspired
[3:06:47.280 --> 3:06:51.720]  by by the enormity of the crime I'm inspired by their arrogance and I'm
[3:06:51.720 --> 3:06:58.120]  inspired by the courage of April Gallup and so I decided that nobody else is
[3:06:58.120 --> 3:07:01.280]  going to do anything you know in a perfect world for God's sake they would
[3:07:01.280 --> 3:07:06.160]  have been some US attorney someplace who would have said he was this is you know
[3:07:06.160 --> 3:07:10.040]  smells a little funny to me I think maybe we ought to look into it and they
[3:07:10.040 --> 3:07:13.800]  would have sent out some investigators and you know you don't have to look
[3:07:13.800 --> 3:07:17.720]  that hard to find something to latch on to that that leads you to another place
[3:07:17.720 --> 3:07:21.800]  it leads to another place and then you you know if you keep your eyes open and
[3:07:21.800 --> 3:07:25.840]  your ears open you you learn what's went on here this is not hard this is not
[3:07:25.840 --> 3:07:30.240]  really a close case and so you know there you would have thought there would
[3:07:30.240 --> 3:07:35.600]  have been somebody in along those lines some in law enforcement person in this
[3:07:35.600 --> 3:07:40.960]  country a lawyer who would have taken on the job but that didn't happen so it's
[3:07:40.960 --> 3:07:48.240]  left to the private citizens and you know there I am and I've got a friend who
[3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:53.880]  is a veteran civil rights lawyer Dennis Cunningham and the two of us decided
[3:07:53.880 --> 3:07:58.640]  that this was something that had to be done okay so Dennis Dennis Cunningham
[3:07:58.640 --> 3:08:02.840]  has signed his name onto this declaration against tyranny as well you
[3:08:02.840 --> 3:08:07.480]  know reading from the suit itself by helping the attack succeed defendants
[3:08:07.480 --> 3:08:12.000]  in their cohorts created a basis for the seizure of extraordinary power a
[3:08:12.000 --> 3:08:15.680]  pretext for launching the so-called global war on terror and the guys of
[3:08:15.680 --> 3:08:20.200]  which they were free to pursue plans for military conquest full spectrum
[3:08:20.200 --> 3:08:24.720]  dominance and American supremacy around the world as they have done reads the
[3:08:24.720 --> 3:08:30.680]  lawsuit and see you go into motive everything walk us through the basics
[3:08:30.680 --> 3:08:34.640]  of the suit and what her standing is and where you think this will go what
[3:08:34.640 --> 3:08:41.360]  courts it's going to be heard in yeah well you know April was she was hurt
[3:08:41.360 --> 3:08:45.960]  it's as simple as that you know if you assault somebody they have a cause of
[3:08:45.960 --> 3:08:50.360]  action against you so that's we're playing this on the simplest and most
[3:08:50.360 --> 3:08:57.640]  basic level she was hurt by these people and so she has standing to sue the
[3:08:57.640 --> 3:09:01.960]  Congress of the United States decided very shortly after 9-11 with very
[3:09:01.960 --> 3:09:07.200]  little thought as far as I can see that everything every claim that there would
[3:09:07.200 --> 3:09:13.400]  be made it would be made throughout the country that had anything to do with
[3:09:13.400 --> 3:09:17.400]  9-11 would have the jurisdiction for that claim would be in the southern
[3:09:17.400 --> 3:09:22.080]  district of New York and the federal court so that's where we followed the
[3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:28.200]  lawsuit and we believe that you know it's going to be a large you know hard
[3:09:28.200 --> 3:09:33.480]  fight here because these guys got power that pretty hard to really conceive of
[3:09:33.480 --> 3:09:41.360]  but anyway so we make the the the claim that there was a conspiracy it
[3:09:41.360 --> 3:09:44.880]  included the you know the highest people in the government the Cheney
[3:09:44.880 --> 3:09:50.560]  Grumpsfeld Myers and lots of other people too that we did not name we named
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:55.360]  him as John Doze as you do in federal court and we believe they got together
[3:09:55.360 --> 3:10:00.560]  and decided that this was a moment that was required by American history that
[3:10:00.560 --> 3:10:05.200]  the a sleeping nation basically needed to be awakened from its torpor and they
[3:10:05.200 --> 3:10:09.920]  made to understand the dangers of the 21st century and how you know we needed
[3:10:09.920 --> 3:10:16.880]  to project our power around the world so that you know we could run things as
[3:10:16.880 --> 3:10:22.040]  were required by you know those who know best those who have the power in this
[3:10:22.040 --> 3:10:28.800]  country so they left enough evidence behind that we could see what they had
[3:10:28.800 --> 3:10:36.320]  done we don't know the precise mechanisms in many instances but we
[3:10:36.320 --> 3:10:41.600]  don't have to and so that's right we know the official story has been a
[3:10:41.600 --> 3:10:51.440]  disproven fairytale hoax of fraud a sham a giant cockamamie fraud and this has
[3:10:51.440 --> 3:10:57.800]  to be done and now specifically did you guys file the suit right as bush is
[3:10:57.800 --> 3:11:02.960]  leaving office hoping that during the transition someone in the establishment
[3:11:02.960 --> 3:11:06.480]  might not be able to block or slow the suit down as fast as they might have
[3:11:06.480 --> 3:11:11.760]  been able to and I know if this is a matter of it's taken us this long to get
[3:11:11.760 --> 3:11:15.440]  it together to the point where we thought we were comfortable to go ahead
[3:11:15.440 --> 3:11:21.040]  with it it's an enormous amount of work and we had a lot of research to do
[3:11:21.040 --> 3:11:25.160]  there's you know an enormous amount of material has been written and we had to
[3:11:25.160 --> 3:11:30.000]  get on top of it as much of as we could in order to have the lawsuit make
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:33.520]  sense and then make claims that we thought we could back up and that's what
[3:11:33.520 --> 3:11:41.680]  we're done and so you know we filed it when we got it ready and as soon as we
[3:11:41.680 --> 3:11:47.760]  could do it and there was no particular hope that I don't think things need to
[3:11:47.760 --> 3:11:51.040]  change that much you know with the new administration no I agree with you ma'am
[3:11:51.040 --> 3:11:56.320]  I was just so I mean you know people with different attitudes will will be in
[3:11:56.320 --> 3:12:00.640]  positions where they could affect things but those people have been a
[3:12:00.640 --> 3:12:05.840]  position to to speak out along before this and and nothing's been said so I
[3:12:05.840 --> 3:12:10.040]  don't know I agree I mean if there was any questions about Obama all of his
[3:12:10.040 --> 3:12:14.720]  appointments should should should leave and his announcements should leave no
[3:12:14.720 --> 3:12:20.400]  questions about where he is going so I would disagree with you there I've got
[3:12:20.400 --> 3:12:24.200]  great hope as a matter of fact for him in many respects but I think that this is
[3:12:24.200 --> 3:12:29.920]  simply an issue that is too big for anybody with that kind of access to to
[3:12:29.920 --> 3:12:35.080]  speak on at this point maybe at some point or another you know it'll be
[3:12:35.080 --> 3:12:37.960]  put in a position where they will have to say something that's kind of what
[3:12:37.960 --> 3:12:43.000]  we're doing listen you're a smart guy mr. Veal look you've got I mean seriously
[3:12:43.000 --> 3:12:46.600]  you've got over here I mean you figure out 9-11 you can figure this out you've
[3:12:46.600 --> 3:12:50.200]  got Bush setting up the military to police the American people and then
[3:12:50.200 --> 3:12:54.880]  Obama is cheerleading it ready to get all this new power and he's keeping gates
[3:12:54.880 --> 3:13:00.680]  in I mean they are passing the baton they are they are in unison like it's an
[3:13:00.680 --> 3:13:06.120]  Olympic relay team here well you know I think you know your points are well
[3:13:06.120 --> 3:13:11.680]  taken and I'm a hopeful person I thought I was filed this lawsuit because I'm a
[3:13:11.680 --> 3:13:18.440]  hopeful person and I'm gonna wait and let those people who have the team power
[3:13:18.440 --> 3:13:23.680]  sure disappoint me how do you see them how do you do I'm gonna maintain my
[3:13:23.680 --> 3:13:27.400]  hope sure how do you see them coming at you we're trying to block it oh I don't
[3:13:27.400 --> 3:13:32.320]  think you know they're good they've got they've got you know they don't these
[3:13:32.320 --> 3:13:36.760]  people don't have lawyers they have law firms they it's gonna be enormous and
[3:13:36.760 --> 3:13:41.920]  I like how you go after them for covering up the attack and and you know
[3:13:41.920 --> 3:13:45.800]  that's one of the points in the suit this is this is a very detailed suit
[3:13:45.800 --> 3:13:51.000]  please continue well that's well it's you know the the important thing about
[3:13:51.000 --> 3:13:56.920]  this was I'm not the most important thing but the one of the reasons why
[3:13:56.920 --> 3:14:03.520]  we're in a position that we are is they the law the cover-up basically was
[3:14:03.520 --> 3:14:08.480]  conceived before the crime was conceived right everything had to be done
[3:14:08.480 --> 3:14:13.080]  with the thought that okay there is gonna be at some point or another
[3:14:13.080 --> 3:14:16.760]  somebody looking in this direction so we need to misdirect you at that point
[3:14:16.760 --> 3:14:20.600]  and then they look up make you look over here and they misdirect you at that
[3:14:20.600 --> 3:14:24.480]  point exactly the cover-up is the evidence of the crime I mean I mean I
[3:14:24.480 --> 3:14:29.960]  would say you know admission a or the you know piece of evidence being brought
[3:14:29.960 --> 3:14:34.160]  in a is that two months before they changed the shootdown powers from the
[3:14:34.160 --> 3:14:38.240]  generals and admirals of their or their designates to only Dick Cheney or
[3:14:38.240 --> 3:14:44.280]  Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld I mean that was the first time since 57 they'd
[3:14:44.280 --> 3:14:52.020]  done that or then I'm sorry go ahead yeah no well you know if you look at the
[3:14:52.020 --> 3:14:59.160]  some of the the the stuff that's come out you know in the the investigation
[3:14:59.160 --> 3:15:03.640]  has been done by you know normal people people who are not in the in the
[3:15:03.640 --> 3:15:07.200]  business of doing these kinds of investigation have have produced enormous
[3:15:07.200 --> 3:15:16.720]  attack the pilots who managed to get the the the MTSB flight simulation data the
[3:15:16.720 --> 3:15:22.000]  black box data and it is you know conflicts on a very basic level with
[3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:27.040]  that produced by the 9-11 Commission so we have these two entities of the
[3:15:27.040 --> 3:15:31.040]  United States government disagreeing with each other about where the airplane
[3:15:31.040 --> 3:15:36.600]  went and the evidence that they gave us the MTSB to the pilots through the
[3:15:36.600 --> 3:15:42.000]  pilots of for 9-11 truth shows that the airplane that was flying there was too
[3:15:42.000 --> 3:15:47.600]  high to hit the building that's right they're all kind in each place you look
[3:15:47.600 --> 3:15:53.040]  there is the key here is there's many official stories there's many official
[3:15:53.040 --> 3:15:57.280]  fables and by doing this suit you're gonna get that or hopefully get that
[3:15:57.280 --> 3:16:03.440]  discovery well that will be the point we're gonna be telling the judge that
[3:16:03.440 --> 3:16:09.800]  we have said enough here to say okay now we begin the lawsuit now we begin the
[3:16:09.800 --> 3:16:15.280]  fact-finding process and that gives us the peanut power we get to say okay
[3:16:15.280 --> 3:16:18.800]  that's how these people come in sit down and we'll take their depositions and
[3:16:18.800 --> 3:16:23.840]  see what they have to say you know when Norman Manetta was testifying before the

[3:20:59.560 --> 3:21:05.760]  few people in US history to be in prison for writing a book that's what he's in
[3:21:05.760 --> 3:21:09.280]  jail for right now they told him like three or four years ago they said don't
[3:21:09.280 --> 3:21:12.720]  don't don't publish that anymore he didn't they put him in jail for a long
[3:21:12.720 --> 3:21:17.360]  time yeah there's all sorts of dangerous things happening our guest will be
[3:21:17.360 --> 3:21:20.800]  with us till about 45 after then I'm gonna hit some other news recap it and
[3:21:20.800 --> 3:21:25.440]  take some of your phone calls for those of you that have been holding I know a
[3:21:25.440 --> 3:21:32.640]  New Jersey cop who actually had had architects and engineers founder Gage
[3:21:32.640 --> 3:21:36.200]  in the town has been holding for a while I apologize to those folks having to
[3:21:36.200 --> 3:21:40.680]  hold but I have had all these guests on this is a short segment and we got one
[3:21:40.680 --> 3:21:46.080]  more with our guest I want to finish up with Bill Veal yeah let's go through the
[3:21:46.080 --> 3:21:50.960]  key points I mean the bullet points we wrote a story at prisonplanet.com
[3:21:50.960 --> 3:21:55.200]  title career army officer Susan Cheney Rumsfeld for 9-11 complicity but at the
[3:21:55.200 --> 3:21:59.360]  end of the article we post your suit and everybody should go read this because
[3:21:59.360 --> 3:22:05.840]  it reads as a who's who of the evidence of a inside job and they're gonna have a
[3:22:05.840 --> 3:22:10.880]  hard time rejecting this but if they do where do you go from there
[3:22:10.880 --> 3:22:16.600]  where do you go from there after you after you lost to me I mean you'd appeal it right well
[3:22:16.600 --> 3:22:23.480]  yeah no I mean we expect frankly to be in the appellate courts I mean I'm sorry
[3:22:23.480 --> 3:22:30.920]  to have a kind of a negative view but you know the history is that these
[3:22:30.920 --> 3:22:36.720]  people of power are able to manipulate things in such a way that you know they
[3:22:36.720 --> 3:22:40.280]  get to run out the string for as long as as anybody can imagine in the in the
[3:22:40.280 --> 3:22:45.560]  appellate courts and so I expect that they will find some argument that they
[3:22:45.560 --> 3:22:51.280]  can make that the judge will say okay well I think that's right and then we
[3:22:51.280 --> 3:22:56.920]  will have to appeal that judgment and that's what we'll do we'll take it
[3:22:56.920 --> 3:23:03.640]  wherever we have to take it and each time a judge will against us it'll be an
[3:23:03.640 --> 3:23:07.560]  opportunity for the media in this country to see whether or not there's
[3:23:07.560 --> 3:23:12.280]  duplicity going on here whether people being honest about themselves and if the
[3:23:12.280 --> 3:23:17.040]  judge rules in a dishonest way then yeah that's a time for everybody you know to
[3:23:17.040 --> 3:23:22.880]  watch the unmasking that's going on I think that our facts are are
[3:23:22.880 --> 3:23:27.120]  unassailable and we've got the law I think that the judge is gonna have a
[3:23:27.120 --> 3:23:31.880]  very hard time saying oh no this isn't that this isn't a lawsuit I think they're
[3:23:31.880 --> 3:23:35.440]  gonna have a very hard time doing that but if they do we'll pursue them well
[3:23:35.440 --> 3:23:41.120]  one area in your suit that I may have missed it may be in there but I didn't
[3:23:41.120 --> 3:23:46.400]  see it is a it is a predisposition or a history they admit the USS Liberty was
[3:23:46.400 --> 3:23:50.240]  staged now they admit the Gulf of Tonkin was staged they admit operation age acts
[3:23:50.240 --> 3:23:54.840]  with Iran was staged over 200 declassified admitted examples of the
[3:23:54.840 --> 3:23:59.640]  US government staging terror attacks against its own installations or against
[3:23:59.640 --> 3:24:05.000]  friends who they then want to you know you know basically sick on their enemies
[3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:09.200]  so with this long history of false flagged terror don't you think that's
[3:24:09.200 --> 3:24:12.560]  an important piece of evidence that that hey the people were charging with this
[3:24:12.560 --> 3:24:17.240]  have done this over and over again it's extremely important it's not the kind of
[3:24:17.240 --> 3:24:23.040]  thing that we needed to put in a in the complaint because if I mean the
[3:24:23.040 --> 3:24:27.400]  history by itself is not going to be enough to get you over but when the
[3:24:27.400 --> 3:24:31.760]  time comes for the trial boy the history is going to be really important there
[3:24:31.760 --> 3:24:36.720]  because what we have the one of the large problems we have in this in this
[3:24:36.720 --> 3:24:42.680]  situation is you know there's been this fortress of denial erected by each of us
[3:24:42.680 --> 3:24:48.120]  each human being fortress of denial I'm gonna steal that term well and but it's
[3:24:48.120 --> 3:24:53.720]  and it's and it's really it's an enormous fortress it's strong and you
[3:24:53.720 --> 3:24:59.240]  can't you can't really get there you can't fight against it in a massive way
[3:24:59.240 --> 3:25:03.080]  you have to kind of chip around and one of the things that seems to me that's
[3:25:03.080 --> 3:25:10.280]  helpful trying to to to beseech that fortress is by alerting people to the
[3:25:10.280 --> 3:25:16.280]  fact of the false flag operation and its history and and our history with it
[3:25:16.280 --> 3:25:21.160]  it's been their countless examples not countless but they are many examples
[3:25:21.160 --> 3:25:27.560]  important examples of beginning wars with the false flag and the idea that
[3:25:27.560 --> 3:25:32.880]  that the United States is somehow you know is above that or something or
[3:25:32.880 --> 3:25:37.120]  different from other nations and wouldn't use that sort of strategy is is
[3:25:37.120 --> 3:25:41.880]  it's just preposterous and so the people in the United States need to think okay
[3:25:41.880 --> 3:25:47.120]  well wait a minute what is about what is about us what is about our history in
[3:25:47.120 --> 3:25:52.400]  the last 70 years just for example that means that we are incapable of these
[3:25:52.400 --> 3:25:56.800]  things and when you start to ask those questions then the answer is there is
[3:25:56.800 --> 3:26:01.080]  nothing about us is makes us incapable and then you have motive and then you
[3:26:01.080 --> 3:26:05.000]  have the people running things this is one of their favorite tools I bet you're
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:09.320]  gonna try to bring Northwoods into the trial well I would think so I mean it's
[3:26:09.320 --> 3:26:14.640]  right there and in black and white Northwood you know but but if you ask
[3:26:14.640 --> 3:26:19.400]  me you know can you imagine for example the Soviet Union or Russia hold on
[3:26:19.400 --> 3:26:24.120]  stay there stay there final segment stay there Bill we'll be right back to you

[3:31:11.680 --> 3:31:15.200]  warning about the attacks in the World Trade Center because under the feds had
[3:31:15.200 --> 3:31:18.960]  bombed it unsuccessfully in 93 that's why I was on air saying call the
[3:31:18.960 --> 3:31:22.360]  White House tell Bush don't blow up the World Trade Center two months before it
[3:31:22.360 --> 3:31:25.960]  happened well really years before it happened I was saying they're gonna
[3:31:25.960 --> 3:31:29.160]  stage large terror attacks but we could see the preparation for what was
[3:31:29.160 --> 3:31:33.360]  happening there bill before we finish up with you and hopefully you in April back

[3:33:35.040 --> 3:33:39.520]  tyranny on on a hundred you know different subjects a week and this is
[3:33:39.520 --> 3:33:41.960]  one of the most important I can think of and I want to thank the lessons for
[3:33:41.960 --> 3:33:45.200]  previously supporting you guys and for them doing it now and I hope that they
[3:33:45.200 --> 3:33:48.000]  will we'll put that up on screen we've only got about six seven minutes left
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:33:52.080]  with you sir and I appreciate your time recapping and then getting into more key
[3:33:52.080 --> 3:33:55.280]  areas of the case I also interrupted you when you were getting up to the part of
[3:33:55.280 --> 3:33:58.840]  people can't believe our government would do this though it just came out that
[3:33:58.840 --> 3:34:03.560]  they killed General Patton as we already knew but now it's declassified because he
[3:34:03.560 --> 3:34:07.960]  wanted to get our troops out of a Soviet gulag that they taken from the
[3:34:07.960 --> 3:34:12.480]  Germans so oh you want to get 12,000 US troops away from the Soviets well we'll
[3:34:12.480 --> 3:34:16.200]  you know US troops will just kill you so I mean people need to come to grips with
[3:34:16.200 --> 3:34:21.880]  the military mind the mind of the elite we have please continue well I just think
[3:34:21.880 --> 3:34:25.040]  if you turn it around a little bit and you say all right you talk to the
[3:34:25.040 --> 3:34:31.320]  normal citizen do you think that the Soviet Union or Russia now is capable of
[3:34:31.320 --> 3:34:38.320]  for example bombing apartment buildings and claiming that is Chechen rebels who
[3:34:38.320 --> 3:34:41.880]  are doing it do you think that they're capable of that most people would say
[3:34:41.880 --> 3:34:44.760]  well certainly those those sorts of people do that kind of thing all the
[3:34:44.760 --> 3:34:53.240]  time well what about the Japanese in 1931 at the Mukden Bridge were they
[3:34:53.240 --> 3:34:58.440]  capable of massacring your own troops and then claiming it was the Chinese who
[3:34:58.440 --> 3:35:03.200]  did it well oh we say short certainly I think that's quite possible those kind
[3:35:03.200 --> 3:35:08.440]  of people other people not the United States well we'll think about it what
[3:35:08.440 --> 3:35:13.800]  really does differentiate us from other countries why are we incapable of that
[3:35:13.800 --> 3:35:18.480]  kind of look at the history and it turns out we've been using that technique
[3:35:18.480 --> 3:35:25.920]  plenty of times to start various things or if we didn't do it ourselves we we
[3:35:25.920 --> 3:35:31.680]  managed to implement a propaganda exercise which in essence coming to
[3:35:31.680 --> 3:35:34.800]  somebody else had done yeah one of their favorites one of their favorites is to
[3:35:34.800 --> 3:35:40.080]  hire a proxy group to do it clearly and then how to frame patsy's is also
[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:44.040]  included in things like Northwood's what are some of the other areas you're
[3:35:44.040 --> 3:35:52.120]  going into in the suit well and what is the suit seeking well the suit the suit
[3:35:52.120 --> 3:35:56.960]  will seek the damages for pain and suffering and all that sort of thing
[3:35:56.960 --> 3:36:00.640]  and but penitent punitive damages this is going to be opportunity if we get to
[3:36:00.640 --> 3:36:05.200]  trial which I hope we will for the American people it's literally to say
[3:36:05.200 --> 3:36:10.800]  okay what is the penalty for something like this and then they can you know the
[3:36:10.800 --> 3:36:16.760]  only thing that you can do is put zeros up but that's basically where we are
[3:36:16.760 --> 3:36:21.080]  since nobody in the justice system decided these people needed to be
[3:36:21.080 --> 3:36:26.760]  investigated on a criminal basis it's been left to the civil law and so we've
[3:36:26.760 --> 3:36:30.400]  brought the suit and alleged that they've committed these crimes through a
[3:36:30.400 --> 3:36:35.000]  conspiracy we're talking about Cheney Rumsfeld and Myers this is a common law
[3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:39.040]  conspiracy to cause death and great bodily harm and certainly hurt her and
[3:36:39.040 --> 3:36:43.000]  her child and a lot of other people killed some folks as well well it's
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:48.400]  right but it's also civil rights action for you know denial of civil rights and
[3:36:48.400 --> 3:36:54.560]  it's also you know a claim that they have retaliated against her for opening
[3:36:54.560 --> 3:36:59.120]  her mouth about what she saw and what she knew and so these are these are various
[3:36:59.120 --> 3:37:03.160]  causes of action under the common law and indeed and under the business case
[3:37:03.160 --> 3:37:08.640]  which is the the famous federal civil rights case we've said you have denied
[3:37:08.640 --> 3:37:14.120]  her federal civil rights and so therefore you deserve justice we she
[3:37:14.120 --> 3:37:19.360]  deserves justice and you have to pay for her denial of those rights denial of
[3:37:19.360 --> 3:37:25.440]  her rights so that's how you put it when the time comes but we will be you know
[3:37:25.440 --> 3:37:30.400]  making the arguments in court and the the the wonderful thing about this case
[3:37:30.400 --> 3:37:35.000]  that there is anything wonderful about it is the fact that there is it's it's
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:40.560]  across this enormous panoply of evidence we have every single kind of evidence
[3:37:40.560 --> 3:37:44.240]  that there is that exists it's incredible well people always say
[3:37:44.240 --> 3:37:48.400]  something this big they would be caught doing it they do get caught it's just
[3:37:48.400 --> 3:37:50.880]  they can they've always controlled the mainstream media so they keep that
[3:37:50.880 --> 3:37:54.400]  information from getting out of the public well they control the media and
[3:37:54.400 --> 3:37:57.760]  that's extremely important obviously we wouldn't be anywhere near where we are
[3:37:57.760 --> 3:38:02.360]  today if it weren't for the complicity either knowing or unwitting complicity
[3:38:02.360 --> 3:38:09.960]  of the media I think the most stunning example of that Jim Dwyer of the New
[3:38:09.960 --> 3:38:15.760]  York Times was the person who on behalf of the New York Times sued the state of
[3:38:15.760 --> 3:38:20.920]  New York and the city of New York to get the the firefighters stories you know
[3:38:20.920 --> 3:38:26.400]  from that day and wrote and wrote in an email to me when we were having
[3:38:26.400 --> 3:38:31.960]  correspondence our thing is nothing from a personal there's no human evidence
[3:38:31.960 --> 3:38:35.840]  there's no human testimony that supports the idea of controlled
[3:38:35.840 --> 3:38:39.640]  demolition for example the Twin Towers are and then all over the tapes it's
[3:38:39.640 --> 3:38:45.760]  there but you know what is the level of denial that can exist that allows a
[3:38:45.760 --> 3:38:50.800]  person who actually goes to the to the extent of filing a lawsuit gets them
[3:38:50.800 --> 3:38:58.000]  the 500 stories of the firefighters and the EMTs which include a hundred and
[3:38:58.000 --> 3:39:02.440]  some examples of people talking about the explosions that went off in those
[3:39:02.440 --> 3:39:08.800]  buildings how do you get to say if that doesn't exist so you know I don't know
[3:39:08.800 --> 3:39:14.640]  frankly it's a fascinating subject to to plumb the depths of the denial it goes
[3:39:14.640 --> 3:39:18.240]  on here and ask people the question whether whether or not they're actually
[3:39:18.240 --> 3:39:22.680]  acting honestly listen listen there are people in denial that the Federal
[3:39:22.680 --> 3:39:25.800]  Reserve is private there are people in denial that they've stolen 8.5 trillion
[3:39:25.800 --> 3:39:30.840]  and that's what we know of the the the numbers growing people are in denial
[3:39:30.840 --> 3:39:38.720]  neocons on the radio still say that WMDs were found in Iraq so so so so there
[3:39:38.720 --> 3:39:43.760]  is a religion of denial sir I want to get you back up in the near future as
[3:39:43.760 --> 3:39:49.360]  this develops and as this unfolds and to get more into this landmark case Bill
[3:39:49.360 --> 3:39:53.200]  thank you so much for the time you've spent with us today and sir thank you
[3:39:53.200 --> 3:39:57.800]  for your work work I appreciate it you bet you know in the new year or or as

[3:40:07.200 --> 3:40:11.720]  federal court in the southern district of New York okay and how long until we get

[3:40:19.200 --> 3:40:23.960]  watch this as it develops is April Gallup excited that you took her case and
[3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:28.760]  are doing this well I nobody's excited about this but she's she's a courageous
[3:40:28.760 --> 3:40:34.720]  woman it's just a inspiration frankly to know her I mean when you almost
[3:40:34.720 --> 3:40:39.360]  fly off a cliff in a car it's exciting I meant I mean is she make a good point
[3:40:39.360 --> 3:40:44.160]  sir I mean is she fired up though that I mean that you know you know she's a
[3:40:44.160 --> 3:40:48.920]  soldier and she wants this done that's right I mean she's she's I guess
[3:40:48.920 --> 3:40:53.520]  excited would be a word that you could use but she's she's made the decision
[3:40:53.520 --> 3:40:56.880]  we're going forward here and let's do it I think the right word is she's
[3:40:56.880 --> 3:41:01.160]  committed oh there's no doubt about that there's no doubt about well we appreciate
[3:41:01.160 --> 3:41:06.000]  your commitment Bill I I can't imagine how much work and time and energy and

[3:41:21.280 --> 3:41:24.720]  lighter note I'm gonna come back and take a few final calls in the last second
[3:41:24.720 --> 3:41:27.960]  but on a lighter note we have some really serious world news world faces
[3:41:27.960 --> 3:41:33.720]  total financial meltdown the bank head of the private bank in Spain has to say
[3:41:33.720 --> 3:41:38.560]  and we have the made-off guy stealing more than a hundred billion and saying
[3:41:38.560 --> 3:41:42.600]  he did it all alone this is part of the course in Wall Street how do we protect
[3:41:42.600 --> 3:41:46.480]  ourselves from the bankers and uncertain times with our little leprechaun Ted
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:42:05.840]  Anderson and here is his theme song
[3:42:46.480 --> 3:42:58.760]  absolutely ladies and gentlemen and now the Swedish leprechaun he's an exchange
[3:42:58.760 --> 3:43:05.440]  student from the Emerald Isle the the Swedish leprechaun Ted Anderson 30 years
[3:43:05.440 --> 3:43:08.640]  in the golden silver business joins us Ted good to have you here popping in
[3:43:08.640 --> 3:43:13.280]  with us on the 22nd of December 2008 hey it's a great day to be here to Alex of
[3:43:13.280 --> 3:43:20.960]  course you know the the auto manufacturer oh I can't even tell you like your
[3:43:20.960 --> 3:43:25.080]  little intro song yeah I like that that's cute I was laughing and so I can't
[3:43:25.080 --> 3:43:29.640]  think of Toyota of course posting billion dollar losses first time since
[3:43:29.640 --> 3:43:33.200]  they've been in business that they've had to post losses on their auto sales I
[3:43:33.200 --> 3:43:37.920]  mean the market is really trying to want to know what a golden yeah you know we
[3:43:37.920 --> 3:43:41.680]  just had Peter Schiff on talking about how people need gold and silver and he's
[3:43:41.680 --> 3:43:45.680]  not a gold or silver broker and you know talking about total depression total
[3:43:45.680 --> 3:43:51.240]  collapse I had Gerald Salente on I mean I've got bank heads Prime Minister
[3:43:51.240 --> 3:43:55.400]  saying this people have to get out of dollars and they have to get out of them
[3:43:55.400 --> 3:44:01.000]  now and the reason we've got you here today Ted is so people can protect
[3:44:01.000 --> 3:44:05.800]  themselves from Wall Street run by a bunch of made-offs who will and have
[3:44:05.800 --> 3:44:09.640]  stolen your pension funds dry people need to convert a large portion into
[3:44:09.640 --> 3:44:12.800]  silver or gold they need to get a good place to physically hold it who do you
[3:44:12.800 --> 3:44:17.000]  trust trust yourselves ladies and gentlemen to physically hold it and
[3:44:17.000 --> 3:44:22.760]  Ted bought gold a week and a half ago when it was 770 it's 850 something today
[3:44:22.760 --> 3:44:29.440]  it's up today move now buy it at 770 because Ted bought it early he's almost
[3:44:29.440 --> 3:44:34.840]  sold out of that new position remember when it was 700 and it was 820 and Ted
[3:44:34.840 --> 3:44:38.840]  was selling it from 700 levels now it's 770 you know that he bought it at and
[3:44:38.840 --> 3:44:42.800]  it's 850 don't wait again while it goes up and up and up uses a buying
[3:44:42.800 --> 3:44:46.840]  opportunity Ted tell people how they protect themselves from made-off well
[3:44:46.840 --> 3:44:49.840]  here's the thing I mean they do they should take gold and they should get it
[3:44:49.840 --> 3:44:54.040]  in their own physical position and their own physical possession I mean when it
[3:44:54.040 --> 3:44:57.040]  comes down to the point where if you're hungry you don't want a pitcher of cana
[3:44:57.040 --> 3:45:00.560]  beans you want the beans on the table and that's the same thing with the gold
[3:45:00.560 --> 3:45:05.000]  when the economy fails everything falls apart you don't want to have your
[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:10.160]  gold stored at some brokerage firm in New York City or wherever you want it in
[3:45:10.160 --> 3:45:14.120]  your hands and that's why I suggest that you does a leprechaun have it in his
[3:45:14.120 --> 3:45:18.680]  hand or in a foreign bank no they don't have it in foreign banks I'm sure but I
[3:45:18.680 --> 3:45:22.920]  can tell you right now he got the gold in his hand yeah you better believe they
[3:45:22.920 --> 3:45:27.360]  but if if you want to protect yourself from the kind of economy that we're
[3:45:27.360 --> 3:45:31.960]  facing right now you do not want to have your gold stored at some place or buy
[3:45:31.960 --> 3:45:35.920]  some shares some stock anything like that you need to have it physically in
[3:45:35.920 --> 3:45:41.880]  your position and so in your possession right now like you said Alex 203 for the
[3:45:41.880 --> 3:45:46.960]  Franks that's the same price that's the same price that I was offering them when
[3:45:46.960 --> 3:45:53.000]  gold was down there at the at the price of 770 so the gold prices have gone up
[3:45:53.000 --> 3:45:56.280]  they're up again today British sovereigns like I said on those British
[3:45:56.280 --> 3:46:01.560]  sovereigns I've been getting them out of Belgium and at first everything was
[3:46:01.560 --> 3:46:04.500]  circulated that I was getting now I'm getting brand new coins they're
[3:46:04.500 --> 3:46:08.400]  obviously dipping into their the reserves that are new they want to get
[3:46:08.400 --> 3:46:11.840]  rid of their junk first now they're getting rid of their good stuff you know
[3:46:11.840 --> 3:46:15.560]  the British side of the gold coins are junk that's a term in industry for
[3:46:15.560 --> 3:46:20.160]  circulated yeah I've got up on prisonplanet.tv-resources.com with
[3:46:20.160 --> 3:46:27.080]  the number 800-686-2237 now now Ted at that 770 price you've got what the
[3:46:27.080 --> 3:46:31.480]  British sovereigns the Franks the European Franks are those uncirculated as
[3:46:31.480 --> 3:46:35.120]  well yeah well the European Franks are coming in a lot of them are uncirculated
[3:46:35.120 --> 3:46:38.400]  but the British sovereigns are super deal there what else do you have at the 770 level
[3:46:38.400 --> 3:46:42.640]  well that British sovereign at 252 I also have silver right now a silver
[3:46:42.640 --> 3:46:47.920]  walking Liberty halves at 840 now mind you silver is at $11 an ounce it was at
[3:46:47.920 --> 3:46:52.360]  nine that's a $2 increase and and I still have the plus there's a huge
[3:46:52.360 --> 3:46:56.160]  premium on all gold and silver out there instead of paying a premium to get it
[3:46:56.160 --> 3:46:59.600]  because everybody's buying it up you're paying below what the market is because
[3:46:59.600 --> 3:47:03.520]  Ted buys when it's low and then is selling it right now while it's high and
[3:47:03.520 --> 3:47:12.560]  passing all those savings on to you 800-686-2237-800-686-2337 Ted how long
[3:47:12.560 --> 3:47:15.880]  can you hold this deal well for sure tell midnight and I'm watching the market
[3:47:15.880 --> 3:47:18.680]  too and I got to see how many people are gonna be ordering but I do order
[3:47:18.680 --> 3:47:22.440]  supply when the price is dip and you know just it doesn't take a rocket
[3:47:22.440 --> 3:47:26.360]  scientist to watch what's going on in this economy but I know you're running out of
[3:47:26.360 --> 3:47:30.920]  the 770 position you bet that's starting to sell out and we sold an awful lot of it
[3:47:30.920 --> 3:47:37.240]  last week hold on Ted hold on hold on Ionic zone has the lowest prices in the

[3:50:37.880 --> 3:50:42.320]  to get to in the show we ran out of time today one of them was I knew in
[3:50:42.320 --> 3:50:45.440]  California they threw out most of the red light cameras because there wasn't a
[3:50:45.440 --> 3:50:50.920]  police officer riding the ticket which is a citation that he has to swear to
[3:50:50.920 --> 3:50:56.520]  that it was Lockheed Martin in the case of San Diego so it was thrown out and in
[3:50:56.520 --> 3:50:59.880]  Texas in most other states you have to be registered as a private detective if
[3:50:59.880 --> 3:51:03.480]  you're gathering data for the state and there's a bunch of special licenses for
[3:51:03.480 --> 3:51:07.200]  that in Texas from Dallas to Austin they've raised hundreds of millions of
[3:51:07.200 --> 3:51:11.400]  dollars with these illegal red light cameras and when the Texas Supreme
[3:51:11.400 --> 3:51:17.760]  Court and others said you can't do this anymore this is illegal Austin of all the
[3:51:17.760 --> 3:51:22.200]  city said we don't care if it breaks the law we're keeping them all there I mean
[3:51:22.200 --> 3:51:25.160]  it's just he could give the government is out of control and I want to take one
[3:51:25.160 --> 3:51:28.400]  final call has been holding the longest here in just a moment John New Jersey but
[3:51:28.400 --> 3:51:31.480]  before we do that Ted Anderson when everything's going to hell in a hand
[3:51:31.480 --> 3:51:35.280]  basket and you can't trust the system you need gold you need silver you need
[3:51:35.280 --> 3:51:40.720]  firearms you need guts you need God and you need water filters you need to be
[3:51:40.720 --> 3:51:43.960]  self-sufficient that's a great deal on gold and silver people aren't gonna find
[3:51:43.960 --> 3:51:47.840]  a better deal I can't explain to them that you buy gold you have the 770 level
[3:51:47.840 --> 3:51:53.200]  it's 850 plus right now they'd be crazy to not take advantage of this deal don't
[3:51:53.200 --> 3:51:56.440]  they understand there's huge premiums everywhere else most places can't even
[3:51:56.440 --> 3:52:00.280]  get gold and silver but you can well that's the thing I mean the premiums
[3:52:00.280 --> 3:52:03.960]  are going up like crazy and that's why I try to buy at the lower prices when the
[3:52:03.960 --> 3:52:09.320]  gold and silver shoots up it gives the customers the the listeners a break a
[3:52:09.320 --> 3:52:13.880]  chance to buy at a better price you know yeah if I go back in the marketplace
[3:52:13.880 --> 3:52:18.600]  and just try to repurchase what I what I'm offering for you today that you
[3:52:18.600 --> 3:52:21.920]  know it's gonna be twenty thirty dollars higher a coin I mean that's that's how
[3:52:21.920 --> 3:52:26.240]  much it's gone up and it'll happen like that anyways because I mean with Toyota
[3:52:26.240 --> 3:52:31.800]  melting down and and and all of all of Detroit being shut down and yeah
[3:52:31.800 --> 3:52:35.880]  bottom line don't trust in the government they want you dependent do the
[3:52:35.880 --> 3:52:39.800]  opposite become independent people say well why gold or silver because that's
[3:52:39.800 --> 3:52:44.280]  one of the few real currencies gold and silver been used for more than 6,000
[3:52:44.280 --> 3:52:49.200]  years it is the basis of society it will always have intrinsic value and it's
[3:52:49.200 --> 3:52:53.280]  portable it's portable that you know they can put a property tax on your land
